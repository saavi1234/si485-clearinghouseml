As to the claim that the amount of the deposit is excessive as far exceeding the dollar amount of anticipated claims to be made against the common fund, that application is denied because (1) it was not advanced previously, and (2) it is unaccompanied by statutory or decisional authority indicating that the requested adjustment should be made. Lastly, the defendants correctly not that the judgment as written requires that deposit of the money absent any provision about interest being earned on those monies during a period they are held by the Court Clerk. Accordingly, as part of the anticipated stay application, I will entertain an application that I direct the Clerk to place the deposited common fund in an interest bearing account and I will welcome input from counsel as to the nature of the account into which the sums should be deposited. terminating 468 Motion to Alter Judgment.

The Court placed a hold (i. e. stoppage on the running of the three year statute of limitations) on May 20, 1999. That hold continues to be in effect until 180 days after June 16, 2016, so that you will have until at least December 13, 2016 to file an individual lawsuit for add itional damages. This means the amount of time you have to file a separate lawsuit depends upon the date you were stripped search. For example, if you were strip searched anytime from May 20, 1996 until November 16, 1996, you have until December 13,  2016 to file a separate individual lawsuit for additional damages. For example, if you were strip searched on June 1, 1997, you would have one year after December 13, 2016 to file your individual lawsuit for additional damages.  If you were strip sea rched on June 1, 1998, you would have two years after December 13, 2016 to file your individual lawsuit for additional damages. If you were strip searched on June 1, 1999, you have the entire three-year statute of limitations period to file a separate lawsuit. If you have a question about additional damages or the amount of time you have to file a separate you should contact an attorney. See attached Memorandum & Order. Ordered by Judge Denis R. Hurley on 7/28/2016.  (Gapinski, Michele)"

    "summary": "<p>On May 20, 1999, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Represented by private New York attorneys, the plaintiffs challenged the blanket strip search policy of the Nassau County Correctional Center. Under the policy, the plaintiffs alleged, all misdemeanor and minor offense arrestees were strip-searched, without reasonable suspicion that the arrestees were concealing weapons or other contraband. The plaintiffs alleged the policy violated the Fourth Amendment and sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.</p>\r\n<p>This case, which was styled O'Day v. Nassau County, was one of three cases that were filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, challenging the blanket strip search policy of the Nassau County Correctional Center. The other two cases were <a href=\"../../../../case/9893/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Iaffaldano v. County of Nassau</a> and <a href=\"../../../../case/9514/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Augustin v. Jablonsky</a>. The plaintiffs in all three cases moved to consolidate the cases and for class certification for a class defined as \"all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been admitted to the Nassau County Correctional Center and strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion.\" The District Court (Distrct Judge Denis J. Hurley) consolidated the cases, but denied class certification. Augustin v. Jablonsky , 2001 WL 770839 (E.D. N.Y. Mar. 08, 2001).</p>\r\n<p>See <a href=\"../../../../case/9514/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Augustin v. Jablonsky</a>&nbsp;for the full summary of proceedings occurring after consolidation of the three cases.</p>\r\n<p>On April 10, 2014 the court entered final judgment for the defendant on Federal constitutional claims, and for the plaintiff class on state constitutional claims, awarding $11,508,000 in damages as well as attorney's fees. Both the plaintiff class and the defendant filed appeals.</p>\r\n<p>The defendant filed for additional time to make the deposit necessary for the disbursement of compensatory damages. On April 30, 2014, Judge Denis R.</p>\r\n<p>Hurley denied this motion as premature. The defendants then moved for a show cause hearing to stay the execution of judgment. Following a show cause hearing on June 4, 2014, the court ordered the award stayed for 180 days, with an alternative option to stay the award payment indefinitely with the posting of a $11,508,000 bond.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants filed a motion to stay the final judgment in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals on November 12, 2014. The court granted this motion on December 23, 2014.</p>\r\n<p>On February 26, 2016, the Appellate court (Judge Jose A. Cabranes, Judge Rosemary S. Pooler, Judge Denny Chin) upheld the District court ruling. The court agreed with the District court's reasoning that there were no grounds for federal relief but there were state constitutional violations for which plaintiffs should be awarded relief.</p>\r\n<p>On August 18, 2016, the Appellate court denied the defendants' motion to stay the mandate. On September 6, 2016, the defendants filed a writ of certiorari to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. On October 12, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the writ of certiorari.</p>\r\n<p>Litigation continued for a year regarding the distribution of funds. The case is now closed.</p>",

Saffron, Esq.\nLiora Ben-Sorek, Esq.\nHURLEY, Senior District Judge:\nPresently before the Court is a motion by defendants seeking “to decertify the class going\nforward now that the issue of common general damages upon which the Court based class\n2\n\ncertification has been resolved.”  (Defs.’ Mem. at 1.)1  Plaintiffs oppose the application, asserting\nthat the Court can (and should) compensate class members for damages stemming from “garden-\nvariety emotional distress, shame and humiliation that flow naturally from being unlawfully strip\nsearched,” and that “these general damages for garden-variety emotional distress, shame and\nhumiliation should be determined and awarded on a class-wide basis in a single trial in this class\naction as soon as possible.”  (Pls.’ Opp’n at 5.)  For the reasons that follow, defendants’\napplication is granted.\nBACKGROUND\nThe background of this action is set forth in the prior decisions of this Court, familiarity\nwith which is presumed.  The Court will partially reiterate an abbreviated history in order to\nprovide context for the Court’s analysis and rulings, infra.\nClass Certification \nThese consolidated actions were commenced in 1999 seeking damages due to the blanket\npolicy of the Nassau County Correctional Center of strip searching newly admitted individuals\narrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offenses in Nassau County.  Extensive pretrial motion\npractice ensued, including plaintiffs’ numerous attempts to achieve class certification.  In\nresponse thereto, defendants conceded liability.  Based on that concession, this Court deleted\nliability from the certification analysis and denied class treatment.  On appeal, the Second Circuit\n1 Defendants note, preliminarily, that “it is not at all clear that a formal\ndecertification order would even be necessary to end this litigation now that the common\ndamages issue has been resolved, because it is not at all clear that the current certification\nextends to special damages . . . Thus, it appears as if the Court would need to affirmatively\ncertify a subclass or subclasses in order to continue the litigation, rather than [ ] formally\ndecertify the class in order to bring it to a conclusion.”  (Defs.’ Mem. at 2.)  \n3\n\nreversed and directed this Court “to certify a class on the issue of liability . . . and consider anew\nwhether to certify a class as to damages as well.”  In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461\nF.3d 219, 231 (2d Cir. 2006).  Accordingly, the Court certified a class as to liability and entered\nsummary judgment on liability in favor of the class and each of its members.  (Jan. 16, 2007\nOrder at 2.)  After the Court sought input from the parties concerning damages certification,\nplaintiffs filed an application to certify the class as to plaintiffs’ entire claims, i.e., to extend class\ncertification to include damages.   \nMarch 27, 2008 Memorandum and Order \nIn a Memorandum and Order dated March 27, 2008, the Court addressed the question of\nwhether a damages class could be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3).  (Mar. 27, 2008 Mem. &\nOrder at 4.)  Having previously determined that Rule 23(a)’s requirements of numerosity,\ncommonality, typicality and adequacy had been met in this case, the Court considered whether\nplaintiffs sufficiently demonstrated both (1) that the damages questions of law or fact common to\nthe members of the class predominated over any damages issues affecting only individual\nmembers; and (2) that a class action was superior to other available methods for the fair and\nefficient adjudication of the damages controversy.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs argued, and the Court agreed,\nthat an injury to human dignity was necessarily entailed in being strip searched and thus was\ncommon to each member of the class as to its cause and the resulting general, or presumed – as\ndistinct from the special – damages sustained.  (Id. at 6.)   \nOver the objection of defendants, the Court, relying heavily by analogy on the Second\n4\n\nCircuit’s decision in Kerman v. City of New York, 374 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2004),2 found that the\nissue of general damages due to the asserted injury to human dignity predominated (Mar. 27,\n2008 Mem. & Order at 7-11), and concluded that where, as here, “class members were aggrieved\nby a single, admittedly unlawful policy [resulting in] a strong commonality between the strip\nsearch violation and the harm,” there was “no reason [to believe] that a jury . . . could not\ndetermine an amount of general damages awardable to each member of the class.”  (Id. at 12.) \nThat comment, however, was coupled with the caveat that “care would have to be taken to ensure\nthat the amount awarded for general damages excludes all elements of special damages that\nindividual class member[s] might [later] pursue.”  (Id. at 12-13 (emphasis added).)  The Court\nnoted, in closing, that “Plaintiffs are not asking this Court to select a particular damages model or\nto certify any subclasses for special damages as to do so would be ‘premature.’” (Id. at 13-14\n(emphasis added).)       \nMarch 16, 2009 Memorandum and Order\nSubsequently, the Court held a conference in advance of the upcoming trial for general\ndamages and, by Memorandum and Order dated March 16, 2009, addressed several issues that\n2 In Kerman, a jury found that the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights were\nviolated by his unjustified detention in a psychiatric hospital overnight, but awarded him only\nnominal damages.  The Second Circuit found that he was entitled to a new trial with respect to\nhis claim for damages due to his loss of liberty.  The Circuit noted that a plaintiff is never\nautomatically entitled to a substantial damages award simply because he has been deprived of a\nconstitutional right.  See Kerman, 374 F.3d at 122-23.  But where, as in Kerman, a jury found\nthat a constitutional violation unquestionably resulted in an injury to the plaintiff, that plaintiff\nwas entitled to an award of “compensatory, not merely nominal, damages.”  Id. at 125.  In its\nMarch 27, 2008 Memorandum & Order, this Court saw no dispute that the unconstitutional strip\nsearches at issue “resulted in some injury to the class members.”  (Mar. 27, 2008 Mem. & Order\nat 10.)  For the reasons set forth in Kerman, the Court found that “[a]t the very least, class\nmembers are entitled to general damages.”  (Id. at 11.) \n5\n\narose during that conference.  In particular, the issue of whether the trial witnesses would be\npermitted to testify not only “as to the details of the strip search that he or she experienced[,] . . .\nbut also any concomitant feelings of humiliation, embarrassment or other reaction experienced\nby the witness as a result of the process.”  (Mar. 16, 2009 Mem. & Order at 2.)  The Court\nrecognized that if trial witnesses “were permitted to testify concerning the humiliation and other\neffects” of the strip search that he or she individually experienced as distinct from those which\nmay be presumed to have been inflicted on all persons so victimized, “the amount determined by\nthe jury would be less likely to be representative of the general damage sustained by each\nmember of the class.”  (Id. at 5-6.)  The reason for that is, “if provided a choice, plaintiffs’\ncounsel surely, and legitimately so, would call to the stand those plaintiffs among the 17,000 plus\nclass members they believed to be the most severely impacted from being strip searched.”  (Id. at\n5-6.)  The Court reasoned that “excluding such specific impact evidence from this part of the\nproceeding” would “essentially eliminate[ ]” the “problem of a non-representative per plaintiff\namount being returned by the jury.”  (Id. at 6.)  Accordingly, each party was permitted to “call up\nto ten fact witnesses from the class . . . [to] testify solely concerning the details of the search\nwithout any information concerning the effect that the search had upon them” personally.  (Id.)  \nThe Court continued that “[t]his line of demarcation as to the parameters of permissible\ntestimony will not negatively effect any individual plaintiff because to the extent such individual\ndid sustain humiliation, embarrassment or emotional distress [beyond those presumed from being\nunlawfully strip searched], those items may be pursued during the special damages portion of the\nproceeding which will be held before another jury.”  (Id. at 7.)  The March 16, 2009 decision\nconcluded with the observation that the Court had “thus far only addressed general damage class\n6\n\ncertification; at the conclusion of this phase of the proceeding, the court and the parties will\ndiscuss what further damage subclasses should be certified, if any, and how the remainder of the\ncase will be resolved.”  (Id. at 7 n.2.)  \nThe Award of General Damages\nThe parties subsequently waived the right to a jury trial and submitted the issue of a\ngeneral damages determination to the Court.  A bench trial was held over eleven days, ending on\nDecember 16, 2009, with all post-trial submissions being filed by April 14, 2010.  By decision\ndated September 22, 2010, general damages in the amount of $500 per strip search were\nawarded,3 coupled with the observation that “the special damages sustained by class members is\na subject for another day.”  (Sept. 22, 2010 Mem. & Order at 66.) \nOn October 2, 2010, a status conference was held to discuss, inter alia, “how to handle\nthe second phase of the case, the special damages.”  (Tr. of Oct. 1, 2010 Status Conf. (“Tr.”) at\n21.)  Specifically, the Court sought input from the parties regarding “whether the special damage\npart of the case should be bifurcated between what the attorneys call garden-variety . . . [and]\nsome heightened type of special damage.”  (Id.)  Plaintiffs expressed their view that for the\n“second phase” “there ought to be a single trial, either before a Judge or a jury, to try to fix an\naggregate class award for the garden-variety emotional distress damage.”  (Id. at 34.)  Plaintiffs\ncontended that “[w]e have been defining special damages as those subjective feeling damages\nthat are different from the general human dignity damages . . . And everybody in the [c]lass has\nthose, or those can be determined on a class-wide basis for those.”  (Id. at 50-51.)  After the\n3 Class membership is approximately 17,000; some class members were strip\nsearched more than once, resulting in approximately 22,000 strip searches of class members\nduring the class period.  \n7\n\nstatus conference, the parties were directed to submit further briefing regarding, inter alia,\nwhether a common trial for “garden-variety”4 special damages may be held.  (Oct. 8, 2010 Order\nat 1-2.)  After reviewing the defendants’ briefs submitted on the common special damages issue,\nthe Court issued an Electronic Order dated January 25, 2011 stating that “Defendants have asked\nfor leave to move to decertify now that the issue of general damages has been resolved,” and set a\nbriefing schedule for that motion.  (Elec. Order, Jan. 25, 2011.)  \nDISCUSSION\nI. The Parties’ Contentions\nDefendants assert that “there is no substantive justification for continuing class litigation\nof any remaining individual special damage claims now that the common class damages issue has\nbeen resolved.”  (Defs.’ Mem. at 4.)  Preliminarily, defendants contend that “while the Court and\nthe parties have come to speak of a ‘Phase 2’ special damages proceeding as if it were a given, in\nits formal rulings the Court has held in abeyance the question of whether to litigate such damages\nin the present class action . . . Thus, it appears as if the Court would need to affirmatively certify\na subclass or subclasses in order to continue the litigation, rather than need to formally decertify\nthe class in order to bring it to a conclusion.”  (Id. at 3.)  In any event, defendants argue that the\nCourt should decline to certify (or decertify, as the case may be) any special damages subclasses\nbecause, as noted in this Court’s previous decisions denying class certification, special damages\nare “too inherently individualized and variable to be tried on a class basis.”  (Id. at 4.) \n4 “Garden-variety,” as used herein, is plaintiffs’ term – not the Court’s.  Plaintiffs\nuse the term to suggest a form of damages that have a certain degree of commonality, such that\nindividualized proof would not be necessary.  In repeating plaintiffs’ “garden-variety” term in\nthis Memorandum & Order, the Court does not adopt or attempt to reconvey such a suggested\nmeaning.  \n8\n\nDefendants assert that the resolution of the “sole predominant common issue” – the common\ninjury to human dignity – leaves the litigation “without a sufficiently common injury to support\nclass certification under Rule 23(b)(3).”  (Id. at 1.)   \nIn opposition, plaintiffs contend that this Court decided “to certify the damages class\nwithout limitation,” and that the Second Circuit’s opinion in In re Nassau County Strip Search\nCases, 461 F.3d 219, 231 (2d Cir. 2006) “made no mention of bifurcating the damages class, or\ncertifying the class for only some damages.”  (Pls.’ Opp’n at 3.)  Plaintiffs assert that the\n“Court’s holding that class-wide damages may be determined and awarded for dignitary damages\nis also applicable to other general damages such as emotional distress damages.”  (Id. at 4.) \nAccording to plaintiffs:\nWhile the Court has [ ] on occasion expressed the view that “special\ndamages” may be excluded and pursued by individual plaintiffs, we\ncontinue to contend that such “special damages” do not include the\ngarden-variety emotional distress which may be presumed to have\nbeen experienced from the unlawful strip searches in this case . . . but\nrather, that they refer to the more serious psychiatric injury that may\nbe claimed by a minority of class members who, for example, may\nhave required mental health treatment for psychological sequellae and\nsymptoms which go beyond garden-variety emotional distress, shame\nand humiliation that flow naturally from being unlawfully strip\nsearched.\n(Id. at 5.)  Plaintiffs maintain that class members’ emotional distress that was “necessarily\nproduce[d]” by the “unlawful involuntary strip searches” performed in this case, “is compensable\nin general damages on a class-wide basis.”  (Id. at 8.)\nII. The Court Does not Consider Damages for So-Called “Garden-Variety” Emotional\nDistress to be General Damages \nPlaintiffs incorporate by reference numerous prior submissions in support of their\n9\n\nposition on the present application.  (See Pls.’ Opp’n at 1.)  Among them is plaintiffs’ May 28,\n2010 letter, which was submitted following a May 17, 2010 conference in order to “further\namplify our views” on the following two issues: “(1) whether the Court could treat the class\ngarden variety emotional damages within the rubric of general damages, and (2) whether garden\nvariety emotional damages are susceptible to resolution on a class basis without selecting\nrepresentative plaintiffs on a random sampling statistical basis.”  (Pls.’ May 28, 2010 Letter at 1.) \nWith respect to the first issue, plaintiffs agreed with defendants “that garden variety emotional\ndistress damages actually suffered by the class should not be treated within the rubric of general\ndamages.”  (Id. (emphases added).)  Accordingly, plaintiffs requested that the Court “enter its\ngeneral damages verdict and that we should then proceed to phase 2 to determine what additional\naward should be made to the class for garden-variety emotional distress damages.”  (Id.)    \nPlaintiffs, however, clarified their view that “the ‘humiliation and mental suffering’\ncomponent . . . is an appropriate part of the general damages verdict upon which the Court [was\nthen] deliberating.”  (Id.)  Relying on Kerman v. City of New York, 374 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2004),\nplaintiffs asserted that:\n[E]motional damages (garden-variety or otherwise) actually suffered\nby an individual plaintiff is separate from general damages.  But (and\nhere is the confusing part) “humiliation and mental suffering” and\nother  emotional  damages  actually  suffered  by  the  individual  is\ndifferent from the “humiliation and mental suffering” that may be\ninferred from the loss of liberty inherent in the false imprisonment\nitself, and it is the latter “humiliation and mental suffering” which\nKerman held is a legitimate part of general damages.\n(Pls.’ May 28, 2010 Letter at 2 (emphases in the original).)  According to plaintiffs, therefore:\nGarden variety emotional damages actually suffered by an individual\nclass member forced to endure the unlawful strip search at the Nassau\n10\n\nCounty Jail may not be treated within the rubric of general damages. \nBut the humiliation and mental suffering that may be presumed to\narise in a reasonable person subjected to such strip search is an\nintegral component of general damages which may be awarded\nwithout proof.\n(Id. at 4 (emphases omitted).)  \nTo the extent that plaintiffs maintain that a general damages award should include an\nelement of “‘humiliation and mental suffering’ that may be inferred from the loss of liberty\ninherent in the false imprisonment itself” (Pls.’ May 28, 2010 Letter at 2), the Court has already\nconsidered and taken into account this claim in rendering the $500 per strip search award.  The\nabove-quoted section of plaintiffs’ May 28, 2010 letter suggests that they are of the impression\nthat the damages trial dealt solely with compensating class members for the “loss of liberty”\ninherent in each strip search.  As the Court made clear in its September 22, 2010 decision,\nhowever, such a loss of liberty, while implicated, was not the primary thrust of the wrong for\nwhich damages were awarded.  Rather, the Court found that “[e]ach class member suffered the\nsame injury to human dignity inherent in the loss of the right to determine which individual or\nindividuals may visually inspect that member[’s] naked body, particularly his or her sexual\norgans, and under what circumstances.”  (Sept. 22, 2010 Mem. & Order at 39; see also Mar. 27,\n2008 Mem. & Order at 10-11 (noting class members are entitled to general damages to\ncompensate for “serious intrusion” and “impairment of privacy” caused by unlawful strip search)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).)  Thus, the $500 per strip search award necessarily included\ncompensation for this form of presumed emotional distress damages.  Plaintiffs cannot recover a\nsecond time for the same injury.  Individuals claiming to have sustained emotional distress\nbeyond those which have been presumed and, as such, included within the general damages\n11\n\naward, may seek special damages but not, as plaintiffs urge, a duplicate award under a further\nsubset of general damages.  Simply put, the Court rejects the proposition that there is a\nmeaningful distinction between plaintiffs’ presumed “garden-variety” emotional distress on the\none hand, and the shared emotional injuries presumed to flow from the affront to human dignity\nnecessarily caused by being strip searched on the other.  For present purposes, the concepts are\nessentially the same.      \nIn urging a contrary conclusion, viz. that the scope of general damages should be enlarged\nto include the “garden-variety” emotional distress, shame, and humiliation that flow naturally\nfrom being unlawfully strip searched (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 1, 5), plaintiffs cite the following\npassage of the Court’s March 27, 2008 Memorandum & Order extending class certification to\ninclude general damages:\nThe Second Circuit has recognized, for example, that class-wide\nrather than individual assessments of monetary relief may sometimes\nbe appropriate in class discrimination cases.  See Robinson v. Metro-\nNorth, 267 F.3d 147, 161 n.6 (2d Cir. 2001).  See also Berger v. Iron\nWorkers Reinforced Rodmen, Local 201, 170 F.3d 1111, 1138 (D.C.\nCir. 1999) (holding that it was appropriate to presume that as a result\nof race discrimination those class members who were experienced\nrodmen suffered emotional distress by having to subject themselves\nto an unnecessary training program for up to two years before being\npermitted to take union entrance exam and therefore damages award\nwas supported and appropriate). \n(Pls.’ Opp’n at 4 (citing Mar. 27, 2008 Mem. & Order at 11-12).)  Plaintiffs contend that “[b]y\nciting Robinson and Berger’s holding that emotional distress damages could be presumed when\nclass members were forced to endure racial discrimination, this Court effectively recognized that\ngeneral damages for emotional distress could be awarded on a class-wide basis.”  (Id.)  \n12\n\nThe Court’s citation to Robinson5 and it brief parenthetical description of Berger6 are not,\nplaintiffs’ protestations to the contrary, incompatible with the Court’s rejection of plaintiffs’\narguments.  The remainder of the passage from the March 27, 2008 Memorandum & Order,\npartially cited by plaintiffs, reads as follows:\nHere, class members were aggrieved by a single, admittedly unlawful\npolicy and there is a strong commonality between the strip search\nviolation and the harm.  There is no reason that a jury in this case,\nhearing the procedures used by Defendants for strip searches together\nwith  the  testimony  of  a  number  of  class  members  as  to  the\ncircumstances of actual searches, could not determine an amount of\ngeneral  damages  awardable  to  each  member  of  the  class. \n5 Robinson involved a motion for Rule 23(b)(2) class certification of a claim\n“seeking both injunctive relief and non-incidental monetary damages.”  267 F.3d at 164.  When\ndiscussing plaintiffs’ Title VII disparate impact claims, the Second Circuit stated that if the\nplaintiffs established a statutory violation, “the court may order prospective class-wide injunctive\nrelief.”  Id. at 161.  The Circuit continued: “Still, in order for an employee to obtain individual\nrelief (e.g., back or front pay), an inquiry similar to the remedial stage of a pattern-or-practice\ndisparate treatment claim is generally required.”  Id.  In its March 27, 2008 Memorandum &\nOrder, this Court cited to a footnote in Robinson in which the Second Circuit stated: “Both\nparties correctly note that some cases may require class-wide, rather than individualized\nassessments of monetary relief.”  Id. at 161 n.6 (collecting cases, none of which issued a class-\nwide award for emotional distress damages).  The Second Circuit further noted, however, “this is\nthe exception, not the rule: Where possible, ‘there should be . . . a determination on an individual\nbasis as to which class members are entitled to [recovery] and the amount of such recovery.”  Id.\n(quoting Shipes v. Trinity Indus., 987 F.2d 311, 318 (5th Cir. 1993)).\n6 In Berger, a class of African-American ironworkers brought a race discrimination\naction under § 1981 and Title VII against their local and international unions.  The trial court\nbifurcated liability and damages, and plaintiffs succeeded in proving liability at trial.  Berger,\n170 F.3d at 1116.  The case was then referred to a Special Master who held individual trials for\neach class member and then issued a report recommending, inter alia, compensatory damages\nawards to the 18 remaining class members who had not already settled with the defendants.  Id.\nat 1117, 1138.  The court found that “courts may properly infer emotional distress from factual\ncircumstances – and award damages to compensate for that distress – but may not presume\ndamages from a bare violation of a statutory or constitutional right.”  Id. at 1138.  The court then\nfound that the “awards in the instant case are supported by the proper kind of inference.”  Id. \nImportantly, those awards were rendered after individual trials held for each class member – not\non a class-wide basis.  See id. (noting the awards ranged from $2,500 to $25,000).\n13\n\nConcededly, care would have to be taken to ensure that the amount\nawarded  for  general  damages  excludes  all  elements  of  special\ndamages that individual class members might then pursue.  But the\ntask, albeit difficult, is doable.\n(Mar. 27, 2008 Mem. & Order at 12-13 (emphasis added).)  The Court has always considered\n“special damages” to include emotional distress damages beyond those that are inseparable from\nthe injury to human dignity, as well as more severe psychological damage, which might require\nexpert testimony to prove. \nPlaintiffs further contend that although “Defendants argue that emotional distress is a\nspecial damage, [ ] this is not correct in the context of an unconstitutional strip search.”  (Pls.’\nOpp’n at 6.)  Plaintiffs cite a line of cases, purportedly in which “courts have repeatedly\nrecognized that general damages are appropriately awarded in tort cases in which emotional\ndistress is a foreseeable harm of the wrongful act.”  (Id. (collecting cases).)  While, as a general\nproposition, that may be true, not one of the cases cited in plaintiffs’ legal memorandum involves\neither a class action or an unconstitutional strip search, and the cases are not otherwise instructive\nfor present purposes.  (See id. at 6-7.)    \nIII. Damages for Emotional Distress Beyond That Which is Inseparable From the Injury\nto Human Dignity Must be Proven by Each Individual Claiming Them and Cannot be\nAwarded to the Class as a Whole\nDefendants assert that “[t]he class should be decertified going forward now that the\ncommon general damages upon which the Court based class certification have been determined.” \n(Defs.’ Mem. at 2 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C) (“An order that grants . . . class certification\nmay be altered or amended before final judgment.”)).)  Plaintiffs oppose this request and contend\nthat decertification “is contrary to the purpose the class action mechanism, which aggregates\n14\n\nclaims so that it is as a practical matter reasonable to bring these claims for which the recovery is\nlikely to be modest.”  (Pls.’ Opp’n at 13.)  \nA. Class Certification was Never Extended to the Issue of Special Damages,\nIncluding Emotional Distress Damages Beyond Those Which are Inseparable\nFrom the Injury to Human Dignity  \nAs an initial matter, as defendants point out, the record of this Court’s written decisions\ndoes not establish that class certification extends to special damages.  (See Defs.’ Mem. at 2.)  In\nits March 27, 2008 Memorandum & Order, the Court noted in its conclusion that “Plaintiffs are\nnot asking this Court to select a particular damages model or to certify any subclasses for special\ndamages as to do so would be ‘premature.’  Thus, the Court has neither selected nor foreclosed\nany particular damages model; nor has it gone beyond determining that the predominancy of\ngeneral damages warrants extending class certification from solely liability to liability and\n[general] damages.”  (Mar. 27, 2008 Mem. & Order at 13-14 (emphasis added).)  Approximately\none year later, this Court noted that “consistent with the parties’ presentations, [it] has thus far\nonly addressed general damage class certification; at the conclusion of this phase of the\nproceeding, the court and the parties will discuss what further damage subclasses should be\ncertified, if any, and how the remainder of the case will be resolved.”  (Mar. 16, 2009 Mem. &\nOrder at 7 n.2 (emphasis added).)  \nAs is clear from the above-cited Memoranda & Orders, the Court has not extended class\ncertification beyond liability and general damages.  At this point, as discussed below, having\nestablished defendants’ liability and awarded general damages on a class-wide basis, and\ncognizant that the only claims remaining in this action are for class members’ emotional distress\nbeyond that which is inseparable from the injury to human dignity (or more severe psychological\n15\n\ninjuries), the Court finds that questions of law or fact common to the class no longer predominate\nover questions affecting only individual class members.       \nB. Emotional Distress Damages Beyond Those Which are Inseparable From the\nInjury to Human Dignity may not be Awarded on a Class-Wide Basis\nThe crux of plaintiffs’ argument is set forth in the following portion of plaintiffs’\nmemorandum in opposition to the pending motion:\nAlthough defendants cite to strip search cases in which the courts said\nthat  damages may need to  be, or should be, considered on an\nindividual basis per class member, those cases are properly viewed as\nthe decidedly minority view.  More recently than most of the cases\ncited by defendants, courts have had no difficulty certifying strip\nsearch class actions without any limitations regarding the damages. \n(Pls.’ Opp’n at 9 (internal citation omitted).)\nThe fundamental flaw in plaintiffs’ argument is their apparent equation of (1) courts’\nunwillingness to deny class certification when questions of fact common to the class predominate\nover individualized damages issue with (2) the notion that those courts have held that emotional\ndistress damages can be awarded on a class-wide basis.  The case law cited by plaintiffs,\nhowever, does not permit the Court to make the same inferential leap.  In many of the cases cited\nby plaintiffs, discussed infra, courts did indeed grant class certification motions despite the\npresence of individualized issues regarding damages.  In none of those cases, however, did courts\nhold – or even imply – that when they reached the damages phase of the proceedings they\nintended to award damages for class members’ emotional distress claims on a class-wide basis.  \nFor instance, plaintiffs rely heavily on McBean v. City of New York, 260 F.R.D. 120\n(S.D.N.Y. 2009) as an example of a court refusing to deny class certification despite “the\npresence of emotional distress damages claims.”  (Pls.’ Opp’n at 9.)  Plaintiffs are indeed correct\n16\n\nin this assessment.  In McBean, a putative class action was commenced against defendants for\n“federal civil rights violations arising from” defendants’ blanket strip search policy.  McBean,\n260 F.R.D. at 123.  The parties’ settlement negotiations “yielded a proposed settlement class that\ndiffered from the one suggested in plaintiffs’ amended complaint” in that it “specifically\nexcluded” a certain group of pre-trial detainees who were arraigned on narcotics- and weapons-\nrelated charges.  See id. at 125.  Intervenor-plaintiffs then sought to certify as a class those\nplaintiffs who were excluded from the settlement class.  Id. at 123-24.  After noting that “[o]n\noccasion, courts have declined to certify broad classes of individuals subject to blanket strip-\nsearch policies because of the role the particular circumstances of each search might play,\nwhether as to liability, class membership, or individual damages claims,” the court noted that\n“the availability of individual defenses as to liability is substantially limited because . . . the\ndefendants do not dispute that the searches at issue took place pursuant to a policy that required\nevery detainee to be searched irrespective of any particular factor . . . .”  Id. at 138.  Thus, “[t]he\npredominance of the central legal and factual issues common to all class members [ ] is in no\nway threatened by the possibility of hypothetical defenses.”  Id.  The court granted the motion,\nand certified the class under Rule 23(b)(3).  Id. at 138-39.  \nAfter a lengthy recitation of a portion of the court’s analysis in McBean, plaintiffs assert\nthat “defendants’ argument that legal precedent ‘strongly supports’ their argument that the\ngeneral emotional distress damages claims cannot be tried on a class action basis is simply\nwrong.”  (Pls.’ Opp’n at 10 (internal citation omitted).)  The Court does not believe that this\nconclusion logically flows from the holding in McBean.  Importantly, in that case, there was\nabsolutely no discussion by the court of the existence of class members’ emotional distress\n17\n\ndamages, or the manner in which the court intended to deal with class members’ claims for such\ndamages.  The focus of the court’s decision was on the limited availability of individual defenses\nto liability and the fact that “no evidentiary hearings will be required to determine class\nmembership in the first instance” – not the presence or absence of individual issues with respect\nto damages.  McBean 260 F.R.D. at 138.  The fact that the court in McBean granted class\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3) without discussing the impact of emotional distress claims does\nnot mean that the court held (or even contemplated) that an award of damages for emotional\ndistress was ultimately going to be made on a class-wide basis.7    \nPlaintiffs also cite numerous cases for the proposition that “[m]ost courts within this\nCircuit have certified stip search class actions without any limitation on the damages class, and\nwithout subsequent decertification.”  (Pls.’ Opp’n at 9.)  The Court has reviewed the docket\nsheets for each of the cited cases, however, and none of those cases ever arrived at the procedural\nposture faced by this Court, and thus never addressed the issue of individual damages.  In\nMitchell v. County of Clinton, 2007 WL 1988716 (N.D.N.Y. July 5, 2007), for example, the court\ngranted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and found that “[t]he questions of whether the\nalleged [blanket strip search] policy and practice existed, whether they were unconstitutional, and\nwhether defendants are liable are subject to generalized proof and are common to all potential\nclass members.”  Id. at *4.  The court further noted that “[a]n argument may be made that the\nclass should be certified only on the issue of liability, because the issue of damages is likely to\n7 According to the docket sheet in McBean v. City of New York, 02 CV 5426\n(S.D.N.Y.), a stipulation of settlement was submitted for court approval a few months after the\nAugust 2009 decision cited above, and that settlement was approved by the court by Order dated\nOctober 22, 2010.  \n18\n\ninvolve individualized evidence.”  Id. at *5.  The court then cited the Second Circuit’s statement\nthat various “management tools” are available to enable a district court to “address any\nindividualized damages issues that might arise in a class action,” including:\n(1) bifurcating liability and damages trials with the same or different\njuries; (2) appointing a magistrate judge or special master to preside\nover individual damages proceedings; (3) decertifying the class after\nthe liability trial and providing notice to class members concerning\nhow they may proceed to prove damages; (4) creating subclasses; or\n(5) altering or amending the class.\nId. (quoting In re Visa Check/Master Money Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 141 (2d Cir. 2001)). \nThe court concluded that because it “has the flexibility to deal with management issues as they\narise, . . . denial of certification regarding damages or other issues is not warranted.”  Id. \nAccording to the Northern District of New York docket sheet, however, the case subsequently\nsettled before liability was even determined.  Clearly, then, the Mitchell court never needed to\ndetermine how to “deal with management issues” regarding class members’ individual claims for\nemotional distress damages, and is of little assistance here.  \nLikewise, in Pritchard v. County of Erie, 269 F.R.D. 213, 219 (W.D.N.Y. 2010), the\ncourt granted plaintiffs’ Rule 23(b)(3) motion for certification, “concluding that the questions . . .\nregarding the existence of the alleged strip search policies . . ., the constitutionality of those\npractices and policies, and the ultimate liability of the County . . ., are common to all potential\nclass members and are subject to generalized, class-wide proof.”  The court did not discuss how\nit intended to handle any issues subject to “individualized proof,” see id., and a review of the\nWestern District of New York docket sheet shows that, as of the date of this Order, the case has\nyet to proceed to the trial phase.   \n19\n\nFinally, in Williams v. County of Niagra, 2008 WL 4501918, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 29,\n2008), the court granted a motion for class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) because the\nexistence of the alleged strip search policy, the question of the policy’s constitutionality, and the\ndefendants’ liability were “subject to generalized proof and are common to all potential class\nmembers.”  The court found, without any specific discussion about individual claims for\nemotional distress damages, that “[t]hese issues predominate over those issues that are subject to\nindividualized proof.”  Id.  As of the date of this Order, summary judgment motions on the issue\nof liability remained pending before the district court.\nThus, as is clear from the authorities cited above, plaintiffs are correct that several courts\nwithin this Circuit have certified Rule 23(b)(3) classes in strip search cases despite the presence\nof individualized issues regarding damages.  Indeed, in this case the Court certified the class\naction for liability purposes as well as general damages.  Ultimately, however, the Court does not\nfind that any of the cases cited by plaintiffs support their request for emotional distress damages\nto be awarded on a class-wide basis.  As described below, such claims require individualized\nproof that must be presented by each class member separately.\nC. Class Members’ Remaining Claims for Emotional Distress Damages Must be\nTried on an Individual Basis  \n1. The Relevant Case Law Does not Support a Class-Wide Award\nTo partially reiterate, plaintiffs do not cite any cases that directly deal with the issue now\nconfronting this Court:  liability has been established, general damages have been awarded on a\nclass-wide basis, and all that remains are individual class members’ claims for special damages. \n(See generally Pls.’ Opp’n at 11-12.)  As defendants have noted, however, in several cases within\n20\n\nthis Circuit trial courts have indicated that, should they reach this late stage of a strip search class\nlitigation, class members wishing to pursue claims for emotional distress damages would have to\nproceed on their own in individual hearings.  In particular, the Court finds two cases decided in\nthe Southern District of New York by Judge Colleen McMahon to be helpful on this point.  \nIn Dodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177 (S.D.N.Y. 2005), two “consolidated\nactions, brought as class actions, challenged the admissions procedures for newly-arrived inmates\nat the Orange County Correctional Facility.”8  Id. at 179.  Plaintiffs moved to certify a class\npursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) and defendants opposed, contending that the case “bristle[d]” with\n“individual issues.”  Id. at 182.  Judge McMahon found, however, that none of those individual\nissues went to defendants’ liability; rather, an issue common to the class was the existence of a\nblanket strip search policy.  See id. at 180.  When the court turned to damages, however, it found\nit “clear that individual issues predominate” since “not all arriving inmates will have suffered in\nthe same way or to the same extent.”  Id. at 182.  Ultimately, the court determined that “[b]ecause\ncommon questions predominate on the issues of liability but [ ] individualized issues underlie\nany award of damages to class members, I am bifurcating the liability and remedy phases of these\nactions and I certify classes only on the issue of liability . . . .”  Id. at 184.  The Dodge court made\nclear its intention that “the issue of damages, if it cannot be settled, will be litigated before a\njudge and a jury on a case-by-case basis, and [ ] different members of the class may receive\n8 “The Dodge plaintiffs [sought] to represent a class consisting of all persons\naccused of misdemeanors who were strip searched upon their initial arrival at OCCF from\nJanuary 31, 1999 through August 6, 2002.  The Rango plaintiffs [sought] to represent a class\nconsisting of all persons accused of felonies who were strip searched upon their arrival at OCCF\nduring the same period.”  Dodge, 226 F.R.D. at 179.  \n21\n\ndifferent amounts of damages as a result.”  Id. at 186.9  \nIn Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69, 71 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), plaintiffs\nchallenged a strip-search policy and moved for class certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   Judge\nMcMahon found that there was “a common issue at the core of this case – whether defendants\nmaintained an unconstitutional blanket strip search policy during the class period,” and although\n“in this case each plaintiff has a unique situation with relation to damages issues,” the court\nfound “it would be improper to let manageability concerns overwhelm the predominance\ndecision.”  Id. at 77-78.  Therefore, the court certified a class as to the issue of liability only and\nstated that if the class prevailed on liability “then individual plaintiffs can come forward to\nlitigate, in individual suits, the issue of whether their rights were violated and whether they\nsuffered damages.”  Id. at 79.10  \nAlthough Judge McMahon did not squarely address the issues currently faced by this\nCourt, her analyses in Dodge and Maneely are particularly helpful with respect to this Court’s\ndetermination of the appropriate manner in which to proceed now that it is faced solely with the\nquestion of whether and how to determine class members’ individual damages for emotional\ndistress beyond those which are inseparable from the injury to human dignity.  Plaintiffs note that\nthese cases “involve the views of one judge, Judge McMahon, who ruled in each of the cases and\nencouraged the minority view that emotional distress damages precluded damages class\n9 According to the docket sheet in Dodge v. County of Orange, 02 CV 769\n(S.D.N.Y.), the parties in both the Dodge and Rango actions reached settlement shortly after the\nclass certification decision was issued.  \n10 According to the docket sheet for Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 01 CV 2600\n(S.D.N.Y.), the case settled and was dismissed before any determination as to liability was made.\n22\n\ncertification.”  (Pls.’ Opp’n at 17.)  The Court does not find the fact that these decisions were\nboth issued by Judge McMahon to have much bearing, one way or another, on the assistance they\nprovide for present purposes.  The Court concludes, after reviewing each of these cases, that the\nrationale set forth therein is sound.  Moreover, plaintiffs base their claim that these cases espouse\nthe “minority view that emotional distress damages preclude[] class certification” solely on their\nreading of McBean.  (See id.)  As discussed above, however, that case does not ultimately\nsupport plaintiffs’ advocacy of a class-wide award for emotional distress damages.    \nSeveral district courts outside of our Circuit, in certifying classes of plaintiffs challenging\nthe constitutionality of various strip search policies, have also addressed the manner in which\nthey intend to deal with the individualized damages issues that may arise.  Importantly, while\neach of these cases stand for the proposition that the presence of such individualized damages\nissues will not preclude class certification, none of the courts involved unconditionally extended\ncertification of these classes to cover class members’ claims for individual damages.  In fact,\nmost courts put off the question, citing the various “management issues” at their disposal,\nincluding potential decertification.  See, e.g., Wilson v. Cnty. of Gloucester, 256 F.R.D. 479, 489\n& n.15 (D.N.J. 2009) (certifying Rule 23(b)(3) class challenging defendant’s strip search policy\nand rejecting defendant’s argument that because “thousands of damages mini-trials would be\nnecessary if Defendants are found liable[,] . . . individual damages issues would predominate”;\nnoting the existence of “a number of management tools available to a district court to address any\nindividualized damages issues”); Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Cnty of Burlington,\n2008 WL 800970, at *13 (D.N.J. Mar. 20, 2008) (certifying class of plaintiffs challenging\nconstitutionality of defendant’s strip search policy “notwithstanding the possibility that an\n23\n\nindividualized calculation of damages may be necessary,” and noting “several ways of dealing\nwith possible individualized damages issues” including “decertifying the class after the liability\ntrial and providing notice to class members concerning how they may proceed to prove\ndamages”); Johns v. DeLeonandis, 145 F.R.D. 480, 484-85 (N.D.Ill. 1992) (certifying Rule\n23(b)(3) class and subclass of plaintiffs seeking money damages for alleged constitutional\nviolations stemming from unlawful strip search; “[t]hough the members of the subclass may have\ndifferent damages due to the varying injury done to them during the strip search, the extent of\ndamages is not an issue at this stage of the proceeding”) (emphasis added).\n2. Class Members’ Remaining Claims for Emotional Distress Damages\nare Inherently Individualized and Must be Proven on a Case-by-Case\nBasis\nAs the Sixth Circuit has aptly stated, “[a]lthough many common issues of fact and law\nwill be capable of resolution on a group basis, individual particularized damages still must be\nproved on an individual basis.”  Sterling v. Velsicol Chem. Corp., 855 F.2d 1188, 1200 (6th Cir.\n1988) (noting that, in mass tort context, class action procedure allowed the court to determine the\ndefendants’ liability “without regard to the individual components of each plaintiff’s injuries,”\nbut ultimately, “it became the responsibility of each individual plaintiff to show that his or her\nspecific injuries or damages” were caused by the defendants’ conduct).  This is true both with\nrespect to establishing a causal link between defendants’ conduct and the alleged personal\nemotional distress injury, see id. at 1206 (“[D]amages for mental distress generally are not\nrecoverable where the connection between the anxiety and the existing injury is either too remote\nor tenuous.”), and proving the nature, extent, severity and duration of the alleged emotional\ndistress suffered by the individual class member, see In re Three Mile Island Litig., 87 F.R.D.\n24\n\n433, 441, 442 n.16 (M.D.Pa. 1980) (“[C]laims for emotional distress and resulting physical\ninjury are diverse and personal . . . [Additionally,] the idiosyncratic nature of emotional distress\nclaims makes them as unsuitable for class certification as the physical injury/emotional distress\nclaims discussed herein.”) \nAs noted by Judge McMahon in Dodge, the damages suffered by members of a class\nsubjected to unlawful strip searches are inherently individualized:\nEven if the plaintiff class members were strip searched illegally\npursuant to a uniform policy, not all arriving inmates will have\nsuffered in the same way or to the same extent.  Some may have\nsuffered physical damages as a result of a strip search.  Some may\nhave been severely psychologically damages.  Some, perhaps many,\nwill not have found the experience terribly degrading.\nDodge, 226 F.R.D. at 182-83.  The Court agrees with this assessment.  For example, a modest\ngrandmother who had never before been subjected to the undoubtedly humiliating experience of\nbeing forced to expose her naked body to a corrections officer during a strip search would likely\nhave suffered a more significant degree of emotional distress than a “repeat offender” who, as no\nstranger to the correctional system, may have been strip searched hundreds of times in the past\nand did not find the procedure or attendant exposure of various body parts to strangers to be\n“terribly degrading.”  See id.  \n3. Damages for any Remaining Claims for Emotional Distress Cannot be\nAwarded to the Class Pursuant to any Sampling Method\nDuring the October 1, 2010 status conference, the Court raised the possibility of\ndetermining individual special damages by using testimony and/or evidence taken from a\nrepresentative sample of class members who would “be selected by [a] methodology which has\nsome type of scientific acceptance.”  (See Tr. at 47.)  In response, as detailed below, plaintiffs\n25\n\nadvocate the use of some type of sampling method, but oppose random sampling or sampling\nbased on any other methodology that would produce a representative result from the statistical\nuniverse.  (Tr. at 34-35, 37.)  \na. Plaintiffs’ Proposal of a Presumptive Common Pain and Suffering\nAward for Each Class Member \nFirst, Plaintiffs assert that Langley v. Coughlin, 715 F. Supp. 522 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)\n“teaches that the Court clearly can (and we submit, should) determine garden-variety emotional\ndistress damages on a class basis in a phase 2 trial, and add that award to the general damages\naward, before any claim forms are distributed.”  (Pls.’ May 28, 2010 Letter at 6.)  According to\nplaintiffs, “[i]n determining the class’s garden variety emotional distress damages, the Court has\nwide discretion to fashion an award that, while imprecise, does substantial justice.”  (Id. at 7.) \nPlaintiffs assert that “based on [the testimony of] a sample of class members,” the Court can\nestablish “a presumptive common pain and suffering award for each class member ‘and then\npermit both plaintiffs and defendants to seek a variation – either up of down – for specific class\nmembers based upon a showing of unique individual circumstances.’”  (Id. at 6 (quoting\nLangley, 715 F. Supp. at 558).)  \nIn Langley, Judge Leonard B. Sand adopted a report and recommendation issued by\nMagistrate Judge Michael H. Dolinger and granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. \n715 F. Supp. at 530 (“[W]e are satisfied that plaintiffs would prevail on the class certification\nissue even if it were entirely their burden to sustain such certification de novo.”)  In that case, the\nplaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the conditions and practices in defendants’\ncorrectional facility.  In his report and recommendation, Judge Dolinger found there were\n26\n\n“‘questions of law or fact common to the class,’ and indeed to each of the subclasses” regarding\nthe plaintiffs’ “conditions-of-confinement claims” as well as their claims that the defendants\nfailed to properly treat inmates with serious mental ailments.  Id. at 555.  The defendants argued\nagainst class certification, asserting that “damages for conditions of confinement must be based\non the emotional or other injury to the individual as a result of the conditions, and that this\nnecessitates an individualized inmate-by-inmate inquiry concerning the extent of injury resulting\nfrom any given set of unconstitutional conditions.”  Id. at 557.  Judge Dolinger was not\npersuaded by this argument and reasoned that the “type of proof of the nature and severity of\nconditions [at the facility] over an extended period is obviously best done in a single\nproceeding.”  Id. at 558.  \nIn discussing the “task of damage determination,” Judge Dolinger stated that “it bears\nemphasis that courts have been perfectly willing, based simply on proof of objective conditions in\na prison, to award per diem damages to an inmate unconstitutionally confined.  There is no\nreason to conclude that a similar procedure cannot be used here based upon the Court’s class-\nwide findings that conditions [in the facility] for specified time periods (a) violated constitutional\nnorms and (b) were of such severity as to merit the inference that inmates confined on those\nparticular days were injured to an extent equivalent to a specific sum for each such day.”  Id. at\n558 (internal citations omitted, emphasis added).  The Court notes parenthetically that, at this\npoint, it has already awarded general damages in a similar manner; based on the objective\nevidence set forth regarding the strip search procedures conducted pursuant to defendants’\nblanket strip search policy, it has awarded $500 per strip search.  \nJudge Dolinger suggested an approach the trial court might employ to award damages: \n27\n\n“establishing a presumptive per diem award . . . and then permitting both plaintiffs and\ndefendants to seek a variation – either up or down – for specific class members based upon a\nshowing of unique individual circumstances.”  Id.  Judge Dolinger opined that few claimants\nwould seek a variation and that “in any event separate damage proceedings are not inconsistent\nwith class certification when the bulk of the issues, at least insofar as they concern liability, can\nbe addressed in a single joint proceeding.”  Id. at 558-59.  \nPlaintiffs emphasize the following passage from Langley:\nIt is true that such an approach involves a degree of inexactitude, but\nthat is entirely defensible.  Compensation for pain and suffering –\nwhether physical or emotional – inevitably involves  substantial\ninexactitude, and thus it is not surprising that the federal courts have\ncountenanced the use of arbitrary but  efficient across-the-board\nmeasures of such suffering, even in non-class cases.  See, e.g., Moore-\nMcCormack Lines, Inc. v. Richardson, 295 F.2d 583, 587 (2d Cir.\n1961), cert denied, 368 U.S. 989, 82 S.Ct. 606, 7 L.Ed.2d 526 (1962)\n(assessing  pain-and-suffering  damages  for  eleven  crewmen  of\ncapsized  ship  at  $150.00  per  hour  regardless  of  individual\ncircumstances and cause of death (if any), which varied from shark\nbit to exposure to drowning).  In class cases, the courts have found\nstill further justification for accepting some degree of imprecision in\ndamages awards, even for economic loss, if substantial justice is\ndone. \nId. at 558 (collecting cases).11  In the above-quoted passage, Judge Dolinger simply observed that\n“federal courts have countenanced the use of [arguably] arbitrary but efficient across-the-board\nmeasures” to award damages.  See id.  Overall, the Court does not find that the suggestions in\n11 The cases collected by Langley dealt with awards of backpay – not emotional\ndistress damages.  “[C]alculating the amount of backpay lost by members of the class because of\nthe employer’s discriminatory employment practices does not require individualized proof\nbecause the aggregate amount of backpay does not depend on the individual circumstances of any\nclass member.”  United States v. City of New York, 2011 WL 2680474 at *16 (E.D.N.Y. July 8,\n2011).  \n28\n\nJudge Dolinger’s report and recommendation to be persuasive as to the appropriateness of\nestablishing a presumptive common special damages award for each class member in this case. \nThe Court notes that plaintiffs have not cited any case, including Langley, that actually proceeded\nin the manner currently suggested by plaintiffs.  \nPlaintiffs also cited Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. Richardson, 295 F.2d 583 (2d Cir.\n1961) during the October 1, 2010 status conference, and stated that in that case “damages were\nfixed at $150 per hour of emotional distress damage, no matter what the circumstances were. \nThere was no random sampling in that case.  It was just done on that basis.”  (Tr. at 36.)  In\nMoore-McCormack, a non-class action case, the Second Circuit reviewed an appeal from the trial\ncourt’s award of damages for seven personal injury claims and four wrongful death claims\nstemming from the sinking of defendants’ vessel.  295 F.2d at 587.  As compensation for pain\nand suffering, the trial court awarded each claimant $300 for each hour that he was in the water\nbefore his rescue or death.  Id.  While ultimately reducing the hourly figure from $300 to $150,\nthe Second Circuit did not disturb the trial court’s decision to award an hourly rate for emotional\ndistress damages.  The dilemma facing the trial court in Moore-McCormack was that some of the\nclaimants died as a result of the ship’s sinking and so, obviously, the court did not have the\nbenefit of their individual testimony with respect to the pain and suffering they endured before\ntheir deaths.  Thus, the court used the individual testimony of each of the survivors to determine\na common award for pain and suffering for each hour between the time of the ship sank and the\ntime of each claimant’s demise or rescue.12  See id. (“We agree with the trial judge that there is\n12 The trial court noted that “although the time when each [of the deceased\nclaimants] was last seen alive is known with reasonable certainty,” there was no evidence in the\nrecord as to the exact time of their deaths.  In re Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 184 F. Supp.\n29\n\nno way of differentiating between the suffering of any deceased or survivor and [so] the award\nshould be assessed on the same basis as to all.”).   \nPlaintiffs assert that Moore-McCormack supports the proposition that the testimony of a\nsample of class members can be used to fashion a presumptive emotional distress damages award\nfor each class member, which may then be adjusted based on individual circumstances.  This\nassertion, however, is undercut by the profound factual distinctions between this case and Moore-\nMcCormack.  Moore-McCormack did not involve a class certified under Rule 23(b)(3) and the\nhourly rate for pre-death or pre-rescue pain and suffering was based not on the testimony of a\nsample of class members, but on the testimony of each surviving claimant.  Moreover, the court\nin Moore-McCormack made every effort to individualize each claimant’s award of emotional\ndistress damages.  For instance, the application of the common hourly award was individualized\nbased on the number of hours each claimant was in the water before his death or rescue. \nMoreover, when assessing pain and suffering awards to the survivors for the period that followed\ntheir rescue, the lower court did not employ the hourly rate but awarded each claimant a different\namount based upon his testimony.  See id. at 590, 591.  \nOverall, the Court does not find that Langley or Moore-McCormack support plaintiffs’\nproposal that a fixed emotional distress damages award be awarded to each class member “based\nupon the [non-randomly selected] sample of class members already selected by plaintiffs and\ndefendants.”  (See Pls.’ May 28, 2010 Letter at 8.) \n585, 590 (S.D.N.Y. 1960).  Accordingly, the trial court’s “estimate [of] the time of death . . . is\nthat each deceased died one hour after he was last seen alive . . . .”  Id.  \n30\n\nb. Plaintiffs’ Proposal of Non-Random Sampling\nPlaintiffs also suggested that the Court select a sample of class members by permitting\nboth plaintiffs and defendants to identify a certain number of class members that would be most\nfavorable to their respective positions, which would result in a “mix” of class members that\nwould purportedly be “representative of the whole.”  (Tr. at 38.)  Plaintiffs cite to the procedure\nemployed by the trial court in Young v. County of Cook, 06 CV 552 (N.D.Ill.), which is,\naccording to plaintiffs, “the only strip search class action case in which, to our knowledge,\ngarden-variety strip search damages have actually been tried.”  (Pls.’ May 28, 2010 Letter at 8.) \nPlaintiffs assert that in Young, “no random sampling method was used, plaintiffs were permitted\nto call whom they wished in three jury trials of eight class plaintiffs, subject to the proviso that if\na class member had testified at the liability trial, that class member should also testify in the\ndamages trial.”  (Id.)  The Court has reviewed the docket sheet for Young v. County of Cook, and\ndoes not agree with plaintiffs’ characterization of the procedures employed in that matter.\nIn Young, the court certified two classes under Rule 23(b)(3): “(1) all males who were\nsubjected to a strip search and/or a visual body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook\nCounty Jail on or after January 30, 2004 [Class I]; and (2) all persons charged only with\nmisdemeanor or lesser offenses not involving drugs or weapons who were subjected to a strip\nsearch and/or a visual body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook County Jail on or after\nJanuary 30, 2004 [Class II].”  (Mem. & Order, dated Apr. 25, 2007, Young Docket No. 92.)13 \n13 “Young Docket No. __” refers to docket entries on the electronic docket sheet for\nYoung v. County of Cook, 06 CV 552 (N.D.Ill.).  \n31\n\nSubsequently, the defendants14 moved for summary judgment and the plaintiffs cross-moved for\npartial summary judgment on the issue of liability.  (See Mem. & Order, dated Apr. 2, 2009,\nYoung Docket No. 298.)  These motions were each granted in part and denied in part; the court\ngranted “plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment with respect to the claims by the Class II\nmembers and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims of the Class I members for searches\nthat occurred prior to the installation of privacy screens . . . but otherwise denie[d] the motion.” \n(Id. at 38.)  A jury trial was held on the remaining liability issues and the jury returned a verdict\nin favor of plaintiffs and against defendants.  (See Minute Entry, dated Aug. 13, 2009,\nYoung Docket No. 426.)  \nThe plaintiffs then moved for the appointment of a special master to oversee discovery in\nthe “damages phase of the proceedings.”  (Pls.’ Mot. to Appoint Special Master at 1, dated Nov.\n16, 2009, Young Docket No. 493.)  The plaintiffs asserted that such discovery was necessary “to\nbegin the process needed to assess class-wide damages using statistical sampling – a process\nwhich could avoid the need for individual damages adjudications.”  (Id.)  The plaintiffs noted\nthat “[g]iven the enormous transaction costs to make individual damages determinations in a\nclass of over 400,000 claims, Plaintiffs believe that using statistics is the most sensible\napproach.”  (Id. at 1 n.1.)  The plaintiffs contended that a special master’s “oversight” was\nnecessary to enable the parties “to develop an acceptable statistical method,” otherwise the\nparties faced the “highly undesirable result” of “a class wide judgment for liability only, followed\nby the filing of from tens to hundreds of thousands of individual damages cases.”  (Id. at 2\n14 Cook County as well as Cook County Sheriff Michael Sheahan and Sheriff\nemployees (collectively, “Sheriff defendants”) were named as defendants in Young.  Cook\nCounty and the Sheriff defendants each moved separately for summary judgment. \n32\n\n(noting that special masters have “been used successfully in the class action context” and citing\nHilao v. Estate of Ferdinand Marcos, 103 F.3d 767 (9th Cir. 1996)).)\nAfter hearing the defendants’ objections, District Judge Matthew F. Kennelly denied the\nplaintiffs’ motion without prejudice and set a date for a jury trial – apparently, the first of several\nto be scheduled.  (See Minute Entry, dated Dec. 3, 2009, Young Docket No. 499.)  In a\nsubsequent order, Judge Kennelly clarified that the upcoming damages trials were not set “in\norder to ascertain the damages of the class.”  (Minute Entry, dated Dec. 11, 2009, Young Docket\nNo. 503.)  Rather, “the purpose of the damages trials is to decide the damages of the individual\nclass members whose damages will be tried, to facilitate the entry of a final judgment on less\nthan all claims under Rule 54(b).”  (Id. (emphasis added).)  To that end, the court directed the\nplaintiffs to “identify the plaintiffs whose damages cases will be tried,” and that such group\n“should include” the “named members of the classes or portions of classes in whose favor\nliability was determined via the summary judgment ruling,” as well as any class members who\ntestified during the liability trial.  (Id.)  After those damages cases were tried to verdict, the court\nentered judgment on those individual claims that were “severed from the claims of the remainder\nof the classes that have been certified in this case.”  (Minute Entry, dated July 16, 2010, Young\nDocket No. 606.)  The case subsequently settled, and an order was issued granting final approval\nof the class action settlement and final judgment on March 4, 2011.  (See Young Docket No.\n650.)\nBased on this extensive review of the procedures used by the Northern District of Illinois\ndistrict court in Young, the Court finds that Young does not support plaintiffs’ position that the\nCourt should “conduct phase 2 proceedings to fix classwide damages for garden variety\n33\n\nemotional distress . . . based on the sample of class members already selected by plaintiffs and\ndefendants.”  (Pls.’ May 28, 2010 Letter at 8.)  Indeed, that was not the method employed by the\ncourt in Young.  Rather, Judge Kennelly severed the claims of several individual class members\nfrom the rest of the class and tried their damages claims on an individual basis.15  Moreover, the\nCourt rejects plaintiffs’ request for non-statistical sampling as simply unsound: the Court cannot\nfathom how the parties’ hand-selection of ten or twenty individuals would produce testimony that\nis meaningfully representative or reflective of the experience of each individual member of a\n17,000 member class.16  \n15 The Court notes that this approach would appear to have the attendant benefit of\nfacilitating settlement, in that it would give each party an idea of the verdict amounts possible. \nShould both parties be interested in utilizing a similar approach with an aim at achieving\nsettlement of the entire matter, they should inform the Court within forty-five (45) days of the\ndate of this Order.  To determine the viability of that approach, counsel for the parties are\ndirected to meet and confer within fifteen days of the date of this Order to see if such an\napproach is likely to promote a settlement.  The initial contact for this purpose shall be made by\nAttorney Robert L. Herbst.\n16 The Court has considered sua sponte whether some type of statistically significant\nrandom sampling method could be utilized to determine emotional distress damages for\nindividual class members.  Such an approach does not appear viable.  The main support for such\nan approach would stem from the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Hilao v. Estate of Ferdinand\nMarcos, 103 F.3d 767, 771 (9th Cir. 1996), which involved a class action seeking damages based\nupon human rights abuses committed by the Philippine military.  In the compensatory damages\nphase of the litigation, a statistically significant sample of the 9,541 claims were randomly\nselected and information about the individual sample claims was used to determine\ncompensatory awards to the sub-classes of remaining class members.  See id. at 783.  The Ninth\nCircuit ultimately held the “district court’s methodology” was “unorthodox” but was “justified by\nthe extraordinarily unusual nature of this case.”  Id. at 786.  \nIn a strong dissent, Circuit Judge Rymer disagreed, emphasizing that “[e]ven in the\ncontext of a class action, individual causation and individual damages must still be proved\nindividually.”  Id.  Several courts have raised serious questions about the Ninth Circuit’s\nconclusions in Hilao, and have agreed instead with the sentiments expressed in Judge Rymer’s\ndissenting opinion.  See, e.g., Cimino v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 151 F.3d 297, 319 (5th Cir. 1998)\n(“Finally, we find ourselves in agreement with the thrust of the dissenting opinion [in Hilao].”);\nIn re Fireboard Corporation, 893 F.2d 706, 707 (5th Cir. 1990) (expressing a “profound\n34\n\n4. Despite Practical Litigation Concerns, Relevant Case Law Supports\nResolving Emotional Distress Claims on an Individual Basis\nThe Court’s research has uncovered a plethora of authority – in the context of mass tort\nlitigation, toxic tort litigation, and products liability actions – that supports its conclusion that\nclaims for class members’ emotional distress damages must be disposed of an individual basis. \n“Class certification decisions in mass tort cases offer additional guidance in analyzing the\npredominance of common questions over individual issues in a case in which class members\nhave suffered physical injuries,” Presbyterian Church of Sudan, 226 F.R.D. at 474, and the Court\nfinds those cases helpful here.  See, e.g., Mejdrech v. Met-Coil Sys Corp., 319 F.3d 910, 911 (7th\nCir. 2003) (“If there are genuinely common issues, issues identical across all the claimants,\nissues moreover the accuracy of the resolution of which is unlikely to be enhanced by repeated\nproceedings, then it makes good sense, especially when the class is large, to resolve those issues\nin one fell swoop while leaving the remaining, claimant-specific issues to individual follow-up\nproceedings.”) (emphasis added); Sterling, 855 F.2d at 1197 (affirming class certification in\nmass toxic tort case when “single major issue distinguishing the class members is the nature and\namount of damages,” but noting that “individual members of the class still will be required to\nsubmit evidence concerning their particularized damage claims in subsequent proceedings”);\nPresbyterian Church of Sudan, 226 F.R.D. at 485 (declining to certify class of plaintiffs alleging\nthey were victims of genocide and crimes against humanity when the “core question” of “whether\ndisquiet” with trial court’s approach in managing litigation of 3,031 asbestos cases, when only\n“certain representative cases” would be tried on the issues of liability and damages to a jury); The\nPresbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., 226 F.R.D. 456 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (“The\ndissent in Hilao was the better reasoned decision and identified the very problems that infect this\napplication for certification.”).  \n35\n\nthe suffering endured by each putative class member can be attributed to the defendants . . . is\nfundamentally an individual question.”); In re “Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 100 F.R.D.\n718, 724 (E.D.N.Y. 1983) (finding issues of “general” causation could be determined on a class-\nwide basis, while “specific” causation could be determined in subsequent individual trials), aff’d,\n818 F.2d 145 (2d Cir. 1987); In re Three Mile Island Litig., 87 F.R.D. 433, 441-42 (M.D.Pa.\n1980) (declining to certify class claiming damages for “emotional distress and resulting physical\ninjury” following nuclear reactor incident because “damages will have to be assessed on a\nplaintiff-by-plaintiff basis, so too will the causes of the injuries alleged”). \nIn Watson v. Shell Oil Company, 979 F.2d 1014 (5th Cir. 1992), for example, the Fifth\nCircuit affirmed certification of a class of 18,000 plaintiffs suing defendants in connection with\nan explosion at an oil refinery which caused “extensive damages both on the plant and in the\nsurrounding communities.”  Id. at 1016-17.  The Circuit also affirmed the trial plan, which called\nfor trial to proceed in four phases, with a jury to determine “common issues of liability” in phase\none.  Id. at 1018.  Of particular relevance here is phase three, which called for a different jury to\n“resolve issues unique to each plaintiff’s compensatory damage claims, e.g. injury, causation, and\nquantum.”  Id.  Phase three “call[ed] for trials in waves of five” and the trial court anticipated\nthat several waves of trials would result in a “reasonable judgment value for each category of\nclaims” that would “facilitate settlement.”  Id. at 1018.  The Circuit affirmed this trial plan, with\nthe proviso that the phase three trials could not proceed in a manner that “altered or diminished”\nfederal rules of evidence or procedure.  Id.  \nPlaintiffs argue that any failure to certify class members for the purpose of seeking\nspecial damages is simply impractical: “If the class were decertified, and only several hundred\n36\n\nrather than a few thousand class members brought their emotional distress claims to Your Honor\nfor trial as related cases, what else would this Court be available to do for the next 11 years?” \n(Pls.’ Opp’n at 14.)  Plaintiffs’ concern, while not ill-founded, is also not new – countless courts\nfaced with the task of determining individual damages claims in the context of complex mass\nlitigation scenarios have faced similar dilemmas.  The Fifth Circuit, in recognizing the strain that\nasbestos mass litigation placed on the federal courts, made the following comments:\nWe are told that Phase II [involving trying a sample of individual\nclaims and then extrapolating a class-wide compensatory damages\naward] is the only realistic  way of trying these cases; that the\ndifficulties faced by the courts as well as the rights of the class\nmembers to have their cases tried cry powerfully for innovation and\njudicial creativity.  The arguments are compelling, but they are better\naddressed to the representative branches – Congress and the State\nLegislature.  The Judicial Branch can offer the trial of lawsuits.  It has\nno power or competence to do more.  We are persuaded on reflection\nthat the procedures here called for comprise something other than a\ntrial within our authority. \nIn re Fireboard, 893 F.2d at 712; see also Watson, 979 F.2d at 1018 (noting that the litigation,\n“involving claims by more than 18,000 plaintiffs, starkly presents the nearly insurmountable\nproblems of balancing procedural fairness with judicial efficiency in the management of mass\ntort litigation”).  \nThe Court has carefully considered the direction this case must take, largely unaided by\nany case law or other legal authority directly on point – a testament to the fact that we are\ntraversing largely uncharted waters.  On the one hand, the Court could exercise its discretion to\nhold (or appoint one or more Special Masters to hold) a series of “mini-trials” to determine the\nemotional distress damages suffered by each individual strip search victim.  This would arguably\nbenefit those individuals by permitting them to litigate their special  damages claims without\n37\n\nhaving to pay a filing fee to commence their own action in federal court, and would protect the\nDistrict from a potential inundation of individual claims.  On the other hand, the Court is\ndoubtful that the process of holding potentially hundreds if not thousands of mini-trials, or\nappointing one or more Special Masters to do so, would be any more efficient than requiring\nformer class members to commence their own individual actions should they elect to pursue\nclaims for special damages.17  Indeed, any strip search victim seeking special damages would\nhave the benefit of a finding of liability on the part of the County and would need only present\nevidence as to their emotional distress damages.  Plaintiffs’ counsel has represented that the\nmajority of these individuals suffered only from what plaintiffs refer to as “garden-variety”\nemotional distress, for which expert testimony is generally not necessary to establish.  \nIV. Remaining Issues\nThere remain a number of “loose ends” that must be resolved before a final judgment can\nbe entered.  This Memorandum & Order contains the Court’s decision, as set forth at length\nabove, that it will not extend class certification to permit plaintiffs to pursue a class-wide award\nto compensate for what plaintiffs refer to as “garden-variety” emotional distress damages.  The\nremainder of this Memorandum & Order delineates the manner in which the Court intends to\nproceed.  Any objections to the following must be submitted to the Court, in writing, within\nforty-five (45) days of the date of this Order.  Additionally, the parties are directed to bring to the\nCourt’s attention any issues that, in their view, remain unresolved, in writing, within forty-five\n17 Plaintiffs have consistently referred to special damages as encompassing claims\nfor varying levels of emotional distress damages.  While the Court recognizes that special\ndamages could potentially include those outside the realm of emotional distress damages,\nplaintiffs have never raised such claims. \n38\n\n(45) days of the date of this Order.18\nA. Distribution of General Damages Award\nThe Court has reviewed the parties’ briefing regarding the “cy pres” issue.  (See Docket\nNos. 374, 380, 381.)  As an initial matter, the Court must determine the amount that the\ndefendants will be required to allocate into a fund to distribute to class members as compensation\nfor their general damages.  Defendants submit that the Court has “two options” in this regard. \nFirst, the Court could “allow a reasonably liberal claims period for the Class Administrator to\nlocate and solicit all potential claimants, and then enter a general damages judgment for the\nnumber of qualifying strip searches actually claimed times the $500 per search dignity damages\naward.”  (Defs.’ Reply at 6.)  In connection with this option, defendants have offered to\nundertake an obligation to “pay in perpetuity any valid future claims.”  (Defs.’ Mem. at 7 n.2\n(citing Van Gemert v. Boeing Co., 739 F.3d 730, 731, 733 (2d Cir. 1984)).)  \nSecond, defendants assert that the Court could “enter an aggregate judgment of\napproximately $11.5 million based upon the total number of eligible searches time $500, with the\nunclaimed portion of this judgment reverting to the County at the end of the claims period.” \n(Defs.’ Reply at 6.)  Plaintiffs endorse defendants’ proposed second approach (i.e., entering an\n“aggregate class judgment” in the amount “fixed by multiplying the number of qualifying strip\nsearches by $500”) with an important distinction: “any unclaimed funds [would] be distributed\n18 In the most recent round of briefing, counsel referred the Court to arguments made\nas part of prior written submissions.  In future written submissions, the parties may not simply\nincorporate past arguments by reference, but must restate those arguments so as to properly focus\nthe Court on the legal points they wish to make.\n39\n\npro rata to those class members making claims.” (Pls. Opp’n at 3.)19 \nThe Court will adopt defendants’ second proposal, i.e., a judgment will be entered against\ndefendants in an aggregate amount based upon the total number of eligible searches performed,\nmultiplied by $500.  The Court has further determined, contrary to plaintiffs’ request, that – no\nmatter the amount of money that defendants are required to advance into a fund for distribution\nof general damages – any unclaimed funds will revert back to defendants.  The Court declines to\nadopt plaintiffs’ suggestion to distribute unclaimed funds to those individuals who make claims;\nsuch a procedure would result in those class members receiving a windfall from the public fisc\nand is inconsistent with the general legal tenant that compensatory damages should do no more\nthan compensate a victim for their injury.  Accord 3 Alba Conte & Herbert Newberg, Newberg\non Class Actions § 10:5 n.3 (4th ed. 2002) (“[I]t is now clear that the Second Circuit condemns\nfluid recovery which is defined as a distribution of an aggregate class recovery or an unclaimed\nportion thereof under cy pres principles to the next best class of persons.”) (citing Eisen v.\nCarlisle & Jacquelin, 479 F.3d 1005 (2d Cir. 1973), cert granted, 414 U.S. 908 (1973), judgment\nvacated on other grounds, 417 U.S. 156 (1974)).   \nB. Notice and Claims Forms \nThe Court finds that each member of the class is entitled to notice of: (1) the finding of\nliability against the defendants, (2) the general damages award previously rendered in the amount\nof $500 per strip search, (3) the Court’s decision not to continue class certification so as to permit\nspecial damages to be decided on a classwide basis, and (4) the right of each class member to\n19 Interestingly, should the Court adopt plaintiffs’ “modest proposal,” “plaintiffs\nwould agree to forego any further trial(s) or proceedings with respect to emotional damages and\nend the case now.”  (Pls.’ Opp’n at 3.)  \n40\n\ncommence an individual action seeking damages for his or her emotional distress – whether it be\nemotional distress beyond that which is inseparable from the injury to human dignity or other\nitems of special damages, including more severe emotional distress.  Plaintiffs’ counsel is\ndirected to prepare such notice and submit it for the Court’s approval within forty-five (45) days\nof the date of this Order.  The notice shall include specific instructions as to how class members\ncan file a claim for general damages (i.e., $500 per strip search).  The notice should also include\ninformation as to the statute of limitations for individual actions for emotional distress damages. \nBecause today’s Memorandum & Order is not a “final decision” with respect to these issues, the\nCourt does not believe that the statute of limitations will begin to run until a final order\n(embodying all of the “loose ends” discussed herein) is entered.20  Finally, the notice should\naddress the length of the claims period remaining to those former class members seeking to\npursue special damages.  \nIn addition, class counsel is directed to prepare a proposed Claim Form which will inform \neach member of the class about the general damages award, and will inform them that they will\nhave a full and fair opportunity to submit a claim for such an award.  In addition, to partially\nreiterate, the Claim Form must also fairly, accurately, and reasonably inform each member of the\nclass of the expiration date for the claims period and strongly encourage them to file their claims\n20 See Crown, Cork & Seal Co., Inc., 462 U.S. 345, 353-54 (1983) (“We conclude   \n. . . that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to\nall asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to\ncontinue as a class action.  Once the statute of limitations has been tolled, it remains tolled for all\nmembers of the putative class until class certification is denied.  At that point, class members\nmay choose to file their own suits or to intervene as plaintiffs in the pending action.”) (internal\ncitations and quotation marks omitted); see also Defs.’ Mem. at 12 n.5 (citing 5 Moore’s Fed.\nPractice – Civil § 23.65[1][a]).\n41\n\nin a timely manner. \nC. Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest\n1. Pre-Judgment Interest\nPlaintiffs contend that they are entitled to pre-judgment interest on their award.  (Pls.’\nNov. 19, 2010 Letter at 1.)21  Although Section 1983 does not explicitly provide for pre-judgment\ninterest, “[i]n a suit to enforce a federal right, the question of whether or not to award\nprejudgment interest is ordinarily left to the discretion of the district court.”  Gierlinger v.\nGleason, 160 F.3d 858, 873 (2d Cir. 1998).  In exercising such discretion, the Court should\nconsider: “(i) the need to fully compensate the wronged party for actual damages suffered, (ii)\nconsiderations of fairness and the relative equities of the award, (iii) the remedial purpose of the\nstatute involved, and/or (iv) such other general principles as are deemed relevant by the court.” \nId.  Additionally, “[t]he speculative nature of the damages in question will always be relevant to\na sound decision on a consideration of whether prejudgment interest should be awarded.” \nWickham Contracting Co., Inc. v. Local Union No. 3, Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, AFL-CIO, 955\nF.2d 831, 836 (2d Cir. 1992).  “The Court must also bear in mind that ‘[t]he underlying purpose\nof prejudgment interest . . . is the need to fully compensate the wronged party for the actual\ndamages suffered, i.e., to make him whole.’” Sulkowska v. City of New York, 170 F. Supp. 2d\n359 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (quoting Thomas v. City of Mt. Vernon, 1992 WL 84560, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nApr. 10, 1992)) (alterations in the original).  \n21 Plaintiffs assert that the “class plaintiffs” are entitled to pre-judgment interest\nrunning “from the date of the strip search, or, alternatively, the entire class is entitled to pre-\njudgment interest from some middle ground date during the class period (e.g., December 1,\n1997), until the entry of judgment, at the New York State statutory rate of nine percent per year.” \n(Pls.’ Nov. 19, 2010 Letter at 1.)  \n42\n\nApplying this legal framework, courts within this Circuit routinely allow recovery of pre-\njudgment interest on awards of back pay and lost wages.  See, e.g., Gierlinger, 160 F.3d at 873\n(“To the extent, however, that the damages awarded to the plaintiff represent compensation for\nlost wages, ‘it is ordinarily an abuse of discretion not to include pre-judgment interest.’”)\n(quoting Salpaugh v. Monroe Cmty. Hosp., 4 F.3d 134, 145 (2d Cir. 1993)) (emphasis in the\noriginal); Mohan v. La Rue Distribs., Inc., 2008 WL 4822266, at **2-3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 27, 2008)\n(finding that pre-judgment interest “is mandatory” with respect to jury’s award for lost wages and\nfringe benefits).  Contrary to plaintiffs’ assertions, however, courts generally decline to permit\nrecovery of pre-judgment interest on Section 1983 compensatory damages awards that are “based\nexclusively on the emotional injuries that [the] plaintiff sustained” as a result of the\nconstitutional violation.  Sulkowska, 170 F. Supp. 2d at 371 (internal quotation marks omitted,\nalteration added) (declining to permit recovery of pre-judgment interest on compensatory\ndamages award based upon plaintiff’s Section 1983 claims for false arrest, assault and battery,\nand malicious prosecution); see also McDow v. Rosado, 2009 WL 3103778, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nSept. 29, 2009) (amending judgment and striking pre-judgment interest on award that “was\napproximate in nature . . . and fully compensated plaintiff for his mental suffering related to false\narrest and excessive force”); Gonzalez v. Bratton, 147 F. Supp. 2d 180, 214 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)\n(finding plaintiff not entitled to pre-judgment interest on award for emotional pain and suffering\nas a result of, inter alia, unlawful strip search).  \nHere, there has been no claim that plaintiffs suffered any economic injuries, such as lost\nwages, or any other form of monetary deprivation as a result of the unlawful strip searches.  See\nSulkowska, 170 F. Supp. 2d at 371.  In addition, as the extensive analysis performed by the Court\n43\n\nin connection with its September 22, 2010 award of general damages makes clear, the amount of\ndamages attributable to plaintiffs’ injuries “[were] not ascertainable with any precision either at\nthe time of the wrongdoing or at the time of trial.”  See id.  In selecting $500 per strip search as\nthe general damages award the Court “intended to fully compensate” plaintiffs for their injuries\nand, “[u]nder such circumstances, an award of prejudgment interest would not be compensatory,\nbut punitive, which is an improper purpose.”  See id. at 371-72.22  \nAccordingly, plaintiffs’ request for recovery of pre-judgment interest is denied.\n2. Post-Judgment Interest\nPlaintiffs contend that they are entitled to an award of post-judgment interest “at the rate\nof nine percent per year, from the entry of judgment until such time as defendants pay the\njudgment.”  (Pls.’ Nov. 19, 2010 Letter at 1.)  Plaintiffs further assert that they are entitled to a\nsecond, separate but “non-duplicative” award of post-judgment interest “at the rate of nine\npercent per year, from the date of defendants’ concession of liability (September 23, 2003)\nthrough the payment of judgment, or at least from the entry of judgment of liability (January 12,\n2007) through the payment of judgment.”  (Id.)  \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961(a): “Interest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a\ncivil case recovered in a district court.”  28 U.S.C. § 1961(a).  Plaintiffs contend that “it is in the\njudge’s discretion to determine the appropriate rate of interest to apply, [and] judges generally\n22 Plaintiffs assert that in Green v. Torres, 98 CV 8700, a “federal civil rights action\nagainst a municipality with both federal constitutional and state law claims as here,” following a\njury verdict and award of $58,508 to plaintiff, Judge Rakoff “supplemented the jury’s award . . .\nwith $12,594.44 in pre-judgment interest . . . .”  (Pls.’ Nov. 19, 2010 Letter at 2.)  Plaintiffs,\nhowever, have failed to furnish a copy of that judgment or otherwise demonstrate that the\nplaintiff in Green was permitted to recover pre-judgment interest on an award for exclusively\nemotional distress damages, as opposed to an award of back pay or lost wages.  \n44\n\nlook to state law for guidance in this regard.”  (Pls.’ Nov. 19, 2010 Letter at 2 (citing N.Y.\nC.P.L.R. § 5004 and N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law § 3-a (prescribing 9 percent as interest rate to be paid\non judgments against municipal corporations)).)  Plaintiffs assertions to the contrary, however,\nthe plain language of Section 1961(a) sets forth the applicable rate for post-judgment interest as:\n“a rate equal to the weekly average 1-year constant maturity Treasury yield, as published by the\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the calendar week preceding the date of\nthe judgment.”  28 U.S.C. § 1961(a).  The cases cited by plaintiffs, which largely discuss rates for\nawards of pre-judgment interest, do not require a different result.  (See Pls.’ Nov. 19, 2010 Letter\nat 2 (citing Velez v. Puerto Rico Marine Mgmt., Inc., 957 F.2d 933, 941 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting\nthat Section 1961 “provides a rate for post-judgment interest but is silent as to pre-judgment\ninterest,” and finding it appropriate to look to “state law in setting the pre-judgment interest\nrate”); Hansen v. Cont’l Ins. Co., 940 F.2d 971, 983-85 (5th Cir. 1991) (discussing appropriate\nrate of pre-judgment interest); Green v. Torres, 290 F. Supp. 2d 427, 431 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)\n(calculating post-judgment interest on attorneys’ fees award)).)  Accordingly, any post-judgment\ninterest award will be at the rate prescribed in 28 U.S.C. § 1961(a).  \nFurthermore, Section 1961(a) also makes clear that post-judgment interest begins to run\n“from the date of the entry of judgment.”  28 U.S.C. § 1961(a).  The Second Circuit has\nconsistently held that post-judgment interest does not run from the date of a party’s concession of\nliability or a jury’s verdict and finding of liability.  See, e.g., New England Ins. Co. v. Healthcare\nUnderwriters Mut. Ins. Co., 352 F.3d 599, 605 (2d Cir. 2003) (finding that Section 1961(a)\n“requires the starting date for the calculation of federal interest to be the date of entry of the\nJMOL, not the date of the jury verdict or the date the court imagines the jury verdict would have\n45\n\nbeen entered but for the delay caused by the defendant’s motion for JMOL”); Magee v. United\nStates Lines, Inc., 976 F.2d 821, 823-24 (2d Cir. 1992) (concluding that “postjudgment interest\nproperly runs from the date of the entry of judgment,” and disapproving of district court’s\n“device of creating a make-believe date of entry whose sole purpose was to avoid the clear intent\nof section 1961”); Brady v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 2010 WL 4392566, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 29,\n2010); see also Andrulonis v. United States, 26 F.3d 1224, 1230 (2d Cir. 1994) (“Postjudgment\ninterest is designed to compensate the plaintiff for the delay it suffers from the time damages are\nreduced to an enforceable judgment to the time the defendant pays the judgment.”)\nThus, plaintiffs will be awarded post-judgment interest at a rate to be calculated pursuant\nto the explicit terms of Section 1961, running from the date of the entry of judgment.\nD. “Book and Bail”\nThe most recent correspondence the Court received regarding the “book and bail” issue is\ndated November 2010.  The parties are directed to update the Court, within forty-five (45) days\nof the date of this Order regarding the status of this issue.\nE. Counsel Fees\nBy Order dated October 8, 2010, plaintiffs were granted leave to file an application for an\ninterim fee award but never did so and, therefore, the issue of attorneys’ fees is not currently ripe. \nThe Court, however, finds it prudent to inform the parties as to its preliminary inclination on the\nsubject prior to receiving the benefit of briefing from counsel, although the Court remains open\nto the parties’ input.  To the extent the total amount of general damages awarded by the Court is\ngermane to the calculation of attorneys’ fees, the Court intends to consider the entire amount\nawarded (i.e., $500 multiplied by the entire number of strip searches that occurred), not just the\n46\n\nportion of the amount that is claimed.  Once the “book and bail” issue is decided, the Court can\ndetermine the entire amount to be awarded, and judgement will be entered.  Thereafter, the case\nwill remain open pending a determination of attorneys’ fees. \n  \nSO ORDERED.\nDated:    Central Islip, New York\n   October 19, 2011 \n /s/                                       \nDenis R.

VAN DER WAAG for Carnell T. \nFoskey, Nassau County Attorney, \nMineola, NY. \n \n  Appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New \nYork (Denis R. Hurley, Judge). \nUPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, \nADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED. \nPlaintiffs are a class of persons “arrested on misdemeanor charges unrelated to weapons or \ndrugs and thereafter strip searched, without individualized suspicion,” at the Nassau County \nCorrectional Center (the “NCCC”), in accordance with a “blanket policy” in effect at NCCC prior \nto 1999. See In re Nassau Cty. Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 222–23 (2d Cir. 2006). In Shain v. \nEllison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), a district court in the Eastern District of New York \nheld that this policy violated clearly established Fourth Amendment law. We affirmed, explaining \n“that persons charged with a misdemeanor and remanded to a local correctional facility like NCCC \nhave a right to be free of a strip search absent reasonable suspicion that they are carrying contraband \nor weapons.” See Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 66 (2d Cir. 2001). \nIn the wake of Shain, plaintiffs brought the instant action, in which they alleged that their \nstrip searches violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to \nthe United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 12 of the New York State Constitution. See In \nre Nassau Cty. Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at 222. In response to a class-certification motion that \nplaintiffs filed in 2003, defendants “conceded the one common issue that in their view might be \nappropriate for class certification[—]namely, whether the NCCC’s strip search policy during the \nclass period was constitutional. Specifically, defendants recognized that they are bound by Shain \nunder the doctrine of collateral estoppel.” Id. at 224 (alterations and internal quotation marks \nomitted). The District Court thereafter certified a class as to liability, and—“in light of defendants’ \nconcession of liability to all class members”—“entered summary judgment on liability for all strip \nsearches upon admission to the NCCC” with respect to plaintiffs’ federal and state claims. In re \n2 \n \n\nCase 14-1388, Document 165-1, 02/26/2016, 1713549, Page3 of 6\n \nNassau Cty. Strip Search Cases, 958 F. Supp. 2d 339, 341 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (alteration and internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nAlmost five-and-a-half years after the District Court entered judgment, however, the \nSupreme Court decided Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, 132 S. Ct. 1510 \n(2012), in which it considered “whether undoubted security imperatives involved in jail supervision \noverride the assertion that some detainees must be exempt from [strip searches] absent reasonable \nsuspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.” Id. at 1518. The Court answered that \nquestion in the negative. See id. at 1523 (holding that the challenged search procedures “struck a \nreasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of the institutions”). \nFollowing the Court’s decision in Florence, defendants “assert[ed] that . . . Florence represents \nan intervening change of controlling law that should lead the [District] Court to vacate its prior \norder granting summary judgment for plaintiffs on the issue of liability and to instead enter summary \njudgment for defendants dismissing the case.” In re Nassau Cty. Strip Search Cases, 958 F. Supp. 2d at \n342 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). In support of this argument, defendants cited \nRule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which grants “a district court . . . authority to \nrevise an interlocutory order . . . at any time before the entry of final judgment,” Bergerson v. N.Y. \nState Office of Mental Health, Cent. N.Y. Psychiatric Ctr., 652 F.3d 277, 288 (2d Cir. 2011), for “cogent \nand compelling reasons such as an intervening change of controlling law,” Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe’s \nBorough Coffee, Inc., 736 F.3d 198, 208 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIn a thorough and well-reasoned decision, the District Court found that Florence represented \nan intervening change of controlling law with respect to plaintiffs’ federal-law claims, but not with \nrespect to plaintiffs’ state-law claims. See In re Nassau Cty. Strip Search Cases, 958 F. Supp. 2d at 354. \nWe agree. \nTurning first to the state-law question, the dispositive word from the Rule 54(b) framework \ndescribed above is “controlling.” We fail to see how Florence—in which the United States Supreme \nCourt interpreted the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution—could possibly control \nthe meaning of Article I, Section 12 of the New York State Constitution. Indeed, we fail to see how a \nSupreme Court decision interpreting any federal constitutional provision could ever control the \nmeaning of an analogous state constitutional provision, at least absent extraordinary circumstances \nnot presented here. See California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35, 43 (1988) (“Individual States may surely \nconstrue their own constitutions as imposing more stringent constraints on police conduct than \ndoes the Federal Constitution.”); McGrath v. Toys “R” Us, Inc., 356 F.3d 246, 250 (2d Cir. 2004) \n(“State courts are not bound to interpret state laws in accordance with federal court interpretations \nof analogous federal statutes . . . .”); People v. Harris, 570 N.E.2d 1051, 1053 (N.Y. 1991) (“Our \nfederalist system of government necessarily provides a double source of protection and State courts, \nwhen asked to do so, are bound to apply their own Constitutions notwithstanding the holdings of \nthe United States Supreme Court.” (citation omitted)). \n3 \n \n\nCase 14-1388, Document 165-1, 02/26/2016, 1713549, Page4 of 6\n \nSuch circumstances might include, for example, a ruling by a state’s highest court that state \ncourts interpreting a particular state constitutional provision were bound by the Supreme Court’s \ninterpretation of an analogous federal constitutional provision. As the District Court in this case \ncorrectly observed, however, the New York Court of Appeals has not so ruled. To the contrary, “on \nmany occasions[, it has] interpreted [the New York State] Constitution to provide greater \nprotections when circumstances warrant and ha[s] developed an independent body of state law in \nthe area of search and seizure,” especially “when doing so promotes predictability and precision in \njudicial review of search and seizure cases and the protection of the individual rights of [New York \nState’s] citizens.” People v. Weaver, 909 N.E.2d 1195, 1202 (N.Y. 2009) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nTurning next to the federal-law question, we begin by noting that the questions presented in \nShain and Florence were virtually identical. Compare Shain, 273 F.3d at 59 (“This appeal requires us to \ndetermine whether it [is] clearly established . . . that corrections officers in a local correctional facility \n[cannot] perform a strip search including a non-intrusive examination of body cavities on an \nindividual arraigned on misdemeanor charges unless the officers had reasonable suspicion that the \nindividual possessed contraband or weapons.”), with Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1518 (“The question here \nis whether undoubted security imperatives involved in jail supervision override the assertion that \nsome detainees must be exempt from the more invasive search procedures at issue absent \nreasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.”). The fact that the Supreme \nCourt reached a conclusion opposite to ours in response to that question demonstrates in and of \nitself that Florence represents an intervening change of controlling law with respect to plaintiffs’ \nfederal-law claims. Cf. Gonzalez v. City of Schenectady, 728 F.3d 149, 161 (2d Cir. 2013) (“Shain is likely \nno longer good law in light of Florence . . . .”). But certain of Florence’s features also buttress our \ndetermination in this regard. \nFor example, in describing the circuit split that led to its grant of certiorari, the Supreme \nCourt observed that “[s]ome Federal Courts of Appeals have held that corrections officials may not \nconduct a strip search of” “offenders suspected of committing minor offenses” “absent reasonable \nsuspicion of concealed contraband”—the position that the Court ultimately rejected—but that \n“[t]he Courts of Appeals to address this issue in the last decade . . . have come to the opposite \nconclusion”—the position that the Court ultimately adopted. Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1518. For a \ndescription of the former category of cases, the Supreme Court cited the Third Circuit decision on \nreview, which itself cited Shain as an example of the position it was rejecting. See id. (citing Florence v. \nBd. of Chosen Freeholders of City of Burlington, 621 F.3d 296, 303–04 & n.4 (3d Cir. 2010)). This provides \nfurther evidence that Florence abrogated Shain. \nPlaintiffs attempt to distinguish the present case on the ground that “Florence’s \nholding . . . was narrowly tailored to apply only to those who are committed to the general \npopulation of a jail.” Pls.’ Br. 18. They argue that Florence is inapplicable here because “[t]here was a \n4 \n \n\nCase 14-1388, Document 165-1, 02/26/2016, 1713549, Page5 of 6\n \nclear distinction between most of the Jail, in which the general population inmates were housed, and \nthe separate new admit housing facilities, where all new admits were housed specifically to isolate \nthem from the general inmate population.” Id. at 17. But as the following passage from Florence \ndemonstrates, plaintiffs’ interpretation of the Supreme Court’s use of the phrase “general \npopulation” is untenable: \nThis case does not require the Court to rule on the types of searches that would be \nreasonable  in  instances  where,  for  example,  a  detainee  will  be  held  without \nassignment to the general jail population and without substantial contact with other \ndetainees. This describes the circumstances in Atwater. See 532 U.S., at 324, 121 S. \nCt. 1536 (“Officers took Atwater’s ‘mug shot’ and placed her, alone, in a jail cell for \nabout one hour, after which she was taken before a magistrate and released on $310 \nbond”). The accommodations provided in these situations may diminish the need to \nconduct some aspects of the searches at issue. Cf. United States Brief 30 (discussing \nthe segregation, and less invasive searches, of individuals held by the Federal Bureau \nof Prisons for misdemeanors or civil contempt). \n132 S. Ct. at 1522–23 (emphasis supplied). \n  Thus, the Supreme Court indicated that categorically strip-searching the following two \nclasses of detainees may not pass constitutional muster: (1) detainees charged with misdemeanors \nand segregated alone from the general population; and (2) detainees charged with misdemeanors and \nsegregated with other detainees charged with misdemeanors from the general population. Plaintiffs here \nclearly do not fall into the first class, but they do not fall into the second either. As plaintiffs \nrepeatedly acknowledge throughout their brief, all new arrestees, not just those charged with \nmisdemeanors, were sent to the separate new-admit housing facilities. See, e.g., Pls.’ Br. 49 (“[E]very \nnew arrestee admitted to the Jail and strip searched was isolated for 72 hours . . . .” (emphasis \nsupplied) (internal quotation marks omitted)); id. at 50 (“[A]ll new admits [were held] out of the \ngeneral population for a significant period of time . . . .” (emphasis supplied)). In other words, “[t]he \nnew admits [were] not segregated by offense”—new admits charged with misdemeanors and new \nadmits charged with felonies were segregated together. Id. at 49. \nAlso unpersuasive is plaintiffs’ argument that Florence is inapplicable because the Supreme \nCourt recognized that it had not been “presented [with] the opportunity to consider a narrow \nexception of the sort Justice Alito describe[d]” in his concurrence, “which might restrict whether an \narrestee [(1)] whose detention has not yet been reviewed by a magistrate or other judicial officer, and \n[(2)] who can be held in available facilities removed from the general population, may be subjected \nto the types of searches at issue.” Florence, 132 S. Ct. at 1523; see also Pls.’ Br. at 43. Assuming that \nplaintiffs can satisfy the second prong of this exception (which seems unlikely, as discussed in the \npreceding paragraph), they do not even claim that they can satisfy the first. Rather, they state only \nthat “many class members had not had their detention reviewed by a judicial officer at the time they \n5 \n \n\nCase 14-1388, Document 165-1, 02/26/2016, 1713549, Page6 of 6\n \nwere admitted to the Jail and strip searched.” Pls.’ Br. 43 (emphasis supplied). As support for this \nnotion, plaintiffs cite the declarations of three class members—three, out of a class of 17,000. Id. \nThis calls into grave doubt whether, as to plaintiffs’ federal-law claims, “questions of law or fact \ncommon to class members predominate over . . . questions affecting only individual members, and \nthat a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the \ncontroversy.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3); see also Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Bombardier \nInc., 546 F.3d 196, 204 (2d Cir. 2008) (holding that it is the plaintiff’s burden to prove predominance \nby a preponderance of the evidence). \nFor all of these reasons, we agree with the District Court that Florence represents an \nintervening change of controlling law with respect to plaintiffs’ federal-law claims. \nCONCLUSION \nWe have considered all of the parties’ other arguments on appeal and found them to be \nwithout merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court’s judgment. \n              FOR THE COURT: \n              Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk \n6 \n ",

The parties agree that they are entering into this \njudgment in order to settle these individual claims only, and to avoid the \nconsiderable expense that would be incurred by the continued complex and \nlengthy litigation of these claims.  Plaintiffs have requested that the $350,000 in \ndamages be distributed evenly among the ten individual plaintiffs.  Defendants \nhave no objection to this distribution.  The parties agree that the $35,000 in \ncompensatory damages received by each individual plaintiff in no way reflects a \nconcession by defendants that the amount received is the actual value of any such \nclaim made now or in the future.  Further, even if the denial of class certification \nis reversed on appeal, none of these ten individual plaintiffs can increase his or \nher compensatory damages, nor receive any punitive damages, based on his or her \ninjuries, but rather may only seek or receive additional compensation for \nattorney's fees and his or her time and effort as a class representative, subject to \nthe limits specified in paragraphs 7 and 9 below; \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 104      Filed 07/05/2005     Page 3 of 9\n\\2)  all class claims, including attorneys' fees and costs, are expressly reserved and \npreserved; \n(3)  the individual plaintiffs expressly retain the right to appeal denial of class \ncertification on behalf of the putative class; \n(4)  each individual plaintiff (a) suffered an \"actual, concrete injury\" and (b) will \nretain a \"personal stake\" in the outcome of the appeal of the denial of class \ncertification, including but not limited to the sharing of attorneys' fees and costs \nwith the putative class and compensation for time and effort expended as a class \nrepresentative as specified in paragraph 7 below; \n(5)  defendants will not oppose the individual plaintiffs' appeal of denial of class \ncertification on grounds of lack of standing or mootness arising from the \nsettlement of these cases. Defendants retain the right to raise standing and/or \nmootness objections to the appeal of class certification with respect to those issues \nfor which the existence of these grounds lies without regard to settlement of these \ncases; \n(6)  if the denial of class certification is reversed on appeal, the individual plaintiffs' \nstanding in this action will relate back to the time in which class certification was \ninitially deni ed; \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 104      Filed 07/05/2005     Page 4 of 9\n(7)  if the denial of class certification is reversed on appeal, defendants will not contest \nthe adequacy of the individual plaintiffs to continue to represent the certified class \nas class representatives on the basis that they have already settled their \ncompensatory and punitive damages claims.

Absent objections to \nthe appropriateness of any of the ten individual plaintiffs on the basis of their \ntypicality, defendants will not oppose plaintiffs' right to (a) offer their personal \ncircumstances in support of the class claims, (b) seek and receive any class wide \nequitable relief and any other appropriate relief on behalf of the certified class \nother than any increase in his or her individual compensatory damages, or receipt \nof any punitive damages, based on his or her injuries, and ( c) apply for \ncompensation for their time and efforts as class representatives in an amount not \nto exceed $1,000 per class representative, with the express understanding that the \nindividual plaintiffs may not seek any further compensation for compensatory \ndamages, or share in any award of punitive damages awarded to the class; \n(8)  if the denial of class certification is reversed on appeal, defendants wi1l not oppose \ngenerally the intervention of class members other than the named plaintiffs as \nadditional named class representatives, but defendants wi1l retain the right to \ncontest the adequacy of any such individuals to serve as additional class \nrepresentatives under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23; \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 104      Filed 07/05/2005     Page 5 of 9\n(<})  if the denial of class certification is reversed and the class action case moves \nforward or is settled, plaintiffs, including the individual plaintiffs, will be \npermitted to apply for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs for the entire litigation \nfrom its inception as prevailing parties, and such fees and costs will not be \ncapped; \n(10)  if the denial of class certification is upheld on appeal, the individual plaintiffs will \nbe granted a reasonable time (not less than thirty (30) days from the issuance of \nthe mandate by the Second Circuit) to apply for reasonable attorneys' fees and \ncosts in an aggregate amount not to exceed $125,000; \n(11)  This Stipulation of Judgment is made subject to the approval of the Nassau \nCounty Legislature.

Smith, Esq.\nFor Defendants:\nJohn Ciampoli\nNassau County Attorney\nOne West Street\nMineola, New York 11501\nBy: Dennis J. Saffron, Esq.\nHURLEY, Senior District Judge:\n\nPresently before the Court is defendants’ motion requesting that the Court “reconsider\nand vacate the portion of the Court’s [January 16, 2007] order granting plaintiffs summary\njudgment on liability, and to instead dismiss these consolidated actions, based on the intervening\nchange in controlling law brought about by the recent decision of the United States Supreme\nCourt in Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, 132 S. Ct. 1510 (2012).”  (Defs.’ Mem. in\nSupp. at 1.)  Plaintiffs have opposed defendants’ application.  For the reasons set forth below,\ndefendants’ motion is granted in part and denied in part.\nBACKGROUND\nThe background of this action is set forth in the prior decisions of this Court, familiarity\nwith which is presumed.  The Court will partially reiterate an abbreviated history in order to\nprovide context for the Court’s analysis and rulings, infra.\nClass Certification\nIn 1999, a district court within this District found that the blanket policy of the Nassau\nCounty Correctional Center (“NCCC”) of strip searching newly admitted individuals arrested for\nmisdemeanors or non-criminal offenses in Nassau County violated the Fourth Amendment.  See\nShain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), aff’d, 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001).  These\nconsolidated actions were commenced shortly after the District Court’s decision in Shain in\n1999, and sought damages plaintiffs suffered as a result of the NCCC’s blanket strip search\npolicy.  Extensive pretrial motion practice ensued, including plaintiffs’ numerous attempts to\nachieve class certification pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (“Rule”) 23.  \nIn January 2003, in the midst of the class certification motion practice, plaintiffs moved\nfor class certification as to liability only.  In response thereto, defendants conceded their liability. \n2\n\nAs the Second Circuit later summarized, “defendants conceded ‘the one common issue’ that in\ntheir view ‘might be appropriate for class certification . . . namely, whether the NCCC’s strip\nsearch policy during the class period was constitutional.’ [ ] Specifically, defendants recognized\nthat they ‘are bound by Shain under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.’” In re Nassau County\nStrip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 224 (2d Cir. 2006).  \nBased on defendants’ concession, this Court deleted liability from the certification\nanalysis and denied class treatment.  On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed and directed this\nCourt “to certify a class on the issue of liability . . . [and] consider anew whether to certify a\nclass as to damages as well.”  Id. at 231.  In accordance with this direction, “and in light of\ndefendants’ concession of liability to all class members,” the Court certified a class as to liability\nand entered “summary judgment on liability for all strip searches upon admission to the\n[NCCC].”1  (Jan. 16, 2007 Order at 2.) \nThe Supreme Court’s Subsequent Decision in Florence\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court confronted “the question of what rules, or limitations, the\nConstitution imposes on searches of arrested persons who are to be held in jail while their cases\n1 Subsequently, plaintiffs moved to extend class certification to include damages.  By\nMemorandum & Order dated March 27, 2008, the Court found that the issue of general damages\ndue to the asserted injury to human dignity predominated, and concluded that there was “no\nreason [to believe] that a jury . . . could not determine an amount of general damages awardable\nto each member of the class.”  (Mar. 27, 2008 Order at 7-12.)  The parties waived the right to a\njury trial and submitted the issue of a general damages determination to the Court.  After an\neleven-day bench trial, the Court awarded general damages in the amount of $500 per strip\nsearch.  (Sept. 22, 2010 Order at 65-66.)  By Memorandum & Order dated October 19, 2011, the\nCourt held that it would not extend class certification to permit plaintiffs to pursue a class-wide\naward for “garden-variety” emotional distress damages, and concluded that emotional distress\ndamages beyond those which are inseparable from the injury to human dignity may be awarded\nonly on an individual, case-by-case basis.  (Oct. 19, 2011 Order at 13-20, 38.)     \n3\n\nare being processed.”  Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of the Cnty. of Burlington, 132\nS.Ct. 1510, 1513 (2012).  “[I]n broad terms, the controversy [before the Court] concern[ed]\nwhether every detainee who will be admitted to the general population may be required to\nundergo a close visual inspection while undressed.”  Id. \nAt issue before the Court in Florence were the “search process[es]” experienced by the\npetitioner at two separate jails.  Id. at 1514.  In the Burlington County Detention Center, the\npetitioner was required to shower with a delousing agent and then submit to a corrections\nofficer’s close visual inspection, during which the petitioner was instructed “to open his mouth,\nlift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and lift his genitals.”  Id.  The petitioner “shared a\ncell with at least one other person and interacted with other inmates following his admission to\nthe jail.”  Id.  Six days later, the petitioner was transferred to Essex County Correctional Facility,\nwhich was the “largest county jail in New Jersey” and “admit[ted] more than 25,000 inmates\neach year.”  Id.  Upon his arrival, the petitioner was required to pass through a metal detector\nand then wait “in a group holding cell for a more thorough search.”2  Id.  Once that search was\ncompleted, the petitioner submitted to a “mandatory shower, during which his clothes were\ninspected,” and was “admitted to the facility.”  Id.  \nThe petitioner brought suit seeking relief pursuant to Section 1983 for violations of his\nFourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The Florence case “proceed[ed] on the understanding\nthat the officers [at each facility] searched detainees prior to their admission to the general\n2 The petitioner and other detainees were instructed to remove their clothing while a\ncorrections officer “looked at their ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits,\nand other body openings.”  Florence, 132 S.Ct. at 1514.  The petitioner alleged that “he was\nrequired to lift his genitals, turn around, and cough in a squatting position as part of the process.” \nId.  \n4\n\npopulation.”  Id. at 1515.\nAs part of its analysis, the Court stated that “[t]he admission of inmates creates numerous\nrisks for facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and for a new detainee himself or\nherself,” and that “[t]here is a substantial interest in preventing any new inmate, either of his own\nwill or as a result of coercion, from putting all who live or work at these institutions at even\ngreater risk when he is admitted to the general population.”  Id. at 1518, 1520.  Overall, the\nCourt concluded that “the search procedures at the Burlington County Detention Center and the\nEssex County Correctional Facility struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the\nneeds of the institutions,” and did not violate the petitioner’s Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment\nrights.  Id. at 1523.\nThe Present Motion to Vacate Defendants’ Concession of Liability in Light of Florence  \nDefendants assert that pursuant to Rule 54(b), “every order short of a final decree is\nsubject to reopening at the discretion of the district judge.”  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. at 1 (quoting\nMoses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Const. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 12 & n.14, 103 S. Ct. 927,\n74 L. Ed. 765 (1983)).)  Defendants assert that the Supreme Court’s decision in Florence\nrepresents an intervening change of controlling law that should lead the Court “to vacate [its]\nprior order granting summary judgment for plaintiffs on the issue of liability and to instead enter\nsummary judgment for defendants dismissing the case.”  (Id. at 2.)  \nIn opposition, plaintiffs argue (1) that Florence does not constitute an intervening change\nof controlling law “because [it] does not apply to the plaintiff class here” (Pls.’ Opp’n at 2), (2)\nthat “defendants should not be relieved of their unlimited and unreserved liability concession\nnine years ago, [which was] made to gain strategic advantage in the litigation” (id.), and (3) that\n5\n\n“Florence does not constitute an intervening change in controlling state law, and [, accordingly,]\ndefendants' liability concession and judgment on the independent New York State constitutional\nclaims should not be disturbed.”  (Pls.' Opp'n at 17 (the first letter of each word in the quoted\nexcerpt from plaintiffs' brief, unlike the foregoing quote, is capitalized).)   \nDISCUSSION\nI. Legal Standard\nDefendants frame their application as a request made pursuant to Rule 54(b), which\nprovides, in relevant part: “[A]ny order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates\nfewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all parties does not end the\naction as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a \njudgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties’ rights and liabilities.”  Fed. R. Civ. Pr.\n54(b).  As the Second Circuit has made clear, however, “[e]ven if Rule 54(b) allows parties to\nrequest district courts to revisit earlier rulings, the moving party must do so within the strictures\nof the law of the case doctrine.”  Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245,\n1255 (2d Cir. 1992).\n“Under the law of the case doctrine, a decision on an issue made at one stage of a case\nbecomes binding precedent to be followed in subsequent stages of the same litigation.”  In re\nPCH Assocs., 949 F.2d 585, 592 (2d Cir. 1991).  This doctrine “is admittedly discretionary and\ndoes not limit a court’s power to reconsider its own decisions prior to final judgment.”  Virgin\nAtl. Airways, Ltd., 956 F.2d at 1255.  However, the Second Circuit has “repeatedly stated [that it]\nwill not depart from the law of the case absent cogent or compelling reasons.”  Pescatore v. Pan\nAm. World Airways, Inc., 97 F.3d 1, 8 (2d Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks and alteration\n6\n\nomitted).  “The major grounds justifying reconsideration are an intervening change of\ncontrolling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent\nmanifest injustice.”  Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd., 956 F.2d at 1255 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).  As noted above, Defendants urge the Court to grant reconsideration of its January 16,\n2007 Order granting Plaintiffs summary judgment as to liability because Florence constitutes an\nintervening change of controlling law.\nThe Second Circuit has made clear that “if, before a case in a district court has proceeded\nto final judgment, a decision of the Supreme Court demonstrates that a ruling on which the\njudgment would depend was in error, no principle of the law of the case would warrant a failure\non our part to correct the ruling.”  Fogel v. Chestnutt, 668 F.2d 100, 109 (2d Cir. 1981) (quoting\nZdanok v. Glidden Co., 327 F.2d 944, 951 (2d Cir. 1964) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  “It\nis not enough,” however, that the party moving for reconsideration “could now make a more\npersuasive argument” based on the newly-decided Supreme Court case.  See id.  Rather, “[t]he\nlaw of the case will be disregarded only when the court has ‘a clear conviction of error’ with\nrespect to a point of law on which its previous decision was predicated.”  Id. (quoting Zdanok,\n327 F.2d at 953).  “[M]ere doubt . . . is not enough to open [a] point for full reconsideration.”  Id.\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\nII. The Impact of Defendants’ Concession of Liability\nIn defining the rationale behind the law of the case doctrine, the Second Circuit has noted\nthat “where litigants have once battled for the court’s decision, they should neither be required,\nnor without good reason permitted, to battle for it again.”  Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd., 956 F.2d at\n1255.  Here, plaintiffs argue, defendants “did not ‘battle for this court’s decision’ nine years ago;\n7\n\ninstead, they conceded liability ‘for all purposes.’”  (Pls.’ Opp’n at 21.)  Plaintiffs assert that\nthere is no case law or other legal authority that would support granting defendants’ request that\nthe Court “relieve [them] of their concession, and of the liability judgment to which they agreed,\nknow[ingly], voluntarily, unreservedly, and for strategic advantage, in a money damages case.” \n(Id.)  \nDefendants counter that plaintiffs have offered no legal support for their argument that\n“had [defendants] continued to contest liability after Shain, and thus had summary judgment\nimposed upon us in a litigated order, we would now be relieved of that liability under Florence,\nbut because we responsibly and necessarily conceded the issue under Shain we are forever bound\nby, and [are] subject to damages under, that now discredited case.”  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. at 12-\n13.)  \nAlthough case law addressing this particular issue is admittedly sparse, there does appear\nto be some legal support for the proposition that defendants’ concession of liability does not, in\nand of itself, prevent this Court from reviewing its summary judgment ruling, which has\nadmittedly become the law of the case.  The Ninth Circuit’s decision in United States v. Miller,\n822 F.2d 828 (9th Cir. 1987) (“Miller II”), is instructive on this issue.  In that case, the defendant\nhad been convicted of possession of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).  At issue was\nthe legality of searches of his luggage in two separate airports:  DEA agents had conducted a\nwarrantless search of his luggage in Atlanta, and then – based in part on evidence garnered from\nthat warrantless search – a warrant was obtained to search other pieces of his luggage in San\nFrancisco.  Early on in the case, the government conceded “that the legality of the warrantless\nsearch in Atlanta was conclusive as to the legality of the later search with a warrant in San\n8\n\nFrancisco.”  Id. at 829.  The district court refused to suppress the evidence uncovered in San\nFrancisco, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, relying on the government’s concession when it\nconcluded:\nAs a result of the unlawful search [in Atlanta], DEA agents obtained\ntangible evidence that was used as the basis for Miller’s arrest and for\na warrant to search his ot her luggage [in San Francisco]. . . . The\nevidence obtained was thus probative of the crime for which Miller\nwas charged. . . . The f ruits of the illegal search must therefore be\nsuppressed.\nId. (citing United States v. Miller, 769 F.2d 554, 560 (9th Cir. 1985) (“Miller I”)).  This\nstatement and the Circuit’s mandate became law of the case.  See id.  The case was then\nremanded to the district court.\nOn remand, the government sought to vacate its concession and the district court\npermitted it to do so “on the ground that United States v. Leon had been decided [by the Supreme\nCourt] on July 5, 1984, making a change in the law governing searches based on warrants\nobtained in good faith.”  Id. at 829 (citation omitted).  The district court concluded that the\nevidence found as a result of the San Francisco search should not be suppressed.\nOn appeal, the Ninth Circuit determined that “the information actually used to get the\nwarrant in San Francisco was independent of [the illegal Atlanta search and, therefore,] [t]here is\nno reason to suppress the evidence secured on the basis of the [San Francisco] warrant.”  Id. at\n831.  The Circuit continued, however: “But are we precluded from reaching this result by the\nconcession that the government first made that the legality of the warrantless search in Atlanta\nwas conclusive as to the legality of [the] San Francisco search?”  Id.  That concession, moreover,\n“was built upon by [the Circuit] in its first treatment of this case,” when it ruled in Miller I that\n“[a]s a result of the unlawful search [in Atlanta], DEA agents obtained tangible evidence that\n9\n\nwas used as the basis for . . . a warrant to search his other luggage [in San Francisco].”  Id. at\n832.  That statement, as noted above, “constituted the law of the case.”  Id.  Nevertheless, the\nCircuit answered its own query in the negative by concluding that it was not bound by the law of\nthe case.   \nThe Ninth Circuit noted that “[t]he difference between the law of the case and res\njudicata is that ‘one directs discretion, the other supersedes it and compels judgment.’” Id. at 832\n(quoting Southern Ry. Co. v. Clift, 260 U.S. 316, 319, 43 S. Ct. 126. 67 L. Ed. 283 (1922)). \nAccording to the Circuit, the question of whether to reconsider the law of the case in order to\nprevent a “manifest injustice” was “a matter of discretion.”  Id.  Overall, the Circuit found that\nlaw of the case doctrine “should not be applied woodenly in a way inconsistent with substantial\njustice.”  Id.  The Circuit concluded that “[t]he concession made by the government, [and] by the\nissuance of the mandate in Miller I, became the law of the case, but the procedural posture of this\ncase affords us the opportunity to correct the substantial injustice that would be done were we to\nbind the government to its concession.”  Id. at 833.  After considering the record, the Circuit\ndecided that it “should not reverse the defendant’s conviction because the government made a\nmistake in its presentation of a legal argument.”  Id.   \nThe Eighth Circuit’s decision in Morris v. American National Can Corporation, 988 F.2d\n50 (8th Cir. 1993), is also relevant here.  In that case, a plaintiff who had prevailed on her Title\nVII claim appealed the district court’s refusal to enhance her attorneys’ fee award “based on the\ncontingency fee arrangement she had with her attorney, and the associated risk that her attorney\nwould receive no compensation.”  Id. at 51.  In defending against the plaintiff’s appeal, the\ndefendant argued that the lower court had properly applied the prevailing law at the time, i.e.,\n10\n\nJustice O’Connor’s concurring opinion in Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens’ Council for\nClean Air, 483 U.S. 711, 107 S. Ct. 3078, 97 L. Ed. 2d 585 (1987) (“Delaware Valley II”).  Id. \nThe defendant did not, however, assert any argument that Title VII’s attorneys’ fee provision\nprecluded enhancements based on the risks associated with a contingency fee arrangement. Id. \nBecause defendant effectively waived that argument, the Circuit declined to address the issue. \nId.  \nThe Eighth Circuit held “based on prior precedent in this circuit, that Justice O’Connor’s\nopinion was the ‘current legal standard for awarding contingency enhancements.’” Id. at 52\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  The Circuit reversed the district court, however, and\nremanded the issue for further proceedings.  Morris v. Am. Nat’l Can Corp., 952 F.2d 200, 207\n(8th Cir. 1991) (“Morris II”).  After conducting those proceedings, the district court enhanced\nthe plaintiff’s attorneys’ fee award by 50% to reflect the contingency fee arrangement.  Id. \nNineteen days later, however, the Supreme Court issued its decision in City of Burlington v.\nDague, 505 U.S. 557, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1992), which held that enhancements\nfor contingency fees were not permitted under certain fee-shifting statutes.  Subsequently, the\ndefendant appealed the district court’s recent award of enhanced attorneys’ fees, arguing that\nsuch enhancements were prohibited by the Supreme Court’s intervening decision in Dague.  \nThe plaintiff argued that the defendant should not be able to benefit from the intervening\nDague decision because it had waived the argument upon which the Dague decision was based. \nAs such, the plaintiff continued, the traditional exception to the law of the case doctrine, which\npermits a court to depart from the law of the case in the face of “an intervening decision from a\nsuperior tribunal [that] clearly demonstrates the law of the case is wrong,” would be\n11\n\ninapplicable.  See Morris, 988 F.2d at 52.  The Circuit disagreed, however, concluding that the\ndefendant’s waiver was “meaningful only if there is a difference between a law of the case based\non a waiver and a law of the case based on briefing and argument.”  Id.  After noting that neither\nparty had articulated any reasons for such a distinction, the Circuit stated that “no court has ever\napplied the exceptions to the law of the case doctrine differently when the law was based on a\nwaived issue as opposed to an issue formally presented to the court.”  Id.  Thus, the Circuit\nconcluded, “the law of the case as a result of waiver is no different than a matter that becomes\nthe law of the case as a result of argument.”  Id.  The Circuit “appl[ied] the traditional exceptions\nto the law of the case doctrine,” and “[i]n light of the intervening decision in Dague, [ ]\nreverse[d] the enhancement of attorney fees.”  Id. at 53.\nHere, after defendants conceded liability, the Court’s January 16, 2007 Order – which\ngranted summary judgment on liability against defendants based on that concession – became the\nlaw of the case.  After reviewing the case law described in detail above, the Court concludes that\ndefendants’ concession of liability does not, in and of itself, divest this Court of its discretion to\nreconsider its January 16, 2007 Order.  Although defendants may not have “battle[d] for this\ncourt’s decision” before conceding liability (see Pls.’ Opp’n at 21), plaintiffs have failed to cite\nto any case law standing for the proposition that the law of the case resulting from defendants’\nconcession is any different from law of the case resulting from a “battle.”3  Indeed, as the Eighth\n3 Plaintiffs’ citation to Benjamin v. Jacobson, 172 F.3d 144 (2d Cir. 1999) is\ninapposite.  In that case, the Second Circuit dealt with the effect that the enactment of the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PLRA”) had on earlier consent decrees entered into to resolve\nclass actions brought by pretrial detainees against the City of New York.  The Circuit described\nthe applicable legal framework as follows: “Under the separation of powers, Congress lacks the\nauthority to alter a finally rendered judgment ordering the payment of money.  On the other\nhand, to the extent that a court’s final judgment consists of an injunction, Congress may require\n12\n\nCircuit’s decision in Morris suggests by way of analogy, there is no meaningful distinction\nbetween the two.  See Morris, 988 F.2d at 52 (“[T]he law of the case as a result of waiver is no\ndifferent than a matter that becomes the law of the case as a result of argument.”).\nThus, the Court turns to the question of whether the Supreme Court’s decision in\nFlorence constitutes an intervening change in controlling law that justifies this Court’s\nreconsideration of its January 16, 2007 Order.  \nIII. Defendants Have Demonstrated That Florence Constitutes an Intervening Change in\nControlling Law                                                                         \nAs noted above, the Second Circuit has recognized three circumstances under which a\ncourt can justifiably exercise its discretion to depart from the law of the case: (1) “an intervening\nchange of controlling law,” (2) “the availability of new evidence,” or (3) “the need to correct a\nclear error or prevent manifest injustice.”  Virgin Atl. Airways, 956 F.2d at 1255 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).  Defendants assert that the Supreme Court’s decision in Florence\nconstitutes an intervening change of controlling law.  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. at 2.)  \nJustice Kennedy, writing for the majority in Florence, described the issue before the\nCourt “in broad terms . . . whether every detainee who will be admitted to the general population\nmay be required to undergo a close visual inspection while undressed” as part of the correctional\nfacility's intake process.  Florence 132 S.Ct. at 1513.  It was the “search process at each jail [i.e.\nalteration or termination of its future effect if the law on which the injunction was predicated has\nbeen changed.”  Benjamin, 172 F.3d at 161.  Plaintiffs argue that, pursuant to this distinction\narticulated in Benjamin, that “judgments in actions at law for damages[ ] are inherently final.” \n(Pls.’ Opp’n at 22.)  Of course, there has been no “finally rendered judgment ordering the\npayment of money” in this case, see Benjamin, 172 F.3d at 161, nor is there any statutory or\nCongressional action involved.  The cases cited by plaintiffs involving settlement agreements\n(see Pls.’ Opp’n at 22-23) are similarly inapplicable.    \n13\n\nthe Burlington County Detention Center and the Essex County Correctional Facility] that [gave]\nrise to the claims before the Court.”  Id. at 1514. \nThe central issue for present purposes is whether the Supreme Court's repeated use of the\nterm “general population” renders Florence inapplicable to the plaintiff class in that the new\nadmittees to the NCCC were initially housed for a period of 72 hours, albeit as a group, apart\nfrom other inmates for health assessment purposes.  It was prior to or at the beginning of that\nprocess that the class members were strip searched. \n(a) Positions of the Parties\nPlaintiffs contend that Florence is irrelevant to the plaintiff class here, all of whom were\nstrip searched upon admissions and deliberately isolated from the general inmate population for\n72 hours.  (Pl.’s Opp’n. at 8.)  Plaintiffs further posit that “[i]t is therefore clear  that Justice\nAlito was noting that Florence had no application to the case at bar where every one of the\n17,000 class members were misdemeanor, petty offense or civil contempt arrestees housed in\nseparate facilities and not admitted to the general inmate population for 72 hours.”  Id. at 9.   \nDefendants' view as to the significance of the term general population as used in\nFlorence differs markedly from plaintiffs' view.  Defendants maintain that “Florence makes\nclear that whether a detainee is in the 'general population' is not dependent upon the particular\nusage of that term at a particular facility, but rather means having contact with other inmates as\nopposed to being held in isolation.”  (Defs.' Mem. in Supp. at 5.)  \n(b) Breadth of Holding in Florence\nFlorence's sanctioning of intake strip searches of individuals arrested for minor offenses,\nabsent reasonable suspicion that the arrestees possess contraband, is, by its very nature, broad\n14\n\nbased.  Indeed, its holding  – prescinding for the moment from the issue as to the meaning of the\nterm “general population” as used in Florence  –  calls into question the continued viability of\nthe class certified here as to liability, to wit: “all persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-\ncriminal offenses in Nassau County who thereafter were strip searched at the Nassau County\nCorrectional Center pursuant to defendants' blanket policy, practice and custom which required\nthat all arrestees be strip-searched upon admission to the facility, from May 10, 1996 until and\nincluding June 1, 1999.”  (See Court's Mem. & Order filed on Jan. 16, 2007 at 2.)  And Florence,\nagain subject to the caveat concerning the meaning of general population, largely eviscerated the\nholding by the district court in Shain, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564, i.e. the decision upon which the\npresent class action is seemingly predicated. \nAlthough the holding in Florence is far-reaching, it falls short of being all encompassing. \nAs Chief Justice Roberts explained in his concurring opinion: “The Court makes a persuasive\ncase for the general applicability of the rule it announces.  The Court is nonetheless wise to leave\nopen the possibility of exceptions, to ensure that we not embarrass the future.”  Florence, 132\nS.Ct. at 1523 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nJustice Alito in his concurrence similarly counsels against applying the Court's holding\nindiscriminately noting “that the Court does not hold that it is always reasonable to conduct a\nfull strip search of an arrestee whose detention has not been reviewed by a judicial officer and\nwho could be held in available facilities apart from the general population.”  Id. at 1524. \nMoreover, in Part IV of Florence, four of the five justices in the majority (viz. Chief Justice\nRoberts and Justices Alito, Kennedy and Scalia), explained that “[t]his case does not require the\nCourt to rule on the types of searches that would be reasonable in instances where, for example,\n15\n\na detainee will be held without assignment to the general jail population and without substantial\ncontact with other detainees.  This describes the circumstances in Atwater [v. City of Lago Vista\net al, 532 U.S. 318, 121 S. Ct. 1536, 149 L. Ed. 2d 549 (2001)].”  Id. at 1522-23.\nIn Atwater, a motorist brought a Section 1983 claim against the City, its police chief and\nthe arresting officer, contending that her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable\nseizure was violated when she was arrested, handcuffed, and detained in jail for one hour for\nfailing to wear her seatbelt and failing to fasten her children in seatbelts.  532 U.S. at 324.  Her\nclaim was rejected at the district and circuit levels and, ultimately, by the Supreme Court.  The\nCourt, in Atwater, held that a warrantless arrest for a minor criminal offense, such as a\nmisdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a fine, is not violative of the Fourth\nAmendment.  Id. at 355.  The case's significance for present purposes is its being cited in\nFlorence as an example of an arrested individual held “without assignment to the general jail\npopulation,” Florence, 132 S.Ct. at 1522; Ms. Atwater's contact with the jail consisted of having\nher mug shot taken, being “placed . . . alone, in a jail cell for about one hour,” and then\nappearing before a magistrate and released on bond.  Id. at 1523.  \nIn sum, Florence's holding is of sufficient breadth to undermine both the common\nquestions of law and of fact upon which the present federal class certification is based if, as\ndefendants contend, the class members entered into the NCCC's “general population” consistent\nwith the Supreme Court's usage of that term.       \n(c) Meaning of the Term General Population \nAbsent from Florence is a definition of the term general population, thus precluding a\nsimple answer to this pivotal question.  As a result, reference to the context in which the term is\n16\n\nused by the Supreme Court is necessary to determine its meaning.  To begin that analysis, an\noverview of the intake procedure at the NCCC during the class period is needed.\n(i) Declarations of Michael Golio\nDefendants maintain that newly admitted detainees had sufficient contact with other\ninmates and facility staff to fall within the ambit of Florence, relying primarily on the\nDeclaration of Michael Golio dated June 25, 2012 (the “Golio Declaration”) as well as his Reply\nDeclaration of Sept. 19, 2012 (the “Golio Reply Declaration”).  Golio is an investigator Captain\nassigned to the Legal Unit of the Nassau County Sheriff's Department, which, in turn, operates\nthe NCCC.  In his declaration, Golio describes the current processing procedures for new\ndetainees, and outlines the contacts that new admittees have with each other and NCCC staff. \nBased on his over 25 years of broad-based experience at the NCCC, Golio explains that the\n“procedures for new detainees now are substantially identical to those [in place] during the class\nperiod involved in the litigation.”  (Golio Decl. ¶ 5.)\nAs Golio describes it, the contacts that newly admitted detainees have amongst\nthemselves and with other inmates and staff “begins immediately upon [the detainees'] arrival at\nthe jail, when detainees are kept in holding pens with up to twenty other new admittees while\nawaiting processing.”4   (Defs.' Mem. in Supp. at 7; see also Golio Decl. ¶¶ 6, 7).  As they are\nprocessed, the detainees move from “station to station in the Operations Unit area unescorted\nand encounter other inmates, both new admits and others, throughout this movement.”  (Defs.'\n4  Parenthetically, during the general damages trial held during November and December\n2009, class member Kevin Murray testified for plaintiffs that following his arrest on “March 27,\n1997,” he was placed in a “holding cell at NCCC” with “six to eight” other people.  (See Nov.\n30, 2009 Trial Transcript (“Tr.”) at 171.) \n17\n\nMem. in Supp. at 7; see also Golio Decl. ¶¶ 7, 8.)   At both the clothing room and medical area\nstations, the detainees are placed in holding pens with up to twenty other new admittees.  (Defs.'\nMem. in Supp. at 7; see also Golio Decl. ¶¶ 9, 10.)  After their medical evaluation, the detainees\n“travel unescorted through a corridor to the new admission housing area located in another\nbuilding, typically encountering other inmates during this movement.”  (Defs.' Mem. in Supp. at\n7-8; see also Golio Decl. ¶ 11.)  \nNew admission housing is a floor of the NCCC comprised of four tiers with twenty cells\nper tier.  (Defs.' Mem. in Supp. at 8.)  Detainees must stay in new admission housing for at least\n72 hours (during which time the NCCC obtains medical clearances and reviews inmate history\ninformation) and/or until cleared by a NCCC's medical services provider.  (Golio Decl. ¶ 12) \n“Generally, inmates [in new admission housing] are only secured in their [individual] cells\nduring the daytime at facility population count times, shift change, and during inmate meal\ndistribution and clean-up procedures.”  (Id. ¶ 15.)  During the remainder of the day, inmates “are\npermitted to congregate in the common area with other inmates housed on their tier [to] watch\nthe tier television” and engage in other permitted activities.  (Id. ¶ 14.)5 \n5  Class members Michael Fanning and Mary Beth Paden submitted declarations in\nopposition to the relief sought by defendants in which each estimated the time new admittees\nwere free to leave their cells [and, thus, free to intermingle with other new admittees] was\nlimited to one hour daily, rather than the more extensive periods recited in the Golio Declaration. \n(See Sept. 28, 2012 Decl. of Fanning at ¶ 3 and Sept. 29, 2012 Decl. of Paden at ¶ 5.)  Two other\nclass members, viz. Heidi Kane and Gregg Wills, filed declarations stating that their respective\nexperiences upon entry to the NCCC were essentially devoid of contact with other inmates.  (See\nSept. 29, 2012 Decls. of Kane and Wills; see generally, the Sept. 29, 2012 Reply Decl. of Golio\n¶¶  9 and 10, detailing, inter alia, how the experiences recited by the four class member\ndeclarants are  not representative of the approximately 17,000 class members, and is also at odds\nwith the then operative “official Policies & Procedures of the Sheriff's Department” which\nmandated that “inmates housed in 'New Admit' housing areas are to be afforded six hours of time\nout of their cells in their assigned housing area each day consistent with facility safety and\n18\n\n(ii) Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' Reliance Upon, and the\nCourt's Consideration of the Golio Declaration         \nPlaintiffs, in their opposition papers, attack Golio's Declaration dated June 25, 2012 on\nmultiple fronts, including its use by defendants in endeavoring to undo their concession of\nliability and as to its relevance.  As to the first argument, plaintiffs label the information\nprovided by Golio as not “newly discovered” and, thus, an improper vehicle for reconsideration. \n(Pls.' Opp'n at 12-13.)  That argument is unavailing, however, given that the relevance of the\nsubject information did not materialize until Florence was decided. \nIn questioning the Declaration's relevance, plaintiffs posit that it is “cast in language\nwhich purports to describe the present day rather than the class period many years ago.”  (Id. at\nn.1.)  That deficiency – assuming its existence — has been remedied via the submission of\nGolio's Reply Declaration filed on September 29, 2012.  The explanations provided therein,\nbased on his extensive experience at the NCCC before, during, and after the class period, easily\nsatisfy relevancy requirements and, accordingly, the information in his Declarations will be\nconsidered by the Court in deciding defendants' motion.\n(iii) Plaintiffs' Argument is Based on an Overly Restrictive\nInterpretation of Florence\nPlaintiffs essentially maintain that since NCCC draws a distinction between new\nadmittees on the one hand, and inmates in what it calls its “general population” on the other, and\nsecurity concerns,” citing Nassau County Sheriff's Department Policies & Procedures No. CD-\n08-01-02, eff. June 14, 1994 (attached as Ex. A), § X(B) at 6.)\nIncidently both Fanning and Wills, after being strip searched sometime prior to, or during \nthe first 72 hours of confinement, were placed in NCCC's general population, unlike Kane and\nPaden who were not.\n19\n\ngiven that the Supreme Court couched its holding in terms of certain detainees being strip\nsearched prior to being admitted to a facility's “general population,” it necessarily follows that\nFlorence is irrelevant, i.e. “does not apply to this case and does not support, let alone require,\nvacating the liability judgment on, and dismissing, the federal claims.”  (Pls.' Opp'n at 3.)  That\nargument is well articulated, straightforward, and certainly has considerable surface appeal.  Yet,\nupon closer scrutiny, its flaws become manifest.  To begin, it is out-of-sync, and irreconcilable \nwith the rationale driving the decision in Florence, viz. the need to promote safety and security\nwithin the institution.  Beyond that, the contention that Florence is not germane to defendants'\nmotion fails to take into account that this is a class action and, as such, its very existence requires\nthe presence, inter alia, of “questions of law or fact common to the class,” Fed. R. of Civ. P.\n23(a)(2), and a finding by the Court that such questions “predominate over any questions\naffecting only individual members.”  Id. at (b)(3). \nThese two problems with plaintiffs' argument will be discussed in turn.  \nA. Equating the Supreme Court's Use of the Term “General\nPopulation” with NCCC's is Problematic                                         \n                             \nNCCC draws a distinction between new detainees segregated for the first 72 hours for\nhealth evaluation purposes (albeit as a group, or in groups), and those inmates who have already\ngone through that process.  If that distinction is meaningful for Florence purposes as plaintiffs\ninsist, it would mean that new admittees, arrested on minor matters, could not be strip searched\nupon their arrival at the NCCC absent reasonable suspicion to believe they harbored contraband. \nHowever, evidence proffered by both plaintiffs and defendants demonstrates that new admittees\nhad, at a minimum, at least some non-incidental interaction with other inmates and staff during\n20\n\nthat initial period.6  Under the circumstances, the proffered artificial line of demarcation urged\nby plaintiffs is inconsistent with safety concerns so clearly articulated in Florence.  See, e.g.,\nFlorence, 132 S.Ct. 1518-19 (“Jails and prisons . . . face grave threats posed by the increasing\nnumber of gang members who go through the intake process. . . . Fights among feuding gangs\ncan be deadly, and the officers who must maintain order are put in harm's way. . . . These\nconsiderations provide a reasonable basis to justify a visual inspection for certain tattoos and\nother signs of gang affiliation as part of the intake process.  The identification and isolation of\ngang members before they are admitted protects everyone in the facility.”); id. at 1520\n(“Concealing contraband often takes little time and effort.  It might be done as an officer\napproaches a suspect's car or during a brief commotion in a group holding cell.  Something small\nmight be tucked or taped under an armpit, behind an ear, between the buttocks, in the instep of a\nfoot, or inside the mouth or some other body cavity”); id. (“The record provides evidence that\nthe seriousness of an offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband. . . . People detained for\nminor offenses can turn out to be the most devious and dangerous criminals”); id. at 1521 (“It\nalso may be difficult, as a practical matter, to classify inmates by their current and prior offenses\nbefore the intake search.  Jails can be even more dangerous than prisons because officials there\n6  As plaintiffs, in endeavoring to downplay the significance of the Golio Declaration,\nstate: “[T]he Golio Declaration does not really contravene the essential thrust of the Donahue,\nGregg and Fanning Declarations and the testimony of Sheriff Jablonsky and Lt. Considine.  The\nfact that new admits are held in temporary cells for a short time upon entering the facility, and\nthat when escorted to their own cells in the separate new admit housing facility, they may\ncongregate in a common area for some period of time . . . does not [, Plaintiffs' argument\ncontinues,] amount to substantial contact, and hardly constitutes the sustained, prolonged and\noften unrestricted intermingled contact in general population to which Florence's holding is\ncabined.”  (Pls.' Opp'n at 14 (emphasis added).)  As stated in the text, the Court disagrees with\nthe final conclusion drawn by Plaintiffs.\n21\n\nknow so little about the people they admit at the outset. . . . An arrestee may be carrying a false\nID or lie about his identify.  The officers who conduct an initial search often do not have access\nto criminal history records.”). \nIn sum, the Court finds plaintiffs' interpretation of Florence to be overly restrictive. \nSegments of the NCCC inmate population, as well as staff, were exposed to the same type of\nsecurity, health and safety risks from new admittees before the health assessment process was\ncompleted as afterwards.  Accordingly, plaintiffs' efforts to establish a bright line separating the\npre and post assessment periods is unavailing. If new admittees were typically isolated during\nthe initial period, like Ms. Atwater in Atwater, 532 U.S. 318, the situation would be otherwise. \nBut, as just noted, there is no material issue as to the pivotal fact that non-de minimis interaction\nbetween and among new admittees and others was commonplace at NCCC during the class\nperiod.  Whether the new admittees were, for example, free to intermingle outside their cells\nduring the first 72 hours for only 1 hour daily as class members Fanning and Paden testified (see\nn.5, supra), or 6 hours daily as Golio averred and as the then applicable Sheriff's Department\nPolicies mandated (see page 18 and n.5, both supra), is a matter of degree, not substance.  Under\neither scenarios, the type of perilous contacts underscored in Florence were present.                 \nB. Plaintiffs' Position That Florence is not an Intervening \nChange in the Law Fails to Recognize its Effect on the Presently \nCertified Class Action as to Liability                                           \nJuxtaposing of the class, as certified, with the holding in Florence indicates their \nincompatibility.  Indeed Florence removes the core of the class, i.e. persons who were strip\nsearched absent reasonable suspicion upon their admission to the NCCC following their arrests\nfor misdemeanors or lesser offenses.  \n22\n\nTo the extent plaintiffs, as well as defendants, make reference to Parts III and IV of the\nmajority opinion and to Justice Alito's concurrence, the shared import of those portions of\nFlorence is that some individuals, depending on the circumstance,7 might have viable Fourth\nAmendment claims to the effect that they should not have been placed in the general population\nand thus in a position to interact with other inmates and staff, but rather should have been\nisolated thereby eliminating the need for strip searches to be conducted.  That issue was left \nundecided by the Supreme Court.  Florence, 132 S.Ct. at 1522-23 (“This case does not require\nthe Court to rule on the type of searches that would be reasonable in instances where, for\nexample, a detainee will be held without assignment to the general jail population and without\nsubstantial contact with other detainees.  This describes the circumstances in Atwater.”)  But\nmore importantly for present purposes, that issue is not articulated in plaintiffs' amended class\naction complaint as one of the grievances asserted against defendants.  Instead, the complaint\nspeaks solely of “[d]efendants' policy, practice and custom of conducting strip/body cavity\nsearches absent reasonable suspicion, . . . on a class of persons arrested for or charged with non-\nfelony offenses who are admitted to the Nassau County Correctional Center in East Meadow (the\n'County Jail').”  (Am. Class Action Compl. filed in Gardy Augustin v. Jablonsky, 99 Civ 3126, ¶\n2.)  Simply put, the present action is not framed to address the Ms. Atwater type of hypothetical\nclaims.  But, if contrary to the fact, it was, such class members would be merely a subset of the\napproximately 17,000 class members.  And therein is the problem.  Florence, as noted, destroyed\nthe commonality as to both law and fact which linked the class members together consistent with\n7  One such circumstances presumably would entail the space and staff available in the\nfacility at the time of the arrestee's admission.\n23\n\nSecond Circuit law prior to the Supreme Court's decision.  Maintenance of a class action – or, in\nthis case, continuation of such an action – requires, inter alia, that there be at least one question\nof law or of fact common to all class members, see D'Alauro v. G.S. Services Ltd. Partnership,\n168 F.R.D. 451, 455-56 (E.D.N.Y. 1996), and that “the questions of law or fact common to class\nmembers predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class\naction is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the\ncontroversy.”   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  Given that Florence has, in essence, discredited the\nrationale embodied in such cases as Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564, and, in the process,\nsanctioned the type of searches complained about in the instant amended class action complaint,\nplaintiffs are, at a minimum, no longer able to satisfy the predominance standard found in Rul\n23(b)(3).   \nIV. Defendants' Interpretation of Florence is Sound \nDefendants maintain, correctly in my view, that the NCCC's usage of the term general\npopulation does not determine the applicability of Florence.  Instead, it is the contact between\nnew admittees with other inmates and staff at the NCCC that is controlling.  As a result, and for\nthe reasons already provided, I find that Florence constitutes an intervening change in the law,\nnotwithstanding plaintiffs' well articulated, but unpersuasive protestations to the contrary.  \nThe legitimacy of defendants' position is further reinforced by reference to the\ncircumstances surrounding Florence being strip searched at the Burlington County Jail.  The\nSupreme Court explains that Florence “shared a cell with at least one other person and interacted\nwith other inmates following his admission to jail.”  Florence, 132 S.Ct. at 1514.   Later, the\nCourt addressed his undergoing the same type of procedure at the Essex County Correctional\n24\n\nFacility.  However, it seems clear that “the search process at each jail” was considered\nseparately.  Florence, 132 S.Ct. at 1514.8   \nThe purpose of citing Florence's experience at Burlington is that his interaction with\nother inmates there was essentially the same as what occurred with respect to many, if not most\nmembers of the present class.  And, of course, Florence's search at Burlington passed\nconstitutional muster.           \nV.   Florence Does Not Constitute an Intervening Change in Controlling New York State \nLaw and, Accordingly, Defendants' Concession of Liability on the Independent New\nYork  State Constitutional Claims are Unaffected                                                          \nIn plaintiffs' amended complaint, both federal and state claims are asserted.  As to the\nlatter, plaintiffs allege that their strip searches at NCCC violated Article I, Section 12 of the New\nYork State Constitution.9  In their November 4, 2003 concession letter, defendants conceded\nliability “for all purposes in this action against all remaining defendants.”  (Case No. 99 CV\n3126, Docket No. 43).  As a result, summary judgment as to liability was entered against\ndefendants on behalf of the “class and every member thereof.”  (Case No. 99 CV 2849, Docket\nNo. 122).  \nAlthough Florence does constitute an intervening change in the law with respect to\nplaintiffs' federal claim and, as a result, warrants vacatur of the County's concession of liability\n8  Were the situation otherwise, perhaps it could be argued that the search at Burlington\nwas somehow legitimized as a precondition to his admission to the Essex County Correctional\nFacility.\n9  Article I, Section 12 of the New York State Constitution provides in pertinent part:\n“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon\nprobable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be\nsearched, and the persons or things to be seized.” \n25\n\nas to that claim, the same may not be said with respect to the state-based constitutional cause of\naction.  \nCounsel have not provided, nor am I personally aware of any New York case pertaining\nto strip searches conduced in a correctional facility challenged under Article 1, Section 12 or\nother provision of State law.  However, I have been provided with state decisions involving strip\nsearches done by police officers.  Those decisions demonstrate that, at least in that type of\nsituation, New York State Courts require reasonable suspicion as a precondition to strip\nsearching an arrestee charged with a misdemeanor or lesser offense under Article I, Section 12 of\nthe New York State Constitution.  See People v. Motherwell, 926 N.E.2d 1219 (2010) and cases\ncited therein.     \nHow New York courts will decide a case factually analogous to the one at bar under\nArticle I, Section 12 remains to be seen.  That they might not adopt the Florence rationale is\ncertainly well within the realm of possibility.  The New York Court of Appeals has noted that:\n[w]e have on many occasions interpreted are own Constitution to\nprovide greater protection when circumstances warrant and have\ndeveloped an independent body of state law in the area of search\nand seizure . . . . We have adopted separate standards when doing\nso best promotes predictability and precision in judicial review of\nsearch and seizure cases and the protection of the individual rights\nof our citizens.”  \nPeople v. Weaver, 909 N.E.2d 1195, 1202 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citations\ndeleted); see also People v. Dunn, 564 N.E.2d 1054 (1980). \nFor the reasons indicated, plaintiffs' present class action, insofar as it is based on a\npurported violation of the New York State Constitution remains viable notwithstanding\nFlorence.  Therefore, defendants' application to withdraw its concession of liability as to this\n26\n\nstate-based claim is denied.\nCONCLUSION\nDefendants' motion to vacate the portion of the January 16, 2007 Order granting\nsummary judgment to plaintiffs as to liability is granted as to the federally-based constitutional\nclaim, and plaintiffs' “FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF,” brought pursuant to “42 U.S.C. §1983,” is\ndismissed with prejudice.  (Am. Compl. in Augustin et al v. Jablonsky et al, 99 Civ\n3126(DRH)(ARL) at 25.)  However, plaintiffs' state-based constitutional claim, i.e. their\n“SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF,” brought pursuant to “New York State Constitution Art. 1, §\n12,” id. at 26, is unaffected by Florence; accordingly, defendants' application to vacate the\nportion of previously identified summary judgment order with respect thereto and to dismiss the\nunderlying cause of action, is denied. \nSO ORDERED.\nCentral Islip, New York\nDated: July 18, 2013\n__________/s/_____________\nDENIS R.

Plaintiffs, who\nwere strip searched pursuant to the policy, appeal from a series of orders entered in the District Court for the\nEastern District of New York (Denis J. Hurley, Judge) denying their repeated motions for class certification on the\nground that individual issues predominated over common ones. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) (requiring that\n\"questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only\nindividual members\").\nDuring the course of class certification motion practice, plaintiffs requested that the District Court certify a Rule 23\n(b)(3) class solely on the issue of liability, as permitted by Rule 23(c)(4)(A). In response, defendants conceded\ntheir liability to plaintiffs. The District Court denied the motion. As an initial matter, the District Court expressed\nserious doubt over whether it could certify a class on the issue of liability since it already had determined that\nplaintiffs' claims, as a whole, failed the predominance test. Even if it could do so, the District Court reasoned that\ndefendants' concession removed common liability issues from the predominance analysis. With common liability\nissues so excised, the Court concluded that individual liability issues, such as the application of an affirmative\ndefense, predominated. The Court thus denied plaintiffs' motions for class certification on the issue of liability.\nThe precise issues on appeal are whether (1) a court may certify a Rule 23(b)(3) class as to a particular issue\nwhen it already has determined that the claim as a whole fails the predominance test; (2) common issues that are\nconceded remain part of the predominance analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion\nby failing to certify a class on the issue of liability. As set forth more fully below, we hold that (1) a court may\nemploy rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class as to an issue regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies the\n\n222 predominance test; (2) the District Court erred when it concluded *222 that defendants' concession eliminated\nliability issues from the predominance analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion by\nfailing to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A). Accordingly, we reverse\nthe District Court's orders dated September 23, 2003 and November 7, 2003 to the extent that they deny\ncertification as to the issue of liability, and we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nBACKGROUND\nIn 1999, the District Court for the Eastern District of New York held that defendants' blanket policy of strip\nsearching newly admitted, misdemeanor detainees violated clearly established Fourth Amendment law. See \nShain v. Ellison, 53 F.Supp.2d 564 (E.D.N.Y.1999),aff'd,273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir.2001). Although the policy has never\nbeen formally enjoined, Shain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211 (2d Cir.2004) (vacating injunction for lack of standing),\ndefendants assert that following the District Court's 1999 decision, they ceased implementing it.\nShortly after the District Court's 1999 decision, plaintiffs brought three separate actions in the Eastern District of\nNew York: Augustin v. Jablonsky, No. 99 Civ. 3126, O'Day et al. v. Nassau County Sheriff's Department, et al.,\nNo. 99 Civ. 2844, and Iaffaldano v. County of Nassau, No. 99 Civ. 4238. Together, plaintiffs named as defendants\nNassau County, Sheriff Joseph P. Jablonsky, the Sheriff's Department, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, the\nDivision of Corrections, the Port Washington Police District and its chief of police, William Kilfoil, and up to 200\nsubordinate John and Jane Doe corrections officers.\nEach action alleged that plaintiffs were arrested on misdemeanor charges unrelated to weapons or drugs and\nthereafter strip searched, without individualized suspicion, pursuant to the policy. Plaintiffs claimed that the strip\nsearches violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution, and Article 1, section 12 of the New York State Constitution. They sought compensatory and\npunitive damages, a declaration that the policy was unconstitutional, and an injunction barring enforcement of the\npolicy. They also sought to maintain each litigation as a class action.\nIn February of 2000, plaintiffs moved to consolidate all three actions and certify a unified class pursuant to Rule\n[1]\n23(b)(3).  Plaintiffs defined the class as follows: \"[A]ll persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses\nwho have been admitted to the Nassau County Correctional Center and strip searched without particularized\nreasonable suspicion.\" In an opinion and order dated March 8, 2001, the District Court granted that branch of the\nmotion seeking consolidation and denied that branch seeking class certification. See Augustin v. Jablonsky, No.\n99 Civ. 3126, 2001 WL 770839 (E.D.N.Y. Mar.8, 2001).\nThe District Court determined that plaintiffs satisfied the four requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality,\nand adequacy of representation. See Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(a). However, it denied certification for lack of common\nissue predominance. The Court recognized certain common questions, namely, (1) whether defendants\n223 maintained a blanket strip search policy; (2) whether that policy was unconstitutional; and (3) whether some or \n*223 all defendants may be held liable. Nonetheless, it determined that individualized issues predominated, in\nparticular: (1) whether subordinate Jane and John Doe defendants might escape liability in some cases because,\nnotwithstanding the blanket policy, they had reasonable suspicion to search certain detainees; (2) the existence\nof proximate causation for each alleged injury; and (3) compensatory and punitive damages calculations.\nThe District Court noted the possibility of sua sponte certifying a class solely on the issue of liability pursuant to\nRule 23(c)(4)(A), which allows for class certification \"with respect to particular issues.\" It declined to do so\nbecause it did not wish to \"undertake plaintiffs' burden\" to \"craft and submit a proposal,\" and because, as a legal\nmatter, it perceived \"considerable doubt as to the propriety of using Rule 23(c)(4)(A) in this fashion.\" In particular,\nthe Court relied on Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734 (5th Cir.1996) for the proposition that courts may\nnot employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to single out the issue of liability for class treatment unless the \"cause of action, as a\nwhole,\" first satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement. Id. at 745 n. 21 (emphasis added by District\nCourt).\nPlaintiffs moved for reconsideration. They first asserted that they would no longer seek judgment against\nsubordinate Jane and John Doe defendants. Since that modification would render the question of liability identical\n\nfor nearly all class members, plaintiffs next asserted that the Court should certify a class on the issue of liability\npursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A). They again defined the class as \"all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony\noffenses who have been admitted to the [Nassau County Correctional Center] and strip searched without\nparticularized reasonable suspicion.\"\nIn an opinion and order dated May 23, 2001, the Court agreed that plaintiffs' forbearance of their claims against\nsubordinate defendants \"removes the possibility of individualized liability determinations.\" \"To be sure,\" the Court\nacknowledged, \"the absence of individualized questions of liability militates in favor of partial certification solely\non that issue.\" It nevertheless denied the motion.\nThe District Court again noted its \"concern that partial certification might not be appropriate in the first instance\nwhere the cause of action, as a whole, does not satisfy the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).\" \"Even\nassuming\" that Rule 23(c)(4)(A) could be used in that fashion, the Court denied the motion because plaintiffs'\nproposed class definition \"would necessitate mini-trials just to determine class membership.\" In order to\ndetermine class membership, the Court believed, each would-be class member would have to show affirmatively\nthat he was strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion00a criterion that the definition incorporated.\n97\nThis burden was complicated by the fact that defendants claimed that they had ceased the blanket strip search\npolicy after the Eastern District's 1999 decision in Shain, and thereafter conducted strip searches only with\nparticularized reasonable suspicion.\nIn January 2003, plaintiffs renewed their motion for class certification as to liability and offered a new definition of\nthe class as follows: \"[A]ll persons arrested for misdemeanors or noncriminal offenses in Nassau County who\nthereafter were strip-searched at the NCCC pursuant to defendants' blanket policy, practice and custom which\nrequired that all arrestees be strip-searched upon admission to the facility ....\" (alterations incorporated). By\n224 referring only to the \"blanket policy,\" this new definition did not require plaintiffs to *224 show that reasonable\nsuspicion was absent in each case, and it excluded individuals strip searched after the 1999 Shain decision,\nwhen defendants ceased implementing the policy. Plaintiffs also reiterated that they withdrew their claims against\nindividual John and Jane Doe corrections officers.\nIn response, defendants conceded \"the one common issue\" that in their view \"might be appropriate for class\ncertification . . . namely, whether the NCCC's strip search policy during the class period was constitutional.\"\n(alterations incorporated). Specifically, defendants recognized that they \"are bound by Shain under the doctrine\nof collateral estoppel.\"\nThe District Court denied the renewed motion. In an opinion and order dated September 23, 2003, the Court\ndetermined that defendants' concession removed all common liability issues from its predominance analysis.\nAccordingly, the only liability issue that remained was an individual one: whether, notwithstanding the policy,\nsome plaintiffs were searched based upon \"reasonable and contemporaneously held suspicion.\" \"With the liability\nissue thus circumscribed,\" the Court wrote, \"certification as to that issue would not serve any purpose.\"\nInterestingly, the Court recognized that the individualized \"`reasonable suspicion inquiries' will be de minimis\" for\ntwo reasons: because defendants conceded that \"such an inquiry will only be sought regarding a limited number\nof plaintiffs,\" and because pursuant to United States v. Colon, 250 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir.2001), reasonable\nsuspicion must be possessed by some law enforcement officer at the time of the search and may not be\nretroactively imputed.\nPlaintiffs moved again for reconsideration on October 2, 2003. In an opinion and order dated November 7, 2003,\nthe District Court adhered to its earlier determinations and also concluded00for the first time00 that for the same\n97 97\nreasons informing its predominance analysis, plaintiffs failed to satisfy another one of Rule 23(b)(3)'s\nrequirements, specifically, that the proposed class action be \"superior to other available methods for the fair and\nefficient adjudication of the controversy.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). In one last effort to \"determine if its decision was\nin some other way improper,\" the Court examined the policies of efficiency and uniformity animating Rule 23, and\nconcluded that they did not favor certification. The Court also noted that individual plaintiffs would have little\ntrouble securing counsel to pursue their claims because their damages likely would be large enough to provide\nthe necessary economic incentive.\n\nThe parties later reached a settlement in which defendants paid the lump sum of $350,000 to the ten plaintiffs,\nwho agreed to split the funds equally. Plaintiffs reserved their right to appeal the District Court's orders denying\n[2]\nclass certification, which they timely exercised.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Standard of Review\nWe review the District Court's denial of class certification for abuse of discretion. Robinson v. Metro-North\nCommuter R.R. Co., 267 F.3d 147, 162 (2d Cir.2001). However, we \"review de novo the district court's\nconclusions of law that informed its decision to deny class certification.\" Parker v. Time Warner Entm't Co., 331\n225 F.3d 13, 18 (2d Cir.2003) (quotation *225 marks omitted). Further, we are \"noticeably less deferential when the\ndistrict court has denied class status than when it has certified a class.\" Id. (quotation marks omitted and\nalterations incorporated); Robinson, 267 F.3d at 162. We note that while the application of the incorrect legal\nprinciple often necessitates reversal under the \"abuse of discretion\" standard, such reversal need not indicate\nany \"abuse\" by the District Court as that word is commonly understood. See Zervos v. Verizon N.Y., Inc., 252\nF.3d 163, 168-69 & nn. 4-6 (2d Cir.2001) (distinguishing among various meanings of \"abuse of discretion\").\nII. The Requirements and Purpose of Rule 23(b)(3)\nIn order to achieve class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs must (1) satisfy the four requirements of\nRule 23(a), which are numerosity, typicality, commonality, and adequacy of representation; (2) demonstrate that\ncommon \"questions of law or fact\" predominate over \"any questions affecting only individual members\"; and (3)\nestablish that the class action mechanism is \"superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\nadjudication of the controversy.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).\nAs a general matter, the \"Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently\ncohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.\" In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124,\n136 (2d Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted). The Rule \"encompasses those cases in which a class action would\nachieve economies of time, effort, and expense, and promote uniformity of decision as to persons similarly\nsituated, without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3)\nadv. comm. n. to 1966 amend.\nIn light of these purposes, we have set forth that although \"a defense may arise and may affect different class\nmembers differently, [this occurrence] does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common\nones.\" In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 138 (internal quotation marks omitted). So \"long as a sufficient constellation\nof common issues binds class members together, variations in the sources and application of a defense will not\nautomatically foreclose class certification.\" Id. (quotation marks omitted and alterations incorporated).\nIII. The District Court Erred in Failing to Certify a Class on the Issue of\nLiability Pursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A)\nAs set forth more fully below, we conclude that the District Court erred by failing to certify a class on the issue of\n[3]\nliability.  We first conclude that, contrary to the District Court's reservations, a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4)\n(A) to certify a class on a particular issue even if the action as a whole does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s\npredominance requirement. Second, we hold that the District Court committed legal error in concluding that\ndefendants' concession eliminated common liability issues from Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance analysis. Third,\nthis error caused the District Court to exceed its allowable discretion in concluding that individualized liability\nissues predominated over common ones, and that the class action mechanism is not a superior litigation vehicle\nunder these circumstances.\n\n226  A. A District Court May Certify a Class as to Specific Issues\n*226\nRegardless of Whether the Entire Claim Satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)\nWhether a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class as to a specific issue where the entire claim does\nnot satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement is a matter of first impression in this Circuit. See Robinson,\n267 F.3d at 167 n. 12 (identifying question as one of first impression and declining to resolve it). It also is a matter\nas to which the Circuits have split. Id.\nThe Fifth Circuit has adopted a \"strict application\" of Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement. Id. Under this\nview, \"[t]he proper interpretation of the interaction between subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(4) is that a cause of action,\nas a whole, must satisfy the predominance requirement of (b)(3) and that (c)(4) is a housekeeping rule that\nallows courts to sever the common issues for a class trial.\" Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 745 n. 21\n(5th Cir.1996).\nThe Ninth Circuit holds a different view. Pursuant to that court's precedent, \"[e]ven if the common questions do\nnot predominate over the individual questions so that class certification of the entire action is warranted, Rule 23\nauthorizes the district court in appropriate cases to isolate the common issues under Rule 23(c)(4)(A) and\nproceed with class treatment of these particular issues.\" Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234\n(9th Cir. 1996); cf. Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 439 (4th Cir.2003) (holding that courts may\nemploy Rule 23(c) to certify a class as to one claim even though all of plaintiffs' claims, taken together, do not\nsatisfy the predominance requirement).\nWe agree with the Ninth Circuit's view of the matter. First, the plain language and structure of Rule 23 support the\nNinth Circuit's view. Rule 23(c)(4) provides as follows:\nWhen appropriate (A) an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to\nparticular issues, or (B) a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a\nclass, and the provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied accordingly.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(4) (emphases added).\nAs the rule's plain language and structure establish, a court must first identify the issues potentially appropriate\nfor certification \"and ... then\" apply the other provisions of the rule, i.e., subsection (b)(3) and its predominance\nanalysis. See Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 439 (reasoning that the rule's language provides this \"express command\"\nthat \"courts have no discretion to ignore\").\nSecond, the Advisory Committee Notes confirm this understanding. With respect to subsection (c)(4), the notes\nset forth that, \"[f]or example, in a fraud or similar case the action may retain its `class' character only through the\nadjudication of liability to the class; the members of the class may thereafter be required to come in individually\nand prove the amounts of their respective claims.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(4) adv. comm. n. to 1966 amend.\n(emphasis added). As the notes point out, a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4) when it is the \"only\" way that a\nlitigation retains its class character, i.e., when common questions predominate only as to the \"particular issues\" of\nwhich the provision speaks. Further, the notes illustrate that a court may properly employ this technique to\nseparate the issue of liability from damages.\nIn addition, as the Fourth Circuit has noted, the Fifth Circuit's view renders subsection (c)(4) virtually null, which\n227 contravenes *227 the \"well-settled\" principle \"that courts should avoid statutory interpretations that render\nprovisions superfluous.\" State St. Bank & Trust Co. v. Salovaara, 326 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir.2003). Pursuant to\nthe Fifth Circuit's view, \"a court considering the manageability of a class action00 a requirement for predominance\n97\nunder Rule 23(b)(3)(D)00[would have] to pretend that subsection (c)(4)00a provision specifically included to make a\n97 97\nclass action more manageable00does not exist until after the manageability determination [has been] made.\" \n97\nGunnells, 348 F.3d at 439. Accordingly, \"a court could only use subsection (c)(4) to manage cases that the court\nhad already determined would be manageable without consideration of subsection (c)(4).\" Id.\n\nFinally, we note that the commentators agree that courts may use subsection (c)(4) to single out issues for class\ntreatment when the action as a whole does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3). See 7AA Wright & Miller, Federal Practice &\nProcedure § 1790 (3d ed.2005) (stating that subsection (c)(4) \"best may be used to designate appropriate\nclasses or class issues at the certification stage\" so that \"the court can determine whether, as so designated, the\nother Rule 23 requirements are satisfied\"); 6 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 18:7\n(4th ed. 2002) (\"Even cases which might not satisfy the predominance test when the case is viewed as a whole\nmay sometimes be certified as a class limited to selected issues that are common, under the authority of Rule 23\n(c)(4).\").\nFor those reasons, we hold that a court may employ subsection (c)(4) to certify a class as to liability regardless of\nwhether the claim as a whole satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement.\nB. The District Court Erred When It Concluded that Defendants'\nConcession Eliminates Common Liability Issues from Rule 23(b)(3)'s\nPredominance Analysis\nAs noted above, the District Court reasoned that the major liability issues common to the class00whether\n97\ndefendants implemented a blanket strip search policy, and if so, whether they are liable for it00 were eliminated\n97\nfrom the predominance analysis by defendants' concession. Whether a concession can limit the predominance\nanalysis in that fashion also is a question of first impression. For three reasons, we conclude that a concession\ndoes not eliminate a common issue from the predominance calculus, and that the District Court erred in holding\notherwise.\nFirst, because the predominance analysis tests whether the class is a \"`sufficiently cohesive'\" unit, In re Visa\nCheck, 280 F.3d at 136, all factual or legal issues that are common to the class inform the analysis. See Amchem\nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 621, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997) (\"Subdivisions (a) and (b)\nfocus court attention on whether a proposed class has sufficient unity so that absent members can fairly be\nbound by decisions of class representatives.\"). In turn, an issue is common to the class when it is susceptible to\ngeneralized, class-wide proof. In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 136 (\"In order to meet the predominance\nrequirement ... a plaintiff must establish that the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof,\nand thus applicable to the class as a whole, predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized\nproof.\" (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration incorporated)); see also Heerwagen v. Clear Channel\nCommc'ns, 435 F.3d 219, 226 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that \"a plaintiff must show that those issues ... subject to\n228 generalized *228 proof outweigh those issues that are subject to individualized proof\"); Moore v. PaineWebber,\nInc., 306 F.3d 1247, 1252 (2d Cir.2002) (same). That the class-wide proof comes in the form of a simple\nconcession rather than contested evidence certainly shortens the time that the court must spend adjudicating the\nissue, but it does nothing to alter the fundamental cohesion of the proposed class, which is the central concern of\nthe predominance requirement. See 2 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 4:25 (4th\ned. 2002) (\"[T]he predominance test does not involve a comparison of court time needed to adjudicate common\nissues weighed against time needed to dispose of individual issues....\"); 7AA Wright & Miller, Federal Practice\nand Procedure § 1778 (3d ed. 2005) (\"[C]lockwatching is not very helpful in ascertaining whether class-action\ntreatment would be desirable in a particular case.\"). Similarly, the fact that an issue is conceded or otherwise\nresolved does not mean that it ceases to be an \"issue\" for the purposes of predominance analysis. Even resolved\nquestions continue to implicate the \"common nucleus of operative facts and issues\" with which the predominance\ninquiry is concerned. See Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[T]he fact\nthat an issue has been resolved on summary judgment does not remove it from the predominance calculus.\").\nJust as much as do contested issues, resolved issues bear on the key question that the analysis seeks to\nanswer: whether the class is a legally coherent unit of representation by which absent class members may fairly\nbe bound.\nSecond, Rule 23 seeks greater efficiency via collective adjudication and, relatedly, greater uniformity of decision\nas to similarly situated parties. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3) adv. comm. n. to 1966 amend. For these reasons we\n\nhave written that when plaintiffs are \"allegedly aggrieved by a single policy of defendants,\" such as the blanket\npolicy at issue here, the case presents \"precisely the type of situation for which the class action device is suited\"\nsince many nearly identical litigations can be adjudicated in unison. In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 146.\nEliminating conceded issues from Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance calculus would undermine the goal of efficiency\nby requiring plaintiffs who share a \"commonality of the violation and the harm,\" nonetheless to pursue separate\nand potentially numerous actions because, ironically, liability is so clear. Id. (noting that class action management\n\"problems pale in comparison to the burden on the courts that would result from trying the cases individually\").\nSuch a result also undermines the goal of uniformity by creating the risk of inconsistent decisions through the\nrepeated litigation of the same question; here, for example, each individual plaintiff would have to establish anew\nthat defendants were collaterally estopped by their prior concession and, if not, that defendants were liable on the\nmerits. Cf. Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc., 208 F.3d at 299 (concluding that because certification was \"necessary to\ndetermine whether the prior resolution carries res judicata effect with respect to purported class members,\" the\ndistrict court properly took account of \"the common nucleus of operative facts and issues, even though certain of\nthese already had been resolved\"). Although defendants have conceded liability to these plaintiffs, there is no\nguarantee that they would concede liability in a case or series of cases involving significantly higher damages.\nFurther, courts might differ as to whether, in light of the settlement, the requirements of collateral estoppel were\nmet, specifically, whether the issue of liability was \"actually litigated and decided\" and whether its \"resolution ...\n229 was necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits.\" Ball v. A.O. Smith Corp., 451 F.3d 66, 69 \n*229 (2d Cir.2006); cf. In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 429 F.3d 370, 387 n. 15 (2d Cir.2005) (\"[I]t is clearly\na permissible byproduct of settlement that future hypothetical plaintiffs might be forced to relitigate the same\nissues involved in the settled cases.\"); Marvel Characters, Inc. v. Simon, 310 F.3d 280, 289 (2d Cir.2002).\nFinally, we find further support for our view in the specific circumstances of this case. Defendants possess, but\nhave not disclosed, records of all the newly-admitted misdemeanor detainees strip searched pursuant to the\nblanket policy. Absent class certification and its attendant class-wide notice procedures, most of these\nindividuals00who potentially number in the thousands00likely never will know that defendants violated their clearly\n97 97\nestablished constitutional rights, and thus never will be able to vindicate those rights. As a practical matter, then,\nwithout use of the class action mechanism, individuals harmed by defendants' policy and practice may lack an\neffective remedy altogether. Cf. Deposit Guar. Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 339, 100 S.Ct. 1166, 63 L.Ed.2d\n427 (1980) (noting that in certain cases \"aggrieved persons may be without any effective redress unless they\nmay employ the class-action device\"); Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2004) (\"[F]or most strip\nsearch claimants, class status here is not only the superior means, but probably the only feasible one (one-way\ncollateral estoppel aside), to establish liability and perhaps damages.\"). Further, if defendants may utilize their\nconcession to defeat class certification, it would work the perverse result of allowing them to escape the cost of\ntheir unconstitutional behavior precisely because their liability is too plain to be denied. No other court has\nsanctioned such a result; nor shall we.\nAccordingly, we hold that defendants' concession of liability does not eliminate that otherwise common issue from\nRule 23(b)(3)'s predominance analysis, and the District Court erred when it concluded to the contrary.\nC. The District Court Erred in Determining that, as to Liability,\nIndividual Issues Predominated\nAs we have established, the District Court was (1) free to certify a class on the issue of liability notwithstanding its\nconclusion that the action as a whole did not satisfy the predominance requirement and (2) required to consider\nconceded common liability issues in its predominance analysis. We now apply these principles to the District\nCourt's opinion and order dated September 23, 2003 in which it denied certification on the issue of liability, as\nwell as that dated November 7, 2003 in which it adhered to its September decision. The class definition at issue\nwas as follows: \"[A]ll persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offenses in Nassau County who\nthereafter were strip-searched at the NCCC pursuant to defendants' blanket policy, practice and custom which\nrequired that all arrestees be strip-searched upon admission to the facility ....\" (alterations incorporated).\n\nAs noted, that definition obviated the need for individualized proceedings to determine class membership. The\ndefinition referenced only defendants' \"blanket policy,\" thus avoiding questions of probable cause and excluding\nindividuals strip searched after the policy's cessation. Since defendants possess records of misdemeanor\ndetainees strip searched during the policy period, determining class membership would be simple. In re Visa\nCheck, 280 F.3d at 142 (approving class certification where \"class members ... can be identified by defendants'\nown records\").\nThe class definition also implicated two broad common liability issues: whether the blanket policy existed and\n230 whether defendants are liable for its implementation. *230 The only countervailing, individualized liability issue\nwas whether, regardless of the policy, some plaintiffs were strip searched based upon \"reasonable and\ncontemporaneously held suspicion.\" The existence of this defense does \"not . . . foreclose class certification.\" Id.\nat 138 (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, as the District Court recognized, \"any such `reasonable\nsuspicion inquiries' will be de minimis\"; indeed, defendants set forth that \"such an inquiry will only be sought\nregarding a limited number of plaintiffs.\" In light of the pervasive character of the common liability issues and the\nadmittedly de minimis nature of individualized liability issues, we conclude that the District Court erred by holding\nthat individual liability issues predominated over common ones in its decisions dated September 23, 2003, and\nNovember 7, 2003.\nD. The District Court Erred in Concluding that the Class Action Device\nIs Not a Superior Litigation Mechanism\nFor Rule 23(b)(3) certification to be proper, a class action also must be the most \"fair and efficient\" method of\nresolving this case. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). In analyzing that question, courts must consider four nonexclusive\nfactors: (1) the interest of the class members in maintaining separate actions; (2) \"the extent and nature of any\nlitigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class\"; (3) \"the\ndesirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum\"; and (4) \"the\ndifficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.\" See Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). Contrary to\nthe District Court's conclusion in its decision dated November 7, 2003, all of these factors00as well as the reasons\n97\nset forth above regarding efficiency and fairness00favor class certification.\n97\nFirst, the class members have little interest in maintaining separate actions since there already exists a\nconcession of liability in this action and, without class notification, most putative class members will not even\nknow that they suffered a violation of their constitutional rights. Second, this action already has progressed\nsubstantially and, again, offers the benefit of a liability phase that can be resolved quickly and conclusively. Third,\nconcentrating the litigation in one forum simplifies and streamlines the litigation process. Fourth, we perceive little\ndifficulty in managing a class action on the issue of liability, especially since the District Court already has noted\nthat any individualized inquiries will be few and far between. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court\nerred in holding that a class action was not the most fair and efficient litigation vehicle under these\ncircumstances.\nCONCLUSION\nWe hold that (1) district courts may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class on a designated issue regardless of\nwhether the claim as a whole satisfies the predominance test; (2) conceded common issues remain part of the\npredominance analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion in denying Rule 23(b)(3) and\n(c)(4)(A) class certification on the issue of liability in its decisions dated September 23, 2003 and November 7,\n[4]\n2003.\n231 *231 In light of our direction to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to the definition set forth in the\nSeptember 23 decision, we also instruct the District Court to consider anew whether to certify a class as to\ndamages as well. The District Court should bear in mind that \"[t]here are a number of management tools\navailable to a district court to address any individualized damages issues,\" such as bifurcation, the use of a\n\nmagistrate or special master, alteration of the class definition, the creation of subclasses, or even decertification\nafter a finding of liability. In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 141.\nIn sum, we remand to the District Court with instructions to certify a class as to liability and consider certifying a\ndamages class as well.\n[1] Because motion practice on the question of class certification continued in various iterations for more than\nfour years, we describe only those aspects of the District Court's decisions that are relevant to our own.\n[2] Although these plaintiffs have settled their individual claims, they have reserved their right, in the event of a\nclass settlement, to \"seek or receive additional compensation for attorney's fees and [their] time and effort as ...\nclass representative[s].\"\n[3] We reach this conclusion without considering whether the District Court should have certified a class as to\nplaintiffs' entire claims00an issue that, as set forth more fully below, we ask the District Court to revisit in light of\n97\nour holdings.\n[4] Because we have found that certification as to liability is proper pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), there is \"no\nnecessity\" of addressing alternate grounds for certification, such as Rule 23(b)(2), that the District Court rejected.\nCf. In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 147 (declining to review district court's ruling on Rule 23(b)(2) certification after\nconcluding that Rule 23(b)(3) certification was proper) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, since we base\nour decision on the September 23, 2003 and November 7, 2003 orders, we need not consider the District Court's\nAugust 20, 2004 order, in which it rejected a radically different class definition for failure to satisfy Rule 23(a).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

We \nare writing regarding the conference scheduled before Your Honor on January 5, 2005. \nWe look forward to this opportunity to appear before you in an effort to settle this case \nprior to commencement of the trial on January 18, 2005.  Prior to the Christmas holiday, we \nengaged in some intensive and productive settlement conversations with defendants. It appears \nthat the primary obstacle to settlement at this juncture is the County's reticence to stipulate to \nthe individual named plaintiffs' right to appeal Your Honor's denial of class certification after \njudgment is entered pursuant to a settlement agreement. This is a significant issue, as we, of \ncourse, have a continuing obligation to represent the interests of putative class members as well \nas the individual plaintiffs. \nDefendants, on the other hand, gain nothing in refusing to stipulate on this issue.  Since \nthe individual plaintiffs would have the right to appeal denial of class certification after trial, \nstipulating to this right as part of settlement would leave defendants in the exact same posture as \ngoing to trial.  And significantly, stipulating on this matter would save significant judicial \nresources by avoiding a three week trial and would preclude the County's liability for significant \nattorneys fees that would accrue over the course of preparing for and litigating this lengthy trial. \nWe hope that Your Honor will be able to help the parties have a meeting of the minds on this \nIssue. \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 98      Filed 01/04/2005     Page 2 of 2\nBELDOCK  LEVINE  &  HOFFMAN LLP \nTo the extent defendants seek to delay the trial and amend the pretrial order to include \nnumerous additional witnesses, plaintiffs strenuously oppose this effort.  As Your Honor may \nrecall, by letter dated November 3,2004, defendants sought a lengthy adjournment of trial and \npermission to reopen discovery.  Your Honor did grant a short adjournment of the trial, but \ndenied defendants' request to reopen discovery, and nothing in this case has changed since that \nruling to warrant consideration of defendants' apparent renewed effort to seek discovery. \nMoreover, at the time the prior Joint Pretrial Order was prepared, all of the issues raised by \nplaintiffs' claims were clear.  Defendants have had several years to prepare this case; there is no \nreason that, on the eve of trial, defendants should be permitted to delay this matter and seek to \nadd witnesses they never had previously identified. \n'Ww \nR~rt \n1.

P. 58 advisory committee notes on 2002\namendments.\")  This is not to say that plaintiffs violated the\nseparate document rule under Second Circuit law via their\nsubmission or that prefatory recitation provided was inaccurate. \nI do not believe either to be the case.  But based on its\nproblematic character, the dispute between the parties as to its\ncontents will not be further discussed.  Rather, the first two\npages of the proposed judgment have been replaced by the Court\nwith a single introductory sentence consistent with the purpose\nof Rule 58 and the sentiment expressed by Judge Easterbrook in\nthe In re Cendant Corp. Securities Litigation.  \nDefendants' Objection to the Suggested Post-\n          Judgment Interest Rate in the Proposed Judgment\n1  Forms 31 and 32 have been renumbered and re-titled such\nthat currently, Form 70 is \"Judgment on a Verdict\" and Form 71 is\n\"Judgement by the Court Without a Jury.\"\n-3-\n\nPlaintiffs have included the New York post-judgment\nrate of 9% in the proposed judgment.  Defendants contend that the\nfederal interest rate set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1961 applies. \nNeither party provides authority for their position beyond\nidentifying the statutory provision believed to be controlling. \nNonetheless, a fair reading of Section 1961 viewed in conjunction\nwith established case law indicating that the Section applies to\ndiversity cases, support defendants' position.  Cf. Schipani v.\nMcLeod, 541 F.3d 158, 164 (2d Cir. 2008)(\"In a diversity case . .\n. . post judgment interest is governed by federal statute [, viz.\n28 U.S.C. § 1961(a)]\" and Plaut v. Estate of Rogers, 959 F. Supp.\n1302, 1309 (D.C. Colo,. 1997)(\"[T]he appropriate post-judgment\ninterest rate in all cases in federal court, including diversity\ncases, is governed by federal law.  The applicable rate is set\nforth in 28 U.S.C. § 1961, entitled 'Interest.'\").  Accordingly,\nthe proposed judgment has been modified by providing for post-\njudgment being assessed at the federal, not the state rate.\nDefendants' Objection to Provision in the\n          Proposed Judgment Ordering Payment of the \nAmount of the Judgment Into Court                   \nPlaintiffs' proposed judgment directs defendants \"to\ndeposit into Court the sum of $11,508,000 within 30 days of entry\nof final judgment.\"  (Proposed Judgment at 4.)  That provision\nshould be stricken, defendants argue, because it is unnecessary\ngiven the financial status of the County, as well as supposedly\n-4-\n\nirreconcilable with my earlier statement that no bond would be\nrequired to secure a stay of judgment should a stay ultimately be\ngranted by this Court.  (See Sept. 20, 2013 Tr. at 14, and Oct.\n18, 2013 Tr. at 21:20-21.)  \nPlaintiffs counter by observing that \"[t]here is a\nsignificant difference between not posting a bond for purposes of\nappeal and the provision of the final judgment requiring the\ndeposit of the judgment amount into Court.  What the County will\ndo after judgment is entered is a separate matter that has no\nbearing on the issue.\"  (Pls. Mar. 7, 2014 Letter at 2.)  The\nprecise nature of that distinction as a practical matter may be\nelusive for in each instance defendants are required to provide\nsomething of value – either a bond or cash — to assure that\nadequate funds will be on hand at the end of the appeals process\nshould plaintiffs continue to prevail.  Nonetheless, appealing a\njudgment with a concomitant request for a stay implicates a\ndifferent stage of the proceeding than the entry of the judgment\nitself.  \nWhen and if a stay of judgment is sought, the subject\nof the present dispute will become germane but not before.  And,\nbased on Nassau County's well-publicized financial challenges as\nof late, depositing the sums awarded for attorney's fees and\nexpenses with the Clerk of Court is appropriate and is thus\ndirected pursuant to the judgment which the Court has signed\n-5-\n\ntoday.\nContinued Payment of Administrative Costs by County  \nDefendants, in their March 5, 2014 letter, correctly\nnote that \"[t]o date, the Court has imposed administrative fees\n(such as copying and mailing of notices by the Class\nAdministrator) upon the Defendants.\"  (Defs.' Mar. 5, 2014 Letter\nat 3.)  That practice, defendants maintain, should now be changed\nbecause (1) \"[s]hould the County prevail upon appeal of the Final\nJudgment, it will not be able to recoup those expenditures,\" and\n(2) \"[b]ecause CPLR § 904(d) permits the Court to direct a\nplaintiff to bear the costs of class notices, and in light of the\nchange in law (at least the Federal law) with regard to\npermissibility of strip searches upon admission to correctional\ncenters, the Defendants' [sic] respectfully request that this\nCourt revisit its prior order and shift the future administration\nexpenses to the plaintiffs.\"  Id.\nIn response, plaintiffs argue \"CPLR § 904(d) is not\napplicable to this federal case, and even if arguendo it were, it\nwould not require imposing the costs upon plaintiffs.  The fact\nthat the federal claims were dismissed is no reason to shift the\ncosts of administration to plaintiffs in light of their having\nprevailed, upon the County's concession of liability 10 years\nago, on the state constitutional claim.\"  (Pls.' Mar. 7, 2014\nReply at 2.)  \n-6-\n\nPlaintiffs' assertion as to the supposed\ninapplicability of CPLR § 904(d) is presented as a supposed\ntruism.  However, since the soundness of that conclusion is not\nobvious to the Court, and in view of the absence of supporting\nauthority being provided, I have assumed, arguendo, that § 904 is\ngermane.\nSection 904(d)(I) provides that a court may, \"if\njustice requires,\" shift the cost of notification from the\nplaintiff with whom the onus would typically rest to the\ndefendant in whole or in part.  CPLR § 901(d)(I).  Although\nrelevant case law is sparse, Pludeman v. Northern Leasing\nSystems, Inc. instructs that the subject section authorizes\nplacing the notification costs with a defendant depending on \"the\nmerits of the action, the defenses thereto, and the resources of\nthe respective parties.\"  74 A.D.3d 420, 425, 904 N.Y.S.2d 372,\n378 (First Dep't 2010).  \nProceeding in reverse order, the County, even in its\ndiminished financial state, is presumably better able than\nplaintiffs – whose only link is the shared misfortune of having\nbeen arrested for a non-felony offense and then undergoing the\nhumiliation of being strip searched upon entry to NCCC – to\nshoulder the costs of notification.  \nAs far as \"the defense[]\" to plaintiffs' claims is\nconcerned, defendants conceded liability, i.e. that their actions\n-7-\n\ndid, in fact, violate each class member's constitutional right to\nbe secure in his or her person.  Basically what remains at this\njuncture is for class members to respond to the general damages\nnotice by filing a claim and, for those who intend to pursue\nspecial damages, to commence a new action for that purpose.  But,\nof course, the landscape has changed since defendants' admission\nof liability as a result of Florence and the dismissal of the\nfederal constitutional claim.  Still, the proposition that\nFlorence will serve as the vehicle (1) to erase their concession\nof liability, and (2) for the New York Court of Appeals then —\nunencumbered by the concession — to reconcile the subject strip\nsearches with the protections afforded to New York citizens under\nArticle I, Section 12 of New York State Constitution, is\nproblematic at best.  So yes, the County's prospects as far as\nmounting a defense are arguably better than pre-Florence, but not\nsufficiently better to shift the costs of notification from the\nCounty to the class.\nAnd as to the initial factor in Pludemane, viz. the\nmerits of the action, the observations just made about the\nstrength of defendants' defense to their admitted liability also\nsheds light on the strength of plaintiffs' remaining claim viewed\nas of this stage of the proceeding.  \nIn sum, defendants' arguments calling for the shift of\nthe notification costs from the defendants to plaintiffs are not\n-8-\n\nconvincing.  \nThis concludes the Court's explanation to counsel\nconcerning the changes made to the draft judgment submitted by\nplaintiffs.2  Attention will now be focused on the accompanying\nproposed notice and claim forms.  In that regard, the sequence in\nwhich the forms are discussed by the Court follows the order in\nwhich they are addressed in the County's March 5th letter rather\nthan by their respective exhibit numbers as recited in the\njudgment.  \nProposed Non-Book and Bail Draft Notice (Exhibit 3)\nThe word \"them\" has been deleted from the beginning of\nthe third line in the \"Summary\" portion of the Notice on the\nfirst page as requested by defendants.  However, defendants'\nobjection to the third bullet point which they categorize as\nproviding \"legal advice\" is found to be without merit.  Class\nmembers are entitled to be notified not only of the general\ndamages award but also of the other major benefit received by\nclass counsels on their behalf, i.e. the concession of liability\nand the anticipated effect of that concession on subsequently\ncommenced lawsuits seeking special damages.\nThe misspelled first word on the second page has been\n2  The other major items included within the proposed\njudgment submitted by plaintiffs which were challenged by\ndefendants in their March 5, 2014 letter, were addressed vis-a-\nvis the subject matter involved in this Court's Memorandum &\nOrder dated April 2, 2014 as amended on April 7, 2014.\n-9-\n\ncorrected to read \"were\" and the \"a\" immediately before the word\n\"previous\" has been deleted.3  \nProposed Book and Bail Draft Notice (Exhibit 1) \nDefendants' comments about the proposed Book and Bail\ndraft notice read in pertinent part:\n   In the third bullet point under Summary,\ndefendants object to the insertion of the\nterm \"to the best of your recollection.\" \nNotwithstanding discussions held two years\nago on the proposed notice language, over the\npast six months this Court and the parties\nhave spent considerable time discussing the\ncontents of the notices.  At no time did\nPlaintiff mention that these issues had been\ndefinitely determined in 2012.  It was,\nhowever, agreed and determined during the\nrecent conferences that the subjects of the\nBook and Bail notice and claim form would be\nrequired to attest under the penalty of\nperjury to the fact that they were strip\nsearched upon admission to the NCCC. \nInsertion of the phrase \"to the best of your\nrecollection\" is too ambiguous and invites\ndeception.  These individuals either were or\nwere not strip searched upon admission to the\nCorrectional facility.\n   Defendants [also] object to the legal\nadvice provided in the fourth bullet point,\nspecifically the statement notifying\nplaintiffs of the estoppel effect of the\nliability concession. \n \n(Defs.' Mar, 5, 2014 Letter at 4.)\nThe Court is underwhelmed by the objection to \"the best\nof your recollection\" verbiage.  In this Court's January 25, 2012\nOrder, it addressed the subject now under discussion thusly: \n3  This change has also been made to page 1 of Exhibit 1. \n-10-\n\n   The Court further proposes that those\nmembers of the class who have been identified\nas potential \"book and bails\" should be sent\nthe B&B Class Notice and a claim form in the\nformat submitted by plaintiffs, with . . .\nthe following modifications: In Section 3,\nwhich is entitled \"Certification and\nSignature,\" the sentence reading \"By signing\nthis form, I am confirming that the above\ninformation is correct\" should be deleted and\nreplaced with the following language: \"I\ndeclare under penalty of perjury that, to the\nbest of my recollection, I was strip searched\nat the Nassau County Correctional Center\nfollowing my arrest for a misdemeanor or non-\ncriminal offense on the dates listed in\nSection 2, above.\"  That sentence shall be\nfollowed with: \"I acknowledge that Nassau\nCounty may challenge my claim.\" \n   Any objections to or comments regarding\nthe proposals outlined above or the attached\ndocuments shall be filed on or before\nFebruary 3, 2012.  Any replies shall be filed\non or before February 10, 2012.\n(Jan. 25, 2012 Order at 4.) \nBy letter dated February 3, 2012, defendants advised\nthat they had \"no objections to the Notice and Claim Forms\nproposed by the Court for . . . the potential Book & Bails.\" \n(Defs.' Feb. 3, 2012 Letter at 1.)\nBased on the County's representation, I viewed — and\nstill view — the matter as resolved.  Incidentally, however,\ndeletion of the subject modifier to the attestation clause would\nlikely have an unnecessary inhibiting affect upon aggrieved\npersons.  Simply put, some members may be understandably hesitant\nto unequivocally swear under penalty of perjury to being strip\n-11-\n\nsearched upon admission to the NCCC during the class period if,\nfor instance, their experience was a decade or so ago and this\nwas not their sole strip search experience.  To the extent their\nattestation \"to the best of [their] recollection,\" is arguably\n\"equivocal,\" the County is hard pressed to legitimately complain\nsince (1) it provided the list of class members from its records,\nonly later carving-out possible book and bail exceptions to that\nlist, and (2) more importantly, it has the right to challenge the\naccuracy of any book and bail attestation.\nWith respect to defendants' objection to the fourth\nbullet point concerning purported \"legal advice\" being provided\nin the Notice, that issue was addressed earlier in reviewing\ndefendants' challenges to the Non-Book and Bail Draft Notice.\nProposed Non-Book and Bail Claim Form (Exhibit 4)\nDefendants advise that \"[t]his form is acceptable\nsubject to the objections [raised and decided] on the record.\" \n(Defs.' Mar. 5, 2014 Letter at 4.)\nProposed Book and Bail Claim Form (Exhibit 2)\nWhat I said earlier about defendants' objection to the\nphrase \"to the best of my recollection\" is hereby incorporated by\nreference.4   \n4  Parenthetically, the likely inhibiting affect of deleting\nthe subject language from this claim form is even more pronounced\nsince here the class member attests to having been strip searched\non a given day or days instead of sometime during the\napproximately three year class period.  \n-12-\n\nDefendants' request that the Court add the term \"upon\nadmission\" in the second line of \"Section 3\" is granted.  The\nterm shall appear in the modified claim form immediately after\nthe word \"searched.\"\nThe Court has also changed some of the language in\nSection 2 sua sponte.  In the proposed Book and Bail claim form,\nthat Section reads: \"Below are listed the booking dates for each\ndate of arrest for a misdemeanor or non-criminal offense from May\n20, 1996 through June 1, 1999 when you were strip-searched at the\nNassau County Correctional Center.\"  (Emphasis added).  Telling\nthe recipients of the form that they \"were strip-searched\" on the\ndates listed runs counter to the very reason that some of the\n17,000 believed class members were sent Book and Bail notices and\nclaims forms, i.e. to determine which of those individual-\narrestees were not strip-searched because they were released on\nbail prior to that part of the intake process being conducted. \nAccordingly, Section 2 will be modified by replacing the word\n\"were\" with the term \"may have been.\"  In addition, the box\nentitled \"Value of Your Claim\" under Section 2 has been deleted\nas confusing for essentially the same reason, as well as\nunnecessary.\nSection 3 has also been modified, sua sponte, by\ninserting \"one or more of\" in the second sentence immediately\nbefore the phrase \"on the date(s) listed in Section 2,\" coupled\n-13-\n\nwith a direction in Section 2 to \"cross-out (by putting a line\nthrough) any 'Line #(s)' which pertain to an arrest which did not\nresult in your being strip searched upon admission to the Nassau\nCounty Correctional Center.\"  The reason for this modification is\nthat arrestees within the Book and Bail category who had more\nthan one qualifying arrest did not necessarily have the same\nexperience on each occasion.  \nCONCLUSION\nThis Memorandum and Order has been written solely to\nexplain to counsel the reasons behind the major modifications to\nthe proposed forms presented by plaintiffs pursuant to my\ndirection.\nSO ORDERED.\nDated: April 11, 2014\n       Central Islip, New York \n_________________________\nDENIS R.

Hurley, Judge), denying plaintiffs' repeated class certification motions \n32  for lack of common issue predominance.  The District Court expressed \"considerable doubt\" as \n33  to whether it could certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A) when it \n34  already had determined that plaintiffs' claints as a whole failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 2 of 21\n1  predominance requirement.  The District Court further concluded that, even if it could do so, \n2  common liability issues that defendants had conceded no longer factored into the predominance \n3  analysis.  The District Court thus denied plaintiffs' motion to certifY a class on the issue of \n4  liability. \n5  We hold that (I) district courts may certifY a class on a particular issue regardless of \n6  whether plaintiffs' claims, as a whole, satisfY the predominance test; (2) the District Court erred \n7  when it excised common liability issues from it.~ predominance analysis due to defendants' \n8  concession; and, as a result, (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion in declining \n9  to certifY a class on the issue ofliability pursuant to Rules 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A). \n10  REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART. \nll \n12  ROBERT L.

Goldin, Deputy County Attorney, on the brief), Mineola, \n23  NY, for Defendants-Appellees. \n24 \n25  STRAUB, Circuit Judge: \n26  This appeal is the latest installment in a series of litigations over the Nassau County \n27  Correctional Center's (\"NCCC\") blanket strip search policy for newly admitted, misdemeanor \n28  detainees (\"the policy\").  Plaintiffs, who were strip searched pursuant to the policy, appeal from a \n2 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 3 of 21\nseries of orders entered in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Denis J. \n2  Hurley, Judge) denying their repeated motions for class certification on the ground that \n3  individual issues predominated over common ones. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) (requiring that \n4  \"questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions \n5  affecting only individual members\"). \n6  During the course of class certification motion practice, plaintiffs requested that the \n7  District Court certifY a Rule 23(b)(3) class solely on the issue of liability, as permitted by Rule \n8  23(c)(4)(A).  In response, defendants conceded their liability to plaintiffs.  The District Court \n9  denied the motion.  As an initial matter, the District Court expressed serious doubt over whether \nI 0  it could certify a class on the issue of liability since it already had determined that plaintiffs' \n11  claims, as a whole, failed the predominance test.  Even if it could do so, the District Court \n12  reasoned that defendants' concession removed common liability issues from the predominance \n13  analysis.  With common liability issues so excised, the Court concluded that individual liability \n14  issues, such as the application of an affirmative defense, predominated.  The Court thus denied \n15  plaintiffs' motions for class certification on the issue ofliability. \n16  The precise issues on appeal are whether ( 1) a court may certifY a Rule 23(b) (3) class as \n17  to a particular issue when it already has d-etermined that the claim as a whole fails the \n18  predominance test; (2) common issues that are conceded remain part of the predominance \n19  analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its allowable discretion by failing to certifY a class \n20  on the issue of liability.  As set fortb mor<! fully below, we hold that (1) a court may employ rule \n21  23(c )(4 )(A) to certifY a class as to an issue regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies \n22  the predominance test; (2) the District Court erred when it concluded that defendants' concession \n3 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 4 of 21\neliminated liability issues from the predominance analysis; and (3) the District Court exceeded its \n2  allowable discretion by failing to certify a class on the issue of liability pursuant to Rules \n3  23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A).  Accordingly, we reverse the District Court's orders dated September 23, \n4  2003 and November 7, 2003 to the extent that they deny certification as to the issue ofliability, \n5  and we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n6  BACKGROUND \n7  In 1999, the District Court for the Eastern District of New York held that defendants' \n8  blanket policy of strip searching newly admitted, misdemeanor detainees violated clearly \n9  established Fourth Amendment law.  See Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), \n10  a.ff'd,  273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001).  Although the policy has never been formally enjoined, Shain \n11  v, Ellison, 356 F.3d 211 (2d Cir. 2004) (vacating injunction for lack of standing), defendant~ \n12  assert that following the District Court's 1999 decision, they ceased implementing it. \n13  Shortly after the District Court's 1999 decision, plaintiffs brought three separate actions \n14  in the Eastern District of New York: Augustin v. Jablonsky, No. 99 Civ. 3126, 0 'Day et al. v. \n15  Nassau County SherifFs Department, et al., No. 99 Civ. 2844, and Ja.ffaldano v. County of \n16  Nassau, No. 99 Civ. 4238.  Together, plaintiffs named as defendants Nassau County, Sheriff \n17  Joseph P. Jablonsky, the Sheriffs Department, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, the \n18  Division of Corrections, the Port Washington Police District and its chief of police, William \n19  Ki!fbil, and up to 200 subordinate John and Jane Doe corrections officers. \n20  Each action alleged that plaintiffs were arrested on misdemeanor charges unrelated to \n21  weapons or drugs and thereafter strip searched, without individualized suspicion, pursuant to the \n22  policy.  Plaintiffs claimed that the strip searches violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Fourth, Fifth, \n4 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 5 of 21\nEighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article 1, section 12 \n2  of the New York State Constitution.  They sought compensatory and punitive damages, a \n3  declaration that the policy was unconstitutional, and an injunction barring enforcement of the \n4  policy.  They also sought to maintain each litigation as a class action. \n5  In February of2000, plaintiffs moved to consolidate all three actions and certify a unified \n6  class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3).'  Plaintiffs defined the class as tollows: \"[A]ll persons arrested \n7  for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been admitted to the Nassau County \n8  Correctional Center and strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion.\"  In an \n9  opinion and order dated March 8, 200 I, the District Court granted that branch of the motion \n10  seeking consolidation and denied that branch seeking class certification.  See Augustin v. \n11  Jabolonsky, No. 99 Civ. 3126, 2001 WL 770839 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2001). \n12  The District Court determined that plaintiffs satisfied the four requirements of \n13  numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n14  However, it denied certification for Jack of common issue predominance.  The Court recognized \n15  certain common questions, namely, (I) whether defendants maintained a blanket strip search \n16  policy; (2) whether that policy was unconstitutional; and (3) whether some or all defendants may \n17  be held liable.  Nonetheless, it determined that individualized issues predominated, in particular: \n18  ( 1) whether subordinate Jane and John Doe defendants might escape liability in some cases \n19  because, notwithstanding the blanket policy, they had reasonable suspicion to search certain \n20  detainees; (2) the existence of proximate •:ausation for each alleged injury; and (3) compensatory \n'Because motion practice on the question of class certification continued in various \niterations for more than four years, we describe only those aspects of the District Court's \ndecisions that are relevant to our own. \n5 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 6 of 21\nand punitive damages calculations. \n2  The District Court noted the possibility of sua sponte certifying a class solely on the issue \n3  of liability pursuant to Rule 23( c)( 4}(A), which allows for class certification \"with respect to \n4  particular issues.\" It declined to do so because it did not wish to \"undertake plaintiffs' burden\" \n5  to \"craft and submit a proposal,\" and because, as a legal matter, it perceived \"considerable doubt \n6  as to the propriety of using Rule 23(c)(4)(A) in this fashion.\" In particular, the Court relied on \n7  Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734 (5th Cir. 1996) for the proposition that courts may not \n8  employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to single out tht' issue ofliability for class treatment unless the \"cause \n9  of action, as a whole,\" first satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement.  Id. at 745 n.21 \n10  (emphasis added by District Court). \nII  Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration.  They first asserted that they would no longer seek \n12  judgment against subordinate Jane and John Doe defendants.  Since that modification would \n13  render the question of liability identical for nearly all class members, plaintiffs next asserted that \n14  the Court should certify a class on the issue ofliability pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4)(A).  They again \n15  defined the class as \"all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses who have been \n16  admitted to the [Nassau County Correctional Center] and strip searched without particularized \n17  reasonable suspicion.\" \n18  In an opinion and order dated May 23, 2001, the Court agreed that plaintiffs' forbearance \n19  of their claims against subordinate defendants \"removes the possibility of individualized liability \n20  determinations.\"  ''To be sure,\" the Court acknowledged, \"the absence of individualized \n21  questions of liability militates in fkvor of partial certification solely on that issue.\" It \n22  nevertheless denied the motion. \n6 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 7 of 21\nl  The District Court again noted its \"concern that partial certification might not be \n2  appropriate in the first instance where th(~ cause of action, as a whole, does not satisfY the \n3  predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).\" \"Even assuming\" that Rule 23(c)(4)(A) could be \n4  used in that fashion, the Court detried the motion because plaintiffs' proposed class definition \n5  \"would necessitate mini-trials just to determine class membership.\" In order to detemtine class \n6  membership, the Court believed, each would-be class member would have to show affirmatively \n7  that he was strip searched without particularized reasonable suspicion - a criterion that the \n8  defmition incorporated.  This burden was complicated by the fact that defendants claimed that \n9  they had ceased the blanket strip search policy after the Eastern District's 1999 decision in Shain, \nI 0  and thereafter conducted strip searches only with particularized reasonable suspicion. \nII  In January 2003, plaintiffs renewe:d their motion for class certification as to liability and \n12  offered a new defmition of the class as follows: \"[A]II persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-\n13  criminal offenses in Nassau County who thereafter were strip-searehed at the NCCC pursuant to \n14  defendants' blanket policy, practice and custom which required that all arrestees be strip-\n15  searched upon admission to the facility ....\"   (alterations incorporated).  By referring only to the \n16  \"blanket policy,\" this new defmition did not require plaintiffs to show that reasonable suspicion \n17  was absent in each case, and it excluded individuals strip searched after the 1999 Shain decision, \n18  when defendants ceased implementing the policy.  Plaintiffs also reiterated that they withdrew \n19  their claims against individual John and Jane Doe corrections officers. \n20  In response, defendants conceded \"the one common issue\" that in their view \"might be \n21  appropriate for class certification ... namely, whether the NCCC' s strip search policy during the \n22  class period was constitutional.\"  (alterations incorporated).  Specifically, defendants recognized \n7 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 8 of 21\nI  that they \"are bound by Shain under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\" \n2  The District Court denied the renewed motion.  In an opinion and order dated September \n3  23, 2003, the Court determined that defendants' concession removed all common liability issues \n4  from its predominance analysis.  Accordingly, the only liability issue that remained was an \n5  individual one: whether, notwithstanding the policy, some plaintiffs were searched based upon \n6  \"reasonable and contemporaneously held suspicion.\" \"With the liability issue thus \n7  circumscribed,\" the Court wrote, \"certification as to that issue would not serve any purpose.\" \n8  Interestingly, the Court recognized that the individualized '\"reasonable suspicion inquiries' will \n9  be de minimis\" for two reasons: because defendants conceded that \"such an inquiry will only be \n10  sought regarding a limited number of plaintiffs,\" and because pursuant to United States v. Colon, \n11  250 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2001), reasonable suspicion must be possessed by some law \n12  enforcement officer at the time of the search and may not be retroactively imputed. \n13  Plaintiffs moved again for reconsideration on October 2, 2003.  In an opinion and order \n14  dated November 7, 2003, the District Court adhered to its earlier determinations and also \n15  concluded-for the first time  that for the same reasons informing its predominance analysis, \n16  plaintiffs failed to satisfy another one of Rule 23(b)(3)'s requirements, specifically, that the \n17  proposed class action be \"superior to oth<~r available methods for the fair and efficient \n18  adjudication of the controversy.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In one last effort to \"determine if its \nI 9  decision was in some other way improper,\" the Court examined the policies of efiiciency and \n20  uniformity animating Rule 23, and concluded that they did not favor certification.  The Court \n21  also noted that individual plaintiffs would have little trouble securing counsel to pursue their \n22  claims because their damages likely would be large enough to provide the necessary economic \n8 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 9 of 21\n1  incentive, \n2  The parties later reached a settlement in which defendants paid the lump sum of $350,000 \n3  to the ten plaintiffs, who agreed to split the funds equally.  Plaintiffs reserved their right to appeal \n4  the District Court's orders denying class certification, which they timely exercised.' \n5  DISCUSSION \n6  I.  Standard ofR  eview \n7  We review the District Court's denial of class certification for abuse of discretion. \n8  Robinson v, Metro-North Commuter R.R. Co., 267 F.3d 147, 16:2 (2d Cir. 2001).  However, we \n9  \"review de novo the district court's conclusions of law that informed its decision to deny class \n10  certification.\" Parker v. Time Warner Entm 't Co., 331 F.3d 13, 18 (2d Cir. 2003) (quotation \nII  marks omitted).  Further, we are \"noticeably less deferential when the district court has denied \n12  class status than when it has certified a class.\" !d. (quotation marks omitted and alterations \n13  incorporated); Robinson, 267 F.3d at 162.  We note that while the application of the incorrect \n14  legal principle often necessitates reversal under the \"abuse of discretion\" standard, such reversal \n15  need not indicate any \"abuse\" by the District Court as that word is commonly understood.  See \n16  Zervos v. Verizon NY, Inc., 252 F.3d 163, 168-69 & nn.4-6 (2d Cir. 2001) (distinguishing \n17  among various meanings of \"abuse of discretion\"). \n18  II.  The Requirements and Purpose ofR  ule 23(b)(3) \n19 \n20  In order to achieve class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs must (l) satisfy \n21  the four requirements of Rule 23(a), which are numerosity, typicality, commonality, and \n2A  lthough these plaintiffs have se:~led their individual claims, they have reserved their \nright, in the event of a class settlement, to \"seek or receive additional compensation for attorney's \nfees and [their] time and effort as ... class representative[s).\" \n9 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 10 of 21\nadequacy of representation; (2) demonstrate that common \"questions oflaw or fact\" predominate \n2  over \"any questions affecting only individual members\"; and (3) establish that the class action \n3  mechanism is \"superior to other available methods for the fuir and efficient adjudication of the \n4  controversy.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(bX3). \n5  As a general matter, the \"Rule 23(bX  3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed \n6  classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by represeritation.\" in re Visa \n7  Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 136 (2d Cir. 2001) (quotation marks \n8  omitted).  The Rule \"encompasses those cases in which a class action would achieve economies \n9  of time, effort, and expense, and promote' uniformity of decision as to persons similarly situated, \nI 0  without sacrificing procedural fairness or bringing about other undesirable results.\" Fed. R. Civ. \nII  P. 23(b)(3) adv. comm. n. to 1966 amend. \n12  In light of these purposes, we have set forth that although \"a defense may arise and may \n13  affect different class members diffurently, [this occurrence] does not compel a finding that \n14  individual issues predominate over common ones.\" in re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at !38 (internal \n15  quotation marks omitted).  So \"long as a sufficient constellation of common issues binds class \n16  members together, variations in the sources and application of a defense will not automatically \n17  foreclose class certification.\" id. (quotation marks omitted and alterations incorporated). \n18  III.  The District Court Erred in Failing to CertifY a Class on the Issue ofL iability \n19  Pursuant to Rules 13(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A) \n20  As set forth more fully below, we conclude that the District Court erred by failing to \n21  certify a class on the issue of liability.'  We first conclude that, contrary to the District Court's \n'We reach this conclusion without considering whether the District Court should have \ncertified a class as to plaintiffs' entire claims-an issue that, as set forth more fully below, we \n10 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 11 of 21\nI  reservations, a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certifY a class on a particular issue even if \n2  the action as a whole does not satisfY Rute 23(b )(3)'s predominance requirement.  Second, we \n3  hold that the District Court committed legal error in concluding that defendants' concession \n4  eliminated common liability issues from Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance analysis.  Third, this \n5  error caused the District Court to exceed its allowable discretion in concluding that \n6  individualized liability issues predominated over common ones, and that the class action \n7  mechanism is not a superior litigation vehicle under these circumst<mces. \n8  A.  A District Court May Certify a Class as to Specific Issues Regardless of \n9  Whether the Entire Claim Satisfies Rule 13(b)(3) \n10 \nII  Whether a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certifY a class as to a specific issue \n12  where the entire claim does not satisfY Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement is a matter of \n13  first impression in this Circuit.  See Robinson, 267 F.3d at 167 n.l2 (identifYing question as one \n14  of first impression and declining to resolve it). It also is a matter as to which the Circuits have \n15  split. Id. \n16  The Fiflh Circuit has adopted a \"strict application\" of Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance \n17  requirement. ld.  Under this view, \"[t]he proper interpretation of the interaction between \n18  subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(4) is that a cause of action, as a whole, must satisfY the predominance \n19  requirement of (b ){3) and that ( c )(4) is a housekeeping rule that allows courts to sever the \n20  common issues for a class trial.\" Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 745 n.21 (5th Cir. \n21  1996). \n22  The Ninth Circuit holds a different view.  Pursuant to that court's precedent, \"(e]ven if \nask the District Court to revisit in light of our holdings. \n11 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 12 of 21\n1  the common questions do not predominate over the individual questions so that class certification \n2  of the entire action is warranted, Rule 23 authorizes the district court in appropriate cases to \n3  isolate the common issues under Rule 23(c)(4)(A) and proceed with class treatment of these \n4  particular issues.\"  Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir. 19%); cf \n5  Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs .. Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 439 (4th Cir. 2003) (holding that courts may \n6  employ Rule 23(c) to certify a class as to one claim even though all of plaintiffs' claims, taken \n7  together, do not satisfy the predominance requirement). \n8  We agree with the Ninth Circuit's view of the matter.  First, the plain language and \n9  structure of Rule 23 support the Ninth Circuit's view.  Rule 23(c)(4) provides as follows: \n10  When appropriate (A) an action maybe brought or maintained as a \n11  class action with respect to particular issues, or (B) a class may be \n12  divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the \n13  provisions of this rule shall then be construed and applied \n14  accordingly. \n15  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4) (emphases added). \n16  As the rule's plain language and structure establish, a court must frrst identify the issues \n17  potentially appropriate for certification \"and ... then\" apply the other provisions of the rule, i.e., \n18  subsection (b)(3) and its predominance analysis.  See Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 439 (reasoning that \n19  the rule's language provides this \"express command\" that \"courts have no discretion to ignore\"). \n20  Second, the Advisory Committee Notes confirm this understanding.  With respect to \n21  subsection (c)(4), the notes set forth that, \"[f]or example, in a fraud or similar case the action \n22  may retain its 'class' character only through the adjudication ofliability to the class; the members \n23  of the class may thereafter be required to come in individually and prove the amounts of their \n24  respective claims.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c){4) adv. comm. n. to 1966 amend. (emphasis added). \n12 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 13 of 21\nAs the notes point out, a court may employ Rule 23(c)(4) when it is the \"only'' way that a \n2  litigation retains its class character, i.e., when common questions predominate only as to the \n3  \"particular issues\" of which the provision speaks.  Further, the notes illustrate that a court may \n4  properly employ this technique to separate the issue of liability from damages. \n5  In addition, as the Fourth Circuit has noted, the Fifth Circuit's view renders subsection \n6  (c)(4) virtually null, which contravenes the \"well-settled\" principle \"that courts should avoid \n7  statutory interpretations that render provisions superfluous.\" State St. Bank & Trust Co. v. \n8  Salovaara, 326 F.3d 130, 139 (2d Cir. 2003).  Pursuant to the Fifth Circuit's view, \"a court \n9  considering the manageability of a class action-a requirement fur predominance under Rule \n10  23(b )(3)(D)- [would have) to pretend that subsection (c)(4 ) - a provision specifically included \nII  to make a class action more manageable ·-does not exist until after the manageability \n12  determination [has been] made.\"  Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 439.  Accordingly, \"a court could only \n13  use subsection (c)(4) to manage cases that the court had already determined would be \n14  manageable without consideration of subsection (c)(4 ).\" I d. \n15  Finally, we note that the commentators agree that courts may use subsection (c)(4) to \n16  single out issues for class treatment when the action as a whole does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(3). \n17  See 7A  A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1790 (3d ed. 2005) (stating that \n18  subsection (c)(4) \"best may be used to designate appropriate classes or class issues at the \n19  certification stage\" so that \"the court can determine whether, as so designated, the other Rule 23 \n20  requirements are satisfied\"); 6 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § \n21  18:7 (4th ed. 2002) (\"Even cases which might not satisfy the predominance test when the case is \n22  viewed as a whole may sometimes be certified as a class limited to selected issues that are \n13 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 14 of 21\nI  common, under the authority ofRule 23(c)(4).\"). \n2  For those reasons, we hold that a court may employ subsection (c)(4) to certify a class as \n3  to liability regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance \n4  requirement. \n5  B.  The District Court Erred When It Concluded that Defendants' Concession \n6  Eliminates Common Liability Issues from Rule 23(b)(3) 's Predominance \n7  Analysis \n8 \n9  As noted above, the District Court reasoned that the major liability issues common to the \nI 0  class - whether defendants implemented a blanket strip search policy, and if so, whether they are \n11  liable for it -were eliminated from the predominance analysis by defendants' concession. \n12  Whether a concession can limit the predominance analysis in that fashion also is a question of \n13  first impression.  For three reasons, we conclude that a concession does not eliminate a common \n14  issue from the predominance calculus, and that the District Court erred in holding otherwise. \n15  First, because the predominance analysis tests whether the class is a '\"sufficiently \n16  cohesive\"' unit, In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 136, all factual or legal issues that are common to \n17  the class inform the analysis.  See Amchem Prods., Inc. v.  Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 621 (1997) \n18  (\"Subdivisions (a) and (b) focus court att•~ntion on whether a pmposed class has sufficient unity \n19  so that absent members can fairly be bmmd by decisions of class representatives.\").  In tum, an \n20  issue is common to the class when it is susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof. In re Visa \n21  Check, 280 F.3d at 136 (\"In order to meet the predominance requirement ... a plaintiff must \n22  establish that the issues in the class action that are subject to generalized proof, and thus \n23  applicable to the class as a whole, predominate over those issues that are subject only to \n14 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 15 of 21\nindividualized proof.\" (internal quotation marks omitted and alteration incorporated)); see also \n2  Heerwagen v. Clear Channel Commc'ns, 435 F.3d 219, 226 (2d Cir. 2006) (noting that \"a \n3  plaintiff must show that those issues ... subject to generalized proof outweigh those issues that \n4  are subject to individualized proof); Moore v. Paine Webber, Inc., 306 F.3d 1247, 1252 (2d Cir. \n5  2002) (same).  That the class-wide proof comes in the form of a simple concession rather than \n6  contested evidence certainly shortens the time that the court must spend adjudicating the issue, \n7  but it does nothing to alter the fundamental cohesion of the proposed class, which is the central \n8  concern of the predominance requirement.  See 2 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg \n9  on Class Actions § 4:25 (4th ed. 2002) {\"[T]he predominance test does not involve a comparison \n10  of court time needed to adjudicate common issues weighed against time needed to dispose of \n11  individual issues ....\" ); 7AA Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure§ 1778 (3d ed. \n12  2005) (\"[C]lockwatching is not very helpful in ascertaining whether class-action treatment would \n13  be desirable in a particular case.\").  Similarly, the fact that an issue is conceded or otherwise \n14  resolved does not mean that it ceases to be an \"issue\" for the purposes of predominance analysis. \n15  Even resolved questions continue to implicate the \"common nucleus of operative facts and \n16  issues\" with which the predominance inquiry is concerned. See Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. \n17  Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[T]he fact that an issue has been resolved on \n18  summary judgment does not remove it from the predominance calculus.\").  Just as much as do \n19  contested issues, resolved issues bear on the key question that the analysis seeks to answer: \n20  whether the class is a legally coherent unit of representation by which absent class members may \n21  fair! y be bound. \n22  Second, Rule 23 seeks greater efficiency via collective adjudication and, relatedly, greater \n15 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 16 of 21\nuniformity of decision as to similarly situated parties.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) adv. comm. n. \n2  to 1966 amend.  For these reasons we have written that when plaintiffs are \"allegedly aggrieved \n3  by a single policy of defendants,\" such as the blanket policy at issue here, the case presents \n4  \"precisely the type of situation for which the class action devioe is suited\" since many nearly \n5  identical litigations can be adjudicated in unison. In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 146. \n6  Eliminating conceded issues from Rule 23(bX  3)' s predominance calculus would \n7  undermine the goal of efficiency by requiring plaintiffs who share a \"commonality of the \n8  violation and the harm,\" nonetheless to pursue separate and potentially numerous actions \n9  because, ironically, liability is so clear. ld. (noting that class action management \"problems pale \nI 0  in comparison to the burden on the courts that would result from trying the cases individually\"). \n11  Such a result also undermines the goal of uniformity by creating the risk of inconsistent decisions \n12  through the repeated litigation of the same question; here, for example, each individual plaintiff \n13  would have to establish anew that defendants were collaterally estopped by their prior concession \n14  and, if not, that defendants were liable on the merits.  Cf Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc., 208 F.3d \n15  at 299 (concluding that because certification was \"necessary to determine whether the prior \n16  resolution carries res judicata effect with respect to purported class members,\" the district court \n17  properly took account of\"the common nucleus of operative facts and issues, even though certain \n18  of these already had been resolved\").  Although defendants have conceded liability to these \n19  plaintiffs, there is no guarantee that they would concede liability in a ease or series of cases \n20  involving significantly higher damages.  Further, courts might differ as to whether, in light of the \n21  settlement, the requirements of collateral estoppel were met, specifically, whether the issue of \n22  liability was \"actually litigated and decided\" and whether its \"resolution ... was necessary to \n16 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 17 of 21\nsupport a valid and final judgment on the merits.\" Ball v. A.O. Smiih Corp., 451 F.3d 66, 69 (2d \n2  Cir. 2006); cf In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 429 F.3d 370, 387 n.15 (2d Cir. 2005) \n3  (\"[I)t is clearly a permissible byproduct of settlement that future hypothetical plaintiffs might be \n4  forced to relitigate the same issues involved in the settled cases.\"); Marvel Characters, Inc. v. \n5  Simon, 310 F.3d 280,289 (2d Cir. 2002). \n6  Finally, we find further support for our view in the specific circumstances of this case. \n7  Defendants possess, but have not disclosed, records of all the newly-admitted misdemeanor \n8  detainees strip searched pursuant to the blanket policy.  Absent class certification and its \n9  attendant class-wide notice procedures, most of these individuals - who potentially number in the \n10  thousands -likely never will know that defendants violated their clearly established \nII  constitutional rights, and thus never will he able to vindicate those rights.  As a prnctical matter, \n12  then, without use of the class action mechanism, individuals harmed by defendants' policy and \n13  practice may lack an effective remedy altogether.  Cf Deposit Guar. Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 \n14  U.S. 326, 339 (1980) (noting that in certain cases \"aggrieved persons may be without any \n15  effective redress unless they may employ the class-action device''); Tardiff v. Knox County, 365 \n16  F.3d I, 7 (I st Cir. 2004) (\"[F]or most strip search claimants, class status here is not only the \n17  superior means, but probably the only feasible one (one-way collateral estoppel aside), to \n18  establish liability and perhaps damages.\").  Further, if defendants may utilize their concession to \n19  defeat class certification, it would work the perverse result of allowing them to escape the cost of \n20  their unconstitutional behavior precisely because their liability is too plain to be denied.  No \n21  other court has sanctioned such a result; nor shall we. \n22  Accordingly, we hold that defendants' concession of liability does not eliminate that \n17 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 18 of 21\notherwise common issue from Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance analysis, and the District Court \n2  erred when it concluded to the contrary. \nc. \n3  The District Court Erred in Determining that, as to Liability, Individual Issues \n4  Predominated \n5 \n6  As we have established, the District Court was ( 1) free to certify a class on the issue of \n7  liability notwithstanding its conclusion that the action as a whole did not satisfy the \n8  predominance requirement and (2) required to consider conceded common liability issues in its \n9  predominance analysis.  We now apply these principles to the District Court's opinion and order \nI 0  dated September 23, 2003 in which it derJed certification on the issue of liability, as well as that \nII  dated November 7, 2003 in which it adhered to its September decisinn.  The class definition at \n12  issue was as follows: \"[A]ll persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offunses in \n13  Nassau County who thereafter were strip-searched at the NCCC pursuant to defendants' blanket \n14  policy, practice and custom which requin:d that all artestees be strip-searched upon admission to \n15  the facility ....\"   (alterations incorporated). \n16  As noted, that definition obviated the need for individualized proceedings to determine \n17  class membership.  The definition referenced only defendants' \"blanket policy,\" thus avoiding \n18  questions of probable cause and excluding individuals strip searched after the policy's cessation. \n19  Since defendants possess records of misdemeanor detainees strip searched during the policy \n20  period, determining class membership would be simple. In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 142 \n21  (approving class certification where \"class members ... can be identified by defendants' own \n22  records\"}. \n23  The class definition also implicated two broad common liability issues: whether the \n18 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 19 of 21\nblanket policy existed and whether defendants are liable for its implementation.  The only \n2  countervailing, individualized liability issue was whether, regardless of the policy, some \n3  plaintiffs were strip searched based upon \"reasonable and contemporaneously held suspicion.\" \n4  The existence of this defense does \"not ... foreclose class certification.\" Id. at 138 (internal \n5  quotation marks omitted).  Further, as the District Court recognized, \"any such 'reasonable \n6  suspicion inquiries' will be de minimis\"; indeed, defendants set forth that \"such an inquiry will \n7  only be sought regarding a limited number of plaintiffs.\"  In light of the pervasive character of \n8  the common liability issues and the admittedly de minimis nature of individualized liability \n9  issues, we conclude that the District Court erred by holding that individual liability issues \n10  predominated over common ones in its decisions dated September 23, 2003, and November 7, \n11  2003. \n12  D.  The District Court Erred in Concluding that the Class Action Device Is Not a \n13  Superior Litigation Mechanism \n14 \n15  For Rule 23(b)(3) certification to be proper, a class action also must be the most \"fair and \n16  efficient\" method of resolving this case.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).  In analyzing that question, \n17  courts must consider four nonexclusive factors: (I) the interest of the class members in \n18  maintaining separate actions; (2) \"the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the \n19  controversy already commenced by or against members of the class\"; (3) \"the desirability or \n20  undesirability of concentrating the litigation ofthe claims in the particular forum\"; and (4) \"the \n21  difficulties likely to he encountered in the management of a class action.\" See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n22  23(b)(3).  Contrary to the District Court's conclusion in its decision dated November 7, 2003, all \n23  of these factors -as well as the reasons set forth above regarding efficiency and fairness - favor \n19 \n\n•  Case 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 20 of 21\nI  class certification. \n2  First, the class members have little interest in maintaining separate actions since there \n3  already exists a concession of liability in this action and, without class notification, most putative \n4  class members will not even know that they suffered a violation of their constitutional rights. \nS  Second, this action already has progress<~d substantially and, again, offers the benefit of a liability \n6  phase that can be resolved quickly and conclusively. Third, concentrating the litigation in one \n7  forum simplifies and streamlines the litigation process.  Fourth, we perceive little difficulty in \n8  managing a class action on the issue of liability, especially since the District Court already has \n9  noted that any individualized inquiries will be few and fur between.  Accordingly, we conclude \n10  that the District Court erred in holding that a class action was not the most fair and efficient \n1 I  litigation vehicle under these circumstances. \n12  CONCLUSION \n13  We hold that (1) district courts may employ Rule 23(c)(4)(A) to certify a class on a \n14  designated issue regardless of whether the claim as a whole satisfies the predominance test; (2) \n15  conceded common issues remain part of the predominance analysis; and (3) the District Court \n16  exceeded its allowable discretion in denying Rule 23(b)(3) and (c)(4)(A) class certification on the \n17  issue ofliability in its decisions dated September 23, 2003 and November 7, 2003.' \n4Because we have found that certification as to liability is proper pursuant to Rnle \n23(b) (3), there is \"no necessity\" of addressing alternate grounds for certification, such as Rule \n23(b)(2), that the District Court rejected.  Cf. In re VIsa Check, 280 F.3d at 147 (declining to \nreview district court's ruling on Rule 23(b)(2) certification after concluding that Rule 23(b)(3) \ncertification was proper) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, since we base our decision \non the September 23, 2003 and November 7, 2003 orders, we need not consider the District \nCourt's August 20, 2004 order, in which it rejected a radically different class definition for \nfailure to satisfy Rule 23(a). \n20 \n\n• \nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 119-2      Filed 10/10/2006     Page 21 of 21\nIn light of our direction to certifY a class on the issue of liability pursuant to the definition \n2  set forth in the September 23 decision, we also instruct the District Court to consider anew \n3  whether to certifY a class as to damages as well.  The District Court should bear in mind that \n4  \"[t]here are a number of management tools available to a district court to address any \n5  individualized damages issues,\" such as bifurcation, the use of a magistrate or special master, \n6  alteration of the class definition, the creation of subclasses, or even decertification after a finding \n7  of liability.  In re Visa Check, 280 F.3d at 141. \n8  In sum, we remand to the District Court with instructions to certifY a class as to liability \n9  and consider certifYing a damages class as well. \n21 ",

Saffran, Esq.\n           Liora Ben-Sorek, Esq.     \nHURLEY, Senior District Judge\nThe captioned case, a class action,1 was tried before\n1  The class definition is “all persons arrested for\nmisdemeanors or non-criminal offenses in Nassau County who\n\nme, non-jury, on the issue of general damages sustained by\nclass members as a result of being unconstitutionally2 strip\nsearched at the Nassau County Correctional Center (“NCCC”)\nfollowing their arrests for non-criminal offenses and/or\nmisdemeanors.\n  The purpose of this decision is to provide my\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 52.\nBACKGROUND\nAfter extensive pretrial motion practice, including\nnumerous unsuccessful efforts to achieve class certification,\nplaintiffs, proffering a reconfigured proposed class\ndefinition, requested certification pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(3) or, in the alternative, for partial certification as\nthereafter were strip searched at the Nassau County Correctional\nCenter pursuant to defendants’ blanket policy, practice and\ncustom which required that all arrestees be strip-searched upon\nadmission to the facility, from May 20, 1996 until and including\nJune 1, 1999.”  (Jan. 16, 2007 Order at 2.) \n2  In 1999, the Hon. Leonard D. Wexler of the Eastern\nDistrict of New York held that Nassau County’s blanket policy of\nstrip searching all newly admitted misdemeanor and non-criminal\ncharged detainees at the NCCC violated clearly established Fourth\nAmendment law.  Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y.\n1999), aff’d in part and remanded in part, 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir.\n2001).  Following Judge Wexler’s 1999 decision, Nassau County\nreported that it “had officially ended its blanket strip search\npolicy.”  Shain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211, 214 (2d Cir. 2004). \nAnd, as explained in the text, infra, defendants in the present\ncase have conceded liability as to subject strip searches leaving\nsolely the issue of damages to be resolved.  \n-2-\n\nto liability pursuant to then Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4)(A). \nDefendants countered by conceding liability, acknowledging that\nthe strip searches of the class members for non-felony offenses\nwere conducted — with a few possible exceptions which were\nnever pursued – absent reasonable suspicion to believe that\nsuch arrestees had contraband on their persons upon admissions\nto the NCCC.\n   Based on defendants’ concession, I deleted the\nliability issue from the certification analysis and found that\nthe damages sustained by the various class members required\nindividual analysis, i.e. did not lend themselves to class\ntreatment.  My resulting orders denying the requested relief,\nas well as reconsideration of that denial — dated September 23,\n2003 and November 7, 2003 — were appealed by plaintiffs to the\nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals.  The Circuit, by decision\ndated August 24, 2006, reversed those orders “to the extent\nthey denied certification as to the issue of liability,” In re\nNassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 222 (2d Cir.\n2006), and directed me “to certify a class on the issue of\nliability pursuant to the definition set forth in the September\n23 decision . . . [and] consider anew whether to certify a\nclass as to damages as well.”  Id. at 231.  Accordingly, I\ncertified a class as to liability as directed, and also sought\ninput from counsel concerning the damages certification issue. \n-3-\n\nAs a result of that process, the Court, as detailed in its\nMarch 27, 2008 Memorandum and Order, reported at 2008 WL\n850268, concluded that the general damages sustained by each\nclass member attributable to the affront to human dignity\nnecessarily entailed in being illegally strip searched\nsatisfied the predominance requirement of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(3) and thus extended class certification to include\ndamages.   \nA jury trial was scheduled to begin on November 30,\n2009 on the issue of general damages with the special injuries\nsustained by individual class members to be resolved in a\nsubsequent damages phase or phases of the proceeding.  On\nNovember 26, 2009, counsel for plaintiffs and defendants\ncontacted chambers indicating that their respective clients\nwaived the right to a jury trial to the extent of placing the\ngeneral damages determination in my hands.  The trial was held\non November 30, December 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, and 16,\n2009, with counsels’ post-trial submissions being finalized via\nthe filing of Defendants’ Amended Reply to Plaintiffs’ Proposed\nFindings of Fact on April 23, 2010.\nEvidence at trial was presented in various forms\nincluding the testimony of multiple class members describing \nthe strip searches to which they were subjected upon admission\nto NCCC, and of numerous correction officers detailing their \n-4-\n\nprocedures in conducting, cumulatively thousands of such\nsearches during the class period, with the goal being to\nprovide me with an understanding of the steps involved in the\nprocess as well as the surrounding circumstances.\nInitially my Findings of Fact will be provided,\nfollowed by Conclusions of Law including the general damages\nawarded per strip search.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1. Each class member was stripped searched by\na correction officer (“CO”) upon admission to NCCC following an\narrest for a misdemeanor or non-criminal offense absent\nreasonable suspicion to believe that he or she harbored\ncontraband;3 some class members, due to more than one such\nadmission, were strip searched on more than one occasion. \n2. All strip searches of new admittees took\nplace in the operations area on the first floor of the D\nBuilding at the NCCC in either the Male Clothing Room (“MCR”)\n3  All class members were necessarily strip searched given\nthe definition of the class.  However, the precise size of the\nclass has not yet been determined.  Although the parties agree\nthat the non-felony admittees during the class period, and\nconcomitant searches, total approximately 17,000 and 23,000\nrespectively, defendants contend that not all such admittees were\nstrip searched; some, as the result of the practice of “book and\nbail,” were released from the correctional facility after\nadmission but prior to a strip search being conducted due to bail\nbeing posted on their behalf in the interim.  (See Trial\nTranscript (“Tr.”) 1911:1-1912:4.)  That issue is presently sub\njudice.  \n-5-\n\nor Female Clothing Room (“FCR”) depending upon the gender of\nthe new admittee.  (Tr. at 784:19-25.)\n3. It is undisputed that a correction officer\nof the same gender as the inmate conducted each search.  \n4. The parties agree that about 15% of the\nstrip searched new admittees were female and 85% male.  (Tr. at\n1909:1-1911:9.)\n5. There was no written procedure or policy in\neffect at the NCCC governing the manner in which strip searches\nwere to be conducted, nor was the topic a subject of in-house\ntraining.  (See, e.g., Tr. at 943:7-944:19, 951:4-24, 1055:25-\n1057:3, 1058:12-15, 1186:6-9, 1187:6-9, 1301:10-12, 1803:11-14,\n1873:20-25, 1876:22-25; Pound Dep. Tr. (Court Ex. 4) at 106:19-\n107:2.) \nThe Court is mindful that in some of the above\ncited testimonial references provided in support of these two\nfactual findings, the CO witnesses — some of whom conducted\nhundreds of strip searches of new admittees during the relevant\ntime frame (Tr. at 826:22-25, 967:17-19, 1142:11-14) — did not\nrecall ever seeing a written document or having received in-\nservice training on strip searches as distinct from denying\ntheir existence.  However, the pervasiveness of the failure to\nrecollect such institutional guidance being furnished, viewed\nin conjunction with the absence of convincing, countervailing\n-6-\n\nevidence causes me to conclude that neither was provided. \nMoreover, managerial oversight as to the manner in which strip\nsearches were conducted appears to have been nonexistent.  (Id.\nat 944:16-25.)  \n6. Not only was there an absence of in-service\ntraining, none of the testifying COs recalled receiving\ntraining at the Police Academy on the subject. (See, e.g., Tr.\nat 1057:21-25, 1298:15-18, 1649:5-7.)  Some officers believed\nthey learned the procedure from colleagues (id. at 1058:16-21, \n1624:4-7, 1717:25-1718:3) and, in any event, all testified that\nthey developed their own procedure over time which was in the\nmain consistently followed subject to occasional modifications\nbased primarily on such factors as the age and/or physique of\nthe subject being searched. (See, e.g., id. at 827:5-12, 938:7-\n13 (Cpl. Keith Jorgensen: “Everyone has their own method of\ndoing it”); id. at 942:7-25, 1240:11-13, 1414:24-1415:1.)      \n7. Not surprisingly, given the absence of a\nwritten procedure or formal training, the manner in which the\nstrip searches were conducted varied from class member to class\nmember although there were common core elements.  For example,\nclass member Mary P.4 described the search to which she was\nsubjected on February 16, 1998 thusly: she was directed to, and\n4  Given the sensitivity of the subject matter, the Court\nhas elected to refer to testifying class members by their first\nnames and the first letter of their last names.\n-7-\n\ndid remove her clothes (Tr. 61:16-62:3), and then, as ordered\nby the CO, she “lifted [her] arms” (id. at 63:8-21), “lifted\nand moved her breasts up and then side to side” (id. at 64:1),\n“r[a]n [her] fingers through [her] hair” (id. at 64:17-18),\n“squat[ted],” “cough[ed],” “wiggled her toes,” “ben[t] over,”\n“cough[ed again],” and “spread [her buttock] cheeks,” as well\nas “st[u]ck out [her] tongue [and] move[d] it side to side.” \n(Id. at 64:23-65:6.)  For class member Heidi K., parts of the\nsearch occurred while she was clothed, with the CO beginning\nthe process by checking her hair (id. at 292:1-10) and visually\nexamining her opened mouth (id. 292:14-16).  Heidi K. then, as\ndirected, “undress[ed],” “st[ood] with [her] legs apart and\nlift[ed her] arms above [her] head,” “turn[ed] around . . .\nben[t] over and spread [her] buttocks.”  (Id. at 292:18-\n293:18.)\nThe strip searches of male inmates again\ndiffered inter se (both as to the number of steps and, to a\nlesser extent, the sequence in which shared steps were\nperformed), and from those experienced by their female\ncounterparts primarily because of physiological differences. \nThus, for example, class member Stuart S. detailed the steps of\nhis strip search upon admission to NCCC as beginning with the\ninstruction to “get completely undressed,” followed by\ndirections to “run [his] fingers through [his] hair,” “flip\n-8-\n\n[his] ears over,” “raise his hands straight up” and then “turn\naround, . . . bend over, and . . . spread [his] cheeks.”  (Tr.\nat 407:19-409:25.)  Class member Gregg W. reported that, after\nremoving all his clothing as directed, the CO “instructed [him]\nto go through a series of movements . . . [which he did\nstarting with] run[ning his] fingers through [his] hair,”\n“raising [his] arms above [his] head,” “open[ing his] mouth,\nrais[ing his] tongue [and] run[ning] [his] fingers between\n[his] gum and . . . lips,” and then “turn[ing] around . . .\nexposing the bottoms of [his] feet,” and “grab[bing] . . . and\nspreading [his buttock] cheeks.”  (Id. at 550:16-552:1.)  Class\nmember Christopher W.’s strip search testimony partially\nparallels that of Greg W.’s but he, unlike Greg W., was asked\nto “squat,” not bend over or “spread [his] butt cheeks.”5  (Id.\nat 1389:18-1390:21.)\nAlthough the steps involved in the strip\nsearches varied during the class period based on, inter alia,\nthe inmate’s gender, physique, and the identity of the officer\nconducting the search, each class member was made to endure the\ngross indignity of being required “to undertake certain\nmovements while he [or she was] naked” (Tr. at 938:21-24),\nunder the scrutiny of the searching officer to assure - as\n5  Christopher W., unlike the other class members who\ntestified, was called to the stand by the defense as part of\ntheir case.  (Tr. 1377:3-6.) \n-9-\n\nexplained in footnote 10, infra, - that no contraband was\nsecreted in any of the inmate’s orifices or elsewhere.   \n8. There is no credible evidence that a CO\never touched a class member during the search process.  In\nmaking that determination, I recognize that class members Heidi\nK. and Michael F. testified to the contrary with Heidi K.\nreporting that during her search on October 7, 1996, the\nofficer “put her hands through my hair” (Tr. at 292:9-10), and\nMichael F. testifying vis-a-vis the search of his person on\nJuly 29, 1997 that the officer “fluffed [his] hair . . .,\npatted underneath [his] arms [a]nd . . . pushed . . . each of\nthe ears forward” (id. at 653:1-15).  Although that testimony\ndovetails with one of the steps in the 1997 Lesson Plan to be\ndiscussed infra,6 given the absence of like testimony from any\nother search victims, and the credible testimony provided by\nthe officers of having never touched an inmate during a search\nprocess (see, e.g., id. at 831:20-25, 1007:14-18, 1631:7-19), I\nfind it is far more probable than not that the recollections of\nclass members Heidi K. and Michael F. of what transpired\nregarding those particulars over a decade before are\n6     The Court notes that while the lesson plan recites that\nthe searching officer should run his fingers or a wide-tooth comb\nthrough an inmate’s hair, CO Pound, the author of the lesson\nplan, testified at his deposition that he “would never do that.\n[He] would never put [his] hands on an inmate. The inmate would\ndo that.”  (Pound Dep. (Court Ex. 4) at 73:7-13.)\n-10-\n\nincorrect.7   \n9. Strip searches were conducted during all\nthree tours at the correctional facility, those being the\nmorning, afternoon, and evening tours.  The “vast majority of .\n. . searches occurred on the 1430 to . . . 2300 tour,” i.e.\n“the afternoon tour.”  (Tr. at 1163:5-11.)  During that tour,\nit was not unusual in the MCR for two, or possibly on\n“extremely rare” occasions, three officers to be conducting\nstrip searches of a like number of male inmates simultaneously\nor with a partial overlap in the procedures.  (Id. at 1170:2-\n11; see also id. at 996:6-12, 1807:1-5.)  It was far less\nlikely that more than one search would be underway at any given\ntime in the FCR (id. at 1370:23-1371:2), or that more than one\nCO would be present in the room during a search (id. at\n1254:22-25).\nFor both sexes, a CO only strip searched one\ninmate at a time.  (Tr. at 996:20-997:8, 1253:13-19, 1370:19-\n24.)\n10. For males, Cpl. Jorgensen testified, and I\n7  Neither the testifying class members nor COs were able to\nidentify the other with respect to any particular search.  NCCC\nhas essentially no records to fill that void by linking a\nparticular officer to a strip searched inmate.  Accordingly, each\nofficer testified based on the strip search procedure he or she\nused during the class period, with the class members relying on\ntheir memories to reconstruct the details of the subject\nsearches.         \n-11-\n\nso find, that the searches occurred while the inmate was\nlocated in a three sided stall, the rear of which was the\nsearch room wall, with the two side partitions being 5' 10\" in\nheight.  (Tr. 807:15-18.)8  The searching officer stood in\nfront of, and typically several feet from the stall opening\nduring the search process (id. at 1005:20-22, 1388:4-14,\n1630:15-21), thereby partially shielding the inmate from the\nview of others who may have been in the room during the search.\nThe situation for females was essentially the\nsame as for the males as to the size of the stalls (Tr. at\n808:4-7) and as to the searches being conducted while the\ninmate was in a stall.  \n11. In reaching the conclusion that strip\nsearches were conducted while the inmate was standing alone in\na stall, I considered the contrary testimony given by some of\nplaintiffs’ witnesses.  Although such class members as Heidi K.\n(Tr. at 291:21-25, 293:21-294:3, 295:12-16), Greg W. (id. at\n564:15-17, 568:21-23), and Christopher W. (id. at 1386:14-17),\ntestified that they were strip searched while in a stall —\nconsistent with the testimony of all defense witnesses to whom\nthe subject was broached — class member Kevin M. testified to\nhaving been searched while standing in front, not within a\n8  Each stall was also 34\" wide, with the entrance being 30\"\nin width given a two inch lip on each side of the front opening;\nthe depth of stalls were 48\".  (Tr. at 807:9-14.)    \n-12-\n\nstall.  (Id. at 173:8-174:22.)  At the time, according to Kevin\nM., three or four other inmates were going through the same\nprocess at the same location in his presence.  (Id. at 178:19-\n22.)9  And class member Mary P. reported, on direct, that she\nand a “Spanish woman” (id. at 55:9-11) were both directed\nsimultaneously, by the same correction officer (id. at 67:6-8),\nto remove their clothing while both inmates were “right next to\neach other” in “a very small stall” (id. at 62:9-25 (emphasis\nadded)).  To my inquiry as to whether she and the other woman\nwere in the “same stall,” she responded in a somewhat\nconvoluted fashion thusly: “[w]e were right next to each other”\nseparated by “6 inches,” coupled with the comment “[j]ust like\na board . . . [t]hat’s all . . . [no] door.”  (Id. at 67:21-\n68:4.)\nOn cross examination, Mary P. explained that the\n“board” was a partition separating two stalls (Tr. at 84:25-\n85:4) and that she was not claiming — notwithstanding her\nearlier testimony that “[w]e were in a stall, a very small\nstall” (id. at 62:25) — that both women were searched in the\nsame stall.  In any event, given, inter alia, the lack of\nclarity as to this critical part of her testimony, I do not\n9  Parenthetically, class member Oscar A. - discussed infra\nin text - testified that he did not see any stalls in the room\nwhere he was strip searched (Tr. at 481:21-23), even though it is\nuncontroverted that all male class members were strip searched in\nthe same room which room contained stalls.  \n-13-\n\naccept as accurate her rendition as to what transpired when she\nwas strip searched including where she was searched in relation\nto both the stalls in the FCR and to other women under\ndiscussion, or that one CO orchestrated both searches\nsimultaneously.    \nKevin M.’s testimony about himself and four\nothers being stripped while positioned side by side in front of\nthe stalls is similarly not convincing.  It fails to dovetail\nwith other evidence in the record I found to be credible, such\nas the testimony of Cpl. Weisdorfer and of Cpl. Jorgensen each\nof whom testified that he invariably used the stalls for their\nintended purpose, viz. to house an inmate during the strip\nsearch process.  (See Tr. at 1003:1-10, 829:4-9.)  To do\notherwise would serve no constructive purpose,10 and would\nraise the specter of a tense scenario becoming more so with a\nlikely diminution of the officer’s control of the situation.  \nIn sum, I find that the subject strip searches\noccurred in MCR or FCR stalls, i.e. not in front of or\n10  In so concluding, the Court has considered, and rejected\nas devoid of evidentiary support, the notion advanced by\nplaintiffs “that the primary purpose . . . of the strip search\nprocedure was to inculcate submission to authority rather than\nseriously to search for contraband in the bodily orifices of\nthose being strip searched.”  (Pls.’ Comments on Defs.’ Proposed\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (“Pls. Comments”) at 19.) \nTo the contrary, the purpose of the search was to see if an\ninmate was harboring contraband on his or her person.  (See,\ne.g., Tr. at 997:3-5, 1120:24-1122:1, 1585:9-12.)  \n-14-\n\notherwise outside the stalls.\n12. Notwithstanding my finding that the\nsearches occurred within the stalls, I reject the notion\nadvanced by the defense that “the stall provided complete\nprivacy from everyone other than [the] C.O. conducting the\nsearch.”  (Defs.’ Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\nLaw (“Defs.’ Prop. Findings”) at 3.)  From the evidence it is\nmore likely than not that other COs if in the room (as\ncertainly would not be unusual, for example, during a MCR\nafternoon search), as well as inmate workers and/or other new\nadmittees upon entering or leaving the area, saw class members\nin various states of undress.  That evidence includes not only\ntestimony of various witnesses concerning the layout of the\nstrip search areas and the usual locations of the strip search\nparticipants, but also a number of the photographs in evidence\nsuch as defendants’ UU5 (Tr. at 1667:1-22, 1672:8-13), as\nsupplemented by my personal inspection, with counsel, of those\nareas during the course of the trial.  Under the attendant\ncircumstances, surely some of the class members were viewed\nwhile being strip searched by others besides the officer\nconducting the search.  (See also, e.g., id. at 297:2-6 (given\nthat class member Heidi K. could see the CO at the desk during\nthe strip search presumably that officer could also see her);\nid. at 1635:3-25 (CO Rogers testified that he has seen inmate\n-15-\n\nworkers sitting at the desk in the MCR during the strip search\nprocess, i.e. being at the same vantage point as the CO\nreferenced in Heidi K.’s testimony); id. at 1665:13-23,\n1667:17-22.)    \n13. Although it is clear to me that class\nmembers were surely observed by individuals besides the\nsearching COs for the reasons provided in the prior paragraph,\nI do not accept as credible the testimony of Oscar A.\nconcerning that subject.  His testimony was less than a model\nof clarity.  Initially he seems to say that upon entering the\nMCR (Tr. at 467:4-5; see also id. at 486:6-9) he observed an\n“underdressed” inmate (id. at 467:10) in “the corner of the\nroom” (id. at 486:11) and was told that the naked inmate was\nbeing punished, coupled with a warning that the same punishment\nwould be inflicted on “whoever want[s] to be funny, you go,\nstand up naked in the corner of the room.”  (Id. at 495:4-14.) \nLater, Oscar A. explained that he saw the naked inmate before\nhe, Oscar A., entered the room, while he was in the “frame of\nthe door.”  (Id. at 492:5-6.)  Oscar A. also explained that\nwhen he spotted the naked inmate in the corner, he saw another\nman, apparently at the end point of being strip searched, “five\nfeet” from the first, so that the two were naked\nsimultaneously.  (Id. at 489:19-23.)  As noted in footnote 9,\nsupra, Oscar A. did not recall that the MCR had stalls, nor was\n-16-\n\nhis recollection refreshed upon being shown photographs of the\nroom.  \nThe scenario portrayed by Oscar A. is devoid of\nany support elsewhere in the record, and is directly at odds\nwith the credible testimony provided by CO Rogers (Tr. at\n1638:8-10), who signed Oscar A.’s clothing card (id. at 1636:1-\n1637:3), and accordingly, may, but not necessarily, have been\nthe searching officer or at least one of the officers on duty\nat the time.  Simply put, having observed Oscar A.’s demeanor\nand viewing this portion of his testimony in the context of the\ntotal evidence, I find that plaintiffs have not established\nthat this incident occurred or, incidently, that a strip search\nwas ever conducted during the relevant time frame at NCCC to\npunish an inmate.   \n14. In addition to not accepting the above\ndiscussed portions of Oscar A.’s testimony, Mary P.’s testimony\nabout her observing three men in the large room looking at her\nwhile she was undressed with respect to a later transportation\nsearch is not found to be credible.\nNot only is the relevance of what may have\noccurred during a post-admission transportation search\nproblematic with respect to the issue of general damages caused\nby class members being illegally strip searched upon their\nadmission to NCCC, but, as noted earlier, I have significant\n-17-\n\nreservations as to this witness’s credibility.  \nI find that no credible evidence has been\npresented to establish that one or more class members were\nlikely to be, or were observed by a member of the opposite sex\nwhile being strip searched upon admission to NCCC.\n15.  Several of the plaintiff class members\nobjected to the language and/or tone of voice used by the COs\nduring the strip search process.  (See, e.g., Tr. 179:22-180:1-\n20, 728:11-16.)   \nClass member Kevin M. testified that as he\nspread his buttock cheeks, as directed during his strip search\non March 29, 1997, the CO conducting the search said “that the\nboys are going to love this” (Tr. at 179:22-180:1-13), to which\nKevin M. responded “you must really love your job” (id. at\n180:14-18).  The exchange ended with the CO supposedly saying:\n“Shut the F up and get dressed.”  (Id. at 180:19-20.)  Kevin M.\nwas arrested and strip searched again at NCCC on April 23,\n1998.  (Id. at 199:17-200:12.)  The CO at that time, unlike his\ncounterpart a year earlier, was reported by the witness to have\nconducted the strip search in a professional manner, free of\nrude comments or remarks.  (Id. at 272:25-273:5.)\nAs previously explained, I do not believe Kevin\nM.’s testimony as to having been strip searched together with\nother inmates while positioned in front of stalls in the MCR. \n-18-\n\nMy reservations concerning his testimony as to that critical\nissue carries over to his testimony vis-a-vis the purported\nverbal exchange.  Simply put, plaintiffs have not established\nby a fair preponderance of the credible evidence that the CO\nwho conducted that search used the language ascribed to him by\nKevin M.  \nAs to the tone of voice employed by COs, the\nevidence fails to indicate that it was inappropriate given the\ncontext.  Even Kevin M., while unconvincing complaining as to\nwhat was said, explained that the general tone of the CO’s\ncomments, i.e. “bark[ing] orders,” was akin to the practice “in\nthe military” of issuing “quick commands.”  (Tr. at 276:2-24.) \nThat Mary Beth P. perceived the “demeanor or tone” of the\nfemale CO in her case as being “offensive” in the sense “she\nwas talking down to [her]” is certainly understandable under\nthe circumstances, that perception, while arguably germane to\nthe special damages portion of her claim, is insufficient to\nsuggest that the tone utilized by the COs was more\nauthoritative than required and, thus, should be deemed an\naggravating factor relevant for purposes of assessing general\ndamages.  To the contrary, I find based primarily on the\ncredible evidence provided by the testifying COs, that the\nsubject searches were conducted in a professional, business\nlike manner.  (See also id. at 350:11-25 (class member Heidi K.\n-19-\n\nacknowledges COs demeanor as being professional albeit “very\nauthoritative and commanding”); id. at 426:9-25, 588:17-25; id.\nat 698:24-699:11 (class member Michael F. describes CO’s\n“abrupt” demeanor as being a “no nonsense” approach).)         \n16. Class member Michael F. testified that the\nCO who strip searched him utilized a flashlight “to look in\n[his] mouth and ears.” (Tr. at 657:16-20, 700:19-701:1.)\nAlthough that testimony dovetails with one of the steps in the\n1997 Lesson Plan to be discussed infra, none of the COs who\ntestified said they were familiar with the 1997 Lesson Plan\neither as a result of his or her training at the Police\nAcademy11 or otherwise, and all the witnesses — both those\nsearched (except Michael F.) and those conducting the searches\n— either did not mention or denied that an officer used a\nflashlight during a search.  Moreover, a review of the record\nlisting Michael F.’s personal property at the time he was\nadmitted to the facility includes a flashlight, suggesting he\nsaw a flashlight that day but not in the hands of a CO.  (Id.\nat 887:3-7.)  That fact, coupled with, inter alia, his several\nearlier arrests and accompanying strip search or searches (id.\nat 686:16-25, 689:21-691:8), as well as the time lapse between\nthe search now under discussion and the time of his testimony,\n11  Each of the testifying COs attended the Academy prior to\n1997.\n-20-\n\ncauses me not to accept this portion of what he had to say.\n17.  Several male class members testified that\nthey were required to lift their scrotums during the course of\nbeing strip searched.  (See, e.g., Tr. at 2017:10-13, 2051:15-\n21.)  None of the testifying COs testified that that step was\nincluded in his search procedure.  However, it will be recalled\nthat none of the COs were able to definitively identify a\nparticular class member that he searched.  The testifying class\nmembers similarly could not identify the CO who strip searched\nthem.  There is no reason to believe that the testifying COs\nwere the only officers who searched male new admittees to NCCC\nduring the class period.  Although I have found that the COs\nwho testified endeavored to accurately depict their respective\nsearch procedures, any lack of synchronization between their\ntestimony and that of class members does not mean that either\nnecessarily fabricated what transpired.  Based on the trial\nevidence, I conclude that although a requirement that a male\ninmate lift his scrotum during a strip search was not the\nstandard practice, it did occur with some frequency.  In\nreaching that conclusion, I have considered the April 3, 2000\nDeclaration of Jerome P. Donahue, (“Donahue”) a Deputy\nUndersheriff in the Nassau County Sheriff’s Department. \nTherein Donahue avers that  “[t]he strip search procedure for\nall inmates charged with misdemeanors or less consisted of the\n-21-\n\ninmate being asked by the Corrections Officer to run both\nhands’ fingers through his hair to dislodge any contraband, to\nraise his arms exposing his arm pits, to grab his testicles,\nlift them and squat down to ensure that no contraband is hidden\nin his groin area and open his mouth and move his tongue.” \n(Donahue’s Apr. 3, 2000 Decl. (Court Ex. 3) at ¶ 13.)  That\ndeclaration was submitted “in opposition to plaintiffs’ motion\nto certify a class action.”  (Id. at ¶ 1.)12   \nIn arguing that the Donahue Declaration should\nnot be accepted into evidence and, if accepted, should be\nafforded little weight, defendants endeavor that supposedly\n“Donahue did not himself conduct any strip searches of new\nadmits during the class period,” that he “did not write or\ndraft the affidavit himself” and that during his trial\ntestimony he “acknowledge[d] that the reference to lifting\ntesticles was a mistake.”  (Defs.’ Prop. Findings at 15.) \nHowever, during cross examination Donahue admitted that he had\n“occasion to go . . . into the male clothing room as a\nsupervisor” and that he “saw strip searches being done . . . \nbut . . . didn’t observe them being completed.”  (Tr. at\n2102:6-21.)  He further acknowledged that he recalled signing\neach of the two declarations, viz. Court’s exhibit 2 and 3,\n12  Deputy Undersheriff Donahue submitted a like Declaration\nfifteen months earlier in Shain, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 in which the\nabove quoted language appears verbatim.  (Court Ex. 2, ¶ 9.)   \n-22-\n\nthat he read each of them for accuracy prior to signing them,\nthat he understood the declarations made were made “under the\npenalty of perjury,” and that his sworn statements were being\nsubmitted to advance defendants’ position.  (Id. at 2103:17-\n2104:15.)  He also acknowledged that he met with counsel “with\nrespect to the preparation of these documents [i.e. his\nDeclaration in Shain and in the current case].”  (Id. at\n2105:12-16.)  During an examination before trial he indicated\nthat he “understood that the statement about the strip search\nprocedure itself was based on [his] knowledge of how things\nwere done.”  (Id. at 2107:3-6.)  Under the circumstances,\ndefendants’ effort at trial and in their post-trial submissions\nto distance themselves from the witness’s sworn declarations is\nunavailing.13  \nIn sum, it appears that some class members were\nrequired to lift their scrotum as part of the strip search\nprocess.    \n18. Among the plaintiffs’ Proposed Findings of\nFact is the following: “If a person refused to submit to a\nstrip search upon admission, it would be met with a show of\nforce in which officers would come into the strip search room\n13  Cpl. Jorgensen testified at deposition that a direction\nthat an inmate lift his scrotum was “optional” (Tr. at 941:4-\n942:2), which calls into question the legitimacy of defendants’\napparent bright line denial that such a step, as testified to by\nseveral class members, was part of some strip searches.   \n-23-\n\nand surround the person to ensure that the person submitted to\nthe search.”  (Pls.’ Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions\nof Law (“Pls.’ Prop. Findings”) at 23, ¶ 89.)  Such episodes,\nhowever, may not legitimately be deemed part of the common or\ncore experience of new admittees at the NCCC.  CO Sutch, who\nprovided the information about shows of force to plaintiffs’\ncounsel during cross examination testified that he had only\nseen it happen three or four times during the class period. \n(Tr. at 1797:5-11.)  But beyond that, the testifying COs\nprovided the Court with their respective procedures for\nconducting strip searches without drawing a distinction between\nadmittees that were charged with misdemeanor or lessor offenses\nand those facing felony charges.  None of the class members\ncalled to the witness stand by plaintiffs’ counsel testified of\nexperiencing or witnessing a show of force, nor is there any\nother evidence supporting that a class member was subjected to\na show of force.  \n19. Concerning the duration of the searches\nfrom beginning to end, the time varied depending on a number of\nfactors including, inter alia, the amount of clothing worn by\nthe inmate, the inmate’s familiarity with the process, the\nspeed with which the inmate complied with the directions given,\nand again, the number of steps involved in the particular CO’s\nstrip search procedure.\n-24-\n\nThe thrust of the testimony of Cpl. Jorgensen\nwas that the whole process took more than a minute and could,\ndepending on the circumstances, take up to three minutes, and\npossibly longer.  (Tr. 937:14-20.)  Indeed, on cross, he\nacknowledged that it “could take up to ten or 15 minutes” (id.\nat 937:24-25), if “[t]he inmate . . .  [had] an infirmity, an\ninjury, [or was] an older person.”  (Id. at 971:24-972:9.)  CO\nSutch estimated that “[f]rom the time  [the inmate] started\ngetting undressed until the time [the strip search] was\ncompleted [was] . . . [f]ive minutes.”  (Id. at 1786:25-\n1787:6.)  He, like Cpl. Jorgensen, acknowledged that the\nprocess “could” extend to “fifteen minutes” depending on “how\nmuch clothes he was wearing, [and] how slow the process was\ngoing.”  (Id. at 1787:7-10.)  The strip search process, in CO\nWeisdorfer’s view, “generally took between 2 and 3 minutes.” \n(Id. at 1100:8-10.)  \nIn sum, I find that “the length of the strip\nsearch procedure varied depending on ‘a lot of variables,’ and\ngenerally ranged from three minutes to five minutes . . . .” \n(Pls.’ Prop. Findings at 20, ¶ 74.)\nDefendants do not take issue with that estimated\ntime frame.  (Defs.’ Amended Reply to Pls.’ Proposed Findings\nof Fact (“Defs.’ Reply”) at 17.)  Instead, their objection\ntargets the portion of plaintiffs’ proffer that grafts onto the\n-25-\n\nfive minute period the further claim that the strip search\nprocedure “‘generally ranged . . . [up] to 15 minutes for some\nnew admittees who were older or moved more slowly.’”  (Defs.’\nReply at 17, quoting from ¶ 74 of Pls.’ Prop. Findings.)  As\naptly explained by defendants:\nNo CO witness testified that the strip\nsearch procedure “generally” lasted 15\nminutes.  The testimony regarding “15\nminutes” was given in response to a\nquestion regarding the maximum time a strip\nsearch “could take” (Jorgenson [sic] and\nSutch).  This hardly qualifies as the time\na strip search “generally” took, and should\nnot be construed as the timing of the\ntypical new-admit search.  Additionally, it\nis clear that the estimates cited to by\nplaintiffs in this regard encompassed the\nwhole process of undressing, being\nsearched, and getting dressed again.  These\nestimates do not at all reflect the time\nthat the inmate spent unclothed or\nperforming the steps that comprised the\nactual strip search itself.\n  \n(Defs.’ Reply at 17.)\nThis takes us to the single most important\nfinding of fact for present purposes, that being the period of\ntime an inmate generally stood naked before the CO conducting\nthe search while going through the various directed\ncontortions.14  Here, again, estimates vary.  (See, e.g., Tr.\n14  The trial evidence on time of exposure was generally\nlimited to the time an inmate was totally naked.  Accordingly,\nthe estimates in the text are based on that evidence and not, for\nexample, to possible subsets of that condition such as how long a\nfemale inmate’s breasts were uncovered while other private parts\nof her anatomy were clothed.  \n-26-\n\n252:20-22 (class member Kevin M. — less than a minute); id. at\n425:25-426:5 (class member Stuart S. acknowledged that “from\nthe time . . . that the officer came to stand in front of [his]\ncompartment and started giving [him] the instructions that [he]\ndescribed, until the time [he was] able to put [his] underwear\nback on, no more than 20 seconds elapsed”); id. at 832:1-3\n(Cpl. Jorgensen testified that generally an inmate he was strip\nsearching would be fully unclothed for 10 to 15 seconds); id.\nat 1006:15-17 (CO Weisdorfer estimated that, pursuant to his\n“routine,” the inmate generally was “fully unclothed” for “less\nthan 5 seconds”); id. at 1396:8-11 (class member Christopher W.\n- naked for approximately one minute); id. at 1631:20-24 (CO\nRogers estimates from the time “they took their underwear off\nuntil time [he] handed it back to them [was, he] guess[es]\neight to ten seconds); id. at 1727:7-21 (CO Sutch testified\nthat typically an inmate familiar with the process would be\ntotally naked for “20 [to] 30 seconds” and for an inmate who\nlacked that familiarity “30 seconds to a minute”); id. at\n2074:12-14 (class member Jamar W. stated he was in “the state\nof undress” for less than 45 seconds); id. at 2145:18-2146:5\n(CO McGovern testified that inmates typically were fully naked\nwhen strip searched by him for “probably . . . 10 to 12\nseconds”; at his deposition he estimated the relevant time\nframe to be “a minute or two” (id. at 2147:6-8), but at trial,\n-27-\n\nCO McGovern explained that he believed his answer at deposition\nwas flawed and that “the fully naked portion of the strip\nsearch couldn’t have been more than 10 to 20 seconds” (id. at\n2150:9-23); see also id. at 2157:6-8 (CO Peletier said that\ntypically an inmate would be fully disrobed for “30 [seconds],\nmaybe a minute.”).)\nBased on the above testimony and other evidence\nadduced at trial, including the various steps that the\nindividuals were required to perform while naked and the\napparent time required to complete those steps, I find that the\nplaintiff class members were typically naked for approximately\n30 to 45 seconds. \n20. In reaching the conclusion regarding the\nperiod of time class members were typically naked, I\nconsidered, but ultimately rejected the testimony of class\nmembers Mary Beth P. and Michael F.\nMary Beth P. was strip searched on September 22,\n1996.  On direct, she stated that she was “fully naked” for\n“ten minutes.  Maybe a little less.”  (Tr. 730:10-12.) \nHowever, on cross examination, she was asked to go through the\nsteps of her strip search and to give an estimate of the time\ndevoted to each of those steps.  Upon completion of that line\nof inquiry, she conceded that the total time she was naked\n“might have been” less than ten minutes (id. at 740:10-12) and,\n-28-\n\nindeed, might have been a minute or less although she seemingly\nfound that shorter period problematic, explaining that she\n“d[idn’t] remember it being that short a period of time.”  (Id.\nat 740:5-9.)  Given Mary Beth P.’s uncertainty as to the time\nshe was totally naked, I attached little weight to this portion\nof her testimony.  Seemingly, plaintiffs’ counsel did the same\nfor her estimate as to this critical general damages element\ndoes not appear in their synopsis of her testimony (see Pls.’\nProp. Findings at 14-15), and is likewise absent from the\nparagraph in their submission dealing with the time class\nmembers purportedly “stood fully naked in front of the\nofficers.”  (Id. at 20-21, ¶ 75.)  \nMichael F. was strip searched July 29, 1997,\nwhen he carried approximately “310 pounds” on his “[f]ive-\nseven” frame.  (Tr. at 644:1-9.)  He testified, and I accept,\nthat there was no appropriately sized uniform readily available\nin the strip search room and, accordingly he was required to\nwait in a “separate room” for one to be produced from elsewhere\nin the correctional facility.  (Id. at 655:6-19.)  “[T]here\nwere two inmate workers in [that] room” (id. at 655:20-22),\nwhere he remained for “[a]round a half hour” while “still\nnaked” (id. at 656:1-13), at least until he was given his\n“underpants [which he] put on.”  (Id. at 656:17-19.)   \nI cannot discern from the record when his\n-29-\n\nunderpants were furnished, i.e. for how long he remained\ntotally unclothed during the strip search process.  Moreover,\nMichael F.’s experience represents an aberration from the\ntypical strip search conducted of NCCC new admittees during the\nclass period.  As such, its sole relevance, if any, is tied to\nMichael F.’s claim for special damages, not to the issue of\ngeneral damages.  And here, again, it warrants mention that\nMichael F.’s situation, while detailed in plaintiffs’ outline\nof his trial testimony, is not mentioned in their proposed\nFindings of Fact regarding the time period class members were\nnaked during strip searches they were illegally required to\nendure.  (See Pls.’ Prop. Findings at 20-21, ¶ 75.)  \n21. Before proceeding to the Court’s\nConclusions of Law, one last issue remains to be addressed: the\nadmissibility of the 1997 Lesson Plan, (Pls.’ Ex. 1), which\nplaintiffs sought to introduce into evidence at the trial.15 \nThe Court reserved decision on that application after hearing\narguments of counsel.  (Tr. at 2137:19-2143:24.)  \nSome background is in order.  The lesson plan\nwas developed by CO Pound (“Pound”) while an instructor for new\nrecruits using an earlier lesson plan he was given.  (Pound\nDep. at 44:11-23, 58:6-60:7.)  The lesson plan covered all\n15  The admissibility of the 1997 Lesson Plan implicates a\nmixed question of fact and law.\n-30-\n\nstrip searches, not just strip searches of new admits.  (Id. at\n70:13-22.)  It was not shown or distributed to the recruits. \n(Id. at 117:23-118:7, 135:13-136:3.)  According to Pound, he\nused the lesson plan as a “brief overview” (id. at 56:25-57:3,\n82:8-83:4, 127:13-22), modifying the plan as he taught (id. at\n96:20-98:3, 138:16-140:11, 143:22-144:10).  Pound never did a\nnew admit strip search (id. at 53:11-54:12); for the non-new\nadmit strip searches he did conduct, he often departed from the\nstrip search procedures set forth in the 1997 Lesson Plan. \n(Id. at 72:21-77:6.)  It was Pound’s “understanding” that the\nCOs conducting new admit strip searches “were using this\nprocedure one through seven” referring to the seven steps\nlisted in Phase III of the 1997 Lesson Plan.  (Id. at 72:2-16;\nsee also id. at 56:25-57:8.)  It is not clear whether Pound’s\n“understanding” was attributable to “personal knowledge,” Fed.\nR. Evid. 602, or otherwise.  \nPlaintiffs maintain that “[t]he only writing in\nexistence on the procedure to be used to conduct a strip search\nis the 1997 lesson plan authored by CO Pound[.]”  (Pls.’ Prop.\nFindings at 17.)  As such, plaintiffs seek its admission as a\nbasis for this Court to find that the searches conducted upon\nclass members comported in all material respects with the steps\nset forth in the lesson plan.    \nIn opposing the introduction into evidence of\n-31-\n\nthe 1997 Lesson Plan, the defendants have synopized their\nposition thusly: \nIn seeking to introduce into evidence . . .\nthe 1997 Lesson Plan, and then heavily\nrelying on it in their proposed Findings of\nFact, plaintiffs seek to draw the Court’s\nattention away from evidence that\ndemonstrates how the new-admit strip\nsearches were actually conducted and\nexperienced.  They essentially propose that\nthe Court should ascribe more weight to\nthat document as a description of the class\nexperience than to testimony by correction\nofficers who actually conducted the\nsearches of new admits during the relevant\ntime period — and they propose this despite\nthe fact that not one of their own\nwitnesses testified that the strip search\nhe or she experienced matched the procedure\nset forth in that document.\n(Defs.’ Reply at 10.) \nIn plaintiffs’ view, the 1997 Lesson Plan is\nadmissible as “an admission by the County as well as a business\nrecord . . . .”  (Pls.’ Letter dated Nov. 17, 2009, filed as\nDkt. No. 274, at 6.)  Proceeding in reverse order, the Court\nwill initially consider plaintiffs’ proffer under Fed. R. of\nEvid. 803(6) which is based on the following excerpt from\nPound’s September 30, 2009 deposition:\n   Q.  Let me try again.  I understand you\nwere handed a document similar to this that\nhad been prepared earlier and it was given\nto you by Sergeant Figliola?\n   A.  Yes.\n   Q.  But when you prepared this document\nfrom that document, did you do that\n-32-\n\npursuant to your duties and\nresponsibilities at the jail?\n   A.  Yes.\n   Q.  Did you do it in the ordinary course\nof your duties and responsibilities and\nbusiness at the jail?\n   A.  Yes.\n   Q.  Did you make and keep this document\nin the course of your ordinary business at\nthe jail?\n   A.  With the New York State Commission\nof Corrections lesson plan, yes.\n(Pound Dep. at 152:17-153:12 (referenced in Pls.’ Prop.\nFindings at 17, n.5).)\nThe answers given by Pound at his deposition are\ninsufficient to warrant the 1997 Lesson Plan’s receipt into\nevidence under Fed. R. Evid. 803(6).  That the witness, at\ndeposition, answered the leading foundational questions asked\nby counsel in the affirmative is not dispositive on the issue\nof admissibility when the concomitant substantive evidence is\nto the contrary.  In such a situation, form is necessarily\ntrumped by substance lest the purpose of the rules of evidence\nbe perverted.  See Fed. R. Evid. 102.  Here, Pound prepared one\nlesson plan during his multiple years of service.  The mere\nfact that the lesson plan was prepared while Pound was in the\nCounty’s employ does render his work product a business record. \nThe same is true of the predecessor plan upon which Pound’s\n-33-\n\nplan was modeled, the origins and use of which stand largely\nundeveloped.  The business records exception to the hearsay\nrule16 rests on the “regularity” and the “routine” embodied in\nthe preparation of the record sought to be introduced; the\n“record must [also] be made contemporaneously with what it\nrecords or reports.”  4 Fed’l Evidence § 8:77 (3d ed.).  Simply\nput, a juxtapositioning of the cited portions of the deposition\ntestimony of Pound and, incidentally, of Sergeant Harrs as\nwell,17 with the rationale underlying the business records\nexception indicates a misfit.  See Seattle-First Nat’l Bank v.\nRandall, 532 F.2d 1291, 1296 (9th Cir. 1976)(bank’s loan\nprocedure manual not admissible under the business records\nexception to the hearsay rule); Gonzalez v. City of Garden\nGrove, 2006 WL 5112757 (C.D.Cal. Dec. 4, 2006) (training\nmanuals inadmissible hearsay); see also 4 Fed’l Evidence § 8:77\n(3d Ed.) (“It seems that Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) does not embrace\noperating or procedural manuals . . . .  Such documents simply\ndo not fit the terms of the exception.  They do not report or\nassess particular matters . . . and the contemporaneity\n16  Fed. R. Evid. 801(d) indicates that an admission by a\nparty-opponent is not deemed an “exception” to hearsay rule but\nrather as being “exempt” from the rule as non-hearsay.  Graham,\nHandbook on Evidence, § 801:15. \n17  Plaintiffs also refer to Sergeant Harrs’ deposition,\nCourt Exhibit 5, as to the purported significance of the 1997\nLesson Plan.  (Pls.’ Prop. Findings at 17-19.)\n-34-\n\nrequirement has no ready application, and they are not\nmaterials that are prepared on a regular or recurrent basis.”);\n12A Fed. Proc., L. Ed. § 33:445 (“Although the scope of [Rule\n803(6)] is broad, it is not unlimited; for example, it does not\nembrace operating or procedural manuals, which are not records\nof any act, transaction, occurrence, or event as required by\nthe Rule.”).  Although Hodgson v. Corning Glass Works, 474 F.2d\n226, 234 & n. 10 (2d Cir. 1973) may, at first blush, appear to\nbe contrary, the “Job Evaluation Plan” held admissible as a\nbusiness record in that case consisted of job descriptions\nprepared through observation of actual job performance over two\nyears. \nPlaintiffs present a more persuasive argument on\ntheir alternate ground for receiving the subject exhibit into\nevidence, viz. that the 1997 Lesson Plan constitutes an\nadmission under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).  Cf. Hodgson, 474 F.2d\nat 234 n.10.  That argument rests primarily on Pound’s\ntestimony.  Based on that testimony, although the matter is\ncertainly not free from doubt given the possible Rule 602\nproblem, I have received plaintiffs’ exhibit 1 into evidence.  \nThe 1997 Lesson Plan has been considered mainly\nin evaluating the testimony of Michael F. (see Findings of Fact\nNo. 16) and Heidi K. (id. at No. 8).  But beyond that, the\nweight afforded to the lesson plan is de minimis given that the\n-35-\n\npivotal issue is how were the new-admit strip searches actually\nconducted rather than the instructions on the subject that may\nhave been provided at the academy.  The Court’s findings as to\nthat pivotal issue are detailed in Findings of Fact Nos. 7-17. \nFrom those factual findings, it is evident, and I so hold,\nthat, contrary to the position advanced by plaintiffs, the\nstrip searches conducted during the class period did not mirror\nor otherwise meaningfully comport with the steps set forth in\nthe 1997 Lesson Plan.  Instead, each CO developed his or her\nstrip search procedure independent of the lesson plan, which\nprocedures understandably shared numerous common core elements,\ngiven the nature of the task being performed.\nIn sum, I have received plaintiffs’ exhibit 1 in\nevidence but the weight it has been afforded, given the other\nevidence in the record, has been slight.   \nThe above constitutes the Court’s Findings of\nFact.  Attention will now be turned to the concomitant\nConclusions of Law.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW  \n1.  Preliminarily, the Court will address\nplaintiffs’ claim that defendants are collaterally estopped\nfrom asserting strip procedures different from those “found” in\nShain, see 53 F. Supp. 2d at 565-66.  (Pls.’ Comments at 4-5 &\nn.2.) \n-36-\n\nCollateral estoppel bars a party from\nrelitigating an issue when “(1) the identical issue was raised\nin a previous proceeding; (2) the issue was actually litigated\nand decided in the previous proceeding; (3) the party had a\nfull and fair opportunity to litigate the issue; and (4) the\nresolution of the issue was necessary to support a valid and\nfinal judgment on the merits.”  Bank of New York v. First\nMillennium, Inc., 607 F.3d 905, 918 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal\nquotations omitted).  As collateral estoppel only “prevents the\nrelitigation of an issue that was raised, litigated, and\nactually decided by a judgment in a prior proceeding” “[i]f an\nissue was not actually decided in a prior proceeding, or if its\ndecision was not necessary to the judgment, its litigation in a\nsubsequent proceeding is not barred by [the doctrine].”  Jim\nBeam Brands Co. v. Beamish & Crawford Ltd., 937 F.2d 729, 734\n(2d Cir. 1991).  Moreover, “[a] determination whether the first\naction or proceeding genuinely provided a full and fair\nopportunity requires consideration of the realities of the\nprior litigation, including the context and other circumstances\nwhich may have had the practical effect of discouraging or\ndeterring a party from fully litigating the determination which\nis now asserted against him.”  Algonquin Power Income Fund v.\nChristine Falls of New York, Inc., 362 Fed. Appx. 151, 2010 WL\n177244, at *3 (2d Cir. Jan. 20, 2010)(Summary Order) (internal\n-37-\n\nquotations omitted).  \nShain addressed whether that plaintiff “was\nentitled to summary judgment on the claim that the Nassau\nCounty strip search policy, which requires a strip/visual body\ncavity search [i.e. searches involving the removal of all\nclothes and a visual inspection of body cavities, not involving\nany touching of the person being stripped] of all prisoners\nremanded to custody of the NCCC [was] unconstitutional.”  53 F.\nSupp. 2d at 565 & n.2.  Although the Shain court set forth the\nstrip search “procedures followed,” the court’s listing of\nthose steps was not necessary for its decision.  The focus of\nShain was on the constitutionality of the County’s policy of\nstrip searching newly admitted inmates, not the particular\nprocedures employed to accomplish that goal.  Cf. id. at 566\n(stating that disputes as the actual inspection time was not\nmaterial ); id. at 566-68 (setting forth the institutional\nconcerns offered by the defendants but noting that given the\nstate of the law, court could not properly consider that\nevidence).  Moreover, the realities of that prior litigation\nmay have had the practical effect of discouraging the County\nfrom disputing the actual procedures employed.  Given these\ncircumstances, plaintiffs have failed to establish that\ndefendants are collaterally estopped from contending that the\nstrip search procedure employed during the class period\n-38-\n\ndiffered from those described in Shain.  See Eurocrafters, Ltd.\nv. Vicedomine, 183 Fed. Appx. 70, 2006 WL 1476126, *2 (2d Cir.\nMay 25, 2006) (Summary Order). \n2. As conceded by defendants, each class\nmember was unconstitutionally strip searched upon admission to\nNCCC following a non-felony arrest.  \n3. Each class member suffered the same injury\nto human dignity inherent in the loss of the right to determine\nwhich individual or individuals may visually inspect that\nmembers’s naked body, particularly his or her sexual organs,\nand under what circumstances.18  Accordingly, all members are\nentitled to the same dollar amount per new admit strip search\nby way of a general damages award, recognizing, of course, that\nthe same may not be said as to their individual claims for\nassociated special damages which will be addressed later in the\nproceedings.19  \n18  The affront to human dignity occasioned by being\nillegally strip searched occurs each time an individual is thus\nvictimized.  Accordingly, given that some class members were\nsubjected to more than one new admit strip search during the\nclass period, the general damages award shall be per strip\nsearch, not per person.\n19  See this Court’s March 27, 2008 Memorandum and Order\nregarding class certification for damage purposes (particularly\nthe portion entitled “The Issue of General Damages for Dignity\nHarm Predominates”) which is hereby incorporated by reference;\nnot cited in the March 27, 2008 Memorandum and Order, but\nnonetheless relevant vis-a-vis the distinction between general\n-39-\n\n4. As to the amount of general damages to be\nawarded per strip search, plaintiffs maintain it should be in\nthe range of “five figures, at the very least.”  (Pls.’\nComments at 43.)  In their view, “[t]here appear to be only two\n‘precedents’ similar enough to be at all useful” (id. at 50),\nthose being (1) the defendants “willingness to settle [, as\nthey did,] the cases of the 10 individual plaintiffs in these\nconsolidated actions for $35,000 each, with absolutely no proof\nof, no inquiry into, and no discovery about, the emotional\ndistress or psychiatric harm to any of those 10” (id. at 51),\nand (2) the “class action strip search trial held [earlier this\nyear] in the Northen District of Illinois [Young v. County of\nCook, CV-06-552 (N.D. Ill.)(Kennelly, J.)”] in which, counsel\nfor plaintiffs reports “Judge Kennelly conducted three trials\nof eight of plaintiffs’ claims to help the parties determine a\npossible range of damages [after liability had already been\nestablished],” resulting in verdicts, “not yet . . . entered\nupon the public record” but said to be by “plaintiffs’ counsel\nin that case” all “in five figures, i.e. $10,000 or more” (id.\nand special damages is Martinez v. Port Authority of New York and\nNew Jersey, 445 F.3d 158, 161 (2d Cir. 2006).\n        For the Court’s analysis in applying established Second\nCircuit jurisprudence concerning the general damages brought\nabout by the loss of liberty necessarily inherent in a proven\nfalse arrest claim to the current unconstitutional strip search\nscenario, and for doing so in a Fed. R. of Civ. P. 23 context,\nsee Mar. 27, 2008 Memorandum and Order at 8-13.     \n-40-\n\nat 51-52).  \nThe subject under discussion represents largely\nunchartered territory.  As a result, as counsel for the parties\nacknowledge, damage awards in other cases are a “dubious guide”\nto the task at hand.  (Defs.’ Prop. Findings at 23; Pls.’\nComments at 50.)  Consistent with that caveat, plaintiffs’\nproffered “two ‘precedents’” share a common inadequacy for\npresent purposes, to wit, neither involved a damages assessment\nmade in a wholly general damages context.  While plaintiffs\nsuggest that a savings of time might be realized by blurring\nthe distinction between general damages and the special damages\nclaims of class members yet to be determined,20 to do so would\nrun afoul of the pretrial rulings which established separate\nguidelines for the two stages of the proceeding.  In keeping\nwith those guidelines, the testimony during the general damages\nstage was limited to descriptions from class members and COs\nregarding new admit strip searches at NCCC during the class\nperiod, with the goal being to provide the necessary\ninformation to the trier of fact so that a general damages\naward could be fashioned.  (See, e.g., Mar. 27, 2008 Memorandum\n20  “[I]f the Court’s general damages verdict is substantial\nenough to provide reasonable compensation to the class,\nplaintiffs are considering foregoing the next stage of the\ncompensatory damages case in an effort to move this case more\nexpeditiously to a conclusion . . . .”  (Pls.’ Comments at 56-57\nn.24.)  \n-41-\n\nand Order, reported at 2009 WL 706252, at 7-13.)  Specifically\nexcluded from the general damages trial was “any information\nconcerning the effect that the search had upon [individual\nclass members],” (Mar. 16, 2009 Memorandum and Order at 6). \n“This line of demarcation as to the permissible testimony will\nnot negatively effect any [class member at the general damages\ntrial] because to the extent such individual did sustain\nhumiliation, embarrassment or emotional distress . . . those\nitems may be pursued during the special damages portion of the\nproceedings.”  (Id. at 7.)  \nIndeed, it would seem advisable – and I will\nsolicit input from counsel at the appropriate time — that the\nspecial damages jury be instructed, to prevent possible double\ncounting, of the general damages award made to each class\nmember for the inherent injury and resulting damage to all\nclass members caused by being illegally strip searched.  Cf.\nKerman v. City of New York, 374 F.3d 93, 125-26 (2004)(“The\ndamages recoverable for loss of liberty for the period spent in\nwrongful confinement are separable from damages recoverable for\nsuch injuries as physical harm, embarrassment, or emotional\nsuffering [caused thereby]; even absent such other injuries, an\naward of several thousand dollars may be appropriate simply for\nseveral hours’ loss of liberty. . . .  The jury, however, was\n[improperly] not instructed that Kerman was entitled to\n-42-\n\ncompensatory damages for his loss of liberty.”)(internal\ncitations omitted).\nIn sum, plaintiffs’ value arguments premised on\nthe settlements reached by the County with certain individual\nplaintiffs prior to class certification, and on what has\ntranspired in Young v. County of Cook to date, are of marginal\nrelevance. \nDefendants’ position regarding general damages\nis multifaceted, beginning with the observation that an award\nof general damages must be based solely on the dignity injury\nupon which class certification was based.  (Defs.’ Prop.\nFindings at 18.)  That is followed by the argument that general\ndamages must be awarded only for the common injury experienced\nby all class members and, thus, “outlier” testimony must be\ndisregarded.  (Id. at 20.)  Next urged by defendants is that\nimplicit in the very idea of a class action is the\nunderstanding that individual recovery is inherently lower than\nin an individual action.  (Id. at 21.)  Finally, defendants\nmaintain that “the damages awarded in strip search cases have\nbeen minimal absent aggravating factors suggesting a gratuitous\nor malicious effort to demean, debase, or degrade.”  (Id. at 23\n(capitalizations omitted).)  These points will each be\naddressed in turn.\n-43-\n\nA.  General Damages Have Been Determined in This\nCase Based on the Affront to Human Dignity Necessarily Entailed\nin the Strip Searches to Which Class Members Were Subjected.\nAs noted by defendants, the Court certified a\ndamage class based upon the theory that “plaintiffs have\nsuffered an injury to human dignity,” and “has regularly\nreaffirmed this basic law of the case since then.”  (Defs.’\nProp. Findings at 18.)  Defendants voice a concern, however,\nthat I may have reconfigured the basis for the certification of\nthe general damages class, citing my statement on October 20,\n2009 that perhaps “we shouldn’t use the word ‘human dignity’ in\nthis case” (Oct. 20, 2009 Tr. at 83:12-13), and the text of the\nProposed Preliminary Instruction to the Jury which I presented\nto counsel in November 2009.\nThe Court’s October 20th comment was triggered\nby its receipt of a report of Adam Schulman (“Schulman”), who\ndefendants sought to call as an expert pursuant to Rule 702 of\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence.  Therein Schulman opined as\nfollows:\nHuman dignity is not injured or violated by\nconduct that is merely uncomfortable,\nintrusive or embarrassing.  Rather, modern\nthinking about human dignity — whether in\nEurope, where the concept plays an\nimportant role in the law, or in the United\nStates, where it does not — has developed\nin response to grave atrocities and crimes\nagainst humanity, including genocide,\nslavery and unethical human medical\n-44-\n\nexperimentation (especially in the Nazi\nconcentration camps but also, in the U.S.,\nin the Tuskegee Syphilis Study).  Conduct\nrises to the level of a violation of human\ndignity only when there is a deliberate and\ngratuitously malicious attempt to demean,\ndebase, humiliate, or deny the humanity of\nthe victim.  Moreover, for conduct to\nconstitute a serious violation of human\ndignity, warranting more than minimal\ndamages, it must reflect a widespread or\nsystematic practice of atrocities\ninflicting grave humiliation or degradation\non human beings.\n    \n(Expert Report of Schulman (Dkt. No. 175) at 2 (emphasis in\noriginal).)\nI denied defendants’ request to call Schulman as\na witness.  In doing so, I gave the following explanation which\ncontains the snippet provided by defendants:\n   [W]hat I am concerned about on the\nquestion of helping the jury and it being\nrelevant is basically the premise upon\nwhich this learned individual report is\nbased.  This is based, as he has indicated,\nbasically it is on international law.  It\nis on the issue of bioethics.  It is a very\nbroad presentation by him, and I’m sure it\nis accurate as to the concept of human\ndignity within the parameters that he has\ndiscussed.\n   It may be that we shouldn’t use the word\n“human dignity” in this case.  But the\nsemantics doesn’t change the substance. \nAnd that’s the problem.  It is basically\nthat the good doctor is talking about one\nthing, and we are involved with something\ndifferent.\n(Oct. 20, 2009 Tr. at 83:4-16.)\nIn sum, the statement quoted by defendants, in\n-45-\n\nthe context in which it was uttered, should not be interpreted\nas a step towards altering the “basic law of the case.” \n(Defs.’ Prop. Findings at 18.)  Instead, it represents a\ncomment tethered to my determination that Schulman’s\nunderstanding of the concept of human dignity, based on\nEuropean law (e.g. does not apply in a meaningful way, as\nindicated in his report, absent “a widespread or systematic\npractice of atrocities”) is out-of-sync with our law which\nauthorizes an award of general damages for certain wrongs, even\nif isolated, committed against a single individual such as,\ne.g., the arrestee in Kerman who was deprived of his liberty\nfor one day which the Second Circuit opined might be worth\n“several thousand dollars” in and of itself.  Kerman, 374 F.3d\nat 126.\nWith respect to the text of the Proposed\nPreliminary Instruction to the Jury, that being the second\nreason fostering defendants’ concern, I prepared that document\nin an effort to assist the jury scheduled to be selected to\nhear the case, and presented it to counsel for their input.  In\nresponse, both counsel shared a concern that the proposed\ninstruction “deemphasi[zed] . . . the concept of a common\ninjury to human dignity” as being the appropriate predicate for\nan award of general damages.  (Defs.’ Nov. 23, 2009 Letter\n(Dkt. No. 280) at 1-2.)  While the issue was sub judice,\n-46-\n\ncounsel advised the Court that their clients waived the right\nto a jury trial on the general damages issue, thus rendering\nthe objections to the Proposed Preliminary Jury Instruction\nmoot.  Nonetheless, the Court has considered the de-emphasis\nobjections, and has fashioned its general damages determination\nconsistent with the concept and terminology embodied in the\ndamage class certification.\nB. The “Outlier” Testimony Referenced by\nDefendants has not Affected the General Damages Award.\nCOs testified at trial concerning the procedures\nthat they have followed in strip searching thousands of new\nadmits during the class period.   Additionally, various class\nmembers detailed the strip searches to which they were\nsubjected.  Based on the COs’ and class members’ testimony, it\nbecame apparent that, although each officer developed his or\nher own procedure, all class members were subjected to many of\nthe same steps and that all were ultimately subjected to a\nvisual body cavity search.  \nThree of the class members as noted by\ndefendants, namely Oscar A., Michael F., and Heidi K., reported\nsome occurrences wholly out-of-sync with other testimony which\nI found to be credible.  Oscar A.’s testimony has been rejected\nby the Court as not credible.  Michael F.’s experience as to\nwaiting for an extended period for a properly sized uniform to\n-47-\n\nbe produced has not affected this Court’s general damages award\nprimarily because it is aberrant and, thus, properly prosecuted\nas part of his special damages claim.  The other outlier\nportions of Michael F.’s testimony pertaining to a CO\nsupposedly touching his ears, underarms, and hair were rejected\nby the Court for the reasons articulated earlier.  Similarly\nrejected by the Court was Heidi K.’s testimony that the CO ran\nher fingers through Heidi K.’s hair rather than having Heidi K.\nperform that task herself.  Simply put, no testimony that\ndefendants have categorized as “outlier” in nature has\ninfluenced the Court’s general damages award. \nC.  Each Aggrieved Party is Entitled to a Fair\nGeneral Damages Award Absent a Downward Adjustment Simply\nBecause He or She is a Member of a Class Action.\nThe caption to Part II, B, 3 of defendants’\nProposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law reads:  “It is\n‘Implicit in the Very Idea of a Class Action’ that Individual\nRecovery is Inherently Lower Than in an Individual Action.”\n(Defs.’ Prop. Findings at 21.)\nA number of courts have noted that a class\nmember’s individual recovery is likely to be less than if that\nclass member pursued his or her claim individually.  See, e.g.,\nIn re Marcos Human Rights Litigation, 910 F. Supp. 1460, 1468\n(D.C. Haw. 1995)(“It is probable the judgment against the\n-48-\n\nESTATE, had this Court allowed one-on-one trials, would be\nsignificantly more than the judgment the jury returned in the\naggregate procedure.”), aff’d sub nom. Hilao v. Estate of\nMarcus, 103 F.3d 767 (9th Cir. 1996).  This point has been\nunderscored by defendants in apparent response to plaintiffs’\nreference to the $35,000 paid to each of the individual\nsettling plaintiffs pre-class certification, and to lessen the\nlikelihood of the Court fashioning a general damages award\nthat, when totaled, would have a “potentially devastating\nimpact” on the County.  (Defs.’ Prop. Findings at 22 (citing\nParker v. Time Warner Entm’t Co., 331 F.3d 13, 22 (2d Cir.\n2003).)  \nThe Court earlier indicated that the sums paid\nto the settling plaintiffs pre-class certification are of\nlimited value for present purposes.  As to the effect that the\nlitigation’s class status should have on the size of the\ngeneral damages award per strip search, the following language\nfrom a case cited by defendants, Dellums v. Powell, 566 F.2d\n167 (D.C. Cir. 1977), is instructive:  \nAlthough the fact that damages are\nbeing sought on behalf of a large class\ndoes not mean that each member of the class\nshould receive less than his due, it is a\nreason for care in the formulation of\ninstructions.  In cases of this type, a\ndistortion in the size of the award to the\nindividual plaintiff may be magnified\nthousandfold. \n-49-\n\n566 F.2d at 209. \nThis Court certainly takes no issue with the\nunremarkable proposition in Dellums that an inflated per\naggrieved party award is magnified in a class action setting,\nthereby calling for the trier of fact to exercise utmost\nscrutiny in making such awards.  However, Dellums does not\nstand for the proposition that an aggrieved party’s individual\ndamage award should be reduced simply because he is a member of\na class; in fact, in speaking of such an individual receiving\n“his due,” the message seemingly conveyed is to the contrary.  \nSimilarly absent from Parker is support for\ndefendants’ position which, if found to be the law, would\nrequire triers of fact in assessing damages to adjust the\namount depending upon whether the person injured sought redress\nindividually or as part of a class.  Presumably, under that\nlogic, the larger the class the lower the per class member \naward.\nIt may well be, as I suspect it is, that a\ncomparison of individual and class action verdicts involving\nthe same type of injury, demonstrates such an inverse\ncorrelation.  But that does not mean, however, that what may\noften occur as a practical matter should become part of the\napplicable law, i.e. a requirement to be factored into the\ndecision making process by triers of fact in endeavoring to\n-50-\n\nfashion an appropriate damages award.  Neither Dellums nor\nParker, or any other case to my knowledge indicate that it\nshould be and, accordingly, I decline to do so. \nFinally, before moving on to defendants’ next\npoint, I recognize that class action awards may implicate\npossible due process concerns as mentioned in Judge Newman’s\nconcurrence in Parker, a case involving 12 million Cablevision\nsubscribers each seeking $1,000 in damages for privacy\nviolations under the Cable Communications Policy Act.  However,\nthe specter of such a crushing verdict, and the concomitant\n“devastating impact . . . on the defense” (Defs.’ Prop.\nFindings at 22), simply is not in play on the general damages\nphase of the current litigation.\nD. Strip Search Awards in Non-Class Action\nCases.\nAlthough numerous strip search class actions\nhave been settled, there are few instances in which a trier of\nfact has determined the amount of damages in a class action\nstrip    search case.  As a result, counsel for the plaintiffs\nand defendants have been required to look almost exclusively to\nnon - class action cases for guidance.  Using that prism,\ndefendants maintain that “even in individual actions, the\ndamages awarded in strip search cases have been minimal absent\naggravating factors suggesting a gratuitous or malicious effort\n-51-\n\nto demean, debase or degrade.”  (Defs.’ Prop. Findings at 23\n(capitalizations omitted).)  Among the cases cited for that\nproposition are Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668 (8th Cir. 1982);\nAbshire v. Walls, 830 F.2d 1277 (4th Cir. 1987); McCabe v.\nMais, 580 F. Supp. 2d 815 (N.D. Iowa 2008), aff’d in part rev’d\nin part sub nom. McCabe v. Parker, 608 F.3d 1068 (8th Cir.\n2010); McBean v. City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377 (S.D.N.Y.\n2006); Cobb v. City of Columbia, 205 F. Supp. 2d 827 (S.D. Ohio\n2001); Kelleher v. New York State Trooper Fearon, 90 F. Supp.\n2d 354 (S.D.N.Y. 2000); and Smith v. Montgomery County,\nMaryland, 643 F. Supp. 435 (D. Md. 1986).  \nIn Hunter v. Auger, the Eighth Circuit in 1982\nheld that a prison’s policy of strip searching visitors to the\ninstitution upon uncorroborated anonymous tips involving their\npurported possession of contraband violated the Fourth\nAmendment.  672 F.2d at 675.  In overturning the district\ncourt’s determination to the contrary, and remanding the case,\nthe Circuit stated as to the issue of damages: \nAppellants have requested an award of\nreasonable damages.  After carefully\nstudying the record evidence, we find that\nthere is no showing of facts justifying an\naward of more than nominal damages.  We\nnote that there is no evidence that\nappellants here were subjected to repeated\nincidents that intruded on fourth amendment\nprotections.  Each complaint is based on\none episode.  Moreover, we believe that\nappellants’ fourth amendment rights are\nfully vindicated here by the grant of\n-52-\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. \nAccordingly, we direct the district court,\non remand, to allow nominal damages.\nId. at 677.   \nHunter does not represent binding precedent in\nthis Circuit.  Moreover, the aggrieved parties in that case,\nunlike here, had the option to “submit[] to a strip search or\n[to] forego[] the [intended] visit.”  Id. at 670. \nPrescinding from that pivotal distinction, and\nto the extent Hunter may otherwise be viewed, as defendants\ncontend, as authority for the proposition that nominal damages\nadequately compensate a person subjected to an illegal strip\nsearch, that interpretation is, at the very least, difficult to\nsquare with Second Circuit law.  (See, e.g., Mar. 27, 2008\nMemorandum and Order at 8-11.)  And, given that the Second\nCircuit concluded in Kerman that plaintiff’s one day loss of\nliberty might well justify a general damages award in the\nthousands, see 374 F.3d at 126, it is hard to believe that the\ngrievous affront to human dignity occasioned by being subjected\nto an unlawful visual body cavity search would not warrant an\naward considerably in excess of nominal damages.  But, in any\nevent, Hunter is of limited value since, to partially\nreiterate, the visiting plaintiffs in that case had a choice,\nor option, denied current plaintiffs.\nThe Fourth Circuit in Abshire v. Walls,\n-53-\n\ndefendants advise, “approved an award of $2,000 in compensatory\ndamages and $5,000 in punitive damages to an arrestee who had\nbeen subjected to a strip search” under appalling\ncircumstances.  (Defs.’ Prop. Findings at 27.)  As synopsized\nby the Circuit: \nAt the police station, Abshire was\nprocessed and then handcuffed to a railing. \nHe testified that he made numerous requests\nto use the telephone, all of which were\ndenied.  He also testified that after one\nsuch request Officer Krach approached him\nand told him to “be quiet or I will have\nyou unhandcuffed and have the boys have a\ngo around with you around back.”  After\nAbshire responded indignantly, Krach said\n“lets strip search him.”  Abshire was then\nunhandcuffed and escorted to a utility\nroom, where he was forced to disrobe and\nsubject himself to a strip search by\nOfficers Walls and Queen.  Abshire\ntestified that a number of other officers\nwere also present in the room and observed\nthe search.  After the search, Abshire was\nplaced in a cell until he was released on\nhis own recognizance following a bail\nhearing later that day. \n \nAbshire, 830 F.2d at 1278-79 (footnotes omitted).    \nAbshire was decided 23 years ago and,\naccordingly, the sums involved should be adjusted for\ninflation.  Moreover, the $7,000 total award on the strip\nsearch claim was not one of the issues raised on appeal and\nthus was not, contrary to defendants’ assertion, “approved” by\nthe Circuit.  Accordingly, its usefulness for present purposes\nis marginal.\n-54-\n\nMcCabe v. Mais is a 2008 case from the Northern\nDistrict of Iowa.  Plaintiffs McCabe and Nelson, two retired \nschoolteachers, were subjected to “illegal strip searches and\nvisual body cavity searches . . . of plaintiffs’ vaginas and\nanuses.”  580 F. Supp. 2d at 820.  The verdict returned by the\njury totaled $750,000; $250,000 for McCabe and $500,000 for\nNelson.  In response to defendants’ motion for a new trial, the\ntrial court, while recognizing that “courts have uniformly\nrecognized that strip searches and the VBC [Visual Body Cavity]\nsearches are humiliating and degrading,” stated “that many of\n[those] same courts have held that, in the garden–variety\nillegal strip search or VBC search case where no aggravating\nfacts are present [that such victims] are only entitled to\nnominal damages.”  Id. at 835 (citing Hunter and also McBean\nwhich will be discussed momentarily).  Having said that,\nhowever, the McCabe Court concluded that the matter before him\nwas not “on all fours with Hunter and therefore some award of\ncompensatory damages is appropriate.”  Id. at 836.  What\nseparated the McCabe plaintiffs from their counterparts in\nHunter was that in McCabe, “unlike . . . in Hunter, . . .\nplaintiffs testified specifically that they suffered emotional\ndistress as a direct result of the strip searches and VBC\nsearches.”  Id.  However, that proof “was not strong” in that,\ninter alia, “no medical evidence of injury was presented.”  Id.\n-55-\n\nat 837.  Indeed, “[o]nly Plaintiff Nelson offered evidence of\nmore than momentary emotional distress.”  Id.  \nBased on the foregoing, and after reviewing\nawards in other strip search cases, the McCabe Court “order[ed]\na remittitur in the amount of $25,000 with respect to Plaintiff\nMcCabe and $50,000 with respect to Plaintiff Nelson.”  Id. at\n837-38.  In some ways, McCabe is helpful to defendants in that\nit utilized the Hunter rationale as a point of departure in\ndetermining that the jury award of $750,000 shocked the\njudicial conscience, warranting a direction that plaintiffs\neither accept $75,000 or try the case again.21  But, on the\nother hand, the remittitur amount is substantial given the\nlimited nature of the injuries sustained.  And, like the other\ncases cited by the parties, the relevance of McCabe is diluted\nin that the compensatory damage issue was not bifurcated into\ngeneral and special damages. \nDefendants place considerable stock in McBean v.\nCity of New York in which a class of pretrial detainees sued\nthe City based on its policy of strip searching all arraigned\ndetainees charged with misdemeanor or lesser offenses,\n21  After the conclusion of the briefing in the case at bar,\nthe Eighth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the S.D.\nOhio’s decision.  See McCabe v. Parker, 608 F.3d 1068 (8th Cir.\nJune 30, 2010).  Although upholding the district court decision\ngranting a new trial and offering remittitur, the Eighth Circuit\nheld that the remittitur amount was too low as it violated the\nmaximum recovery rule.\n-56-\n\nregardless of reasonable suspicion, upon entry to the\ncorrectional facility.  233 F.R.D. at 380-81.  The parties\nreached a proposed pretrial settlement, which was ultimately\napproved by the district court under which, after “bonus or\nincentive awards” were paid to class representatives, the\nremaining class members were to “receive $750 if they were\nsubjected to one qualifying strip search, and $1,000 if they\nwere subjected to two or more qualifying strip searches.”  Id. \nat 381. \nIn determining the reasonableness of the\nproposed settlement, the district court discussed and largely\ndistinguished the major cases cited by the objectors,22 and\nnoted, in an excerpt underscored by defendants, that “[t]he\nparties have provided the Court with numerous examples of\nindividual plaintiffs who have, at trial, proven liability on a\nstrip search claim, only to be awarded nominal damages.”  233\nF.R.D. at 387. \nThe background information and accompanying\nanalysis in McBean has proven helpful to the Court;\nnonetheless, its relevance beyond that is marginal at best in\nthat in McBean (1) “[i]ndividual class members [dissatisfied\n22   One of those cases was Tyson v. City of New York, No. 97\nCiv. 3762 (JSM) in which “a class of pre-arraignment detainees\n[reached a settlement with the City under which] individual\nawards . . . averag[ed] . . . approximately $3,800 per person,”\n233 F.R.D. at 389.\n-57-\n\nwith the settlement amount could]” “opt out and pursue their\nown claims” pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement,\nid. at 388, an option not available to the members of the\npresent class in the post-trial context, (2) the liability\nissue was unresolved whereas here liability has been conceded,\nand (3) the settlement presented to the court, by its very\nnature was a product of compromise, unlike here where my role\nis to fashion a fair general damages award which fully\ncompensates each class member, independent of any special\ndamages they may seek to assert as a result of being unlawfully\nstrip searched. \nBefore proceeding to discuss Cobb v. City of\nColumbus, another case cited by defendants, two more comments\nconcerning McBean are warranted.  Firstly, as noted by\nplaintiffs, the district court in that case “did not endorse\nthe proposition that only nominal damages would be appropriate\nfor a strip search unlawfully conducted pursuant to an\nunconstitutional policy.”  (Pls.’ Comments at 54, n.22.) \nRather, its observation that sometimes plaintiffs who\nestablished liability only received nominal damages was made by\nthe district court in assessing the “Grinnell23 factor[]”\npertaining to “the risks of establishing damages” should the\n23  City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448 (2d Cir.\n1974). \n-58-\n\naction proceed to trial.  233 F.R.D. at 386.  And that takes us\nto the second additional comment concerning pivotal\ndistinctions between McBean and the instant case, to wit, “the\nrisk of establishing liability.”  Id. at 385. That “Grinnell\nfactor[],” id., was the subject of the following comments in\nMcBean:\n[U]nder the law of this Circuit a blanket\nstrip-search policy such as the one to\nwhich plaintiffs were subjected is clearly\nunconstitutional.  Therefore, the risks of\nestablishing liability at this time are\nminimal, if not nonexistent.  However, the\nduty of this Court is not merely to\ndetermine the risks of establishing\nliability at this time.  Rather, the Court\nmust determine the risks of establishing\nliability should the settlement be rejected\nand the case go to trial at some future\ndate.  As discussed in [McBean v. City of\nNew York, 228 F.R.D. 487 (S.D.N.Y.\n2005)(“McBean I”)] the case law in this\narea is far from stable.  228 F.R.D. at\n498.  Shain v. Ellison, the case\ninvalidating a policy similar to the one at\nissue here, was decided by a divided panel\nof our Court of Appeals . . . and it may\nwell be in the interests of the class to\nobtain “a quick resolution[] while the law\nis in their favor.”  McBean I, 228 F.R.D.\nat 498.  The question of whether an en banc\nCourt of Appeals, or, for that matter, the\nSupreme Court, will upset the holding of\nShain takes this Court into the realm of\nspeculation.  It is enough to observe,\nhowever, that there are no guaranties in\nlife, and while it appears likely that\nplaintiffs would be able to establish\nliability at trial, things change.\n233 F.R.D. at 387 (emphasis in original).  \nHere, of course, liability has been conceded so\n-59-\n\nthe concerns addressed in the above excerpt do not come into\nplay.  In sum, McBean is distinguishable to the point of\nproviding scant guidance.\n      In Cobb v. City of Columbus, the court awarded a\nplaintiff subjected to an illegal pat-down search $500 for\n“humiliation, mental suffering and the intangible loss of his\nFourth Amendment rights.”  205 F. Supp. 2d at 834 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).  Defendants argue that\n“the damages for ‘intangible loss’ in Cobb seem analogous to\nthe presumed damages for dignity harm here . . ., and that the\nplaintiff’s total compensation, including both these damages\nand damages for emotional injury were only $500.”  (Defs.’\nProp. Findings at 27 (emphases in original).)  The $500 award\nin Cobb was made in 2001.  Thus, to the extent it is germane,\nan upward adjustment to reflect inflation is required.  But its\ncore relevance is virtually nonexistent.  The district court in\nCobb set the damage award for a “pat-down [that] was light and\nof short duration,” and which caused plaintiff “‘a little’\nembarrassment.”  Cobb, 205 F. Supp. at 834.  Under such\ncircumstances, the $500 award appears appropriate.  However, I\nfind myself unable to draw a meaningful comparison between the\npat-down described in Cobb and the unlawful visual body cavity\nsearches of the members of the instant class.  \nIn Kelleher v. Fearon, plaintiff brought suit\n-60-\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against a New York State trooper,\nalleging that he was illegally strip searched.  90 F. Supp. 2d\nat 356.  The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff and awarded\n$125,000 in compensatory damages.  Defendant moved for judgment\nas a matter of law, or in the alternative, for a new trial or\nremittitur.  After declining to disturb the jury’s liability\ndetermination, the court addressed the compensatory damages\naward.  It began its analysis thusly: “[a]t no point in the\ntrial did Plaintiff produce any evidence of medical treatment\nor other professional expenses related to his claim of\nemotional distress.”  Id. at 363.  Given the absence of any\nproof beyond his own testimony as to “the headaches,\nsleeplessness and the general emotional distress he claimed to\nhave suffered” as a result of having been strip searched, the\ncourt concluded that plaintiff “simply failed to prove an\ninjury.”  Id.  In the court’s view, that delinquency did “not\nmean that [he] must throw out the damages altogether.”  Id.  \nThe Kelleher court, after noting that (1) “an\nunlawful strip search, in and of itself, is an egregious\nviolation of Plaintiff’s constitutional right to be free from\nunwarranted government intrusion of his person,” and (2)\nplaintiff testified that the defendant trooper touched him\nduring the strip searched process in violation of State Police\npolicy, ordered remittitur in the amount of $25,000.  Id. at\n-61-\n\n364.\nIf anything, Kelleher though cited by defendants\nin their discussion of McBean, seems to favor plaintiffs’, not\ndefendants’ position in that the district court’s reference to\nplaintiff proving “no injury,” stated against the backdrop of\nthe observation that a strip search represents “an egregious\nviolation of Plaintiff’s constitutional right to be free from \nunwarranted government intrusion of his person” suggests, as\nposited by plaintiffs, that the $25,000 remittitur amount may\nhave “been made primarily for the privacy violation and dignity\nharm rather than for emotional distress.”  (Pls.’ Comments at\n53.) \nSmith v. Montgomery County is a 1986 class\naction strip search decision in which a district court in\nMaryland held that “[f]or all members of the class whose Fourth\nAmendment rights were violated, the Court will enter an award\nof nominal damages in the amount of $200.”  643 F. Supp. at\n443.  The bulk of the decision is devoted to establishing\n“broad guidelines and procedures to determine membership in the\nclass,” coupled with the observation that “[a]rticulating the\nreasonable suspicion standard is easier than applying it.”  Id.\nat 437.  Only one paragraph of the decision, six lines in\nlength, is devoted to the damages question.  The nature and\nextent of the proof submitted on damages may not be gleaned\n-62-\n\nfrom the decision, nor the court’s rationale, if any, beyond\nthe statement that the amount awarded per aggrieved individual\nis likely to “deter defendants from future violations.”  Id. at\n443.  Under the circumstances, including the age of the case,\nSmith sheds little light on the issue at hand. \nAnother case mentioned by defendants warrants\ndiscussion,24 that being Nolley v. County of Erie.  Nolley was\nan inmate in a county correctional facility who sought\ninjunctive relief and damages for the county’s practice of\nidentifying HIV positive inmates via its  “red sticker [on\ntheir paperwork] and automatic segregation policies.”  802 F.\nSupp. at 901.  Plaintiff premised part of her claim to\ncompensatory damages on the doctrine of presumed damages,\narguing that “the reasons supporting an award of presumed\ndamages in defamation per se cases are equally valid with\nrespect to the privacy tort proven here.”  Id. at 903.  That\nargument was adopted by the district court, following its\nreview of various supportive treatises, law review articles,\nand court decisions.  Specifically, the court, sitting non-jury\nfound:\n   Based on the above, the court concludes\nthat presumed damages are appropriate in a\ncause of action founded on the unwarranted\n24  I found that none of the six “European Court of Human\nRights” cases cited by defendants (see Defs.’ Prop. Findings at\n28-29) were of aid to the Court. \n-63-\n\ndisclosure of a person’s HIV status.  As\nthe court noted in [a prior decision in]\nNolley, “‘it is difficult to argue that\ninformation about this disease is not\ninformation of the most personal kind. . .\n.’”  Nolley [v. County of Erie], 776 F.\nSupp. [715 (W.D.N.Y. 1991] at 731 (quoting\nWoods v. White, 689 F. Supp. 874, 876\n(W.D.Wis. 1998), aff’d without opinion, 899\nF.2d 17 (7th Cir. 1990)).  Unwarranted\nrelease of this information is virtually\ncertain to cause some injury, yet be the\ntype of injury that is very difficult to\nprove.  It is also likely to cause mental\ndistress.  Presumed damages are an\nexpedient way to compensate plaintiff for\nthe injuries she no doubt suffered from\ndefendants’ red sticker alert and\nsegregation policies.  It must be\nremembered in this regard that defendants’\nred sticker policy, which was in effect\nthroughout plaintiff’s three confinements,\nindiscriminately exposed plaintiff’s\nsensitive condition to dozens of persons. \nNolley, 776 F. Supp. at 720.  Accordingly,\nthe court concludes that plaintiff is\nentitled to presumed damages for the injury\nto her interest in privacy.\n802 F. Supp. at 904.    \nIn addition to Nolley’s claim for presumed\ndamages based on the violation of her right to privacy as a\nresult of the county indiscriminately divulging her HIV\npositive status to dozens of persons in the correction facility\nduring her periods of incarceration, she also sought special\ndamages for, inter alia, the associated emotional distress she\nsustained.  The Court awarded her “$3,100.00 [for] presumed\ndamages” and “$6,200.00 [for her] emotional distress.”  Id. at\n912.\n-64-\n\nDefendants maintain that the Nolley presumed\ndamages award of $3,100 supports their position that the\npresumed, or general damages here should be minimal because\n“surely the violation in . . . Nolley . . . was more serious”\nthan the body cavity searches suffered by the plaintiff class\nmembers.  (Defs.’ Prop. Findings at 27.)  Both of the\nviolations, though involving vastly different conduct, are\negregious.  An effort to rank them by degree of severity, as\ndefendants proffer, is problematic although the Court will be\nmindful of the $3,100 presumed damages award in Nolley in\nfashioning its general damages award.  In so doing, I will also\nconsider, of course,  that the award was made eighteen years\nago, thus requiring an adjustment for inflation together with a\ncountervailing recognition of the hysteria which surrounded a\nHIV positive diagnoses during the times Nolley was incarcerated\nin Erie County, i.e. intermittently from mid-1988 to early\n1990.25 \n5. Determining general damages in the present\ncontext represents largely uncharted territory.  What minimal\nguidance there is has been gleaned from the cases and other\nsources cited by the parties and the Court’s independent\nresearch.  Based on those materials, viewed in conjunction with\n25  The periods of incarceration are provided in an earlier\nNolley decision viz. Nolley v. County of Erie, 776 F. Supp. 715,\n717 (W.D.N.Y. 1991).\n-65-\n\nthe trial evidence and the arguments of counsel, plaintiffs are\nhereby awarded general damages of $500 per strip search.  \nCONCLUSION\nThe foregoing constitutes the Court’s Findings of\nFact and Conclusions of Law. \nAs noted earlier, the number of qualifying searches\nduring the class period appears to be in excess of 20,000. \nHowever, until the number of “Book and Bail” inmates, if any,\nis determined, see footnote 3 supra, the total amount of the\ngeneral damages verdict against defendants may not be\ndetermined.  And also, as explained earlier, the special\ndamages sustained by class members is a subject for another\nday.  In that regard, the parties are directed to appear before\nme on Friday, October 1, 2010 at 3:00 p.m. to discuss that next\nphase of the proceeding.  \nSO ORDERED.\nDate:  Central Islip, New York\n       September 22, 2010\n_________________________ \n                              DENIS R.

POLLACK \nAugust 17, 2004 \nVIA OVERNIGHT DELIVERY \nHonorable Denis R. Hurley \nUnited States District Court \nLong Island Federal Courthouse \n100 Federal Plaza \nCentral Islip, New York 11722 \nRe: In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases \n99-CV-2S44 (DRH) \nJudge Hurley: \nI am co-counsel for plaintiffs in the above-referenced action. \nAs you are aware, defendants in this action petitioned the Court to \"clarify\"  their prior \nconcession of liability for all routine strip searches conducted at the Nassau County Correctional \nCenter (NCCC).  The Court recognized that defendants' attempts to alter their previous, \ncomplete concession of liability had serious ramifications for the Court's prior denial of \nplaintiffs' class certification motion, and consequently granted plaintiffs an opportunity to renew \ntheir class certification motion. \nTherefore, on March 29,2004, plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification, \nseeking certification under both Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).  The argument for (b)(2) certification \nwas premised on (l) evidence strongly suggesting that defendants continued to engage in \nunlawful routine strip searching, including non-admission searches which they now argue for the \nfirst time are legally valid, and (2) the Second Circuit's vacatur of Judge Wexler's injunction in \nShain II on standing grounds, seemingly making the need for inj unctive relief in this action more \ncompelling. \n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 90      Filed 08/18/2004     Page 2 of 2\nBELDOCK  LEVINE  &  HOFFMAN LLP \nIn their opposition to our renewed motion for (b )(2) certification, defendants argued in \npart that plaintiffs in the instant action lacked standing to seek injunctive relief, and therefore \n(b )(2) certification was inappropriate.  In our reply, we argued that Shain IT was inapposite, \nbecause the standing issue in Shain IT was based primarily on the fact that Mr. Shain was an \nindividual plaintiff who had not shown a likelihood of future injury at the time of his initial strip \nsearch.  In contrast, we cited numerous courts which had found that a putative class had standing \nto seek injunctive relief in similar cases in which the class sought to enjoin an official policy. \nIt has just come to our attention, however, that the Second Circuit recently vacated a \npreliminary injunction against the County of Orange in a class action on behalf of individuals \nsubjected to a routine strip search policy at a county jail. See Dodge v. County of Orange, 2004 \nWL1567870 (2d Cir. July 14, 2004).  In this decision, the Second Circuit held that, absent a \ndetermination that the individual named plaintiffs had standing to seek injunctive relief at the \ntime the suit was commenced, even a class of aggrieved individuals did not have standing to seek \nto enjoin an official, routine strip searching policy. rd.  The Second Circuit remanded the case to \nthe District Court with instructions to conduct the necessary factual analyses to determine \nwhether there was a sufficient likelihood that any of the named plaintiffs would suffer future \ninjury as a result of the County of Orange's strip search policy. \nWe bring this decision to the Court's attention because of its relevance to the issue of \nplaintiffs' standing to seek injunctive relief and (b) (2) certification.  Because this recent case law \nwould require the Court to conduct individual standing inquiries and would thereby delay \nadjudication of the pending motions, plaintiffs have decided to withdraw their motion for (b)(2) \ncertification at this time, without prejudice, and to seek certification solely under Rule 23(b )(3) .. \nWe continue to assert that defendants' \"clarification\" of their prior liability concession raises \nnumerous legal and factual issues common to the putative class and that (b) (3) class certification \nis warranted on these grounds.  This argument is set forth fully in our pending renewed motion \nfor class certification. \nRespectfully yours, \n~!: \ncc:  Nassau County Attorney's Office \nJeffrey Smith, Esq. \nMatthew Brinckerhoff, Esq.

For the following reasons, the \nCourt grants Defendants' motion and denies Plaintiffs' motion. \nI.  DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO \"CLARIFY\" THE PREVIOUS CONCESSION \nOF LIABILITY. \nTo render the circumstances of the instant cross-motions clear, the Court must \nprovide some procedural background to this case. All of the following facts are derived \nfrom the undisputed procedural background of the instant case. \nOn May 20, 1999, the first of these three consolidated putative class action cases, \nFrancis O'Day. et al. v. Nassau County. et al. (99-CV-2844), was initiated by filing a \ncomplaint. This complaint sought equitable relief and damages due to a strip search \npolicy utilized by the Nassau County Correctional Center (\"NCCC\"). As alleged in this \ncomplaint, NCCC's strip search policy was applied to all individuals charged with \nmisdemeanors and minor offenses, regardless of any specific factual circumstances. On \nJune 1, 1999, Judge Wexler, in Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d 564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), \naff'd. in relevant part, 273 F.3d 56 (2001), held that \"[t]he policy of strip searching all \nmisdemeanor and minor offense arrestees remanded to the NCCC, without requiring any \nsuspicion that the remanded individual is concealing weapons or other contraband, \n-2-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 3 of 15\nviolates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\" 53 F. Supp. 2d at 568. \nThe other two complaints relevant to the instant action were filed after Judge Wexler's \nruling. The Court now considers all of the complaints. \nThe amended complaint in Francis O'Day (99-CV-2844), was filed on August 24, \n1999. In that complaint, the named plaintiffs sought monetary and injunctive relief due to \n(1) Defendants' policy of strip searching all non-felony admits to the NCCC and also (2) \ndue to Defendants alleged policy of strip searching all persons who have posted bail, or \nwho have otherwise been deemed releasable by a court, and who are then strip searched \nagain upon their return from court. See O'Day Amended Complaint~ 2. The amended \ncomplaint also alleges a \"policy practice and custom\" of unconstitutionally delaying in \nreleasing individuals who have already posted bail or are otherwise deemed \"releasable.\" \nId. ~ 3. \nThe amended complaint in Gardy Augustin. et al.. v. Joseph Jablonsky. et al. (99-\nCV-3126), the second initiated of the consolidated actions, seeks money damages and \ninjunctive relief for Defendants' purported policy of searching non-felony-charged \nindividuals when they are admitted to NCCC. See Augustin Amended Complaint~~ 3, 8-\n21. This amended complaint does not allege causes of action for either searches at other \npoints during detention or for any delays in being released. \nFinally, the amended complaint filed in Iaffaldano v. The County ofNassau. et al. \n(99-CV-4238), seeks money damages and injunctive relief from Defendants' purported \n-3-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 4 of 15\npolicy of searching non-felony-charged individuals when they are admitted to NCCC. See \nIaffaldano Amended Complaint~~ 4-6. This amended complaint targets the routine strip \nsearches that were conducted upon and during admittance to the NCCC. See id. ~ 34. No \nclaims are made for delays in being released. \nAfter the Shain decision, the Court received a motion to consolidate all of the \nabove captioned cases and to certify a class. The class definition suggested by Plaintiffs at \nthat time embraced \"all persons arrested for or charged with non-felony offenses who \nhave been admitted to the [NCCC] and strip searched without particularized reasonable \nsuspicion.\" On March 8, 2001 the Court granted the motion for consolidation and denied \nPlaintiffs' motion for class certification. See Augustin v. Jablonsky, No. 99-CV-3126, \n2001 WL 770839 (E.D.N.Y. March 8, 2001) (\"March 8 Order\"). In that order the Court \nheld, inter alia, that the proffered class definition would cause individual issues to \nsubstantially predominate over all common issues, thereby rendering class certification \ninappropriate. The Court denied reconsideration in a May 23, 2001 Memorandum \nOpinion and Order (\"May 23 Order\"). Plaintiffs' subsequent interlocutory appeal was \ndenied by the Second Circuit. \nOn September 23, 2003, the Court addressed Plaintiffs renewed motion for class \ncertification (\"September 23 Order\"). In connection with that renewed motion, Plaintiffs \nrevised the definition of their putative class. This proposed class definition included \nall persons arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offenses in Nassau \nCounty who thereafter were strip[- ]searched at the [NCCC] pursuant to \n-4-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 5 of 15\ndefendants' blanket policy, practice and custom which required that all \narrestees be strip-searched upon admission to the facility .... [This \ndefinition shall not] include individuals who were strip[-]searched after \nJudge Wexler's June 1, 1999[,] decision in Shain v. Ellison, 53 F. Supp. 2d \n564 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), affd., 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 123 \nS.Ct. 672 (December 9, 2002) .... \nPlaintiffs' Mem. at 2. \nHowever, because Defendants' opposition to Plaintiffs' motion contained certain \nnotable language, the Court did not reach that class definition. The relevant language \nstated: \n[D]efendants concede the existence of the one common issue that might be \nappropriate for class certification ... -namely, whether the [NCCC]'s strip \nsearch policy during the class period was constitutional. However, in Shain, \n... the Second Circuit held that the NCCC's policy of strip searching \npersons charged with a misdemeanor and remanded to the facility in the \nabsence of reasonable suspicion that they were carrying weapons or \ncontraband was unconstitutional. Defendants are bound by Shain under the \ndoctrine of collateral estoppel .... Given that the constitutionality of \nNCCC's strip search policy has now been resolved, there is no need to \ncertify a class with respect to that issue. \nDefendants' Opp. Mem. at 8 (citations and footnotes removed) \nThe Court read this language \"as a concession ofliability as to the named Plaintiffs \n(and, presumably, as to all others similarly situated) except to the extent that some \ncorrections officers may have searched some plaintiffs based upon a reasonable and \ncontemporaneously held suspicion rather than pursuant to the blanket strip search policy \nthen in effect.\" September 23 Order at 5-6 (footnote omitted). However, the Court gave \nDefendants the opportunity to retract or modify this concession. See id. at 6 n. 2. Despite \nthis clear and unambiguous opportunity, Defendants did not withdraw or otherwise \n-5-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 6 of 15\nmodify the concession. In fact, they later reaffirmed their concession. On the basis of this \nconcession, the Court found that there were no remaining common disputed issues of fact \nor law and held that class certification would be inappropriate. The Court later reaffirmed \nthis holding despite Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. See October 27, 2003, Order. \nThe circumstances have since changed. Defendants have since referred the instant \ncase away from their previous counsel; presumably preferring representation by the in \nhouse Nassau County Attorney's Office. This new counsel now seeks to \"clarify the \nprevious concession ofliability.\" At first blush, it appeared to the Court that Defendants \nsought to retroactively alter the basis for the Court's substantive orders in this case. For \nthis reason, in a conference connected with this request to clarify, the Court indicated that \nDefendants may need to explain why the principle of judicial estoppel would not apply. \nSee United States v. Hussein, 178 F.3d 125, 130 (2d Cir. 1999). Subsequently, the Court \nissued an order directing Defendants to make a formal motion to clarify the prior \nconcession. One of the issues that the Court directed Defendants to address in their \nmotion was the aforementioned doctrine of judicial estoppel. Upon review of Defendants' \nclarified concession, which the Court does not consider inconsistent with the prior \nconcession, and the absence of any prejudice to Plaintiffs, the Court concludes that the \nmotion should be granted. \nThe Court has carefully read Defendants' motion. As set out therein, Defendants' new \nconcession only applies to the blanket strip searches of all non-felony \"new admits\" to the \n-6-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 7 of 15\nNCCC. Defendant do not concede liability as to any other alleged strip search policy. As an \ninitial matter, the Court fails to see how this concession is different than the one that was \nmade in connection with the September 23 Order. The instant concession applies solely to \nthe blanket search policy as it was applied non-felony new admits to NCCC while the \nconcession made in connection with the September 23 Order conceded liability in connection \nwith Shain. Since, as discussed supra, Shain concerned the constitutionality of the policy \nrequiring strip searches of all non-felony admitees to NCCC, the Court cannot divine any \nsubstantive difference between the two concessions.1 Since such a difference is a necessary \nelement for the invocation ofj udicial estoppel, the Court concludes that this doctrine should \nnot prevent Defendants from the asserting the concession articulated in the context of the \ninstant motion. \nFurthermore, the Court notes that it cannot ascertain any prejudice to Plaintiffs \nflowing from this clarified concession. Indeed, although Plaintiffs express exasperation with \nthe \"clarification,\" they do not actively oppose Defendants' motion. Therefore, in light of the \nobservation that the two concessions are substantively identical and the lack ofp rejudice, the \nCourt accepts Defendants' clarified concession ofliability. For the purposes of clarity, the \nCourt will set forth this concession as follows: the County's amended concession ofliability \napplies solely to the blanket search policy as it was applied non-felony new admits to NCCC; \n1Due to this absence of any substantive difference, the Court cannot ascertain why \nDefendants felt obligated to clarify their concession, thereby necessitating the instant cross \nmotions. However, whatever the reasons, Defendants have endeavored to clarify their position. \n-7-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 8 of 15\nit does not cover the alleged strip search policy covering all persons who have posted bail or \nhave otherwise been deemed releasable, which is the subject of certain claims by some, \nalthough not all, of the named plaintiffs in this consolidated case, see Amended Complaint, \nFrancis O'Day (99-CV-2844). \nII.  PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS. \nIn response to Defendants' application to change their concession, Plaintiffs now \nrenew their motion for class certification with a new proposed class definition. To certify a \nclass  pursuant  to  Rule  23,  the  putative  class  members  must  first  establish  that  the \nprerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been met and then establish that the action qualifies for \ncertification in accordance with Rule 23(b )(1 ), Rule 23(b )(2) or Rule 23(b )(3). See In re Visa \nCheck/MasterMoneyAntitrustLitigation, 280 F.3d 124,  132-133  (2d Cir.  2001).  This \nrequires a rigorous analysis at each step.  See Selby v. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co., 197 \nF.R.D. 48, 54 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). The Court now considers the proposed class definition in \nlight of these standards. \nA.  Plaintiffs' Proposed Class Definition. \nPlaintiffs allege a new class definition. This proposed class definition includes \"all \npersons who have or will be arrested for non-felony offenses and admitted to the NCCC.\" \nPlaintiffs' Mem. at 5. Plaintiffs indicate thatthis definition embraces all individuals that were \n-8-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 9 of 15\narrested between May 20, 1996, and the future date of an order from the Court directing \nDefendants to cease their policy. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should certify five \noverlapping subclasses. As presented, the Court is unwilling to accept this definition. \nB.  Rule 23(a). \nUnder Rule 23(a), there are four prerequisites to certification of a class: \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) \nthere are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or \ndefenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of \nthe class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). As currently framed, Plaintiffs' class definition fails to satisfy three of \nthe four prerequisites for class certification. \nAs an initial matter it is clear that the first prerequisite, sometimes referred to as \n\"numerosity,\" is  satisfied  by Plaintiffs'  proposed  class  definition.  Defendants  do  not \nmeaningfully argue that the individuals embraced by the instant proposed class definition fail \nto satisfy the numerosity requirement. Thus, joinder of the individuals embraced by the \nsuggested class definition would indeed be impracticable. The other three prerequisites to \nclass certification, however, are not satisfied by this definition. \nOn the face of the proposed class definition, no questions oflaw or fact are common \nor typical to all members of the class. These requirements are considered together because \n[t  ]he commonality and typicality requirements tend to merge into one another, \nso that similar considerations animate analysis of Rules 23(a)(2) and (3). The \ncrux of both requirements is to ensure that \"maintenance of a class action is \n-9-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 10 of 15\neconomical and [that] the named plaintiffs claim and the class claims are so \ninterrelated that the interests oft he class members will be fairly and adequately \nprotected in their absence.\" \nMarisol A. by Forbes v.  Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372, 376 (2d Cir.  1997) (citations omitted) \n(quoting General Tel. Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n. 13 (1982)). \nTo satisfy the commonality requirement, Plaintiffs must establish that their claims \nshare a common question oflaw or fact. See In reAgent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., 818 F.2d \n145, 166-167 (2d Cir. 1987). The class, as defined, does not share such an issue. This lack \nof commonality springs from the extremely broad character of the proposed class definition. \nThis is best highlighted by comparing Plaintiffs' proposed subdefinitions. See Plaintiffs' \nMem. at 5. By way of illustration the first four subdefinitions involve strip search policies \nat NCCC while the fifth  subdefinition merely embraces those who, under the specific \ncircumstances of each of their individual cases, were delayed in their release from NCCC \nafter being deemed \"releasable.\" As framed, there is no adequate degree of factual or legal \ncommonality among these subdefinitions, all of which are embraced by the larger proposed \nclass definition. Next, the Court notes that the June I, 1999, cessation of the new admits \npolicy that resulted in strip searches for the named Plaintiffs obviates any commonality with \nindividuals who were later searched. Thus, as framed, the only commonality lies in the fact \nthat  all  members  were  arrested  for  non-felony  crimes.  However,  this  common,  and \nundisputed, arrest history does not set forth an adequate common issue of law or fact. \nA class representative's claims are \"typical\" under Rule 23(a)(3), where each class \nmember's claims arise from the same course of events and each class member makes similar \n-10-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 11 of 15\nlegal arguments to prove defendants' liability. See Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. \nCo., 267 F.3d 147,  155  (2d Cir. 2001). \"While it is settled that the mere existence of \nindividualized factual questions with respect to the class representative's claim will not bar \nclass certification, class certification is inappropriate where a putative class representative \nis subject to unique defenses which threaten to become the focus of the litigation.\" Gary \nPlastic Packaging Com. v. Merrill Lynch. Pierce. Fenner & Smith. Inc., 903 F.2d 176, 180 \n(2d Cir. 1990) (citation omitted). The individualized fact questions relevant to the instant \ncase have been thoroughly discussed in previous orders. The Court will not address those \nissues again in the context of the instant motion. Nonetheless, other problems remain with \nthe purported typicality of this class definition. As it stands, the fifth subdefinition details a \nfactual scenario that is not typical ofthe class members. There is no allegation that there was \na policy of delaying people who have been deemed \"releasable.\" Therefore, the instant class \ndefinition embraces a claim that could conceivably only embrace the named Plaintiffs who \nhave asserted this claim. Furthermore, the Court notes that the claim for delay in release is \natypical even among the named Plaintiffs. For all of these reasons, Plaintiffs have failed to \nestablish typicality for the purposes of the instant class definition. \nFor all of the reasons discussed supra, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not \nestablished the requirements set for in Rule 23(a). \n-11-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 12 of 15\nC.  Timing. \nAll of the named Plaintiffs were searched pursuant to a strip search policy that ended \non June 1, 1999. The proposed class definition, however, encompasses the period between \nMay 20, 1996, and the future date of an order from the Court directing Defendants to cease \ntheir policy. As such, the proposed class is currently unbounded in both its size and time. The \nnumber of people falling within that proposed class and the circumstances of their cases are \npractically impossible to predict. \nPlaintiffs provide no support for such an unbounded class. The Court is aware that \nclass precision is less important in the Rule 23(b )(2) context. See Anderson v. Coughlin, 119 \nF.R.D.  1,  3  (N.D.N.Y.  1988).  However,  both Rule  23(b)(2)  and  Rule  23(b)(3)  class \ncertification is sought by Plaintiffs. Moreover, the instant class is so imprecisely defined that \nthe Court feels it may be unworkable. Finally the Court notes that it is appropriate for the \nCourt to ensure that the class definition is \"precise, objective, and presently ascertainable.\" \nNicholson v. Williams, 205 F.R.D. 92, 97 (E.D.N.Y. 2001). For these reasons, the Court \nconcludes that further briefing is appropriate regarding the time limits on the proposed class \ndefinition. \nD.  Additional Problems with the Instant Class Definition. \nThe Court notes that Plaintiffs again seek class certification for those acts where \nDefendants have conceded liability. For the reasons discussed in both the Court's September \n-12-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 13 of 15\n23 Order and the October 27 Order, the Court declines to certify a class that would include \nacts for which liability is  conceded. Since Plaintiffs'  current proposed class definition \nembraces such conceded causes of action, even under Defendants' amended concession of \nliability, this definition is framed improperly. \nIn addition, the Court harbors doubts that the named Plaintiffs are representative of \nthe putative class. Plaintiffs now seek to certify a class, in part, as to individuals that were \nsearched pursuant to an alleged post-Shain policy of searching all non-felony admitees to \nNCCC. Due to the vintage of the instant case, none of the named Plaintiffs were searched \npursuant to that alleged policy. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the named Plaintiff can \nadequately represent that portion of the proposed class. \nFinally, the Court notes that instant class definition embraces individuals that were not \nincluded in the prior class definitions. In particular, the Court notes that a class based upon \ndelays in being released are wholly inconsistent with all of Plaintiffs' prior class definitions. \nFurthermore, the Court notes that a class embracing searches other than those made upon \ninitial admittance into NCCC, i.e. searches embraced by the facts of the Shain case, is clearly \ninconsistent with the definition addressed in the September 23 Order. Accordingly, the only \ntruly inconsistent position advanced by the parties in the context of the instant cross-motions \ncomes from Plaintiffs, not from Defendants. \nIt is unclear what consequences flow from the fact that Plaintiffs' current position is \ninconsistent with their position during the previous five years of this litigation. However, \n-13-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 14 of 15\ninconsistently alleged classes have been found to support the denial of motions to certifY \nclasses in other cases. See Cavallo v. Utica-Watertown Health Ins. Co .. Inc., 191 F.R.D. 342, \n346 (N.D.N.Y. 2000); cf. W. Alton Jones Foundation v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 97 F.3d 29, \n35 (2d Cir. 1996); Soranno v. New York Life Ins. Co., No. 96-CV- 7882, 2001 WL 290303, \nat *3 (N.D. Ill. March 20, 2001); Ernest P. Kline & Eugene F. Knopf. v. First Western \nGovernment Securities. Inc .. eta!., No. 83-CV-1076, 1996 WL 153641, at *12 (E.D.Pa. \nJanuary 24, 1996). As such, the Court feels obliged to note some of the inconsistencies in \nPlaintiffs' class definitions. \nE.  Rule 23(b) (2) and Rule 23(b) (3). \nBecause of the Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs have not satisfied 23(a), the Court \ndoes not reach the propriety of certifYing the proposed class definition under Rule 23(b) (2) \nor Rule 23(b )(3). \nIII.  CLASS  CERTIFICATION  UPON  THE  DEFINITION  ADVANCED IN \nCONNECTION WITH THE SEPTEMBER 23 ORDER. \nPlaintiffs suggest that, should the instant class definition not warrant certification, the \nCourt should certifY a class pursuant to the definition earlier provided in connection with the \nSeptember 23 Order. The Court disagrees. As discussed supra, the Court does not find any \nsubstantive difference between Defendants two concessions. For this reason, the prior class \n-14-\n\nCase 0:99-cv-02844-DRH     Document 89-2      Filed 08/20/2004     Page 15 of 15\ndefinition  would fail  for  the  identical  reasons  articulated in the  September 23  Order. \nAccordingly, the Court declines to certify a class based upon that earlier submitted, and \npreviously rejected, class definition. \nIV.  CONCLUSIONS. \nFor the reasons discussed supra, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to change \ntheir concession ofliability and DENIES Plaintiffs' motion to certify a class. \nSO ORDERED \n/s/ \nJ \nDated:  Central Islip, New York \nAugust 20, 2004  - -UilrtedStirtes Dlstrict Judge \n-15-",
