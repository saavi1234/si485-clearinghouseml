    "summary": "<p>On May 9, 2005, an undocumented immigrant detained in the San Diego Correctional Facility (SDCF) filed a pro se lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, challenging his conditions of confinement.  SDCF was a contract detention facility in Otay Mesa, California operated by Corrections Corporation of America, Inc.  It housed civil immigration detainees in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p><p>At first, the Court (Judge Dana M. Sabraw) summarily dismissed the complaint, but the plaintiff was granted leave to amend it.  </p><p>Eventually, attorneys with the ACLU's National Prison Project and Immigrants' Rights Project, the ACLU of San Diego & Imperial Counties, and private firms agreed to represent the plaintiff.  A Second Amended Complaint was filed in February, 2007 on behalf of the original plaintiff, several newly named individual plaintiffs, and a proposed class of over 1,000 immigrants detained at SDCF.  ICE, the Corrections Corporation of America, and several of their respective agents were named as defendants. The Second Amended Complaint alleged unconstitutional and inhumane conditions which violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, including: severe overcrowding (use of triple-celling); denial of adequate shelter, reasonable safety, and basic human needs; exposure to respiratory and other infections; poor access to medical, mental health, and dental services; denial of exercise and dayroom space; and unsanitary shower and toilet facilities.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification.</p><p>Defendants moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p><p>On June 21, 2007, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants' motions to dismiss.  Claims of two named plaintiffs were dismissed as moot, as they had already been deported.  The claims of the other three plaintiffs survived.</p><p>Judge Sabraw certified the case as a class action on behalf of immigrants detained at SDCF, over the objections and motions to reconsider by defendants.  In her order denying reconsideration dated October 29, 2007, Judge Sabraw noted that the defendants \"continue to assert triple celling is not unconstitutional, and continue to engage in other allegedly unconstitutional practices such as housing detainees in the common day room.\"  Given those facts, the Court found that the plaintiffs had Article III standing and could pursue injunctive relief as a class.</p><p>On June 19, 2008, the parties filed a proposed settlement agreement with the court.  On July 11, 2008, the district court administratively closed the case, and on August 20, 2008, the court approved the settlement.  Some members of the plaintiff class appealed the settlement, and on December 3, 2008, the court of appeals dismissed the appeal.  </p><p>Under the settlement, the defendants agreed that:<ul><li>SDCF's population would not exceed its design capacity; and</li><li>The defendants would provide information about cell assignments to the plaintiffs.</li></ul>The settlement expired on January 28, 2009. On that day, the parties filed a joint motion for dismissal, and the court dismissed the case with prejudice.</p><p></p>",

Plaintiffs are civil immigration detainees in the custody of U.S. Immigration and\n3 Customs Enforcement (ICE), part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Plaintiffs\n4 are housed at San Diego Correctional Facility (SDCF), a contract detention facility in Otay Mesa,\n5 California operated by Corrections Corporation of America, Inc. (CCA).  CCA is the largest private,\n6 for-profit provider of detention and corrections services in the nation.  Pursuant to a contractual\n7 agreement with ICE, CCA houses approximately 1000 male and female immigration detainees at\n8 SDCF for periods of time ranging from several weeks to several years.  Both ICE and CCA staff\n9 work on-site at SDCF and cooperate fully in the assignment of detainees to housing units.\n10 2. SDCF is chronically and dangerously overcrowded.  Currently, approximately 675\n11 male  and  female  detainees  at  SDCFโmore  than  two-thirds  of  the  immigration  detainee\n12 populationโare housed in pods that are triple-celled, meaning that three detainees are assigned to\n13 sleep and spend significant blocks of time during the day in small cells that are designed for two\n14 people.  Pods that are triple-celled are at least 50 percent over design capacity, often housing still\n15 more detainees on makeshift beds in the common dayroom space.  While the population of ICE\n16 detainees at SDCF fluctuates constantly, triple-celling has been a consistent practice at the facility\n17 for over two years and is currently at critical levels in both male and female housing units.\n18 3. Overcrowding at SDCF is the root cause of numerous unsafe and intolerable\n19 conditions that afflict detainees at the facility, including: increased violence, tension, discomfort,\n20 stress, mental suffering, psychiatric problems, and exposure to respiratory and other infections;\n21 diminished access to medical, mental health and dental services; diminished access to exercise and\n22 dayroom space and other facility services; poor sanitation and decreased ability to maintain personal\n23 hygiene; overburdened and unsanitary shower and toilet facilities, resulting in more frequent\n24 plumbing malfunctions and exposure to urine and feces; and the loss of personal dignity due to all\n25 of the above.\n26 4. Defendantsโ actions, detailed herein, deny basic human needs, inflict unnecessary pain\n27 and suffering, and constitute punitive conditions of confinement in violation of the due process\n28 protections of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the heightened standard\n2 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 3 of 30(cid:10)\n1 of protection afforded to persons detained pursuant to civil rather than criminal laws.  Plaintiffs seek\n2 injunctive and declaratory relief to remedy this serious and ongoing violation of their rights.\n3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n4 5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331\n5 because it arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n6 6. This Court has authority to grant declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 2201 and\n7 2202, and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n8 7. This Court has authority to grant injunctive relief in this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C.\n9 ยง 702, and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n10 8. Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2) because\n11 a substantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to plaintiffsโ claims occurred, and continues\n12 to occur, in this district.\n13 PARTIES\n14 I.  Plaintiffs\n15 9. Plaintiffs Isaac Kigondu Kiniti, Jose Morales-Vargas, Sylvester Owino, Hernan\n16 Ismael Delgado, and Any Castro are immigration detainees in ICE custody who have been detained\n17 pursuant to civil immigration laws.  They are currently being housed at SDCF.\n18 10. Plaintiff Isaac Kigondu Kiniti is a 34-year-old man from Kenya who came to the\n19 United States in 1997.  Taken into ICE custody in May 2004, Kiniti is now seeking withholding of\n20 removal based on his fear of political persecution and torture should he be deported to Kenya.  He\n21 is currently petitioning for Ninth Circuit review of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision\n22 denying him relief.\n23 11. Kiniti was first detained at SDCF in November 2004.  Between then and June 2006,\n24 Kiniti was transferred back and forth between SDCF and ICEโs El Centro Service Processing Center\n25 (โEl Centroโ) a number of times, spending several months at a time at each facility.  Since June\n26 2006, however, Kiniti has remained in detention at SDCFโwith the exception of about 10 days\n27 when he was briefly housed at El Centro in November-December 2006.\n28 12. Kiniti has been triple-celled repeatedly at SDCF.  He has filed numerous written\n3 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 4 of 30(cid:10)\n1 grievances related to triple-celling, and has complained directly to Ronda Richardson, a Senior\n2 Auditor of the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) who interviewed him in early 2005, as part\n3 of an OIG investigation into overcrowding and other problems at SDCF.  While at El Centro in May\n4 2005, Kiniti filed the original Complaint in this lawsuit, which raised individual damages claims\n5 based on, inter alia, the severe overcrowding he had experienced at SDCF earlier that year.\n6 13. Plaintiff Jose Morales-Vargas is a 36-year-old man from Guatemala who came to the\n7 United States in June 2006 to seek asylum.  Morales-Vargas immediately was taken into ICE custody\n8 and was interviewed by a trained asylum officer, who found him to possess a credible fear of\n9 persecution should he return to Guatemala.  An individual hearing before an Immigration Judge on\n10 the merits of Morales-Vargasโs request for asylum is scheduled for March 6, 2007.\n11 14. Morales-Vargas has been housed at SDCF since June 16, 2006.  He has been triple-\n12 celled continuously throughout that time, except for 11 days spent in segregation.\n13 15. Plaintiff Sylvester Owino is a 30-year-old man from Kenya who came to the United\n14 States in 1998.  He was taken into ICE custody on November 8, 2005 and has been detained at SDCF\n15 since that time.  Owino is currently petitioning the Ninth Circuit for review of the BIAโs decision\n16 denying him protection under the Convention Against Torture.  Owino fears that he will be subjected\n17 to torture and persecution by the police if he is returned to Kenya.\n18 16. Owino has been triple-celled for most of his detention at SDCF and without\n19 interruption since June 11, 2006.  Owino has filed numerous written grievances related to\n20 overcrowding and other conditions at SDCF.\n21 17. Plaintiff Hernan Ismael Delgado is a 36-year-old man from El Salvador who entered\n22 the United States in 1980 when he was ten years old.  Delgadoโs parents were tortured and killed\n23 execution-style in his home country, and Delgado entered the United States as an orphan seeking\n24 asylum.  Delgado now has two children who are U.S. citizens.  \n25 18. Delgado was taken into ICE custody in February 2003 and has been housed at SDCF\n26 since October 8, 2004.  His petition for review to the Ninth Circuit was filed in December 2003 and\n27 remains pending.  Delgado is currently triple-celled, as he has been for the majority of his 27 months\n28 at SDCF.  Delgado spent approximately six months sleeping in a plastic โboatโ when he first arrived\n4 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 5 of 30(cid:10)\n1 at the facility.  A โboatโ is a flat plastic container with a thin sleeping mat that is placed on the floor\n2 of the cell.\n3 19. Plaintiff Any Castro is a 28-year-old woman from Honduras who first entered the\n4 United States in September 1995.  Castroโs sister is a lawful permanent resident, and her two-year-\n5 old son is a U.S. citizen.  She attended technical college to become a nurseโs assistant, and worked\n6 as a nurseโs assistant until the time of her arrest, which led to her current detention.  \n7 20. Castro has been detained at SDCF since September 2006.  She has been triple-celled\n8 throughout her time at the facility, and slept on a boat on the floor of her cell for the first two months\n9 of her detention.\n10 II. Defendants\n11 21. Defendant Julie L. Myers is Assistant Secretary for U.S. Immigration and Customs\n12 Enforcement (ICE), the arm of DHS charged with detaining and removing non-citizens pursuant to\n13 federal immigration law.  As the top official at ICE, Myers sets detention and removal priorities and\n14 has ultimate responsibility for the safety and well-being of persons detained in ICE custody.  The\n15 Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO), a division of ICE, manages the daily detention\n16 of approximately 27,000 immigration detainees.  Myers supervises the official conduct of all DRO\n17 officials and may appoint and remove subordinate defendants named herein.  The DHS Secretary,\n18 Michael Chertoff, is specifically authorized by Congress to allocate funds to provide necessary\n19 clothing, medical care, housing, and security for immigration detainees.

As Assistant Secretary (under Chertoff) in charge of\n21 immigration detention, Myers controls the allocation of monies in the DHS-ICE budget for detention\n22 and removal operations and, specifically, the care and treatment of ICE detainees.  In a letter dated\n23 September 11, 2006, Myers provided the official ICE response to the OIG audit report on the\n24 treatment of immigration detainees at five detention facilities, including SDCF. \n25 22. Defendant John P. Torres is the Director of DRO for ICE and is responsible for the\n26 safe,  secure  and  humane  housing  of  immigration  detainees  in  ICE  custody.    The  primary\n27 responsibility of DRO is to provide adequate and appropriate custody management of immigration\n28 detainees until a decision is rendered regarding their removal.  ICE-DRO headquarters staff conduct\n5 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 6 of 30(cid:10)\n1 annual inspections of each facility used to house immigration detainees, including SDCF, and assess\n2 them for compliance with ICE Detention Standards.  Torres oversees the DRO workforce, including\n3 ICE field officers, deportation officials, compliance review officers, and officers assigned to\n4 detention facilities.  Torres is responsible for setting DRO policy with respect to the detention of\n5 foreign nationals, and for the administration and operation of DRO.  \n6          23. Defendant Ron Smith is the Director of the ICE San Diego Field Office, which has\n7 jurisdiction over SDCF and official control over detention and removal operations at the facility.\n8 Smith oversees transfers of immigration detainees into and out of SDCF and formally approves all\n9 placements of detainees at SDCF.  Detainees and their advocates often lodge complaints about\n10 detention conditions with ICE officers at the local field office responsible for their facility.  Smith\n11 supervises and oversees all ICE staff at the San Diego Field Office, including staff who field such\n12 complaints and have regular contact with detainees. \n13 24. Defendant Anthony Cerone is the ICE Officer-in-Charge at SDCF, and Assistant\n14 Field Office Director of the ICE San Diego Field Office.  As the Officer-in-Charge at the facility,\n15 Cerone is the immediate legal custodian of the ICE detainees at SDCF and is directly responsible for\n16 their care and treatment while in detention there.  Cerone has authority to transfer detainees into and\n17 out of the facility and supervises all ICE employees at SDCF.  On information and belief, Cerone\n18 also has significant oversight over the actions of CCA employees at SDCF, including the Warden,\n19 pursuant to the DHS-ICE contractual agreement with CCA to house immigration detainees at the\n20 facility.  Cerone is responsible for ensuring SDCFโs compliance with the ICE Detention Operations\n21 Manual (ICE Detention Standards), as well as CCAโs compliance with its contractual obligations.\n22 Cerone supervises a Contracting Officerโs Technical Representative (COTR) and a Compliance\n23 Review Officer, both ICE employees, who work on-site at SDCF to assist in monitoring for\n24 compliance with the ICE Detention Standards and other applicable standards.  In addition, Cerone\n25 and/or his direct subordinates establish, monitor, and oversee detainee grievance procedures and\n26 serve as members of the detainee grievance committee at SDCF (along with CCA employees).\n27 Under the ICE Detention Standards, Cerone conducts the final level of review for grievances filed\n28 at the facility.  In addition, detainees frequently file complaints directly with deportation officers\n6 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 7 of 30(cid:10)\n1 operating under the supervision of Cerone, using โDetainee Request Formsโ issued by the DRO\n2 office on-site at SDCF.  Cerone also is required to meet regularly with the on-site U.S. Public Health\n3 Service Health Services Administrator to review the effectiveness of the facility health care program\n4 and to recommend necessary corrective actions.\n5 25. Defendant Corrections Corporation of America, Inc. (CCA) is a for-profit, private\n6 corporation incorporated and existing in the State of Maryland and maintaining a principal place of\n7 business at 10 Burton Hills Boulevard, Nashville, Tennessee 37215.  Pursuant to a contract with\n8 DHS-ICE, CCA houses immigration detainees in ICE custody at SDCF, a facility managed and\n9 operated primarily by CCA employees. \n10 26. Defendant Joe Easterling, a CCA employee, is Warden at SDCF.  As Warden,\n11 Easterling has ultimate supervisory authority over all correctional officers, security personnel and\n12 other CCA staff at SDCF.  He is responsible for establishing and maintaining CCAโs policies and\n13 practices with respect to triple-celling, use of force and segregation at SDCF.  Easterling oversees\n14 the daily administration and functioning of SDCF and is responsible for the safe, secure and humane\n15 housing of detainees at the facility.  Easterling conducts the final review of grievances filed by\n16 detainees at SDCF using the โCCA Inmate/Resident Grievance Form.โ\n17 27. Defendant Charles Howard, a CCA employee, is Assistant Warden at SDCF. \n18 Howard supervises and directs correctional officers, security personnel and other CCA staff who\n19 decide and implement housing assignments at SDCF.  He is responsible for implementing CCA\n20 policies and practices with respect to triple-celling, use of force and segregation at SDCF.        \n21 28. All defendants are sued in their official capacities.\n22 29. At all relevant times, all defendants were acting under color of federal law, pursuant\n23 to their authority as officials, agents, contractors or employees of U.S. governmental agencies or\n24 entities.\n25   30. At all relevant times, defendants Easterling and Howard were acting within the scope\n26 of their employment as agents and employees of CCA.  \n27\n28\n7 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 8 of 30(cid:10)\n1 LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n2 31. The Constitution requires government actors to ensure the safety and general\n3 well-being of all persons taken into custody, including non-citizens and persons who are not legally\n4 admitted to this country.  Convicted prisoners are protected by the Eighth Amendment, which\n5 prohibits cruel and unusual punishment despite an adjudication of criminal guilt.  Immigration\n6 detainees, like plaintiffs, are protected by the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits any person acting\n7 under color of federal law from subjecting any person in the custody of the United States to punitive\n8 conditions of confinement without due process of law.  \n9   32. It has long been established that immigration detainees, like pre-trial detainees, are\n10 protected from conditions that amount to punishment.  See Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S.\n11 228, 237 (1896).  More recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that\n12 conditions of confinement for civil detainees must be superior to those of pre-trial detainees, who,\n13 though not adjudged guilty of a crime, are held pursuant to criminal processes.  Jones v. Blanas, 393\n14 F.3d 918 (9th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 126 S.Ct. 351 (2005).  If a civil detainee is confined in\n15 conditions that are identical to, similar to, or more restrictive than those under which pre-trial\n16 detainees or convicted prisoners are held, then those conditions are presumptively punitive and\n17 unconstitutional.  Id. at 934.  By definition, immigration detainees in the custody of ICE are civil\n18 detainees held pursuant to civil immigration laws, and thus are entitled to the higher standard of\n19 protection articulated in Jones.      \n20 33. The Constitution prohibits housing detainees in severely overcrowded conditions that\n21 deny basic human needs.  In addition to the amount of liveable space provided to each detainee, the\n22 effect of overcrowding on other living conditionsโfor example, sanitation, the level of tension and\n23 violence, the provision of health careโis relevant to whether crowding at a particular facility is\n24 unlawful.  Moreover, the practice of denying detainees a bed and a mattress and forcing them to\n25 sleep on the floor violates constitutional protections.  Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d\n26 1439, 1448 (9th Cir. 1989). \n27 34. The Second Amended Complaint does not seek damages.  Plaintiffs seek only\n28 classwide declaratory and prospective injunctive relief against defendants sued in their official\n8 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 9 of 30(cid:10)\n1 capacities for ongoing constitutional violations committed under color of federal law.     \n2 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n3 I.  The ICE-CCA Partnership\n4 35. The DHS-ICE contract with CCA regarding SDCF is one of many such contractual\n5 agreements that provide for the temporary housing of immigration detainees in privately owned or\n6 operated facilities.  Under pressure to find space, if not beds, for increasing numbers of detainees\n7 swept up in heightened border and immigration enforcement efforts, ICE is relying more heavily than\n8 ever on the private prison industry to supply detention capacity.  Currently, more than 20 percent of\n9 the 27,000 persons in ICE custody are housed in for-profit, private facilities, including contract\n10 detention centers like SDCF and smaller local or county jails owned or operated by private\n11 companies.  That percentage is growing quickly, and CCA and its shareholders are some of the\n12 largest economic beneficiaries of ICEโs burgeoning business in immigration detention. \n13 36. CCA was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2000.  The company owned thousands of\n14 empty beds, and its stock was languishing after losing 93 percent of its value.  After the attacks of\n15 September 11, 2001, CCA began to receive lucrative contracts to house federal immigration\n16 detainees at SDCF and other facilities.  By 2005, CCAโs annual revenue from holding immigrants\n17 pursuant to these contracts had risen to approximately $100 million.  Today CCA operates the\n18 majority of the contract detention facilities housing persons in ICE custody.   \n19   37. CCA has discovered that housing immigration detainees is more profitable than\n20 housing state and local prisoners.  Immigration detention centers produce profit margins of more\n21 than 20 percent, whereas traditional prison management produces returns in the mid-teens.  On\n22 average, private companies like CCA receive $95 per โmandayโโthe rate charged for each\n23 individual detainee per day.  This figure is substantially higher than the rate paid by state and local\n24 jurisdictions for housing prisoners, and is generally higher than the rate paid by the Bureau of Prisons\n25 for housing federal prisoners.  Yet despite the high rate paid by the federal government to house\n26 immigration detainees, these detainees receive fewer services during their detention than most\n27 prisoners.  SDCF, like most facilities that house only immigration detainees, does not provide high\n28 school degree programs, vocational training, or organized recreational activities for detainees.\n9 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 10 of 30(cid:10)\n1 38. On  information  and  belief,  the  ICE-CCA  contract  regarding  the  housing  of\n2 immigration detainees at SDCF provides that ICE pays CCA per โmanday.โ  CCA thus receives\n3 more money under the contract the more detainees it houses at the facility. \n4 39. On  information  and  belief,  the  ICE-CCA  contract  regarding  the  housing  of\n5 immigration  detainees  at  SDCF  provides  for  an  on-site  Contracting  Officerโs  Technical\n6 Representative (COTR), an ICE employee whose responsibility is to monitor, assess, record and\n7 report on the technical performance of CCA on a day-to-day basis.   \n8   40. Notwithstanding any contractual arrangement between ICE and CCA regarding\n9 SDCF, defendants Myers, Torres, Smith and Cerone remain the legal custodians of all persons\n10 detained at the facility pursuant to federal immigration laws and are ultimately responsible for\n11 ensuring that those detainees are held in conditions that satisfy constitutional requirements for civil\n12 detainees.  See West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42 (1988). \n13 II. Chronic Overcrowding at SDCF\n14 41. Chronic and recurrent overcrowding has been a persistent feature of detention\n15 conditions at SDCF over the past several years.  The practice of triple-cellingโhousing three\n16 detainees in a cell designed for twoโhas been imposed in virtually every unit at one time or another\n17 and currently affects about 675 detainees, or more than two-thirds of the ICE detainee population\n18 at the facility.  Still more detainees are forced to sleep in makeshift beds placed in the common\n19 dayroom space.\n20 42.   Numerous problems result from, and are exacerbated by, overcrowding, which is the\n21 root cause of many complaints made by detainees about living conditions at SDCF.  Overcrowding\n22 engenders violence, tension and psychiatric problems, and dilutes the availability and quality of\n23 constitutionally required services.  Detainee safety, personal security, health care, peace of mind, and\n24 human dignity are all adversely affected by persistent overcrowding.  The cumulative effect of all\n25 these problems at SDCF is to deny plaintiffs adequate shelter, and to impose punitive conditions of\n26 confinement on immigration detainees housed at SDCF.\n27\n28\n10 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 11 of 30(cid:10)\n1 A. The Detainees\n2 43. According to data released by ICE, more than half of the detainees in ICE custody at\n3 any given time have never been convicted of any crime.  The others are individuals, often longtime\n4 lawful permanent residents of the United States, who were placed in removal proceedings because\n5 of  past criminal convictions for which they have already finished serving any criminal sentence that\n6 they may have received, and have thus paid their debt to society.  The population of detainees at\n7 SDCF includes individuals who fled torture and persecution in their home countries in order to\n8 obtain asylum and refuge in the United States; some of these individuals, like plaintiff Morales-\n9 Vargas, were detained immediately upon entering the United States and have already been found by\n10 a trained asylum officer to possess a credible fear of persecution.  SDCF also houses individuals who\n11 lawfully entered the United States with a visa, but are charged with overstaying the terms of that\n12 visa, as well as individuals with bona fide claims of U.S. citizenship that must be proven in\n13 immigration proceedings.  Many detainees at SDCF have been law-abiding, productive residents for\n14 many years, and have spouses, children and siblings who are U.S. citizens.  Other detainees were\n15 recently apprehended while crossing the United States-Mexico border.  Finally, SDCF houses\n16 stateless detainees and detainees from countries that will not accept deportees, many of whom may\n17 languish for years in ICE custody before securing their release.\n18 44.       Unlike pre-trial detainees, whose length of time in detention before trial is limited by\n19 speedy trial statutes, there is often no ascertainable limit to the amount of time immigration detainees\n20 can expect to spend in detention.  Detainees who choose to fight their removal and pursue all\n21 available appeals can reasonably expect to spend three or more years in ICE custody.  Lengthy stays\n22 in detention are particularly common for detainees petitioning for review before the Ninth Circuit,\n23 due to that circuitโs enormous backlog of immigration cases; the Ninth Circuit receives more\n24 petitions for review than any other circuit and approximately 40 percent of the cases on the courtโs\n25 docket are immigration-related.  Plaintiff Delgado, whose petition for review was filed with the\n26 Ninth Circuit more than three years ago, has been in ICE custody for nearly four years.  Even\n27 detainees who appeal only to the BIA and then choose not to seek Ninth Circuit review can expect\n28 to be detained for up to a year or more before the BIA renders its decision.  On information and\n11 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 12 of 30(cid:10)\n1 belief,  a  significant  percentage  of  ICE  detainees  at  SDCFโapproximately  twenty  to  thirty\n2 percentโare resisting their removal through at least the level of BIA proceedings.   \n3 45. Indeed, many detainees at SDCF have spent more time in ICE detention fighting\n4 removal than they spent in prison serving the criminal sentence for which they are now being\n5 deported.  For instance, one detainee who entered SDCF in December 2005 has been detained for\n6 more than one year, despite the fact that he was only required to serve four months in county jail.\n7 Another current detainee is a 61-year-old lawful permanent resident who previously served only six\n8 months in a county jail, but who has already been detained at SDCF for over eight months and has\n9 not yet had her individual merits hearing before an Immigration Judge.  \n10 46. Thus, while some portion of the immigration detainees at SDCF are quickly deported\n11 and cycle out of the facility within several weeks or months, there is a large core of long-time\n12 detainees who remain at the facility and endure the overcrowded conditions for many months or\n13 years.  For all SDCF detainees, but particularly the long-timers, defendantsโ practice of triple-celling\n14 inflicts ongoing physical, mental and emotional harm, and imposes punitive and unconstitutional\n15 conditions of confinement.              \n16 B. Extent of Triple-Celling at SDCF\n17 47. SDCF has six primary housing units (Units A, B, C, D, J and K), each with a design\n18 capacity of approximately 200 persons.  Unit B is currently used to house men in the custody of the\n19 U.S. Marshals Service (USMS).  Units A, C, D and K house ICE detainees.  Before June 2006, Unit\n20 J also housed ICE detainees and was the womenโs housing unit at SDCF.  In June 2006, however,\n21 management of Unit J reverted to the County of San Diego, which owns the facility, pursuant to the\n22 terms of its lease agreement with CCA; Unit J thus currently houses persons in the custody of the\n23 County.\n24 48. At the time of the transfer, Unit J was housing significantly more than 200 detainees,\n25 including all the female immigration detainees at SDCF, who already had been fully triple-celled for\n26 at least six months.  The women were transferred to Unit K, which was housing male ICE detainees;\n27 the men who had been in Unit K were folded into the other housing units, further exacerbating\n28 overcrowding.  Since that time, triple-celling has been nearly constant for most detainees at SDCF.\n12 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 13 of 30(cid:10)\n1 49. Defendants Smith, Cerone, Easterling and Howard were aware of the loss of Unit J\n2 and the fact that over 200 detainees in that unit would have to be accommodated in the other, already\n3 crowded housing units at SDCF.  Despite this knowledge, defendants did not assign fewer\n4 immigration detainees to the facility.  Rather, the immigration detainee population at SDCF has\n5 remained relatively constant at approximately 1000 detainees since June 2006.  In fact, the average\n6 daily population at SDCF for the first nine months of 2006 was higher than it was over the same\n7 nine-month period in 2005, despite the loss of Unit J.\n8 50. At all relevant times, defendants Easterling and Howard have acted and continue to\n9 act pursuant to CCA policies and practices with respect to overcrowding and the use of triple-celling\n10 at detention facilities.  CCAโs September 2006 Form 10-Q Quarterly Reportโthe first after the\n11 reversion of Unit J to the Countyโnotes that the loss of the 200-bed unit did not result in the loss\n12 of any detainees because โwe had the ability to consolidate inmatesโ into the other units at SDCF.\n13 51. On information and belief, the DHS-ICE contract with CCA regarding SDCF\n14 provides that 1000 beds should be available for use specifically by ICE (and not USMS).  With only\n15 four 200-bed housing units at the facility currently available to house immigration detainees (A, C,\n16 D and K), the facility must house detainees over and above its capacity to meet the 1000-bed\n17 requirement.  The severity of this crowding is made still worse by the fact that two pods in Unit A\n18 are allotted for segregation and protective custody cells, and one pod in Unit K houses female USMS\n19 detainees in addition to ICE detainees.  In light of the available housing at SDCF, the ongoing\n20 assignment of immigration detainees to the facility at current population levels by defendants Smith\n21 and Cerone effectively requires the practice of triple-celling.\n22 52. Units C, D, and K each contain three pods, two of which are designed to house 68\n23 detainees in 34 two-person cells, and the third of which is designed to house 64 detainees in 32 two-\n24 person cells.  Unit A contains four pods, two of which are used to house detainees in disciplinary or\n25 administrative segregation and protective custody, and two of which are general population pods\n26 designed to house 64 detainees.  Currently, all three pods in Unit C, the two general population pods\n27 in Unit A, and two of the three womenโs pods in Unit K are entirely triple-celled.  In these pods, in\n28 addition to housing three detainees per cell, up to 16 detainees may be forced to sleep on bunk beds\n13 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 14 of 30(cid:10)\n1 in the dayroom.  Thus, 100 to 120 detainees are routinely housed in pods designed to hold only 64\n2 or 68 detainees.  The total number of detainees in pods that are crowded at or close to these levels\n3 is approximately 675.\n4 53.   On information and belief, the USMS detainees at SDCF are not triple-celled, or are\n5 not triple-celled to the same extent or for the same length of time as immigration detainees at the\n6 facility.  Unlike civil immigration detainees, USMS detainees are detained pursuant to criminal\n7 charges. \n8      C. Cell Dimensions   \n9 54. Cells at SDCF are designed for two persons and are approximately 72 square feet in\n10 size (12โ x 6โ).  Each cell includes a single set of bunk beds, a toilet-sink unit, a stool, a desk, and\n11 a small property box for each detainee to store personal items.  When a third detainee is housed in\n12 the cell, security officers place a plastic โboatโ containing a thin sleeping mat on the floor parallel\n13 to the bunk beds, immediately next to the toilet.  There is less than a foot of space between the bunk\n14 bed and the boat, leaving virtually no space to walk or stand inside the cell.  The third detainee is\n15 also given a property box.\n16 55. One end of the boat is within a foot of the toilet, meaning that the detainee sleeping\n17 on the floor is often sprayed with urine or water from the toilet or sink if one of his or her cellmates\n18 uses the bathroom at night.  It is difficult to sit comfortably on the toilet or stand in front of it without\n19 stepping on the boat or the detainee sleeping therein.  It is common for the plumbing of four cells\n20 to be linked together, so that problems in one cell result in overflowing toilets and flooding in three\n21 other cells.  When this happens, the boat and sleeping mat often become soaked with water and\n22 human waste. \n23 56. Cell doors are made of solid metal and contain a small glass window that is sealed\n24 and provides no ventilation.  Doors have a small food slot that is used when the unit is on lockdown\n25 and detainees are forced to remain in their cells throughout the day, including during meals.\n26 57. Even when the unit is not on lockdown, plaintiffs spend significant amounts of time\n27 in their cells.  Detainees are normally confined to their cells for about 12 hours a dayโ7 hours at\n28 night, and during four daily counts lasting an hour or more each.\n14 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 15 of 30(cid:10)\n1 58. ICE Detention Standards consistently refer to the American Correctional Association\n2 (ACA) Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities.  On information and belief, CCAโs contract\n3 with ICE to house detainees at SDCF requires compliance with these or other ACA standards.\n4 59. The ACA Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities state that cells housing more\n5 than one person must provide 25 square feet of unencumbered space per occupant.  ACA 2006\n6 Standards Supplement at 71 (April 2006) (Standard 3-ALDF 2C-03).  Unencumbered space is\n7 defined as โusable space that is not encumbered by furnishings or fixtures.โ  Id.  Defendantsโ practice\n8 of housing three detainees in 72-square foot cellsโin which unencumbered space is no more than\n9 15 square feet for all three occupants when the boat is on the floorโdoes not come remotely close\n10 to meeting this standard.  These ACA standards also state that when confinement exceeds ten hours\n11 per day, as it does at SDCF, there should be at least 70 square feet of total floor space per occupant.\n12 Id.  (The ACA Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions, which arguably should apply to SDCF\n13 given the length of time that many detainees spend at the facility, require at least 80 square feet of\n14 total floor space per occupant when in-cell confinement exceeds ten hours per day.).  Thus,\n15 defendants routinely provide less space for three civil immigration detainees than ACA standards\n16 require for a single pre-trial criminal detainee or convicted prisoner.\n17 60.   On information and belief, the facility COTR is charged with monitoring and\n18 assessing CCAโs compliance or non-compliance at SDCF with applicable ACA standards and\n19 reporting that information to the Contracting Officer (at the Office of Federal Detention Trustee) and\n20 ICE-DRO headquarters staff.     \n21 D. Effects of Overcrowding on Conditions Inside the Cells\n22 61. Triple-celling is hard on all detainees, but it is especially hard on the floor-sleeper,\n23 who must endure the indignity of being stepped on and sprayed with urine.  The sides of the boats\n24 are curved, increasing the pain and discomfort for detainees sleeping in them.  Defendantsโ failure\n25 to provide all detainees with a mattress and a bed on which to sleep falls short of constitutional\n26 requirements.\n27 62. Plaintiff Castro was forced to sleep in a boat for the first two months of her detention\n28 at SDCF.  While in the boat, Castro was often extremely cold because the air vent blew directly on\n15 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 16 of 30(cid:10)\n1 her.  During this period Castro began to receive antidepressants, which made her very tired\n2 throughout the day.  During daytime hours, Castro would often sleep in the boat, causing great\n3 discomfort to her cellmates who could not comfortably use the toilet, sink or desk.  On two\n4 occasions, in order to get the rest she needed and to relieve her cellmatesโ discomfort, Castro moved\n5 the boat underneath the bottom bunk and slid her body into it.  With the underside of the bottom\n6 bunk mere inches from her face, this strategy was clearly a safety hazard and she found it difficult\n7 to breathe.  Nonetheless, Castro found that sleeping underneath the bottom bunk was both warmer\n8 and more restful than sleeping in the boat in the middle of the cell.  After Castro had done this on\n9 two occasions, a security officer informed her that she was not permitted to sleep underneath the bed,\n10 and she was again forced to sleep in the middle of the cell.\n11 63. The placement of the boat makes gaining access to the top bunk difficult and\n12 treacherous, as detainees are forced to climb up and down from the desk to avoid stepping on the\n13 floor-sleeper.  Detainees have fallen and injured themselves as a result of these cell conditions.  One\n14 female detainee recently fell from the top bunk while trying not to step on the boat; she injured her\n15 back and was confined to a wheelchair for a week.\n16 64. Practicing Muslims who are triple-celled at SDCF do not have sufficient physical\n17 space to kneel and pray five times per day.  The boat takes up virtually all the usable floor space in\n18 the cell.  As a result, when prayer time falls during count or when the pod is on lockdown, Muslim\n19 detainees are unable to exercise their religion freely.\n20 65. Triple-celling exacerbates tensions among detainees confined in such close quarters\n21 for long periods.  Fights break out among cellmates.  Detainees argue about the use of the toilet,\n22 particularly at nighttime when the person on the floor must be awakened to allow his or her cellmates\n23 to use the toilet.  With three individuals in the cell, it becomes more difficult to keep the cell clean\n24 and sanitary, and there is greater likelihood that the toilet will overflow.  These problems are made\n25 more unbearable when an entire pod is placed on lockdown for extended periods and detainees are\n26 forced to eat all their meals in the cell together.  Lockdowns have lasted as long as five consecutive\n27 days while detainees were triple-celled.\n28\n16 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 17 of 30(cid:10)\n1 66. Defendants Smith, Cerone, Easterling and Howard are aware of the effects of\n2 overcrowding on conditions inside the cells at SDCF but have failed to take reasonable steps to\n3 reduce population levels or otherwise remedy these problems.\n4   E. Effects of Overcrowding on Conditions Inside the Housing Units\n5 67. In addition to increased tensions inside the cells, overcrowding increases the\n6 likelihood of violence throughout the housing unit and places a strain on essential facilities and\n7 services provided to detainees.\n8 68. A single triple-celled pod that includes beds in the dayroom may house up to 118\n9 detainees.  Most pods contain 34 cells, yet have only two showers; pods containing 32 cells have four\n10 showers.  Shower conditions inevitably become unsanitary due to the number of detainees using the\n11 facilities.  Telephones, which are placed in the dayrooms, are frequently broken, making it extremely\n12 difficult for detainees to obtain legal counsel, or to maintain contact with such counsel or with loved\n13 ones.  Overcrowding also raises the noise level inside the housing units, causing extreme discomfort\n14 for detainees and further exacerbating the difficulties associated with using the phones.  \n15 69. With individual pods at fifty to sixty percent over capacity, conflicts erupt over the\n16 use of the showers, control of television channels, and limited dayroom space.  During meals, there\n17 are insufficient chairs and tables in the dayroom for all detainees, forcing many to sit on the floor or\n18 stand while eating.  Other detainees bring food back to their cells, which worsens the sanitation\n19 problem in the cells.  Plaintiff Delgado was recently housed in Unit C, where several detainees began\n20 to argue over the control of the two television sets.  As a result, the entire pod was placed on\n21 lockdown for several hours.  \n22 70. In the most overcrowded pods, ten to fifteen detainees are housed in the dayroom on\n23 bunk beds.  When this happens, one cell on the lower tier of the pod is typically kept unoccupied and\n24 unlocked for use as a bathroom.  Thus, the detainees assigned to sleep in the dayroom must share\n25 a single toilet and sink with as many as 118 other detainees.  These detainees also must store their\n26 property in the dayroom, where it is accessible to every other detainee in the pod.\n27 71. Each housing unit has a small, concrete yard containing a basketball hoop and two\n28 sets of metal bars for exercise.  Each pod is permitted approximately one hour of recreation in the\n17 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 18 of 30(cid:10)\n1 morning and one hour in the afternoon.  When pods are triple-celled and house close to 100\n2 detainees or more, the yard does not provide enough recreational space for all detainees to exercise\n3 properly.\n4 72. Security staff at SDCF are insufficient to monitor the severely overcrowded units.\n5 Over 100 detainees in a single pod, or 300 detainees in a single unit, frequently remain under\n6 observation by only one or two security officers in the control room, who are unable to ensure the\n7 safety of all detainees without additional staff.  Plaintiff Morales-Vargas has had to defend himself\n8 in at least five incidents of detainee-on-detainee violence that went unnoticed or were ignored by\n9 security staff.  Plaintiff Owino has witnessed numerous fights among detainees that transpired\n10 without the intervention of security staff.  When staff does intervene, entire pods are often placed\n11 on lockdown for three to four days in response to fights among individual detainees.\n12    73. The direct connection between overcrowding and increased violence among detained\n13 populations is well-established.  The Governor of California recently issued a proclamation declaring\n14 a state of emergency in California state prisons that repeatedly links the incidence of assaults and\n15 riots by inmates to prison overcrowding levels.  Unlike the incarcerated population at issue in the\n16 Governorโs proclamation, immigration detainees at SDCF are detained pursuant to civil processes\n17 for non-punitive purposes and are entitled to a higher standard of protection with respect to their\n18 likely exposure to violence while in detention.\n19 74. Defendants Smith, Cerone, Easterling and Howard are aware of the effects of\n20 overcrowding on conditions inside the housing units at SDCF but have failed to take reasonable steps\n21 to reduce population levels or otherwise remedy these problems.\n22 F. Spillover into Holding Cells and Segregation\n23 75. Upon entering SDCF and prior to placement in a housing unit, immigration detainees\n24 are initially kept in a holding cell.  Detainees are placed in similar holding cells when awaiting\n25 imminent deportation, release from the facility, or transport to an off-site location such as\n26 immigration court in downtown San Diego.\n27 76. Each holding cell is a small, secure room with a concrete floor, a long metal bench\n28 against the wall, and a toilet-sink unit.  On information and belief, detainees are sometimes housed\n18 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 19 of 30(cid:10)\n1 in such holding cells for more than 12 hours, while they are being processed or while waiting for bed\n2 space to open up in crowded housing units.  If detainees, who are often transferred in and out of the\n3 facility in the early morning hours, need to sleep they must lie directly on the concrete floor or the\n4 metal bench.  There is just enough room in a typical holding cell for approximately 12 detainees to\n5 sleep in a row on the floor, side-by-side, touching one another, like sardines.  Detainees who must\n6 be transported to downtown San Diego in order to appear before the Immigration Judge are often\n7 awakened in the middle of the night and transferred out of their cell and into such a holding cell; on\n8 information and belief, such detainees  often fail  to receive a morning meal and appear in\n9 immigration court hungry, disheveled, and sleep-deprived.\n10 77. One detainee, an Iranian asylum seeker whose wife, sister and father are all U.S.\n11 citizens, spent two consecutive days in a holding cell with 18 people when he first came to SDCF\n12 in September 2006.\n13 78. Defendants also use administrative segregation to house overflow detainees who\n14 cannot be accommodated in overcrowded pods.  Indeed, placement in segregation is a routine\n15 punishment for detainees who refuse to be triple-celled.  \n16 79. Detainees confined in segregation remain in their cells for 23 to 24 hours a day and\n17 are required to eat all meals in their cells.  Segregated detainees are offered one hour of out-of-cell\n18 exercise, five days per week, in a small cement yard  (approximately 8' x 16') surrounded by a chain-\n19 link fence; detainees refer to this yard as a โcage.โ  On most days, detainees in segregation are\n20 provided with their exercise hour early in the morning before the sun rises, or late in the evening\n21 after the sun sets; when it is cold outside, many detaineesโwho are not issued winter clothing and\n22 must resort to purchasing sweatshirts from the commissary if they have fundsโdecline to go outside.\n23 G. Effect of Overcrowding on Health Conditions and Medical Services\n24   80. Overcrowding diminishes the availability of adequate medical, mental health and\n25 dental care at the facility.  Health services staff respond more slowly to sick call requests for medical\n26 and dental care as a result of the over-capacity detainee population at SDCF and the medical intake\n27 screening process is overburdened.  \n28\n19 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 20 of 30(cid:10)\n1 81. In addition, triple-celling creates serious health problems for detainees.  Respiratory\n2 infections and other illnesses are rampant because of the close quarters and the amount of time that\n3 detainees must spend confined in their cells.  With three detainees in a cell and the cell door closed,\n4 the air inside the cell becomes warm and humid, making it difficult to breathe.  This has a\n5 particularly deleterious effect on asthmatics, such as plaintiff Owino, who are at greater risk of\n6 suffering asthma attacks because of these conditions.\n7 82. Detainees living in severely overcrowded conditions are at greater risk for both\n8 methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug  resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB).\n9 MRSA is a highly contagious bacteria known to spread rapidly in institutional settings where poor\n10 sanitation and close confinement create a greater likelihood of transmission.  MRSA causes skin\n11 infections and boils and can lead to serious complications such as deep abscesses, pneumonia,\n12 endocarditis (infection of the heart), meningitis, bone infection, blood infection and death.   MDRTB\n13 is a potentially fatal air-borne disease whose spread is facilitated by poor air circulation and crowded\n14 conditions.\n15 83. On information and belief, numerous mentally ill detainees are triple-celled in general\n16 population as a result, at least in part, of overcrowding and the strain that it places on mental health\n17 services.  For approximately one month, plaintiff Kiniti shared a cell with a mentally ill detainee who\n18 had previously served part of his criminal sentence in a state mental institution.  Kinitiโs cellmate,\n19 who talked loudly to himself during the night keeping his cellmates awake, said he preferred SDCF\n20 to state prison because at SDCF he could refuse to take his medication and no one would bother\n21 about it.  The mentally ill detainee subsequently assaulted another cellmate and was moved to\n22 administrative segregation.  Another detainee who has been in ICE custody for more than six years\n23 was frequently triple-celled in general population despite being diagnosed with schizophrenia and\n24 bipolar disorder; as a result of various medical problems, he was unable to control his bowel\n25 movements and needed adult diapers, which were provided inconsistently.\n26 84. Triple-celling also creates problems for detainees with limited mobility or medical\n27 problems  that  are  aggravated  by  crowded  conditions.    The  medical  clinic  at  SDCF  issues\n28 โchronosโโspecial needs formsโto such detainees that direct CCA staff not to triple-cell a detainee\n20 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 21 of 30(cid:10)\n1 for medical reasons.  Such chronos are routinely ignored by CCA staff.  For example, in June 2006\n2 one detainee received a medical chrono stating that he needed to be housed in a lower bunk in a two-\n3 man cell because of numerous medical problems including his need to urinate frequently during the\n4 night.  CCA staff agreed to house the man in a lower bunk, but denied the remainder of the chrono\n5 and instead triple-celled him.  The detainee immediately filed a CCA Inmate/Resident Grievance\n6 Form, which was denied with the standard response: โThis is a non-grievable issue.  We have already\n7 addressed this issue in the past and will not entertain the (2) men to a cell issue. . . .โ\n8 85. Defendants Smith, Cerone, Easterling and Howard are aware of the effects of\n9 overcrowding on health conditions and the provision of medical services at SDCF but have failed\n10 to take reasonable steps to reduce population levels or otherwise remedy these problems.  \n11 H. Detainee Complaints and the OIG Audit\n12 86. Large numbers of detainees have lodged informal complaints and filed formal\n13 grievances with both ICE and CCA officials complaining about the practice of triple-celling at\n14 SDCF.  The grievances are systematically dismissed with language similar or identical to the\n15 following: โDue to variables in housing restrictions, i.e. classification levels, gender, it can or will\n16 be necessary to have (3) three individuals housed in (1) cell.  This does not violate policy or\n17 procedures. . . . Staff actions are appropriate. Grievance denied.โ \n18 87. Defendants Smith, Cerone, Easterling and Howard are aware of the volume of\n19 grievances filed by immigration detainees about the effects of triple-celling and have directed or\n20 approved all official responses to such complaints.  These responses either state that the issue cannot\n21 be grieved or summarily deny the grievance.  Beverly Soria, a CCA employee, is the Grievance\n22 Officer at SDCF.  Soria provides the initial response to most grievances filed by detainees, including\n23 all grievances related to overcrowding and triple-celling, using the CCA Inmate/Resident Grievance\n24 Form.  On information and belief, Soria is also the Secretary of Warden Easterling.\n25 88. In October 2004, 90 detainees sent a petition to the SDCF Warden and the DHS OIG.\n26 The detainees specifically complained about overcrowding (including the practice of placing three\n27 detainees in two-person cells) and about a five-day lockdown in Unit A.  According to the petition,\n28 when detainees were released from lockdown, defendant Howard informed them that the lockdown\n21 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 22 of 30(cid:10)\n1 was imposed to teach them a lesson.  On November 23, 2004, an advocate for detaineesโ rights at\n2 the National Immigration Project wrote to the SDCF Warden and the ICE Officer-in-Charge about\n3 overcrowding and inadequate medical care at SDCF.\n4 89. Beginning in or about May 2004, based on numerous allegations of abuse and poor\n5 treatment by ICE detainees in facilities across the country, the DHS OIG initiated an audit of the\n6 treatment of immigration detainees.  Out of more than 300 jails, prisons and other facilities around\n7 the country holding immigration detainees, the OIG initially decided to focus its review on ten\n8 facilities.  That list of ten facilities was ultimately reduced to only five facilities due, at least in part,\n9 to the volume of complaints received from those facilities, particularly SDCF.  Auditors toured the\n10 facilities, reviewed written complaints by detainees, and conducted numerous in-person interviews\n11 of detainees.    \n12 90. SDCF was one of the five facilities visited by field auditors from the OIG.  Those\n13 visits occurred over a period of approximately ten weeks in early 2005.  In addition, the OIG\n14 conducted seven weeks of document review related to the San Diego facility.      \n15 91. A report detailing the results of the OIG audit was originally expected to be released\n16 in May 2005.  Then the OIG stated that due to complications with the audit of a Passaic, New Jersey\n17 facility the report would not be completed and released until early February 2006.  In August 2006,\n18 the OIGโs spokesperson stated that the report was due to be released in late summer 2006.  The long-\n19 awaited results of the OIG audit were finally released on January 16, 2007.  See Treatment of\n20 Immigration Detainees Housed at Immigration and Customs Enforcement Facilities, available at\n21 http://www.dhs.gov/xoig/assets/mgmtrpts/OIG_07-01_Dec06.pdf (OIG Audit Report).\n22 92. The OIG Audit Report indicates that 210 detainees at SDCF responded to the OIGโs\n23 request for information about conditions of confinement and allegations of mistreatment at the\n24 facilityโmore than twice as many as at any of the other four facilities that were audited.  Id. at 39.\n25 The report also shows that three of the four most egregious instances of physical and sexual abuse\n26 reported at the five facilities took place at SDCF.  Id. at 28.  In addition, the report identifies\n27 significant failures in the provision of adequate health care and monitoring of suicidal detainees.\n28 More than half the detainees whose files were reviewed were not given a physical exam within two\n22 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 23 of 30(cid:10)\n1 weeks of entering SDCF, and were not seen by a physician or qualified medical officer within three\n2 days of submitting a request for medical attention.  Id. at 4.  Out of five detainees on suicide watch\n3 whose files were reviewed, only one was monitored at least every 15 minutes.  Id. at 6.  \n4 93. Despite identifying many serious problems at SDCF, the OIG Audit Report is notable\n5 for what it fails to include.  The report fails to even mention the problem of overcrowding at SDCF.\n6 Triple-celling was widespread throughout the facility at the time of the audit in early 2005.  Over 50\n7 detainees spoke with the field auditors during their visit and many, including plaintiffs Kiniti and\n8 Delgado, specifically complained about triple-celling, or the direct effects of triple-celling.  On\n9 information and belief, still more detainees complained about overcrowding, or the direct effects of\n10 overcrowding, in written communications with the field auditors.  Further, local immigrant advocates\n11 highlighted the problem of triple-celling at multiple meetings they attended with the auditors to\n12 discuss problems at SDCF.  \n13 94. Based on these facts, it is simply impossible to believe that the auditors were not\n14 made aware of the problems associated with overcrowding at SDCF.  Indeed, both the SDCF\n15 Warden and the ICE Officer-in-Charge at the time of the audit were replaced shortly thereafter, and\n16 the level of triple-celling declined somewhat for a period of months following the OIG visit,\n17 ostensibly in response to concerns raised during the audit.  Notwithstanding these changes,\n18 overcrowding at SDCF gradually returned to pre-audit levels.  And on July 1, 2005, soon after the\n19 OIG  audit  at  SDCF  was  completed,  ICE  awarded  CCA  with  a  contract  for  the  continued\n20 management of the facility.\n21 95. On information and belief, all defendants were made aware of the OIGโs concerns\n22 with respect to overcrowding at SDCF at the time of the audit, and of the auditorsโ findings regarding\n23 the facilityโincluding findings that may not have been published in the official OIG Audit Report.\n24 Despite this knowledge, defendants failed to take or sustain meaningful corrective action in response\n25 to these findings. \n26 96.  Finally, the OIG Audit Report did conclude that ICE DROโs annual detention review\n27 of SDCF in 2004 failed to identify problems regarding health care and general conditions of\n28 confinement observed by the OIG during its audit, and that a final rating of โAcceptableโ was\n23 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 24 of 30(cid:10)\n1 granted to SDCF despite these problems and additional problems with environmental health and\n2 safety and reports of detainee abuse.  Id. at 36.  On information and belief, as Director of DRO\n3 defendant Torres was made aware of the results of ICE DROโs annual detention reviews and\n4 approved both the inspection methods and the final rating given to facilities such as SDCF. \n5 97. Defendant Myers, who provided the official ICE response to the OIG draft report in\n6 September 2006, specifically rejected the OIGโs recommendation that ICE โ[a]scertain the reasons\n7 that areas of non-compliance identified by ICE inspections of detention facilities were significantly\n8 less  than  the  non-compliance  deficiencies  identified  by  [the  OIG].โ    Myers  asked  that  the\n9 recommendation be considered resolved and closed.  Id. at 51.  \n10 I. The September 2, 2006 โRiotโ\n11 98. The most dramatic instance of violence triggered by overcrowding at SDCF occurred\n12 on September 2, 2006, when a so-called โriotโ broke out in Unit D.  Although triple-celling was\n13 present in Unit D in the months preceding the โriot,โ the use of triple-celling was not as prevalent\n14 there as in the other housing units at that time.  The September 2 disturbance began when CCA staff\n15 attempted to initiate broader triple-celling within Unit D by placing a third detainee into a number\n16 of cells.  Many Unit D detainees, frustrated by the prospect of still further crowding, sat down in the\n17 dayroom and asked to speak to ICE officials about the plan to expand triple-celling in their unit.  As\n18 the detainees waited peacefully to speak with ICE officials, CCA brought out S.O.R.T. (Special\n19 Operations Response Team) officers in full anti-riot gear.  \n20 99. The S.O.R.T. officers released pepper spray throughout the three pods in Unit D and\n21 waited approximately 15 minutes for the gas to take effect.  Some detainees began to act out,\n22 throwing items around the dayroom and breaking a window in one of the pods.  Other detainees were\n23 running around, mostly trying to return to their cells.  Correctional officers armed with pepper ball\n24 guns began to shoot at detainees.  At least one detainee was shot in the head with a rubber bullet and\n25 injured, and other detainees were pepper sprayed and later beaten while sitting peacefully inside of\n26 their cells.\n27 100. Following the riot, dozens of detainees were placed in disciplinary segregation and\n28 accused of participating in the riot.  Some were placed in segregation cells wearing only a t-shirt and\n24 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 25 of 30(cid:10)\n1 their underwear, and were not provided blankets.  The temperature in segregation was extremely\n2 cold, and detainees ripped open their mattresses so they could try to stay warm while sleeping.\n3 Correctional officers removed the torn mattresses from the cells, forcing detainees to sleep on metal\n4 bunks without mattresses.  Some detainees were eventually released from segregation after\n5 disciplinary charges against them were dropped.  Several others continue to be held in segregation\n6 nearly five months after the incident, despite having long ago completed any disciplinary sentence\n7 that they received in connection with the disturbance.\n8 101. Those detainees who were not brought up on disciplinary charges after the riot\n9 remained in Unit D.  All three pods of Unit D were placed on Behavior Management Status which\n10 entailed a round-the-clock lockdown for over a week and peanut butter sandwiches for all three\n11 meals during this period.  Detainees did not receive showers, personal or legal mail, exercise, access\n12 to the law library or law library materials, or telephone calls, including legal calls, throughout the\n13 lockdown.  The lockdown was phased out over a period of weeks, during which time detainees were\n14 slowly permitted to shower, their meals were returned to normal, and they were gradually allowed\n15 limited access to the dayroom.\n16 102. The aftermath of the September 2, 2006 disturbance is just one example of the use\n17 of punitive segregation and lockdown to suppress complaints about overcrowding and other\n18 conditions at SDCF; the pattern is consistent and predictable.  Detainees who refuse to be\n19 triple-celled are routinely placed in segregation, where they are confined to their cells for 23 hours\n20 a day and have limited access to showers, legal materials, exercise time and nearly all social\n21 interaction.  \n22 103. CCAโs extreme response to the detaineesโ peaceful refusal to be triple-celled last\n23 September is similar to the response tactics of CCA employees at many of the companyโs other\n24 facilities, and reflects a CCA policy favoring disproportionate violence and punitive measures in\n25 response to non-threatening complaints by prisoners and detainees.  On information and belief, the\n26 ICE defendants were aware of the September riot and took no action to curb CCAโs response or alter\n27 the future practices of CCA employees at the facility.\n28\n25 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 26 of 30(cid:10)\n1 III. Class Action Allegations\n2 104. Plaintiffs Kiniti, Morales-Vargas, Owino, Delgado and Castro bring claims based on\n3 the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution on behalf of themselves and all others\n4 similarly situated, pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n5 105. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of โall immigration detainees in ICE\n6 custody who are now or in the future will be confined at San Diego Correctional Facilityโ\n7 (hereinafter the โSDCF Classโ).  As a result of their confinement at SDCF, members of the SDCF\n8 Class including plaintiffs have been, are, and will be subjected to violations of their constitutional\n9 rights as described in this Second Amended Complaint.  Plaintiffs represent a class of persons\n10 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to eliminate or remedy defendantsโ policies, practices, acts\n11 and omissions depriving them of those rights.\n12 106. There are currently approximately 1000 male and female immigration detainees\n13 confined at SDCF.  The proposed SDCF Class is so numerous, and membership in the class so fluid,\n14 that joinder of all members is impracticable.  Because ICE detainees are frequently removed from\n15 the country, released from detention, and transferred between SDCF and other facilities that house\n16 immigration detainees, the membership of the class changes constantly.\n17 107. All SDCF Class members are equally subject to the conditions described in the\n18 Second Amended Complaint, and common questions of law and fact exist as to all SDCF Class\n19 members.  These common questions include, but are not limited to: whether defendants have failed\n20 to provide adequate shelter, reasonable safety, and basic human needs to plaintiffs as a result of\n21 overcrowding at SDCF; whether plaintiffsโ conditions of confinement subject them to unreasonable\n22 risk of violence, injury, illness and mental suffering; whether plaintiffsโ conditions of confinement\n23 are effectively punitive; whether defendantsโ conduct violates the Fifth Amendment; and whether\n24 defendantsโ conduct shows a pattern of officially sanctioned behavior that violates plaintiffsโ rights\n25 and establishes a credible threat of future injury. \n26 108. Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of the SDCF Class as a whole.  Plaintiffs\n27 have all been subjected to overcrowding at SDCF, including the practice of triple-celling, as is\n28 typical of the SDCF Class as a whole.  Plaintiffs and the class they represent have been directly\n26 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 27 of 30(cid:10)\n1 injured by defendantsโ unconstitutional policies, practices, acts and omissions with respect to\n2 overcrowding, and are all at risk of future harm from continuation of these policies, practices, acts\n3 and omissions.\n4 109. Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the SDCF Class.  The\n5 interests of plaintiffs are consistent with those of the class, and they are represented by counsel who\n6 are experienced in class action, civil rights, immigrantsโ rights, and conditions of confinement\n7 litigation.\n8 110. Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the\n9 SDCF Class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief and declaratory relief with respect\n10 to the class as a whole.\n11 CLAIM FOR RELIEF  \n12 Denial of Adequate Shelter, Reasonable Safety, and Basic Human Needs  \nBased on Chronic and Severe Overcrowding \n13 (Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause)\n14 111. Defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and omissions with respect to chronic and severe\n15 overcrowding at SDCFโincluding but not limited to the triple-celling of immigration detainees and\n16 the housing of additional detainees in common dayroom spacesโdeprive plaintiffs of adequate\n17 shelter, reasonable safety, and basic human needs, and place them at unreasonable, continuing and\n18 foreseeable risk of, inter alia, increased violence, illness, mental suffering, and deteriorating health.\n19 112. Defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and omissions with respect to chronic and severe\n20 overcrowding at SDCF are not justified by a legitimate governmental purpose and constitute de facto\n21 punishment without due process of law.  Defendantsโ conduct has created and maintained, and\n22 continues to maintain, punitive conditions of confinement for civil immigration detainees housed\n23 at SDCF.\n24 113. Defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and omissions with respect to chronic and severe\n25 overcrowding at SDCF create and maintain conditions of confinement for civil immigration\n26 detainees that are qualitatively similar to, or worse than, the conditions under which prisoners and\n27 pre-trial criminal detainees are held at SDCF and other comparable facilities.\n28\n27 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 28 of 30(cid:10)\n1 114.    Although plaintiffs, as civil immigration detainees rather than convicted prisoners,\n2 need not prove deliberate indifference to establish a violation of their substantive due process rights,\n3 defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and omissions with respect to chronic and severe overcrowding\n4 at SDCF nevertheless constitute deliberate indifference to the basic human needs of plaintiffs. \n5 115. Defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and omissions with respect to chronic and severe\n6 overcrowding at SDCF violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States\n7 Constitution.\n8 116. Defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and omissions with respect to chronic and severe\n9 overcrowding at SDCF show a pattern of officially sanctioned behavior that violates plaintiffsโ\n10 rights, and establish a credible threat of future injury to plaintiffs.\n11 117. As a proximate result of defendantsโ unconstitutional policies, practices, acts and\n12 omissions, plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer immediate and irreparable injury,\n13 including physical, psychological and emotional injury.  Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate or\n14 complete remedy at law to address the wrongs described herein.  The injunctive relief sought by\n15 plaintiffs is necessary to prevent continued and further injury.\n16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n17 WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:\n18 a. Issue an order certifying this action to proceed as a class action pursuant to Rules\n19 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;\n20 b. Appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Rule 23(g) of the Federal Rules\n21 of Civil Procedure;\n22 c. Issue a judgment declaring that defendantsโ policies, practices, acts and omissions\n23 described herein violate plaintiffsโ rights under the Constitution of the United States;\n24 d. Permanently enjoin defendants, their subordinates, agents, employees, and all  others\n25 acting in concert with them from subjecting plaintiffs to the unconstitutional\n26 conditions described herein, and issue injunctive relief sufficient to rectify those\n27 conditions;\n28\n28 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 35     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 29 of 30(cid:10)\n1 e. Grant plaintiffs their reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 2412,\n2 and other applicable law;\n3 f.

Defendants have filed an opposition, and Plaintiff has submitted a reply.\n19\nAdditionally, the Department of Homeland Security (โDHSโ) has filed an amicus brief in opposition\n20\nto Plaintiffโs motion.  The Court finds the matter suitable for submission without oral argument\n21\npursuant to Local Civil Rule 7.1(d)(1).  For the following reasons, the Court grants Plaintiffโs motion.\n22\nI.\n23\nBACKGROUND\n24\nOn May 9, 2005, Plaintiff Isaac Kigondu Kiniti, a civil immigration detainee at the San Diego\n25\nCorrectional Facility (โSDCFโ), filed the complaint in this action, along with a motion to proceed in\n26\nforma pauperis (โIFPโ).  The complaint alleged violations of constitutional rights against Corrections\n27\nCorporation of America, Inc. (โCCAโ), the Warden and several officers at SDCF.  On August 4, 2005,\n28\nthe Court granted Kinitiโs IFP application and reviewed his complaint sua sponte under 28 U.S.C. ยง\n- 1 - 05cv1013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 56     Filed 02/27/2007     Page 2 of 9(cid:10)\n1 1915(e)(2).  Pursuant to its sua sponte review, the Court dismissed several claims and several named\n2 defendants, with leave to amend.  Kiniti filed his FAC on June 29, 2006.  The remaining defendants\n3 answered the FAC on October 30, 2006.  Kiniti, now represented by counsel, seeks leave to file a\n4 Second Amended Complaint (โSACโ).  The proposed SAC seeks to (1) add four additional plaintiffs\n5 and class action allegations; (2) strike all damages claims; and (3) add additional defendants and\n6 dismiss some of the named defendants.  \n7 The four additional plaintiffs, all civil immigration detainees housed at SDCF, include Jose\n8 Morales-Vargas, Sylvester Owino, Hernan Ismael Delgado, and Any Castro.  Morales-Vargas came\n9 to the United States from Guatamala in June 2006.  Until very recently, he was housed at SDCF.\n10 Owino, a Kenyan national, came to the United States in 1998, and has been detained at SDCF since\n11 November 2005.  Delgado, a Salvadorian, entered the United States in 1980.  He has been housed at\n12 SDCF since October 8, 2004.  Castro, a Honduras citizen, was detained at SDCF from September\n13 2006 until February 1, 2007, when she was deported.  Kiniti, also a Kenyan national, came to the\n14 United States in 1997.  First detained at SDCF in November, 2004, Kiniti was transferred from that\n15 location but later returned to SDCF in June 2006.  These plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting\n16 of โall immigration detainees [] who are now or in the future will be confined at [SDCF].โ  (SAC, ยถยถ\n17 9-20, 105.)\n18 The proposed SAC seeks to substitute the defendants named in the FAC with Julie L. Myers,\n19 John P. Torres, Ron Smith, Anthony Cerone, Joe Easterling, Charles Howard, and CCA.  Myers serves\n20 as Assistant Secretary for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (โICEโ), a branch within DHS\n21 charged with detaining and removing non-citizens.  Torres is the director of the Office of Detention\n22 and Removal Operations, a division of ICE that manages the daily detention of immigration detainees.\n23 Smith serves as Director of the ICE San Diego Field Office.  Cerone is the ICE Officer-in-Charge at\n24 SDCF, and Assistant Field Officer Director of the ICE San Diego Field Office.  Easterling and\n25 Howard are Warden and Assistant Warden at SDCF.  CCA, a Maryland incorporated company,\n26 provides detention and corrections services.  Pursuant to contract, CCA houses immigration detainees\n27 in ICE custody at SDCF.  Both ICE and CCA staff work on-site at SDCF, although the facility is\n28 operated primarily by CCA employees.  All defendants are sued in their official capacities.  (SAC,\n- 2 - 05cv1013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 56     Filed 02/27/2007     Page 3 of 9(cid:10)\n1 ยถ21-28.)\n2 The proposed SAC alleges only one claim for relief under the Fifth Amendment Due Process\n3 Clause of the United States Constitution.  Specifically, it alleges:\n4 Defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and omissions with respect to chronic and\nsevere overcrowding at SDCF โ including but not limited to the triple-celling of\n5 immigration detainees and the housing of additional detainees in common\ndayroom spaces โ deprive plaintiffs of adequate shelter, reasonable safety, and\n6 basic human needs, and place them at unreasonable, continuing and foreseeable\nrisk of, inter alia, increased violence, illness, mental suffering, and deteriorating\n7 health.\n8 (SAC at ยถ 111.)  โTriple-cellingโ means to house three detainees in a cell designed for two.  When this\n9 happens, a plastic โboatโ containing a thin sleeping mat is placed on the floor for the third detainee\n10 to sleep on.  (Id. at ยถ 54.)  Plaintiffs allege this practice affects about 675 of the approximately 1000\n11 detainees at SDCF.  (Id. at ยถ2.)  In addition to triple-celling, some detainees are housed in โmakeshift\n12 beds placed in the common dayroom space.โ (Id. at ยถ 41.)  Holding cells and administrative\n13 segregation units are also overcrowded.  (Id. at ยถยถ 75-79.)  โA typical holding cellโ provides just\n14 enough space for 12 detainees to sleep in a row on the floor, side-by-side, touching each other, โlike\n15 sardines.โ  (Id. at ยถ76.)  Administrative segregation is used to house โoverflow detaineesโ and\n16 โdetainees who refuse to be triple-celled.โ  (Id. at ยถ 78.)  Segregated detainees are confined in their\n17 cells for 23 to 24 hours per day and are required to eat all meals in their cells. (Id. at ยถ 79.)  They are\n18 provided only one hour out-of-cell for exercise, five days per week, in a small cement yard surrounded\n19 by a chainlink fence.  (Id.)\n20 The proposed SAC seeks declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the putative class.\n21 Specifically, it seeks: โa judgment declaring that defendantsโ policies . . . violate plaintiffsโ rights\n22 under the Constitution,โ and a judgment โpermanently enjoin[ing] defendants . . . from subjecting\n23 plaintiffs to the unconstitutional conditions.โ  (Id. at โPrayer for Reliefโ (c)(d).)      \n24 II.\n25 LEGAL STANDARD\n26 Leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires, Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), and should\n27 not be denied unless there is evidence of undue delay, bad faith, undue prejudice to the non-movant,\n28 or futility.  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).  Amendment of pleadings is to be permitted\n- 3 - 05cv1013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 56     Filed 02/27/2007     Page 4 of 9(cid:10)\n1 unless the opposing party makes a showing of one of the above factors.  Shipner v. Eastern Airlines,\n2 Inc., 868 F.2d 401, 406-7 (5th Cir. 1989).  โOrdinarily, courts do not consider the validity of a\n3 proposed amended pleading in deciding whether to grant leave to amend.โ  William W. Schwarzer,\n4 et al., Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial, ยถ 8:422(c) (2006); see also Saes Getters S.p.A. v.\n5 Aeronex, Inc., 219 F. Supp. 2d 1081, 1086 (S.D.CA 2002) (the legal sufficiency of a proposed\n6 amendment is more appropriately raised in a motion to dismiss rather than in an opposition to a\n7 motion for leave to amend).  However, leave to amend may be denied if the proposed amendment is\n8 futile, although such denials are rare.  Schwarzer, et al., Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial, ยถ\n9 8:422(c).  An amendment is โfutileโ only if it is clear that no set of facts can be proved under the\n10 amendment which would constitute a valid claim or defense.  See DCD Programs, Ltd. v. Leighton,\n11 833 F.2d 183, 188 (9th Cir. 1987).   \n12 III.\n13 DISCUSSION\n14 Defendants argue amendment of the FAC is futile because: (1) Plaintiffs are no longer subject\n15 to triple-celling conditions, therefore they lack standing to bring suit; (2) Plaintiffs fail to allege an\n16 actual or imminent injury because of triple-celling; (3) triple-celling is not unconstitutional; and (4)\n17 violations  of  the  American  Correctional  Association  (โACAโ)  standards  do  not  amount  to  a\n18 constitutional violation.  DHS argues, among other things, it will be prejudiced if Plaintiffs are\n19 allowed to file the proposed SAC.  These arguments are addressed in turn.\n20 A. Standing\n21 โThe jurisdiction of federal courts depends on the existence of a โcase or controversyโ under\n22 Article III of the Constitution.โ  GTE California, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commโn, 39 F.3d\n23 940, 945 (9th Cir. 1994).  An actual controversy must exist at every stage of the litigation.  See Roe\n24 v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 125 (1973).  โIn general a case becomes moot โwhen the issues presented are\n25 no longer โliveโ or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.โ  Murphy v. Hunt, 455\n26 U.S. 478, 481 (1982).  In other words, a case is moot if the issues presented are no longer of any direct\n27 concern to the parties, and the Court would merely be resolving a hypothetical question.  To determine\n28 whether a request for declaratory and injunctive relief has become moot, the Court asks โwhether the\n- 4 - 05cv1013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 56     Filed 02/27/2007     Page 5 of 9(cid:10)\n1 facts alleged . . . show that there is a substantial controversy, between the parties having adverse legal\n2 interests, of sufficient immediacyโ to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment or injunctive\n3 relief.  Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 402 (1975). \n4 Defendants argue Plaintiffs lack standing because โthe very condition they alleged violates\n5 their constitutional rights โ triple-celling โ is no longer a condition faced by any of the detainees.โ\n6 (Opposition at 7.) (Emphasis added.)  On January 27, 2007, ICE ordered SDCF to transfer 104\n7 detainees to another detention facility.  (Opposition, Ex. 1, ยถ 6.)  Morales-Vargas was among those\n8 transferred.  (Id. at ยถ 7.)  Four days later, ICE ordered SDCF to deport five detainees to Honduras,\n9 among whom was Castro.  (Id. at ยถ 9.)  With respect to the remaining detainees, Defendants declare\n10 โno detainee is triple-celled,โ and โ[a]ll boats have been removed from the housing pods.โ  (Id. at ยถ\n11 11.)  Delgado has been assigned to an upper bunk, and Kiniti and Owino to lower bunks.  (Id.)  Based\n12 on these facts, Defendants contend Plaintiffs โface no risk of impending injury,โ because the condition\n13 for which they sought declaratory and injunctive relief โno longer exists.โ  (Id. at 8.)  Therefore,\n14 according to Defendants, their claims are โmootโ and the amendment is futile.  (Id.) \n15 Defendantsโ argument that Plaintiffsโ claims are moot assumes the injuries alleged stem solely\n16 from โtriple-celling.โ  (Opposition at 7.)  This is not the case.  The proposed SAC alleges a โchronic\n17 and severe overcrowdingโ that includes โbut [is] not limited toโ triple-celling of immigration\n18 detainees.  (SAC, ยถ 111.)  In addition to triple-celling, detainees at SDCF are allegedly forced to sleep\n19 on โmakeshift beds in the common dayroom space.โ  (Id. at ยถยถ 2, 41.)  โIn the most overcrowded pods,\n20 ten to fifteen detainees are housed in the dayroom on bunk beds.โ  (Id. at ยถ 70.)  As a result, โ100 to\n21 120 detainees are routinely housed in pods designed to hold only 64 to 68 detainees.โ  (Id. at ยถ 52.)\n22 Plaintiffs also allege detainees experience overcrowding at โholding cellsโ while awaiting deportation,\n23 release from the facility, or transportation to an off-site location.  (Id. at ยถ 75.)  Often, detainees are\n24 held at โholding cellsโ for more than 12 hours, some even for several days.  (Id. ยถยถ 76-77.)  โA typical\n25 holding cellโ provides just enough space for 12 detainees to sleep in a row on the floor, side-by-side,\n26 touching each other โlike sardines.โ  (Id. at ยถ 76.)  Plaintiffs further allege overflow detainees and\n27 detainees who refuse to be triple-celled are subject to oppressive confinement conditions in the\n28 administrative segregation unit.  (Id.  at ยถยถ 78-79.)  These allegations specify conditions of\n- 5 - 05cv1013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 56     Filed 02/27/2007     Page 6 of 9(cid:10)\n1 overcrowding unrelated to โtriple-celling.โ \n2 Defendants also claim that 104 detainees have been permanently discharged from SDCF and\n3 transferred to another detention center.  Based on the allegations in the SAC, that leaves the\n4 population at SDCF at approximately 900.  (SAC, ยถ 106.)  It is unclear, however, whether SDCF still\n5 surpasses its capacity, whether any detainees are housed in the โdayroom on bunk beds,โ id., ยถ 70, or,\n6 whether the holding cells have become less crowded in general.  Defendants do not contend the\n7 individual pods do not exceed their capacity; nor do they claim conditions throughout the facility have\n8 improved.  It therefore cannot be said that Plaintiffsโ proposed amendment is futile.  Foman, 371 U.S.\n9 at 182. \n10 It is also โwell-settled that โa defendantโs voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not\n11 deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.  Friends of the Earth,\n12 Inc.v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000).  โA case might become\n13 moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not\n14 reasonably be expected to occur.โ  Id. (citing United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn.,\n15 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968)).  โThe โheavy burden of persuadingโ the court that the challenged conduct\n16 cannot reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party asserting mootness.โ  Id. \n17 Even assuming Plaintiffsโ claims hinge entirely on triple-celling and no detainees are currently\n18 subject to that practice, Defendants have not met their โโheavy burden of persuadingโโ the court that\n19 triple-celling cannot reasonably be expected to start up again.  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189.\n20 Defendants, in their opposition, do not state that they would not reinstate the practice sometime in the\n21 future; rather, Defendants simply declare that all detainees are no longer subjected to triple-celling.\n22 Given that triple-celling is alleged to have been a โconsistent practice at the facility for over two\n23 years,โ (SAC, ยถ 2), that the pods often exceeded capacity by over 50 percent, (id.), and that the\n24 detaineesโ numerous petitions to SDCF regarding triple-celling went unheard and unaddressed, (id.\n25 at ยถ 88), Defendantsโ assertion now that no detainees are currently triple-celled fails to establish โit\n26 [is] absolutely clearโ that triple-celling will not occur in the future.  Accordingly, Defendantsโ\n27 voluntary cessation of triple-celling does not render the case moot. \n28 B. Sufficiency of Alleged Injury\n- 6 - 05cv1013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 56     Filed 02/27/2007     Page 7 of 9(cid:10)\n1 Defendants contend the amendment is futile because Plaintiffs have not alleged โthey have\n2 suffered actual harm, or face personal impending harmโ as a result of triple-celling.  Defendantsโ\n3 argument is two-fold: (1) the failure to allege an actual harm deprives Plaintiffs of standing, i.e,\n4 Plaintiffs have not demonstrated an injury in fact; and (2) the same defect shows the allegations are\n5 โinsufficient to state a claimโ for injunctive relief.  (Opposition 8-9.)  \n6 It is well-established that to adequately allege standing, a plaintiff must allege: (1) an injury\n7 that is sufficiently โconcrete and particularized,โ as well as โactual or imminent,โ (2) a causal\n8 connection between the injury and the alleged wrong; and (3) redressibility.  Lujan v. Defendants of\n9 Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  โAt the pleading stage, general allegations of injury resulting from\n10 the defendantโs conduct may suffice,โ and the court presumes that โgeneral allegations embrace those\n11 specific facts that are necessary to support a claim.โ  Id.  When injunctive relief is sought, litigants\n12 must adduce a โcredible threatโ of recurrent injury.  Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 (1983)\n13 (holding โLyonsโ standing to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to\n14 suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers.โ).  \n15 Defendants must demonstrate the amendment is โfutileโ and that no set of facts could be\n16 proved under the amendment which would confer standing or allow injunctive relief.  See DCD\n17 Programs, 833 F.2d at 188.  Defendants have not met this burden.  The SAC alleges conditions of\n18 overcrowding that, if proved, may amount to a constitutional violation.  For example, the SAC avers\n19 that the housing conditions at SDCF create serious health problems for detainees, with โparticularly\n20 deleterious effect on asthmatics,โ such as Owino.  (SAC, ยถ 81.)  Kiniti alleges he was forced to share\n21 a cell with a mentally-ill detainee who subsequently assaulted another cellmate.  (Id. at ยถ 83.)  The\n22 SAC also alleges facts tending to show a likelihood of recurring injury.  (See id. at  ยถยถ 86-88, 98-103.)\n23 Crediting these allegations, as the Court must at this stage of the proceedings, it cannot be said that\n24 no set of facts can be proved under the amendment that would confer standing or provide injunctive\n25 relief. \n26 C. Sufficiency of Alleged Constitutional Violations\n27 Defendants argue the proposed amendment is futile because: (1) โtriple-celling is not\n28 unconstitutional,โ (opposition at 10-12), and (2) โviolations of ACA standards fail to state a\n- 7 - 05cv1013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 56     Filed 02/27/2007     Page 8 of 9(cid:10)\n1 constitutional violation claim.โ  (Id. at 12.)  These arguments fall short of establishing futility.  The\n2 first argument fails because, as already pointed out, the SAC alleges conditions of overcrowding\n3 caused by various failed policies and practices, โincluding but not limited toโ triple-celling.  Thus,\n4 assuming triple-celling is not per se unconstitutional, Plaintiffsโ allegations are not โfutileโ because\n5 they have alleged illegal practices unrelated to triple-celling.  The second argument is also unavailing\n6 because even if some ACA violations do not amount to a constitutional violation, others might.  See,\n7 e.g., Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1248-49 (9th Cir. 1982) (overcrowding can, under certain\n8 circumstances, result in specific effects that form the basis of a constitutional violation).  This is a fact\n9 intensive inquiry that must be explored at later stages of the proceedings, not in a motion for leave to\n10 amend.  \n11 D. Prejudice\n12 DHS argues in its amicus brief it โwill be substantially prejudicedโ if  the amendment is\n13 allowed because Plaintiff โhas had two years to conduct discovery and otherwise pursue the\n14 allegations in his complaint.โ  (Brief at 5.)1  Theoretically, the proposed defendants would have less\n15 time to do the same, if added at this stage of the proceedings.  However, very little has happened in\n16 this case.  Kiniti was proceeding pro se until very recently.  It appears no discovery has been\n17 conducted, and no deadline for filing amended pleadings or joining new parties has been set.\n18 Accordingly, any prejudice DHS may experience does not warrant denial of Plaintiffsโ motion for\n19 leave to amend.  See Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. Rose, 893 F.2d 1074, 1079 (9th Cir. 1990)\n20 (to justify denial of leave to amend, the prejudice must be substantial); see also Bell v. Allstate Life\n21\n1 DHS also argues the SAC attempts to join plaintiffs who are not connected by a common\n22 question of law or fact.  (Brief at 3-4.)  The Court concludes joinder of these Plaintiffs satisfies Rule\n20.  Rule 20(a) imposes two specific requirements for the permissive joinder of parties: (1) a right to\n23 relief must be asserted by, or against, each plaintiff relating to or arising out of the same transaction\nor occurrence; and (2) some question of law or fact common to all parties must exist.  Desert Empire\n24 Bank v. Insurance Co. of North America, 623 F.2d 1371, 1374 (9th Cir. 1980).  First, the proposed\nPlaintiffsโ claim no doubt arises out of the same transaction or occurrence.  The SAC alleges these\n25 Plaintiffs have been injured by the same policies and practices of Defendants with respect to chronic\novercrowding at SDCF.  Second, the asserted claim raises common questions of law and fact.  Among\n26 other things, the case asks this Court to determine whether the alleged conditions of overcrowding\nviolate the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment.  Further, Plaintiffs seek only injunctive\n27 and declaratory relief.  Accordingly, joinder of the proposed Plaintiffs is proper.  See League to Save\nLake Tahoe v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 558 F.2d 914 (9th Cir. 1977) (Rule 20 is to be\n28 construed liberally in order to promote trial convenience and to expedite the final determination of\ndisputes, thereby preventing multiple lawsuits.)\n- 8 - 05cv1013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 56     Filed 02/27/2007     Page 9 of 9(cid:10)\n1 Ins. Co., 160 F.3d 452, 454 (8th Cir. 1998) (โany prejudice to the nonmovant must be weighed against\n2 the prejudice to the moving party by not allowing the amendment.โ)  \n3 Alternatively, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(3)(A), DHS requests a postponement of the\n4 scheduled hearing on Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification, if Plaintiff is granted leave to amend.\n5 The request is reasonable under the circumstances.  Therefore, the hearing on motion for class\n6 certification is vacated and rescheduled as set forth below.\n7 IV.\n8 CONCLUSION\n9 For these reasons, Plaintiffโs motion for leave to amend the complaint is GRANTED.  The\n10 Clerk of Court shall file the proposed SAC.  Defendants shall respond to the SAC pursuant to the\n11 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Local Rules of this Court.\n12 Plaintiffsโ class certification motion shall be heard on May 25, 2007, at 1:30 p.m.  Defendants\n13 shall file their opposition to the motion on or before May 4, 2007.  Plaintiffs shall file their reply on\n14 or before May 14, 2007.   \n15 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n16 DATED:  February 27, 2007\n17\n18 HON. DANA M.

Defendants  agree  that  for  the  term  of this  Agreement  the  population  of \n3 \nimmigration detainees in ICE custody in each unit and pod at SDCF that is designated to detain, \n4 \nhold, or house immigration detainees in ICE custody shall not exceed the design capacity for that \n5 \nunit or pod, as described in Footnote 1 of this Agreement. \n6 \n9.  The Parties agree that previously scheduled discovery and pretrial proceedings as \n7 \n8  set forth in the October 11, 2007 Case Management Conference Order, will be stayed to provide a \n9  reasonable opportunity for Defendants to produce confirmatory discovery as set forth below, and \n10 \nfor Plaintiffs to review that discovery.  This stay of proceedings shall not affect proceedings \n11 \nnecessary  to  implement  the  Agreement.  Such  confirmatory  discovery  shall  be  limited  to \n12 \ndocuments that relate to SDCF's detention of immigration detainees on or after June 1, 2008. \n13 \n10.  CCA Defendants agree to produce and make available to Plaintiffs the followi~ยฅ . \n14 \n15  confirmatory discovery by June 3, 2008: \n16  a.  Documents confirming the dimensions of cells, hold rooms and living areas \n17 \nthat are used to house immigration detainees in ICE custody at SDCF; \n18 \nb.  Daily Pod Rosters showing the current housing and bed assignments of \n19 \nimmigration detainees in ICE custody at two-week intervals throughout the \n20 \nconfirmatory discovery period; and Holding Cell Receiving Log showing \n21 \nthe assignment of immigration detainees to hold rooms at SDCF for a 48-\n22 \n23  hour  period  during  each  two-week  interval  during  the  confirmatory \n24  discovery period. \n25 \nc.  Documents demonstrating that population levels of immigration detainees , \n26 \nin ICE custody at SDCF are at or below design capacity for the areas where \n27 \nsuch immigration detainees in ICE custody are housed. \n28 \n4.  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL \n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 146-2      Filed 06/04/2008     Page 5 of 9\n1  11.  Plaintiffs agree to review the above confirmatory discovery and make a conclusion \n2 \nregarding compliance by July 1, 2008. \n3 \n12.  If confirmatory discovery produced as set forth above confirms that Defendants \n4 \nare complying with Paragraph 8 of the Agreement and that the population ~evels of immigration \n5 \ndetainees  at  SDCF  do  not  exceed  SDCF's  design  capacity,  the  Parties  will  stipulate  to \n6 \nadministratively close this action for six (6) months, during which time the stay of discovery and \n7 \n8  pretrial proceedings shall remain in effect.  Nevertheless, in the event that changed circumstances \n9  or emergency situations necessitate detaining, holding, or housing immigration detainees in ICE \n10 \ncustody at the Facility in excess of its design capacity for those areas where such immigration \n11 \ndetainees  in  ICE  custody  are  housed,  Defendants  shall,  within  fifteen  (15)  days  of such \n12 \nunexpected situations, notify Plaintiffs' counsel to account for either: (i) unforeseeable changed \n13 \ncircumstances, or (ii) emergency situations.  \"Unforeseeable changed circumstances\" include, but \n14 \nare not limited to, unforeseeable increases in population levels due to accelerated immigration \n15 \n16  enforcement efforts,  or unanticipated  strikes,  lockouts,  or  other  labor  conditions  or security \n17 \nthreats arising within the Facility.  \"Emergency situations\" include, but are not limited to, Acts of \n18 \nGod, war, invasion, hostilities, natural disasters including local fires or other unforeseeable events \n19 \ncreating an immediate need to increase immigration population levels due to its impact on nearby . \n20 \ndetention facilities.  The Parties agree that Defendants shall (i) not be liable for exceeding design \n21 \ncapaCity at any time that changed circumstances or emergency situations exist and (ii) make every \n22 \n23  effort to reduce population levels to design capacity within 30 days after changed circumstances \n24  or emergency situations have abated. \n25 \n13.  During the period of administrative closure, CCA Defendants agree to produce \n26 \nupdated confirmatory discovery, as described in Paragraph 10 of the Agreement, on October 1, \n27 \n2008 and on January 9, 2009. \n28 \n5.  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL \n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 146-2      Filed 06/04/2008     Page 6 of 9\n1  14.  If confirmatory  discovery  produced  while  the  case  is  administratively  closed \n2 \nconfirms  that  Defendants  are  complying  with  Paragraph  8  of the  Agreement  and  that the \n3 \npopulation  levels  of immigration  detainees  in  ICE  custody  at  SDCF  do  not  exceed  design \n4 \ncapacity for those areas where such immigration detainees in ICE custody are housed, the Parties \n5 \nwill stipulate to dismiss this action, with prejudice, on January 28, 2009. \n6 \n15.  It is  the Parties'  understanding,  intention and agreement that a dismissal with \n7 \n8  prejudice pursuant to this Agreement would have no preclusive effect on any claim or issue raised \n9  by any class member arising from conditions existing at SDCF subsequent to the date this lawsuit \n10 \nis dismissed. \n11 \nIV.  Court Approval and Notice to the Class \n12 \n16.  The Parties acknowledge that Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . \n13 \nrequires that the Court must direct notice to the class and approve this Agreement before the โข \n14 \nclaims of the certified class may be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to this Agreement. \n15 \n16  17.  Within 14 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, the Parties will jointly \n17 \nmove the Court to approve and direct notice to the class, schedule a fairness hearing, and approve \n18 \nthe Agreement.  The Parties agree to  commence the  process  of confirmatory  discovery  and \n19 \nreview, as set forth in Paragraphs 9-11, while simultaneously seeking the Court's approval ofthe \n20 \nmanner  of notice  and  this  Agreement.  In  the  event  that  the  Court  does  not  approve  this \n21 \nAgreement, the Parties agree to jointly move the Court for a new scheduling order for this Action. \n22 \n23  18.  Notice to the class will be accomplished by posting a written Notice at SDCF, in \n24  English and in Spanish, as follows2: Notices will be posted in each ICE housing unit/pod on the \n25 \nexisting detainee notice boards.  Additionally, notice will be provided to immigration detainees in \n26 \nICE  custody who  are housed  in  segregation/protective  custody at the  time  of initial Notice \n27 \n28  2 A proposed Notice is attached as Exhibit 1 to the Settlement Agreement. \n6.

Notice will \n2 \nalso be distributed to immigration detainees in ICE custody who are housed in the medical unit at \n3 \nthe time of initial Notice distribution by distributing a Notice to each ICE medical unit detainee. \n4 \nFollowing the initial segregation/protective custody Notice distribution, and thereafter during the \n5 \ntime  period  set forth  in  Paragraph  19,  below,  new  incoming segregation/protective  custody \n6 \nimmigration detainees in ICE custody will be provided a copy of the Notice upon entry to the \n7 \n8  segregation/protective custody unit. \n9 \n19.  The Notice  shall  be  posted  and/or  provided to  immigration  detainees  in  ICE \n10 \ncustody, as stated above, no later than ten (10) days following the Court's approval of the form \n11 \nand manner of the Notice.  The Notice shall remain posted until the date that objections to the \n12 \nAgreement are due by order of the Court. \n13 \nv. \nProtection of Discovery Material \n14 \n15  20.  Defendants agree to preserve  documents  responsive to  Plaintiffs'  First Set of \n16  Requests for Production of Documents during the term of this Agreement. \n17 \n21.

(Doc. 112). Defendants have moved for reconsideration. After careful consideration of\n21 the arguments, the Court DENIES Defendantsโ motion. However, Defendants have pointed out an\n22 error in the Order that does not affect the Courtโs decision. Thus, this Order clarifies the August 17,\n23 2007 Order.\n24 In the August 17, 2007 Order, the Court incorrectly stated, โ[i]n Hodgers-Durgin, [199 F.3d\n25 1037, 1041 (9th Cir. 1999)], the court affirmed the district courtโs finding that the plaintiffs had\n26 standing to seek injunctive relief.โ In fact, in that case, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district courtโs\n27 finding that the plaintiffs did not have standing to seek injunctive relief. Id. at 1039. The Courtโs error\n28 was in focusing exclusively upon an analysis of the United States Constitutionโs Article III standing\n- 1 - 05cv1013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 133      Filed 10/29/2007     Page 2 of 2\n1 requirements without fully analyzing the requirements for standing when seeking injunctive relief.\n2 That analysis follows.\n3 The court in Hodgers-Durgin held plaintiffs did not show a โlikelihood of substantial and\n4 immediate irreparable injuryโ as required when seeking an injunction against the Government. The\n5 plaintiffs in Hodgers-Durgin sought injunctive relief from certain policies implemented by Border\n6 Patrol. The court found plaintiffs frequently came into contact with Border Patrol agents, but each of\n7 the two named plaintiffs were stopped only once in ten years. Those facts were insufficient to show\n8 plaintiffs faced a โlikelihoodโ of again being stopped by Border Patrol. \n9 Conversely, in the instant case, as described in the August 17, 2007 Order, Defendants\n10 admittedly engaged in triple-celling for several years. Moreover, Defendants continue to assert triple-\n11 celling is not unconstitutional, and continue to engage in other allegedly unconstitutional practices\n12 such as housing detainees in the common day room. (Order at 6:3-7). Finally, Defendants have failed\n13 to assure the Court that the practice of triple-celling will not resume in the future. (Id. at 6:7-12). These\n14 facts are sufficient to establish a likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury. \n15 Therefore, Plaintiffs have both Article III standing and standing to pursue injunctive relief as\n16 a class. Accordingly, Defendantโs motion is DENIED.\n17 IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n18\n19 DATED:  October 29, 2007\n20\n21 HON. DANA M. SABRAW\nUnited States District Judge\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n- 2 - 05cv1013",

MEYERS, et al.,\n14\nDefendants.\n15\n16\n17 This matter comes before the Court on Defenda ntsโ motions to dismiss Plaintiffsโ Second\n18 Amended Complaint (โSACโ).  The m atter has been fully briefed a nd argued.  Having carefully\n19 considered the papers submitted and the argument of counsel, the Court grants in part and denies in\n20 part Defendantsโ motions.\n21 I.\n22 BACKGROUND\n23 The facts of this case are well known to the parties.  Therefore, the Court sets forth only those\n24 facts relevant to the present motion.  \n25 Plaintiffs have filed suit alleging serious overcrowding at the San Diego Correctional Facility\n26 (SDCF) dating back to at least November 2004.  Plaintiffs include Isaac Kigondu Kiniti, Jose Morales-\n27 Vargas, Sylvester Owino, Hernan Ismael Delgado, and Any Castro.  Of these Plaintiffs, only Kiniti\n28 and Owino currently are detained  at the SDCF.  The rem aining Plaintiffs have been rem oved or\n- 1 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 transferred: Castro was deported to Honduras on February 1, 2007, Morales-Vargas was deported to\n2 Guatemala on May 11, 2007, and Delgado was transferred from SDCF to El Centro, California on\n3 February 16, 2007.  Based on changes that Defendanst made to the housing conditions challenged by\n4 Plaintiffs in this lawsuit and the relocation of  Plaintiffs Castro, Morales-Vargas and Delgado,\n5 Defendants move to dismiss the SAC as moot.  \n6 The SAC alleges a violation of the Due Process Clause under the Fifth Amendment of the\n7 United States Constitution due to โchronic and severe overcrowding.โ  It alleges:\n8 Defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and omissions with respect to chronic and\nsevere overcrowding at SDCF โ including but not limited to the triple-celling of\n9 immigration detainees and the housing of additional detainees in common day\nroom spaces โ deprive plaintiffs of adequate shelter, reasonable safety, and basic\n10 human needs, and place them at unreasonable, continuing and foreseeable risk\nof, inter alia, increased violence, illness, mental suffering, and deteriorating\n11 health.\n12 SAC at ยถ 111.  According to the SAC, โtriple-celling oโccurs when three detainees are housed in a cell\n13 designed for two.  When this happens, a plastic โboatโ containing a thin sleeping mat is placed on the\n14 floor for the third detainee to sleep on.  Id. at ยถ 54.  Plaintiffs allege this practice affects about 675 of\n15 the approximately 1000 detainees at SDCF. I d. at ยถ2.  In addition to triple-celling, some detainees are\n16 housed in โmakeshift beds placed in the common day room space.โ Id. at ยถ 41.  Holding cells and\n17 administrative segregation units are also overcrowded.   Id. at ยถยถ 75-79.  โA typical holding cellโ\n18 provides just enough space for 12 detainees to sleepi n a row on the floor, side-by-side, touching each\n19 other, โlike sardines.โ  Id. at ยถ76.  Administrative segregation is used to house โoverflow detaineesโ\n20 and โdetainees who refuse to be triple-celled.โ I d. at ยถ 78.  Segregated detainees are confined in their\n21 cells for 23 to 24 hours per day and are required to eat all meals in their cells. Id. at ยถ 79.  They are\n22 provided only one hour out-of-cell fore xercise, five days per week, in a small cement yard surrounded\n23 by a chainlink fence.  Id.\n24 Based upon these allegations, the SAC seeks j udgment: (1) declaring that such policies  \n25 โviolate plaintiffsโ rights under the Constitution,โ and (2) permanently enjoining Defendants โfrom\n26 subjecting plaintiffs to the unconstitutional conditions.โ  Id., โPrayer for Reliefโ (c)(d). \n27 / / /\n28 / / /\n- 2 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 II. \n2 LEGAL STANDARD\n3 A. 12(b)(1)\n4 โBecause standing and mootness both pertain to a federal courtโs subject-matter jurisdiction\n5 under Article III, they are properly raised in a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n6 12(b)(1), not Rule 12(b)(6).โ 1White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1242 (9th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).\n7 A rule 12(b)(1) challenge can be either facial or factual.  Id.  With a facial attack, a defendant may\n8 argue the allegations on the face of the com plaint are insufficient to show federal subject m atter\n9 jurisdiction.  See Warren v. Fox Family Wordwide, Inc,. 328 F.3d 1136, 1139 (9th Cir. 2003).  As with\n10 a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must treat the allegations in the complaint as true and draw all\n11 inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  See Gould v. U.S., 220 F.3d 169, 176 (3rd Cir. 2000).  W ith a\n12 factual attack, however, the moving party โdisputes the truth of the allegations that, by themselves,\n13 would otherwise invoke federal jurisdiction.โ  Safe Air For Everyone v. Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039\n14 (9th Cir. 2004).  In reviewing the challenge, the court may consider  and weigh evidence outside the\n15 pleadings without converting the motion into a motion for summary judgment.  Id. (citations omitted);\n16 Roberts v. Corrothers, 812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 1987).   The Court need not presum e the\n17 truthfulness of the plaintiffโs allegations. I d.  Once the moving party has presented affidavits or other\n18 evidence supporting its motion, the non-moving party must furnish evidence necessary to satisfy its\n19 burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction.  Id. \n20 B. Standing -- Mootness\n21 โThe jurisdiction of federal courts depends on the existence of a โcase or controversyโ under\n22 Article III of the Constitution.โ  GTE California, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commโn, 39 F.3d\n23 940, 945 (9th Cir. 1994).  An actual controversy must exist at every stage of the litigation.  See Roe\n24 v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 125 (1973).  โIn general a case becomes moot โwhen the issues presented are\n25\n26 1 Two motions are at issue: one filed by Defendants Corrections Corporation of America, Inc.\n(โCCAโ), Easterling and Howard, and the other by the remaining defendants.  Both motions challenge\n27 subject matter jurisdiction based on mootness.  CCA, Easterling and Howard move to dismiss under\nRule 12(b)(6), while the remaining defendants move to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1).  Because\n28 mootness questions concern subject matter jurisdiction, the Court will construe the 12(b)(6) motion\nas a 12(b)(1) motion. \n- 3 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 no longer โliveโ or the parties lack a leglaly cognizable interest in the outcome.โ  Murphy v. Hunt, 455\n2 U.S. 478, 481 (1982).  In other words, a case is moot if the issues presented are no longer of any direct\n3 concern to the parties, and the Court would merely be resolving a hypothetical question.  Where a\n4 defendant  asserts the โquestion sought to be a djudicated  has been m ooted  by subsequent\n5 developments,โ Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 96 (1968), it bears the burden of proof.  Mangual v.\n6 Rotger-Sabat, 317 F.3d 45, 60 (1st Cir. 2003) (โ[T]he burden of establishing mootness rests squarely\n7 on the party raising it.โ). \n8 III. \n9 DISCUSSION\n10 Defendants mount a factual jurisdictional challenge, contending (1) Morales-Vargas, Delgado\n11 and Castroโs claims are moot because they are no longer detained at SDCF; and (2) although Kiniti\n12 and Owino remain at the facility, their claim s are moot because the conditions they challenge  no\n13 longer exist.\n14 A. Morales-Vargas, Delgado and Castro\n15 Defendants argue the claim s of Morales-Vargas, Delgado and Castro are m oot because\n16 Morales-Vargas and Castro have been deported, and Delgado was transferred to another facility.  CCA\n17 Mot. to Dismiss, at 6-7.  A case โbecomes moot โwhen the issues presented are no longer โliveโ or the\n18 parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.โ  Murphy, 455 U.S. at 481.  Because Castro\n19 and Morales-Vargas have been deported, neither ha s a cognizable interest in the outcom e of this\n20 litigation.  Plaintiffs do not argue otherwise.  Accordingly, their claims are dismissed. \n21 With respect to Delgado, Plaintiffs argue his claim falls under the โcapable of repetition, yet\n22 evading reviewโ exception to the mootness doctrine.  Id. at 13.  This exception provides that a named\n23 plaintiff may litigate class certification even though he has no personal stake in the outcome of the\n24 litigation.  U.S. Parole Commission v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 398 (1980).  The exception applies\n25 where the named plaintiff had a personal stake at the outset of the litigation, and the claim may arise\n26 again with respect to that plaintiff. I d.  Here, Plaintiffs have established a reasonable expectation that\n27 Delgado may be transferred back to SDCF.  Delgado remains in ICE custody and is being held at the\n28 El Centro Service Processing Center.  It is not uncommon for detainees to be transferred back and\n- 4 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 forth between SDCF and El Centro.  Kiniti Decl. ยถ 9.  Indeed, Plaintiff Kiniti and others have been\n2 transferred between the two facilities on several occasions.   Id. ยถยถ 2-5.  Delgado has therefore\n3 demonstrated that his claim is โcapable of repetition, yet evading review.โ  The motion is denied as\n4 to Delgado.\n5 B. Kiniti and Owino\n6 The SAC alleges Plaintiffs are subject to a condition of chronic overcrowding arising from:\n7 (1) triple-celling; (2) the housing of some detainees in makeshift beds in common day room space;\n8 (3) overcrowded holding cells; and (4) the housing  of overflow detainees in an adm inistrative\n9 segregation unit.  ICE Mot. to Dismiss, at 3.  \n10 Defendants contend Kiniti and Owinoโs claims are moot because the conditions they challenge\n11 no longer exist and are unlikely to recur.  In suppotr, Defendants submit declarations from Easterling\n12 and Timothy L. Perry, Deputy Assistant Director  for Detention Managem ent for the Office of\n13 Detention and Removal Operations.  Both a ffiants have informed the Court that SDCF has been\n14 operating below capacity since January 28, 2007, andth e allegedly wrongful conduct no longer exists.\n15 On January 27, 2007, shortly after the SAC was filed,I CE directed CCA to prepare 104 detainees for\n16 deportation and/or transfer to other facilities.  Easterling Decl., at ยถ 10.  That discharge negated the\n17 need to continue any of the practices challenged in the SAC.  Id. at ยถ 11.  Thus, no ICE detainees are\n18 currently triple celled; SDCF โhas refraine d from using โboatsโ since January 28, 2007;โ no\n19 immigration detainees have been held in a holdnig cell for longer than 12 hours; and โno immigration\n20 pod, administrative segregation unit or ICE holding cell has exceeded capacity.โ  Easterling Decl. at\n21 ยถ 28; Perry Decl. at ยถยถ 19-20; 25-26.  In addition, as of May 1, 2007, only 11 detainees were housed\n22 in the common day room, and these assignments are โtemporary,โ usually not exceeding 24 hours\n23 while appropriate housing is being determined. Perry Decl. At ยถยถ 22 and 23; Easterling Decl., ยถ 31.\n24 Perry states, given population le vels between 575 and 692 detainees per day, that he has โno\n25 reasonable expectationโ that any of the alleged conduct will recur.  Perry Decl., at ยถยถ 17, 26. \n26 Defendants, however, have failed to satisfy their heavy burden of dem onstrating it is\n27 โabsolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful conduct could not reasonably be expected to recur.โ\n28 Carlton v. United Academics-AAUP/AFT/APEA AFL-CIO , 265 F.3d 778, 786 (9th Cir. 2001)\n- 5 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 (emphasis in original).  Defendantsโ burden of persuasion is โstringent.โ  Friends of the Earth, Inc.v.\n2 Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000).  This heavy burden is met\n3 where, for example, a defendant acknowledges inw  riting that the challenged conduct is unlawful and\n4 provides assurances the offending conduct will not be repeated. S ee Forest Guardians v. U.S. Forest\n5 Serv., 329 F.3d 1089, 1095 (9th Cir. 2003) (It is โunreasonable to thinkโ defendant โwould return to\n6 conduct it has admitted to this court is constitutionally deficient.โ). S ee also Carlton, 265 F.3d at 780\n7 (โIt is unreasonable to think that the Union would resort to conduct that it had adimtted in writing was\n8 constitutionally deficient and had attempted to correct ...โ).  \n9 In contrast, Defendants here have not acknow ledged, in writing or otherwise, that the\n10 challenged conduct is wrong or that overcrowding eve rwas a problem at SDCF.  Nor have they stated\n11 they would not reinstate the practices in question.  In fact, Defendants dispute whether triple-celling\n12 is  unconstitutional and maintain such practices do โnot result in a violation of Plaintiffsโ civil rights.โ\n13 CCA Mot. to Dismiss, at 5, n.1.  Under these circum stances, Defendantsโ representation that no\n14 detainees are currently being triple-celled and they don ot expect such to recur, is insufficient to render\n15 the controversy moot.  \n16 IV. \n17 CONCLUSION\n18 Defendantsโ motions to dismiss the SAC are granted in part and denied in part as set forth\n19 above.  \n20 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n21 DATED:  June 21, 2007\n22\n23 HON. DANA M. SABRAW\nUnited States District Judge\n24 cc:  all parties;\nJudge Lewis\n25\n26\n27\n28\n- 6 -\n05cv1013",

      "text": "1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n9 SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n10\n11 ISAAC KIGONDU KINITI, CASE NO. 05cv1013 DMS (PCL)\n12 Plaintiff, ORDER GRANTING MOTION\nvs. FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\n13\nJULIE L. MEYERS, et al.,\n14\nDefendants.\n15\n16 This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification.  Defendants\n17 have submitted oppositions to the motion, and Plaintiffs have submitted a reply.  Additionally, at oral\n18 argument on July 6, 2007, the Court ordered the partise to submit supplemental briefing regarding the\n19 applicability of 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(f)(1 ) and whether differences in the im migration status of class\n20 members present a barrier to class certification.  Having considered the papers submitted, including\n21 the supplemental briefing and the arguments of counsel, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffsโ motion for\n22 class certification.\n23 I.\n24 BACKGROUND\n25 The facts of this case are well known to the partise.  Therefore, the Court sets forth only those\n26 facts relevant to the present motion.  Plaintiffs have filed suit alleging serious overcrowding at the San\n27 Diego Correctional Facility (SDCF) dating back to at least November 2004.  Plaintiffs include Isaac\n28 Kigondu Kiniti, Sylvester Owino, and Hernan Ismael Delgado.  Delgado, however, was transferred\n- 1 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 from SDCF to El Centro, California on February 16, 2007, where he is currently housed. \n2 The SAC alleges a violation of the Due Pr ocess Clause under the Fifth Amendment of the\n3 United States Constitution due to โchronic and severe overcrowding.โ  It alleges:\n4 Defendantsโ policies, practices, acts, and omissions with respect to chronic and\nsevere overcrowding at SDCF โ including but not limited to the triple-celling of\n5 immigration detainees and the housing of additional detainees in common day\nroom spaces โ deprive plaintiffs of adequate shelter, reasonable safety, and basic\n6 human needs, and place them at unreasonable, continuing and foreseeable risk\nof, inter alia, increased violence, illness, m ental suffering, and deteriorating\n7 health.\n8 SAC at ยถ 111.  According to the SAC, โtriple-celling โoccurs when three detainees are housed in a cell\n9 designed for two.  When this happens, a plastic โboatโ containing a thin sleeping mat is placed on the\n10 floor for the third detainee to sleep on.  Id. at ยถ 54.  Plaintiffs allege this practice affects about 675 of\n11 the approximately 1000 detainees at SDCF. I d. at ยถ2.  In addition to triple-celling, some detainees are\n12 housed in โmakeshift beds placed in the common day room space.โ Id. at ยถ 41.  Holding cells and\n13 administrative segregation units are also overcrowded.   Id. at ยถยถ 75-79.  โA typical holding cellโ\n14 provides just enough space for 12 detainees to sleep side-by-side on the floor โlike sardines.โ  Id. at\n15 ยถ76.  Administrative segregation is used to house โoverflow detaineesโ and โdetainees who refuse to\n16 be triple-celled.โ  Id. at ยถ 78.  Segregated detainees are confined in their cells for 23 to 24 hours per\n17 day and are required to eat all meals in their cells. Id. at ยถ 79.  They are provided only one hour out-of-\n18 cell for exercise, five days per week, in a small cement yard surrounded by a chainlink fence.  Id.\n19 Based upon these allegations, the SAC seeks judgm ent: (1) declaring that such policies\n20 โviolate plaintiffsโ rights under the Constitution,โ and (2) enjoining Defendants โfrom  subjecting\n21 plaintiffs to the unconstitutional conditions.โ  Id., โPrayer for Reliefโ (c)(d). \n22 II.\n23 LEGAL STANDARDS\n24 A. Standing and Ripeness\n25 The requirements of Article III standing are well-etsablished: A plaintiff must show: (1) he has\n26 suffered an โinjury in factโ that is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or im minent, not\n27 conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant;\n28 and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable\n- 2 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 decision.  Sacks v. Office of Foreign Assets Contro,l 466 F.3d 764, 771 (9th Cir. 2006) (citingF riends\n2 of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidl aw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81 (2000)).  Article III\n3 standing requires the plaintiff to establish standingf or each and every challenge and form of relief he\n4 seeks.  Id.  \n5 The โ[r]ipeness doctrine protects against premature adjudication of suits in which declaratory\n6 relief is sought,โ Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1044 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc), in\n7 order to prevent โentanglement in theoretical or abstract disagreements that do not yet have a concrete\n8 impact on the parties.โ  18 Unnamed โJohn Smithโ Prisoners v. Meese, 871 F.2d 881, 883 (9th Cir.\n9 1989).  โIn โmeasuring whether the litigant has asserted an injury that is real and concrete rather than\n10 speculative and hypothetical, the ripeness injury merges almost completely with standing.โโ  Scott v.\n11 Pasadena Unified School Dist., 306 F.3d 646, 662 (9th Cir. 2002).  โAs a prudential matter, we will\n12 not consider a claim to be ripe for judicial resolution โif it rests upon contingent future events that may\n13 not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.โโ  Id.   \n14 B.  Class Certification\n15 A district court may certify a class only if: โ(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all\n16 members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law and fact common to the class; (3) the claims\n17 or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the\n18 representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.โ  Dukes v. Wal-Mart,\n19 Inc., 474 F.3d 1214, 1224 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)).  โThe district court must also\n20 find that at least one of the following three conditions are satisfied: (1) the prosecution of separate\n21 actions would create a risk of: (a) inconsistent ovr arying adjudications or (b) individual adjudications\n22 dispositive of the interests of other members not a party to those adjudications; (2) the party opposing\n23 the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class; or (3) the questions\n24 of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only\n25 individual members, and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient\n26 adjudication of the controversy.โ I d. (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)).  Thep arty seeking certification bears\n27 the burden of showing that each of the four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one requirement\n28 of Rule 23(b) have been met.  Id.\n- 3 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 III. \n2 DISCUSSION\n3 Defendants argue (1) Plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief, (Federal Defendants\n4 Opposition (โFed. Opp.โ) at 3; CCA Defendants Opposition (โCCA Opp.โ) at 17); (2) the claims of\n5 โunnamed, future detaineesโ are not yet ripe, (Fed.  Opp. at 4); and (3) Plaintiffs have not m et the\n6 requirements of Rule 23.  At oral argument, the Federal Defendants argued for the first time that 8\n7 U.S.C. ยง 1252(f)(1) bars this case from proceeding as an injunctive class action and requested that the\n8 Court permit supplemental briefing on this issue.  The CCA Defendants also requested that they be\n9 allowed to further brief the issue whether the difference in immigration status between class members\n10 bars class certification.  These issues are addressed below.\n11 A. Standing\n12 Defendants claim Plaintiffs lack standing because they have not โdemonstrate[d] actual or\n13 potential harm arising out of [D]efendantsโ alleged conduct.โ  Fed. Opp. at 3.  Further, Defendants\n14 contend Plaintiffs cannot show the alleged harm โwill be repeated.โ  Id. at 3-4. \n15 In order to assert a claim on behalf of a class ,the named Plaintiffs must demonstrate they have\n16 personally sustained an injury which results from a challenged statute or government conduct.  See\n17 Armstrong v. Davis, 275 F.3d 849, 860 (9th Cir. 2001).  Cont rary to Defendantsโ contention, the\n18 named Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated at this stage of the litigation that they have standing.\n19 Kiniti and Owino declare they were repeatedly triple-celled while detained at SDCF, forced to sleep\n20 in a โboatโ on the floor of the cell, observed physical al tercations as a result of the crowded\n21 conditions, and experienced unsanitary conditions (including being โsprayed with urineโ while\n22 sleeping on a โboatโ).  Reply, Ex. I, Owino Decl.; Kiniti Decl. ISO Opp. Mt. to Dis. SAC.  Plaintiff\n23 Delgado alleged in the SAC he was triple-celled for the majority of his 27 months at SDCF and slept\n24 on a โboatโ for more than six months.  SAC at ยถ 18.  As ar eview of the substantive merits of the case\n25 at this stage in the litigation is inappropriate, the Court will not evaluate the veracity of the claimed\n26 injuries at this time.  See Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 901 n. 17 (9th Cir. 1975).  The detailed\n27 allegations of the SAC and supporting declarations aer sufficient to establish that the named Plaintiffs\n28 (a) have sustained injuries as result of the alleged violations, and (b) have a personal stake in the\n- 4 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 action.\n2 In support of their argument that Plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief, Defendants\n3 cite City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983).  In that case, Lyons was stopped at 2 a.m. by\n4 Los Angeles police officers based on a burnt out taillight.  He wass ubsequently choked by the police,\n5 causing him to lose consciousness and suffer perm anent damage to his larynx.  Lyons sought an\n6 injunction barring the Los Angeles Police Department from using chokeholds except in certain limited\n7 circumstances.  The Court held that in the absence of a realistic threat of future injury, Lyons could\n8 not โdemonstrate a case or controversy with the City that would justify the injunctive relief sought.โ\n9 Id. at 105. \n10 The Ninth Circuit, however, has distinguishedL yons from cases in which, as here, the plaintiff\n11 โdid nothing illegal to promptโ the defendantโs conduct.   Hodgers-Durgin, 199 F.3d at 1041.  In\n12 Hodgers-Durkin, the court affirmed the district courtโs finding that the plaintiffs had standing to seek\n13 injunctive relief.  The plaintiffs, motorists who had been stopped by Border Patrol agents, alleged the\n14 defendant engaged in a practice of routinely stopping motorists without reasonable suspicion.  In\n15 affirming the district court, the Ninth Circuit distinguished Lyons, noting that the Lyons Court itself\n16 โsuggested that the s top was prompted by Lyonsโ misconduct, holding that Lyons had failed to\n17 โdemonstrate a case or controversyโ because he had not established a โreal and immediate threat that\n18 he would again be stopped  for a traffic violation, or for any other offense .โโ  Id.  (emphasis in\n19 original.)  The court further observed that inS pencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1 (1998), the Supreme Court\n20 characterized the denial of standing in Lyons โas having been based on the plaintiffโs ability to avoid\n21 engaging in illegal conduct.โ  Hodgers-Durgin, 199 F.3d at 1041.  Applying the Suprem e Courtโs\n22 interpretation of Lyons, the Ninth Circuit concluded the motorists had standing to challenge the Border\n23 Patrolโs practice.  The court explained: โUnlike in  Lyons, in this case it is uncontested that both\n24 plaintiffs engaged in entirely innocent conduct,โ and, further, that โin this case there is no string of\n25 contingencies necessary to produce an injury.โ  Id. at 1041-2.  \n26 Similarly, Plaintiffs here have no control overw  hen or whether Defendants will resume triple-\n27 celling.  Rather, the allegations in the SAC, coupled with the evidence presented thus far, indicate\n28 Defendants โhave repeatedly engaged in the injurious acts in the pastn, da there is sufficient possibility\n- 5 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 that they will engage in them  in the near f uture to satisfy the realistic repetition requirem ent.โ\n2 Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 861.  The SAC alleges, and Defendants do not dispute, that  Defendants\n3 engaged in triple-celling for several years.  SAC ยถ 2.  Moreover, Defendants continue to assert now\n4 as in past  motions that triple-celling is not unconstitutional.  Fed. Opp. at 9; CCA Mot. to Dis. at 5,\n5 n.1; Def. Opp. to Mt. Leave to Amend. at 30.  In their motions to dismiss, Defendants acknowledge\n6 that they continue to engage in som e of the alleged conduct, including housing detainees in the\n7 common day room, albeit sporadically.  Perry Decl. ISO Mt. to Dis. at ยถ 22.  Further, even though\n8 triple-celling no longer takes place at SDCF, Defe ndants have failed to assure this Court that the\n9 practice will not resume in the future.  June 21, 2007 Order at 6.  Given Defendantsโ position that\n10 triple-celling is not unconstitutional (an issue that willb e addressed on the merits at a later time in this\n11 litigation), as well as the adm itted history of triple-celling, the Cour t concludes Plaintiffs have\n12 standing to seek injunctive relief.\n13 B. Ripeness\n14 Defendants argue the claims of โunnamed, future detaineesโ are unripe.  Fed. Opp. at 4.  The\n15 argument misapprehends the ripeness doctrine, which prohibits courts from deciding theoretical or\n16 abstract disagreements.  Meese, 871 F.2d at 883.  The dispute at issue -- concerning conditions of\n17 confinement and detaineesโ due process rights -- is real and concrete rather than speculative and\n18 hypothetical.  As discussed, Defendants acknowledge they have triple-celled detainees in the past and\n19 dispute such conduct is unconstitutional.  The case is therefore ripe for review.\n20 The inclusion of unnamed, future detainees who will be afefcted in the future by the challenged\n21 policy is a common characteristic of class actions.  See, e.g. I.N.S. v. Natโl Ctr. for Immigrant Rights,\n22 502 U.S. 183 (1991) (addressing merits of class action representing โall those persons who have been\n23 or may in the future be denied the right to work pursuant to 8 CFR ยง 103.6); Does 1-5 v. Chandler,\n24 83 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir. 1996) (addressing merits of class consisting of โ[a]ll persons who are, have\n25 been, or will be identified as โdisabledโ under Chapter 346 ...โ); LaDuke v. Nelson, 762 F.2d 1318,\n26 1321 (9th Cir. 1985) (affirming certification of class consisting of โ[a]ll persons who have resided or\n27 will reside in particularly described farm housing ...โ).  To interpret ripeness as Defendants suggest\n28 would โpreclude claims for injunctive relief on behalf of any โconstantly changingโ class, in which\n- 6 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 new plaintiffs enter the cl ass by virtue of the passage of tim e.โ Santillan v. Ashcroft, 2004 WL\n2 2297990, *7 (N.D. Cal. 2004) (citing Sze v. INS, 153 F.3d 1005, 1010 (9th Cir. 1998)).    \n3 C. Certification\n4 Defendants argue certification is unnecessary and, even if necessary, im proper because\n5 Plaintiffs have not satisfied the commonality, typicality or adequacy of representation requirements\n6 of Rule 23(a).  \n7 1. Necessity\n8 Defendants argue certification is unnecessary because the requested relief would apply to all\n9 detainees.  CCA Opp. at 9.  CCA calims โ[n]o useful purpose would be served by permitting this case\n10 to proceed as a class action,โ because the โdetermination of the constitutional question can be madeโ\n11 without the need to certify the class.  Id. at 10 (citation omitted).\n12 The Court disagrees.  Defendants acknowledge that the SDCF population fluctuates on a daily\n13 basis and that Plaintiffs, named and unnamed, all risk being deported or transferred to other facilities\n14 at any time.  In particular, two of the named plaintiffs are no longer before the Court as they have been\n15 deported.  Given these facts, class certification is necessary because a named plaintiffโs claim could\n16 be rendered moot (through deportation) before his claim is resolved.  See Pederson v. Louisiana State\n17 Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 867 (5th Cir. 2000) (the substantial rsik of mootness creates a necessity for class\n18 certification).\n19 2. Rule 23(a)\n20 (a) Numerosity\n21 Rule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be โso num erous that joinder of all m embers is\n22 impracticable.โ  Fed.R.Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  The Courft inds this element is met: the SAC proposes a class\n23 of over 1000 detainees, including future detainees.   Joinder of all these individuals is clearly\n24 impracticable, and Defendants do not suggest otherwise.  \n25 (b) Commonality\n26 Rule 23(a)(2) requires that โthere are questions of law or fact com mon to the class.โ\n27 Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2).  โCommonality focuses on the relationship of common facts and legal issues\n28 among class members.โ  Dukes, 474 F.3d at 1225.  This rule has been construed permissively.  โAll\n- 7 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 questions of fact and law need not be common to satisfy the rule.  The existence of shared legal issues\n2 with divergent factual predicates is sufficient,  as is a common core of salient facts coupled with\n3 disparate legal remedies within the class.โ   Id.  โThe commonality test is qualitative rather than\n4 quantitative โ one significant issue common to the class may be sufficient to warrant certification.โ\n5 Id.  โPlaintiffs may demonstrate commonality by showing that class members have shared legal issues\n6 by divergent facts or that they share a common core of facts but base their calims for relief on different\n7 legal theories.โ  Id.\n8 The SAC clearly presents at least โone significant issue commonโ to all class members.  It\n9 alleges that all detainees at SDCF suffer from a condition of overcrowding stemming from, among\n10 other things, Defendantsโ policy of triple-celling  detainees.  SAC, ยถ 54.  Pla intiffs contend these\n11 practices โdeprive [them] of adequate shelter, reasonable safety, and basic human needs, and place\n12 them at unreasonable, continuing and foreseeable riks of, inter alia, increased violence, illness, mental\n13 suffering, and deteriorating health.โ  Id. at ยถ 111.  Factually, the allegations require this Court to\n14 determine whether and to what extent practices such as triple-celling took place at SDCF.  In addition,\n15 the allegations beg the question of how such practices impact the detainee population and whether\n16 they violate the detaineesโ due process rights.  These factual questions are common to all detainees,\n17 and satisfy Rule 23's commonality requirement.  \n18 The federal defendants argue the commonality element is not met because โthere is no casual\n19 link between the alleged harms and the defendantsโ actions,โ and the SAC โfails to show how any of\n20 the alleged harms suffered by the named plaintiffs and the proposed class are specifically caused by\n21 defendantsโ actions.โ Fed. Opp. at 7- 8.  Defendants further contend an examination of Plaintiffsโ\n22 medical records โillustrates a myriad of injuries, ailm ents or illnesses am ong the plaintiffsโ are\n23 โunrelated to any one source of conduct.โ   Id. at 8-9.  But the se contentions misapprehend class\n24 certification jurisprudence.  \n25 In evaluating a motion for class certification, โ[t]he court is bound to take the substantive\n26 allegations of the complaint as true.โ Blackie, 524 F.2d at 901 n. 17; see also Thomas v. Baca, 231\n27 F.R.D. 397, 399 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (citations omitted).  The question is not whether the plaintiffs have\n28 stated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits, but rather whether the requirements of Rule 23\n- 8 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 are met.  Id. (citations omitted).  Assuming as the Court must that the allegations in the SAC are true,\n2 it is clear Plaintiffs have alleged common questions of law and fact. Whether the harms alleged are\n3 caused by the practices in question goes to the merits of Plaintiffsโ claims.  \n4 (c) Typicality\n5 โAlthough the commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) tend to merge, each\n6 factor serves discrete purpose.  Com monality examines the relationship of facts and legal issues\n7 common to class members, while typicality focuses on the relationship of facts and issues between\n8 the class and its representatives.โ  Dukes, 474 F.3d at 1231.  Rule 23(a)(3) requires that โthe claims\n9 or defenses of t he representative parties are typi cal of the claim s or defenses of the class.โ\n10 Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3).  Under the ruleโs permissive standard, โrepresentative claims are โtypicalโ if\n11 they are reasonably coextensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially\n12 identical.โ  Dukes, 474 F.3d at 1232.  โSome degree of individuality is to be expected in all cases, but\n13 that specificity does not necessarily defeat typicality.โ  Id.\n14 Plaintiffs argue โthe serious harm suffered by the putative named plaintiffs as a result of the\n15 chronic and severe overcrowding at SDCF is typical of the type of harm experienced by other class\n16 members.โ  Mt. for Cert. at 6.  The Court agrees. T  he SAC alleges all named plaintiffs have been or\n17 are currently housed at SDCF.  All have experiencedso me if not all of thea llegedly wrongful policies.\n18 Plaintiff Kiniti was triple-celled when he sought court permission to amend his complaint.  Owino,\n19 who arrived at SDCF on November 8, 2005, alleges he was triple-celled for most of his detention at\n20 SDCF.  SAC, at ยถ 16.  Delgado (who was recently transferred to another facility) alleges the same.\n21 Id. at ยถ 18.  Like the named plaintiffs, the SAC alleges all putative class members were subjected to\n22 similar treatment and thus, experienced similar harm.  Id. at ยถยถ 80-82.\n23 Defendants nonetheless argue this element has not been met because โ[d]espite their broad\n24 nature, plaintiffsโ allegations fail to identify even one specific injury that is inextricably tied to the\n25 alleged overcrowding or triple-celling at SDCF.โ   Fed. Opp. at 12.  Defendants contend the SAC\n26 โdetails isolated incidentsโ unrelated to the cl aims of misconduct, and โplaintiffs fail to link the\n27 alleged injuries suffered by the named plaintiffs to any ICE policy or practice that was applied to the\n28 proffered class as a whole.โ  Id. at 12-13.  As already discussed, these arguments concern the merits\n- 9 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 of Plaintiffsโ claim: whether the alleged conduct caused the alleged injuries and, if so, whether the\n2 conduct violates the detaineesโ constitutional rights.  Such issues are not appropriately addressed at\n3 this stage of the proceeding.  Moreover, the argument does not address the typicality requirement.  \n4 (d) Adequate Representation\n5 Rule 23(a)(4) permits certification of a class action only if  โthe representative parties will\n6 fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.โ  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4).  โThis factor requires:\n7 (1) the proposed representative Plaintiffs do not havec onflicts of interest with the proposed class; and\n8 (2) Plaintiffs are represented by qualified and competent counsel.โ  Dukes, 474 F.3d at 1233.  \n9 Plaintiffs are represented by able counsel, and there is no conflict between the putative naemd\n10 Plaintiffsโ interest and that of  the remaining class members.  The CCA Defendants contend this\n11 element has not been met because โ[P]laintiffs have credibility problem, unique background issues\n12 that are not representative of the typical immigrant detainees, and likely have individual concerns that\n13 are not shared by the rest of the class.โ  CCA Opp. at 14.  The differences pointed out by CCA are not\n14 relevant to determining whether the named Plaintiffs will adequately protect the interests o fthe class.\n15 These differences or โindividual concernsโ do not giver ise to a conflict of interest between the named\n16 Plaintiffs and the class. \n17 3. Rule 23(b)\n18 Certification is appropriate pursuant to Rule2 3(b)(2) where โthe party opposing the class has\n19 acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final\n20 injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief withr espect to the class as a whole.โ  Mt. for Cert.\n21 at 9 (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2)).  The elements of subdivision 23(b)(2) are met.  \n22 Plaintiffs allege Defendants engaged in conduct that is โgene rally applicable to the class.โ\n23 According to Plaintiffs, Defendantsโs policy of triple-celling Plaintiffs, among other things, created\n24 a chronic condition of overcrowding that deprived all detainees housed at SDCF personal security,\n25 health care, and safety.  SAC at ยถ ยถ 41, 42.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief to enjoin\n26 these practices.  In light of these allegations and the relief sought, the requireemnts of 23(b)(2) clearly\n27 are satisfied.  \n28 D. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(f) and Differences In Plaintiffsโ Immigration Status\n- 10 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 In their supplemental papers, Defendants argue (1) 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252( f) bars this case from\n2 proceeding as an injunctive class  action, and (2) di fferences in the im migration status of class\n3 members preclude certification.  Both arguments are unavailing for the reasons discussed below.\n4 1. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(f)\n5 Defendants contend โthe plain language of ยง 1252(f)(1) divests this Court of subject matter\n6 jurisdiction over [P]laintiffsโ motion for certificationโ because that section limits the authority to\n7 enjoin operation of certain detention statutes on a  class wide basis to the Supreme Court.  Section\n8 1252(f)(1) provides: \n9 Regardless of the nature of the action  or claim or identity of the ... parties\nbringing  the action, no court ( other  than  the Suprem e  Court) shall have\n10 jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of\npart IV of this sub-chapter [8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1221-1231], other than with respect to\n11 the  application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom\nproceedings under such part have been initiated.\n12\n13 In other words, according to D efendants, section 1252(f)(1) permits this Court to enjoin the\n14 โoperationโ of certain detention statutes on an individual basis but not on a class wide basis.   \n15 Neither  the plain l anguage  of section  1252(f)(1)  nor case law supports Defendantsโ\n16 construction of the statute.  Rather, under section 1252(f)(1), class wide injunctions are prohibited\n17 only if they suspend or restrain the operation of certain provisions of immigration law.  See Tefel v.\n18 Reno,  972 F.Supp. 608, 618 (S.D. Fla. 1997)  vacated on other grounds, 180 F.3d 1286 (11th Cir.\n19 1999) (finding ยง 1252(f)(1) did not bar injunctive relief for a class because plaintiffs sought not to\n20 enjoin the statute but โconstitutional violationsโ and INS โpolicies and practices.โG);r imaldo v. Reno,\n21 187 F.R.D. 643, 647-48 (D.Colo. 1999) (finding ยง 1252(f)(1) inapplicable where plaintiff sought to\n22 convert complaint to a class action to โenjoin alleged constitutional violations by the INS in its\n23 administrationโ of ยง 1226, not the operation of the stautte.)  In a decision that has been withdrawn on\n24 other grounds, the Ninth Circuit held section 1252(f)(1) is inapplicable where the injunctive relief\n25 sought pertains not to โthe operation of ยง 1231(b) but violations of the statute and to โensure that the\n26 provision is properly implemented.โโ  Ali v. Ashcroft, 346 F.3d 873 886 (9th Cir. 2003) (emphasis in\n27 original). \n28 Here, Plaintiffs do not seek to suspend or restrain the operation of any immigration statutes.\n- 11 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 Nor do they challenge the Governmentโs interpretation of any such statute.  Rather, Plaintiffs claim\n2 the manner in which the Government carries out its authority under the relevant statutes violates their\n3 substantive due process rights.  Thus, Plaintiffs do not seek to suspend the Governmentโs authority\n4 to detain and remove aliens; they simply assert that the Governm ent is obligated to carry out its\n5 statutory powers in a constitutional manner. \n6 Defendants, however, contend this case โclearly fallsโ under the scope of section 1252(f)(1)\n7 because class wide injunction, if granted, would  โcurtail[] [the Agencyโs] managerial discretionโ\n8 relating to detention and removal of aliens.  Fed. Supp. Brief at 5.  In particular, Defendants argue the\n9 injunction would impact the Agencyโs decisions regarding where to house detainees and the manner\n10 in which they are detained.  Defendantsโ inte rpretation of section 1252(f)(1) is overly broad, not\n11 supported by case law and the text of the statute, and effectively would preclude a court from issuing\n12 injunctive  relief  in any m atter  that tangentially  related  to detention of a liens.   Accordingly,\n13 Defendantsโ interpretation of the statute is rej ected.  This case f alls outside the jurisdictional\n14 restrictions of section 1252(f)(1).   \n15 2. Differences In Detaineesโ Immigration Status\n16 Defendants argue the difference in immigration status of class members bars certification.  The\n17 proposed class โ present and future detainees housed at SDCF โ include two categories of detainees:\n18 detainees who (1) already have entered the United States, and (2) are detained either before entry in\n19 the United States or inside the United States but within 100 air miles of the border.  The latter group\n20 of aliens is referred to as โexpedited removalsโ or โexcludable aliens,โ as they are deemed not to have\n21 effected entry into the country even htough they are physically detained here.S  ee Barrera-Echavarria\n22 v. Rison, 44 F.3d 1441, 1450 (9th Cir 1995) (โentry fictionโ provides that โ[a]lthough aliens seeking\n23 admission into the United States may physically be allowed within its borders pending a determination\n24 of admissibility, such aliens are legally considered to be detained at the border and hence as never\n25 having effected entry into this countryโ)( internal quotations and citations omitted), overruled on other\n26 grounds, Xi v. I.N.S., 298 F.3d 832 (9th Cir. 2002).  \n27 The named Plaintiffs are all non-excludable aliens, whereas the proposed class contains both\n28 excludable and non-excludable aliens.  Defendants argue the two groups have different substantive\n- 12 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 constitutional rights, and the Court will have to appyl different legal standards in determining whether\n2 the detention practices in question  violate  each groupโs rights.  CCA Supp. Brief at 3.  This\n3 difference, according to Defendants, prevents Pl aintiffs from meeting Rule 23's r equirements of\n4 adequacy of representation, typicality, and commonality. \n5 As an initial matter, the cases Defendants rely on to support their contention have lim ited\n6 application โ holding only that excludable aliens have le ss procedural rights than other aliens.\n7 Defendants rely principally on  Lynch v. Cannatella, 810 F.2d 1363 (5th Cir. 1987) .  There, the\n8 plaintiffs were sixteen Jamaican nationals who attempted to enter the United States illegally by\n9 stowing away aboard a grain barge bound for ports  on the Mississippi River.  Plaintiffs were\n10 discovered, and, subsequently, they sued federal and state officials claiming physical abuse prior to\n11 being deported.  The language in Lynch that Defendants seize upon is the following: โ[e]xcludable\n12 aliens . . . are situated differently even from illegal aliens who have landed in this country.โ  Id. at\n13 1373.  The court in Lynch, however, strongly suggested that the distinction between excludable and\n14 non-excludable aliens relates only to the process of deportation: โThe โentry fictionโ that excludable\n15 aliens are to be treated as if detained at the bodrer despite their physical presence in the United States\n16 determines the aliensโ rights with regard to immigration and deportation proceedings.  It does not limit\n17 the right of excludable aliens detained within United States territory to humane treatment.โ  Id.  \n18 Lynch makes clear that the basis of the โentry fi ctionโ is the โoverriding concern that the\n19 United States, as a sovereign, maintain its right to self-determination.โ  Lynch, 810 F.2d at 1373.  In\n20 other words, the conclusion that excludable aliensh ave less procedural rights promotes the sovereign\n21 interest of the United States in admitting or rejecting outsiders as it sees f it.  The interest in self-\n22 determination, however, โplays virtually no roleโ in determining whether the Constitution affords\n23 excludable aliens substantive due process rights.  See Id. at 1374.  The Lynch court observed it could\n24 not โconceive of any national interestsโ that would justify depriving the plaintiffs of the right to be\n25 treated humanely merely because they are excludable aliens.   Id.  โ[W]hatever due process rights\n26 excludable aliens may be denied by virtue of th eir status, they are entitled under the due process\n27 clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to be free of gross physical abuse at the hands of state\n28 or federal officials.โ Id. \n- 13 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 Similarly, in Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952 (2003), the Nint h Circuit concluded the\n2 entry fiction is โbest seen [] as a fairly narrow doctrine that primarily determines procedures that the\n3 executive branch must follow before turning an immigrant away.โ Id. at 973.  Reasoning โthe entry\n4 fiction does not preclude substantive constitutional protection,โ  id. at 971, the court observed the\n5 doctrine appears โdeterminative of the procedural rightso f aliens with respect to their applications ofr\n6 admission,โ and has not been used to โdeny all constitutional rights to non-admitted aliens.โ  Id. at\n7 973.  \n8 Although case law suggests the entry fiction is  determinative only of procedural rights,\n9 Defendants are correct that no court has explicitly held that excludable aliens enjoy the same bundle\n10 of substantive rights as non-excludable aliens.  But this Court need not answer that question.\n11 Defendants suggest that while both groups of aliens may be entitled to humane treatment, one may\n12 be entitled to better treatment than the other.  In other words, Def endants essentially contend the\n13 Government, consistent with Fifth Amendment due process rights, conceivably may be permitted to\n14 triple-cell one group but not the other group.  Thisi s because excludable aliens are only entitled to be\n15 free from โgross physical abuseโ that results in โserious physical harm,โ  CCA Supp. Brief at 4, while\n16 non-excludable aliens are entitled โto the โminimum civilized measure of lifeโs necessity.โโ  Id.  But\n17 the cases Defendants rely on neither support the claim that the former standard applies to excludable\n18 aliens while the latter applies to non-excludable aliens, nor that one standard is more stringent than\n19 the other.  \n20 Moreover, even assuming the right to humane treatment is governed by different standards,\n21 Defendants have not explained in what way any such differences should bar class certifi cation.\n22 Defendants suggest the named Plaintiffs, all non-excludable aliens, may not adequately represent those\n23 who are excludable.  The Court disagrees.  Differences in the legal standards to be applied, if any, do\n24 not suggest any conflict of interes tbetween the named Plaintiffs and unnamed class members.  Rather,\n25 if the named Plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction, the unnam ed excludable plaintiffs also will\n26 benefit.1  Theoretically, under Defendantsโ construct, it i sonly problematic if the named Plaintiffs are\n27 excludable aliens, and therefore they would not be ab le to adequately represent the unnamed non-\n28\n1  Defendants after all have argued that c ertification is unnecessary because the requested\nrelief, if granted, would apply to all detainees.  See CCA Opp. at 9.  \n- 14 -\n05cv1013\n\n1 excludable class members, who may be entitled to more rights or better treatment.  The purported\n2 differences between excludable and non-excludable aliens do not negate any of the requirements of\n3 Rule 23.  \n4 IV. \n5 CONCLUSION\n6 For these reasons, Plaintiffsโ motion for class certification is GRANTED.  \n7 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n8 DATED: August 17, 2007, \n9\n10 HON.

In his original Complaint, as in his First Amended Complaint, Mr. Kiniti alleges\n25 violations of his constitutional rights stemming from, inter alia, the severe and chronic\n26 overcrowding of immigration detainees at San Diego Correctional Facility (SDCF).  On January\n27 24, 2007, plaintiff Kiniti, by and through his attorneys, filed under separate cover a Motion for\n28 Leave to Amend the First Amended Complaint and Add Parties.  Plaintiffโs Proposed Second\n1\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 36     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 2 of 11(cid:10)\n1 Amended Complaint, attached to the aforementioned motion for leave to amend, contains class\n2 action allegations on behalf of the class of โall immigration detainees in ICE custody who are\n3 now or in the future will be confined at San Diego Correctional Facilityโ (hereinafter the โSDCF\n4 Classโ), and seeks only injunctive and declaratory relief.\n5 In the Proposed Second Amended Complaint, the putative class alleges that more than\n6 two-thirds of the detainees at SDCF are currently affected by the practice of triple-celling (i.e.,\n7 housing three detainees in a small cell designed for two), that still more detainees are housed in\n8 makeshift beds in the common dayroom space, and that all detainees are at risk of future harm\n9 from this chronic and severe overcrowding.  Putative representative plaintiffs further allege that\n10 the long-standing and pervasive overcrowding at SDCF:\n11 is the root cause of numerous unsafe and intolerable conditions that\nafflict detainees at the facility, including: increased violence, tension,\n12 discomfort,  stress,  mental  suffering,  psychiatric  problems,  and\nexposure to respiratory and other infections; diminished access to\n13 medical, mental health and dental services; diminished access to\nexercise  and  dayroom  space  and  other  facility  services;  poor\n14 sanitation  and  decreased  ability  to  maintain  personal  hygiene;\noverburdened and unsanitary shower and toilet facilities, resulting in\n15 more frequent plumbing malfunctions and exposure to urine and\nfeces; and the loss of personal dignity due to all of the above.\n16\nProposed Second Amended Complaint, ยถ 3.\n17\nIn connection with the class action allegations contained in the Proposed Second\n18\nAmended Complaint, which is to be filed with the Court and served on all defendants should the\n19\nCourt grant plaintiffโs motion for leave to amend, plaintiff hereby moves for certification of the\n20\nSDCF Class and an order appointing the undersigned counsel to represent the certified class,\n21\npursuant to Rule 23(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n22\nFor the reasons set forth below, plaintiffโs Motion for Class Certification Under the\n23\n[Proposed] Second Amended Complaint should be granted, and an order should be issued\n24\nappointing the undersigned as class counsel.\n25\nI. This Case is Properly Maintained as a Class Action.\n26\nA.  Background Principles Applicable to Class Certification\n27\nIn order for a class to be certified, the following requirements must be satisfied: \n28\n(1)  the  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is\n2 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 36     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 3 of 11(cid:10)\n1 impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the\nclass, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\n2 typical  of  the  claims  or  defenses  of  the  class,  and  (4)  the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests\n3 of the class.\n4 Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  In addition, the class must meet the requirements of one of the three\n5 subsections set forth in Rule 23(b).  Here, plaintiff Kiniti and putative named plaintiffs Jose\n6 Morales-Vargas, Sylvester Owino, Hernan Ismael Delgado and Any Castro seek certification\n7 pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).\n8 Initial determination of class certification is solely a procedural issue that must not be\n9 based on the merits of the case; plaintiffโs burden is limited to demonstrating that the proposed\n10 class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23.  Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178\n11 (1974).  In ruling on the motion for class certification, the Court must take the substantive\n12 allegations of the Proposed Second Amended Complaint as true.  Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d\n13 891, 901 n.17 (9th Cir. 1975).\n14 B.  The Rule 23(a) Prerequisites to Class Certification Have Been Satisfied.\n15 1.  Numerosity and Impracticality of Joinder\n16 The first prerequisite of Rule 23(a) is that โthe class [be] so numerous that joinder of all\n17 members is impracticable.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  While there is no ironclad rule as to when\n18 the size of the proposed class renders joinder impracticable, sheer numerosity is generally\n19 sufficient.  Jordan v. County of Los Angeles, 669 F.2d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. 1982), vacated on\n20 other grounds, 459 U.S. 810 (1982), on remand, 713 F.2d 504 (9th Cir. 1983); 5 Mooreโs\n21 Federal Practice, ยง23.22[3][a] (Matthew Bender, 3d ed.) (hereinafter โMooreโs Federal\n22 Practiceโ) (noting that classes comprising more than 40 individuals are generally found to satisfy\n23 the impracticality of joinder requirement).  Where, as in this case, the proposed class exceeds\n24 1000 immigration detainees, joinder is clearly impracticable.\n25 Joinder of all class members is further complicated by the nature of immigration\n26 detention, which is often quite fluid.  The size and make-up of the proposed classโwhich\n27 includes immigration detainees who are not now, but will in the future be, detained at\n28 SDCFโchange daily, as additional detainees are brought to SDCF to be held in the custody of\n3 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 36     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 4 of 11(cid:10)\n1 the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, while other class\n2 members are released from detention, removed from the country, or transferred to other detention\n3 facilities.  The rotating membership of the proposed class is an additional basis for finding\n4 joinder impracticable.  See Andre H. v. Ambach, 104 F.R.D. 606, 611 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (โThe fact\n5 that the [detention center] population . . . is constantly revolving establishes sufficient numerosity\n6 to make joinder of the class members impracticable.โ).  The inclusion in the class of future\n7 detainees, whose identities cannot possibly be ascertained at this time, provides still further basis\n8 for concluding that joinder is impracticable.  See, e.g., Jones v. Diamond, 519 F.2d 1090, 1100\n9 (5th Cir. 1975); Skinner v. Uphoff, 209 F.R.D. 484, 488 (D. Wyo. 2002) (finding certification\n10 appropriate for class of current and future prisoners seeking injunctive relief; โ[a]s members in\n11 futuro, they are necessarily unidentifiable, and therefore joinder is clearly impracticableโ);\n12 Mooreโs Federal Practice, ยง23.22[7].\n13 Finally, courts typically find joinder to be impracticable if it is reasonable to conclude that\n14 the class members would be unable to file individual actions to vindicate their rights.  See, e.g.,\n15 Leyva v. Buley, 125 F.R.D. 512, 515 (E.D. Wash. 1989) (certifying class of migrant workers and\n16 citing class membersโ lack of sophistication, limited knowledge of the legal system, limited or\n17 non-existent English skills, and fear of retaliation).  Such is the case with the purported class\n18 members, who have even less access to the legal system than pre-trial criminal detainees;\n19 immigration detainees appearing in Immigration Court and before the Board of Immigration\n20 Appeals have only a statutory โprivilege of being represented (at no expense to the\n21 Government).โ  8 U.S.C. ยง 1362.\n22 2.  Commonality\n23 The second prerequisite of Rule 23(a) is that there be a single question of law or fact\n24 common to members of the class.  Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 904 (9th Cir. 1975) (โall\n25 that is required is a single issue of law or factโ); see also Marisol A. v. Giuliani, 126 F.3d 372,\n26 376 (2d Cir. 1997).  The Proposed Second Amended Complaint in this action identifies multiple\n27 questions of both law and fact common to the entire class.\n28 These common questions include, but are not limited to: whether defendants have failed\n4 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 36     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 5 of 11(cid:10)\n1 to provide adequate shelter, reasonable safety, and basic human needs to plaintiffs as a result of\n2 overcrowding at SDCF; whether plaintiffsโ conditions of confinement subject them to\n3 unreasonable risk of violence, injury, illness and mental suffering; whether plaintiffsโ conditions\n4 of confinement are effectively punitive; whether defendantsโ conduct violates the Fifth\n5 Amendment; and whether defendantsโ conduct shows a pattern of officially sanctioned behavior\n6 that violates plaintiffsโ rights and establishes a credible threat of future injury.\n7 The commonality prerequisite is therefore satisfied.1\n8 3.  Typicality\n9 The third prerequisite of Rule 23(a) is that the putative named plaintiffsโ claims be typical\n10 of those of the class.  The purpose of this requirement is to assure that the interests of the named\n11 plaintiffs align with the interests of the class.  Weinberger v. Thornton, 114 F.R.D. 599, 603\n12 (S.D. Cal. 1986).  This prerequisite is viewed under the ruleโs โpermissive standards,โ such that\n13 โrepresentative claims are โtypicalโ if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class\n14 members; they need not be substantially identical.โ  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011,\n15 1019 (9th Cir. 1998).  See also Penn v. San Juan Hospital, Inc., 528 F.2d 1181, 1189 (10th Cir.\n16 1975) (โthe typicality requirement is ordinarily not argued.โ).\n17 The typicality requirement is satisfied โ[i]f the class representativeโs claims arise from the\n18 same events, practice, or conduct, and are based on the same legal theory as those of other class\n19 members.โ  Mooreโs Federal Practice, ยง23.24[2].  The fundamental inquiry for typicality is\n20 whether all members of the class would benefit in some way from a judgment favorable to the\n21\n22\n1 Of course, factual differences may exist among class members with respect to the\nprecise way in which each individual is affected by the institutional practice or\n23\ncondition.  Such differences do not defeat commonality.  See, e.g., Marisol A, 126 F.3d\n24 at 377 (โthe unique circumstances of each [plaintiff] do not compromise the common\nquestion of whether . . . defendants have injured all class members by failing to meet\n25\ntheir federal and state law obligationsโ); Milonas v. Williams, 691 F.2d 931, 938 (10th\nCir. 1982) (โ[f]actual differences in the claims of class members should not result in a\n26\ndenial of class certification where common questions of law existโ); see also Bradley v.\n27 Harrelson, 151 F.R.D. 422, 426 (M.D. Ala. 1993) (concluding that factual differences\nbetween class members as to the nature and severity of their mental illness do not\n28\npreclude finding of commonality in a class action challenging the delivery of mental\nhealth services to Alabama prisoners).\n5 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 36     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 6 of 11(cid:10)\n1 plaintiffs.  See Ellis v. Naval Air Rework Facility, 404 F. Supp. 391, 396 (N.D. Cal. 1975).  \n2 The putative named plaintiffs are immigration detainees at SDCF who have personally\n3 experienced the consequences of the defendantsโ policies, practices, acts and omissions\n4 pertaining to the chronic and severe overcrowding of SDCF.  With the exception of plaintiff\n5 Isaac Kigondu Kiniti, each of the other putative named plaintiffs is currently triple-celled. \n6 Plaintiff Jose Morales-Vargas has been housed at SDCF since June 16, 2006, and has been\n7 continuously triple-celled with the exception of a brief 11-day period when he was housed in\n8 segregation.  Proposed Second Amended Complaint, ยถ 14.  Plaintiff Sylvester Owino arrived at\n9 SDCF on November 8, 2005.  Id. at ยถ 15.  He has been triple-celled for most of his detention at\n10 SDCF and without interruption since June 11, 2006.  Id. at ยถ 16.  Plaintiff Hernan Ismael\n11 Delgado is also currently triple-celled.  Id. at ยถ 18.  Delgado has been in ICE detention since\n12 February 2003, and has been housed at SDCF since October 8, 2004.  Id.  Delgado has been\n13 triple-celled for the majority of his time at SDCF, and was forced to sleep on the floor in a plastic\n14 โboatโ containing a thin sleeping mat for the first six months of his detention at SDCF.  Id. \n15 Plaintiff Any Castro has been detained at SDCF since September 2006, and has been triple-celled\n16 for the entirety of her stay in detention.  Id. at ยถ 20.  Like plaintiff Delgado, plaintiff Castro was\n17 forced to sleep on the floor of her cell in a โboatโ for the first two months of her time at SDCF. \n18 Id.  Although plaintiff Kiniti is not now triple-celled, Kiniti has been triple-celled at various\n19 points during his stay in SDCF and remains at constant risk of once again being triple-celled, or\n20 suffering the consequences of his refusal to be triple-celled.  Id. at ยถ 12.  In early 2005, Kiniti\n21 complained to auditors from the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General\n22 (OIG) about the problem of overcrowding and triple-celling at SDCF, and personally met with a\n23 senior auditor for the OIG during her visit to the facility.  Id.  Kiniti subsequently filed the instant\n24 lawsuit arguing, inter alia, that triple-celling and overcrowding at SDCF are unconstitutional.\n25 The serious harm suffered by the putative named plaintiffs as a result of the chronic and\n26 severe overcrowding at SDCF is typical of the type of harm experienced by other class members. \n27 This harm includes not only the concrete harm of being triple-celledโa harm that is itself\n28 experienced by two-thirds of the immigration detainees now held at SDCFโbut also all of the\n6 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 36     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 7 of 11(cid:10)\n1 other dangers and indignities that accompany this overcrowding.  Pervasive overcrowding at\n2 SDCF increases the tension between detainees at the facility, who are forced to spend significant\n3 periods of time confined in cells that are designed to house two, not three, people.  Plaintiff\n4 Morales-Vargas has had to defend himself in at least five incidents of detainee-on-detainee\n5 violence that went unnoticed or ignored by security staff, and plaintiff Owino has witnessed\n6 numerous fights among detainees that have transpired without the intervention of security staff. \n7 Id. at ยถ 72.  When plaintiff Castro was first brought to SDCF, she spent two months sleeping on\n8 the floor of her cell in a โboat.โ  Id. at ยถ 20.\n9 All detainees are also at heightened risk of illness as a result of the severe and chronic\n10 overcrowding at SDCF.  Id. at ยถยถ 80-82.  Detainees living in severely overcrowded conditions are\n11 at greater risk for both methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug\n12 resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB).  MRSA is a highly contagious bacteria known to spread rapidly\n13 in institutional settings where poor sanitation and close confinement create a greater likelihood of\n14 transmission.  MDRTB is a potentially fatal air-borne disease that can spread in overcrowded\n15 conditions with poor air circulation.\n16 Plaintiffโs counsel have interviewed and corresponded with numerous putative class\n17 members who are suffering the same constitutional injury as the putative named plaintiffs\n18 because of the overcrowding of SDCF.  Counsel have also interviewed and corresponded with\n19 individuals who are not now detained at SDCF, but were detained at that facility within the past\n20 several months, who similarly experienced constitutional deprivations as a result of the\n21 overcrowding.  Some of the allegations contained in the Proposed Second Amended Complaint\n22 pertain to the experiences of individuals who, though they are not putative representative\n23 plaintiffs, are members of the putative SDCF Class.  See, e.g., id. at  ยถยถ 77, 83, 84.  The claims of\n24 the putative named plaintiffs are typical of those of the class; they are โpart of the class and\n25 possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.โ  East Texas Motor\n26 Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 431 U.S. 395, 403 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n27\n28\n7 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 36     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 8 of 11(cid:10)\n1 4.  Adequacy of Representation\n2 The fourth prerequisite of Rule 23(a) is that โthe representative parties will fairly and\n3 adequately protect the interests of the class.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  Adequacy of\n4 representation is a two-part test: (i) counsel for the representative parties are qualified and able to\n5 prosecute the action vigorously; and (ii) there is no conflict or antagonism between the named\n6 plaintiffsโ interests and the remainder of the class.  Lerwill v. Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc., 582\n7 F.2d 507, 522 (9th Cir. 1978).\n8 Plaintiff class members are represented by the National Prison Project of the American\n9 Civil Liberties Union Foundation (NPP), the Immigrantsโ Rights Project of the American Civil\n10 Liberties Union Foundation (IRP), the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of San Diego\n11 & Imperial Counties (ACLU of San Diego), and the law firm of Cooley Godward Kronish LLP\n12 (CGK).  NPP has extensive experience litigating class actions regarding conditions inside prisons\n13 and jails, and IRP has unique expertise pertaining to the detention of individuals by ICE.  The\n14 ACLU of San Diego, through its legal director, and CGK each has significant experience in civil\n15 rights and immigrantsโ rights litigation.  Counsel are therefore experienced in class action, civil\n16 rights, immigrantsโ rights, and conditions of confinement litigation.\n17 There is also no conflict between the putative named plaintiffsโ interests and the\n18 remainder of the class.  The putative named plaintiffs have no interests separate from those of a\n19 putative SDCF Class, and seek no relief other than the classwide injunctive and declaratory relief\n20 sought on behalf of the class.2\n21\n22\n23\n2 In addition to seeking injunctive relief in his Complaint and First Amended Complaint,\n24 plaintiff Kiniti also sought damages for the injury he personally suffered as a result of\nDefendantsโ unconstitutional actions.  In the Proposed Second Amended Complaint, Mr.\n25\nKiniti has withdrawn his request for damages and instead is pursuing only injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief as a representative of the putative class.  However, even if Mr. Kiniti\n26\nwere to continue to seek damages in this action, that would not create a conflict of\n27 interest preventing class certification.  See, e.g., Probe v. State Teachersโ Retirement\nSystem, 780 F.2d 776, 780-81 (9th Cir. 1986).  Here, as in Probe, any request for money\n28\ndamages by Mr. Kiniti would be merely incidental to the primary claims common to all\nnamed plaintiffs and the class as a whole regarding injunctive relief.\n8 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 36     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 9 of 11(cid:10)\n1 C.  Class Certification is Appropriate Pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).\n2 The final requirement for class certification is satisfaction of at least one of the\n3 subsections of Rule 23(b).  Certification is appropriate pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) where:\n4 the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final\n5 injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to\nthe class as a whole.\n6\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  Courts have repeatedly held that civil rights class actions are the\n7\nparadigmatic 23(b)(2) suits, โfor they seek classwide structural relief that would clearly redound\n8\nequally to the benefit of each class member.โ  Marcera v. Chinlund, 595 F.2d 1231, 1240 (2d\n9\nCir. 1979), vacated on other grounds sub nom., Lombard v. Marcera, 442 U.S. 915 (1979); see\n10\nalso Johnson v. General Motors Corp., 598 F.2d 432, 435 (5th Cir. 1979); Elliott v. Weinberger,\n11\n564 F.2d 1219, 1229 (9th Cir. 1977) (action to enjoin allegedly unconstitutional government\n12\nconduct is โthe classic type of action envisioned by the drafters of Rule 23 to be brought under\n13\nsubdivision (b)(2)โ), affโd in pertinent part sub nom., Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 701\n14\n(1979)).  As stated in the leading treatise on class actions:\n15\nRule 23(b)(2) was drafted specifically to facilitate relief in civil rights\n16 suits.  Most class actions in the constitutional and civil rights areas\nseek primarily declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the class\n17 and therefore readily satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) class action criteria.\n18 A. Conte & H. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions ยง 25.20 (4th ed. 2002).  \n19 Injunctive challenges to prison conditions routinely proceed as class actions, and are\n20 typically maintained under subdivision (b)(2).  See, e.g., JonesโEl v. Berge, 374 F.3d 541 (7th\n21 Cir. 2004); Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1245 (9th Cir. 1982) (class certified under Rule\n22 23(b)(2)); Diamond, 519 F.2d at 1097, 1099-1100 (encouraging the liberal application of Rule\n23 23, and in particular subdivision (b)(2), in civil rights actions, and observing that โ[r]ealistically,\n24 class actions are the only practicable judicial mechanism for the cleansing reformation and\n25 purification of these penal institutions.โ).\n26 In this case, the defendantsโ unconstitutional policies, practices, acts and omissions\n27 pertaining to overcrowding are imposed uniformly on all class members, and declaratory and\n28 injunctive relief will redound to the benefit of the class as a whole.  Accordingly, Rule 23(b)(2) is\n9 05cv01013\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 36     Filed 01/24/2007     Page 10 of 11(cid:10)\n1 satisfied.\n2 Conclusion\n3 For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffโs Motion for Class Certification Under the\n4 [Proposed] Second Amended Complaint should be granted, and plaintiffโs counsel should be\n5 appointed to represent the certified class, pursuant to Rule 23(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n6 Procedure.\n7\n8 Dated: January 24, 2007 Respectfully submitted,\n9\nBy: s/ David Blair-Loy\n10\nDavid Blair-Loy (SBN 229235)\n11 American Civil Liberties Union Foundation \n     of San Diego & Imperial Counties\n12 P.O.

The initial\n6 Complaint named CCA, the warden of the facility, and several SDCF officers as defendants.  The\n7 Court reviewed the Complaint on its own initiative, dismissed a number of claims without prejudice,\n8 and dismissed several named defendants.  The Court also granted Kiniti leave to file an amended\n9 complaint and instructed him to identifythosedefendantsto whomhe had complained regarding the\n10 conditions of his confinement.  On June 29, 2006, Kiniti, still pro se, filed his First Amended\n11 Complaint, and the original defendants filed an Answer on October 30, 2006.\n12       On January 24, 2007, Kiniti, now represented by the ACLU, filed a motion for leave to file his\n13 Second Amended Complaint, wherein he requested certification of a class in addition to both\n14 declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of the ICE immigration detainees housed at SDCF.  The\n15 new complaint added plaintiffs and replaced almost all of the defendants, substituting four ICE\n16 officials and the current warden and assistant warden of SDCF as the related SDCF officers, and\n17 replacingthe former warden as a named defendant.  The Second Amended Complaint also allegesfor\n18 the first time that defendants engaged in the practice of overcrowding and triple-celling immigration\n19 detainees at SDCF. Accordingto plaintiffs, this practice results in theviolation of the  immigration\n20 detaineesโ constitutional rights.  On February 27, 2007, the Court granted plaintiffsโ motion for leave\n21 to file the Second AmendedComplaint, and theSecondAmendedComplaint was deemed filed on that\n22 date.2\n23 The Court initially addressed the issue of mootness in its February 27, 2007 order, when the\n24 Court addressed defendantsโ argument that amending the First Amended Complaint was futile\n25 because, among other things, plaintiffs were no longer subject to triple-celling conditions and\n26\n27\n2  While Kinitiโs litigation has been ongoing for some time, the Federal Defendants were\n28\nnot a party to this lawsuit until February 27, 2007, when the Second Amended Complaint was\ndeemed filed.\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss\n3:05-cv-1013-DMS-PCL 2\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 75     Filed 05/04/2007     Page 3 of 10\n1 therefore lacked standing to bring suit.  See Order Granting Plaintiffโs Motion to Amend First\n2 Amended Complaint and Add Parties (โOrderโ) at 4.  The Court granted leave to file the Second\n3 Amended Complaint, noting that โDefendantsโ argument that Plaintiffsโ claims are moot assumes the\n4 injuries alleged stem solely from โtriple-celling,โ and the Court found that โ[t]his is not the case.โ\n5 Id. Asthe Courtexplained, plaintiffsโ proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges a โchronic and\n6 severe overcrowdingโthatincludes notonlytriple-celling, but allegationsthat immigration detainees\n7 were forced to sleep on makeshift beds in the common dayroom space; that detainees experienced\n8 overcrowding in holding cells; and that overflow detainees and detainees who refuse to be triple-celled\n9 are subject to oppressive confinement conditions intheadministrativesegregation unit.  Id.  The Court\n10 also noted that while defendants claimed that 104 detainees were permanently discharged or\n11 transferred from SDCF, defendants did not contend that the individual pods did not exceed their\n12 capacity.  Id. at 5.\n13 Furthermore, the Court stated, defendants did notmeet their โheavyburden of persuadingโ the\n14 Court that triple-celling cannot reasonably be expected to start up again.  Id.  Citing the case of\n15 Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Serv., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000), the Court reasoned\n16 that while a defendantโs voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court\n17 of its power to determine the legality of the practice, โ[a] case might become moot if subsequent\n18 events made it absolutelyclear that the allegedlywrongfulbehaviorcould notbe reasonably expected\n19 to occur.โ  Applying this standard, the Court held that  defendantsโ assertion that no detainees are\n20 currently triple-celled failed to establish that it was absolutely clear that the triple-celling and other\n21 conditions related to overcrowding could not be reasonably expected to recur.  Id.\n22   In contrast, this present motion to dismiss based on mootness is distinguishable from this\n23 prior argument opposing the Motion for Leave to File the Second Amended Complaint.  First,\n24 defendants address not only the triple-celling allegations, but the other allegations referenced in the\n25 Courtโs February 27, 2007 Order that relate to issuesof overcrowding.  Second, defendants meet the\n26 Friendsof the Earth standard in showingthatplaintiffsโ case is moot bymaking it โabsolutely clearโ\n27 that the challenged conduct alleged in the Second Amended Complaint could not reasonably be\n28 expected to recur.\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss\n3:05-cv-1013-DMS-PCL 3\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 75     Filed 05/04/2007     Page 4 of 10\n1 Since late January 2007 -- prior to the filing of the Second Amended Complaint -- and\n2 thereafter, the number of ICE detainees housed at SDCFper dayhas fluctuated between 595 to 692.3\n3 Declaration of TimothyL.Perry(PerryDecl.)atยถ 17. Plaintiffs, in the Second Amended Complaint,\n4 allege that SDCFโs โdesign capacityโ for ICE immigration detainees is 800.  Id. at ยถ 16; Second\n5 Amended Complaint at ยถยถ 47, 51. Thus, since late January, 2007, SDCF has been operating below\n6 capacity by plaintiffsโ standards, and is not โovercrowded.โ  Perry Decl. at ยถ 18.\n7 Furthermore, since late January 2007, there has been no triple-celling of any of the ICE\n8 immigration detainees at SDCF, nor has there been any situation akin to โsevere and chronic\n9 overcrowding.โ  Id. at ยถยถ 18, 19.  Since late January 2007, no โboatsโ have been used for ICE\n10 immigration  detainees, and no immigration pod, administrative segregation unit or holding cell has\n11 exceeded capacity.  Id. at ยถ 20, 26.  Finally, no ICE immigration detainees are forced to sleep on\n12 โmakeshift bedsโ in the common day rooms at SDCF, though as of May 1, 2007, 11 ICE immigration\n13 detainees in the facilitysleptoncommonarea bunk beds inthe dayroom. Id. at ยถยถ 22, 23.  As of May\n14 3, 2007, noimmigration detainees were assigned to bunk beds located in day rooms.  Id. at ยถ 23.  As\n15 the conditions alleged by plaintiffs do not and have not existed since one month prior to the time the\n16 plaintiffsโ Second Amended Complaint was filed, there is no live controversy for the court to resolve.\n17 Thus, and as explained more fully below, plaintiffsโ claims are moot, and this case should be\n18 dismissed.\n19 ARGUMENT\n20 I. THIS CASE SHOULD BE DISMISSED AS MOOT SINCE NO โTRIPLE-CELLINGโ\nOR OVERCROWDING HAS EXISTED AT ANYTIME SINCE WELL BEFORE THE\n21 SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED. \n22 A. The Standard for Mootness\n23 Generally, โa case becomes moot โwhen the issues presented areno longer live or the parties\n24 lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.โโ Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U.S. 478, 481 (1982)\n25 (quoting United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 396 (1980)); see McBride Cotton\n26\n27\n3There are frequently differences between the counts generated by both ICE and CCA,\n28 largely as a result that ICE generates its counts at 6:30 a.m. on a given day, while CCA generates\nits count at 11:59 p.m. that night. \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss\n3:05-cv-1013-DMS-PCL 4\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 75     Filed 05/04/2007     Page 5 of 10\n1 and Cattle Corp. v. Veneman, 290 F.3d 373 (9th Cir. 2002); H.C. ex rel Gordon v. Koppel, 203 F.3d\n2 610, 612 (9th Cir. 2000).  Addressing each of these prongs in turn, the present case is moot because\n3 the issues presentedare not live and have not been live since before the Second Amended Complaint\n4 was filed.  See Herman v. Tidewater Pacific, Inc., 160 F.3d 1239 (9th Cir. 2002). There is no live\n5 controversy regarding plaintiffsโ claims, as the alleged practice of โtriple-cellingโ or โsevere and\n6 chronic overcrowdingโ do not exist at SDCF.  Perry Decl. at ยถยถ 18, 19.  โGenerally, an action is\n7 mooted whentheissuespresentedarenolongerlive and therefore the parties lack a legally cognizable\n8 interest for which the courts can grant a remedy.โ Oregon Advocacy Center v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101\n9 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Alaska Ctr.for Env't v. United States Forest Serv., 189 F.3d 851, 854 (9th Cir.\n10 1999)); see also Clark v. City of Lakewood, 259 F.3d 996, 1011 (9th Cir. 2001).  A case becomes\n11 moot when interim relieforeventshavedeprivedthecourt of the ability to redress the partyโs injuries.\n12 Cook Inlet Treaty Tribes v. Shalala, 166 F.3d 986 (9thCir.1999) (citing United States v. Alder Creek\n13 Water Co., 823 F.3d 343, 345 (9th Cir. 1987)). SeealsoDemeryv.Arpaio, 378 F.3d 1020, 1025-26\n14 (9th Cir. 2004) (โ[A] suit for injunctive relief is normally moot upon the termination of the conduct\n15 at issue . . .โ).  Here, as of late January 2007, SDCF has not โtriple-celledโ any ICE immigration\n16 detainees and has not housed more than 692 ICE immigration detainees at one time at the facility.\n17 Perry Decl. at ยถยถ17,19.  Also, since late January 2007 no โboatsโ have been used for ICE immigration\n18 detainees, and no immigration pod, administrative segregation unit or holding cell has exceeded\n19 capacity.  Id. at ยถยถ 20, 26.  Furthermore, since late January 2007 no ICE immigration detainees are\n20 forced to sleep on โmakeshift bedsโ in the common day rooms at SDCF, though as of May 1, 2007,\n21 11 ICE immigration detainees in the facilitysleptoncommonareabunk beds in the day room.  Id. at\n22 ยถยถ 22, 23.  As of May 3, 2007, no immigration detainees were assigned to bunk beds located in day\n23 rooms.  Id. at ยถ 23.  As the conditions alleged byplaintiffsin the Second Amended Complaint do not\n24 and have not existed since one month prior to the time the Second Amended Complaint was filed,\n25 there is no live controversy for the Court to grant plaintiffsโ requests for relief.\n26 B. Plaintiffs Fail to Meet the Exception to Mootness\n27 The SupremeCourthas โrecognizedan exception to the general rule [of mootness] in cases that\n28 are โcapable of repetition, yet evading review.โโ Murphy, 455 U.S. at 482.\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss\n3:05-cv-1013-DMS-PCL 5\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 75     Filed 05/04/2007     Page 6 of 10\n1 [I]n the absence of a class action, the capable of repetition yet evading\nreview  doctrine  was limited  to  the  situation  where  two  elements\n2 combined:  (1) the challenged action was in its duration too short to be\nfully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was a\n3 reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would  be\nsubjected to the same action again.\n4\nId.; see also Cole v. Oroville UnionHighSch.Dist., 228F.3d 1092, 1098(9thCir.2000).  โ[A] mere\n5\nphysical or theoretical possibilityโ is insufficient to satisfy the test; [r]ather, . . . there must be a\n6\nโreasonable expectationโ or a โdemonstrated probabilityโ that the same controversy will recur\n7\ninvolving the same complaining party.โ Murphy,455U.S.at 482;see also Demery,378 F.3d at 1027.\n8\nThe Court has โgenerally . . . been unwilling to assume that the party seeking relief will repeat the type\n9\nof misconduct that would once again place himorher atriskofthat injury.โ Honigv.Doe, 484 U.S.\n10\n305, 320 (1988) (citing Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105-106 (1983) (no threat that party\n11\nseeking injunction barringpolice use of chokeholds would be stopped again for traffic violation or for\n12\nanother offense, or would resist arrest if stopped); Murphy,455U.S. at 484 (noreasonto believe that\n13\nparty challenging denial of pre-trial bail โwill once again be in a position to demand bailโ); O'Shea\n14\nv. Littleton, 414 U.S.488,497(1974)(unlikely that parties challenging discriminatory bond-setting,\n15\nsentencing, and jury-fee practices would again violate valid criminal laws). \n16\nIn Demery v. Arpaio, the Ninth Circuit held that whilea suit for injunctive relief is normally\n17\nmoot upon the termination of the conduct at issue,sucha claim is not moot if there is a likelihood of\n18\nrecurrence.  Demery, 378 F.3d at 1025-26; Fed. TradeComm'nv.AffordableMedia,LLC, 179 F.3d\n19\n1228, 1238 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that injunctive relief does not become moot by defendants'\n20\nvoluntary cessation of allegedly wrongful behavior unless it is โabsolutely clear that the allegedly\n21\nwrongfulbehaviorcannotreasonablybeexpected to recurโ) (quoting Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence\n22\nBerkeley Laboratory, 135 F.3d 1260, 1274 (9thCir.1998)); InDemery,the NinthCircuit determined\n23\nthat the plaintiffsโ lawsuit seeking a preliminaryinjunction barring the use of โwebcamsโin a prison\n24\nwas not moot, based on the defendant sheriffโs โunequivocalโ representations and actions indicating\n25\nthat he would reactivate the webcams if the injunction was vacated.  Demery, 378 F.3d at 1026.  In\n26\nstark contrast, the defendants in the present case explicitlyaffirm thatthe allegedwrongful behavior\n27\nis not reasonablyexpected to recur.  See Perry Decl. at ยถยถ 21, 24-26.  Defendants do not reasonably\n28\nexpect to engage in the practice of triple-celling the immigration detainees at SDCF and do not\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss\n3:05-cv-1013-DMS-PCL 6\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 75     Filed 05/04/2007     Page 7 of 10\n1 reasonably expect to significantly increase operation above current levels.  Id. at ยถ 21.  This\n2 expectation is reasonable based on the fact that much of the triple-celling alleged in the Second\n3 Amended Complaint was the immediate result of a loss of bed space due to San Diego Countyโs\n4 requiring the facility to provide the county with 200 beds.  Id. at ยถ 14.  As a result, CCA needed to find\n5 a method of housingthe immigration detainee population affected by this change.  Id.  There is also\n6 no reasonable expectation that โboatsโ will be used for ICE immigration detainees at SDCF, or that\n7 any immigration pod, administrative segregation unit or holding cell will exceed ICEโscapacity. Id.\n8 at ยถ 21, 26. Finally,thereisnoreasonable expectation that ICE immigration detainees will be forced\n9 to sleep on โmakeshift bedsโ in the common day rooms at SDCF.  Id. at ยถ 24.\n10 Thus, for all of the reasons mentioned above, there is no โreasonable expectationโ or\n11 โdemonstrated probabilityโ that meets the standard for plaintiffsโ claims to beconsidered capable of\n12 repetition.4  There is no longer a โliveโ controversy affecting plaintiffs, and plaintiffs lack a legally\n13 cognizable interest in the outcome.  Plaintiffsโ claims are moot, and this case should be dismissed.\n14 ///\n15 ///\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n4  Defendants do not concede that plaintiffs satisfy the first prong of the exception, but\n28 note that both prongs are necessary to meet the test for exception to the mootness doctrine, and\nplaintiffs cannot meet both prongs.\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendantsโ Motion to Dismiss\n3:05-cv-1013-DMS-PCL 7\n\nCase 3:05-cv-01013-DMS-PCL     Document 75     Filed 05/04/2007     Page 8 of 10\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 For the foregoing reasons, the Court should dismiss this action as moot.\n3\nDATED: May 4, 2007\n4\nRespectfully submitted,\n5\n6\nFor Defendants:\n7\nKAREN P.
