    "summary": "<p>On September 2, 1998, a group of sexual offenders who had been civilly confined in a state psychiatric hospital under California's Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVP Act) filed a class action lawsuit, pro se, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the California Department of Corrections, Atascadero State Hospital, and hospital officials in both their official and individual capacities. Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of their confinement, and sought class certification, declaratory and injunctive relief, and monetary damages against defendants in their individual capacities. </p><p> </p><p>The District Court (Judge Terry J. Hatter) granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification on April 13, 2001.</p><p>On February 21, 2003, defendants filed a motion to dismiss on grounds that plaintiffs' suit was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, the state abstention doctrine, or qualified immunity.  Judge Hatter summarily denied defendants' motion to dismiss on August 26, 2003. Defendants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  By opinion issued June 1, 2006 and amended September 28, 2006, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the District Court's summary denial of defendants' motion to dismiss. Hydrick v. Hunter, 466 F.3d 676 (9th Cir. 2006) (amending Hydrick v. Hunter, 449 F.3d 978 (9th Cir. 2006)). Plaintiffs petitioned the Ninth Circuit for panel rehearing and for rehearing en banc; both motions were denied. The Circuit Court withdrew Hydrick v. Hunter, 466 F.3d 676 (9th Cir. 2006) and replaced it with a revised opinion. Hydrick v. Hunter, 500 F.3d 978 (9th Cir. 2007). The Circuit Court held that state hospital officials had qualified immunity to the extent that plaintiffs' claims relied on a First Amendment right not to participate in treatment sessions, but not to the extent that plaintiffs' claims alleged retaliation for filing lawsuits. The Circuit Court further held that plaintiffs stated a § 1983 claim for violations of their Fourth Amendment rights, and that hospital officials were entitled to qualified immunity with regard to procedural due process claims but not substantive due process claims. </p><p>On January 23, 2008, plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. On June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court granted plaintiffs' petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration in light of the pleading standards of Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). Hunter v. Hydrick, 556 U.S. 1256 (2009). The Ninth Circuit directed the parties to submit briefing on the application of Iqbal. On January 12, 2012, the Ninth Circuit held that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiffs' claims for money damages, because plaintiffs had inadequately pled defendants' individual liability for money damages. The Ninth Circuit permitted plaintiffs to proceed with their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. Hydrick v. Hunter, 669 F.3d 937 (9th Cir. 2012).</p><p>The parties then engaged in settlement negotiations which were ultimately unsuccessful.</p><p>On December 28, 2013, plaintiffs filed a Motion for Leave to File Third Amended Complaint, which was denied by the District Court (Judge Terry Hatter) on July 7, 2014 on grounds of futility. Judge Hatter held that venue was improper because plaintiffs were transferred to a different facility and sought to amend their complaint to include allegations against their current conditions of confinement. Judge Hatter held that the underlying events plaintiffs sought to add occurred in Coalinga, CA, and thus plaintiffs needed to bring a separate action in the Eastern District of California where venue was proper to raise these claims. Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration on July 23, 2014, claiming that the District Court misapplied controlling legal standards governing leave to amend and federal venue principles. Plaintiffs asserted that the appropriate action would be to grant leave to amend and then transfer the case to the Eastern District of California. On October 16, 2014, Judge Hatter denied reconsideration because plaintiffs \"[were] not arguing newly discovered evidence, the emergence of any new law or an error by the Court.\"</p><p>On December 13, 2015, plaintiffs filed a motion for change of venue to the Eastern District of California. On January 22, 2016, Judge Hatter denied the motion, saying that the transfer of venue would tax rather than conserve judicial resources. On April 12, 2016, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, saying that because the Ninth Circuit dismissed the plaintiff’s damages claims against the defendants in their individual capacities, plaintiffs only had prospective claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants in their official capacities as (former) Executive Directors of Atascadero State Hospital. But plaintiffs had not been treated at Atascadero since 2005, when they were moved to Coalinga, and so had no effective remedy for declaratory or injunctive relief against the current administrators of Atascadero. The court agreed that the case was now moot, and granted the motion to dismiss on May 13, 2016. Judge Hatter suggested the plaintiffs file a new suit in the Eastern District of California to remedy their complaints against Coalinga. </p><p>On June 9, 2015, plaintiffs filed an appeal to the 9th circuit, which affirmed the District Court’s decision on September 26, 2017. 711 Fed.Appx. 813. The case is now closed. </p><p></p>",

Hydrick v. Hunter, 669 F.3d 937 (9th Cir. 2012). The court denied the plaintiffs motions for a third amended complaint and a change of venue. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, since the plaintiffs were moved from Atascadero State Hospital to Coalinga State Hospital in 2005, and so no longer had an effective remedy for declaratory or injunctive relief against Atascadero. The court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss in 2016, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision in 2017.",

Murphy, Deputy Attorney General, Los Angeles,\nCalifornia, for the defendants-appellants.\nKathryn M. Davis, Latham & Watkins, Los Angeles, Califor-\nnia, for the plaintiffs-appellees. \nOPINION\nPREGERSON, Circuit Judge: \nPlaintiffs-Appellees represent a class of approximately 600\ncivilly committed persons and those awaiting commitment at\nAtascadero State Hospital pursuant to California’s Sexually\nViolent  Predators  Act  (“SVP  Act”).  In  this  suit,  Plaintiffs\nallege that the conditions of their confinement violate their\nconstitutional rights. They request declaratory and injunctive\nrelief,  as  well  as  monetary  damages.  Defendants  filed  a\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5929\nmotion to dismiss based largely on qualified immunity, but\ntheir motion was summarily denied by the district court. We\nhave jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm in\npart, and reverse in part. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND1\n1.  California’s Sexually Violent Predators Scheme \nThe SVP Act defines an SVP as a person “convicted of a\nsexually  violent  offense  against  two  or  more  victims  for\nwhich he or she received a determinate sentence and who has\na diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger\nto the health and safety of others” i.e., is “likely [to] engage\nin sexually violent criminal behavior.” See Cal. Welf. & Inst.\nCode § 6600(a).2 At least six months before a person who has\ncommitted the predicate offenses is to complete his sentence,\nhe is evaluated by the Department of Corrections and Depart-\nment of Mental Health. Id. § 6601. If those two departments\nagree that the person evaluated may be an SVP, a petition for\ncommitment may be filed by the district attorney or counsel\nfor the county in which the evaluated person was convicted.\nId. § 6601(i). If that person is found by a jury to be an SVP\nwho poses a danger to the health and safety of others, he is\ncivilly  committed  for  an  indefinite  period  to  commence\nafter his criminal sentence is fulfilled. Id. §§ 6602-6604. \nOnce  civilly  committed,  Plaintiffs  undergo  a  five-phase\ntreatment program. Phase One comprises group sessions that\neducate the SVP about California’s SVP Act. During Phase\nOne, the SVP is required to attend and participate in the treat-\nment sessions. If he does not, his access level3 is reduced and\n1The following facts are taken from the complaint and are assumed to\nbe true for purposes of reviewing this motion to dismiss. \n2Although the SVP Act is gender-neutral, there was only one female\nSVP at the time of the filing of this complaint. She was not housed at\nAtascadero, and was, therefore, not included as part of the Plaintiffs’ class.\n3As explained in the complaint, all persons at Atascadero are assigned\nan Access Level that dictates access to various facilities and privileges. A\n\n5930 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nhe is not allowed to advance to Phase Two of the treatment\nprogram. In addition, an SVP’s failure to attend or participate\nin the treatment sessions is used against him at future proba-\nble cause and confinement hearings. The SVP cannot advance\nbeyond Phase One unless he signs a statement in which he\nacknowledges that he has an “illness” that requires “treat-\nment.” Plaintiffs allege that the signed statements are often\nused against the SVP in future probable cause and confine-\nment hearings. \nPhases Two through Five of the treatment plan involve\n“cognitive” treatment. This treatment includes viewing videos\nthat  depict  violent  or  other  inappropriate  sexual  activities\nwhile  a  repugnant  odor  or  other  unpleasant  sensation  is\napplied to elicit a negative association. \nEach year, a committed person has a right to a show cause\nhearing to determine whether his commitment should be con-\ntinued. Id. § 6605(a)-(b). If it is found that the SVP continues\nto be a danger to the health or safety of the community, the\nperson is committed for two years from the date of the find-\ning. Id. § 6605(e). These successive periods of commitment\ncan be continued indefinitely, or until the SVP completes all\nfive  phases  of  treatment.  Upon  successful  completion  of\nPhase Five, the SVP is conditionally released under the super-\nvision of the California Mental Health Department. According\nto Plaintiffs, “only a handful of SVPs have been allowed into\nPhase Four and no SVP has progressed to Phase Five or ha[s]\nbeen found to be ready for release under the treatment protocol.”4\nLevel 1 patient may not leave his unit without an escort, a Level 2 patient\nmay leave his unit, but cannot go to the courtyard or canteen, a Level 3\npatient may have some access to the law library, canteen and courtyard,\netc. \n4At oral argument it was alleged that, since the time Plaintiffs filed their\ncomplaint, three (of the over seven hundred) people committed under the\nSexually Violent Predators Act have been released into their communities.\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5931\n2.  The Current Lawsuit \nOn September 2, 1998, Plaintiffs filed a pro se class action,\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in district court against Defendants-\nAppellants  Stephen  Mayberg  (Director  of  the  California\nDepartment of Mental Health), Cal A. Terhune (Director of\nthe  California  Department  of  Corrections),  Jon  DeMorales\n(former  Executive  Director  at  Atascadero  State  Hospital),\nGrenda  Ernst  (Clinical  Administrator  at  Atascadero  State\nHospital), and Craig Nelson (Senior Psychologist Specialist at\nAtascadero State Hospital) (collectively “Defendants”). Plain-\ntiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as mone-\ntary damages, on the grounds that the policies and procedures\nthat  govern  Plaintiffs’  confinement  and  treatment  at  Atas-\ncadero State Hospital violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.\nIn March 1999, the district court appointed pro bono coun-\nsel for Plaintiffs. Counsel filed an amended complaint approx-\nimately  five  months  later.  Defendants  filed  a  motion  to\ndismiss. The motion to dismiss raised Eleventh Amendment\nand qualified immunity defenses. The district court denied\nDefendants’ motion in a one line order. \nPlaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 14,\n2002.5 Both the first and second amended complaints alleged\nthat Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ rights by, inter alia: (1)\nforce-medicating Plaintiffs in non-emergency situations; (2)\nreducing Plaintiffs’ access levels and other privileges as a\nform of punishment for refusing to participate in treatment\nsessions or as retaliation for filing lawsuits; (3) putting Plain-\ntiffs in restraints for nonthreatening and/or nondisruptive con-\nduct,  including  the  refusal  to  participate  in  treatment  or\ntherapy;  (4)  subjecting  Plaintiffs  to  public  strip-searches\n(sometimes while in four-point restraints); (5) failing to pro-\n5The second amended complaint substituted Melvin Hunter, the current\nExecutive Director at Atascadero State Hospital, for Jon DeMorales, the\nformer Executive Director, but contained no substantive alterations. \n\n5932 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\ntect Plaintiffs from abuse of other patients or of Atascadero\nemployees; (6) failing to provide Plaintiffs with constitution-\nally satisfactory conditions of confinement; (7) forcing Plain-\ntiffs  to  participate  in  treatment;  and  (8)  denying  Plaintiffs\nadequate treatment, thereby converting Plaintiffs’ civil con-\nfinement to a de facto extension of their prison sentence. \nOnce  again,  Defendants  moved  to  dismiss  the  second\namended complaint, on the same grounds presented in their\nfirst motion to dismiss. The district court again denied Defen-\ndants’  motion  to  dismiss  in  a  one  line  order.  Defendants\ntimely filed their notice of appeal. Defendants contend that\nthe district court erred by failing to rule that the Eleventh\nAmendment, state abstention doctrine, or qualified immunity\nbarred Plaintiffs’ suit. \nANALYSIS\nA.  Standard of Review  \nWe review de novo the district court’s denial of a motion\nto dismiss. Decker v. Advantage Fund, Ltd., 362 F.3d 593,\n595-96 (9th Cir. 2004). Immunity under the Eleventh Amend-\nment presents a question of law, which we review de novo.\nSee Demshki v. Monteith, 255 F.3d 986, 988 (9th Cir. 2001).\nTo determine if Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity,\nwe review de novo whether governing law was clearly estab-\nlished at the time of the alleged violation and whether the spe-\ncific facts alleged constitute a violation of established law.\nSee  Mabe  v.  San  Bernardino  County  Dept.  of  Pub.  Soc.\nServs., 237 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir. 2001). \nAlthough a district court’s denial of a motion under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is not ordinarily appealable,\nthe denial of a claim for immunity is appealable before final\njudgment under the collateral order doctrine and is reviewed\nde novo. See Morley v. Walker, 175 F.3d 756, 759 (9th Cir.\n1999). All allegations of material fact are accepted as true and\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5933\nshould be construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs.\nSee Resnick v. Hayes, 213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir. 2000). The\n“complaint  should  not  be  dismissed  [under  Rule  12(b)(6)]\nunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no\nset of facts in support of the claim that would entitle the plain-\ntiff to relief.” Thompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 895 (9th Cir.\n2002). \nWe  note,  again,  the  special  difficulty  of  deciding  the\nmotion to dismiss a Defendant on qualified immunity grounds\nat this stage. Under the notice pleading standard of the Fed-\neral Rules, plaintiffs are only required to give a “short and\nplain statement” of their claims. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(a)(2).\nThus, “[w]hen a federal court reviews the sufficiency of a\ncomplaint, before the reception of any evidence either by affi-\ndavit or admissions, [our] task is necessarily a limited one.\nThe issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but\nwhether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support\nthe claims.” Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974). \nAs we recognized in Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373\nF.3d 952 (9th Cir. 2004), a motion to dismiss on qualified\nimmunity grounds puts the court in the difficult position of\ndeciding  “far-reaching  constitutional  questions  on  a  non-\nexistent factual record.” Id. at 957. We strongly suggested\nthat, while “government officials have the right . . . to raise\n. . . qualified immunity defense on a motion to dismiss, the\nexercise of that authority is not a wise choice in every case.”\nId. We find that especially true here. The policy justifying\nqualified immunity motions at this stage is to protect officers\nagainst the burden of discovery and pre-trial motions. Behrens\nv. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 308 (1996). In this case, the parties\nhad already engaged in discovery for several years, and it\nappears  that  discovery  was  almost  complete.  Defendants\ncould have presented this as a motion for summary judgment,\nand we would have a more developed factual record to guide\nour  decision.  Because  Defendants’  motion  is  framed  as  a\nmotion to dismiss, we must evaluate the merits of Defendants’\n\n5934 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nqualified immunity defense before we know the full extent of\nthe alleged abuses at Atascadero, or the reason behind Atas-\ncadero policy, or the level of involvement Defendants had in\ncreating the conditions at Atascadero. As we decide Defen-\ndants’ motion, however, we are cautious not to eviscerate the\nnotice pleading standard in suits where qualified immunity is\nat issue. See Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d\n1119, 1125-26 (9th Cir. 2002).6 \nB.  The Law of the Case Doctrine Does Not Apply \nPlaintiffs argue that under the law of the case doctrine, we\nshould not reach the merits of Defendants’ appeal because\nDefendants’ second motion to dismiss was barred by the dis-\ntrict court’s ruling that denied Defendants’ first motion to dis-\nmiss. The relevant facts are as follows: after Plaintiffs filed\ntheir first amended complaint, Defendants filed a motion to\ndismiss on the grounds of failure to state a claim and qualified\nimmunity. The district court denied Defendants’ motion in a\nsummary order, and Defendants did not appeal. Plaintiffs filed\na second amended complaint, in which they changed only the\nname  of  one  of  the  Defendants.  Defendants  then  filed  a\nmotion to dismiss on grounds substantially similar to those\nstated in the first motion to dismiss. The district court again\ndenied the motion to dismiss in a summary order. Plaintiffs\nargue that Defendants’ second motion to dismiss is an imper-\n6With all respect to our dissenting colleague, Plaintiffs’ complaint states\nmore than “violations of extremely abstract rights.” See Dissent at 5962\n(citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40 (1987)). Maybe\nPlaintiffs can support these claims with evidentiary support and maybe\nthey can’t. Maybe Defendants can justify their behavior, or at least con-\nvince us that their conduct was not clearly in violation of Plaintiffs’ rights.\nBut the point of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not to evaluate the veracity\nof Plaintiffs’ allegations, or to speculate as to Defendants’ justifications\nfor their actions. Rather, unless it is “beyond doubt” that the plaintiff can-\nnot prove facts that would entitle him to relief, the Rule 12(b)(6) motion\nmust be denied. See Navarro v. Block, 250 F.3d 729 (9th Cir. 2001). The\nstandard is no different for a civil rights claim than for any other claim.\nSee Galbraith, 307 F.3d at 1125-26. \n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5935\nmissible “second bite at the apple” and should be dismissed\nunder the law of the case doctrine. \n[1] “Under the ‘law of the case’ doctrine, a court is ordinar-\nily precluded from reexamining an issue previously decided\nby the same court, or a higher court, in the same case.” Rich-\nardson v. United States, 841 F.2d 993, 996 (9th Cir. 1988)\n(citations omitted). For the law of the case doctrine to apply,\n“the issue in question must have been ‘decided explicitly or\nby  necessary  implication  in  [the]  previous  disposition.’ ”\nUnited States v. Lummi Indian Tribe, 235 F.3d 443, 452 (9th\nCir. 2000) (citing Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. EEOC, 691 F.2d\n438, 441 (9th Cir. 1982)); United States v. Cote, 51 F.3d 178\n(9th Cir. 1995) (“[T]he law of the case acts as a bar only when\nthe issue in question was actually considered and decided by\nthe first court.”). \n[2] The district court denied Defendants’ first motion to\ndismiss and their second motion to dismiss in a summary\norder. Thus the district court’s grounds for rejecting Defen-\ndants’ two motions are not explicit. Nor can we say that any\nissue was decided by implication in the first summary order\ndenying Defendants’ first motion to dismiss. Either motion\ncould have been denied for any number of procedural or tech-\nnical reasons unrelated to the substance of the motions. It is\npossible that Defendants’ second motion was denied based on\nthe law of the case doctrine, or that the district court decided,\nin its discretion, not to apply the law of the case doctrine due\nto subsequent changes in the law, or the “manifest injustice”\nthat would result given the new party to the suit. See United\nStates  v.  Alexander,  106  F.3d  874,  876  (9th  Cir.  1997).\nBecause it is impossible for us to determine the basis of denial\nof either motion, we conclude that the “law of the case” does\nnot apply and address the appeal on the merits.  \nC.  Eleventh Amendment Immunity and the \nAbstention Doctrine Do Not Bar Plaintiffs’ Claims\n[3] Defendants concede that suits for injunctive or declara-\ntory relief do not violate the Eleventh Amendment under Ex\n\n5936 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nparte  Young,  209  U.S.  123  (1908).  Defendants  contend,\ninstead, that Plaintiffs’ request for monetary damages against\nthem is barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitu-\ntion. Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs cannot seek mone-\ntary damages against state officials in their official capacity.\nSee Doe v. Lawrence Livermore Nat’l Lab., 131 F.3d 836,\n839 (9th Cir. 1997). But the Eleventh Amendment does not\nbar suits seeking damages against state officials in their per-\nsonal capacity. See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 30 (1991);\nAshker v. Cal. Dep’t of Corr., 112 F.3d 392, 394-95 (9th Cir.\n1997). \n[4] The second amended complaint states that Defendants\nacted in and are being sued in their individual and official\ncapacities. This creates a presumption that Plaintiffs are seek-\ning monetary damages against defendants in their personal\ncapacity. See Romano v. Bible, 169 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.\n1999) (stating a strong presumption in favor of a personal\ncapacity  suit  where  an  official  capacity  suit  for  damages\nwould  be  barred).  Accordingly,  the  Eleventh  Amendment\ndoes not bar Plaintiffs’ claim for damages against Defendants\nin their individual capacities. \n[5] Defendants also argue that they are immune from Plain-\ntiffs’ suit because Plaintiffs attempt to enforce pendent state\nlaw claims in federal court. Plaintiffs refer, in their first, sec-\nond, and tenth claims for relief, to provisions in the California\nConstitution  that  parallel  the  applicable  provision  in  the\nUnited States Constitution. Plaintiffs concede that they could\nnot prevail on a § 1983 claim based on a violation of state\nlaw, because § 1983, by its own terms, protects only viola-\ntions of federal law. See Ybarra v. Bastian, 647 F.2d 891, 892\n(9th Cir. 1981). Instead, they cite California law only where\nit is legitimate to do so, e.g., where there is a state-created lib-\nerty or property interest at stake. See, e.g., Paul v. Davis, 424\nU.S. 693, 710-12 (1976). Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims are\nnot barred on this ground, and we need not consider Defen-\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5937\ndants’ arguments that Plaintiffs’ state law claims are “novel\nand complex” under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).7 \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Section 1983 Claims \n[6] Defendants’ first substantive argument is that Plaintiffs\nhave not properly pled a claim under Section 1983, in that\nthey are not proper defendants for a suit. “To sustain an action\nunder section 1983, a plaintiff must show (1) that the conduct\ncomplained of was committed by a person acting under color\nof state law; and (2) that the conduct deprived the plaintiff of\na federal constitutional or statutory right.” Wood v. Ostrander,\n879 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir. 1989). \nThere is no question that all Defendants were acting under\nthe color of California law when they engaged in the alleged\nunconstitutional conduct. Defendants argue, instead, that their\nconduct did not cause Plaintiffs any deprivation of their con-\nstitutional or statutory rights.  \n“A person ‘subjects’ another to the deprivation of a consti-\ntutional right, within the meaning of [§] 1983, if [that person]\ndoes an affirmative act, participates in another’s affirmative\nacts, or omits to perform an act which [that person] is legally\nrequired to do that causes the deprivation of which complaint\nis  made.”  Johnson  v.  Duffy,  588  F.2d  740,  743  (9th  Cir.\n7Defendants also suggest that the federal courts should “abstain” under\nthe “Abstention Doctrine.” They appear to confuse abstention with denial\nof pendent jurisdiction under the “novel and complex” clause of 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1367(c). If they meant abstention proper, they waived that argument\nbecause they failed to raise abstention before the District Court. See Conn.\nGen. Life Ins. v. New Images of Beverly Hills, 321 F.3d 878, 882 (9th Cir.\n2003). Nor do we see any reason that the federal courts would abstain in\nthis situation. Pullman abstention is not appropriate because the driving\nforce behind each of Plaintiffs’ claims is a right guaranteed by the United\nStates Constitution, and state court clarification of state law would not\nmake a federal court ruling unnecessary. See R.R. Comm. of Tex. v. Pull-\nman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 499-501 (1941). \n\n5938 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\n1978). Indeed, the “requisite causal connection can be estab-\nlished not only by some kind of direct personal participation\nin the deprivation, but also by setting in motion a series of\nacts by others which the actor knows or reasonably should\nknow would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.”\nId. at 743-744. \nIn limited circumstances, a person can also be subject to\n§ 1983 liability for the acts of others. Although there is no\npure respondeat superior liability under § 1983, a supervisor\nis liable for the constitutional violations of subordinates “if\nthe supervisor participated in or directed the violations, or\nknew of the violations and failed to act to prevent them.” Tay-\nlor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989). \n[7] Plaintiffs proceed on both of these theories: (a) that\nDefendants  created  policies  and  procedures  that  violated\nPlaintiffs’ constitutional rights; and (b) that Defendants were\nwillfully blind to constitutional violations committed by their\nsubordinates. Because Defendants were directors and policy-\nmakers for Atascadero State Hospital, we believe Plaintiffs\nhave sufficiently alleged that the constitutional violations they\nsuffered were “set in motion” by Defendants’ policy decisions\nor, at the very least, that Defendants knew of these abuses and\ndemonstrated a deliberate indifference to the SVPs’ plight. \n[8] Defendants are correct that, under Leer v. Murphy, 844\nF.2d 628, 633-34 (9th Cir. 1988), Plaintiffs will need to show\nhow the deliberate indifference or affirmative actions of each\ndefendant caused a constitutional violation before they can\nseek monetary damages against any individual defendant. At\nthis stage of pleading, however, they need not specifically\ndelineate how each Defendant contributed to the violation of\ntheir constitutional rights. Indeed, we do not see how, prior to\ndiscovery, they could plead the individual roles of each state\nofficer with any more specificity. Taking the statements in the\ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, Plain-\ntiffs may be able to state a claim against all of the named\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5939\nDefendants,  each  of  whom  played  an  instrumental  role  in\npolicy-making and enforcement at Atascadero State Hospital.\nTherefore, we hold that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged\nDefendants’  role  in  the  alleged  constitutional  violations\nagainst SVPs to survive this motion to dismiss. \nE.  Defendants’ Qualified Immunity Defense \nDefendants also argued that the district court erred when it\ndenied them qualified immunity. As Defendants have con-\nceded, qualified immunity is only an immunity from a suit for\ndamages, and does not provide immunity from suit for declar-\natory or injunctive relief. See Los Angeles Police Protective\nLeague v. Gates, 995 F.2d 1469, 1472 (9th Cir. 1993). Defen-\ndants instead argue that they are entitled to qualified immu-\nnity from all of Plaintiffs’ claims to the extent that Plaintiffs\nseek monetary damages. \nIn analyzing Defendants’ qualified immunity defense, we\nmust determine, taking the facts in the light most favorable to\nPlaintiffs: (1) what right has been violated; (2) whether that\nright was so “clearly established” at the time of the incident\nthat a reasonable official would have been aware that the con-\nduct violated constitutional bounds; and (3) whether a reason-\nable  public  official  could  have  believed  that  the  alleged\nconduct was lawful. See Newell v. Sauser, 79 F.3d 115, 117\n(9th Cir. 1996). \n[9] In order to withstand Defendants’ claims of qualified\nimmunity, then, Plaintiffs must first allege a violation of a\nright that was clearly established in 1998 — the time the\nalleged constitutional violations first took place. See Anderson\nv. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40 (1987); Sorrels v. McKee,\n290 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir. 2002). To defeat qualified immu-\nnity,  “the  right  allegedly  violated  must  be  defined  at  the\nappropriate level of specificity before a court can determine\nif it was clearly established.” Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603,\n615 (1999). \n\n5940 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nBut Plaintiffs need not establish that Defendants’ “behavior\nhad been previously declared unconstitutional.” Blueford v.\nPrunty, 108 F.3d 251, 254 (9th Cir. 1997). In fact, “precedent\ndirectly on point is not necessary to demonstrate a clearly\nestablished right.” Id. at 255. Rather, “[i]f the only reasonable\nconclusion from binding authority were that the disputed right\nexisted, even if no case had specifically so declared, [Defen-\ndants] would be on notice of the right and [officials] would\nnot be qualifiedly immune if they acted to offend it.” Id. If the\noccasion has not risen for our circuit to reach a question, we\nmay draw clearly established law from other circuits. Prison\nLegal News v. Lehman, 397 F.3d 692, 701 (9th Cir. 2005); see\nalso Jacobs v. City of Chicago, 215 F.3d 758, 767 (7th Cir.\n2000) (finding a violation of clearly established law where\nthere is “such a clear trend in the case law” that recognition\nof the right is “only a matter of time”). \n[10] Before we consider Plaintiffs’ claims individually to\ndetermine whether they were clearly established, we address\na threshold question that applies to Plaintiffs’ claims more\ngenerally. Defendants argue, as a broad proposition, that dam-\nages are not appropriate in this suit because the law applicable\nto SVPs is still evolving. We acknowledge that this suit is\nunique, in that it is one of the first widespread class actions\nto challenge the conditions of detention for civilly confined\nSVPs. Nonetheless, we believe Defendants may have trans-\ngressed some clearly established boundaries, or at least, that\ntheir claims cannot be dismissed at this stage of litigation.\nFirst, civilly detained persons must be afforded “more consid-\nerate treatment and conditions of confinement than criminals\nwhose  conditions  of  confinement  are  designed  to  punish.”\nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 322 (1982); see also\nSharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir. 2000). It fol-\nlows logically, then, that the rights afforded prisoners set a\nfloor for those that must be afforded SVPs, and that where\nDefendants violate a standard that is clearly established in the\nprison context, the violation is clearly established under the\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5941\nSVP scheme.8 Second, where there is a clearly established\nbody of law that applies to all civilly committed persons,\nthere is no reason that the law should not apply to SVPs as\nwell. For, as we have previously held: \nThe state cannot have it both ways. If confinement\nof a sexually violent predator is civil for the pur-\nposes of evaluation under the Ex Post Facto clause,\nthat confinement is civil for the purposes of defining\nthe rights to which the detainee is entitled while con-\nfined. Civil status means civil status, with all the . . .\nrights that accompany it. \nJones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 933 (9th Cir. 2004). Thus,\nthere  are  two  bodies  of  law  from  which  we  might  draw\n“clearly  established”  law  for  qualified  immunity  purposes:\nfirst,  where  the  SVPs  claim  a  violation  of  a  right  that  is\nclearly established even in the prison context, and second,\nwhere the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is clearly\nestablished for all civilly detained persons. \nAt the same time, we acknowledge at the outset that it is\nnot always clearly established how much more expansive the\nrights of civilly detained persons are than those of criminally\ndetained persons. As discussed below, the rights afforded civ-\nilly detained persons are flexible enough to take into account\nthe circumstances of detention. The law generally requires a\ncareful balancing of the rights of individuals who are detained\nfor treatment, not punishment, against the state’s interests in\ninstitutional security and the safety of those housed at the\n8Contrary to our dissenting colleague’s analysis, we see this as a very\nminor analytical step. The State detains prisoners for the purpose of pun-\nishment. It detains SVPs for the purpose of treatment, and its treatment has\nno punitive element to it. It seems entirely unremarkable, then, to say that\nthe State cannot treat SVPs worse than prisoners. The “only reasonable\nconclusion from binding authority” is that the conditions of confinement\nfor SVPs cannot be more harsh than those under which prisoners are\ndetained. Blueford, 108 F.3d at 255. \n\n5942 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nfacility. See, e.g., Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 319-322. In weigh-\ning those interests, it cannot be ignored that, unlike the plain-\ntiff  in  Youngberg  who  was  civilly  committed  because  of\nmental infirmities, SVPs have been civilly committed subse-\nquent to criminal convictions and have been adjudged to pose\na danger to the health and safety of others. Therefore, the\nrights  of  SVPs  may  not  necessarily  be  coexistensive  with\nthose of all other civilly detained persons.9 \nWith these threshold issues in mind, we review each of\nPlaintiffs’ claims to determine whether Plaintiffs have suffi-\nciently pleaded a violation of clearly established rights. \n1.  Plaintiffs’  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendment\nRights \nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants have retaliated against\nthem for filing lawsuits regarding conditions at Atascadero\nState Hospital. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that, as a result of\npreparing this suit and other complaints about the conditions\nat Atascadero, Plaintiffs have been subjected to access-level\nreductions,  harassment  by  Atascadero  personnel,  excessive\nroom search and seizures of property, and that they have been\ndenied access to the library. \n[11] It is clear that the Fourteenth Amendment right to\n9We thus agree with our dissenting colleague that context is critical in\nconstitutional claims. Nonetheless, this admission — that it is not clear\nhow much more extensive the rights of SVPs are — does not inexorably\nlead to the conclusion that there can be no violation of clearly established\nlaw. It may not be clear exactly what due process rights are to be afforded\nSVPs, but surely it is clear that certain actions — forcing Plaintiffs to live\nin squalid conditions, turning a blind eye to physical attacks against SVPs,\nand forcing SVPs to take medication as punishment or in retaliation for fil-\ning a lawsuit or for refusing to speak during treatment sessions — trans-\ngressed the boundary. Surely it would not require “law train[ing]” or\nclairvoyance to recognize that these actions, as alleged by Plaintiffs, do\nnot comport with due process. \n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5943\naccess the courts survives detention. Bounds v. Smith, 430\nU.S. 817, 821-22 (1977) (“It is now established beyond doubt\nthat  prisoners  have  a  constitutional  right  of  access  to  the\ncourts.”); Cornett v. Donovan, 51 F.3d 894, 898 (9th Cir.\n1995) (holding that “right of access [to the courts] is guaran-\nteed  to  people  institutionalized  in  a  state  mental  hospital\nregardless of whether they are civilly committed after crimi-\nnal proceedings or civilly committed on grounds of danger-\nousness”). Similarly, punishment in retaliation for exercising\none’s right to access the courts may constitute a First Amend-\nment violation. Rizzo v. Dawson, 778 F.2d 527, 531-32 (9th\nCir. 1985). We have held that the prohibition against retalia-\ntory punishment is “ ‘clearly established law’ in the Ninth\nCircuit, for qualified immunity purposes.” Pratt v. Rowland,\n65 F.3d 802, 806 & n.4 (9th Cir. 1995). Given the facts alleged,10\nwe believe Plaintiffs may be able to prove that they have been\npunished in retaliation for the exercise of their First and Four-\nteenth Amendment rights to file grievances about the condi-\ntions of their confinement. Accordingly, their claims should\nnot be dismissed at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage. \nPlaintiffs also allege that Defendants force them to partici-\npate in treatment that violates their First Amendment rights.\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants bar SVPs from\nprogressing  beyond  Phase  One  until  they  sign  a  contract\nadmitting that they have an illness and need treatment. The\ndecision to sign the contract is the ultimate “Catch-22”: dur-\ning re-commitment hearings, the contract is used against those\nwho sign it as an admission of illness, and used against those\nwho do not sign it as a refusal to be amenable to treatment.\n10We note that Plaintiffs’ original pro se complaint contains particularly\npersuasive narratives on this issue. Specifically, it details how Atascadero\npersonnel responded when they caught wind of this suit, altering schedules\nso that the coordinators of this action would not be able to work together,\ntelling Plaintiffs that their meeting in the library was an “illegal assem-\nbly,” limiting law library time, scheduling mandatory group sessions dur-\ning the SVPs’ library time, and refusing to give SVPs drafting paper\nbecause it was “only for the mental patients to draft appeals.” \n\n5944 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nPlaintiffs also allege that SVPs who attend but do not vocally\nparticipate in group treatment sessions are found by Defen-\ndants to be “not progressing”; accordingly, these SVPs do not\nadvance to higher levels and are subjected to access level\nrestrictions. Plaintiffs argue that they have a First Amendment\nright to refrain from saying that they have an illness and to\nrefuse to participate in treatment, and that Defendants may not\npunish them for exercising their rights. \nWe note that there may be a First Amendment right not to\nparticipate in treatment, a right respected by the language of\nCalifornia’s SVP Act, if not in its implementation. Specifi-\ncally, the SVP Act directs:\nAmenability to treatment is not required for a finding\nthat  any  person  is  a  person  described  in  Section\n6600, nor is it required for treatment of that person.\nTreatment does not mean that the treatment be suc-\ncessful or potentially successful, nor does it mean\nthat the person must recognize his or her problem\nand willingly participate in the treatment program.\nCal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 6606(b) (emphasis added). While\nit may be in Plaintiffs’ interest to participate in treatment, and\nthe State may create incentives to encourage such participa-\ntion, it is clear that “[t]he right of freedom of thought and of\nreligion as guaranteed by the Constitution against State action\nincludes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain\nfrom speaking at all.” W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette,\n319 U.S. 624, 645 (1943) (Murphy, J., concurring). As is the\ncase with prisoners, civilly committed persons certainly retain\nthose First Amendment rights not inherently inconsistent with\nthe circumstances of their detention. See Turner v. Safley, 482\nU.S. 78, 89 (1987). The language of the above statute strongly\nsuggests that refusal to recognize one’s “illness” or affirma-\ntively participate in treatment is not inherently inconsistent\nwith the purposes for which SVPs are detained. \n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5945\nGranted, Plaintiffs are not actually forced to speak. But in\nthis case, the stakes for refusing to speak are so high that\nPlaintiffs’  participation  in  treatment  is  almost  compulsory.\nIndeed, an SVP who exercised his right not to admit his ill-\nness could be detained indefinitely: he would never advance\npast Phase One and his refusal could be used against him at\nhis re-commitment hearing as a sign that he was not suffi-\nciently “rehabilitated” to re-enter society. \nSeveral inmates who are criminally detained raised analo-\ngous arguments, on Fifth Amendment grounds, that programs\nthat force sexual offenders to admit and discuss those offenses\nviolate their rights against self-incrimination. In McKune v.\nLile, 536 U.S. 24 (2002), the Supreme Court found that a pro-\ngram did not violate the Fifth Amendment where the program\n“did not extend his term of incarceration . . . [or] affect his eli-\ngibility for good-time credits or parole,” and the only adverse\nconsequence was that he was moved to the less desirable non-\ntreatment area of the prison. Id. at 38-39. \nBut McKune explicitly left open the question of whether a\ngreater deprivation of liberty might run afoul of the Constitu-\ntion by essentially compelling detainees to incriminate them-\nselves. At least one court, reading McKune, allowed an inmate\nto proceed past pre-trial motions on First Amendment grounds\nwhere the right to parole was conditioned on participation in\ntreatment. See Wolfe v. Penn. Dep’t of Corrections, 334 F.\nSupp. 2d 762, (E.D. Pa. 2004). Similarly, in this case, where\nthe stakes for participation in treatment are so high, the depri-\nvations involved in refusing to participate in treatment may\nrise to the level of compulsion that might violate the First\nAmendment. \n[12] The question at this stage, however, is not whether the\nright exists, but whether such a right is clearly established\nunder the First Amendment. Given the volatility of the law on\nthis point, we cannot say that it is. The challenged programs\nare facially related to the purposes for which the SVPs are\n\n5946 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\ndetained, and while SVPs may have a right to refuse to partic-\nipate in such treatment, it is not yet clear the extent to which\nthe State can condition privileges or advancement on partici-\npation in such treatment. As such, we believe these claims\nmay  be  more  appropriately  considered  for  declaratory  or\ninjunctive relief. \n[13] Thus, we hold that Plaintiffs’ First Amendment claims\nwere based on clearly established law insofar as they chal-\nlenge action in retaliation for filing lawsuits. To the extent\nthat the claim relies on a First Amendment right not to partici-\npate in treatment sessions, Defendants have qualified immu-\nnity, because the law on this point is not clearly established.\n2.  Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment Rights \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  Defendants’  policies  and  practices\nsubject  Plaintiffs  to  unreasonable  searches,  seizures,  and\nunnecessary use of force. According to Plaintiffs, they are\nsubjected to public strip searches; to retaliatory searches of\ntheir possessions; and to arbitrary seizure of their personal\nbelongings upon arrival at Atascadero. SVPs are also placed\nin shackles during transport to Atascadero and during visits\nfrom family and friends. When they refuse to participate in\ntreatment, they are subjected to “red light alarms” even if they\ndo not post any physical risk.11 Moreover, they are force-\nmedicated as a means of intimidation and punishment, and for\nthe convenience of staff. \nAccepting these allegations as true, we believe Plaintiffs\nmay be able to state a “clearly established” violation of their\nFourth Amendment rights, and thus, the claims are not appro-\npriate for dismissal at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage. The watchword\nof the Fourth Amendment in every context is reasonableness.\nAs this court held in Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694 (9th\n11As explained in the complaint, a “red light alarm” is when ten to\ntwenty staff members surround and restrain the patient. \n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5947\nCir. 1997), “the Fourth Amendment right to be secure against\nunreasonable searches and seizures ‘extends to incarcerated\nprisoners.’ ” Id. at 699. Thus, this protection certainly extends\nto SVPs. \n[14] Of course, “the reasonableness of a particular search\n[or seizure] is determined by reference to the [detention] con-\ntext.” Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir.\n1988). As with any detained person, there are concerns that\nmirror those that arise in the prison context: i.e., “the safety\nand security of guards and others in the facility, order within\nthe facility and the efficiency of the facility’s operations.”\nAndrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052, 1061 (8th Cir. 2001). But\neven so, qualified immunity does not protect a search or sei-\nzure that is arbitrary, retaliatory, or clearly exceeds the legiti-\nmate purpose of detention. \n[15] Under this framework, we cannot dismiss Plaintiffs’\nclaim at this stage. The “reasonableness” of a search or sei-\nzure is a fact-intensive inquiry that cannot be determined at\nthis stage. See, e.g., Thompson, 111 F.3d 694 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(evaluating the reasonableness of a strip search based on the\nmanner and scope of the search, the place, and the justifica-\ntion). It is impossible to make such a fact-specific determina-\ntion  when  the  precise  circumstances  of  the  searches  or\nseizures are not before the court and when the Defendants\nhave not yet had a chance to explain their justification for the\nalleged searches or seizures. We cannot say, then, that Plain-\ntiffs cannot possibly state a “clearly established violation”\nbased on any facts consistent with their pleadings.12 There-\nfore, Defendants do not have a right to qualified immunity\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). \n12The excessive force claims under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amend-\nment — e.g., forced medication, excessive use of red light alarms, and use\nof shackles — largely duplicate Plaintiffs’ excessive force claims under\nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and their claims for Substantive\nDue Process. We will consider all these claims together, below. \n\n5948 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\n3.  Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses \nPlaintiffs allege violations of the double jeopardy clause\nand ex post facto clause. While Plaintiffs concede that these\ntwo clauses have punishment as an essential prerequisite, and\nthat the SVP Act is a civil detention statute, they claim that\nthe SVP Act is punitive as applied to them. As such, they\nargue that their double jeopardy and ex post facto claims are\nnot barred. \n[16] In upholding a law similar to California’s SVP Act,\nthe Supreme Court held that “[a]n Act, found to be civil, can-\nnot be deemed punitive ‘as applied’ to a single individual in\nviolation of the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses\nand provide cause for release.” Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250,\n267 (2001). Similarly, the California Supreme Court stressed\nthe civil nature of a sexually violent predator commitment and\nrejected challenges to California’s SVP Act based on the Ex\nPost Facto and Double Jeopardy clauses of the federal consti-\ntution. See Hubbart v. Superior Court, 19 Cal. 4th 1138, 1171\n(Cal. 1999). We believe Plaintiffs’ claims based on the Dou-\nble Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses of the federal consti-\ntution are foreclosed.13 \n[17] Plaintiffs argue that Seling does not control because\nthey are not “seeking release” as was the habeas petitioner in\nSeling. They raise a purely artificial difference. The court in\nSeling made it abundantly clear that the civil nature of the\nSVP scheme “cannot be altered based merely on the vagaries\nin  implementation  of  the  authorizing  statute.”  Id.  at  263.\nAccordingly, we find that the civil nature of California’s SVP\n13Seling did not, however, alter our authority to consider implementa-\ntion of the SVP Act on Plaintiffs’ other claims. See Seling, 531 U.S. at 266\n(“This case gives us no occasion to consider how the civil nature of a con-\nfinement scheme relates to other constitutional challenges, such as due\nprocess, or to consider the extent to which a court may look to actual con-\nditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to determine in\nthe first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature.”). \n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5949\nAct  is  not  altered  because  of  the  remedy  sought  and  we\nreverse the district court’s order denying Defendants’ motion\nto  dismiss  as  to  the  Ex  Post  Facto  and  Double  Jeopardy\nClause related claims. \n4.  Plaintiffs’  Eighth  and  Fourteenth  Amendment\nClaims \n[18] Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the “restrictive\nand denigrating conditions” at the Atascadero State Hospital\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the\nEighth Amendment. The Eighth Amendment has, as an essen-\ntial prerequisite, the right to punish. DeShaney v. Winnebago\nCounty Dept. of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199 n.6 (“The\nState does not acquire the power to punish with which the\nEighth Amendment is concerned until after it has secured a\nformal adjudication of guilt in accordance with due process of\nlaw.”). Here, SVPs are detained for the purpose of treatment,\nand the state’s power to punish them expires at the end of\ntheir sentence. Accordingly, the Eighth Amendment is not the\nproper vehicle to challenge the conditions of civil commit-\nment. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n.16 (1979). \n[19] The thrust of Plaintiffs’ claim here is that because the\nconditions of confinement amount to punishment, they should\nbe  permitted  to  argue  that  this  “punishment”  is  cruel  and\nunusual. Once again, this “punitive as applied” argument is\nforeclosed by Seling. Therefore, we find that the district court\nerred when it failed to dismiss the Eighth Amendment claim\nagainst Defendants. \nOf course, this is a small victory for Defendants, because\nthe same claims for inhumane treatment and failure to protect\nmay be raised under the Fourteenth Amendment. The stan-\ndard applicable to SVPs under the Fourteenth Amendment are\nat least coextensive with that applicable to prisoners under the\nEighth  Amendment.  See,  e.g.,  Munoz  v.  Kolender,  208  F.\nSupp. 2d 1125 (S.D. Cal. 2002) (applying Fourteenth Amend-\n\n5950 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nment standards to SVPs because “comparable standards apply\nto both prisoners’ Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual pun-\nishment and Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process\nanalyses,  with  Fourteenth  Amendment  analysis  borrowing\nfrom Eighth Amendment standards.”); Frost v. Agnos, 152\nF.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir. 1998) (applying Eighth Amendment\nstandards to evaluate pretrial detainees’ Fourteenth Amend-\nment claims). Moreover, the Eighth Amendment provides too\nlittle protection for those whom the state cannot punish. See\nJones  v.  Blanas,  393  F.3d  918,  931-34  (9th  Cir.  2004);\nAndrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052 (8th Cir. 2001). Plaintiffs\napparently recognize this, because their Eighth Amendment\nclaims largely duplicate those raised under the substantive due\nprocess clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly,\nwe consider, below, under the Fourteenth Amendment Plain-\ntiffs’ allegations that Defendants’ actions violate their due\nprocess rights. \n5.  Plaintiffs’ Procedural Due Process Rights Under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment \nPlaintiffs raise a number of procedural due process viola-\ntions  against  Defendants.  Plaintiffs  allege  that  Defendants\nforce them to participate in the five-phase treatment program\nat  Atascadero;  force  them  to  take  medication  in  non-\nemergency situations; and subject them to privilege reduc-\ntions, access level reductions, and reclassifications. Plaintiffs\nallege that these deprivations occur without adequate notice of\nor opportunity to respond to accusations of alleged sanction-\nable conduct. \n[20] The Fourteenth Amendment requires that no person be\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of\nlaw. That is, even if Defendants may deprive SVPs of certain\nprivileges, those deprivations may not be carried out without\nnotice and an opportunity to be heard. Defendants do not\nchallenge, at least at this stage, that Plaintiffs were deprived\nof certain privileges, or that these deprivations did not carry\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5951\nwith them the attendant due process required under the Four-\nteenth Amendment. Rather, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\nhave not adequately pleaded the loss of an established liberty\nor  property  interest  when  they  are  force-medicated,  when\ntheir access-levels are reduced, or when they lose other privi-\nleges. \n[21] We disagree. Convicted prisoners, pretrial detainees,\nand  parolees  all  possess  a  liberty  interest  in  avoiding  the\nunwanted administrations of antipsychotic drugs. See, e.g.,\nWashington v. Harper, 494 U.S. at 221-22 (holding that pris-\noners possess “a significant liberty interest in avoiding the\nunwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs under the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment” and identify-\ning procedures which comported with due process). Thus, at\na minimum, an individual civilly committed under Califor-\nnia’s SVP Act has a right to procedural due process before\nbeing force-medicated in non-emergency situations. \nNext, Plaintiffs allege that reduction of their access levels\ndecreases,  or  in  some  cases  eliminates,  the  opportunity  to\nmove around the facility without escorts and that it affects\ntheir  right  to  other  privileges.  The  reduction  of  an  SVP’s\naccess level is similar to the transfer of prisoners from the\ngeneral prison population to administrative segregation. Such\na transfer may deprive the prisoner of a state-created liberty\ninterest. See Sandin v. Connor, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995)\n(holding that a state-created liberty interest in one’s classifica-\ntion may exist where classification imposes “atypical and sig-\nnificant hardship”); see also Barnett v. Centoni, 31 F.3d 813,\n815-16  (9th  Cir.  1994)  (holding  that  a  prison  inmate  was\ndeprived of liberty and property because he was reclassified\nthereby losing certain privileges). Thus, Plaintiffs may have\na liberty interest in their access levels and classifications that\naffect their privileges. \n[22] In sum, it is clearly established that an inmate has a\nstate-created liberty interest and a right to be free from restric-\n\n5952 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\ntions that “impose[ ] atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 483-84. Where Defendants have trans-\ngressed a line clearly established even in the prison context,\nwe have no trouble deeming the line clearly established for\nSVPs. Therefore, we hold that Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Amend-\nment  Procedural  Due  Process  claims  are  based  on  clearly\nestablished rights.\n6.  Plaintiffs’  Fourteenth  Amendment  Substantive\nDue Process Claims \nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants have violated their sub-\nstantive due process rights because Defendants have failed to\nprotect them from the abuse of other detainees and employ-\nees. Their claims can be broken down into three general cate-\ngories: (a) claims that Defendants failed to protect Plaintiffs\nfrom the abuses of other persons detained at Atascadero; (b)\nclaims that Defendants failed to provide constitutionally ade-\nquate conditions of detention; and (c) claims that Defendants\nuse excessive force against them.14 \nFirst, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants have turned a blind\neye to the conduct of other persons detained at Atascadero\nState  Hospital.  Specifically,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  they  are\nintentionally exposed to feces, urine, vomit, spit, and blood in\nAtascadero’s courtyards, bathrooms, hallways, dining rooms,\nand gymnasium, and that other detainees contaminate their\nfood with spit and other unsanitary taint. Plaintiffs allege that\nthey are subjected to verbal harassment, physical abuse, and\nsexual assaults by other patients at the Hospital, and indeed\nthat they are targeted because they are sex offenders. \nThe patient population at Atascadero State Hospital com-\n14Here we consider Plaintiffs’ substantive due process allegations from\ntheir Second Alleged Claim, their Fifth Alleged Claim and their Seventh\nAlleged Claim. \n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5953\nprises males who are civilly or penally committed. The indi-\nviduals committed at the Hospital are confined under a variety\nof statutes. See Cal. Penal Code § 1026 (covering patients\n“not guilty by reason of insanity”); Cal. Penal Code § 1370\n(covering patients “incompetent to stand trial”); Cal. Penal\nCode §§ 2962, 2964 (covering “mentally disordered offend-\ners” serving their parole time); Cal. Welfare and Institutions\nCode § 6316 (covering “mentally disordered sex offenders”);\nCal. Penal Code § 2684 (covering mentally ill prisoners trans-\nferred to Atascadero State Hospital for psychiatric stabiliza-\ntion).  According  to  Plaintiffs,  their  forced  integration  as\nopenly  labeled  “sexually  violent  predators”  has  subjected\nthem to verbal harassment, physical abuse, and sexual assaults\nfrom the rest of the Atascadero population. \n[23] Plaintiffs’ right to be protected and confined in a safe\ninstitution are clearly established. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at\n319-22 (stating that individuals who are involuntarily civilly\ncommitted  have  constitutionally  protected  rights  under  the\nDue Process Clause to reasonably safe conditions of confine-\nment and freedom from unreasonable bodily restraints). The\nright is clearly established for civilly committed persons and\nprisoners alike. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833\n(1994) (“[P]rison officials have a duty . . . to protect prisoners\nfrom violence at the hands of other prisoners.” (internal cita-\ntions omitted)); Neely v. Feinstein, 50 F.3d 1502, 1508 (9th\nCir. 1995) (finding “clearly established” that patients have a\n“constitutional  right  to  be  safe  in  the  state  institutions  to\nwhich they are committed”). Assuming Plaintiffs can prove\nthe allegations in their complaint and Defendants’ blindness\nto such conditions in Atascadero, qualified immunity would\nnot be appropriate on these claims. \n[24] Second, Plaintiffs allege that the conditions of confine-\nment are constitutionally inadequate, that they are forced to\nlive in squalid conditions that are inhumane and pose a seri-\nous health risk. Plaintiffs have a clearly established right not\nto be exposed to such unsanitary conditions. See Anderson v.\n\n5954 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nCounty of Kern, 45 F.3d 1310, 1314-15 (9th Cir. 1995) (col-\nlecting cases in prison context); Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-\n16 (establishing a right to “personal security” for involuntarily\ncommitted  persons).15  Given  the  allegations  in  the  Second\nAmended Complaint, Plaintiffs’ claims as to the unsanitary\nand unsafe conditions of confinement cannot be dismissed\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). \n[25] Plaintiffs also allege several claims of excessive force,\ni.e., that (a) “red light alarms” are used when Plaintiffs orally\nrefuse to participate in treatment, even if they pose no threat\nof physical violence; (b) that shackles are used during trans-\nportation and during visits with family and friends; and, more\ngenerally, (c) that Plaintiffs are subjected to “excessive pun-\nishment  .  .  .  [and]  excessive  use  of  force  and  physical\nrestraints.” It is well-established that detained persons have a\nright to be free from excessive force. While excessive force\nclaims by prisoners are reviewed under the Eighth Amend-\nment’s malicious and sadistic standard, Hudson v. McMillian,\n503 U.S. 1 (1992), the more generous Fourteenth Amendment\nstandard applies to those who are civilly confined. As we pre-\nviously stated:\nIf confinement of a sexually violent predator is civil\nfor  the  purposes  of  evaluation  under  the  Ex  Post\nFacto clause, that confinement is civil for the pur-\nposes of defining the rights to which the detainee is\nentitled while confined [in a treatment facility]. Civil\nstatus  means  civil  status,  with  all  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment rights that accompany it. \nJones, 393 F.3d at 933. \n15In the prison context, claims of unsanitary conditions are evaluated\nunder the Eighth Amendment. See Anderson, 45 F.3d at 1314. Although\nthe Eighth Amendment does not apply here, similar standards may apply\nto SVPs under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Munoz v. Kolender, 208\nF. Supp. 2d 1125, 1146 (S.D. Cal. 2002). \n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5955\nThe Fourteenth Amendment requires that civilly committed\npersons not be subjected to conditions that amount to punish-\nment, Bell, 441 U.S. at 536, within the bounds of professional\ndiscretion,  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  321-22.  Moreover,  the\n“due process requires that the conditions and duration of con-\nfinement [for civilly confined SVPs] bear some reasonable\nrelation to the purpose for which persons are committed.” Sel-\ning, 531 U.S. at 265; see also Jones, 393 F.3d at 931. While\nthe nature of an SVP’s confinement may factor in this balance\nof what is reasonable, it is clearly established that the substan-\ntive due process protections of the Fourteenth Amendment\napply to SVPs. See Andrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052, 1061\n(8th Cir. 2001) (applying the Fourteenth Amendment’s “ob-\njective  reasonableness”  standard  to  excessive  force  claims\nbrought by civilly committed SVPs).16 \n[26] We also reiterate that SVPs must, at a minimum, be\nafforded  the  rights  afforded  prisoners  confined  in  a  penal\ninstitution. Thus, the Eighth Amendment still provides a floor\nfor the level of protection that SVPs must receive under the\nFourteenth  Amendment,  and  because  the  contours  of  the\nEighth  Amendment  are  more  defined,  Eighth  Amendment\njurisprudence may provide helpful guidance as to the stan-\ndards to be applied. Under the Eighth Amendment, the unnec-\nessary  and  wanton  force  standard  takes  into  account  such\nfacts as the need for the application of force, the relationship\nbetween the need and the amount of force used, the threat per-\nceived by the officer, any effort to temper the severity of the\nforceful response, and the extent of the injury inflicted, and\nwhether the force was applied for a legitimate purpose. Hud-\n16While Jones, Neer, and Seling are more recent cases, they do little\nmore than restate the contours of law clearly established in Youngberg v.\nRomeo, a 1982 case, and Bell v. Wolfish, a 1979 case. Seling essentially\nrestates the Youngberg test, and Jones does little more than connect the\nline between Youngberg and SVPs based on California’s argument that the\nstatute should be construed as a civil confinement statute. We believe a\nreasonable official reading Youngberg would have sufficient notice that\nthey would be held to Youngberg’s standards of due process. \n\n5956 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 7 (1992). If Plaintiffs allege\nconduct that sinks below those protections afforded prisoners\nunder the Eighth Amendment, then their claim certainly states\na violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n[27] Plaintiffs have alleged that force is used in retaliation\nfor exercising legitimate rights and that the amount of force\nused is often a gross overreaction to the situation. Such use of\nforce, if proved, is not reasonable and failure to curtail such\nabuses cannot be said to be within Defendants’ professional\ndiscretion. We affirm, then, the district court’s denial of the\nmotion to dismiss on these grounds. \nOn each of these three grounds — failure to protect, inade-\nquate conditions of confinement, and excessive force — we\nbelieve that Plaintiffs may be able to state a “clearly estab-\nlished” Fourteenth Amendment Substantive Due Process vio-\nlation, and we cannot, at the Federal Rule 12(b)(6) stage,\ndismiss these substantive due process claims. \n7.  Plaintiffs’  Equal  Protection  Rights  Under  the\nFourteenth Amendment \nAccording to Plaintiffs, they are being treated more restric-\ntively than other civilly committed patients. They allege that\ntheir conditions are more punitive than those under which all\nother civilly committed persons are held. For one example,\nthey allege that other civilly-committed persons are given pri-\nority in hiring for remunerative positions. \n[28]  Even  though  Plaintiffs  do  not  constitute  a  suspect\nclass, heightened scrutiny may be required where fundamental\ninterests are at issue. See Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections,\n383 U.S. 663, 670 (1966); Police Dept of City of Chicago v.\nMosley, 408 U.S. 92 (1972). This court upheld application of\na “heightened scrutiny standard” when evaluating an equal\nprotection violation under Washington State’s Sexually Vio-\nlent Predator Statute. See Young v. Weston, 176 F.3d 1196,\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5957\n1201 (9th Cir. 1999), rev’d on other grounds, Seling, 531 U.S.\n250. While Young was decided in 1999, it rested on a firmly\nestablished  principle  in  existence  at  the  time  of  events  in\nquestion: that heightened scrutiny will be applied where a\nfundamental liberty interest is at stake. See Skinner v. Okla-\nhoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942). Plaintiffs may be able to\nclaim violations of several clearly established fundamental\nrights: a liberty interest in freedom from bodily restraint and\npersonal security, Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-316, and a fun-\ndamental  right  to  access  the  courts,  as  described  below.\nAccordingly, we agree with Plaintiffs that heightened scrutiny\nis the standard for equal protection claims implicating these\nfundamental rights. And we further observe that Plaintiffs, in\nline with their allegations, may be able to show that the differ-\nential treatment between them and other civilly committed\npersons violates equal protection because such treatment does\nnot meet heightened scrutiny. \n[29] At the same time, we cannot say that it is firmly estab-\nlished that every condition of an SVP’s confinement is subject\nto heightened scrutiny. In the prison setting, we have made\nclear that prison officials need latitude in deciding how to run\ntheir prison, and we have refused to subject each classification\ndrawn by prison officials to heightened scrutiny. Rather, a\nprisoner cannot challenge the conditions of his confinement\non equal protection grounds unless the discrimination against\nhim is irrational or arbitrary. See McGinnis v. Royster, 410\nU.S. 263, 276 (1973). That is, in so far as Plaintiffs’ claims\nrely on classifications not related to fundamental liberty inter-\nests, Defendants will have qualified immunity unless there is\nno rational basis for the classification. \n[30] Even under the rational basis standard, we cannot dis-\nmiss Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims at this stage. Plain-\ntiffs’ pleadings raise several questionable classifications. For\nexample, it seems arbitrary that SVPs should be treated more\nharshly that other civilly committed persons in job placement\nand privileges. Based on the pleadings, we believe that Plain-\n\n5958 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\ntiffs may be able to prove a violation of clearly established\nlaw congruent with the facts alleged. Admittedly, at this stage,\nDefendants have not fully developed and presented the ratio-\nnale for their actions and there may be differences between\nSVPs and other civilly committed persons that warrant differ-\nential treatment. But we leave it to the district court, on a\nmore full factual record, to consider whether the classifica-\ntions Plaintiffs present are irrational and arbitrary.\n8.  Plaintiffs’  Sixth  Amendment  Right  to  Counsel\nand Fourteenth Amendment Right of Access to\nCourts \nPlaintiffs claim that they cannot privately correspond with\ncounsel, have telephone conversations with counsel, and are\notherwise hindered in their ability to prepare for their proba-\nble cause and commitment hearings. According to Plaintiffs,\n“[t]his  inability  to  prepare  for  upcoming  hearings  would\nclearly hinder Plaintiffs’ access to the courts and counsel.” \n[31] Plaintiffs have a statutory right to counsel in probable\ncause proceedings and in commitment hearings. Cal. Welfare\n& Institutions Code §§ 6602, 6603, 6605(d). To protect the\nright to counsel, “a [detainee] must be given a reasonable\nopportunity to employ and consult with counsel; otherwise,\nthe right to be heard by counsel would be of little worth.”\nChandler v. Fretag, 348 U.S. 3, 10 (1954). While the Sixth\nAmendment, by its express language, protects those in crimi-\nnal  proceedings,  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  protects  all\ndetainees against governmental interference in their right of\naccess to courts. See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396,\n419-20 (1974) (overruled on other grounds); Cornett v. Dono-\nvan, 51 F.3d 894, 897 & n.4 (9th Cir. 1995). The right of\naccess to courts has been found to encompass the right to talk\nin person and on the telephone with counsel in confidential\nsettings, Procunier, 416 U.S. at 419; Ching v. Lewis, 895 F.2d\n608, 609 (9th Cir. 1990), and to use available law library\nresources, Kennan v. Hall, 3 F.3d 1083 (1996), subject to\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5959\nlegitimate  restrictions  related  to  the  purpose  and  circum-\nstances of detention. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89\n(1987). Where such rights have been upheld in the prison con-\ntext, there is no question that SVPs must be afforded rights\nthat are at least as broad. \n[32] Such a fact specific inquiry can hardly be undertaken\nat this point, when it is not clear what Defendants have done\nto impede access to the courts, or why they have done so, or\nhow the Defendants’ actions have affected Plaintiffs’ right of\naccess. We believe, nonetheless, that Plaintiffs may be able to\nstate a violation of clearly established law congruent with\ntheir allegations and we affirm the district court’s order deny-\ning Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss as to Plain-\ntiffs’ Tenth claim based on access to courts.\n9.  Plaintiffs’ Right to Privacy under the Fourteenth\nAmendment \n[33] Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ policies do not allow\nfor privacy when showering, sleeping, using the toilets or par-\nticipating in therapy sessions. It is clearly established that the\nFourteenth Amendment protects a sphere of privacy, and the\nmost “basic subject of privacy . . . the naked body.” Grummett\nv. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 494 (9th Cir. 1985). While the cir-\ncumstances of institutional life demand that privacy be lim-\nited,  it  is  clearly  established  that  gratuitous  invasions  of\nprivacy violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. Once again,\nwe reach a highly factual inquiry where the facts are not fully\ndeveloped: in Grummett, for example, we considered the gen-\nder of those prison officials who viewed inmates, the angle\nand duration of viewing, and the steps the prison had taken to\nminimize invasions of privacy. Id. at 494-95. Such facts are\nsimply not available to us at this stage of proceedings.17 We\n17Moreover, we note that it is not, as Defendants hinted in their briefs\nto this court, the burden of the SVPs to show that there is no compelling\njustification for the regulations, but rather the burden of the State to show\nthat there is such a justification. See Walker v. Sumner, 917 F.2d 382, 385-\n87 (9th Cir. 1990). \n\n5960 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nbelieve, nonetheless, that Plaintiffs may possibly be able to\nstate a violation of clearly established law congruent with\ntheir allegations, and as such we will not dismiss their claim\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). \n***\nIn sum, we affirm the district court’s decision to deny qual-\nified  immunity  on  Plaintiffs’  first,  second,  sixth,  seventh,\neighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action to the extent noted\nabove. We reverse and hold that Defendants have qualified\nimmunity from suit on Plaintiffs’ Ex Post Facto, Double Jeop-\nardy, and Eighth Amendment claims. \nF.  Defendants’ Belief That Their Conduct Was Lawful\nWas Not Objectively Reasonable \n[34] Even if Plaintiffs have alleged violations of a clearly\nestablished right, a government official is entitled to qualified\nimmunity if he or she “could . . . have reasonably but mis-\ntakenly believed that his or her conduct did not violate a\nclearly established constitutional right.” Jackson v. City of\nBremerton, 268 F.3d 646, 651 (9th Cir. 2001); see also Alford\nv. Haner, 333 F.3d 972, 977 (9th Cir. 2003). This is a limited\nexception,  however:  if  the  law  is  clearly  established,  the\nimmunity defense “ordinarily should fail, since a reasonably\ncompetent public official should know the law governing [the\nofficial’s] conduct.” Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-\n19 (1982). \n[35] Whether Defendants’ conduct was reasonable involves\na factual analysis of the circumstances surrounding Defen-\ndants’ actions and a determination of whether a reasonable\nofficial similarly situated would have been aware that his/her\nactions violated the law, an inquiry difficult to conduct at this\nstage. Based on the facts in front of us, however, we do not\nbelieve Defendants can claim that their conduct was objec-\ntively reasonable. Again, Defendants argue that the volatile\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5961\nnature of the law surrounding SVPs entitles them to escape\nliability entirely. We do not adhere to the theory that “every\ndog is entitled to one bite.” Defendants could not have been\nso  completely  in  the  dark  about  the  standards  that  would\napply to their conduct as it related to SVPs. As explained\nabove, SVPs are not entirely dissimilar from other groups of\ncivilly  committed  persons.  Moreover,  Plaintiffs’  complaint\nalleges practices that would be unconstitutional if directed at\nany prisoner. Accordingly, Defendants cannot escape liability\nbased on a “reasonable but mistaken” belief about the consti-\ntutionality of their conduct. \nCONCLUSION\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  AFFIRM  in  part  and\nREVERSE in part the district court’s order denying Defen-\ndants’ second motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Each\nside to bear its own costs. \nTROTT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart: \nMy  disagreement  with  my  colleagues  is  limited  to  one\nissue. We agree that plaintiffs cannot seek damages in this\nlawsuit against state officials in their official capacities, and\nthat plaintiffs cannot seek damages from the State either. So,\nwhat  is  left  where  the  officials  are  concerned?  A  lawsuit\nagainst  them  for  acts  and  omissions  alleged  to  have  been\ntaken in the discharge of their official duties, but as individu-\nals, not officials. It is here that I part company. \nOn this record, and under these circumstances, I conclude,\nwith all respect to my colleagues, that these officials as indi-\nviduals are clearly entitled to qualified immunity against both\nsuit and damages — now, not later. In my view, the particu-\nlars and the contours of the alleged constitutional rights upon\n\n5962 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nwhich the plaintiffs rely were not so clearly established at the\ntimes under scrutiny and at the level of specificity required\nsuch that a reasonable official hired by the state to cope with\nlawfully confined sexually violent predators subject to reme-\ndial treatment would have been aware that the conduct alleged\nviolated constitutional bounds. Given the unsettled nature of\nthe law in this area, a reasonable official could certainly have\nbelieved otherwise. \nWe decide this appeal with clear analytical guidance from\nthe Supreme Court: \nSomewhat more concretely, whether an official pro-\ntected by qualified immunity may be held personally\nliable for an allegedly unlawful official action gener-\nally turns on the “objective legal reasonableness” of\nthe action, assessed in light of the legal rules that\nwere “clearly established” at the time it was taken.\n  The operation of this standard, however, depends\nsubstantially upon the level of generality at which\nthe  relevant  “legal  rule”  is  to  be  identified.  For\nexample, the right to due process of law is quite\nclearly established by the Due Process Clause, and\nthus there is a sense in which any action that violates\nthat Clause (no matter how unclear it may be that the\nparticular  action  is  a  violation)  violates  a  clearly\nestablished right. Much the same could be said of\nany other constitutional or statutory violation. But if\nthe  test  of  “clearly  established  law”  were  to  be\napplied at this level of generality, it would bear no\nrelationship to the “objective legal reasonableness”\nthat is the touchstone of Harlow. Plaintiffs would be\nable to convert the rule of qualified immunity that\nour cases plainly establish into a rule of virtually\nunqualified liability simply by alleging violation of\nextremely abstract rights. Harlow would be trans-\nformed from a guarantee of immunity into a rule of\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5963\npleading. Such an approach, in sum, would destroy\n“the balance that our cases strike between the inter-\nests in vindication of citizens’ constitutional rights\nand in public officials’ effective performance of their\nduties,” by making it impossible for officials “rea-\nsonably [to] anticipate when their conduct may give\nrise to liability for damages.” It should not be sur-\nprising, therefore, that our cases establish that the\nright the official is alleged to have violated must\nhave been “clearly established” in a more particu-\nlarized, and hence more relevant, sense: The con-\ntours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a\nreasonable official would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that right. This is not to say that an\nofficial  action  is  protected  by  qualified  immunity\nunless  the  very  action  in  question  has  previously\nbeen held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light\nof pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be appar-\nent. \nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40 (1987) (empha-\nsis added) (alteration in original) (internal citations omitted).\nAs my colleagues acknowledge, “this suit is unique, in that\nit is one of the first widespread class actions to challenge the\nconditions of detention for civilly confined SVPs.” It is not\nonly  unique,  but  it  requires  us  to  answer  questions  never\nbefore squarely addressed in this context. This factor alone\nshould be enough to entitle these individual defendants to dis-\nmissal. \nMy colleagues hang their analytical hat on Youngberg v.\nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 322 (1982) for the proposition that\n“civilly detained persons must be afforded ‘more considerate\ntreatment and conditions of confinement than criminals whose\nconditions of confinement are designed to punish.’ ” This is\na nice general quote mined out of context from that case, but\nit gets us nowhere in pursuit of an answer to the central ques-\n\n5964 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\ntion of whether we have in this lawsuit violations of clearly\nestablished rights. Why? Because Youngberg dealt with the\nconfinement for their own good of mentally defective per-\nsons. In contrast, and as recently recognized by the Supreme\nCourt, sexually violent predators are confined in order to pro-\ntect “the public from dangerous individuals with treatable as\nwell as untreatable conditions.” Seling v. Young, 531 U.S.\n250, 262 (2001). In addition, the Court said that the case\nbefore it for decision “gives us no occasion to consider how\nthe civil nature of a confinement scheme relates to other chal-\nlenges, such as due process . . . .” Id. at 266. It is little won-\nder, therefore, that my colleagues admit in connection with\nYoungberg that “it is not always clearly established how much\nmore expansive the right of civilly detained persons are than\nthose of criminally detained persons.” I disagree with my col-\nleagues’ claim that “it follows logically [from Youngberg],\nthen, that the rights afforded prisoners set a floor for those\n[rights] that must be afforded SVPs, and that where Defen-\ndants  violate  a  standard  that  is  clearly  established  in  the\nprison context, the violation is clearly established under the\nSVP scheme.” Where does this come from? It sounds new to\nme. Certainly it is not a proposition clearly established and\ncontrolling at the time relevant to this lawsuit. Prisoners have\nconstitutional rights flowing from certain constitutional guar-\nantees that do not apply out of the criminal context. Which\nclearly established “prisoner rights” are they talking about? I\ncannot find my colleagues’ bold assertion anywhere in any\ncase before this one. Where is the required level of specificity\nrequired to hold these individuals constitutionally and mone-\ntarily responsible for their acts? It is nowhere to be found.\nWhere is the fair warning to them as to the constitutional lim-\nits of their compulsory treatment programs? Expanding and\nextending some rights from other contexts and extrapolating\nothers defies the purpose of the doctrine of qualified immu-\nnity. \nThe courts have yet to clarify how the Constitution protects\nsexually  violent  predators  from  various  confinement  and\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5965\ntreatment modalities. Context is critical to the determination\nof whether a constitutional right has been established. This\nprinciple was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Washington\nv. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990), a lawsuit filed by a mentally\nill  state  prisoner  complaining  against  treatment  with  anti-\npsychotic drugs against his will and without a judicial hear-\ning. In holding that such treatment did not violate either sub-\nstantive or procedural due process, the Court said, “The extent\nof a prisoner’s right under the Clause to avoid the unwanted\nadministration of antipsychotic drugs must be defined in the\ncontext of the inmate’s confinement.” Id. at 222. \nWe read the same message in Parham v. J.R., 422 U.S.\n584, 608 (1979): “What process is constitutionally due cannot\nbe divorced from the nature of the ultimate decision that is\nbeing made.” See also Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471,\n481 (1972) (“[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such pro-\ncedural protections as the particular situation demands.”). \nNoteworthy in Washington v. Harper was a holding by the\nWashington  Supreme  Court  that  the  individual  defendants\nwere entitled to qualified immunity, 494 U.S. at 218 n.5. The\ncase was allowed to proceed, but only to consider claims for\ninjunctive and declaratory relief under § 1983 as well as state\nlaw — which is precisely what should happen here. It seems\nthat we are now requiring doctors and other staff to consult\nnot just with lawyers before they devise a procedure or treat-\nment for a sexually violent predator, but with the courts. \nThe Supreme Court warned against this result in Parham,\nsaying, “Due process has never been thought to require that\nthe neutral and detached trier of fact be law trained or a judi-\ncial or administrative officer. Surely, this is the case as to\nmedical decision, for neither judges nor administrative hear-\ning officers are better qualified than psychiatrists to render\npsychiatric judgements. . . . The mode and procedure of medi-\ncal diagnostic procedures is not the business of judges.” Id. at\n607-08 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \n\n5966 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nThe penalty for not anticipating a court ruling will be indi-\nvidual liability. This unfortunate situation is precisely what\nthe doctrine of qualified immunity is designed to avoid. \nI take issue also with my colleagues’ assertion that because\nthe facts are not yet developed, it is too early in this lawsuit\nto dismiss on qualified immunity. This claim misses the mark.\nAs held repeatedly by the Supreme Court, qualified immunity\nis immunity from being sued, not just from damages. This\nprinciple  explains  (1)  why  the  Court  warned  in  Anderson\nagainst non-specific pleadings that allege violations of “ex-\ntremely abstract rights,” 483 U.S. at 639; and (2) the Court’s\nholding in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985) that,\n“[u]nless the plaintiff’s allegations state a claim of violation\nof  clearly  established  law,  a  defendant  pleading  qualified\nimmunity is entitled to dismissal before the commencement of\ndiscovery.” The Court revisited this issue again in Behrens v.\nPelletier, 516 U.S. 299 (1996). In the course of overruling a\nmistaken opinion by the First Circuit, the Court said, \nThe source of the First Circuit’s confusion was its\nmistaken  conception  of  the  scope  of  protection\nafforded by qualified immunity. Harlow and Mitch-\nell make clear that the defense is meant to give gov-\nernment  officials  a  right,  not  merely  to  avoid\n“standing  trial,”  but  also  to  avoid  the  burdens  of\n“such  pretrial  matters  as  discovery  .  .  .  ,  as\n‘[i]nquiries of this kind can be peculiarly disruptive\nof effective government.’ ” \nId. at 308 (quoting Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 526 (quoting Harlow\nv. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 817 (1982))) (alterations in origi-\nnal). The Court, in reversing us in 1991 on this very issue,\nsaid, “[W]e repeatedly have stressed the importance of resolv-\ning immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litiga-\ntion.” Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991). \nFinally, my colleagues express their caution “not to evis-\ncerate the notice pleading standard” that the system generally\n\nHYDRICK v. HUNTER 5967\nuses to commence a lawsuit. I do not believe this caution is\nwell suited to this context. Again, I reiterate that the question\nof qualified immunity requires prompt resolution. Anderson\nwould seem to require pleadings more specific than the usual\n“notice” standard. At the very least, pleadings against state\nofficials in their individual capacities must demonstrate an\nalleged  violation  of  a  particularized  and  relevant  constitu-\ntional right which has been clearly established. Hunter v. Bry-\nant also would seem to so require. To hold otherwise is to\ndisserve a doctrine that calls for resolution at the “earliest pos-\nsible stage” in litigation. Id. at 227. \nThe question remains, how specific must the right allegedly\nviolated be defined in order to answer the question whether it\nwas  clearly  established?  Wilson  v.  Layne,  526  U.S.  603\n(1999) gives us a good example of the degree of specificity\nrequired. In Wilson, the Court concluded first that officers\nwho took members of the media into a homeowner’s home to\nobserve and to record the execution of an arrest warrant did\nso in clear violation of the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless,\nthe Court concluded also that the officials who did so were\nentitled to qualified immunity. The Court said that the appro-\npriate question “is . . . whether a reasonable officer could have\nbelieved that bringing members of the media into a home dur-\ning the execution of an arrest warrant was lawful . . . .” Id. at\n615. Concluding that at the time of the violation the law was\n“at best undeveloped,” the Court said, “Given such an unde-\nveloped state of the law, the officers in this case cannot have\nbeen ‘expected to predict the future course of constitutional\nlaw.’ ” Id. at 617 (quoting Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U.S.\n555, 562 (1978)). \nFrom these precedents, I conclude that the proper question\nin this case is whether it was clearly established at the time\nof the events in this case that the Constitution prohibited these\nindividual officials from engaging in any of the actionable\nbehaviors attributed to them in connection with the manage-\nment and treatment of sexually violent predators civilly con-\n\n5968 HYDRICK v. HUNTER\nfined under state law for treatment and for the protection of\nthe public. After reviewing all the relevant cases and authori-\nties, I answer this question in the negative. \nViewed in this light the analytical error made by my col-\nleagues becomes quite apparent when they say, \nThus, there are two bodies of law from which we\nmight draw “clearly established” law for qualified\nimmunity purposes: first, where the SVPs claim a\nviolation of a right that is clearly established even in\nthe  prison  context,  and  second,  where  the  SVPs\nclaim a violation of a right that is clearly established\nfor all civilly detained persons. \nWhat this acknowledges is that we cannot find any clearly\nestablished substantive rights in the SVP context, so we have\nto borrow them from other areas, such as prison rights and the\nrights of persons civilly detained for their own good and who\npose a demonstrated threat to society. An approach like this\ncertainly works well when the question is what constitutional\nrights might these sexually violent predators have in this sys-\ntem, but it fails utterly when the issue is whether we hold\nindividuals liable ex post facto for their actions. \nThis lawsuit should proceed so that specific answers can be\nfound to the constitutional questions raised by the plaintiffs,\nbut it should proceed only in connection with possible declar-\natory or injunctive relief. To do otherwise will deter govern-\nment officials in the future from doing anything not to the\nliking of a sexually violent predator. The penalty for making\na good faith mistake in an area of undeveloped law may be\nthe costs of a lawsuit and the potential personal liability aris-\ning out of the official performance of a state job.",

In 2000 the California Sexually Violent Predator Act\n(SVPA) had been in force only four years. Other states' similar statutes had been in\nplace 0nly 10 years. That is a very brief period in federal jurisprudential\ndevelopment.\nSince 2000 the Supreme Court, Circuit Courts and California Courts, have\nissued numerous opinions defining standards for the conditions of SVP confinement\nand delineating the constitutional analytical framework for SVP claims.\nAppellees claim that the \"law of the case\" doctrine defeats all of Appellants'\nassertions in the Motion to Dismiss Appellees' Second Amended Complaint\n(Motion). However, law of the case is not created by a motion's summary denial.\neven if law of the case were applicable Appellants fall within two exceptions to the\nrule-manifest injustice and changes in the law.\nIn franking the issues in their Answer Appellees seem to ignore a basic premise\nunderlying Appellants' appeal of the District Court order of August 26, 2003\nsummarily denying Appellants' Motion - that Appellants are entitled to qualified\nimmunity on causes of action based on law that does not apply to the civilly\n1\n\nconvnitted. Simply put, Appellants posit that state officials cmmot be held liable in\ntheir individual capacities for alleged violations of constitutional clauses not\napplicable to persons over whom they have custodial responsibility.\nFor the causes of action that may apply to the civilly conmaitted, Appellees'\nignore the specific nature of the sexually violent predator commitment statutes and\nstatus. For example, Appellees state unequivocally that corranitted persons have a\nconstitutional right to be free from involuntary medication. Answer p. 48. That is\nincorrect as a matter of law. Rather, as discussed in Appellants' Opening Brief and\nbelow, committed persons can be constitutionally involtintarily medicated in\ncircumstances applicable to the SVP.\nMany of Appellees other claims are improperly pled consisting only of\nconclusory allegations with no factual support. The SAC contains no specific\nallegations tied to one individual's acts.\n' The involuntary medication of SVPs is a particularly unsettled issue in\nCalifornia. The California Supreme Court has remanded a case addressing that\nissue back to the California Court of Appeal on three occasions. (In re\nCalhoun, 112 Cal.App.4th 1262 [6 Cal Rptr.3d 34][ B159949 (S094596)] (2003)\n(vacated and remanded subsequent to filing of Appellants' Opening Brief by 85\nP.3d 2 (Cal. 2004).) The Court of Appeal, in a published decision held that the\ninvoluntary medication of SVPs was permitted under the commitment statute. See\nfootnote 2. However, that decision was vacated and the case remanded for\nreconsideration in light of In re Qawi, 32 Cal.4th 1 (2004). The matter's legal\nissues are currently being briefed in the California Court of Appeal, Second\nAppellate District, Division Six. ._\n\nA. Clarification of Points and Issues.\nAppellees state that Appellants filed the Motion on February 25, 2003 and the\nDistrict Court summarily denied the Motion on August 26, 2003 making it appear as\nthough the Court reviewed Appellants' Motion for 6 months. Appellees fail to\nmention that their Opposition to the Motion was filed on July 25, 2003 and the order\nallowing the brief exceeding page limits was entered on July 31, 2003.\nAppellees assert that Appellants' Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended\nComp/aint (SAC) reasserts the \"exact same arguments that were advanced and\nrejected by the district court in the First Motion to Dismiss.\" (Answer p. 11.) That\nassertion is factually inaccurate. Appellants grounds for dismissal are similar in\nsome, but not all instailces. Furthermore, as a review of the'Motion makes clear,\nmany of Appellants' arguments are based on decisions handed down by the Supreme\nCourt and other courts since Defendants/Appellants answered the First Amended\nComplaint (FAC). 2\n2 A partial listing includes: Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 121 S. Ct. 727,\n148 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2001)(\"as applied\" criminal law claims disallowed for civil\nstatute; criminal law constitutional claims not applicable to SVPs' treatment\nrequirements); Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201,121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d\n272 (2001)(qualified immunity); McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24,(2002)(no right to\nprivileges if not participating in treatment); Kulas v. Valdez, 159 F.3d 453 (9 'hCir.\n1998), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1187 (2000)(SVP treatment); Thielman v. Leean,\n282 F.3d 478 (7'h Cir. 2002)(due process and equal protection, conditions of\nconfinement); In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638,550 S.E.2d 311 (2001)(statute tracks\nKansas' statute and therefore no Double Jeopardy, conditions of confinement not\npunitive); Page v. Torrey, 201 F.3d 1136 (9 thCir. 2000)(person detained as SVP\n\nIn fact, Appellees' retreat from their assertion that Appellants' arguments are\nexactly the sameby using the terms \"most of the arguments\" and on page 12of the\nAnswer stating \"[w]ith respect toDefendants' claims thatwere not previously raised\nand adjudicated...\". Thus, Appellees admit that not all of Appellants' arguments\nwere previously raised.\nAppellees assertthat the qualified immunity defense is not properly raised at\nthis stageof the proceedings. That is inaccurate. Appellants arerequired to raise the\ndefense of qualified immunity as early as possible in the proceedings so that the\nCourt's and parties' time is not wasted. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201,121 S.\nnot subject to PLRA); Mulzoz v. Kolender, 208 F. Supp. 2d 1125 (S.D.CA\n2002)(SVP confinement in jail while awaiting hearing not a constitutional\nviolation): Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407 (2002)(serious difficulty controlling\nbehavior required for SVP commitment); Woodard v. Mayberg, 242 F. Supp. 2d\n695 (N.D.CA 2003)(California's SVP commitment scheme tracks Kansas and\nWashington's SVP commitment schemes and is civil, not punitive in nature - \"as\napplied\" challenge to statute inappropriate under Seling); Hubbart v. Superior\nCourt, 19 Cal.4th 1138 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492] (1999)(SVPA tracks Kansas' statute\nas proper civil commitment scheme and does not violate es post facto, double\njeopardy, due process, equal protection); People v. Hurtado, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 186\n[28 Cal.4th 1179] (2002)(SVPA not punitive); (People v. Superior Court\n(Ghilotti), 27 Cal.4th 888 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] (2002)(SVPA narrowly tailored to\nachieve compelling purpose of confining and treating extremely dangerous\npersons unable to control mental disorders);Cooley v. Superior Court, 29 Cal. 4th\n228, 253 [57 P.3d 654](SVPs and LPS patiefits not similarly situated for equal\nprotection purposes); In re Calhoun, 112 Cal.App.4th 1262 [6 Cal Rptr.3d 34]\n(2003)(vacated and remanded subsequent to filing of Appellants' Opening Brief\nby 85 P.3d 2 (Cal. 2004)(SVPs are committed for and may not refuse treatment);\nHubbart v. Knapp, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15534 (N.D.CA. 2003)(Ex Post facto\nclause applies only to criminal statutes and Double Jeopardy applies only to\ncriminal proceedings). ._\n4\n\nCt. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001 ); Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227, 116 L. Ed.\n2d 589, 112 S. Ct. 534 (1991) (percuriam).\nAppellees' assert that the qualified immunity defense goes only to the\nreasonableness of Appellants' actions. Rather, Appellants first assert the defense of\nqualified immunity based on the Appellees pleading of law not applicable to\nAppellants. Under decisions handed down in the last four years, several of\nAppellees' causes of action are based on law not applicable to Appellees.\nSecondly, Appellants base the threshold qualified in_launity defense on the lack\nof clearly established law governing Appellees' causes of action against Appellants\nin their individual capacities.\nI.\nAPPELLEES' LAW OF THE CASE\nASSERTION IS IVIISPLACED\nAppellees' primary argument in urging the Court of Appeals to affirm the\nDistrict Court's summary denial of Appellants' Motion to Dismiss the SAC is that the\nDistrict Court also summarily denied Appellants' Motion to Dismiss the FAC.\nAppellees' incorrectly assert that the two Motions are identical except that a new\nparty was added. Answer p. 5. Appellees fail to note that the new party was added\nin his individual capacity. Under Appellees reasoning the new party, who had no\nchance to argue the prior summary denial, is precluded from seeking dismissal from\n\ni\nthe litigation now that he has been added in his individual capacity. No authority\nstands for that proposition.\nIn any event the law of the case doctrine does not apply when the prior\npleading was sunvnarily denied. This follows from the fact that no findings of fact\nand conclusions of law, to establish law of the case, have been made by the court.\nSee e.g., United States v. Cote, 51 F.3d 178, 181 (9th Cir. 1995) (law of the case does\nnot apply because the summary denial of the petition does not indicate the court\nconsidered and decided the issue presented by the government...\"); see also Moore\nv. Anderson, 222 F.3d 280 (7thCir. 2000) (law of the case is inapplicable because a\nsummary denial of a petition for rehearing does not explain the bases forthe denial,\nit is insufficient to confer any implication or inference regarding a court's opinion\nrelative to the merits).\nAs was the case in Moore, the district court's summary denial of Appellants'\nMotion does not explain the basis for the denial. It is therefore insufficient to confer\nany.implication or inference regarding a court's opinion relative to the merits of\nAppellants arguments. Moore at 284; See also Wilmer v. Board of County Comm 'rs,\n69 F.3d 406 (10 'h Cir. 1995)(issues must actually be decided before law of the case\ncan be invoked)]\n3 It is worthy to note that the California Supreme Court has come to the\nsame conclusion. Kowis v. Howard, 3 Cal. 4th 888 (1992) (A sunanaary denial\ndoes not decide a \"cause\"... and should therefore not be given law of the case\n\nThe United States Supreme Court long ago explained why law of the case\ndoctrine does not extend to interlocutory orders.

The choice not to appeal the first\ninterlocutory order did not mean that on appeal of the second interlocutory order law\nof the case doctrine applied.

We think that it requires a final\njudgment to sustain the application of the rule of the law of the case just as it does for\nthe kindred rule of resjudicata.' I Id. at 199. See also Union Mut.

Changes in the Law Exception to Law of the Case Applies.\nAlthough the law of the case doctrine is not applicable to a summary denial\nconstituting an interlocutory order the instant appeal falls within at least two\n8\n\nexceptions to the doctrine's application in any event.\nThe law of the case doctrine is discretionary. See Furlong v. Shalala, 238 F.3d\n227, 237 n. 5 (2d Cir. 2001), and this Court need not apply the doctrine if the\ncircumstances warrant. See, e.g., Blue Cross and Blue Shield United of Wis. v.\nMarshfield Clinic, 152 F.3d 588,591 (7th Cir. 1998) Appellants' appeal falls within\ntwo exceptions to the law of the case doctrine's applicability.\nA court may have discretion to depart from the law of the case where:\n1) the first decision was clearly erroneous; 2) an intervening change in\nthe law has occurred; 3) the evidence on remand is substantially\ndifferent; 4) other changed circumstances exist; or 5) a manifest\ni11iustice would otherwise result.\nUnited States v. Alexander, 106 F.3d 874, 876 (9thCir. 1997).\nB. Manifest Injustice Will Result If the Defendant Added in His\nIndividual Capacity Is Bound by a Summary Denial Three Years\nPrior to His Involvement in the Case.\nThe SAC makes no distinctions among Defendants. All are grouped together\nas one for all alleged claims in both their individual and official capacities. No\nindividual separate acts are alleged. No individual proximate causation is alleged.\nIt would be manifestly unfair for one Defendant who has been grouped with all other\nDefendants to not have an opportunity to argue his claims for dismissal at the\nthreshold stage of the litigation. It would be similarlyunfair for the other Defendants\n9\n\ntoremain in a lawsuit alleging the sameviolations when the newly added Defendant\nis dismissed from the lawsuit based olachanges in the law since the summary denial\nof aMotion to Dismiss issued three years prior:\nManifest injustice would clearly occur if the new defendant, Melvin Hunter,\nis bound in his individual capacity by a decision with which he was not involved. 4\nOn the other side of that coin, manifest injustice would alsoresult when Mr. Hunter\nis dismissed in either his individual capacity yet other Defendants arenot despite all\nDefendants being grouped together asone in the SAC.\nC. Changes in the Law Applicable to SVPs.\nIn the opening brief Appellants discuss several Supreme Court and Circuit\nCourt decisions that have been issued since the sunmlary denial of Appellees' First\nAmended Complaint in February, 2000. Opening Brief pp. 22-23; See footnote 2..\nNumerous decisions have effectively altered the legal landscape governing SVP\ncommitment and confinement. Among these decisions is Seling v. Young, 531 U.S.\n250, 121 S. Ct. 727, 148 L. Ed. 2d 734 wherein the Supreme Court held that a civil\nstatute cannot be divested of its civil nature by the implementation of that statute.\nSeling at 267. it is Appellants' implementation of the statute that Appellees attack.\n4 Appellants note that Appellees fail to mention that they filed a\nsuccessful motion to add Mr. Hunter as a Defendant in his individual capacity\ndespite his being at the hospital prior to appointment as Executive Director for\nonly six months. Appellants automatically substituted Mr. Hunter in as a\nDefendant in his official capacity when he assumed his post.\n..\n10\n\nIn the SAC Appellees make alleged claims based solely on constitutional\nprovisions applicable only tothe criminally confined. Ex post facto, double jeopardy,\nSixth Amendment, and Eighth Amendment claims are simply not applicable to the\ncivilly committed.\nAppellees argue that these constitutional provisions should be applicable to\nAppellants because they are alleging that it was the Appellants' acts which gave rise\nto the claims and thus the allegations are not an \"as applied\" challenge. Appellants\nfail to see the distinction.\n1. Seling v. Young Bars Appellees Criminal Jurisprudential\nClaims.\nAppellees clailn that Seling is not applicable to Appellants herein because\nAppellees seek injunctive relief, claiming that Seling specifically allowed such a\nclaim. Answer p. 17. Appellees grossly misrepresent the holding in Seling with this\nargument. Nowhere in the Seling decision does the Court imply that a civilly\ncommitted section 1983 claimant may use constitutional criminal jurisprudence to\nstate a claim for injunctive relief. In fact, in referring the Kansas v. Hendricks, 521\nU.S. 346, 369, Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997) the Seling Court stated \"Our\nconclusion that the Kansas Act was \"nonpunitive thus removed an essential\nprerequi site for both Hendricks' double jeopardy and ex post facto claims.\"\nAppellants posit that the terms \"Defendants' implementation\" of the SVPA and\nthe SVPA \"as applied\" to Plaintiffs\" mean virtually the same thing. In either case the\n11\n\nstatute is a civil commitment statute as already determined by the California Supreme\nCourt. Hubbart v. Superior Court (1999) 19 Cal. 4th 1138 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492].\nSimilarly, Appellees approach in the instant case is similar to petitioners in\nSelingwhere llle court admonished that \"Permittingrespondent's as-applied challenge\nwould invite an end run around the Washington Supreme Court's decision that the\n[Washington Sexually Violent Predator] Act is civil in circumstances where a direct\nattack on that decision is not before this Court.\" Seling at 263. Here Appellees ask\nthe Court to apply criminal law jurisprudence not applicable to the civilly committed\nto defeat Appellants claim of qualified immunity thereby attempting an end run\naround the California Supreme Court's decision in Hubbart wherein the SVPA was\nfound to be a constitutional civil commitment scheme and not violative of ex post\nfacto and double jeopardy.\nAs was the case in Seling, this court must evaluate Appellees' allegations as\npresented in a double jeopardy and ex post facto challenge under the assumption that\nthe SVPA is civil, as determined by the Hubbart court. Seling at 263.\nAppellees also appear to claim that Seling is inapplicable because the\nWashington treatment facility was under an injunction to comply with constitutional\nrequirements and a special master had been appointed to oversee compliance with the\n12\n\ninjunction. 5 Appellees appear to claim that Seling should not apply because\nAppellees herein are currently seeking an injunction. However, the Seling Court did\nnot indicate that the deci sion on the application of double jeopardy and ex post facto\nturned on the operative injunction.\nIn any event, Appellees seek much more than an injunction in this case. They\nseek monetary damages against Appellants in their individual as well as their official\ncapacities. If Appellees were seeking only injunctive relief qualified immunity would\nnot arise.\nAppellees also appear to claim that they are not barred from bringing Ex post\nFacto, double jeopardy, Sixth Amendment and Eighth Amendment claims because\nAppellees claims are brought by the SVP class as a whole and the matter can\nconclusively resolve the question whether AppelIants have implemented the SVPA\nm a constitutional manner. Appellants claim this is distinct from an \"as applied\"\nchallenge. However, as Seling stated \"The civil nature of a confinement scheme\ncannot be altered based merely on vagaries in the implementation of the authorizing\nstatute.\" Id. at 263; See also Hubbart.\n: Interestingly, the Special Master appointed by the Federal District Court\nfor the Western District of Washington to oversee constitutional compliance with\nthe Washington Sexually Violent Predator treatment program was Dr. Janice\nMarques of the California Department of Mental Health, one of the designers of\nthe California Sexually Violent Predator treatment program at Atascadero State\nHospital.\n13\n\nIn their answer Appellees claim that becausethis caseis a class action it will\nallow the court to conclusively resolve whether Appellants have implemented the\nSVPA in aconstitutional manner. Answer p. 18. Appellees fail to explain how this\nargument supports the imposition of both acriminal law andcivil law constitutional\nanalytical framework in the instant matter or how the classaction statusallows for an\n\"end-run\" around the California Supreme Court's decision in Hubbart.\nTo paraphrase the Ninth Circuit in Young v. Weston, 344 F.3d 973,977 (9mCir.\n2003) the SVPA's civil nature precludes Appellees' claims that the SVPA violates\nthe ex post facto and double jeopardy claims. 6\nIn addition, under the class certification order the litigation is divided into\nPhase I and Phase II. Supplemental Excerpts of Record pp. 0820-0829. Phase II is\nstructured to allow each individual class member to bring any claim which survives\nPhase I, as an individual. Thus, Appellees arguments that the class action decided the\nissues once and for all is mistaken in that if Double Jeopardy, Ex post facto, Sixth\nAmendment and Eighth Amendment claims survive the initial Phase of the litigation\nthe individual class members are guaranteed the opportunity to litigate the issues as\nthey apply to each individual in Phase II of the litigation.\nAppellants wonder if Appellees have considered to what effect a finding\nof ex post facto and/or double jeopardy violations would have if not immediate\nwrits by the SVP population seeking immediate release despite Appellees claims\nthat they do not seek release but only an injunction.\n14\n\nThe class certification structure flows from the conceptual foundation for the\nclass action vehicle. The class stands for each individual. Therefore, any relief\nreduces to relief for that individual as a member ofthe class. In their Answer\nAppellees claim that they are not attacking the SVPA. They argue that they are\nattacking the SVPA's implementation by Appellants-i.e., how Appellants have\napplied the SVPA to affect eachclassmember. Following this approach to its logical\nconclusion, it is how the SVPA is applied by Appellants to eachclass member that\nis truly at issue. AS such, Seling is controlling and the double Jeopardy, Ex Post\nFacto, Sixth Amendment and Eighth Amendment claims nmst be dismissed with\nprejudice.\nD. The Law Is Clear That to Defeat a Qualified Immunity Defense\nApplicable Law Must Be Violated.\nTo defeat a claim of qualified immunity requires \"the existence of clearly\nestablished law when \"the words of the pertinent federal statute or federal\nconstitutional provision . . . [are] specific enough to establish clearly the law\napplicable to particular conduct and circumstances...\" Durruthy v. Pastor, 351 F.3d\n1080, 1092 (11 _\"Cir. 2003)(emphasis added). \"Once a defendant claims that he is\nentitled to qualified immunity, the court is to determine 'not only the currently\napplicable law, but whether that law was clearly established at the time an action\noccurred.' Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818.\" Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1196 (9th\n15\n\nCir. 2000) (underline emphasis added).\n\"When a defendant pleads the defense of qualified immunity, the trial judge\nshould determine both what the current applicable law is and whether it was clearly\nestablished when the action occurred.\" Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 111 S. Ct.\n1789, 114 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1991) (emphasis added). \"[T]he first step in determining\nif the defendants are entitled to qualified inamunity is to examine 'whether, based on\nthe applicable law, a constitutional violation occurred.'\" Flagner v. I_'lkinson, 241\nF.3d 475,480 (6 'h Cir. 2001) (citations omitted; emphasis added).\nTo defeat a claim of qualified immunity Appellees must show that the law\nAppellants are accused of violating is applicable to Appellees. If the law is not\napplicable to Appellees qualified immunity must attach and defeat the claim at the\nmotior/to dismiss stage. No factual inquiry can make inapplicable law somehow\napplicable to a plaintiff. Thus, under Seling, which forbids an \"as applied\" criminal\nlaw challenge to a civil statute, and the \"applicable law\" requirement necessary to\ndefeat a claim of qualified immunity, Appellees claims under the Expost Facto and\nDouble Jeopardy clauses of the Constitution as well as their Sixth Amendment and\nEighth Amendment claims must be dismissed. The dismissal should be with\nprejudice and should be in both Appellants' individual and official capacities on\nqualified immunity grounds and for failure to state a claim for Appellants in their\nofficial capacities.\n16\n\nE. Involuntary Medication.\nAppellees claim that involuntarily conmlitted persons have an absolute right\nto be free of involuntary treatment. The Supreme Court as recently as June 16, 2003\ndetem_ned that involuntary medication of confined persons was acceptable under\ncertain circumstances. As Appellees' point out, involuntary medication is\npermitted when a medically informed record supports the need for medication and\nprocedural safeguards are in place. Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 123 S.Ct.\n2174, 156 L.Ed.2d 197 (2003). In the case of the SVP such procedural safeguards are\nin place during the commitment process and a medically informed record is part of\nthe conamitment process.\nAppellants note to the court that the SVPA requires the treatment of SVPs.\nWell. & Inst. Code section 6603. The involuntary medication of SVPs is a\nconstitutional function Of the treatment requirement and the SVP commitment\ncriteria. In addition, the question of required treatment absent involuntary medication\nis not clearly established as a constitutional violation\nAppellees correctly point out that one case cited by Appellants in their Opening\nBrief has since been vacated by the California Supreme Court. However, Appellees\nfail to point out that the case was remanded to the California Court of Appeal for\nreconsideration by that same order vacating the Court of Appeal decision. Issues are\nbeing briefed with the most recent request for briefing of specific issues due June 25,\n17\n\n2004. That case hz re Calhoun 112 Cal.App.4th 1262 [6 Ca1 Rptr.3d 34] (2003)\n(vacated and remanded subsequent to filing of Appellants' Opening Brief by 85 P.3d\n2 (Cal. 2004), highlights Appellants position regarding the fact that the law\ngoverning involuntarily medicating SVPs is not clearly established. The original\nCalhoun decision held that the SVPA was written to allow the involuntary ti'eatment,\nincluding medication, of SVPs. In vacating and remanding the California Supreme\ncourt did not give an opinion that the original decision was in elTor. Rather, it\nremanded for reconsideration in light of another case involving a mentally disordered\noffender who had been involuntarily medicated. Thus, the issue remains unsettled in\nCalifornia.\nIn support of their contention that involuntary medication of SVPs is a\nconstitutional violation Appellees cite several cases handed down since the Motion\nto Dismiss the FAC was summarily denied. Answer p. 27-28. This proves\nAppellants' point regarding recent changes in the law. However, the cases Appellees\nnote also prove Appellants' entitlement to qualified immunity on this issue, at the\nvery least. The very fact that several recent decisions have addressed the involuntary\nmedication question from various angles and with various outcomes shows the law\ngoverning involuntary medication of the SVP is not now, and was not in 1998, clearly\nestablished.\nAppellants ask the Court to take judicial notice of the SVPA and its\n18\n\nrequirelnent that SVPsbetreai:edduring confinement. The SVPsareprovided all due\nprocess during the commitment process itself. The order of commitmenL as a\nfunction of the comn-fitment criteria, fulfills all constitutional requirements of due\nprocess prior to involuntary medication for treatment purposes.\nThe SVPA presents acomprehensive statutory schemedesigned toaddress the\nproblem of a\"small group of criminal offenders who areextremely dangerous asthe\nresult of mental impairment, and who are likely to continue actsof sexual violence\neven after they have been punished for such crimes.\" Hubbart supra at 1143.\nThe process for determining whether a convicted sex offender meets the\nrequirements of the SVPA takes place in several stages, both administrative and\njudicial. At fill stages of the proceedings, there are protections built into the process\nto ensure that the rights of the individual are protected. (See Welf. & lnst Code §§\n6601,6601.3, 6601.5, 6602, 6602.5, 6603, 6604, 6604.1, 6605, and 6606) Ifa case\ndoes in fact proceed to court oll the petition to cormnJt, the individual is afforded a\njury trial with counsel, where the state bears the burden of proving beyond a\nreasonable doubt, that the individual meets the criteria for being declared an SVP.\nOnce the State meets its burden of proof, the SVPA mandates that the SVP\nreceive \"appropriate treatment.\" Appellees are afforded the. full panoply of rights\nduring the commitment process including a jury trial.\nThus, the question of treatment for the SVP has been decided through Court\n19\n\nproceedings. In fact, the Legislature was very clear: \"Treatment does not mean that\nthe person must recognize his or her problem and willingly participate in the\ntreatment program.\" Well. & Inst Code § 6606 (a). The Legislature has mandated\nthat the Department of Mental Health \"shall afford the [SVP] with treatment\" even\nif the SVP does not consent to the treatment. Welf. & Inst Code § 6606 (a) and (b). 7\nThe Legislature has not given the SVP \"veto power\" over treatment, but instead\nleft it to the sound professional judgment of the mental health professionals employed\nat ASH. 8\nAs the SVPA requires, a medically informed record isrequired for commitment\nfor treatment. Thus, Appellants' contention that involuntary medication was and is\n7 In fact, Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600 mandates that the\nDepartment of Mental Health provide a Program of Treatment. \"A person who is\nconmaitted under this article shall be provided with progranmaing...\" (§ 6606(a)\nAnd \"It]he progran_'Nng provided ... shall be consistent with current institutional\nstandards for the treatment of sex offenders, and shall be based on a structured\ntreatment protocol ...\" (§ 6606(c)).\nAs one Court opined twenty years ago, \"[W]e believe it is patently\nunwise to give person committed to treannent what is in essence a veto power. If\na patient can render himselfunamenable to treatment by simplyrefusing to\ncooperate in therapy programs set up for his benefit, the state's fundamental\ninterest in treating and hopefully, curing those persons with dangerous mental\ndisorders would be frustrated. We are inclined to agree with the trial judge who\nstated, \"the People of this State have an entitlement, in view of that which has\noccurred in Mr. Lakey's life and in the life of his victim, to insist that he, so long\nas there are programs available for his treatment at Atascadero, cooperate in -\nthose programs .... \" (People v. Lakey, 102 Cal.App.3d 962, 973\n(1980)(interpreting requirements of Mentally Disordered Sex Offender statute)\n20\n\npermissible is supported by the commitment statute itself.\nII.\nSTATE LAW CLAIMS\nIn their answer Appellees claim that they are not making any state law claims.\nHowever, in the SAC Appellees include alleged claims which they assert violate the\nCalifornia Constitution and State law. (ER pp. 0480-0485.) Appellants are puzzled\nby this doublespeak-either they are not asserting state law claims and they should not\nbe included in the SAC, or they are asserting them and that is why they are included\nin the SAC. It cannot be both. Based on Appellees assertions in their Answer to\nAppellants' Opening Brief alone, all state law claims should be dismissed with\nprejudice.\nThis approach to stating claims and then denying such claims are stated also\nreflects Appellees approach to their claims for damages against state official\nAppellants in their official capacities. Appellees claim that, even though such claims\nare included in the SAC, they should be ignored. If they should be ignored why are\nthe claims in the SAC?\nIII.\nAPPLICABLE LAW MAY FLOW FROM CASES\nNOT IN THE SAME PROCEDURAL POSTURE\nAppellees argue in their answer that many of Appellants' cited authority are\ninapplicable to the case at bar because those cases were not in the same procedural\n21\n\nposture as the instant case. However, Appellees are mistaken.\nThe law does not flow in a narrow stream between banks formed by decisions\nm the same procedural posture as the case before a court. That a rule of law\ncontained in a Supreme Court habeas petition review is applicable to an Motion to\nDismiss appeal in a Federal Circuit Court of Appeals is basic. •\nNo authority is cited by Appellees for their claimed rule of law that only\ndecisions dealing with the appeal of the summary denial of a Motion to Dismiss a\ncomplaint are applicable in the instant matter. Neither have Appellants found such\nauthority. Appellants are convinced such authority does not exist.\nIV.\nELEVENTH AMENDMENT\nA. Claims for Damages Against State Officials in Their Official\nCapacity are Barred Under the Eleventh Amendment.\nAppellees argue that they are not seeking claims for damages against state\nofficials in their official capacities. However, in arguing that they are not seeking\nsuch damages Appellees' answer states that the \"course of the proceedings\" establish\nthat they are not seeking such damages. Answer p. 8. Thus, Plaintiffs are seeking to\noffer evidence outside of the SAC itself to counter the plain language of the SAC.\nIn deciding whether the SAC seeks unconstitutional damages against .state\nofficials in their official capacity the court must look to the SAC, and not additional\n22\n\nevidence offered as fact to bolster Appellees' contention.\nIf the SAC doesnot actually seekdamagesagainst Appellants in their official\ncapacities why wasthe language not altered to so statewhen the SAC was submitted\nwhen Appellees were aware of the issue prior to filing the SAC. No reasonable\nanswer to that question is proffered by Appellees to explain the inclusion. Appellees\nshould berequired to submit aComplaint thatreflects what they areactually seeking.\nAppellants should not have to guessby looking to the \"course of the proceedings\" to\ndetermine Appellees' requested relief. This Court should order damages claims\nagainst state officials in their official capacity dismissed with prejudice under the\nEleventh Amendment.\nV.\nTHE EIGHTH AMENDMENT IS NOT\nAPPLICABLE TO THE CIVILLY COMMITTED\nAppellees answer cites 11oauthority indicating that the Eighth Amendment is\napplicable to the civilly committed. Appellants refer the court to Frost v. Agnos, 152\nF.3d 1124, 1128 (9 th Cir. 1998) wherein the Court stated that [claims by pretrial\ndetainees are analyzed under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause, rather\nthan under the Eighth Amendment. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n. 16, 60 L. Ed.\n2d 447, 99 S. Ct. 1861 (1979).\"\n23\n\nVI.\nAPPELLEES FAIL TO SPECIFY CONSTITUTIONAL\nVIOLATIONS WITH PARTICULARITY AND RELY ON\nRESPONDEAT SUPERIOR THEORIES TO IMPOSE\nLIABILITY ON SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL\nTo premise a supei-visor's alleged liability on a policy promulgated by the\nsupervisor the plaintiffmust identify a specific policy and the alleged constitutional\ndeprivation. See e.g.. City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 u.S. 378,385, 109 S.Ct.\n1197, 103 L.Ed. 2d 412 (1989); Oviatt v. Pearce, 954 F.2d 1470, 1474 (9 thCir. 1992).\nThe SAC does not identify any specific policies except one Administrative Directive\nthat they do not allege has been violated.\nVII.\nAPPELLEES OTHER CLAIMS CONSTITUTE\nCONCLUSORY ALLEGATIONS AND MISAPPLICATION\nOF THE LAW APPLICABLE TO SVPS\nAppellees other alleged claims and causes of action rely on conclusory\nallegations with no factual support. No specific factual information is supplied in the\nSAC. Appellees are lnistaken in their belief that conclusory allegations are sufficient\nin a Second Amended Complaint. For state officials to undergo the burdens of\nlitigation actual factual allegations are required.\nAppellees cite California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 22 sections 71001\net seq. to support their contention that SVPs have a state-created liberty interest in\n24\n\ncertain privileges atASH. Answer p. 48. Unfortunately, the CCR sections cited by\nAppellees are not applicable to SVPs. Those CCR sections govern \"Acute\nPsychiatric Hospitals.\" Nowhere in the SAC do Appellees allege that SVPs areheld\nin an\"Acute Psychiatric Hospital\" andin fact the SVP units arenot licensed assuch.\nTile quoted CCR sections are simply not applicable to Appellees. Thus, no state-\ncreated liberty interest has been created and Appellants are entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\nVIII.\nFOURTH AMENDMENT SEARCHES\nAppellees misrepresent Appellants Fourth Amendment position. Answer pp.\n37-39. Appellants do not argue that SVPs are prisoners. Appellants do argue that\nSVPs are confined in a secure mental institution because of their continuing\ndangerousness and mental disorders. The safety and security needs of the institution\njustify limits on patients' rights under tile Fourth Amendment.\nIX.\nMcKUNE v. LILE\nAppellants do not argue, again, that SVPs are prisoners for applicability of\nMcKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 122 S. Ct. 2017, 153 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2002). Rather,\n.McKune stands for the proposition that reduction in privileges is a valid response to\nbehaviourial difficulties arising in a confined situation.\n25\n\nAppellees arguments throughout their answer run with the conviction that the\nSVPs aremodel citizens entitled tobe treated assuchwithin the confines of a secure\nmental institution. Appellees arementally disordered individuals committed dueto\nongoing dangerousness. Although that doesnot meanall their rights areforfeit atthe\nhospital door, it does mean reasonable restrictions are appropriate and necessary.\nSuch restrictions are not a constitutional violation and Appellants are entitled to\nqualified immunity for most if not all of Appellees allegations.\n///\n///\n/ / /\n26\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor all of the above reasons Appellants' Motion to Dismiss the SAC should be\ngra_lted with prejudice as to the claim for damages against state officials in their\nofficial capacities and Appellees' alleged claims under the Sixth Amendment, Eighth\nAmendment, Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy clauses of the United States\nConstitution. All claims against Appellants in their individual capacities should be\ndismissed on Qualified Inmaunity grounds.

The complaint at issue was filed by indix, iduals civilly\nconfined at Atascadero State Hospital pursuant to California's Sexually Violent\nPredator Act. It alleges multiple violations of 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 and the\nUnited States Constitution. On appeal, Defendants contend that the district court\nerred in its Order of August 26, 2003, by summarily denying their Motion to\nDismiss Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint on all grounds. In February 2000,\nthe district court previously denied Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the First\nAmended Complaint, which was substantively equivalent to the Second Amended\nComplaint. Defendants did not, however, appeal that ruling.\nIn challenging Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, Defendants reassert\nthe same arguments they advanced to challenge Plaintiffs' First Amended\nComplaint. Specifically, Defendants contend, inter alia, that Plaintiffs' claims for\nmonetary damages should be dismissed because the Eleventh Amendment bars\nsuch claims against Defendants acting in their official capacities and that the\nSecond Amended Complaint contravenes the Eleventh Amendment by seeking to\nenforce state law claims in federal court. Defendants further contend that they are\nentitled to qualified immunity on every claim raised in the Second Amended\nComplaint either because no constitutional violation has been pled or because\nreasonable officials in Defendants' positions would believe their alleged actions\nwere constitutionally permissible. As Plaintiffs argued in their Oppositions to\nDefendants' two Motions to Dismiss, and as the district court twice found,\nDefendants' arguments are without merit.\nContrary to Defendants' assertions, the Second Amended Complaint and the\ncourse of proceedings in this case make clear that Plaintiffs seek damages from\n\nDefendants in their individual capacities only. In addition, none of Plaintiffs'\nclaims attempt to enforce state constitutional claims in federal court. Rather, the\nSecond Amended Complaint seeks only to enforce Plaintiffs' federal statutory and\nconstitutional rights. As such, none of Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment.\nFurthermore, Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity as a matter\nof law on any of the claims raised in the Second Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs\nhave fully and properly alleged facts sufficient to state a claim for every cause of\naction in the Complaint. Defendants' arguments are ineffective to show that their\nalleged conduct did not violate some of the most firmly established rights protected\nby the Constitution. Moreover, regardless of the merits of Defendants' purported\nqualified immunity defense, it is not properly raised at this stage in the proceedings\nupon a Motion to Dismiss. Defendants' request pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) that a\nfinding of qualified immunity be made merely upon the pleadings in this case is\nprecluded because a determination of the reasonableness of the Defendants'\nconduct will necessarily involve the Court in an analysis of the facts underlying\nthis case. Absent adequate development of record facts, a grant of qualified\nimmunity is premature.\nII.\nSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION\nA. District Court Jurisdiction\nThe United States District Court for the Central District of California has\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1343.\nB. Appellate Jurisdiction\nThis Court has appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1291 and\nthe collateral order doctrine. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511,530, 105\nS. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1998). On August 26, 2003, the district court\n\nentered its Order summarily denying Defendants' SecondMotion to Dismiss. ER\n804-05. On September 22, 2003, Defendants timely filed anotice of appeal\npursuant to Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure4(a)(1)(A). ER 806-07.\nIlL\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nThis Court reviews the district court's decision to deny a motion to dismiss\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) de novo. Fireman's Fund Ins.\nCo. v. City of Lodi, 302 F.3d 928, 939 (9 thCir. 2002). It is fundamental that, for\npurposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, all factual allegations set forth in\nthe complaint are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to\nplaintiffs. Thompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 895 (9thCir. 2002), cert. denied, 123\nS. Ct. 1570 (2003). Furthermore, as a general rule, a district court may not\nconsider any material beyond the pleadings. Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d\n668, 688 (9thCir. 2001). A claim may be dismissed with prejudice only if\"it\nappears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the\nclaim that would entitle the plaintiffto relief.\" Thompson, 295 F.3d at 895.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(e) grants parties great flexibility in\nframing their pleadings: \"No technical forms of pleadings or motions are\nrequired.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. (8)(e). Rather, Rule 8(e) simply mandates that \"each\naverment of a pleading.., be simple, concise, and direct.\" Id__:.\nIt is true that a heightened pleading standard is required if subjective intent is\nan element of a claim against a government official in his or her individual\ncapacity. Mendocino Envtl. Ctr. v. Mendocino County, 14 F.3d 457, 460 (9thCir.\n1994). This standard, however, does not apply to every claim in the Second\nAmended Complaint and, where it does apply, it has been met.\n\nIV.\nISSUES PRESENTED\n1. Whether the district erred in concluding that none of Plaintiffs' claims\nare barred by the Eleventh Amendment, where the Second Amended Complaint\nand the course of proceedings in this case evidence that Plaintiffs seek money\ndamages from Defendants in their individual capacities only, and where Plaintiffs\nseek to enforce only federal statutory and constitutional rights.\n2. Whether the district court erred in concluding that Defendants are not\nentitled to qualified immunity on any of the claims raised in the Second Amended\nComplaint, where Plaintiffs have alleged violations of clearly established rights,\nand where a determination of the reasonableness of Defendants' conduct involves\nadequate development of record facts such that a grant of qualified immunity is\npremature.\nV.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nA. Case Background\nThis action, alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 and the United\nStates Constitution, was originally filed pro se on September 2, 1998, by\nindividuals confined at Atascadero State Hospital (\"ASH\") pursuant to the\nSexually Violent Predator Act (the \"SVP Act\"), California Welfare and Institutions\nCode §§ 6600 et seo. (the \"SVPs\"). ER 1-93. In approximately March 1999,\nLatham & Watkins was appointed as pro bono counsel for Plaintiffs. Thereafter,\non August 31, 1999, Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint for Injunctive\nand Declaratory Relief and Monetary Damages, setting forth allegations and causes\nof action that are substantively identical to those of the Second Amended\nComplaint, and seeking class certification. ER 94-120. The district court certified\na class including all individuals who are, or were, confined at ASH pursuant to\n\nCalifornia Welfare and Institutions §§ 6600 et se_ on or after September 2, 1997 -\na class which now includes over 400 individuals.\nPlaintiffs challenge the conditions of their confinement and the adequacy of\nthe therapy/treatment programs at ASH, alleging that the conditions imposed upo n\nthem by ASH policies, practices and procedures violate constitutionally afforded\nrights applicable to all citizens in general, and, specifically, to individuals civilly\ncommitted to a state institution for treatment. Plaintiffs allege that, in many\nrespects, the conditions at ASH are similar to, or worse than, those within state\nprisons and that, notwithstanding any claims by Defendants to the contrary, the\nconditions of their confinement at ASH are not designed to further the goals of\neffective treatment, but rather are merely a ruse to keep Plaintiffs offthe street and\nimproperly extend the term of their confinement.\nFollowing the replacement of Defendant Jon DeMorales by Defendant\nMelvin Hunter as Executive Director at ASH on July 7, 2001, Plaintiffs moved for\nleave to amend their complaint for the sole purpose of adding Mr. Hunter as a\nDefendant in his personal capacity. ER 363-399. As expressly stated in the\nMotion for Leave to Amend Complaint to Add Melvin E. Hunter as a Defendant\nfiled with the Court on June 3, 2002, Plaintiffs' requested amendment effected no\nsubstantive changes to the complaint in this action other than adding Mr. Hunter as\na Defendant. Compare ER 94-120 with ER 462-487.\nB. Defendants' First Motion To Dismiss\nOn November 1, 1999, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' First\nAmended Complaint, stating various grounds for dismissal, most of which are\nidentical or similar to the grounds upon which Defendants make their current\nMotion to Dismiss. ER 121-154. After lengthy consideration of the merits of\nDefendants' claims, the district court summarily denied the Motion to Dismiss the\nFirst Amended Complaint upon all grounds by its Order of February 4, 2000. ER\n\n344. Defendants did not appeal this Order. Nor did they seek reconsideration.\nC. The Second Amended Complaint\nFollowing the replacement of Defendant Jon DeMorales by Defendant\nMelvin Hunter as Executive Director at ASH on July 7, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a\nSecond Amended Complaint for the sole purpose of adding Mr. Hunter as a\nDefendant in his personal capacity. ER 462-487. The Second Amended\nComplaint sets forth 10 claims for relief. In summary, it alleges that the officials\nwho both set the policies that govern the conditions of Plaintiffs' confinement and\ntreatment at ASH and are delegated the duty to supervise the enforcement of those\nand all other policies, practices and procedures at ASH, have expressly authorized\nor otherwise violated their duty to prevent the following improper conduct and/or\nconditions at ASH:\n• a pattern and practice of force-medicating Plaintiffs in non-\nemergency situations and without following necessary\nprotective procedures (ER 476, ¶48);\n• a pattem and practice of reducing Plaintiffs' access levels and\nprivileges as a form of punishment for refusal to participate in\ntreatment sessions and for the initiation of this and other\nlawsuits (ER 476, *]47);\n• a pattern and practice of putting Plaintiffs in excessive restraints\nfor nonthreatening and/or nondisruptive conduct, including the\nmere refusal to participate in treatment or therapy (ER 478,\n¶¶56, 57);\n• a pattern and practice of putting Plaintiffs in unnecessary four-\npoint restraints and/or subjecting Plaintiffs to degrading public\nstrip-searches (ER 479, ¶64);\n• a pattern and practice of unreasonably denying Plaintiffs access\n\nto the law library in retaliation for participation in this and other\nlawsuits (ER 480, ¶66);\n• a pattern and practice of deliberately denying Plaintiffs\nprotection from other patients at ASH despite the existence of\ncognizable threats to Plaintiffs' health and safety as a result of\ntheir forced intermingling with penal commitments (ER 78,\n¶54, 55);\n• a pattern and practice of imposing living conditions upon\nPlaintiffs which are, in many respects, worse than prison\nconditions and which thereby fail to satisfy constitutional\nstandards applicable to civil commitments (ER 479-80,\n¶¶59-68); and\n• a pattern and practice of denying Plaintiffs a legitimate and\nconstitutionally mandated system of treatment, whereby\nPlaintiffs' confinement at ASH becomes nothing more than a de\nfacto extension of their prison sentence (ER 477, ¶5i).\nIn various combinations, this misconduct by, and/or under the direct\nsupervision of, Defendants constitutes violations of Plaintiffs' clear and well-\nestablished federal constitutional rights.\nD. Defendants' Second Motion To Dismiss\nOn February 25, 2003, Defendants moved to dismiss the Second Amended\nComplaint, reasserting the same grounds for dismissal raised in their First Motion\nto Dismiss. ER 489-556. On August 26, 2003, the district court summarily denied\nDefendants' Second Motion to Dismiss on all grounds. ER 804-805.\n\nWI*\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThis Court should not reconsider the merits of Defendants' arguments,\nwhich have been rejected by the district court twice. Rather, this Court should\naffirm the district court's denial of Defendants' Second Motion to Dismiss based\non the law of the case doctrine. Three years prior to denying Defendants' Motion\nto Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint, the district court denied Defendants'\nMotion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint. The Second Amended\nComplaint is an exact replica of the First Amended Complaint, except that it\nincludes one additional Defendant. Defendants could have appealed the district\ncourt's denial of their First Motion to Dismiss, but they did not do so. Rather,\nDefendants merely repeated in their Second Motion to Dismiss arguments that had\nalready been advanced in the First Motion to Dismiss and rejected by the district\ncourt. The law of the case bars reexamination of those issues now.\nDefendants' arguments fail on the merits as well. Contrary to Defendants'\nassertion, Plaintiffs do not seek monetary damages from Defendants in their\nofficial capacities. Rather, the Second Amended Complaint and the course of\nproceedings evidence that Plaintiffs seek damages from Defendants in their\nindividual capacities only. So, too, Plaintiffs seek only to enforce their federal\nstatutory and constitutional rights - not pendant state law .claims. Accordingly, the\nEleventh Amendment presents no bar.\nDefendants' attempt to invoke qualified immunity must also fail. The\nSecond Amended Complaint has sufficiently pled facts to state a claim for every\ncause of action in the complaint. Furthermore, the rights Plaintiffs seek to enforce\nhave all been clearly established. Most importantly, Defendants' request for a\nfinding of qualified immunity in this case is premature because a determination of\nthe reasonableness of Defendants' conductwill necessarily involve the Court in an\n\nanalysis of the facts underlying this case. Suchfactual analysis is not appropriate\nwhen ruling on a Motion to Dismiss.\nVII.\nTHE DISTRICT COURT'S DENIAL OF DEFENDANTS' SECOND\nMOTION TO DISMISS SHOULD BE AFFIRMED OUTRIGHT\nPURSUANT TO THE LAW OF THE CASE DOCTRINE\nThis Court may affirm the district court's denial of Defendants' Second\nMotion to Dismiss on any ground supported by the record. Se___e_.__e_,.,Jama Const.\nv. City of Los Angeles, 983 F.2d 1045, 1047 (9thCir. 1991). Plaintiffs submit that\nthis Court should affirm the district court's ruling on the basis that the law of the\ncase doctrine bars reconsideration of the claims raised and rejected by the district\ncourt in connection with the denial of Defendants' First Motion to Dismiss.\nUnder the law of the case doctrine, \"a court is general.ly precluded from\nreconsidering an issue previously decided by the same court, or a higher court in\nthe identical case.\" United States v. Alexander, 106 F.3d 874, 876 (9thCir. 1997);\nse.__a_ls_oe Pit River Home & Agric. Coop. Ass'n. v. United States, 30 F.3d 1088,\n1097 (9thCir. 1994); Matthews v. NCAA, 179 F. Supp. 2d 1209, 1217 (E.D. Wash.\n2001). This doctrine was \"created to maintain consistency and avoid\nreconsideration, during the course of a single continuing lawsuit, of those decisions\nthat are intended to put a matter to rest.\" Pit River Home, 30 F.3d at 1097; see also\nUnited States v. Lower Elwha Band of S'Klallams, 235 F.3d 443,452 (9thCir.\n2000).\nA court has discretion to depart from the law of the case only where: \"1) the\nfirst decision was clearly erroneous; 2) an intervening change in the law has\noccurred; 3) the evidence on remand is substantially different; 4) other changed\ncircumstances exist; or 5) a manifest injustice would otherwise result.\" Alexander,\n106 F.3d at 876. Absent one of the requisite justifications, failure to apply the\n\ndoctrine constitutes anabuseof discretion. Id.___.\nSignificantly, the law of the casedoctrine canoperate tobar the\nreconsideration of issuesdisposed of by a ruling on a motion to dismiss anoriginal\ncomplaint where aparty raises thosesameissuesin defense of an amendedor\nsupplemental complaint. In Hershel Calif. Fruit Prod. Co. v. Hunt Foods, 16\nF.R.D. 547 (N.D. Cal. 1954), for example, the trial court ruled that the plaintiffs\noriginal complaint stated a claim for violation of the Robinson-Patman Price\nDiscrimination Act. Upon consideration of defendant's motion to dismiss\nplaintiff's supplemental complaint, the court found that the same ruling should\napply. Hershe____1_6l,F.R.D. at 549 (\"I believe that since this has been decided [by a\nprior judge] in ruling on the original complaint the same ruling should apply where\nwe are dealing with the supplemental complaint.\"); see also Halpert v. Engine Air\nServ_., 131 F. Supp. 402, 403 (E.D.N.Y. 1954) (\"If the amended complaint is\nsubstantially the same as the original, restricted however to the assertion of a claim\nfor relief under Section 70 of the [Bankruptcy] Act, the law of the case has been\nestablished with reference thereto .... It results that the defendants' motion, in\neffect if not in form, is an attempt to reargue matters disposed of.\").\nLaw of the case bars reconsideration of Defendants' claims here. In\nFebruary 2000, the district court summarily denied, in its entirety, Defendants'\nMotion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint. ER 344. Plaintiffs subsequently\nfiled a Second Amended Complaint for the sole purpose of adding one additional\ndefendant - the newly hired Executive Director of ASH, Melvin E. Hunter. The\nSecond Amended Complaint reflects a single, nominal change to the extent it adds\nan additional named defendant. It effects no substantive change whatsoever to the\ncomplaint that survived Defendants' First Motion to Dismiss. Compare ER 462-\n487 with ER 94-120.\n10\n\nIn bringing their Second Motion to Dismiss, Defendants failed to specify\nany justification for the district court to revisit its decision to uphold the First\nAmended Complaint. Defendants never sought reconsideration of the first Order\ndenying their First Motion to Dismiss, nor did they appeal that Order or show that\nit was entered in clear error. Rather, Defendants merely repeated in their Second\nMotion to Dismiss the exact same arguments that were advanced and rejected by\nthe district court in the First Motion to Dismiss. Most of the arguments the\nDefendants advanced in the Second Motion to Dismiss were previously\nadjudicated in Plaintiffs' favor and the law of the case bars reexamination of those\nissues. Se.___e.e_e_,.,Lower Elwha Band of S'Klallams, 235 F.3d at 443. The balance\nof the Defendants' arguments, which involve variations on or expansions of\npreviously advanced arguments, could have been raised in the First Motion to\nDismiss. Defendants' failure to do so does not entitle them to a second bite at the\napple three years after the district court's ruling denying the First Motion to\nDismiss.\nDefendants have attempted to use Plaintiffs' addition of a new defendant as\nan opportunity to seek an untimely and improper request for reconsideration of the\ndistrict court's earlier ruling. Defendants' request that the district court reconsider\nits ruling was, thus, improper because it was an attempt to make an end-run around\nthis district court's earlier ruling and because it disregards the law of the case.\nMore significantly, reconsideration of the district court's February 2000 ruling\nwould force a fundamentally unfair result on Plaintiffs, who, since the First\nAmended Complaint survived judicial scrutiny over three years ago, have\nexpended enormous amounts of time and money conducting extensive merits-\nbased and expert discovery, reviewing hundreds of thousands of pages of\ndocuments, and deposing dozens of witnesses, all in effort to prove each of the\nallegations in the First Amended Complaint.\n11\n\nWith respectto Defendants' claims that werenot previously raised and\nadjudicated in Plaintiffs' favor, Plaintiffs submit that Defendants aretime-barred\nfrom raising such claims in asecond successiveMotion to Dismiss. Defendants\nwere required torespond, in full, to Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint within 20\ndays of its filing. All substantive challenges to that complaint that could havebeen\nbrought then, should havebeenbrought then. Defendants' failure to raise all\nchallenges to the substanceof Plaintiffs' allegations cannotbe overcome by virtue\nof the fact that a single nameddefendant hasbeenadded. Fed.R. Civ. P. 12(g) (\"If\naparty makes amotion under this rule but omits therefrom any defenseor\nobjection then available to the party which this rule permits to beraised by motion,\nthe party shall not thereafter make amotion basedon the defense or objection so\nomitted, except amotion asprovided in subdivision (h)(2) hereof on any grounds\nthere stated.\"); seealso 2 JamesWm. Moore etal., Moore's Federal Practice,\n¶ 12.21 (3d ed. 2003) (\"amending a complaint does not revive omitted defenses or\nobjections that the defendant could have raised in response to the original\ncomplaint.\"). Moreover, even if Defendants' 12(b)(6) defenses are preserved by\nRule 12(h)(2), they could not be asserted in the Second Motion to Dismiss. Id__a_t_.\n¶12.23 (\"If omitted from the initial motion, those matters [included in Rule\n12(h)(2)] may not be raised in a successive Rule 12 motion.\").\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs submit that rather than waste judicial resources in\nconsidering the allegations of a complaint that the district court has already upheld\non two separate occasions, this Court should uphold the district court's summary\ndenial of the Second Motion to Dismiss based on the law of the case. Defendants'\nappeal of the district court's denial of Defendants' Second Motion to Dismiss\nshould be rejected outfight. Se__._ee._,_.,Figueroa v. Gates, 120 F. Supp. 2d 917,\n918-19 n.4 (C.D. Cal. 2000) (\"Although Defendants may feel the need to bring\nidentical arguments on behalf of new Defendants, the Court considers submission\n12\n\nof nearly the same brief to be a waste of time on those issues on which the Court\nhas already rejected Defendants' arguments, as a matter of law.\").\nVIH.\nPLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS ARE NOT BARRED BY THE ELEVENTH\nAMENDMENT OR BY THE DOCTRINE OF ABSTENTION\nA. The Second Amended Complaint And The Course Of Proceedings In\nThis Case Establish That The Complaint Seeks Damages From\nDefendants In Their Individual Capacities Only.\nDefendants first contend that the Second Amended Complaint's prayer for\ndamages against Defendants in their official capacities fails in its entirety for lack\nof jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment. Defendants' sweeping contention\nis without merit. Plaintiffs do not dispute that the Eleventh Amendment bars\nSection 1983 suits for monetary damages against state officials in their official\ncapacity. Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 70-71,109 S. Ct.\n2304, 2312, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45, 57-58 (1989). Nor have Defendants disputed the\nfact that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar Section 1983 suits for monetary\ndamages against state officials in their individual capacity. Hafer v. Melo, 502\nU.S. 21, 31, 112 S. Ct. 358, 363, 116 L. Ed. 2d 301,313 (1991). However, as\nDefendants have previously acknowledged, the parties long ago agreed that the\nSecond Amended Complaint seeks monetary damages from Defendants in their\nindividual capacities only: \"[t]he parties.., have resolved that damages are being\nsought against defendants in their individual capacity only.\" ER 134:24-26.\nDefendants' awareness that they are being sued for damages in their individual\ncapacities is further evidenced by the fact that they have raised the defense of\nqualified immunity, a defense available for state officials only when they are sued\nfor damages in their individual capacities. ER 521-525; Melo v. Haler, 912 F.2d\n13\n\n628, 636 (3rdCir. 1990). Thus, it is unnecessary to amend the complaint to clarify\nthis issue.\nNotwithstanding Defendants' contentions, the Second Amended Complaint\nprovides adequate notice that Defendants are being sued for monetary relief in\ntheir individual capacities. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(a), \"[i]t\nis not necessary to aver the capacity of a party to sue or to be sued.., except to the\nextent required to show the jurisdiction of the court.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(a).\nPlaintiffs have adequately informed Defendants that damages are being sought\nfrom Defendants solely in their individual capacities. The first paragraph of the\nSecond Amended Complaint expressly provides that Defendants are being sued \"in\ntheir individual and official capacities.\" ER 462. Further, as stated above,\nDefendants have long recognized that they are being sued for damages in their\nindividual capacities only. ER 134:24-26. This alone is sufficient \"notice\" under\nRule 9(a). Defendants cannot now feign ignorance to that which they have already\nadmitted and conceded.\nB. Plaintiffs Do Not Seek To Enforce Pendant State Law Claims.\nRelying on Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104\nS. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1994), Defendants argue that they are immune from\nsuits in federal court to enforce pendent state law claims. Defendants' argument is\nwithout meritJ\nFirst, and most importantly, Plaintiffs are not attempting to directly enforce\nCalifornia statutory or constitutional fights. Plaintiffs are attempting to enforce\nThe Eleventh Amendment does not preclude suits against state officers for\nprospective injunctive relief, even w'hen the remedy_ will enjoin implementation\nof an official state policy. Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 161-62, 28 S. Ct.\n441,454-55, 52 L.-Ed. 714 (1908).\n14\n\ntheir federal statutory and constitutional rights. Plaintiffs have asserted that, by\ncontinuing to treat the Plaintiffs as criminal rather than civil commitments,\nDefendants have violated those federal rights. Second, while it is true that the\nFirst, Second and Tenth claims for relief make reference to California\nConstitutional provisions that parallel the rights guaranteed by federal law, the\nrights being asserted through Section 1983 are federal, not state law, claims.\nLikewise, Plaintiffs include references to state law claims because they give\nrise to either liberty or property interests protected by the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Se..__Eerewin Chemerinsky Federal Jurisdiction (1999).\nUnder due process analysis, for example, state law can create both liberty and\nproperty rights, either explicitly or by creating an expectation that gives rise to a\nvested right. Se___eee._,g_.,Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693,710-1 I, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L.\nEd. 2d 405 (1976). Accordingly, the Eleventh Amendment constitutes no bar.\nFurthermore, and for the reasons stated above, Defendants' reliance on 28\nU.S.C. §§ 1367(a) and (c) is misplaced. Section 1367 deals with supplemental\njurisdiction over pendant state law claims (which are not advanced in the Second\nAmended Complaint), rather than federal claims, and is, as such, irrelevant.\nFinally, Defendants' abstention argument was not raised in, or ruled on by\nthe district court and is therefore waived on appeal. Se_....eee._,_., Conn. Gen. Life Ins.\nCo. v. New Images of Beverly Hills, 321 F.3d 878, 882 (9 thCir. 2003). On the\nmerits, it fails for the same reasons Defendants' other Eleventh Amendment claim\nfails.\n15\n\nIXm\nQUALIFIED IMMUNITY DOES NOT BAR PLAINTIFFS' CHALLENGES\nTO THEIR CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT\nA. Plaintiffs May Challenge Defendants' Implementation Of The SVP Act.\nDefendants contend that the Double Jeopardy and E× Post Facto Clauses, as\nwell as the Eighth and Sixth Amendments, do not apply to civil commitments such\nas the Plaintiffs and, accordingly, Plaintiffs' claims are barred. Appellants' Br. at\n11-12. To support this assertion, Defendants rely on the Supreme Court's holding\nin Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 121 S. Ct. 727, 148 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2001),\nwherein the Court ruled that \"[a]n Act found to be civil, cannot be deemed punitive\n'as applied' to a single individual in violation of the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post\nFacto Clauses and provide cause for release.\" Seling, 531 U.S. at 267, 1215 S. Ct.\nat 737, 148 L. Ed. 2d at 749. But Defendants completely mischaracterize the\nnature of Plaintiffs' claims. As set out below, _ is based on facts that are\nwholly distinguishable from the facts presented here.\nSeling involved a habeas action brought by an individual patient seeking\nrelease and challenging the constitutionality of Washington State's sexually violent\npredator statute. The issue addressed was whether the patient could argue that the\nstatute was punitive \"as applied\" to him specifically and thereby in violation of the\nDouble Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses. Seling, 531 U.S. at 262, 121 S. Ct. at\n734-35, 148 L. Ed. 2d at 746. The Court ruled that an individual patient could not\nchallenge the statute on the basis that it was punitive \"as applied\" to him\nindividually, reasoning that \"[s]uch an analysis would never conclusively resolve\nwhether a particular scheme is punitive and would thereby prevent a final\ndetermination of the scheme's validity under the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post\nFacto Clauses.\" Id._.a_t:.263, 121 S. Ct. at 735, 148 L. Ed. 2d at 746.\n16\n\nDefendants fail to recognize that, unlike the patient in Seling, the Plaintiffs\nin this case are not seeking to have the SVP Act declared unconstitutional, either\non its face or \"as applied\" to them. Nor are they seeking release. Rather, Plaintiffs\nmerely seek injunctive relief, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, from the\nunconstitutional conditions of confinement that Defendants have imposed upon\nthem. It is Defendants' conduct, not the SVP Act itself, that the Second Amended\nComplaint alleges violates the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Ciauses, as well\nas the Eighth Amendment and Sixth Amendment. The holding in Seling applies\nonly to actions challenging the constitutionality of sexually violent predator\nstatutes; it does not apply to actions against state officials for unconstitutionally\nimplementing such statutes.\nIn fact, the Court in Seling specifically clarified that its holding does not\nlimit those committed as sexually violent predators from seeking injunctive relief\nfrom unconstitutional conditions of confinement pursuant to a Section 1983 action.\nIn reaching its decision, the Court explained that its holding \"does not mean that\nrespondent and others committed as sexually violent predators have no remedy for\nthe alleged conditions and treatment regime at the Center.\" Id__a:.t 265, 121 S. Ct. at\n736, 148 L. Ed. 2d at 748, The Court then proceeded to \"note that a § 1983 action\nagainst the Center is pending\" and that \"[t]he Center operates under an injunction\nthat requires it to adopt and implement a plan for training and hiring competent sex\noffender therapists; to improve relations between residents and treatment\nproviders; to implement a treatment program for residents containing elements\nrequired by prevailing professional standards; to develop individual treatment\nprograms, and to provide a psychologist or psychiatrist expert in the diagnosis and\ntreatment of sex offenders to supervise the staff.\" Id.__at__2.65-66, 121 S. Ct. at 736,\n148 L. Ed. 2d at 748. Here, no such injunction is currently in'place, and it is\nsimilar injunctive relief that this Section 1983 action seeks to accomplish. The\n17\n\nSeling holding doesnot purport to limit such anaction.\nFinally, it is important to point out that in Seling, the action was brought by\nan individual patient seeking releaseon apetition for writ of habeascorpus,\nwhereasthis action is brought pursuant to a classaction by virtually all patients\nconfined pursuant to the SVP Act. Releasefrom ASH is not among the remedies\nPlaintiffs seek. In refusing to allow an \"as applied\" challenge to the statute atissue\nin Seling, the Court expressedconcern that suchanapproach would \"never\nconclusively resolve\" the constitutionality of the statutesincethe result would vary\ndepending on the \"vagaries\" of eachindividual case. Id__a_t:2.63, 121S.Ct. at 735,\n148L. Ed. 2d at 746. But here,becausethe challenge to the conditions of\nconfinement atASH is brought by virtually every patient committed pursuant to\nthe SVPAct, there is no similar risk that the outcome would changebasedupon\nparticularities of individual cases. Rather, this casewould allow the Court to\nconclusively resolve whether the Defendants haveimplemented the SVP Act in a\nconstitutional manner.\nThus, contrary to Defendants' assertion, Se_Nj_doesnot preclude Plaintiffs\nfrom bringing Double Jeopardy, Ex PostFacto, Sixth Amendment andEighth\nAmendment challenges to their conditions of confinement.\nB. Plaintiffs May Challenge Their Conditions of Confinement Under The\nDouble Jeopardy And Ex Post Facto Claims.\nDefendants assert that claims for violations of the Ex Post Facto and Double\nJeopardy Clauses should be dismissed in light of Kansas v. Hendricks and Seling\nv. Young. Appellants' Br. at 12-14. These cases both rejected facial, not as\napplied, Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto challenges to sexually violent\npredator statutes. In Hendricks, the Court rejected a facial challenge to Kansas's\nsexually violent predator law and in Seling, as discussed above, the Court rejected\n18\n\nan argument that Washington state's sexually violent predator statute was\nunconstitutional \"as applied\" to a particular patient. These cases, however, are\ninapposite to this action because Plaintiffs are not challenging the constitutionality\nof the SVP Act itself. Instead, Plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief from the\npunitive conditions of confinement imposed upon them by Defendants. Neither\nHendricks nor Seling addressed such a challenge. Accordingly, their holdings do\nnot preclude Plaintiffs from challenging Defendants' conduct on Double Jeopardy\nand Ex Post Facto grounds.\nC. Plaintiffs May Challenge Their Conditions of Confinement Under The\nEighth Amendment.\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs may not challenge the punitive conditions of\nconfinement under the Eighth Amendment because the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment already protects civilly committed persons from being\npunished. Appellants' Br. at 14-16. Plaintiffs do not dispute that the punitive\nconditions of confinement violate the Due Process Clause, but Plaintiffs further\nassert that such punitive conditions are so egregious that they amount to cruel and\nunusual punishment and thereby also violate the Eighth Amendment.\nDefendants first cite to Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S. Ct. 1861,\n60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979), wherein the Supreme Court noted that due process, as\nopposed to the Eighth Amendment, requires that a pretrial detainee not be\npunished, since \"[t]he State does not acquire the power to punish with which the\nEighth Amendment is concerned until after it has secured a formal adjudication of\nguilt .... \" Id__a_t_.535 n.16, 99 S. Ct. at 1873 n.16, 60 L. Ed. 2d at 467 n.16\n(quotation and citation omitted). Plaintiffs concede that the Due Process Clause,\nnot the Eighth Amendment, prohibits the state from punishing civil commitments.\nThus, as set out below, Plaintiffs also bring claims under this clause. However,\n19\n\nsince Plaintiffs contend that punishment has in fact occurred, the next logical\nquestion is whether such punishment is so severe that it amounts to cruel and\nunusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\nDefendants next cite to Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S. Ct.\n2452, 73 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1982), for the proposition that the Eighth Amendment is not\nan appropriate source for determining the fights of the involuntarily committed.\nBut in that case, whether the commitment at issue violated the Eighth Amendment\nwas not before the Court. 457 U.S. at 314 n.16, 102 S. Ct. at 2457 n.16, 73 L. Ed.\n2d at 36 n. 16. Rather, in Youngberg the Court only addressed whether an\ninvoluntarily civilly committed patient's substantive due process rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment had been violated. 457 U.S. at 314-15, 102 S. Ct. at 2457,\n73 L. Ed. at 36. In contrast, here, Plaintiffs not only assert that the conditions of\nconfinement violate substantive due process, Plaintiffs also assert that such\nconditions of confinement at ASH are so egregious that they constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The Court in\nYoungberg did not consider, and therefore does not purport to limit, such a\nchallenge.\nFinally, if the conditions of confinement are found to be punitive or\notherwise unconstitutional, then Defendants should not escape liability simply\nbecause they are not labeled as prison officials. For all of the above reasons, the\nPlaintiffs have stated a claim under the Eighth Amendment.\nD. Plaintiffs May Challenge Their Conditions of Confinement Under The\nSixth Amendment.\nDefendants assert that Seling's holding precludes Plaintiffs from challenging\nDefendants' deprivation of their Sixth Amendment fights because the SVP Act is a\ncivil, as opposed to a criminal, statute. Appellants' Br. at 16-17. But, as already\n2O\n\nexplained above,Plaintiffs arenot challenging the SVP Act. They do not allege\nthat the Act violates their Sixth Amendment rights. Rather, they argue that\nDefendants' conduct constitutes punishment, andit is the Defendants, not the SVP\nAct, that havedeprived Plaintiffs of their Sixth Amendment rights. As set out\nabove, _ does not address such an action. Its holding is therefore inapplicable\nto this case. 2 Thus, Plaintiffs have stated a claim for violation of their Sixth\nAmendment rights.\nX.\nPLAINTIFFS DO NOT ALLEGE RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR\nLIABILITY1 BUT BRING PERMISSIBLE § 1983 CLAIMS BASED\nON_ INTER ALIA_ DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE\nDefendants argue that the Second Amended Complaint does not sufficiently\nspecify how the Defendants affirmatively violated the constitutional rights of the\nPlaintiffs, but instead simply relies on a theory ofrespondeat superior, which is not\npermitted in a Section 1983 claim. Appellants' Br. at 17-21.\nDefendants fail to recognize that a supervisor will be liable under Section\n1983 for his or her deliberate indifference to the constitutional violations\ncommitted by subordinates. Se_.__Ceiety of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S. Ct.\n1197, 103 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1989) (finding that inadequate training may be a basis for\nSection 1983 liability); Fayle v. Stapley, 607 F.2d 858, 862 (9 thCir. 1979) (finding\nquestion of fact regarding whether director of hospital was vested with duty to\nensure that patient received noticed before his property was taken). The heart of\nPlaintiffs' case is their challenge to the \"policies, customs, and practices\"\nDefendants' reliance on United States v. Sahhar, 917 F.2d 1197 (9th Cir. 1990)\nis likewise misplaced, as that case, like _, concerned the constitutionality\nof a commitment statute, not the conduc_ficials in implementing the\nstatute.\n21\n\npromulgated by Defendants themselves, as the officials vested with the authority\nand in the positions to make such policies. As Defendants concede, \"[a] supervisor\nmaking policy decisions that cause the alleged constitutional violations may be\nliable.\" Appellants' Br. at 18 (citing Ouzts v. Cummins, 825 F.2d 1276, 1277 (8th\nCir. 1987)). Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants are aware of and tolerate the\nabuses of SVPs, thereby demonstrating Defendants' deliberate indifference to the\nconstitutional violations committed by subordinates. ER 463, ¶2; 466, ¶¶14, 17;\n477, ¶52; 479, ¶58; 480, ¶68. In this regard, Defendants' respondeat superior\nargument is wholly misplaced.\nThe Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs must set forth a variety of specific\nassertions, including a linkage between the individual Defendants and the\nunconstitutional policies and a linkage between the individual Defendants and\nPlaintiffs' injuries. Appellants' Br. at 18. To support their demands for\nspecificity, Defendants point to a variety of cases that focus on the requirements\napplicable to summaryjudgrnent motions. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S.\n635, 107 S. Ct. 3034, 97 L. Ed. 2d 759 (1987); Palmer v. Sanderson, 9 F.3d 1433\n(9thCir. 1993); Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040 (9thCir. 1989); Leer v. Murphy, 844\nF.2d 628 (9thCir. 1988); Padway v. Palches, 665 F.2d 965 (9thCir. 1982); Favle,\n607 F.2d 858. Because the standard for summary judgment is completely different\nfrom the standard for a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the specificity required in these\ncases does not apply at this time.\nNevertheless, the Second Amended Complaint does connect the four named\nDefendants to Plaintiffs' injuries by alleging that Defendants create and enforce\npolicies, practices and procedures that tolerate and encourage the abuse and\nimproper punishment of SVPs. ER 466, ¶17. Defendants' further suggestion that\nthe Second Amended Complaint must allege which of the named Defendants\ncreated which policies, procedures and practices is misplaced at the pleading stage\n22\n\nbecause such information is currently within the exclusive control of the\nDefendants.\nIndeed, Defendants appear to suggest, without citing to any supporting\nauthority, that Plaintiffs should be required to present, within the complaint itself, a\nlist of specific incidents .involving constitutional violations by each Defendant.\nAppellants' Br. at 19-21. This is clearly not required under the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure. Plaintiffs, if required, could produce voluminous evidence of\nviolations of their fights resulting from Defendants' policies, practices, or failure to\nintervene. This, however, involves questions of fact, which are properly raised\nonly as early as a motion for summary judgment.\nXI.\nDEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY IN\nTHEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS\nALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF CLEARLY ESTABLISHED LAW\nA. Defendants' Defense Of Qualified Immunity Is Premature.\nDefendants advance the defense of qualified immunity against every one of\nPlaintiffs' claims. Regardless of the merits of Defendants' purported qualified\nimmunity defense, it is not properly raised at this stage in the proceedings upon a\nmotion to dismiss. As set out below, Plaintiffs have amply demonstrated that the\nfights which Defendants are alleged to have violated were clearly established. This\nis all that is required to overcome a qualified immunity defense at the motion to\ndismiss stage. See Jensen v. City of Oxnard, 145 F.3d 1078, 1085 (9 thCir. 1998)\n(rejecting motion to dismiss because law was clearly established and\nreasonableness of defendants conduct would turn on facts outside the pleadings).\nOnce a plaintiff establishes that the law is clearly established, the burden\nshifts to the defendant to show that a reasonable official could have believed, in\nlight of the settled law, that he was not violating a constitutional right. See Alford\n23\n\nv. Haner, 333 F.3d 972, 977 (9thCir. 2003). The question of whether Defendants,\nnotwithstanding such clearly established law, could nevertheless have reasonably\nbelieved that their conduct was lawful is a question inextricably intertwined with a\nfactual inquiry into the circumstances of the Defendants' actions and the extent to\nwhich a reasonable official in the Defendants' position would have been aware that\nthe conduct at issue was unlawful. Though the two-part test for qualified\nimmunity focuses upon the objective reasonableness of the Defendants' conduct,\nthis does not remove the inquiry from the fact-specific context of the case e_.., in\nthe cohtext of the Fourteenth Amendment, whether under the circumstances\nDefendants could have reasonably believed they were exercising proper\n\"professional judgment\").\nAccordingly, Defendants' request pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) that a finding of\nqualified immunity be made merely upon the pleadings in this case is precluded\nbecause a determination of the reasonableness of the Defendants' conduct would\nrequire this Court to look beyond the pleadings to analyze the facts underlying this\ncase. 3 See Groten v. Cal., 251 F.3d 844, 85 1 (9thCir. 2001) (\"[A] Rule 12(b)(6)\ndismissal is not appropriate unless we can determine, based on the complaint itself,\nthat qualified immunity applies.\") At this stage in the pleadings, an analysis of the\nunderlying facts would be impossible. Jacobs v. City of Chicago, 215 F.3d 758,\n765 n.3 (7thCir. 2000) (\"[I]n many cases, the existence of qualified immunity will\ndepend on the particular facts of a given case. In those cases, the plaintiff is not\nIndeed, the cases primarily relied upon by Defendants all involved review of a\nqualified immunity defense upon a motion for summary judgment, not a\nmotion to dismiss. See, e.__.,Saucier v. l_atz, 533 U.S. 194, 121 S. Ct. 2151,\n150 L. Ed. 2d 272 ('2-ff01\"iT'U.rawford-E1 v. Britton_ 523 U.S. 574, 118 S. Ct.\n1584, 140 L. Ed. 2_ 759:_1.998); Anderson v. Crelghton, 483 U.S. 635, 107\nS..hCt. 3034,97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987); Neely v. Feinstein, 50 F.3d 1502, 1506\n(9' Cir. 1995); Reed v. Philadelphia Hous. Auth., 372 F. Supp. 686 (E D Pa\n1974). \" \" \"\n24\n\nrequired initially to plead factual allegations that anticipate and overcome a\ndefense of qualified immunity.\") Therefore, this Court should refrain from making\nany qualified immunity determination before allowing for an adequate\ndevelopment of the record facts.\nB. Plaintiffs Have Adequately Pied Violations Of Clearly Established Law.\nDefendants assert that Plaintiffs have failed to allege violations of \"clearly\nestablished\" law. Appellants' Br. at 19-21, 21-24. While Crawford-El v. Britton,\n523 U.S. 574, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759 (1998), gives the district court\nauthority to consider qualified immunity issues at the pleading stage, that case also\nspecifically rejects the imposition of a heightened pleading standard that would\nrequire plaintiffs to adduce \"clear and convincing evidence of improper motive.\"\nAll the Court needs to do is assure itself that the rights allegedly violated were\nwell-established. That burden is clearly met here as Plaintiffs have alleged\nviolations of the most fundamental rights afforded by our Constitution.\nDetermining whether a constitutional right is clearly established does not\nrequire that there be a case on point or binding precedent in order to prevail over a\nqualified immunity defense. See Allen v. City & County of Honolulu, 39 F.3d\n936, 939 (9 thCir. 1994); Mendoza v. Block, 27 F.3d 1357, 1362 (9thCir. 1994).\nThus, a finding of clearly established law is not precluded by the possibility that\nthere is no case law addressing the exact scenarios that Plaintiffs describe. Se____ee\nAlexander v. Pen-ill, 916 F.2d 1392, 1397 (9 thCir. 1990) (\"IT]he law simply does\nnot require that we find a prior case with the exact factual situation in order to hold\nthat the official breached a clearly established duty.\"). Further, where there is no\ndecision by the Supreme Court or the particular circuit on the issue in question, the\ndecisions of other circuit, district, and even state courts may provide the basis for\nclearly established law that precludes a qualified immunity defense. See Bilbrev\n25\n\nby Bilbrey v. Brown, 738 F.2d 1462 (9thCir. 1984); Jacobs, 215 F.3d at 767 (\"In\nthe absence of controlling precedent, we broaden our survey to include all relevant\ncaselaw in order to determine 'whether there was such a clear trend in the caselaw\nthat we can say with fair assurance that the recognition of the right by a controlling\nprecedent was merely a question of time.'\") (citations omitted).\nDefendants' proffered authority and their assertion that the law governing\nthe commitment and treatment of SVPs is \"unsettled\" does nothing to upset the\nconclusion that Plaintiffs have alleged violations of some of the most well-\nestablished protections afforded by the Constitution. A number of the cases cited\nby Defendants arise within the context of challenges to commitment statutes, either\nfacially or as applied, but do not concern challenges to public officials'\nimplementation of such commitment statutes. See Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407,\n122 S. Ct. 867, 151 L. Ed. 2d 856 (2002); Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250 (2001);\nKansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 117 S. Ct. 2072, 138 L. Ed. 2d 501 (1997);\nWoodward v. Mayber_;, 242 F. Supp. 2d 695 (N.D. Cal. 2003)); Hubbart v.\nSuperior Court, 19 Cal. 4th 1138, 81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 492 (1999); People v. Hurtado,\n28 Cal. 4th1179, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d 186 (2002); People v. Superior Court (Ghilotti),\n27 Cal. 4th888, 119Cal. Rptr. 2d 1 (2002). Others arise within a prison context\nand are therefore ineffective to establish the outer limits of the rights to be afforded\ncivilly committed patients within a state hospital. See Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d\n1166, 1172 (9'hCir. 2000) (\"[T]he state must.., provide the civilly-committed\nwith 'more considerate treatment and conditions of confinement than criminals\nwhose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.'\") (_ Youngberg v.\nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 322, 102 S. Ct. 2452, 2461, 73 L. Ed. 2d 28, 41 (1982));\ncompare, e.__.,McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 122 S. Ct. 2017, 153 L. Ed. 2d 47\n(2002) (addressing inmate rights in prison context); Thielman v. Leean, 282 F.3d\n478 (7thCir. 2002) (same); Kulas v. Valdez, 159 F.3d 453 (9thCir. 1998)\n26\n\n(addressing fights of prisoner awaiting trial); Munoz v. Kolender, 208 F. Supp. 2d\n1125 (S.D. Cal. 2002) (addressing jail confinement). The remaining cases cited by\nDefendants are either not good law, see In re Calhoun, 112 Cal. App. 4th 1262, 6\nCal. Rptr. 3d 34 (2003) vacated by 85 P.3d 2, 10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 205 (Cal. 2004), or\nare simply ineffective to support their claimed qualified immunity defense.\nThe primary fault in Defendants' reasoning is that they misconstrue the\nbaseline from which it is to be determined if the fights which Plaintiffs allege have\nbeen violated are \"clearly established.\" Defendants suggest that they are to be held\nliable for violations of Plaintiffs' constitutional fights only if such fights have been\nclearly established within cases arising within the narrow context of sex offender\ncommitment statutes. This is simply not the case. See Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S.\n730, 741,122 S. Ct. 2508, 2516, 153 L. Ed. 2d 666, 679 (\"'[G]eneral statements of\nthe law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning, and in other\ninstances a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question, even though 'the\nvery action in question has [not] previously been held unlawful.'... [O]fficials\ncan still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel\nfactual circumstances '\") (_ United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 117 S. Ct.\n1219, 137 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997)). As the Supreme Court stated in the paragraph of\nthe Supreme Court's decision in Anderson which Defendants cite (see Appellants'\nBr. at 19): \"This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified\nimmunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,\n[citation]; but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must\nbe apparent.\" 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S. Ct. at 3039, 97 L. Ed. 2d at 531 (citations\nomitted); see also Ostlund v. Bobb, 825 F.2d 1371, 1374 (9thCir. 1987) (stating\nthat the \"clearly established\" standard \"does not require specific binding precedent\nto show that a fight is clearly established\"). Given the firmly established law\n27\n\napplicable to the rights afforded confined individuals in general, and civilly\ncommitted mental health patients in particular, this standard is clearly satisfied in\nthis case. 4\nWhile the constitutionality of sex offender civil commitment statutes and\ntreatment programs is currently a matter of much debate, it is not subject to debate\nthat Plaintiffs are to be protected from unreasonable use of involuntary restraints,\nseclusion and medication other than in those rare circumstances permitted by the\nlaw. Se.___ee._eg,_.,Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 221, 110 S. Ct. 1028, 1036,\n108 L. Ed. 2d 178, 197-98 (1990) (prisoners have a liberty interest in avoiding the\nunwanted administration of anti-psychotic drugs); Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S.\n307, 316, 102 S. Ct. 2452, 2458, 73 L.

Rptr. 3d 780 (2004)\n(California constitutional rights to both privacy and bodily integrity are implicated\nwhen civil commitments are forcibly medicated with anti-psychotic drugs).

Further, Plaintiffs also note that a substantial number of the\nPlaintiffs' Class have yet to be committed pursuant to the SVP Act; thus, those\nPlaintiffs have even greater rights than civilly committed individuals.\n28\n\nretaliation by a state actor against an individual's exercise of his First Amendment\nrights is actionable under Section 1983); se___a_lseo Bounds v.

Donovan, 51\nF.3d 894 (9thCir. 1995) (access to courts). Nor may Plaintiffs be subjected to\nunreasonable searches or improper seizures of personal belongings. Se.__e\nMichenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir. 1997) (strip searches may not\nbe excessive, vindictive or harassing). Most importantly, because Plaintiffs are\ncivil commitments, they may not be subject to living conditions which are devoid\nof dignity and in many instances worse than the conditions under which penal\ncommitments and prisoners are held.\nIn sum, the policies, practices and procedures implemented by Defendants\nand for which Defendants have primary responsibility have resulted in violations\nof all of the above constitutionally protected rights. As such, Defendants' reliance\nupon Crawford-E1 v. Britton is misplaced.\nC. Whether Defendants' Conduct Was Nevertheless Reasonable Is A\nQuestion Of Fact Not Properly Adjudicated Upon A Motion To Dismiss.\nDefendants further contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity\nbecause they reasonably could have believed that their conduct was lawful.\nAppellants' Br. at 21-26. The question of objective reasonableness is the second\ninquiry under the two-part qualified immunity analysis. The burden is on\nDefendants to show that a reasonable official could have believed, in light of the\nsettled law, that he or she was not violating a constitutional law. See Alford v.\nHaner, 333 F.3d 972, 977 (9thCir. 2003). As discussed above, however, this issue\nis a question of fact that cannot be adjudicated at the pleading stage.\n29\n\nIndeed, Defendants' main source of authority, Crawford-E1 v. Britton, was a\nsummary judgment case and the Court was concerned solely with the issue of the\namount of proof required of a plaintiff to overcome a qualified immunity defense\nraised in a motion for summary judgment. 523 U.S. at 577-78, 118 S. Ct. at 1587,\n140 L. Ed. 2d at 767. In fact, the Court recognized that a determination of whether\na defendant is entitled to qualified immunity may involve a significant factual\ninquiry. See id. at 598, 118 S. Ct. at 1597, 140 L. Ed. 2d at 779-80.\nPlaintiffs have adequately alleged that Defendants have violated a number of\nPlaintiffs' most fundamental rights. That is all that is required. Whether\nDefendants' conduct was nevertheless reasonable involves a factual analysis of the\ncircumstances surrounding Defendants' actions and a determination of whether a\nreasonable official similarly situated would have been aware that his/her actions\nviolated the law. While Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants' actions were not\nreasonable, notwithstanding clearly established law, it is clear that any debate upon\nthis issue will require the Court to delve into the facts underlying this case.\nDefendants cannot escape liability by summarily contending, without adequate\nfactual development, that their actions were \"objectively reasonable.\"\nD. Defendants' Purported Compliance With AD 602 Does Not Bar\nPlaintiffs' Constitutional Challenges.\nDefendants' sole basis for contending that they acted objectively reasonable\nis their argument concerning ASH Administrative Directive 602. Defendants\nappear to argue that, because Plaintiffs concede that this is a policy at ASH, and\nbecause this policy seeks to protect the very rights Plaintiffs say were violated,\nDefendants could not knowingly have violated these rights. Appellants' Br. at 24-\n26. In other words, Defendants posit that merely by instituting a policy that\nrecognizes patient rights, Defendants are immunized fi'om liability for violating the\nrights that policy ostensibly protects. The absurdity of this argument is self-\n30\n\nevident. The mere fact a policy exists does not mean it was implemented or that\nDefendants did not knowingly oversee, condone or ignore its violation.\nIndeed, that Administrative Directive 602 may recite a laundry list of patient\nrights has no bearing on whether and to what extent that policy or any other is\napplied in accordance with the federal Constitution. Nor does it indicate\ncompliance. Despite Defendants' claim that Plaintiffs \"do not dispute\nAdministrative Directive 602 and do not allege that it is not applied as a policy at\nASH\" (Appellants' Br. at 24), the Second Amended Complaint clearly alleges that\nthis policy - and the numerous other policies, practices and procedures at ASH -\nare applied (or misapplied) in such a fashion as to result in numerous violations of\nPlaintiffs' constitutional rights. ER 476-480, ¶¶47-68. For example, paragraph 47\nof the Second Amended Complaint clearly states: \"In practice, all of the\npreviously mentioned rights and privileges are restricted and denied as a means to\npunish SVPs who object to mandatory treatment, arbitrary rules and disciplinary\nprocedures, as well as to punish SVPs for filing this and other lawsuits challenging\nconditions of their confinement.\" Paragraph 48 states: \"In contrast to ASH's\nAdministrative Directives previously discussed, Defendants' policies, practices and\ncustoms permit and encourage the involuntary medication of SVPs with\npsychotropic drugs in non-emergency situations for the convenience of staff and as\na means of punishment.\" Paragraph 52 states: \"Defendants' policies, practices\nand customs disregard the rights of SVPs by allowing and encouraging.., punitive\nand improper conditions of confinement.\"\nBecause Plaintiffs clearly allege that the policies, practices and procedures at\nASH - including Administrative Directive 602 - are applied in such a mariner as to\nresult in numerous violations of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights, Defendants'\nargument with regard to Administrative Directive 602 is without merit.\n31\n\nXII.\nTHE DOCTRINE OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY DOES NOT BAR\nPLAINTIFFS' SPECIFIC CLAIMS\nA. Plaintiffs Have Sufficiently Pied Claims for First Amendment Violations\n(First Alleged Claim).\n1. Plaintiffs' Allegations Rise Above Mere \"Conclusory\" Allegations.\nWith regard to Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim, contrary to Defendants'\ncontention, the Second Amended Complaint states more than mere \"conclusory\"\nallegations, and Plaintiffs' allegations meet the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. (8)\nto put Defendants on notice as to what is being alleged, s\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants have created and implemented policies,\npractices and procedures directed at silencing SVPs. For example, SVPs\nexperience access-level reductions, administrative segregation and loss of library\naccess in retaliation for this and other lawsuits. In addition, SVPs who participate\nin lawsuits are not protected from physical and sexual abuse by penal\ncommitments held at ASH. ER 476, ¶47; 485, ¶98.\nIn arguing that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for retaliation under the\nFirst Amendment, Defendants rely on ACLU v. Wicomico County, 999 F.2d 780\n(4'h Cir. 1993) and Huang v. Board of Governors, 902 F.2d 1134 (4thCir. 1990).\nThat reliance is misplaced, as those cases involved disposition of plaintiffs' claims\nupon summary judgment - after full development of the factual record - and are,\nas such, distinguishable from the case at hand. At this point in the litigation, the\nTo satisfy Rule 8, a pleading must give fair notice of the claim being asserted\nand the grounds upon which it rests. The rules of pleading require only that the\nallegations in the complaint \"sufficiently establish a basis for judgrnent against\nthe defendant_' Yamaguchi v. United States Dept. of the Air Force, 109 F.3d\n1475, 1481 (9 Cir. 1997). .\n32\n\nCourt must determine only whether the facts as alleged would entitle the plaintiff\nto a legal remedy. United States v. White, 893 F. Supp. 1423, 1428 (C.D. Cal.\n1995). Moreover, the issue addressed in Huang is inapposite. That case involved\nthe protected speech of public employees - an issue not remotely related to those\nnow before the Court. 6\nNevertheless, Plaintiffs have stated a claim for retaliation. Courts have held\nthat retaliation claims state a valid cause of action under Section 1983.7 To prevail\non a claim for retaliation, a prisoner must \"allege that he was retaliated against for\nexercising his constitutional rights and that the retaliatory action does not advance\nlegitimate penological goals, such as preserving institutional order and discipline.\"\nBarnett v. Centoni, 31 F.3d 813,816 (9thCir. 1994), _ Rizzo v. Dawson, 778\nF.2d 527, 532 (9thCir. 1985).\nIt is well established that members of the SVP class are entitled to certain\nFirst Amendment rights. For instance, Plaintiffs have the right to assemble\npeaceably, 8access the courts, 9petition the government,'° and refuse treatment. 't\n6 Defendants also make passingreference to In re Calhoun, 112 Cal. App. 4th\n1262, 6 Cal. Rptr. 3d 34(2003) and McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 204, 122 S. Ct.\n2017, 153 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2002). Appe!lants'Br. at .26.. However, neither of\nthese cases concerns Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.

ER 478, ¶57. This intimidation\naffects all members of the class,whether they have been subject to the behavior or\nnot. Members of the class arealsosubject to excessive room searches and seizure\nof property regardless of their individual security risk because of their participation\nin this and other lawsuits. ER 481, ¶75. Finally, Plaintiffs allege that SVPs are\npunished for filing this and other lawsuits challenging the conditions of\nconfinement at ASH. ER 476, ¶47.\nThese policies and practices do not advance legitimate security or\ntherapeutic interests. They are enforced to retaliate against members of the SVP\nclass for exercising their First Amendment rights. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have\nclearly stated a claim for violation of their First Amendment rights.\n_nenological interests. Jones et al. v.

Clearly Established Free Speech Rights Preclude Finding Of\nQualified Immunity.\nDefendants contend that \"[t]he allegations are not such that a reasonable\nofficial in Defendants' position would have known that their actions, even if all\nallegations are accepted as true, violated constitutional standards for treatment of\nSVPs.\" Appellants' Br. at 26. But the Ninth Circuit has already found that certain\nFirst Amendment rights are so clearly established that they preclude qualified\nimmunity. InDuran v. City of Douglas, 904 F.2d 1372, 1378 (9 taCir. 1990), the\ncourt stated the following:\nWhether or not the officer . . . was aware of the fine\npoints of First Amendment law, to the extent he is found\nto have detained [plaintiff] as punishment for the latter's\ninsults, we hold that he ougtit to have known he was\nexercising his authority in violation of well-established\nconstitutional rights.\nLike the plaintiff in Duran, Plaintiffs in this case enjoy the well-known\nbenefits of free speech when they state their belief that they do not have an illness,\nneed treatment or when they file lawsuits regarding the conditions at ASH.\nMoreover, it is untenable that Defendants could believe they may tolerate or\nencourage the punishment of those patients who exercise such rights._2 Thus,\n_2 In Allen v. Saki, 40 F.3d 1001 (9 th Cir. 1994), the Ninth Circuit determined that\ndefendants were not entitled to qualified immunity because it was clearly\nsettle.d that prisoners had a right to access the courts and, counsel. The court\nstated tlaat although there was no case directly on point, it does not require\nsophisticated 'legal scholarship' to know that a plaintiff's access to the courts\ncould be hindere_t, seriously b3_an inability to make multiple, accurate copies of\nlegal documents. Id. at 1005. Similarly, it does not require such analysis to\nkriow that by prohib-iiing SVPs from accessing the law l_rary, using ttie copy\nmachine, and corresoon_ling privately with counsel (without alternative\naccommodations), Plaintiff_ would be hindered in their ability to prepare for\ntheir probable cause and commitment hearings. This inability to prepare for\nupcoming hearings would clearly hinder Plaintiffs' access to the courts and\ncounsel. -While Plaintiffs recognize that it might be acceptable to limit access\nto the courts where an individual acts violently or poses a danger to himself or\nothers, it does not follow that it is reasonable t'or any official to believe that\n35\n\nDefendants should not begranted qualified immunity for suchconduct. Moreover,\nany determination of the reasonableness of Defendants' actions requires resolution\nof factual questions and, as such, should be made only after full development of\nthe factual record.\nFinally, Defendants' reliance on McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 122 S. Ct.\n2017, 153 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2002), for the proposition that SVPs are not entitled to\nprivileges if they choose not to participate in treatment while confined is\nmisplaced. Appellants' Br. at 26. As discussed further below, the McKune\ndecision is clearly distinguishable from this case. McKune arose in the prison\ncontext. The plurality opinion turned on the fact that there was a valid conviction\nwith ensuing restrictions on liberty that such a conviction entails. SVPs, however,\nare not penal commitments and are to be afforded greater protection of their rights\nand privileges than prisoners. Nothing within the SVP Act permits the State to\ntreat Plaintiffs in the same fashion as prisoners. It is implausible that Defendants\ncould believe that SVPs could be treated in the same manner as prisoners.\nB. Defendants Are Not Entitled To Qualified Immunity On Plaintiffs'\nSecond Alleged Claim (Fourth Amendment Violation).\nIn challenging Plaintiffs' Second Alleged Claim, Defendants incorrectly\nassume that involuntary civil commitments enjoy no greater rights under the\nFourth Amendment than prisoners or pretrial criminal detainees. Proceeding on\nthis assumption, Defendants then argue that, because the need for safety and\nsecurity in prisons has been held to justify intrusions on prisoners' Fourth\nAmendment rights, it follows that the need for safety and security in hospitals\nautomatically justifies intruding upon the Fourth Amendment rights of patients\naccess to the courts and counsel may be conditioned upon a oatient's\nattendance at a treatment session wfiich requires the acknowledgement of an\nillness or need for treatment.\n36\n\nhoused at ASH. Appellants' Br. at 28-3 I.\nI. Plaintiffs Have A Right To Be Free From Unreasonable Searches\nAnd Seizures.\nThe Fourth Amendment rights of involuntary civil commitments cannot be\nequated with the limited rights of prisoners or pretrial criminal detaineesJ 3 Unlike\nprisoners, civil commitments are not confined for the purpose of punishment, but\nrather they are confined for the purpose of receiving treatment. Also, unlike\nprisoners and pretrial criminal detainees, Plaintiffs are not housed in a criminal\ninstitution, but rather a hospital. There can be no doubt that patients in a mental\ninstitution have greater Fourth Amendment rights than incarcerated individuals.\nFurthermore, Defendants purposely ignore that not all Plaintiffs have actually been\ncommitted; many patients referred to by Defendants as SVPs are actually being\nconfined on mere \"probable cause\" or less. Without having been legally\ncommitted, these Plaintiffs have even greater rights and higher interests to enjoy\nthe freedoms granted by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nBecause Plaintiffs, as civil commitments, clearly enjoy greater Fourth\nAmendment rights than prisoners, the fact that the State's interest in maintaining\nsafety and security in prisons may justify limiting the Fourth Amendment rights of\nprisoners does not mean that ASH's asserted interest in safety and security\naut.omatically justifies infringing on the Fourth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs.\nNot surprisingly, Defendants have failed to cite, and Plaintiffs cannot find, any\n13\nDefendants cite Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 97 S. Ct. 1491, 52 L. Ed. 2d 72\n(1977), for the proposition that \"a mental patient's rights are sometimes\nanalogous to those of prisoners.\" Aooellants' Br. at 29. But Bounds does not\neven address the issue of unreasonabre searches of mental pa_ather, the\ncase aaaresses the right otprison inmates to access the courts and Orison law\nlibraries. Bounds makes no mention of either mental patients nor the Fourth\nAmenament right to oe protected from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n37\n\ncase law which supports Defendants' claim that a hospital's interest in safety and\nsecurity automatically supersedes all of its civilly committed patients' Fourth\nAmendment rights.\nMoreover, the test for whether particular searches or seizures are\n\"reasonable,\" as guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment, involves a\nfactual inquiry that is not properly resolved in a motion to dismiss. As Defendants\nconcede:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment\nis not capable of precise definition or mechanical\napplication. In each case it requires a balancing of the\nneed for the part.icular search against the invasion of\npersonal rights tlaat the search entails. Courts must\nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner\nin which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it,\nand the place in which it is conducted.\nAppellants' Br. at 30 (_ Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559).\nHere, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' policies, practices and customs\nsubject SVPs to unreasonable searches and seizures, and the unreasonable use of\nforce. For example, SVPs are subjected to degrading public strip searches and the\nuse of four-point restraints when they arrive at ASH. Also, SVPs arbitrarily have\ntheir personal belongings seized. ER 476-477, ¶¶64 & 65. The \"reasonableness\"\nof such retaliatory seizures and public strip searches should not be decided without\nfurther discovery; thus, the Fourth Amendment Claim should not be dismissed.\n2. Clearly Established Search And Seizure Law Precludes Findine\nOf Qualified Immunity.\nAs Defendants concede, it is clearly established that prisoners have a Fourth\nAmendment right to be free from unreasonable searches. Appellants' Br. at 30\n(quoting Michenfelder v. Summer, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9 thCir. 1988)). It is also\nclearly established that Plaintiffs as \"[p]ersons who have been involuntarily\n38\n\ncommitted are entitled to more considerate treatment and conditions of\nconfinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to\npunish.\" Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 321-22, 102 S. Ct. 2452, 73 L. Ed.\n2d 28 (1982). Accordingly, a reasonable official would know that Plaintiffs have a\ngreater expectation of privacy than prisoners.\nFurthermore, it is also clearly established that searches and seizures cannot\nbe based on mere distaste for an individual. For example, the Ninth Circuit has\nheld that, \"no matter how peculiar, abrasive, unruly or distasteful a person's\nconduct may be, it cannot justify a police stop unless it suggests that some specific\ncrime has been, or is about to be, committed, or that there is an imminent danger to\npersons or property.\" Duran, 904 F.2d at 1378. Duran establishes the principle\nthat distasteful conduct, in and of itself, does not justify searches and seizures. A\nreasonable official would know that such a principle applies regardless of the\nsetting (e.__.,police stop or psychiatric hospital). Accordingly, the fact that SVPs\nrefuse therapy that requires them to admit a need for treatment and/or participate in\nlawsuits does not, in and of itself, justify excessive room searches, increased\nseizures of legal documents and/or mandatory public strip searches while in four-\npoint restraints. Plaintiffs have alleged violations of clearly established law.\nC. Plaintiffs' Claims Are Not Barred By McKune v. Lile.\nDefendants argue that, following the Supreme Court's recent decision in\nMcKune v. Liie, Plaintiffs are barred from raising First and Fifth Amendment\ncauses of action to the extent that such claims rely upon the fact that Plaintiffs, as a\npart of the phase therapy program at ASH, are required to sign a contract by which\nthey agree that they have a \"problem\" or \"illness\" requiring treatment. Appellants'\nBr. at 31-33. Defendants' argument fails for a number of reasons.\n39\n\nFirst, andmost importantly, the holding in McKune is inapplicable to this\ncase. In McKune, the Court addressed a plaintiff's claim that the threat of lost\nprivileges for refusal to admit past criminal acts as part of a sex offender treatment\nprogram within the Kansas state prison system violated his Fifth Amendment\nprivilege against self-incrimination. McKune, 536 U.S. at 29, 122 S. Ct. at 2022,\n153 L. Ed. 2d at 54. But, as explained to Defendants during the meet and confer\nprocess, Plaintiffs in this case have not raised a cause of action based upon this\nFifth Amendment privilege and, therefore, the judgment of the Court in McKune is\nirrelevant to this litigation.\nFurthermore, to the extent that Defendants argue that the Court's reasoning\nin McKune is nevertheless relevant despite the absence of such a claim, this\nargument disregards the clear emphasis which the plurality opinion placed upon\nthe prison context from which tlae case arose. _4As stated by Justice Kennedy in\nthe plurality opinion, \"[t]he fact that these consequences are imposed on prisoners,\nrather than ordinary citizens,.., is important in weighing respondent's\nconstitutional claim .... [T]he fact of a valid conviction and the ensuing\nrestrictions on liberty are essential to the Fifth Amendment analysis.\" Id__a_t_3_6.,\n122 S. Ct. at 2026, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 58-59. While Defendants blindly argue to the\ncontrary, the prison context from which McKune arose clearly distinguishes that\ncase from this litigation. Plaintiffs in this ease are not penal commitments. Rather,\nthey have been civilly committed for the express purpose of treatment.15 Se.__Ceeal.\n14\nThere was no majority opinion in McKune, as the Justices failed to come to a\nmajority agreement upon the apphea'Efib-TUFfthAmendment standard. The\njudgment ot the Court was agreed upon by five Justices, and only four Justices\njoined in the plurality opinion to wli]ch Defendants cite.\n15\nPlaintiffs again note that a significant number of the Plaintiffs' class have yet\nto even be committed and2as such, they are at best more closely aligned with\npretrial detainees than with prisoners.\n4O\n\nWelf. & Inst. Code §§ 6604, 6606. Nothing within the SVP Act nor the\nConstitution permits the Stateto treat Plaintiffs in the samefashion asprisoners.\nAs opposedto the pervasive restrictions upon personal liberty inherent in penal\ncommitment, the Supreme Court hasexpressly held that civilly committed patients\nheld within Statecustody must beafforded greaterprotection of their rights and\nprivileges than that afforded prisoners. Therefore, thebalance theMcKune\nplurality struck between a plaintiff's personal liberties and the State's interest in\nconfinement and rehabilitation of prisoners does not apply here.\nAlso, the plurality in McKune did not interpret Kansas's past-acts-\nadmission requirement and the resulting loss of privileges for failure to participate\nin treatment as a constitutionally viable system of rewards and punishment. To the\ncontrary, and as expressly stated by Justice Kennedy:\n[n]o one contends . . . that the transfer [to a maximum\nsecurity facility for failure to participate in treatment] is\nintended to pm?ish prisoners for exercising their Fifth\nAmendment kignts. Ratner_ the limitation on these rights\nis incidental to Kansas' leglt.imate penological reason for\nthe transfer: Due to limitea space, inmates who do not\nparticipate in their respective programs will be moved\nout otthe .facility wlaere the programs are held to make\nroom tor other inmates [who wish to participate].\nId.__a_t_3.8, 122 S. Ct. at 2027, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 60.\nDespite the McKune plurality's emphasis upon the fact that the plaintiff's\nloss of privileges in that case was not a matter of punishment but rather merely a\nresult of prison housing limitations, Defendants argue that McKune justifies ASH's\npunishment of those Plaintiffs who refuse to participate in the phase therapy\nprogram at ASH. This argument goes well beyond what theCourt upheld in\nMcKune, and attempts to justify a system which clearly amounts to coerced\ntreatment. ASH's reduction of Plaintiffs' privileges for refusal to sign the contract\nand to participate in phase therapy cannot be justified as a mere consequence of\n41\n\nadministrative concerns or housing limitations at ASH. Defendants have not, and\ncannot, make any showing that the punishments levied against Plaintiffs for refusal\nto participate in the phase therapy program are anything other than that - a\npunishment. Rather, as admitted by Defendants, privileges at ASH are awarded or\ndenied to individual Plaintiffs in many instances based solely upon whether the\nindividual signs the contract at issue and consents to treatment. Appellants' Br. at\n32-33. Thus, Plaintiffs are faced with the choice: admit illness, waive\nconfidentiality, and risk incrimination in order to proceed in the therapy program at\nASH, or refuse to agree to such terms and thus be excluded from the therapy\nprogram and face a loss of privileges. Regardless of the Supreme Court's\nconstruction of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in\nMcKune, this system of rewards and punishment goes astray of the Constitution's\nprotections against compelled treatment of civil commitments and undermines the\nstated goal of effective treatment of the Section 6600 population.\nFinally, it should be noted that in McKune the plurality emphasized that\n\"respondent's decision not to participate in [treatment] did not extend his term of\nincarceration.\" McKune, 536 U.S. at 38, 122 S. Ct. at 2027, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 60.\nMoreover, in her concurrence, which provided the decisional majority, Justice\nO'Conner expressly concluded that penalties which create longer incarceration for\nexercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege went over the constitutional line,\nstating:\nThe penalties potentially faced in these [penalty] cases -\nlonger incarceration and execution - are far greater than\nthose we have already held to constitute unconstitutional\ncompulsion in the penalty cases. Indeed, the imposition\nof such outcomes as a penalty for refusing to incriminate\noneself would surely implicate a 'liberty interest.'\nId__a_t_.52, 122 S. Ct. at 2034-35, 153 L. Ed. 2d at 69. Thus, according to at least six\nmembers of the Court, the exaction of a penalty of longer incarceration for\n42\n\nremaining silent about prior sexual history violates the Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst self incrimination.\nUnlike the treatment program at issue in McKune, the treatment program\ncurrently being implemented by Defendants at ASH does extend incarceration for\nthose SVPs who refuse to participate in treatment on Fifth Amendment grounds.\nAs set out in the Second Amended Complaint, in order to progress through the\nvarious phases of treatment, SVPs are required to sign a statement acknowledging\nthat they have a \"problem\" or \"illness\" and need \"help\" or \"treatment\" at ASH.\nER 475, ¶43; 477, ¶51. Understandably, many SVPs refuse to sign such a\nstatement because, if they do, the signed statement is used against the individual\nSVP in his probable-cause hearing. But, the consequence for such a refusal is an\nindefinitely extended incarceration, since in order to attain release under\nDefendants' policies, an SVP must advance through all the phases of treatment.\nAccordingly, even if McKune were applicable to this litigation, which it is not, its\nholding would not support the treatment program currently in effect at ASH.\nD. Defendants Are Not Entitled To Qualified Immunity On Plaintiffs'\nSixth Alleged Claim (Procedural Due Process Violations).\n1. Plaintiffs' Protected Liberty And Property. Interests.\nDefendants challenge Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process claims on the\nground that Plaintiffs have not adequately pled the loss of established liberty or\nproperty interests in the access-level reductions, restrictions on movement, forced\nmedication and confiscation of their belongings. Defendants attempt to justify\nwhatever actions they take on the ground that Plaintiffs are \"felons\" who are, \"by\nstatutory definition,\" unsafe. Appellants' Br. at 35. As this argument itself\nevidences, the policies, practices and procedures implemented and administered by\nDefendants at ASH operate in complete disregard of the Plaintiffs' Due Process\n43\n\nrights and contribute to an environment wherein the desire to punish Plaintiffs\noverrules Defendants' duty not to violate the rights and protections afforded to\nPlaintiffs by the Constitution. 16 Contrary to Defendants' claims otherwise,\nDefendants' policies, practices and procedures violate Plaintiffs' clearly\nestablished liberty and property interests.\na. Right To Refuse Medication\nIn Washington v. Harper, the Supreme Court held that prisoners possess \"a\nsignificant liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychofic\ndrugs under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" 494 U.S. at\n221-22, 110 S. Ct. at 1036, 108 L. Ed. 2d at 198. The Court further held that\nprocedures which provide for an independent decision maker, notice, right to be\npresent at a fair hearing, and a fight to present and cross-examine witnesses\ncomported with due process. 17 In Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166, 123 S. Ct.\n2174, 2184, 156 L. Ed. 2d 197 i2003), the Supreme Court held that the government\nmay only involuntarily administer antipsychotic drugs to a mentally ill pretrial\ndetainee in order to render that pretrial detainee competent to stand trial if the\ntreatment is medically appropriate, substantially unlikely to have side effects that\nmay undermine the fairness of the trial, and, taking account of less intrusive\nalternatives, significantly necessary to further important governmental trial related\nDefendants' reliance on Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L.\nEd. 2d 606 (1996) (Appellants' Br. at 33) is misplaced. Lewis did not involve\na 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss or consider the relevant pleading standard.\nMoreover, that case addressed the rights of prison inmates, not civil\ncommitments confined pursuant to a civil statute and held in a state hospital.\nId. at 355, 116 S. Ct. at2183, 135 L. Ed. 2d at 620 (stating that impairment of\n_itigating capacity is simply one of the incidental (and perfectly constitutional)\nconsequences of conviction and incarceration. ).\n17\nCourts have also prescribed a procedure for p.atients who do not wish to take\nantipsychotic medication that revolves consultation with theoatient, review by\nother professional staff and the institution s and submission of the case to the\nmedical director. Se.__eee.,__., Rennie v. Klein, 720 F.2d 266 (3 Cir. 1983).\n44\n\ninterests. Finally, in United States v. Williams, 356 F.3d 1045, 1055-56 (9thCir.\n2004), the Ninth Circuit held that due process prohibits a court from requiring a\nparolee to take antipsychotic medication as a condition of supervisedrelease\nwithout first making findings on a medically informed record supporting the need\nfor medication.\nThus, at a minimum, it has been established that in non-emergency\nsituations, a patient has a right to procedural due process before being forced to\ntake certain types of medication. The Second Amended Complaint alleges forced\nmedication without due process of law, and describes what is factually lacking\nfrom Defendants' procedures. ER 476, ¶48; 483, ¶87. Defendants' request for\nmore facts, including the \"whys\" and \"hows\" of these due process violations, is a\nrequest to prove a negative; the point is, Defendants have not provided the\nnecessary constitutional safeguards when depriving Plaintiffs of their property and\nliberty.\nb. State-Created Interest In Patient Access Levels\nA state statute or regulation can also create protected due process interests.\nFor example, a California statute providing that a prisoner's sentence may be\nreduced for good behavior creates a constitutionally protected liberty interest.\nToussaint v. McCarthy, 801 F.2d 1080, 1097-98 (9th Cir. 1986). Similarly, the\nSupreme Court has held that the transfer of a prisoner from the general population\nto administrative segregation deprived the prisoner of a state-created liberty\ninterest. Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 470-71,103 S. Ct. 864, 871, 74 L. Ed. 2d\n675,687-88 (1983), modified by Sandin v. Connor, 515 U.S. 472, 115 S. Ct. 2293,\n132 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1995). The liberty interest at issue in Hewitt was created by\nstate law regulating the discretion of prison officials when ordering such transfers.\nThe state statute authorized such transfers.only when it was determined that the\npresence of the inmate in the general population posed a serious threat of harm to\n45\n\nthe inmate or others. Id_._T_.he Court concluded that a liberty interest is created\nwhenever a state statute uses explicitly mandatory language - such as \"shall\" - \"in\nconnection with requiring specific substantive predicates\" for action. Id__a_t_4.72.\nThe SVPs at ASH have a similar state-created liberty interest. The reduction\nof an SVP's access level is, in effect, a transfer from the general population at ASH\nto an administrative-segregation unit where privileges, law library access and the\nability to exercise are reduced or prohibited. Califomia Code of Regulations, Title\n22, § 71001 et sech.(\"§ 71001 et seq:.\"), regulates the licensing and certification of\nacute psychiatric hospitals, and forms the basis of state-created protected interests.\nLike the state statute described in Hewitt limiting the discretion of prison officials,\n§ 71001 et sech.also uses explicitly mandatory language, such as \"shall,\" in\nlimiting the discretion of hospital administrators when reducing or altering\npatients' rights and conditions._S Insofar as the SVP Act requires Defendants to\nMore specifically, § 71507 creates a variety of protected interests by. stating\nat patients shall have rights which include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing: 1) to wear his own clothes, to keep and use his own personal\npossessions including toilet articles and to keep and be allowed to spend a\nreasonable sum of his own money for canteen expenses and small purchases; 2)\nto have access to individual storage space for his private use; 3) to see visitors\neach day; 4) to have reasonable access to telephones, both to make and receive\nconfidential calls; 5) to have ready access to letter writing materials, including\nstamps, and to mail and receive unopened corresp_ondencel 6) to refuse shock\ntreatment; 7) to refuse psychosurgery; 8) to be informed of the provisions of\nlaw regarding complaints and of procedures for registering complaints\nconfidentially_ including, but notlimited to, the address and telephone number\not the complaint receiving unit of the Department; 9) all other rights as\nprovided by. law or regulation. 22 CCR §71507. Furthermore, under § 71507,\nonly a physician mayTor good cause deny. a joerson these rights. Section 71545\nalso creates a protected lilSerty interest in being free from unreasonable\nrestraints by statingthat: a) restraints shall be used only when alternative\nmethods are not sufficient to protect the patient or others from injury; b)\npatients shall be placed in restraint only on the written order of the physician.\nThat order shall include the reason for restraint and the type of restraint to be\nused. In a clear case of emergency., a patient may be placed in restraint at the\ndiscretion of a registered nurse and a verbal or written order obtained\nthereafter. If a verbal order is obtained it shall be recorded in the patient's\nmedical record and signed by the physician on his next visit; c) patients in\n46\n\ncomply with \"current institutional standards,\" asDefendants admit, this setof state\nregulations, aswell asothers, is instructive (andextremely fact-intensive).\nLikewise, theseregulations endow ASH patients with certain protected liberty\ninterests. The SVPs atASH haveaprotected interest in the rights andprivileges\nregulated by the patient accesssystem(\"PAS\"), for example, andan access-level\nreduction requires certain dueprocessprocedures. Having thus createdthese\nrights, theDefendants may not take away theserights without dueprocess.\nc. Atypical And Significant Hardship\nIn Sandin v. Connor, 515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S. Ct. 2293, 2300,\n132 L. Ed. 2d 418,429-30 (1995), the Supreme Court held that prison inmates\nhave a state-created liberty interest where a restriction \"imposes atypical and\nsignificant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison\nlife.\" Similarly, in this case, reduction to access \"level one\" means that an SVP\ncannot leave his unit for any reason without an individual escort. ER 474, ¶38.\nThis restriction imposes an atypical and significant hardship in relation to the more\nordinary incidents of life at ASH, which allow individuals to access the law library,\nexercise facilities, and canteen without any type of escort. Because these\nrestrictions impose atypical and significant hardships in relation to the ordinary\nincidents of hospital life, the PAS system constitutes a state-created liberty\ninterest. _9\n.\nrestraint by seclusion or mechanical means shall be observed at intervals not\ngreater than l5 minutes; d) restraints shall be easily removable in the event of\nfire or other emergency. Section 71619 states that \"a method of assuring\nprivacy, for each p,atient shall be maintained in patient rooms and in tub, shower\nano toilet rooms. Id___.:\n19\nDefendants improperly rely on the finding in Sandin that the assignment to\nsegregated h.ousmg\" did' not impose\" atyolcal _.-afnfff._-gqi.fica,n,t. hardships on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary, incidents of prison life. Although this\nholding may clarify what constitutes such hardships in comparison to ordinary\nprisonqife, _tdoes not address the factual issues regarding what constitutes\n47\n\nd. Reclassification\nIn Bamett v. Centoni, 31 F.3d 813,815-16 (9th Cir. 1994), the Ninth Circuit\nheld that a prison inmate was deprived of liberty and property because he was\nreclassified to a \"Grade B,\" thereby losing certain privileges. Just as the inmate in\nthat case had liberty and property interest in his classification level, the SVPs have\nliberty and property interest in their access levels. Due process requires that prison\nofficials provide inmates with notice of the charges against them and an\nopportunity to present their views to the prison official charged with deciding\nwhether inmates should be reclassified or transferred to administrative segregation.\nId___J_u.st as due process requires that inmates be given notice and an opportunity to\npresent their views before being reclassified, SVPs should also be given these same\nopportunities before an access level is reduced. However, Defendants' policies,\npractices and procedures tolerate and encourage access-level reductions, without\nsupplying these procedural safeguards. ER 483, ¶87. Thus, Plaintiffs' due process\nclaims should not be dismissed.\n2. Clearly Established Right To Refuse Medication Precludes\nFinding Of Qualified Immunity.\nDefendants rely on McKune v. Lile in arguing that Plaintiffs' right to refuse\nforced medication is not clearly established. This reliance is entirely misplaced, as\nMcKune in no way addresses issues of whether civil commitments have a\nprotected liberty interest in avoiding forced medication. Rather, as already\ndiscussed above, McKune concerns solely the issue of the Fifth Amendment as a\nlimitation on compelled confessions to past criminal acts as part of a treatment\nprogram in prison. What is at issue in Plaintiffs' Sixth Alleged Claim is forced\nhardship in comparison to ordinary hospital life. Defendants' Motion to\nDismiss is not tl'ie proper time to address these questions.\n48\n\nmedication, not compelled confessions. The Second Amended Complaint alleges\nthat Defendants unconstitutionally fail to provide the minimal procedural\nrequirements before an SVP is injected with or otherwise forced to take a variety\nof drugs. ER 483, ¶87. As set out above, it is well settled that convicted prisoners,\npretrial detainees, and parolees all possess a significant liberty interest in avoiding\nthe unwanted administrations of antipsychotic drugs under the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. 2°\nMoreover, California state courts have maintained even higher standards\nwhen addressing the rights of involuntarymental health patients, as opposed to\nprisoners, to refuse medication. For example, the California Supreme Court has\nheld that individuals involuntarily committed pursuant to the Mentally Disordered\nOffender Act (Cal. Penal Code § 2960, et se__e_h_a.)ve a state constitutional right to\nbe free from mandatory antipsychotic medication in non-emergency situations\nabsent (1) a judicial determination of incapacity to make treatment decisions or (2)\na judicial finding that the patient is dangerous within the meaning of California\nWelfare and Institutions Code section 5300. See In re Qawi, 32 Cal. 4that 9-10;\n7 Cal. Rptr. 3.d at 784; see also Riese v. St. Marc's Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 209 Cal.\nApp. 3d 1303, 271 Cal. Rptr. 199 (1987) (ruling that involuntary commitments\nheld pursuant to the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, § 5000 et se_, have the right to\nexercise informed consent to the use of antipsychotic drugs in non-emergency\nsituations absent a judicial determination of their incapacity to make treatment\ndecisions).\n20\nThe Eighth Circuit held that a psychiatrist should have known of the decision\nin Washington v. Harper three weeks after it was handed down, and thus was\nnot entitled to qualified immunity fot]_administrations that occurred thereafter.\nDoby v. Hickerson, 120 F.3d 111(8 Cir. 1997).\n49\n\nAccordingly, a reasonable official would realize that Plaintiffs have a\nprotected liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration ofantipsychotic\ndrugs and, as such, procedural safeguards must be employed before forcibly\nadministering such drugs at ASH.\n3. Clearly Established Right To Notice For Sanctionable Conduct\nPrecludes Finding Of Qualified Immunity.\nAccording to the Ninth Circuit, it is clearly established that an inmate has a\nprocedural due process right to notice that his conduct is sanctionable; that is, that\nthere are negative repercussions - or even punishments - which will follow from\nhis actions or failure to act a certain way. Newell v. Sauser, 79 F.3d 115 (9thCir.\n1996), superseding 64 F.3d 1416 (9thCir. 1995); see also Browning v. Vernon,\n44 F.3d 818 (9thCir. 1995) (denying qualified immunity for prison officials from\nprocedural due process violations where prisoners were informed of hearings only\n24 hours in advance, were not given copies of the report and recommendation, and\nwere immediately placed in solitary confinement). In Browning, the Ninth Circuit\nheld that despite the absence of case law on point, a reasonable prison official\nwould have known that the challenged procedures denied the inmates a right to a\nreliable rehabilitation report. Id___G_i.ven the clearly established rights of prison\ninmates to receive notice that their conduct is sanctionable, it follows that a\nreasonable official would realize that patients have the same, if not greater, rights\nto notice. Nonetheless, Defendants have and continue to reduce Plaintiffs' PAS\nlevels without prior notice or justification. ER 475, ¶¶42, 43; 477, ¶51; 480, ¶70;\n483, ¶87.\nE. Defendants Are Not Entitled To Qualified Immunity On Plaintiffs'\nSeventh Claim (Violations Of Substantive Due Process).\nDefendants' arguments concerning substantive due process are aimed\nprimarily at an issue of fact not properly addressed within the context of a motion\n50\n\nto dismiss - i.e__:w.,hether Defendants have exercised \"professional judgment.\"\nAppellants' Br. at 37-38. The propriety of an official's exercise of professional\njudgment can only be determined upon adjudication of the facts, which has not yet\noccurred in this case. As such, Defendants' premature claims should be rejected.\nMoreover, Defendants' arguments are nevertheless ineffective to dispose of\nPlaintiffs' Substantive Due Process claim.\n1. The Applicable Standard.\nAs stated by the Ninth Circuit in Sharp v. Weston, \"[a]lthough the state\nenjoys wide latitude in developing treatment regimens, the courts may take action\nwhen there is a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment or when\nthere has been no exercise of professional judgment at all.\" 233 F.3d at 1171.\nFurthermore, \"the state must.., provide the civilly-committed with 'more\nconsiderate treatment and conditions of confinement than criminals whose\nconditions of confinement are designed to punish.'\" Id__a_t:.1172 (_ Youngberg,\n457 U.S. at 322, 102 S. Ct. at 2461, 73 L. Ed. 2d at 41). As held by the Court in\nYoungberg, involuntary civil commitments have constitutionally protected rights\nunder the Due Process Clause to reasonably safe conditions of confinement,\nfreedom from unreasonable bodily restraints , and such minimally adequate training\nas reasonably may be required to protect these interests. See Youngberg, 457 U.S.\nat 319-22, 102 S. Ct. at 2459-61, 73 L. Ed. 2d at 39-42; see also DeShanev v.\nWinnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200, 109 S. Ct. 998,\n1005, 103 L. Ed. 2d 249, 262 (1989) (\"When the State takes a person into its\ncustody and holds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a\ncorresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general well-\nbeing.\"); County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833,852 n.12, 118 S. Ct. 1708,\n1719, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043, 1061 (1998) (\"The combination of a patient's\ninvoluntary commitment and his total dependence on his custodians obliges the\n51\n\ngovernment to take thought and make reasonable provision for the patient's\nwelfare.\"). Finally, \"lack of funds, staff or facilities cannot justify the State's\nfailure to provide [those confined] with that treatment necessary for rehabilitation.\"\nOhlinger v. Watson, 652 F.2d 775,778 (9th Cir. 1980).\n2. The Second Amended Complaint Alleges That Defendants Have\nFailed To Provide For Plaintiffs' Safe .ty And That The Conditions\nAt ASH Are Similar To Or Worse Than Those In Prison.\nThe Second Amended Complaint clearly alleges that Plaintiffs are subjected\nto living conditions which in many respects are similar to or worse than those in\nprison and which are designed to punish, rather than promote the treatment of,\nPlaintiffs. ER 475, ¶40; 476, ¶¶47-49; 477-480, ¶¶51-67; 483-484, ¶ 90. The\nSecond Amended Complaint similarly alleges that Defendants have personal\nknowledge of physical and sexual abuse of Plaintiffs by ASH staff and other\npatients and yet have failed to take affirmative steps to provide for Plaintiffs'\nsafety. See id. The Second Amended Complaint also sets forth various policies,\npractices and procedures at ASH - including public strip searches, red-light alarms,\nPAS level reductions - all of which are used in a punitive fashion to intimidate\nPlaintiffs, thus denying Plaintiffs their constitutional fight to safe conditions and\nfreedom from unreasonable restraint. ER 478, ¶¶56-57; 479, ¶64; 481, ¶75; 482,\n¶84. Thus, upon these allegations alone, Plaintiffs have clearly alleged facts\nestablishing violations of their substantive due process rights.\n3. Whether Defendants Have Exercised Proper Professional\nJudgment Is A Question Of Fact Not Properly Addressed By A\nMotion To Dismiss.\nIn accordance with the standard set forth in Youngberg, Plaintiffs allege that\nthe treatment and therapy programs at ASH are not designed to provide effective\ntreatment nor to facilitate the eventual release of Plaintiffs, but rather are merely a\n52\n\nruse tojustify the indefinite civil \"incarceration\" of Plaintiffs under the guise of\ntreatment. ER 475-476, ¶¶41-46; 477, ¶¶51-52. The SecondAmended Complaint\nalsoalleges that the policies, practices andprocedures atASH substantially depart\nfrom andoften contradict both thewritten statementscontained in ASH\nadministrative directives aswell asthe rights andregulations contained in the\nrelevant statutes. ER 473-475, ¶¶33-40. Proof of such inadequatetreatment\npolicies andpractices, in addition to proof of the unconstitutional physical\nconditions of confinement discussedabove,would clearly establish that\nDefendants have demonstrated \"a substantial departure from acceptedprofessional\njudgment\" or have failed to \"exercise professional judgment at all.\" Shar_i 233\nF.3d at 1171.\nRegardless,the issueof whether Defendants have exercised proper\nprofessional judgment in designing, implementing andmanaging thepolicies,\npractices andproceduresapplicable to Plaintiffs' confinement andtreatment at\nASH - and the related issueof whether stateinterests outweigh Plaintiffs' liberty\ninterests in this case- is aquestion of fact not properly resolved within the context\nof amotion to dismiss. Youngberg requires demonstration of a substantial\ndeparture, atthe earliest, upon a motion for summary judgment. Therefore,\nPlaintiffs' Seventh Alleged Claim should not be dismissed at this stage.\n4. Plaintiffs' Clearly Established Right To Safe Conditions\nPrecludes A Finding Of Qualified Immunity.\nAs set forth above, it has been clearly established that civil commitment\nhave a constitutional right to safe conditions of confinement, freedom from\nunreasonable bodily restraints and adequate training to ensure that these interests\nare protected. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 319-22; see also Neely v. Feinstein, 50\nF.3d 1502, 1508 (9 thCir. 1995) (noting that it is \"clearly established\" within Ninth\nCircuit that \"patients have a constitutional right to be safe in the state institution to\n53\n\nwhich they are committed\"). The Second Amended Complaint alleges facts\nsufficient to demonstrate that Defendants have violated Plaintiffs' clearly\nestablished right to be safe and have breached their clearly established duty to\nprevent harm. ER 475, ¶40; 476, ¶¶47-49; 477-480, ¶¶51-67; 481, ¶75; 482, ¶84;\n483-484, ¶ 90. Further, Defendants have failed to take affirmative steps to remedy\nthose conditions at ASH which undermine the therapeutic goal of the institution\nand which subject Plaintiffs to living conditions similar to or worse than those\nwithin a prison. For these reasons, Defendants are not entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\nF. Defendants Are Not Entitled To Qualified Immunity On Plaintiffs'\nEighth Alleged Claim (Violation Of Equal Protection).\n• In challenging Plaintiffs' Eighth Alleged Claim, Defendants claim that no\nequal protection violation has been alleged because, even if SVPs are treated\ndifferently than other civil commitments, SVPs do not constitute a protected class\nand, therefore, only rational basis review is justified. Appellants' Br. at 38-40.\nBut Plaintiffs allege facts demonstrating arbitrary and unjustified discrimination\nagainst SVPs. For example, the Second Amended Complaint points out that\nDefendants purposely give priority to non-SVPs when hiring patients for\nremunerative work. ER 479, ¶63. Similarly, the Second Amended Complaint\ndescribes tolerance and encouragement of abuse of SVPs merely because they are\nSVPs. ER 476, ¶49; 478, ¶¶54, 55; 480, ¶72.\nFurthermore, where fundamental interests are at issue, heightened scrutiny\nmay be required even if there is no suspect class. Plyer v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 102\nS. Ct. 2382, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1982); Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S. Ct.\n1439, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1(1993) (holding that government cannot infringe on\nfundamental liberty interests unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a\ncompelling state interest); Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720, 117\n54\n\nS. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 722 (1997) (holding that the due process clause\n\"provides heightened protection against government interference with certain\nfundamental rights and liberty interests\"). In Young v. Weston, 176 F.3d 1196,\n1201 (9thCir. 1999), rev'd on other grounds by Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 121\nS. Ct. 727, 148 L. Ed. 2d 28 (2001), the Ninth Circuit upheld the lower court's\napplication of\"a heightened scrutiny standard\" when evaluating whether\nWashington State's Sexually Violent Predator Statute violated equal protection.\nUnder this standard, the court considers whether the classification is substantially\nrelated to an important government interest. Because this case involves\nfundamental interests, such as the fundamental liberty interest in freedom from\nbodily restraint, n \"a heightened scrutiny\" standard and not rational basis review is\napplicabie. Defendants' arguments are therefore unpersuasive.\nFinally, even if rational basis review is applied, it is difficult to imagine how\na reasonable official could believe that tolerating and encouraging the abuse,\nimproper punishment and forced medication of SVPs, in contrast to other patients\nhoused at ASH, could bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose. 22\nPlaintiffs have described facts showing purposeful and knowing discrimination that\nis not justified by legislative distinctions. Thus, Defendants' arguments do not\njustify dismissal of the equal protection claims.\n21\nIn Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 316, 102 S. Ct. at 2458, 73 L. Ed. 2d at 37, the\nUnited States Supreme Court held that persons have a fundamental liberty\ninterest in freedom from bodily restraint.\n22\nDefendants rely on Baxtrom v. Herolda 383 U.S. 107, 86S. Ct. 760, 15 L. Ed.\n2d 620 (1966), to argue that classificataons based on degree of dangerousness\nare reasonable. Appellants' Br. at 39. But the Court in-Baxtrom actually found\nthat the State's different treatment of the criminally insane and civilly insane\nwas not justified based on a degree of dangerousness. 383 U.S. 11I-112.\nSirmT_, y, here, a degree of dangerousness does not justify subjecting SVPs to\nmore aousive conoitlons tlaan those imposed on tlae other types of pai-ients\nhoused at ASH, such as penal commitments.\n55\n\nG. Defendants Are Not Entitled To Qualified Immunity On Plaintiffs'\nTenth Alleged Claim (Violation Of The Right To Privacy).\nDefendants seem to conclude that Plaintiffs, as confined individuals, either\ndo not have any privacy rights or that Defendants' summary and unsupported\nreliance on ASH's alleged security and treatment interests automatically supersede\nPlaintiffs' privacy interests. Appellants' Br. at 40-41. However, Plaintiffs allege a\nvariety of privacy violations that bear no relation to any State interest. Rather,\nthese allegations are based on arbitrary, unreasonable, unconstitutional conduct.\nFor example, public strip searches and retaliatory room searches violate Plaintiffs'\nprivacy without furthering security or treatment interests. Rather than\nautomatically justifying a motion to dismiss, this assertion demonstrates the need\nfor discovery regarding the frequency and scope of these privacy violations.\nAbsent supporting evidence, Defendants' bald assertion of compelling state\ninterest cannot summarily and preemptively defeat Plaintiffs' properly pled claims.\nFurthermore, the Ninth Circuit established a Fourteenth Amendment Due\nProcess right to bodily privacy in York v. Story, 324 F.2d 450 (9thCir. 1963).\nDefendants argue that \"it is clear that in the Ninth Circuit a person confined in a\nsecure institution does not have the right to be free from observation while\nshowering, in their room, or otherwise in the institution.\" Appellants' Br. at 41.\nThis argument is based on Grummet v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491 (9thCir. 1985), a\ncase that dealt with observation in the prison context, not a civil hospital. To\nreiterate, Plaintiffs are civil, not penal, commitments and, as such, have greater\nrights than prisoners. See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 321-322 (\"Persons who have\nbeen involuntarily committed are entitled to more considerate treatment and\nconditions of confinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are\ndesigned to punish.\"). The Ninth Circuit has never found that civil commitments\ndo not have the right to be free from observation. Accordingly, at this stage of the\n56\n\ncase, Plaintiffs' privacy claim should not be dismissed on qualified immunity\ngrounds.\nFinally, Defendants' contention that the Second Amended Complaint fails to\nstate a privacy claim under the California Constitution is similarly without merit.\nAs stated above, Plaintiffs bring challenges under federal, not state, law. 23\n23\nThus, Defendants' contention that Plaintiffs have f_iled to state a claim under\nHill v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 7 Cal. 4 1, 26 Cal. Rptr. 2d 834\n(Cal. 1994) is inapposite. Nevertheless, a violation ot state law is relevant to\nwhether there has been a violation ot the federal Constitution and the Hill\nelements have been met in the instant case. Analogizing from the prison .\ncontext, class members, at a minimum, retain the right to povacy except to the\nextent restrictions are necessary to guarantee tlae securi_ ot the hospital and\nthe protection otthe public. People v. Lloyd, 27 Cal. 4 997, 1007-1008, 119\nCal. Rl_tr. 2d 360 (Cal. 2002). Notwithstanding Grummet v. Rushen, 779 F.2d\n491 (9 Cir. 1985), Plaintiffs have a right to expect bodily privacy. York, 324\nF.2d at 455. Moreover, Section 71619 of Title22 of the California C-o-deof\nRegulations creates an expectation of privacy by stating that \"a method of\nassuring privacy for each pati,,ent shall-be maintained iri patient rooms and in\ntub, shower andtoilet rooms. Aside from asserting that there is a compelling\nState interest i,_ viewing patients' psychological records, People v. Martinez,.\n88 Cal. App. 4 465, 105 Cal. Rpti'. 2d 841 (2001), which does not e.quate with\na compelhng interest for any of theprivacy v!olataons alleged by Plaintiffs,\nDefen_lants have not even attempted to articulate a compelling state interest\nwhich they contend could summarily defeat Plaintiffs' privacy claims at the\npleading stage. Their challenge is premature.\n57\n\nXIII.\nCONCLUSION\nDefendants have attempted twice to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims on the basis\nthat they are barred, in their entirety, by the doctrine of qualified immunity. Their\nattempts were wholly rejected by the district court both times. Plaintiffs\nrespectfully submit that this Court, too, should deny Defendants' claims and affirm\nthe district court's Order denying the Second Motion to Dismiss.\nDated: May 21,2004 LATHAMjEo.el.K&/'isWchA__ KINS\nKatm'yrglvl.

It was filed in 1998 on behalf of a class\n21\nof sexually violent predators who alleged constitutional violations in connection with\n22\ntheir  civil  confinement  at  California  Department  of  State  Hospitals  [“DSH”]\n23\nAtascadero.  Beginning in 1999, Plaintiffs were represented by attorney Joel Krischer\n24\nat the law firm of Latham and Watkins.  On August 14, 2002, Plaintiffs filed a Second\n25\nAmended Complaint.  Plaintiffs, then, served the Second Amended Complaint on only\n26\nthree of the named defendants: then Executive Director of DSH Atascadero Melvin\n27\nHunter (also known as Jon DeMorales), DSH Atascadero’s then Senior Psychologist\n28\nOrder – Page 1 of 4\n\nCase 2:98-cv-07167-TJH-AS   Document 324   Filed 05/13/16   Page 2 of 4   Page ID #:666\n1 Specialist Craig Nelson, and DSH Atascadero’s then Clinical Administrator Grenda\n2 Ernst [“Served Defendants”].  In 2003, the Court denied the Served Defendants’ motion\n3 to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.  From 2003 to 2012, this case was before\n4 the Ninth Circuit and the United States Supreme Court on the Served Defendants’\n5 motion to dismiss.  While the case was on appeal, the class members were transferred\n6 from DSH Atascadero to DSH Coalinga.  On January 12, 2012, the Ninth Circuit held\n7 that the Plaintiffs could proceed with their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief\n8 based on events that took place at DSH Atascadero.  Hydrick v. Hunter, 669 F.3d 937\n9 (9th Cir. 2012).\n10 On December 17, 2013, upon the retirement of Joel Krischer, the Court approved\n11 the Plaintiffs’ request for substitution of attorneys from Latham and Watkins to Spertus,\n12 Landes, & Umhoffer, LLP.  Thereafter, Plaintiffs sought leave to file a Third Amended\n13 Complaint, which, in effect, was a new complaint because it would have replaced all\n14 but one of the named Plaintiffs, and was based primarily on alleged violations at DSH\n15 Coalinga.    The  Court  denied  the  motion  for  leave,  the  subsequent  motion  for\n16 reconsideration, and the subsequent motion to transfer venue based on forum non\n17 conveniens.\n18 Now, in light of the holding in Hydrick v. Hunter, 669 F.3d 937 (9th Cir. 2012),\n19 the Served Defendants move to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint as moot\n20 because Plaintiffs’ claims were limited to declaratory and injunctive relief for alleged\n21 violations at DSH Atascadero, but they are no longer confined there.  Then, on April\n22 21, 2016, after this motion to dismiss was filed, Plaintiffs served the Second Amended\n23 Complaint on the current Director of the California Department of State Hospitals,\n24 Pamela Ahlin, and the current Secretary of the California Department of Corrections\n25 and Rehabilitations, Scott Kernan.\n26 A plaintiff must serve a defendant within 90 days of a complaint being filed. \n27 Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).  At the time the complaint was filed, Rule 4 provided 120 days\n28 for effectuating service.  However, if service is not effectuated within 90 days, the\nOrder – Page 2 of 4\n\nCase 2:98-cv-07167-TJH-AS   Document 324   Filed 05/13/16   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:667\n1 plaintiff bears the burden to show good cause justifying the delay, otherwise the action\n2 must be dismissed.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m).  The Court may, also, grant an extension to\n3 effectuate service, even in the absence of good cause.  See Efaw v. Williams, 473 F.3d\n4 1038, 1040 (9th Cir. 2007).  After eighteen years of litigation, and fourteen years after\n5 the filing of the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs suddenly decided to effectuate\n6 service on two additional defendants.  Plaintiffs did not offer any explanation for this\n7 delay, which was more than “extraordinary,” nor did Plaintiffs seek leave to extend\n8 Rule 4(m)’s time limit.  See e.g. Efaw, 473 F.3d at 1041.  This litigation has proceeded\n9 for eighteen years without these newly served individuals or their predecessors, who\n10 had never made an appearance or otherwise participated in this case.  Despite Plaintiffs’\n11 argument, service of process confers this Court with jurisdiction over a party, not the\n12 placement of a party’s name on the Court’s docket.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1).\n13 Until his retirement, Joel Krischer was the Plaintiffs’ counsel.  Krischer was an\n14 esteemed civil litigator and partner at Latham and Watkins.  As indicated in the June\n15 28, 1999, Minute Order, Krischer made strategic decisions on how to frame this case,\n16 which included the abandonment of claims against unserved defendants.  Otherwise,\n17 there is no reasonable explanation as to why Krischer would not have served the\n18 additional defendants.\n19 Further, it is well-established that a detainee’s transfer to a new facility moots\n20 claims for declaratory and injunctive relief based on alleged violations that took place\n21 at that prior facility, unless the complaint challenges statewide policies.  See Nelson v.\n22 Heiss, 271 F.3d 891, 897 (9th Cir. 2001).  Here, Plaintiffs’ case has always been\n23 limited to prospective injunctive and declaratory relief for actions and policies at DSH\n24 Atascadero; it was never a systemic lawsuit against the entire California DSH system. \n25 See Nelson, 271 F.3d at 987.  Indeed, this case was surgically targeted to address the\n26 issues at DSH Atascadero.  Since Plaintiffs have been transferred to DSH Coalinga,\n27 Plaintiffs’ new counsel has tried to re-frame this case into something it has never been. \n28 Now that Plaintiffs have been transferred to DSH Coalinga, the Second Amended\nOrder – Page 3 of 4\n\nCase 2:98-cv-07167-TJH-AS   Document 324   Filed 05/13/16   Page 4 of 4   Page ID #:668\n1 Complaint is moot.  See Nelson, 271 F.3d at 987.\n2 Plaintiffs’ are not left without a remedy.  Their remedy, now, is a new lawsuit\n3 in the Eastern District of California for any claims related to Plaintiffs’ confinement at\n4 DSH Coalinga. \n5 Accordingly,\n6 It is Ordered that the motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint be,\n7 and hereby is, Granted.\n8\n9 Date: May 13, 2016 \n10 __________________________________\n11 Terry J.

California's Sexually Violent Predators Scheme\nThe SVP Act defines an SVP as a person \"convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims for\nwhich he or she received a determinate sentence and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the\nperson a danger to the health and safety of others\" i.e., is \"likely [to] engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\"\n[2]\nSee Cal. Welf. & Inst.Code § 6600(a).  At least six months before a person who has committed the predicate\noffenses is to complete his sentence, he is evaluated by the Department of Corrections and Department of\nMental Health. Id. § 6601. If those two departments agree that the person evaluated may be an SVP, a petition\n\nfor commitment may be filed by the district attorney or counsel for the county in which the evaluated person was\nconvicted. Id. § 6601(i). If that person is found by a jury to be an SVP who poses a danger to the health and\nsafety of others, he is civilly committed for an indefinite period to commence after his criminal sentence is fulfilled.\nId. §§ 6602-6604.\nOnce civilly committed, Plaintiffs undergo a five-phase treatment program. Phase One comprises group sessions\nthat educate the SVP about California's SVP Act. During Phase One, the SVP is required to attend and\n[3]\nparticipate in the treatment sessions. If he does not, his access level  is reduced and he is not allowed to\nadvance to Phase Two of the treatment program. In addition, an SVP's failure to attend or participate in the\ntreatment sessions is used against him at future probable cause and confinement hearings. The SVP cannot\nadvance beyond Phase One unless he signs a statement in which he acknowledges that he has an \"illness\" that\n987 requires \"treatment.\" Plaintiffs allege that the signed statements are often used against *987 the SVP in future\nprobable cause and confinement hearings.\nPhases Two through Five of the treatment plan involve \"cognitive\" treatment. This treatment includes viewing\nvideos that depict violent or other inappropriate sexual activities while a repugnant odor or other unpleasant\nsensation is applied to elicit a negative association.\nEach year, a committed person has a right to a show cause hearing to determine whether his commitment should\nbe continued. Id. § 6605(a)-(b). If it is found that the SVP continues to be a danger to the health or safety of the\ncommunity, the person is committed for two years from the date of the finding. Id. § 6605(e). These successive\nperiods of commitment can be continued indefinitely, or until the SVP completes all five phases of treatment.\nUpon successful completion of Phase Five, the SVP is conditionally released under the supervision of the\nCalifornia Mental Health Department. According to Plaintiffs, \"only a handful of SVPs have been allowed into\nPhase Four and no SVP has progressed to Phase Five or ha[s] been found to be ready for release under the\n[4]\ntreatment protocol.\"\n2. The Current Lawsuit\nOn September 2, 1998, Plaintiffs filed a pro se class action, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in district court against\nDefendants-Appellants Stephen Mayberg (Director of the California Department of Mental Health), Cal A.\nTerhune (Director of the California Department of Corrections), Jon DeMorales (former Executive Director at\nAtascadero State Hospital), Grenda Ernst (Clinical Administrator at Atascadero State Hospital), and Craig Nelson\n(Senior Psychologist Specialist at Atascadero State Hospital) (collectively \"Defendants\"). Plaintiffs sought\ninjunctive and declaratory relief, as well as monetary damages, on the grounds that the policies and procedures\nthat govern Plaintiffs' confinement and treatment at Atascadero State Hospital violate Plaintiffs' constitutional\nrights.\nIn March 1999, the district court appointed pro bono counsel for Plaintiffs. Counsel filed an amended complaint\napproximately five months later. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss raised Eleventh\nAmendment and qualified immunity defenses. The district court denied Defendants' motion in a one line order.\n[5]\nPlaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 14, 2002.  Both the first and second amended\ncomplaints alleged that Defendants violated Plaintiffs' rights by, inter alia: (1) force-medicating Plaintiffs in non-\nemergency situations; (2) reducing Plaintiffs' access levels and other privileges as a form of punishment for\nrefusing to participate in treatment sessions or as retaliation for filing lawsuits; (3) putting Plaintiffs in restraints for\nnon-threatening and/or nondisruptive conduct, including the refusal to participate in treatment or therapy; (4)\nsubjecting Plaintiffs to public strip-searches (sometimes while in four-point restraints); (5) failing to protect\nPlaintiffs from abuse of other patients or of Atascadero employees; (6) failing to provide Plaintiffs with\n988 constitutionally satisfactory conditions of confinement; *988 (7) forcing Plaintiffs to participate in treatment; and\n(8) denying Plaintiffs adequate treatment, thereby converting Plaintiffs' civil confinement to a de facto extension of\ntheir prison sentence.\nOnce again, Defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint, on the same grounds presented in\ntheir first motion to dismiss. The district court again denied Defendants' motion to dismiss in a one line order.\n\nDefendants timely filed their notice of appeal. Defendants contend that the district court erred by failing to rule\nthat the Eleventh Amendment, state abstention doctrine, or qualified immunity barred Plaintiffs' suit.\nANALYSIS\nA. Standard of Review\nWe review de novo the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss. Decker v. Advantage Fund, Ltd., 362 F.3d\n593, 595-96 (9th Cir.2004). Immunity under the Eleventh Amendment presents a question of law, which we\nreview de novo. See Demshki v. Monteith, 255 F.3d 986, 988 (9th Cir.2001). To determine if Defendants are\nentitled to qualified immunity, we review de novo whether governing law was clearly established at the time of the\nalleged violation and whether the specific facts alleged constitute a violation of established law. See Mabe v. San\nBernardino County Dept. of Pub. Soc. Servs., 237 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir.2001).\nAlthough a district court's denial of a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is not ordinarily\nappealable, the denial of a claim for immunity is appealable before final judgment under the collateral order\ndoctrine and is reviewed de novo. See Morley v. Walker, 175 F.3d 756, 759 (9th Cir.1999). All allegations of\nmaterial fact are accepted as true and should be construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. See Resnick v.\nHayes, 213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). The \"complaint should not be dismissed [under Rule 12(b)(6)] unless it\nappears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle the\nplaintiff to relief.\" Thompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 895 (9th Cir.2002).\nWe note, again, the special difficulty of deciding the motion to dismiss a Defendant on qualified immunity grounds\nat this stage. Under the notice pleading standard of the Federal Rules, plaintiffs are only required to give a \"short\nand plain statement\" of their claims. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(a)(2). Thus, \"[w]hen a federal court reviews the\nsufficiency of a complaint, before the reception of any evidence either by affidavit or admissions, [our] task is\nnecessarily a limited one. The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is\nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\" Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40\nL.Ed.2d 90 (1974).\nAs we recognized in Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952 (9th Cir.2004), a motion to dismiss on\nqualified immunity grounds puts the court in the difficult position of deciding \"far-reaching constitutional questions\non a nonexistent factual record.\" Id. at 957. We strongly suggested that, while \"government officials have the right\n. . . to raise . . . qualified immunity defense on a motion to dismiss, the exercise of that authority is not a wise\nchoice in every case.\" Id. We find that especially true here. The policy justifying qualified immunity motions at this\nstage is to protect officers against the burden of discovery and pre-trial motions. Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S.\n299, 308, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). In this case, the parties had already engaged in discovery for\n989 several years, and it appears that *989 discovery was almost complete. Defendants could have presented this as\na motion for summary judgment, and we would have a more developed factual record to guide our decision.\nBecause Defendants' motion is framed as a motion to dismiss, we must evaluate the merits of Defendants'\nqualified immunity defense before we know the full extent of the alleged abuses at Atascadero, or the reason\nbehind Atascadero policy, or the level of involvement Defendants had in creating the conditions at Atascadero. As\nwe decide Defendants' motion, however, we are cautious not to eviscerate the notice pleading standard in suits\nwhere qualified immunity is at issue. See Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1125-26 (9th Cir.\n[6]\n2002).\nB. The Law of the Case Doctrine Does Not Apply\nPlaintiffs argue that under the law of the case doctrine, we should not reach the merits of Defendants' appeal\nbecause Defendants' second motion to dismiss was barred by the district court's ruling that denied Defendants'\nfirst motion to dismiss. The relevant facts are as follows: after Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint,\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of failure to state a claim and qualified immunity. The district\ncourt denied Defendants' motion in a summary order, and Defendants did not appeal. Plaintiffs filed a second\namended complaint, in which they changed only the name of one of the Defendants. Defendants then filed a\nmotion to dismiss on grounds substantially similar to those stated in the first motion to dismiss. The district court\n\nagain denied the motion to dismiss in a summary order. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' second motion to\ndismiss is an impermissible \"second bite at the apple\" and should be dismissed under the law of the case\ndoctrine.\n\"Under the `law of the case' doctrine, a court is ordinarily precluded from reexamining an issue previously\ndecided by the same court, or a higher court, in the same case.\" Richardson v. United States, 841 F.2d 993, 996\n(9th Cir.1988) (citations omitted). For the law of the case doctrine to apply, \"the issue in question must have been\n`decided explicitly or by necessary implication in [the] previous disposition.'\" United States v. Lummi Indian Tribe,\n235 F.3d 443, 452 (9th Cir.2000) (citing Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. EEOC, 691 F.2d 438, 441 (9th Cir.1982)); \nUnited States v. Cote, 51 F.3d 178 (9th Cir.1995) (\"[T]he law of the case acts as a bar only when the issue in\nquestion was actually considered and decided by the first court.\").\nThe district court denied Defendants' first motion to dismiss and their second motion to dismiss in a summary\norder. Thus the district court's grounds for rejecting Defendants' two motions are not explicit. Nor can we say that\n990 any issue was decided by implication in the first summary order denying Defendants' first *990 motion to dismiss.\nEither motion could have been denied for any number of procedural or technical reasons unrelated to the\nsubstance of the motions. It is possible that Defendants' second motion was denied based on the law of the case\ndoctrine, or that the district court decided, in its discretion, not to apply the law of the case doctrine due to\nsubsequent changes in the law, or the \"manifest injustice\" that would result given the new party to the suit. See \nUnited States v. Alexander, 106 F.3d 874, 876 (9th Cir.1997). Because it is impossible for us to determine the\nbasis of denial of either motion, we conclude that the \"law of the case\" does not apply and address the appeal on\nthe merits.\nC. Eleventh Amendment Immunity and the Abstention Doctrine Do Not Bar Plaintiffs' Claims\nDefendants concede that suits for injunctive or declaratory relief do not violate the Eleventh Amendment under \nEx parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). Defendants contend, instead, that Plaintiffs'\nrequest for monetary damages against them is barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution.\nDefendants are correct that Plaintiffs cannot seek monetary damages against state officials in their official\ncapacity. See Doe v. Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab., 131 F.3d 836, 839 (9th Cir.1997). But the Eleventh\nAmendment does not bar suits seeking damages against state officials in their personal capacity. See Hafer v.\nMelo, 502 U.S. 21, 30, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991); Ashker v. Cal. Dep't of Corr., 112 F.3d 392,\n394-95 (9th Cir. 1997).\nThe second amended complaint states that Defendants acted in and are being sued in their individual and official\ncapacities. This creates a presumption that Plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages against defendants in their\npersonal capacity. See Romano v. Bible, 169 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.1999) (stating a strong presumption in\nfavor of a personal capacity suit where an official capacity suit for damages would be barred). Accordingly, the\nEleventh Amendment does not bar Plaintiffs' claim for damages against Defendants in their individual capacities.\nDefendants also argue that they are immune from Plaintiffs' suit because Plaintiffs attempt to enforce pendent\nstate law claims in federal court. Plaintiffs refer, in their first, second, and tenth claims for relief, to provisions in\nthe California Constitution that parallel the applicable provision in the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs\nconcede that they could not prevail on a § 1983 claim based on a violation of state law, because § 1983, by its\nown terms, protects only violations of federal law. See Ybarra v. Bastian, 647 F.2d 891, 892 (9th Cir.1981).\nInstead, they cite California law only where it is legitimate to do so, e.g., where there is a state-created liberty or\nproperty interest at stake. See, e.g., Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 710-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs' claims are not barred on this ground, and we need not consider Defendants' arguments\n[7]\nthat Plaintiffs' state law claims are \"novel and complex\" under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).\n991 *991 D. Plaintiffs' Section 1983 Claims\nDefendants' first substantive argument is that Plaintiffs have not properly pled a claim under Section 1983, in that\nthey are not proper defendants for a suit. \"To sustain an action under section 1983, a plaintiff must show (1) that\nthe conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) that the conduct\n\ndeprived the plaintiff of a federal constitutional or statutory right.\" Wood v. Ostrander, 879 F.2d 583, 587 (9th\nCir.1989).\nThere is no question that all Defendants were acting under the color of California law when they engaged in the\nalleged unconstitutional conduct. Defendants argue, instead, that their conduct did not cause Plaintiffs any\ndeprivation of their constitutional or statutory rights.\n\"A person `subjects' another to the deprivation of a constitutional right, within the meaning of [§] 1983, if [that\nperson] does an affirmative act, participates in another's affirmative acts, or omits to perform an act which [that\nperson] is legally required to do that causes the deprivation of which complaint is made.\" Johnson v. Duffy, 588\nF.2d 740, 743 (9th Cir.1978). Indeed, the \"requisite causal connection can be established not only by some kind\nof direct personal participation in the deprivation, but also by setting in motion a series of acts by others which the\nactor knows or reasonably should know would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.\" Id. at 743-744.\nIn limited circumstances, a person can also be subject to § 1983 liability for the acts of others. Although there is\nno pure respondeat superior liability under § 1983, a supervisor is liable for the constitutional violations of\nsubordinates \"if the supervisor participated in or directed the violations, or knew of the violations and failed to act\nto prevent them.\" Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989).\nPlaintiffs proceed on both of these theories: (a) that Defendants created policies and procedures that violated\nPlaintiffs' constitutional rights; and (b) that Defendants were willfully blind to constitutional violations committed by\ntheir subordinates. Because Defendants were directors and policy-makers for Atascadero State Hospital, we\nbelieve Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the constitutional violations they suffered were \"set in motion\" by\nDefendants' policy decisions or, at the very least, that Defendants knew of these abuses and demonstrated a\ndeliberate indifference to the SVPs' plight.\nDefendants are correct that, under Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d 628, 633-34 (9th Cir.1988), Plaintiffs will need to\nshow how the deliberate indifference or affirmative actions of each defendant caused a constitutional violation\nbefore they can seek monetary damages against any individual defendant. At this stage of pleading, however,\nthey need not specifically delineate how each Defendant contributed to the violation of their constitutional rights.\nIndeed, we do not see how, prior to discovery, they could plead the individual roles of each state officer with any\nmore specificity. Taking the statements in the complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs may\nbe able to state a claim against all of the named Defendants, each of whom played an instrumental role in policy-\nmaking and enforcement at Atascadero State Hospital. Therefore, we hold that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged\n992 Defendants' *992 role in the alleged constitutional violations against SVPs to survive this motion to dismiss.\nE. Defendants' Qualified Immunity Defense\nDefendants also argued that the district court erred when it denied them qualified immunity. As Defendants have\nconceded, qualified immunity is only an immunity from a suit for damages, and does not provide immunity from\nsuit for declaratory or injunctive relief. See Los Angeles Police Protective League v. Gates, 995 F.2d 1469, 1472\n(9th Cir.1993). Defendants instead argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity from all of Plaintiffs' claims to\nthe extent that Plaintiffs seek monetary damages.\nIn analyzing Defendants' qualified immunity defense, we must determine, taking the facts in the light most\nfavorable to Plaintiffs: (1) what right has been violated; (2) whether that right was so \"clearly established\" at the\ntime of the incident that a reasonable official would have been aware that the conduct violated constitutional\nbounds; and (3) whether a reasonable public official could have believed that the alleged conduct was lawful. See\nNewell v. Sauser, 79 F.3d 115, 117 (9th Cir. 1996).\nIn order to withstand Defendants' claims of qualified immunity, then, Plaintiffs must first allege a violation of a right\nthat was clearly established in 1998 00 the time the alleged constitutional violations first took place. See Anderson\n97\nv. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); Sorrels v. McKee, 290 F.3d 965, 970\n(9th Cir.2002). To defeat qualified immunity, \"the right allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level\nof specificity before a court can determine if it was clearly established.\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615, 119\nS.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999).\n\nBut Plaintiffs need not establish that Defendants' \"behavior had been previously declared unconstitutional.\" \nBlueford v. Prunty, 108 F.3d 251, 254 (9th Cir.1997). In fact, \"precedent directly on point is not necessary to\ndemonstrate a clearly established right.\" Id. at 255. Rather, \"[i]f the only reasonable conclusion from binding\nauthority were that the disputed right existed, even if no case had specifically so declared, [Defendants] would be\non notice of the right and [officials] would not be qualifiedly immune if they acted to offend it.\" Id. If the occasion\nhas not risen for our circuit to reach a question, we may draw clearly established law from other circuits. Prison\nLegal News v. Lehman, 397 F.3d 692, 701 (9th Cir.2005); see also Jacobs v. City of Chicago, 215 F.3d 758, 767\n(7th Cir.2000) (finding a violation of clearly established law where there is \"such a clear trend in the case law\" that\nrecognition of the right is \"only a matter of time\").\nBefore we consider Plaintiffs' claims individually to determine whether they were clearly established, we address\na threshold question that applies to Plaintiffs' claims more generally. Defendants argue, as a broad proposition,\nthat damages are not appropriate in this suit because the law applicable to SVPs is still evolving. We\nacknowledge that this suit is unique, in that it is one of the first widespread class actions to challenge the\nconditions of detention for civilly confined SVPs. Nonetheless, we believe Defendants may have transgressed\nsome clearly established boundaries, or at least, that their claims cannot be dismissed at this stage of litigation.\nFirst, civilly detained persons must be afforded \"more considerate treatment and conditions of confinement than\n993 criminals whose conditions of confinement are *993 designed to punish.\" Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307,\n322, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982); see also Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2000). It\nfollows logically, then, that the rights afforded prisoners set a floor for those that must be afforded SVPs, and that\nwhere Defendants violate a standard that is clearly established in the prison context, the violation is clearly\n[8]\nestablished under the SVP scheme.  Second, where there is a clearly established body of law that applies to all\ncivilly committed persons, there is no reason that the law should not apply to SVPs as well. For, as we have\npreviously held:\nThe state cannot have it both ways. If confinement of a sexually violent predator is civil for the\npurposes of evaluation under the Ex Post Facto clause, that confinement is civil for the purposes\nof defining the rights to which the detainee is entitled while confined. Civil status means civil\nstatus, with all the . . . rights that accompany it.\nJones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 933 (9th Cir.2004). Thus, there are two bodies of law from which we might draw\n\"clearly established\" law for qualified immunity purposes: first, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is\nclearly established even in the prison context, and second, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is\nclearly established for all civilly detained persons.\nAt the same time, we acknowledge at the outset that it is not always clearly established how much more\nexpansive the rights of civilly detained persons are than those of criminally detained persons. As discussed\nbelow, the rights afforded civilly detained persons are flexible enough to take into account the circumstances of\ndetention. The law generally requires a careful balancing of the rights of individuals who are detained for\ntreatment, not punishment, against the state's interests in institutional security and the safety of those housed at\nthe facility. See, e.g., Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 319-322, 102 S.Ct. 2452. In weighing those interests, it cannot be\nignored that, unlike the plaintiff in Youngberg who was civilly committed because of mental infirmities, SVPs have\nbeen civilly committed subsequent to criminal convictions and have been adjudged to pose a danger to the health\nand safety of others. Therefore, the rights of SVPs may not necessarily be coexistensive with those of all other\n[9]\ncivilly detained persons.\nWith these threshold issues in mind, we review each of Plaintiffs' claims to determine whether Plaintiffs have\n994 sufficiently *994 pleaded a violation of clearly established rights.\n1. Plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights\nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants have retaliated against them for filing lawsuits regarding conditions at\nAtascadero State Hospital. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that, as a result of preparing this suit and other complaints\nabout the conditions at Atascadero, Plaintiffs have been subjected to access-level reductions, harassment by\n\nAtascadero personnel, excessive room search and seizures of property, and that they have been denied access\nto the library.\nIt is clear that the Fourteenth Amendment right to access the courts survives detention. Bounds v. Smith, 430\nU.S. 817, 821-22, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977) (\"It is now established beyond doubt that prisoners have a\nconstitutional right of access to the courts.\"); Cornett v. Donovan, 51 F.3d 894, 898 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that\n\"right of access [to the courts] is guaranteed to people institutionalized in a state mental hospital regardless of\nwhether they are civilly committed after criminal proceedings or civilly committed on grounds of dangerousness\").\nSimilarly, punishment in retaliation for exercising one's right to access the courts may constitute a First\nAmendment violation. Rizzo v. Dawson, 778 F.2d 527, 531-32 (9th Cir. 1985). We have held that the prohibition\nagainst retaliatory punishment is \"`clearly established law' in the Ninth Circuit, for qualified immunity purposes.\" \n[10]\nPratt v. Rowland, 65 F.3d 802, 806 & n. 4 (9th Cir.1995). Given the facts alleged,  we believe Plaintiffs may be\nable to prove that they have been punished in retaliation for the exercise of their First and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights to file grievances about the conditions of their confinement. Accordingly, their claims should\nnot be dismissed at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.\nPlaintiffs also allege that Defendants force them to participate in treatment that violates their First Amendment\nrights. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants bar SVPs from progressing beyond Phase One until they sign\na contract admitting that they have an illness and need treatment. The decision to sign the contract is the ultimate\n\"Catch-22\": during re-commitment hearings, the contract is used against those who sign it as an admission of\nillness, and used against those who do not sign it as a refusal to be amenable to treatment.\nPlaintiffs also allege that SVPs who attend but do not vocally participate in group treatment sessions are found by\nDefendants to be \"not progressing\"; accordingly, these SVPs do not advance to higher levels and are subjected\nto access level restrictions. Plaintiffs argue that they have a First Amendment right to refrain from saying that they\nhave an illness and to refuse to participate in treatment, and that Defendants may not punish them for exercising\ntheir rights.\nWe note that there may be a First Amendment right not to participate in treatment, a right respected by the\n995 language of California's SVP Act, if not in its *995 implementation. Specifically, the SVP Act directs:\nAmenability to treatment is not required for a finding that any person is a person described in\nSection 6600, nor is it required for treatment of that person. Treatment does not mean that the\ntreatment be successful or potentially successful, nor does it mean that the person must recognize\nhis or her problem and willingly participate in the treatment program.\nCal. Welf. & Inst.Code § 6606(b) (emphasis added). While it may be in Plaintiffs' interest to participate in\ntreatment, and the State may create incentives to encourage such participation, it is clear that \"[t]he right of\nfreedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the Constitution against State action includes both the right\nto speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.\" W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624,\n645, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943) (Murphy, J., concurring). As is the case with prisoners, civilly committed\npersons certainly retain those First Amendment rights not inherently inconsistent with the circumstances of their\ndetention. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). The language of the\nabove statute strongly suggests that refusal to recognize one's \"illness\" or affirmatively participate in treatment is\nnot inherently inconsistent with the purposes for which SVPs are detained.\nGranted, Plaintiffs are not actually forced to speak. But in this case, the stakes for refusing to speak are so high\nthat Plaintiffs' participation in treatment is almost compulsory. Indeed, an SVP who exercised his right not to\nadmit his illness could be detained indefinitely: he would never advance past Phase One and his refusal could be\nused against him at his recommitment hearing as a sign that he was not sufficiently \"rehabilitated\" to re-enter\nsociety.\nSeveral inmates who are criminally detained raised analogous arguments, on Fifth Amendment grounds, that\nprograms that force sexual offenders to admit and discuss those offenses violate their rights against self-\nincrimination. In McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002), the Supreme Court found\nthat a program did not violate the Fifth Amendment where the program \"did not extend his term of incarceration\n\n. . . [or] affect his eligibility for good-time credits or parole,\" and the only adverse consequence was that he was\nmoved to the less desirable non-treatment area of the prison. Id. at 38-39, 122 S.Ct. 2017.\nBut McKune explicitly left open the question of whether a greater deprivation of liberty might run afoul of the\nConstitution by essentially compelling detainees to incriminate themselves. At least one court, reading McKune,\nallowed an inmate to proceed past pre-trial motions on First Amendment grounds where the right to parole was\nconditioned on participation in treatment. See Wolfe v. Penn. Dep't of Corrections, 334 F.Supp.2d 762, (E.D.Pa.\n2004). Similarly, in this case, where the stakes for participation in treatment are so high, the deprivations involved\nin refusing to participate in treatment may rise to the level of compulsion that might violate the First Amendment.\nThe question at this stage, however, is not whether the right exists, but whether such a right is clearly established\nunder the First Amendment. Given the volatility of the law on this point, we cannot say that it is. The challenged\nprograms are facially related to the purposes for which the SVPs are detained, and while SVPs may have a right\nto refuse to participate in such treatment, it is not yet clear the extent to which the State can condition privileges\n996 or advancement *996 on participation in such treatment. As such, we believe these claims may be more\nappropriately considered for declaratory or injunctive relief.\nThus, we hold that Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims were based on clearly established law insofar as they\nchallenge action in retaliation for filing lawsuits. To the extent that the claim relies on a First Amendment right not\nto participate in treatment sessions, Defendants have qualified immunity, because the law on this point is not\nclearly established.\n2. Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment Rights\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants' policies and practices subject Plaintiffs to unreasonable searches, seizures, and\nunnecessary use of force. According to Plaintiffs, they are subjected to public strip searches; to retaliatory\nsearches of their possessions; and to arbitrary seizure of their personal belongings upon arrival at Atascadero.\nSVPs are also placed in shackles during transport to Atascadero and during visits from family and friends. When\nthey refuse to participate in treatment, they are subjected to \"red light alarms\" even if they do not post any\n[11]\nphysical risk.  Moreover, they are force-medicated as a means of intimidation and punishment, and for the\nconvenience of staff.\nAccepting these allegations as true, we believe Plaintiffs may be able to state a \"clearly established\" violation of\ntheir Fourth Amendment rights, and thus, the claims are not appropriate for dismissal at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.\nThe watchword of the Fourth Amendment in every context is reasonableness. As this court held in Thompson v.\nSouza, 111 F.3d 694 (9th Cir.1997), \"the Fourth Amendment right to be secure against unreasonable searches\nand seizures `extends to incarcerated prisoners.'\" Id. at 699. Thus, this protection certainly extends to SVPs.\nOf course, \"the reasonableness of a particular search [or seizure] is determined by reference to the [detention]\ncontext.\" Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir.1988). As with any detained person, there are\nconcerns that mirror those that arise in the prison context: i.e., \"the safety and security of guards and others in\nthe facility, order within the facility and the efficiency of the facility's operations.\" Andrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052,\n1061 (8th Cir.2001). But even so, qualified immunity does not protect a search or seizure that is arbitrary,\nretaliatory, or clearly exceeds the legitimate purpose of detention.\nUnder this framework, we cannot dismiss Plaintiffs' claim at this stage. The \"reasonableness\" of a search or\nseizure is a fact-intensive inquiry that cannot be determined at this stage. See, e.g., Thompson, 111 F.3d 694\n(9th Cir.1997) (evaluating the reasonableness of a strip search based on the manner and scope of the search,\nthe place, and the justification). It is impossible to make such a fact-specific determination when the precise\ncircumstances of the searches or seizures are not before the court and when the Defendants have not yet had a\nchance to explain their justification for the alleged searches or seizures. We cannot say, then, that Plaintiffs\n[12]\ncannot possibly state a \"clearly established violation\" based on any facts consistent with their pleadings.\n997 Therefore, *997 Defendants do not have a right to qualified immunity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)\n(6).\n3. Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses\n\nPlaintiffs allege violations of the double jeopardy clause and ex post facto clause. While Plaintiffs concede that\nthese two clauses have punishment as an essential prerequisite, and that the SVP Act is a civil detention statute,\nthey claim that the SVP Act is punitive as applied to them. As such, they argue that their double jeopardy and ex\npost facto claims are not barred.\nIn upholding a law similar to California's SVP Act, the Supreme Court held that \"[a]n Act, found to be civil, cannot\nbe deemed punitive `as applied' to a single individual in violation of the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto\nClauses and provide cause for release.\" Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 267, 121 S.Ct. 727, 148 L.Ed.2d 734\n(2001). Similarly, the California Supreme Court stressed the civil nature of a sexually violent predator\ncommitment and rejected challenges to California's SVP Act based on the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy\nclauses of the federal constitution. See Hubbart v. Superior Court, 19 Cal.4th 1138, 1171, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492,\n969 P.2d 584 (Cal.1999). We believe Plaintiffs' claims based on the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses\n[13]\nof the federal constitution are foreclosed.\nPlaintiffs argue that Seling does not control because they are not \"seeking release\" as was the habeas petitioner\nin Seling. They raise a purely artificial difference. The court in Seling made it abundantly clear that the civil nature\nof the SVP scheme \"cannot be altered based merely on the vagaries in implementation of the authorizing\nstatute.\" Id. at 263, 121 S.Ct. 727. Accordingly, we find that the civil nature of California's SVP Act is not altered\nbecause of the remedy sought and we reverse the district court's order denying Defendants' motion to dismiss as\nto the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy Clause related claims.\n4. Plaintiffs' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Claims\nPlaintiffs allege in their complaint that the \"restrictive and denigrating conditions\" at the Atascadero State Hospital\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The Eighth Amendment has, as\nan essential prerequisite, the right to punish. DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S.\n189, 199 n. 6, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (\"The State does not acquire the power to punish with which the\nEighth Amendment is concerned until after it has secured a formal adjudication of guilt in accordance with due\nprocess of law.\"). Here, SVPs are detained for the purpose of treatment, and the state's power to punish them\nexpires at the end of their sentence. Accordingly, the Eighth Amendment is not the proper vehicle to challenge the\n998 conditions of civil *998 commitment. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447\n(1979).\nThe thrust of Plaintiffs' claim here is that because the conditions of confinement amount to punishment, they\nshould be permitted to argue that this \"punishment\" is cruel and unusual. Once again, this \"punitive as applied\"\nargument is foreclosed by Seling. Therefore, we find that the district court erred when it failed to dismiss the\nEighth Amendment claim against Defendants.\nOf course, this is a small victory for Defendants, because the same claims for inhumane treatment and failure to\nprotect may be raised under the Fourteenth Amendment. The standard applicable to SVPs under the Fourteenth\nAmendment are at least coextensive with that applicable to prisoners under the Eighth Amendment. See, e.g., \nMunoz v. Kolender, 208 F.Supp.2d 1125 (S.D.Cal.2002) (applying Fourteenth Amendment standards to SVPs\nbecause \"comparable standards apply to both prisoners' Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment and\nFourteenth Amendment substantive due process analyses, with Fourteenth Amendment analysis borrowing from\nEighth Amendment standards.\"); Frost v. Agnos, 152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir.1998) (applying Eighth Amendment\nstandards to evaluate pretrial detainees' Fourteenth Amendment claims). Moreover, the Eighth Amendment\nprovides too little protection for those whom the state cannot punish. See Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 931-34\n(9th Cir.2004); Andrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052 (8th Cir.2001). Plaintiffs apparently recognize this, because their\nEighth Amendment claims largely duplicate those raised under the substantive due process clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, we consider, below, under the Fourteenth Amendment Plaintiffs' allegations\nthat Defendants' actions violate their due process rights.\n5. Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Rights Under the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nPlaintiffs raise a number of procedural due process violations against Defendants. Plaintiffs allege that\nDefendants force them to participate in the five-phase treatment program at Atascadero; force them to take\nmedication in nonemergency situations; and subject them to privilege reductions, access level reductions, and\nreclassifications. Plaintiffs allege that these deprivations occur without adequate notice of or opportunity to\nrespond to accusations of alleged sanctionable conduct.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment requires that no person be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of\nlaw. That is, even if Defendants may deprive SVPs of certain privileges, those deprivations may not be carried\nout without notice and an opportunity to be heard. Defendants do not challenge, at least at this stage, that\nPlaintiffs were deprived of certain privileges, or that these deprivations did not carry with them the attendant due\nprocess required under the Fourteenth Amendment. Rather, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not adequately\npleaded the loss of an established liberty or property interest when they are force-medicated, when their access-\nlevels are reduced, or when they lose other privileges.\nWe disagree. Convicted prisoners, pretrial detainees, and parolees all possess a liberty interest in avoiding the\nunwanted administrations of antipsychotic drugs. See, e.g., Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. at 221-22, 110 S.Ct.\n1028 (holding that prisoners possess \"a significant liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of\n999 antipsychotic drugs under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth *999 Amendment\" and identifying\nprocedures which comported with due process). Thus, at a minimum, an individual civilly committed under\nCalifornia's SVP Act has a right to procedural due process before being force-medicated in non-emergency\nsituations.\nNext, Plaintiffs allege that reduction of their access levels decreases, or in some cases eliminates, the\nopportunity to move around the facility without escorts and that it affects their right to other privileges. The\nreduction of an SVP's access level is similar to the transfer of prisoners from the general prison population to\nadministrative segregation. Such a transfer may deprive the prisoner of a state-created liberty interest. See \nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (holding that a state-created\nliberty interest in one's classification may exist where classification imposes \"atypical and significant hardship\"); \nsee also Barnett v. Centoni, 31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that a prison inmate was deprived of\nliberty and property because he was reclassified thereby losing certain privileges). Thus, Plaintiffs may have a\nliberty interest in their access levels and classifications that affect their privileges.\nIn sum, it is clearly established that an inmate has a state-created liberty interest and a right to be free from\nrestrictions that \"impose[ ] atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life.\" Sandin, 515 U.S. at 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293. Where Defendants have transgressed a line clearly\nestablished even in the prison context, we have no trouble deeming the line clearly established for SVPs.\nTherefore, we hold that Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process claims are based on clearly\nestablished rights.\n6. Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment Substantive Due Process Claims\nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants have violated their substantive due process rights because Defendants have\nfailed to protect them from the abuse of other detainees and employees. Their claims can be broken down into\nthree general categories: (a) claims that Defendants failed to protect Plaintiffs from the abuses of other persons\ndetained at Atascadero; (b) claims that Defendants failed to provide constitutionally adequate conditions of\n[14]\ndetention; and (c) claims that Defendants use excessive force against them.\nFirst, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants have turned a blind eye to the conduct of other persons detained at\nAtascadero State Hospital. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that they are intentionally exposed to feces, urine, vomit,\nspit, and blood in Atascadero's courtyards, bathrooms, hallways, dining rooms, and gymnasium, and that other\ndetainees contaminate their food with spit and other unsanitary taint. Plaintiffs allege that they are subjected to\nverbal harassment, physical abuse, and sexual assaults by other patients at the Hospital, and indeed that they\nare targeted because they are sex offenders. The patient population at Atascadero State Hospital comprises\nmales who are civilly or penally committed. The individuals committed at the Hospital are confined under a variety\nof statutes. See Cal.Penal Code § 1026 (covering patients \"not guilty by reason of insanity\"); Cal.Penal Code §\n\n1370 (covering patients \"incompetent to stand trial\"); Cal.Penal Code §§ 2962, 2964 (covering \"mentally\n1000 disordered offenders\" *1000 serving their parole time); Cal. Welfare and Institutions Code § 6316 (covering\n\"mentally disordered sex offenders\"); Cal.Penal Code § 2684 (covering mentally ill prisoners transferred to\nAtascadero State Hospital for psychiatric stabilization). According to Plaintiffs, their forced integration as openly\nlabeled \"sexually violent predators\" has subjected them to verbal harassment, physical abuse, and sexual\nassaults from the rest of the Atascadero population.\nPlaintiffs' right to be protected and confined in a safe institution are clearly established. See Youngberg, 457 U.S.\nat 319-22, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (stating that individuals who are involuntarily civilly committed have constitutionally\nprotected rights under the Due Process Clause to reasonably safe conditions of confinement and freedom from\nunreasonable bodily restraints). The right is clearly established for civilly committed persons and prisoners alike. \nSee Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (\"[P]rison officials have a\nduty . . . to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.\" (internal citations omitted)); Neely v.\nFeinstein, 50 F.3d 1502, 1508 (9th Cir.1995) (finding \"clearly established\" that patients have a \"constitutional right\nto be safe in the state institutions to which they are committed\"). Assuming Plaintiffs can prove the allegations in\ntheir complaint and Defendants' blindness to such conditions in Atascadero, qualified immunity would not be\nappropriate on these claims.\nSecond, Plaintiffs allege that the conditions of confinement are constitutionally inadequate, that they are forced to\nlive in squalid conditions that are inhumane and pose a serious health risk. Plaintiffs have a clearly established\nright not to be exposed to such unsanitary conditions. See Anderson v. County of Kern, 45 F.3d 1310, 1314-15\n(9th Cir.1995) (collecting cases in prison context); Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (establishing a\n[15]\nright to \"personal security\" for involuntarily committed persons).  Given the allegations in the Second Amended\nComplaint, Plaintiffs' claims as to the unsanitary and unsafe conditions of confinement cannot be dismissed\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\nPlaintiffs also allege several claims of excessive force, i.e., that (a) \"red light alarms\" are used when Plaintiffs\norally refuse to participate in treatment, even if they pose no threat of physical violence; (b) that shackles are\nused during transportation and during visits with family and friends; and, more generally, (c) that Plaintiffs are\nsubjected to \"excessive punishment . . . [and] excessive use of force and physical restraints.\" It is well-\nestablished that detained persons have a right to be free from excessive force. While excessive force claims by\nprisoners are reviewed under the Eighth Amendment's malicious and sadistic standard, Hudson v. McMillian, 503\nU.S. 1, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992), the more generous Fourteenth Amendment standard applies to\nthose who are civilly confined. As we previously stated:\nIf confinement of a sexually violent predator is civil for the purposes of evaluation under the Ex\nPost Facto clause, that confinement is civil for the purposes of defining the rights to which the\n1001 detainee is entitled while confined [in a *1001 treatment facility]. Civil status means civil status,\nwith all the Fourteenth Amendment rights that accompany it.\nJones, 393 F.3d at 933.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment requires that civilly committed persons not be subjected to conditions that amount to\npunishment, Bell, 441 U.S. at 536, 99 S.Ct. 1861, within the bounds of professional discretion, Youngberg, 457\nU.S. at 321-22, 102 S.Ct. 2452. Moreover, the \"due process requires that the conditions and duration of\nconfinement [for civilly confined SVPs] bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which persons are\ncommitted.\" Seling, 531 U.S. at 265, 121 S.Ct. 727; see also Jones, 393 F.3d at 931. While the nature of an\nSVP's confinement may factor in this balance of what is reasonable, it is clearly established that the substantive\ndue process protections of the Fourteenth Amendment apply to SVPs. See Andrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052,\n1061 (8th Cir.2001) (applying the Fourteenth Amendment's \"objective reasonableness\" standard to excessive\n[16]\nforce claims brought by civilly committed SVPs).\nWe also reiterate that SVPs must, at a minimum, be afforded the rights afforded prisoners confined in a penal\ninstitution. Thus, the Eighth Amendment still provides a floor for the level of protection that SVPs must receive\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, and because the contours of the Eighth Amendment are more defined, Eighth\n\nAmendment jurisprudence may provide helpful guidance as to the standards to be applied. Under the Eighth\nAmendment, the unnecessary and wanton force standard takes into account such facts as the need for the\napplication of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force used, the threat perceived by the\nofficer, any effort to temper the severity of the forceful response, and the extent of the injury inflicted, and whether\nthe force was applied for a legitimate purpose. Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d\n156 (1992). If Plaintiffs allege conduct that sinks below those protections afforded prisoners under the Eighth\nAmendment, then their claim certainly states a violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nPlaintiffs have alleged that force is used in retaliation for exercising legitimate rights and that the amount of force\nused is often a gross overreaction to the situation. Such use of force, if proved, is not reasonable and failure to\ncurtail such abuses cannot be said to be within Defendants' professional discretion. We affirm, then, the district\ncourt's denial of the motion to dismiss on these grounds.\nOn each of these three grounds 00 failure to protect, inadequate conditions of confinement, and excessive force\n97\n00 we believe that Plaintiffs may be able to state a \"clearly established\" Fourteenth Amendment Substantive Due\n97\nProcess violation, and we cannot, at the Federal Rule 12(b)(6) stage, dismiss these substantive due process\nclaims.\n7. Plaintiffs' Equal Protection Rights Under the Fourteenth Amendment\n1002 According to Plaintiffs, they are being treated more restrictively than other *1002 civilly committed patients. They\nallege that their conditions are more punitive than those under which all other civilly committed persons are held.\nFor one example, they allege that other civilly-committed persons are given priority in hiring for remunerative\npositions.\nEven though Plaintiffs do not constitute a suspect class, heightened scrutiny may be required where fundamental\ninterests are at issue. See Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169\n(1966); Police Dept. of City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). This court\nupheld application of a \"heightened scrutiny standard\" when evaluating an equal protection violation under\nWashington State's Sexually Violent Predator Statute. See Young v. Weston, 176 F.3d 1196, 1201 (9th Cir.1999),\nrev'd on other grounds, Seling, 531 U.S. 250, 121 S.Ct. 727, 148 L.Ed.2d 734. While Young was decided in 1999,\nit rested on a firmly established principle in existence at the time of events in question: that heightened scrutiny\nwill be applied where a fundamental liberty interest is at stake. See Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541, 62\nS.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942). Plaintiffs may be able to claim violations of several clearly established\nfundamental rights: a liberty interest in freedom from bodily restraint and personal security, Youngberg, 457 U.S.\nat 315-316, 102 S.Ct. 2452, and a fundamental right to access the courts, as described below. Accordingly, we\nagree with Plaintiffs that heightened scrutiny is the standard for equal protection claims implicating these\nfundamental rights. And we further observe that Plaintiffs, in line with their allegations, may be able to show that\nthe differential treatment between them and other civilly committed persons violates equal protection because\nsuch treatment does not meet heightened scrutiny.\nAt the same time, we cannot say that it is firmly established that every condition of an SVP's confinement is\nsubject to heightened scrutiny. In the prison setting, we have made clear that prison officials need latitude in\ndeciding how to run their prison, and we have refused to subject each classification drawn by prison officials to\nheightened scrutiny. Rather, a prisoner cannot challenge the conditions of his confinement on equal protection\ngrounds unless the discrimination against him is irrational or arbitrary. See McGinnis v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263,\n276, 93 S.Ct. 1055, 35 L.Ed.2d 282 (1973). That is, in so far as Plaintiffs' claims rely on classifications not related\nto fundamental liberty interests, Defendants will have qualified immunity unless there is no rational basis for the\nclassification.\nEven under the rational basis standard, we cannot dismiss Plaintiffs' equal protection claims at this stage.\nPlaintiffs' pleadings raise several questionable classifications. For example, it seems arbitrary that SVPs should\nbe treated more harshly that other civilly committed persons in job placement and privileges. Based on the\npleadings, we believe that Plaintiffs may be able to prove a violation of clearly established law congruent with the\nfacts alleged. Admittedly, at this stage, Defendants have not fully developed and presented the rationale for their\nactions and there may be differences between SVPs and other civilly committed persons that warrant differential\n\ntreatment. But we leave it to the district court, on a more full factual record, to consider whether the classifications\nPlaintiffs present are irrational and arbitrary.\n8. Plaintiffs' Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel and Fourteenth Amendment Right of Access to Courts\n1003 Plaintiffs claim that they cannot privately correspond with counsel, have *1003 telephone conversations with\ncounsel, and are otherwise hindered in their ability to prepare for their probable cause and commitment hearings.\nAccording to Plaintiffs, \"[t]his inability to prepare for upcoming hearings would clearly hinder Plaintiffs' access to\nthe courts and counsel.\"\nPlaintiffs have a statutory right to counsel in probable cause proceedings and in commitment hearings. Cal.\nWelfare & Institutions Code §§ 6602, 6603, 6605(d). To protect the right to counsel, \"a [detainee] must be given a\nreasonable opportunity to employ and consult with counsel; otherwise, the right to be heard by counsel would be\nof little worth.\" Chandler v. Fretag, 348 U.S. 3, 10, 75 S.Ct. 1, 99 L.Ed. 4 (1954). While the Sixth Amendment, by\nits express language, protects those in criminal proceedings, the Fourteenth Amendment protects all detainees\nagainst governmental interference in their right of access to courts. See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396,\n419-20, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) (overruled on other grounds); Cornett v. Donovan, 51 F.3d 894,\n897 & n. 4 (9th Cir.1995). The right of access to courts has been found to encompass the right to talk in person\nand on the telephone with counsel in confidential settings, Procunier, 416 U.S. at 419, 94 S.Ct. 1800; Ching v.\nLewis, 895 F.2d 608, 609 (9th Cir.1990), and to use available law library resources, Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083\n(1996), subject to legitimate restrictions related to the purpose and circumstances of detention. See Turner v.\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). Where such rights have been upheld in the prison\ncontext, there is no question that SVPs must be afforded rights that are at least as broad.\nSuch a fact specific inquiry can hardly be undertaken at this point, when it is not clear what Defendants have\ndone to impede access to the courts, or why they have done so, or how the Defendants' actions have affected\nPlaintiffs' right of access. We believe, nonetheless, that Plaintiffs may be able to state a violation of clearly\nestablished law congruent with their allegations and we affirm the district court's order denying Defendants' Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss as to Plaintiffs' Tenth claim based on access to courts.\n9. Plaintiffs' Right to Privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants' policies do not allow for privacy when showering, sleeping, using the toilets or\nparticipating in therapy sessions. It is clearly established that the Fourteenth Amendment protects a sphere of\nprivacy, and the most \"basic subject of privacy . . . the naked body.\" Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 494 (9th\nCir.1985). While the circumstances of institutional life demand that privacy be limited, it is clearly established that\ngratuitous invasions of privacy violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. Once again, we reach a highly factual\ninquiry where the facts are not fully developed: in Grummett, for example, we considered the gender of those\nprison officials who viewed inmates, the angle and duration of viewing, and the steps the prison had taken to\nminimize invasions of privacy. Id. at 494-95. Such facts are simply not available to us at this stage of\n1004 proceedings.[17] We believe, nonetheless, that Plaintiffs may possibly be *1004 able to state a violation of clearly\nestablished law congruent with their allegations, and as such we will not dismiss their claim under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n* * *\nIn sum, we affirm the district court's decision to deny qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' first, second, sixth, seventh,\neighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action to the extent noted above. We reverse and hold that Defendants have\nqualified immunity from suit on Plaintiffs' Ex Post Facto, Double Jeopardy, and Eighth Amendment claims.\nF. Defendants' Belief That Their Conduct Was Lawful Was Not Objectively Reasonable\nEven if Plaintiffs have alleged violations of a clearly established right, a government official is entitled to qualified\nimmunity if he or she \"could . . . have reasonably but mistakenly believed that his or her conduct did not violate a\nclearly established constitutional right.\" Jackson v. City of Bremerton, 268 F.3d 646, 651 (9th Cir.2001); see also \nAlford v. Haner, 333 F.3d 972, 977 (9th Cir.2003). This is a limited exception, however: if the law is clearly\nestablished, the immunity defense \"ordinarily should fail, since a reasonably competent public official should\n\nknow the law governing [the official's] conduct.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73\nL.Ed.2d 396 (1982).\nWhether Defendants' conduct was reasonable involves a factual analysis of the circumstances surrounding\nDefendants' actions and a determination of whether a reasonable official similarly situated would have been\naware that his/her actions violated the law, an inquiry difficult to conduct at this stage. Based on the facts in front\nof us, however, we do not believe Defendants can claim that their conduct was objectively reasonable. Again,\nDefendants argue that the volatile nature of the law surrounding SVPs entitles them to escape liability entirely.\nWe do not adhere to the theory that \"every dog is entitled to one bite.\" Defendants could not have been so\ncompletely in the dark about the standards that would apply to their conduct as it related to SVPs. As explained\nabove, SVPs are not entirely dissimilar from other groups of civilly committed persons. Moreover, Plaintiffs'\ncomplaint alleges practices that would be unconstitutional if directed at any prisoner. Accordingly, Defendants\ncannot escape liability based on a \"reasonable but mistaken\" belief about the constitutionality of their conduct.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part the district court's order denying\nDefendants' second motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Each side to bear its own costs.\nTROTT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\nMy disagreement with my colleagues is limited to one issue. We agree that plaintiffs cannot seek damages in this\nlawsuit against state officials in their official capacities, and that plaintiffs cannot seek damages from the State\neither. So, what is left where the officials are concerned? A lawsuit against them for acts and omissions alleged to\nhave been taken in the discharge of their official duties, but as individuals, not officials. It is here that I part\ncompany.\nOn this record, and under these circumstances, I conclude, with all respect to my colleagues, that these officials\n1005 as individuals are clearly entitled to qualified immunity *1005 against both suit and damages 00 now, not later. In\n97\nmy view, the particulars and the contours of the alleged constitutional rights upon which the plaintiffs rely were\nnot so clearly established at the times under scrutiny and at the level of specificity required such that a\nreasonable official hired by the state to cope with lawfully confined sexually violent predators subject to remedial\ntreatment would have been aware that the conduct alleged violated constitutional bounds. Given the unsettled\nnature of the law in this area, a reasonable official could certainly have believed otherwise.\nWe decide this appeal with clear analytical guidance from the Supreme Court:\nSomewhat more concretely, whether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held\npersonally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the \"objective legal\nreasonableness\" of the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were \"clearly established\" at\nthe time it was taken.\nThe operation of this standard, however, depends substantially upon the level of generality at\nwhich the relevant \"legal rule\" is to be identified. For example, the right to due process of law is\nquite clearly established by the Due Process Clause, and thus there is a sense in which any\naction that violates that Clause (no matter how unclear it may be that the particular action is a\nviolation) violates a clearly established right. Much the same could be said of any other\nconstitutional or statutory violation. But if the test of \"clearly established law\" were to be applied at\nthis level of generality, it would bear no relationship to the \"objective legal reasonableness\" that is\nthe touchstone of Harlow. Plaintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity that our\ncases plainly establish into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of\nextremely abstract rights. Harlow would be transformed from a guarantee of immunity into a rule\nof pleading. Such an approach, in sum, would destroy \"the balance that our cases strike between\nthe interests in vindication of citizens' constitutional rights and in public officials' effective\nperformance of their duties,\" by making it impossible for officials \"reasonably [to] anticipate when\n\ntheir conduct may give rise to liability for damages.\" It should not be surprising, therefore, that our\ncases establish that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been \"clearly\nestablished\" in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The contours of the right\nmust be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates\nthat right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very\naction in question has previously been held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing\nlaw the unlawfulness must be apparent.\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (emphasis added)\n(alteration in original) (internal citations omitted).\nAs my colleagues acknowledge, \"this suit is unique, in that it is one of the first widespread class actions to\nchallenge the conditions of detention for civilly confined SVPs.\" It is not only unique, but it requires us to answer\nquestions never before squarely addressed in this context. This factor alone should be enough to entitle these\nindividual defendants to dismissal.\nMy colleagues hang their analytical hat on Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 322, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d\n1006 28 (1982) for the proposition that \"civilly detained persons must be afforded `more considerate *1006 treatment\nand conditions of confinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.'\" This is a\nnice general quote mined out of context from that case, but it gets us nowhere in pursuit of an answer to the\ncentral question of whether we have in this lawsuit violations of clearly established rights. Why? Because \nYoungberg dealt with the confinement for their own good of mentally defective persons. In contrast, and as\nrecently recognized by the Supreme Court, sexually violent predators are confined in order to protect \"the public\nfrom dangerous individuals with treatable as well as untreatable conditions.\" Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 262,\n121 S.Ct. 727, 148 L.Ed.2d 734 (2001). In addition, the Court said that the case before it for decision \"gives us no\noccasion to consider how the civil nature of a confinement scheme relates to other challenges, such as due\nprocess. . . .\" Id. at 266, 121 S.Ct. 727. It is little wonder, therefore, that my colleagues admit in connection with \nYoungberg that \"it is not always clearly established how much more expansive the right of civilly detained\npersons are than those of criminally detained persons.\" I disagree with my colleagues' claim that \"it follows\nlogically [from Youngberg], then, that the rights afforded prisoners set a floor for those [rights] that must be\nafforded SVPs, and that where Defendants violate a standard that is clearly established in the prison context, the\nviolation is clearly established under the SVP scheme.\" Where does this come from? It sounds new to me.\nCertainly it is not a proposition clearly established and controlling at the time relevant to this lawsuit. Prisoners\nhave constitutional rights flowing from certain constitutional guarantees that do not apply out of the criminal\ncontext. Which clearly established \"prisoner rights\" are they talking about? I cannot find my colleagues' bold\nassertion anywhere in any case before this one. Where is the required level of specificity required to hold these \nindividuals constitutionally and monetarily responsible for their acts? It is nowhere to be found. Where is the fair\nwarning to them as to the constitutional limits of their compulsory treatment programs? Expanding and extending\nsome rights from other contexts and extrapolating others defies the purpose of the doctrine of qualified immunity.\nThe courts have yet to clarify how the Constitution protects sexually violent predators from various confinement\nand treatment modalities. Context is critical to the determination of whether a constitutional right has been\nestablished. This principle was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 110\nS.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990), a lawsuit filed by a mentally ill state prisoner complaining against treatment\nwith antipsychotic drugs against his will and without a judicial hearing. In holding that such treatment did not\nviolate either substantive or procedural due process, the Court said, \"The extent of a prisoner's right under the\nClause to avoid the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs must be defined in the context of the inmate's\nconfinement.\" Id. at 222, 110 S.Ct. 1028.\nWe read the same message in Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 608, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979): \"What\nprocess is constitutionally due cannot be divorced from the nature of the ultimate decision that is being made.\" \nSee also Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (\"[D]ue process is\nflexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\").\nNoteworthy in Washington v. Harper was a holding by the Washington Supreme Court that the individual\n1007 defendants were *1007 entitled to qualified immunity, 494 U.S. at 218 n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1028. The case was\n\nallowed to proceed, but only to consider claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under § 1983 as well as state\nlaw 00 which is precisely what should happen here. It seems that we are now requiring doctors and other staff to\n97\nconsult not just with lawyers before they devise a procedure or treatment for a sexually violent predator, but with\nthe courts.\nThe Supreme Court warned against this result in Parham, saying, \"Due process has never been thought to\nrequire that the neutral and detached trier of fact be law trained or a judicial or administrative officer. Surely, this\nis the case as to medical decision, for neither judges nor administrative hearing officers are better qualified than\npsychiatrists to render psychiatric judgements. . . . The mode and procedure of medical diagnostic procedures is\nnot the business of judges.\" Id. at 607-08, 99 S.Ct. 2493 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\nThe penalty for not anticipating a court ruling will be individual liability. This unfortunate situation is precisely what\nthe doctrine of qualified immunity is designed to avoid.\nI take issue also with my colleagues' assertion that because the facts are not yet developed, it is too early in this\nlawsuit to dismiss on qualified immunity. This claim misses the mark. As held repeatedly by the Supreme Court,\nqualified immunity is immunity from being sued, not just from damages. This principle explains (1) why the Court\nwarned in Anderson against non-specific pleadings that allege violations of \"extremely abstract rights,\" 483 U.S.\nat 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034; and (2) the Court's holding in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86\nL.Ed.2d 411 (1985) that, \"[u]nless the plaintiff's allegations state a claim of violation of clearly established law, a\ndefendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the commencement of discovery.\" The Court\nrevisited this issue again in Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). In the\ncourse of overruling a mistaken opinion by the First Circuit, the Court said,\nThe source of the First Circuit's confusion was its mistaken conception of the scope of protection\nafforded by qualified immunity. Harlow and Mitchell make clear that the defense is meant to give\ngovernment officials a right, not merely to avoid \"standing trial,\" but also to avoid the burdens of\n\"such pretrial matters as discovery . . ., as `[i]nquiries of this kind can be peculiarly disruptive of\neffective government.'\"\nId. at 308, 116 S.Ct. 834 (quoting Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457\nU.S. 800, 817, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982))) (alterations in original). The Court, in reversing us in\n1991 on this very issue, said, \"[W]e repeatedly have stressed the importance of resolving immunity questions at\nthe earliest possible stage in litigation.\" Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589\n(1991).\nFinally, my colleagues express their caution \"not to eviscerate the notice pleading standard\" that the system\ngenerally uses to commence a lawsuit. I do not believe this caution is well suited to this context. Again, I reiterate\nthat the question of qualified immunity requires prompt resolution. Anderson would seem to require pleadings\nmore specific than the usual \"notice\" standard. At the very least, pleadings against state officials in their individual\ncapacities must demonstrate an alleged violation of a particularized and relevant constitutional right which has\n1008 been clearly established. Hunter v. Bryant also would seem to so require. To hold otherwise is *1008 to disserve\na doctrine that calls for resolution at the \"earliest possible stage\" in litigation. Id. at 227, 112 S.Ct. 534.\nThe question remains, how specific must the right allegedly violated be defined in order to answer the question\nwhether it was clearly established? Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) gives\nus a good example of the degree of specificity required. In Wilson, the Court concluded first that officers who took\nmembers of the media into a homeowner's home to observe and to record the execution of an arrest warrant did\nso in clear violation of the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless, the Court concluded also that the officials who did\nso were entitled to qualified immunity. The Court said that the appropriate question \"is . . . whether a reasonable\nofficer could have believed that bringing members of the media into a home during the execution of an arrest\nwarrant was lawful. . . .\" Id. at 615, 119 S.Ct. 1692. Concluding that at the time of the violation the law was \"at\nbest undeveloped,\" the Court said, \"Given such an undeveloped state of the law, the officers in this case cannot\nhave been `expected to predict the future course of constitutional law.'\" Id. at 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692 (quoting \nProcunier v. Navarette, 434 U.S. 555, 562, 98 S.Ct. 855, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978)).\n\nFrom these precedents, I conclude that the proper question in this case is whether it was clearly established at\nthe time of the events in this case that the Constitution prohibited these individual officials from engaging in any\nof the actionable behaviors attributed to them in connection with the management and treatment of sexually\nviolent predators civilly confined under state law for treatment and for the protection of the public. After reviewing\nall the relevant cases and authorities, I answer this question in the negative.\nViewed in this light the analytical error made by my colleagues becomes quite apparent when they say,\nThus, there are two bodies of law from which we might draw \"clearly established\" law for qualified\nimmunity purposes: first, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is clearly established\neven in the prison context, and second, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is clearly\nestablished for all civilly detained persons.\nWhat this acknowledges is that we cannot find any clearly established substantive rights in the SVP context, so\nwe have to borrow them from other areas, such as prison rights and the rights of persons civilly detained for their\nown good and who pose a demonstrated threat to society. An approach like this certainly works well when the\nquestion is what constitutional rights might these sexually violent predators have in this system, but it fails utterly\nwhen the issue is whether we hold individuals liable ex post facto for their actions.\nThis lawsuit should proceed so that specific answers can be found to the constitutional questions raised by the\nplaintiffs, but it should proceed only in connection with possible declaratory or injunctive relief. To do otherwise\nwill deter government officials in the future from doing anything not to the liking of a sexually violent predator. The\npenalty for making a good faith mistake in an area of undeveloped law may be the costs of a lawsuit and the\npotential personal liability arising out of the official performance of a state job.\n[1] The following facts are taken from the complaint and are assumed to be true for purposes of reviewing this\nmotion to dismiss.\n[2] Although the SVP Act is gender-neutral, there was only one female SVP at the time of the filing of this\ncomplaint. She was not housed at Atascadero, and was, therefore, not included as part of the Plaintiffs' class.\n[3] As explained in the complaint, all persons at Atascadero are assigned an Access Level that dictates access to\nvarious facilities and privileges. A Level 1 patient may not leave his unit without an escort, a Level 2 patient may\nleave his unit, but cannot go to the courtyard or canteen, a Level 3 patient may have some access to the law\nlibrary, canteen and courtyard, etc.\n[4] At oral argument it was alleged that, since the time Plaintiffs filed their complaint, three (of the over seven\nhundred) people committed under the Sexually Violent Predators Act have been released into their communities.\n[5] The second amended complaint substituted Melvin Hunter, the current Executive Director at Atascadero State\nHospital, for Jon DeMorales, the former Executive Director, but contained no substantive alterations.\n[6] With all respect to our dissenting colleague, Plaintiffs' complaint states more than \"violations of extremely\nabstract rights.\" See Dissent at 5962 (citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97\nL.Ed.2d 523 (1987)). Maybe Plaintiffs can support these claims with evidentiary support and maybe they can't.\nMaybe Defendants can justify their behavior, or at least convince us that their conduct was not clearly in violation\nof Plaintiffs' rights. But the point of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not to evaluate the veracity of Plaintiffs' allegations,\nor to speculate as to Defendants' justifications for their actions. Rather, unless it is \"beyond doubt\" that the\nplaintiff cannot prove facts that would entitle him to relief, the Rule 12(b)(6) motion must be denied. See Navarro\nv. Block, 250 F.3d 729 (9th Cir.2001). The standard is no different for a civil rights claim than for any other claim. \nSee Galbraith, 307 F.3d at 1125-26.\n[7] Defendants also suggest that the federal courts should \"abstain\" under the \"Abstention Doctrine.\" They\nappear to confuse abstention with denial of pendent jurisdiction under the \"novel and complex\" clause of 28\nU.S.C. § 1367(c). If they meant abstention proper, they waived that argument because they failed to raise\nabstention before the District Court. See Conn. Gen. Life Ins. v. New Images of Beverly Hills, 321 F.3d 878, 882\n\n(9th Cir.2003). Nor do we see any reason that the federal courts would abstain in this situation. Pullman\nabstention is not appropriate because the driving force behind each of Plaintiffs' claims is a right guaranteed by\nthe United States Constitution, and state court clarification of state law would not make a federal court ruling\nunnecessary. See R.R. Comm. of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 499-501, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941).\n[8] Contrary to our dissenting colleague's analysis, we see this as a very minor analytical step. The State detains\nprisoners for the purpose of punishment. It detains SVPs for the purpose of treatment, and its treatment has no\npunitive element to it. It seems entirely unremarkable, then, to say that the State cannot treat SVPs worse than\nprisoners. The \"only reasonable conclusion from binding authority\" is that the conditions of confinement for SVPs\ncannot be more harsh than those under which prisoners are detained. Blueford, 108 F.3d at 255.\n[9] We thus agree with our dissenting colleague that context is critical in constitutional claims. Nonetheless, this\nadmission 00 that it is not clear how much more extensive the rights of SVPs are 00 does not inexorably lead to the\n97 97\nconclusion that there can be no violation of clearly established law. It may not be clear exactly what due process\nrights are to be afforded SVPs, but surely it is clear that certain actions 00 forcing Plaintiffs to live in squalid\n97\nconditions, turning a blind eye to physical attacks against SVPs, and forcing SVPs to take medication as\npunishment or in retaliation for filing a lawsuit or for refusing to speak during treatment sessions 00 transgressed\n97\nthe boundary. Surely it would not require \"law train[ing]\" or clairvoyance to recognize that these actions, as\nalleged by Plaintiffs, do not comport with due process.\n[10] We note that Plaintiffs' original pro se complaint contains particularly persuasive narratives on this issue.\nSpecifically, it details how Atascadero personnel responded when they caught wind of this suit, altering schedules\nso that the coordinators of this action would not be able to work together, telling Plaintiffs that their meeting in the\nlibrary was an \"illegal assembly,\" limiting law library time, scheduling mandatory group sessions during the SVPs'\nlibrary time, and refusing to give SVPs drafting paper because it was \"only for the mental patients to draft\nappeals.\"\n[11] As explained in the complaint, a \"red light alarm\" is when ten to twenty staff members surround and restrain\nthe patient.\n[12] The excessive force claims under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment 00 e.g., forced medication,\n97\nexcessive use of red light alarms, and use of shackles 00 largely duplicate Plaintiffs' excessive force claims under\n97\nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and their claims for Substantive Due Process. We will consider all these\nclaims together, below.\n[13]Seling did not, however, alter our authority to consider implementation of the SVP Act on Plaintiffs' other\nclaims. See Seling, 531 U.S. at 266, 121 S.Ct. 727 (\"This case gives us no occasion to consider how the civil\nnature of a confinement scheme relates to other constitutional challenges, such as due process, or to consider\nthe extent to which a court may look to actual conditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to\ndetermine in the first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature.\").\n[14] Here we consider Plaintiffs' substantive due process allegations from their Second Alleged Claim, their Fifth\nAlleged Claim and their Seventh Alleged Claim.\n[15] In the prison context, claims of unsanitary conditions are evaluated under the Eighth Amendment. See \nAnderson, 45 F.3d at 1314. Although the Eighth Amendment does not apply here, similar standards may apply to\nSVPs under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Munoz v. Kolender, 208 F.Supp.2d 1125, 1146 (S.D.Cal.2002).\n[16] While Jones, Neer, and Seling are more recent cases, they do little more than restate the contours of law\nclearly established in Youngberg v. Romeo, a 1982 case, and Bell v. Wolfish, a 1979 case. Seling essentially\nrestates the Youngberg test, and Jones does little more than connect the line between Youngberg and SVPs\nbased on California's argument that the statute should be construed as a civil confinement statute. We believe a\nreasonable official reading Youngberg would have sufficient notice that they would be held to Youngberg's\nstandards of due process.\n\n[17] Moreover, we note that it is not, as Defendants hinted in their briefs to this court, the burden of the SVPs to\nshow that there is no compelling justification for the regulations, but rather the burden of the State to show that\nthere is such a justification. See Walker v. Sumner, 917 F.2d 382, 385-87 (9th Cir. 1990).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The clerk shall filed the attached amended\nconcurrence/dissent.\nOPINION\nPREGERSON, Circuit Judge:\nPlaintiffs-Appellees represent a class of approximately 600 civilly committed persons and those awaiting\ncommitment at Atascadero State Hospital pursuant to California's Sexually Violent Predators Act (\"SVP Act\"). In\nthis suit, Plaintiffs allege that the conditions of their confinement violate their constitutional rights. They request\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss based\nlargely on qualified immunity, but their motion was summarily denied by the district court. We have jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm in part, and reverse in part.\n[1]\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n1. California's Sexually Violent Predators Scheme\nThe SVP Act defines an SVP as a person \"convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims for\nwhich he or she received a determinate sentence and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the\nperson a danger to the health and safety of others\" i.e., is \"likely [to] engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\"\n[2]\nSee Cal. Welf. & Inst.Code § 6600(a).  At least six months before a person who has committed the predicate\noffenses is to complete his sentence, he is evaluated by the Department of Corrections and Department of\nMental Health. Id. § 6601. If those two departments agree that the person evaluated may be an SVP, a petition\nfor commitment may be filed by the district attorney or counsel for the county in which the evaluated person was\nconvicted. Id. § 6601(i). If that person is found by a jury to be an SVP who poses a danger to the health and\nsafety of others, he is civilly committed for an indefinite period to commence after his criminal sentence is fulfilled.\nId. §§ 6602-6604.\nOnce civilly committed, Plaintiffs undergo a five-phase treatment program. Phase One comprises group sessions\nthat educate the SVP about California's SVP Act. During Phase One, the SVP is required to attend and\n[3]\nparticipate in the treatment sessions. If he does not, his access level  is reduced and he is not allowed to\nadvance to Phase Two of the treatment program. In addition, an SVP's failure to attend or participate in the\n685 treatment sessions is used against him at future probable cause and confinement hearings. The SVP cannot \n*685 advance beyond Phase One unless he signs a statement in which he acknowledges that he has an \"illness\"\nthat requires \"treatment.\" Plaintiffs allege that the signed statements are often used against the SVP in future\nprobable cause and confinement hearings.\nPhases Two through Five of the treatment plan involve \"cognitive\" treatment. This treatment includes viewing\nvideos that depict violent or other inappropriate sexual activities while a repugnant odor or other unpleasant\nsensation is applied to elicit a negative association.\nEach year, a committed person has a right to a show cause hearing to determine whether his commitment should\nbe continued. Id. § 6605(a)-(b). If it is found that the SVP continues to be a danger to the health or safety of the\ncommunity, the person is committed for two years from the date of the finding. Id. § 6605(e). These successive\nperiods of commitment can be continued indefinitely, or until the SVP completes all five phases of treatment.\nUpon successful completion of Phase Five, the SVP is conditionally released under the supervision of the\nCalifornia Mental Health Department. According to Plaintiffs, \"only a handful of SVPs have been allowed into\nPhase Four and no SVP has progressed to Phase Five or ha[s] been found to be ready for release under the\n[4]\ntreatment protocol.\"\n2. The Current Lawsuit\nOn September 2, 1998, Plaintiffs filed a pro se class action, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in district court against\nDefendants-Appellants Stephen Mayberg (Director of the California Department of Mental Health), Cal A.\nTerhune (Director of the California Department of Corrections), Jon DeMorales (former Executive Director at\nAtascadero State Hospital), Grenda Ernst (Clinical Administrator at Atascadero State Hospital), and Craig Nelson\n(Senior Psychologist Specialist at Atascadero State Hospital) (collectively \"Defendants\"). Plaintiffs sought\ninjunctive and declaratory relief, as well as monetary damages, on the grounds that the policies and procedures\nthat govern Plaintiffs' confinement and treatment at Atascadero State Hospital violate Plaintiffs' constitutional\nrights.\nIn March 1999, the district court appointed pro bono counsel for Plaintiffs. Counsel filed an amended complaint\napproximately five months later. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss raised Eleventh\nAmendment and qualified immunity defenses. The district court denied Defendants' motion in a one line order.\n[5]\nPlaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 14, 2002.  Both the first and second amended\ncomplaints alleged that Defendants violated Plaintiffs' rights by, inter alia: (1) force-medicating Plaintiffs in non-\n\nemergency situations; (2) reducing Plaintiffs' access levels and other privileges as a form of punishment for\nrefusing to participate in treatment sessions or as retaliation for filing lawsuits; (3) putting Plaintiffs in restraints for\nnonthreatening and/or nondisruptive conduct, including the refusal to participate in treatment or therapy; (4)\n686 subjecting Plaintiffs to public strip-searches (sometimes *686 while in four-point restraints); (5) failing to protect\nPlaintiffs from abuse of other patients or of Atascadero employees; (6) failing to provide Plaintiffs with\nconstitutionally satisfactory conditions of confinement; (7) forcing Plaintiffs to participate in treatment; and (8)\ndenying Plaintiffs adequate treatment, thereby converting Plaintiffs' civil confinement to a de facto extension of\ntheir prison sentence.\nOnce again, Defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint, on the same grounds presented in\ntheir first motion to dismiss. The district court again denied Defendants' motion to dismiss in a one line order.\nDefendants timely filed their notice of appeal. Defendants contend that the district court erred by failing to rule\nthat the Eleventh Amendment, state abstention doctrine, or qualified immunity barred Plaintiffs' suit.\nANALYSIS\nA. Standard of Review\nWe review de novo the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss. Decker v. Advantage Fund, Ltd., 362 F.3d\n593, 595-96 (9th Cir.2004). Immunity under the Eleventh Amendment presents a question of law, which we\nreview de novo. See Demshki v. Monteith, 255 F.3d 986, 988 (9th Cir.2001). To determine if Defendants are\nentitled to qualified immunity, we review de novo whether governing law was clearly established at the time of the\nalleged violation and whether the specific facts alleged constitute a violation of established law. See Mabe v. San\nBernardino County Dept. of Pub. Soc. Servs., 237 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir.2001).\nAlthough a district court's denial of a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is not ordinarily\nappealable, the denial of a claim for immunity is appealable before final judgment under the collateral order\ndoctrine and is reviewed de novo. See Morley v. Walker, 175 F.3d 756, 759 (9th Cir.1999). All allegations of\nmaterial fact are accepted as true and should be construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. See Resnick v.\nHayes, 213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). The \"complaint should not be dismissed [under Rule 12(b)(6)] unless it\nappears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle the\nplaintiff to relief.\" Thompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 895 (9th Cir.2002).\nWe note, again, the special difficulty of deciding the motion to dismiss a Defendant on qualified immunity grounds\nat this stage. Under the notice pleading standard of the Federal Rules, plaintiffs are only required to give a \"short\nand plain statement\" of their claims. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 8(a)(2). Thus, \"[w]hen a federal court reviews the\nsufficiency of a complaint, before the reception of any evidence either by affidavit or admissions, [our] task is\nnecessarily a limited one. The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is\nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\" Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40\nL.Ed.2d 90 (1974).\nAs we recognized in Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952 (9th Cir.2004), a motion to dismiss on\nqualified immunity grounds puts the court in the difficult position of deciding \"far-reaching constitutional questions\non a non-existent factual record.\" Id. at 957. We strongly suggested that, while \"government officials have the\nright ... to raise ... qualified immunity defense on a motion to dismiss, the exercise of that authority is not a wise\nchoice in every case.\" Id. We find that especially true here. The policy justifying qualified immunity motions at this\n687 stage is to protect officers against the burden of *687 discovery and pre-trial motions. Behrens v. Pelletier, 516\nU.S. 299, 308, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). In this case, the parties had already engaged in discovery\nfor several years, and it appears that discovery was almost complete. Defendants could have presented this as a\nmotion for summary judgment, and we would have a more developed factual record to guide our decision.\nBecause Defendants' motion is framed as a motion to dismiss, we must evaluate the merits of Defendants'\nqualified immunity defense before we know the full extent of the alleged abuses at Atascadero, or the reason\nbehind Atascadero policy, or the level of involvement Defendants had in creating the conditions at Atascadero. As\nwe decide Defendants' motion, however, we are cautious not to eviscerate the notice pleading standard in suits\n\nwhere qualified immunity is at issue. See Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119, 1125-26 (9th Cir.\n[6]\n2002).\nB. The Law of the Case Doctrine Does Not Apply\nPlaintiffs argue that under the law of the case doctrine, we should not reach the merits of Defendants' appeal\nbecause Defendants' second motion to dismiss was barred by the district court's ruling that denied Defendants'\nfirst motion to dismiss. The relevant facts are as follows: after Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint,\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of failure to state a claim and qualified immunity. The district\ncourt denied Defendants' motion in a summary order, and Defendants did not appeal. Plaintiffs filed a second\namended complaint, in which they changed only the name of one of the Defendants. Defendants then filed a\nmotion to dismiss on grounds substantially similar to those stated in the first motion to dismiss. The district court\nagain denied the motion to dismiss in a summary order. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' second motion to\ndismiss is an impermissible \"second bite at the apple\" and should be dismissed under the law of the case\ndoctrine.\n\"Under the `law of the case' doctrine, a court is ordinarily precluded from reexamining an issue previously\ndecided by the same court, or a higher court, in the same case.\" Richardson v. United States, 841 F.2d 993, 996\n(9th Cir.1988) (citations omitted). For the law of the case doctrine to apply, \"the issue in question must have been\n`decided explicitly or by necessary implication in [the] previous disposition.'\" United States v. Lummi Indian Tribe,\n235 F.3d 443, 452 (9th Cir.2000) (citing Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. EEOC, 691 F.2d 438, 441 (9th Cir.1982)); \nUnited States v. Cote, 51 F.3d 178 (9th Cir.1995) (\"[T]he law of the case acts as a bar only when the issue in\nquestion was actually considered and decided by the first court.\").\nThe district court denied Defendants' first motion to dismiss and their second motion to dismiss in a summary\n688 order. *688 Thus the district court's grounds for rejecting Defendants' two motions are not explicit. Nor can we\nsay that any issue was decided by implication in the first summary order denying Defendants' first motion to\ndismiss. Either motion could have been denied for any number of procedural or technical reasons unrelated to\nthe substance of the motions. It is possible that Defendants' second motion was denied based on the law of the\ncase doctrine, or that the district court decided, in its discretion, not to apply the law of the case doctrine due to\nsubsequent changes in the law, or the \"manifest injustice\" that would result given the new party to the suit. See \nUnited States v. Alexander, 106 F.3d 874, 876 (9th Cir.1997). Because it is impossible for us to determine the\nbasis of denial of either motion, we conclude that the \"law of the case\" does not apply and address the appeal on\nthe merits.\nC. Eleventh Amendment Immunity and the Abstention Doctrine Do Not\nBar Plaintiffs' Claims\nDefendants concede that suits for injunctive or declaratory relief do not violate the Eleventh Amendment under \nEx parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). Defendants contend, instead, that Plaintiffs'\nrequest for monetary damages against them is barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution.\nDefendants are correct that Plaintiffs cannot seek monetary damages against state officials in their official\ncapacity. See Doe v. Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab., 131 F.3d 836, 839 (9th Cir.1997). But the Eleventh\nAmendment does not bar suits seeking damages against state officials in their personal capacity. See Hafer v.\nMelo, 502 U.S. 21, 30, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991); Ashker v. Cal. Dep't of Corr., 112 F.3d 392,\n394-95 (9th Cir. 1997).\nThe second amended complaint states that Defendants acted in and are being sued in their individual and official\ncapacities. This creates a presumption that Plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages against defendants in their\npersonal capacity. See Romano v. Bible, 169 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.1999) (stating a strong presumption in\nfavor of a personal capacity suit where an official capacity suit for damages would be barred). Accordingly, the\nEleventh Amendment does not bar Plaintiffs' claim for damages against Defendants in their individual capacities.\n\nDefendants also argue that they are immune from Plaintiffs' suit because Plaintiffs attempt to enforce pendent\nstate law claims in federal court. Plaintiffs refer, in their first, second, and tenth claims for relief, to provisions in\nthe California Constitution that parallel the applicable provision in the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs\nconcede that they could not prevail on a § 1983 claim based on a violation of state law, because § 1983, by its\nown terms, protects only violations of federal law. See Ybarra v. Bastian, 647 F.2d 891, 892 (9th Cir.1981).\nInstead, they cite California law only where it is legitimate to do so, e.g., where there is a state-created liberty or\nproperty interest at stake. See, e.g., Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 710-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs' claims are not barred on this ground, and we need not consider Defendants' arguments\n[7]\nthat Plaintiffs' state law claims are \"novel and complex\" under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).\n689  D. Plaintiffs' Section 1983 Claims\n*689\nDefendants' first substantive argument is that Plaintiffs have not properly pled a claim under Section 1983, in that\nthey are not proper defendants for a suit. \"To sustain an action under section 1983, a plaintiff must show (1) that\nthe conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) that the conduct\ndeprived the plaintiff of a federal constitutional or statutory right.\" Wood v. Ostrander, 879 F.2d 583, 587 (9th\nCir.1989).\nThere is no question that all Defendants were acting under the color of California law when they engaged in the\nalleged unconstitutional conduct. Defendants argue, instead, that their conduct did not cause Plaintiffs any\ndeprivation of their constitutional or statutory rights.\n\"A person `subjects' another to the deprivation of a constitutional right, within the meaning of [§] 1983, if [that\nperson] does an affirmative act, participates in another's affirmative acts, or omits to perform an act which [that\nperson] is legally required to do that causes the deprivation of which complaint is made.\" Johnson v. Duffy, 588\nF.2d 740, 743 (9th Cir.1978). Indeed, the \"requisite causal connection can be established not only by some kind\nof direct personal participation in the deprivation, but also by setting in motion a series of acts by others which the\nactor knows or reasonably should know would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.\" Id. at 743-744.\nIn limited circumstances, a person can also be subject to § 1983 liability for the acts of others. Although there is\nno pure respondeat superior liability under § 1983, a supervisor is liable for the constitutional violations of\nsubordinates \"if the supervisor participated in or directed the violations, or knew of the violations and failed to act\nto prevent them.\" Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989).\nPlaintiffs proceed on both of these theories: (a) that Defendants created policies and procedures that violated\nPlaintiffs' constitutional rights; and (b) that Defendants were willfully blind to constitutional violations committed by\ntheir subordinates. Because Defendants were directors and policy-makers for Atascadero State Hospital, we\nbelieve Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the constitutional violations they suffered were \"set in motion\" by\nDefendants' policy decisions or, at the very least, that Defendants knew of these abuses and demonstrated a\ndeliberate indifference to the SVPs' plight.\nDefendants are correct that, under Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d 628, 633-34 (9th Cir.1988), Plaintiffs will need to\nshow how the deliberate indifference or affirmative actions of each defendant caused a constitutional violation\nbefore they can seek monetary damages against any individual defendant. At this stage of pleading, however,\nthey need not specifically delineate how each Defendant contributed to the violation of their constitutional rights.\nIndeed, we do not see how, prior to discovery, they could plead the individual roles of each state officer with any\nmore specificity. Taking the statements in the complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs may\n690 be able to state a *690 claim against all of the named Defendants, each of whom played an instrumental role in\npolicy-making and enforcement at Atascadero State Hospital. Therefore, we hold that Plaintiffs have sufficiently\nalleged Defendants' role in the alleged constitutional violations against SVPs to survive this motion to dismiss.\n\nE. Defendants' Qualified Immunity Defense\nDefendants also argued that the district court erred when it denied them qualified immunity. As Defendants have\nconceded, qualified immunity is only an immunity from a suit for damages, and does not provide immunity from\nsuit for declaratory or injunctive relief. See Los Angeles Police Protective League v. Gates, 995 F.2d 1469, 1472\n(9th Cir.1993). Defendants instead argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity from all of Plaintiffs' claims to\nthe extent that Plaintiffs seek monetary damages.\nIn analyzing Defendants' qualified immunity defense, we must determine, taking the facts in the light most\nfavorable to Plaintiffs: (1) what right has been violated; (2) whether that right was so \"clearly established\" at the\ntime of the incident that a reasonable official would have been aware that the conduct violated constitutional\nbounds; and (3) whether a reasonable public official could have believed that the alleged conduct was lawful. See\nNewell v. Sauser, 79 F.3d 115, 117 (9th Cir. 1996).\nIn order to withstand Defendants' claims of qualified immunity, then, Plaintiffs must first allege a violation of a right\nthat was clearly established in 199800the time the alleged constitutional violations first took place. See Anderson\n97\nv. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); Sorrels v. McKee, 290 F.3d 965, 970\n(9th Cir.2002). To defeat qualified immunity, \"the right allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level\nof specificity before a court can determine if it was clearly established.\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615, 119\nS.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999).\nBut Plaintiffs need not establish that Defendants' \"behavior had been previously declared unconstitutional.\" \nBlueford v. Prunty, 108 F.3d 251, 254 (9th Cir.1997). In fact, \"precedent directly on point is not necessary to\ndemonstrate a clearly established right.\" Id. at 255. Rather, \"[i]f the only reasonable conclusion from binding\nauthority were that the disputed right existed, even if no case had specifically so declared, [Defendants] would be\non notice of the right and [officials] would not be qualifiedly immune if they acted to offend it.\" Id. If the occasion\nhas not risen for our circuit to reach a question, we may draw clearly established law from other circuits. Prison\nLegal News v. Lehman, 397 F.3d 692, 701 (9th Cir.2005); see also Jacobs v. City of Chicago, 215 F.3d 758, 767\n(7th Cir.2000) (finding a violation of clearly established law where there is \"such a clear trend in the case law\" that\nrecognition of the right is \"only a matter of time\").\nBefore we consider Plaintiffs' claims individually to determine whether they were clearly established, we address\na threshold question that applies to Plaintiffs' claims more generally. Defendants argue, as a broad proposition,\nthat damages are not appropriate in this suit because the law applicable to SVPs is still evolving. We\nacknowledge that this suit is unique, in that it is one of the first widespread class actions to challenge the\nconditions of detention for civilly confined SVPs. Nonetheless, we believe Defendants may have transgressed\n691 some clearly established boundaries, or at least, that their claims *691 cannot be dismissed at this stage of\nlitigation. First, civilly detained persons must be afforded \"more considerate treatment and conditions of\nconfinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.\" Youngberg v. Romeo, 457\nU.S. 307, 322, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982); see also Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th\nCir.2000). It follows logically, then, that the rights afforded prisoners set a floor for those that must be afforded\nSVPs, and that where Defendants violate a standard that is clearly established in the prison context, the violation\n[8]\nis clearly established under the SVP scheme.  Second, where there is a clearly established body of law that\napplies to all civilly committed persons, there is no reason that the law should not apply to SVPs as well. For, as\nwe have previously held:\nThe state cannot have it both ways. If confinement of a sexually violent predator is civil for the\npurposes of evaluation under the Ex Post Facto clause, that confinement is civil for the purposes\nof defining the rights to which the detainee is entitled while confined. Civil status means civil\nstatus, with all the ... rights that accompany it.\nJones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 933 (9th Cir.2004). Thus, there are two bodies of law from which we might draw\n\"clearly established\" law for qualified immunity purposes: first, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is\n\nclearly established even in the prison context, and second, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is\nclearly established for all civilly detained persons.\nAt the same time, we acknowledge at the outset that it is not always clearly established how much more\nexpansive the rights of civilly detained persons are than those of criminally detained persons. As discussed\nbelow, the rights afforded civilly detained persons are flexible enough to take into account the circumstances of\ndetention. The law generally requires a careful balancing of the rights of individuals who are detained for\ntreatment, not punishment, against the state's interests in institutional security and the safety of those housed at\nthe facility. See, e.g., Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 319-322, 102 S.Ct. 2452. In weighing those interests, it cannot be\nignored that, unlike the plaintiff in Youngberg who was civilly committed because of mental infirmities, SVPs have\nbeen civilly committed subsequent to criminal convictions and have been adjudged to pose a danger to the health\nand safety of others. Therefore, the rights of SVPs may not necessarily be coexistensive with those of all other\n[9]\ncivilly detained persons.\n692 *692 With these threshold issues in mind, we review each of Plaintiffs' claims to determine whether Plaintiffs have\nsufficiently pleaded a violation of clearly established rights.\n1. Plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights\nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants have retaliated against them for filing lawsuits regarding conditions at\nAtascadero State Hospital. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim that, as a result of preparing this suit and other complaints\nabout the conditions at Atascadero, Plaintiffs have been subjected to access-level reductions, harassment by\nAtascadero personnel, excessive room search and seizures of property, and that they have been denied access\nto the library.\nIt is clear that the Fourteenth Amendment right to access the courts survives detention. Bounds v. Smith, 430\nU.S. 817, 821-22, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977) (\"It is now established beyond doubt that prisoners have a\nconstitutional right of access to the courts.\"); Cornett v. Donovan, 51 F.3d 894, 898 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that\n\"right of access [to the courts] is guaranteed to people institutionalized in a state mental hospital regardless of\nwhether they are civilly committed after criminal proceedings or civilly committed on grounds of dangerousness\").\nSimilarly, punishment in retaliation for exercising one's right to access the courts may constitute a First\nAmendment violation. Rizzo v. Dawson, 778 F.2d 527, 531-32 (9th Cir. 1985). We have held that the prohibition\nagainst retaliatory punishment is \"`clearly established law' in the Ninth Circuit, for qualified immunity purposes.\" \n[10]\nPratt v. Rowland, 65 F.3d 802, 806 & n. 4 (9th Cir.1995). Given the facts alleged,  we believe Plaintiffs may be\nable to prove that they have been punished in retaliation for the exercise of their First and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights to file grievances about the conditions of their confinement. Accordingly, their claims should\nnot be dismissed at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.\nPlaintiffs also allege that Defendants force them to participate in treatment that violates their First Amendment\nrights. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants bar SVPs from progressing beyond Phase One until they sign\na contract admitting that they have an illness and need treatment. The decision to sign the contract is the ultimate\n\"Catch-22\": during re-commitment hearings, the contract is used against those who sign it as an admission of\nillness, and used against those who do not sign it as a refusal to be amenable to treatment. Plaintiffs also allege\nthat SVPs who attend but do not vocally participate in group treatment sessions are found by Defendants to be\n\"not progressing\"; accordingly, these SVPs do not advance to higher levels and are subjected to access level\nrestrictions. Plaintiffs argue that they have a First Amendment right to refrain from saying that they have an illness\nand to refuse to participate in treatment, and that Defendants may not punish them for exercising their rights.\n693 *693 We note that there may be a First Amendment right not to participate in treatment, a right respected by the\nlanguage of California's SVP Act, if not in its implementation. Specifically, the SVP Act directs:\nAmenability to treatment is not required for a finding that any person is a person described in\nSection 6600, nor is it required for treatment of that person. Treatment does not mean that the\ntreatment be successful or potentially successful, nor does it mean that the person must recognize\nhis or her problem and willingly participate in the treatment program.\n\nCal. Welf. & Inst.Code § 6606(b) (emphasis added). While it may be in Plaintiffs' interest to participate in\ntreatment, and the State may create incentives to encourage such participation, it is clear that \"[t]he right of\nfreedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the Constitution against State action includes both the right\nto speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.\" W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624,\n645, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943) (Murphy, J., concurring). As is the case with prisoners, civilly committed\npersons certainly retain those First Amendment rights not inherently inconsistent with the circumstances of their\ndetention. See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). The language of the\nabove statute strongly suggests that refusal to recognize one's \"illness\" or affirmatively participate in treatment is\nnot inherently inconsistent with the purposes for which SVPs are detained.\nGranted, Plaintiffs are not actually forced to speak. But in this case, the stakes for refusing to speak are so high\nthat Plaintiffs' participation in treatment is almost compulsory. Indeed, an SVP who exercised his right not to\nadmit his illness could be detained indefinitely: he would never advance past Phase One and his refusal could be\nused against him at his re-commitment hearing as a sign that he was not sufficiently \"rehabilitated\" to re-enter\nsociety.\nSeveral inmates who are criminally detained raised analogous arguments, on Fifth Amendment grounds, that\nprograms that force sexual offenders to admit and discuss those offenses violate their rights against self-\nincrimination. In McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002), the Supreme Court found\nthat a program did not violate the Fifth Amendment where the program \"did not extend his term of incarceration\n... [or] affect his eligibility for good-time credits or parole,\" and the only adverse consequence was that he was\nmoved to the less desirable non-treatment area of the prison. Id. at 38-39, 122 S.Ct. 2017.\nBut McKune explicitly left open the question of whether a greater deprivation of liberty might run afoul of the\nConstitution by essentially compelling detainees to incriminate themselves. At least one court, reading McKune,\nallowed an inmate to proceed past pre-trial motions on First Amendment grounds where the right to parole was\nconditioned on participation in treatment. See Wolfe v. Penn. Dep't of Corrections, 334 F.Supp.2d 762, (E.D.Pa.\n2004). Similarly, in this case, where the stakes for participation in treatment are so high, the deprivations involved\nin refusing to participate in treatment may rise to the level of compulsion that might violate the First Amendment.\nThe question at this stage, however, is not whether the right exists, but whether such a right is clearly established\nunder the First Amendment. Given the volatility of the law on this point, we cannot say that it is. The challenged\n694 programs are facially related to the purposes for which the SVPs *694 are detained, and while SVPs may have a\nright to refuse to participate in such treatment, it is not yet clear the extent to which the State can condition\nprivileges or advancement on participation in such treatment. As such, we believe these claims may be more\nappropriately considered for declaratory or injunctive relief.\nThus, we hold that Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims were based on clearly established law insofar as they\nchallenge action in retaliation for filing lawsuits. To the extent that the claim relies on a First Amendment right not\nto participate in treatment sessions, Defendants have qualified immunity, because the law on this point is not\nclearly established.\n2. Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment Rights\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants' policies and practices subject Plaintiffs to unreasonable searches, seizures, and\nunnecessary use of force. According to Plaintiffs, they are subjected to public strip searches; to retaliatory\nsearches of their possessions; and to arbitrary seizure of their personal belongings upon arrival at Atascadero.\nSVPs are also placed in shackles during transport to Atascadero and during visits from family and friends. When\nthey refuse to participate in treatment, they are subjected to \"red light alarms\" even if they do not post any\n[11]\nphysical risk.  Moreover, they are force-medicated as a means of intimidation and punishment, and for the\nconvenience of staff.\nAccepting these allegations as true, we believe Plaintiffs may be able to state a \"clearly established\" violation of\ntheir Fourth Amendment rights, and thus, the claims are not appropriate for dismissal at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.\n\nThe watchword of the Fourth Amendment in every context is reasonableness. As this court held in Thompson v.\nSouza, 111 F.3d 694 (9th Cir.1997), \"the Fourth Amendment right to be secure against unreasonable searches\nand seizures `extends to incarcerated prisoners.'\" Id. at 699. Thus, this protection certainly extends to SVPs.\nOf course, \"the reasonableness of a particular search [or seizure] is determined by reference to the[detention]\ncontext.\" Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir.1988). As with any detained person, there are\nconcerns that mirror those that arise in the prison context: i.e., \"the safety and security of guards and others in\nthe facility, order within the facility and the efficiency of the facility's operations.\" Andrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052,\n1061 (8th Cir.2001). But even so, qualified immunity does not protect a search or seizure that is arbitrary,\nretaliatory, or clearly exceeds the legitimate purpose of detention.\nUnder this framework, we cannot dismiss Plaintiffs' claim at this stage. The \"reasonableness\" of a search or\nseizure is a fact-intensive inquiry that cannot be determined at this stage. See, e.g., Thompson, 111 F.3d 694\n(9th Cir.1997) (evaluating the reasonableness of a strip search based on the manner and scope of the search,\nthe place, and the justification). It is impossible to make such a fact-specific determination when the precise\ncircumstances of the searches or seizures are not before the court and when the Defendants have not yet had a\nchance to explain their justification for the alleged searches or seizures. We cannot say, then, that Plaintiffs\n695 cannot possibly state a \"clearly established violation\" based on any facts consistent *695 with their pleadings.[12]\nTherefore, Defendants do not have a right to qualified immunity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n3. Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses\nPlaintiffs allege violations of the double jeopardy clause and ex post facto clause. While Plaintiffs concede that\nthese two clauses have punishment as an essential prerequisite, and that the SVP Act is a civil detention statute,\nthey claim that the SVP Act is punitive as applied to them. As such, they argue that their double jeopardy and ex\npost facto claims are not barred.\nIn upholding a law similar to California's SVP Act, the Supreme Court held that \"[a]n Act, found to be civil, cannot\nbe deemed punitive `as applied' to a single individual in violation of the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto\nClauses and provide cause for release.\" Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 267, 121 S.Ct. 727, 148 L.Ed.2d 734\n(2001). Similarly, the California Supreme Court stressed the civil nature of a sexually violent predator\ncommitment and rejected challenges to California's SVP Act based on the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy\nclauses of the federal constitution. See Hubbart v. Superior Court, 19 Cal.4th 1138, 1171, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492,\n969 P.2d 584 (Cal.1999). We believe Plaintiffs' claims based on the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses\n[13]\nof the federal constitution are foreclosed.\nPlaintiffs argue that Seling does not control because they are not \"seeking release\" as was the habeas petitioner\nin Seling. They raise a purely artificial difference. The court in Seling made it abundantly clear that the civil nature\nof the SVP scheme \"cannot be altered based merely on the vagaries in implementation of the authorizing\nstatute.\" Id. at 263, 121 S.Ct. 727. Accordingly, we find that the civil nature of California's SVP Act is not altered\nbecause of the remedy sought and we reverse the district court's order denying Defendants' motion to dismiss as\nto the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy Clause related claims.\n4. Plaintiffs' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Claims\nPlaintiffs allege in their complaint that the \"restrictive and denigrating conditions\" at the Atascadero State Hospital\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The Eighth Amendment has, as\nan essential prerequisite, the right to punish. DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S.\n189, 199 n. 6, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (\"The State does not acquire the power to punish with which the\nEighth Amendment is concerned until after it has secured a formal adjudication of guilt in accordance with due\n696 process of law.\"). Here, SVPs are detained for the purpose of treatment, and the *696 state's power to punish\nthem expires at the end of their sentence. Accordingly, the Eighth Amendment is not the proper vehicle to\n\nchallenge the conditions of civil commitment. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nThe thrust of Plaintiffs' claim here is that because the conditions of confinement amount to punishment, they\nshould be permitted to argue that this \"punishment\" is cruel and unusual. Once again, this \"punitive as applied\"\nargument is foreclosed by Seling. Therefore, we find that the district court erred when it failed to dismiss the\nEighth Amendment claim against Defendants.\nOf course, this is a small victory for Defendants, because the same claims for inhumane treatment and failure to\nprotect may be raised under the Fourteenth Amendment. The standard applicable to SVPs under the Fourteenth\nAmendment are at least coextensive with that applicable to prisoners under the Eighth Amendment. See, e.g., \nMunoz v. Kolender, 208 F.Supp.2d 1125 (S.D.Cal.2002) (applying Fourteenth Amendment standards to SVPs\nbecause \"comparable standards apply to both prisoners' Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment and\nFourteenth Amendment substantive due process analyses, with Fourteenth Amendment analysis borrowing from\nEighth Amendment standards.\"); Frost v. Agnos, 152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir.1998) (applying Eighth Amendment\nstandards to evaluate pretrial detainees' Fourteenth Amendment claims). Moreover, the Eighth Amendment\nprovides too little protection for those whom the state cannot punish. See Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 931-34\n(9th Cir.2004); Andrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052 (8th Cir.2001). Plaintiffs apparently recognize this, because their\nEighth Amendment claims largely duplicate those raised under the substantive due process clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, we consider, below, under the Fourteenth Amendment Plaintiffs' allegations\nthat Defendants' actions violate their due process rights.\n5. Plaintiffs' Procedural Due Process Rights Under the Fourteenth\nAmendment\nPlaintiffs raise a number of procedural due process violations against Defendants. Plaintiffs allege that\nDefendants force them to participate in the five-phase treatment program at Atascadero; force them to take\nmedication in non-emergency situations; and subject them to privilege reductions, access level reductions, and\nreclassifications. Plaintiffs allege that these deprivations occur without adequate notice of or opportunity to\nrespond to accusations of alleged sanctionable conduct.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment requires that no person be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of\nlaw. That is, even if Defendants may deprive SVPs of certain privileges, those deprivations may not be carried\nout without notice and an opportunity to be heard. Defendants do not challenge, at least at this stage, that\nPlaintiffs were deprived of certain privileges, or that these deprivations did not carry with them the attendant due\nprocess required under the Fourteenth Amendment. Rather, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not adequately\npleaded the loss of an established liberty or property interest when they are force-medicated, when their access-\nlevels are reduced, or when they lose other privileges.\nWe disagree. Convicted prisoners, pretrial detainees, and parolees all possess a liberty interest in avoiding the\nunwanted administrations of antipsychotic drugs. See, e.g., Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. at 221-22, 110 S.Ct.\n697 1028 (holding *697 that prisoners possess \"a significant liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of\nantipsychotic drugs under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\" and identifying procedures\nwhich comported with due process). Thus, at a minimum, an individual civilly committed under California's SVP\nAct has a right to procedural due process before being force-medicated in non-emergency situations.\nNext, Plaintiffs allege that reduction of their access levels decreases, or in some cases eliminates, the\nopportunity to move around the facility without escorts and that it affects their right to other privileges. The\nreduction of an SVP's access level is similar to the transfer of prisoners from the general prison population to\nadministrative segregation. Such a transfer may deprive the prisoner of a state-created liberty interest. See \nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (holding that a state-created\nliberty interest in one's classification may exist where classification imposes \"atypical and significant hardship\"); \nsee also Barnett v. Centoni, 31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that a prison inmate was deprived of\n\nliberty and property because he was reclassified thereby losing certain privileges). Thus, Plaintiffs may have a\nliberty interest in their access levels and classifications that affect their privileges.\nIn sum, it is clearly established that an inmate has a state-created liberty interest and a right to be free from\nrestrictions that \"impose[] atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life.\" Sandin, 515 U.S. at 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293. Where Defendants have transgressed a line clearly\nestablished even in the prison context, we have no trouble deeming the line clearly established for SVPs.\nTherefore, we hold that Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process claims are based on clearly\nestablished rights.\n6. Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment Substantive Due Process Claims\nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants have violated their substantive due process rights because Defendants have\nfailed to protect them from the abuse of other detainees and employees. Their claims can be broken down into\nthree general categories: (a) claims that Defendants failed to protect Plaintiffs from the abuses of other persons\ndetained at Atascadero; (b) claims that Defendants failed to provide constitutionally adequate conditions of\n[14]\ndetention; and (c) claims that Defendants use excessive force against them.\nFirst, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants have turned a blind eye to the conduct of other persons detained at\nAtascadero State Hospital. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that they are intentionally exposed to feces, urine, vomit,\nspit, and blood in Atascadero's courtyards, bathrooms, hallways, dining rooms, and gymnasium, and that other\ndetainees contaminate their food with spit and other unsanitary taint. Plaintiffs allege that they are subjected to\nverbal harassment, physical abuse, and sexual assaults by other patients at the Hospital, and indeed that they\nare targeted because they are sex offenders.\nThe patient population at Atascadero State Hospital comprises males who are civilly or penally committed. The\n698 individuals committed at the Hospital are confined under a variety of statutes. See Cal.Penal *698 Code § 1026\n(covering patients \"not guilty by reason of insanity\"); Cal.Penal Code § 1370 (covering patients \"incompetent to\nstand trial\"); Cal.Penal Code §§ 2962, 2964 (covering \"mentally disordered offenders\" serving their parole time);\nCal. Welfare and Institutions Code § 6316 (covering \"mentally disordered sex offenders\"); Cal.Penal Code § 2684\n(covering mentally ill prisoners transferred to Atascadero State Hospital for psychiatric stabilization). According to\nPlaintiffs, their forced integration as openly labeled \"sexually violent predators\" has subjected them to verbal\nharassment, physical abuse, and sexual assaults from the rest of the Atascadero population.\nPlaintiffs' right to be protected and confined in a safe institution are clearly established. See Youngberg, 457 U.S.\nat 319-22, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (stating that individuals who are involuntarily civilly committed have constitutionally\nprotected rights under the Due Process Clause to reasonably safe conditions of confinement and freedom from\nunreasonable bodily restraints). The right is clearly established for civilly committed persons and prisoners alike. \nSee Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (\"[P]rison officials have a\nduty... to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.\" (internal citations omitted)); Neely v.\nFeinstein, 50 F.3d 1502, 1508 (9th Cir.1995) (finding \"clearly established\" that patients have a \"constitutional right\nto be safe in the state institutions to which they are committed\"). Assuming Plaintiffs can prove the allegations in\ntheir complaint and Defendants' blindness to such conditions in Atascadero, qualified immunity would not be\nappropriate on these claims.\nSecond, Plaintiffs allege that the conditions of confinement are constitutionally inadequate, that they are forced to\nlive in squalid conditions that are inhumane and pose a serious health risk. Plaintiffs have a clearly established\nright not to be exposed to such unsanitary conditions. See Anderson v. County of Kern, 45 F.3d 1310, 1314-15\n(9th Cir.1995) (collecting cases in prison context); Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (establishing a\n[15]\nright to \"personal security\" for involuntarily committed persons).  Given the allegations in the Second Amended\nComplaint, Plaintiffs' claims as to the unsanitary and unsafe conditions of confinement cannot be dismissed\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\nPlaintiffs also allege several claims of excessive force, i.e., that (a) \"red light alarms\" are used when Plaintiffs\norally refuse to participate in treatment, even if they pose no threat of physical violence; (b) that shackles are\n\nused during transportation and during visits with family and friends; and, more generally, (c) that Plaintiffs are\nsubjected to \"excessive punishment... [and] excessive use of force and physical restraints.\" It is well-established\nthat detained persons have a right to be free from excessive force. While excessive force claims by prisoners are\nreviewed under the Eighth Amendment's malicious and sadistic standard, Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 112\nS.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992), the more generous Fourteenth Amendment standard applies to those who\nare civilly confined. As we previously stated:\n699 *699 If confinement of a sexually violent predator is civil for the purposes of evaluation under the\nEx Post Facto clause, that confinement is civil for the purposes of defining the rights to which the\ndetainee is entitled while confined [in a treatment facility]. Civil status means civil status, with all\nthe Fourteenth Amendment rights that accompany it.\nJones, 393 F.3d at 933.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment requires that civilly committed persons not be subjected to conditions that amount to\npunishment, Bell, 441 U.S. at 536, 99 S.Ct. 1861, within the bounds of professional discretion, Youngberg, 457\nU.S. at 321-22, 102 S.Ct. 2452. Moreover, the \"due process requires that the conditions and duration of\nconfinement [for civilly confined SVPs] bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which persons are\ncommitted.\" Seling, 531 U.S. at 265, 121 S.Ct. 727; see also Jones, 393 F.3d at 931. While the nature of an\nSVP's confinement may factor in this balance of what is reasonable, it is clearly established that the substantive\ndue process protections of the Fourteenth Amendment apply to SVPs. See Andrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052,\n1061 (8th Cir.2001) (applying the Fourteenth Amendment's \"objective reasonableness\" standard to excessive\n[16]\nforce claims brought by civilly committed SVPs).\nWe also reiterate that SVPs must, at a minimum, be afforded the rights afforded prisoners confined in a penal\ninstitution. Thus, the Eighth Amendment still provides a floor for the level of protection that SVPs must receive\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, and because the contours of the Eighth Amendment are more defined, Eighth\nAmendment jurisprudence may provide helpful guidance as to the standards to be applied. Under the Eighth\nAmendment, the unnecessary and wanton force standard takes into account such facts as the need for the\napplication of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force used, the threat perceived by the\nofficer, any effort to temper the severity of the forceful response, and the extent of the injury inflicted, and whether\nthe force was applied for a legitimate purpose. Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d\n156 (1992). If Plaintiffs allege conduct that sinks below those protections afforded prisoners under the Eighth\nAmendment, then their claim certainly states a violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nPlaintiffs have alleged that force is used in retaliation for exercising legitimate rights and that the amount of force\nused is often a gross overreaction to the situation. Such use of force, if proved, is not reasonable and failure to\ncurtail such abuses cannot be said to be within Defendants' professional discretion. We affirm, then, the district\ncourt's denial of the motion to dismiss on these grounds.\nOn each of these three grounds00failure to protect, inadequate conditions of confinement, and excessive\n97\nforce00we believe that Plaintiffs may be able to state a \"clearly established\" Fourteenth Amendment Substantive\n97\n700 Due Process violation, and we cannot, at the Federal Rule *700 12(b)(6) stage, dismiss these substantive due\nprocess claims.\n7. Plaintiffs' Equal Protection Rights Under the Fourteenth\nAmendment\nAccording to Plaintiffs, they are being treated more restrictively than other civilly committed patients. They allege\nthat their conditions are more punitive than those under which all other civilly committed persons are held. For\none example, they allege that other civilly-committed persons are given priority in hiring for remunerative\npositions.\nEven though Plaintiffs do not constitute a suspect class, heightened scrutiny may be required where fundamental\ninterests are at issue. See Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169\n\n(1966); Police Dept. of City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). This court\nupheld application of a \"heightened scrutiny standard\" when evaluating an equal protection violation under\nWashington State's Sexually Violent Predator Statute. See Young v. Weston, 176 F.3d 1196, 1201 (9th Cir.1999),\nrev'd on other grounds, Seling, 531 U.S. 250, 121 S.Ct. 727, 148 L.Ed.2d 734. While Young was decided in 1999,\nit rested on a firmly established principle in existence at the time of events in question: that heightened scrutiny\nwill be applied where a fundamental liberty interest is at stake. See Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541, 62\nS.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942). Plaintiffs may be able to claim violations of several clearly established\nfundamental rights: a liberty interest in freedom from bodily restraint and personal security, Youngberg, 457 U.S.\nat 315-316, 102 S.Ct. 2452, and a fundamental right to access the courts, as described below. Accordingly, we\nagree with Plaintiffs that heightened scrutiny is the standard for equal protection claims implicating these\nfundamental rights. And we further observe that Plaintiffs, in line with their allegations, may be able to show that\nthe differential treatment between them and other civilly committed persons violates equal protection because\nsuch treatment does not meet heightened scrutiny.\nAt the same time, we cannot say that it is firmly established that every condition of an SVP's confinement is\nsubject to heightened scrutiny. In the prison setting, we have made clear that prison officials need latitude in\ndeciding how to run their prison, and we have refused to subject each classification drawn by prison officials to\nheightened scrutiny. Rather, a prisoner cannot challenge the conditions of his confinement on equal protection\ngrounds unless the discrimination against him is irrational or arbitrary. See McGinnis v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263,\n276, 93 S.Ct. 1055, 35 L.Ed.2d 282 (1973). That is, in so far as Plaintiffs' claims rely on classifications not related\nto fundamental liberty interests, Defendants will have qualified immunity unless there is no rational basis for the\nclassification.\nEven under the rational basis standard, we cannot dismiss Plaintiffs' equal protection claims at this stage.\nPlaintiffs' pleadings raise several questionable classifications. For example, it seems arbitrary that SVPs should\nbe treated more harshly that other civilly committed persons in job placement and privileges. Based on the\npleadings, we believe that Plaintiffs may be able to prove a violation of clearly established law congruent with the\nfacts alleged. Admittedly, at this stage, Defendants have not fully developed and presented the rationale for their\nactions and there may be differences between SVPs and other civilly committed persons that warrant differential\n701 treatment. But we leave it to the district court, on a more full *701 factual record, to consider whether the\nclassifications Plaintiffs present are irrational and arbitrary.\n8. Plaintiffs' Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel and Fourteenth\nAmendment Right of Access to Courts\nPlaintiffs claim that they cannot privately correspond with counsel, have telephone conversations with counsel,\nand are otherwise hindered in their ability to prepare for their probable cause and commitment hearings.\nAccording to Plaintiffs, \"[t]his inability to prepare for upcoming hearings would clearly hinder Plaintiffs' access to\nthe courts and counsel.\"\nPlaintiffs have a statutory right to counsel in probable cause proceedings and in commitment hearings. Cal.\nWelfare & Institutions Code §§ 6602, 6603, 6605(d). To protect the right to counsel, \"a [detainee] must be given a\nreasonable opportunity to employ and consult with counsel; otherwise, the right to be heard by counsel would be\nof little worth.\" Chandler v. Fretag, 348 U.S. 3, 10, 75 S.Ct. 1, 99 L.Ed. 4 (1954). While the Sixth Amendment, by\nits express language, protects those in criminal proceedings, the Fourteenth Amendment protects all detainees\nagainst governmental interference in their right of access to courts. See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396,\n419-20, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) (overruled on other grounds); Cornett v. Donovan, 51 F.3d 894,\n897 & n. 4 (9th Cir.1995). The right of access to courts has been found to encompass the right to talk in person\nand on the telephone with counsel in confidential settings, Procunier, 416 U.S. at 419, 94 S.Ct. 1800; Ching v.\nLewis, 895 F.2d 608, 609 (9th Cir.1990), and to use available law library resources, Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083\n(1996), subject to legitimate restrictions related to the purpose and circumstances of detention. See Turner v.\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). Where such rights have been upheld in the prison\ncontext, there is no question that SVPs must be afforded rights that are at least as broad.\n\nSuch a fact specific inquiry can hardly be undertaken at this point, when it is not clear what Defendants have\ndone to impede access to the courts, or why they have done so, or how the Defendants' actions have affected\nPlaintiffs' right of access. We believe, nonetheless, that Plaintiffs may be able to state a violation of clearly\nestablished law congruent with their allegations and we affirm the district court's order denying Defendants' Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss as to Plaintiffs' Tenth claim based on access to courts.\n9. Plaintiffs' Right to Privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants' policies do not allow for privacy when showering, sleeping, using the toilets or\nparticipating in therapy sessions. It is clearly established that the Fourteenth Amendment protects a sphere of\nprivacy, and the most \"basic subject of privacy ... the naked body.\" Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 494 (9th\nCir.1985). While the circumstances of institutional life demand that privacy be limited, it is clearly established that\ngratuitous invasions of privacy violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. Once again, we reach a highly factual\ninquiry where the facts are not fully developed: in Grummett, for example, we considered the gender of those\nprison officials who viewed inmates, the angle and duration of viewing, and the steps the prison had taken to\n702 minimize invasions of privacy. Id. at 494-95. Such facts are simply not available to us at this *702 stage of\n[17]\nproceedings.  We believe, nonetheless, that Plaintiffs may possibly be able to state a violation of clearly\nestablished law congruent with their allegations, and as such we will not dismiss their claim under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n* * *\nIn sum, we affirm the district court's decision to deny qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' first, second, sixth, seventh,\neighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action to the extent noted above. We reverse and hold that Defendants have\nqualified immunity from suit on Plaintiffs' Ex Post Facto, Double Jeopardy, and Eighth Amendment claims.\nF. Defendants' Belief That Their Conduct Was Lawful Was Not\nObjectively Reasonable\nEven if Plaintiffs have alleged violations of a clearly established right, a government official is entitled to qualified\nimmunity if he or she \"could ... have reasonably but mistakenly believed that his or her conduct did not violate a\nclearly established constitutional right.\" Jackson v. City of Bremerton, 268 F.3d 646, 651 (9th Cir.2001); see also \nAlford v. Haner, 333 F.3d 972, 977 (9th Cir.2003). This is a limited exception, however: if the law is clearly\nestablished, the immunity defense \"ordinarily should fail, since a reasonably competent public official should\nknow the law governing [the official's] conduct.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73\nL.Ed.2d 396 (1982).\nWhether Defendants' conduct was reasonable involves a factual analysis of the circumstances surrounding\nDefendants' actions and a determination of whether a reasonable official similarly situated would have been\naware that his/her actions violated the law, an inquiry difficult to conduct at this stage. Based on the facts in front\nof us, however, we do not believe Defendants can claim that their conduct was objectively reasonable. Again,\nDefendants argue that the volatile nature of the law surrounding SVPs entitles them to escape liability entirely.\nWe do not adhere to the theory that \"every dog is entitled to one bite.\" Defendants could not have been so\ncompletely in the dark about the standards that would apply to their conduct as it related to SVPs. As explained\nabove, SVPs are not entirely dissimilar from other groups of civilly committed persons. Moreover, Plaintiffs'\ncomplaint alleges practices that would be unconstitutional if directed at any prisoner. Accordingly, Defendants\ncannot escape liability based on a \"reasonable but mistaken\" belief about the constitutionality of their conduct.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part the district court's order denying\nDefendants' second motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Each side to bear its own costs.\n\nTROTT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\nI\nMy disagreement with my colleagues is limited to one critical issue. We agree that plaintiffs cannot seek\n703 damages in this lawsuit against state officials in their official capacities, and that plaintiffs cannot *703 seek\ndamages from the State either. So, what is left where the officials are concerned? A lawsuit against them\npersonally for acts and omissions alleged to have been taken in the discharge of their official duties. This is a\nmistake, and it is here that I part company.\nOn this record, and under these circumstances, I conclude, with all respect to my colleagues, that these officials\nas individuals are clearly entitled to qualified immunity against both suit and damages00now, not later. In my view,\n97\nthe particulars and the contours of the alleged constitutional rights upon which the plaintiffs rely were not so\nclearly established at the times under scrutiny and at the level of specificity required such that a reasonable\nofficial hired by the state to cope pursuant to statutory authority with lawfully confined sexually violent predators\nsubject to remedial treatment would have been aware that the conduct alleged violated federal constitutional\nbounds. Given the unsettled nature of the law in this area, a reasonable official could certainly have believed\notherwise.\nWe decide this appeal with clear analytical guidance from the Supreme Court:\nSomewhat more concretely, whether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held\npersonally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the \"objective legal\nreasonableness\" of the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were \"clearly established\" at\nthe time it was taken.\nThe operation of this standard, however, depends substantially upon the level of generality at\nwhich the relevant \"legal rule\" is to be identified. For example, the right to due process of law is\nquite clearly established by the Due Process Clause, and thus there is a sense in which any\naction that violates that Clause (no matter how unclear it may be that the particular action is a\nviolation) violates a clearly established right. Much the same could be said of any other\nconstitutional or statutory violation. But if the test of \"clearly established law\" were to be applied at\nthis level of generality, it would bear no relationship to the \"objective legal reasonableness\" that is\nthe touchstone of Harlow. Plaintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity that our\ncases plainly establish into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of\nextremely abstract rights. Harlow would be transformed from a guarantee of immunity into a rule\nof pleading. Such an approach, in sum, would destroy \"the balance that our cases strike between\nthe interests in vindication of citizens' constitutional rights and in public officials' effective\nperformance of their duties,\" by making it impossible for officials \"reasonably [to] anticipate when\ntheir conduct may give rise to liability for damages.\" It should not be surprising, therefore, that our\ncases establish that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been \"clearly\nestablished\" in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The contours of the right\nmust be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates\nthat right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very\naction in question has previously been held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing\nlaw the unlawfulness must be apparent.\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (emphasis added)\n(alteration in original) (internal citations omitted).\n704 As my colleagues acknowledge, \"this suit is unique, in that it is one of the first *704 widespread class actions to\nchallenge the conditions of detention for civilly confined SVPs.\" It is not only unique, but it requires us to answer\nquestions never before squarely addressed in this context. This factor alone should be enough to entitle these\nindividual defendants to dismissal.\n\nMy colleagues hang their analytical hat on Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 322, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d\n28 (1982) for the proposition that \"civilly detained persons must be afforded `more considerate treatment and\nconditions of confinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.'\" This is a nice\ngeneral quote mined out of context, but it gets us nowhere in pursuit of an answer to the central question of\nwhether we have in this lawsuit violations of clearly established rights. Why? Because Youngberg dealt with the\npassive confinement for their own good of mentally defective persons. In contrast, and as recently recognized by\nthe Supreme Court, sexually violent predators are confined in order to protect \"the public from dangerous\nindividuals with treatable as well as untreatable conditions.\" Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 262, 121 S.Ct. 727,\n148 L.Ed.2d 734 (2001). In addition, the Seling Court said that the case before it for decision \"gives us no\noccasion to consider how the civil nature of a confinement scheme relates to other challenges, such as due\nprocess....\" Id. at 266, 121 S.Ct. 727. It is little wonder, therefore, that my colleagues admit in connection with \nYoungberg that \"it is not always clearly established how much more expansive the rights of civilly detained\npersons are than those of criminally detained persons.\" I disagree with my colleagues' claim that \"[i]t follows\nlogically [from Youngberg], then, that the rights afforded prisoners set a floor for those [rights] that must be\nafforded SVPs, and that where Defendants violate a standard that is clearly established in the prison context, the\nviolation is clearly established under the SVP scheme.\" Where does this come from? It sounds new to me.\nCertainly it is not a proposition clearly established and controlling at the time relevant to this lawsuit. Saying that\nrights follow logically from one area to another is an admission that those rights have not yet been clearly\nestablished in the area to which they are being transported. Prisoners have constitutional rights flowing from\ncertain constitutional guarantees that do not apply out of the criminal context. Which clearly established \"prisoner\nrights\" are they talking about? I cannot find my colleagues' bold assertion anywhere in any case before this one.\nWhere is the required level of specificity required to hold these individuals personally responsible for their acts? It\nis nowhere to be found. Where is the fair warning to them as to the constitutional limits of their compulsory\ntreatment programs? Expanding and extending some rights from other contexts and extrapolating others defies\nthe salutary purpose of the doctrine of qualified immunity.\nI find more than significant the relative newness of the civil commitment procedure at issue in this case.\nCalifornia's Sexually Violent Predator Act was enacted in 1995. The constitutionality of this concept was not\nupheld until 1997, see Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997); and\nCalifornia's own courts did not begin definitively to iron out controversial statutory issues of treatment00such as\n97\ninvoluntary medication without a separate court order00until 2004. See In re Calhoun, 121 Cal.App.4th 1315, 18\n97\nCal.Rptr.3d 315 (2004). When did the acts complained of here occur? 1998, in the midst of grappling by appellate\ncourts with this new modality. In fact, the courts have yet to clarify how the Constitution protects sexually violent\n705 predators from *705 various confinement and treatment modalities. Context is critical to the determination of\nwhether a constitutional right has been established. The Supreme Court confirmed this principle in Washington v.\nHarper, 494 U.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990), a lawsuit filed by a mentally ill state prisoner\ncomplaining against treatment with anti-psychotic drugs against his will and without a judicial hearing. In holding\nthat such treatment did not violate either substantive or procedural due process, the Court said, \"The extent of a\nprisoner's right under the Clause to avoid the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs must be defined in\nthe context of the inmate's confinement.\" Id. at 222, 110 S.Ct. 1028.\nWe read the same message in Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 608, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979): \"What\nprocess is constitutionally due cannot be divorced from the nature of the ultimate decision that is being made.\" \nSee also Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (\"[D]ue process is\nflexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\").\nNoteworthy in Washington v. Harper was a correct holding by the Washington Supreme Court that the individual\ndefendants were entitled to qualified immunity, 494 U.S. at 218, 110 S.Ct. 1028 n. 5. The case was allowed to\nproceed, but only to consider claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under § 1983 as well as state law00which\n97\nis precisely what should happen here. It seems that we are now requiring doctors and other staff to consult not\njust with lawyers before they devise a procedure or treatment for a sexually violent predator, but with the courts.\nThe Supreme Court warned against this result in Parham, saying, \"Due process has never been thought to\nrequire that the neutral and detached trier of fact be law trained or a judicial or administrative officer. Surely, this\n\nis the case as to medical decisions, for neither judges nor administrative hearing officers are better qualified than\npsychiatrists to render psychiatric judgments.... The mode and procedure of medical diagnostic procedures is not\nthe business of judges.\" Id. at 607-08, 99 S.Ct. 2493 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\nThe penalty for not anticipating a court ruling will be individual liability. This unfortunate situation is precisely what\nthe doctrine of qualified immunity is designed to avoid.\nII\nIt would appear that my colleagues' approach to this case is at irreconcilable odds with cases from at least four\nother Circuits, the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Eleventh.\nIn Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701 (1st Cir.1993), a panel including Stephen Breyer, now\nJustice Breyer, observed that claims against government officials for money damages cannot proceed unless\npredicated upon \"clearly established\" statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nbeen aware. Id. at 704. In affirming a grant of summary judgment against the plaintiffs on the ground that the law\nrelied upon by them was not yet settled at the time of the actions in question, the Court observed that \"[t]he\ndetermination is time-critical.\" Id. In other words, no individual can be held personally liable for violating a law that\nhas not yet become particularized, which means fixed in connection with a precise context. First the clearly\nestablished law, then00and only then00potential personal monetary liability for public officials. Due process alone\n97 97\n706 would seem to *706 require such a sequence. As the Sixth Circuit explained in McCloud v. Testa, 97 F.3d 1536,\n1541 (6th Cir.1996),\nthe ultimate burden of proof in this suit is on the plaintiffs, who must establish that Testa's conduct\n[as a public official] violated a federal right so clearly established that any official in his position\nwould have understood that he was under an affirmative duty to refrain from such conduct.\nThe court went on to indicate that \"individual capacity defendants in § 1983 cases receive some benefit from\nlegal doubt about the clarity of existing law.\" Id. at 1542. The Eleventh Circuit would agree with this proposition,\nremarking that \"`[i]f case law, in factual terms, has not staked out a bright line, qualified immunity almost always\nprotects the defendant.'\" Smith v. Mattox, 127 F.3d 1416, 1419 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting Kelly v. Curtis, 21 F.3d\n1544, 1550 (11th Cir.1994)) (alteration in original). Relying on one of our cases, Lum v. Jensen, 876 F.2d 1385,\n1389 (9th Cir.1989), the Fourth Circuit remarked that public officials \"`are not required to predict the future course\nof constitutional law'\"; and that \"[r]arely will a state official who simply enforces a presumptively valid state statute\nlose her immunity from suit.\" Swanson v. Powers, 937 F.2d 965, 968, 969 (4th Cir.1991). The court concluded\nwith this wise statement:\nThe ills that would result from allowing suits for damages against state officials who simply\nperform their official duties are evident. Suits such as these have the potential to threaten the\nfoundations of our most basic governmental functions-in this case, the collection of the revenue.\nBecause the plaintiffs' asserted rights were not clearly established and because Secretary Powers\nacted reasonably in enforcing presumptively valid state statutes, we hold that she is entitled to\nimmunity from suit. The judgment of the district court is therefore reversed.\nId. at 973.\nIn so far as my colleagues insist on borrowing principles from other contexts, they part company with the Sixth\nCircuit, which has held:\nWe may not impose personal liability upon state social workers because they failed to anticipate\nthat principles of law developed in other distinct contexts would be applied to them, for to do so\nwould be contrary to the admonition in Anderson v. Creighton, 107 S.Ct. at 3039, that we should\nnot allow plaintiffs to convert \"the rule of qualified immunity into a rule of virtually unqualified\nliability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.\"\n\nEugene D. v. Karman, 889 F.2d 701, 711 (6th Cir.1989) (emphasis added). See also Adams v. St. Lucie County\nSheriff's Dept., 962 F.2d 1563, 1575 (11th Cir.1992) (Edmondson, J., dissenting) (public officials not obligated to\ndraw analogies from other cases), rev'd en banc,998 F.2d 923, 923 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (adopting the\nreasoning of Judge Edmondson's dissent and reversing district court's denial of summary judgment to public\nofficial).\nIII\nI take issue also with my colleagues' assertion that because the facts are not yet developed, it is too early in this\nlawsuit to dismiss because of qualified immunity. This claim misses the mark. As held repeatedly by the Supreme\nCourt, qualified immunity is immunity from being sued, not just from damages. This principle explains (1) why the\nCourt warned in Anderson against non-specific pleadings that allege violations of \"extremely abstract rights,\" 483\n707 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034; and (2) the Court's holding in Mitchell*707v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct.\n2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) that \"[u]nless the plaintiff's allegations state a claim of violation of clearly\nestablished law, a defendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the commencement of\ndiscovery.\" The Court revisited this issue again in Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d\n773 (1996). In the course of overruling a mistaken opinion by the First Circuit, the Court said,\nThe source of the First Circuit's confusion was its mistaken conception of the scope of protection\nafforded by qualified immunity. Harlow and Mitchell make clear that the defense is meant to give\ngovernment officials a right, not merely to avoid \"standing trial,\" but also to avoid the burdens of\n\"such pretrial matters as discovery ..., as `[i]nquiries of this kind can be peculiarly disruptive of\neffective government.'\"\nId. at 308, 116 S.Ct. 834 (quoting Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457\nU.S. 800, 817, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982))) (alterations in original). The Court, in reversing us in\n1991 on this very issue, said, \"[W]e repeatedly have stressed the importance of resolving immunity questions at\nthe earliest possible stage in litigation.\" Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589\n(1991).\nFinally, my colleagues express their intention \"not to eviscerate the notice pleading standard\" that the system\ngenerally uses to commence a lawsuit. I do not believe this caution is well suited to this context. Again, I reiterate\nthat the question of qualified immunity requires prompt resolution. Anderson seems to require pleadings more\nspecific than the usual \"notice\" standard. At the very least, pleadings against state officials in their individual\ncapacities must demonstrate an alleged violation of a particularized and relevant constitutional right which has\nbeen clearly established. Hunter v. Bryant also would seem to so require. To hold otherwise is to disserve a\ndoctrine that calls for resolution of the issue at the \"earliest possible stage\" in litigation. Id. at 227, 112 S.Ct. 534.\nIV\nThe question remains, how specific must the right allegedly violated be defined in order to answer the question\nwhether it was clearly established? Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) gives\nus a good example of the degree of specificity required. In Wilson, the Court concluded first that officers who took\nmembers of the media into a homeowner's home to observe and to record the execution of an arrest warrant did\nso in clear violation of the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless, the Court concluded also that the officials who did\nso were entitled to qualified immunity. The Court said that the appropriate question \"is ... whether a reasonable\nofficer could have believed that bringing members of the media into a home during the execution of an arrest\nwarrant was lawful....\" Id. at 615, 119 S.Ct. 1692. Concluding that at the time of the violation the law was \"at best\nundeveloped,\" the Court said, \"Given such an undeveloped state of the law, the officers in this case cannot have\nbeen `expected to predict the future course of constitutional law.'\" Id. at 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692 (quoting Procunier v.\nNavarette, 434 U.S. 555, 562, 98 S.Ct. 855, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978)).\n\nFrom these precedents, I conclude that the proper question in this case is whether it was clearly established at\nthe time of the events in this case that the Constitution prohibited these individual officials from engaging in any\n708 of the actionable behaviors *708 attributed to them in connection with the management and treatment of sexually\nviolent predators civilly confined under state law for treatment and for the protection of the public. After reviewing\nall the relevant cases and authorities, I answer this question in the negative.\nThe analytical error made by my colleagues becomes quite apparent when they say,\nThus, there are two bodies of law from which we might draw \"clearly established\" law for qualified\nimmunity purposes: first, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is clearly established\neven in the prison context, and second, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is clearly\nestablished for all civilly detained persons.\nWhat this acknowledges is that we cannot find any clearly established substantive rights in the SVP context, so\nwe have to borrow them from other areas, such as prison rights and the rights of persons civilly detained for their\nown good and who pose a demonstrated threat to society. An approach like this certainly works well when the\nquestion is what constitutional rights might these sexually violent predators have in this system, but it fails utterly\nwhen the issue is whether we hold individuals personally liable ex post facto for their actions.\nThis lawsuit should proceed so that specific answers can be found to the constitutional questions raised by the\nplaintiffs, but it should proceed only in connection with possible declaratory or injunctive relief. To do otherwise\nwill deter government officials in the future from doing anything not to the liking of a sexually violent predator. The\npenalty for making a good faith mistake in an area of undeveloped law may be the costs of a lawsuit and the\npotential personal liability arising out of the official performance of a state job.\n[1] The following facts are taken from the complaint and are assumed to be true for purposes of reviewing this\nmotion to dismiss.\n[2] Although the SVP Act is gender-neutral, there was only one female SVP at the time of the filing of this\ncomplaint. She was not housed at Atascadero, and was, therefore, not included as part of the Plaintiffs' class.\n[3] As explained in the complaint, all persons at Atascadero are assigned an Access Level that dictates access to\nvarious facilities and privileges. A Level 1 patient may not leave his unit without an escort, a Level 2 patient may\nleave his unit, but cannot go to the courtyard or canteen, a Level 3 patient may have some access to the law\nlibrary, canteen and courtyard, etc.\n[4] At oral argument it was alleged that, since the time Plaintiffs filed their complaint, three (of the over seven\nhundred) people committed under the Sexually Violent Predators Act have been released into their communities.\n[5] The second amended complaint substituted Melvin Hunter, the current Executive Director at Atascadero State\nHospital, for Jon DeMorales, the former Executive Director, but contained no substantive alterations.\n[6] With all respect to our dissenting colleague, Plaintiffs' complaint states more than \"violations of extremely\nabstract rights.\" See Dissent at 5962 (citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97\nL.Ed.2d 523 (1987)). Maybe Plaintiffs can support these claims with evidentiary support and maybe they can't.\nMaybe Defendants can justify their behavior, or at least convince us that their conduct was not clearly in violation\nof Plaintiffs' rights. But the point of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not to evaluate the veracity of Plaintiffs' allegations,\nor to speculate as to Defendants' justifications for their actions. Rather, unless it is \"beyond doubt\" that the\nplaintiff cannot prove facts that would entitle him to relief, the Rule 12(b)(6) motion must be denied. See Navarro\nv. Block, 250 F.3d 729 (9th Cir.2001). The standard is no different for a civil rights claim than for any other claim. \nSee Galbraith, 307 F.3d at 1125-26.\n[7] Defendants also suggest that the federal courts should \"abstain\" under the \"Abstention Doctrine.\" They\nappear to confuse abstention with denial of pendent jurisdiction under the \"novel and complex\" clause of 28\nU.S.C. § 1367(c). If they meant abstention proper, they waived that argument because they failed to raise\nabstention before the District Court. See Conn. Gen. Life Ins. v. New Images of Beverly Hills, 321 F.3d 878, 882\n\n(9th Cir.2003). Nor do we see any reason that the federal courts would abstain in this situation. Pullman\nabstention is not appropriate because the driving force behind each of Plaintiffs' claims is a right guaranteed by\nthe United States Constitution, and state court clarification of state law would not make a federal court ruling\nunnecessary. See R.R. Comm. of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 499-501, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941).\n[8] Contrary to our dissenting colleague's analysis, we see this as a very minor analytical step. The State detains\nprisoners for the purpose of punishment. It detains SVPs for the purpose of treatment, and its treatment has no\npunitive element to it. It seems entirely unremarkable, then, to say that the State cannot treat SVPs worse than\nprisoners. The \"only reasonable conclusion from binding authority\" is that the conditions of confinement for SVPs\ncannot be more harsh than those under which prisoners are detained. Blueford, 108 F.3d at 255.\n[9] We thus agree with our dissenting colleague that context is critical in constitutional claims. Nonetheless, this\nadmission00that it is not clear how much more extensive the rights of SVPs are00does not inexorably lead to the\n97 97\nconclusion that there can be no violation of clearly established law. It may not be clear exactly what due process\nrights are to be afforded SVPs, but surely it is clear that certain actions00forcing Plaintiffs to live in squalid\n97\nconditions, turning a blind eye to physical attacks against SVPs, and forcing SVPs to take medication as\npunishment or in retaliation for filing a lawsuit or for refusing to speak during treatment sessions00transgressed\n97\nthe boundary. Surely it would not require \"law train[ing]\" or clairvoyance to recognize that these actions, as\nalleged by Plaintiffs, do not comport with due process.\n[10] We note that Plaintiffs' original pro se complaint contains particularly persuasive narratives on this issue.\nSpecifically, it details how Atascadero personnel responded when they caught wind of this suit, altering schedules\nso that the coordinators of this action would not be able to work together, telling Plaintiffs that their meeting in the\nlibrary was an \"illegal assembly,\" limiting law library time, scheduling mandatory group sessions during the SVPs'\nlibrary time, and refusing to give SVPs drafting paper because it was \"only for the mental patients to draft\nappeals.\"\n[11] As explained in the complaint, a \"red light alarm\" is when ten to twenty staff members surround and restrain\nthe patient.\n[12] The excessive force claims under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment00e.g., forced medication, excessive\n97\nuse of red light alarms, and use of shackles00largely duplicate Plaintiffs' excessive force claims under the Eighth\n97\nand Fourteenth Amendments, and their claims for Substantive Due Process. We will consider all these claims\ntogether, below.\n[13]Seling did not, however, alter our authority to consider implementation of the SVP Act on Plaintiffs' other\nclaims. See Seling, 531 U.S. at 266, 121 S.Ct. 727 (\"This case gives us no occasion to consider how the civil\nnature of a confinement scheme relates to other constitutional challenges, such as due process, or to consider\nthe extent to which a court may look to actual conditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to\ndetermine in the first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature.\").\n[14] Here we consider Plaintiffs' substantive due process allegations from their Second Alleged Claim, their Fifth\nAlleged Claim and their Seventh Alleged Claim.\n[15] In the prison context, claims of unsanitary conditions are evaluated under the Eighth Amendment. See \nAnderson, 45 F.3d at 1314. Although the Eighth Amendment does not apply here, similar standards may apply to\nSVPs under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Munoz v. Kolender, 208 F.Supp.2d 1125, 1146 (S.D.Cal.2002).\n[16] While Jones, Neer, and Seling are more recent cases, they do little more than restate the contours of law\nclearly established in Youngberg v. Romeo, a 1982 case, and Bell v. Wolfish, a 1979 case. Seling essentially\nrestates the Youngberg test, and Jones does little more than connect the line between Youngberg and SVPs\nbased on California's argument that the statute should be construed as a civil confinement statute. We believe a\nreasonable official reading Youngberg would have sufficient notice that they would be held to Youngberg's\nstandards of due process.\n\n[17] Moreover, we note that it is not, as Defendants hinted in their briefs to this court, the burden of the SVPs to\nshow that there is no compelling justification for the regulations, but rather the burden of the State to show that\nthere is such a justification. See Walker v. Sumner, 917 F.2d 382, 385-87 (9th Cir. 1990).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

On appeal, plaintiffs argue that their claims are\nnot moot and that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motions to\namend and to transfer venue. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and we\naffirm. \nAn order dismissing a complaint as moot is reviewed de novo. Native Vill. of\nNoatak v. Blatchford, 38 F.3d 1505, 1509 (9th Cir. 1994). Orders denying motions\nto amend complaints, to transfer venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), and to extend\nthe period for effecting service of process are all reviewed for abuse of discretion.\nVentress v. Japan Airlines, 603 F.3d 676, 680 (9th Cir. 2010); Mann v. Am.\n \nAirlines, 324 F.3d 1088, 1090 (9th Cir. 2003 Jones v. GNC Franchising, Inc., 211\n);  \nF.3d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 2000).\nPlaintiffs’ claims are moot. A claim for injunctive relief is moot if plaintiffs\n“cannot reasonably be expected to benefit from prospective relief ordered against\nthe defendant.” Bayer v. Neiman Marcus Grp., Inc., 861 F.3d 853, 864 (9th Cir.\n \n2017). Where plaintiffs seek to enjoin unlawful practices at a facility in which they\nare confined, transfer to a different facility typically moots their claims. See Nelson\nv. Heiss, 271 F.3d 891, 897 (9th Cir. 2001); Dilley v. Gunn, 64 F.3d 1365, 1368\n2\n\nCase 2:98-cv-07167-TJH-AS   Document 328   Filed 09/26/17   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:682\n(9th Cir. 1995). Here, plaintiffs’ transfer from the Atascadero facility to the\nCoalinga facility mooted their claims against the defendants who were engaged in\nprison operations at Atascadero.\nTransfer does not moot challenges to system-wide practices, but plaintiffs\ncan only bring system-wide claims if a defendant in the action can provide the\nrelief sought. See Walker v. Beard, 789 F.3d 1125, 1132 (9th Cir. 2015). Assuming\narguendo that plaintiffs raised system-wide claims, the district court lacked\npersonal jurisdiction over the defendants who could provide system-wide relief due\nto plaintiffs’ failure to timely serve those defendants. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). The\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant an extension of time\nfor service, since plaintiffs sought the extension fourteen years after filing their\nSecond Amendment Complaint and did not show good cause. See Efaw v.\nWilliams, 473 F.3d 1038, 1041 (9th Cir. 2007).\nNor did the district court abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs’ motion to\namend their complaint. District courts must consider any evidence of bad faith,\nundue delay, prejudice, or futility when deciding a motion to amend. Royal Ins. Co.\nof Am. v. Sw. Marine, 194 F.3d 1009, 1016-17 (9th Cir. 1999). The district court\ncorrectly determined that the proposed amendment would be futile. The complaint\nas amended would not revive plaintiffs’ system-wide claims, since the second and\n3\n\nCase 2:98-cv-07167-TJH-AS   Document 328   Filed 09/26/17   Page 4 of 4   Page ID #:683\nthird complaints listed the same system-wide policymakers, neither of whom had\n \nbeen timely served. The facility-specific claims, brought against officials at\nCoalinga State Hospital and based on conduct alleged to have occurred there,\nwould be dismissed for improper venue even if the complaint were amended. See\n28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). The prejudice to defendants–who would suddenly find\nthemselves faced, in effect, with an entirely new lawsuit following the proposed\namendment–further supports the district court’s denial, as does the lengthy and\nunexplained delay in seeking amendment. The district court did not err in denying\nthe motion to amend.\nNor did the district court err in denying plaintiffs’ motion to transfer venue.\nJudges considering 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) motions make individualized, case-by-case\ndeterminations as to whether transfer is appropriate. Jones v. GNC Franchising,\nInc., 211 F.3d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 2000). Here, the claims set forth in plaintiffs’\nSecond Amended Complaint would remain moot even if the motion were granted.\nUnder these circumstances, the denial was not erroneous.\nAFFIRMED.\n4",

The SVPs allege\nnumerous violations of their constitutional rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983.\nThe district court had jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1343.\nThis Court has jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1291 and the\ncollateral order doctrine of Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541\n(1949) (jurisdiction of appeals from final decisions of the district courts).\nThe order appealed from was entered on August 26, 2003. Appellants flied\ntheir Notice of Appeal on or about September 22, 2003. The appeal was timely\npursuant to Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 4(a)(1)(A).\nREVIEWABILITY\nDefendants Jon DeMorales, Grenda Ernst, Craig Nelson and Melvin Hunter\n(Defendants) appeal fromthe summary denial of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss pa_s\nof Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (SAC) based on Qualified Immunity and\nthe Eleventh Amendment. Defendants' Motion to Dismiss was brought under Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure, Rules 12(b)(i), and 12(b)(6). This Court's Order to Show\nCause re Jurisdiction to hear the appeal was discharged and jurisdiction taken on\n\nNovember 25, 2003.\nSTATEMENT OF ISSUES ON APPEAL\n1. Should the claims for monetary damages brought under 42 U.S.C.\nsection 1983 against Defendants in their official capacities have been dismissedbased\non the Eleventh Amendment?\n2. Should the claims alleging violations of the California Constitution be\ndismissed based on the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution and\nthe abstention doctrine?\n3. Are Defendants entitled to qualified immunity for Plaintiffs' damages\nclaims since those claims are brought under criminal law theories that are not clearly\nestablished to be applicable to civil detainees?\n4. Are Defendants entitled to qualified immunity when a complaint fails to\nallege facts showing violations of clearly established constitutional rights of which\nreasonable officials in Defendants' positions would have known?\nSTATE APPELLEES' CONTENTIONS ON APPEAL\n1. The Court of Appeals should reverse the district court order denying\nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C. §1983 claim for damages from\nDefendants in their official capacities. Under the Eleventh Amendment a state\nofficial cannot be sued in his official capacity for damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n2. The Court of Appeals should reverse the district court order denying\n\nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims based on the\nCalifornia Constitution becauseUnder the Eleventh Amendment federal courts must\nabstain from establishing new rights under a stateconstitution.\n3. The Court of Appeals should reverse the district court's denial of\nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' alleged claims under the Fourth, Sixth and\nEighth Amendments, andthe Double Jeopardy Clause, andtheEx Post Facto Clause\nbased on qualified immunity. Those claims are based on an \"as applied\" application\nof criminal law jurisprudence to the civilly committed and reasonable officials in\nDefendants' positions would not have lmown that such jurisprudence was applicable.\n4. The Court of Appeals should reverse the district court's denial of\nqualified immunity because Plaintiffs fail to allege specific constitutional violations\nby specific Defendants as required.\n5. The Court of Appeals should reverse the district court's denial of\nqualified immunity because Plaintiffs fail to allege violations of clearly established\nconstitutional law by Defendants.\n6. The Court of Appeals should reverse the district court's denial of\nqualified immunity because Plaintiffs allegations are such that reasonable officials\nin Defendants' positions would believe their conduct lawful.\nPROCEDURAL POSTURE OF THE CASE\nThis action was filed by a class of SVPs confined at Atascadero State Hospital\n\n(ASH) on or about September 2, 1998. (Excerpts of Record (ER) 1)1The SVPsfiled\na First Amended Complaint on or about August 31, 1999, (ER 0094) anda Second\nAmended Complaint on or about August 14, 2002 (ER 0462). Defendants filed a\nMotion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint raising Eleventh\nAmendment and qualifed immunity defenses on or about February 21, 2003. (ER\nm\n0489) Judge Hatter denied the Motion on or about August 26, 2003. (ER 0804)\nDefendants filed a Notice of Appeal of September 23, 2003. (ER 0806)\nI.\nTIIE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT BARS PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS\nFOR DAMAGES AND PLAINTIFFS' CALIFORNIA\nCONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS\nThe Eleventh Amendment Immunizes a State and its Subdivisions from\nA.\nDamages Under Section 1983.\nThe State and its subdivisions cannot be sued for damages under section 1983\nbecause the Eleventh Amendment immunizes the state from suit for damages in\nfederal court and because a state official, acting in his official capacity, is not a\n\"person\" within the meaning of section 1983.\nSection 1983, provides in relevant part:\nAII subsequent references to the Excerpts of Record will be designated by\n\"ER\" followed by the relevant page number(s).\n\nEvery person who.., subjects.., any citizen oft_he United States or\nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any\nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution andlaws,\nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or\nother proper proceeding for redress.\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nNeither a statenor its officials acting in their official capacities are \"persons\"\nwithin the meaning of section 1983 and, thus, are not subject to suit for money\ndamages under section 1983. Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58,\n70-71 (1989); Gilbreath v. Cutter Biological, Inc., 931 F.2d 1320, 1327 (9tu Cir.\n1991).\nPlaintiffs' prayer seeking money damages against all Defendants in their\nofficial capacities, as set forth in the SAC (ER 0485-0486), is barred due to a lack of\njurisdiction.\nB. The Eleventh Amendment Bars Federal Courts from Determining\nHeretofore Unknown Rights in State Constitutions.\n1. The Eleventh Amendment bars state law claims against state\nofficials in federal court.\nIn the First, Second and Tenth claims Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated\nthe California Constitution and seek relief under section 1983. As the Supreme Court\nhas explained, these types of cases are disfavored:\na federal suit against state officials on the basis of state law contravenes\n\nthe Eleventh Amendment when -- as here -- the relief sought and\nordered has animpact directly on the Stateitself.\nAs noted, the implicit view of these [prior cases where pendant\njurisdiction waspermitted] seemsto have been that oncejurisdiction is\nestablished on the basis of a federal question, no further Eleventh\nAmendment inquiry is necessary with respect to other claims raised in\nthe case. This is an erroneous view and contrary to the principles\nestablished in our Eleventh Amendment decisions• \"The .Eleventh\nAmendment is an explicit limitation of the judicial power of the United\nStates.\" It deprives a federal court of power to decide certain claims\nagainst States that otherwise would be within the scope of Art. III's grant\nofjurisdiction.\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, ,465 U.S. 89, 118 (1984)(citations\nomitted).\nPenhurst addressees state law claims. The abstention rule is even more\nrigorous for state constitutional claims.\nThe abstention doctrine and Eleventh Amendment bars Plaintiffs' state law\nclaims when state courts have not had an opportunity to determine the issues. These\nclaims must be dismissed with prejudice as to all Defendants since they are both\nattacks upon the State itself and not cognizable under section 1983.\nPlaintiffs may suggest that they do not intend to pursue damage claims against\nDefendants in their official capacities. However, Plaintiffs refused to remove the\nclaim from the SAC or otherwise voluntarily dismiss the claim.\n///\n///\n\n2. Plaintiffs California Constitutional Claims are not Cognizable\nUnder Section 1983 and their Consideration Violates the Eleventh\nAmendment and the Abstention Doctrine.\nIn order to state a claim under section 1983, a plaintiff must allege that the\nJ\nconduct deprived them of a right or privilege protected by federal law or the United\ni\nStates Constitution and that the conduct was committed by a person acting under\ncolor of state law. Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981).\nSection 1983 is a vehicle to bring actions alleging violations of federal law and\nthe United States Constitution-not state constitutions or state laws. Gonzaga Univ.\nv. Doe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002). The federal courts must abstain from ad_essing\nPlaintiffs' claims, under the California Constitution pursuant to the Eleventh\nAmendment, because the state has not yet had an opportunity to determine these\nissues of state constitutional law. Reetzv. Bozanich, 397 U.S. 82, 87 (1970). Neither\nis pendant jurisdiction appropriate. Capital Cities Media, Inc. v. Chester, 797 F.2d\n1164, 1177 (3_aCir. 1986).\n28 U.S.C. section 1367(a) cannot bring California constitutional claims within\nthe parameters of section 1983. The wording of 28 U.S.C. section 1367(a)\nspecifically eliminates supplemental jurisdiction when a federal statute makes express\nprovisions for its jurisdiction, as does section 1983. Section 1983 expressly limits its\njurisdiction to federal constitutional claims and federal law claims.\n\nFurthermore, The claims presented by Plaintiffs under the California\nConstitution are both novel and complex. Therefore, federal courts must decline\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. section 1367(c) and the Eleventh Amendment.\nII.\nDEFENDANTS ARE ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IIVfiVINTY IN\nTHEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ON ALL ALLEGED\nCLAIMS\nQualified immunity \"protects government officials performing discretionary\nfunctions.., from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate\nclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\nwould have lmown.\" Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511,528, and n.9, (1985).\nIn raising a claim of qualified immunity in a suit against a state employee for\nan alleged violation of a constitutional right, the requisites of the defense must be\nconsidered in proper sequence. Where the defendant seeks qualified immunity, a\nruling on that issue should be made early in the proceedings so that the costs and\nexpenses of trial are avoided where the defense is dispositive. Qualified immunity\nis \"an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.\" Id., at 526,\n411, 2806. The privilege is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to\nliability; and like an absolute immunity, it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously\npermitted to go to trial.\" Ibid. As a result, Courts have stressed \"the importance of\n\nresolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stagein litigation.\" Hunter v.\nBryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991) (per curiam).\nA court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider, then,\nthis threshold question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the\ninjury, do the facts alleged show the defendant's conduct violated .a constitutional\nright? This must be the initial inquiry. Siegert v. GiIWy, 500 U.S. 226, 232 (1991).\nThis threshold inqniry must by necessity include the corollary that the constitutional\nright is applicable to the party asserting the injury.\nAfter consideration of the initial question an analysis of qualified immunity\ninvolves a two-step analysis:\" 1)Was the law governing the official's conduct clearly\nestablished? 2) Under that law, could a reasonable officer have believed his conduct\nwas lawful?\" Act Upt./PortIand v. Bagley, 988 F.2d 868, 871 (9tI' Cir. 1993).\n\"Qualified immunity protects 'aIfbut the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\nviolate the law.'\" Sloman v. Tadlock, 21 F.3d 1462, 1466-67 (9thCir. 1994) (quoting\nMalley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335 (1986)). 0lace the defense is raised the burden is on\nPlaintiffs to show that each defendant violated clearly established rights. Neely v.\nFeinstein, 50 F.3d 1502, 1506 (9thCir. 1995). Here, Plaintiffs have failed to meet this\nburden.\n///\n///\n10\n\nA. Qualified Immunity Protects Defendants Against Plaintiffs Third, Fourth,\nFifth and Ninth Alleged Claims Because Those Claims Are Based on\nCriminal Law Jurisprudence and Plaintiffs Are Civilly Committed.\nIn determining whether allegations constitute the violation of a constitutional\nright, a court might find it necessary to set forth principles which will become the\nbasis for a holding that a right is or is not clearly established. This is the process for\nthe law's elaboration from case to case, and it is one reason for a court's insisting\nupon Wxning to the existence of a constitutional right applicable to the plaintiff as the\nfirst inquiry.\nIf no constitutional right applicable to the party asserting the claim would have\nbeen violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further\ninquiries concerning qualified immunity. Plaintiffs' Third, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth\nclaims fail at this step. No constitutional right applicable to Plaintiffs is violated were\nthe allegations accepted as true.\n1. A civil statute cannot be divested of its civi_ nature by its\napplication.\nIn a case involving Washington's SVP statute the Supreme Court held that\n\"It]he civil nature of a confinement scheme cannot be altered based merely on\nvagaries in the implementation of the authorizing statute.\" Seling v. Young, 531 U.S.\n250 (2001).\n11\n\nIn Seling, plaintiff did not attack the statute as unconstitutional according to its\nterms, but alleged the conditions of confinement in its application were\nunconstitutional./-d, at 264. However, the Court reasoned that the claims were an \"as\napplied\" attempt to remove an otherwise valid civil statute from an analysis based on\nt\nits civil nature and place it into a criminal law analysis. It is that deviation from the\nappropriate analytical framework that was held to be unacceptable.\nThis Court is faced with the same theoretical argument as the Seling Court.\nPlaintiffs allege claims based on an \"as applied\" theory seeldng money damages, as\nwell as injunctive and declaratory relief. 2 Plaintiffs' alleged Eighth, and Sixth\nAmendment, and Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto claims fail to state a\nconstitutional violation because they are inapplicable to the civilly committed.\nAccordingly, they fail to apply to Plaintiffs and Defendants are entitled to qualified\nimmtmity.\nB. Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy Claims.\nPlaintiffs allege that conditions at ASH violate both the Ex Post Facto and\nDouble Jeopardy Clauses of the Constitution. (ER 0481-0482) Inasmuch as they are\nasserting a facial challenge to the statute on both grounds, the argument is precluded\nby Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997), where the Supreme Court rejected\n2 Ex post facto and double jeopardy challenges appear to be directed toward\nrelease although such relief is unavailable through the section 1983 vehicle.\n12\n\nthese exact claims with respect to a statute that is substantively identical to\nCalifornia's in all significant respects:3\nHendricks argues that, as applied to him, the Act violates double\njeopardy principles because his confinement under the Act, imposed\nafter a conviction and a term of incarceration, amounted to both a\nsecond prosecution and asecond punishment for the sameoffense. We\ndisagree.\nBecause we havedetermined that theKansas Act is civil in nature,\ninitiation of its commitment proceedings does not constitute a second\nprosecution. Moreover, ascommitment under the Act isnot tantamount\nto \"punishment,\" Hendricks' involuntary detention doesnot violate the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause, even though that confinement may follow a\nprison term. Indeed, inBaxstrom v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, t5 L. Ed. 2d\n620, 86 S. Ct. 760 (1966), we expressly recognized that civil\ncommitment could follow the expiration of a prison term without\noffending double jeopardy principles. We reasoned that \"there is no\nconceivable basis for distinguishing the commitment of a person who is\nnearing the end ofapenal term from all other civil commitments.\" Ibid,\nat 111-112. If an individual otherwise meets the requirements for\ninvoluntary civil commitment, the State is under no obligation to release\nthat individual simply because the detention would follow a period of\nincarceration.\nHendricks at 369-370(citations partially omitted).\nIn Seling the Court reinforced its prior holding inHudson v. U.S., 522 U.S. 93\n(1997). 531 U.S. at 262. Hudson disavowed the Court's decision in United States\nv. Halper, 490 U.S. 435 (1989) which had allowed consideration of\"the sanction as\napplied\" for double jeopardy purposes. Calling the \"as applied\" approach \"an ill\n3 In his dissent in Hendricks Justice Breyer noted that California's statute\ndid not suffer the same flaws which he argued made Kansas' statute dubious.\nHendricks at 388-389; dis. opn. ofBreyer, J.\n13\n\nconsidered and unworkable\" deviation, the Court set the stage for its later decision\nin Seling.\nThe Supreme Court has clearly repudiated the \"as applied\" approach to move\ncivil actions into a criminal law analyticat framework. 4 In Seling the Court held that\n\"It]he civil nature of a confinement scheme cannot be altered based merely on\nvagaries in the implementation of the authorizing statute.\" SeIing 531 U.S. at 735.\nThe states are allowed wide latitude in determining how to apply their statutory\nschemes. Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 372. Thus, Plaintiffs fail to state a constitutional\nviolation applicable to Plaintiffs under the Hendricks guidelines. Defendants are\nentitled to qualified immunity on those alleged claims.\nC. Eighth Amendment Claims.\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court specified that the Eighth Amendment\nprecludes \"cruel and unusual punishment\" for \"sentenced inmates\" for whom there\nhas previously been a \"formal adjudication of guilt .... Where the State seeks to\nimpose punishment without such an adjudication, the pertinent constitutional\nguarantee is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Bell v. Wolfish,\n441 U.S. 520, 535 n. 16 (1979).\nThe SV-P class falls into this categorization- no formal adjudication of guilt has\n4 At the time the First Amended Complaint (ER 0094) was filed, the\nSupreme Court had yet to address the propriety of\"as applied\"challenges.\n14\n\noccurred vis-a-vis the SVP. SVPs are not sentenced inmates as required for\napplication of Eighth Amendment analysis. Thus, the Eighth Amendment. in\ninapplicable.\nPlaintiffs herein are aldn to the civilly committed Plaintiffs in Youngberg v.\nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982). In Youngberg the Supreme Court'cited the Third\nm\nCircuit's determination that the Due Process Clause, not the Eighth Amendment, was\nthe appropriate constitutional vehicIe for determining the rights of individuals subject\nto civil commitment. Id. at 312.\nThus, as a matter of law, conditions of confinement claims raised by detainees\nwho are not adjudicated criminals at the time of their complaint are analyzed under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment substantive Due Process Clause, rather than the Eighth\nAmendment. Bell, 441 U. S at 535 n. 16; Frost v. Agnos, 152 F.3 d 1124, 1128 (9t_Cir.\n1998). By extension from the SAC's internal incorporations, this analytical approach\nalso applies to Plaintiffs' First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment,\nSixth Amendment, ex post facto and double jeopardy claims.\n1. Defendants are Not Prison Officials.\nIn addition to applicability only in the criminal law context, the Eighth\nAmendment imposes a duty upon prison officials to protect prisoners and to provide\nhumane conditions of confinement. Farmer v. Brennen, 511 U.S.825 (I994).\nDefendants are not prison officials. (ER 0466.) The Eighth Amendment imposes no\n15\n\nduty upon Defendants, and they cannot violate the Amendment. Therefore, they are\nentitled to qualified immunity.\nD. Plaintiffs' Sixth Amendment Allegations Fail:\nBecause Seling precludes a finding that the SVPA is punitive as applied,\nPlaintiffs' Sixth Amendment claim fails to allege a constitutional violation vis-a-vis\nDefendants. The Sixth Amendment goes to criminal proceedings and is inapplicable\nto the civilly committed.\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to counsel in all criminal\nprosecutions. It says nothing whatsoever about counsel rights in civil proceedings.\nIn United States v. Sahhar, the Court held that because civil commitment serves a\n\"regulatory,\" as opposed to a \"punitive,\" purpose, the Sixth Amendment's jury trial\nprovision did not apply. United States v. Sahhar, 917 F.2d 1197, 1206 (9thCir. 1990)\nIt would be extraordinary, and inconsistent with the spirit of Sahhar, to suggest that\nthe portion of the Sixth Amendment dealing with the right to counsel applies to civil\ncommitments while the jury trial requirement does not.\nPlaintiffs allege that their Sixth Amendment right to access the courts has been\nviolated. (ER 0484-0485) The right of civilly committed individuals to access the\ncourts is found in the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. Cornett v.\nDonovan, 51 F.3d 894, 897 (9th Cir. 1995). Because these are civil committees,\nPlaintiffs have failed to allege a constitutional violation under the Sixth Amendment\n16\n\nandDefendants areentitIed toqualified immunity becauseno constitutionM violation\nhasbeen alleged.\nPlaintiffs' burden has not been met for the Third, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth\nalleged claims. No constitutional right applicable to Plaintiffs hasbeen violated and\nthere is no necessity for further inquiry concerning qualified immunity as to those\nclaims. No constitutional violation hasoccurredbecause the alleged claims arebased\non the application of criminal law jurisprudence to the civilly committed. A state\nemployee cannot be held individually liable for alleged violations of constitutional\nrights not applicable to those bringing suit.\nIII.\nQUALIFIED IMMUNITY PROTECTS STATE OFFICIALS\nFROM CLAIMS BASED ON RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR\nThe doctrine of respondeat superior is inapplicable in actions based upon\nallegations of civil rights violations. Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312 (1981).\nUnless they play an affirmative part in the alleged deprivation of constitutional rights,\nsupervisory officials cannot be held liable under section 1983. Rizzo v. Goode, 423\nU.S. 362, 377 (1976); Johnson v. D_fy, 588 F.2d 740, 743-744 (9th Cir. 1978).\nThe SVPs fail to allege which defendants violated which constitutional rights.\nQualified immunity is appropriate because there is no allegation that a clearly\nestablished right was violated by a specific Defendant. Plaintiffs are attempting to\n17\n\nplead respondeat superior theories and avoida qualified immunity defense.\nA supervisor malting policy decisions that cause the alleged constitutional\nviolations may be liable. Ouzts v. Cummins, 825 F.2d 1276, 1277 (8th Cir. 1987).\nHowever, a plaintiff must establish an essential link between the policy and the\ninjury. See Milton v. Nelson, 527 F.2d 1158, 1159 (gth Cir. 1975). The claimed\nconstitutional violation must then be specifically alleged. Vayle v. Stapley, 607 F.2d w\n858, 862 (9th Cir. 1979); Padway v. Palches, 655 F.2d 965, 968 (9 th Cir. 1982).\nPlaintiffs must set forth facts proximately connecting the individual Defendants to the\nloss Plaintiffs claim to have suffered. Plainer v. Sanderson, 9 F.3d 1433, 1438 (9 tu\nCir. 1993);Leerv.Mztrphy, 844F.2d 628,633 (9_ Cir. 1988); Taylorv. List, 880 F.2d\n1040, 1045 (9tuCir. 1989).\nPlaintiffs herein fail to plead any of the nexus requirements with particularity\n\\\nor specificity. No linkage between alleged policy and alleged injury is established\nand no linkage between a Defendant and either is established. Neither is proximate\ncausation alleged. If Plaintiffs allege that conditions at ASH are worse than those in\nprison in order to insert criminal law jurisprudence into a civil law framework, they\nneed to allege with specificity those claims as to the individual Defendants. Plaintiffs\nhave not done so. defendants are therefore entitled to qualified immunity-.\n///\n///\n18\n\n1. To Defeat Qualified Immunity More than General Allegations are\nRequired.\nThe Supreme Court recognizes that maintenance of an action against\ngovernment officials involves systemic social costs requiring pleadings containing\nmore than a generalized approach. To avoid conversion of the clearly established law\nrule of qualified immunity into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by w\nalleging violation of extremely abstract rights, court's require that the constitutional\nviolation must be clearly established in a more particularized, and hence more\nrelevant sense. A generalized approach\n• . . would destroy \"the balance that our cases strike between the\ninterests in vindication of citizens' constitutional rights and in public\nofficials' effective performance of their duties,\" by malting it impossible\nfor officials \"reasonably [to] anticipate when their conduct may give rise\nto liability for damages.\" It should not be surprising, therefore, that our\ncases establish that \"the right the official is alleged to have violated must\nhave been \"clearly established\" in a more particularized, and hence more\nrelevant, sense: The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that\na reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates\nthat right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by\nqualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously\nbeen held unlawfu!,... ;but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing\nlaw the unlawfulness must be apparent.\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635,640 (1987)(citations omitted).\nPlaintiffs' fail to allege that the rights Defendants allegedly violated are\n\"clearly established\" in a particularized, relevant sense. Thus, qualified immunity\nshields Defendants from liability in their individual capacities. For example, the SAC\n19\n\naddsMelvin Hunter asaDefendant in his individual capacity. (ER 0466) However,\nno facts indicate how he is specifically responsible, and when that responsibility\narose.\nThe SAC makes general conclusory allegations against the Defendants as a\ngroup. No attempt is made to specify with particularity which policy or practice was\nspecifically tied to any Defendant. The only policy Plaintiffs reference is\nAdministrative Directive (AD) 602 (ER 0473-0475), which Plaintiffs do not allege\nwas violated.\nPlaintiffs' failure to identify specific wrongdoing by particular Defendants is\nall the more telling because this case has been in litigation for four years, and\nDefendants have produced over 270,000 pages of documents, responded to 375\ninterrogatories and 240 Requests for Admissions, and have participated in 34\ndepositions.S\n\"Individual capacity\" liability hinges on pleading and proving raw abuse of\npower constituting arbitrary action. Reed v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, 372 F.\nSupp. 686, 692 (E.D. Pa. 1974). The SAC fails to meet this standard. (ER 0466,\n0476-0485) Because the pleading does not properly allege Defendants violated a\n5 Defendants have cooperated throughout the discovery process as\nevidenced by-the need for the District court's intervention on only two occasions.\nThose occasions both involved Plaintiffs' requests to extend merit-based and\nexpert discovery for the third time.\n20\n\nspecific clearly established constitutional right applicable to Plaintiffs, Defendants\nare entitled to qualified immunity.\nAs discussed above, ifa violation could bemade out onafavorable view of the\nparties' submissions, the next sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly\nestablished. This inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the\ncase,not asabroad general proposition; and it too serves to advance understanding\nof the law and to allow state officials to avoid the burden of trial if qualified\nimmunity is applicable. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).\nIn sum, the SAC fails to allege that Defendants violated a clearly established\nconstitutional right applicable to SVPs of which a reasonable official would have\nbeen aware. According, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs'\nalleged claims.\nIV.\nREASONABLE OFFICIALS iN DEFENDANTS' POSITIONS\nWOULD BELIEVE THEIR ALLEGED ACTIONS WERE\nCONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE\nAo Plaintiffs Fail to Establish Allegations Overcoming the Second Prong of\nthe Qualified Immunity Test-That an Official Knew His Acts Violated the\nLaw.\nDefendants are entitled to qualified immunity under the second part of the\n21\n\nqualified immunity analysis because a reasonable official in Defendants' position\nreasonably could have believed that the alleged conduct was lawful. As the Court\nnoted in Crawford-el v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 590 (1998):\nFocusing on \"the objective legal reasonableness of an official's acts,\",\nr\navoids the tmfairness of imposing liability on a defendant who \"could\nnot reasonablybe expected to anticipate subsequent legal developments,\nnor . . . fairly be said to 'know' that the law forbade conduct not\npreviously identified as unlawful,\" That unfairness may be present even\nwhen the official conduct is motivated, in part, by hostility to the\nplaintiff.\nDefendants cannot be held liable for constitutional issues which are not\napplicable to the civilly committed. Under Crawford-el they are entitled to qualified\nimmunity as a matter of law.\nA review of the cases decided in the short period since 1996 confirms the\nunsettled nattuce of the constitutional requirements surrounding SVPs. A partial list\nof these cases include the following: Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346 (1997)(SVP\nstatute civil not punitive); Selingv. Young, 531 U.S. 250 (2001)(\"as applied\" criminal\nlaw claims disallowed for civil statute; criminal law constitutional claims not\napplicable to SVPs, treatment requirements punitive application of statute); McKune\nv. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, (2002)(no right to privileges if not participating in treatment);\nKulas v. Valdez, 159 F.3d 453 (9th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1187\n(2000)(SVP treatment); Thielman v. Leean, 282 F.3d 478 (7tl_Cir. 2002)(due process\nand equal protection, conditions of confinement); In reMatthews, 345 S.C. 638, 550\n22\n\nS.E.2d 311 (2001)(statute tracks Kansas' statute andtherefore no DoubIe Jeopardy -\nconditions of confinement not punitive); Page v. Torrey, 201 F.3d 1136 (9thCir.\n2000)(person detained as SVP not subject to PLRA); Munoz v. Kolender, 208 F.\nSupp. 2d 1125 (S.D.CA 2002)(SVP confinement in jail while awaiting hearing not\na constitutional violation): Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407 (2002)(serious difficulty\nm\ncontrolling behavior required for SVP commitment); Woodard v. Mayberg, 242 F.\nm\nSupp. 2d 695 (N.D.CA 2003)(California's SVP commitment scheme tracks Kansas\nand Washington's SVP commitment schemes and is civiI, not punitive in nature - \"as\napplied\" challenge to statute inappropriate under Seling); Hubbart v. Superior Court,\n19 Cal.4th 1138 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492] (1999)(SVPA tracks Kansas' statute as proper\ncivil commitment scheme and does not violate es post facto, double jeopardy, due\nprocess, equal protection); People v. tturtado, 124 Cal.Rptr.2d 186 [28 Cal.4th 1179]\n(2002)(SVPA not punitive); (People v. Superior Court (Ghilotti), 27 Cal.4th 888 [119\nCal.Rptr.2d 1] (2002)(SVPA narrowly tailored to achieve compelling purpose of\nconfining and treating extremely dangerous persons unable to control mental\ndisorders); In re Calhoun, 112 Cal.App.4th 1262 [6 Cal Rptr.3d 34] (2003)(SVPs are\ncommitted for and may not refuse treatment).\nThe SAC does not andcannot satisfy the Crawford-el requirements. Its\nconclusory allegations fall far short of establishing that reasonable officials in the\nDefendants' position would have lmown that their conduct was unlawful under the\n23\n\ncurrent state of the law in this area. Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\nB. Defendants' Claim of Qualified Immunity Is Consistent with the ASH\nPolicy Cited by Plaintiffs in the SAC.\nPlaintiffs quote ASH AD No. 602 in the SAC. (ER 0474, 04?'5) Plaintiffs do\nnot dispute AD 602 and do not allege that it is not applied as policy at ASH. 6\nAssuming ar_endo that the constitutional rights alleged by Plaintiffs to have\nbeen violated are applicable, it is clear from Plaintiffs' references to AD 602 in the\nSAC that Defendants cannot have knowinglyviolated Plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\nDefendants cannot have l_nowingly violated Plaintiffs' constitutional rights because\nAD 602 is the policy Plaintiffs' posit Defendants instituted. Defendants are therefore\nentitled to qualified immunity in their individual capacities.\nPlaintiffs note that AD 602 lists the following rights of patients involuntarily\ndetained at ASH:\nthe right to treatment services that are provided in ways least restrictive\nto personal liberty; the right to dignity, privacy, and humane care; the\nright to be free from harm including excessive restraints, isolation,\nmedication, abuse or neglect; the right to be free of medication as a form\nof punishment or for staff convenience; the right to prompt medical care;\nthe right to religious freedom and practice; the right to participate in\nIf Plaintiffs are alleging that practice does not follow policy then\nDefendants are not be liable because there is no respondeat superior or vicarious\nliability under section 1983. Redman v. County of San Diego, 942 F.2d 1435,\n1446 (9thCir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1074 (1992).\n24\n\nappropriate programs of publically supported education; the right to\nsocial interaction and physical exercise; and the right to be free from\nhazardous procedures.\n(ER 0474)\nPlaintiffs setforth ASH's governing policy, thereby establishing this policy as\npart of the factual allegations in the SAC which must be accepted as true. Western\nMining Counsel v. Watt, 643 F.2d 618, 624 (9th Cir. 1981).\nI. Plaintiffs' Allegations in the First, Second, Third (and By Extension\nthe Fourth), Fifth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Alleged Claims as to\nthe Policy at ASI-I Are Contrary to the Policy described in the SAC.\nPlaintiffs allege in the Tenth Alleged Claim that ASH policies deny SVPs\nprivacy. (ER 0485) But AD 602 specifically states that as a matter of policy patients\nat ASH have the right to privacy. (ER 0473)\nPlaintiffs allege in the Sixth and Seventh alleged claims that ASH policy\npermits an SVPA's loss of privileges without due process. (ER 0483) AD 602 states\nthat a patient's rights may be denied for \"good cause\" and upon recommendation of\nthe patient's \"Interdisciplinary Team\" and psychiatrist (ER 0474) and after review by\nthe \"Interdisciplinary Team\" (ER 0475)\nPlaintiffs cannot describe the policy establishing that patients are to be\nprovided with due process under AD 602, and on the other hand allege that ASH\npolicies fail to provide due process.\n25\n\nIn short, Defendants' qualified immunity defense is supported by AD 602.\nDefendants reasonably believe AD 602's policies comply with constitutional\nrequirements. Indeed, Plaintiffs do not dispute the constitutional integrity of AD\n602's policies. Defendants are entitled to qualified.\nC. Defendants Sued in their Individual Capacities Are Entitled to Qualified\nImmunity_ on Plaintiffs' First Alleged Claim.\nDefendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' First Alleged\nClaim. The allegations are not such that areasonable official in Defendants' position\nwould have known that their actions, even if all allegations are accepted as true,\nviolated constitutional standards for treatment of SVPs in a maximum security mental\nhospital.\nSVPs do not have a right to refuse mandated treatment. In re Calhoun, 112\nCal.App.4th 1262 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 34] (2003). Certainly SVPs are not entitled to\nprivileges if they choose not to participate in treatment while confined. See McKune\nv. LiIe, 536 U.S. 24 (2002). Defendants cannot have violated a clearly established\nconstitutional bar of which a reasonable official would have known.\nThe SAC fails to allege elements to defeat Defendants' claim of quaiified\nirm_aunity in the context of the SVP's current confined situation. As a matter of law\n\"not every restriction is sufficient to chill the exercise of First Amendment rights, nor\nis every restriction actionable, even if retaliatory.\" DiMeglio v. Haines, 45 F.3d 790,\n26\n\n806 (4th Cir. 1995).\nPlaintiffs claim that they are \"punished ''7 for voicing opinions and refusing\ntreatment. (ER 0480) No fact asto what constitutes \"punishment\" is alleged. The\nallegation is conclusory inthat Plaintiffs conclude that anynegative consequences for\nfailure to adhere to the rules in a secure mental institution rises.'to the level of\nunconstitutional punishment.\n1. Plaintiffs' allegations in the First Alleged Claim fail to allege\nviolations of a clearly established constitutional right.\nA First Amendment 1983 retaliation claim must plead three elemeffts. First,\nthe Plaintiffs must demonstrate that tile speech was protected. Huang v. Board of\nGovernors, 902 F.2d 1134, 1140 (4th Cir. 1990). Second, the Plaintiffs must\ndemonstrate that the alleged retaliatory action adversely affected tile plaintiffs\nconstitutionally protected speech. ACL U v. Wicomico Cozmty, Md., 999 F.2d 780,\n785 (4th Cir. 1993)(stating that \"a showing of adversity is essential to any retaliation\nclaim\"). Third, the Plaintiffs must demonstrate that a causal relationship exists\nbetween the speech and the Defendants' retaliatory action. Huang, 902 F.2d at 1140.\nPlaintiffs have not alleged facts to demonstrate these elements. Rather,\nPlaintiffs have set forth conclusory allegations such as SAC paragraph 70, which\n7 Throughout the SAC the term \"punishment\" in various forms is used with\nno indication of what \"punishment\" means in this context.\n27\n\nstates: \"Defendants policies, practices and customs permit and encourage the\npunishment of members of the SVP Class for the mere expression of their beliefs,\nincluding, but not limited to, punishment for refusing treatment.\" (ER 0480)\nNothing in this allegation implies that the speech was protected and not all\nspeech is protected. Failing to participate in treatment is not 'constitutionally\nprotected speech. Furthermore, theallegation concludes in andof itself thatPlaintiffs\nw\nwere \"punished\" solely for speech and Defendants caused the punishment.\nDefendants are entitled to qualified immunity under the allegations set forth in the\nSAC because no proximate causation is alleged. Furthermore, no allegation of\nviolation of a clearly established right is present. Lastly, a reasonable official in\nDefendants' position would believe that limitations on SVPs confined in a maximum\nsecurity mental institution are permissible.\nThe qualified immunity defense is also supported by the language of the\ncommitting statute which states that the SVPs are committed for treatment. Welf. &\nInst. Code section 6602. It is reasonable for the officials to believe that they must\ntreat the SVPs and that the SVPs are not permitted to refuse treatment. Calhoun, 112\nCal.App.4th at 1291.\nD. Defendants Are Entitled to Qualified Immuni_ on Plaintiffs' Second\nAlleged Claim.\nPlaintiffs' Second Claim alleges violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth\n28\n\nAmendments and violations of Article 1,Section 13of the California Constitution. 8\nThe claim also appears to implicate the Eighth Amendment in its conclusory\nallegation regarding the unreasonable use of force. (ER 0481).\nA mental patient's rights are sometimes analogous to those of prisoners.\nBounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 825 (1977). But, since confined mental institution\npatients are not held for punishment purposes they are similar to pretrial detainees in\nI\nsome ways as well. In Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 534, the Court held that pretrial\ndetainees were not held for punishment, but that restrictions on liberty reasonably\nrelated to legitimate government objectives were permissible. Defendants are\nreasonable in believing that the limitations and rights discussed in Bell and Bounds\nare applicable to SVPs. _\n\"The constitutional rights that prisoners possess are more limited in scope than\nthe constitutional rights held by individuals in society at large.\" Shaw,z Murphy, 532\nU.S. 223, 229 (2001). By analogy the constitutional rights of confined mental\nClaims arising under the California Constitution are addressed above.\n9 Although a person involuntarily confined to a secure mental institution is\nnot confined for the purpose of punishment that does not mean they are free to do\nwhatever they please while so confined. A secure hospital must maintain control\nof its population for the safety and security of the institution's patients as well as\nits staff. To that end, although a patient is not committed for punishment if a.\npatient refuses to follow the rules of the institution negative consequences will\nfollow. No case found by Defendants has suggested that reasonable restrictions on\nSVPs amount to a constitutional violation.\n29\n\npatients are also more limited than those held by individuals in society atlarge. The\nnecessity to maintain the safety andsecurity of an institution and operate a treatment\nprogram justifies some limits on patients' rights.\na. Searches.\nP\nThe Ninth Circuit has held, \"the reasonableness of a particular search is\nm\ndetermined by reference to the prison context.\" Michenfelder v. Summer, 860 F.2d\n328, 332 (9th Cir. 1988). In reaching the conclusion that strip searches were\npermissible in the context presented the court applied the Bell v. Wo_sh balancing\ntest which states:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable\nof precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires\na balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\npersonai rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope\nof the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\n441 U.S. at 559.\nPlaintiffs' allegations that they are subjected to inspections of their persons and\ntheir personal belongings fails to state a claim for a person committed to a secure\nmental institution. The searches at ASH as alleged in the SAC are reasonable in light\nof Plaintiffs' circumstances and the compelling need to maintain ASH's safety and\nsecurity.\nPlaintiffs have not alleged facts showing that Defendants violated clearly\nestablished law applicable to those confined in a mental institution. Furthermore, the\n3O\n\nallegations contained in the SAC are not such that a reasonable official in\nDefendants' position would believe they had violated constitutional prohibitions by\nthose acts. Thus, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity as to the Second\nAlleged Claim.\nE. Defendants Are Entitled to Qualified Immunity on the l_ifth and First\nw\nAmendment Claims Because Admission of Past Acts as Part of a\nRehabilitation and Treatment Process Is Constitutionally Permissible.\nPlaintiffs allege that in order to move up in Phase Treatment Levels at ASH\nthey must sign a document admitting to, and taldng responsibility for, past acts for\nwhich theyhave been convicted. (ER 0475) Thus Plaintiffs admit that this admission\nis part of the treatment process at ASH. Defendants assume this alIegation is the\ngravamen of Plaintiffs' First Amendment claim in that only this allegation plausibly\nsounds in the First Amendment. t° Plaintiffs appear to claim that the admission as a\nrequirement of advancing through phases violates their Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.\nIn McKune v. Lile the Supreme Court reasoned, on the basis of both\nrehabilitation and treatment requirements, that admission as part of treatment does not\namount to forced self-incrimination. 536 U.S. 24 (2002) The Court addressed itself\n_0 Defendants should not be required to guess which facts allegedly support\nwhich allegation. ,\n31\n\nbeyond the prisoner context by stating that:11\nPrison context or not, respondent's choice is marked less by compulsion\nthan by choices the Court has held give no rise to a self-incrimination\nclaim. The \"criminal process, like the rest of the legal system, is replete\nwith situations requiring the maldng of difficult judgments as to which\ncourse to follow. Although a defendant may have a right, even of\nconstitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course he chqoses, the\nConstitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to\nchoose.\" McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 213 (1971) (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted). It is well settled that the\ngovernment need not make the exercise of the Fifth Amendment\nprivilege cost free.\nId. at 9. (emphasis added; some citations omitted).\nThe Court further stressed that taldng responsibility for actions is an important\ncomponent in a treatment program, ld., at 5-6.\nThe SAC alleges that in the treatment program at ASH the SV-P is required to\nsign a statement admitting to his past misdeeds. (ER 0475) The Court in McKune\nrecognized that such an admission does not give rise to a Fifth Amendment claim.\nNothing distinguishes Plaintiffs alleged claim from McKune.\nSVPs are committed to ASH for treatment and participating patients are\ntl In referring to rehabilitation the Court cited to several treatment treatises\nand manuals including U.S. Dept. of Justice, Nat. Institute of Corrections,A\nPractitioner's Guide to Treating the Incarcerated Male Sex Offender xiii (1988);\nH. Barbaree, Denial and Minimization Amon_ Sex Offenders: Assessment and\nTreatment Outcome., 3 Forum on Corrections Research, No. 4, p. 30 (1991); B.\nMaletzl_ & K. McGovern, Treating the Sexual Offender. 253--255 (199!).\nThese cites indicate that the court's reasoning is applicable to sex offender\ntreatment generally.\n32\n\nrewarded. Non participating patients are not rewarded. Thus, the lower level of\nprivileges accorded those not participating in treatment is a direct result of the\npatient's choice. To paraphrase McKune, Plaintiffs' choice to admit to past acts and\nthus participate in treatment is a choice marked less by compulsion than by choices\nthe Court has held do not amount to constituti0nal violations. Defendants are entitled\nto qualified immunity because no clearly established constitutional right has been\nm\nviolated and a reasonable official in Defendants' position would believe that the\nalleged conduct was IawfuI.\nF. Plaintiffs Sixth Claim for Violations of Procedural Due Process Fails.\nDefendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' Sixth, Seventh and\nEighth alleged claims. Plaintiffs' fail to allege a constitutional violation in these due\nprocess and equal protection claims. Bounds delineates the rights of confined persons\nto access the courts. 430 U.S. at 821 (1977). Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343 (1996)\nrefined the Bounds holding to require evidence of some actual injury resulting from\nthe conditions in question, i.e. evidence that the person had in fact been hindered in\nbringing anon-frivolous legal claim. Lewis, 518 U.S. at 353, n.3. Plaintiffs fail to\nallege any actual denial of access or claim of actual injury. Therefore, Defendants are\nentitled to qualified immunity because no constitutional violation has been alleged.\nG. Procedural Due Process.\nAD 602 refers to the possibility of a patients' rights being denied for \"good\n33\n\ncause\" upon recommendation of the patient's Interdisciplinary Review Team and\npsychiatrist. (ER 0474) This evidences a review process requiring good cause for\na denial of privileges. This comports with constitutional requirements of procedural\ndue process.\nPlaintiffs have failed to allege that SVPs have a protected right triggering\nprocedural due process scrutiny for a denial of institutional privileges. g\nTo plead a procedural due process violation a plaintiff must allege that a life,\nliberty or property interest exists and has been interfered with by the state. Board of\nRegents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). Only after a protected\ninterest is established will a court consider the second prong; whether the procedures\nattendant upon the deprivation of an existing interest were constitutionally\ninsufficient. Kent_tckyDept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989).\nPlaintiffs have not pied facts to establish that they have either a liberty or a\nproperty interest in the alleged Access Level reductions, restrictions on movement,\ntreatment parameters, or confiscation of their \"belongings.\" Neither have Plaintiffs\nalleged facts showing that the procedural due process admitted ill the SAC is\ninsufficient. (ER 0474-0475)\nDefendants are entitled to qualified immunity because no constitutional right\nhas been violated and, even if it were reasonable officials in Defendants' positions\nwould believe that the alleged conduct was lawful.\n34\n\n1. Movement Within ASH.\nAs the Court in Y'oungberg, 457 U.S. at 3i9-320 noted, the liberty interests of\npatients in a state mental institution are not absolute and some restraints on residents\nmay be necessary to protect them.\nSVPs are, by statutory definition, dangerous felons with a history of violence\nand a current mental disorder. (ER 0464-0465; Welf. & Inst. Code Section 6600-\n6604.) Limitations on such individuals' rights while confined are constitutionally\nacceptable.\nSandin v. Connor, 515 U.S. 472 (1995), presented a procedural due process\nanalysis concerning a prisoner's claim that he had been placed in a segregated cell\nwithout due process. The Court held that assignment to segregated housing was not\nsuch an \"atypical\" variant on normal prison life as to create a protected liberty\ninterest. As in Sandin, restrictions placed on SVP movement (ER 0474) are not such\nan atypical variant on normaI institutional life as to create a liberty interest.\nPlaintiffs do not have a liberty interest in complete freedom of movement at\nASH. _Atthe very least the law is not so clearly established as to defeat a claim of\nqualified immunity. Furthermore, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity\nbecause reasonable officials in Defendants' positions would believe that the alleged\nconduct was lawful.\n///\n35\n\n2. Treatment Requirements.\nPlaintiffs appearto allege a denial of dueprocess because they arerequire dto\nparticipate in treatment. (ER 0475) Plaintiffs are confined for treatment. (ER 0465;\nW,elf. & Inst. Section 6606.) Plaintiffs must make choices whether they will\nparticipate in treatment andberewarded for thatparticipation or whether they willnot\nparticipate andbedenied those rewards. This choice is not aconstitutionalviolatiun.\nMcK_tne, 536 U.S. at 9.\nDefendants are entitIed to qualified immunity because no constitutional\nviolation has occurred. Furthermore, reasonable officials ih Defendants' positions\nwould believe that the alleged conduct was permissible. Under McKune Defendants\nare reasonable in believing that PIaintiffs camlot refuse treatment and expect tile same\nprivileges as those patients who participate in treatment.\n3. Plaintiffs' \"Belongings\".\nPlaintiffs allege that procedural due process attaches before their\"belongings\"\nmay be confiscated. Even though the SAC includes no facts regarding the nature of\nthe \"belongings,\" it is clear that Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. First,\nit is clear that an SV-P does not have a protected property interest in contraband.\nKimb[e v. Department of Corrections, 411 F.2d 90 (9th Cir. 1969); Anderson v.\nFeidler; 798 F.Supp. 544 (E.D. Wisc. 1992). Second, if Plaintiffs are alleging seizure\nof non-contraband personal property no claim is stated because the California Tort\n36\n\nClaims Act provides an adequatepost-deprivation remedy. Zinermon v. Burch, 494\nU.S. 113, 129-132 (1990); Barnett v. Centoni, 31 F.3d 813,816-17 (9_ Cir. 1994).\nPlaintiffs do not allege that they have filed clams under the CTCA.\nThus, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because no constitutional\nright has been violated. Furthermore, even were a constitutional right violated\nreasonable officials in Defendants' positions would believe that the alleged conduct\nwas lawful in the context of the allegations.\nILl. ,Defendants Are Entitled to Qualified Immunity on Plaintiffs' Seventh\nClaim of Violations of Substantive Due Process.\nIll determining whether constitutional rights have been violated a patients'\nliberty interests, as discussed in Youngberg, must be balanced against relevant state\ninterests. 457 U.S. at 319-324. The standard for malting the determination is whether\nprofessional judgment has been exercised, fd. at 322.\nA professional decision is deemed \"presumptively valid.\" Liability may only\nbe imposed when the decisionby the professional is such a substantial departure from\naccepted professional practice or standards as to demonstrate that the decision was\nnot based on an exercise of professional judgment. Id. at 323.\nPlaintiffs do not allege that any decision to withhold privileges or reduce a\nPatient's Access level in not based on an exercise of professional judgment. Clearly,\nisolated instances do not give rise to a constitutional violation claiming policy based\n37\n\ndeprivations. Doe v. Gaughen, 808 F.2d 871,880 (I stCir. 1986.)\nPlaintiffs admit that any reduction in privileges is reviewed by the patient's\nInterdisciplinary Review Team and psychiatrist. (ER 0474) No facts suggesting that\nthese decisions are a substantial departure fi:om accepted professional practice or\nstandards are alleged. Thus, Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because\nno constitational right has been violated and reasonable officials in Defendants'\npositions would believe that the Mleged conduct was lawful\nI. Plaintiffs Equal Protection Claim Fails to Allege Violation of a\nConstitutional Right Because the Constitution Permits Different\nCommitment Types to Be Treated Differently.\nPlaintiffs allege an equal protection claimbased on the allegation that the SVPs\nare treated differently than other civil commitments. (ER 0484) Assuming the\nallegation's truth it should be dismissed based on qualified immunity because the\nconstitution permits different commitment types to be treated differently. Thus, no\nconstitutional violation has been alleged.\nNo court has held that SVPs belong to a \"suspect\" classification creating a\nstrict scrutiny analysis for equal protection purposes. Therefore, any difference in\ntreatment will be upheld if it bears a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state\nptmpose. Phyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216, (1982).\nThe SVPA requires individualized treatment for SVPs. Welf. & Inst. Code\n38\n\nsection 6606. Common sense tells us that treatment for different mental conditions\nwill be different. Thus, it follows that a legitimate state interest is being advancedby\ntreating SVPs differently than other civil commitments.\nThe Equal Protection Clause does not create any new rights, but requires that\npersons under like circumstances be given equal protections. Skinn'er v. Oklahoma,\n316 U.S. 535 (1942). A state legislature may mal_e certain classes of persons subject\nto specific legislation as long as the classification is based upon some difference in\nthe class reasonably relating to a legitimate government purpose. G_dfC. & S. F. R.\nCo. v. Ellis, 165 U.S. 150 (1896).\nIn Baxtrom v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, 111 (1966) the Court held that treating\nseparate classifications of patients differently based upon their degree of\ndangerousness was reasonable. The Court stated:\nEqual protection does not require that all persons be dent with\nidentically, but it does require that a distinction made have some\nrelevance to the purpose for which the classification is made.\nClassification of mentally ill persons as either insane or dangerously\ninsane of course may be a reasonable distinction for purposes of\ndetermining the type of custodial or medical care to be given, ....\nfd. at 111.\nAssuming Plaintiffs' allegations that they are treated differently than other\npatients at ASH are true, it remains also true that the legislature can determine that\ndifferent commitment types can be treated differently at ASH and be subject to\ndifferent rules of conduct.\n39\n\nTherefore, the law in the area is not so clearly estabIished to overcome\nDefendants' defense of qualified immunity.\nJ. Defendants are Entitled to Qualified Immuni_¢ Because Plaintiffs Tenth\nAlleged Claim of a Violation of the Right to Privacy Fails to Allege\nViolation of a Clearly Established Constitutional Right.\nThe SAC admits that Plaintiffs are all confined to a secure mental institution.\n(ER 0463) As such, their privacy must be compromised for the orderly operation, and\nthe safety and security of the institution. Plaintiffs have not alleged that any lack of\nprivacy is unrelated to a compelling state interest in the operation of the institution.\nThus, the allegations in the SAC fail to allege that a clearly established constitutional\nviolation and defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.\nFor safety and security reasons patients at a maximum security state hospital\ncannot reasonably maintain an expectation of complete Fourth Amendment privacy\nduring their confinement. In Hudson v. Palmer, a prison inmate case, the Court\nstated: \"A right of privacy in traditional Fourth Amendment terms is fundamentally\nincompatible with the close and continual surveillance of inmates and their cells\nrequired to ensure institutional security and internal order.\" Hudson v. Palmer, 468\nU.S. 517, 527 (1984).\nIn Hudson the privacy issue was not an issue of punishment, but one of\ninstitutional safety and security. The same issues are present at ASH. A claim that\n40\n\nrights are violated must include facts stating a claim under the circumstances of the\nconfinement. Plaintiffs have failed to meet that test.\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that one aspect of the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment is \"a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain\nareas or zones of privacy.\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 152 (1973)\"\nHowever, the Supreme Court has not determined that a constitutional violation\noccurs when confined individuals are not provided complete privacy when\nshowering, sleeping, using the toilets or participating in therapy sessions while\nconfined in a maximum security mental institution.\nAlthough the specific issues included in the Tenth Alleged Claim are unclear,\nit is clear that in the Ninth Circuit a person confined in a secure institution does not\nhave a right to be free from observation while showering, in their room, or otherwise\nin the institution, based on the State's compelling need to maintain the security of the\ninstitution. Gr_lmmett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491,494 (1985).\nPlaintiffs have failed to allege a constitutional violation and Defendants' are\nentitled to qualified immunity for their reasonable belief that their alleged actions\nwere appropriate under both the federal and state constitutions.\n1. Defendants are Entitled to Qualified Immunity on Plaintiffs'\nCalifornia Constitutional Privacy Claims.\nIn addition to being barred by the Eleventh Amendment and not being\n41\n\ncognizable under section 1983 Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on\nPlaintiffs' claim of aviolation of aright to privacy under the California Constitution,\nArticle 1,section 1.\nThe Court in this instance is bound to follow the California Supreme Court's\ninterpretation of the California Constitution. Fresno Rifle & Pistol Club, Inc. v. Van\nde Kamp, 746 F. Supp. 1415, 1423 (E.D. Cal. 1990). A review of cases decided by\nthe California Courts since 1972, when the privacy right was added to the California\nConstitution, reveals no cases that equate the right to privacy for persons properly\nconfined to any of Plaintiffs' allegations in the SAC. Until the California Supreme\nCourt finds such a right, federal courts must refrain from doing so. Stripping an\nofficial of their qualified immunity for an alleged violation of such undiscovered right\nwould be tantamount to finding such a right.\nIn Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 7 Cal.4th 1 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834]\n(1994) the California Supreme Court set out clear and detailed guidelines for courts\nto follow in addressing alleged violations of California's right to privacy. Under Hill,\na privacy claim has three elements. \"The first element of a state constitutional cause\nof action for invasion of privacy is the identification of a specific, legally protected\nprivacy interest.\" Id. at 654.\nThe second essential element of a state constitutional cause of actio_ for\ninvasion of privacy is a reasonable expectation of privacy on plaintiffs part. Id. at\n42\n\n655. The third element is that \"actionable invasions of privacy must be sufficiently\nserious in their nature, scope, and actual or potential impact to constitute an egi:egious\nbreach of the social norms underlying the privacy right.\" Id. at 655.\nHowever, Hill goes on to say that if all three of those\" elements are established\nthe plaintifPs privacy interest must still be balanced against countervailing interests.\n\"Invasion of a privacy interest is not a violation of the state constitutional right to\nprivacy if the invasion is justified by a competing interest.\" Id. at 655-56. \"Conduct\nalleged to be an invasion of privacy is to be evaluated based on the extent to which\nit furthers legitimate and important competing interests.\" Id. at 656.\nPlaintiffs have not alleged elements two and three of the Hill analysis. Neither\nhave Plaintiffs alleged anything to overcome the cotmtervailing state interest aspect\nof the Hill balancing test. Any right to privacy Plaintiffs have while confined in a\nsecure mental institution is very limited. Grummett, 779 F.2d at 495; People v.\nMartinez, 88 Cal.App.4th 465 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 841] (2001)(no right to privacy of\nSVP medical and therapy information due to compelling state interest in use of\ninformation for evaluation of individual).\nReasonable officials in Defendants' positions would believe that their actions\nas alleged in the SAC are acceptable practice in a secure mental institution and are\nprotected by qualified immunity. Defendants would believe their alleged actions\nwere appropriate because the state constitutional right to privacy does not prohibit the\n43\n\nactions alleged in the SAC.\nSince no violation of a constitutional right has been alleged, even if the claims\nwere cognizable under section 1983 and not barred by the Eleventh Amendment\nindividual liability is precluded by qualified immunity.\nCONCLUSION \" \"\nThe Eleventh Amendment bars damage claims against state officials in their\nofficial capacities. The Eleventh Amendment and doctrine of abstention precludes\nfederal courts from discovering new rights under state constitutions. Defendants are\nentitled to qualified immunity on all of Plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs fail to allege\nviolations of constitutional rights applicable to Plaintiffs and violations of clearly\nestablished constitutional rights. Reasonable officials in Defendants' positions would\nbeIieve their actions, as alleged, were lawful.\nDATED: February 9, 2004\nBILL LOCKYER\nAttorney General of the State of California\nJAMES M.

SCHROEDER, Chief Judge, HARRY PREGERSON and STEPHEN S. TROTT, Circuit Judges.\nOpinion by Judge PREGERSON; Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent by Judge TROTT.\nORDER\nThe opinion in this case published at 466 F.3d 676 (9th Cir.2006), is withdrawn and replaced by the new opinion\nand dissent filed concurrently with this order.\nChief Judge Schroeder and Judge Pregerson voted to deny appellant's petition for panel rehearing and for\nrehearing en banc. Judge Trott voted to grant the petition for panel rehearing and recommended granting the\npetition for rehearing en banc. The full court has been advised of the petition for rehearing en banc, and no judge\n983 of the court has requested en *983 banc rehearing. See Fed. R.App. P. 35(b). The petitions for panel rehearing\nand for rehearing en banc are DENIED.\nNo further petitions for rehearing will be entertained.\nOPINION\nPREGERSON, Circuit Judge:\nPlaintiffs-Appellees represent a class of approximately six hundred civilly committed persons and those awaiting\ncommitment at Atascadero State Hospital pursuant to California's Sexually Violent Predators Act (\"SVP Act\").\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the conditions of their confinement violate their constitutional rights. They request declaratory\nand injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss based largely on\nqualified immunity. The district court denied the motion, which the Defendants now appeal. We have jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1291; we affirm in part and reverse in part.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nA. California's Sexually Violent Predators Scheme\nThe SVP Act defines an SVP as a person \"convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims for\nwhich he or she received a determinate sentence and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the\nperson a danger to the health and safety of others\" i.e., is \"likely [to] engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\"\n[1]\nCal. Welf. & Inst.Code § 6600(a).  The Department of Corrections and the Department of Mental Health\nevaluate convicts who committed predicate offenses at least six months before those convicts complete their\nsentences. See id. § 6601. If those two departments agree that the convict might qualify as an SVP, the district\nattorney (or counsel for the county in which the evaluated person was convicted) may file a petition for\ncommitment. See id. § 6601(i). If a jury finds someone to be an SVP, that person is civilly committed for an\nindefinite period to commence after his criminal sentence is fulfilled. Id. §§ 6602-6604.\nOnce civilly committed, SVPs undergo a five-phase treatment program. Phase One consists of group sessions\nthat educate the SVP about California's SVP Act. During Phase One, the SVP must attend and participate in the\n[2]\ntreatment sessions. If he does not, his access level  is reduced and he is not allowed to advance to Phase Two\nof the treatment program. In addition, an SVP's failure to attend or participate in treatment sessions is used\nagainst him at future probable cause and confinement hearings. The SVP cannot advance beyond Phase One\nunless he signs a statement in which he acknowledges that he has an \"illness\" that requires \"treatment.\" Plaintiffs\nallege that the signed statements are often used against them as admissions of illness in future probable cause\nand confinement hearings.\nPhases Two through Five of the treatment plan involve \"cognitive\" treatment. This treatment includes viewing\n984 videos that depict violent or other inappropriate sexual activities while a repugnant odor or *984 other unpleasant\nsensation is applied to elicit a negative association.\nEach year, an SVP has a right to a \"show cause hearing\" to determine whether his commitment should be\ncontinued. Id. § 6605(a)-(b). If it is found that the SVP continues to be a danger to the health or safety of the\ncommunity, the person is committed for two years from the date of the finding. Id. § 6605(e). Successive periods\nof commitment can be continued indefinitely, or until the SVP completes all five phases of treatment. Upon\nsuccessful completion of Phase Five, the SVP is conditionally released under the supervision of the California\nMental Health Department. According to the Plaintiffs, \"only a handful of SVPs have been allowed into Phase\nFour and no SVP has progressed to Phase Five or ha[s] been found to be ready for release under the treatment\n[3]\nprotocol.\"\nB. The Current Lawsuit\nOn September 2, 1998, the Plaintiffs filed a pro se class action, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, against Defendants-\nAppellants Stephen Mayberg (Director of the California Department of Mental Health), Cal A. Terhune (Director of\nthe California Department of Corrections), Jon DeMorales (former Executive Director at Atascadero State\nHospital), Grenda Ernst (Clinical Administrator at Atascadero State Hospital), and Craig Nelson (Senior\nPsychologist Specialist at Atascadero State Hospital). The Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as\nwell as monetary damages, on the grounds that the policies and procedures governing their confinement and\ntreatment at Atascadero State Hospital violate their constitutional rights.\nIn March 1999, the district court appointed pro bono counsel for the Plaintiffs. Counsel filed an amended\ncomplaint approximately five months later. The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss\nraised Eleventh Amendment and qualified immunity defenses. The district court denied the motion.\n\n[4]\nThe Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 14, 2002.  Both the first and second amended\ncomplaints alleged that the Defendants violated the Plaintiffs' rights by, inter alia: (1) force-medicating the\nPlaintiffs in non-emergency situations; (2) reducing the Plaintiffs' access levels and other privileges as a form of\npunishment for refusing to participate in treatment sessions or as retaliation for filing lawsuits; (3) putting the\nPlaintiffs in restraints for nonthreatening and/or non-disruptive conduct, including the refusal to participate in\ntreatment or therapy; (4) subjecting the Plaintiffs to public strip-searches (sometimes while in four-point\nrestraints); (5) failing to protect the Plaintiffs from abuse by other patients or by Atascadero employees; (6) failing\nto provide the Plaintiffs with constitutionally satisfactory conditions of confinement; (7) forcing the Plaintiffs to\nparticipate in treatment; and (8) denying the Plaintiffs adequate treatment, thereby converting the Plaintiffs' civil\nconfinement to a de facto extension of their prison sentence.\nThe Defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint, on the same grounds presented in their first\nmotion to dismiss. The district court again denied the motion. The Defendants timely appealed. The Defendants\n985 contend that the district court erred by failing to rule that *985 the Eleventh Amendment, state abstention\ndoctrine, or qualified immunity barr the Plaintiffs' suit.\nANALYSIS\nA. Standard of Review\nWe review de novo the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss. Decker v. Advantage Fund, Ltd., 362 F.3d\n593, 595-96 (9th Cir.2004). Immunity under the Eleventh Amendment presents a question of law, which we\nreview de novo. See Demshki v. Monteith, 255 F.3d 986, 988 (9th Cir.2001). To determine if the Defendants are\nentitled to qualified immunity, we review de novo whether governing law was clearly established at the time of the\nalleged violation and whether the specific facts alleged constitute a violation of established law. See Mabe v. San\nBernardino County Dept. of Pub. Soc. Servs., 237 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir.2001).\nAlthough a district court's denial of a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is not ordinarily\nappealable, the denial of a claim for immunity is appealable before final judgment under the collateral order\ndoctrine and is reviewed de novo. See Morley v. Walker, 175 F.3d 756, 759 (9th Cir.1999). All allegations of\nmaterial fact are accepted as true and should be construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. See Resnick v.\nHayes, 213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). A \"complaint should not be dismissed [under Rule 12(b)(6)] unless it\nappears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle the\nplaintiff to relief.\" Thompson v. Davis, 295 F.3d 890, 895 (9th Cir.2002).\nWe note, again, the special difficulty of deciding the motion to dismiss a Defendant on qualified immunity grounds\nat this stage. Under the notice pleading standard of the Federal Rules, plaintiffs are only required to give a \"short\nand plain statement\" of their claims. Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Thus, when reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint\nbefore receiving any evidence, our task is a limited one. \"The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail\nbut whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims.\" Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232,\n236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974).\nAs we recognized in Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952 (9th Cir.2004), a motion to dismiss on\nqualified immunity grounds puts the court in the difficult position of deciding \"far-reaching constitutional questions\non a non-existent factual record.\" Id. at 957. While \"government officials have the right . . . to raise . . . qualified\nimmunity defense on a motion to dismiss, the exercise of that authority is not a wise choice in every case.\" Id. We\nfind that applicable here. The policy justifying qualified immunity motions at this stage is to protect officers against\nthe burden of discovery and pretrial motions. See Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 308, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133\nL.Ed.2d 773 (1996). In this case, it appears that discovery was almost complete. The Defendants could have\npresented this as a motion for summary judgment, and we would have a more developed factual record to guide\nour decision. However, because the Defendants' motion is framed as a motion to dismiss, we must evaluate the\nmerits of the Defendants' qualified immunity defense before we know the full extent of the alleged abuses at\nAtascadero, or the reason behind Atascadero policy, or the level of involvement the Defendants had in creating\nthe conditions at Atascadero. As we decide the Defendants' motion, however, we are cautious not to eviscerate\n\nthe notice pleading standard in suits where qualified immunity is at issue. See Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara,\n986 307 F.3d 1119, *986 1125-26 (9th Cir.2002).[5]\nB. The Law of the Case Doctrine\nThe Plaintiffs argue that under the law of the case doctrine, we should not reach the merits of the Defendants'\nappeal because the Defendants' second motion to dismiss was barred by the district court's denial of the\nDefendants' first motion to dismiss. The relevant facts are as follows: after the Plaintiffs filed their first amended\ncomplaint, the Defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and based on qualified immunity. The\ndistrict court denied the motion, and the Defendants did not appeal. The Plaintiffs filed a second amended\ncomplaint, in which they changed only the name of one of the Defendants. The Defendants then moved to\ndismiss on grounds substantially similar to those in the previous motion. The district court again denied the\nmotion. The Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants' second motion to dismiss is an impermissible \"second bite at\nthe apple\" and should be dismissed under the law of the case doctrine.\n\"Under the law of the case doctrine, a court is ordinarily precluded from reexamining an issue previously decided\nby the same court, or a higher court, in the same case.\" Richardson v. United States, 841 F.2d 993, 996 (9th\nCir.1988) (citations omitted). For the law of the case doctrine to apply, \"the issue in question must have been\n`decided explicitly or by necessary implication in [the] previous disposition.'\" United States v. Lummi Indian Tribe,\n235 F.3d 443, 452 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting Liberty Mut. Ins. v. EEOC, 691 F.2d 438, 441 (9th Cir.1982)); United\nStates v. Cote, 51 F.3d 178 (9th Cir.1995) (\"[T]he law of the case acts as a bar only when the issue in question\nwas actually considered and decided by the first court.\").\nThe district court denied both of Defendants' motions to dismiss in one-line orders. Thus, we do not know the\ndistrict court's grounds for denying the motions. Nor can we say that the district court decided any issue by\nimplication in the first order. The district court could have denied either motion for any number of procedural or\ntechnical reasons unrelated to the substance of the motions. It is possible that the district court denied the\nDefendants' second motion based on the law of the case doctrine, but, it is also possible that the district court\ndecided, in its discretion, not to apply the law of the case doctrine due to subsequent changes in the law, or that\nthe \"manifest injustice\" that would result given the new party to the suit. See United States v. Alexander, 106 F.3d\n874, 876 (9th Cir.1997). Because we cannot determine the bases for the district court's denial of the motions, the\n\"law of the case\" does not apply. Therefore, we address the appeal on the merits.\nC. Eleventh Amendment Immunity and the Abstention Doctrine\nThe Defendants concede that suits for injunctive or declaratory relief do not violate the Eleventh Amendment\n987 under Ex*987parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). The Defendants contend, instead,\nthat the Eleventh Amendment bars the Plaintiffs' request for monetary damages. The Plaintiffs cannot seek\nmonetary damages against state officials in their official capacity. See Doe v. Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab., 131\nF.3d 836, 839 (9th Cir.1997). But, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar damage suits against state officials in\ntheir personal capacity. Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 30, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991); Ashker v. Cal.\nDep't of Corr., 112 F.3d 392, 394-95 (9th Cir.1997).\nThe Plaintiffs allege the Defendants acted in individual and official capacities, and therefore, the Plaintiffs are\nsuing them in both their individual and official capacities. Thus we presume the Plaintiffs are seeking monetary\ndamages against the Defendants in their personal capacity. See Romano v. Bible, 169 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th\nCir.1999) (stating a strong presumption in favor of a personal capacity suit where an official capacity suit for\ndamages would be barred). Accordingly, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the Plaintiffs' claim for damages\nagainst the Defendants in so far as they are being sued in their individual capacities.\nThe Defendants also argue that they are immune because the Plaintiffs are attempting to enforce pendent state\nlaw claims in federal court. The Plaintiffs refer, in their first, second, and tenth claims for relief, to provisions in the\nCalifornia Constitution that parallel applicable provisions in the United States Constitution. The Plaintiffs concede\nthat they could not prevail on a § 1983 claim based on a violation of state law, because § 1983, by its own terms,\nprotects only against violations of federal law. Ybarra v. Bastian, 647 F.2d 891, 892 (9th Cir.1981). Instead, the\nPlaintiffs cite California law only where it is legitimate to do so, e.g., where there is a state-created liberty or\n\nproperty interest at stake. See, e.g, Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 710-12, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).\nAccordingly, the Plaintiffs' claims are not barred on this ground, and we need not consider the Defendants'\n[6]\narguments that the Plaintiffs' state law claims are \"novel and complex\" under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c).\nD. Section 1983 Claims\nThe Defendants' first substantive argument is that the Plaintiffs have not properly pled a claim under § 1983,\nbecause they are not proper defendants for a § 1983 suit. \"To sustain an action under section 1983, a plaintiff\nmust show (1) that the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2)\nthat the conduct deprived the plaintiff of a federal constitutional or statutory right.\" Wood v. Ostrander, 879 F.2d\n583, 587 (9th Cir.1989).\nAll the Defendants were acting under the color of California law when they engaged in the alleged\n988 unconstitutional conduct. The Defendants argue, however, that their conduct did not deprive the *988 Plaintiffs of\nconstitutional or statutory rights.\nA person deprives another of a constitutional right, where that person \"does an affirmative act, participates in\nanother's affirmative acts, or omits to perform an act which[that person] is legally required to do that causes the\ndeprivation of which complaint is made.\" Johnson v. Duffy, 588 F.2d 740, 743 (9th Cir.1978). Indeed, the\n\"requisite causal connection can be established not only by some kind of direct personal participation in the\ndeprivation, but also by setting in motion a series of acts by others which the actor knows or reasonably should\nknow would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.\" Id. at 743-44.\nIn limited circumstances, a person can also be subject to § 1983 liability for the acts of others. Although there is\nno pure respondeat superior liability under § 1983, a supervisor is liable for the constitutional violations of\nsubordinates \"if the supervisor participated in or directed the violations, or knew of the violations and failed to act\nto prevent them.\" Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989).\nThe Plaintiffs proceed on two theories: (a) that the Defendants created policies and procedures that violated the\nPlaintiffs' constitutional rights; and (b) that the Defendants were willfully blind to constitutional violations\ncommitted by their subordinates. Because the Defendants were directors and policy-makers for Atascadero State\nHospital, the Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the constitutional violations they suffered were \"set in motion\"\nby the Defendants' policy decisions or, at the very least, that the Defendants knew of these abuses and\ndemonstrated a deliberate indifference to the Plaintiffs' plight.\nUnder Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d 628, 633-34 (9th Cir.1988), the Plaintiffs will need to show how the deliberate\nindifference or affirmative actions of each Defendant caused a constitutional violation before they can seek\nmonetary damages against any individual Defendant. At this stage of pleading, however, the Plaintiffs' need not\nspecifically delineate how each Defendant contributed to the violation of their constitutional rights. Indeed, we do\nnot see how, prior to discovery, they could\nplead the individual roles of each state officer with any more specificity. Taking the statements in the complaint in\nthe light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs may be able to state a claim against all of the named\nDefendants, each of whom played an instrumental role in policymaking and enforcement at Atascadero State\nHospital. Therefore, we hold the Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the Defendants' role in the alleged\nconstitutional violations against SVPs to survive this motion to dismiss.\nE. Qualified Immunity\nThe Defendants also argued that the district court erred when it denied them qualified immunity. As the\nDefendants have conceded, qualified immunity is only an immunity from a suit for damages, and does not\nprovide immunity from suit for declaratory or injunctive relief. See L.A. Police Protective League v. Gates, 995\nF.2d 1469, 1472 (9th Cir.1993). The Defendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity to the extent\nthat the Plaintiffs seek monetary damages.\nIn analyzing the Defendants' qualified immunity defense, we must determine: (1) what right has been violated; (2)\nwhether that right was so \"clearly established\" at the time of the incident that a reasonable official would have\n\nbeen aware that the conduct violated constitutional bounds; and (3) whether a reasonable public official could\n989 have believed that the alleged conduct *989 was lawful. See Newell v. Sauser, 79 F.3d 115, 117 (9th Cir.1996).\nTo withstand the Defendants' claims of qualified immunity, the Plaintiffs must allege a violation of a right that was\nclearly established in 1998 00 the time the alleged constitutional violations first occurred. See Anderson,483 U.S.\n97\nat 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034; Sorrels v. McKee, 290 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir.2002). To defeat qualified immunity, \"the\nright allegedly violated must be defined at the appropriate level of specificity before a court can determine if it was\nclearly established.\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999).\nBut, the Plaintiffs need not establish that the Defendants' \"behavior had been previously declared\nunconstitutional.\" Blueford v. Prunty, 108 F.3d 251, 254 (9th Cir.1997). Rather, if binding authority indicates that\n\"the disputed right existed, even if no case had specifically so declared,\" the Defendants would be on notice of\nthe right. Id. at 255. If the occasion has not risen for our circuit to reach a question, we may draw clearly\nestablished law from other circuits. See Prison Legal News v. Lehman, 397 F.3d 692, 701 (9th Cir.2005); Jacobs\nv. City of Chicago, 215 F.3d 758, 767 (7th Cir.2000) (finding a violation of clearly established law where there is\n\"such a clear trend in the case law\" that recognition of the right is \"only a matter of time\").\nBefore we consider the Plaintiffs' claims individually to determine whether the claims were clearly established in\n1998, we address a threshold question that applies to the Plaintiffs' claims more generally. The Defendants\nargue, as a broad proposition, that damages are not appropriate in this suit because the law applicable to SVPs\nis still evolving. This suit is unique, in that it is one of the first widespread class actions to challenge the conditions\nof detention for civilly confined SVPs. However, the Defendants may have transgressed some clearly established\nboundaries.\nFirst, civilly detained persons must be afforded \"more considerate treatment and conditions of confinement than\ncriminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.\" Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 322,\n102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982); see also Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2000). It follows\nlogically, then, that the rights afforded prisoners set a floor for those that must be afforded SVPs, and that where\nthe Defendants violate a standard that is clearly established in the prison context, the violation is clearly\nestablished under the SVP scheme, except where the California SVP statutory scheme would give a reasonable\n[7]\nofficial reason to believe that the body of law applicable to prisoners would not apply.\nSecond, where there is clearly established body of law that applies to all civilly committed persons, there is no\nreason that the law should not apply to SVPs as well. For, as we have previously held:\nThe state cannot have it both ways. If confinement of a sexually violent predator is civil for the\npurposes of evaluation under the Ex Post Facto clause, that confinement is civil for the purposes\n990 of defining the rights to which the detainee *990 is entitled while confined. Civil status means civil\nstatus, with all the . . . rights that accompany it.\nJones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 933 (9th Cir.2004).\nThus, there are two bodies of law from which we might draw \"clearly established\" law for qualified immunity\npurposes: first, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is clearly established even in the prison context,\nand second, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is clearly established for all civilly detained persons.\nWe acknowledge at the outset that it is not always clearly established how much more expansive the rights of\ncivilly detained persons are than those of criminally detained persons. As discussed below, the rights afforded\ncivilly detained persons are flexible enough to take into account the circumstances of detention. The law\ngenerally requires a careful balancing of the rights of individuals who are detained for treatment, not punishment,\nagainst the state's interests in institutional security and the safety of those housed at the facility. See, e.g., \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 319-22, 102 S.Ct. 2452. In weighing those interests, it cannot be ignored that, unlike the\nplaintiff in Youngberg who was civilly committed because of mental infirmities, SVPs have been civilly committed\nsubsequent to criminal convictions and have been adjudged to pose a danger to the health and safety of others.\nTherefore, the rights of SVPs may not necessarily be coexistensive with those of all other civilly detained\n[8]\npersons.\n\nWith these threshold issues in mind, we review each of the Plaintiffs' claims to determine whether they have\nsufficiently pled a violation of clearly established rights.\n1. First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights\nThe Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants retaliated against them for filing lawsuits regarding conditions at\nAtascadero State Hospital. Specifically, the Plaintiffs claim that, as a result of preparing this suit and others\nregarding conditions at Atascadero, they have been subjected to access-level reductions, harassment by\nAtascadero personnel, and excessive room searches and seizures of property. The Plaintiffs also alleged that\nthey have been denied library access in retaliation of their bringing suit and filing complaints.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment right to access the courts survives detention. See Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817,\n821-22, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977) (\"It is now established beyond doubt that prisoners have a\nconstitutional right of access to the courts.\"); Cornett v. Donovan, 51 F.3d 894, 898 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that\n\"right of access [to the courts] is guaranteed to people institutionalized in a state mental hospital regardless of\nwhether they are civilly committed after criminal proceedings or civilly committed on grounds of dangerousness\").\n991 Similarly, punishment in retaliation for exercising one's right to access the courts may constitute *991 a First\nAmendment violation. See Rizzo v. Dawson, 778 F.2d 527, 531-32 (9th Cir.1985).\nWe have held that the prohibition against retaliatory punishment is \"`clearly established law' in the Ninth Circuit,\nfor qualified immunity purposes.\" Pratt v. Rowland, 65 F.3d 802, 806 & n. 4 (9th Cir.1995). Given the facts\n[9]\nalleged,  the Plaintiffs may be able to prove they were punished in retaliation for exercising their First and\nFourteenth Amendment rights to file grievances about the conditions of their confinement. Accordingly, their\nclaims should not be dismissed at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.\nThe Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants force them to participate in treatment that violates their First\nAmendment rights. Specifically, the Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants bar SVPs from progressing beyond\nPhase One and obtaining higher access levels until they sign contracts admitting that they have an illness and\nneed treatment. The decision to sign the contract is the ultimate Catch-22: during re-commitment hearings, the\ncontract is used against those who sign it as an admission of illness, and used against those who do not sign it\nas a refusal to be amenable to treatment.\nThe Plaintiffs also allege that SVPs who attend but do not vocally participate in group treatment sessions are\nfound by the Defendants to be \"not progressing,\" Accordingly, these SVPs do not advance to other phases of the\nprogram and their access levels are restricted. The Plaintiffs argue that they have a First Amendment right to\nrefrain from saying that they have an illness and to refuse to participate in treatment, and that the Defendants\nmay not punish them for exercising their rights.\nThere may be a First Amendment right not to participate in treatment, a right respected by the language of\nCalifornia's SVP Act, if not in its implementation. Specifically, the SVP Act directs:\nAmenability to treatment is not required for a finding that any person is a person described in\nSection 6600, nor is it required for treatment of that person. Treatment does not mean that the\ntreatment be successful or potentially successful, nor does it mean that the person must recognize\nhis or her problem and willingly participate in the treatment program.\nCal. Welf. & Inst.Code § 6606(b) (emphasis added). While it may be in the Plaintiffs' interest to participate in\ntreatment, and the State may create incentives to encourage such participation, \"[t]he right of freedom of thought\nand of religion as guaranteed by the Constitution against State action includes both the right to speak freely and\nthe right to refrain from speaking at all.\" W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 645, 63 S.Ct. 1178,\n87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943) (Murphy, J., concurring). As is the case with prisoners, civilly committed persons retain\nthose First Amendment rights not inherently inconsistent with the circumstances of their detention. See Turner v.\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). The above statutory language strongly suggests\n992 that refusal to recognize one's \"illness\" or affirmatively participate in treatment is not inherently inconsistent *992\nwith the purposes for which SVPs are detained.\n\nGranted, the Plaintiffs are not actually forced to speak, but the stakes for refusing to speak are so high that the\nPlaintiffs' participation in treatment is essentially compulsory. Indeed, an SVP who exercised his right not to admit\nhis illness could be detained indefinitely. He would never advance past Phase One of the program and his refusal\ncould be used against him at his re-commitment hearing as a sign that he was not sufficiently \"rehabilitated\" to\nre-enter society.\nSeveral inmates who are criminally detained raised analogous arguments, on Fifth Amendment grounds, that\nprograms that force sexual offenders to admit and discuss those offenses violate their rights against self-\nincrimination. In McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002), the Supreme Court held\nthat a program did not violate an SPV's Fifth Amendment rights where it \"did not extend his term of incarceration\n. . . [or] affect his eligibility for good-time credits or parole,\" and the only adverse consequence was that he was\nmoved to the less desirable non-treatment area of the prison. Id. at 38-39, 122 S.Ct. 2017.\nBut McKune explicitly left open the question of whether a greater deprivation of liberty might run afoul of the\nConstitution by essentially compelling detainees to incriminate themselves. At least one court, reading McKune,\nallowed an inmate to proceed past pre-trial motions on First Amendment grounds where the right to parole was\nconditioned on participation in treatment. See Wolfe v. Penn. Dep't of Corr., 334 F.Supp.2d 762, 770-73 (E.D.Pa.\n2004). Similarly, in this case, where the stakes for participation in treatment are so high, the deprivations involved\nin refusing to participate in treatment may rise to the level of compulsion that violates the First Amendment.\nThe question at this stage, however, is not whether the right exists, but whether such a right is clearly established\nunder the First Amendment. Given the volatility of the law on this point, we cannot say that it is. The challenged\nprograms are facially related to the purposes for which SVPs are detained, and while SVPs may have a right to\nrefuse to participate in such treatment, it is not yet clear the extent to which the State can condition privileges or\nadvancement on participation in such treatment. As such, these claims may be more appropriately considered for\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief.\nThus, we hold that the Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims were based on clearly established law insofar as they\nchallenge retaliation for filing lawsuits. To the extent that the claim relies on a First Amendment right not to\nparticipate in treatment sessions, the Defendants have qualified immunity, because the law on this point is not\nclearly established.\n2. Fourth Amendment Rights\nThe Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' policies and practices subject Plaintiffs to unreasonable searches, seizures,\nand unnecessary use of force. According to the Plaintiffs, they are subjected to public strip searches, retaliatory\nsearches of their possessions, and arbitrary seizures of their personal belongings upon arrival at Atascadero.\nSVPs are also shackled during transport to Atascadero and during visits with family and friends. When they\nrefuse to participate in treatment, SVPs are subjected to \"red light alarms\" even when they do not pose any\n993 physical risk.[10] Moreover, SVPs are force-medicated as a *993 means of intimidation and punishment, and for\nthe convenience of staff.\nAccepting these allegations as true, the Plaintiffs may be able to state a \"clearly established\" violation of their\nFourth Amendment rights, and thus, the claims are not appropriate for dismissal at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage. The\nwatchword of the Fourth Amendment in every context is \"reasonableness.\" As this court held in Thompson v.\nSouza, 111 F.3d 694 (9th Cir.1997), \"the Fourth Amendment right to be secure against unreasonable searches\nand seizures `extends to incarcerated prisoners.'\" Id. at 699 (quoting Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332\n(9th Cir. 1988)). Thus, this protection certainly extends to SVPs.\nOf course, \"the reasonableness of a particular search [or seizure] is determined by reference to the[detention]\ncontext.\" Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 332. There are concerns that mirror those that arise in the prison context:\ne.g., \"the safety and security of guards and others in the facility, order within the facility and the efficiency of the\nfacility's operations.\" Andrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052, 1061 (8th Cir.2001). But even so, qualified immunity does\nnot protect a search or seizure that is arbitrary, retaliatory, or clearly exceeds the legitimate purpose of detention.\n\nUnder this framework, we cannot dismiss the Plaintiffs' claims. The \"reasonableness\" of a search or seizures is a\nfact-intensive inquiry that cannot be determined at this stage. See, e.g., Thompson, 111 F.3d 694 (9th Cir.1997).\nIt is impossible to make such a fact-specific determination when the precise circumstances of the searches or\nseizures are not before the court and when the Defendants have not yet had a chance to justify the alleged\nsearches or seizures. We cannot say, then, that the Plaintiffs cannot possibly state a \"clearly established\n[11]\nviolation\" based on any facts consistent with their pleadings.  Therefore, Defendants do not have a right to\ndismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) based on qualified immunity.\n3. Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses\nThe Plaintiffs allege violations of the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto clauses. While the Plaintiffs concede\nthat these two clauses have punishment as an essential prerequisite and that the SVP Act is a civil detention\nstatute, they claim that the SVP Act is punitive as applied to them. As such, the Plaintiffs argue that their Double\nJeopardy and Ex Post Facto claims are not barred.\nIn upholding a law similar to California's SVP Act, the Supreme Court held that \"[a]n Act, found to be civil, cannot\nbe deemed punitive `as applied' to a single individual in violation of the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto\nclauses and provide cause for release.\" Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 267, 121 S.Ct. 727, 148 L.Ed.2d 734\n(2001). Similarly, the California Supreme Court stressed the civil nature of a sexually violent predator\ncommitment and rejected challenges to California's SVP Act based on the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy\nClauses of the federal constitution. See Hubbart v. Super. Ct., 19 Cal.4th 1138, 1171, 81 Cal. Rptr.2d 492, 969\nP.2d 584 (1999). The Plaintiffs' claims based on the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto clauses of the federal\n[12]\nconstitution are foreclosed.\n994 *994 The Plaintiffs argue that Seling does not control because they are not \"seeking release\" as was the habeas\npetitioner in Seling. This is a distinction without a difference. The court in Seling made it abundantly clear that the\ncivil nature of the SVP scheme \"cannot be altered based merely on the vagaries in implementation of the\nauthorizing statute.\" Id. at 263, 121 S.Ct. 727. Accordingly, we hold that the civil nature of California's SVP Act is\nnot altered because of the remedy sought and we reverse the district court's order denying Defendants' motion to\ndismiss the claims related to the Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy Clauses.\n4. Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Claims\nThe Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the \"restrictive and denigrating conditions\" at the Atascadero State\nHospital constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The Eighth Amendment\nhas, as an essential prerequisite, the right to punish. See DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Soc. Servs.,\n489 U.S. 189, 199 n. 6, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (\"The State does not acquire the power to punish with\nwhich the Eighth Amendment is concerned until after it has secured a formal adjudication of guilt in accordance\nwith due process of law.\"). Here, SVPs are detained for the purpose of treatment, and the state's power to punish\nthem expires at the end of their sentence. Accordingly, the Eighth Amendment is not the proper vehicle to\nchallenge the conditions of civil commitment. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nThe thrust of the Plaintiffs' claim here is that because the conditions of confinement amount to punishment, they\nshould be permitted to argue that this \"punishment\" is cruel and unusual. Once again, this \"punitive as applied\"\nargument is foreclosed by Seling. Therefore, we hold that the district court erred when it failed to dismiss the\nEighth Amendment claim against the Defendants.\nOf course, this is a small victory for the Defendants, because the same claims for inhumane treatment and failure\nto protect may be raised under the Fourteenth Amendment. The standard applicable to SVPs under the\nFourteenth Amendment is at least coextensive with that applicable to prisoners under the Eighth Amendment. \nSee, e.g., Munoz v. Kolender, 208 F.Supp.2d 1125, 1146 (S.D.Cal.2002) (applying Fourteenth Amendment\nstandards to SVPs because \"comparable standards apply to both prisoners' Eighth Amendment cruel and\nunusual punishment and Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process analyses, with Fourteenth Amendment\nanalysis borrowing from Eighth Amendment standards\"); Frost v. Agnos, 152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir.1998)\n\n(applying Eighth Amendment standards to evaluate pretrial detainees' Fourteenth Amendment claims). Moreover,\nthe Eighth Amendment provides too little protection for those whom the state cannot punish. See Jones, 393 F.3d\nat 931-34; Andrews, 253 F.3d at 1061. Plaintiffs apparently recognize this, because their Eighth Amendment\nclaims largely duplicate those raised under the substantive due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n995 Accordingly, we *995 consider the Plaintiffs' allegations that the Defendants actions violate their due process\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n5. Fourteenth Amendment Procedural Due Process Claims\nThe Plaintiffs allege a number of procedural due process violations. They allege that Defendants force them to\nparticipate in the five-phase treatment program at Atascadero, and based on their progression through that\ntreatment program, subject them to privilege reductions, access level reductions, and reclassifications, and force\nthem to take medication in non-emergency situations. The Plaintiffs allege that these deprivations occur without\nadequate notice of, or opportunity to respond to, accusations of alleged sanctionable conduct. The Plaintiffs cite\ncaselaw applicable to prisoners and argue that the procedural protections afforded to prisoners in this context\nshould be afforded them as well.\nThe Plaintiffs have not adequately pled the loss of clearly established due process rights. The Supreme Court\nhas explained that due process claims by prisoners depend in large part on whether the prisoners have some\n\"justifiable expectation rooted in state law.\" Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U.S. 236, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 49 L.Ed.2d\n466 (1976); see also Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 220, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990). SVPs\ndiffer from prisoners in at least one important respect: an individual who has been designated an SVP has been\nfound, under California law, to have \"a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health\nand safety of others.\" Cal. Welf. & Inst.Code § 6600(a)(1). Once a jury designates someone an SVP, California\nlaw requires that the SVP be provided \"treatment for his or her diagnosed mental disorder.\" Id. § 6606(a).\nMoreover, the SVP commitment statute gives the Department of Mental Health Services the authority to forcibly\n[13]\nmedicate an SVP for purposes of treatment. Id. § 6606(b).\nThe five-phase treatment program at Atascadero must be \"consistent with current institutional standards for the\ntreatment of sex offenders, and . . . based on a structured treatment protocol developed by the State Department\nof Mental Health.\" Id. § 6606(c). Its purpose, and the purpose of the attendant changes in privileges, access\nlevel, and classification under its protocols, is not punishment, but treatment in preparation for the SVP's eventual\nrelease.\nAccordingly, the Plaintiffs cannot have an expectation to be free of such treatment under state SVP law. The\ncomplained-of actions are, at least facially, part of the treatment plan Atascadero is legally required to provide to\npersons that the state has deemed mentally ill. Given this relevant difference between SVPs and prisoners, we\ncannot say that the procedural protections provided to prisoners as they relate to forced medication and forced\ntreatment clearly apply to SVPs.\nMoreover, there are numerous procedural safeguards afforded to an individual facing an action for civil\ncommitment. Proceedings to designate a person an SVP are initiated only after a finding by two practicing\npsychologists or psychiatrists that the individual has a \"mental disorder\" such that he is likely to re-offend unless\nhe receives \"appropriate treatment and custody.\" See id. § 6601(d)-(f). Persons in SVP proceedings have the\nright to counsel, the right to consult experts, the right to have the state prove their SVP status beyond a\n996 reasonable doubt, and the right to a *996 unanimous jury verdict. See id. §§ 6603-04.\nIn addition, after initial designation, an SVP is given periodic opportunities to challenge his continued need for\ntreatment. See id. §§ 6605, 6608. Thus, SVPs are not subjected to Atascadero's treatment program without\ncertain procedural protections, nor are they relegated to indefinite treatment without the ability to seek judicial\nintervention.\nThe Plaintiffs may have liberty interests akin to those possessed by prisoners in this context, and thus may have\nthe right to further procedural protections within the walls of Atascadero. But such rights are not yet clearly\nestablished. Because the Plaintiffs have been designated as mentally ill and in need of treatment, a reasonable\nstate official would have reason to believe that the law applicable to the treatment and medication of prisoners did\n\nnot apply to SVPs. We therefore hold that Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity in regards to Plaintiffs'\nprocedural due process claims. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's holding as to the Plaintiffs' sixth cause\nof action.\n6. Fourteenth Amendment Substantive Due Process Claims\nThe Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants have violated their substantive due process rights by failing to protect\nthem from the abuse of other detainees and employees. The Plaintiffs' claims can be broken down into three\ngeneral categories: (a) claims that the Defendants failed to protect the Plaintiffs from the abuses of other persons\ndetained at Atascadero; (b) claims that the Defendants failed to provide constitutionally adequate conditions of\n[14]\ndetention; and (c) claims that the Defendants use excessive force against them.\nFirst, the Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants have turned a blind eye to the conduct of other persons detained at\nAtascadero State Hospital. Specifically, the Plaintiffs allege that they are intentionally exposed to feces, urine,\nvomit, spit, and blood in Atascadero's courtyards, bathrooms, hallways, dining rooms, and gymnasium, and that\nother detainees contaminate their food with spit and other unsanitary taint. The Plaintiffs allege that they are\nsubjected to verbal harassment, physical abuse, and sexual assaults by other patients at the Hospital. They\ncontend that they are targeted because they are sex offenders.\nThe patient population at Atascadero State Hospital comprises males who are civilly and penally committed. The\nindividuals committed at the Hospital are confined under a variety of statutes. See Cal.Penal Code § 1026\n(covering patients \"not guilty by reason of insanity\"); Cal.Penal Code § 1370 (covering patients \"incompetent to\nstand trial\"); Cal.Penal Code §§ 2962, 2964 (covering \"mentally disordered offenders\" serving their parole time);\nCal. Welf. & Inst.Code § 6316 (covering \"mentally disordered sex offenders\"); Cal.Penal Code § 2684 (covering\nmentally ill prisoners transferred to Atascadero State Hospital for psychiatric stabilization). According to the\nPlaintiffs, their forced integration as openly labeled \"sexually violent predators\" subjects them to verbal\nharassment, physical abuse, and sexual assaults from the rest of the Atascadero population.\nThe Plaintiffs' right to be protected and confined in a safe institution are clearly established. See Youngberg, 457\n997 U.S. at 319-22, 102 S.Ct. 2452 (stating that individuals who are involuntarily civilly committed *997 have\nconstitutionally protected rights under the due process clause to reasonably safe conditions of confinement and\nfreedom from unreasonable bodily restraints). The right is clearly established for civilly committed persons and\nprisoners alike. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); Neely v.\nFeinstein, 50 F.3d 1502, 1508 (9th Cir.1995) (finding \"clearly established\" that patients have a \"constitutional right\nto be safe in the state institutions to which they are committed\"). Assuming the Plaintiffs can prove the allegations\nin their complaint and the Defendants' blindness to such conditions in Atascadero, qualified immunity would not\nbe appropriate on these claims.\nSecond, the Plaintiffs allege that the conditions of confinement are constitutionally inadequate 00 that they are\n97\nforced to live in squalid conditions that are inhumane and pose a serious health risk. The Plaintiffs have a clearly\nestablished right not to be exposed to such unsanitary conditions. See Anderson v. County of Kern, 45 F.3d 1310,\n1314-15 (9th Cir.1995) (collecting cases in prison context); Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16, 102 S.Ct. 2452\n[15]\n(establishing a right to \"personal security\" for involuntarily committed persons).  Given the Plaintiffs'\nallegations, their claims as to the unsanitary and unsafe conditions of confinement cannot be dismissed under\nRule 12(b)(6).\nThe Plaintiffs also allege several claims of excessive force, e.g., (a) that \"red light alarms\" are used when the\nPlaintiffs refuse to participate in treatment, even when persons pose no threat of physical violence; (b) that\nshackles are used during transportation and during visits with family and friends; and, more generally, (c) that\nPlaintiffs are subjected to \"excessive punishment . . . [and] excessive use of force and physical restraints.\" It is\nwell-established that detained persons have a right to be free from excessive force. While excessive force claims\nby prisoners are reviewed under the Eighth Amendment's malicious and sadistic standard, Hudson v. McMillian,\n503 U.S. 1, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992), the more generous Fourteenth Amendment standard applies\nto those who are civilly confined. As we previously stated:\n\nIf confinement of a sexually violent predator is civil for the purposes of evaluation under the Ex\nPost Facto clause, that confinement is civil for the purposes of defining the rights to which the\ndetainee is entitled while confined [in a treatment facility]. Civil status means civil status, with all\nthe Fourteenth Amendment rights that accompany it.\nJones, 393 F.3d at 933.\nThe Fourteenth Amendment requires that civilly committed persons not be subjected to conditions that amount to\npunishment, Bell, 441 U.S. at 536, 99 S.Ct. 1861, within the bounds of professional discretion, Youngberg, 457\nU.S. at 321-22, 102 S.Ct. 2452. Moreover, \"due process requires that the conditions and duration of confinement\n[for civilly confined persons] bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which persons are committed.\" \nSeling, 531 U.S. at 265, 121 S.Ct. 727; see also Jones, 393 F.3d at 931. While the nature of an SVP's\nconfinement may factor in this balance of what is reasonable, it is clearly established that the substantive due\nprocess protections of the Fourteenth Amendment apply to SVPs. See Andrews, 253 F.3d at 1061 (applying the\n998 Fourteenth *998 Amendment's \"objective reasonableness\" standard to excessive force claims brought by civilly\n[16]\ncommitted SVPs).\nWe also reiterate that SVPs must, at a minimum, be afforded the rights afforded prisoners confined in a penal\ninstitution. Thus, the Eighth Amendment still provides a floor for the level of protection that SVPs must receive\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, and because the contours of the Eighth Amendment are more defined, Eighth\nAmendment jurisprudence may provide helpful guidance as to the standards to be applied. Under the Eighth\nAmendment, the unnecessary and wanton force standard takes into account such facts as the need for the\napplication of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force used, the threat perceived by the\nofficer, any effort to temper the severity of the forceful response, and the extent of the injury inflicted, and whether\nthe force was applied for a legitimate purpose. See Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117\nL.Ed.2d 156 (1992). If plaintiffs allege conduct that sinks below protections afforded prisoners under the Eighth\nAmendment, their claim certainly states a violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe Plaintiffs allege that force is used in retaliation for exercising legitimate rights and that the amount of force\nused is often a gross overreaction to the situation. Such use of force, if proved, is not reasonable and failure to\ncurtail such abuses cannot be said to be within the Defendants' professional discretion. Therefore, we affirm the\ndistrict court's denial of the motion to dismiss on these grounds.\nOn each of these three grounds 00 failure to protect, inadequate conditions of confinement, and excessive force\n97\n00 the Plaintiffs may be able to state a \"clearly established\" Fourteenth Amendment Substantive Due Process\n97\nviolation, and we cannot, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, dismiss these substantive due process claims.\n7. Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Claims\nAccording to the Plaintiffs, they are being treated more restrictively than other civilly committed patients. They\nallege that their conditions are more punitive than those under which all other civilly committed persons are held.\nFor one example, they allege that other civilly-committed persons are given priority in hiring for remunerative\npositions.\nEven though the Plaintiffs do not constitute a suspect class, heightened scrutiny may be required where\nfundamental interests are at issue. See Harper v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 670, 86 S.Ct. 1079,\n16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966); Police Dep't of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972).\nThis court upheld application of a \"heightened scrutiny standard\" when evaluating an equal protection violation\nunder Washington State's Sexually Violent Predator Statute. See Young v. Weston, 176 F.3d 1196, 1201 (9th\nCir.1999),rev'd on other grounds, Seling, 531 U.S. 250, 121 S.Ct. 727, 148 L.Ed.2d 734. While Young was\ndecided in 1999, it rested on a firmly established principle in existence at the time of events in question: that\n999 heightened scrutiny will be applied where a fundamental *999 liberty interest is at stake. See Skinner v.\nOklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942). The Plaintiffs may be able to claim violations\nof several clearly established fundamental rights: a liberty interest in freedom from bodily restraint and personal\nsecurity, Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-316, 102 S.Ct. 2452, and a fundamental right to access the courts, as\n\ndescribed below. Accordingly, heightened scrutiny is the standard for equal protection claims implicating these\nfundamental rights. And the Plaintiffs, in line with their allegations, may be able to show that the differential\ntreatment between themselves and other civilly committed persons violates equal protection because such\ntreatment does not meet heightened scrutiny.\nAt the same time, we cannot say that it is firmly established that every condition of an SVP's confinement is\nsubject to heightened scrutiny. In the prison setting, we have made clear that prison officials need latitude in\ndeciding how to run prisons, and we have refused to subject each classification drawn by prison officials to\nheightened scrutiny. Rather, a prisoner cannot challenge the conditions of his confinement on equal protection\ngrounds unless the discrimination against him is irrational or arbitrary. See McGinnis v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263,\n276, 93 S.Ct. 1055, 35 L.Ed.2d 282 (1973). That is, in so far as the Plaintiffs' claims rely on classifications not\nrelated to fundamental liberty interests, the Defendants will have qualified immunity unless there is no rational\nbasis for the classification.\nEven under the rational basis standard, we cannot dismiss the Plaintiffs' equal protection claims at this stage.\nThe Plaintiffs' pleadings raise several questionable classifications. For example, it seems arbitrary that SVPs\nshould be treated more harshly than other civilly committed persons in job placement and privileges. Based on\nthe pleadings, the Plaintiffs may be able to prove a violation of clearly established law congruent with the facts\nalleged. Admittedly, at this stage, the Defendants have not fully developed and presented the rationale for their\nactions and there may be differences between SVPs and other civilly committed persons that warrant differential\ntreatment. But we leave it to the district court, on a fuller factual record, to consider whether the classifications are\nirrational and arbitrary.\n8. Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel and Fourteenth Amendment Right of Access to Courts\nThe Plaintiffs claim that they cannot privately correspond with counsel, have telephone conversations with\ncounsel, and are otherwise hindered in their ability to prepare for their probable cause and commitment hearings.\nPlaintiffs have a statutory right to counsel in probable cause proceedings and in commitment hearings. Cal. Welf.\n& Inst.Code §§ 6602, 6603, 6605(d). To protect the right to counsel, \"a [detainee] must be given a reasonable\nopportunity to employ and consult with counsel; otherwise, the right to be heard by counsel would be of little\nworth.\" Chandler v. Fretag, 348 U.S. 3, 10, 75 S.Ct. 1, 99 L.Ed. 4 (1954). While the Sixth Amendment, by its\nexpress language, protects those in criminal proceedings, the Fourteenth Amendment protects all detainees\nagainst governmental interference in their right of access to courts. See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396,\n419-20, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) (overruled on other grounds); Cornett v. Donovan, 51 F.3d 894,\n897 & n. 4 (9th Cir.1995). The right of access to courts has been found to encompass the right to talk in person\n1000 and on the telephone with counsel in confidential settings, Procunier, 416 U.S. at 419, 94 *1000 S.Ct. 1800; \nChing v. Lewis, 895 F.2d 608, 609 (9th Cir.1990), and to use available law library resources, Keenan v. Hall, 83\nF.3d 1083 (1996), subject to legitimate restrictions related to the purpose and circumstances of detention, see \nTurner, 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254. Where such rights have been upheld in the prison context, SVPs must be\nafforded rights at least as broad.\nSuch a fact specific inquiry can hardly be undertaken at this point, when it is not clear what the Defendants have\ndone to impede access to the courts, or why they have done so, or how the Defendants' actions have affected\nthe Plaintiffs' right of access. Nonetheless, the Plaintiffs may be able to state a violation of clearly established law\ncongruent with their allegations, and we affirm the district court's order denying Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion\nto dismiss as to Plaintiffs' Tenth claim based on access to courts.\n9. Right to Privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment\nThe Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants' policies do not allow for privacy when showering, sleeping, using the\ntoilets, or participating in therapy sessions. It is clearly established that the Fourteenth Amendment protects a\nsphere of privacy, and the most \"basic subject of privacy . . . the naked body.\" Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d\n491, 494 (9th Cir. 1985). While the circumstances of institutional life demand that privacy be limited, it is clearly\nestablished that gratuitous invasions of privacy violate the Fourteenth Amendment. See id. Again, this calls for a\nhighly factual inquiry where the facts are not fully developed. In Grummett, for example, we considered the\n\ngender of those prison officials who viewed inmates, the angle and duration of viewing, and the steps the prison\nhad taken to minimize invasions of privacy. See id. at 494-95. Such facts are simply not available to us at this\n[17]\nstage of proceedings.  Nonetheless, the Plaintiffs may be able to state a violation of clearly established law\ncongruent with their allegations, and as such we will not dismiss their claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n* * *\nIn sum, we affirm the district court's decision to deny qualified immunity on the Plaintiffs' first, second, seventh,\neighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action to the extent noted above. We reverse in part and hold that the\nDefendants have qualified immunity from suit on the Plaintiffs' Ex Post Facto, Double Jeopardy, Procedural Due\nProcess, and Eighth Amendment claims.\nF. The Defendants' Belief That Their Conduct Was Lawful Was Not Objectively Reasonable\nEven if the Plaintiffs have alleged violations of a clearly established right, a government official is entitled to\nqualified immunity if he or she \"could . . . have reasonably but mistakenly believed that his or her conduct did not\nviolate a clearly established constitutional right.\" Jackson v. City of Bremerton, 268 F.3d 646, 651 (9th Cir.2001); \nsee also Alford v. Haner, 333 F.3d 972, 977 (9th Cir.2003). This is a limited exception, however: if the law is\nclearly established, the immunity defense \"ordinarily should fail, since a reasonably competent public official\n1001 should know the law governing [the official's] conduct.\" *1001Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102\nS.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).\nWhether the Defendants' conduct was reasonable involves a factual analysis of the circumstances surrounding\nDefendants' actions and a determination of whether a reasonable official similarly situated would have been\naware that his/her actions violated the law, an inquiry difficult to conduct at this stage. Based on the facts in front\nof us, however, we do not believe Defendants can claim that their conduct was objectively reasonable. The\nDefendants argue that the volatile nature of the law surrounding SVPs entitles them to escape liability entirely.\nWe do not adhere to the theory that \"every dog is entitled to one bite.\" The Defendants could not have been so\ncompletely unaware of the standards that would apply to their conduct as it related to SVPs. As explained above,\nSVPs are not entirely dissimilar from other groups of civilly committed persons. Moreover, the Plaintiffs' complaint\nalleges practices that would be unconstitutional if directed at any prisoner. Accordingly, Defendants cannot\nescape liability based on a \"reasonable but mistaken\" belief about the constitutionality of their conduct.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM in part and REVERSE in part the district court's order denying the\nDefendants' second motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). Each side to bear its own costs.\nTROTT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\nI\nMy disagreement with my colleagues is limited to one critical issue. We agree that plaintiffs cannot seek\ndamages in this lawsuit against state officials in their official capacities, and that plaintiffs cannot seek damages\nfrom the State either. So, what is left where the officials are concerned? A lawsuit against them personally for acts\nand omissions alleged to have been taken in the discharge of their official duties. It is here that I part company.\nThe issues raised by these plaintiffs are certainly important and require our attention, but the issues can be\nthoroughly litigated and authoritatively decided without involving the state officials as individuals. Requiring these\nindividuals to participate in their individual capacities not only is unnecessary, but to render them personally liable\nfor damages contravenes the very purpose of the doctrine of qualified immunity as explained by the Supreme\nCourt:\n\n[P]ermitting damages suits against government officials can entail substantive social costs,\nincluding the risk that fear of personal monetary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit\nofficials in the discharge of their duties.\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). Accordingly, the Court has\nheld that officials are immune unless \"the law clearly proscribed the actions\" they took, Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472\nU.S. 511, 528, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); and that the unlawfulness must be apparent in the light of\npreexisting law. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 344-45, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).\nOn this record, and under these circumstances, I conclude, with all respect to my colleagues, that these officials\nas individuals are entitled to qualified immunity against both suit and damages 00 now, not later. In my view, the\n97\nparticulars and the contours of the alleged constitutional rights upon which the plaintiffs rely were not so clearly\nestablished at the times under scrutiny and at the level of specificity required such that a reasonable official hired\n1002 by the state to cope pursuant to statutory authority with lawfully confined *1002 sexually violent predators subject\nto remedial treatment would have been aware that the conduct alleged violated federal constitutional bounds.\nGiven the unsettled nature of the law in this area, a reasonable official could certainly have believed otherwise.\nWe decide this appeal with clear analytical guidance from the Supreme Court:\nSomewhat more concretely, whether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held\npersonally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on the \"objective legal\nreasonableness\" of the action, assessed in light of the legal rules that were \"clearly established\" at\nthe time it was taken.\nThe operation of this standard, however, depends substantially upon the level of generality at\nwhich the relevant \"legal rule\" is to be identified. For example, the right to due process of law is\nquite clearly established by the Due Process Clause, and thus there is a sense in which any\naction that violates that Clause (no matter how unclear it may be that the particular action is a\nviolation) violates a clearly established right. Much the same could be said of any other\nconstitutional or statutory violation. But if the test of \"clearly established law\" were to be applied at\nthis level of generality, it would bear no relationship to the \"objective legal reasonableness\" that is\nthe touchstone of Harlow. Plaintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity that our\ncases plainly establish into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of\nextremely abstract rights. Harlow would be transformed from a guarantee of immunity into a rule\nof pleading. Such an approach, in sum, would destroy \"the balance that our cases strike between\nthe interests in vindication of citizens' constitutional rights and in public officials' effective\nperformance of their duties,\" by making it impossible for officials \"reasonably [to] anticipate when\ntheir conduct may give rise to liability for damages.\" It should not be surprising, therefore, that our\ncases establish that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been \"clearly\nestablished\" in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The contours of the right\nmust be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates\nthat right. This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very\naction in question has previously been held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing\nlaw the unlawfulness must be apparent.\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (emphasis added)\n(alteration in original) (internal citations omitted).\nAs my colleagues acknowledge, \"this suit is unique, in that it is one of the first widespread class actions to\nchallenge the conditions of detention for civilly confined SVPs.\" It is not only unique, but it requires us to answer\nquestions never before squarely addressed in this context. This factor alone should be enough to entitle these\nindividual defendants to dismissal.\nMy colleagues rely on Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 322, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982) for the\nproposition that \"civilly detained persons must be afforded `more considerate treatment and conditions of\nconfinement than criminals whose conditions of confinement are designed to punish.'\" This is an unremarkable\n\nquote used out of context, but it gets us nowhere in pursuit of an answer to the central question of whether we\nhave in this lawsuit violations of clearly established rights. Why? Because Youngberg dealt with the passive\n1003 confinement for their own good of mentally defective persons. In contrast, *1003 and as recently recognized by\nthe Supreme Court, sexually violent predators are confined in order to protect \"the public from dangerous\nindividuals with treatable as well as untreatable conditions.\" Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 262, 121 S.Ct. 727,\n148 L.Ed.2d 734 (2001). In addition, the Seling Court said that the case before it for decision \"gives us no\noccasion to consider how the civil nature of a confinement scheme relates to other constitutional challenges,\nsuch as due process. . . .\" Id. at 266, 121 S.Ct. 727. It is little wonder, therefore, that my colleagues admit in\nconnection with Youngberg that \"it is not always clearly established how much more expansive the right of civilly\ndetained persons are than those of criminally detained persons.\" I disagree with my colleagues' claim that \"[i]t\nfollows logically[from Youngberg], then, that the rights afforded prisoners set a floor for those [rights] that must be\nafforded SVPs, and that where Defendants violate a standard that is clearly established in the prison context, the\nviolation is clearly established under the SVP scheme[.]\" Certainly this \"logic\" based assertion is not a proposition\nclearly established and controlling at the time relevant to this lawsuit. Saying that rights follow logically from one\narea to another is an admission that those rights have not yet been clearly established in the area to which they\nare being transported. Prisoners have constitutional rights flowing from certain constitutional guarantees that do \nnot apply out of the criminal context. Which clearly established \"prisoner rights\" are they talking about? I cannot\nfind my colleagues' bold assertion anywhere in any case before this one. Where is the required level of specificity\nrequired to hold these individuals personally responsible for their acts? It is nowhere to be found. Where is the\nfair warning to them as to the constitutional limits of their compulsory treatment programs? Expanding and\nextending some rights from other contexts and extrapolating others defies the salutary purpose of the doctrine of\nqualified immunity.\nMy colleagues concede that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the plaintiffs'\nprocedural due process claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. Why? Because these plaintiffs are markedly\ndifferent than prisoners. The plaintiffs are subject to a program mandated by state law requiring that they be\ntreated for their diagnosed mental disorders, treatment which includes forcible medication and is subject to\n\"numerous procedural safeguards.\" The critical distinction recognized by my colleagues 00 in my view 00 should\n97 97\ncarry over to all claims made by these plaintiffs, not just the claim to which it is selectively applied.\nI find more than significant the relative newness of the civil commitment procedure at issue in this case.\nCalifornia's Sexually Violent Predator Act was enacted in 1995. The constitutionality of this concept was not\nupheld until 1997, see Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997); and\nCalifornia's own courts did not begin definitively to iron out controversial statutory issues of treatment 00 such as\n97\ninvoluntary medication without a separate court order 00 until 2004. See In re Calhoun, 121 Cal.App.4th 1315, 18\n97\nCal.Rptr.3d 315 (2004). When did the acts complained of here occur? 1998, in the midst of grappling by appellate\ncourts with this new modality and two years before Seling. In fact, the courts have yet to clarify if and how the\nConstitution protects sexually violent predators from various confinement and treatment modalities. Context is\ncritical to the determination of whether a constitutional right has been established. The Supreme Court confirmed\nthis principle in Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990), a lawsuit filed by a\n1004 mentally ill *1004 state prisoner complaining against treatment with anti-psychotic drugs against his will and\nwithout a judicial hearing. In holding that such treatment did not violate either substantive or procedural due\nprocess, the Court said, \"The extent of a prisoner's right under the Clause to avoid the unwanted administration\nof antipsychotic drugs must be defined in the context of the inmate's confinement.\" Id. at 222, 110 S.Ct. 1028.\nWe read the same message in Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 608, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979): \"What\nprocess is constitutionally due cannot be divorced from the nature of the ultimate decision that is being made.\" \nSee also Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (\"[D]ue process is\nflexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\").\nNoteworthy in Washington v. Harper was a correct holding by the Washington Supreme Court that the individual\ndefendants were entitled to qualified immunity. 494 U.S. at 218 n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1028. The case was allowed to\nproceed, but only to consider claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under § 1983 as well as state law 00\n97\nwhich is precisely what should happen here. It seems that we are now requiring doctors and other staff to consult\n\nnot just with lawyers before they devise a procedure or treatment for a sexually violent predator, but with the\ncourts.\nThe Supreme Court warned against this result in Parham, saying, \"Due process has never been thought to\nrequire that the neutral and detached trier of fact be law trained or a judicial or administrative officer. Surely, this\nis the case as to medical decisions, for neither judges nor administrative hearing officers are better qualified than\npsychiatrists to render psychiatric judgments. . . . The mode and procedure of medical diagnostic procedures is\nnot the business of judges.\" 442 U.S. at 607-08, 99 S.Ct. 2493 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\nThe penalty for not anticipating a court ruling will be individual liability. This unfortunate situation is precisely what\nthe doctrine of qualified immunity is designed to avoid.\nII\nIt would appear that my colleagues' approach to this case is at irreconcilable odds with cases from at least four\nother Circuits, the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Eleventh.\nIn Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701 (1st Cir.1993), a panel including Stephen Breyer, now\nJustice Breyer, observed that claims against government officials for money damages cannot proceed unless\npredicated upon \"clearly established\" statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nbeen aware. Id. at 704. In affirming a grant of summary judgment against the plaintiffs on the ground that the law\nrelied upon by them was not yet settled at the time of the actions in question, the Court observed that \"[t]he\ndetermination is time-critical.\" Id. In other words, no individual can be held personally liable for violating a law that\nhas not yet become particularized, which means fixed in connection with a precise context. First the clearly\nestablished law, then 00 and only then 00 potential personal monetary liability for public officials. Due process\n97 97\nalone would seem to require such a sequence. As the Sixth Circuit explained in McCloud v. Testa, 97 F.3d 1536,\n1541 (6th Cir.1996),\nthe ultimate burden of proof in this suit is on the plaintiffs, who must establish that Testa's conduct\n[as a public official] violated a federal right so clearly established that any official in his position\n1005 would have understood that he was under *1005 an affirmative duty to refrain from such conduct.\nThe court went on to indicate that \"individual capacity defendants in § 1983 cases receive some benefit from\nlegal doubt about the clarity of existing law.\" Id. at 1542. The Eleventh Circuit would agree with this proposition,\nremarking that \"`[i]f case law, in factual terms, has not staked out a bright line, qualified immunity almost always\nprotects the defendant.'\" Smith v. Mattox, 127 F.3d 1416, 1419 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting Kelly v. Curtis, 21 F.3d\n1544, 1550 (11th Cir.1994)) (alteration in original). Relying on one of our cases, Lum v. Jensen, 876 F.2d 1385,\n1389 (9th Cir.1989), the Fourth Circuit remarked that public officials \"`are not required to predict the future course\nof constitutional law'\"; and that \"[r]arely will a state official who simply enforces a presumptively valid state statute\nlose her immunity from suit.\" Swanson v. Powers, 937 F.2d 965, 968, 969 (4th Cir.1991). The court concluded\nwith this wise statement:\nThe ills that would result from allowing suits for damages against state officials who simply\nperform their official duties are evident. Suits such as these have the potential to threaten the\nfoundations of our most basic governmental functions-in this case, the collection of the revenue.\nBecause the plaintiffs' asserted rights were not clearly established and because Secretary Powers\nacted reasonably in enforcing presumptively valid state statutes, we hold that she is entitled to\nimmunity from suit. The judgment of the district court is therefore reversed.\nId. at 973.\nIn so far as my colleagues insist on borrowing principles from other contexts, they part company with the Sixth\nCircuit, which has held:\nWe may not impose personal liability upon state social workers because they failed to anticipate\nthat principles of law developed in other distinct contexts would be applied to them, for to do so\n\nwould be contrary to the admonition in Anderson v. Creighton, 107 S.Ct. at 3039, that we should\nnot allow plaintiffs to convert \"the rule of qualified immunity into a rule of virtually unqualified\nliability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.\"\nEugene D. v. Karman, 889 F.2d 701, 711 (6th Cir.1989) (emphasis added). See also Adams v. St. Lucie County\nSheriff's Dept., 962 F.2d 1563, 1575 (11th Cir.1992) (Edmonson, J., dissenting) (public officials not obligated to\ndraw analogies from other cases), rev'd en banc,998 F.2d 923, 923 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (adopting the\nreasoning of Judge Edmondson's dissent and reversing district court's denial of summary judgment to public\nofficial).\nIII\nI take issue also with my colleagues' assertion that because the facts are not yet developed, it is too early in this\nlawsuit to dismiss because of qualified immunity. This claim misses the mark. As held repeatedly by the Supreme\nCourt, qualified immunity is immunity from being sued, not just from damages. This principle explains (1) why the\nCourt warned in Anderson against non-specific pleadings that allege violations of \"extremely abstract rights,\" 483\nU.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034; and (2) the Court's holding in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806,\n86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) that \"[u]nless the plaintiff's allegations state a claim of violation of clearly established law,\na defendant pleading qualified immunity is entitled to dismissal before the commencement of discovery.\" The\nCourt revisited this issue again in Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). In\nthe course of overruling a mistaken opinion by the First Circuit, the Court said,\n1006 *1006 The source of the First Circuit's confusion was its mistaken conception of the scope of\nprotection afforded by qualified immunity. Harlow and Mitchell make clear that the defense is\nmeant to give government officials a right, not merely to avoid \"standing trial,\" but also to avoid the\nburdens of \"such pretrial matters as discovery . . ., as `[i]nquiries of this kind can be peculiarly\ndisruptive of effective government.'\"\nId. at 308, 116 S.Ct. 834 (quoting Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457\nU.S. 800, 817, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982))) (alterations in original). The Court, in reversing us in\n1991 on this very issue, said, \"[W]e repeatedly have stressed the importance of resolving immunity questions at\nthe earliest possible stage in litigation.\" Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589\n(1991). See also Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 598, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998) (\"[I]f the\ndefendant does plead the immunity defense, the district court should resolve that threshold question before\npermitting discovery.\"); Maraziti v. First Interstate Bank of California, 953 F.2d 520, 526 (9th Cir.1992) (discovery\nshould not be allowed until immunity has been decided).\nFinally, my colleagues express their intention \"not to eviscerate the notice pleading standard\" that our system\ngenerally uses to commence a lawsuit. I do not believe this caution is well suited to this context. Again, I reiterate\nthat the question of qualified immunity requires prompt resolution. Anderson seems to require pleadings more\nspecific than the usual \"notice\" standard. At the very least, pleadings against state officials in their individual\ncapacities must demonstrate an alleged violation of a particularized and relevant constitutional right which has\nbeen clearly established. Hunter v. Bryant also would seem to so require. To hold otherwise is to disserve a\ndoctrine that calls for resolution of the issue at the \"earliest possible stage\" in litigation. Hunter, 502 U.S. at 227,\n112 S.Ct. 534. As Justice Kennedy said in Siegert v. Gilley,\n[t]he heightened pleading standard is a departure from the usual pleading requirements of Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure 8 and 9(b), and departs also from the normal standard for summary\njudgment under Rule 56. But avoidance of disruptive discovery is one of the very purposes for the\nofficial immunity doctrine, and it is no answer to say that the plaintiff has not yet had the\nopportunity to engage in discovery. The substantive defense of immunity controls.\n500 U.S. 226, 236, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring). See also Schultea v.\nWood, 47 F.3d 1427, 1433 (5th Cir.1995) (\"When a public official pleads the affirmative defense of qualified\nimmunity in his answer, the district court may, on the official's motion or on its own, require the plaintiff to reply to\n\nthat defense in detail. . . . There is a powerful argument that the substantive right of qualified immunity supplants\nthe Federal Rules's scheme of pleading by short and plain statement.\"); Butler v. San Diego Dist. Attorney's\nOffice, 370 F.3d 956, 963-64 (9th Cir.2004).\nIV\nThe question remains, how specific must the right allegedly violated be defined in order to answer the question\nwhether it was clearly established? Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) gives\nus a good example of the degree of specificity required. In Wilson, the Court concluded first that officers who took\nmembers of the media into a homeowner's home to observe and to record the execution of an arrest warrant did\nso in clear violation of the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless, the Court concluded also that the officials who did\n1007 so were entitled *1007 to qualified immunity. The Court said that the appropriate question \"is . . . whether a\nreasonable officer could have believed that bringing members of the media into a home during the execution of\nan arrest warrant was lawful. . . .\" Wilson, 526 U.S. at 615, 119 S.Ct. 1692. Concluding that at the time of the\nviolation the law was \"at best undeveloped,\" the Court said, \"Given such an undeveloped state of the law, the\nofficers in this case cannot have been `expected to predict the future course of constitutional law.'\" Id. at 617, 119\nS.Ct. 1692 (quoting Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U.S. 555, 562, 98 S.Ct. 855, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978)).\nFrom these precedents, I conclude that the proper question in this case is whether it was clearly established at\nthe time of the events in this case that the Constitution prohibited persons in the position of these individual\nofficials from engaging in any of the behaviors attributed to them in connection with the management and\ntreatment of sexually violent predators civilly confined under state law for treatment and for the protection of the\npublic. After reviewing all the relevant cases and authorities, I answer this question in the negative.\nThe analytical error made by my colleagues becomes apparent when they say,\nThus, there are two bodies of law from which we might draw \"clearly established\" law for qualified\nimmunity purposes: first, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is clearly established\neven in the prison context, and second, where the SVPs claim a violation of a right that is clearly\nestablished for all civilly detained persons.\nWhat this acknowledges is that we cannot find any clearly established substantive rights in the SVP context, so\nwe have to borrow them from other areas. An approach like this certainly works well when the unanswered\nquestion is what constitutional rights might these sexually violent predators have in this system, but it fails utterly\nwhen the issue is whether we hold individuals personally liable ex post facto for their actions.\nThis lawsuit should proceed so that specific answers can be found to the constitutional questions raised by the\nplaintiffs, but it should proceed only in connection with possible declaratory or injunctive relief. To do otherwise\nwill deter government officials in the future from doing anything not to the liking of a sexually violent predator. The\npenalty for making a good faith mistake in an area of undeveloped law may be the costs of a lawsuit and the\npotential personal liability arising out of the official performance of a state job.\n[1] Although the SVP Act is gender-neutral, there was only one female SVP at the time of the filing of this\ncomplaint. She was not housed at Atascadero, and was, therefore, not part of the Plaintiffs' class.\n[2] Atascadero assigns everyone an access level that establishes access to various facilities and privileges. A\nLevel 1 patient may not leave his unit without an escort. A Level 2 patient may leave his unit but cannot go to the\ncourtyard or canteen. A Level 3 patient may have some access to the law library, canteen, courtyard, etc.\n[3] At oral argument it was alleged that, since the Plaintiffs filed their complaint, three (of over seven hundred)\npeople committed under the Sexually Violent Predators Act have been released.\n[4] The second amended complaint substituted Melvin Hunter, the current Executive Director at Atascadero State\nHospital, for Jon DeMorales, the former Executive Director, but contained no substantive alterations.\n\n[5] With respect to our dissenting colleague, the Plaintiffs' complaint states more than \"violations of extremely\nabstract rights.\" See Dissent at 10956 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97\nL.Ed.2d 523 (1987)). The Plaintiffs might be able to provide evidentiary support for their claims. Alternately, the\nDefendants might be able to justify their behavior, or at least convince us that their conduct was not clearly in\nviolation of the Plaintiffs' rights. But the point of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not to evaluate the veracity of the\nPlaintiffs' allegations, or to speculate as to the Defendants' justifications for their actions. Rather, unless it is\n\"beyond doubt\" that a plaintiff cannot prove facts that would entitle him to relief, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion must be\ndenied. Navarro v. Block, 250 F.3d 729 (9th Cir.2001). The standard is no different for a civil rights claim than for\nany other claim. See Galbraith, 307 F.3d at 1125-26.\n[6] The Defendants also suggest we should \"abstain\" under the Abstention Doctrine. The Defendants appear to\nconfuse abstention with denial of pendent jurisdiction under the \"novel and complex\" clause of 28 U.S.C. § 1367\n(c). If they meant abstention proper, they waived that argument by failing to raise it before the district court. See \nConn. Gen. Life Ins. v. New Images of Beverly Hills, 321 F.3d 878, 882 (9th Cir.2003). Nor do we see any reason\nto abstain in this situation. Pullman abstention is not appropriate because the driving force behind each of the\nPlaintiffs' claims is a right guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and state court clarification of state law\nwould not make a federal court ruling unnecessary. See R.R. Comm. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 499-501, 61\nS.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941).\n[7] Contrary to our dissenting colleague's analysis, we see this as a very minor analytical step. The State detains\nprisoners for the purpose of punishment. It detains SVPs for the purpose of treatment, and its treatment has no\npunitive element to it. It seems entirely unremarkable, then, to say that the State cannot treat SVPs worse than\nprisoners. The \"only reasonable conclusion from binding authority\" is that the conditions of confinement for SVPs\ncannot be more harsh than those under which prisoners are detained, except where the statute itself creates a\nrelevant difference. Blueford, 108 F.3d at 255.\n[8] We thus agree with our dissenting colleague that context is critical in constitutional claims. Nonetheless, this\nadmission 00 that it is not clear how much more extensive the rights of SVPs are 00 does not inexorably lead to the\n97 97\nconclusion that there can be no violation of clearly established law. It may not be clear exactly what due process\nrights are to be afforded SVPs, but surely it is clear that certain actions 00 forcing SVPs to live in squalid\n97\nconditions, turning a blind eye to physical attacks against SVPs, and forcing SVPs to take medication as\npunishment or in retaliation for filing a lawsuit or for refusing to speak during treatment sessions 00 transgress the\n97\nboundary. Surely it would not require \"law train[ing]\" or clairvoyance to recognize that these actions, as alleged by\nthe Plaintiffs, do no comport with due process.\n[9] The Plaintiffs' original pro se complaint contains particularly persuasive narratives on this issue. It details how\nAtascadero personnel responded when they learned of this suit, altering schedules so that the coordinators of\nthis action would not be able to work together, telling the Plaintiffs that their meeting in the library was an \"illegal\nassembly,\" limiting law library time, scheduling mandatory group sessions during the SVPs' library time, and\nrefusing to give SVPs drafting paper because it was \"only for the mental patients to draft appeals.\"\n[10] As explained in the complaint, a \"red light alarm\" is when ten to twenty staff members surround and restrain\nthe patient.\n[11] The excessive force claims under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment 00 e.g., forced medication,\n97\nexcessive use of red light alarms, and use of shackles 00 largely duplicate the Plaintiffs' excessive force claims\n97\nunder the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and their claims for Substantive Due Process. We consider all\nthese claims together below.\n[12]Seling did not, however, alter our authority to consider implementation of the SVP Act on the Plaintiffs' other\nclaims. See Seling, 531 U.S. at 266, 121 S.Ct. 727 (\"This case gives us no occasion to consider how the civil\nnature of a confinement scheme relates to other constitutional challenges, such as due process, or to consider\nthe extent to which a court may look to actual conditions of confinement and implementation of the statute to\ndetermine in the first instance whether a confinement scheme is civil in nature.\").\n[13] The Plaintiffs do not challenge California's SVP Act.\n\n[14] Here, we consider the Plaintiffs' substantive due process allegations from their Second, Fifth, and Seventh\ncauses of action.\n[15] In the prison context, claims of unsanitary conditions are evaluated under the Eighth Amendment. See \nAnderson, 45 F.3d at 1314. Although the Eighth Amendment does not apply here, similar standards may apply to\nSVPs under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Munoz v. Kolender, 208 F.Supp.2d 1125, 1146 (S.D.Cal.2002)\n[16] While Jones, Neer, and Seling are more recent cases, they do little more than restate the contours of law\nclearly established in Youngberg, a 1982 case, and Bell, a 1979 case. Seling essentially restates the Youngberg\ntest, and Jones does little more than connect the line between Youngberg and SVPs based on California's\nargument that the statute should be construed as a civil confinement statute. We believe a reasonable official\nreading Youngberg would have sufficient notice that they would be held to Youngberg's standards of due\nprocess.\n[17] Moreover, we note that it is not, as the Defendants hinted in their briefs, the burden of the SVPs to show that\nthere is no compelling justification for the regulations, but rather the burden of the State to show that there is such\na justification. See Walker v. Sumner, 917 F.2d 382, 385-87 (9th Cir.1990).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
