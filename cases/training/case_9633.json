          "description": "MINUTE entry before Honorable James F. Holderman: On June 23, 2010, this court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order [589] approving the Transitional Administrator's (\"TA\") proposed staffing plan for the Cook County JTDC as set forth in the TA's Second Report. Intervenor Teamsters Local 700 (the \"Union\") thereafter, on July 22, 2010, filed a notice of appeal [595] and, on September 8, 2010, filed a motion to stay [616] seeking to enjoin the TA from implementing his proposed staffing plan. This court denied the Union's motion to stay on November 3, 2010, agreeing with Plaintiffs that \"the TA almost certainly will be at the JTDC to grant relief' if the Seventh Circuit were to reverse this court's June 23, 2010 order. (See [625] at 3.) It has been almost thirty months since oral argument, and the Seventh Circuit has yet to decide the Union's appeal. (See generally App. Case No. 10-2746 (docket) (oral argument held February 17, 2011).) In the meantime, the TA has continued his efforts to bring the JTDC into compliance with the underlying consent decrees previously entered in this case. In his April 2013 report to this court [686], the TA has focused on the final steps necessary to facilitate the transition of the JTDC to the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County. This court is concerned, based on arguments presented by the Union nearly three years ago, that \"[i]f the Court of Appeals disapproves the requalification plan after the TA carries out these terminations and hands over control of the JTDC to the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County... the affected employees will have no remedy against the Chief Judge.\" ([617] at 2.) Counsel for all parties, including those representing the Union, are requested to attend the upcoming status hearing on 8/22/13 at 9:00 a.m. for purposes of addressing this procedural point.Notice mailed by judge's staff (ntf, )"

Judge Holderman also briefly attended Chief Judge Evans's stakeholders' meeting in his chambers' conference room where counsel of record were also present.

TA Dunlap agreed to be available to continue to assist in the transition upon Chief Judge Evans's request through the end Cook County's budget year, November 30, 2014, and, if necessary, into December 2014. This court concurs with, encourages, and orders the agreed-upon continuing cooperation in the transition process. The court thanks Chief Judge Evans, TA Dunlap, and counsel for the parties for their professionalism regarding this case and the transition process.

    "summary": "<p>On June 15, 1999, four juveniles detained at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs sued Cook County and the JTDC under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of their Fourteenth Amendment rights. Specifically, the complaint alleged gross mismanagement of the JTDC leading to overcrowding, unsafe and unsanitary facilities, inadequate medical, dental, and mental health care, physical violence and abuse by residents and staff, unfair discipline, and inadequate access to education. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, sought declaratory and injunctive relief. This case was assigned to Judge John Robert Blakey. </p><p>On December 22, 1999, the court certified a plaintiff class consisting of all persons who \"have been, are, or will be confined at the JTDC.\"</p><p>The parties spent several months negotiating the proposed resolution of this case under the supervision of Magistrate Judge Ashmann. On December 30, 2002, the parties’ settlement agreement was approved. Substantial compliance with the settlement agreement would be achieved when the defendants hired new management and additional staff, increased security, and developed an improved disciplinary protocol. Pursuant to the agreement, the court dismissed the action without prejudice. The court retained jurisdiction to enter any orders necessary to enforce or modify the agreement.  </p><p>On November 8, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a petition for the court to declare the defendants in violation of the settlement agreement and order them into substantial compliance with all its terms within six months. The plaintiffs contended that the defendants had a pattern of noncompliance with the settlement agreement and the JTDC remained in gross mismanagement. Particularly, the defendants never produced an adequate implementation plan to enforce the settlement agreement, failed to hire competent and experienced management, remained severely understaffed, failed to maintain adequate control and security within the JTDC, and continued using arbitrary and harsh disciplinary procedures. </p><p>The parties renegotiated the settlement. An agreed-upon supplemental order was approved on May 18, 2006. Its primary objective was to ensure the JTDC was in substantial compliance with the original settlement agreement within eight months. The parties agreed to heightened monitoring through a third party administrator and a curriculum of training and counseling for staff members engaging in egregious conduct. </p><p>On May 29, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion to appoint a receiver to ensure compliance with the original settlement agreement and the supplemental order. The plaintiffs claimed that the conditions of the JTDC were arguably worse than at the beginning of the lawsuit and that the County Board flagrantly and consistently violated the court's orders. The plaintiffs asserted that youth housed at JTDC had a high risk of suicide, received inadequate mental health and medical services, were regularly abused by staff and other residents, and were not provided with basic necessities. They further contended that staff were incompetent, and operated without adequate management or oversight.</p><p>On July 6, 2007, Teamster Local Union No. 714, the exclusive bargaining representative for JTDC employees, moved to intervene. The Union claimed that doing so was necessary to allow them to adequately consult with the parties over a possible settlement and to prepare for trial. </p><p>After Illinois enacted legislation transferring administration of the JTDC from the executive branch of Cook County to the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County (OCJ), the plaintiffs agreed to withdraw their motion to appoint a receiver. In exchange, on August 14, 2007, the court approved an agreed order appointing a transitional administrator (TA). The TA was tasked with achieving substantial compliance with the original settlement agreement and supplemental order. The TA was also required to regularly report to the court and apprise the parties of the current conditions at the JTDC and actions taken to bring the JTDC into substantial compliance. </p><p>On April 15, 2008, the TA filed an emergency motion for the court to allow them to waive County Ordinances related to the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Union and the JTDC. This would allow the TA to enter into a temporary security staffing contract to fix the critical shortage of security staff members at the JTDC. On the same day, the Union filed another motion to intervene in order to object to the TA’s emergency motion. The Union requested to intervene for the same reasons on a July 6, 2007 motion. Additionally, it alleged that the proposed emergency order pertained to a collective bargaining agreement and would affect its members. </p><p>The Union’s motion to intervene was granted on May 2, 2008. Three days later, the Union filed a memo opposing the TA’s emergency motion to contract security staffing. The Union stated that the TA never discussed staffing needs with the Union and their emergency order would affect JTDC employees’ seniority rights and their ability to choose their shift and days off and assigned units. Further, the Union claimed that the court lacked authority to grant the requested relief and the open-ended suspension of the County Ordinances was overly broad. </p><p>On May 8, 2008, the TA’s emergency motion to retain a private company to provide temporary security staffing at JTDC was granted. The court also suspended all local and state laws regarding the collective bargaining agreement between the defendants and the Union. The court made this decision after concluding that the situation at JTDC constituted an emergency since it was dangerously understaffed and posed a health and safety risk to its residents. On June 6, 2008, the Union appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit regarding the court’s decision to suspend local and state laws regarding unions. </p><p>On November 11, 2008, the TA submitted a report updating the court about staffing and contract services at JTDC. The report said that the TA had been contracted for temporary security services and there had been improvements in hiring, conditions, and operational culture at the JTDC. However, hiring qualified and permanent employees remained a challenge and there was still excessive absenteeism among security staff. </p><p>After the case was transferred to Judge James Holderman, the Union requested that their appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit be remanded. They did so because the court stated it would likely grant the Union’s motion to modify the appealed judgment. Specifically, the court stated that they were inclined to alter the court’s May 8, 2008 order to make it clear that laws and ordinances regarding the Collective Bargaining Agreement were not suspended. This motion was granted on January 27, 2009. </p><p>On March 12, 2009, the court entered an agreed order regarding the disputed firing of four employees as a result of their conduct towards children at the JTDC. The employees were given new positions that had no contact with any of the children. Failure to follow this order would result in a review by the Magistrate Judge. </p><p>On October 9, 2009, the TA submitted a second report apprising the parties of the status of JTDC’s staffing crisis. The report noted that the TA had hired dozens of new permanent employees, opened five new residential living centers, and established additional support services for staff. Changes had been made to ensure residents at the JTDC’s safety, including the addition of cameras and safe rooms. In order to comply with the Administrator Office of the Illinois Court’s (AOIC) rules regarding employment qualification, the report noted that all employees hired since August 2007 were required to have bachelor’s degrees. However, many employees hired before August 2007 did not and continued to work with the JTDC’s residents. To comply with the AOIC rules, the TA proposed creating new job descriptions for direct care workers at the JTDC thus requiring current direct care workers to “reapply” for these new positions, imposing the requirement that they have a bachelor’s degree.  </p><p>The Union objected to the TA’s proposal to change job descriptions and require Union members to reapply. On June 23, 2010, the court approved the TA’s proposed staffing plan. The court noted that the proposed plan did not exceed the scope of the TA’s mandate; the TA did not have a duty to engage in mandatory bargaining regarding the proposed requalification standards with the Union; and the proposed plan did not violate any due process rights and complied with the Prison Litigation Reform Act. 2010 WL 2610644. </p><p>On July 22, 2010, the Union appealed the court’s June 23, 2010 order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The Union specifically questioned the court allowing the TA to change job descriptions at the JTDC and therefore require current staff to reapply for positions. </p><p>On November 3, 2010, the court denied the Union’s motion for an injunction or stay of the proposed staffing order pending a ruling by the Seventh Circuit. The court held that any irreparable harm to Union members posed by the staffing plan was speculative, the public interest was in favor of implementing the proposed plan, and that the Union has not demonstrated a significant probability of success on appeal.  </p><p>While the Union’s appeal was pending, the TA continued to file reports apprising the court of the staffing plan’s status. The third report was submitted to the court on March 9, 2011; the fourth report on November 26, 2012; the fifth report on April 8, 2013; and the sixth report on January 10, 2014. In the sixth report, the TA stated that the JTDC was close to being in substantial compliance with the 2002 settlement agreement. The TA still had to complete several capital projects to provide upgraded infrastructure and resources to the JTDC, ensure a smooth transition of the JTDC to the OCJ, and prepare for an increase in the number of youth held at the JTDC after new Illinois legislation increased the age for juvenile-court jurisdiction from 17 to 18. </p><p>On May 15, 2015, the court entered a Concluding Order transferring administrative control of the JTDC from the TA to OCJ. </p><p>On August 17, 2015, five years after the Union initially appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the appellate court reversed the district court’s decision. The appellate court held that the district court’s approval of the TA’s staffing plan violated the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). Under the PLRA, relief that violates state law and is not “necessary” to solve a violation of federal law is forbidden. The appellate court held that the proposed order was forbidden since cutting the Union out of discussions regarding the JTDC’s staffing was not authorized by state law. However, the appellate court acknowledged that it would be impossible to restore the Union members to their old positions. Instead, the appellate court remanded the case to the district court to determine what other forms of relief, such as financial compensation or preferential hiring for future openings, would be appropriate. 798 F.3d 558. </p><p>Following remand, the parties began confidential settlement discussions. On April 14, 2016, the parties informed the court that all of their issues had been resolved. The court granted the parties agreed stipulation to dismiss on May 25, 2016. </p><p>This case is now closed.  </p>",

A class of juvenile prisoners requested injunctive relief. The case was settled in 2002, with the court retaining jurisdiction to enter orders. In 2007, the plaintiffs claimed that no changes had been made since the beginning of the lawsuit and that drastic measures were needed to ensure compliance with the ordered settlements.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, the court appointed a transitional administrator (TA) to oversee the implementation of the original settlement agreement. The TA found it necessary to substantively change the hiring and terminating practices of the JTDC, as well as educational and screening requirements, which caused friction with the local unions. The Union appealed the court's approval of the TA's staffing changes. Five years later, the Court of Appeals reversed the district court's decision to approve changes violating the Union's collective bargaining agreement. In April 2016, the parties reached a private settlement agreement. This case is now closed.",

(Plaintiffs’ \nstatus as juveniles justifies the anonymity in the case title.) \nEight years into the suit, which has been certified as a class \naction (so the fact that the representative plaintiffs are no \nlonger at the Center does not make the case moot), the dis-\ntrict court appointed Earl Dunlap as the Center’s “Transi-\ntional Administrator.” We call Dunlap “the Administrator.” \nThe court authorized the Administrator to run the Center \nin compliance with all state and federal requirements. The \nword “Transitional” in the Administrator’s title comes from \nthe fact that Illinois amended its law in 2007 to move man-\nagement of the Center from the domain of the County’s po-\nlitical branches to the domain of the Circuit Court of Cook \nCounty, in whose Chief Judge state law now vests authority. \n55 ILCS 75/3(b) (allowing the Chief Judge to appoint and \nremove an administrator to run the Center), 75/3(c) (giving \nthe Chief Judge direct control over the Center’s budget). The \nAdministrator was supposed to produce an orderly transi-\ntion from the old regime to the new one. \nThat  took  a  good  deal  longer  than  expected.  Section \n75/3(b) became effective on January 1, 2008, and required the \nChief Judge to appoint a new head of the Center within 180 \ndays, yet when this case was argued in 2011 the appointment \nhad yet to be made. We thought that the transition would \nhappen soon, and we deferred action in the belief that the \ndispute  might  soon  become  moot.  It  turned  out  that  the \nChief Judge waited until May 2015 to replace Dunlap: Leon-\nard Dixon was named as the Center’s new Superintendent \neffective May 20, 2015, and Dunlap left his post as Adminis-\ntrator. But this has not resolved the controversy that led to \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 3 of 23 PageID #:6347\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\nNo. 10-2746  3 \nthis appeal. So it is time for us to act—past time, really, and \nthe litigants have our apologies for the delay. \nOne reason why we thought it appropriate to set this ap-\npeal aside for a while is that the original parties were and \nremained content with the Administrator’s appointment and \nactions. The plaintiffs are satisfied, Cook County is satisfied, \nand the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court, though not a for-\nmal  party,  indicated  (through  a  supplemental  submission \nfiled at our request) that he too is satisfied. But employees at \nthe Center are not satisfied. Their Union (Teamsters Local \n700), which represents “direct-care employees” (called “Ju-\nvenile  Detention  Counselors”  and  “Recreation  Workers”), \nintervened in the district court and is the appellant. \nWe postpone a recitation of this litigation’s origination, \nsettlement, reactivation, re-settlement, and further protests \nby the class, which led the district judge to appoint the Ad-\nministrator as part of a third settlement. For now it is best to \nexplain what led the Union to intervene and appeal, and \nhow the district court dealt with the Union’s arguments. \nFollowing a study of the Center’s operations, the Admin-\nistrator proposed in October 2009 to reorganize it into five \ndivisions,  each  staffed  by  personnel  who  in  one  position \nserve the functions of guards, psychologists, and teachers, \nand who would have training and educational credentials \nsuperior to the staff then on hand. The Administrator pro-\nposed to terminate the employment of the Center’s approx-\nimately 225 direct-care employees and require any of them \nwho wanted to fill the new positions to apply on the same \nbasis as any outsider would do. The Administrator estimat-\ned that 180 of these 225 would be disqualified at the outset \nby the requirement that the workers have bachelor’s degrees, \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 4 of 23 PageID #:6348\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\n4  No. 10-2746 \nand more would be ruled out by a test that all applicants \nwould be required to pass. \nThe district court allowed the Union to intervene to op-\npose the Administrator’s plan. (The Union acts as agent of its \nmembers, who are vitally interested, and has standing in a \nrepresentative capacity.) The Union argued that implementa-\ntion of the plan would violate several Illinois statutes. Illinois \nrequires public employers to engage in collective bargaining \nwith unions, 5 ILCS 315/7, and it requires arbitration if an \nemployer of “security employees” cannot reach agreement \nwith their union, 5 ILCS 315/14. The Union contended that \nthe  Administrator  was  proposing  to  violate  state  law  by \noverriding the bargaining and arbitration statutes, and to \nviolate the Due Process Clause by overriding the current col-\nlective bargaining agreement. For simplicity we put this lat-\nter argument to one side; it is unnecessary to add a constitu-\ntional gloss to state-law rights. \nThe district court rejected the Union’s position and au-\nthorized the Administrator to implement his plan. 2010 U.S. \nDist.  LEXIS  63153  (N.D.  Ill.  June  23,  2010).  Citing  5  ILCS \n315/4, the judge wrote that collective-bargaining rights must \ngive way, as a matter of Illinois law, when necessary to effec-\ntive management. See Central City Education Association v. Il-\nlinois Educational Labor Relations Board, 149 Ill. 2d 496 (1992). \nThe judge did not, however, find that overriding the right to \nbargain was essential to solve any constitutional problem at \nthe Center. To the contrary, the judge conceded that “there \nhas been no judicial finding that ‘purging the [Center of in-\ncumbent workers] is necessary to correct’” any ongoing con-\nstitutional violation. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63153 at *19. In-\ndeed, the judge conceded that there has not been a finding \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 5 of 23 PageID #:6349\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\nNo. 10-2746  5 \nthat any resident of the Center “currently face[s] an ‘ongoing \ndanger  to  health  and  safety  [due  to]  unqualified  staff \nstay[ing]  in  their  current  positions’”  (ibid.;  emphasis  and \nbrackets in original). Nonetheless, the judge wrote, the Ad-\nministrator had been appointed to clean up a mess, and “the \ncourt finds that the [Administrator’s] need for speed and \nflexibility” (id. at *20) trumps other considerations. \nAddressing the Union’s argument that the Administra-\ntor’s hiring plan is blocked by 18 U.S.C. §3626, a part of the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), given the absence of a \nfinding that the new plan is necessary to cure an ongoing \nviolation of federal law, the district court had two responses: \nfirst, that Illinois law has not been violated, and second that \n§3626  applies  only  to  district  judges  and  not  to  court-\nappointed administrators. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63153 at *27–\n28. What the Administrator proposed to do, the court wrote, \nis not the kind of “prospective relief” forbidden to a judge. \nThe district court denied a motion for a stay, 2010 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 117086 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 3, 2010), as did a motions \npanel of this court, so by the time we heard oral argument \nthe new system was in place. The judge certified his order as \nfinal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b), see 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n86192 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 23, 2010), a step that everyone has ap-\nplauded given the difficulty of determining whether an or-\nder such as that approving the Administrator’s plan is one \nentering  (or  declining  to  modify)  an  “injunction”  for  the \npurpose of an appeal under 28 U.S.C. §1292(a). \nThe Union’s appeal rests largely on the PLRA. Here are \nthe pertinent parts of §3626: \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 6 of 23 PageID #:6350\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\n6  No. 10-2746 \n(a) REQUIREMENTS FOR RELIEF.— \n(1) PROSPECTIVE RELIEF.— \n(A) Prospective relief in any civil action with respect to \nprison conditions shall extend no further than neces-\nsary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a \nparticular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The court shall not \ngrant  or  approve  any  prospective  relief  unless  the \ncourt finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends \nno further than necessary to correct the violation of the \nFederal right, and is the least intrusive means neces-\nsary to correct the violation of the Federal right. The \ncourt shall give substantial weight to any adverse im-\npact on public safety or the operation of a criminal jus-\ntice system caused by the relief. \n(B) The court shall not order any prospective relief that \nrequires or permits a government official to exceed his \nor her authority under State or local law or otherwise \nviolates State or local law, unless— \n(i) Federal law requires such relief to be ordered in \nviolation of State or local law; \n(ii) the relief is necessary to correct the violation of \na Federal right; and \n(iii) no other relief will correct the violation of the \nFederal right. \n… \n(c) SETTLEMENTS.— \n(1) CONSENT DECREES.—In any civil action with respect \nto prison conditions, the court shall not enter or approve a \nconsent decree unless it complies with the limitations on re-\nlief set forth in subsection (a). \n(2) PRIVATE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.— \n(A) Nothing in this section shall preclude parties from \nentering into a private settlement agreement that does \nnot comply with the limitations on relief set forth in \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 7 of 23 PageID #:6351\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\nNo. 10-2746  7 \nsubsection (a), if the terms of that agreement are not \nsubject to court enforcement other than the reinstate-\nment of the civil proceeding that the agreement set-\ntled. \n… \n(g) DEFINITIONS.—As used in this section— \n(1) the term “consent decree” means any relief entered by \nthe court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent \nor acquiescence of the parties but does not include private \nsettlements; … \n(6)  the  term  “private  settlement  agreement”  means  an \nagreement entered into among the parties that is not subject \nto judicial enforcement other than the reinstatement of the \ncivil proceeding that the agreement settled; … \nThe Union’s argument is simple. Section 3626(a)(1)(A) and \n(B) forbids relief that violates state law and is not “neces-\nsary” to solve a violation of federal law—and even then state \nlaw may be overridden only if “no other relief will correct” \nthat violation. A private settlement agreement may do more, \nsee §3626(c)(2), but if an agreement is judicially enforcea-\nble—that is, if a violation means anything other than restart-\ning  the  litigation  on  the  merits—the  agreement  must  be \ntreated as a “consent decree,” and what a court cannot do by \nfinal order in a contested case it also cannot do by the par-\nties’ consent (that’s the effect of combining §3626(c)(1) and \n(2) with §3626(g)(1) and (6)). \nThe district judge was unimpressed by this argument be-\ncause, he said, it does not invariably violate Illinois law to \nallow management to proceed without collective bargaining. \nWe grant the point but don’t see how state law authorizes \ncutting this Union out of decisions about the Center’s staff-\ning. \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 8 of 23 PageID #:6352\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\n8  No. 10-2746 \nThe district court thought that bypassing bargaining (and \neliminating the arbitration that state law requires if the par-\nties can’t agree) would allow the Administrator to reorganize \nthe Center faster and more effectively. Yet every public em-\nployer could make that kind of argument, all of the time. \nThere has to be something more to bypass bargaining as a \nmatter of Illinois law; the delays and frustrations that nor-\nmally  accompany  collective  bargaining  do  not  permit  an \nemployer  to  dispense  with  the  process,  irksome  as  many \nemployers  find  it.  Illinois  courts,  and  its  Labor  Relations \nBoard, regularly reject arguments that a public employer’s \ndesire to change conditions of employment with dispatch \njustifies  disregard  of  bargaining  and  arbitration  require-\nments. See, e.g., Chicago Park District v. Illinois Labor Relations \nBoard, 354 Ill. App. 3d 595 (2004); Village of Bensenville, 14 \nPERI ¶2042, 1998 IL LRB LEXIS 43 (I.L.R.B. 1998); Cook County \n(Cermak Health Services), 3 PERI ¶3030, 1987 IL LRB LEXIS 78 \n(I.L.R.B. 1987). \nThe “something more” required by Illinois law could in \nprinciple be an ongoing violation of federal law, but the dis-\ntrict judge was commendably candid: he was not finding any \nongoing violation that the Administrator’s plan would fix \nand, indeed, had never found any violation of federal law \n(statutory or constitutional). (We’ll come back to the “never” \nobservation.) The judge found that giving speed and flexibil-\nity to the Administrator would be beneficial, but not that \nfederal law requires this, and not that every employer’s de-\nsire for flexibility trumps bargaining requirements in Illinois. \nIt follows that Illinois law required collective bargaining and \nheld out the possibility of interest arbitration. \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 9 of 23 PageID #:6353\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\nNo. 10-2746  9 \nEven if we were to treat the parties’ agreement as giving \nthe Administrator the power to do what he did, employers \ncannot “consent” to dispensing with employees’ rights. See \nKasper v. Board of Election Commissioners, 814 F.2d 332, rehear-\ning denied, 814 F.2d 345 (7th Cir. 1987) (parties can’t accom-\nplish through a consent decree something they lack ability to \ndo by contract). And under §3626(a)(1)(B) the parties, like \nthe court, must respect state law unless federal law leaves no \nother option. \nThe district court’s second way around the PLRA was its \nconclusion  that  the  judge  had  not  himself  required  any \nchange in the Center’s employment practices; all the court \nhad  done  was  to  approve  the  Administrator’s  proposals. \nThere are several problems with that approach. First, the \nAdministrator was exercising the court’s authority. Without \nthe court’s imprimatur, the Administrator has no authority at \nall. The court cannot give its appointee any greater power \nthan the judge himself possesses. If the judge is constrained \nby §3626, so is the Administrator. Second, §3626(a) says ex-\nactly this. It provides that a “court shall not grant or approve \nany prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief \nis narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to cor-\nrect the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intru-\nsive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal \nright.” (Emphasis added.) The court approved the Adminis-\ntrator’s directives, without making the statutory findings. \nSimple enforcement of a consent decree does not require \na new round of findings under §3626. See Jones-El v. Berge, \n374 F.3d 541, 545 (7th Cir. 2004). But the Administrator’s de-\ncision to fire all of the Center’s direct-care workers, and dis-\nplace state law, cannot be understood as simple enforcement \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 10 of 23 PageID #:6354\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\n10  No. 10-2746 \nof the order appointing the Administrator. That order, en-\ntered in 2007, did not displace state labor law or authorize \nany particular management practice. Not until 2010, when \nthe  district  court  approved  the  Administrator’s  proposal, \nwas state law superseded. (As we explain below, there was a \nbrief supersession in 2008, but the district court quickly re-\nvoked it.) The 2010 order therefore cannot be defended as \nnothing but implementation of the 2007 order appointing the \nAdministrator. \nThe dispute in Jones-El concerned an order to install air \nconditioning to enforce an earlier decree that had directed \nthe prison to reduce the temperature in prisoners’ cells. The \nprison objected to the new order, even though it also con-\nceded that air conditioning was the only way to comply with \nan earlier order whose validity was unquestioned. In our \ncase, by contrast, firing all of the direct-care workers and hir-\ning replacements, all without regard to state law, was not the \nonly way to comply. The district judge did not find that the \nAdministrator’s proposed approach was necessary either to \nrespect the class’s rights or to manage the Center (as the 2007 \norder authorized the Administrator to do); the judge found \nonly that it was efficient. The difference between a step nec-\nessarily entailed in implementing an earlier judicial order, \nand a selection from among many potential ways of pro-\nceeding, was important to Jones-El and to our decision today. \nBut if we accept the premise that in 2010 the district court \njust enforced an older consent order, that moves things one \nstep backward, to the 2007 order appointing the Administra-\ntor and setting out his tasks. And the district court did not \nsay that that order was compelled by any federal law. The \nmost one can say for the 2007 order is that the district judge \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 11 of 23 PageID #:6355\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\nNo. 10-2746  11 \nrecited that it complied with the PLRA. The judge did not, \nhowever, make any of the findings that §3626 requires. A \nbald  declaration  of  compliance,  without  the  findings  re-\nquired by statute, is ineffectual under §3626. \nIn defending the judgment, the original parties have ar-\ngued that the district judge didn’t need to make any findings \nin 2010 because he had made them earlier. As we have ob-\nserved, the judge himself was not of that view. He stated ex-\npressly that he was not finding that there was any ongoing \nviolation of federal law that needed correction and was not \nfinding that the Administrator’s new employment proposal \nwas necessary to correct any earlier violation. 2010 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 63153 at *19. But for the sake of completeness we take a \nbrief  look  at  this  litigation’s  history,  to  see  whether  the \njudge’s memory might have been deficient. \n The suit was filed in 1999, and the parties started negoti-\nating. The district court did not take any action on the merits \n(though  it  did  certify  a  class).  Settlement  was  reached  in \n2002, and in December of that year the district court dis-\nmissed the suit, reserving jurisdiction to enforce the settle-\nment’s terms. (This reservation made the settlement a “con-\nsent decree” as defined in §3626(g)(1), as opposed to a “pri-\nvate settlement agreement” under §3626(g)(6).) In dismissing \nthe suit, the judge did not make any finding that the Center \nhad violated any detainee’s rights or that any of the settle-\nment’s terms was necessary to remedy a violation. \nNor could either of these findings be inferred from the \nact of approving (and promising to enforce) the settlement, \nbecause  the  settlement  papers  themselves  state  that  the \nagreement is “the result of a compromise and settlement and \nis not a determination of liability.” The settlement contained \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 12 of 23 PageID #:6356\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\n12  No. 10-2746 \nstandard language denying liability. (For example: “Defend-\nants have denied and continue to deny the allegations con-\ntained in Plaintiffs’ Complaint”.) In other words, the defend-\nants did not confess liability, and there was no finding of lia-\nbility (or of the need for any given remedy) that the court \ncould adopt. What is more, the court could not have found \nthat a new employment arrangement at the Center was nec-\nessary to resolve any violation, because the possibility of a \nnew arrangement was not raised until 2009. \nBy late 2005 plaintiffs had grown dissatisfied with the \nCenter’s performance. They moved to reopen the case and \nenforce the settlement. Before the court could act, the parties \nreached  an  amended  settlement  and  an  implementation \nplan. The two new agreements, like the original, lack a con-\nfession  of  liability.  Unlike  the  2002  settlement,  the  2006 \nagreements dealt with employment and training by provid-\ning that the Center must reassign any employee found to \nhave physically abused any detainee, until the employee re-\nceives  additional  training.  The  Administrator’s  eventual \nproposal is substantially different from this clause, because it \nextends to all employees, whether or not any given employee \never abused any detainee, and whether or not that employee \nhas received additional training. \nIn May 2007 the plaintiffs returned to court, asking the \njudge to put the Center into receivership and appoint some-\none to run it. By then the state legislature was considering \nthe bill that would move the Center’s management to the \nCircuit Court of Cook County. This led to the idea for a \n“Transitional Administrator” to bridge the gap, and with the \nparties’  consent  (a  third  settlement)  the  district  court  ap-\npointed Dunlap to that position—but without making any \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 13 of 23 PageID #:6357\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\nNo. 10-2746  13 \nfinding that in 2007 the Center was violating anyone’s feder-\nal rights. Instead the judge found that the Center was violat-\ning the terms of the 2002 and 2006 settlements—which were \nbased on compromise rather than a finding by the court that \nanyone’s federal rights had been or were being violated. The \norder appointing the Administrator provides that he is “an \nagent of this Court” (which is one of the reasons why we \nconcluded above that the Administrator’s acts are attributed \nto the court for the purpose of §3626). \nIn mid-2008 the Administrator reported that the Center \nwas understaffed and needed more than 175 additional em-\nployees quickly in order to improve detainees’ care. The dis-\ntrict court made a factual finding to that effect—which so far \nas we can see is the only factual finding in the case—but did \nnot conclude that federal law requires additional employees. \nThe Administrator proposed to hire the new workers by con-\ntracts that bypassed the Union and its collective bargaining \nagreement. The district judge authorized this, entering an \norder “suspend[ing] any and all laws … that require compli-\nance with any provision of the current Collective Bargaining \nAgreement”. The judge did not find, however, that super-\nseding state law was the least restrictive way to rectify a vio-\nlation of federal law; the order did not reference §3626. The \nUnion protested, and the judge soon revoked the suspension \nclause of his order. That put state labor laws back into effect. \nThe Union effectively promised not to complain about the \nnew hires, however, if the Administrator respected its mem-\nbers’ rights. \nThis brings us to October 2009, when the Administrator \nproposed to abrogate all of the Union’s rights by firing its \nmembers and hiring a wholly new staff without regard to \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 14 of 23 PageID #:6358\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\n14  No. 10-2746 \nstate labor laws or the existing collective bargaining agree-\nment, a process that everyone understood would mean un-\nemployment for at least 180 of the Union’s members. And, as \nwe’ve explained, when approving this proposal in June 2010 \nthe judge stated that he was not finding any existing viola-\ntion of federal law and was not finding that the restaffing \nplan was necessary to correct any violation. The judge de-\nnied that the PLRA applied at all to the Administrator’s acts, \nbut he did not find in 2010 that it has been satisfied if it does \napply. \nThe lack of factual findings in this case—both the lack of \nfindings about the existence of a violation and the absence of \nfindings about the necessity for a particular remedy to cure \nany violation—contrasts with the elaborate findings the dis-\ntrict court made in Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910 (2011), the \nSupreme  Court’s  only  extended  consideration  of  §3626(a) \nand (b). The Justices divided five to four about whether even \n184 pages of findings and analysis by a district court satis-\nfied the statutory burden; the difference from this case could \nnot be more stark. \nIt follows that the order approving the new staffing plan \nmust be reversed. The plan has been in effect for years, and \nrestoring the Union’s members to their old positions would \nnot be possible, because those positions are gone. But other \nforms of relief, including financial compensation and prefer-\nential hiring for future openings, may be appropriate, and \nwe leave that subject to the district court on remand. \nNothing in this opinion should be read to undermine the \noriginal settlement in 2002 or the follow-up settlements in \n2006. The Union has not questioned them (and would lack \nstanding to do so), and the original litigants remain satisfied. \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 15 of 23 PageID #:6359\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\nNo. 10-2746  15 \nAs we mentioned earlier, the Chief Judge also is satisfied \nwith the provisions of the 2002 and 2006 settlements (which \nthe PLRA treats as consent decrees).

This is an important case \nboth to the parties and to the development of the law in this \ncircuit. Given the disposition reached by my colleagues, it is \nalso imperative that the matter be returned quickly to the \ndistrict court. That court issued a final order on May 15, \n2015.  Under  its  terms,  the  Transitional  Administrator  is \nscheduled  to  report  to  the  parties  on  the  status  of  the \ntransition and on the compliance of the parties by August 17, \nand  the  reservation  of  jurisdiction  to  enforce  the  consent \ndecree will terminate on September 16. The account of the \nOffice  of  the  Transitional  Administrator  is  scheduled  for \nclosure on September 30, 2015. While I respectfully disagree \nwith my colleagues’ resolution of the matter, the need to get \nthis case back to the district court is an imperative that must \nbe paramount. I therefore am constrained to abbreviate my \nown writing in order to ensure that the district court and the \nparties are advised of this court’s decision immediately.  \n \nA. \nIn  my  view,  this  case  does  not  implicate  directly  the \ncontent of the consent decree. As the district court noted \nexplicitly, the order before us is a simple direction enforcing \nor implementing that consent decree and therefore is not \ngoverned by the provisions of the PLRA ex proprio vigore.1 In \nthe course of enforcing or implementing a consent decree, \ndistrict  courts  must  issue  a  variety  of  orders  to  address \nparticular  situations  that  inevitably  arise.  In  the  consent \ndecree,  the  parties  had  recognized  and  agreed  that  the \npersonnel situation in the Center had to undergo significant \n                                                 \n1 See R.589 at 17. \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 17 of 23 PageID #:6361\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\nNo. 10-2746  17 \nchange in order to ensure that the previous treatment of the \nchildren  came  to  a  permanent  end.  The  decree  gives  the \nTransitional  Administrator  the  responsibility,  set  out  in \nsome  detail  in  the  decree,  to  achieve  a  cessation  of  the \ncurrent situation through the implementation of personnel \npolicy  changes.  The  order  appointing  the  Transitional \nAdministrator,  which  the  district  court  quite  properly \nconsidered an integral part of the decree, specifically gives \nthe  Transitional  Administrator  the  authority  “to  establish \npersonnel policies; to create, abolish, or transfer positions; \nand  to  hire,  terminate,  promote,  transfer,  and  evaluate \nmanagement and staff of the JTDC.”2  \nIn the course of his work under the consent decree, the \nAdministrator  determined  that  certain  academic \nqualifications were necessary for those employees in direct \nand  constant  contact  with  the  residents.  The  Union \nchallenged his authority to make these changes. The district \ncourt had allowed the Union to intervene in the case for a \nspecific and limited purpose, which included objecting to the \nTransitional Administrator’s plan.3 After hearing from the \n                                                 \n2 R.330 at 7, § 6(c). \n3 The motion to intervene by the Union that ultimately was granted \nconcerned a prior emergency motion by the Transitional Administrator \nto dispense with particular paragraphs in the bargaining agreement in \norder to hire an outside contractor to handle certain discrete tasks in the \nJTDC, which would require reassignment of current staff. The court \napproved  the  emergency  motion  over  the  Union’s  objection,  later \namending  it  to  the  Union’s  satisfaction.  In  its  order  granting  the \nemergency  motion,  the  court  required  a  report  by  the  Transitional \nAdministrator “on the conditions and status of the issues raised” in the \nemergency  motion.  R.415  at  4.  In  the  second  of  such  reports,  the \nTransitional  Administrator  included  his  proposed  staffing  plan.

The  court \npointedly  noted  that  the  court  was  not  ordering  the \nimplementation of the Transitional Administrator’s plan but \nsimply declaring that his action was within his authority \nunder the consent decree. \nThe Supreme Court noted in Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. \n1910  (2011),  that,  once  properly  invoked,  “the  scope  of  a \ndistrict court’s equitable powers … is broad, for breadth and \nflexibility  are  inherent  in  equitable  remedies.”  Id.  at  1944 \n(alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nOur court has long recognized, moreover, a basic distinction \nbetween  the  terms  of  a  consent  decree  and  the  periodic \norders that interpret, enforce and implement its terms. See \nJones-El  v.  Berge,  374  F.3d  541,  545  (7th  Cir.  2004).  The \ndistinction is, to put it mildly, not a novel one, and certainly \none  that  we  must  assume  that  Congress  understood  in \ncrafting the present provisions of the PLRA. In the PLRA, \nCongress  mandated,  as  Supreme  Court  decisions  already \nhad  done,  that  the  terms  of  a  federal  court  judgment  be \naimed at a “condition that offends the Constitution.”4 The \nstatute’s concern is with whether the court’s judgment or \ndecree  is  aimed  at  a  federal  constitutional  violation  and \nwhether the court has chosen a means tailored to rectify that \n                                                                                                             \ncourt approved the report over the Union’s objection, resulting in the \npresent appeal. \n4 Milliken v.

Here,  the  Union  brought  no  challenge  against  the \nconsent  decree  but  merely  challenged  whether  a  certain \naction fell within its scope and was otherwise permissible \nunder state and federal law.  \nNo  doubt,  the  PLRA  does  require  that  a  court  give \nsubstantial  weight  to  public  safety  and  adopt  a  remedial \ndevice  that  is  “narrowly  drawn,  extends  no  further  than \nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is \nthe least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of \nthe  Federal  right,”  see  18  U.S.C.  §  3626(a)(1),  but  this \nstatutory  admonition,  a  codification  of  well-established \nprinciples  of  federal  equitable  jurisprudence  in \nconstitutional cases, must  \nnot be interpreted to place undue restrictions \non  the  authority  of  federal  courts  to  fashion \npractical  remedies  when  confronted  with \ncomplex  and  intractable  constitutional \nviolations … .  \nCourts  should  presume  that  Congress  was \nsensitive to the real-world problems … [that] \nwould remedy constitutional violations in the \nprisons  and  that  Congress  did  not  leave \nprisoners without a remedy for violations of \ntheir constitutional rights. \nBrown, 131 S. Ct. at 1937. \nHere, the district court explicitly noted that the question \nbefore  it  was  a  limited  one:  whether  the  Transitional \nAdministrator  was  authorized  to  take  action  under  the \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 20 of 23 PageID #:6364\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\n20  No. 10-2746 \nconsent decree and under state and federal laws.5 The court \nanswered these questions in the affirmative. Indeed, it did \nnot undertake to alter in any way the consent decree or to \nvest additional authority in the Transitional Administrator. \nIt did not tell him that he had to implement his personnel \nplan; it simply told him that he was empowered to do it. \nThe district court in no way violated the PLRA in its \nhandling of the Union’s limited objection.  \n \nB. \nMy colleagues conclude their opinion by stating that it \nshould not be read to undermine the validity of the various \n                                                 \n5 My colleagues find fault with the district court’s resolution of the \nquestion of the Union’s right to bargain as a matter of state law.  The \ndistrict  court’s  decision  was  based  on  its  assessment  of  the  limited \narguments  put  before  it.    That  is, it  had  determined  that  state  law \nrequired application of a fact-specific balancing inquiry and stated that \nthe Union had “fail[ed] to address in practical terms the anticipated \nbenefits of bargaining.” R.589 at 11. The Transitional Administrator, on \nthe  other  hand,  “ha[d]  gone  through  great  efforts  to  explain  the \nparticular reasons for and policies underlying his decision … and how \nthese standards relate to his court-mandated mission.” Id. at 12. The \ncourt noted that “it is undisputed that approximately half of the JTDC’s \ncurrent  residents  are  housed  in  units  structured  on  the  old  JTDC \n‘system’—a system that was to be ‘restructured’ by court order.”  Id. \n(citation omitted). Only then, after stating that the Union had not shown \nspecific benefits of bargaining and that the countervailing interests were \ngreat, did it conclude that “the benefits of bargaining do not outweigh \nthe burdens” and thus there was no state law right. Id. In my view, this \nconclusion  is  not  about  the  need  for  speed  and  flexibility  as  an \noverriding justification, but about a failure of the Union to present the \ncourt with sufficient alternate considerations to be balanced. \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 21 of 23 PageID #:6365\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\nNo. 10-2746  21 \nsettlement documents entered in this case. On this point, we \nare in agreement, and I write separately to emphasize that \nthe  court’s  searching  review  of  the  district  court  record \nshould not give the impression that we had undertaken to \nexamine earlier decrees, not the subject of this appeal, for \ntheir  separate  compliance  with  the  PLRA.6  There  are \nmultiple reasons, including those mentioned by the majority, \nthat  these  questions  were  not  presented  in  the  present \nappeal. First, the statute contains a specific way to challenge \n                                                 \n6  Whether  a  consent  decree  involving  prisons  always  requires,  as  a \nprerequisite to the entry of a remedy, a judicial finding of an actual \nconstitutional violation even when the parties do not request such a finding is \na very difficult question, one that we ought to approach only in a case \nwhere resolution is absolutely necessary and where the matter has been \nbriefed fully by the parties to the litigation. While a case can be made \nthat the PLRA requires such a judicial finding, see Deborah Decker, \nConsent Decrees and the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Usurping \nJudicial Power or Quelling Judicial Micro-Management?, 1997 Wisc. L. Rev. \n1275, 1278; see also, e.g., Plyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d 365, 370 (4th Cir. 1996) \n(deciding the question sub silentio in the context of a proceeding under 18 \nU.S.C. § 3626(b)(2)), the question becomes a great deal more difficult \nwhen we remember that such a requirement would, as a practical matter, \nmake the whole idea of a consent decree superfluous. Consent decrees \nare sought by defendants, especially state and local defendants, to permit \nthe implementation of a remedy without an admission or judicial finding \nof liability, an admission or finding with dire collateral consequences for \nstate  and  municipal  defendants.  If,  as  the  Supreme  Court  has \nadmonished in Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910 (2011), we ought to be \nhesitant in interpreting the PLRA to attribute to Congress a motivation in \nthe PLRA to leave prisoners without a remedy for violations of rights \nprotected by the Constitution, we ought to be equally careful not to \nattribute  to  that  body  the  motivation  to  make  illusory  the  one \nmechanism  by  which  both  incarcerated  individuals  and  local \ngovernments  can  resolve  such  litigation  relatively  expeditiously  and \ninexpensively while maintaining a good deal of control in local hands. \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 22 of 23 PageID #:6366\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\n22  No. 10-2746 \na non-conforming decree, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b), but the parties \nhave  never  invoked  that  section  and,  to  this  day,  see  no \nreason to challenge the district court’s determination that the \nconsent decree is in conformity with the statute. The Union, \nwhose intervention was limited to the question of whether \nthe  Temporary  Administrator’s  personnel  action  was \nconsistent with the consent decree, has given the question \nwide berth. Some of its filings in the district court raise the \nmatter, at least obliquely, but it never asked the court to hold \na hearing to consider squarely this question.7  \nFurther, in any event, the district court explicitly said \nthat, with respect to the consent decree, the requirements of \nthe  PLRA  were  met.8  Portions  of  my  colleagues’  opinion \ncould  be  read  as  suggesting  that  the  district  court  never \nmade  findings  sufficiently  detailed  to  satisfy  the  statute. \nHowever, the plain language of the statute does not require \nany particular degree of detail and, here, no party has ever \ndisputed the objectives of the consent decree. Nor does any \nparty contend that the terms of the consent decree are not \ndesigned precisely to deal with the problem. No doubt, if \nthere  is  a  dispute  on  whether  a  condition  offends  the \n                                                 \n7 The district court was clear on this point:  \nAlthough the Union hints that the consent decrees … \nmay no longer be necessary to correct any underlying \nconstitutional violations, the Union does not go so far as \nto request an evidentiary hearing on this question, nor \ndoes the Union actually ask the court to terminate these \norders pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b).  \nR.589 at 17 (citations omitted). \n8 See id. \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 795 Filed: 09/10/15 Page 23 of 23 PageID #:6367\nCase:C 1a0s-e2:7 1406- 2   7  4D6o  c  u  mDeoncut:m 0e0n7t1: 29600  1  8  7  2       F   il e  d  :  F0i8le/1d7: /0290/1058 / 2  0  1P5a  g  e  sP: a2g3es: 23\nNo. 10-2746  23 \nConstitution  or  whether  the  means  to  address  it  are \nnarrowly tailored, more specific findings would be required. \nSee Cason v.

Dkt. 330 (“Appointment Order”). The purpose of this Order is to appoint a \nTransitional Administrator (“TA”) with the authority and responsibility to bring the Cook \nCounty Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (“JTDC”) into substantial compliance with the \nMemorandum of Agreement (“MOA”), the Agreed Supplemental Order (“ASO”), and the \nModified Implementation Plan (“MIP”), and to prepare the JTDC for the transition of \nadministrative authority over its operations to the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court \nof Cook County (“OCJ”). The Order also requires the TA to report to the Court on a regular \nbasis. See Dkts. 458, 530, 646, 680, 686 (TA’s prior reports). \n  The TA is glad to report that the JTDC is close to being in substantial compliance with \nthe ASO, MOA, and MIP, but important work remains before the OCJ will be in a position to \nassume administrative responsibility for the facility. Although the TA is working closely with the \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 711 Filed: 01/10/14 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:5569\nOCJ toward a transition, several issues must be resolved before an orderly transition can take \nplace. These issues are discussed in detail below. \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Substantial Compliance with the ASO, MOA, and MIP \n \nThe JTDC is close to being in substantial compliance with the ASO, MOA, and MIP. As \ndiscussed in further detail below, there are certain provisions of these Orders for which the \nfacility has not reached substantial compliance. For each such provision, however, the JTDC is \neither well on its way to being in substantial compliance (pending the completion of capital \nprojects), or else the TA is seeking a modification of the provision at issue. \nA.  Compliance Report \n \nThe Office of the Transitional Administrator (“OTA”) has conducted a systemic \nassessment of the JTDC’s compliance with all provisions of the ASO, MOA, and MIP. The TA’s \ncomprehensive report, describing the state of the facility’s compliance with each requirement of \nthe ASO, MOA, and MIP, is attached here as Exhibit A. In summary, the JTDC is in substantial \ncompliance with approximately 76% of provisions in the MOA and 62% of those in the MIP. In \naddition, the JTDC is in partial compliance with an additional 16% of provisions in the MOA \nand 25% of provisions in the MIP.1 The JTDC is therefore in substantial or partial compliance \nwith more than 89% of all provisions of the MOA/MIP.2  \n                                            \n1 For example, the JTDC is in partial compliance with the MOA requirement that the facility put \nin place an adequate system for staff discipline, among other things. The TA alone cannot develop such a \nsystem, which among other things will require changes in the collective bargaining agreements with \nemployee unions. That will be the responsibility of the OCJ and the parties, as administration of the \nfacility is transitioned to the OCJ. \n2 The TA’s determination of substantial and partial compliance is based on policies and practices \ncurrently in place at the JTDC. With respect to the MOA/MIP requirements for which the facility has not \nreached partial or substantial compliance, the TA has found: (1) that approximately 3.5% of these \nrequirements are “not applicable,” meaning that they no longer apply to the JTDC (e.g., they were \nabolished in the Appointment Order) or they do not apply because a predicate event has not brought a \n  2\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 711 Filed: 01/10/14 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:5570\nExhibit B to this report provides the Court with charts and worksheets that summarize the \nJTDC’s compliance with the ASO, MOA, and MIP. As the Court will see, important—but now \nlimited—work remains to bring the JTDC into substantial compliance with the ASO, MOA, and \nMIP. As discussed in detail below, the focus of the TA’s and the parties’ efforts can now shift to \nplanning for a satisfactory transition. The TA is happy to comment in further detail on his \nassessment of the JTDC’s compliance at the Court’s request. \nB.  The OTA’s Transition Plan \n \nProgress toward transition of authority to the OCJ has been and remains a top priority for \nthe TA, and as noted in the TA’s last report, the OTA has been engaged for some time in the \nprocess of preparing a comprehensive transition plan for the JTDC. The TA is pleased to \nannounce that the transition plan, prepared by the TA’s Transition Plan Committee, is now \ncomplete. A copy of the transition plan is attached to this report as Exhibit C. \nThe transition plan is based upon the perspectives of a wide range of key individuals and \nanalyzes: (1) the complex issues at the JTDC that preceded the appointment of the TA; (2) \nactions taken by the TA; (3) yet-to-be accomplished steps required for a successful transition; \nand (4) the critical elements of a successful transition from the TA to the OCJ. The transition \nplan is a comprehensive account of the history and reform of the JTDC, and it is designed to \nassist the OCJ in a transition process that will preserve the significant accomplishments of the \nOTA and continue to improve the JTDC. The transition plan represents the start of a process that \nwill be necessary to ensure a successful transfer of administration from the TA to the OCJ. \n \n                                                                                                                                             \nparticular requirement into play (e.g., the JTDC is not currently overcrowded, and so certain provisions of \nparagraph 39 are not implicated at this point in time); (2) that approximately 3.5% of these requirements \ninvolve provisions where the TA is requesting an exemption or modification of the requirements set out \nin the MOA or MIP; and (3) that approximately 3.5% of these requirements involve requirements with \nwhich the facility has not yet complied. \n  3\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 711 Filed: 01/10/14 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:5571\nC.  Modification Requests  \n \nAs the TA has referenced in prior reports, he is seeking modification of certain provisions \nof the MOA/MIP.3 A complete list of the provisions for which the TA seeks modification is \nattached to this report as Exhibit D. \nIn November 2013, the TA met with the Doe parties to discuss these modification \nrequests. The only requests over which concern was noted were the requests relating to \nparagraph 19, sections 2.17 and 2.6 of the MOA/MIP, regarding substance abuse treatment at the \nJTDC. Plaintiffs’ counsel and the OTA are discussing this issue with one another, and they hope \nto reach a resolution shortly. \nFor the most part, the TA’s requests for modifications reflect the discovery and \nimplementation of better methods to achieve the goals served by the particular provisions of the \nMOA/MIP at issue. For example, the TA seeks a modification of paragraph 24, section 2.4 of the \nMOA/MIP, which requires the development of a special unit to house suicidal residents of the \nJTDC. The reason for the requested modification is that residents who are deemed a substantial \nsuicide risk are no longer housed at the JTDC—they are now referred to external medical \nfacilities where they are more appropriately treated, conserving the JTDC’s operational \nresources. Other requests for modifications reflect simple, positive changes in technology. For \nexample, paragraph 33, sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the MOA/MIP require the JTDC to keep certain \ndata in a database that is outdated and that will no longer be used at the JTDC. With respect to \nthis provision, the TA seeks permission to keep the data instead in the electronic medical records \nsystem that will soon be installed at the JTDC. If the Court wishes further detail or explanation \non the modification requests set out in Exhibit D, the TA is glad to provide it. \n                                            \n3 The MOA contemplated that certain provisions contained within the MOA or the MIP might \nwarrant modification as time passed and better approaches for reaching constitutional standards were \nrevealed. See MOA ¶ 63. \n  4\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 711 Filed: 01/10/14 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:5572\nD.  Capital Projects \nAs the TA noted above and has previously reported to the Court, completion of various \ncapital projects is an essential component of bringing the facility into substantial compliance.  \nThe Cook County Bureau of Technology (“BOT”) has committed to providing upgraded \ninfrastructure, resources, and personnel for these projects. \n1.  Resident Management Information System (RMIS) \nAs previously reported, the JTDC must implement a new resident management \ninformation system (“RMIS”). This is necessary for two reasons: First, the old platform, called \nDSI, is no longer supported by the vendor. Second and more importantly, compliance with the \nquality assurance provisions of the MOA and MIP requires the JTDC to maintain and track data \nin a manner that is not possible using the current system. Implementation of an appropriate \nRMIS is therefore critically important to the transition process. \nOver the past several months, Bob Dugan, a consultant to the OTA, has been working \nclosely with the BOT and the OCJ to initiate procurement of an appropriate RMIS. The County \nrecently obtained bids from vendors, which were evaluated jointly by the JTDC, the BOT, and \nthe OCJ. It is anticipated that a vendor will be selected and approved by the County Board in \nFebruary or March 2014. Once the new vendor for an RMIS is chosen and the contract is \napproved, this project will require close attention from Mr. Dugan, the BOT, and the OCJ to \nensure it is implemented appropriately and that staff is properly trained on its use. The TA has \nconcerns that the changes in oversight at the BOT may delay implementation of the new RMIS. \n2.  Other Capital Projects Are Underway \nThe TA is glad to report that the other capital projects needed to maintain safety and \nsecurity at the JTDC are well on their way to completion. Installation of the security \n  5\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 711 Filed: 01/10/14 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:5573\ncamera/rounds tracking system is about 35% complete, while installation of the new ceiling tile \nand lighting system in the living units is about 65% complete. \nThe gymnasium and recreation yard projects—which are needed to ensure that residents \nget basic, minimum large muscle activity each day—are still in the early stages, although the \nCounty appears committed to seeing those projects through. The same applies to the electronic \nmedical record system, which will ensure that the JTDC stays in compliance with certain \nmedical provisions of the MOA and MIP and maintains its NCCHC accreditation. \nII.  Planning an Orderly Transition to the OCJ Remains an Issue \nUnder the Appointment Order, the TA is charged not only with bringing the JTDC into \nsubstantial compliance with the ASO, MOA, and MIP, but he also must make plans for an \norderly transition of the facility to the OCJ. See Doc. 330, ¶ 9(b) (“At least 60 days prior to the \ntermination of his appointment, the TA shall develop a plan for the post-TA operation of the \nJTDC, which shall include consideration of the structure, funding, and transition to [the OCJ].”); \nsee also id. ¶ 11(b)(i) (“Throughout the appointment of the TA, it shall be the responsibility of \nthe TA to assess the capacity of the JTDC for the purpose of transitioning administrative and \noperational authority to [the OCJ].”). \nAt this time, planning for an orderly transition of the JTDC to the OCJ is a top priority, \nand the one that currently requires the most attention from the TA, the parties, and the OCJ. \nThere are two principal issues relating to this subject: First, planning the transition and \ncoordinating with the OCJ to formulate and carry out a transition plan is itself a complex project. \nSecond, the transition is made even more complicated by the fact that the plan for transition must \nensure that the Doe parties and the OCJ can manage the dramatic increase in the JTDC \npopulation expected during 2014 as a result of the new Illinois “Raise the Age” legislation, \n  6\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 711 Filed: 01/10/14 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:5574\nwhich will route into the juvenile system a number of children who were formerly treated as \nadults. These issues are discussed in turn below. \nA.  The OCJ’s Readiness for Transition \nAs the TA has mentioned previously to the Court, the TA feels strongly that any plan for \npost-TA operations at the JTDC must be developed collaboratively with the OCJ. The OCJ had \ncommissioned a series of reviews, as referenced by the TA in previous reports, with the Annie E. \nCasey Foundation. These reviews have provided the OCJ some necessary and essential insight in \npreparation for transition as well as planning for the “Raise the Age” legislation. \nOn January 9, 2014, Chief Judge Evans and the TA participated in a conference call, in \nwhich they agreed to take initial steps for the Chief Judge to meet with the JTDC Executive \nTeam, in order to consider formation of a “transitional working group.” Other issues discussed \nincluded the impact of the “Raise the Age” legislation and the JTDC’s maximum operating \ncapacity. It was agreed that respective staff would begin preliminary work and that the Chief \nJudge and the TA would meet again in the very near future. \nB.  Raise the Age Legislation \nAny plan for transition must include mechanisms for managing the increase in the JTDC \npopulation that is expected this year and for ensuring that residents’ constitutional rights are \nprotected in the face of this increase. By way of background, on January 1, 2014, new Illinois \nlegislation went into effect, increasing the age for juvenile-court jurisdiction from 17 to 18. This \nnew legislation means that 17-year-olds charged with misdemeanors, nonviolent felonies, and \nsome violent felonies will now be tried and sentenced in juvenile courts, rather than in adult \ncourts. The legislation will have a significant impact on the JTDC, both because the JTDC \n  7\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 711 Filed: 01/10/14 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:5575\npopulation is likely to increase significantly and because older residents of the JTDC have \ndifferent needs than younger residents and present different challenges. \nAlthough these developments will require many programmatic adjustments at the JTDC,4 \nthe more immediate concern is whether the current JTDC facility can house these additional \nyoung people in a manner that complies with minimum constitutional standards. \n1.  The Functional Operating Capacity of the JTDC is 382 Residents \nAs the Raise the Age legislation goes into effect at the JTDC beginning this month, \npopulation safeguards will need to be put into place to ensure operating effectiveness of the \nprograms associated with the ASO, MOA, and MIP. The functional operating capacity of the \nJTDC is 382 beds. That functional operating capacity reflects the number of beds reasonably \navailable to house residents in a way that does not jeopardize their constitutional rights. \nAccordingly, the functional operating capacity of the JTDC is less than the total rated bed \ncapacity of 498 beds, because a number of the total 498 beds have been designated as unusable. \nThe beds are unusable because of security and safety demands, repair and maintenance issues, or \nbecause they have been designated for use for another important purpose under the MOA/MIP.  \nThe JTDC’s functional operating capacity of 382 beds is calculated as follows, based on \nrequirements set forth in the MOA/MIP: The facility is divided into 17 pods with 18 beds, and 12 \npods with 16 beds. Two beds in each 18-bed pod, or 34 beds total, must be deducted from the \ntotal number of beds available to remain in compliance with the Prisoner Rape Elimination Act \nof 2003 (“PREA”), Pub. L. 108-79. In order to provide minimally adequate health and mental \nhealth services, one bed in each 16-bed pod, or 12 beds total, must be reserved for mental health \n                                            \n4 One example is that the JTDC and Nancy B. Jefferson school have been working together with \ncommunity organizations in an effort to bring life skills, transitional skills, life coaches, recreational \nactivities, and other services to the JTDC population. This program will have to adapt to accommodate \n17-year-olds who are beyond compulsory school age. \n  8\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 711 Filed: 01/10/14 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:5576\nand medical satellite offices, as set forth in the MOA/MIP. There are approximately 46 rooms \nunavailable at any given time at the JTDC for maintenance reasons, including an average 14 \nrooms that are uninhabitable and two pods of 16 beds each, which are reserved for the Building \nTrades Initiative—a program created to perform routine preventative maintenance on pods so \nthat their continued viability is ensured. Finally, approximately 24 beds are unavailable for use \ndue to the JTDC’s housing classification system, which separates youth by sex, committing \ncourt, age and vulnerability, number of prior admissions to juvenile detention, and the type of \nstay (intake and admissions, or general population). \n2.  The Transition Plan Must Address Expected Increases in JTDC Population  \n \nBecause of the requirements of the MOA/MIP, the obligations of the TA, and the \noperational capacity of the JTDC discussed above, any plan for an orderly transition of the JTDC \nto the OCJ must include provisions that ensure that the JTDC population remains at a \nmanageable level. Housing a population greater than 382 residents would mean that the JTDC is \nnot meeting the standards laid out in the MOA/MIP; and a population above that operational \ncapacity would call into serious question the ability of the facility to protect the constitutional \nrights of residents. \nThe TA has personally witnessed and has served as an expert on the detrimental effects \nthat over-population can have on facilities like the JTDC. Overcrowding at a facility affects the \nsafety of both residents and staff, particularly in an antiquated physical plant like the JTDC. A \npopulation above operating capacity leads to an increase in both assaults against staff and fights \namong residents. These problems are compounded by the fact that the JTDC must now manage a \npopulation of residents that will now include 17-year-olds. Setting the functional operating \n  9\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 711 Filed: 01/10/14 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:5577\ncapacity at 382 ensures sufficient staffing levels and provides a safety threshold for both \nresidents and staff of the JTDC. See Ex. C at 60–61. \nIncreasing the population at the JTDC will also put a significant strain on the facility’s \nalready limited resources. The JTDC is in the process of opening two additional Centers (for a \ntotal of 9 Centers) to accommodate an increase in population. To maintain a population at or \nbelow functional operating capacity, the TA must cap each 18-bed pod with 14 residents and \neach 16-bed pod with 12 residents. \nIII.  Other Items Relevant to Transition of Interest to the Court \n \nA.  Internal Investigations \nThe OTA has been handling internal investigations of incidents or allegations involving \nserious misconduct by residents or staff since the TA’s appointment. In anticipation of the \ntransition to the OCJ, this investigative function will be transferred to a JTDC employee who \nwill work with the Deputy Executive Director for Resident Advocacy and Quality of Life. A \nchart summarizing the results of internal investigations between 2008 and December 1, 2013, is \nattached to this report as Exhibit E. So far in 2013, a total of 317 investigations have been \nundertaken, which is substantially more than any previous year during the TA’s tenure.   \nB.  Compliance with the Federal Prison Rape Elimination Act \nThe JTDC continues to make progress in meeting requirements of the federal Prison \nRape Elimination Act. The JTDC has convened a PREA Committee, which has conducted an \nassessment of the facility based on U.S. Department of Justice guidelines and has developed \npolicies, procedures, staff training, and resident orientation materials to comply with PREA \nstandards. The JTDC’s PREA Committee is also working with community agencies to develop a \nMemorandum of Understanding to provide services to JTDC residents. \n  10\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 711 Filed: 01/10/14 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:5578\nC.  Suicide Prevention \nAlthough there is no record of any recent suicide within the JTDC, the TA has been \ndeveloping and refining the facility’s suicide prevention program since 2007. The TA has made a \nnumber of physical changes to the JTDC and improved training to staff on youth suicide \nprevention strategies. \nThe TA recently hired Lindsay M. Hayes, a juvenile justice consultant from the National \nCenter on Institutions and Alternatives, to assess current suicide prevention practices at the \nJTDC and to offer recommendations to improve those practices. In his report, Mr. Hayes found \nthat the facility had a good suicide prevention program and made a number of recommendations \nto help the TA continue to improve the program. His findings and recommendations are attached \nas Exhibit F. The TA is currently working to implement his recommendations to the suicide \nprevention programs at the JTDC. \nCONCLUSION \nThe TA hopes that his report is useful to the Court and to the parties. A copy of the report \nhas also been sent to the OCJ. The TA will be present at the next status hearing on January 14, \n2014, and he will be glad to answer questions or address any concerns at that time. \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \n             /s/ Steven Art      \n            Attorney for the Transitional Administrator \nArthur Loevy \nJon Loevy \nElizabeth Mazur \nSteven Art \nSarah Grady \nLOEVY & LOEVY \n312 N.

Holderman Sitting Judge if Other\nor Magistrate Judge than Assigned Judge\nCASE NUMBER 99 C 3945 DATE 11/3/2010\nCASE Jimmy Doe, et al. Vs. Cook County, et al.\nTITLE\nDOCKET ENTRY TEXT\nFor the reasons set forth in the Statement section of this order, Intervenor Teamsters Local 700’s “Motion for\nInjunction or Stay Pending Appeal” [616] is denied.  Status hearing set for November 23, 2010 at 9:00 a.m.\nfor purposes of setting further dates as appropriate.\nO[ For further details see text below.] Notices mailed.\nSTATEMENT\nOn June 23, 2010, this court entered a memorandum opinion and order approving the Transitional\nAdministrator’s (“TA”) proposed staffing plan for the four new “Centers” to be created from the remaining\nliving units at the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center (“JTDC”).  (Dkt. No. 589.)  On August 23, 2010,\nthe court certified its June 23, 2010 Order under Rule 54(b) as a final judgment that the Transitional\nAdministrator’s proposed staffing plan does not (1) exceed the scope of the TA’s mandate; (2) impermissibly\ninterfere with the state law bargaining rights of affected employees; (3) violate the affected employees’ due\nprocess rights; or (4) violate the Prison Litigation Reform Act.  (Dkt. No. 611.)  \nIntervenor Teamsters Local 700 (the “Union”) has appealed the court’s June 23, 2010 Order and has\nfiled a “Motion for Injunction or Stay Pending Appeal” (Dkt. No. 616), requesting that this court enjoin or\nstay the implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan until the Seventh Circuit has ruled on the Union’s\nappeal.\nThe Union seeks relief pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(c), which permits district\ncourts to “suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction . . . [on] terms that secure the opposing party’s\nrights” during the appeal of an interlocutory order that itself “grants, dissolves, or denies an injunction.”  Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 62(c).  One procedural twist in this case is that the Union’s objections to the TA’s proposed\nstaffing plan were never explicitly described in terms of injunctive relief, perhaps because the TA is an agent\nof the court.  The Union did, however, ask this court to re-direct the TA’s activities and order the TA to\nundertake certain obligations.  (See Dkt. No. 573 (“Union’s Final Reply”) at 15.)  Insofar as this court’s June\n23, 2010 Order can be viewed as an order “den[ying] an injunction,” this court finds that it is authorized\nunder Rule 62(c) to enjoin the implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan during the pendency of the\nUnion’s appeal.  \nRegardless, the same standard applies to the Union’s motion whether it is considered a motion for an\ninjunction pending appeal or a motion for a stay of this court’s June 23, 2010 Order.  Cavel Int’l, Inc. v.\nMadigan, 500 F.3d 544, 547 (7th Cir. 2007).  “If an appeal has no merit at all, an injunction pending the\nappeal should of course be denied.”  Id.  However, as long as the Union’s appeal has “some” merit, id., this\ncourt must consider whether the Union has met its burden of demonstrating “[1] that it has a significant\n99C3945 Jimmy Doe, et al. Vs. Cook County, et al. Page 1 of  3\n\nprobability of success on the merits; [2] that it will face irreparable harm absent a stay; and [3] that a stay will\nnot injure the opposing party and will be in the public interest.”  Hinrichs v. Bosma, 440 F.3d 393, 396 (7th\nCir. 2006).  The court applies a “sliding scale” approach to this balancing test, “weighting harm to a party by\nthe merit of his case.”  Cavel Int’l, 500 F.3d at 547.  The greater the harm, the less need to demonstrate a\nstrong likelihood of success on the merits.  Thomas v. City of Evanston, 636 F. Supp. 587, 591 (N.D. Ill.\n1986) (Aspen, J.).\nThe Union first argues that JTDC employees will be irreparably harmed if they are discharged under\nthe TA’s proposed staffing plan.  Of necessity, this argument is speculative.  It is not clear how many, if any,\nJTDC employees will be discharged as a result of the implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan. \nThe TA’s proposed staffing plan calls for incumbent JTDC direct care workers to pass a series of interviews\nand screening procedures (see Dkt. No. 616, Ex. A (“TA Bulletin #142 and Attachments”)), and it is\nimpossible to guess how many employees will successfully complete this process.  Nevertheless, this court\nhas previously “agree[d] with the reasonableness of the Union’s speculation that some terminations ‘will\ninvariably follow’ implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan.”  (6/23/10 Order 13 (citation\nomitted).)  \nThe next relevant question on the issue of irreparable harm is timing.  The Union has articulated no\nirreparable harm associated with its members participating in the screening and interviewing process. \nAccordingly, if it is clear that no employees will be discharged prior to the resolution of the Union’s appeal,\nthere is no need to stay the implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan.  The TA predicts “that the\nscreening and interviewing process for the YDS/YDS-A positions will last several months, and will be\ncomplete soon after January 1, 2011.”  (Dkt. No. 622 (“TA’s Resp.”) at 3.)  The TA has committed to\nretaining all JTDC employees who participate in the screening and interviewing process “until at least\nJanuary 1, regardless of how they score on the IMPACT test or how they fare during the interview process.” \n(Id.)  Briefing on appeal is scheduled to conclude on December 8, 2010, and none of the parties has sought an\nexpedited briefing schedule on appeal.  In light of this schedule, this court finds it unlikely—although\ncertainly not impossible—that the Seventh Circuit will rule on the Union’s appeal before January 1, 2011.  It\ntherefore would appear that at least some JTDC employees will be discharged pursuant to the TA’s proposed\nstaffing plan during the pendency of the Union’s appeal, absent the relief requested by the Union.\nIn general, the termination of an employment relationship is not considered an irreparable harm. \nBedrossian v. Northwestern Mem. Hosp., 409 F.3d 840, 845-46 (7th Cir. 2005) (citing Sampson v. Murray,\n415 U.S. 61, 92 & n.68 (1974)).  Likewise, the typical injuries arising from an allegedly wrongful\ntermination, such as humiliation, damage to reputation, and loss of income, are not themselves considered\nirreparable.  Id.  The Union argues that this case is different, insofar as “the affected employees will have no\nrecourse, whether through reinstatement or money damages, against the Chief Judge after he takes over from\nthe TA.”  (Dkt. No. 617 (“Union’s Mem.”) at 4.)  The Union likens the upcoming transfer of authority to the\nOffice of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County (“OCJ”) to the case of Local Lodge No. 1266,\nInternational Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers v. Panoramic Corp., in which the Seventh\nCircuit found there to be a potential for a “permanent loss of jobs”—and irreparable harm—when the new\nemployer had “no duty to rehire” employees who had been slated for termination upon sale of the company. \nLocal Lodge No. 1266, Int’l Ass’n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers v. Panoramic Corp., 668 F.2d 276,\n286 (7th Cir. 1981).\nAgain, the issue of timing is relevant.  Unlike in Panoramic Corp., there is currently no date set for\nthe upcoming transfer of authority to the OCJ, nor will the transfer of authority inevitably result from the\ndenial of the Union’s request for an injunction.  The TA has predicted that “other issues will keep him\noccupied at the JTDC well into 2011, such as improving the physical plant, installing cameras, and bringing\nhealth care delivery up to standards.”  (TA’s Resp. 11.)  Plaintiffs agree with this assessment (Dkt. No. 621\n(“Pls.’ Resp.”) at 12), and the Union does not argue otherwise.  From its past experience with this litigation,\n99C3945 Jimmy Doe, et al. Vs. Cook County, et al. Page 2 of  3\n\nthis court finds it unlikely that the TA’s assignment will conclude at any point in the near future, and agrees\nwith Plaintiffs that “the TA almost certainly will be at the JTDC to grant relief if the Seventh Circuit reverses\nthe Order.”  (Id. at 13.)  Under these circumstances, the Union has not shown that it will face irreparable\nharm absent an injunction of the TA’s proposed staffing plan.\nThe Union next argues that neither the Plaintiffs nor the public interest will be prejudiced if the TA’s\nproposed staffing plan is enjoined, because “the delay engendered by the Union’s appeal will be\ncomparatively short” and “there is no evidence that constitutional violations remain at the JTDC.”  (Union’s\nMem. 14-15.)  It is undisputed that, on May 8, 2008, Judge Nordberg found that “the JTDC is dangerously\nunderstaffed and . . . the health and safety of residents is at risk.”  (Dkt. No. 415 (“5/8/08 Order”) ¶ 3.)  Since\nthat time, there have been no further hearings to determine whether there are ongoing constitutional\nviolations at the JTDC.  The Union is therefore correct in stating that there has been no evidence presented to\nthe court on this issue.  However, the court finds it unduly risky to conclude from this lack of evidence that\nthere are no ongoing constitutional violations at the JTDC.  Indeed, in light of the fact that no party to this\nlitigation has yet sought the termination of these post-judgment proceedings, the court finds it likely that this\nis not the situation.  As Plaintiffs note, “every day that the young residents endure unsafe conditions and\ninadequate services is harmful.”  (Pls.’ Resp. 13-14.)  The public also has an interest in seeing this important,\nand protracted, litigation brought to a close.  As this court has previously noted, “the parties have represented\nto the court that the implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan is the final major effort needed to\nbring the JTDC into substantial compliance with the MOA, ASO, and MIP.”  (8/23/10 Order 3.)  A stay of\nthe TA’s proposed staffing plan will cost Cook County taxpayers the expenses of additional planning,\nextended contracts for temporary services, and additional exposure to liability, and will extend the “state of\nlimbo” (TA’s Resp. 13) under which the TA currently labors.  The court therefore rejects the Union’s\nargument that no party would be harmed if the court were to enjoin the implementation of the TA’s proposed\nstaffing plan.   \nFinally, the Union argues that it has made a “strong showing” of success on the merits of its appeal. \nThis court agrees that the Union has met its burden of presenting a “not negligible” chance of success on the\nmerits, in that its appeal has “some” merit.  Cavel Int’l, 500 F.3d at 547, 548.  However, this court is not\npersuaded that the Union has demonstrated a “significant probability of success on the merits.”  Hinrichs,\n440 F.3d at 396.  In support of its position on this point, the Union generally rehashes arguments previously\nraised before this court.  As Judge Aspen has eloquently stated, “Obviously, we think an appeal will probably\nfail; we have reviewed our opinion and stand by it.  Had we thought an appeal would be successful, we\nwould not have ruled as we did in the first place.”  Thomas, 636 F. Supp. at 590.  Where the other factors\ndiscussed above do not favor a stay, the Union’s arguments regarding the merits of its appeal do not persuade\nthis court that an injunction of the TA’s proposed staffing plan is warranted.\nThe court recognizes that its decision today might appear at first reading to be at odds with its August\n23, 2010 Order finding no just reason to delay the Union’s appeal.  However, different factors were relevant\nto each analysis.  In its August 23, 2010 Order, the court focused, in part, on the TA’s role in shaping\ninstitutional reform at the JTDC, and the inherent difficulties of later requiring another institution (the OCJ)\nto “undo” any harm caused by the implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan.  However, the unique\nnature of this complex case has also led this court to conclude that the equities do not lie in favor of enjoining\nthe implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan at this time, as discussed above.  Accordingly, the\nUnion’s “Motion for Injunction or Stay Pending Appeal” (Dkt. No. 616) is denied. \n                                                                                                               \n  \n Courtroom Deputy A.M.M.\nInitials:\n99C3945 Jimmy Doe, et al.

Holderman: On June 23, 2010, this court\nissued a Memorandum Opinion and Order 589 approving the Transitional\nAdministrator's (\"TA\") proposed staffing plan for the Cook County JTDC as set forth\nin the TA's Second Report. Intervenor Teamsters Local 700 (the \"Union\") thereafter,\non July 22, 2010, filed a notice of appeal 595 and, on September 8, 2010, filed a\nmotion to stay 616 seeking to enjoin the TA from implementing his proposed staffing\nplan. This court denied the Union's motion to stay on November 3, 2010, agreeing\nwith Plaintiffs that \"the TA almost certainly will be at the JTDC to grant relief' if the\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-3945   As of: 12/20/2018 08:27 PM CST   54 of 65\nSeventh Circuit were to reverse this court's June 23, 2010 order. (See 625 at 3.) It has\nbeen almost thirty months since oral argument, and the Seventh Circuit has yet to\ndecide the Union's appeal. (See generally App. Case No. 10−2746 (docket) (oral\nargument held February 17, 2011).) In the meantime, the TA has continued his efforts\nto bring the JTDC into compliance with the underlying consent decrees previously\nentered in this case. In his April 2013 report to this court 686 , the TA has focused on\nthe final steps necessary to facilitate the transition of the JTDC to the Office of the\nChief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County. This court is concerned, based on\narguments presented by the Union nearly three years ago, that \"[i]f the Court of\nAppeals disapproves the requalification plan after the TA carries out these\nterminations and hands over control of the JTDC to the Chief Judge of the Circuit\nCourt of Cook County... the affected employees will have no remedy against the Chief\nJudge.\" ( 617 at 2.)

Plaintiffs commenced this civil rights action in the District Court for the \nNorthern District of Illinois Eastern Division on June 15, 1999, seeking declaratory and \ninjunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress alleged violations of the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs alleged \nthat practices and conditions at JTDC deprived them of adequate medical, dental, and \nmental health care services, denied them sufficient access to educational programs, and \nsubjected them to violence, abuse, neglect, and unfair discipline.  The defendants deny \nthat they have violated plaintiffs' constitutional rights. \n2.  On December 22, 1999, this Court certified a plaintiff class in this case \nconsisting of all persons who have been, are, or will be confined at the JTDC. \n3.  The parties engaged in substantial discovery, including the production of \nthousands of documents, depositions of JTDC staff members and County officials, and \ninspections ofthe JTDC by plaintiffs' retained experts in medical care, mental health \nservices, sanitation and enviromnental health, education and institutional management. \nThese inspections included interviews with juveniles and staff, examination of hundreds \n;:: \nof pages of policies, procedures and records, and observation ofthe physical condition of \nthe JTDC.  Copies of the reports of two of the experts, relating to medical services and \n2 \n\nenvironmental health, are attached hereto as Exhibits 5 and 6.  The parties reached a \ntentative settlement before the remaining experts' reports were completed. \n4.  The parties spent several months negotiating the proposed resolution of \nthis case under the supervision of Magistrate Judge Ashmann.  Those negotiations have \nresulted in the parties' execution of the Agreement, attached as Exhibit 1. \n5.  The Agreement addresses all of the major issues in the Complaint, \nrequiring that defendants house residents in an environment that is safe, clean, and free \nfrom excessive and unfair discipline, and that defendants provide plaintiffs with adequate \ncare and services, including adequate food, medical services, mental health care, and \nreasonable access to educational services.  The Agreement mandates that defendants \ndevelop an Implementation Plan detailing the specific actions necessary to comply with \neach provision of the Agreement.  The Agreement also provides for the section of one or \nmore independent and impartial monitors to evaluate compliance and assist in resolving \ndisputes between the parties.  The Court will retain jurisdiction ofthis case to enforce the \nterms of the Agreement.  In addition, the Agreement provides that defendants will pay \nplaintiffs' counsel for reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses, but it leaves the \nspecific amount of those fees, costs, and expenses to be agreed to by the parties or \ndetermined by the Court. \n6.  The parties and their counsel believe that the proposed resolution of this \n\\ \ncase is within the range offair, reasonable and adequate resolutions. \n7.  The parties agree that the Agreement extends no further than necessary to \naddress the constitutional violations that plaintiffs have alleged and fully complies with \nthe requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3626. \n3 \n\n8.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), the parties ask this Court to set a fairness \nhearing, direct that notice of the hearing be given to the class, and establish a schedule for \nt \nsubmission of any written objections.  A proposed Order for these purposes is attached as \nExhibit 3. \n9.  The parties propose that the form of the notice attached as Exhibit 2 be \nused and that the class be notified as follows:  Defendants will post this notice \nconspicuously in all of the sections at the JTDS where class members are housed. \nDefendants will give notice individually to juveniles whose access to these locations is \nrestricted.  The notice shall be posted for at least four weeks beginning one week after the \nCourt grants preliminary approval ofthe proposed settlement or such other time as set by \nthe Court.  Defendants will provide pens, paper, stamps, and envelopes for any juvenile at \nthe JTDC who wishes to write the Court or plaintiffs' counsel concerning the settlement. \nDefendants also will mail or hand deliver notice to the parent or guardian of every \njuvenile housed at the JTDC between October 9 and November 6, 2002.  Parties will mail \na copy of the notice to the advocacy groups and interested listed in Exhibit 7.  In addition, \na shorter version of the notice appropriate for publication will be published, at defendants \nexpense, in the Chicago Tribune, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, and the \nDaily Law Bulletin. \n10.  The parties further proposed that persons wishing to participate in the \nfairness hearing, or to comment on the proposed resolution, be requested to file written \nsubmissions with the Court at least two weeks prior to the fairness hearing and to serve \nsuch documents on counsel for the parties. \n4 \n\nII.  After notice has been given and the time for comment on the proposed \nsettlement agreement has expired, the parties ask that the Court hold a fairness hearing \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e) to evaluate whether the Court should approve the \nsettlement. \nWHEREFORE, the parties request that this Court enter an Order: (1) making a \npreliminary determination that the settlement as embodied in the Agreement, attached as \nExhibit I, is within the range of fair, adequate and reasonable settlements; (2) approving \nthe form of proposed notice to the Plaintiff class of the hearing on the adequacy of the \nproposed settlement, attached as Exhibit 2; (3) enter the proposed Order attached as \nExhibit 3, setting a hearing at which the Court may determine the adequacy of the \nproposed settlement and setting the requirement for written comments; and (4) after the \nhearing, enter the proposed Order, attached as Exhibit 4. \nRespectfully submitted, \nBEN  INS.

The   \ndistinction  is,  to  put  it  mildly,  not  a  novel  one,  and \ncertainly  one  that  we  must  assume  that  Congress \nunderstood  in  crafting  the  present  provisions  of  the \nB. \nPLRA.

The court approved the emergency \nmotion over the Union’s objection, later amending it to the Union’s satisfaction. In its order granting the emergency motion, the \ncourt required a report by the Transitional Administrator “on the conditions and status of the issues raised” in the emergency \nmotion. R.415 at 4. In the second of such reports, the Transitional Administrator included his proposed staffing plan. The court \napproved the report over the Union’s objection, resulting in the present appeal. \n \n4  Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 738, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted); Swann v. \nCharlotte–Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). \n \n \n5  My colleagues find fault with the district court’s resolution of the question of the Union’s right to bargain as a matter of state \nlaw. The district court’s decision was based on its assessment of the limited arguments put before it. That is, it had determined \n \nthat state law required application of a fact-specific balancing inquiry and stated that the Union had “fail[ed] to address in \npractical terms the anticipated benefits of bargaining.” R.589 at 11. The Transitional Administrator, on the other hand, “ha[d] \ngone through great efforts to explain the particular reasons for and policies underlying his decision ... and how these standards \nrelate to his court-mandated mission.” Id. at 12. The court noted that “it is undisputed that approximately half of the JTDC’s \ncurrent residents are housed in units structured on the old JTDC ‘system’—a system that was to be ‘restructured’ by court order.” \nId. (citation omitted). Only then, after stating that the Union had not shown specific benefits of bargaining and that the \ncountervailing interests were great, did it conclude that “the benefits of bargaining do not outweigh the burdens” and thus there \nwas no state law right. Id. In my view, this conclusion is not about the need for speed and flexibility as an overriding justification, \nbut about a failure of the Union to present the court with sufficient alternate considerations to be balanced. \n \n6  Whether a consent decree involving prisons always requires, as a prerequisite to the entry of a remedy, a judicial finding of an \nactual constitutional violation even when the parties do not request such a finding is a very difficult question, one that we ought \n \nto approach only in a case where resolution is absolutely necessary and where the matter has been briefed fully by the parties to \nthe litigation. While a case can be made that the PLRA requires such a judicial finding, see Deborah Decker, Consent Decrees and \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Usurping Judicial Power or Quelling Judicial Micro–Management?, 1997 Wisc. L.Rev. \n1275, 1278; see also, e.g., Plyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d 365, 370 (4th Cir.1996) (deciding the question sub silentio in the context of a \nproceeding under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(b)(2)), the question becomes a great deal more difficult when we remember that such a \nrequirement would, as a practical matter, make the whole idea of a consent decree superfluous. Consent decrees are sought by \ndefendants, especially state and local defendants, to permit the implementation of a remedy without an admission or judicial \nfinding of liability, an admission or finding with dire collateral consequences for state and municipal defendants. If, as the \nSupreme Court has admonished in Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S. 493, 131 S.Ct. 1910, 179 L.Ed.2d 969 (2011), we ought to be hesitant \nin interpreting the PLRA to attribute to Congress a motivation in the PLRA to leave prisoners without a remedy for violations of \nrights protected by the Constitution, we ought to be equally careful not to attribute to that body the motivation to make illusory \nthe one mechanism by which both incarcerated individuals and local governments can resolve such litigation relatively \nexpeditiously and inexpensively while maintaining a good deal of control in local hands. \n \n8 \n \n\nDoe v.

Currently pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' Petition to Enforce \nMemorandum of Agreement filed on November 8, 2005. On January 11,2006, this Court \nrequested the parties to utilize the services of Michael J. Mahoney and Chatles A. Fasano, the \nmonitors appointed in this case by the Court (\"Monitors\"), to mediate the issues raised in the \nPetition. The parties, through their counsel, and the Monitors have met and conferred at length \non this matter. As a result of these mediation efforts, the parties have agreed to the entry of this \nAgreed Supplemental Order (\"ASO\"). \n2.  The primary objective oft his ASO is to ensure that the Cook County Juvenile \nTemporary Detention Center (\"JTDC\") is in substantial compliance with the Memorandum of \nAgreement (\"MOA\") approved by the Court on December 30, 2002. In accordance with this \nASO, the Defendants ate required to be in substantial compliance with the MOA within eight \n(8) months of the entry of the ASO. \n\nCase 1:99-cv-03945  Document 129-2  Filed 05/17/2006  Page 3 of 11 \n3.  The ASO is supplemental to the MOA, which shall remain in full force and \neffect, with the exception of the modification provided for in paragraph 16 herein. \nTerms of the Agreed Supplemental Order \n4.  Within sixty (60) days of the entry of the ASO, the Monitors, together with the \nindividuals identified in paragraph 5 below, shall present a modified Implementation Plan \n(\"MIP\") to the parties for their consideration. The MIP will be designed to bring the JTDC \ninto substantial compliance with the MOA and shall identiry with sufficient particularity the \nactions to be taken by the Defendants to achieve substantial compliance with the MOA within \nsix (6) months following the final approval of the MIP by the Monitors. The MIP shall include \na compliance schedule that will set forth specific periodic benchmarks to measure progress \ntoward achieving substantial compliance with the MOA. Following presentation of the \nMIP to the parties, the parties shall have seven (7) days to submit any comments or objections \nthey may have to the MIP to the Monitors. Seven (7) days thereafter, and with due \nconsideration of the parties' comments, the Monitors shall make appropriate revisions to and \napprove the final contents of the MIP. \n5.  In order to assist the Monitors with the obligations required of them under \nthe ASO, including their obligations referred to in paragraph 4, the Monitors, with the \nagreement of the parties, have decided to retain the professional services of Dr. David \nRoush, Carl Sanniti, Dr. Louis Kraus, and Dr. Michael Cohen (Monitors' \"designee(s)\"). \n6.  In order to prepare the MIP, the Monitors and their designees shall evaluate \nthe conditions and services at the ITOC and shall consult as appropriate with Cook County \nofficials and employees, counsel for the parties, and residents of the JTDC.  The Monitors and \n2 \n\nCase 1: 99-cv-03945  Document 129-2  Filed 05/17/2006  Page 4 of 11 \ntheir designees, upon request by the parties, shall provide the parties with the infonnation \nobtained through their evaluations and consultations. \n7.  The Monitors, their designees, and the Compliance Administrator described in \nParagraph 9 below, shall have reasonably prompt access to the staff and residents of the JTDC \nto penn it them to carry-out their duties under the ASO.  The Monitors, their designees, and the \nCompliance Administrator shall also have reasonable access to documents or other \ninfonnation that are relevant to the discharge of their duties. The  Monitors, their designees, \nand the Compliance Administrator shall have the authority to collect infonnation and to meet \nwith the parties, their counsel, JTOC personnel and private contractors granted to the Monitors \npursuant to Paragraphs 60 and 64 of the MOA. The Monitors shall provide to counsel for the \nparties copies of all reports, records, correspondence and any other documents prepared, \nsubmitted or received by them, their designees, and the Compliance Administrator. Nothing in \nthis paragraph shall be construed as a waiver ofthe Defendants' rights to object to the release \nof any infonnation protected by privilege.  Any confidential infonnation provided under this \nparagraph will be governed by the tenns of the protective orders entered in this case. \n8.  The Defendants shall implement the MW within the timeframes provided for \ntherein. The Defendants shall fully implement the MIP and shall also be in substantial \ncompliance with the MOA within six (6) months of final approval of the MIP.  If, for good \ncause, unanticipated events prevent the Defendants from achieving substantial compliance \nwithin the specified time period, the Defendants may utilize the procedures set forth in \nparagraph 9(a) below by requesting mediation to extend the timeframes and, if necessary, by \npresenting the Defendants' request to extend the time period to this Court for consideration. \n3 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-03945  Document 129-2  Filed 05/17/2006  Page 5 of 11 \n9.  By May 24,2006, the parties and the Monitors jointly will submit to the \nCourt the name of a proposed Compliance Administrator. \n(a) The Compliance Administrator shall provide day-to-day, on-site coordination \nof efforts to bring the JTDC into compliance with the MIP and the MOA. The \nCompliance Administrator shall consult directly with the Superintendent of the JTDC and \nmake necessary recommendations concerning the manner in which Defendants should \nproceed to fully implement the MIP and substantially comply with the MOA. Should the \nSuperintendent choose not to accept and implement a material recommendation by the \nCompliance Administrator, the Superintendent shall provide in writing the reasons for \nrejecting the recommendation and proposed alternatives to the Compliance \nAdministrator, the Monitors and the parties.  If the Compliance Administrator disagrees \nwith the Superintendent's position, he/she shall submit written justification for the \nrecommendation to the Superintendent and may request that the Monitors serve as \nmediators concerning this disagreement.  Defendants shall bear the cost of all mediation \nservices.  Plaintiffs shall have notice of and an opportunity to participate in any \nmediation.  In the event that mediation results in an agreement between the \nSuperintendent and the Compliance Administrator concerning an appropriate course of \naction, that agreement will be enforceable as part of the MIP.  If after fifteen days any \nparty or the Compliance Administrator believes that the issue or issues have not been \nresolved adequately by mediation, the issue or issues may be presented to the Court for \nresolution by either party. \n(b)  The Monitors and Compliance Administrator shall report to the Court and \nthe parties at least every 30 days on the status of their work including all \n4 \n\nCase 1: 99-cv-03945  Document 129-2  Filed 05/17/2006  Page 6 of 11 \nrecommendations made by the Compliance Administrator and the response of the \nDefendants to those recommendations.  The Court shall terminate the appointment of the \nCompliance Administrator upon a showing of substantial compliance with the MIP and \nthe MOA. \n10.  Within 21 days of the entry of the ASO, the staff members identified \nunder separate confidential exhibit, who have been alleged to have engaged, on more \nthan one occasion, in conduct constituting physical abuse of a class member will receive \nintensified training and counseling through the JTDC with a curriculum approved by \nMonitors.  These individuals will not be assigned to work on a housing unit or in a \nposition requiring direct resident contact until they have completed the training and \ncounseling described herein.  Additionally, the specific staff members identified in the \nseparate confidential exhibit having a higher number of allegations of alleged abuse will \nalso be the subject of a program, approved by the Monitors, of increased supervisory \nmonitoring and oversight upon reassignment following completion oftheir training and \ncounseling.  The procedures set forth in this paragraph are of an interim nature and do not \nreplace the Defendants' obligations to timely investigate and institute remedial measures \nwhen allegations of excessive force are made by residents. \nThe Defendants along with the Monitors have met with representatives of the \nIllinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to review existing JTDC \nprotocols for reporting alleged cases of abuse or neglect to DCFS.  Defendants will \namend the existing protocols to address any material deficiencies identified in this \nprocess.  Any such changes will be approved by the Monitors.  Defendants agree to \n5 \n\nCase 1: 99-cv-03945  Document 129-2  Filed 05/17/2006  Page 7 of 11 \ncooperate with any request by DCFS to reinvestigate any cases of alleged abuse or \nneglect that were not accepted by the DCFS hotline. \nII.  Within 75 days of the entry of the ASO, the Defendants will transfer direct \nand full authority and control over all health, dental and mental health services at the \nJTDC - including authority and control over all related policies, personnel, budgets and \nresources - to the Cook County Bureau of Health Services.  If, due to unforeseen \ncircumstances, the transfer of authority is delayed, the Defendants may request an \nextension of this deadline by presenting the issue to the Monitors.  If an extension is \nreasonably warranted, the Monitors shall extend the deadline by an appropriate period of \ntime to enable the Defendants to complete the transfer of authority. \n12.  The Monitors shall remain vested with the authority, duties, \nresponsibilities, and entitled to reasonable compensation, as set forth in the MOA. \nAdditionally, the Monitors shall submit to this Court, with copies to the parties, written \nreports describing the status of Defendants' efforts to implement the MIP at least every 60 \ndays following their approval of the MIP. The Monitors, Compliance Administrator and \nSuperintendent shall meet at least on a monthly basis with counsel for the parties to review the \nstatus of implementation and to obtain the comments of the parties. In evaluating \nimplementation ofthe MIP, the Monitors may utilize their discretion to request the assistance \nof any persons with knowledge suitable to analyze the conditions and practices at the JIDC. \nNothing herein is intended to preclude the Defendants from seeking assistance from any other \nagency/organization in the provision of and improvement of services provided by the JIDC. \n13.  The Monitors shall continue to be responsible for monitoring and \nenforcing compliance with the MOA and shall continue to have the authority, duties, and \n6 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-03945  Document 129-2  Filed 05/17/2006  Page 8 of 11 \nresponsibilities as set forth therein. In addition, the Monitors shall be responsible for \nmonitoring and enforcing compliance with the MIP and ASO. The Plaintiffs shall also have \nthe authority, duties, and responsibilities as set forth in the MOA for monitoring and enforcing \ncompliance with the MOA.  Additionally, the Plaintiffs shall be responsible for monitoring \nand enforcing compliance with the MIP and ASO.  The Plaintiffs and Defendants agree to \ncooperate with the Monitors and each other in this process.  Without further leave of court, \nthe parties, at any time during the eight (8) month period set fourth in paragraph 4 above, may \ntake discovery as provided for under the Fed.R.Civ.P., directed toward the issues of \ncompliance with the MIP, ASO, and MOA. Counsel for all parties shall receive notice of and \nshall be allowed to be present during all inspections or surveys of the JTOC by the Monitors or \ntheir designees. \n14.  The Defendants shall, subject to approval oft he Court, ensure the reasonable \ncompensation of the Monitors' designees and the Compliance Administrator at their usual and \ncustomary rate. The Defendants shall also reimburse the Monitors' designees and the \nCompliance Administrator for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in the course of \ntheir work pursuant to the ASO. All reasonable compensation and reimbursement requests \nsubmitted pursuant to this paragraph will be promptly reviewed by the State's Attorney's \nOffice and submitted to the Court within 45 days for approval. Once Court approval is \nobtained, the requests for compensation and/or reimbursements will be promptly submitted by \nthe State's Attorney's Office to the Cook County Board for approval for payment and payment \nshall be made within 60 days of Court approval. \n7 \n\nCase 1:99-cv-03945  Document 129-2  Filed 05/17/2006  Page 9 of 11 \n15.  The Monitors, their designees, and the Compliance Administrator shall be \navailable at the request of either party or the Court to testify at any evidentiary hearing to \nevaluate compliance with the MIP, ASO or MOA. \n16.  Due to the new time frames and procedures described in this ASO, the \nCourt, with the agreement of the parties, finds it appropriate to modify the timeframes in \nParagraph 66 of the MOA.  Paragraph 66 of the MOA is modified as provided in the \nAttachment to this ASO. \n17.  In consideration of the parties' agreement set forth herein, the Plaintiffs' \nPetition to Enforce the MOA is stayed for a period ofe ight (8) months following the entry of \nthe ASO.  Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the parties during that eight (8) month \nperiod from seeking other or further relief including but not limited to enforcement ofthe \nMIP, ASO, and/or the MOA. \n18.  The Court retains jurisdiction of this matter for all purposes, including \nmodification oft he ASO and to enter any additional orders necessary to enforce the ASO and \nthe MOA.  This ASO does not resolve Plaintiffs' claims to fees, costs and expenses \nincurred since entry of the MOA.  In the event the parties are unable to resolve those \nclaims by agreement, Plaintiffs may file a motion for an award offees, costs and \nexpenses pursuant to the Local Rules ofthe Northern District of Illinois within 120 days \nof the entry ofthe ASO.  Defendants have reserved their right to object to any motion \nseeking an award of fees, costs and expenses. \nrg \nnited States District Judge \nDated:~ :&06 \n8 \n\n-------------------~--.--\nCase 1: 99-cv-03945  Document 129-2  Filed 05/17/2006  Page 10 of 11 \nAttachment \n66.  The following procedures will govern termination of this Agreement: \na.  Defendants' Right to Review of the Agreement After March 1,2009 \nAt any time after March 1,2009, if defendants believe they have substantially \ncomplied with the terms of this Agreement for at least one year, they shall notifY the \nplaintiffs in writing of their desire to terminate this Agreement (\"Termination Notice\"). \nPlaintiffs' counsel will have an opportunity to conduct reasonable discovery concerning \nfactual issues relevant to the determination of compliance.  If plaintiffs wish to oppose \ntermination of this Agreement, plaintiffs must file a motion in this Court within 90 days \nfrom the date plaintiffs received defendants' Termination Notice.  This Agreement shall \nremain in effect until the Court resolves that motion.  Plaintiffs shall have the burden of \ndemonstrating that the defendants have not remained in substantial compliance with the \nterms of this Agreement for a period of one year.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be \ninterpreted to compel defendants to file a Termination Notice. \nb.

      "text": "Order Form (01/2005)\nUnited States District Court, Northern District of Illinois\nName of Assigned Judge James F. Holderman Sitting Judge if Other\nor Magistrate Judge than Assigned Judge\nCASE NUMBER 99 C 3945 DATE 8/23/2010\nCASE Jimmy Doe, et al. vs. Cook County, et al.\nTITLE\nDOCKET ENTRY TEXT\nFor the reasons set forth in the Statement section of this order, “Intervenor’s Motion to Certify Court’s June\n23, 2010 Order as Final and Appealable Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)” [590] is granted.  The court certifies its\nJune 23, 2010 Order [589] as a final judgment that the Transitional Administrator’s proposed staffing plan\ndoes not (1) exceed the scope of the TA’s mandate; (2) impermissibly interfere with the state law bargaining\nrights of affected employees; (3) violate the affected employees’ due process rights; or (4) violate the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act.\nO[ For further details see text below.] Notices mailed.\nSTATEMENT\nOn June 23, 2010, this court entered a memorandum opinion and order approving the Transitional\nAdministrator’s (“TA”) proposed staffing plan for the four new “Centers” to be created from the remaining\nliving units at the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center (“JTDC”).  (Dkt. No. 589.)  Intervenor Teamsters\nLocal 700 (the “Union”) now seeks certification of the court’s June 23, 2010 Order as final and appealable\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).  Rule 54(b) states:\nWhen an action presents m ore than one claim for relief—whether as a claim , counterclaim,\ncrossclaim, or third-party claim—or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry\nof a final judgment as to one or m ore, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court\nexpressly determines that there is no just reasonf or delay.  Otherwise, any order or other decision,\nhowever designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities o ffewer\nthan all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised\nat any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties’ rights\nand liabilities.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\nAt the outset, this court must determine whether it has jurisdiction over the Union’s pending Rule\n54(b) motion.  Seven days after filing its motion, the Union filed notice that it was appealing the June 23,\n2010 Order to the Seventh Circuit.  (Dkt. No. 595.)  “The filing of a notice of appeal is an event of\njurisdictional significance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.”  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459\n99C3945 Jimmy Doe, et al. vs. Cook County, et al. Page 1 of  3\n\nSTATEMENT\nU.S. 56, 58 (1982).  The purpose of this bright line rule is to avoid any “danger [that] a district court and a\ncourt of appeals would be simultaneously analyzing the same judgment.”  Id. at 59.  Recognizing this general\nconcern, the Seventh Circuit has found the “potential for conflict between the district court and the court of\nappeals” to be virtually non-existent in cases such as this one, explicitly holding that district courts “have\npower to add a Rule 54(b) certification to an order after the filing of a notice of appeal.”  Local P-171,\nAmalgamated Meat Cutters & Butcher Workmen of N. Am. v. Thompson Farms Co., 642 F.2d 1065, 1074-75\n(7th Cir. 1981).  Accordingly, this court proceeds to consider the merits of the Union’s motion.  \nWhen reviewing a motion brought under Rule 54(b), this court “must first determine that it is dealing\nwith a <final judgment’ . . . [and then] go on to determine whether there is any just reason for delay.” \nCurtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 446 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1980).  In this context, “judgment” means “a\ndecision upon a cognizable claim for relief.”  Id. at 7.  A judgment is considered “final” if it is “an ultimate\ndisposition of an individual claim entered in the course of a multiple claims action.”  Id. (quoting Sears,\nRoebuck & Co. v. Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 436 (1956)). \nIn cases of “institutional reform litigation” in which the court has ordered “extensive injunctive\nrelief” in the form of a consent decree, courts will treat the postjudgment proceeding “as if it were a\nfree-standing lawsuit” for purposes of identifying a final appealable judgment.  Bogard v. Wright, 159 F.3d\n1060, 1062 (7th Cir. 1998).  However, this task is complicated when the underlying consent decree has no set\ntermination date, and postjudgment appeals in such cases are generally limited to orders “granting,\nmodifying, denying, refusing, continuing, dissolving, or refusing to modify or dissolve” the consent decree. \nId. at 1062-63 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1)).  Postjudgment orders that interpret injunctions are not\nappealable under § 1292(a)(1), “provided they really are interpretative, and do not change the meaning\nof—that is, modify—the original injunction.”  Assoc. of Cmty. Orgs. for Reform Now (ACORN) v. Ill. State\nBd. of Elections, 75 F.3d 304, 306 (7th Cir. 1996).  Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit has recognized that\n“interim” postjudgment orders may be appealable if they otherwise “meet[ ] the criteria for the appealability\nof interlocutory orders.”  Id.; see also Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Auth., 178 F.3d 951, 956 (7th Cir.\n1999).\nAs an intervenor in this lawsuit, the Union has asserted a cognizable claim for relief from the TA’s\nproposed staffing plan on the grounds that the plan exceeds the TA’s authority and violates state, federal, and\nconstitutional law.  This court rejected the Union’s claim for relief in its June 23, 2010 Order and approved\nthe TA’s proposed staffing plan in its entirety.  The court’s rejection of the Union’s claim was dispositive of\nthe legal issues raised by the Union and, therefore, final.  As articulated by the Union in its pending motion,\n“the TA can now implement his plan, and the Union, having fully argued and briefed its objections, has no\nfurther recourse in the district court regarding that plan.”  (Dkt. No. 590 ¶ 5.)\nThe Union’s claim regarding the TA’s proposed staffing plan is also separable from any other claims\nremaining to be adjudicated in this lawsuit, insofar as these claims share “minimal factual overlap.” \nContinental Cas. Co. v. Anderson Excavating & Wrecking Co., 189 F.3d 512, 516 (7th Cir. 1999).  At this\npoint in the litigation, the only remaining question of law before this court is whether the TA has succeeded\nin bringing the JTDC into substantial compliance with the Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”), the Agreed\nSupplemental Order (“ASO”), and the Modified Implementation Plan (“MIP”), such that these postjudgment\nproceedings can be properly brought to a close and administrative authority over the JTDC can be transferred\nto the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County.  The questions of law raised by the\nUnion regarding the TA’s authority to implement his proposed staffing plan share no overlapping facts or\nlegal analysis in common with this ultimate determination.  \n99C3945 Jimmy Doe, et al. vs. Cook County, et al. Page 2 of  3\n\nSTATEMENT\nOf course, as long as this litigation remains pending it is possible that the Union might raise\nadditional concerns regarding the TA’s actions—including concerns about the manner in which the TA’s\nproposed staffing plan is carried out in practice.  But these fact-specific concerns, should they arise, would be\ndistinguishable from the overarching question of whether the TA has the legal authority to create new job\ndescriptions at the JTDC and to require incumbent workers to “reapply” for these new positions as a matter\nof managerial policy.  Similarly, even if the Union were to argue at some point in the future that the TA was\nnot abiding by his agreement to bargain over “the length of time [otherwise qualified workers] have to obtain\ndegrees and what assistance is available to help them do so,” this court would not be revisiting any issues\nalready decided in the June 23, 2010 Order.  (See June 23, 2010 Order at 10 n.4 (finding that no question of\n“effects bargaining” under Illinois law was before the court).)  Accordingly, this court finds that “no\nappellate court would have to decide the same issues more than once even if there were subsequent appeals.” \nCurtiss-Wright Corp., 446 U.S. at 8.\nFinally, the court considers whether there is any just reason for delay of the Union’s appeal.  In its\nJune 23, 2010 Order, this court recognized “the reasonableness of the Union’s speculation that some\nterminations <will invariably follow’ implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan.”  (June 23, 2010\nOrder at 13.)  Without an opportunity for appeal, the June 23, 2010 Order is likely to lead to “irrevocable\nconsequences” of the type that “could not be undone when (if ever) the postjudgment proceeding ended with\na showing of compliance.”  Bogard, 159 F.3d at 1063.  This potentiality is especially concerning in light of\nthe fact that the Union was not a party to any of the consent decrees that have led to the TA’s proposed\nstaffing plan.  On the other hand, this court is also cognizant of “the TA’s need for speed and flexibility” in\n“attempting to bring the JTDC into substantial compliance with the MOA and other court orders.”  (June 23,\n2010 Order at 12.)  For three years, the TA has operated under the mandate to “restructure” the JTDC, and\nthe Union’s appeal would inevitably impede this process.  The courts, too, have an interest in avoiding “an\navalanche of interlocutory appeals” in “complex and protracted” proceedings to enforce consent decrees. \nBogard, 159 F.3d at 1063.  In this eleven-year-old case, which throughout the bulk of its existence was\npresided over by Judge John Nordberg, the parties have represented to the court that the implementation of\nthe TA’s proposed staffing plan is the final major effort needed to bring the JTDC into substantial\ncompliance with the MOA, ASO, and MIP.  Appellate review of the TA’s proposed staffing plan may very\nwell have the effect of beginning the process of bringing this litigation to a close.  Considering all of these\nfactors, the court finds that the equities lie in favor of granting the Union’s Rule 54(b) request.\nFor the reasons set forth above, the court hereby certifies its June 23, 2010 Order as a final judgment\nthat the Transitional Administrator’s proposed staffing plan does not (1) exceed the scope of the TA’s\nmandate; (2) impermissibly interfere with the state law bargaining rights of affected employees; (3) violate\nthe affected employees’ due process rights; or (4) violate the Prison Litigation Reform Act. \n99C3945 Jimmy Doe, et al. vs. Cook County, et al.

HOLDERMAN, Chief Judge:\nPending before the court is the “Second Report of the Transitional Administrator\nPursuant to the Court’s May 8, 2008 Order” (Dkt. No. 530 (the “Second Report”)), which\noutlines progress made by the Transitional Administrator (“TA”) in his efforts to bring the Cook\nCounty Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (“JTDC”) into substantial compliance with earlier\ncourt orders.  \nThe plaintiff class (“Plaintiffs”), the defendants (collectively referred to as “Cook\nCounty”), and the intervenor Teamsters Local Union No. 7001 (the “Union”) generally do not\nobject to the benchmarks and updates set forth in the TA’s Second Report.  However, the Union\n1 “Intervenor’s Agreed Motion for Substitution of Party” (Dkt. No. 584) is granted and\nTeamsters Local Union No. 700 is hereby substituted for Teamsters Local Union No. 714 for\npurposes of this litigation.\n1\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 2 of 18 PageID #:4602\nhas objected to the TA’s proposal to create new job descriptions for direct care workers at the\nJTDC and has objected to the TA’s proposal to require incumbent direct care workers to\n“reapply” for these new positions.  For the reasons set forth below, the court after full\nconsideration of the matter approves the TA’s proposed staffing plan in its entirety.  \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nThis class action lawsuit was initially filed over ten years ago on June 15, 1999. \nAlthough the case was dismissed without prejudice in December 2002 pursuant to agreement by\nthe parties, the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the court-approved Memorandum of\nAgreement (“MOA”), the subsequent Agreed Supplemental Order (“ASO”), and the Modified\nImplementation Plan (“MIP”).  (See Dkt. Nos. 71, 136; see also Dkt No. 273, Ex. A (text of\nMOA), Ex. L (text of ASO), and Ex. I (text of MIP).)  \nOn August 16, 2007, the State of Illinois enacted legislation transferring administration\nof the JTDC from the executive branch of Cook County to the Office of the Chief Judge of the\nCircuit Court of Cook County (“OCJ”).  (See Illinois Public Act 95-0194 (effective January 1,\n2008).)  With the agreement of the parties, the court appointed the TA with the mandate “to\nbring the [JTDC] into substantial compliance with [the MOA, ASO, and MIP] and, if consistent\nwith Illinois law, to prepare the JTDC for the transition of administrative authority over its\noperations to the [OCJ].”  (Dkt. No. 330 (“Appointment Order”) ¶ 1.)  Currently, the TA remains\nengaged in this ongoing assignment, and the transfer of authority to the OCJ has yet to be\neffected.  \nIn April 2008, the TA sought emergency authorization to retain a private company to\nprovide temporary security staffing at the JTDC.  (Dkt. No. 389.)  Finding that “the JTDC is\n2\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 3 of 18 PageID #:4603\ndangerously understaffed and that, as a result of this understaffing, the health and safety of the\nresidents is at risk,” the court granted the TA’s emergency motion and ordered the TA to report\nin writing “on the conditions and status of the issues raised in the TA’s Emergency Motion”\nwithin six months.  (Dkt. No. 415 (“May 8, 2008 Order”) ¶¶ 3, 6.)  Accordingly, the TA filed his\nFirst Report in November 2008.  (Dkt. No. 458.)  The Second Report, now pending before the\ncourt, “expands upon the issues discussed in the first report and discusses other progress the\n[TA] has made toward compliance with all of the Court’s Orders.”  (Second Report at 2.)\nTHE SECOND REPORT\nSince the time of the TA’s First Report, the TA has implemented a plan to reorganize the\nJTDC around the creation of five new resident living “Centers.”  (Second Report at 4.)  Each\nCenter has approximately 50 beds, with more than 30 dedicated staff members who only perform\nwork in the Center to which they are assigned.  (Id.)  Prior to the implementation of the TA’s\nreorganization plan, the Juvenile Detention Counselors (“JDC”) who staffed the old living units\nat the JTDC were expected to perform “the same work one might expect of an adult jail guard . .\n. [ensuring that] residents were alive, fed, clothed, in one piece, and brought to court when\nnecessary.”  (Dkt. No. 557 (“TA’s Reply”) at 2.)  The JDCs who staff the new Centers “are\nexpected to actively engage JTDC residents at all times through implementation of a behavior\nmanagement program referred to as Cognitive Behavior Training (CBT).”  (Id. at 3.)  “The CBT\nprogram involves teaching JTDC residents a system of techniques to monitor thought patterns,\nrecognize the connections between thinking and behavior, and replace distorted thinking with\nrational thinking in order to foster more appropriate behavior” through group sessions and one-\non-one counseling.  (Id. (citing TA’s Ex. C (JTDC Behavior Mgmt. Program Staff Manual) at 6-\n3\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 4 of 18 PageID #:4604\n7); see also TA’s Ex. E (Proposed YDS Job Description) ¶¶ 3-7, 11.)  JDCs in the new Centers\nare also expected to respond appropriately to crisis situations, understand and follow JTDC\npolicies concerning the use of force and the use of restraints, engage in active observation of\nresident behaviors at all times, and competently complete all required written reports.  (Id. at 8-9\n(citing TA’s Ex. E ¶¶ 15-22).)\nIn light of some of the new job requirements expected of direct care workers in the\nCenters, the TA has adhered to a self-described “unparalleled and aggressive plan to hire and\ntrain new permanent employees” at the JTDC.  (Second Report at 3.)  Accordingly, all newly-\nhired staff members have completed a structured interview process that includes the use of a\n“multiple-choice, criterion based” assessment tool known as the “IMPACT” test.  (TA’s Reply at\n4, 10.)  The IMPACT test assesses skills and attitudes of direct care workers—testing for both\nhuman relations skills and basic literacy levels—and “is widely used and accepted in the juvenile\ndetention field.”  (Id. at 9-11.)  The TA has also ensured that all new hires meet a minimum\neducation requirement, holding at least a bachelor’s degree.2  New hires who are in direct and\ncontinuous contact with JTDC residents have also received a minimum of 160 hours of training\n2  This requirement complies with the minimum education requirements set forth by the\nAdministrative Office of the Illinois Courts (“AOIC”) in its “Policies Governing Hiring,\nPromotion and Training of Illinois Probation/Court Services Personnel,” which require all non-\nsupervisory personnel to hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university.  (Dkt.\nNo. 567 (“Pls.’ Reply”) Ex. B.)  The parties dispute whether the AOIC minimum education\nrequirements will apply to incumbent direct care workers at the JTDC when the OCJ assumes\nadministrative responsibility for the JTDC.  This court believes that the AOIC has spoken, but\nthat this court need not address the issue at this point in the litigation, as the TA has taken the\nposition that “a bachelor’s degree is an appropriate minimum standard for a person in a position\ninvolving direct and continuous contact with JTDC residents” regardless of whether the AOIC\nminimum education requirement specifically applies to these employees.  (Second Report at 17;\nsee also TA’s Reply at 6.) \n4\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 5 of 18 PageID #:4605\nin a newly-created JTDC Training Academy, as well as 80 hours of leadership training in a\ncourse prepared for the JTDC by the National Partnership for Juvenile Services and the National\nJuvenile Detention Association.  (Second Report at 3-4.)  Approximately 70 incumbent staff\nmembers also participated in an intensive full-time training program in preparation for the\nopening of two new Centers in August 2009.  (Id. at 5.)  It is the TA’s goal to ensure that the\nnew JTDC Centers are staffed by “qualified, trained professionals who have skills to work with\ntroubled and behaviorally-challenged children.”  (TA’s Reply at 3.)\nAs the TA endeavors to transition the remaining living units of the JTDC into four new\nCenters, the TA has proposed a plan to ensure that the incumbent employees who will staff the\nJTDC Centers meet the same standards being applied to newly-hired staff members.  First, the\nTA proposes eliminating the positions of JDC and Recreation Worker, and creating the new\npositions of Youth Development Specialist (“YDS”), Youth Development Specialist Associate\n(“YDSA”), and Recreation Specialist.  (See Second Report at 18; TA’s Attachments A, B, and\nC.)  The proposed job descriptions for the YDS and YDSA positions mirror the current duties\nand expectations of the JDCs who now staff the newly-established Centers.  (TA’s Reply at 4;\nsee also TA’s Ex. E.)  Additionally, these new positions would require completion of the same\nscreening, testing, and interviewing processes currently applied to the JTDC’s new hires—with\nthe exception that YDSAs need not hold a bachelor’s degree at time of hire, and can instead meet\nthe minimum education requirement by agreeing to complete a bachelor’s degree within a certain\nperiod of time to be negotiated with the Union.  (Second Report at 18.)  Under the TA’s\nproposed staffing plan, incumbent staff will also be required to pass the IMPACT test, after\nwhich they will be interviewed by “a panel consisting of a bargaining unit representative, a\n5\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 6 of 18 PageID #:4606\nsupervisor, and an independent consultant.”  (TA’s Reply at 5 (citing TA’s Attachment B\n(“Overview of JTDC [Proposed] Hiring Process”).)  YDSAs would remain at the same salary\nlevel until the completion of their degree.  (Second Report at 18.)  After the new positions are in\nplace, all veteran staff members currently in the position of JDC or Recreation Worker will be\ninvited to apply for a position as a YDS, YDSA, or Recreation Specialist while they continue in\ntheir present position at their current rate of pay.  (Second Report at 18; TA’s Reply at 5.) \nFinally, the JDC and Recreation Worker positions will be eliminated once the new Centers are\nfully staffed.  (TA’s Reply at 4.)\nThe TA estimates that there are approximately 230 JTDC incumbent employees who\nwould be affected by the TA’s proposed staffing plan, and that 180 of these employees “are not\ndegreed and [would] stand to lose their jobs” if the AOIC minimum education requirements were\nto be enforced without accommodation.  (Second Report at 16.)   \nANALYSIS\n1.  Scope of the TA’s Mandate\nThe Union’s first objection to the TA’s proposed staffing plan is that it exceeds the scope\nof the TA’s mandate.  The scope of any consent decree “must be discerned within its four\ncorners.”  Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 574 (1984) (quoting United\nStates v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681-82 (1971)).  As set forth above, at the time of his\nappointment, the TA was given “the authority and responsibility to bring the Cook County\nJuvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) into substantial compliance with the\nMemorandum of Agreement (MOA), the Agreed Supplemental Order (ASO), and the Modified\nImplementation Plan (MIP).”  (Appointment Order ¶ 1.)  To this end, the court explicitly granted\n6\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 7 of 18 PageID #:4607\nthe TA “[t]he power to establish personnel policies; to create, abolish, or transfer positions; and\nto hire, terminate, promote, transfer, and evaluate management and staff of the JTDC.”  (Id. ¶\n6(c).)  At the time it was written, the Appointment Order recognized that the JTDC would need\nto be “restructure[d]” to bring it into substantial compliance with earlier court orders.  (Id. ¶\n5(b).)3  \nThe Union acknowledges the MOA requires “that future hiring conform to appropriate\nstandards [and] that incumbent staff receive adequate training.”  (Dkt. No. 544 (“Union’s Resp.”)\nat 2 (citing MOA at 10, ¶ 12).)  However, the Union argues that the TA’s plan “to force\nincumbent employees to requalify for employment” goes beyond the scope of “the MOA and its\nimplementing orders.”  (Dkt. No. 573 (“Union’s Final Reply”) at 3.)  It is the Union’s position\nthat “the TA’s authority and responsibility are limited . . . to bringing the JTDC into substantial\ncompliance with the MOA, ASO and MIP,” and that the Appointment Order did not itself\nexpand the TA’s mandate or authority beyond this scope.  (Id.) \nThe court respectfully disagrees with the Union’s position.  Like the MOA, ASO, and\nMIP, the Appointment Order was consented to by Plaintiffs and Cook County, and was approved\nby the court.  Unlike in Stotts, where “there is no mention of layoffs or demotions within the four\n3 The MOA specifically requires Cook County to “create and maintain a system which:\na. keeps residents reasonably safe, clean, and adequately housed and fed; \nb. provides for the prompt identification of the medical, dental, mental health\nand developmental needs of youth, and timely access to adequate medical,\nmental health, and developmental services;\nc. provides adequate social and recreational programming;\nd. provides due process of law to youth who are being disciplined;\ne. houses and disciplines youth in the least restrictive manner appropriate under\nthe circumstances; [and]\nf. provides [access to an adequate] education.”\n(MOA at 8, ¶ 7.) \n7\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 8 of 18 PageID #:4608\ncorners of the decree,” Stotts, 467 U.S. at 574, the Appointment Order explicitly authorizes the\nTA “to establish personnel policies; to create, abolish, or transfer positions; and to hire,\nterminate, promote, transfer, and evaluate management and staff of the JTDC.”  (Appointment\nOrder ¶ 6(c).)  The Appointment Order also explicitly states that it is “supplemental to the MOA,\nASO and MIP,” (id. ¶ 13), and there is nothing in the language of the Appointment Order to\nsuggest that the grant of authority set forth in Paragraph 6 is merely ornamental.  The language\nof the Appointment Order makes clear that Plaintiffs and Cook County intended that the TA\nshould have the power to create new positions at the JTDC, abolish old positions at the JTDC,\nand “hire, terminate, promote, transfer, and evaluate” JTDC staff in accordance with “personnel\npolicies” established with the aim of creating and maintaining the system described in the\noriginal MOA.  The TA’s proposed staffing plan is consistent with this grant of authority.      \nTo the extent the Appointment Order also explicitly requires the TA to exercise his\nauthority “in a manner consistent with the laws, policies and regulations of Cook County and the\nlaws of the State of Illinois,” unless this requirement is waived by the court (id. ¶ 5(f)), the court\naddresses the Union’s concerns below. \n2. The Union’s Collective Bargaining Rights\nThe Union next argues that “Illinois law mandates that an employer bargain over new\nemployment standards that require incumbent employees to reapply or requalify for\nemployment.”  (Union’s Resp. at 5.)  This argument is driven by the Union’s concern that the\nTA’s proposed staffing plan will result in a “wholesale replacement of incumbent staff,” insofar\nas the TA intends to “fir[e] employees whose work is admittedly satisfactory but who the TA’s\nstaff would not choose to rehire today.”  (Id. at 4.) \n8\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 9 of 18 PageID #:4609\nPursuant to the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (“IPLRA”), a public employer like the\nJTDC has a duty to engage in collective bargaining “over any matter with respect to wages,\nhours and other conditions of employment, not specifically provided for in any other law or not\nspecifically in violations of the provisions of any law.”  5 ILCS 315/7 (“Section 7”).  An\nemployer that “refuse[s] to bargain collectively in good faith with a labor organization which is\nthe exclusive representative of public employees in an appropriate unit” has engaged in an\n“unfair labor practice.”  5 ILCS 315/10(a)(4).  On the other hand, “[e]mployers shall not be\nrequired to bargain over matters of inherent managerial policy, which shall include such areas of\ndiscretion or policy as the functions of the employer, standards of services, its overall budget, the\norganizational structure and selection of new employees, examination techniques and direction\nof employees.”  5 ILCS 315/4 (“Section 4”).  \nIllinois courts have recognized that certain matters of inherent managerial policy can also\nimpact wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment.  See AFSCME, AFL-CIO v. State\nLabor Relations Bd., 546 N.E.2d 687, 691 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st Dist. 1989) (“Clearly tension exists\nbetween the two provisions; any managerial policy will have some impact on conditions of\nemployment.”)  In such “hybrid” situations, “the determination of whether the employer must\ncollectively bargain can only be resolved by weighing the benefits of bargaining with the\nburdens on management.”  Forest Pres. Dist. of Cook County v. Ill. Labor Relations Bd., 861\nN.E.2d 231, 247-48 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st Dist. 2006) (citing Central City Educ. Ass’n v. Ill. Educ.\nLabor Relations Bd., 599 N.E.2d 892 (Ill. 1992)).  Ultimately, the matter will be considered a\nmandatory subject of bargaining only if “the benefits of bargaining outweigh the burdens\nbargaining imposes on the employer’s authority.”  Id. at 248.  \n9\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 10 of 18 PageID #:4610\nIn applying the requisite balancing test, courts must analyze the specific facts of each\ncase, including:  the employer’s statutory mission; the nature of the public service provided by\nthe employer; the particular reasons for and governmental policies underlying the matter at issue;\nthe practicalities of bargaining under the particular circumstances; whether the employer has a\nspecial need for speed, flexibility or secrecy in making certain policy decisions; and whether the\nissues are amenable to resolution through the negotiations process.  Village of Franklin Park, 8\nPERI (LRP) P2039 LEXIS (Ill. State Labor Relations Bd. 1992), aff’d, 638 N.E.2d 1144 (Ill.\nApp. Ct. 1st Dist. 1994) (citations omitted).  \nThe Union asserts that “under the Illinois Labor Relations Board’s balancing test,\nrequalification schemes are mandatory subjects of bargaining because of their profound effect on\nemployment.”  (Union’s Final Reply at 8.)4  The problem with the Union’s argument is that it\nignores the fact-specific nature of the court’s inquiry.  Each of the relevant cases cited by the\nUnion in support of its argument explicitly identifies the need for a “case-by-case analysis” when\nSection 4 and Section 7 are in tension, thereby avoiding any sweeping conclusions regarding the\nneed for mandatory bargaining.  See County of Cook (Cermak Health Services), 3 PERI (LRP)\nP3030 LEXIS (Ill. Local Labor Relations Bd. 1987); Village of Franklin Park, 8 PERI (LRP)\n4 The Union concedes that “some elements of the TA’s plan, such as the training\ncurriculum, revised duties that include the use of enhanced techniques for handling residents,\nand staff evaluation, are inherent functions of management.”  (Union’s Final Reply at 10.) \nAdditionally, because the TA takes the position that “collective bargaining would be appropriate\nwith respect to issues such as the length of time YDSA’s have to obtain degrees and what\nassistance is available to help them do so” (TA’s Reply at 7), the court need not address the\nquestion of whether the TA is required to negotiate over these issues.\n10\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 11 of 18 PageID #:4611\nP2039.5  Although the Union does not dispute that the decision to require “requalification” for\nthe new positions (and the selection of applicable standards for requalification) directly impacts\nthe managerial policies outlined in Section 4, including “the functions of the [JTDC], standards\nof services, . . . the organizational structure and selection of new employees [to staff the\nCenters], examination techniques and direction of employees,” the Union fails to address in\npractical terms the anticipated benefits of bargaining over the new standards and requirements. \nThe only expected benefit identified by the Union is the general opportunity to address matters\nthat “profoundly affect employment rights.”  (Union’s Final Reply at 9-10.)  This argument does\nnothing to suggest that issues such as the proposed minimum education requirement and\napplication of the IMPACT test are amenable to resolution through the negotiation process. \nOn the other hand, the TA has taken the position that “there is virtually no benefit to\nbargaining over implementation of the YDS job classification.”  (TA’s Reply at 13.)  Rather, the\nTA opines that “the only thing to be gained by bargaining is more delay.”  (Id.)  Recognizing the\nprice of delay, Plaintiffs likewise stress the need to address the remaining defects in the overall\nstructure of the JTDC system in a prompt manner.  (Dkt. No. 559 (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 16.)6  \nThe Union correctly points out that there has been no judicial finding that “purging the\nJTDC of [incumbent direct care employees] is necessary to correct [Plaintiffs’ alleged\nconstitutional violations]” (Union’s Resp. at 8), nor has there been a specific finding that JTDC\n5 The Union also cites AFSCME Council 31, AFL-CIO v. County of Cook, 584 N.E.2d\n116 (Ill. 1991), but this case does not address the tension between Section 4 and Section 7, nor\ndoes it apply the balancing test.\n6 Cook County defers to the court on all matters raised in the Union’s Response.  (Dkt.\nNo. 555 ¶ 7.)\n11\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 12 of 18 PageID #:4612\nresidents currently face an “ongoing danger to health and safety [due to] unqualified staff\nstay[ing] in their current positions” (Pls.’ Reply at 16).  However, it is undisputed that\napproximately half of the JTDC’s current residents are housed in units structured on the old\nJTDC “system” (TA’s Reply at 4)—a system that was to be “restructured” by court order.  The\nTA has gone through great efforts to explain the particular reasons for and policies underlying\nhis decision to implement specific employment standards for the new job positions, and how\nthese standards relate to his court-mandated mission to restructure the JTDC.  (See generally\nTA’s Reply at 4-9.)  The court also takes judicial notice of the various difficulties encountered\nover the last seven and one-half years of attempting to bring the JTDC into substantial\ncompliance with the MOA and other court orders.  At this point in the litigation, the court finds\nthat the TA’s need for speed and flexibility is at a premium.\nIn light of these considerations, the court finds that the benefits of bargaining do not\noutweigh the burdens that bargaining would impose on the TA’s managerial authority, and\nconcludes that the TA, under the fact specific circumstances of this case, does not have a duty\nunder the IPLRA to engage in mandatory bargaining regarding imposition of the proposed\nrequalification standards.\n3. Substantive and Procedural Due Process Violations\nThe Union also argues that the TA’s proposed staffing plan “violates the substantive and\nprocedural due process rights that JDCs enjoy by virtue of their contractual job protections and\nstate or local law.”  (Union’s Resp. at 13.)  Assuming, without deciding, that Union employees\nhave a protectable property interest in their employment at the JTDC, the court finds that the\nUnion’s arguments in support of this position nevertheless fail.  \n12\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 13 of 18 PageID #:4613\nThe court agrees with the reasonableness of the Union’s speculation that some\nterminations “will invariably follow” implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan.  (Id. at\n14.)  The Union argues that these anticipated terminations will necessarily violate its members’\nprocedural due process rights because they will have been made without cause.  However, the\nSeventh Circuit has made clear that “due process is not implicated when government employees\nare laid off due to a reorganization,” as long as the reorganization itself is legitimate and not a\nsham.  Gunville v. Walker, 583 F.3d 979, 989 (7th Cir. 2009) (citing Misek v. City of Chicago,\n783 F.2d 98, 100 (7th Cir. 1986)).  On the record now before it, this court has no reason to\nbelieve that the TA’s proposed staffing plan is a pretext contrived to rid the JTDC of qualified\nincumbent JDCs for an illegitimate reason.  Rather, the court finds that the TA’s proposed\nstaffing plan is a legitimate means of exercising the TA’s authority “to establish personnel\npolicies; to create, abolish, or transfer positions; and to hire, terminate, promote, transfer, and\nevaluate management and staff of the JTDC” (Appointment Order ¶ 6(c)) for the approved\npurpose of restructuring the JTDC’s overall system.  In contrast to the position taken by the\nUnion, it appears to the court that the TA has made special efforts to ensure that incumbent JDCs\nwill have a full and fair opportunity to be able to remain employed by the newly-restructured\nJTDC, rather than recommending a wholesale layoff or termination of veteran staff.  To the\nextent the TA’s proposed staffing plan is likely to lead to a reorganization of JTDC staff and the\ntermination of unqualified incumbent direct care workers, the court finds the reorganization to be\nlegitimate.7  Of course, the court only addresses the Union’s argument to the extent necessary to\n7 The Union has elsewhere argued that the IMPACT test is an unreliable predictor of job\nperformance, because its validity varies with the test-takers’ years of experience.  (Union’s Final\nReply at 11.)  The court finds that the risk of terminating qualified JDCs through use of the\n13\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 14 of 18 PageID #:4614\napprove implementation of the TA’s proposed staffing plan as it has been presented to the court. \nThe Union is free to argue at any point in the future that, in practice, the TA’s staffing plan\ndiffered from the plan presented to the court or otherwise impacted individual rights in\nunforeseen ways.  At this point in the litigation, however, the court finds that no procedural due\nprocess concerns are implicated by the TA’s proposed staffing plan.\nThe Union also argues that the TA’s proposed staffing plan violates its members’\nsubstantive due process rights insofar as the plan is so arbitrary that it “shocks the conscience.” \n(Union’s Resp. at 14.)  Again, the court disagrees.  \nSubstantive due process “protects an individual from the exercise of governmental power\nwithout a reasonable justification.”  Belcher v. Norton, 497 F.3d 742, 753 (7th Cir. 2007).  As a\ngeneral matter, a violation of substantive due process rights occurs when executive action has\nbeen undertaken “without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental\nobjective,” such that the government’s exercise of power can be said to “shock[ ] the\nconscience.”  County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846-47 (1998).  When, as in this\ncase, “the circumstances permit public officials the opportunity for reasoned deliberation in their\ndecisions . . . the official’s conduct [is considered] conscience shocking when it evinces a\ndeliberate indifference to the rights of the individual.”  King v. East St. Louis Sch. Dist. 189, 496\nF.3d 812, 819 (7th Cir. 2007).  To succeed on a substantive due process theory, a plaintiff must\nIMPACT test is acceptable, in light of the fact that the test remains “highly predictive” for test\ntakers with more than five years’ experience and the test is widely used in the juvenile detention\nfield.  (TA’s Reply at 10-11, n. 5.)  The court rejects the Union’s proposed alternative—training\nincumbent JDCs in the new procedures and duties and subjecting any direct care workers who\nfail to meet the new standards to discipline or discharge for cause—as unreasonably burdensome\nin terms of duration, expense, and risk to the new system being developed at the JTDC for\npurposes of bringing it into substantial compliance with the MOA, ASO, and MIP.  \n14\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 15 of 18 PageID #:4615\nfirst establish the violation of a fundamental right or liberty interest.  Belcher, 497 F.3d at 754;\nsee also Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997) (“we have required in substantive-\ndue-process cases a ‘careful description’ of the asserted fundamental liberty interest”) (citations\nomitted).  \nIn this case, the Union does not explicitly articulate any fundamental liberty interest\nimplicated by the TA’s proposed staffing plan, or any specific fundamental rights to which the\nUnion asserts the TA is being deliberately indifferent.  The Union’s citation to King v. East St.\nLouis Sch. Dist. 189, 496 F.3d 812, 818-19 (7th Cir. 2007), suggests that the Union relies on an\nanticipated violation of “the right to protection against state-created dangers.”  However, the\nstate-created danger doctrine generally applies to scenarios involving physical danger, as in\ncases of death, bodily injury, or serious medical need, and the court is hesitant to expand the\ndoctrine to the circumstances of this case.  Additionally, and perhaps more important, the court\nfinds that there is nothing in the TA’s proposed staffing plan to suggest that it is “arbitrary in the\nconstitutional sense.”  Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846.  The TA has thoroughly explained why and how\nhe is proposing changes to the JTDC staffing structure.  The TA has remained respectful to and\ncognizant of the fact that “[t]he transition taking place at the JTDC raises real questions of\nfairness to these [incumbent] employees, for whom the rules have essentially changed mid-way\nthrough their careers.”  (Second Report at 18.)  On the record now before it, the court has no\nreason to believe that the TA’s proposed staffing plan will bring about any substantive due\nprocess violations when put into effect.\n4. Requirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n15\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 16 of 18 PageID #:4616\nFinally, the Union argues that the TA’s proposed staffing plan does not comport with the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), which states that “[p]rospective relief in any civil\naction with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the\nviolation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.”  18 U.S.C. 3626(a)(1)(A).  It\nis the Union’s position that none of the factual findings made by the court thus far in this case\nsuggest “that abrogating the legal and contractual protections of all veteran employees, the vast\nmajority of whom have never been charged with abuse, is <necessary to correct the violation of\nthe Federal right,’ let alone the least disruptive means of doing so.”  (Union’s Resp. at 12-13\n(emphasis in original).)\nThe first problem with this argument is that, as explained above, the court has found the\nTA’s proposed staffing plan does not abrogate any valid legal protections asserted by the Union,\ninsofar as the TA’s proposed staffing plan is consistent with the TA’s grant of authority, does not\nviolate the Union’s collective bargaining rights, and does not implicate any due process\nconcerns.   Additionally, the Union’s argument misses the mark, because court approval of\nthe TA’s proposed staffing plan at this point in the litigation does not itself constitute an order\nfor prospective relief.  In other words, the court is not ordering the TA to do anything.  Any\ncourt approval of the TA’s proposed staffing plan is analogous to a declaratory judgment\nregarding the scope of the TA’s authority as previously set forth in earlier court orders, and\nactions interpreting previously-entered consent decrees are not considered “fresh” injunctions if\nthey do not “substantially and obviously alter[ ] the parties’ pre-existing legal relationship.” \nJones-El v. Berge, 374 F.3d 541, 544 (7th Cir. 2004).  At the time of the TA’s appointment, the\ncourt specifically found that the prospective relief set forth in the Appointment Order—including\n16\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 17 of 18 PageID #:4617\nthe grant of broad managerial powers to the TA8—complied with the PLRA’s requirements for\nsettlement of class actions.  (Appointment Order ¶ 3.)  Although the Union hints that the consent\ndecrees memorialized in the MOA, ASO, MIP, and Appointment Order may no longer be\nnecessary to correct any underlying constitutional violations (see Union’s Resp. at 12; Union’s\nFinal Reply at 7 n.4), the Union does not go so far as to request an evidentiary hearing on this\nquestion, nor does the Union actually ask the court to terminate these orders pursuant to 18\nU.S.C. § 3626(b).  In light of the fact that the TA remains vested with the broad managerial\npowers initially conferred upon him by this court, and the fact that this court has found the TA’s\nproposed staffing plan to be consistent with these powers, the court’s interpretation of the\nAppointment Order consent decree cannot be said to substantially alter the parties’ pre-existing\nrelationship.  \nFinally, to the extent the court’s approval of the TA’s proposed staffing plan can be\nconsidered an enforcement order, the court notes that the Seventh Circuit has concluded “[t]he\nenforcement of a valid consent decree is not the kind of ‘prospective relief’ considered by §\n3626(a).”  Jones-El, 374 F.3d at 545.  \n8 The TA was given the responsibility to “oversee, supervise, and direct all management,\nadministrative, financial, contractual, personnel, security, housing, custodial, purchasing,\nmaintenance, technology, health services, mental health services, food and laundry service,\nrecreational, educational, and programmatic functions relating to the operation of the JTDC\nconsistent with the authority vested in the position of Superintendent of the JTDC and to\nrestructure the JTDC into an institution that substantially complies with the MOA, the ASO, and\nthe MIP.”  (Appointment Order at 5(b).)\n17\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 589 Filed: 06/23/10 Page 18 of 18 PageID #:4618\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, the court approves of the Transitional Administrator’s\nproposed staffing plan for the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center as set forth in\nthe “Second Report of the Transitional Administrator Pursuant to the Court’s May 8, 2008\nOrder.”  (Dkt. No. 530.)  Status hearing set for July 20, 2010, for purposes of setting further\ndates as appropriate.\n \nENTER:\n_______________________________\nJAMES F.

Marcus Collier, Richard Ordonez, Mark Quillen, and Joseph Hill (hereinafter \ncollectively the “Employees”) shall be reinstated to their employment at the Cook County\nJuvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC), without loss of seniority, subject to the terms and\nconditions set forth below.\n2. Immediately upon reinstatement, each Employee shall accept permanent \nreassignment to a newly created position (hereinafter “Position”).  Each Position shall be\nclassified as Juvenile Detention Counselor (JDC) within the JTDC bargaining unit, but each\nPosition will have defined duties and responsibilities of a JDC-Support Clerk.  If the Employees\npermanently vacate these Positions for any reason, these Positions may be closed.  The\nEmployees may not at any time in the future work in, bid on, or be considered for any other\nposition at the JTDC.  Each Employee shall receive the compensation of a JDC; shall be a\nmember of the JTDC collective bargaining unit, currently represented by Teamsters’ Local 714;\nand shall enjoy all rights and privileges and  be bound by all provisions of membership in the\ncollective bargaining unit, subject to the exceptions set forth in Paragraphs 6 and 7 below.  No\nEmployee shall be disciplined for delays in mastering the various JTDC information systems and\ncomputer programs such as Word or Excel, provided he makes reasonable and continuing efforts\nto master them.    \n3. Marcus Collier, Richard Ordonez, and Joseph Hill shall be made whole by Cook \nCounty for all lost wages and benefits as a result of their terminations on November 30, 2006. \nMark Quillen will be made whole by Cook County for all lost wages and benefits as a result of\nhis non-reinstatement on March 4, 2008.  The parties shall meet within fourteen (14) days of the\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 498 Filed: 03/12/09 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:3410\nentry of this order for the purpose of calculating the back wages, benefits, and interim earnings.\n4. None of the Employees named in Paragraph 1 of this order shall:  (1) have contact\nwith any JTDC resident; (2) work in any position that involves contact with JTDC residents; (3)\nenter any area of the JTDC that is designated for resident use; (4) be directed to enter any area or\nengage in any activity that would result in a violation of this paragraph.\n5. Acceptance of the reassignment referenced in Paragraph 2 shall not result in a \nreduction in pay or a loss in seniority to any of the Employees named in Paragraph 1, nor shall it\nhave an impact on any such Employee’s right to back pay.  \n6. If the Office of the Transitional Administrator (OTA) decides to terminate any of \nthe Employees named in Paragraph 1 based on just cause involving allegations of resident abuse,\nunauthorized contact with a resident, or conduct that results in physical harm to a resident\n(hereinafter “Misconduct Involving a JTDC Resident”), such a decision shall be reviewable only\nby the Magistrate Judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois assigned to\nthis case.  If the Magistrate Judge, after applying an abuse of discretion standard, reverses the\nOTA’s decision to terminate, the Magistrate Judge shall determine what, if any, discipline should\nbe imposed on the Employee based on the alleged Misconduct Involving a JTDC Resident, and\nwhether the Employee is entitled to back pay in connection with the termination.  All other\ndiscipline shall be subject to procedures under the applicable collective bargaining agreement\nthen in effect, if any.  \n7. By accepting reinstatement at the JTDC, each Employee named in Paragraph \n1 expressly consents to the procedures set forth above in Paragraph 6 and waives his right to use\nthe grievance process set forth in any collective bargaining agreement to challenge any\ntermination decision made by the OTA that is based on Misconduct Involving a JTDC Resident.\n8.

The purpose of this Order is to appoint a Transitional Administrator (TA) with \nthe authority and responsibility to bring the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center \n(JTDC) into substantial compliance with the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), the Agreed \nSupplemental Order (ASO), and the Modified Implementation Plan (MIP), and to prepare the \nJTDC for the transition of administrative authority over its operations to the Office of the Chief \nJudge of the Circuit Court of Cook County. The Order also requires the TA to report to the Court \non a regular basis.  \n  The TA’s prior reports to the Court have discussed various reform efforts at the JTDC, \nsuch as conversion of the old living units into Centers, capital projects, and medical and mental \nhealth care. See Dckt. Nos. 458, 530, 646. This Report will provide an overview of the same \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 2 of 14 PageID #:5369\ninformation, but with a special emphasis on the transition of the JTDC to the Office of the Chief \nJudge of the Circuit Court of Cook County (OCJ).1 This Report discusses the transition process \nin detail so that the Court and the Doe parties can decide how to proceed in this litigation.  \nI.  Current Status Report \nA.       Reorganization of Living Units \nAs the Court is aware from the TA’s prior reports, one of the central features of the TA’s \nreform effort has been to reorganize the JTDC living units into manageable Centers, which \nprovide residents with programming and staffing that satisfy the MOA. This reorganization is \nessentially complete: eight Centers have been opened.   \n1.       The TA’s Staffing Plan \n  As the Court is aware, a key feature of this reorganization is the TA’s staffing plan, \nwhich was the subject of much litigation before this Court and a still-pending appeal in the \nSeventh Circuit. See Dckt. 589 (6/23/10 order). As the TA noted in his last report, the vast \nmajority of affected employees successfully completed the testing and interview portion of the \nstaffing plan and remain employed at the JTDC. Those who participated in the process were \nultimately given three opportunities to pass the IMPACT test. There were only twelve employees \nwho failed the test three times. Of those employees, nine were terminated and three were \ndemoted. \n  Implementation of the staffing plan has laid the groundwork for providing adequate \nservices and safe conditions at the JTDC. The TA also anticipates that it will facilitate the OCJ’s \n                                            \n1 In the interest of brevity, this report addresses issues that the TA believes are of most interest to \nthe Court. Additional detail can be found in the FY 2103 JTDC Budget Briefing Report, which \nwas presented to the Cook County Board on October 30, 2012, and is attached here at Exhibit A. \nAdditionally, the TA is always glad to answer questions from the Court.      \n  2\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 3 of 14 PageID #:5370\nfuture efforts to achieve compliance with standards set by the Administrative Office of the \nIllinois Courts (AOIC).           \n2.       Closure of Centers/Population Reduction  \nIn Fiscal Year 2012, the TA, in collaboration with the President of the Cook County \nBoard of Commissioners (“President Preckwinkle”) and the OCJ, planned and implemented a \nstrategy to reduce the JTDC population, allowing for the closure of one of the eight Centers. This \nstrategy has allowed the JTDC to reduce its budgeted staff, saved the County in excess of $3 \nmillion dollars, and has kept young people out of the JTDC who do not belong there. President \nPreckwinkle’s proposed 2013 budget involves the closure of a second Center, which would \nreduce the JTDC to six Centers. As the TA explained to the Cook County Board at a recent \nbudget hearing, the TA supports the possibility of closing a second center, but only upon further \nimplementation of the population reduction plan. Without further reduction in the JTDC \npopulation, the TA cannot support the closure of an additional Center. \nB.       Reorganization of Management/Administration \nThe TA’s reorganization of the JTDC management and administration is complete. There \nare four permanent Deputy Executive Directors and three Program Directors. (One of the Deputy \nExecutive Directors currently serves as the Acting Executive Director.)  Together these seven \nofficers comprise the JTDC Executive Team. The TA envisions that the Executive Team will \nreport to the Executive Director/Superintendent2 once that individual is appointed by the OCJ.   \nThis management structure has been tested over the past several months, during which \ntime the TA took a physical leave of absence from the JTDC facility for medical treatment. \nDuring the TA’s three-month absence, the Executive Team – along with Deputy Transitional \n                                            \n2 The MIP references an “Executive Director” whereas the statute transferring authority of the \nJTDC to the OCJ references a “Superintendent.”     \n  3\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 4 of 14 PageID #:5371\nAdministrator Brenda Welch – kept the facility running smoothly and continued to consult the \nTA and implement his reforms during his leave. The TA has great confidence in this leadership \nand feels that the Executive Team is highly qualified and well positioned to manage an effective \ntransition to the OCJ.  \nC.       Medical and Mental Health Care \n1.  Medical Care (Cermak Health Services at JTDC) \nThe TA previously reported to the Court about difficulties stemming from the fact that \nCermak Health Services is controlled by an outside Cook County Agency. For example, the TA \ndoes not control hiring of medical personnel and must continually pressure Cermak Health \nServices to keep staffing at appropriate levels for the JTDC. In recent months, Cook County and \nCermak Health Services have not responded adequately to fill a number of critical vacancies. \nThe TA is addressing this issue with the County and is hopeful that the possibility of litigating \nthe issue before this Court will force the County and Cermak Health Services to fill the current \nvacancies. Unfortunately the OCJ will not have the same threat of litigation to ensure that \nstaffing levels remain adequate.  \nThe TA also previously reported to the Court problems between the JTDC and Cermak \nHealth Services relating to issues such as patient confidentiality and consent for medical \ntreatment. The TA is pleased to report that the JTDC and Cermak Health Services have finally \nnegotiated an intergovernmental agreement to address these issues.  \nMuch progress has also been made within Cermak Health Services at the JTDC with \nrespect to policies, procedures, and health-service programs for residents, to that the point that \nthe JTDC was recently evaluated by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care \n  4\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 5 of 14 PageID #:5372\n(NCCHC) for accreditation status. The TA is optimistic that the JTDC health-services program \nwill receive accreditation standing in the coming weeks.  \nFinally, Dr. Michelle Staples-Horne (referenced in the TA’s previous report) will return \nto the JTDC in December to assess compliance with the MIP and the MOA. \n2.  Mental Health (Isaac Ray) \nMental health services continue to operate in a manner that affords residents a variety of \nneed-based services. This includes the implementation of a “Bridge” Program for residents \nleaving the JTDC and returning to the community who are identified as having a continuing need \nfor mental health services. Mental health staffing has remained commensurate with the staffing \nplan and has only been reduced with the implementation of the population reduction plan \ndescribed in Section I.A.2, above; there are currently 34 FTE mental health staff. Further \nhighlights are described in Isaac Ray’s most recent annual report, attached here as Exhibit B.    \nD.       Overcrowding and Understaffing \nOvercrowding and understaffing were among the facility’s most dire problems since the \nTA’s appointment. Fortunately, implementation of the population reduction plan has kept the \nresident population at manageable levels. Since January 2012, the population has consistently \nremained between 250 and 300 residents.  \nStaffing levels remain an issue. Although there are currently 567 employees on payroll \nout of 595 budgeted positions, an inordinate number of staff are on some sort of leave status. \nThis includes FMLA and Injured on Duty (IOD) status, which accounts for over twenty (20%) \npercent of staff who are assigned to shifts and posts. The JTDC has been plagued with this \nproblem throughout the TA’s appointment. The chronic nature of this situation is likely to \n  5\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 6 of 14 PageID #:5373\nsignificantly impede the OCJ’s ability to ensure an adequate staffing pattern and thus impact on \nsafety and well-being of the resident population.  \nE.       Internal Investigations & Discipline \nThe JTDC continues to perform internal investigations of allegations of misconduct by \nJTDC staff. Between January 1, 2012, and October 15, 2012, approximately 166 complaints have \nbeen investigated with the following results: 18% of the complaints were sustained while 67.4% \nof them were not sustained or unfounded. (The remaining complaints are either still pending or \nhave been referred to outside agencies.)    \nEven where JTDC sustains complaints against staff members, however, it is extremely \ndifficult to implement effective discipline, especially when arbitration is involved. For example, \nwhere a JTDC investigator credits the account of a resident (or multiple residents) over that of a \nstaff member, an arbitrator invariably will not.3  The TA believes that it is extremely problematic \nto give final decision-making power on staff discipline issues to private arbitrators who are in no \nway accountable to JTDC residents or to the community. Such a system makes it almost \nimpossible for JTDC leadership to effectively discipline and control JTDC staff.     \nF.       Policy Development \nProgress continues to be made in the area of policy development. To date, 237 policies \nhave been developed and approved. Policy development is nearing completion, though a few \nissues remain. For example, two emergency evacuation policies are considered “interim” \nbecause evacuation agreements must still be finalized with external agencies.    \n \n \n                                            \n3 The TA believes that installation of a camera system throughout the JTDC (discussed in more \ndetail below) will facilitate the imposition of fair discipline on staff accused of misconduct. \n  6\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 7 of 14 PageID #:5374\nG.      Physical Plant/Capital Projects \nThe TA cannot emphasize strongly enough that the state of the building in which the \nJTDC is housed has been a major barrier to achieving compliance with the MOA, the ASO, and \nthe MIP. Because moving the facility to a new building is not something that can be realistically \nachieved during the TA’s tenure, capital projects necessary to mitigate the physical plant \nproblems are of the utmost importance. Complicating matters, the TA has limited control over \nimplementation of capital projects, which must go through the Cook County Office of Capital \nPlanning. The TA has attempted to work within the County’s legal and bureaucratic framework \nfor capital projects but unfortunately progress has been slow.     \nThe TA’s last report discussed ongoing problems relating to the JTDC physical plant, \nincluding problems with the lack of a video surveillance and rounds tracking system and \nproblems with the ceiling tiles. \n1.      Video surveillance \nAs the TA has previously communicated to the Court, installation of a video-surveillance \nsystem at the JTDC is critically important to safety and security. The planned video surveillance \nproject consists of 703 cameras strategically placed on all of the living units, hallways, school \nclassrooms, outdoor recreation yards, and gymnasiums. The rounds tracking system will provide \nan electronic real time event log to ensure that the staff conducts routine health and safety \nchecks, performs suicide precaution checks, and delivers other basic services (showers, meals, \nrecreation), which are mandated by the MOA and the MIP. The rounds tracking system will also \nprovide real time event logging for confinement events. \nThe delays and setbacks that have been associated with navigating County bureaucracy \ninvolved in this project are very frustrating and too numerous to list here. The Cook County \n  7\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 8 of 14 PageID #:5375\nBoard Finance Committee recently discussed this project at an October 30, 2012 JTDC budget \nbriefing. Members of the Board questioned John Cooke, Director of Capital Planning for Cook \nCounty, for a timeline on this project. Mr. Cooke stated to the Board that installation work \nshould begin in May or June 2013. The TA appreciates that some members of the County Board \nare taking this matter very seriously, and he intends to work with the County to ensure adherence \nto this timeline.  \nIf it appears that any County rules or policies needlessly delay this project, he might seek \nrelief from the Court pursuant to Paragraph 5(f) of the August 14, 2007 order to expedite the \nproject. This project is extremely important to discipline, safety, and security at the facility. The \nTA would not recommend transitioning the JTDC to the OCJ until installation of the camera \nsystem is complete or well on its way to completion. \n2.       Ceiling Tiles \nReplacement of ceiling tiles (which can easily be removed and used as weapons) is \nanother project of critical importance that has repeatedly stalled. This is a critical safety issue \nthat impacts residents and staff and could easily lead to serious harm or injury. \nSeveral months ago, the County finally awarded a contract for the project, but did so \nwithout setting project specifications and without ensuring that the final project would be in \ncompliance with safety/security standards set by the Illinois Department of Corrections. It was \nonly after the contractor started work that the County realized these problems and work was \nsuspended. The County has advised specifications for the project are going to be written and \nsubmitted to the Illinois Department of Corrections for approval, but there is no estimated \ntimetable for completion of this project.  \n \n  8\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 9 of 14 PageID #:5376\n3.       Management Information Systems \nAnother crucial capital issue that must be addressed is the JTDC’s management \ninformation system. JTDC relies on its current system (“DSI”) to keep track of vital resident \ninformation, such as location within the facility, court dates, admissions, releases, charges, length \nof stay, medical appointments, information pertaining to what residents cannot be housed with \nothers, and medical alerts. The JTDC also relies on the system to do resident counts. The JTDC \nhas been notified that the vendor of the current DSI system will no longer support it after next \nyear. In other words, the JTDC needs to replace this system as soon as possible. If the DSI \nsystem goes down without an adequate replacement, the results could be catastrophic.  \nAdditionally, updating the JTDC information system is a critical component of \ncompliance with the MOA and the MIP, which call for computerized incident reports and \nelectronic documentation of certain events and performance indicators. The current DSI system \n(which will soon no longer be available) cannot support these requirements. Thus replacement of \nthe JTDC’s information system is required not only to keep the facility functioning at a most \nminimal level, but also to bring the facility into compliance with the MOA and the MIP.  \nThe OTA has hired a consultant to perform a comprehensive assessment of these issues \nand is meeting with the Cook County Bureau of Information Technology on December 5, 2012, \nto chart a course of action for this project.  \nH.   Other Safety and Security Issues \nThe TA’s last report discussed two remaining major safety and security issues. One of \nthose issues – inadequate police response by local law enforcement – has been resolved through \nan intergovernmental agreement with the JTDC, Chicago Police Department, and Cook County \nSheriff. The other issue – fire safety – is still a concern. Fortunately, the Cook County \n  9\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 10 of 14 PageID #:5377\nDepartment of Facilities Management has recently resolved issues relating to fire evacuation \nsignage. The TA and his staff continue to work on developing a fire safety plan to be approved \nby the Chicago Fire Department. \nII.  Transition to the OCJ \nAs noted above, the TA had to take a physical leave of absence from the facility of \nabsence over the summer for medical treatment. Fortunately the TA was able to remain available \nelectronically and the JTDC management team was able to keep the TA’s reform efforts moving \nforward. However, the TA’s absence did unfortunately delay formal transition planning.   \nA.      The TA’s Plans \nSince the TA’s return, the TA has set a transition plan into motion that involves the steps \ndescribed below. The TA hopes this process will be complete by March 1 or April 1, 2013. The \ngoal of this process is to provide this Court, the Doe parties, and the OCJ all of the information \nand recommendations that they need to move forward with a successful transition.  \n1.      Compliance Report  \nDeputy Transitional Administrator (DTA) Brenda Welch has undertaken a systematic \nreview of operations at the JTDC to determine the extent to which the facility is in compliance \nwith specific provisions of the MOA and the MIP. The TA believes that DTA Welch is well-\nsuited for this task, given her former role in this litigation as the Court’s compliance monitor.  \n2.      Compliance Work Group \nThe JTDC Acting Executive Director, Teresa Abreu, will Chair a Compliance Work \nGroup, which will include the JTDC Executive Team. This Work Group will review the DTA \nWelch’s Compliance Report in very careful detail. Where DTA Welch’s finding is that the JTDC \nis not in compliance, and where the Work Group agrees, the Work Group will develop a “Plan of \n  10\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 11 of 14 PageID #:5378\nAction.” Where the Work Group disagrees with any of DTA Welch’s findings, the Work Group \nwill explain, with appropriate documentation, the basis for its view, for DTA Welch to review.  \nThe TA will review the work of both and make a determination to be presented to the Court. \n3.      Transition Report Work Group \nDr. David Roush and JTDC Director for Resident Advocacy and Quality of Life William \nKern will co-chair a Transition Report Work Group that will include the Executive Team. Dr. \nRoush is one of the nation’s foremost experts in juvenile justice. He has over forty years of \nleadership, technical assistance, training, and consulting experience with juvenile detention and \ncorrections organizations. Dr. Roush has been involved as an expert in this litigation since before \nthe TA’s appointment and has been instrumental in helping the TA develop and implement his \nreform efforts. He has done substantial work on this document, which will focus on the \noperational development of the JTDC (both prior to and during the TA’s appointment) and offer \ncritical recommendations to transition.  \n4.       Provision Waiver/Modification Report \nDTA Welch also will prepare a Provision Waiver/Modification Report that will address \nprovisions of the MOA/MIP that the TA may seek to have waived or modified. For any \nprovision on which the TA seeks such relief, he will provide a written basis to the Court and to \nthe Doe Parties.  \n5.       Safety and Information Report \nFinally, DTA Welch will develop a Safety and Information Report that provides an in-\ndepth discussion of the most serious issues that might not be fully resolved by the time that the \nJTDC is transitioned to OCJ (for example, video surveillance technology and management \n  11\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 12 of 14 PageID #:5379\ninformation systems). These issues are crucial and will likely require special attention from the \nparties and the Court during the transition.   \nB.      Steps To Be Taken By the OCJ \nThe TA has been in close contact with the OCJ throughout his appointment, especially as \ntransition draws near. On November 20, 2012, the TA and his leadership team made a day-long \npresentation to the OCJ to begin the process of formally educating the OCJ as to how the JTDC \noperates. While the TA cannot speak for the OCJ, the TA is also aware of the following steps \nbeing taken by the OCJ.   \n1.       Annie E. Casey Foundation Operational Assessment     \nThe Annie E. Casey Foundation (AECF) has offered its services to the OCJ to conduct an \noperational assessment of the JTDC on the OCJ’s behalf. As the TA understands it, the OCJ \nintends to use this assessment to obtain information for transition planning. The TA applauds the \nOCJ for pursuing such an assessment and he intends to cooperate fully. However, the TA has \nsome concerns that AECF seeks to additionally assess the TA’s work toward bringing the JTDC \ninto compliance with this Court’s orders. The TA believes that such an assessment would \ninappropriately usurp the role of this Court, to whom the TA reports. Additionally, interjecting \nAECF’s opinions into the mix at this point might be counter-productive to the very important \nwork that the Court and Doe parties must accomplish over the next several months: a systematic \ndetermination of whether the JTDC is in substantial compliance with this Court’s orders so that \nthe TA’s appointment may end. The TA has communicated this view to the OCJ. \nThe AECF assessment is tentatively scheduled to take place in January 2013 and findings \nshould be available approximately sixty days later. This means the AECF report will be available \n  12\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 13 of 14 PageID #:5380\naround the same time as the TA’s Transition Report. With all of this information, the OCJ will \nhave a wealth of tools for a successful transition.       \n2.       Appointment of an Executive Director \nThe OCJ has not made the TA aware of any imminent plans to appoint an Executive \nDirector/Superintendent. As the TA wrote in his last report, the TA recommends that the \nincoming Executive Director become familiar with all operations at the facility and that he or she \narticulate a multi-year plan to maintain adequate conditions of confinement at the JTDC and to \nensure compliance with the remaining provisions of the ASO, the MOA, and the MIP. This \nrecommendation is based on the TA’s prior experience in court-appointed positions in similar \nlitigation.  \nIII.  Conclusion \nThe TA hopes that his report is useful to the Court and the Doe parties. A copy of this \nreport will be served on all parties of record, as well as the OCJ. As always, the TA will be glad \nto answer questions or address any concerns.  \n \n  \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \n                 /s/Elizabeth Mazur     \n              Attorney for the Transitional  \n                 Administrator \nArthur Loevy \nJon Loevy \nElizabeth Mazur \nSteven Art \nLOEVY & LOEVY \n312 N.

The facility has 30 separate housing pods each accommodating 16 \nto 18 residents with a total capacity of 498 residents. \n•  In 1999, the ACLU filed a  class  action lawsuit, Doe v. Cook County: No 99 C 3945, \nregarding inadequate conditions of confinement at the JTDC. After a series of federal court \norders, including the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), the Agreed Supplemental Order \n(ASO) and the Modified Implementation Plan (MIP), Cook County entered into a settlement \nagreement in the lawsuit. \n•  In 2007, the Illinois Legislature passed Public Act 095-0194 (House Bill 236) allowing for \nthe administrative control of the JTDC from the Cook County Board to the Chief Judge of \nthe Circuit Court of Cook County, effective January 1, 2008. \n•  On August 14, 2007 the U S District Court, Northern District-Eastern Division appointed a \nTransitional Administrator (TA) and created the Office of the Transitional Administrator \n(OTA) to bring the JTDC into substantial compliance with the aforementioned court orders \nand foster an efficient and orderly transition of administrative and operational authority to the \nOffice of the Chief Judge Circuit Court. \n•  On  June  23,  2010  the  United  States  District  Court,  Northern  District-Eastern  Division, \napproved the “proposed staffing plan” for the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention \nCenter.  The  Court  upheld  the  TA’s  hiring  plan  proposed  in  the  Second  Report  of  the \nTransitional Administrator dated May 8, 2008. \n•  Currently  there  is  an  appeal  pending  in  the  7th  Circuit,  filed  by  Teamsters  700,  that \nchallenges  the  August  14,  2007  order  appointing  the  Transitional  Administrator  and \nspecifically objecting to the ‘”Staffing Plan.”    \nExhibit A \n4 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 6 of 51 PageID #:5387\n2012 Major Accomplishments \n1)  The OTA continued preparing for an orderly transfer of leadership to a new Executive \nDirector in compliance with federal court orders under the direction of the Office of the \nChief Judge (OCJ) of the Cook County Circuit Court.  \n2)  The  staffing  plan  was  completed  which  will  improve  the  quality  of  service  to  JTDC \nresidents and meet the educational requirements for staff established by the Administrative \nOffice of the Illinois Courts (AOIC). \n3)  Hired an in-house recruiter in preparation for transitioning the recruiting and on-boarding of   \nJTDC staff without the assistance of consultant. \n4)  Restructured the reception/release department which oversees the resident reception, intake, \nand release process to ensure an efficient and orderly transition of residents. \n5)  Created the Administrative Intervention Center (AIC). This center, which is managed by the \nRapid Response Team, provides direct and continuous supervision to residents who have \nbeen charged with staff assaults or exhibit extreme behaviors.  \n6)  Created the Rapid Response Team (RRT) which is responsible for the safety & security of \nthe facility.  This specially trained team will improve the safety, security, and well-being of \nall residents, employees, visitors, as well as, the general public. The RRT provides direct \nand  continuous  supervision  of  all  residents  housed  in  the  Administrative  Intervention \nCenter;  assists  in  the  movement,  transportation,  and  supervision  of  potentially \nvolatile/aggressive residents throughout the facility; and responds to any emergencies within \nthe facility. \n7)  Prepared  for  and  completed  the  National  Commission  on  Correctional  Health  Care \n(NCCHC) audit to ensure the highest standards of health care to residents in compliance \nwith the MOA. \n8)  The  Renaissance  Center  implemented  the  “Token  Economy”  behavioral  modification \nsystem for residents, which focuses on positive reinforcement of target behavior. \n9)  Implemented a quarterly Employee Performance Recognition award. \n10)  Continued implementation of the comprehensive hiring plan that resulted in 448 people \nhired since year 2008.

Unfortunately,  a  very  small  number  of  affected  staff  elected  to \nparticipate.  Finally,  the  Transitional  Administrator  scheduled  mandatory  informational \nmeetings in order to ensure affected staff understood the requirements. \n•  October 13, 2010, a bulletin was issued to impacted staff notifying them of the process to \nretain employment in the new classifications as outlined in the Transitional Administrator’s \n“Second Report” to the Court.  \n•  The Staffing Plan as filed in Federal Court required the affected staff to: 1) apply online and \nfill  out  an  application  through  CareerBuilder’s  website,  2)  participate  in  an  extensive \ntelephone screen, 3) take the IMPACT and/or PROMOTE test one time, 4) interview with a \npanel of interviewers which required a written component as well as extensive interview \nquestionnaire,  5)  successfully  complete  an  extensive  background  check.    This  process \nessentially mirrored the requirements set forth for all new hires. \n•  The testing instrument known as the IMPACT test, and as filed in Federal Court, required \naffected staff to obtain no less than 70% in the Human Relations and 70% in the Reading \nportions as well as be in the 50th percentile overall. The PROMOTE test, for those seeking \nsupervisory positions, required affected staff to obtain no less than a 66% score. \n•  Prior  to  the  process  being  implemented  the  Transitional  Administrator  made  several \nadjustments to the Staffing Plan in order to give affected staff every opportunity to succeed: \n1) affected staff would submit a cover letter and resume to one of the recruiters instead of \napplying online and filling out the lengthy on-line application, 2)  the telephone screen \nconsisted of five objective questions instead of the fifteen minute intense phone screen, 3) \nprovide two opportunities to take the IMPACT and PROMOTE tests, 4) eliminate the 50th \npercentile requirement, 5) the written portion of the interview tool was eliminated, 6) the \ninterview questionnaire was simplified and shortened. \nExhibit A \n8 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 10 of 51 PageID #:5391\nStaffing Plan Chronology  \n(Continued) \n \n•  May 10, 2011 Status:   Of the 202 affected employees;  fourteen  (14) employees retired,  \nseven  (7) resigned, ten  (10) employees were terminated for cause, one (1) passed away,  one \n(1) is on military leave, and  nine (9) did not complete the process.   \n•  Of  the  affected  staff  who  tested:  121  passed  and  56  failed.    Those  who  failed  had  an \nopportunity  to  retest.  Of  the  employees  who  retested,  over  half  passed  on  the  second \nopportunity. \n•  All testing was completed by March 2011.  Affected staff who have completed the process, \nhave been selected to be a part of two “new” Centers (Legacy and Omega) \n•  The anticipated completion date for the staffing plan was June 2011 however, since the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals has not rendered a decision, employees who failed the \ntesting have not yet been made aware of the results. \n•  On August 2, 2011, JTDC and Teamsters jointly held a “college fair” in which 9 (nine) \nnationally  accredited  colleges  participated.  The  goal  for  JTDC  was  to  assist  staff  in \nidentifying  colleges  that  meet  the  Administrative  Offices  of  the  Illinois  Courts  (AOIC) \ncriteria. \n•  March, 2012: Of the 49 affected employees allowed to test for the second time, test results \nwere communicated to those employees. Those employees that did not pass the test were \nallowed to test for the 3rd time. Test results were communicated to employees June, 2012. A \npanel interviewed those employees that passed the test and employees were assigned to \nappropriate positions. After the third testing opportunity, nine (9) employees were terminated \nand three (3) employees will be demoted to lower positions. \nExhibit A \n9 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 11 of 51 PageID #:5392\nResident Population Statistics \nComplied by the Office of Resident Advocacy & Quality of Life \n \nOffice of Resident Advocacy & Quality of Life: Refers to all functions related to the 1) \nDevelopment,  preparation  and  analysis  of  reports/data  related  to  resident  Court  activity,  2) \nServes as the JTDC liaison to the juvenile and adult court on matters related to residents and \nfacility operations, 3) Monitors all activity related to resident Grievances for compliance, 4) \nHearing Officer for resident Discipline/ Due Process, 5) Establishes the protocols and measures \nthe effectiveness of resident programs and services, 6) Monitors the integration of resident \nclassification, mental health and health services, 7) Monitors and serves as a liaison for all \nresidents temporarily placed in psychiatric setting. \n \n \nAverage Daily Population\n(January 2011 -Sept 2012)\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\nMidnight* Walking**\n \n \n* Midnight = Number of residents who spent the night at the JTDC.   \n** Walking = Midnight “+” releases from the previous day. \n(cid:3) (cid:3)\nExhibit A \n10 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 12 of 51 PageID #:5393\nResident Population Statistics \n(Continued) \n \n \n \n \nAverage Resident Population by Age\n(July 2011 - July 2012)\n10-12 Years\n18 Years +\n1%\n6%\n13-14 Years\n14%\n17 Years\n19%\n15 Years\n23%\n16 Years\n37%\n \n   \nExhibit A \n11 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 13 of 51 PageID #:5394\nResident Population Statistics \n(Continued) \n \n \n \n \nAverage Percentage of Males vs. Females\n(July 2011 - June 2012)\nFemales\n8%\nMales\n92%\n \n   \nExhibit A \n12 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 14 of 51 PageID #:5395\nResident Population Statistics \n(Continued) \n \n \n \n \nAverage Resident Population by Ethnicity\n(July 2011 - July 2012) \nWhite Other Arab\n3% 0% 0%\nPuerto Rican\n1% American Indian\n0%\nMexican\n2%\nHispanic\n10%\nChinese\n0%\nBlack\n84%\n \n   \nExhibit A \n13 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 15 of 51 PageID #:5396\nResident Population Statistics \n(Continued) \n \n \n \n \nAutomatic Transfers\n(as of July 2012)\nAutomatic \nTransfers\n27%\nOther\n73%\n \n   \nExhibit A \n14 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 16 of 51 PageID #:5397\nResident Population Statistics \n(Continued) \n \n \n \n \nAverage Length of Stay\n(July 1, 2011 - June 30, 2012)\n35.00%\n29.30%\n30.00%\n26.27%\n25.00%\n20.00%\n16.76%\n15.00%\n13.01%\n12.15%\n10.00%\n5.00%\n2.50%\n0.00%\n0-24 Hours 1-7 Days 8-14 Days 15-30 Days 31-90 Days 91 Days +\n \n   \nExhibit A \n15 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 17 of 51 PageID #:5398\nMental Health Statistics \nCompiled by Isaac Ray Center Staff(cid:3)\n \n•  On average, 31% of the JTDC’s population is on the Mental Health roster \n•  Averaging at approximately 84 Residents on the active list at any one time \n•  Of those on the roster, about 34% are on medication \n \n \nAverage Residents on Mental Health Spectrum\n(January 2012 –August 2012) \nOn Mental Health \nSpectrum\n31%\nNot on Mental \nHealth Spectrum\n69%\n \n   \nExhibit A \n16 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 18 of 51 PageID #:5399\nMental Health Statistics \n(Continued) \n \nSuicidal or self-injurious behaviors are an almost daily occurrence at JTDC. Between January 1, \n2011 and June 30th, 2012 (a span of 546 days), Isaac Ray Mental Health staff responded to 526 \nsuicidal behaviors. “Suicidal Behaviors” are comprised of 3 major categories: suicidal ideation, \nsuicidal gestures and suicidal attempts. \n \n1.  Self-harm/Suicide Ideation* \nOccurs when a resident reports feeling suicidal and does not engage in any behaviors beyond \nverbalizing the desire for self-harm. Such verbalizations include stating: “I want to die”, “I’m \ngoing to kill myself”, “I wish I was dead”, etc. \n \n2.  Self-harm/Suicide Gestures** \nOccurs when a resident both verbal expresses the desire for self-harm and engages in \nassociated nonlethal behaviors. Such behaviors may include: loosely tying string around \nneck and calling staff’s attention to such, writing a suicide note with no other self-harm \nbehavior exhibited, repeatedly banging head on toilet or wall with no associated \nbruising/marks, superficial scratching requiring no medical attention, etc. \n \n3.  Self-harm/Suicide Attempts*** \nOccurs when a resident expresses the desire for self-harm and engages in a behavioral action \nwhich may result in serious injury or lethality. Such behaviors may include: tight ligatures, \nclimbing in ceiling, tying nooses, scratching, cutting or banging head to such a degree that \nmedical attention is required. \n \nDaily Average of Suicidal Behaviors\n(January 2011-June 2012) \n2.00\n1.50\n1.09 0.96\n1.00\n0.70\n0.50\n0.00\n2011 2012 Total\n \nExhibit A \n17 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 19 of 51 PageID #:5400\nMental Health Statistics \n(Continued) \n \n \n \n \nSuicidal Behavior/Incidents\n(January 2011-June 2012) \n250\n209\n200\n171\n150\n100\n66\n54\n50\n19\n7\n0\n2011 2012\nIdeation* Gesture** Attempts***\n \n2012 only includes January 2012 – June 2012 \n   \nExhibit A \n18 | P a ge  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-1 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 20 of 51 PageID #:5401\nInternal Investigation Statistics  \n(2008 – 2012)  \nInternal Investigations - Investigations assigned to the JTDC Investigations Unit.

The report presents information \nregarding clinical contact data of IRC staff with individual residents in the provision of regular services.  It is meant to be an \noverview of IRC activities and is not meant as an “all-inclusive” review of all contact types. \nThe “Center” Concept\nA “pod” is a living unit which holds 16 to 18 residents.  A “Center” consists of 3 separate pods or living units. Each center has a \ndedicated: Team Leader , Assistant Team Leaders, Caseworkers Medical/Mental Health staff and Recreational staff for that \nparticular center. The fundamental idea behind centers is to provide a greater concentration of trained support for both the \nresidents and the working line-staff.  The centers were initiated in June 2008 with a pilot project called the PHOENIX Center on \nthe 5th ﬂoor.  That August, the successful PHOENIX model was expanded to to provide services for female resident units, and \nthe WINGS Center was implemented.  In May of 2009, the Intake units were formed into the ALPHA Center.  Since that time, \nmore centers such as ARROW, HOUSTON, LEGACY and OMEGA have come into being, as the facility has moved to a newer \nand more comprehensive service delivery system.  Today JTDC is entirely center-based.\nMovement through the JTDC System\nYouths are transported from local police precincts and processed into juvenile detention center and processed in the concourse \nin the basement.  From there they are transferred to either the ALPHA Center (for boys) or the WINGS/EAGLES Center (for Girls).  \nINTAKE & ASSESSMENT \nALPHA CENTER\nThe Alpha Center  receives all male  residents  after  they  have  completed  the admission  process2.    Youths are given \ncomprehensive measures to assess for the need of specialized services. All residents are offered the Massachusetts Youth \nScreening Instrument-Second Version (MAYSI-2) during the admission process.  The MAYSI is a brief screening tool designed to \nassist juvenile justice facilities in identifying youths at admission who may have special mental health needs.  The IRC Mental \nHealth staff assigned to the Alpha Center conducts face-to-face Intake Mental Health Screenings for all male residents within 24-\nhours of their admission to the JTDC.  The average stay on ALPHA is 1 to 3 days.\nFor those residents that are ordered to remain in detention for greater than seven days, we offer advanced mental health \nscreening and psychological testing.  These residents are offered the Practical Adolescent Duel Diagnostic Interview (PADDI).  \nThe PADDI is a comprehensive diagnostic assessment interview that documents both DSM-IV substance abuse/dependence \ndiagnoses and major mental health conditions.  Residents are also offered the Adolescent Substance Abuse Subtle Screening \nInventory- A2 (SASSI-A2).  The SASSI-2 identiﬁes high or low probability of substance dependence and substance abuse \n1 Past IRC Annual Reports covered the period of time from May through June. The data reported herein have been scaled from \nJanuary through December of each calendar year so totals from past reports to this one are not directly comparable.\n2 Female intakes are evaluated on the female unit - the W.I.N.G.S. center\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 7 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 8 of 27 PageID #:5440\ndisorders for residents 12 to 18 years of age.  Our staff also consults to the JTDC Alpha Management Team on high-proﬁle \nresidents before they are transferred to a housing unit.\nSince January 2009, Isaac Ray staff have performed 14,274 intake evaluations, averaging about 397 per month.\nTotal Intakes by Year\n5123\n4593 4558\n2009 2010 2011\nNEED FOR SERVICES \nTHE MENTAL HEALTH ROSTER\nOnce a resident is determined to need mental health services s/he is placed on the Mental Health Roster.  Usually identiﬁcation \noccurs as part of ALPHA’s Intake process but, sometimes a resident may have a crisis and be added to the Roster later during \nhis/her stay.  The Mental Health Roster, is a list of all residents being actively followed by IRC mental health staff.  The rosters are \ncompiled on average two times per week.  The roster serves as a “working list” of all of the active mental health patients.  Any \nresident on psychotropic medication is automatically added to the roster, however a resident need not be on psychotropics to be \nconsidered an active patient.\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 8 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 9 of 27 PageID #:5441\nThe Mental Health Roster averages around 100 residents across the the past three years.  The majority of patients on the Roster \ntake psychotropic medication (57% across 3 years). Like JTDC population the Roster is predominantly male (average 97) with a \nsmaller number of female residents (average 13.6).  Approximately one-third of the building population is currently on the \nMental Health Roster.\nSize and Composition of Mental Health Roster\n2009 2010 2011 Average\nAverage Mental Health \n104.5 94.8 99.2 99.5\nRoster\nMales 94.8 99.2 98.2 97.4\nFemales 15.6 15.3 9.8 13.6\nNumber on Medication 57.2 63.5 51.3 57.3\nAdult Transfer \n12.5 16.5 14.9 14.6\nResidents\nMENTAL HEALTH LEVELS OF \nSERVICES\nIsaac Ray Center staff provide mental health services to all JTDC residents and a more extensive set of services to youth \nidentiﬁed as needing ongoing mental health support (i.e. on the Mental Health Roster). Youths who are identiﬁed as having \ngreater mental health needs are placed upon the Mental Health Roster, are more closely followed and are offered a more \nextensive set of individualized services than JTDC residents not on the Roster.\nWithin 24 hours of entry to JTDC every resident is given a Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument (MAYSI) and a face-to-face \ncomprehensive mental health screen by one of the IRC staff members. All residents are encouraged to participate in psycho-\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 9 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 10 of 27 PageID #:5442\neducational groups, and all residents are seen as part of regular rounds by IRC staff members. Any residents in crisis, regardless \nof Mental Health Status (e.g. on the roster or not) are seen immediately by IRC \nstaff members for crisis intervention and stabilization between 8am and 10pm.  \nLikewise, any resident who is referred for mental health concerns is promptly \nJTDC \nevaluated by Mental Health Staff between 8am and 10pm.  Anyone can refer a \nresident for Mental Health Services. A resident can be referred by any JTDC \nPopulation\nstaff member, teacher, parent, court ofﬁcial or even self-referred by the resident \nhim/herself.\nResidents who are placed on the Mental Health Roster are provided with \nmental health services as deemed appropriate by the treatment team. Such \nservices may include individual therapy, individualized skills training, psychiatric \nservices,  medication  management,  follow-up  evaluations,  comprehensive \nMental \nlinkage planning and regular review of progress by the assigned treatment \nHealth\nteam. \nRoster\nMental Health\nWhole Population\nPopulation\n•Therapy\n•Intakes •1:1\n•Psychiatric Evaluations •Family\n•Groups •Skill-Training\n•Referrals •Treatment Plans\n•Rounds • Comprehensive Linkage for residents \n•Crises\non medication\n•Conﬁnement Rounds •Follow-ups\n•Basic Linkage services\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 10 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 11 of 27 PageID #:5443\nPARENT CENTERS \nSTANDARD SERVICES\n“Parent Centers”\nYouths who ﬁnish with Intake on ALPHA Center are then transferred to “Parent” Centers based upon individual factors such as \nGender, Age, Type of case (charged as a Juvenile vs. Adult) and others. The Parent Center is the Center where the resident will \nbe permanently housed during his/her stay at JTDC while the legal case is adjudicated.\nJTDC has the following Parent Centers:\nCenter Population\nWINGS - 2 pods of female residents\nWINGS/EAGLES\nEAGLES - 1 pod of 17 year old male residents who have been \ncharged with Juvenile cases\nARROW Males charged with Juvenile cases\nLEGACY Males charged with Juvenile cases\nHOUSTON Males charged with Juvenile cases\nPHOENIX Juvenile Males (2 pods) and Males charged as Adults (1 pod)\nOMEGA Males charged as Adults\nA.I. Center Temporary placement for residents with behavioral problems\nInitial Mental Health Contact\nEvery youth who is transferred from Alpha to a Parent Center is seen by a mental health clinician within their ﬁrst 48 hours on the \npod.  The purpose of this encounter is to evaluate the youth’s adjustment to the pod, to re-assess mental status, and to provide \nthe youth with an orientation to mental health services on that Center. This encounter is documented on a mental health progress \nnote and is ﬁled in the medical record. Some Centers such as WINGS/EAGLES & PHOENIX - provide newly arrived residents \nwith entry packets describing specialized services. Other Centers such as Omega also include information about the stages adult \nlegal system, in order to provide a realistic preview of what the resident will undergo in the upcoming months.   \nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 11 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 12 of 27 PageID #:5444\nBASIC MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES \nCLINICAL ROUNDS, \nCONFINEMENT ROUNDS & \nTHERAPEUTIC GROUPS  \nClinical Rounds \nA “Clinical Round” Mental Health clinicians conduct daily rounds on their center during every shift.  The main objective of these \nrounds is to identify problem issues that residents may be experiencing and intervene to address issues that may exist.  During \nrounds, the clinician will speak with direct care staff (Youth Development Specialist), case workers, and center management staff \nabout any mental health concerns and/or mental health referrals.  The clinician may also review the pod’s log book, incident \nreports and any major rule violations.  During mental health rounds, the clinician speaks directly with any youth who requests \nservices, youth who are conﬁned, and youth who are serving extended cool-offs.  \nTotal Clinical Rounds by Year\n8808\n7462\n6714\n2009 2010 2011\nConﬁnement Rounds\nMental Health clinicians conduct daily conﬁnement rounds to evaluate the youth’s mental status and to ensure that the conditions \nof conﬁnement are not contraindicated.  In rare instances that a youth cannot be safely maintained in conﬁnement, the mental \nhealth clinician will immediately provide an alternative plan, and the conﬁnement will be discontinued.\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 12 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 13 of 27 PageID #:5445\nTotal Conﬁnement Rounds by Year\n3295\n3112\n2522\n2009 2010 2011\nTherapeutic Groups\nIsaac Ray clinicians conduct regular psyco-educational/therapeutic groups on the center pods.  The majority of Centers receive \ncore psycho-educational groups that are skill-based and intended to teach help residents make better adjustments within the \nenvironment, promote pro-social behaviors, and to encourage better decision making. Such groups include:  Distress Tolerance,  \nAnger Management, Substance Abuse, Problem Solving, Relaxation and Mindfulness. The Omega and Houston Centers also \nprovide “Peace Circle” groups, a type of therapeutic group that focuses on member equality and practical problem solving. Isaac \nRay clinicians have provided 2,467 groups over the past 3 years with a total 24.380 members.\nTotal Therapeutic Groups by Year\n931\n895\n641\n2009 2010 2011\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 13 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 14 of 27 PageID #:5446\nMENTAL HEALTH RESIDENTS \nSPECIALIZED SERVICES\nOverview\nAs mentioned above, residents who have been identiﬁed as having mental health needs receive a higher degree of support from \nMental Health staff and higher degree of specialized services. Such services include: the prescribing and management of \npsychotropic medication, Individual Therapy/Follow-up contacts, multi-disciplinary stafﬁngs\nTotal Initial Psychiatric Evaluations\n by Year\nPsychotropic Medication\nOver one-half  of  Active  Mental  Health  patients  are  on  psychotropic \n977 994\nmedication.  Before medication is started residents must ﬁrst be evaluated \nby  IRC  Psychiatrists or  Advanced  Practice Nurses. Initial psychiatric  848\nevaluations are usually 60 to 90 minutes in duration, provide an initial \ndiagnosis and serve as  foundation for further treatment.  Usually, this time \nincludes obtaining  consent  and  information  form  outside  caregivers, \nhowever sometimes such persons cannot be reached the day of the initial \nevaluation. Often Psychiatry  Department  Staff  are  required  to  gather \ninformation regarding the resident’s past treatment history from parents/\nguardians/agencies such as DCFS and to obtain consent to treat the \nresident while s/he is housed at JTDC.   Psychiatry staff may also be \nattempt to speak with other mental health providers who have treated the \nresident in the past or at other settings.  2009 2010 2011\n2799 Psychiatric Follow-up visits\n2596\nOnce medication had been prescribed, residents must be “Followed-up” \nwith, to assure treatment efﬁcacy and monitor for the possibility of side-\n2075\neffects. There a two types of Follow-up contacts. Basic Follow-up Contacts \nare for residents housed on any of JTDC Pods or units and vary from as \nfrequent as 1 x week for new/short-term residents (monitoring side-effects, \ncompliance, reviewing lab results, etc.), to up to 1 x month for longer term \nresidents.\nAs the JTDC population has fallen and the duration of stay in the building has \nshortened, the number of follow-up contacts has fallen commensurately.\n2009 2010 2011\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 14 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 15 of 27 PageID #:5447\nMental Health Therapy & Follow-up\nResidents on psychotropic medication are automatically followed by other mental health staff. However, some residents can \nbeneﬁt from mental health support without the use of medication. These residents too, are placed on Follow-up status and seen \nby clinicians such as psychologist, social workers and/or mental health specialists on a regular basis.  Such residents display a \nwide variety of issues. Some may simply be experiencing adjustment difﬁculties. Some may be cognitively delayed and need \nmore extensive support. Some resident may e displaying clinical symptoms and parents/guardians have not given consent to \ntreat with medication, but do consent to talk-therapy approaches.  Whatever, the resident’s speciﬁc issue, “Follow-up” status  \nresidents are seen at least one time per week, often more during periods of crisis, until the identiﬁed problems are resolved of the \nresident leaves the detention center.\nTotal Mental Health Therapy & Follow-up Contacts by Year\n7471\n6712\n6397\n2009 2010 2011\nAgain, as the JTDC population has fallen and the resident’s duration of stay in the building has shortened the number of follow-\nup contacts has fallen commensurately.\nStafﬁngs and Collateral Contacts\nMental Health services do not operate in isolation from other system whether inside or outside of JTDC.  Mental health staff \noperate in a consultant role communicating with a wide variety of disciplines including: Youth development Specialists, team \nLeader and assistant Team Leaders, Caseworkers, Probation Ofﬁcers, medical personnel (inside and outside of JTDC), Judges \nand family members.\n“Stafﬁngs” encompass two broad types on clinical contacts:   Team stafﬁngs and  Hospital stafﬁngs. Teams stafﬁngs are \ncomposed of the Mental Health treatment team designated to treat a particular individual.  They are usually composed of a \nmember of the Psychiatric Team (MD or APN), and several members of the Mental Health Team (PhD., MSW and or MHS).  The \npurpose is to develop or reﬁne a comprehensive approach to the mental health treatment of residents on the Mental Health \nRoster.  Hospital Stafﬁngs are different from Team Stafﬁngs in that, when a resident is hospitalized outside of JTDC for psychiatric \nreasons, then that particular resident’s Treatment Team sets up a meeting with the that resident’s psychiatric treatment team at \nthat particular hospital (More on Hospital Stafﬁngs in the section on Crises).\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 15 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 16 of 27 PageID #:5448\nConsults are deﬁned as meetings with in-house health providers (i.e. Nursing, Medical staff, other Mental Health, Youth \nCounselors, Team Leaders, etc.) to coordinate care and treatment for particular residents.  Collateral contacts reﬂect contacts \nwith outside providers such as parents/guardians, probation ofﬁcers, court ofﬁcials, medical personnel at John Stroger Jr. \nHospital, personnel at other outside hospitals such as Hartgrove or Riveredge Hospitals.   Such contacts reﬂect...Collateral \ncontacts do not include formal Team Stafﬁngs or Hospital Stafﬁngs.

A “crisis” is deﬁned as anytime a resident exhibits extreme behavior \nwhich requires an immediate mental health evaluation and possible response. Sometimes crises are a resident expressing \nsuicidal ideation (i.e. “I want to die.”, “I’m going to kill myself”, etc.). Sometimes the resident is actively engaging in self-harm \n(scratching self, banging head on brick wall, attempting to hang self, etc.).  Sometimes a resident is acting out in a violent \nbehavioral fashion towards staff or peers and requires immediate assessment. Mental health staff respond to various crisis calls \non a regular basis.\nEnvironmental Alert\nWhen youth is in crisis (or returning from an outside hospital following a suicidal crisis), the resident may be placed on an \nobservational status called:  Environmental Alert (EA). Residents on EA status, are evaluated by Mental Health staff at least twice \nper day (at least once on the day shift and at least once on the evening shift).  These evaluations are documented on the Suicide \nSafety Plan.  The purpose of these risk assessments is to evaluate the youth’s current mental status and current level of risk.  \nDetermination regarding level of observation and housing are also documented on the Suicide Safety Plan.  \n1 Consultations and Collateral contacts reported are a combination of Mental Health and Psychiatry contacts - see  Appendices I & II for \nspeciﬁc details\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 16 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 17 of 27 PageID #:5449\nPsychiatric Crisis\nThe overall level of psychiatric crisis has fallen signiﬁcantly from 2010 to 2011, following the shift to a smaller Center-based \nresident management system.  Crises fell by 370 when 2011 is compared to 2010.  The average monthly number of psychiatric \ncrises fell from 68.9 per month in 2010 to 38.1 in 2011.  The drop is statistically signiﬁcant and not due to chance.\nTotal Crises by Year ANOVA comparing Crises level across year\n90\n827\n80\n70\n585 457 H_ Crises5600\nM40\n30\n20\n10\n2009 2010 2011\nYear\n2009 2010 2011\nR2 = .53, df = 2, F-Ratio = 18.77, p <.0001\nEnvironmental Alert Status Checks\nWhile the total number of crises have fallen the number of Environmental Alert checks performed by Mental Health staff on \nresidents have increased. This past year one of IRC’s primary goals was to ensure that all residents placed on EA were seen \ntwice per day as opposed to the older practice of seeing such residents only one time day. Data indicate that IRC has met it’s \ngoal.  EA checks increased by 1,860, or 85% across the past two years. Resident’s in distress are being monitored more \nfrequently than previously.\nTotal Environmental Alert Checks by Year\n4043\n2183\n875\n2009 2010 2011\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 17 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 18 of 27 PageID #:5450\nHospitalizations\nSometimes residents experience symptoms which  Reasons for Hospitalization by Type and Year \ncannot be adequately managed  in a correctional \n2010 2011 Average\nsetting and require placement in an outside hospital \nfor stabilization and treatment.

Community re-\nentry planning, or Linkage,  is designed for youth who are being released \nfrom the JTDC and returning home in effort to enhance the youth’s and \n519 family’s awareness of and access to community resources.  Additionally, the \ngoals of community re-entry are to promote a healthy life-style and reduce \nthe risk of recidivism.   Re-entry is a process that typically begins with a \n419 referral from the primary  mental health clinician  to  the Center’s social \nworker, indicating that the youth may be returning to the home and has \nidentiﬁed mental health and/or psychiatric needs upon returning to the \ncommunity.  The  re-entry  planning  process  begins  immediately  upon \nadmission and continues throughout the youth’s stay in detention. \nRe-entry  services  can  address a  wide range  of  programming  needs \nincluding the following: educational programs (school re-enrollment, after-\n153\n128 school programs, tutoring programs), mental health services (psychiatry \nservices, counseling services, group programs), employment services (job \ntraining, Job  Corps) and programs to manage the resident’s free time \n(mentoring programs, sports and/or arts programs).   Additional support \n2010 2011 services may also be coordinated with the Mental Health Juvenile Justice \nLinkage for non-MH residents (MHJJ-I) initiative.   However, one barrier to effective Linkage is a lack of \nLinkage for MH/Medication residents available outside services for residents to be linked to.\nThe Bridge Clinic:  Spanning the service gap\nWhen adolescents who suffer from mental illness are released from juvenile detention centers, it is crucial that these youth be \nprovided with continuity of care in the community.  Without access to clinical services, their symptoms may worsen and their \ncondition and functioning may deteriorate.\nMany community based programs are overwhelmed and consequently have waiting lists.  Wait time for services can take up to 3 \nmonths.  This presents a signiﬁcant challenge to youth and their families who will receive a maximum of 30 days worth of \nmedication upon release from detention.   The potential consequence would be that the youth would experience a lapse in \nmedication and treatment for that period of time, placing the youth at risk for other problems at home, at school and in the \ncommunity.   Certainly, it increases the risk of hospitalization, re-offense, violation of probation and further detention. \nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 19 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 20 of 27 PageID #:5452\nDemonstration Project\nThe Bridge Program, a pilot program, addresses the existing gap in services by providing psychiatric services (i.e., medication \nmanagement), case management, family services, and individual counseling.  It is staffed by Isaac Ray Center psychiatrists, \npsychologists, licensed clinical social workers, and master’s-level mental health specialists.  The ofﬁces of the Bridge Program \nare located in the Court Building at 1100 South Hamilton and will offer eight hours of service per week. Residents of the JTDC \nwho are taking psychotropic medications while at the detention center but not active with a community provider are referred to \nthe Bridge Program prior to their release. These residents may also be active with the Cook County Juvenile Probation \nDepartment – Clinical Interventions Division. Consent to share/exchange information is obtained so that probation ofﬁcers can \nattend stafﬁngs with the youth and Isaac Ray staff (to coordinate care of the youth).  This collaboration enhances continuity of \ncare between the clinical, home, school and community settings. \nThis initiative is a collaborative trial/model partnership between the CC-JTDC, the Isaac Ray Center, the Juvenile Probation \nDepartment and community providers. The goal is to close that critical gap in services as the youth transition back into their \ncommunity and re-establish services in the community. The potential gain is that youth are supported during this transition and \nare able to maintain continuity of care and maintain any therapeutic gains they have achieved while in detention.  The project was \nofﬁcially initiated on February 15, 2012 and assessment of this pilot program’s efﬁcacy is ongoing.  Additional funding will be \nsought for further development.\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 20 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 21 of 27 PageID #:5453\nAPPENDIX I \nMENTAL HEALTH CONTACT \nSUMMARY TABLE\nDifference \nPercent \n2009* 2010 2011 between 2011 \nChange\n& 2010\nIntake Evaluations 5,123 4,593 4,558 -35 -0.8%\nFollow-up Contacts 7,471 6,712 6,397 -315 -4.7%\nReferrals 2,899 1,917 3,969 2,052 107.0%\nClinical Rounds 6,714 7,462 8,808 1,346 18.0%\nConﬁnement Rounds 2,522 3,112 3,295 183 5.9%\nConsultations 4,651 5,949 6,541 592 10.0%\nCollateral Contacts   1,313 1,314 1,100 -214.0 -16.3%\nCrises 585 827 457 -370 -44.7%\nEnvironmental Alert \n875 2,183 4,043 1,860 85.2%\nEvaluations\nGroups 931 641 895 254 39.6%\nGroup participants 10,157 6,013 8,210 2,197 36.5%\nNon-Mental Health \n419 519 100 23.9%\nLinkage\nMental Health \n128 153 25 19.5%\nLinkage\n* No Linkage data is available for 2009\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 21 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 22 of 27 PageID #:5454\nAPPENDIX II \nPSYCHIATRY CONTACT \nSUMMARY TABLE\nDifference \nPercent \n2009 2010 2011 between 2011 \nChange\n& 2010\nInitial Psychiatric \n977 994 848 -146 -14.7%\nEvaluations\nPsychiatric Follow-\n2596 2799 2075 -724 -25.9%\nup Contacts\nReﬁlls & Lab \n609 729 731 2 0.3%\nReviews\nCourt Health  \n103 182 245 63 34.6%\nSummaries\nProbation Health \n111 75 73 -2 -2.7%\nSummaries\nTeam Stafﬁngs 263 279 281 2 0.7%\nHospital Stafﬁngs 118 179 112 -67 -37.4%\nCrises 58 63 23 -40 -63.5%\nAnnual Review \n47 30 21 -9 -30.0%\nEvaluations\nConsultations 172 323 799 476 147.4%\nCollateral Interviews 1141 1440 1317 -123 -8.5%\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 22 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 23 of 27 PageID #:5455\nAPPENDIX III \nTotal IRC Mental Health and Psychiatry contacts \n2008-2011\nvvooNN\nppeeSS\nlluuJJ\nyyaaMM\nrraaMM\n1111--nnaaJJ\nvvooNN y\nr\nt\na\nppeeSS i\nh\nc\nlluuJJ y\ns\nP\nyyaaMM\nrraaMM\n0011--nnaaJJ\nvvooNN\nppeeSS\nh\nlluuJJ lt\na\ne\nyyaaMM H\n \nl\na\nrraaMM t\nn\ne\n9900--nnaaJJ M\nvvooNN\nppeeSS\nlluuJJ\nyyaaMM\nrraaMM\n8800--nnaaJJ\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5\n5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1\nExhibit B\nAnnual Report 23 IRC\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 24 of 27 PageID #:5456\nAPPENDIX II \nPROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS\nThe Alpha Center\nThe Alpha Center receives all male residents after they have completed the admission process.  All residents are offered the \nMassachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Second Version (MAYSI-2) during the admission process.  The MAYSI is a brief \nscreening tool designed to assist juvenile justice facilities in identifying youths at admission who may have special mental health \nneeds.  The Alpha Center conducts Intake Mental Health Screenings and makes appropriate referrals for all male residents within \n24-hours of their admission to the JTDC.    \nFor those residents that are ordered to remain in detention for greater than seven days, we offer advanced mental health \nscreening and psychological testing.  These residents are offered the Practical Adolescent Duel Diagnostic Interview (PADDI).  \nThe PADDI is a comprehensive diagnostic assessment interview that documents both DSM-IV substance abuse/dependence \ndiagnoses and major mental health conditions.  Residents are also offered the Adolescent Substance Abuse Subtle Screening \nInventory- A2 (SASSI-A2).  The SASSI-2 identiﬁes high or low probability of substance dependence and substance abuse \ndisorders for residents 12 to 18 years of age. Our staff also consults to the JTDC Alpha Management Team on high-proﬁle \nresidents before they are transferred to a housing unit.   \nPhoenix Center\n As a part of Mr. Dunlap’s vision of creating “centers within centers “ the Phoenix Center became the ﬁrst center created within \nthe CCJTDC in 2008.  \nThe Phoenix Center is comprised of three living pods for male residents: two pods for juvenile court residents and one pod for \nCriminal Court / Automatic Transfer (AT) residents.   The AT residents are youth who are being tried in adult court.  \nAll three pods adhere to a Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) structure.  Residents earn points daily in various categories (e.g., \ngestures, talk, area, participation), and every resident earns a weekly level.  Every resident is assigned an individual, weekly goal \nthat is focused on improving a target behavior.  Throughout the day, counselors reinforce concepts of the CBT program.  \nResidents earn points and goals throughout the day based on their appropriate behavior.   Residents earn a weekly level, and \neach level has various privileges and incentives accordingly.  Additionally, with the CBT structure, residents earn consequences in \na progressive manner, beginning with a 5 minute time out for minor infractions.   Following extended time outs, residents \ncomplete a self-analysis worksheet, examining irrational thoughts, actions and effective problem solving.  \nEvery pod receives daily CBT groups that are facilitated by the youth development specialists.  These groups may focus on anger \nmanagement, restorative justice, moral decision making and Rational Behavior Training (RBT).  In addition to the CBT groups, the \nPhoenix Mental Health staff also facilitate weekly mental health groups on each pod.  Mental Health groups may focus on \nadditional topics such as coping with grief/loss, teen parenting and substance abuse education.  \nAdditionally, each Phoenix case worker facilitates a weekly group on their primary pod.  Groups may be focused on restorative \njustice, team building and social skills.  \nExhibit B\nBusiness Report 24 company name\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 25 of 27 PageID #:5457\nPhoenix Center (Continued)\nThe Phoenix Center’s recreation department has played a signiﬁcant role in creating and implementing special programs that are \nunique to our center.  Each month there is a special event on Phoenix that is a centered around a theme.  For example, in the \nmonth of February, Phoenix Center hosted a Black History Month program that included stepping, reading, art work, food and \ncelebration.  Family members were invited to attend the celebration as well.  \nFinally, the success of Phoenix rests with the dedicated and committed staff that consistently rise “above and beyond” what is \nexpected.   For example, our Assistant Team Leader has created a Phoenix Book Club and an extensive library, whereby \nresidents may borrow books, read them and then process with staff what they have learned or gained from the reading material.  \nOur Assistant Team Leader has also developed a writing program, which allows residents to further enhance their creative writing \nskills and computer skills.  Residents are not only building essential reading and writing skills, but in the process are given positive \noutlets to express their emotions appropriately and help them cope with the stress that is inherent in detention.  \nThe Phoenix Center demonstrates that various disciplines can effectively come together and collaborate effectively to assist our \nresidents in their growth and overall wellbeing. \nWings/Eagles Center \nThe WINGS/EAGLES Center has the unique distinction of housing both girls and boys, respectively.  The WINGS center consists \nof two sections of 15-17 year old girls awaiting sentencing and/or placement.  The EAGLES center consists of one section of \nboys approximately ages 14-17 years, who are ﬁrst and second time detainees awaiting sentencing and/or placement.  The \nWINGS/EAGLES Mental Health team provides gender-responsive and trauma-informed services to the girls and boys with whom \nwe work.   We value the difference of growing up female or male in our society and develop our interventions with this difference \nin mind.  Additionally, we take a “global precautions” approach to trauma.  For the majority of our youth, interpersonal violence, \ncommunity violence, and sexual violence have played some role in their lives.  We understand this and integrate this knowledge \ninto our work to provide the best services to our boys and girls. \nMental Health Services\nOur individual and group interventions integrate experiential, drama, and narrative techniques to address the trauma, violence, \nand psychiatric issues experienced by these adolescents. Additionally, we include mindfulness and relaxation techniques (e.g. \nguided imagery) into our program to allow the adolescents to experience the calm and healing we promote.  In addition to \nindividual work, we offer at least 8 mental health groups every week.  Because of the temporary length of stay for most of our \nyouth on WINGS/EAGLES, we follow a monthly rotation of themed weeks and apply them in a gender-responsive manner to \neach center as you see below:\n\r Week 1 – Emotion regulation (WINGS)/ Anger management (EAGLES)\n\r Week 2 – Sisterhood and Support (WINGS) / Conﬂict Resolution (EAGLES)\n\r Week 3 – Health Topics (Gender-responsive)\n\r Week 4 – Substance use and abuse (Gender-responsive)\nWe include a special topics week some months to include topics such as: \n\t The Sex-Trade Industry (what it is and how to avoid it)\n\t Gang Violence\n\t Media Inﬂuence\n\t Culture and Race\nExhibit B\nBusiness Report 25 company name\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 680-2 Filed: 11/26/12 Page 26 of 27 PageID #:5458\nWings/Eagles Center (Continued)\nLinkage Services\nIn addition to the mental health services provided during their stay at the JTDC, the Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) \nprepares and works with the youth on linkage services.  While detained at the JTDC, the LCSW assigned to WINGS/EAGLE \nworks with the youth, both individuals and in a group format, on resume building and interview skills.  She also works with the \nyouth and their guardians on a linkage plan which includes community resources to be accessed upon their release from the \ndetention center.  This linkage plan is reviewed with the guardian, the youth, and also sent home via mail.  This linkage plan is \nvital not just for our youth on psychiatric medications but also on those who have expressed an interest in receiving mentorship, \noutpatient therapy, or becoming involved in a team sport.\nOmega Center\nThe Omega Center serves a special population: residents, 15 ½ years or older, who are accused of committing felonies, and \ntherefore being charged as adults. Adult Transfer (A.T.) Residents cope with unique challenges when compared to other JTDC \nresidents. Not only are A.T.’s separated from family members throughout a lengthy trial process (lasting months or years) but they \nalso face the prospect of being transferred to Cook County Jail upon their 17th birthday.  This combination of extended and \nacute stressors places A.T. residents at higher risks for developing mood and associated behavioral disorders even when no \nsuch symptoms previously existed.  Omega’s specialized clinical services are designed to address these issues.\nSpecialized Clinical Services\n1.  Prevention focus\nBecause residents stay for such lengthy periods, mental health staff have an opportunity to get to know each resident to a \ngreater degree than is possible on other JTDC Centers. As such, clinical rounds and groups offer chances for on going mental \nhealth evaluations in a less-formal manner to determine adaptation to incarceration and also allow the teaching of problem \nsolving skills to help residents avoid a decline in functioning.\n2. Pre-C.C.D.O.C. planning and education\nFear of  the unknown is one of the primary causes of  anxiety  and  stress. Thus as residents approach their 17th and \ncommensurate transfer date, Dr. Jopp uses a variety of materials (including printed information, photos and web-based movies) \nto present a realistic picture of C.C.D.O.C. life and suggestions for adapting in a productive fashion.  Dr. Jopp, who has a 10-year \nwork history at C.C.D.O.C., provides residents with a reality-based preview of the daily life and challenges that residents will face \nduring their C.C.D.O.C. stay.\nResidents are educated in the scope of C.C.D.O.C. services including: intake, housing, classiﬁcation, and protective custody, \nreligious, legal, medical and mental health services. Key differences between JTDC and C.C.D.O.C. are highlighted including:  \nC.C.D.O.C. disciplinary sanctions and visitation rules.\nConsultation is done on an individual basis, because young men tend to ask more honest (and from their point of view) potentially \nembarrassing questions one-on-one with a trusted advisor than in front of a group of peers.\n3. Therapeutic Restorative Justice groups/”Peace Circles”\nOmega mental health staff regularly  participates with Omega youth Development Specialists in Peace Circles, a type of \ntherapeutic group that focuses on member equality and practical problem solving.

(Second Report at 17; see also \nTA’s Reply at 6.) \n \n3  The MOA specifically requires Cook County to “create and maintain a system which: \na. keeps residents reasonably safe, clean, and adequately housed and fed; \n \nb. provides for the prompt identification of the medical, dental, mental health and developmental needs of youth, and \ntimely access to adequate medical, mental health, and developmental services; \nc. provides adequate social and recreational programming; \nd. provides due process of law to youth who are being disciplined; \ne. houses and disciplines youth in the least restrictive manner appropriate under the circumstances; [and] \nf. provides [access to an adequate] education.” \n(MOA at 8, ¶ 7.) \n \n4  The Union concedes that “some elements of the TA’s plan, such as the training curriculum, revised duties that include the use of \nenhanced techniques for handling residents, and staff evaluation, are inherent functions of management.” (Union’s Final Reply at \n \n10.) Additionally, because the TA takes the position that “collective bargaining would be appropriate with respect to issues such \nas the length of time YDSA’s have to obtain degrees and what assistance is available to help them do so” (TA’s Reply at 7), the \ncourt need not address the question of whether the TA is required to negotiate over these issues. \n \n5  The Union also cites AFSCME Council 31, AFL–CIO v. County of Cook, 145 Ill.2d 475, 164 Ill.Dec. 904, 584 N.E.2d 116 (Ill.1991), but \nthis case does not address the tension between Section 4 and Section 7, nor does it apply the balancing test. \n \n \n6  Cook County defers to the court on all matters raised in the Union’s Response. (Dkt. No. 555 ¶ 7.) \n \n \n7  The Union has elsewhere argued that the IMPACT test is an unreliable predictor of job performance, because its validity varies \nwith the test-takers’ years of experience. (Union’s Final Reply at 11.) The court finds that the risk of terminating qualified JDCs \n \nthrough use of the IMPACT test is acceptable, in light of the fact that the test remains “highly predictive” for test takers with \nmore than five years’ experience and the test is widely used in the juvenile detention field. (TA’s Reply at 10–11, n. 5.) The court \nrejects the Union’s proposed alternative—training incumbent JDCs in the new procedures and duties and subjecting any direct \ncare workers who fail to meet the new standards to discipline or discharge for cause—as unreasonably burdensome in terms of \nduration, expense, and risk to the new system being developed at the JTDC for purposes of bringing it into substantial \ncompliance with the MOA, ASO, and MIP. \n \n8  The TA was given the responsibility to “oversee, supervise, and direct all management, administrative, financial, contractual, \npersonnel, security, housing, custodial, purchasing, maintenance, technology, health services, mental health services, food and \n \nlaundry service, recreational, educational, and programmatic functions relating to the operation of the JTDC consistent with the \nauthority vested in the position of Superintendent of the JTDC and to restructure the JTDC into an institution that substantially \ncomplies with the MOA, the ASO, and the MIP.” (Appointment Order at 5(b).) \n \n \n \n7 \n \n\nDoe v.

The purpose of this Order is to appoint a Transitional Administrator (TA) with the \nauthority and responsibility to bring the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center \n(JTDC) into substantial compliance with the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), the Agreed \nSupplemental Order (ASO), and the Modified Implementation Plan (MIP), and to prepare the \nJTDC for the transition of administrative authority over its operations to the Office of the Chief \nJudge of the Circuit Court of Cook County. \n  On May 8, 2008, this Court entered an Order that allowed the TA to enter into contracts \nfor temporary staffing services and take other steps necessary to address a staffing crisis that \n  1\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 2 of 16 PageID #:5191\njeopardized the health and safety of JTDC residents. The Order also directed the TA to report to \nthe Court, the parties, and Local 700 (the collective bargaining unit for most JTDC staff) on the \nconditions and the status of the JTDC staffing crisis. See Doc. 415 (May 8, 2008 Order) at ¶ 6.  \nThe TA submitted his first report pursuant to this order in November 2008 and his second report \nin October 2009. The first report addressed the staffing and organizational progress that Office of \nthe Transitional Administrator (OTA) has made since May 2008 as well as issues that would \nneed to be resolved in the future. The second report expanded upon the issues discussed in the \nfirst report and discussed other progress the OTA has made toward compliance with all of the \nCourt’s orders. The second report also included a proposal to reclassify JTDC direct-care \nworkers. This proposal led to extensive litigation with the Union, including two requests by the \nUnion to stay implementation of the TA’s staffing plan (both of which were denied) and an \nappeal that is currently pending in the Seventh Circuit.  \n  At this point, the TA’s work at the JTDC is in the final transition state.  This third report \nprovides the Court with an update on the status of various matters at the JTDC, such as \nconversion of the old living units into Centers, capital projects, and medical and mental health \ncare; details the remaining most serious safety and security issues at the JTDC; and provides the \nTA’s proposal for how transition to the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook \nCounty (OCJ) should occur.    \nAlthough this report will not deal directly with the same issues raised in the Court’s May \n8, 2008 order, the TA hopes that this Court will nevertheless find this report appropriate, as the \nAugust 14, 2007 Agreed Order Appointing the Transitional Administrator also anticipates the \nTA submitting periodic reports to the Court. As always, the TA will gladly provide the Court \nwith any additional information on subjects addressed below. \n  2\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 3 of 16 PageID #:5192\nI.  Current Status Report  \n \nA.  Reorganization of Living Units \n  As the Court is aware from the TA’s prior reports, the TA has been in the process of \nconverting old living units into new “Centers,” which provide residents with levels of staffing \nand programming that satisfy the MOA. When the Court approved the TA’s plan to reclassify \ndirect care workers, the TA had already opened five new Centers. Since the Court approved the \nTA’s plan and allowed the TA to move forward with the plan, the TA has selected qualified staff \nto open two new centers. Staff assigned to the sixth Center has already been trained; the sixth \nCenter will open on March 13, 2011. Training for staff assigned to the seventh Center will begin \non March 14, 2011. The eighth and ninth Centers should be open by June 2011. At that point, \nthis critical staffing transition will be complete. All residents will be housed on new Centers, and \nall direct care workers will have completed the necessary training for their position.  \n  The TA is pleased to report that a substantial majority of the 202 veteran employees who \nwere affected by the staffing plan have successfully completed the testing and interview process \nand will soon begin working on a new Center. The TA provided veteran employees two chances \nto take the IMPACT. In the first round of testing, one hundred twenty one (121) passed veteran \nstaff passed and fifty-six (56) failed. In the second round of testing, approximately 50% passed. \nThus, only about thirty (30) veteran staff failed the IMPACT test.1 In other words, the TA’s \nstaffing plan has not, as the Union feared, led to the wholesale replacement of veteran staff.       \n                                                 \n \n1 Of the two hundred and two (202) affected veteran staff, five (5) of retired, ten (10) were \nterminated for reasons unrelated to the staffing plan, one (1) passed away, one (1) left for the \nmilitary, and eight (8) refused to participate in the process. \n \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 4 of 16 PageID #:5193\nB.  Reorganized Management/Administration \n  As the TA explained in his second report, he has also undertaken to reorganize the \nmanagement and administrative structure of the JTDC. That reorganization is largely complete. \nThere are now four Deputy Executive Directors (three permanent, one acting), all of whom now \nreport to the TA, but will in the future report to the Superintendent who will be appointed by \nOCJ. See Exhibit A (organizational chart). This organizational structure has enabled the JTDC to \nfunction as an organization and will help the OCJ make a smooth transition.  \n  One of the newest additions to the JTDC is the Office of Quality Assurance. This Office \nwill ensure that newly-implemented policies and procedures are carried out in day-to-day practice \nat the JTDC. This Office will be crucial to a successful transition to OCJ.  \nC.  Medical/Mental Health Care \n  Significant progress has been made in the areas of medical and mental health care at the \nJTDC. Because medical and mental health services are provided by two separate agencies, they \nwill be described separately below.  \n1.    Medical Care (Cermak Heath Services at the JTDC)  \n  As the TA has previously reported to the Court, one of his biggest challenges in the area \nof medical care is that he does not have direct control over the JTDC medical program. Medical \nservices are provided by Cermak Health Services (CHS), a Cook County agency which continues \nto serve as the sole medical authority for the JTDC. As the TA previously reported, there has \nbeen much debate over who was administratively responsible for the oversight of medical and \nmental health services, confidentiality of patient services, chain of command, and the types of \nservices and health care delivery model required. These debates caused considerable delays in the \n \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 5 of 16 PageID #:5194\nprogress of achieving several of major goals of the reform effort, though notable progress has \nbeen made.  \n  In 2010, the TA hired Dr. Michelle Staples-Horne, a nationally-recognized expert in the \nfield of juvenile corrections medical services,2 to assess whether the JTDC medial program is in \nsubstantial compliance with the medical components of the MOA, ASO, and MIP. Dr. Staples-\nHorne’s evaluation is still ongoing, but a report a report of her findings to date shows compliance \nin many, but not all areas.  Several key policies, for example, must still be written and approved \nbefore substantial compliance can be achieved. Additionally, CHS still must obtain accreditation \nfrom the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) and training must be \ndeveloped and provided to medical staff. See generally Exhibit B (Staples-Horne report).  \nAs indicated in Dr. Staple-Horne’s report, progress toward NCCHC accreditation has \nbeen impeded by CHS’s somewhat slow development of adequate policies and procedures. The \nTA has been providing technical assistance to CHS though a contract with Dr. Scott Chavez, an \nexpert in NCCHC accreditation. At the JTDC, Dr. Chavez has facilitated a multi-disciplinary \npolicy team which includes mental health and operations. This team has met frequently over the \nlast several months to develop a facility specific policy manual meeting the standards required \nby NCCHC, the American Correctional Association, and the Illinois Department of Juvenile \nJustice. These policies will be approved and implemented by CHS and the JTDC within in the \n                                                 \n2 Dr. Staples-Horne is the medical director of the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice. \nAdditionally, she is the Immediate Past President of the Society of Correctional Physicians, \nserves on the Health Care Committee of the American Correctional Association, the Juvenile \nHealth Committee for the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. \n \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 6 of 16 PageID #:5195\nnext two months. CHS is in the process of seeking NCCHC accreditation and hopes to obtain \naccreditation by the end of 2011.  \n  In 2010, significant progress was made toward filling staff vacancies at CHS. For \nexample, in 2010, CHS hired five nurses, one nurse manager, one paramedic, one part time \ndentist, one physician assistant, and one dental assistant. Another nurse is expected to join CHS \nnext month. Presently, thirty-three (33) of the thirty-seven point seven (37.7) full time equivalent \n(FTE) positions at CHS are filled.  \n  Finally, as the TA noted in his second report, his office has been in the process of \nnegotiating an intergovernmental agreement between the JTDC and CHS, which will finally \nresolve some of the main issues that have arisen between the two agencies: patient confidentiality \nand consent for medical treatment. This agreement should be finalized in the coming months.    \n2.  Mental Health (Isaac Ray)  \n  Mental health services at the JTDC comply with the MOA, ASO, and MIP in most \nrespects. The TA was able to make vast improvements in mental health services by cutting \nCermak Health Services (CHS) out of the process. Whereas Issac Ray previously provided \nmental health services through a contract with CHS, it now has a contract directly with the \nJTDC. This arrangement has allowed the TA to substantially increase mental health staffing \nlevels (presently 34 FTE mental health staff), consistent with expert recommendations previously \nsubmitted to this Court. This arrangement has also allowed the TA to integrate mental health \nservices into behavior management programming in the Centers and has allowed mental health \nstaff to develop better working relationship with other JTDC direct care staff, resulting in much \nbetter levels of service and outcomes for JTDC residents. The TA strongly recommends OCJ \n \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 7 of 16 PageID #:5196\nmaintain a direct contract with Issac Ray when it assumes control of the facility.    \n  With this new arrangement, every JTDC resident receives mental health screening within \nfour (4) hours of his or her arrival at the JTDC and meets with a mental health staff person within \ntwenty-four (24) hours. Where necessary, residents are referred to psychiatrists and obtain needed \nmedications promptly. After intake, all residents—even those who are not identified at intake as \nhaving mental health issues—have continual contact with mental health staff through behavior \nmanagement programming in the Centers, for example, through educational and therapeutic \ngroup meetings. Since the TA’s appointment, the number of contacts between JTDC residents \nand mental health staff has almost doubled. For more details, see Exhibit C (Isaac Ray 2009-\n2010 Annual Report). As noted above, however, improvements are still needed to ensure \nsubstantial compliance with all areas of the MOA, ASO, and MIP. For example, residents who \nare placed in restraints do not always obtain a mental health consultation within one hour, as \nrequired by the MOA.  \nD.  Understaffing & Overcrowding  \n  When the TA was appointed, the JTDC faced severe understaffing and overcrowding \nissues. Both of these problems have been addressed. As the TA has explained in previous reports, \nthe TA has brought in hundreds of new, qualified personnel. Presently, 529 of the 634 budgeted \nFTE positions at the JTDC are filled. Since January 2007, the TA has hired or promoted 392 \nemployees and has dismissed approximately 236 employees. See Exhibit D (JTDC employee \nhead count summary). The OTA is working on filing the remaining vacancies.  \n  Fortunately, there are no overcrowding issues at this time. The daily population has been \nwell below the JTDC 498-bed capacity in recent months. The TA has implemented policies and \n \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 8 of 16 PageID #:5197\ncreated a staff infrastructure to respond in the event overcrowding again becomes an issue. \nE.  Internal Investigations  \n  Deputy Transitional Administrator Brenda Welch is in charge of internal investigations \nconcerning allegations of staff misconduct. Ms Welch, with the assistance of two full-time \ninvestigators, conducted over one hundred sixty-two (162) internal investigations in 2010. \nApproximately forty-one (41) of those investigations were referred to other agencies (in most \ncases, to arresting police departments because allegations were against arresting police officers). \nOf the one hundred twenty-one (121) investigations that were completed internally, thirty-four \n(34) were sustained and fifty-seven (57) were not sustained. For more detail about these \ninvestigations, see Exhibit E (summary charts of internal investigations).   \nF.  Policy Development \nAs the TA explained in his last report, his office is engaged in a major overhaul of JTDC \nPolicy and Procedure Manual. To date, two hundred sixteen (216) policy statements have been \nwritten, one hundred sixty-five (165) of which have been approved. It has been a lengthy process, \nbut all policies and procedures are expected to be completed by the end of March 2011, with the \npossible exception of medical and mental health service policies, which, as described above, \nmust be written in conjunction with CHS. \nIt is worth mentioning two policy areas that present special challenges. First, there have \nbeen delays in developing safety and emergency procedures, in part due to a lack of cooperation \nin the process by the Cook County Department of Facilities Management. As discussed in more \ndetail below, however, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) has been instrumental \nin helping obtain the necessary cooperation. Second, the JTDC policy for compliance with the \n \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 9 of 16 PageID #:5198\nPrison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 15601 et seq., is still in draft form \nonly. The reason is that United States Department of Justice has yet to finalize PREA standards \nfor juvenile facilities. If the DOJ has not finalized these standards by March 31, 2011, the current \ndraft policy and procedure can be submitted to the review process for final approval, with \nchanges made at a later date if needed. \nG.  Capital Projects \nSince the TA’s appointment, the following major capital projects have been completed: \nreplacement of the heating and cooling system in the corridors in the living rooms, allowing for \nair temperature regulation and adequate ventilation; purchase of one hundred fifty (150) handheld \nportable radios, allowing for adequate communication among staff throughout the building; \npurchase of detention-grade furniture and mattresses so that these materials cannot be used as \nweapons; construction of two “safe rooms” in the medical unit to prevent resident self-harm; and \ninstallation of detention-grade room doors that have no glass.  \n  Several projects must still be completed. The following projects are currently in progress: \ninstallation of a facility-wide camera security system needed to provide adequate supervision and \nfor misconduct investigations (more details below); renovation of gym and outdoor recreation \nfloors needed to ensure that residents have access to minimal levels of large muscle exercise; and \nrepair of external windows needed to stop rain leaks.  \n  There are several capital projects that are seriously needed, but are still in the early \nplanning stages only. First and foremost, the ceilings in the resident rooms need to be replaced. \nResidents can easily remove the metal tiles, creating a significant security and suicide hazards. \nThe Cook County Department of Facilities Management has included this project in their 2011 \n \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 10 of 16 PageID #:5199\ncapital project request, but the Cook County Capital Development Board has yet to review this \nproject. There is no estimated completion date at this time.  \nAdditionally, the entire facility needs to be re-keyed. Over the years, keys have been \nissued to non-JTDC personnel, and the key control system is inadequate by corrections standards. \nIn fact, the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice has previously cited the JTDC for its lack of \nkey control. Further complicating matters is that the Cook County Department of Facilities \nManagement has sole control over the issuance of keys and locks at the JTDC. It is unacceptable \nfor the JTDC to not have control over its key and lock system. OTA is working with Facilities \nManagement to have the facility re-keyed and to turn control over keys and locks to the JTDC.     \nFinally, the resident phone system needs to be replaced. Currently, there is no way to \nmonitor resident phone calls, to ensure that residents are afforded phone calls to their families, or \nto ensure that residents are not making unauthorized calls. For the past two years, the Cook \nCounty Department of Information Technology has been working on developing a system at the \nJTDC that would remedy these problems, but much more work needs to be done. At this time, \nthere is no estimated completion date.  \nH.  Other Safety and Security Issues. \nThere have been a number of improvements in the area of security and due process for \nJTDC residents. Security has increased with the installation of metal to replace the old glass \ndoors to the resident rooms and special furniture that cannot be easily thrown or used as \nweapons. Daily inspections are done of resident rooms. If there are any issues (for example, with \nplumbing or lighting), residents are moved to a different room and repairs are made in relatively \nshort order. The laundry system has also been reworked so that residents always have a clean set \n \n  10 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 11 of 16 PageID #:5200\nof clothing and no longer store soiled clothing in their rooms.  \nRandom room searches are also conducted to search for contraband. Additionally, two \nline scanners have been purchased to reduce the likelihood that contraband is brought into the \nfacility by staff and visitors. Notwithstanding these security measures, contraband (e.g., \ncigarettes, lighters, and marijuana—items not easily detective by line scans and electronic wands) \nand other security breaches remain a problem in the facility.  \nAnother major problem in the facility is fire safety. The TA has made repeated efforts to \nimplement fire safety and evacuation plans, but has had serious difficulty because the TA does \nnot have control over the physical plant in which the JTDC is housed. The building, which is also \nused by the Circuit Court of Cook County Juvenile Division and other County offices, is under \nthe control of Cook County Facilities Management. The TA has raised these concerns with the \nState’s Attorneys’ Office, which has been helping the TA reach a resolution. With the SAO’s \nhelp, the TA expects to implement fire safety and evacuation plans within the coming months.  \nAnother very serious safety issue at the JTDC in recent months is the refusal by the \nChicago Police Department (CPD) to respond to public safety emergencies and/or reports of \ncrimes occurring at the JTDC. Without an adequate police response, there is no way to quell \nmajor disturbances that might occur (there are no sworn officers on the JTDC staff) and there is \nno way to hold residents and/or staff who commit crimes at the JTDC accountable for their \nactions. Likewise, crime victims, including residents assaulted by other residents, cannot file \npolice reports or press charges against their assailants. The TA and his legal counsel have made \nevery effort to force CPD to fulfill its responsibility to JTDC residents, to no avail.     \n \n \n  11 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 12 of 16 PageID #:5201\nFortunately, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office has stepped up and agreed to field calls \nfrom the JTDC and to perform necessary investigations. The JTDC Chief Legal Counsel is \nworking with the Sheriff’s Office and the States’ Attorney’s Office to determine what form these \nservices will take and to draft a memorandum of understanding between the agencies. Ideally, the \nparties will be able to implement a consistent police presence at the JTDC that is proactive in \nnature and blends into daily life at the JTDC.       \nI.  Resident Due Process & Discipline  \nResident due process and discipline is another area in which significant progress has been \nmade, but improvement is still needed. A recent review of statistics showed that JTDC hearing \nofficers are consistently conducting resident due process hearings within timeframes established \nby MIP. Additionally, JTDC residents are getting orientation handbooks, though not necessarily \nwithin one hour of their admission to the JTDC. See Exhibit F (Resident Orientation Handbook).  \nAdditionally, the TA has developed grievance procedures and installed black boxes \nlabeled “Grievances” on each floor of the resident living quarters in compliance with the MOA. \nThe JTDC grievance procedure is outlined in resident handbook. Id. at 15.  \nThere is still no Disciplinary Practices Review Committee, as required by MIP, but the \nTA anticipates that this Committee will be established in 2011. Another area that needs \nimprovement is making sure that residents who are in disciplinary confinement receive one (1) \nhour of large muscle activity outside their room per day. The new Office of Quality Assurance \nwill help ensure that this requirement is met going forward.  \n \n \n \n  12 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 13 of 16 PageID #:5202\nII.  Plans for Remaining Safety and Security Problems at the JTDC \nAs the discussion above shows, there are a number of issues that still must be resolved at \nthe JTDC before substantial compliance with the MOA, ASO, and MIP is achieved. While some \nof those issues seem minor, others pose a serious ongoing safety threat and/or a threat to \nresidents’ constitutional rights. Now that the TA’s staffing plan is almost fully implemented, the \nTA is shifting his focus to resolution of the following most serious matters.  \nA.  Physical Plant Safety Issues. \n  The state of the building in which the JTDC is housed has been a major barrier to \nachieving substantial compliance with the MOA, ASO, and MIP. Simply put, the building is not \na reasonable environment to house JTDC residents; it will never be completely safe. Thus, \ncapital projects necessary to mitigate physical plant problems of are of the utmost importance.  \nAs described above, the ceiling tiles present a major safety and security issue. Even \nthough the TA replaced the old glass doors with steel doors, residents can still attempt to leave \nrooms and/or harm themselves or others by breaking into the ceiling tiles. The Cook County \nDepartment of Facilities Management has put the ceiling renovation project into the 2011 capital \ndevelopment request. However, due to the many layers of County bureaucracy involved, this \nproject is far from completion.  \n  Additionally, the building layout makes it extremely difficult to provide appropriate \nsupervision, particularly when residents are moving outside of the living units. Cameras are \nnecessary to provide this oversight. Short of building a new facility, the only way to provide \nadequate supervision is through installation of a facility-wide camera system. Cameras are also \ncrucial to deterring misconduct by residents and staff, and for ensuring fairness for residents and \n \n  13 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 14 of 16 PageID #:5203\nemployees who are accused of misconduct. This project is now on track, though the OTA \nanticipates that it will need to be completed in 12-18 months. Further, as noted above, the facility \nmust be re-keyed, and control over all the keys should be transferred from the Cook County \nDepartment of Facilities Management to the JTDC.  \n  Finally, resolution of the fire safety and evacuation issues at the JTDC is a top priority. \nAs mentioned above, the SAO is helping the TA gain necessary cooperation from Facilities \nManagement. The TA anticipates that SAO will help resolve this matter within the next month.   \nB.  Health Care \nThe TA must also ensure that Cermak Health Services moves forward with implementing \npolicies required by the MOA, ASO, and MIP, and that it obtains necessary NCCHC \naccreditation. At the current rate, substantial compliance with the medical portions of the MOA, \nASO, and MIP should be achieved by the end of 2011.  \nC.  Public Safety/Police Services \nFinally, as noted above, safety at the JTDC is compromised by the Chicago Police \nDepartment’s refusal to respond to emergencies and/or reports of crime that occur at the JTDC. \nThe OTA is working with the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to make sure that there is an \nadequate police presence at the JTDC. The details of this arrangement are still being worked out \nbetween agencies involved. The OTA hopes that this issue will be resolved and that some form \nof interagency agreement will be in place within the next 60 to 90 days.     \n \n \n \n \n  14 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 15 of 16 PageID #:5204\nIII.   Transition to OCJ \nThe TA and OCJ have been giving much thought to how the transition of the JTDC to \nOCJ should occur once the facility is ready. The TA is most concerned with making sure that the \nnew Superintendent has all the tools and information he or she needs to successfully run the \nfacility that continues to satisfy constitutional standards. To that end, the TA recommends that, \nbefore the transition is complete, the incoming Superintendent become familiar with all \noperations of the facility and write a multi-year plan to ensure the compliance with remaining \nprovisions of the MOA, ASO, and MIP. The TA would be glad to work with the new \nSuperintendent on such a project. Of course, the TA is also open to additional feedback from this \nCourt or OCJ on the manner in which the transition should occur.     \nIV.    Conclusion \n  The TA hopes that this report is useful to the Court. A copy of this report will be served \non all parties of record, as well as OCJ. The TA will gladly provide the Court any additional \ninformation it would like and/or appear in open court to answer questions on the record.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  15 \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 646 Filed: 03/09/11 Page 16 of 16 PageID #:5205\n            RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \n \n \n             /s/Earl L.

For the reasons stated below, the\nmotion is denied.\nPlaintiffs-appellees are current and former detainees at the JTDC who sued the\ncounty for unconstitutional conditions of confinement.  The parties settled by entering into\nvarious agreements, over which the court retained jurisdiction, that required the county to\n“assure that all staff are properly trained” and required a plan with “appropriate hiring\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 637 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:5146\nCase: 10-2746    Document: 53    Filed: 12/21/2010    Pages: 3\nNo. 10-2746 2\nstandards and procedures as well as a plan for staff training.”  But, according to plaintiffs,\nthe JTDC did not take appropriate action to modify the conditions of confinement and the\nparties ultimately entered into an order (Appointment Order) that appointed a Transitional\nAdministrator to take over the JTDC.  To bring the JTDC into substantial compliance with\nthe parties’ agreements, the Appointment Order gave the Transitional Administrator the\n“power to establish personnel policies; to create, abolish, or transfer positions; and to hire,\nterminate, promote, transfer, and evaluate management and staff of the JTDC.”  The\nTransitional Administrator subsequently proposed new employment procedures that\nrequire some staff who directly care for detainees to reapply for their positions and, in\ndoing so, interview for the positions, pass a qualification test, and work towards getting a\nbachelor’s degree (if they do not have one).  On June 23, 2010, over the union’s objection,\nthe district court approved the plan.  The union subsequently asked the district court to\nstay the June 23, 2010, order, but the court declined and the union now seeks a stay here.\nThis court reviews “the district court's findings of fact for clear error, its balancing of\nthe factors under the abuse of discretion standard and its legal conclusions de novo.” \nHinrichs v. Bosma, 440 F.3d 393, 396 (7th Cir. 2006).  The factors considered in determining\nwhether to issue a stay pending appeal are: (1) whether the appellant has made a showing\nof likelihood of success on appeal, (2) whether the appellant has shown irreparable injury\nabsent a stay, (3) whether a stay would substantially harm other parties to the litigation,\nand (4) where the public interest lies.  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987).\nThe union fails to show irreparable injury sufficient to warrant a stay.  It argues that\n“a stay is required to assure that no incumbent JTDC employees are discharged under the\nstaffing re-qualification plan who would otherwise lack any remedy against” the Office of\nthe Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County.  The Office of the Chief Judge was\nstatutorily assigned control of the JTDC and will take over the JTDC when the Transitional\nAdministrator leaves.  See 55 ILCS 75/3.  Because the Office of the Chief Judge is not party\nto the agreements (or this litigation), the union argues that any fired employees will lose\nrecourse under the agreements once the Office of the Chief Judge takes control.  In short,\neven if this court reverses the district court, compelling rehiring of the fired employees, if\nthis court does so after the Office of the Chief Judge takes over, the union argues that the\nOffice of the Chief Judge will be under no obligation to take the employees back.\nBut this argument, as noted by the district court when it denied the stay, presumes\nthat this court will not decide the appeal until after the Office of the Chief Judge takes over. \nThe district court found this unlikely.  The court noted that the Transitional Administrator\nexpects to be at the JTDC “‘well into 2011,’” that the union didn’t argue otherwise, and that\nbased on the court’s past experience with the litigation it did not expect the Transitional\nAdministrator’s assignment to “conclude at any point in the near future.”  The court agreed\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 637 Filed: 12/21/10 Page 3 of 3 PageID #:5147\nCase: 10-2746    Document: 53    Filed: 12/21/2010    Pages: 3\nNo. 10-2746 3\nwith the plaintiffs that the Transitional Administrator would “‘almost certainly’” be in\nplace to implement relief if this court reverses the June 23, 2010, order.  Accordingly, the\ndistrict court concluded that irreparable injury was not imminent.\nThe union does not address this conclusion in its motion but instead claims that the\ndistrict court has expressed a desire to wind down the proceedings, and has not stated that\nit will retain jurisdiction over this case after resolution of the appeal.  But this does nothing\nto address that fact that no one contends that the Office of the Chief Judge will be taking\nover anytime soon.  Without the transfer to the Office of the Chief Judge, there is no\nirreparable harm. \n \nFurthermore, we are doubtful of the union’s arguments that it has a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits of the appeal.  Considering that the Transitional Administrator was\nput into place to enforce the parties’ agreements, which encompassed “hiring standards\nand procedures,” it is unlikely that the Transitional Administrator has exceeded the scope\nof the agreements in implementing the new staffing plan.  Nor are we convinced that the\nTransitional Administrator is required to engage in collective bargaining over the new\nstaffing procedures and criteria.  Considering the burdens put on the management of the\nJTDC if it were not allowed to implement the new procedures, but instead had to\ncollectively bargain over these employment practices, the burdens of bargaining likely\noutweigh the benefit.  This could be dispositive.  See Cent. City Educ. Ass’n v. Illinois Educ.\nLabor Relations Bd., 599 N.E.2d 892, 897-98, 904-05 (Ill. 1992) (requiring balancing of benefits\nto determine if bargaining is required when employer action affects both conditions of\nemployment, an area subject to bargaining, and managerial policy, an area not subject to\nbargaining).\nIn addition, we are not sure that the balance of harms weighs in the union’s favor.\nThe new staffing qualifications are meant to correct conduct, procedures, and practices that\nlead to this lawsuit in the first place.  Without the new staffing procedures, the residents at\nthe JTDC will still be subject (at least in part) to the care that the parties’ agreements are\nmeant to curtail.  When considering the harm to the residents against the harm to the union\nand its members, inadequate (and arguably unconstitutional) care will likely trump\npotential job loss.  \nBut we need not decide the likelihood of success and the balance of harms (or the\npublic’s interest for that matter) because the lack of irreparable harm is reason enough to\ndeny the request for a stay.  See Graphic Commc’ns Union v. Chicago Tribune Co., 779 F.2d 13,\n15 (7th Cir. 1985) (“Being likely to prevail is a necessary but not sufficient condition for\nobtaining a stay (or other injunctive relief) pending appeal; another necessary condition is\nthat the appellant will suffer irreparable harm if the stay is denied.”).  The union is free to\nseek injunctive relief, if necessary, when a date is set for transfer of control of the JTDC to\nthe Office of the Chief Judge.",

The Order also directed the TA to report in\nwriting within six months to the Court, the parties, and the Union on the conditions and the\nstatus of the issues raised in the TA’s motion.  See Order (Docket No. 415), at ¶ 6.  This report\ndescribes the steps that the Office of the Transitional Administrator (OTA) has taken to remedy\nthe crisis, highlights some recent accomplishments, and notes some ongoing challenges.  \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:3295\nI. OTA’s Efforts to Address the Staffing Crisis at JTDC Following the Court’s May 8,\n2008 Order\nThe OTA has made significant short- and long-term efforts to address the staffing crisis\nat the JTDC, the highlights of which are discussed below. \nA.       Short-Term Efforts: Contracting for Temporary Security Services \nOn May 12, 2008, the OTA entered into an agreement with Wackenhut Corporation for\ntemporary security services.  Under the terms of the agreement, forty-six (46) full time\nequivalents (FTE’s) would be provided to the JTDC with an added relief factor to be hired and\nassigned to posts in agreed upon areas.  Six (6) Supervisory personnel with an added relief factor\nwould also be provided to oversee the Wackenhut personnel in each assigned area. All personnel\nwould be subject to LEADS/CANTS clearance (a background check using data from the Illinois\nState Police and the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services).  In addition, workers\nwould be provided with 40 hours of training by Wackenhut and 80 hours of training by the JTDC\nbefore being assigned to their posts. \nOn May 21, 2008, the OTA met with Teamsters Local 714 to discuss procedures for\nreassigning Juvenile Detention Counselors (JDCs) from the overnight shift to the first and\nsecond shifts.  Factors such as seniority and the necessity to maintain stability on the JTDC\nAdmissions, Screening and Orientation Unit were generally agreed upon.  All affected\nBargaining Unit JDCs were afforded, based on seniority, the opportunity to bid on shift and days\noff assignment on these designated shifts.  On May 24, 2008, the OTA provided written notice to\nall affected Bargaining Unit JDCs that the reassignments would take place on July 6, 2008.\n2\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:3296\nWackenhut personnel were assigned to JTDC Night Watch posts previously occupied by\nBargaining Unit JDCs.  The primary duties of the Wackenhut personnel have been to monitor\nresidents, in accordance with policy/procedure, during sleeping hours, complete all required\ndocumentation and report any/all disturbances and/or emergencies to JTDC Supervisory\npersonnel.  Wackenhut personnel were also assigned to designated security posts in the\nEducational Center (Nancy B. Jefferson School) halls.  The primary responsibility of these\npersonnel has been maintaining security, and order during resident movement and, where\nnecessary, assisting JTDC personnel with movement of residents.\nAt the present time there are fifty-four (54) Wackenhut personnel who have been trained\nand are working at the JTDC. Over the period of the contract there have been five (5) Wackenhut\npersonnel dismissed from their position at the JTDC. There have also been two (2) documented\nincidents of attempts at intimidation of Wackenhut personnel on the part of Teamsters Local 714\nmembership.\nThe temporary security contract with Wackenhut has met or exceeded the intended\nobjectives since its inception.  In the absence of the relief provided by the Court’s May 8, 2008\nOrder, adequate security and safe conditions would be more difficult to maintain. \nB. Long-Term Efforts: Hiring and Training Qualified and Permanent\nEmployees in a Responsible Manner \nAs the Court has determined, the JTDC had been chronically under staffed for many\nyears.  Much of this had been brought on by the failure of the County leadership to appoint\nknowledgeable and skilled leadership. This problem is extremely difficult to solve for at least\ntwo reasons. \n3\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:3297\nFirst, prior to the TA’s appointment, there was no effective plan in place at the JTDC to\nrecruit and hire personnel in accordance with the Court’s Orders, nationally recognized\nminimum standards of practice, and the requirement that staff in critical positions of providing\ndirect and continuous supervision to residents have the requisite skills to do so.  In other words,\nthe JTDC had no real infrastructure in place that would allow the OTA to implement an\naggressive hiring plan.  Second, the number of vacant positions at the JTDC has increased.  At\nthe time of the TA’s appointment, the 2007 Fiscal Year Budget was nearing an end, and there\nwere four hundred and seven (407) FTE’s in the approved budget.  The OTA’s submission of the\nFY 2008 Budget required an increase to five hundred sixty-nine (569) FTE’s.\nFaced with these challenges, the OTA has implemented two parallel hiring strategies that\nfocus on filling the highest priority positions in a responsible and expeditious manner. \n1. Collaborative Strategy with the Office of the Chief Judge (OCJ)\nAs a result of the passage of Illinois Public Act 95-0194, the Chief Judge of the Circuit\nCourt of Cook County is to assume administrative control of the JTDC from the Cook County\nBoard of Commissioners.  When the JTDC is formally under the control of the Office of the\nChief Judge (OCJ), certain JTDC employees will be subject to the employment requirements of\nAdministrative Office of the Illinois Courts (AOIC), particularly those employees who have\ndirect and continuous supervision of residents.  As a result, the OTA needed to develop a long-\nterm hiring strategy in collaboration with OCJ to ensure that all new hires meet relevant AIOC\nrequirements. \nThis collaboration has resulted in an agreement between the JTDC and the OCJ\nconcerning hiring job classification(s) of Juvenile Detention Counselor (JDC), Team Leader\n4\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:3298\n(TL), Assistant Team Leader (ATL), Caseworker, and Recreation Worker.  The following hiring\nand criteria and procedures apply:\n• All candidates must be processed through and certified eligible by AOIC.\n• All candidates receive a telephone screening.\n• Selected candidates are required and scheduled to take a nationally recognized\nwritten examination known as IMPACT for entry level positions and PROMOTE for\nsupervisory level positions. Only those passing this examination would be allowed to\nprogress to the next phase.\n• Successful candidates are required to respond in writing to a number of prepared\nquestions and are interviewed.\n• All candidates must clear LEADS and CANTS.\n• All candidates’ test scores, written exam, and interview results are reviewed by a\njoint (OCJ, OTA) selection team.\n• Those candidates selected are required to participate in a tour of the JTDC.\n• Offers are made to selected candidates and drug screening is required.  \n• All candidates selected for the aforementioned classification(s) are required to\ncomplete a one hundred and sixty (160) hour nationally recognized training curriculum\nthat includes the curricula for the resident Cognitive Behavior Training Program before\nbeing assigned to their posts.  In addition, candidates selected for supervisory level\nposition(s) (Team Leader, Assistant Team Leader) are required to complete an eighty\n(80) hour leadership training curricula.\n5\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:3299\n• Finally, all candidates selected are trained and assigned to posts in the JTDC as a\nTeam responsible for the daily operation of a fifty-four (54) bed Unit of residents. \nTo date, this strategy has proven to be extremely effective.  It has resulted in forty-one\n(41) new permanent hires:  thirty-one (31) Juvenile Detention Counselors, three (3) Team\nLeaders, five (5) Assistant Team Leaders, and two (2) Case Workers.  With these hires, the OTA\nhas been able to open a model fifty-four (54) bed Unit for JTDC residents (called the “Phoenix\nUnit”).   The OTA also plans, with these new hires, to open another Unit for female residents\naround January 4, 2009.  In addition to newly hired staff, current JTDC personnel meeting the\ncriteria/requirements agreed upon by OCJ and the OTA have also been given consideration and\nselected for these first two (2) Units.\nThe OTA anticipates opening six (6) additional 54-bed Units with a similar operational\ndesign, such that all JTDC residents will eventually reside within one of these 54-bed Units.  The\nhiring process for these classifications continues in as efficient and expeditious manner as\npossible.\n2.      Contracting with a Professional Human Resources Consulting Firm\nThe OTA has also implemented a parallel strategy for filling other vacant positions that\ndeal primarily with resident quality of life (e.g., food service, sanitation), and other human\nresources and business functions.  Hiring for these positions would not necessarily require an\nAIOC eligibility determination and would require resources beyond those being shared by OCJ.\nThis strategy has been developed with the assistance of Personified, a highly reputable\nlocal consulting firm.  Personified helped JTDC set forth an aggressive plan and timetable in an\neffort to respond to the critical personnel shortage at the JTDC.  See Exhibit A.  \n6\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:3300\nBy speaking with various departments in the facility, Personified analyzed the current\nJTDC recruitment process and developed a streamlined recruiting process map.  Recruiting\ngroundwork was established through the development of updated job descriptions, JTDC\nemployment applications, phone screening documents, and communication documents to ensure\ncandidates had a smooth interview and recruitment experience.  As a result, a long term hiring\nprocess is now in place that will efficiently staff and hire at the JTDC.  Some highlights of this\nprocess:\n• Job requirement meetings are set up to gather necessary position information.\n• An interview panel and schedule are established per position. \n• Sourcing strategy and awareness is brought to advertise JTDC positions through\ninternal and external postings.\n• All qualified applicants receive a detailed telephone screening interview.\n• Selected applicants are scheduled for a face-to-face interview with JTDC\nprofessional staff.\n• All successful candidates are required to clear LEADS, CANTS, and reference\nchecks.\n• A letter to OCJ is submitted for approval to hire potential candidates.\n• Verbal and written employment offers are presented to selected candidates;\ncandidates are scheduled for mandatory drug and medical screening appointments.\n• Pending acceptable drug and medical screen results, candidate start dates are\ncoordinated with the training department to ensure a smooth transition.\n• Follow up correspondence is sent to candidates not selected for hire.\n7\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:3301\n• All candidates selected for aforementioned classification(s) are required to\ncomplete forty (40) hours of facility training before being assigned to their post in\naccordance with state regulations. Additional training and/or certifications post-hire may\nbe required for certain positions.\nThis strategy has also proven extremely effective.  As of November 4, 2008, over 4000\napplications have been tendered, and 150 phone interviews and 60 in-person interviews have\nbeen conducted. \nAs a result, the JTDC has recently hired one (1) Business Manager and one (1) Human\nResources Manager.  With these new hires, the JTDC will, for the first time in some years, have\nhighly qualified and experienced leadership in two (2) critical administrative areas to oversee a\n$40 million plus annual budget and six hundred (600) plus personnel.  With these new hires, the\nfunctions of purchasing, procurement, personnel/payroll, etc., that were transitioned to the OCJ\nin January 2008 have been recently returned to the JTDC.\nTwenty-nine (29) other expected and permanent hires have also been made:  (1) director\nof food services, one (1) food services supervisor, seven (7) cooks, two (2) food service workers,\nnine (9) custodial workers, one (1) laundry worker, and eight (8) security officers.   \nII. Accomplishments, Expectations, and Challenges\nSince the TA was last before the Court, the OTA has made progress toward resolving the\nstaffing crisis at the JTDC, although there is still a long way to go.1  \n1 The TA notes for the Court’s information that there have also been some relevant legal\ndevelopments since the Court’s May 8, 2008, Order.  First, as the Court knows, the Union\n(Teamsters Local 714) has filed an appeal from the Order.  That appeal is currently pending in\nthe Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, with appellant’s brief due on December 3, 2008.  Second,\non September 30, 2008, another union, AFSCME, filed a petition with the Illinois Labor\nRelations Board (ILRB) to decertify the Teamsters as the collective bargaining agent for JDTC\n8\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:3302\nA. Accomplishments:  Improvement in Hiring, Conditions, and Operational\nCulture at the JTDC\nAs discussed above, significant progress has been made in the area of hiring practices,\nhiring offers/acceptance, and training.  There has been a clear operating practice established with\nOCJ as it relates to the educational and experience requirements for newly hired personnel at the\nJTDC.  As a result, there here have been sixty-one (61) job offerings or hirings to date.  By\nDecember 31, 2008 there will have been in excess of 17,920 hours of training provided to new\nemployees.  Now that these hiring processes are in place, OTA expects that hiring will continue\nat an accelerated pace.  \nThe OTA has seen some improvements in conditions at the JTDC as a result of its efforts\nto resolve the staffing crisis.  The practice of placing residents in lock down as a result of a\nshortage of staff has been all but eliminated, as there have been only four (4) such occurrences\nsince contracting with Wackenhut.  In addition, the incidence of residents not being provided\nwith one (1) hour of large muscle activity has substantially decreased.\nThe OTA has also been able to promote “culture of caring” into the daily life of all JTDC\nresidents and implement the OTA’s strategy to create “facilities within a facility” and “schools\nwithin a school.”   Broadly speaking, this strategy seeks to break the large JTDC into smaller\nliving units that are more manageable and secure.  To date one (1) such “facility within a\nfacility” (the Phoenix Unit, referenced above in Section I.B) is operational, and a second is\nscheduled to be operational by January 4, 2009.  OTA further anticipates that by January 4,\n2009, all special education residents will have been returned to the Educational Center (Nancy B.\npersonnel.  Third, the Teamsters have filed an unfair labor practices charge with the ILRB\nagainst the TA and the County, in an effort to prevent the AFSCME petition from going forward.\n9\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:3303\nJefferson School), and that “schools within a school” will have been established for the two (2)\n“facilities within a facility.”  The remainder of the residents at the JTDC will continue to receive\neducational services on their Unit/Pods until additional “facilities within a facility” go on line\nand secure and safe conditions can be reasonably assured.\nIn addition, a nationally recognized structured behavior management program, resident\nCognitive Behavior Training, has been initiated and incorporated into training academy for all\nstaff as each “facility within a facility” goes on-line. Early reports indicate a clear reduction in\nresident violence, violence in the school, and room confinement, as well as an increase in\nprogram and recreational opportunities.\nB. Continuing Staffing Challenges: Excessive Absenteeism Among Bargaining\nUnit JDCs and Impending Application of AIOC Requirements\nDespite these accomplishments, it is still not possible to protect the safety and security of\nJTDC residents without the contract security services provided by Wackenhut.  Wackenhut has\ndemonstrated through its contractual agreement with the OTA that it is quite capable of fulfilling \nits obligation with virtually no disruption to those services essential to the daily JTDC operation. \nThe support provided by Wackenhut has been crucial during this time of transition at the JTDC,\nparticularly in light of the severe, chronic absenteeism among Bargaining Unit JDCs.  \nAlthough new permanent JDCs have been hired and Wackenhut personnel have been\ncovering the JTDC Night Watch, the OTA has not yet been able to overcome the void in the\nnumber of uncovered JDC posts created by excessive absences by Bargaining Unit personnel. \nFor instance, over four (4) two (2) week pay periods (August 1-September 30, 2008), the average\nabsentee rate for JDCs was 34.3%.  Over this period, the absenteeism rate increased to 37% on\nFridays, 45% on Saturdays, and 50% on Sundays.   Detailed attendance summaries for this time\n10\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:3304\nperiod are attached here as Exhibit B.  \nThese absences present a very serious staffing problem.  Per pay period, six hundred and\nseventy-three (673) JDC posts must be covered.  In as much as there are fourteen (14) shifts in\neach pay period (not including Night Watch shifts, which are covered by Wackenhut) this would\nindicate that forty-eight (48) posts per day or twenty-four (24) posts per shift require coverage\nthrough the use of overtime in order to provide adequate security and safe conditions.  These\nabsences are a major obstacle in the way of solving the JTDC staffing crisis.\nAnother issue on the horizon that will affect staffing of the JDC post is the application of\nAIOC standards to JDC positions.  There are a number of current JTDC personnel in this\nposition who do not meet the AIOC educational and experience requirements.  It is still not\nknown what will happen to these personnel once the OCJ assumes administrative control of the\nJTDC.  The OTA is waiting to get more guidance from the OCJ on this issue before moving\nahead with implementation of the third (3rd) living Unit.\nDespite these issues, it is still anticipated that the need for contract personnel services at\nthe JTDC will lessen over time and eventually cease.  For the time being, however, it remains\nnecessary for the OTA to utilize contract personnel services in order to maintain safe and secure\nconditions at the JTDC.  \nIII.     Conclusion\nThe TA hopes that this report is useful to the Court.  A copy of this report has been\nserved on all parties of record, as well as on the Union.  The TA will gladly provide the Court\nany additional information it would like and/or appear in open court to answer questions on the\nrecord.  Unless the Court directs otherwise, the TA will prepare and file an updated report in six\n11\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 458 Filed: 11/11/08 Page 12 of 12 PageID #:3305\nmonths.    \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,\n    /s/ Earl Dunlap                                                     \nEarl L.

No page limitations were imposed on \n-1-\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 415 Filed: 05/08/08 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:2975\neither side. \n3.  After hearing the testimony and observing these witnesses, and after reviewing the \nbriefs submitted by the parties, the Court finds that the JTDC is dangerously understaffed and \nthat, as a result of this understaffing, the health and safety of the residents is at risk.  Tllis \nsituation constitutes an emergency.  The Court also finds that Mr. Dunlap's proposed plan to hire \ntemporary security staff and to sllift the assignments of some permanent staff to use them more \neffectively is a reasonable and narrowly-tailored response to the crisis at the JTDC and that it is \nnecessary to bring about compliance with (i) this Court's order of December 2002, approving the \nMemorandum of Agreement negotiated by the parties; (ii) the Agreed Supplemental Order \nentered in May 2006; and (iii) the Agreed Order Appointing A Transitional Administrator \nentered in August 2007. This Court fmds that the Union's proposed alternative of putting \ntemporary staff workers into existing vacancies on the day shifts would unnecessarily increase \nthe danger to both residents and staff because the new workers have not worked at this facility \nand do not have personal relationships with residents.  As Brenda Welch credibly testified, the \nUnion's proposed alternative would be \"very dangerous\" to both staff and residents. \n4.  In mal<ing these findings, this Court has relied heavily on the testimony of Mr. \nDunlap and Ms. Welch.  Both are highly qualified individuals in this field and have spent many \nhours at the JTDC working on these problems and considering alternative solutions. Both \nindividuals were appointed by this Court, and they have submitted to this Court thorough, \ndetailed, and credible reports about the operations and conditions at the JTDC.  The Union \noffered no testimony to undermine the testimony of these two court-appointed experts.  Mr. \nGarcia, the Union representative, is not an expert in the field and it was clear from his testimony \n-2-\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 415 Filed: 05/08/08 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:2976\nthat his sole focus was on the Union's rights under the Collective Bargaining Agreement and he \nhad not seriously addressed the larger problems created by this staffing crisis. \n5.  The Court, with the agreement of theTA and the plaintiffs, and without objection \nfrom the defendants, therefore grants theTA's Emergency Motion, overrules the Union's \nobjections, and awards the following relief: \na.  Pursuant to Paragraph 5(f) of this Court's August 14, 2007, Agreed \nOrder Appointing A Transitional Administrator, the Court orders that any and all \nlaws of the State of Illinois and Cook County Ordinances that may in any manner, \nrestrain, hinder or prevent the Transitional Administrator from contracting for the \ntemporary services of a private security firm, including Ordinances § § 34-121, 34-\n151, and 34-155, are hereby suspended in order to carry out the relief sought in the \nEmergency Motion. \nb.  Cook County shall pay all invoices relating to the contract for \ntemporary security services described in theTA's Emergency Motion within 30 \ndays after submission to Cook County. \nc.  The Court hereby suspends any and all laws of the State of Illinois and \nordinances of the County of Cook that require compliance with any provision of \nthe current Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\") between Cook County and \nthe Union, as well as said provisions of the CBA itself, including Section 4.11 of \nthe CBA, to the extent necessary and appropriate in theTA's judgment to provide \nadequate security and safe conditions at the JTDC. \n-3-\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 415 Filed: 05/08/08 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:2977\n6.

The upcoming transition of authority from the TA to the new \nSuperintendent is a welcome development, but one that requires careful planning \nand coordination to ensure that all of the progress achieved during the TA’s tenure \nis not lost. As the Court is aware, the TA has made repeated efforts over the past \nseveral months to engage OCJ in a joint transition process, with no response from \nOCJ. The TA is pleased that OCJ has finally selected a Superintendent, but the TA \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 768 Filed: 02/11/15 Page 2 of 10 PageID #:6143\nremains very concerned about the apparent lack of any other planning by OCJ for \nan orderly transition process.  \nUpon learning from this Court that a new Superintendent was hired, the TA \nconvened a meeting of the Doe parties to discuss the impending transition process. \nAt the meeting, the parties identified the issues most crucial to this litigation that \nwould bear on the transition. These issues are discussed in summary format below. \nThis list is by no means exhaustive, but it highlights the matters most in need of \nattention from OCJ and coordination between the TA and new Superintendent \nbefore transition can occur.1  \nIIII....  WWWWhhhhyyyy    TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttiiiioooonnnn    iiiissss    CCCCoooommmmpppplllliiiiccccaaaatttteeeedddd    \nAs an initial matter, it must be noted that the task of transitioning \nadministrative control of the facility from the OTA to the OCJ is complicated. It is \ncertainly not as simple as an administrative agency simply changing hands from \none appointed leader to another.   \nFor the past seven years, the JTDC has been under the administrative \ncontrol of the TA, who, by virtue of various court orders entered in this case, enjoyed \nflexibility that OCJ and the Superintendent will not have. For example, the OTA \nhas used, and continues to use, an expert consultant named Bob Dugan to \ncoordinate implementation of the Resident Management Information System, a \n                                            \n1 On February 5, OCJ revealed the identity of the newly-selected Superintendent – \nMr. Leonard Dixon – to the TA, and on February 10, OCJ made Mr. Dixon available \nfor a meeting with the TA. Although the TA has been disappointed by OCJ’s lack of \nengagement over the past several months, the TA was encouraged by the February \n10 meeting with Mr. Dixon and is hopeful that the transition process can finally \nbegin in earnest.   \n \n  2\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 768 Filed: 02/11/15 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:6144\ncritical component of compliance with MIP. Mr. Dugan is deeply invested in this \nimportant project, and losing him at this point would be a considerable setback.   \nThe order appointing the TA allowed Mr. Dunlap to involve Mr. Dugan by \ncontracting directly with him and circumventing County contracting requirements. \nOnce the TA’s appointment is over, however, OCJ will likely have to go through the \nCounty’s lengthy and sometimes-byzantine procurement and contracting procedures \nin order to contract directly with Mr. Dugan to keep him on board.   \nMore importantly, OCJ has never before undertaken operation of a facility of \nsimilar size or responsibility. The JTDC is the largest juvenile detention facility in \nthe country.  It has around-the-clock responsibility for the safety, security, and care \nof hundreds of young people. OCJ has no experience running an agency of this \nmagnitude or in operating a facility that demands attention on a 24/7 basis. Aside \nfrom selecting a new Superintendent, it is unclear whether OCJ has developed any \ninternal infrastructure for operating the facility. To give one example, the OTA has \nutilized an employment agency called CareerBuilder to help recruit and “on-board” \nnew staff.  OCJ’s personnel department has not indicated whether its Human \nResources department has the capacity to undertake this task or if it will need to \nretain CareerBuilder.       \nIIIIIIII....  SSSSttttaaaaffffffffiiiinnnngggg        \nOne of the most crucial issues facing the JTDC is and always has been \nmaintaining appropriate levels of qualified staff. Understaffing plagued the JTDC \nin the early years of the TA’s appointment. Although the TA succeeded in bringing \n  3\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 768 Filed: 02/11/15 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:6145\nstaffing up to an adequate level, attrition and absenteeism have been and continue \nto be vexing issues. Prior to transition, OCJ must have a system in place to \nmaintain appropriate staffing levels, which should include a plan for recruiting and \n“on-boarding” qualified staff in a relatively short period of time. Without such a \nplan, hiring will slow down considerably, and dangerous conditions will likely \nreturn. \nThe OCJ needs to consider a number of issues that will bear on its ability to \nmaintain appropriate staffing levels, issues that include, but are no means limited \nto, staff turnover rates, levels of vacancies resulting from staff discipline, leave of \nabsences, injuries, FMLA, and absence of County-recognized “relief factors” for \nmandated posts, benefit time accrual, etc.   \nFirst, OCJ must consider whether and to what extent it intends to use \ncontracted staffing services. As referenced above, the TA uses CareerBuilder to \nassist with the legwork of recruiting and screening new staff, which keeps the “on-\nboarding” period relatively short. If OCJ intends to continue to use CareerBuilder, \nit needs to begin negotiating a contract with them as soon as possible. Likewise, the \nTA has used Wackenhut, a private security company, to supplement staffing on \nvarious posts when current staffing levels fall sort. Fortunately, Wackenhut already \nhas a contract with the County, which will enable the OCJ to use Wackenhut’s \nservices at the JTDC when necessary for at least the next year.  \nIn addition, when transition occurs, JTDC employees will be required to meet \nstaffing requirements of the Administrative Office of Illinois Courts (AOIC). As the \n  4\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 768 Filed: 02/11/15 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:6146\nTA has referenced in past Court filings, see R.530, at 15-20; R.557, at 5-6, he has \nassisted the OCJ in this regard for the past several years by ensuring that all new \nhires meet the AOIC requirements. Under AOIC requirements, everyone who works \nat the JTDC must be officially “certified” by AOIC, a process that can take around \ntwo weeks, sometimes longer. However, in order to maintain a short “on-boarding” \nprocess, the TA has conditionally hired staff before they officially have AOIC \ncertification, which is not consistent with OCJ’s current practice of hiring only after \nemployees obtain AOIC certification. \nAdditionally, the Court and Doe parties will recall from prior briefing on the \nCourt-approved staffing plan that there are a certain number of JTDC staff \n(approximately 76) who currently work in positions where they have direct and \ncontinuous contact with JTDC residents but do not meet the AOIC degree \nrequirement. See R.589 (6/23/10 Memorandum Opinion and Order approving the \nTA’s staffing plan). OCJ must decide how to address this issue, and be prepared for \nthe possibility that AOIC requirements will result in the loss of that staff.               \nYet another complicating factor is the application of the Shakman v. Cook \nCounty, No. 69 cv 2145 (N.D. Ill.) consent decree to the JTDC. The Shakman \nplaintiffs have taken the position that Shakman applies to the JTDC, and that a \nShakman-compliance hiring plan must therefore be developed for the facility. The \nShakman plaintiffs asked the TA to develop such a plan, but in light of the pending \ntransition, the TA has suggested that it would be more appropriate for the \nShakman parties to discuss the issue with OCJ. See R.686, at 6-18 (referencing this \n  5\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 768 Filed: 02/11/15 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:6147\nissue in a past report). The TA believes that this task should be left to OCJ, which \ncan take its own position as to whether it is obligated to create a Shakman hiring \nplan, and which, if it is, will have to live with the long-term impacts of \nimplementing such a hiring plan. As the TA understands it, implementation of a \nShakman hiring plan could significantly delay the on-boarding process, so if OCJ \ndecides to create one, then it must be devised with special attention to this issue. \nIIIIIIIIIIII....  PPPPeeeerrrrssssoooonnnnnnnneeeellll    &&&&    LLLLaaaabbbboooorrrr        \nRelatedly, before transition can occur, the Superintendent must develop and \nimplement an employee discipline and grievance system to ensure that staff, \nespecially those that present a risk to JTDC residents or security of the facility, can \nbe held accountable. In this area, the TA has been in a unique position because the \nIllinois Labor Board not exercised jurisdiction over the TA’s actions. In addition, the \nTA’s current system utilizes a hearing officer and investigator who are contractors \nof the OTA, not employees of the County. If the Superintendent wants to retain \nthese individuals, OCJ will need to negotiate either employment or contractual \nrelationships with them. The OCJ and the Superintendent might find themselves in \na position where they simply desire to start from scratch when it comes to \nimplementing a system for handling discipline and grievances.   \nRelatedly, OCJ will need to start negotiating labor contracts with two \ndifferent JTDC collective bargaining units, a process that could take several years.  \nAt the same time, employees in some managerial positions are in the process of \nseeking collective-bargaining rights. OCJ must take steps during these processes to \n  6\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 768 Filed: 02/11/15 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:6148\nmaintain a functioning that allows OCJ to hold those staff accountable \nnotwithstanding any delays in the collective bargaining process. Likewise, OCJ \nmust approach collective bargaining in a manner that preserves the “Center within \na Center” system, which has been the cornerstone of the TA’s reform efforts. See \nR.589 (6/23/10 Memorandum Opinion and Order discussing this system). \nIIIIVVVV....  OOOOvvvveeeerrrrppppooooppppuuuullllaaaattttiiiioooonnnn        \nThe Superintendent and the OCJ must develop plans for dealing with \noverpopulation at the JTDC, an issue that the TA has previously raised with some \nurgency to this Court and with the Doe parties. As the TA has explained, JTDC’s \nfunctional operating capacity is 382. This is the number of residents that can be \nsafely housed at the JTDC due to various physical plant and operational \nlimitations. See R.711, at 7-10; R.759.  \nFor a period of time in the fall of 2014, the JTDC population exceeded the 382 \nfunctional operating capacity (the population peaked in mid-November at 418 \nresidents), with significant negative results. See R.759. Neither the County nor OCJ \nhad any mechanism in place for limiting the population, which, fortunately, fell \naround the holiday season (as it typically does).    \nPresently, the population is around 350, but if past trends are any indication \nof the future, the population can be expected to exceed 400 residents when the \nweather heats up in the summer. The Superintendent and OCJ must come up with \na plan for finding alternate placements for JTDC residents when the population \nexceeds 382. If OCJ allows the population to exceed 382 and stay at that level for \n  7\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 768 Filed: 02/11/15 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:6149\nany length of time, unsafe conditions will return to the facility. See generally R.759 \n(TA’s 11/26/2014 Special Report on Overcrowding). \nVVVV....      CCCCaaaappppiiiittttaaaallll    PPPPrrrroooojjjjeeeeccccttttssss    \nFinally, OCJ must develop a plan to maintain momentum on a number of \ncapital projects are at critical stages of implementation. One of the most difficult \nundertakings of the TA’s appointment has been implementation of capital projects \nthat bear on compliance with the MIP, such as installation of video cameras and \nimplementation of a Resident Management Information System (RMIS). See R.530, \nat 9-11; R.646, at 9-10; R.680, at 7-9; R.686, at 5-6; and R.711, at 5-6. To put it \nsimply, there is an incredible amount of red-tape in County bureaucracy that must \nbe overcome for projects of this magnitude to be implemented. Fortunately, the \nattorneys who represent the County in this matter have dedicated themselves over \nthe past few years to shepherding these projects along, and real progress has been \nmade. The long-awaited camera system is finally in place, and other projects are \nmoving. However, the TA is concerned that momentum will be lost without the \npressure of this litigation, unless OCJ has a system in place for continuing to see \nthese projects through.  \nThe most important of these is the RMIS, which is still in the contract stage.  \nAs the TA has explained in prior reports, implementation of the RMIS system is \nrequired for compliance with various portions of the MIP. See e.g., R.711, at 5-6. As \nnoted above, the TA has retained Bob Dugan, a nationally-recognized expert in the \nfield, to oversee this and other technology-related capital projects tied to MIP \n  8\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 768 Filed: 02/11/15 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:6150\ncompliance (for example, the camera and rounds tracking system, the wireless \nnetwork, and the electronic medical records systems). The TA very strongly \nrecommends that the Superintendent and OCJ make every effort to keep Mr. \nDugan on board so that he may see this project through to completion. Not only is \nMr. Dugan at the top of his field, but he also developed institutional knowledge \nconcerning the facility’s unique needs and the many different players within the \nCook County and Cermak Health Systems bureaucracies who must participate in \nimplementation.   \nCCCCoooonnnncccclllluuuussssiiiioooonnnn    \n  As always, the TA stands ready and willing to work with OCJ, this Court, \nand the Doe parties to achieve an orderly transition. Although OCJ has not engaged \nwith the TA or the Doe parties prior to this point, the TA sincerely hopes that the \nappointment of Superintendent Dixon will enable the parties to begin working \ntogether and that this Report will assist in that important process. \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED \n,\n              /s/ Jon Loevy \n              Attorney for the Transitional  \n                 Administrator \nArthur Loevy \nJon Loevy \nElizabeth Mazur \nLOEVY & LOEVY \n312 N.

The purpose of this Order is to appoint a Transitional Administrator (TA) with \nthe authority and responsibility to bring the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center \n(JTDC) into substantial compliance with the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and the \nModified Implementation Plan (MIP), and to prepare the JTDC for the transition of \nadministrative authority over its operations to the Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court \nof Cook County. The Order also requires the TA to report to the Court on a regular basis.  \n  Whereas the TA’s prior reports have provided an overview of the TA’s reform efforts, \nsee Dckt. Nos. 458, 530, 646, 680, this report focuses specifically on transition of the JTDC to \n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 686 Filed: 04/08/13 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:5469\nthe Office of the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County (OCJ), a topic the TA believes \nto be of most interest to the Court at this point.1  \nI.  Office of the Transitional Administrator  \nThe OTA has undertaken a number of projects to facilitate transition to OCJ, described in \ndetail below. \nA.  Compliance Assessment Reports \nThe OTA has conducted a systemic assessment of the facility’s compliance with the non-\nhealth care provision MOA and MIP.2 A memo summarizing the findings of the compliance \nassessment is attached here as Exhibit A.   \nAs the summary shows, the JTDC is in substantial or partial compliance with \napproximately 71% of all non-health care provisions of the MOA and MIP. The Executive Team \nmeets weekly to review progress toward compliance. This document will be updated on regular \nbasis as the JTDC moves toward substantial compliance in more areas.    \nAs the compliance assessment reveals, progress toward compliance has been significant, \nbut work remains, particularly in areas relating to quality assurance. In the absence of an \nadequate Management Information System (discussed in further detail below), provisions \nimpacting quality assurance cannot be implemented. The TA is happy to comment in further \ndetail on this assessment at the Court’s request.    \n                                            \n1 The TA will provide a report that follows the format of his prior reports if the Court would find \nit useful. The TA also intends to appear in Court for the April 11, 2013 status and can answer \nany questions at that time.  \n       \n2 The OTA is working with outside experts to assess compliance with the medical and mental \nhealth aspects of the MOA and MIP. These assessments should be complete by May 1, 2013. \nThe TA is optimistic about the outcome of these assessments as the JTDC was recently \naccredited by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, an agency whose standards \nare on par with those set forth in the MOA and MIP.   \n  2\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 686 Filed: 04/08/13 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:5470\nAs the TA previously reported to the Court, the TA anticipates seeking a waiver of \ncertain provisions of the MIP. For example, Paragraph 24 Section 2.4, of the MIP requires the \ndevelopment of a special needs unit that can house suicidal residents. The TA does not anticipate \ncompliance with this provision to the letter because residents who are deemed a suicide risk are \nno longer held at the JTDC. Instead, the TA has adopted a policy of referring these residents to \nexternal psychiatric or medical facilities. This approach achieves the same goal as Paragraph 24, \nSection 2.4 of the MIP because it ensures these youth an appropriate setting that can meet their \nspecial needs. In addition, the TA’s approach conserves JTDC operational resources and \nmaximizes the County’s ability to access federal funding.  \nSimilarly, Paragraph 33, Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the MIP require mental health and \nsubstance abuse screening results to be documented in DSI, the JTDC’s current information \nmanagement system. The TA will seek a waiver of this provision because DSI does not support \nthis function and the DSI system will soon be phased out. Instead, this information will be kept \nin the electronic medical records system that is currently being developed. A tentative list of the \nMIP provisions that the TA seeks to have waived and/or modified is attached as Exhibit A \n(compliance report), page 5. This list has been shared with the Doe parties.  \nB.  Transition Report \nThe OTA is also preparing a Transition Report, which will detail the operational \ndevelopment of the JTDC and offer a recommended transition plan to OCJ. Although substantial \nprogress has been made on this document, it is still a work in progress. The OTA expects it to be \ncomplete by June 1, 2013.  \n \n \n  3\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 686 Filed: 04/08/13 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:5471\nC.  Safety and Information Report \nThe OTA is also preparing a Safety and Information Report, which will address most \nserious issues that may not be fully resolved prior to transition. Although the Report itself is a \nwork in progress, the issues it will address are of crucial importance to the transition and warrant \ndiscussion here.   \n1.     Management Information Systems (MIS) \nAs the TA has previously reported, the JTDC’s management information system is a \ncrucial issue to be addressed. The JTDC relies on its current system (DSI) to keep track of vital \nresident information.  The system suffers two major flaws.  First and foremost, the system’s \nvendor will no longer support it (meaning that DSI will cease to be available to the JTDC).  \nSecond, the DSI cannot support requirements of the MOA and MIP, such as those that call for \ncomputerized incident reports and quality assurance indicators.   \nThe OTA has retained an expert in the field, Robert Dugan, who is working closely with \nOTA and the Cook County Bureau of Technology to develop a MIS system to replace DSI that \nwill comply with the MOA and MIP. Mr. Dugan previously led National Performance Based \nStandards Project for Juvenile Confinement Facilities for the U.S. Department of Justice/Office \nof Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The TA is therefore confident that Mr. Dugan \nwill develop an appropriate system. The County appears to be taking this issue very seriously, as \nit has assigned a full time staff person to work with OTA and Mr. Dugan on this project. Full \ncommitment from all parties to this project is necessary, especially because OCJ has indicated a \nstrong desire for an appropriate MIS system to be in place prior to transition.   \n \n \n  4\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 686 Filed: 04/08/13 Page 5 of 9 PageID #:5472\n2.     Capital Projects \nAs the TA has previously reported to the Court on multiple occasions, there are number \nof outstanding capital projects that must be completed. Of most critical importance to the safety \nand security at the facility are installation of the camera and electronic rounds tracking system, \nreplacement of ceiling tiles in resident rooms, and remodeling of the recreational spaces. \nThe delays and setbacks associated with these projects at the County-level are too \nnumerous to list here. Although Cook County Office of Capital Planning has reported anticipated \ntimelines for these projects in the past, it has been unable to adhere to those timelines. For \nexample, last fall the Director of Capital Planning reported to the Cook County Board of \nCommissioners that installation of the camera system should begin in May or June 2013. It \nappears unlikely that this timeline will be met, however, as the County is still working out a \ncontract with the vendor. \nThe TA has requested that his counsel and counsel for the Doe parties confer on a weekly \nbasis to monitor these projects closely for delays during the transition process. Although it might \nnot be realistic to expect these projects to be complete prior to transition, the TA feels strongly \nthat they need to be on an irreversible course of completion before transition occurs. In other \nwords, the TA will not recommend transition unless the Court obtains firm assurance that these \nprojects will be completed by a date certain and maintains some mechanism for compelling \nadherence the stated timetable.  \nII.  Steps Taken By OCJ \nThe TA has been working collaboratively with the OCJ throughout the past several \nmonths, with the goal of educating the OCJ as to how the JTDC currently operates so that OCJ \n  5\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 686 Filed: 04/08/13 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:5473\ncan plan for transition. While the TA cannot speak for the OCJ, the TA is also aware of the \nfollowing steps being taken by the OCJ.   \n1.       Annie E. Casey Foundation Assessment     \nAs the TA mentioned in his last report to the Court, the Annie E. Casey Foundation \n(AECF) has offered its services to the OCJ to conduct an operational assessment of the JTDC on \nthe OCJ’s behalf. Although the TA previously reported that the AECF assessment was expected \nto take place in January 2013, AECF has in fact scheduled the assessment for May 14-16, 2013. \nThe Doe parties and OCJ have agreed that the AECF assessment will be used only to assist OCJ \nin its preparation for transition; it will not be used in this litigation.   \n2.       Appointment of an Executive Director \nAs the TA understandings it, OCJ has begun a national search for an Executive \nDirector/Superintendent to replace the TA, but OCJ is still early in the screening process. As the \nTA has previously written, the TA strongly recommends that the incoming Executive Director \nbecome familiar with all operations at the facility and that he or she articulate a multi-year plan \nto maintain adequate conditions of confinement at the JTDC and to ensure compliance with the \nremaining provisions of the MOA and MIP.  Consistent with Paragraph 11(b)(ii) of the Order \nAppointing a Transitional Administrator, some mechanism should be in place to ensure that OCJ \noperates the JTDC in a manner consistent with the MOA and MIP.   \nIII.  Other Matter: Shakman and the JTDC \nThere is one final issue of which the Court should be made aware. The Plaintiffs in \nShakman v. Democratic Organization of Cook County, No. 69 C 2145 (N.D. Ill.), have recently \nrequested that the TA develop and implement a long-term Shakman compliance plan at the \nJTDC. The TA is reluctant to undertake the project for two reasons.   \n  6\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 686 Filed: 04/08/13 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:5474\nFirst, it is unclear whether the Shakman consent decree extends to the JTDC, which \ntransferred to OCJ by state statute in 2008. The purpose of the Shakman consent decree is to \nremedy Cook County hiring practices, but the County has had no control over hiring and firing \ndecisions at JTDC for several years.3 Those issues have been handled exclusively by OTA, and \nthey will soon be handled by OCJ. As the TA understands it, there is no other agency governed \nby OCJ that is required to implement a Shakman plan, and the TA questions other OCJ would \neven be required to follow whatever plan TA might implement.  \nSecond, even if the Shakman consent decree does extend to the JTDC, the TA feels \nstrongly that OTA should not assume responsibility for implementing it. OTA has already been \ngiven the enormous responsibility of implementing multiple statutes, regulations and court orders \nthat govern all aspects of JTDC operations. In addition to implementing these decrees, the TA \nnow has the added responsibility of coordinating an orderly transition to OCJ, which is a major \nundertaking in itself. Although achievable, this process is made more challenging by the fact that \nOCJ is not party to this litigation. The OTA needs to focus all of its resources on seeing this \ndelicate and complex process through. Adding yet another consent decree and another federal \ncourt monitor to the mix at this point will further complicate (and potentially derail) this process. \nFrom the TA’s perspective, it is in the best interest of the JTDC and the Doe litigation for any \nShakman long-term compliance plan to be implemented by the OCJ and Cook County after \ntransition is complete. \nHowever, out of respect for whatever process might need to occur in the Shakman \nlitigation, the TA has agreed to cooperate with the Shakman parties to the best of his ability. If \n                                            \n3 As the TA has reported to the Court on many prior occasions, OTA has used an outside \npersonal agency for most of its recruiting and hiring at the JTDC.  The OTA instructs the agency \non the criteria it must consider, which includes nothing about political affiliation.   \n  7\n\nCase: 1:99-cv-03945 Document #: 686 Filed: 04/08/13 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:5475\n(1) the County and OCJ agree that OCJ must adhere to a long-term Shakman compliance plan at \nthe JTDC, and if (2) the County and OCJ feel it is necessary to begin working on that plan before \nthe Doe transition is complete, then the TA will follow their lead and cooperate in their process. \nFor example, if OCJ devises a Shakman plan that is somehow inconsistent with the JTDC’s \noperational needs, then the TA will make sure that OCJ understands the issues and plans \naccordingly. Such a role would be an appropriate one for the TA in the Shakman process.        \nConclusion \nThe TA hopes that his report is useful to the Court and the Doe parties. A copy of this \nreport will be served on all parties of record, as well as the OCJ. As always, the TA will be glad \nto answer questions or address any concerns.  \n \n \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \n \n                 /s/Elizabeth Mazur     \n              Attorney for the Transitional  \n                 Administrator \n \nArthur Loevy \nJon Loevy \nElizabeth Mazur \nSteven Art \nLOEVY & LOEVY \n312 N.
