    "summary": "<p>Pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") conducted an investigation of conditions at the Ft. Bayard Medical Center (\"Ft. Bayard\"), a public nursing home facility in southwest New Mexico, operated by the state in an old military facility.  The investigation resulted in a May 1, 2006, findings letter being sent by DOJ to the governor.  The letter stated that in July and October 2005,  the DOJ conducted an investigation of the facility pursuant to CRIPA authority.  The investigation relied upon site visits by DOJ personnel and consulting experts, reviews of medical records and facility documents setting out procedures, policies, and practices, and interviews of Ft. Bayard administrators, professionals, staff, and residents. </p><p>The letter noted that earlier, when concluding the first of the on-site visits, the DOJ expressed to state personnel \"deep concerns\" concerns about the life-threatening conditions at the facility.  These prompted the Chief of the DOJ Civil Rights Division's Special Litigation Section to send a July 25, 2005 letter to counsel for the State of New Mexico.  That letter memorialized the concerns and documented the nursing home's inadequate medical care and dangerous psychotropic medication usage, requesting that the State take immediate remedial action to address the most serious deficiencies.  By the time of the second on-site visit, according to the May 2006, findings letter, the State had taken several steps to begin to remedy the deficiencies that had been identified.</p><p>Significant deficiencies remained, however, such that the findings letter advised the state that residents of Ft. Bayard suffered significant harm and risk of harm from (1) the facility's inadequate medical and nursing care services; (2) improper and dangerous psychotropic medication practices; (3) failure to provide adequate safety; (4) inadequate nutritional and hydration services; and (5) inadequate restorative care and specialized rehabilitation services.  Additionally, the investigation found that the state failed to provide services to certain Ft. Bayard residents in the most integrated setting, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et seq. </p><p>In every medical record reviewed, the DOJ consultants found substantial departures from the generally accepted standards in nursing home care. In nearly every record reviewed where psychotropic medication was prescribed, there were often multiple failings, including: the absence of a diagnosis justifying the use of the medication; the absence of behavioral indications warranting the administration of the medication; the absence of any evidence that non-medication interventions were tried and/or considered and found ineffective; the absence of monitoring of the  medication's efficacy; the absence of side-effect monitoring; the absence of appropriate response to medication side-effects; and the absence of informed consent for the use of the medication.  Relatedly, DOJ found that medications were also prescribed in excessive dosages.</p><p>The letter set out specific examples of deaths, pain, and suffering resulting from the many deficient practices at Ft. Bayard. Additionally, the investigation noted a possibility that Ft. Bayard staff may have allowed residents to suffer needless pain while staff members took (or sold) pain medication intended for residents. Residents were often at risk from falls, yet few had sufficient fall prevention planning provided for them.  Others would repeatedly become combative with other residents or staff without adequate interventions from staff to ameliorate the harm or risk of harm. The environment itself at Ft. Bayard was unsuited for usage as a nursing home, according to the findings letter.  The DOJ also found that Ft. Bayard's nutritional and hydration services substantially departed from generally accepted professional standards of care and that the nursing home offered grossly substandard activity programs for its residents. While most residents were appropriately placed in a nursing home and their reintegration in the community would be inappropriate, those able to and who could benefit from community residence were deprived of that option by Ft. Bayard's inadequacies in assessing and planning for such transitions, as well as by the state's few non-nursing home resources for such persons.</p><p>The DOJ findings letter proposed what it termed as \"minimal\" remedial actions to remedy the deficiencies, invited the state to address the issues, and alerted the state to the possibility of a CRIPA lawsuit brought by the United States to compel remedial action.</p><p>The DOJ's letter described a cooperative approach with the state during the course of the investigation.  This atmosphere evidently continued during ensuing negotiations, because the state and the DOJ soon entered into a settlement agreement obligating the state to improve a wide range of policies and practices at Ft. Bayard.  The settlement contained substantive provisions addressing (1) timely assessments and care planning, (2) safe and appropriate psychotropic medication usage, (3) improved and appropriate pain management practices, and disciplinary reporting of employee diversion of residents' medications, (4) adequate protection of residents from harm from neglect, abuse, and assaults, (5) fall prevention, (6) appropriate nutrition and hydration services, and aspiration prevention, (7) activities program improvements, (8) improvements in environmental aspects of the facility, particularly increasing privacy, (9) treatment in the most integrated setting appropriate to individualized needs, and (10) compliance with applicable federal laws and implementing regulations, including  Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3 et seq.; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r et seq.; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12132 et seq.; and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.</p><p>The settlement allowed for DOJ and its consultants to retain access to Ft Bayard, its residents, and documents and records, for monitoring and technical assistance purposes.  The state had to implement the changes called for in the settlement document which, by its terms, expired in two years. </p><p>Attorneys for the state and DOJ signed and filed the agreement on or about May 14-16, 2007, in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico and, at the same time, the United States filed its complaint against the state and the state official responsible for the operation of Ft. Bayard.  The CRIPA-based complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, citing the deficiencies at the facility and alleging that the defendants' conduct violated residents' federal constitutional, statutory, and regulatory rights, including those due process protections provided by the Fourteenth Amendment, and the statutory protections provided by Social Security Act, the ADA, and the Rehabilitation Act (and implementing regulations).</p><p>On Jan. 28, 2008, the parties jointly moved to partially dismiss the settlement agreement. In the motion, the DOJ stated that after a number of visits, it was satisfied that the facility was in compliance with the Environment and Most Integrated Setting sections of the settlement agreement. The other aspects of the settlement agreement were not affected by the motion. The Court (Judge William P. Johnson) granted the motion on Feb. 5.</p><p>On Oct. 8, 2008, Judge Johnson granted a joint motion to extend the effective date of the settlement agreement until Nov. 2011. The Court also required that the defendants submit to the DOJ plans of correction setting forth the tasks and timetables for the state to come into compliance with all the settlement agreement provisions.</p><p>On Oct. 11, 2009, Judge Johnson accepted the parties joint corrective action plan outlining timetables for implementing the settlement agreement. </p><p>On Oct. 17, 2011, Judge Johnson granted the parties' joint motion to dismiss the complaint. The parties agreed that the facility was in substantial compliance with the settlement agreement.  </p>",

INTRODUCTION\n1.  On April 18, 2005, the United States notified New Mexico\nofficials of its intent to investigate conditions of resident\ncare and treatment at the Fort Bayard Medical Center \n(“Ft. Bayard”), a nursing home in Bayard, New Mexico, pursuant to\nthe Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), \n42 U.S.C. § 1997.\n2.  In July and September 2005, the United States toured \nFt. Bayard with consultants in the fields of geriatric medical\ncare, geriatric nursing, nursing home administration, and\ncommunity placement. \n3.  Throughout the course of the investigation, the United\nStates received complete cooperation and access to Ft. Bayard \n\n-2-\nand documents from the State of New Mexico.\n4.  On May 1, 2006, the United States issued a findings\nletter pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997(a)(1), which concluded that\ncertain conditions at Ft. Bayard violated the constitutional and\nfederal statutory rights of residents of the nursing home.\n5.  The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1345.  Venue is proper in this\ndistrict pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).\n6.  The Defendants are the State of New Mexico; and Michelle\nLujan Grisham, Secretary, Department of Health, in her official\ncapacity only.  The Defendants are responsible, in whole or in\npart, for the operation and conditions at the Ft. Bayard Medical\nCenter.  The Defendants also acknowledge they have the authority\nand responsibility to implement all requirements of this\nSettlement Agreement, including implementation at Ft. Bayard and\nwith regard to the State’s responsibilities under Title II of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 \net seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n29 U.S.C. § 794.  Accordingly, the Defendants shall ensure that\nall state agencies take any action necessary to comply with the\nprovisions of this Settlement Agreement.\n7.  This Settlement Agreement is not intended to have any\npreclusive effect except between the parties.  Should the issue\nof the preclusive effect of this Settlement Agreement be raised\n\n-3-\nin any proceeding other than this civil action, the parties agree\nto certify that this Settlement Agreement was intended to have no\nsuch preclusive effect.\n8.  This Settlement Agreement is not intended to impair or\nexpand the right of any person or organization to seek relief\nagainst the State, or its officials, employees, or agents for\ntheir conduct or the conduct of state employees; accordingly,\nthis Settlement Agreement does not alter legal standards\ngoverning any such claims, including those under New Mexico law.\n9.  Nothing in this Settlement Agreement shall prevent the\nState from modifying or closing Ft. Bayard or from developing\nalternative community placements for the residents currently at\nFt. Bayard.\n10. This Settlement Agreement resolves the CRIPA\ninvestigation conducted by the United States Department of\nJustice (“DOJ”) and addresses the corrective measures set forth\nby DOJ in its May 1, 2006 letter to the State (“Findings\nLetter”).

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nSpecial Litigation Section - PHB \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC  20530 \nMay 1, 2006 \nThe Honorable Bill Richardson \nGovernor of New Mexico \nOffice of the Governor \nState Capitol\nRoom 400 \nSanta Fe, NM  87501 \nRe:\t CRIPA Investigation of Fort Bayard Medical Center,\nBayard, New Mexico \nDear Governor Richardson: \nI am writing to report the findings of the Civil Rights\nDivision’s investigation of conditions and practices at the Fort\nBayard Medical Center (“Ft. Bayard”) in Bayard, New Mexico.  On \nApril 18, 2005, we notified you of our intent to conduct an\ninvestigation of Ft. Bayard pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  CRIPA \ngives the Department of Justice authority to seek remedies for\nany pattern and practice of conduct that violates the\nconstitutional or federal statutory rights of nursing home\nresidents who are served in public institutions. \nIn July and October 2005, we conducted on-site inspections\nof Ft. Bayard with expert consultants in various disciplines.\nOur first tour focused on the general care and treatment of\nresidents, while our second tour examined the facility’s\ndischarge planning and community integration practices.  Before,\nduring, and after our site visits, we reviewed a wide variety of\nrelevant facility documents, including policies and procedures,\nand medical and other records relating to the care and treatment\nof Ft. Bayard residents.  During our visits, we also interviewed\nFt. Bayard administrators, professionals, staff, and residents.\nIn keeping with our pledge to share information and to provide\ntechnical assistance where appropriate regarding our\ninvestigatory findings, we conveyed our preliminary findings to \n\n- 2 -\n\ncounsel for the State of New Mexico (“State”) and Ft. Bayard\nadministrators during verbal exit presentations at the close of\neach of our on-site visits.  We conveyed our deep concerns about\nthe life-threatening conditions at the facility.  Shanetta Y. \nCutlar, Chief of the Special Litigation Section, sent a July 25,\n2005 letter to counsel for the State of New Mexico memorializing\nour concerns and documenting the nursing home’s inadequate\nmedical care and dangerous psychotropic medication usage and\nrequesting that the State take immediate remedial action to\naddress the most serious deficiencies.1 \nBefore outlining our findings, we would like to express our\nappreciation to the State and to Ft. Bayard staff and\nadministration for the extensive cooperation and assistance\nprovided to us throughout our investigation.  We particularly\nappreciated the assistance of Secretary Michelle Lujan Grisham\nand Aging and Long-Term Services Secretary Deborah Armstrong.  We \nhope to continue to work with the State and officials at Ft.\nBayard in the same cooperative manner going forward. \nConsistent with our statutory obligations under CRIPA, I now\nwrite to advise you formally of the findings of our\ninvestigation, the facts supporting them, and the minimal\nremedial steps that are necessary to remedy the deficiencies set\nforth below.  42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a).  Specifically, we have\nconcluded that numerous conditions and practices at Ft. Bayard\nviolate the constitutional and federal statutory rights of its\nresidents.  In particular, we find that residents of Ft. Bayard\nsuffer significant harm and risk of harm from the facility’s\ninadequate medical and nursing care services; improper and\ndangerous psychotropic medication practices; failure to provide\nadequate safety; inadequate nutritional and hydration services;\nand inadequate restorative care and specialized rehabilitation\nservices.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982); Title XIX of\nthe Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395, 1396r and\nimplementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. § 483 Subpart B (Medicaid and \n1  Department of Health Secretary Michelle Lujan Grisham\nresponded to Ms. Cutlar’s letter on August 12, 2005.  In her \nletter, Secretary Grisham set forth the actions the State pledged\nto take on an immediate basis to address the dangerous\nconditions.  We appreciate the State’s willingness to address\nthese issues on an expedited basis.  During our September 2005\ntour of Ft. Bayard, we spoke with Secretaries Grisham and\nArmstrong about our findings and the State’s response.  We were \npleased to note during this tour that the State had taken several\nsteps to begin to remedy the deficiencies we identified. \n\n- 3 -\n\nMedicare Program Provisions).  The deficiencies are evidenced \nthrough preventable injuries, illnesses, and deaths.  In \naddition, we find that the State fails to provide services to\ncertain Ft. Bayard residents in the most integrated setting, as\nrequired by the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42\nU.S.C. § 12132 et seq.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); see also Olmstead \nv. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). \nI.  FACILITY DESCRIPTION \nFt. Bayard is a state-owned and -operated nursing home in\nthe southwestern part of the state.  The nursing home is a three-\nstory 1920s building located on an old military facility.\nAlthough the facility is licensed to provide care for 210\nresidents, at the time of our tour, the facility was only serving\n169 residents.  The majority of residents are age 65 or older,\nbut the nursing home admits a significant percentage of younger\nresidents – almost a third – who bring with them an accompanying\nset of behavioral management issues and a wide diversity of\ninterests.  At the time of our tour, about 60 residents had a\nmental health diagnosis and four residents were diagnosed with\ndevelopmental disabilities.  About 90 residents had dementia and \n112 were diagnosed with depression. \nThe facility is divided into six “neighborhoods.”  One \nneighborhood provides nursing services to veterans only.  There \nare few private rooms.  Most rooms can house three residents,\nalthough there are several rooms housing two residents.  The \naverage length of stay at Ft. Bayard is a little more than four\nyears. \nII.  FINDINGS \nA.  INADEQUATE MEDICAL AND NURSING CARE \nResidents of publicly-operated institutions, such as Ft.\nBayard, have a Fourteenth Amendment due process right to adequate\nhealth care.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315; Yvonne L. v. New Mexico \nDep’t of Human Services, 959 F.2d 883 (10th Cir. 1992) (persons\nwith developmental disabilities committed to State institutions\nhave a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to\nreasonable care and safety); see also 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(A),\n42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(A) (facility must provide nursing and\nmedical services to “attain or maintain the highest practicable\nphysical, mental, and psycho-social well-being of each\nresident”). \n\n- 4 -\n\nOur investigation revealed a wide range of dangerously\ndeficient medical and nursing care practices.  These practices\nnot only failed to comply with federal regulations or meet\nprofessional standards, but were in fact aiding and contributing\nto the needless suffering and untimely deaths of Ft. Bayard’s\nresidents.  We found numerous situations where residents’ last \ndays of life were spent in miserable pain as they died from the\neffects of what appeared to be reckless and almost willful\ndisregard to their health and safety.  In fact, in practically\nevery record we reviewed of deceased or current Ft. Bayard\nresidents, we discovered life-threatening omissions and\ncommissions of treatment.  In every medical record we reviewed,\nour consultants found substantial departures from the generally\naccepted standards in nursing home care. \nThe pervasive medical and nursing care deficiencies we\nidentified tend to fall into three areas.  First, the nursing\nhome fails to adequately assess, plan for, or care for the\nresidents’ healthcare needs.  Second, the nursing home’s use of\npsychotropic medications is dangerous.  And third, the nursing\nhome subjects its residents to undue and unnecessary pain and\nsuffering. \n1.  Inadequate Healthcare Plans \nFt. Bayard is required by federal regulations to establish a\ncomprehensive care plan for each resident that specifically\naddresses individualized needs.  42 C.F.R. § 483.20.  Assessments \nmust be conducted upon admission and periodically thereafter to\nensure there is a comprehensive, accurate, and standardized\nrecord of each resident’s functional capacity.  42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.20.  These assessments are then used by staff to develop a\ncomprehensive care plan specific to the needs of each resident.\n42 C.F.R. § 483.20(a)(1).  Adequate assessments include\nmeasurable objectives and timetables to assist the clinical and\nmental health staff in ensuring that all of the resident’s needs\nare met in a timely manner.  42 C.F.R. § 483.20(k)(i).  The \nphysician is required by federal regulations to take an active\nrole in the care of each resident by reviewing, at each visit,\nthe resident’s total program of care, including medications and\ntreatments.  42 C.F.R. § 483.40(b).  This care plan must be\nperiodically reviewed and revised, using the results of the\nresident’s regular assessments, to assure continued accuracy.\n42 C.F.R. § 483.20(k)(2)(iii). \nIn our judgment, Ft. Bayard fails to comply with every one\nof the above regulations.  Ft. Bayard staff fail to assess\nadequately, plan, and respond to the serious medical and nursing \n\n- 5 -\n\nneeds of its residents.  We highlight below a few examples where\nthese failings have resulted in needless suffering and untimely,\nand in some deeply distressing cases, preventable deaths. \nC\t On July 20, 2005, a 71-year-old resident with diabetes died.\nThe resident’s medical chart revealed numerous instances of \nabnormal blood-sugar findings during the six-month period\npreceding his death.  Indeed, on June 25, 2005, the\nresident’s blood-sugar was so low that it was life-\nthreatening.  Neither medical nor nursing staff at Ft.\nBayard responded.  No one at Ft. Bayard developed a\nhealthcare plan to respond to this life-threatening\nsituation.  Staff appeared to ignore obvious “red flags,”\nand the resident died.  There is a strong possibility that\nthe resident died as a result of Ft. Bayard’s improper care\nplanning and failure to implement an adequate response to\nthe resident’s diabetes and diabetic emergencies. \nC\t Another startlingly similar example of Ft. Bayard’s failure\nto develop and implement adequate care plans in the face of\nabnormal test results involves the case of a 56-year-old\nresident who, on at least two separate occasions, had\nlaboratory tests that revealed the resident was not\nreceiving an adequate amount of his needed anti-convulsant\nmedication.  Despite these findings, no plan was developed\nor implemented to correct the seizure mediation regimen.  As \na result, the resident subsequently suffered continuous\nuncontrolled seizures and had to be admitted to an acute-\ncare hospital.  The resident died shortly thereafter.  Ft. \nBayard’s failure to develop and implement an adequate\nseizure management program directly contributed to this\nresident’s death and represents a gross departure from\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  If Ft. Bayard\nstaff had adequately monitored and responded to the changes\nin the resident’s condition, the resident would not have\ndied at the time and in the manner he did. \nC\t Another Ft. Bayard resident died in April 2005, within a\nweek after being admitted for rehabilitation following hip\nfracture surgery.  Upon admission, this 92-year-old resident\nwas recognized as being at high risk for aspiration due to\nhis Parkinson’s disease, and Ft. Bayard staff developed a\nspecial diet and a plan for feeding precautions for him.\nPart of the feeding plan required that he be fed liquids\neither with a spoon or by being given “very small sips.” Two\ndays later, despite these precautions, nursing staff\nattempted to feed him greater quantities of liquid than they\nshould have.  Because the resident was “not swallowing,” the \n\n- 6 -\n\nliquid had to be \"removed\" from his mouth.  Two days after\nthat, he was noted to be coughing and choking during meals,\nbecame delirious (likely due to the fact that he had\ndeveloped aspiration pneumonia, an infection or inflammation\nin the lungs caused by the inhalation of food or fluid), and\nwas \"call[ing] out for help.\"  He soon became lethargic, but\nnursing staff continued their dangerous practice of feeding\nhim the liquid improperly.  The resident died two days later\nof chronic aspiration - one week after being admitted to Ft.\nBayard.  Ft. Bayard never assessed his respiratory status or\nadequately followed-up on his choking and coughing episodes.\nIf his feeding plan had been appropriately implemented, the\nresident would not have died at the time or in the manner \nthat he did.  Thus, this resident’s care was a substantial\ndeparture from generally accepted professional standards. \nC\t Another untimely death occurred in the case of a 94-year-old\nresident who died of aspiration pneumonia in May 2005 after\njust over a year’s stay at Ft. Bayard.  She was admitted due \nto progressive confusion, Alzheimer’s Disease, agitation,\nand a number of other medical conditions.  Her condition \ndeclined during her stay at Ft. Bayard, and during the last\nseveral months of her life, she had problems swallowing.\nShe was seen on multiple occasions by Ft. Bayard’s staff\nresponsible for diagnosing swallowing difficulties.2  Those \nstaff identified the swallowing difficulty and made specific\nrecommendations to the nurses to address the risk of \naspiration pneumonia for this resident.  However, nursing\nstaff failed to implement the recommendations, which is a\nstark departure from generally accepted professional\nstandards.  The resident aspirated numerous times,\nultimately contributing to her untimely death. \nC\t Yet another untimely death involved a 67-year-old resident\nadmitted to Ft. Bayard in January 2005.  He was diagnosed\nwith advanced Alzheimer’s Disease, hypertension, coronary\nartery disease, and peripheral vascular disease.  He also \nhad significant behavioral problems and was easily agitated.\nHe died just over three months after being admitted to the\nnursing home.  During his stay at Ft. Bayard, he was\ndescribed as “consistently agitated,” for which he was\nprescribed psychotropic medications.  Staff also noted that \nhe “ate poorly,” and “spent most of his day in a wheelchair \n2  Residents with swallowing difficulties are at risk of\ndeveloping life-threatening aspiration. \n\n- 7 -\n\nattempting to remove the lap buddy.”3  In February 2005,\nx-rays of bones in one of the resident’s feet revealed that,\ndue to a combination of infection and the resulting loss of\nbone calcium, the bone had developed a “moth eaten\nappearance.”  The resident’s entire foot remained swollen \nand painful until his untimely demise.  According to Ft.\nBayard records, the resident continued to do poorly until\nApril 4, 2005, when he suffered what a Ft. Bayard physician\ndescribed as a “classic....massive right-sided aspiration.”\nThe resident died four days later of aspiration pneumonia.\nThis is another case of multiple failings of medical and\nnursing care staff to assess and address a resident’s\ndeclining condition.  If this resident had had adequate and\nprofessionally acceptable care plans in place and\nimplemented for his various needs, this resident most likely\nwould have lived several additional years. \n2.  Dangerous Psychotropic Medication Practices \nFederal regulations require nursing home residents to be\nfree from unnecessary anti-psychotic medication.  42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.25(l)(1).  Federal law defines an unnecessary medication as\nany medication that is excessive in dose; excessive in duration;\nwithout adequate monitoring or indication for use; or without\nspecific target symptoms.  Id.  Federal law also requires that\nresidents receive gradual dose reductions and unless\ncontraindicated, behavioral interventions aimed at reducing\nmedication use.  42 C.F.R. § 483.25(l)(2)(ii). \nFt. Bayard prescribes psychotropic medications at more than\ndouble the rate of nationwide nursing home averages.  At the time \nof our July 2005 visit, 50% of Ft. Bayard’s residents were on\npsychotropic medications, as compared to the national average of\n23%.  In nearly every record we reviewed where psychotropic\nmedication was prescribed, there were often multiple failings,\nincluding:  the absence of a diagnosis justifying the use of the\nmedication; the absence of behavioral indications warranting the\nadministration of the medication; the absence of any evidence\nthat non-medication interventions were tried and/or considered\nand found ineffective; the absence of monitoring of the\nmedication’s efficacy; the absence of side-effect monitoring; the \n3  A “lap buddy” is a restraining device which is attached\nto the armrests of a wheelchair, covering the lap of a resident\nand preventing a resident from getting up from a wheelchair.\nWhen used appropriately, the device can be a useful tool to\nminimize falls and serious injuries. \n\n- 8 -\n\nabsence of appropriate response to medication side-effects; and\nthe absence of informed consent for the use of the medication. \nMedications are also prescribed in excessive dosages.  Each of \nthese failures violate federal law governing psychotropic\nmedication practice in nursing homes and has contributed to\nsignificant harm to Ft. Bayard’s residents.  See 42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.25(l)(1). \nFt. Bayard’s use of psychotropic medication deviates so far\nfrom the requirements of federal law and generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care that it is shocking.  So deviant \nare Ft. Bayard psychotropic medications practices that residents\nhave suffered and died premature deaths that can be attributed,\nat least in part, to the nursing home’s psychiatric medications\npractices.  We reviewed ten current residents’ records because \nthe residents were being prescribed psychotropic medication.  In \nnine of those ten cases, the psychotropic drugs were\ninappropriately prescribed and administered.  In 15 of the 20 \ndeath charts that we reviewed, we found significant violations\nwith respect to the prescription and administration of\npsychotropic medications. \nBecause of the risks that psychotropic medications pose to\nnursing home residents in particular, their use is highly\nregulated and scrutinized under federal law.  See 42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.25(l)(1).  We found many violations of these federal\nregulations.  For example, the interaction of the medications’\nside-effects and the sedation resulting from psychotropic\nmedication are known to cause swallowing difficulties in elders.\nResidents with swallowing disorders are particularly at risk for\naspiration pneumonia4, a life-threatening condition in elders,\nbecause they are unable to protect their airways adequately while\neating or drinking.  Our consultant reviewed six records of \nresidents who had died at Ft. Bayard of aspiration pneumonia.  In \nevery case, the resident had been given psychoactive or sedating\nmedications without an appropriate justification or diagnosis and\nwithout appropriate side-effects monitoring.  Care plan\ninterventions were not carried out or were absent.  Signs of\nmedication side-effects and/or aspiration were present but were\nignored by both nursing and medical staff prior to the\ndevelopment of the final aspiration event leading to death.\nConsider the following examples: \n4  Aspiration pneumonia is a condition where food or fluid\nenters the lungs rather than remaining in the esophagus.  Once in \nthe lungs, this food or fluid can lead to the development of\npneumonia. \n\n- 9 -\n\nC\t In June 2005, a 66-year-old resident died of aspiration\npneumonia.  He had a long history of behavioral disturbances\nwhile at Ft. Bayard and had been treated with several\ndifferent anti-psychotic drugs.  Prior to his death, he was\non a daily regimen of anti-psychotic medication nearly ten\ntimes the maximum recommended dosage under federal\nguidelines.  The resident’s medical record showed no \nsystematic evaluation of the side-effects of the various\nmedications, nor did it contain an adequate justification\nfor the combinations of medications.  Ft. Bayard’s dangerous\nmedication practices contributed to this resident’s death\nfrom aspiration pneumonia. \nC\t Another untimely death occurred in December 2004, when a\n90-year-old resident died less than two months after being\nadmitted to Ft. Bayard.  His death was attributed to \naspiration pneumonia.  During his stay at Ft. Bayard, he was\nprescribed and administered excessive doses of anti-\npsychotic drugs without adequate indications for use of the\nmedications, informed consent, side-effects monitoring, or\nthe use of behavioral programming.  The anti-psychotic drugs\nmay have been causing the aspiration.  The cause and manner \nof this resident’s death was likely preventable. \nC\t In November 2004, a 56-year-old resident died after\ndeveloping aspiration pneumonia.  He was being treated\nwith large amounts of psychotropic medications without\nclinical indications.  Shortly before his death, he had\n“lost his gag and swallow reflex completely,” but nurses\ngave him two cartons of a nutritional supplement to drink.\nHe was subsequently observed to have been unable to swallow\nthe supplement.  Death from aspiration pneumonia occurred\ntwo days later.  This resident’s death was also discussed \nunder the section of this letter addressing Ft. Bayard’s\ndangerous medication practices. \nC\t In June 2005, an 89-year-old resident died of aspiration\npneumonia after a nine month stay at Ft. Bayard.  The \nresident was taking a number of psychotropic medications,\nincluding at least one known to have severe side effects in\nelders.  Indeed, at one point the resident reported to\nnurses that he was having trouble walking and talking\nbecause he “felt drunk.”  The nurse’s response to this red\nflag was to restrain the resident in his wheelchair with a\nlap buddy.  This resident was often restrained for his \nbehaviors and suffered another common side effect for elders \ntaking psychotropic medication – constipation.  Three months \nbefore he died, the resident went for a 22 day period\nwithout a bowel movement.  Constipation can cause increased \n\n- 10 -\n\naggression, and this resident became increasingly combative,\nwhich led to an increase in his psychotropic medications.\nHe died shortly thereafter, of aspiration pneumonia. \nC  In May 2005, a 94-year-old resident suffered an untimely\naspiration pneumonia death after just over a year’s stay at\nFt. Bayard.  As with many other residents, Ft. Bayard had\nplaced her on multiple psychoactive medications without\nadequate assessments for the need of such medications or\nplans to monitor adequately the effects of the medications.\nAccording to Ft. Bayard documents, she was prescribed these\nmedications for “irritable mood.”  She suffered recurrent \nbouts of aspiration pneumonia during the last months of\nher life, and was seen by Ft. Bayard’s speech therapy staff\non multiple occasions.  However, nursing staff failed to\nimplement and monitor the recommendations made by the speech\ntherapy staff.  This resident’s death was also discussed \nunder the section of this letter addressing Ft. Bayard’s\nfailure to develop and implement adequate healthcare plans. \n3.  Undue and Unnecessary Pain and Suffering \nThe diagnosis and treatment of pain is integral to the\npractice of medicine.  Generally accepted professional standards\nmandate that patients with pain, acute or chronic, be treated\nthrough aggressive and appropriate means.  Treatment of pain is\nespecially urgent for patients who experience pain as a result of\na terminal illness, and treatment of pain is an especially\nimportant issue in the medical treatment of the elderly.  It has \nbeen estimated that over 50% of elderly persons in the community,\nand 80% of those in nursing homes, live with persistent or\nrecurring pain that must be treated.  Examples of the causes of\nchronic pain conditions in older people include osteoarthritis5,\nvarious forms of cancer, post-stroke pain, joint pain and\nperipheral neuropathy6 in diabetes.  Federal regulations require\nnursing homes to assess residents for pain as part of the\ncomprehensive care planning process.  42 C.F.R. § 483.20(d). \nIn practically every case we reviewed where pain management\nwas an issue, the facility failed to either assess pain \n5  Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that is\nespecially prone to affecting weight-bearing joints and is very\ncommon in older persons. \n6  Peripheral neuropathy is damage to the nervous system,\nparticularly in the fingers and feet, and is frequently seen in\nolder people with diabetes. \n\n- 11 -\n\nadequately, prescribe appropriate medication, or monitor the\neffectiveness of pain medication.  The nursing home failed to\nmanage pain adequately in long term residents, post-operative\nresidents, and dying residents alike.  Also, agitated residents\nwith dementia were often not adequately assessed for pain, but\nwere medicated with psychotropic drugs instead.  As a result,\nresidents of Ft. Bayard suffer undue and unnecessary pain and\nsuffering.  Consider the following examples: \nC\t A 66-year-old resident with metastatic breast cancer was\nadmitted to Ft. Bayard in June 2004.  She was admitted from \nan acute care hospital following surgery for a fracture to\nher thigh bone caused by cancer that had spread to that\nbone.  It was known at the outset that the resident was \nadmitted to receive care until she died from cancer.  No \nfurther treatment was possible for her cancer, which had\nspread to many of her bones and elsewhere in her body.  In \nan outrageous departure from accepted professional\nstandards, nurses failed to list pain management in her plan\nof care.  Pain management should have been the first item in\nher care plan, and nurses should have focused on relief of\npain at least once every single shift.  During the early\npart of her stay, she was given pills for pain in an amount\nequal to 600 mg of morphine per day - a very high dose.  The \nresident’s condition deteriorated, and she became unable to\nswallow the oral medication.  In mid-July 2004, she was\nchanged from the oral medication to a liquid form of\nmorphine.  In a gross mismanagement of pain, staff at Ft.\nBayard prescribed a dose one-tenth the equivalent of the\npills she had been taking.  The resident died three days\nlater.  Allowing a human being to die under such\ncircumstances is unconscionable. \nC\t A 91-year-old resident was admitted to Ft. Bayard in\nDecember 2004 for rehabilitation therapy to recover from hip\nsurgery.  At the time of her admission, she was screaming in\npain due not only to the surgery but to a large bed sore on\nthe posterior of her pelvis.  Ft. Bayard’s nurse rated her\npain at a 10 on a 0-to-10 scale, yet the resident received\nno pain medication at that time.  For the next two weeks,\nFt. Bayard prescribed only minimal pain medication.  At two \nweeks, the resident was given morphine and was noted to be\n“less tearful.”  In early February 2005, the resident’s pain\nappeared to get worse and she was noted to be \"grimacing,\nmoaning and crying in pain.\"  The facility made no changes\nto her pain regimen.  The resident became combative with \nstaff, possibly as a result of delirium brought on by\nuntreated pain.  Rather than adequately assessing and\nalleviating the resident’s pain, Ft. Bayard responded by \n\n- 12 -\n\nchemically restraining her with psychotropic medications.\nThe combination of pain and psychotropic medications\ncontributed to her decreased appetite and food intake.  At \none point, the resident lost almost 20 pounds in one month’s\ntime.  Again, Ft. Bayard failed to develop a healthcare plan\nto address this serious weight loss.  The resident lived \nonly a few months after admission to Ft. Bayard and died on\nMarch 1, 2005.  The combination of Ft. Bayard’s failures to\ndevelop adequate healthcare plans to address the resident’s\npain, behaviors, or nutritional needs resulted in the\nresident suffering unnecessarily and contributed to her\nuntimely death. \nC\t Another example of Ft. Bayard’s allowing a resident to\nsuffer needless pain is the case of a 94-year-old woman who\nwas admitted to Ft. Bayard in January 2004.  Among other\nconditions, she had a spinal condition and osteoporosis,\nwhich caused her chronic back pain.  During the last week of\nher life in May, 2004, after having experienced increasing\npain, she was observed as being \"confused,\" \"agitated,\"\n\"paranoid,\" and \"restless.\"  During this time, she made the\nstatement, \"I’d rather be dead than let them get me\" before\nfalling to the ground while attempting to get in her\nwheelchair.  Among other failings, such as Ft. Bayard’s\nfailure to assess and treat her delirium, the resident’s\npain was not assessed or adequately treated. \nC\t Another resident of Ft. Bayard, at various times over a\nperiod of about 18 months, suffered a fractured collar bone;\ncomplained of pain in one of his front teeth; had his penis\ninflamed so badly that he could not retract the foreskin;\nsuffered swollen and contused joints in his hand; had\nabrasions on his left index and middle fingers; fell off the\ntoilet; fell two other times in the bathroom; suffered a\nblack eye from a fall; and fell on his left hip.  Pain was \nnot appropriately assessed, evaluated, managed, or\ndocumented in any of these incidents. \nC\t On the day before he died, one resident was murmuring “I\nhurt.  I hurt.”  Yet, Ft. Bayard failed to respond\nadequately to his pain, causing unnecessary suffering. \nC\t A resident died at Ft. Bayard after a year’s stay.  At the \nend of her life, she was not provided adequate pain or\ncomfort measures and was allowed to suffer needlessly\nprior to her death. \n\n- 13 -\n\nFurthermore, the nursing home systemically fails to ensure\nthat pain medications (which are controlled substances) are\nadequately administered or safeguarded.  Specifically, unlicensed\nmedication aides are allowed to administer pain medication to\nresidents without direct supervision by nurses.  Indeed, we\nreviewed two instances where staff charted that pain medication\nhad been “refused” by a resident, but the refused medication\ncould not be accounted for.  In another case, a bottle of liquid\nmorphine had been “dropped,” although the broken bottle was never\nproduced.  Opiate medications are stored en masse in the\nnarcotics drawers of the medication carts without individuals’ \nnames or prescriptions. \nAdded to these two unsafe practices is the fact that Ft.\nBayard staff are not adequately monitoring residents to determine\nexactly how much pain medication residents are, in fact,\nreceiving.  We found many residents complaining of being in pain\neven though the facility was prescribing large amounts of\nnarcotic pain killers to these residents.  Ft. Bayard was over-\nrelying on residents to report whether or not they had received\ntheir medications.  Residents with cognitive impairments, such as\nresidents with dementia, are often not be able to remember or\nstate whether they have received pain medication.  Thus, this\npractice further allows for the possibility of opiate medications\nnot being given to residents as prescribed. \nFinally, we asked the managers at Ft. Bayard how many of the\nstaff at Ft. Bayard likely take illegal drugs and were told it\nwas a significant percentage.  We were also told that staff at \nFt. Bayard are not tested for drugs unless they are in special\npositions that place others at risk. \nThis combination of deficient practices and evidence has led\nus to the disquieting possibility that certain Ft. Bayard staff\nare purloining opiate medications away from residents.  Thus, as\nunconscionable as it may seem, Ft. Bayard staff may very well be\nallowing residents to suffer needless pain while they themselves\ntake (or sell) medication intended for residents.  Obviously, if\nthis is occurring, it is a gross departure from accepted\nprofessionals standards of practice and is likely a violation of\nfederal and state criminal law. \nB.  INADEQUATE PROTECTION FROM HARM \nResidents of Ft. Bayard have the constitutional right to\nlive in reasonably safe conditions and to be provided the\nessentials of basic care.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315.\nFederal statutes governing the operation of nursing homes create \n\n- 14 -\n\nsimilar rights.  See, e.g., Grants to States for Medical\nAssistance Programs (Medicaid), 42 U.S.C. § 1396r; Health\nInsurance for Aged and Disabled (Medicare), 42 U.S.C. § 1351i-3;\nand their implementing regulations, 42 U.S.C. § 483 Subpart B.\nHowever, Ft. Bayard is failing to ensure that residents are kept\nfree from harm or unnecessary risk of harm.  Specifically, the\nfacility is failing to ensure that residents are free from harm\nat the hands of other residents; that residents are protected\nadequately from the risk of falling; and that care is provided in\nan environment that comports with federal regulations. \n1.  Resident-on-Resident Violence \nDuring our tours of Ft. Bayard, State officials told us that\nFt. Bayard acts as a “safety net” for the State of New Mexico.\nAs a result, Ft. Bayard accepts residents that private nursing\nhomes refuse.  Consequently, Ft. Bayard admits a significant\nnumber of residents, both elderly and not, with serious mental\nhealth and behavioral issues.  These residents are often \naggressive, combative, and prone to physical aggression against\nother residents, who are often very vulnerable, as well as staff\nmembers. \nWe uncovered significant evidence, in chart after chart,\nwhere residents would repeatedly become combative with other\nresidents or staff without adequate interventions from staff to\nameliorate the harm or risk of harm.  For example, the following\nis taken from one resident’s chart in early 2005: \nJanuary 29  Resident struck nursing assistant in the\nface; \nFebruary 11  Resident punched another resident; \nFebruary 20  Resident threatened to hit staff member; \nMarch 3  After being punched in the mouth by another\nresident, resident scratched the aggressor on\nthe chest; \nMarch 4  Resident punched another resident in the\nmouth; \nMarch 12  Resident was struck by another resident in\nthe mouth; \nApril 3  Resident struck another resident twice in the \nface; \n\n- 15 -\n\nApril 6  Resident struck another resident in the face,\ncutting the resident’s lip; and \nApril 18  Resident was hit by another resident in the\nface. \nAnother resident’s chart told a similar story: \nJanuary 6 \t Resident grabbed another resident on the arm\nand the other resident possibly hit the\nresident on the arm and hands; \nJanuary 8  Resident attempted to hit staff and other\nresidents; \nJanuary 13  Staff noticed bump above resident’s right\neye; \nJanuary 18  Resident aggressive and trying to spit and\ngrab staff; \nJanuary 20  Resident aggressive with another resident;\nscratched resident on head, neck, and back; \nJanuary 29  Resident had altercation with another \nresident resulting in a bruise to right hand; \nFebruary 8  Resident aggressive with staff; \nFebruary 10  Resident aggressive; grabbed a nurse’s arm;\nhit another resident three times; \nFebruary 15  Resident combative with staff; \nFebruary 27  Resident aggressive; \nMarch 3  Resident grabbed another resident by the\nforearm resulting in evident nail imprints; \nMarch 30  Resident hit another resident twice in the \nface; \nApril 1  Resident struck another resident; \nMay through June (multiple dates)  Resident combative with \nstaff; \n\n- 16 -\n\nJuly 6\t Resident kicked by another resident resulting\nin skin tear; and, \nJuly 12\t Resident attempted to grab other residents. \nThe frequency of repeated acts of aggression without\nappropriate staff intervention demonstrates the nursing home’s\ninability to adequately treat and manage residents with\nbehavioral disorders and to keep those residents’ peers safe from\nharm. \nWe also reviewed situations where residents suffered \ninjuries without an adequate investigation into the injury’s\ncause.  For example, in one two-month period, a resident was\nfound in one instance with blood on his wheelchair, lap tray, and\nsleeve and in a later instance was found with a skin tear above \nhis eyebrow and bruising to his cheek.  Yet, there is no evidence\nthat either event was investigated for potential abuse of the\nresident.  Our consultant found that Ft. Bayard also failed to\nhave adequate quality assurance mechanisms in place to analyze\nassaults and implement measures to prevent further assaults. \n2.  Lack of Adequate Fall Prevention Program \nFt. Bayard staff fails to protect residents adequately from\nthe risk of falling.  Falls, and the injuries that can result\nfrom falls (particularly fractures), pose a serious risk to\nelderly persons.  Generally accepted standards of practice\nrequire nursing homes to assess residents for risk of falls, make\nappropriate diagnoses related to fall risk, develop appropriate\ncare plans to mitigate risk of falls, and supervise residents\nadequately to protect then from falling.  42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.25(h)(1-2); 483.20(a-k). \nAccording to the nursing home’s data, there were 108\nresident falls in the first six months of 2005.  Our nursing\nexpert found that the vast majority of these falls were\npreventable.  For example, inappropriate footwear (such as socks,\nwhich provide no traction on the slippery nursing home floors);\nthe failure of staff to use a gait belt7 when helping residents,\nwho are known to be at high risk of falling, ambulate; and the\ninadequate or improper use of electronic alarms contributed to a\nhigh risk of falls for several residents.  The nursing home’s \n7  A gait belt is a device worn around a resident’s waist\nthat staff can hold to assist staff in ambulating the resident\nand prevent the resident from falling. \n\n- 17 -\n\npolicy on falls is focused on reporting and follow-up of falls,\nbut provides no guidance on how to prevent residents from falling\nin the first place.  Further, the fall prevention program that\nFt. Bayard offers to residents is limited to ten participants. \nCare plans for residents who were known to be at risk of\nfalls (because they had already fallen) failed to contain\nspecific measures for fall prevention and did not address issues\nsuch as toileting, ambulation and mobility, dementia care, and\nmonitoring.  Addressing each of these issues in a care plan can\nhelp prevent falls. \nFor example, we reviewed the record of a resident who had\nfallen 15 times during the first half of 2005.  When the resident \nwas seated in his wheelchair, staff were instructed to hook an\nalarm to his clothing.  The alarm was supposed to alert staff\nwhen the resident got out of his chair to ambulate on his own.\nHowever, staff continued to hook the alarm to the resident’s\nclothing in a position enabling the resident to remove the alarm\nbefore he attempted to get out of his chair.  Thus, staff were\nnot alerted that the resident was ambulating on his own so that\nthey could help protect him from falling as he attempted to meet\nhis needs to go the bathroom, get some water, or get a TV remote.\nThe resident fell seven times in early 2005 trying to get out of\nhis wheelchair unattended.  Once his wheelchair tipped over,\ncatching and injuring his finger; once he fell on and scraped his\nshoulder; once he tore the skin on his left elbow and scraped his\nright knee; and once he bruised his left hip.  Nursing staff\nfailed to implement simple corrective measures (like using an\nalarm that the resident could not see or placing a water pitcher\nand a TV remote within easy reach) to break the cycle of falls\ncaused by an ineffective care plan. \nThe fall prevention plan for another resident who had\nfractured his collar bone due to a fall at Ft. Bayard in 2003 and\nwho had fallen 10 times in the first six months of 2005 stated \nonly \"one-on-one observation to prevent repeat falls.\"  Staff \ncould \"observe\" this resident constantly, but simply looking at\nthis man cannot prevent him from falling.  Staff need a plan to\nanticipate the resident’s needs and specific interventions that\nstaff can take to help prevent the resident from falling.\nWithout that, the resident will continue to be at risk of further\nfalls.  And, indeed, this resident suffered again and again from\nfalls.  For instance, in May, June, and July 2005, this resident\nfell seven separate times in the restroom, mostly trying to\ntransfer himself from his wheelchair to the toilet or from the \ntoilet to his wheelchair.  Our consultant found these repeated \n\n- 18 -\n\npreventable falls to be evidence of neglect, bordering on abuse,\nand a total disregard for human dignity. \n3.  The Ft. Bayard Environment \nFt. Bayard is a very old facility that is not appropriate\nfor the provision of nursing home care.  Residents’ rooms are \ndingy and ill-lit, presenting challenges to residents’ vision and\nefforts to prevent falls.  Most rooms are multiple-resident rooms\nwhere curtains provide some privacy, but auditory privacy is non-\nexistent.  Resident beds are antiquated and mattresses are hard,\nraising the risk of skin breakdown.  Clothes cabinets have no \ndoors and are thus not secure from wandering residents.  There \nare only two communal bathrooms, one for men and one for women,\nper ward.  However, access to both the male and female bathrooms\nis through a larger room that is also used for resident bathing,\ncreating further privacy issues for residents being bathed. \nCombined, these environmental conditions violate federal\nregulations that require nursing homes to provide a \"safe, clean,\ncomfortable and homelike environment.\"  42 C.F.R. 483.15(h)(1).\nState officials are well aware of these issues.  Secretaries \nGrisham and Armstrong informed us that it is the State’s\nintention to replace the current structure with a newer facility\nin the near future. \nC.  INADEQUATE NUTRITIONAL AND HYDRATION SERVICES \nNursing homes such as Ft. Bayard are required by federal law\nto provide residents with adequate nutrition, including\nsufficient fluids, to maintain their health and well-being.  See \n42 C.F.R. § 483.25(i-j).  Ft. Bayard’s failure to ensure that\nresidents receive adequate nutritional services and that\nresidents are fed in a safe manner has contributed to the death \nof residents. \nDuring our visit to Ft. Bayard, we watched several mealtimes\non various units, observing the manner in which food was served.\nWe observed numerous instances where residents were improperly\npositioned and where staff were using inappropriate techniques to\nfeed residents who needed assistance to eat.  In addition,\nresidents at risk of choking were left unattended.  Further,\nnecessary precautions were not taken for residents at risk of\naspiration pneumonia.  As noted above, numerous Ft. Bayard\nresidents have died of aspiration pneumonia. \nIn addition to our observations, the medical charts of Ft.\nBayard residents revealed case after case where residents with \n\n- 19 -\n\nknown swallowing difficulties were fed in dangerous ways, often\nin contravention of specific care plans that had been written to\nprotect the residents.  We found that even in cases where \nresidents had developed aspiration pneumonia, nursing staff\nfailed to implement detailed instructions for feeding the\nresidents.  A primary cause for this failing is that Ft. Bayard\nstaff have not been sufficiently and adequately educated to know\nhow to assist residents with eating and drinking difficulties. \nWe also observed situations where Ft. Bayard failed to\ndevelop care plans to ensure that residents receive adequate\nfluids.  This violates federal regulations.  42 U.S.C. 483.25(j).\nThe facility failed to ensure that residents had access to\nadequate fluids during the course of the day and evening. \nFt. Bayard’s nutritional and hydration services\nsubstantially depart from generally accepted professional\nstandards of care, and these departures are not only harming Ft.\nBayard residents, they are also contributing, in some cases, to\ntheir deaths. \nD.  INADEQUATE ACTIVITIES \nFederal regulations and generally accepted professional\nstandards recognize the critical importance that activities and\nmental stimulation play in maintaining good psychological health\namong nursing home residents.  See, e.g., 42 C.F.R.\n§ 483.15(f)(a).  A nursing home like Ft. Bayard “must provide for\nan ongoing program of activities designed to meet . . . the\ninterests and the physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being\nof each resident.” \nThe nursing home offers grossly substandard activity\nprograms for its residents.  Our consultant rated the quality of\nFt. Bayard’s activity program as between 0 and 1 on a scale of 0\nto 10.  Ft. Bayard’s activity calendars are sparse and often\ncontain “activities” that are actually duties for the staff, such\nas “transporting residents to the dining room.”  When there are \nscheduled activities, such as a movie off-ward, the majority of\nresidents remain on the ward, where no activities are scheduled.\nMany other activities are not activities at all, such as “music”\nactivities which amounted to staff playing music on the radio\nwhile transporting residents.  We observed these patterns\nthroughout the nursing home. \n\n- 20 -\n\nBecause of the lack of activities, a cascade of undesirable \nconsequences ensues.  Residents experience greater levels of\nagitation, combativeness, hopelessness, withdrawal, and\nresistence to care.  Frustrated residents become aggressive\ntoward one another and to staff, so that, as discussed above,\nresident-to-resident and resident-to-staff assaults occur.  There \nis an absence of effective behavior management programs at the\nfacility.  Staff, therefore, do not have the skills or guidance\nto prevent or properly manage this aggressiveness.  As noted \nearlier, Ft. Bayard’s primary, and often only, response to\nresidents’ behavior issues is to chemically restrain the\nresidents with psychotropic medications, in violation of both\nfederal regulations and generally accepted professional standards\nof practice, and placing the residents at great risk of harm. \nE.\t FAILURE TO SERVE RESIDENTS IN THE MOST INTEGRATED \nSETTING APPROPRIATE TO RESIDENTS’ NEEDS \nThe State is failing to serve Ft. Bayard residents in the\nmost integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  Failure to \nserve residents in the most integrated setting appropriate to\ntheir needs is a violation of Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (“ADA”).  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d)(public\nentities must provide services in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals).  The preamble\nto the ADA regulations defines “the most integrated setting” to\nmean a setting “that enables individuals with disabilities to\ninteract with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent\npossible.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A at 450. \nIn construing the anti-discrimination provision contained\nwithin the public services portion (Title II) of the ADA, the\nSupreme Court held that “[u]njustified [institutional] isolation\n... is properly regarded as discrimination based on disability.”\nOlmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597, 600 (1999).  Specifically,\nthe Court established that States are required to provide\ncommunity-based treatment for persons with disabilities when the\nState’s treatment professionals have determined that community\nplacement is appropriate, provided that the transfer is not\nopposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be\nreasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources\navailable to the State and the needs of others with disabilities. \nId. at 602, 607. \nFurther, with the New Freedom Initiative, President George\nW. Bush announced that it was a high priority for his\nAdministration to tear down barriers to equality and to expand\nopportunities available to Americans living with disabilities. \n\n- 21 -\n\nAs one step in implementing the New Freedom Initiative, on June\n18, 2001, the President signed Executive Order No. 13217,\nentitled “Community-Based Alternatives for Individuals with\nDisabilities.”  Specifically, the President emphasized that\nunjustified isolation or segregation of qualified individuals\nwith disabilities in institutions is a form of prohibited\ndiscrimination, that the United States is committed to community-\nbased alternatives for individuals with disabilities, and that\nthe United States seeks to ensure that America’s community-based\nprograms effectively foster independence and participation in the\ncommunity for Americans with disabilities.  Exec. Order No. \n13217, §§ 1(a)-(c), 66 Fed. Reg. 33155 (June 18, 2001).  The \nPresident directed the Attorney General to “fully enforce” Title\nII of the ADA, especially for the victims of unjustified\ninstitutionalization.  Id. at § 2(c).  As set forth below, the\nState is failing to comply with the ADA with regard to placing\npersons now living at Ft. Bayard in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to their individualized needs. \nBased on our tours of the facility, review of residents’\nrecords, and discussions with Ft. Bayard and State\nrepresentatives, it is clear that most of the residents of Ft.\nBayard are appropriately placed in the nursing facility and\nreintegration is not appropriate at this time.  However, it is\nalso clear that several Ft. Bayard residents could be, and wish\nto be, served in community-based placements – and their treating\nprofessionals concur.  At this time, however, New Mexico does not\nhave the capacity to serve these residents in the community.  The \nOlmstead court specifically recognized the need for a state “to\nmaintain a range” of placements to care for persons with\ndisabilities.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597. \nFurther, the State has not sufficiently examined, or\nresponded to, the reasons why Ft. Bayard residents with mental\nhealth or behavioral issues have not been reintegrated into the\ncommunity.  This problem is not addressed adequately in the\nState’s Olmstead planning.  By failing to develop plan to address\nthese issues, the State is failing to serve certain Ft. Bayard\nresidents in the most integrated setting appropriate to their\nneeds.  Olmstead requires the development of plans to address the\nADA’s integration mandate.  See, e.g., Pennsylvania Protection &\nAdvocacy v. Department of Public Welfare, 402 F.3rd 374, 382 (3d\nCir. 2005). \nAs evidence of the ADA violations at Ft. Bayard, consider\nthe following cases: \n\n- 22 -\n\nC\t A 51-year-old resident of Ft. Bayard was admitted to the\nnursing home in July 2001.  She is diagnosed with\nschizophrenia, an orofacial disorder, and a urinary tract\ninfection.  She is independent in all activities of daily\nliving.  She wants to live in the community and her treating\nprofessionals agree that she could live in the community.\nStaff at Ft. Bayard are trying to find an assisted living\nfacility for this resident. \nC\t A 57-year-old resident of Ft. Bayard was admitted to the\nnursing home in March 2004.  She has anemia and hypertensive\nheart disease.  She requires little assistance in performing\nher activities of daily living.  She wants to return to the \ncommunity and her treating professionals agree that she\ncould live in the community.  Ft. Bayard staff are trying to \nfind a place for her to live in the community, but lack of\nappropriate housing is a major barrier. \nC\t A 43-year-old resident of Ft. Bayard was admitted to the\nnursing home in May 2004.  He has dementia, cerebral\ndegeneration, and renal insufficiency.  He wants to return \nto the community and his treating professionals agree that\nhe could live in the community.  Staff at Ft. Bayard are\ntrying to find appropriate housing for this resident. \nOur review of the nursing home’s efforts to place Ft. Bayard\nresidents into more integrated settings raises several concerns.\nThe single most problematic barrier to community placement is a\nlack of residential housing adequate to meet the needs of Ft.\nBayard residents who wish to, and are appropriate for, return to\nthe community, particularly those with mental health or\nbehavioral issues.  In particular, there is a lack of living\nsituations in the community where administration of medications\ncan be supervised and monitored.  If a resident cannot be \ndischarged back to his or her home, it his highly unlikely that\nan alternative residence will be found.  For example, between\nJuly 2004 and July 2005, 106 residents were discharged from Ft.\nBayard.  Of these, 103 were discharged back to their own homes;\nonly three were discharged to places other than their own homes. \nAnother barrier to community placement is the lack of\nsupportive psychiatric services that many Ft. Bayard residents\nwould need in the community.  So, even if alternative living\narrangements could be found, the necessary supportive services,\nsuch as counseling, may not be available. \n\n- 23 -\n\nOn a related note, the Pre-Admission Screening and Resident\nReview (PASRR) is a process required by the federal government to\ndetermine if a resident of a nursing home who has mental illness\nor mental retardation actually needs the level of services\nprovided in a nursing facility.  The purpose of PASRR is to\nensure that persons who need mental illness or mental retardation\nservices get them in the most appropriate setting and are not\nplaced in a nursing home inappropriately.  We are concerned that \nthe intent of the federally required PASRR reviews is not being\nmet at Ft. Bayard.  Many PASRR reviews are being completed\nwithout the thoroughness required to ensure that residents who\nneed mental health or retardation services are served in the most \nappropriate setting. \nWe understand and applaud the fact that the State is taking\nmeasures such as developing an Aging and Disability Resource\nCenter and is working to establish a Behavioral Health\nCollaborative that should help to identify and deliver services\nto New Mexico’s disabled and elderly.  The State is also working\nto create a managed long-term care delivery system that may work\nto increase the utilization of community-based services. \nIII.  MINIMAL REMEDIAL MEASURES \nTo remedy the identified deficiencies and protect the\nconstitutional and statutory rights of Ft. Bayard residents, the\nState should implement promptly, at a minimum, the following\nmeasures set forth below: \n1. \t Provide each resident with adequate medical and nursing\ncare, including appropriate and on-going assessments,\nindividualized care plans, and health care\ninterventions to protect the resident’s health and\nsafety.  To accomplish this, Ft. Bayard should: \na.  Ensure that each resident’s health status is \nadequately monitored and reviewed, and that\nchanges in a resident’s health status are\naddressed in a timely manner; \nb.  Ensure that all Ft. Bayard medical and nursing\nstaff members are adequately trained in generally\naccepted professional standards for their\nrespective areas of responsibility, that policies\nare updated and reflect generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care, and that the staff\nare trained on those policies; \n\n- 24 -\n\nc. \t  Ensure that medical and nursing staff address with\nparticular attention residents’ conditions such as\ndiabetes, seizure disorders, and pain management; \nd.\t Design and implement appropriate interventions to\nassess and develop care plans for residents at\nrisk of falling and re-evaluate those\ninterventions as necessary; \ne. \t Ensure that residents receive restorative care \nservices in order to allow residents to attain and \nmaintain their highest practicable level of\nfunctioning; and \nf.\t Employ and deploy a sufficient number of\nconsistent nursing staff to provide adequate\nsupervision, routine care, preventative care, and\ntreatment to each Ft. Bayard resident; \n2. \t Psychopharmacological practices must comport with\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  All use of \npsychoactive drugs should be professionally justified,\ncarefully monitored, documented, and reviewed by\nqualified staff.  Medications should be prescribed\nbased on clinical need.  Medications should not be used \nin manners that expose residents to undue risks to\ntheir health and safety. \n3.\t Implement policies and procedures to ensure that\nresidents actually receive the pain medications that\nare prescribed for them. \n4.\t Institute policies, procedures, and practices to\ninvestigate adequately, and follow-up on, instances of\npotential resident abuse, neglect, and/or mistreatment,\nincluding injuries resulting from resident-on-resident\nabuse and from unknown causes.  As an element of these \npractices, the Ft. Bayard Medical Director should\nreview all incident reports and initiate appropriate\nadministrative or clinical action. \n5.\t Provide adequate and appropriate psychiatric, mental\nhealth, behavioral, and psychosocial services in\naccordance with generally accepted professional\nstandards. \n\n- 25 -\n6.\t Provide adequate nutritional management services,\nincluding: \na. \t Conducting adequate nutritional assessments of\nindividual residents’ specific nutritional needs; \nb. \t Ensuring that residents receive appropriate diets,\nas medically necessary; \nc. \t Monitoring residents’ nutritional status, weight,\nand food intake, as medically necessary; \nd. \t Ensuring that residents who need assistance in\neating are assisted by adequately trained staff; \ne. \t Ensuring that residents are not exposed to undue\nrisk of aspiration pneumonia; and, \nf. \t Providing residents with adequate amounts of\nfluids to ensure proper hydration. \n7.\t Provide sufficient, meaningful activities for all\nresidents and make efforts to get residents involved in\nactivities. \n8.\t Provide an environment for residents that adequately\nprovides and protects the residents’ health, comfort,\nand dignity. \n9.\t Implement adequate quality assurance mechanisms that\nare capable of identifying and remedying resident\nquality of care deficiencies. \n10.\t The State of New Mexico must ensure that Ft. Bayard\nresidents who do not oppose placement in the community\nare being served in the most integrated settings\nappropriate for their needs. \n11.\t The State of New Mexico must redress the barriers that \nare preventing Olmstead-eligible Ft. Bayard residents\nwith mental illness from reintegrating into the\ncommunity. \n* * * \nWe hope to continue working with the State in an amicable\nand cooperative fashion to resolve our outstanding concerns with\nregard to Ft. Bayard.  Provided that our cooperative relationship \n\n- 26 -\n\ncontinues, we will forward our expert consultants’ reports under\nseparate cover.  Although their reports are their work – and do\nnot necessarily represent the official conclusions of the\nDepartment of Justice – their observations, analyses, and\nrecommendations provide further elaboration of the relevant\nconcerns and offer practical, technical assistance in addressing\nthem.  We hope that you will give this information careful\nconsideration and that it will assist in your efforts at prompt\nremediation. \nWe are obligated to advise you that, in the unexpected event\nthat we are unable to reach a resolution regarding our concerns,\nwithin 49 days after your receipt of this letter, the Attorney\nGeneral is authorized to initiate a lawsuit pursuant to CRIPA, to\ncorrect deficiencies of the kind identified in this letter.  See \n42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(1).  We would very much prefer, however, to\nresolve this matter by working cooperatively with you. \nAccordingly, we will soon contact State officials to discuss\nthis matter in further detail.  If you have any questions\nregarding this letter, please call Shanetta Y. Cutlar, Chief of\nthe Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section, at (202)\n514-0195. \nSincerely, \nWan J.
