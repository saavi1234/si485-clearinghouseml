Collins granting 272 Ex Parte Application to Continue: On August 13, 2012, Plaintiff United States filed an ex parte application to continue the hearing on its pending Motion to Enforce the Consent Judgment in this case, which is currently set for Monday, August 20, 2012 at 10:00 a.m. (Docket No. 272.) Defendants State of California, et al., opposed on August 14, 2012. The Court GRANTS the request and CONTINUES the hearing on the motion to Monday, September 24, 2012 at 10:00 a.m. The Court ORDERS the parties to file simultaneous briefs no later than Monday, September 17, 2012, updating the Court on the monitor's final assessment of the state's compliance with the restraint provision of the consent judgment at Napa State Hospital following the coroner's report on the recent restraint death there. It appears that the monitor has found the state in compliance with the rest of the provisions of the consent judgment raised in the pending motion and the United States is no longer pressing those issues (Ex Parte App. 9), so the parties must explain to the Court what matters remain outstanding and what relief is now necessary in this case, if any.

Collins, re Order on Motion to Enforce, 296 ; The Court TERMINATES all the provisions of the Amended Consent Judgment as they apply to Metropolitan State Hospital. The Court TERMINATES the provisions of the Amended Consent Judgment as they apply to Napa State Hospital, except § I.H and any other provision necessary to remedy Defendants non-compliance with that section. To that end, §§ II (Enforcement), III (Modification of Terms), and IV (Compliance and Termination) are retained to the extent they do not directly conflict with the specific provisions of this Order below. The Court ORDERS Defendants to modify their policies at Napa State Hospital to prohibit all use of prone restraints, prone containments, and prone stabilizations as called for in the Amended Consent Judgment § I.H.1. The Court EXTENDS § I.H of the Amended Consent Judgment as it applies to Napa State Hospital for no more than 12 months from the date of this Order.This extension modifies the five-year termination provision stated in § IV.A. During those 12 months, the Monitor shall conduct two evaluations of Defendants' compliance with § I.H at Napa State Hospital. The Amended Consent Judgment's term \"maintained sustained compliance\" is amended to mean that Defendants maintain substantial compliance with § I.H for at least two Monitor evaluations. See Amended Consent Judgment § IV.A. Within one month of the Court's entry of this Order, the Monitor shall conduct the first evaluation and may conduct the second evaluation within six months after the first evaluation or as shortly thereafter as the Monitor deems appropriate. After any such evaluation, the Monitor shall issue a report of his findings.....The Parties are ORDERED to file a joint report updating the Court on the status of the Monitor's oversight no later than 10 days after the Monitor issues any such evaluation report of Napa State Hospital.

    "summary": "<p>On May 2, 2006, the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against California and state officials responsible for operation of two California mental hospitals: the Metropolitan State Hospital and the Napa State Hospital. The United States sued under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C § 12101. The United States sought declaratory and injunctive relief to end the substantial departures from generally accepted professional standards of care at each hospital that the Department of Justice had identified in multiple CRIPA investigations during the proceeding years. </p><p>The first investigation involved the Metropolitan State Hospital (\"MSH\"). On May 13, 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division (\"DOJ\") sent a findings letter to California's governor, advising him that it had identified \"significant and wide-ranging\" deficiencies in child and adolescent patient care at MSH, a state facility housing children, adolescents, and adults who suffered from mental illness. The letter resulted from a CRIPA investigation of MSH that occurred during June and July 2002. The letter listed minimally-acceptable remedial measures for each of these categories. It also invited continued collaboration toward resolving the many deficiencies and alerted the state that, absent improvement, a CRIPA lawsuit would be filed to compel correction of the deficiencies and protection of MSH patients' rights.</p><p>During the investigation, DOJ and expert consultants visited the facility, reviewed a wide array of documents, and conducted interviews with personnel and residents. The letter commended MSH staff for providing a high level of cooperation during the investigation, as well as the dedication many showed for patient well-being. Nevertheless, the DOJ concluded that deficiencies at MSH existed in a dozen topic areas, including (1) psychiatry; (2) nursing services; (3) psychology; (4) pharmaceutical services; (4) general medical care, including deficiencies in vision services, x-ray reviews, and incontinence and headache evaluation; (5) infection control; (7) dental care; (8) dietary services; (9) placement in the most integrated setting; (10) special education; (11) protection from harm; and (12) First Amendment and due process rights to confidentially communicate with investigators.</p><p>On February 19, 2004, the DOJ sent another findings letter to the governor that focused on adult patient care at MSH. The letter described the investigation process as essentially the same as used in reviewing the younger patients' situations; however, the larger number of adult patients (and of programs housing them) made for lengthier investigative and evaluative processes. The findings, however, were equally gloomy. Overall, the DOJ identified significant and wide-ranging deficiencies in MSH's provision of care to adult patients. The letter set out categories of deficiency as follows: (1) substandard integrated treatment planning; (2) inadequate psychiatric, psychological, rehabilitative, and social history assessments; (3) poor to almost-nonexistent discharge planning for placement in the most integrated setting; (4) substantial departures from generally accepted professional standards of care in each of MSH's psychiatric, psychological, nursing and unit-based, pharmaceutical, general medical, infection control, dental, physical and occupational therapy, and dietary treatment services; (5) insufficient documentation of patient care and progress; (6) excessive and unnecessarily restrictive use of seclusion, restraints, and \"as-needed\" medications; (7) failure to protect patients from harm, stemming from ineffective incident management and quality assurance systems and from multiple environmental hazards; and (8) denial of patients' First Amendment and due process rights to confidentially communicate with investigators.</p><p>This second findings letter listed almost twenty pages of minimally-acceptable remedial measures addressing each of these categories. It invited continued collaboration toward resolving the many deficiencies and again alerted the state that, absent improvement, a CRIPA lawsuit would be filed to compel correction of the deficiencies and protection of MSH patients' rights.</p><p>A third DOJ findings letter dated June 27, 2005, addressed deficiencies found at the Napa State Hospital (\"NSH\"), another California mental health facility. The letter began by noting that the state had stopped cooperating with DOJ investigators, denying them and their consultants access to NSH and other state mental health facilities the DOJ was then investigating (Patton and Atascadero state hospitals). The DOJ advised that it drew an adverse conclusion about the facility from the state's non-cooperation. It also considered information from regulatory and standards agencies that had surveyed NSH and information from interviews of NSH staff, advocates, family members of patients, and patients. Not only did DOJ find \"significant and wide-ranging\" deficiencies in NSH patient care, it concluded these deficiencies were \"widespread and systemic.\" NSH deficiencies had been the subject of a prior CRIPA investigation, which led to a 1990 consent decree that was dismissed in 1995. Nevertheless, the DOJ found that significant problems at NSH had recurred. These problems included: (1) failure to protect patients from harm from assaults and suicide (and from staff sales of illegal drugs to patients); (2) inappropriate use of seclusion, restraint and PRN (\"pro re nata\" or \"as-needed\") psychotropic medications; and (3) inadequate medical, nursing and psychiatric care. In addition to the recurring problems, the DOJ received information showing (4) deficient mental health treatment planning, programming, and nutritional management; (5) unsanitary conditions; and (6) failure to place patients in the most integrated setting, as required by law. For each of these categories, the findings letter included several specific examples of malfeasance or misfeasance, often describing instances of neglectful or cruel conduct by state personnel. The DOJ noted that it could obtain remedial measures by filing a CRIPA lawsuit against the state, although the letter invited the state to avoid litigation and work cooperatively with DOJ to resolve the identified deficiencies.</p><p>The DOJ letters eventually resulted in cooperative resolution of these hospitals' many problems, at least on paper. California's officials and the DOJ reached an agreement that became the basis of a consent judgment filed contemporaneously with this lawsuit. The consent judgment contained an explicit \"Enhancement Plan\" nearly eighty pages long. The plan set out details of standards for comprehensive improvements in care and conditions at MSH and NSH. The consent judgment named an expert independent monitor, Mohamed El-Sabaawi, M.D., to oversee the process of implementing these standards. Dr. El-Sabaawi would have full access to the facilities, patients, and staff, and his periodic reports would go to the court, the parties, and hospital administrators.All terms of the plan were to be implemented within three years, except for the immediate implementation of suicide prevention components of the plan. By its terms, the consent judgment would terminate after five years, with earlier termination possible if the state complied earlier. While the consent judgment remained in effect, the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the order. District Judge George P. Schiavelli promptly accepted the settlement and entered the consent judgment.</p><p>Also on May 2, the DOJ sent California findings letters based on its CRIPA investigations of conditions and practices at two more state mental health facilities: Patton State Hospital and Atascadero State Hospital. DOJ officials and expert consultants had visited the facilities, reviewed a wide array of documents and conducted interviews with personnel and residents. The investigations found significant deficiencies in patient care at both Patton and Atascadero Hospitals, specifically with respect to psychiatric and pharmaceutical services, medical care, protection from harm, use of restraints, seclusion, and medications. The findings were broadly similar to those of the MSH and NSH investigations. </p><p>On February 27, 2007, the parties filed an amended consent judgment. Its terms and duration remained the same, but it added as defendants the officials operating Patton State Hospital and Atascadero State Hospital. Thus, all four hospitals were subject to the consent judgment's enhancement plan. Judge Schiavelli again entered judgment in accordance with the parties' agreement.</p><p>On December 12, 2007, a detainee in Coalinga State Hospital filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the defendants to comply with the amended consent judgment. The plaintiff argued that the judgment applied to the Coalinga State Hospital, where he was being detained. On August 19, 2008, the court denied the petition, finding that the judgment did not apply to residents of the Coalinga State Hospital. </p><p>A pro se group of residents at Atascadero moved to intervene in the suit on June 21, 2011. The United States and the defendants both opposed the motion to intervene, and the district court denied the motion on October 31, 2011. The residents appealed, but the Ninth Circuit (Judges Michael D. Hawkins, Sidney R. Thomas, and M. Margaret McKeown) upheld the district court's decision. In a decision filed on August 13, 2013, the panel found that the residents' motion to intervene had been filed too late. 538 F. App'x 759. </p><p>Back in November 2011, the court found Atascadero and Patton State Hospitals had sufficiently complied with the consent judgment and no longer were subject to the court's jurisdiction. MSH was later released from the consent agreement in October 2012.</p><p>In October 2012, the court released NSH from the consent judgment except regarding sections pertaining to placing residents in prone restraints. A recent restraint death at the hospital prompted the court to continue the restraint-related sections of the consent judgment for one more year. Napa State Hospital was eventually released from the consent judgment in October 2013. The case is now closed. </p>",

(Docket No. 105.)  Particularly, the United States’ \n3  Motion contended that Defendants were non-compliant with several provisions of \n4  the Amended Consent Judgment at Metropolitan State Hospital and Napa State \n5  Hospital.  (Id.)  Defendants opposed on January 23, 2012.  (Docket No. 251.)  \n6  After several continuances, the Parties filed supplemental briefs in September 2012 \n7  pursuant to this Court’s August 15, 2012, Order.  (See Docket Nos. 274, 275 & \n8  276.)  On September 24, 2012, this Court heard oral argument on the United \n9  States’ Motion.  On September 25, 2012, this Court granted the Motion with \n10  respect to the remaining disputed issue over the use of prone restraints at Napa \n11  State Hospital, and otherwise denied as moot the rest of the Motion because the \n12  United States was no longer pursuing the remaining issues.  (Docket No. 296.)  \n13  Pursuant to that September 25, 2012, Order:    \n14  The Court TERMINATES all the provisions of the Amended Consent \n15  Judgment as they apply to Metropolitan State Hospital.  Accordingly, because  \n16  Atascadero and Patton State Hospitals are also no longer subject to the Amended \n17  Consent Judgment, (see Order, Docket No. 64), the executive directors of \n18  Metropolitan, Atascadero, and Patton State Hospitals are dismissed as Defendants \n19  in this action.    \n20  The Court TERMINATES the provisions of the Amended Consent \n21  Judgment as they apply to Napa State Hospital, except § I.H and any other \n22  provision necessary to remedy Defendants’ non-compliance with that section.  To \n23  that end, §§ II (Enforcement), III (Modification of Terms), and IV (Compliance \n24  and Termination) are retained to the extent they do not directly conflict with the \n25  specific provisions of this Order below.   \n26  The Court ORDERS Defendants to modify their policies at Napa State \n27  Hospital to prohibit all use of prone restraints, prone containments, and prone \n28  stabilizations as called for in the Amended Consent Judgment § I.H.1. \n2\n \n \n\nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E   Document 297-1   Filed 10/03/12   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:4193\n \n1   The Court EXTENDS § I.H of the Amended Consent Judgment as it applies \n2  to Napa State Hospital for no more than 12 months from the date of this Order.  \n3  This extension modifies the five-year termination provision stated in § IV.A.       \n4  During those 12 months, the Monitor shall conduct two evaluations of Defendants’ \n5  compliance with § I.H at Napa State Hospital.  The Amended Consent Judgment’s \n6  term “maintained sustained compliance” is amended to mean that Defendants \n7  maintain substantial compliance with § I.H for at least two Monitor evaluations.  \n8  See Amended Consent Judgment § IV.A.  Within one month of the Court’s entry \n9  of this Order, the Monitor shall conduct the first evaluation and may conduct the \n10  second evaluation within six months after the first evaluation or as shortly \n11  thereafter as the Monitor deems appropriate.  After any such evaluation, the \n12  Monitor shall issue a report of his findings.            \n13  The Parties are ORDERED to file a joint report updating the Court on the \n14  status of the Monitor’s oversight no later than 10 days after the Monitor issues any \n15  such evaluation report of Napa State Hospital. \n16   \n17  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n18   \n \n19    Dated this      day of _________________ 2012. \n20   \n21   \n22   \n23  ___________________________________________________ \n24  THE HONORABLE AUDREY B.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nSpecial Litigation Section - PHB \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC  20530 \nMay 2, 2006 \nThe Honorable Arnold Schwarzenegger\nGovernor of California \nState Capitol Building\nSacramento, CA  95814 \nRe: Patton State Hospital, Patton, California \nDear Governor Schwarzenegger: \nI am writing to report the findings of the Civil Rights\nDivision’s investigation of conditions and practices at Patton\nState Hospital (“Patton”), in Patton, California.  On April 9,\n2004, we notified you that we were investigating conditions at\nPatton pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons\nAct (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  CRIPA gives the Department of\nJustice authority to seek remedies for any pattern and practice\nof conduct that violates the constitutional or federal statutory\nrights of persons with mental illness who are served in public\ninstitutions. \nIn December 2005,1 we conducted an on-site inspection of\nPatton.  We reviewed a wide variety of relevant State and\nfacility documents, including policies, procedures, and medical\nand other records relating to the care and treatment of patients.\nDuring our visit, we also interviewed Patton administrators,\nprofessionals, and staff, and talked to and observed patients in\ntheir living units, at activity areas, and during treatment\nmeetings.  We were assisted in this exercise by expert\nconsultants in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, medical\ncare, and quality assurance and risk management.  In keeping with\nour pledge of transparency and to provide technical assistance \n1  The tour was delayed until the parties resolved the\nmanner in which they would establish the applicability at Patton\nof any remedial measures developed in connection with the\nDepartment's separate investigation of Metropolitan State\nHospital. \n\n-2-\n\nwhere appropriate regarding our investigatory findings, we\nconveyed our preliminary findings to State counsel and to certain\nState and facility administrators and staff during verbal exit\npresentations at the close of our on-site visit. \nAs a threshold matter, we commend the administrators and\nstaff of Patton for their helpful and professional conduct during\nthe investigation; we received their full cooperation with our\ninvestigation.  In particular, facility personnel cooperated\nfully and expeditiously with our document requests, and worked\nwith us openly and collaboratively.  We hope to continue to work\nwith the State of California and officials at Patton in a \ncooperative manner. \nAt the time of our December 2005 visit, Patton had a census\nof over 1,500 patients.  Patton primarily provides forensic\npsychiatric services to patients admitted under a variety of\nState statutes. \nResidents of state-operated facilities have a right to live\nin reasonable safety and to receive adequate health care, along\nwith habilitation to ensure their safety and freedom from\nunreasonable restraint, prevent regression and facilitate their\nability to exercise their liberty interests.  See generally\nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  Determining whether\ntreatment is adequate focuses on whether institutional conditions\nsubstantially depart from generally accepted professional\njudgment, practices, or standards.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323;\nSharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1171-72 (9th Cir. 2000).  The \nState also must provide services in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to individual residents’ needs.  Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et\nseq.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130 (d) (“A public entity shall administer\nservices, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with\ndisabilities.”); see generally Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581\n(1999).  Additionally, the State must provide persons committed\nto psychiatric hospitals for an indefinite term with mental\nhealth treatment that gives them a realistic opportunity to be\ncured and released.  Oregon Advocacy Center v. Mink, 322 F.3d\n1101, 1121 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Sharp, 233 F.3d at 1172). \nIt is apparent that many Patton staff are highly dedicated\nindividuals who are genuinely concerned for the well-being of the\npersons in their care.  Nevertheless, there are significant and\nwide-ranging deficiencies in patient care provided at Patton.\nIndeed, conditions of care and treatment at Patton in psychiatry,\nincluding pharmaceutical services; psychology; medical care, \n\n-3-\n\nincluding general medical services, infection control, physical\nand occupational therapy, dietary, and dental care; nursing\nservices; placement in the most integrated setting; and\nprotection from harm and quality assurance, are materially\nsimilar to those outlined in the findings letters of 2003 and\n2004 regarding Metropolitan State Hospital.  Consistent with the \nstatutory requirements of CRIPA, we now write to advise you of\nthe findings of our investigation, the facts supporting them, and\nthe minimum remedial steps that are necessary to address the\ndeficiencies we have identified. \nI.  PROTECTION FROM HARM \nPatton fails to provide a reasonably safe environment for\nits patients.  Patient-on-patient violence is commonplace at\nPatton.  For example, Patton reported over 500 patient-on-patient\nassaults in the six months preceding our visit.  In fact, two\npatient homicides have occurred at Patton since September 2005,\nallegedly committed by other patients.  Not surprisingly, many\npatients we spoke with report feeling unsafe at Patton. \nPatton also fails to keep patients reasonably safe from\nself-harm.  A substantial number of incidents reported at Patton\ninvolve self-harm.  Of great concern is the high number of\nsuicide attempts by hanging.  In a recent one-month review of all \nreported suicide attempts, the vast majority of incidents\ninvolved attempts at suicide by hanging.  Sadly, we understand\nthat shortly after our visit, a patient successfully committed\nsuicide at Patton by hanging himself from his bedroom closet. \nPatton also fails to maintain an effective incident \nmanagement system and a related quality improvement (“QI”) system\nto prevent harmful incidents, and identify and correct\ndeficiencies in care and treatment.  While Patton properly tracks\nincidents and identifies trends, it fails to respond effectively\nto identified trends and, therefore, fails to prevent future\nincidents of harm.  This is contrary to the very purpose of an\neffective incident management and QI system, as required by\ngenerally accepted professional standards of care.  This failure \nis illustrated by the recent suicide by hanging, which appears to\nbe part of a trend of suicide attempts by hanging at Patton. \nThe quality of the investigations Patton completes is\ninadequate.  Although special investigators appear to complete\ntimely reports of their investigations, most incidents are only\nsubject to a review of documentation regarding the incident, such\nas the incident report, not an actual investigation in which\nwitnesses are interviewed and efforts are undertaken to determine \n\n-4-\n\nfactors such as what precipitated the incident, was supervision\nadequate, and what steps might be taken to avoid a reoccurrence.\nSignificantly, most reviews summarily conclude that the staff\nmembers involved acted properly in connection with the incident.\nThe notion that, in every instance, staff members unerringly\nchoose the proper course of action strains credulity and suggests\nthat such reviews are not reliable. \nPatton patients also are subject to adverse environmental\nconditions such as potential suicide hazards and the prevalence\nof illicit drugs.  These problems are long-standing and serious.\nYet, incident reports and other evidence make clear that the\nfacility has not corrected them.  Similarly, Patton fails to\nadequately address inappropriate sexual contact among individuals\nserved at the facility, including sexual contact between staff\nand patients.  This issue, too, is long-standing. \nConsequently, Patton fails to protect its patients from\navoidable harm.  The harm that Patton patients experience as a\nresult of these deficiencies is multifaceted, including physical\nand psychological abuse; physical injury; excessive and\ninappropriate use of physical and chemical restraints;\ninadequate, ineffective and counterproductive treatment; and\nexcessively long hospitalizations. \nII.  PSYCHIATRY \nPatton's psychiatric supports and services substantially\ndepart from generally accepted professional standards of care and\nexpose patients to a significant risk of harm and to actual harm.\nGenerally, our investigation uncovered problems in three main\nareas of psychiatry:  assessments and diagnoses, medication\nmanagement, and treatment planning. \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care require\nthat initial psychiatric diagnoses be based on complete\npsychiatric assessments in which relevant historical,\nenvironmental, biological, social, psychosocial, medical, and\nneurological factors and influences are evaluated.  Once an \ninitial diagnosis is made, ongoing assessments should be\nconducted to ensure that timely re-evaluation of the resident’s\ncondition is made and treatment adjusted accordingly. \nPsychiatric assessments and diagnoses at Patton\nsubstantially depart from generally accepted professional\nstandards of care.  Psychiatrists routinely diagnose their\npatients as having psychiatric disorders without conducting an\nadequate psychiatric assessment. \n\n-5-\nInitial assessments at Patton are not individualized and \nfail to provide a basis for a diagnostic process that has\nsufficient reliability and validity.  Moreover, initial\nassessments are routinely completed within 24 hours of admission\nto Patton, before the treating psychiatrist would be able to\nobtain input from other disciplines.  The practice of finalizing\nassessments within 24 hours deprives the psychiatrist of\npotentially critical diagnostic information. \nAnnual update assessments are likewise inadequate.  Many are\nbased on outdated information and, therefore, do not provide an\naccurate guide for the patient’s treatment.  In fact, we found\nthat Patton’s overall approach to ongoing psychiatric assessment\nreflects a lack of critical thinking and clinical inquiry.  In \nmany cases we reviewed, the psychiatrist failed to evaluate\nimportant developments in a patient’s condition that would\nsuggest that the diagnosis assigned to the patient is not\naccurate.  Without a proper understanding of a patient’s\ncondition, Patton’s psychiatrists cannot make appropriate\ntreatment decisions.  Additionally, Patton fails to adequately\nassess the presence and impact of seizure disorders when\nformulating psychiatric diagnoses and assessments. \nAs a result of the deficiencies in psychiatric assessments\nand diagnoses at Patton, patients’ actual illnesses are not being\nproperly treated and are permitted to progress.  Additionally,\npatients are exposed to potentially toxic treatments for\nconditions from which they do not suffer, patients are not\nprovided appropriate psychiatric rehabilitation, and patients’\noptions for discharge are seriously limited.\n We understand that Patton is in the process of adopting a\nnew model for integrated assessments.  This model, if implemented\nproperly, will facilitate individualized assessments and provide\nthe basis for a recovery model of treatment. \nIt is a basic tenet of generally accepted professional\nstandards of care that the use of psychiatric medication always\nshould be justified by the clinical needs of a patient.  Patton \nfails to ensure that its patients are afforded appropriate\npsychopharmacological treatment.  Vulnerable patients are\nroutinely prescribed inappropriate or unsafe medications without\nclinical justification.  In fact, we found examples of patients\non dangerously high doses of psychiatric medications without a\ndiagnosis that would justify such use, nor any evidence that the\nprescribed dose provides any benefit to the patient. \n\n-6-\n\nPatton’s monitoring of side effects of medications,\nparticularly its monitoring of the side effect tardive dyskinesia\n(“TD”), substantially departs from generally accepted standards\nof care.  TD is a serious and potentially irreversible and\ndisabling movement disorder that is associated with prolonged\ntreatment with conventional antipsychotic medications.  Patton’s \npsychiatrists are not accurately tracking patients’ signs and\nsymptoms of TD.  For example, we found significant discrepancies\nbetween the documentation of TD assessments and the patients’\nobservable condition.  Moreover, Patton fails to modify\nmedications in a timely manner, even when the medications appear\nto cause harm, and alternative treatments exist.  For example, we\nfound patients at Patton with symptoms of TD resulting from\nlongstanding use of one particular psychotropic, haloperidol.\nPatton failed to detect these symptoms and even consider\nprescribing other medications with less harmful side effects. \nTreatment planning at Patton also represents a substantial\ndeparture from generally accepted professional standards of care.\nGenerally accepted professional standards of care instruct that\ntreatment plans should dictate appropriate clinical interventions\nby integrating the individual assessments, evaluations, and\ndiagnoses of the patient performed by all disciplines involved in\nthe patient’s treatment.  Treatment plans should be\nindividualized and should identify and build on the patient’s\nstrengths, interests, preferences, and goals, to optimize the\npatient’s recovery and ability to sustain himself in the most\nintegrated, appropriate setting. \nAt Patton, current treatment plans are cursory, not\nindividualized, and not integrated.  Additionally, as discussed\nfurther in the next section, although the facility has adopted a\nnew treatment planning format that offers an individualized,\nintegrated approach to developing treatment plans, psychiatrists\nas well as other mental health professionals fail to properly\nutilize the format. \nThe preventable, serious harm resulting from these\ndeficiencies takes many forms, among them, inadequate,\nineffective and counterproductive treatment; exposure to\ninappropriate and unnecessary medications posing serious\nphysiological and other side effects; excessively long \n\n-7-\n\nhospitalizations, which compound psychiatric distress; increased\nrisk of relapse after discharge; and an overall lower quality of\nlife. \nIII. PSYCHOLOGY \nPatton's psychological services and behavioral interventions\nsubstantially depart from generally accepted professional\nstandards of care and expose the patients to significant risk of\nharm and to actual harm.  Generally, our investigation uncovered\ndeficiencies in psychosocial assessments, treatment planning,\ntreatment programming, and behavioral interventions. \nPsychosocial assessments do not comport with generally\naccepted professional standards.  As stated above, although\nPatton’s treatment planning format provides an effective template\nfor development of an integrated treatment approach, mental\nhealth clinicians fail to properly utilize the format, possibly\nbecause it is new.  We reviewed many treatment plans in which\nclinicians failed to identify the patients’ current condition and\nthe life skills needed for the patients’ condition to improve.\nTreatment objectives likewise are not constructive and do not\nreflect a patient’s actual needs.  These deficiencies contribute \nto misdirected and ineffective interventions and are a \nsubstantial departure from generally accepted professional\nstandards. \nA fundamental problem at Patton is that the treatment it\noffers does not address the patients’ actual treatment needs.\nPatton has adopted a “Treatment Mall” model for treatment\ndelivery.  Under this model, patients can choose from classes on\ntopics such as daily life skills, vocational training, education,\nand social skills to develop the skills necessary for recovery\nand return to the community. \nThe Treatment Mall model, when implemented properly, can be\nan effective method of treatment delivery.  Unfortunately, we\nfound serious deficiencies in Patton’s current execution of the \nTreatment Mall model.  Most significantly, the classes made\navailable to individual patients do not address the patients’\nspecific needs and, therefore, do not provide patients with\nmeaningful or effective treatment.  Many patients are assigned to\ncourses they have not chosen and which do not satisfy the\npatients’ treatment plans.  Moreover, most of the Treatment Mall\nclasses do not have an established curriculum, and the class\nleaders lack the training necessary for the courses to be\ntherapeutic. \n\n-8-\n\nAdditionally, Patton’s approach to patients who refuse to\nattend Treatment Mall fails to comport with generally accepted\nprofessional standards.  Currently, patients who refuse to attend\nare sent to the “Enhancement Room.”  The Enhancement Room \nconsists of a crowded enclosure in which patients are required to\nsit in chairs without any activity for the duration of the Mall\nsession.  This is not therapeutic and may aggravate the condition\nof patients already in distress.  Patton needs to develop a\nsystem for identifying why a patient is not attending his\nscheduled class, and developing interventions to address\nidentified obstacles. \nPatton’s behavior management system does not comport with\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  To develop an\neffective behavior program, generally accepted professional\npractice requires that psychology staff identify the underlying\nfactors that precipitate or cause the patient’s maladaptive\nbehavior (i.e., the “function” of the behavior) through an\nindividualized, formal functional assessment.  The functional \nassessments developed at Patton are seriously deficient and do\nnot accurately identify the function of patients’ maladaptive\nbehaviors.  Without a thorough assessment of the function of the\nresident’s maladaptive behavior, including clearly identified\nalternative behaviors to supplant the function of the maladaptive\nbehavior, behavior programs will not be successful in modifying\nthe targeted behavior. \nPatton also fails to accurately track behavior outcomes for\npatients on behavior programs.  Generally accepted professional\nstandards of care require that facilities collect and record\naccurate, reliable data regarding patients on behavior programs.\nThese data should be used to evaluate a patient’s progress toward\nbehavior-related goals and to make decisions regarding future\ntreatment.  Patton’s failure to adequately track behavior\noutcomes exposes patients to ineffective, inadequate, and/or\nunnecessarily restrictive treatment; avoidable injuries related\nto untreated behaviors and the use of unnecessary restrictive\ninterventions; and potentially dangerous and unnecessary side\neffects of medications. \nPatton’s creation of a “Positive Behavior Support” (“PBS”)\nteam to address patients with challenging behaviors shows great\npromise.  Currently, however, the PBS team is not integrated with\nthe treatment teams, nor are PBS plans integrated with patients’\ntreatment plans.  Lack of integration causes the development of\ninterventions based on incomplete information and possibly in\nconflict with other treatments and interventions.  Lack of \nintegration also causes inconsistent and inadequate \n\n-9-\n\nimplementation of interventions, which often must be implemented\nuniformly throughout the day to be effective.  Moreover, with a\npopulation of over 1,500 patients, it is likely that the actual\nneed for behavior programs at Patton is significantly higher than\nthe handful of patients who currently have PBS plans. \nThe harm that the deficiencies identified above present to\npatients takes many forms, among them, diagnoses that perpetuate\ntheir behavioral difficulties; unnecessarily extending their stay\nin a highly restrictive setting; subjecting them to excessive and\nunnecessary use of sedating medications and restrictive\npractices; fostering despair and hopelessness; and, in some\ncases, depriving them of physical safety. \nIV.  RESTRAINTS, SECLUSION, AND PRN MEDICATIONS \nPatton’s practices with respect to use of restraints and\nseclusion substantially depart from generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care.  Patton’s efforts to reduce its \nuse of restraints and seclusion are commendable.  Nevertheless,\nPatton staff frequently use restraints and seclusion in lieu of\ntreatment and as a first course of action with patients\nexhibiting problematic behaviors, without adequate consideration\nof whether less restrictive measures would suffice.  Moreover,\nPatton staff are not adequately trained in crisis diversion and\nde-escalation techniques.  For example, incident reports describe\nunnecessary power struggles between staff and patients which tend\nto escalate incidents, and fail to include a description of less\nrestrictive interventions that were attempted prior to use of\nrestraints or seclusion. \nPatton’s system for use of psychiatric medications on a pro \nre nata (“PRN”), or as-needed, basis is seriously deficient.  The \nfrequency of administration of PRN’s at Patton is strikingly high\nand inadequately monitored.  PRN medications should be used for \npsychiatric purposes only as a short-term measure to relieve a\npatient in acute distress.  However, Patton staff repeatedly\nemploy PRN medications as a substitute for treatment of the\npatient’s underlying condition, and/or as a form of chemical\nrestraint but without the documentation and monitoring that use\nof chemical restraint requires.  Moreover, physicians and other\ntreatment professionals are not routinely notified of PRN uses,\ndespite the fact that some patients are receiving PRN medications\nevery four hours.  Thus, there is inadequate clinical oversight\nof the frequency of PRN usage as well as of the implications that\nsuch frequency may have for a patient’s treatment goals and\ninterventions. \n\n-10-\n\nV.  PHARMACY \nPatton fails to provide adequate pharmacy services.\nPharmacists fail to adequately review individual patients’\nmedication regimens, and fail to adequately evaluate drug use at\nthe facility.  In fact, pharmacists appear to be wholly\ndisconnected from medication management at Patton. \nAdditionally, Patton’s system for tracking adverse drug\nreactions (“ADR’s”) fails to meet generally accepted professional\nstandards of care.  Established standards require that facilities\nidentify and track incidents in which patients experience\nnegative reactions to medications (ADR’s) in order to identify\nproblematic trends and their remedies.  Patton’s system for\ntracking ADR’s is seriously deficient.  For example, one ADR was\nreported in the month prior to our tour.  In a facility of over\n1,500 patients, only one ADR within an entire month is highly\nsuspect and strongly suggests that the system is not reliable.\nPatton’s system for reporting medication errors is likewise\ninadequate. \nBy not providing adequate pharmacy services, Patton places\nits patients at risk for the misuse of medication, unnecessary\nside effects from medication, potential drug interactions,\ngeneral health problems, and excessively long hospitalizations. \nVI.  GENERAL MEDICAL CARE \nMedical care at Patton, including preventative, routine,\nspecialized, and emergency services, substantially departs from\ngenerally accepted professional standards of care.  In general,\nmedical care at Patton is reactive, and little attention is paid\nto identifying and responding to significant changes in patients’\nphysical status, establishing target outcomes, and measuring\nsuccess of interventions. \nPatton’s documentation and medical record keeping practices\nexacerbate the inadequacy of the care provided.  Medical \ndocumentation is abundant but fragmented, and it is difficult to\ndetermine what course of action, if any, has been taken in a\ncase.  In many records, medical diagnoses are not current, and\ntreatment objectives are not identified.  Numerous notes in \nmedical records contain directives to “monitor” a patient,\nwithout a target outcome identified or any evidence of follow-up\nto this directive.  Dental records are not kept in patients’\ncharts and do not contain a comprehensive dental assessment. \n\n-11-\n\nIn contrast to generally accepted professional standards of\ncare, Patton fails to provide adequate physical, occupational,\nand speech therapy assessments and services that permit persons\nevaluated for such services to regain, maintain, or improve\nfunctioning.  A number of patients at Patton have significant\nneeds, but have not been referred for physical, occupational, and\nspeech therapy.  Moreover, the physical, occupational, and speech\ntherapy clinicians are not integrated into the treatment teams.\nTherefore, therapy interventions are not consistently implemented\nand reinforced by other staff throughout a patient’s day.  In \nthis way, the lack of integration results in poor outcomes, even\nwhen patients are referred for such services.  Dietary and\nnutritional services are likewise not adequately integrated and\nfail to meet the patients’ needs. \nBy not providing adequate medical services, Patton exposes\nits patients to a significant risk of harm and actual harm due to\nthe lack of timely, routine and preventative care, causing\npatient health care to deteriorate. \nVII. NURSING\n Patton’s nursing services substantially depart from\ngenerally accepted professional standards of care and treatment\nand expose patients to a significant risk of harm and actual\nharm.  As with the medical staff, the nursing staff are not\nadequately integrated with treatment teams, leading to a\nfragmented and inadequate delivery of services.  Nursing\ndocumentation is also voluminous.  However, nursing notes do not\nprovide useful information regarding the patient’s current status\nor plan of care.  Treatment objectives and interventions are not\nadequately identified, measured, or recorded. \nVIII. PLACEMENT IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care and, as\nset forth above, federal law require that treatment teams, with\nthe leadership of psychiatrists and the support of the hospital\nadministration, actively pursue the timely discharge to the most\nintegrated, appropriate setting that is consistent with patients’\nneeds and the terms of any court-ordered confinement.  In this \nregard, factors that contributed to previous unsuccessful\nplacements should be identified and addressed.  Life skills \nnecessary for successful discharge should be identified soon\nafter admission, and interventions for skill acquisition should\nbe developed and implemented.  Patton’s discharge planning\nprocess significantly fails to meet these standards of care.\nPatton fails to identify and address factors that contributed to \n\n-12-\n\nprevious unsuccessful placements.  Consequently, the process\nresults in unnecessarily extended hospitalizations, poor\ntransitions, and a high likelihood of readmission, all of which\nresult in harm to Patton’s patients. \nIX.  MINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES \nThe minimum remedial measures required to protect the\nconstitutional and federal statutory rights of the patients at\nPatton are set forth below and more extensively detailed in the\n“Enhancement Plan” negotiated between the State and the\nDepartment: \nA.\t Integrated Treatment Planning  Patton should provide its\npatients with integrated treatment planning consistent with\ngenerally accepted professional standards of care. \nB.\t Assessments  Patton should ensure that its patients receive\naccurate, complete, and timely assessments, consistent with\ngenerally accepted professional standards of care, and that\nthese assessments drive treatment interventions. \nC.\t Psychiatry Services  Patton should provide adequate\npsychiatric supports and services for the treatment of the\nseverely and persistently mentally ill population it serves\nin accordance with generally accepted professional\nstandards of care. \nD.\t Psychology Services  Patton should provide psychological\nsupports and services adequate to treat the functional and\nbehavioral needs of its patients according to generally\naccepted professional standards of care. \nE.\t Restraints, Seclusion, and PRN Medications  Patton should \nensure that restraints, seclusion, and PRN medications are\nused in accordance with generally accepted professional\nstandards of care. \nF.\t Pharmacy  Patton’s patients should receive pharmacy\nservices consistent with generally accepted professional\nstandards of care. \nG.\t General Medical Care  Patton should provide adequate\npreventative, routine, specialized, and emergency medical\nservices, occupational, physical, and speech therapy, and\ndental and dietary services, on a timely basis, in\naccordance with generally accepted professional standards\nof care. \n\n-13-\n\nH.\t Nursing Care Patton should provide nursing services to its\npatients consistent with generally accepted professional\nstandards of care.  Such services should result in Patton’s \npatients receiving individualized services, supports, and\ntherapeutic interventions, consistent with their treatment\nplans. \nI.\t Documentation of Patient Progress Patton should ensure that \npatient records accurately reflect patient progress,\nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards\nof care. \nJ.\t Discharge Planning and Placement in the Most Integrated\nSetting  Within the limitations of court-imposed\nconfinement, the State should pursue actively the\nappropriate discharge of patients and ensure that they are\nprovided services in the most integrated, appropriate\nsetting that is consistent with the patients’ needs. \nK.\t Protection From Harm  Patton should provide its patients\n\nwith a safe and humane environment and protect them from\n\nharm.\n\n***** \nWe hope to continue working with the State in an amicable and\ncooperative fashion to resolve our outstanding concerns with\nregard to Patton.  Provided that our cooperative relationship\ncontinues, we will forward our expert consultants’ reports under\nseparate cover.  Although their reports are their work – and do\nnot necessarily represent the official conclusions of the\nDepartment of Justice - their observations, analyses and\nrecommendations provide further elaboration of the relevant\nconcerns, and offer practical assistance in addressing them.  We \nhope that you will give this information careful consideration\nand that it will assist in your efforts at prompt remediation. \nWe are obligated to advise you that, in the unexpected event\nthat we are unable to reach a resolution regarding our concerns,\nwithin 49 days after your receipt of this letter, the Attorney\nGeneral is authorized to initiate a lawsuit pursuant to CRIPA,\nto correct deficiencies of the kind identified in this letter. \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(1).  We would very much prefer,\nhowever, to resolve this matter by working cooperatively with \n\n-14-\n\nyou.  Accordingly, we will soon contact State officials to\ndiscuss this matter in further detail. \nIf you have any questions regarding this letter, please call\nShanetta Y. Cutlar, Chief of the Civil Rights Division’s Special\nLitigation Section, at (202) 514-0195. \nSincerely, \nWan J.

      "title": "Re: Napa State Hospital, Napa, California",
      "text": "June 27, 2005\n\nThe Honorable Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nGovernor of California\n\nState Capitol Building\n\nSacramento, CA  95814\n\nRe: Napa State Hospital, Napa, California\n\nDear Governor Schwarzenegger:\n\nOn January 6, 2004, we notified then-Governor Gray Davis of\n\nour intent to investigate conditions at Napa State Hospital\n\n(“Napa”), in Napa, California, pursuant to the Civil Rights of\n\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  I\n\nwrite now to provide the statutorily required findings of that\n\ninvestigation, the bases for those findings, and the minimum\n\nremedial measures that we believe are warranted to correct\n\ndeficiencies contributing to conditions that violate the federal\n\nrights of individuals residing in this facility.\n\nAs a threshold matter, we note that State officials have\n\ndeclined to cooperate with this investigation.  In particular,\n\nthey repeatedly have refused to allow the Department access to\n\nthe facility, most recently stating that access will not be\n\nprovided before sometime in 2006.  The State’s conduct is unusual\n\nin this regard.  Most government officials cooperate with CRIPA\n\ninvestigations because they recognize that protecting the rights\n\nof institutionalized citizens warrants a thorough and impartial\n\nreview.  Indeed, the State cooperated with the Department\n\nregarding a previous CRIPA investigation of Napa that was\n\nresolved via a consent decree in 1990.1  The State also\n\ncooperated with our investigation of Metropolitan State Hospital\n\nin June and July 2002 (“Metropolitan”).  Since then, however, the\n\nState has declined our requests for access to Napa and to \n\nthe State’s other mental health care facilities that we are\n\ninvestigating, Patton State Hospital and Atascadero State\n\nHospital.2\n\n1  Consent Decree, United States v. California, No. C90­\n\n2641, (N.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 1990).\n\n2  In May 2005, the State did permit Department staff to\n\ninterview certain Patton patients and has agreed to provide us\n\n\n- 2 ­\n\nAs we understand it, the State’s position is that permitting\n\nthe Department access to Napa, and its other facilities, before\n\nsometime next year would excessively divert limited resources at\n\na time when the State is undertaking significant reforms.  We\n\nattempted to address the State’s concerns by offering to conduct\n\na streamlined tour of Napa, and we reminded the State that we\n\nwere committed to providing technical assistance during the tour\n\nand to working in a transparent manner.  If the State had agreed\n\nto our proposed investigation procedures, State officials would\n\nhave had an early opportunity to work directly with our experts\n\nand staff.  They also would have had an opportunity to address\n\nany identified problems on a voluntary basis at an early stage of\n\nthis investigation.  Regrettably, the State has maintained its\n\nopposition to permitting the Department access. \n\nAs we repeatedly advised State officials, however, our\n\ninvestigations proceed regardless of whether officials choose to\n\ncooperate.  Indeed, when CRIPA was enacted, lawmakers considered\n\nthe possibility that local officials might not assist a federal\n\ninvestigation.  Such non-cooperation is a factor that may be\n\nconsidered adversely when drawing conclusions about a facility. \n\nSee H.R. CONF. REP. 96-897, at 12 (1980), reprinted in 1980\n\nU.S.C.A.A.N. 832, 836.  We now draw such an adverse conclusion. \n\nThe State’s non-cooperation is only one factor that we have\n\nconsidered in preparing our statutorily-required findings and\n\nrecommendations.  We have also considered information from\n\nseveral recent on-site surveys conducted by the Centers for\n\nMedicaid and Medicare Services (\"CMS\") and by the State's\n\nDepartment of Health Services (“DHS”), and conducted interviews\n\nwith professionals, advocates, family members of patients, and\n\npatients themselves.  In doing so, we found evidence of\n\nsignificant and wide-ranging deficiencies in Napa’s provision of\n\ncare to its patients. \n\nTragically illustrative of the widespread and systemic\n\ndeficiencies that currently exist at Napa is the case of patient\n\nQ.R.,3 who committed suicide by hanging in December 2004. \n\nwith requested portions of charts from patients who authorized us\n\nto obtain such records.\n\n3  We use pseudo-initials to refer to individual patients,\n\nin order to protect their privacy. \n\n\n- 3 ­\n\nSeveral months before his suicide, Q.R. attempted suicide (also\n\nby hanging), which staff told his family was an attention-getting\n\nbehavior, and not a realistic threat.  This patient's family was\n\nin frequent contact with his counselor at Napa, and conveyed to\n\nthe counselor its concern that the patient's escalating episodes\n\nof violence were uncharacteristic and needed to be treated.  On\n\nthe day of Q.R.’s death, a family member who had just spoken with\n\nQ.R. phoned the nurses' station on his ward to warn that Q.R. was\ndespondent, crying, and in need of attention.  Despite this\n\nspecific warning and the patient's history of suicide attempt,\n\nstaff failed to act.  Less than an hour later, Q.R. was\n\ndiscovered by a peer, hanging by a sheet in his room.  Because\n\nthe State denied us access to the facility to investigate these\n\nallegations, we have no reason not to conclude that the\n\ncontentions are accurate, and that Napa's failure to intervene\n\nappropriately was a cause of this young man's death. \n\nThe preceding incident is emblematic of the systemic\n\ndeficiencies at Napa.  We have received overwhelming information\n\nthat, following the dismissal of the consent decree in 1995,\n\nsignificant problems recurred at Napa, including:  failure to\n\nprotect patients from harm from assaults and suicide; \n\ninappropriate use of seclusion, restraint and PRN (“pro re nata”\n\nor “as-needed”) psychotropic medications; and inadequate medical,\n\nnursing and psychiatric care.  In addition, we have received\n\ninformation evidencing deficient treatment planning, programming,\n\nand nutritional management; unsanitary conditions; and failure to\n\nplace patients in the most integrated setting as required by the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et seq.\n\n(\"ADA\"), and the President's New Freedom Initiative, which\n\nprioritizes community-based alternatives for individuals with\n\ndisabilities.  See Exec. Order No. 13217, §§ 1(a)-(c), 66 Fed.\n\nReg. 33155 (June 18, 2001).  Our findings, the facts that support\n\nthem, and the minimum remedial steps that we believe are\n\nnecessary to correct deficiencies are set forth below.\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\n\nNapa has been in operation since November 1875.  It is\n\nsituated on a 138-acre campus and houses almost 1,100 adult\n\npatients.  These individuals are classified as “low to moderate\n\nrisk” and are civilly committed or committed through criminal\n\nproceedings.  In our previous investigation of Napa, we\n\nidentified deficiencies in the facility’s protections from harm,\n\nuse of restraints, and provision of medical care, among other\n\nareas.  These concerns were addressed in a consent decree that\n\n\n- 4 ­\n\nwas dismissed in 1995 based on the Department’s assessment that\n\nNapa, at that time, was in substantial compliance with the\n\ndecree’s requirements.\n\nII.  FINDINGS\n\nA.  PROTECTION FROM HARM\n\nNapa is constitutionally required to provide patients\n\nreasonable protection from harm and freedom from bodily\n\nrestraint.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315-16 (1982). \n\nInformation from multiple, credible sources leads us to conclude\n\nthat Napa fails to protect patients from harm and abuse.  We have\n\ndetermined that the harm suffered by Napa’s patients is multi­\n\nfaceted, including physical injury by assault; death by suicide\n\ndue to inadequate suicide precautions; excessive and\n\ninappropriate use of physical and chemical restraints and\n\nseclusion; inadequate, ineffective, and counterproductive\n\ntreatment; and exposure to unnecessary environmental hazards. \n\nA major factor in Napa's failure to protect patients from\n\nharm is inadequate supervision.  As DHS has reported, “[e]ven\n\nthough clients in the facility can be extremely unpredictable and\n\nviolent, they are left unsupervised for long periods of time.” \n\nFamily members of patients and advocates who frequently visit\n\nNapa confirm that patients are left unattended, without staff\n\nobservation or interaction.  A number of incidents occurred when\n\nmedically required one-to-one staffing was cancelled, apparently\n\nnot due to clinical decisions, but rather staff shortages. \n\nMoreover, as a nurse at Napa reported, “there are not enough\n\npeople on hand to subdue [out-of-control patients]....  So an\n\nalarm is set off or the hospital police are called.  But it takes\n\nat least five minutes, sometimes 10 or more to get there, and a\n\nlot can happen during that time.”\n\n1.  Patient-on-Patient Assaults\n\nNapa patients suffer from repeated acts of aggression by\n\npeers, resulting in serious injuries, and in one case, a\n\nhomicide.  In egregious departures from accepted standards, staff\n\noften fail to intervene and/or fail to report the incidents. \n\nStaff likewise do not attempt to prevent repeated assaults by\n\naddressing the underlying behavior of the aggressors.\n\nMany instances of inappropriate aggression in a psychiatric\n\nhospital such as Napa result from patients exhibiting symptoms of\n\n\n- 5 ­\n\ntheir mental health disorders.  Without the benefit of\n\nappropriate medication and therapeutic interventions, patients\n\noften lack the means to control such symptoms.  Thus, inadequate\n\nmental health treatment exposes individuals to excessive levels\n\nof violence.  Examples of failures to prevent known aggressors\n\nfrom repeated acts of serious aggression include:\n\n•\t On May 3, 2002, a patient was strangled to death by his\n\nroommate.  The roommate had previously been convicted of\n\nseveral violent crimes and had a history of attacking peers,\n\nincluding two attacks on sleeping patients.  Reportedly,\n\nthere are no bedrooms set aside to house separately patients\n\nwho demonstrate the potential to harm others.\n\n•\t Between January and June 2003, one patient assaulted other\n\npatients at least 20 times, including at least 17 incidents\n\nin which he punched or kicked other patients in the head or\n\nface.  Staff were afraid of this patient and failed to\n\nintervene to protect other patients. \n\n•\t In June 2002, a patient with a history of aggressive\n\nbehavior attacked another patient in the TV room, punching\n\nhim and stabbing him in the neck with a portable radio\n\nantenna.  Staff failed to report the assault to the\n\nlicensing authorities.\n\n•\t On November 18, 2002, a patient who was ordered to be under\n\nconstant observation by staff assaulted another patient.  He\n\npreviously had assaulted two patients on October 3, 2002,\n\nand one patient on September 18, 2002.  In addition, an\n\nassessment dated September 3, 2002, indicated that he had\n\n“numerous recent assaults on peers.”\n\n•\t Two patients known to be “extremely assaultive” were placed\n\nin a bedroom together where they were not supervised for\n\nsignificant periods of time.  On August 8, 2001, one patient\n\nattacked the other, punching him in the nose.  The following\n\nday, that patient retaliated by choking his roommate until\n\nhe passed out. \n\nPatient advocates and patients themselves tell us that staff\n\noften fail to intervene with violent patients because the staff\n\nare afraid.  Last fall, Napa's Clinical Administrator confirmed\n\nto CMS surveyors that \"staff become fearful of patients who have\n\nbeen assaultive.\"  Examples of staff failing to intervene\n\ninclude:\n\n\n- 6 ­\n\n•\t On November 11, 2003, one patient stabbed another in the\n\nface and back with an 11-inch “shank” made from an antenna. \n\nFour days earlier, the victim had told staff that he feared\n\nthat he would be attacked.  The State’s regulatory agency\n\nconcluded that Napa had failed to investigate the source or\n\nnature of the threat identified by the victim, and it\n\nimposed a treble fine on the facility for its failure to\n\nprotect the victim.\n\n•\t On September 20, 2002, a 38-year-old woman suffered “great\n\nbodily injury” when she was beaten by three male patients. \n\nAccording to the woman, the other patients “kicked the shit\n\nout of me.”  Staff did not intervene, nor did staff report\n\nto Napa authorities the significant bruises and injuries to\n\nthis client.4\n\n2.  Inadequate Suicide Precautions\n\nSeveral Napa patients have committed suicide in recent\n\nyears, often using the same method to do so:\n\n•\t On March 20, 2005, Napa patient M.E. committed suicide by\n\nhanging himself in a locked bathroom. \n\n•\t Napa patient Q.R. committed suicide by hanging in December\n\n2004.  Several months earlier, he had attempted suicide by\n\nhanging; notwithstanding his history, Napa staff failed to\n\nintervene or adequately supervise Q.R. when a family member\n\ncalled the nurses station on his unit the day of his death\n\nand informed staff that Q.R. was despondent and crying and\n\nin need of attention. \n\n•\t On July 21, 2003, a man hanged himself from a door using a\n\nradio cord, on the same ward where another patient committed\n\nsuicide only a month earlier.\n\n4  The failure to report or investigate a serious incident\n\nis not uncommon at Napa, and is a substantial departure from\n\naccepted standards of care.  Numerous sources described incidents\n\nto us, including this assault, inappropriate sexual contact\n\nbetween residents or staff and residents, and illegal drug use,\n\nwhich were not reported to and/or not investigated by Napa\n\nauthorities. \n\n\n- 7 ­\n\n•\t On June 3, 2003, a patient who had previously been reported\n\nas suicidal hanged himself using a bed sheet.\n\n•\t On September 4, 2001, a patient committed suicide by hanging\n\nwith a bed sheet in his ward.\n\n•\t On July 16, 1999, a man known to be suicidal hanged himself\n\nwith bedsheets tied to a light fixture.\n\nIn February 2005, CMS cited Napa for failing to complete the\n\nsuicide assessment of a patient for more than six months after\n\nhis admission.  CMS found that Napa did not provide translation\n\nservices to complete the suicide assessment of this patient, who\n\ncould not communicate in English. \n\nThe State's own surveyors previously cited Napa for failing\n\nto identify and address current symptoms of yet another patient\n\nwith a documented history of suicide attempts.  In July 2004, DHS\n\nimposed a treble fine on Napa for failing to assess and treat a\n\npatient whose suicide attempt was reported to staff by a peer and\n\nwhose records contained numerous observations documenting his\n\ndepression during that time, including:  \"verbalized feelings of\n\ndepression;\" the patient stating that his \"spirit was broken;\"\n\nand the patient requesting medication for depression and\n\nagitation.  Notwithstanding this significant evidence of a mental\n\nhealth treatment need, the facility’s nursing staff did not\n\nassess or evaluate the patient, and the treatment team did not\n\namend his treatment interventions to address this need.  I would\n\nnote that DHS imposes treble fines only when the violation is a\n\nrepeat violation within a short time frame.  Napa has been warned\n\nrepeatedly of deficiencies in its suicide prevention practices,\n\nbut has failed to remedy them. \n\n3.\t Harmful Contraband\n\nNapa also fails to protect patients from harmful contraband. \n\nThe State's own Department of Health Services has determined that\n\npolicies requiring investigation of all contraband are not\n\nfollowed.  Numerous credible allegations corroborate our finding\n\nthat Napa fails to control traffic in harmful contraband,\n\nincluding illegal narcotics.  We have determined that patients\n\nhave access to illegal drugs, including marijuana and cocaine,\n\nwhile residing at Napa.  Patients allege, moreover, that staff\n\nprovide illegal drugs to patients in return for cash or sex. \n\nEvidence that patients are obtaining access to contraband\n\nincludes:\n\n\n- 8 ­\n\n•\t Three different Napa patients overdosed on amphetamines\n\nand/or cocaine in fall 2004, including one patient who died\n\nof the overdose.  Three other patients obtained and used\n\nheroin during this time period.\n\n•\t In September 2004, a Napa physician testified under oath\n\nthat Napa's staff brings drugs into the facility in exchange\n\nfor cash.5\n\n•\t An independent psychologist who recently examined a Napa\n\npatient and all of his medical records told us that the\n\nclient, L.A., tested positive for marijuana and other street\n\ndrugs six months after his admission to Napa. \n\n•\t In late 2002, the State's own surveyors documented numerous\n\nindications of drug use by Napa residents that were neither\n\ninvestigated by the facility nor addressed by the residents'\n\ntreatment teams.  A Napa police staff member told the state\n\nsurveyors, \"[W]e don't have the resources to stop the drugs\n\n[coming into the facility].\"\n\n•\t As described in the discussion above regarding patient-on-\n\npatient assaults, the patient who strangled his roommate to\n\ndeath on May 2, 2002, was a heavy drug user who had tested\n\npositive for cocaine, amphetamines, and barbiturates in the\n\nfive months prior to the incident, even though he had been\n\nconfined to Napa for two years.\n\n•\t One patient tested positive for marijuana, cocaine, and\n\nalcohol while at Napa in 2001 and 2002, and was seen\n\ninjecting another patient with a needle on September 5,\n\n2002.\n\n4.  Seclusion, Restraints and PRN Medications\n\nGenerally accepted professional standards of care dictate\n\nthat seclusion and restraints:  (a) will be used only when\n\npersons pose a safety threat to themselves or others and after a\n\nhierarchy of less restrictive measures has been considered and/or\n\nexhausted; (b) will not be used in the absence of, or as an\n\nalternative to, active treatment, as punishment, or for the\n\nconvenience of staff; (c) will not be used as a behavioral\n\n5  This testimony was submitted during a conditional\n\nrelease hearing for patient L.A. \n\n\n- 9 ­\n\nintervention, and (d) will be terminated once the person is no\n\nlonger a danger to himself or others.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at\n\n324 (“[The State] may not restrain patients except when and to\n\nthe extent professional judgment deems this necessary to assure\n\nsuch safety to provide needed training.”)  Generally accepted\n\nprofessional standards also instruct that PRN psychotropic\n\nmedications should be used only as a short-term measure to \n\nrelieve a patient in acute distress, not as means to escape mild,\n\npossibly healthy, discomfort or as a repeatedly deployed\n\nsubstitute for treatment. \n\nMisuse of seclusion and restraint was a significant area of\n\nconcern during our first CRIPA investigation of Napa.  In\n\naddition to overuse and misuse of physical restraints and\n\nseclusion, our earlier investigation found an exorbitant number\n\nof PRN (pro re nata or \"as needed\") medication orders, suggesting\n\nthat they were used for the convenience of staff to sedate and\n\ncontrol patients.  Substantial evidence shows that misuse of\n\nseclusion and restraint is a significant area of concern again. \n\nStatistics published on the DMH web site show the duration of\n\nrestraint episodes at Napa to be substantially higher than the\n\nsystem's average in 2004.  The average duration of restraint\n\nepisodes at Napa during each quarter of 2004 was more than double\n\nthose at Metropolitan State Hospital (where we also found\n\nunconstitutional use of seclusion and restraint) during this same\n\ntime.6  Data comparing administration of emergency psychiatric\n\nmedication7 in the State's four public psychiatric hospitals also\n\n6  February 19, 2004 CRIPA Findings Letter Regarding\n\nConditions at Metropolitan State Hospital.  We currently are\n\nnegotiating to reach a resolution of the Metropolitan\n\ninvestigation.  Of the State's four psychiatric hospitals, the\n\nresidents at Metropolitan and Napa are the most similar, and\n\ninclude both civilly-committed and forensic patients.  Patton and\n\nAtascadero State Hospitals admit only forensic patients. \n\n7  We refer to this published data on emergency\n\nmedications as an indicator of PRN usage.  Although not every\n\nadministration of a PRN medication is an emergency use, and vice\n\nversa, in most cases, the two sets of data overlap.  The data\n\ngenerally support the claims of Napa patients and families that\n\nNapa overuses PRN medications.  Because the State denied us\n\ntimely access to the facility and patient records to conduct our\n\ninvestigation, we have little choice but to conclude that the\n\nallegations are true. \n\n\n- 10 ­\n\nshows that Napa's rate was nearly twice that at Metropolitan.8\n\nThis is a concern because we found the high levels of seclusion,\n\nrestraint and PRN medications at Metropolitan to be evidence of a\n\nfailure to follow generally accepted professional practices. \n\nSpecifically, frequent resort to seclusion, restraint and PRN\n\nmedication is an indicator that a patient's diagnosis is\n\nerroneous and/or that the treatment plan is inappropriate and\n\nshould be re-evaluated.\n\nIn September 2004, and again in February 2005, Napa was\n\ncited by CMS for continuing deficiencies in the use of seclusion\n\nand restraints.  In both surveys, CMS found that Napa failed to\n\njustify the use of restraints; failed to ensure physicians'\n\norders and face-to-face assessments in application of restraints;\n\nand failed to limit use of restraints and seclusion to documented\n\nemergencies.  When interviewed by CMS surveyors regarding\n\nexamples of inappropriate restraint, Napa's Clinical Director\n\nstated, \"[m]aybe our system is not working.\"  Examples of\n\ninappropriate uses of seclusion or restraint include:\n\n•\t A patient identified in a February 2005 CMS survey was\n\nsecluded for 30 hours, during which time staff's recorded\n\nobservations included:  \"appears sleeping,\" \"eating,\"\n\n\"drinking,\" \"eyes open staring in space,\" and \"not\n\nresponding.\"  These behaviors do not reflect violence\n\nrequiring seclusion, and there was no evidence that the\n\npatient was released during these times to see if she could\n\ncontrol her behavior without being secluded.  On a second\n\noccasion, the same patient was secluded for 36 hours, with\n\nthe following release criteria:  \"when client is able to\n\nmake eye contact to staff with relaxed muscle tone.\"  During\n\nthis second episode of seclusion, the patient was observed \n\nas \"not responding to staff,\" and \"covering self with\n\nblanket, mute,\" behaviors not indicative of violence\n\nrequiring seclusion.\n\n•\t The February 2005 CMS survey also identified a patient who\n\nwas admitted while under restraint and continued in\n\nrestraints for more than 48 hours.  Documentation shows that\n\n8  Inexplicably, of the four hospitals' statistics, only\n\nNapa's are expressly limited to use of \"intramuscular\n\ninjections.\"  It appears that Napa's actual use of emergency\n\nmedications, including any delivered via methods other than\n\nintramuscular injection, is higher.\n\n\n- 11 ­\n\nrestraint was continued based on past behaviors; current\n\nbehaviors noted in the documentation clearly did not justify\n\nrestraint, including \"demanding, whining,\" \"eating dinner,\"\n\n\"staring at wall,\" and \"eyes closed.\" \n\n•\t Another patient identified in the February 2005 CMS survey\n\nwas \"walking wrist to waist restrained\" for 50 hours based\n\non a physician order stating, \"[w]alking wrist to waist\n\nrestraints when out of his own room.  No release criteria\n\nother than being release criteria [sic] in his own room.\" \n\nThe Medical Director, when questioned by CMS whether this\n\nuse of restraints was justified based on an immediate threat\n\nof violence, stated, \"I think it is less restrictive to\n\nallow the patient out in the milieu in these restraints,\n\nrather than having to stay in his room.\" \n\n•\t Another patient was restrained on 20 occasions between\n\nAugust 2nd and September 21, 2004, for a total of 920.4\n\nhours, or 75% of her hospital time during this period.  One\n\nepisode was for 369 consecutive hours. \n\n•\t Another patient, who had Down syndrome and whose primary\n\nlanguage was not English, was observed by CMS surveyors in\n\nthree-point restraints on September 20, 2004.  Records\n\nshowed he had been restrained in three or five-point\n\nrestraints since admission three days earlier.  None of the\n\ninformation in his charts suggested any justification for\n\nuse of restraints.\n\n•\t PRNs are used inappropriately, and as a substitute for\n\nsufficient staff supervision and therapeutic interventions. \n\nFor example, a patient who pushed away a peer in self\n\ndefense when the peer assaulted her was given a PRN for her\n\nown \"aggression.\"  Generally accepted practices and federal\n\nregulations, 42 C.F.R. § 482.13, prohibit use of restraints\n\n(including medications) unless the person poses an immediate\n\nsafety threat to themselves or others and after a hierarchy\n\nof less restrictive measures has been considered and/or\n\nexhausted. \n\nPrevious CMS surveys confirm that Napa's misuse of\n\nrestraints and seclusion is a serious and long-standing problem: \n\n•\t On February 2, 2001, a patient died while in three-point\n\nprone restraints in a seclusion room.  The patient was\n\nrestrained on his stomach and choked to death while eating. \n\n\n- 12 ­\n\nThe patient’s chart reflects that he was at increased risk\n\nof positional asphyxia because he suffered from\n\nhypertension, obesity, and Huntington’s disease. \n\nInexplicably, this patient was served a meal in this\n\nposition and was monitored only by an audio/video monitor\n\nthat showed the back of his head.\n\n•\t In three of three records reviewed by CMS in August 2001,\n\nrestraints were used without having been approved in the\n\npatients' plans of care.  A supervisor interviewed by CMS\n\nwas unaware of accepted professional standards requiring\n\nthat patients subject to restraint have plans of care\n\nexpressly addressing the restraints used, including\n\nassessments addressing the need for restraints, appropriate \n\ninterventions based on those assessments, evaluation of the\n\neffectiveness of the interventions, and re-intervention as\n\nwarranted.\n\nMultiple independent sources have alleged that staff at Napa\n\ngoad patients into behaviors that are then punished with\n\nrestraint or seclusion.  More particularly, staff frequently\n\nprovoke patients into verbal confrontations to justify placing\n\nthe patients in seclusion.  If a patient resists being placed in\n\nseclusion, the patient is then restrained.  Because the State has\n\ndenied us access to the facility to investigate these\n\nallegations, we are compelled to conclude that they are accurate. \n\n5.  Failure to Control Environmental Hazards\n\nIn a facility serving people at risk of harming themselves\n\nor others, the environment should be kept free of hazards.  Napa\n\nhas failed to meet this generally accepted professional standard\n\nof care. \n\nExamples of Napa’s breakdown in environmental protections\n\ninclude the prevalence of appurtenances and other fixtures upon\n\nwhich patients tie off to commit suicide; jagged and broken wall\n\ntiles; and highly unsanitary bathroom areas.  CMS, in fact, has\n\ndetermined that staff takes no action, or completely ineffective\n\naction, to prevent patients from soiling common areas with human\n\nwaste.  Exposure to others' wastes is a health hazard. \n\nB. \t MEDICAL, NURSING, AND PSYCHIATRIC CARE\n\n\n- 13 ­\n\n1.\t Deficiencies in Preventative, Routine, and\n\nEmergency Medical, Nursing, Dental, and\n\nPsychiatric Care\n\nThe State is required to provide adequate medical care to\n\npatients, including adequate nursing care.  Youngberg, 457 U.S.\n\nat 315, 322.  We find that Napa does not provide adequate medical\n\nand nursing care to patients.  Regulatory agency surveys from\n\n2001 to as recently as February 2005 indicate persistent\n\ndeficiencies in medical and nursing care:  nursing care is not\n\nprovided to all patients who need it; registered nurses do not\n\nconsistently supervise and evaluate the nursing care of each\n\npatient; the nursing staff does not consistently develop a\n\nnursing care plan for each patient; staff fail to ensure the\n\nproper implementation of patients’ care plans; care plans are\n\ninadequate and outdated; dental care is inadequate; documentation\n\nand reporting of treatment and symptoms is inadequate; and\n\nmedications are not consistently administered properly.  In\n\naddition, medical care –- including psychiatric assessments –- is\n\nnot consistently timely, responsive, or accurate.\n\nLapses in medical and nursing care can, and have had, fatal\n\nconsequences for Napa patients.  In February 2005, patient B.X.\n\ncomplained of breathing problems.  Although he used a nebulizer\n\nfor a history of breathing problems, his complaints were not\n\naddressed by staff.  He died sitting in his room and was\n\ndiscovered by a peer.  Because the State has denied us access to\n\nthe facility and its records in our investigation, we conclude\n\nthat staff's inattention to this patient's serious medical\n\ncomplaint was a cause of his death. \n\nThe following additional examples illustrate many systemic\n\nmedical, nursing, and psychiatric service deficiencies and\n\ndemonstrate Napa's substantial departure from generally accepted\n\nprofessional standard of care in these critical areas: \n\n•\t In May 2005, a patient who suffered a seizure while in the\n\ncafeteria choked to death.  In an inpatient hospital\n\nsetting, it is difficult to imagine why there was no staff\n\nperson with sufficient training available to avert a death\n\nby choking. \n\n•\t In March 2005, a patient waited more than 48 hours for an x-\n\nray and treatment for a broken arm.\n\n\n- 14 ­\n\n•\t In November 2004, the State's own surveyors cited Napa for\n\ndeficient nursing care involving a client with a history of\n\nsuicide attempts.  After being notified of the client's\n\nexpressed plan to harm himself, nursing failed to assess,\n\ndevelop a nursing care plan, or even document the incident. \n\nFive days later, the client attempted suicide. \n\n•\t A court-appointed psychologist testified that a forensic\n\npatient recommended by Napa's staff for conditional release\n\nhad been given the wrong psychiatric diagnosis and no\n\ntreatment for psychiatric conditions directly affecting his\n\nsuitability for release.\n\n•\t In 2003, a patient was forced to wait at least seven months\n\nfor surgical repair of his broken hip.\n\n•\t In November 2002, staff failed to observe whether or not\n\npatients take their medications, even when care plans\n\nrequired observation.  The State's own surveyors reported\n\nthat, on November 19, 2002, two individuals walked away\n\nafter they had received their medication without staff\n\nmembers observing whether they had taken the medication,\n\nincluding one individual who had admitted to selling his\n\nmedications to other patients.  Staff members observed by\n\nDHS on November 20, 2002, failed to crush and dissolve \n\nmedication for certain patients, as had been ordered by the\n\nphysician to ensure that patients were taking their\n\nmedications.\n\n•\t According to DHS observations in November 2002, staff failed\n\nto record the administration of medication in a timely\n\nmanner, resulting in the potential for medication error due\n\nto the lack of communication of medication administration to\n\nother medication-administering nurses on the unit.\n\n•\t On August 5, 2002, a patient attempted to commit suicide by\n\ntaking an overdose of approximately 3000 milligrams of\n\nmedication, when he was prescribed no more than\n\n310 milligrams of medication per day.\n\n•\t Based on its November 2002 review of records, the State's\n\nown surveyors reported that several patients failed to\n\nreceive critical dental treatment, despite poor dental\n\nhealth, including patients who had cavities, had lost\n\nseveral teeth prior to admission, or who were likely\n\ncandidates for extractions. \n\n\n- 15 ­\n\n•\t A review by the State's own surveyors of a sample of patient\n\nrecords dated July through October 2002, indicated that many\n\npatients had been prescribed numerous psychotropic\n\nmedications that have adverse interactions, yet there was no\n\nfollow-up to review or record these adverse effects.\n\n•\t Napa records dated September 30, 2002, indicated that one\n\npatient was prescribed multiple psychoactive medications and\n\ndoses of medication above the recommended maximum doses\n\nwithout any apparent justification.  He received 2700 mg a\n\nday of an anticonvulsant while the maximum recommended dose\n\nis 1800 mg a day; 700 mg a day of another anticonvulsant\n\nwhile the recommended maximum dose is 500 mg; 20 mg a day of\n\nan antipsychotic compared to the usual dosage range of 10 mg\n\na day; and 10 mg a day of another antipsychotic with a\n\nmaximum effective dose of 4-6 mg a day.  In addition, the\n\npatient received daily doses of an anti-depressant, an anti­\n\nanxiety and anticonvulsant medication, and another\n\nanticonvulsant.  These medications have numerous adverse\n\neffects and cumulative drug interactions, including\n\nagitation, insomnia, nervousness, hostility, dizziness,\n\nobjectionable behaviors, movement disorders, anxiety, gait\n\ndisturbances, lack of coordination, irritability,\n\nrestlessness, and slurred speech.  Records for this patient\n\ndemonstrated the presence of seizures, falls, hostility,\n\naggression, agitation, insomnia, restlessness, and\n\nunpredictable and objectionable behaviors.  There was no\n\nevidence of a system for recording symptoms in a way that \n\nwould allow the treatment team to differentiate between the\n\npatient’s symptoms of mental illness and symptoms of adverse\n\neffects of medication.\n\n•\t On the skilled nursing facility unit, staff have refused to\n\nassist patients to the restroom, forcing patients to spend\n\nup to 12 hours in soiled diapers.  Staff have taken up to\n\ntwo hours to respond to patients’ call lights, and bathed\n\npatients as infrequently as once every two to four weeks. \n\nObservers reported “a strong stench of urine and feces on\n\nthe unit.”\n\n2.\t Deficiencies in Provision of Occupational and\n\nPhysical Therapy and Dietary Supports and Services\n\nThe care provided at Napa to patients whose needs include\n\noccupational or physical therapy departs substantially from\n\n\n- 16 ­\n\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  Napa also\n\nconsistently fails to provide adequate nutritional services, a\n\nsubstantial departure from professionally accepted standards that\n\nmay cause serious health problems.  For example: \n\n•\t In a February 2005 survey, CMS identified two patients who\n\nrequired equipment such as portable oxygen and/or\n\nwheelchairs to attend programming; staff neither encouraged\n\nnor assisted the patients to use this equipment to attend\n\nprogramming but, instead, left the patients in bed in their\n\nrooms.\n\n•\t In November 2002, at least six patients' records were\n\nmissing observation data and information relevant to\n\nnecessary dietary supports and services.\n\n•\t In October 2002, CMS observed Napa staff incorrectly\n\nadminister gastrosomy tube feedings for five of six\n\npatients, and observed a patient with a care plan that\n\nincluded swallowing precautions being fed by staff that was\n\nnot trained and not familiar with the patient's plan. \n\nThe failure to provide physical, occupational, and\n\nnutritional supports and services to Napa patients may result in\n\na loss of mobility and independence, and can also lead to\n\npreventable medical complications. \n\nC.\t PSYCHOLOGY AND TREATMENT PLANNING\n\nThe State must also provide persons committed to psychiatric\n\nhospitals for an indefinite term with mental health treatment\n\nthat gives them a realistic opportunity to be cured and released. \n\nOregon Advocacy Ctr. v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101, 1121 (9th Cir. 2003)\n\n(citing Ohlinger v. Watson, 652 F.2d 775, 779 (9th Cir. 1980);\n\nSharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir. 2000) (same). \n\nMultiple independent sources, including regulatory agencies,\n\nindependent professionals, patients, and patient advocates,\n\ninform us that Napa fails to provide adequate treatment planning,\n\nand in particular, fails to plan adequately to address patients'\n\nassaultive and self-abusive behaviors.  In addition to the many\n\nexamples of Napa's failure to address assaultive and suicidal\n\nbehavior, discussed at §§ II.A.1 and 2, above, examples of\n\nfailures to treat include:\n\n\n- 17 ­\n\n•\t Napa failed to provide a current psychiatric assessment for\n\npatient M.E. since sometime before February 2004; this\n\npatient committed suicide on March 20, 2005.  CMS identified\n\nadditional patients without timely psychiatric evaluations,\n\nincluding one who had not been evaluated more than six\n\nmonths after admission, and another who had no psychiatric\n\nevaluation for more than two years.\n\n•\t Napa failed to intervene to address escalating violence by\n\npatient Q.R., including an assault on a peer that caused\n\ninjury requiring stitches, despite pleas from Q.R.'s family\n\nmembers to his treatment team.\n\n•\t Recent CMS surveys confirm that Napa fails to provide\n\nstructured therapies based on patients' treatment needs;\n\nfails to develop and document interventions based on\n\npatients' presenting needs; and fails to develop\n\ninterventions to be provided by a physician. \n\n•\t Staff do not encourage patients to attend their few\n\nscheduled treatment groups, and staff actions often disrupt\n\nthose groups.  One patient was left asleep in her bed at the\n\ntime of her scheduled treatment group with no staff\n\nencouraging her to participate. \n\n•\t Napa fails to provide adequate interpretative services to\n\nenable non-English-speaking patients to understand their\n\ntreatment.  One Vietnamese patient was observed to mumble\n\nand sing throughout his ward's community meeting, during\n\nwhich he was frequently \"shushed\" by the interpreter.  When\n\ninterviewed following the meeting, the patient stated he did\n\nnot understand what had occurred.  A second Vietnamese\n\npatient was not evaluated for suicide risk for more than six\n\nmonths because no interpreter was available.\n\n•\t A court-appointed psychologist testified that Napa staff\n\nfailed to address a patient's history of violent assault and\n\ninappropriate relationships with women, including Napa staff\n\nmembers.  Notwithstanding this failure to treat, Napa's\n\ndoctors recommended that this forensic patient be\n\nconditionally released to the community, which the court-\n\nappointed expert described as a complete lapse in\n\nprofessional judgment. \n\n•\t The State's regulatory agency reviewed patient records in\n\nlate 2002 and concluded that Napa fails to assess and plan\n\n\n- 18 ­\n\ninterventions for those patients with a history of\n\nassaultive behavior until after those patients have\n\nassaulted someone at the facility.\n\nD.\t DISCHARGE PLANNING AND PLACEMENT IN THE MOST INTEGRATED\n\nSETTING\n\nNapa fails to comply with the requirement of the ADA and its\n\nimplementing regulations that patients be placed in the most\n\nintegrated, appropriate setting consistent with the patient's\n\nneeds and the terms of any court-ordered confinement.  See\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12131, which states: \n\nno qualified individual with a disability shall, by\n\nreason of such disability, be excluded from\n\nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the\n\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity,\n\nor be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\n\nSee also ADA implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (“A\n\npublic entity shall administer services, programs, and activities\n\nin the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of\n\nqualified individuals with disabilities”); Olmstead v. L.C., \n\n527 U.S. 581 (1999); President George W. Bush’s New Freedom\n\nInitiative, “Community-Based Alternatives for Individuals with\n\nDisabilities,” Exec. Order No. 13217, 66 Fed. Reg. 33155 \n\n(June 18, 2001)(the President emphasized that unjustified\n\nisolation or segregation of qualified individuals with\n\ndisabilities in institutions is a form of prohibited\n\ndiscrimination, that the United States is committed to community-\n\nbased alternatives for individuals with disabilities, and that\n\nthe United States seeks to ensure that America’s community-based\n\nprograms effectively foster independence and participation in the\n\ncommunity for Americans with disabilities).\n\nWe have received credible allegations that patients who seek\n\nto be discharged into community placements are retaliated against\n\nby Napa staff.  According to a patient’s family member, a patient\n\nwas placed on psychotropic medication in late 2002 in retaliation\n\nfor writing letters to the court requesting a discharge hearing. \n\nThe prescribing doctor reportedly told him that he would not stop\n\ngiving him the medication until he stopped writing the letters. \n\nAnother patient alleged that she was retaliated against for\n\nhiring an attorney to seek her release.  She alleged that she\n\nreceived excessive dosages of medication and was awakened every\n\n\n- 19 ­\n\n30 minutes at night to deprive her of sleep, until she stopped\n\nseeking her release.  Two other sources stated that patients were\n\ngiven large doses of psychotropic drugs before any court\n\nappearance to inhibit their release from Napa.  In addition, in\n\nNovember 2001, a staff member alleged that when patients were\n\nready for discharge, supervisors instructed the medical staff to\n\nalter notations in patients’ records to indicate that patients\n\nwere not ready to be discharged. \n\nNapa also fails to provide sufficient substance abuse\n\nprograms to meet patient needs, even though these are a\n\nprerequisite to participation in the \"conditional release\"\n\nprogram.9  A patient’s failure to complete the program leads Napa\n\nto file a petition for an extension of time of commitment. \n\nFinally, multiple credible sources state that patients receive\n\nlittle or no treatment or interventions to prepare them for\n\ndischarge; discharge planning for patients is essentially \"do it\n\nyourself.\" \n\nIII. MINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES\n\nBecause the State has denied us timely access to Napa, we\n\nare not able to provide remedial measures with the same\n\nspecificity as we provided in our letters dated May 21, 2003 and\n\nFebruary 19, 2004, regarding Metropolitan State Hospital. \n\nHowever, because the deficiencies at Napa generally mirror the\n\ndeficiencies at Metropolitan, the specific remedies outlined in\n\nthe letters regarding Metropolitan are illustrative of those that\n\nshould be implemented at Napa.  To remedy the deficiencies\n\ndiscussed above and to protect the constitutional and federal\n\nstatutory rights of the patients at Napa, the State should, at a\n\nminimum, promptly implement the remedial measures set forth\n\nbelow.\n\nA.\t Protection From Harm\n\n1. \t To remedy deficiencies that result in excessive patient-on-\n\npatient assaults, patient suicides, and trafficking in\n\ncontraband, including illegal street drugs, the State must: \n\na.\t Ensure that Napa provide its patients with adequate,\n\nintegrated treatment planning consistent with generally\n\n9  In California, conditional release is similar to parole\n\nfor forensic patients. \n\n\n- 20 ­\n\naccepted professional standards of care.  In\n\nparticular, Napa should:\n\n(1)\t Develop and implement policies and procedures\n\nregarding the development of treatment plans\n\nconsistent with generally accepted standards of\n\ncare.\n\n(2)\t Revise treatment plans as appropriate, based on\n\nsignificant developments in patients' conditions,\n\nincluding patients' progress, or lack thereof, as\n\ndetermined by the scheduled monitoring of\n\nidentified criteria or target variables.\n\nb.\t Ensure Napa provides its patients with accurate,\n\ncomplete, and timely assessments, consistent with\n\ngenerally accepted professional standards of care;\n\nthese assessments should drive treatment interventions.\n\nc.\t Ensure that Napa reviews, revises, as appropriate, and\n\nimplements comprehensive, consistent incident\n\nmanagement policies and procedures consistent with\n\ngenerally accepted professional standards.

The Attorney General files this Complaint on behalf of the\n6 United States of America pursuant to the Civil Rights of\n7 Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997, to enjoin\n8 the named Defendants from egregiously and flagrantly\n9 depriving individuals housed in Metropolitan State Hospital\n10 (\"Metropolitan\") and Napa State Hospital (“Napa”) of rights,\n11 privileges, or immunities secured and protected by the\n12 Constitution and laws of the United States.\n13 Jurisdiction and Venue\n14 2. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C.\n15 §§ 1331 and 1345. \n16 3. The United States is authorized to initiate this action\n17 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997a.\n18 4. The Attorney General has certified that all pre-filing\n19 requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. § 1997b have been met. \n20 The Certificate of the Attorney General is appended to this\n21 Complaint and is incorporated herein. \n22 5. Venue in the Central District of California is proper\n23 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391.\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 - 2 -\n\n1 Intradistrict Assignment\n2 6. The events giving rise to the United States’ claims occurred\n3 in Napa and Los Angeles Counties.\n4 Defendants\n5 7. Defendant State of California owns and operates Metropolitan\n6 and Napa (collectively, the “Facilities”) and as such has\n7 responsibility for the services and supports provided to\n8 patients at the Facilities. \n9 8. Each of the Facilities is a State mental hospital.\n10 9. Defendant Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Governor of the State\n11 of California, and in that capacity, he has responsibility\n12 for the operation of the Facilities.\n13 10. Defendant Stephen W. Mayberg is the Director of the\n14 California Department of Mental Health, which has\n15 responsibility for overseeing the operations of the\n16 Facilities.\n17 11. Defendant Sharon Smith Nevins is the Executive Director of\n18 Metropolitan.\n19 12. Defendant Dave Graziani is the Executive Director of Napa.\n20 13. The individual Defendants named in paragraphs 9 through 12\n21 are officers of the State of California and are sued in\n22 their official capacity only.\n23 Factual Allegations\n24 14. Defendants are legally responsible, in whole or in part, for\n25 the operation of the Facilities and for the health and\n26 safety of the persons residing in the Facilities.\n27\n28 - 3 -\n\n1 15. The Facilities are institutions within the meaning of \n2 42 U.S.C. § 1997(1).  The Facilities provide care to\n3 psychiatric patients committed civilly or in connection with\n4 criminal proceedings.   \n5 16. Defendants are obligated to operate these Facilities in a\n6 manner that does not infringe upon the federal rights, as\n7 protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of\n8 the United States and by other federal law, of individuals\n9 confined to the Facilities.\n10 17. Defendants are obligated to provide treatment, supports, and\n11 services to individuals confined to the Facilities\n12 consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act and\n13 implementing regulations.  42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., \n14 28 C.F.R. Part 35. \n15 18. At all relevant times, Defendants have acted or failed to\n16 act, as alleged herein, under color of state law.  \n17 19. Individuals are confined to, or reside at, the Facilities\n18 because they have been determined by Defendants to have\n19 significant mental illness requiring extensive intervention\n20 and treatment.\n21 20. The Facilities’ supports and services substantially depart\n22 from generally accepted professional standards of care,\n23 thereby exposing the individuals confined or residing there\n24 to significant risk, and in some cases, to actual harm. \n25 21. The Facilities’ supports and services substantially depart\n26 from generally accepted professional standards of care in\n27\n28 - 4 -\n\n1 the following specific respects, among others:\n2 a. the provision of adequate treatment planning;\n3 b. the provision of adequate assessments and\n4 diagnoses;\n5 c. the provision of adequate psychiatric services;\n6 d. the provision of adequate psychological services;\n7 e. the provision of adequate nursing services;\n8 f. the provision of adequate rehabilitation therapy\n9 services;\n10 g. the provision of adequate nutritional services;\n11 h. the provision of adequate pharmacy services;\n12 i. the provision of adequate general medical\n13 services;\n14 j. the provision of adequate infection control\n15 services;\n16 k. the provision of adequate dental services; and\n17 l. the provision of adequate protections from harm.\n18 22. Defendants have failed and continue to fail to assess\n19 individuals residing in the Facilities to ascertain whether\n20 these individuals are, within the confines of any court-\n21 ordered confinement, receiving adequate treatment, supports,\n22 and services in the most integrated setting appropriate to\n23 their individual needs; that those individuals whom\n24 professionals determine should be placed in community\n25 programs are placed in such programs, when appropriate; and\n26 that these individuals are served in the most integrated\n27 setting appropriate to their needs.\n28  \n- 5 -\n\n1 Violations Alleged\n2 COUNT ONE:\n3 Violations of the Due Process Protections of the Fourteenth \n4 Amendment to the United States Constitution\n5 23. The United States incorporates by reference the allegations\n6 set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 22 as if fully set forth\n7 herein.\n8 24. The egregious and flagrant acts and omissions alleged in\n9 paragraphs 20 and 21 constitute a pattern or practice that\n10 violates the federal rights, as protected by the Fourteenth\n11 Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and by\n12 other federal law, of individuals confined to the\n13 Facilities.\n14 25. Unless restrained by this Court, Defendants will continue to\n15 engage in the egregious and flagrant acts and omissions set\n16 forth in paragraphs 20 and 21 that deprive the Facilities’\n17 residents of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or\n18 protected by the Constitution of the United States and\n19 federal law, and will cause irreparable harm to these\n20 residents.\n21 COUNT TWO:\n22 Violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act\n23 26. The United States incorporates by reference the allegations\n24 set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 22 as if fully set forth\n25 herein.\n26 27. The egregious and flagrant acts and omissions alleged in\n27 paragraph 22 violate the Americans with Disabilities Act and\n28\n- 6 -\n\n1 implementing regulations.  42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., \n2 28 C.F.R. Part 35.\n3 28. Unless restrained by this Court, Defendants will continue to\n4 engage in the egregious and flagrant acts and omissions set\n5 forth in paragraph 22 that deprive the Facilities’ residents\n6 of rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by\n7 federal law, and will cause irreparable harm to these\n8 residents.\n9 PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n10 29. The Attorney General is authorized under 42 U.S.C. § 1997 to\n11 seek equitable and declaratory relief.\n12 WHEREFORE, the United States prays that this Court enter an\n13 order:\n14 a.  Declaring that the acts, omissions, and practices of\n15 Defendants set forth in paragraphs 20-22 above\n16 constitute a pattern or practice of resistance to the\n17 residents' of the Facilities full enjoyment of rights,\n18 privileges or immunities secured or protected by the\n19 Constitution or laws of the United States, and that\n20 those acts, omissions and practices violate the\n21 Constitution and laws of the United States; and \n22 b.  Permanently enjoining Defendants, their officers,\n23 agents, employees, subordinates, successors in office,\n24 and all those acting in concert or participation with\n25 them, from continuing the acts, omissions, and\n26 practices set forth in paragraphs 20-22 above, and that\n27 this Court require Defendants to take such actions as\n28\n- 7 -\n\n1 will ensure lawful conditions of institutionalization\n2 are afforded to residents of the Facilities; and\n3 c.  Granting such other and further equitable relief as the\n4 Court may deem just and proper.\n5\n6     Respectfully submitted,\n7     ____________________________________\n    THE HONORABLE ALBERTO R.

Unless otherwise specified, implementation \n6 of each provision of this Plan shall begin no later than 12 \n7 months after the Effective Date. \n8 2.\t Consistent With Generally Accepted Professional \n9 Standards of Care \n10 A decision by a qualified professional that is \n11 substantially aligned with contemporary, accepted \n12 professional judgment, practice, or standards as to \n13 demonstrate that the person responsible based the decision \n14 on such accepted professional judgment. \n15 B.\t Introduction \n16 Each State Hospital shall use a Recovery philosophy of care \n17 and a Psychiatric Rehabilitation model of service delivery. \n18 Therapeutic and rehabilitative services provided by each State \n19 Hospital shall be based on evidence-based practices and \n20 practice-based evidence, shall be age-appropriate, and shall be \n21 designed to:  strengthen and support individuals' recovery, \n22 rehabilitation, and habilitation; enable individuals to grow and \n23 develop in ways benefitting their mental health, physical health, \n24 and well being; and ensure individuals' reasonable safety, \n25 security, and freedom from undue bodily restraint.  Relationships \n26 between each State Hospital’s staff and the individuals whom they \n27 serve shall be positive, therapeutic, and respectful. \n28\n5\n\n\n1 Each individual served by each State Hospital shall be \n2 encouraged to participate in identifying his or her needs and \n3 goals, and in selecting appropriate treatment options. \n4 Therapeutic and rehabilitation services shall be designed to \n5 address each individual's needs and to assist individuals in \n6 meeting their specific recovery and wellness goals, consistent \n7 with generally accepted professional standards of care.  Each \n8 State Hospital shall ensure clinical and administrative \n9 oversight, education, and support of its staff in planning and \n10 providing care and treatment consistent with these standards. \n11 C.  Integrated Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Services Planning \n12 Each State Hospital shall provide coordinated, \n13 comprehensive, individualized protections, services, supports, \n14 and treatments (collectively \"therapeutic and rehabilitation \n15 services\") for the individuals it serves, consistent with \n16 generally accepted professional standards of care.  In addition \n17 to implementing the therapeutic and rehabilitation planning \n18 provisions set forth below, each State Hospital shall establish \n19 and implement standards, policies, and practices to ensure that \n20 therapeutic and rehabilitation service determinations are \n21 consistently made by an interdisciplinary team through integrated \n22 therapeutic and rehabilitation service planning and embodied in a \n23 single, integrated therapeutic and rehabilitation service plan. \n24 1.  Interdisciplinary Teams \n25 The interdisciplinary team's membership shall be \n26 dictated by the particular needs and strengths of the \n27 individual in the team's care.  At a minimum, each State \n28\n6\n\n\n1 Hospital shall ensure that the team shall: \n2 a.  Have as its primary objective the provision of \n3 individualized, integrated therapeutic and \n4 rehabilitation services that optimize the \n5 individual's recovery and ability to sustain \n6 himself/herself in the most integrated, \n7 appropriate setting based on the individual's \n8 strengths and functional and legal status and \n9 support the individual's ability to exercise \n10 his/her liberty interests, including the interests \n11 of self determination and independence; \n12 b.  Be led by a clinical professional who is involved \n13 in the care of the individual; \n14 c.  Function in an interdisciplinary fashion; \n15 d.  Assume primary responsibility for the individual's \n16 therapeutic and rehabilitation services, and \n17 ensure the provision of competent, necessary, and \n18 appropriate psychiatric and medical care; \n19 e.  Ensure that each member of the team participates \n20 appropriately, by competently and knowledgeably \n21 assessing the individual on an ongoing basis and \n22 by developing, monitoring, and, as necessary, \n23 revising the therapeutic and rehabilitation \n24 services; \n25 f.  Ensure that assessment results and, as clinically \n26 relevant, consultation results, are communicated \n27 to the team members, along with the implications \n28\n7\n\n\n1 of those results for diagnosis, therapy and \n2 rehabilitation by no later than the next review; \n3 g.  Be responsible for the scheduling and coordination \n4 of assessments and team meetings, the drafting of \n5 integrated treatment plans, and the scheduling and \n6 coordination of necessary progress reviews; \n7 h.  Consist of a stable core of members, including at \n8 least the individual served; the treating \n9 psychiatrist; the treating psychologist; the \n10 treating rehabilitation therapist; the treating \n11 social worker; the registered nurse and \n12 psychiatric technician who know the individual \n13 best; one of the individual's teachers (for \n14 school-age individuals); and, as appropriate, the \n15 individual's family, guardian, advocates, \n16 attorneys, and the pharmacist and other staff; \n17 i.  Not include any core treatment team members with a \n18 case load exceeding 1:15 in admission teams (new \n19 admissions of 90 days or less) and, on average, \n20 1:25 in all other teams at any point in time; and \n21 j.  Not include staff that is not verifiably competent \n22 in the development and implementation of \n23 interdisciplinary treatment plans. \n24 2.\t Integrated Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Service \n25 Planning. \n26 Each State Hospital shall develop and implement \n27 policies and protocols regarding the development of \n28 therapeutic and rehabilitation service plans, referred to as \n8\n\n\n1 \"Wellness and Recovery Plans\" (\"WRP\") consistent with \n2 generally accepted professional standards of care, to ensure \n3 that: \n4 a.\t Individuals have substantive input into the \n5 therapeutic and rehabilitation service planning \n6 process, including but not limited to input as to \n7 mall groups and therapies appropriate to their \n8 WRP. \n9 b.\t Therapeutic and rehabilitation service planning \n10 provides timely attention to the needs of each \n11 individual, in particular: \n12 i.\t initial therapeutic and rehabilitation \n13 service plans (Admission Wellness and \n14 Recovery Plan (\"A-WRP\")) are completed within \n15 24 hours of admission; \n16 ii.\t master therapeutic and rehabilitation service \n17 plans (WRP) are completed within 7 days of \n18 admission; and \n19 iii. therapeutic and rehabilitation service plan \n20 reviews are performed every 14 days during \n21 the first 60 days of hospitalization and \n22 every 30 days thereafter.  The third monthly \n23 review is a quarterly review and the 12th \n24 monthly review is the annual review. \n25 c.\t Treatment, rehabilitation, and enrichment services \n26 are goal-directed, individualized, and informed by \n27 a thorough knowledge of the individual's \n28\n9\n\n\n1 psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial history and \n2 previous response to such services. \n3 d.\t Therapeutic and rehabilitation service planning is \n4 based on a comprehensive case formulation for each \n5 individual that emanates from interdisciplinary \n6 assessments of the individual consistent with \n7 generally accepted professional standards of care. \n8 Specifically, the case formulation shall: \n9 i.\t be derived from analyses of the information \n10 gathered from interdisciplinary assessments, \n11 including diagnosis and differential \n12 diagnosis; \n13 ii.\t include a review of:  pertinent history; \n14 predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating \n15 factors; previous treatment history; and \n16 present status; \n17 iii. consider biomedical, psychosocial, and \n18 psychoeducational factors, as clinically \n19 appropriate, for each category in § C.2.d.ii \n20 above; \n21 iv.\t consider such factors as age, gender, \n22 culture, treatment adherence, and medication \n23 issues that may affect the outcomes of \n24 treatment and rehabilitation interventions; \n25 v.\t support the diagnosis by diagnostic \n26 formulation, differential diagnosis, and \n27 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV-TR (or \n28 the most current edition) checklists; and \n10 \n\n1 vi.\t enable the interdisciplinary team to reach \n2 sound determinations about each individual's \n3 treatment, rehabilitation, enrichment and \n4 wellness needs, the type of setting to which \n5 the individual should be discharged, and the \n6 changes that will be necessary to achieve \n7 discharge. \n8 e.\t The therapeutic and rehabilitation service plan \n9 specifies the individual's focus of \n10 hospitalization (goals), assessed needs \n11 (objectives), and how the staff will assist the \n12 individual to achieve his or her goals/objectives \n13 (interventions). \n14 f.\t Therapeutic and rehabilitation service planning is \n15 driven by individualized needs, is strengths-based \n16 (i.e., builds on an individual's current \n17 strengths), addresses the individual's motivation \n18 for engaging in wellness activities, and leads to \n19 improvement in the individual's mental health, \n20 physical health, and well being, consistent with \n21 generally accepted professional standards of care. \n22 Specifically, the interdisciplinary team shall: \n23 i.\t develop and prioritize reasonable and \n24 attainable goals/objectives (e.g., at the \n25 level of each individual's functioning) that \n26 build on the individual's strengths and \n27 address the individual's identified needs \n28\n11\n\n\n1 and, if any identified need is not addressed, \n2 provide a rationale for not addressing the \n3 need; \n4 ii.\t ensure that the objectives/interventions \n5 address treatment (e.g., for a disease or \n6 disorder), rehabilitation (e.g., \n7 skills/supports, motivation and readiness), \n8 and enrichment (e.g., quality of life \n9 activities); \n10 iii. write the objectives in behavioral,\n\n11 observable, and/or measurable terms;\n\n12 iv.\t include all objectives from the individual's \n13 current stage of change, or readiness for \n14 rehabilitation, to the maintenance stage for \n15 each focus of hospitalization, as clinically \n16 appropriate; \n17 v.\t ensure that there are interventions that \n18 relate to each objective, specifying who will \n19 do what, within what time frame, to assist \n20 the individual to meet his/her needs as \n21 specified in the objective; \n22 vi.\t implement interventions appropriately \n23 throughout the individual's day, with a \n24 minimum of 20 hours of active treatment per \n25 week.  Individual or group therapy included \n26 in the individual’s WRP shall be provided as \n27 part of the 20 hours of active treatment per \n28 week; \n12 \n\n1 vii.\t maximize, consistent with the individual's \n2 treatment needs and legal status, \n3 opportunities for treatment, programming, \n4 schooling, and other activities in the most \n5 appropriate integrated, non-institutional \n6 settings, as clinically appropriate; and \n7 viii. ensure that each therapeutic and \n8 rehabilitation service plan integrates and \n9 coordinates all services, supports, and \n10 treatments provided by or through the State \n11 Hospital for the individual in a manner \n12 specifically responsive to the plan's \n13 therapeutic and rehabilitation goals.  This \n14 requirement includes, but is not limited to, \n15 ensuring that individuals are assigned to \n16 mall groups that link directly to the \n17 objectives of the individual’s treatment plan \n18 and needs; \n19 g.  Therapeutic and rehabilitation service plans are \n20 revised as appropriate to ensure that planning is \n21 based on the individual's progress, or lack \n22 thereof, as determined by the scheduled monitoring \n23 of identified criteria or target variables, \n24 consistent with generally accepted professional \n25 standards of care.  Specifically, the \n26 interdisciplinary team shall: \n27 i.\t revise the focus of hospitalization \n28 objectives, as needed, to reflect the \n13 \n\n1 individual's changing needs and develop new \n2 interventions to facilitate attainment of new \n3 objectives when old objectives are achieved \n4 or when the individual fails to make progress \n5 toward achieving these objectives; \n6 ii.\t review the focus of hospitalization, needs, \n7 objectives, and interventions more frequently \n8 if there are changes in the individual's \n9 functional status or risk factors (i.e., \n10 behavioral, medical, and/or psychiatric risk \n11 factors); \n12 iii.\t ensure that the review process includes an \n13 assessment of progress related to discharge \n14 to the most integrated setting appropriate to \n15 meet the individual's assessed needs, \n16 consistent with his/her legal status; and \n17 iv.\t base progress reviews and revision\n\n18 recommendations on data collected as \n\n19 specified in the therapeutic and\n\n20 rehabilitation service plan.\n\n21 h.\t Individuals in need of positive behavior supports \n22 in school or other settings receive such supports \n23 consistent with generally accepted professional \n24 standards of care. \n25 i.\t Adequate active psychosocial rehabilitation is \n26 provided, consistent with generally accepted \n27\n28\n14\n\n\n1 professional standards of care, that: \n2 i.  is based on the individual's assessed needs \n3 and is directed toward increasing the \n4 individual's ability to engage in more \n5 independent life functions; \n6 ii.  has documented objectives, measurable \n7 outcomes, and standardized methodology; \n8 iii.  is aligned with the individual's objectives \n9 that are identified in the individual's WRP; \n10 iv.  utilizes the individual's strengths, \n11 preferences, and interests; \n12 v.  focuses on the individual's vulnerabilities \n13 to mental illness, substance abuse, and \n14 readmission due to relapse, where \n15 appropriate; \n16 vi.  is provided in a manner consistent with each \n17 individual's cognitive strengths and \n18 limitations; \n19 vii.  provides progress reports for review by the \n20 Interdisciplinary Team as part of the WRP \n21 review process; \n22 viii. is provided 5 days a week, for a minimum of 4 \n23 hours a day (i.e., 2 hours in the morning and \n24 2 hours in the afternoon each weekday), for \n25 each individual or 2 hours a day when the \n26 individual is in school, except days falling \n27 on state holidays; \n28\n15 \n\n1 ix.  is provided to individuals in bed-bound \n2 status in a manner and for a period that is \n3 commensurate with their medical status; \n4 x.  routinely takes place as scheduled; \n5 xi.  includes, in the evenings and weekends, \n6 additional activities that enhance the \n7 individual's quality of life; and \n8 xii.  is consistently reinforced by staff on the \n9 therapeutic milieu, including living units. \n10 j.  Adequate individualized and group exercise and \n11 recreational options are provided, consistent with \n12 generally accepted professional standards of care. \n13 k.\t Individuals who have an assessed need for family \n14 therapy services receive such services in their \n15 primary language, as feasible, consistent with \n16 generally accepted professional standards of care \n17 and that these services, and their effectiveness \n18 for addressing the indicated problem, are \n19 comprehensively documented in each individual's \n20 chart. \n21 l.\t Each individual's therapeutic and rehabilitation \n22 service plan identifies general medical diagnoses, \n23 the treatments to be employed, the related symptoms \n24 to be monitored by nursing staff (i.e., registered \n25 nurses (\"RNs\"), licensed vocational nurses \n26 (\"LVNs\"), and psychiatric technicians) and the \n27 means and frequency by which such staff shall \n28\n16\n\n\n1 monitor such symptoms, consistent with generally \n2 accepted professional standards of care. \n3 m.  Children and adolescents receive, consistent with \n4 generally accepted professional standards of care: \n5 i.  therapy relating to traumatic family and \n6 other traumatic experiences, as clinically \n7 indicated; and \n8 ii.  reasonable, clinically appropriate \n9 opportunities to involve their families in \n10 treatment and treatment decisions. \n11 n.  Policies and procedures are developed and \n12 implemented consistent with generally accepted \n13 professional standards of care to ensure \n14 appropriate screening for substance abuse, as \n15 clinically indicated. \n16 o.  Individuals who require treatment for substance \n17 abuse are provided appropriate therapeutic and \n18 rehabilitation services consistent with generally \n19 accepted professional standards of care. \n20 p.  Group facilitators and therapists providing \n21 therapeutic and rehabilitation services (in groups \n22 or individual therapy) are verifiably competent \n23 regarding selection and implementation of \n24 appropriate approaches and interventions to address \n25 therapeutic and rehabilitation service objectives, \n26 are verifiably competent in monitoring individuals' \n27 responses to therapy and rehabilitation, and \n28 receive regular, competent supervision. \n17 \n\n1 q.  Group facilitators and therapists providing \n2 therapeutic and rehabilitation services in the \n3 field of substance abuse should be certified \n4 substance abuse counselors. \n5 r.  Transportation and staffing issues do not preclude \n6 individuals from attending appointments. \n7 s.  Adequate oversight to treatment, rehabilitation, \n8 and enrichment groups is provided to ensure that \n9 individuals are assigned to groups that are \n10 appropriate to their assessed needs, that groups \n11 are provided consistently and with appropriate \n12 frequency, and that issues particularly relevant \n13 for this population, including the use of \n14 psychotropic medications and substance abuse, are \n15 appropriately addressed, consistent with generally \n16 accepted professional standards of care. \n17 t.  Treatment, rehabilitation, and enrichment services \n18 are monitored appropriately against rational, \n19 operationally-defined target variables and revised \n20 as appropriate in light of significant \n21 developments, and the individual's progress, or \n22 lack thereof. \n23 u.  Individuals are educated regarding the purposes of \n24 their treatment, rehabilitation, and enrichment \n25 services.  They will be provided a copy of their \n26 WRP when appropriate based on clinical judgment. \n27 v.  Staff educate individuals about their medications, \n28 the expected results, and the potential common \n18\n\n\n1 and/or serious side effects of medications, and \n2 staff regularly ask individuals about common and/or \n3 serious side effects they may experience. \n4 w.\t Interdisciplinary teams review, assess, and develop \n5 positive clinical strategies to overcome \n6 individual's barriers to participation in \n7 therapeutic and rehabilitation services. \n8 D.  Integrated Assessments \n9 Each State Hospital shall ensure that, consistent with \n10 generally accepted professional standards of care, each \n11 individual shall receive, promptly after admission to the State \n12 Hospital, an accurate and comprehensive assessment of the \n13 conditions responsible for the individual's admission, to the \n14 degree possible given the obtainable information at the time of \n15 admission.  Thereafter, each individual shall receive an accurate \n16 and comprehensive reassessment of the reasons for the \n17 individual's continued hospitalization whenever there has been a \n18 significant change in the individual's status, or a lack of \n19 expected improvement resulting from clinically indicated \n20 treatment.  The individual's interdisciplinary team shall be \n21 responsible for investigating the past and present medical, \n22 nursing, psychiatric, and psychosocial factors bearing on the \n23 individual's condition, and, when necessary, for revising \n24 assessments and therapeutic and rehabilitation plans in \n25 accordance with new information that comes to light.  Each State \n26 Hospital shall monitor and promptly address deficiencies in the \n27 quality and timeliness of such assessments. \n28\n19\n\n\n1 1.  Psychiatric Assessments and Diagnoses \n2 Each State Hospital shall provide all of the \n3 individuals it serves with routine and emergency psychiatric \n4 assessments and reassessments consistent with generally \n5 accepted professional standards of care; and: \n6 a.\t Each State Hospital shall use the diagnostic \n7 criteria in the most current Diagnostic and \n8 Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"DSM\") for \n9 reaching the most accurate psychiatric diagnoses. \n10 b.\t Each State Hospital shall ensure that all \n11 psychiatrists responsible for performing or \n12 reviewing psychiatric assessments: \n13 i.\t are certified by the American Board of \n14 Psychiatry and Neurology (\"ABPN\") or have \n15 successfully completed at least three years \n16 of psychiatric residency training in a \n17 Accreditation Counsel for Graduate Medical \n18 Education accredited program; and \n19 ii.\t are verifiably competent (as defined by \n20 privileging at initial appointment and \n21 thereafter by reprivileging for continued \n22 appointment) in performing psychiatric \n23 assessments consistent with the State \n24 Hospital's standard diagnostic protocols. \n25 c.\t Each State Hospital shall ensure that: \n26 i.\t within 24 hours of an individual's admission \n27 to the State Hospital, the individual \n28\n20 \n\n1 receives an Admission Medical Assessment that\n\n2 includes:\n\n3 1)  a review of systems;\n\n4 2)  medical history;\n\n5 3)  physical examination;\n\n6 4)  diagnostic impressions; and\n\n7 5)  management of acute medical conditions.\n\n8 ii.\t within 24 hours of an individual's admission \n9 to the State Hospital, the individual \n10 receives an Admission Psychiatric Evaluation \n11 that includes: \n12 1)  psychiatric history, including a review \n13 of presenting symptoms; \n14 2)  complete mental status examination; \n15 3)  admission diagnoses; \n16 4)  completed AIMS; \n17 5)  laboratory tests ordered; and \n18 6)  consultations ordered. \n19 iii.\t Within 7 days of an individual's admission to \n20 the State Hospital, the individual receives \n21 an Integrated Psychiatric Assessment that \n22 includes: \n23 1)  psychiatric history, including a review \n24 of present and past history; \n25 2)  psychosocial history; \n26 3)  mental status examination; \n27 4)  strengths; \n28 5)  psychiatric risk factors; \n21 \n\n1 6)  diagnostic formulation;\n\n2 7)  differential diagnosis;\n\n3 8)  current psychiatric diagnoses;\n\n4 9)  psychopharmacology treatment plan; and\n\n5 10)  management of identified risks.\n\n6 d.\t Each State Hospital shall ensure that: \n7 i.\t clinically justifiable diagnoses are provided \n8 for each individual, and all diagnoses that \n9 cannot be clinically justified for an \n10 individual are discontinued no later than the \n11 next review; \n12 ii.\t the documented justification of the diagnoses \n13 is in accord with the criteria contained in \n14 the most current DSM (as per DSM-IV-TR \n15 Checklist); \n16 iii.\t differential diagnoses, \"deferred,\" or \n17 \"rule-out\" diagnoses, and diagnoses listed as \n18 \"NOS\" (\"Not Otherwise Specified\") are timely \n19 addressed (i.e., within 60 days), through \n20 clinically appropriate assessments, and \n21 resolved in a clinically justifiable manner; \n22 and \n23 iv.\t \"no diagnosis\" is clinically justified and \n24 documented. \n25 e.\t Each State Hospital shall ensure that psychiatric \n26 reassessments are conducted at a frequency that \n27 reflects the individual's clinical needs.

Environmental Conditions \n10 Each State Hospital shall develop and implement a \n11 system to review regularly all units and areas of the \n12 hospital to which individuals being served have access to \n13 identify any potential environmental safety hazards and to \n14 develop and implement a plan to remedy any identified \n15 issues, consistent with generally accepted professional \n16 standards of care.  Such a system shall require that: \n17 a.\t Potential suicide hazards are identified and \n18 prioritized for systematic corrective action, and \n19 that such action is implemented on a priority basis \n20 as promptly as feasible; \n21 b.\t All areas of the hospital that are occupied by \n22 individuals being served have adequate temperature \n23 control and deviations shall be promptly corrected; \n24 c.\t Each State Hospital reviews, revises, as \n25 appropriate, and implements procedures and \n26 practices so that individuals who are incontinent \n27 are assisted to change in a timely manner; \n28\n74\n\n\n1 d.\t Each State Hospital thoroughly reviews and revises, \n2 as appropriate, its policy and practice regarding \n3 sexual contact among individuals served at the \n4 hospital.  Each State Hospital shall establish \n5 clear guidelines regarding staff response to \n6 reports of sexual contact and monitor staff \n7 response to incidents.  Each State Hospital \n8 documents comprehensively therapeutic interventions \n9 in the individual’s charts in response to instances \n10 of sexual contact; \n11 e.\t Each State Hospital develops and implements clear \n12 guidelines stating the circumstances under which it \n13 is appropriate to utilize staff who are not trained \n14 to provide mental health services in addressing \n15 incidents involving individuals.  Each State \n16 Hospital ensures that persons who are likely to \n17 intervene in incidents are properly trained to work \n18 with individuals with mental health concerns; and \n19 f.\t Metropolitan State Hospital will institute roving \n20 patrols of treatment units, except for the skilled \n21 nursing facility, by Hospital Police Officers on a \n22 schedule and frequency to be determined by the \n23 hospital administration. \n24 J.  First Amendment and Due Process \n25 Each State Hospital unconditionally permits individuals to \n26 exercise their constitutional rights of free speech, including \n27 the right to petition the government for redress of grievances \n28 without state monitoring and provides them due process. \n75\n\n\n1\n2 ENHANCEMENT PLAN - APPENDIX A\n\n3\n4 Trigger  Thresholds \n5\n6\n1.1  Any aggression to self resulting \n7\nAggressive Act to Self  in major injury* \n8\n1.2  2 or more aggressive acts to self \n9\nin 7 consecutive days \n10\n1.3  4 or more aggressive acts to self \n11\nin 30 consecutive days \n12\n13\n14 2.1  Any peer-to-peer aggression \n15 Aggressive Act to Others  resulting in major injury \n16 2.2  Any aggression to staff resulting \n17 in major injury \n18 2.3  2 or more aggressive acts to \n19 others in 7 consecutive days \n20 2.4  4 or more aggressive acts to \n21 others in 30 \n22\n23\nAlleged Abuse/  3.1  Any alleged \n24\nNeglect/Exploitation  abuse/neglect/exploitation if \n25\nminor** or major injury \n26\n27\n28\n76\n\n\n1\n2 Body Weight  4.1 \t Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 or \n3 less (underweight) \n4 4.2 \t Body Mass Index (BMI) between 25 \n5 and 29.9  (overweight) \n6 4.3\t Body Mass Index (BMI) between 30 \n7 and 34.9  (Obesity-Grade I) \n8 4.4\t Body Mass Index (BMI) between 35 \n9 and 39.9  (Obesity-Grade II) \n10 4.5 \t Body Mass Index (BMI) 40 or above \n11 (Obesity-Grade III) \n12 4.6 \t Weight Change ± 5% in 1 month \n13 4.7 \t Weight Change ± 7.5% in 3 months \n14 4.8\t Weight Change ± 10% in 6 months \n15 4.9\t Waist Circumference over 35” for \n16 females or over 40” for males \n17\n18\nCombined Pharmacotherapy 5.1\t More than 2 intra-class \n19\npsychotropic medications for \n20\npsychiatric reasons \n21\n5.2\t More than 3 inter-class \n22\npsychotropic medications for \n23\npsychiatric reasons \n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n77\n\n\n1\n2 Escape/AWOL  6.1  Any escape attempt/unauthorized \n3 absence within facility \n4 6.2  Any escape \n5 attempt/unauthorized absence \n6 outside of facility \n7\n8\nFalls  7.1  Any fall resulting in major \n9\ninjury \n10\n7.2  Three or more falls in 30 \n11\nconsecutive days \n12\n13\nIllicit Substances  8.1  Any incident of an individual \n14\ntesting positive for illicit \n15\nsubstance (street drug) use \n16\n17\n18\nMedication Variance  9.1  Any medication error that results \n19\n(Error)  in major injury or exacerbation \n20\nof a disease or disorder (i.e., \n21\nprescribing, transcribing, \n22\nordering/procurement, \n23\ndispensing/storage, \n24\nadministration, and \n25\ndocumentation) \n26\n27\n28\n78 \n\n1\n2 Mortality  10.1 Expected deaths \n3 10.2 Unexpected deaths \n4\n5\nNon-Adherence to  11.1 Non-adherence to WRP for more \n6\nWellness and Recovery  than 20% of the interventions in \n7\nPlan (WRP)  7 consecutive days (Note: For \n8\nchildren and adolescents: include \n9\nnon-attendance at school for more \n10\nthan 20% of the time in 7 \n11\nconsecutive days) \n12\n13\n14 One-to-One Observations  12.1 1:1 for psychiatric/behavioral \n15 reasons over 24 hours in 7 \n16 consecutive days \n17 12.2 Any 2:1 for \n18 psychiatric/behavioral reasons \n19\n20\nPRN Medications  13.1 2 PRNs in 24 hours (for \n21\npsychiatric/behavioral reasons) \n22\n13.2 3 PRNs in 7 consecutive days \n23\n13.3 15 PRNs in 30 consecutive days \n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n79\n\n\n1\n2 Restraint  14.1 Restraint for more than 4 hours \n3 for adults (Note: more than 4 \n4 hours for adolescents and 2 hours \n5 for  children) \n6 14.2 More than 3 episodes of restraint \n7 in 7 consecutive days \n8 14.3 More than 5 episodes of restraint \n9 in 30 consecutive days \n10\n11\nSeclusion  15.1 Seclusion for more than 4 hours \n12\nfor adults (Note: more than 4 \n13\nhours for adolescents and 2 hours \n14\nfor  children) \n15\n15.2 More than 3 episodes of seclusion \n16\nin 7 consecutive days \n17\n15.3 More than 5 episodes of seclusion \n18\nin 30 consecutive days \n19\n20\n21 Stat Medications  16.1 2 Stat medications in 24 hours \n22 16.2 3 Stat medications in 7 \n23 consecutive days \n24 16.3 15 Stat med in 30 consecutive \n25 days \n26\n27\n28\n80\n\n\n1\n2 Suicide Attempt  17.1 Any suicide attempt \n3 17.2 Any suicide threat or ideations \n4\n5 *  A major injury is an injury that requires treatment of more \n6 than basic first aid by medical personnel or any injury resulting \n7 from alleged or suspected abuse or any injury judged to have \n8 potential for serious harm. \n9 ** A minor injury is any injury, other than an injury caused by \n10 alleged or suspected abuse, that requires no treatment or only \n11 minor first aid and for which the potential for serious harm is \n12 judged to have been remote. \n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n81\n\n\n1 PART II\n\n2 ENFORCEMENT\n\n3 A.  Selection of Monitor \n4 Mohamed El-Sabaawi, M.D. shall be appointed as the expert to \n5 monitor the State's implementation of this Agreement (the \n6 \"Monitor\").  The Monitor shall have full authority to assess, \n7 review, and report independently on the Defendants' \n8 implementation of and compliance with the provisions of the \n9 Agreement.  No Party, nor any employee or agent of any Party, \n10 shall have any supervisory authority over the Monitor's \n11 activities, reports, findings, or recommendations.  In the event \n12 that Dr. El-Sabaawi is unable to serve or continue serving as the \n13 Monitor, or in the event that the Parties for any reason agree to \n14 discontinue the use of Dr. El-Sabaawi, the Parties shall meet or \n15 otherwise confer within thirty (30) days of being notified of the \n16 incapacity or the decision to discontinue use of Dr. El-Sabaawi \n17 to select a new Monitor.  If the Parties are unable to agree upon \n18 a selection, each Party shall submit two names, along with \n19 resumes or curricula vitae and cost proposals, to the Court and \n20 the Court shall appoint the Monitor from among the names \n21 submitted.  The procedure described in this paragraph shall apply \n22 to all successor Monitors.  The Parties agree that the Monitor \n23 may use consultants to assist the Monitor.  Any such consultants \n24 shall be paid for time, services, and expenses pursuant to the \n25 Monitor’s existing budget.  In collaboration with the Monitor, \n26 the Parties shall meet or otherwise confer whenever necessary to \n27 agree upon which particular consultant(s) the Monitor shall use \n28 to assist the Monitor in his duties as Monitor. \n82\n\n\n1 B.\t Budget of the Monitor \n2 The Parties and the Monitor have agreed upon the annual \n3 budget for the Monitor's work. \n4 C.\t Reimbursement and Payment Provisions \n5 1.\t The cost of the Monitor, including the cost of any \n6 consultant to assist the Monitor, shall be borne by the \n7 State in this action.  All reasonable expenses incurred \n8 by the Monitor or any consultant, in the course of the \n9 performance of the duties of the Monitor, pursuant to \n10 the budget of the Monitor, shall be reimbursed by the \n11 State.  The United States will bear its own expenses in \n12 this matter. \n13 2.\t The Monitor shall submit monthly invoices to the \n14 Defendants, with a copy to the United States, detailing \n15 all expenses the Monitor incurred during the prior \n16 month.  These invoices shall include daily records of \n17 time spent and expenses incurred, and shall include \n18 copies of any supporting documentation, including \n19 receipts.  The Defendants agrees to pay each month's \n20 invoice in full from the Monitor within thirty (30) \n21 days of receipt of the monthly invoice from the \n22 Monitor.  If the Defendants dispute all or part of the \n23 invoice, the Defendants shall notify in writing the \n24 Monitor and the United States within ten days of \n25 receipt of the Monitor's monthly invoice.  The Monitor, \n26 the Defendants and the United States will endeavor to \n27 resolve any invoice disputes promptly and in good \n28 faith.  Where the Monitor and the Parties are unable to \n83\n\n\n1 resolve any invoice dispute, the Monitor and/or the \n2 Parties may petition the Court to resolve the dispute. \n3 D.\t Responsibilities and Powers of the Monitor \n4 1.\t The overall duties of the Monitor shall be to observe, \n5 review, report findings, and make recommendations, \n6 where appropriate, with regard to the implementation of \n7 the foregoing Enhancement Plan at the State Hospitals. \n8 The Monitor shall regularly review the therapeutic and \n9 rehabilitation services provided to individuals to \n10 determine the Defendants' implementation of and \n11 compliance with this Consent Judgment.  During the \n12 Monitor's review, the Monitor shall have full and \n13 complete access to all of the State Hospitals' \n14 buildings and facilities, staff, patients, patient \n15 records, documentation, and information relating to the \n16 issues addressed in this Consent Judgment.  The State \n17 Hospitals' Executive Directors shall direct all \n18 employees to cooperate fully with the Monitor.  The \n19 Monitor shall be permitted to initiate and receive ex \n20 parte communications with the Parties.  The Monitor \n21 shall devote such time as is necessary to fulfill the \n22 purposes of the duties and responsibilities of the \n23 Monitor pursuant to this Consent Judgment. \n24 2.\t The Monitor shall consult with the Parties and shall \n25 submit a written plan with regard to the methodologies \n26 to be used by the Monitor to assess the Defendants' \n27 compliance with and implementation of the Consent \n28 Judgment.  The Monitor's evaluation shall include: \n84 \n\n1 regular on-site inspection of the State Hospitals' \n2 facilities and programs for patients, interviews with \n3 administrators, professional and other staff, \n4 contractors, and patients, and detailed review of \n5 pertinent documents and patient records.  The Parties \n6 envision that the Monitor may provide specific \n7 recommendations to the Defendants with regard to steps \n8 to be taken to come into compliance with the Consent \n9 Judgment.  However, the Defendants retain the \n10 discretion to achieve compliance by any legal means \n11 available to them, and may choose to utilize methods \n12 other than those that may be proposed by the Monitor or \n13 the United States.  The Monitor shall not be empowered \n14 to direct the Defendants to take, or to refrain from \n15 taking, any specific action to achieve compliance with \n16 the Consent Judgment.  The Parties do not intend for \n17 the Monitor to have the role of a \"Special Master.\" \n18 The Agreement is the product of two governmental \n19 agencies exercising their expertise. \n20 3.\t In any instance in which either party disagrees as to \n21 compliance, the Court shall give appropriate deference \n22 to the Monitor’s assessment of compliance. \n23 4.\t The Parties envision that the United States and the \n24 Monitor shall conduct a \"baseline\" evaluation of the \n25 Defendants' compliance with the terms of this Consent \n26 Judgment at the State Hospitals within the first 180 \n27 days after the filing of this Consent Judgment.  This \n28 initial baseline evaluation is intended to inform the \n85\n\n\n1 Parties and the Monitor of the status of compliance \n2 with this Enhancement Plan.  The Monitor shall produce \n3 a written report to the Parties with regard to the \n4 State's compliance with particular provisions of the \n5 Consent Judgment as soon as possible, but at least \n6 within 60 days of each visit. \n7 5.\t Following the baseline tour, the Monitor shall conduct \n8 subsequent tours of each State Hospital at least \n9 semi-annually, upon reasonable notice to the State \n10 Hospital, in order to fulfill his or her obligations \n11 pursuant to this Consent Judgment.  In connection with \n12 the baseline tours, the Parties and the Monitor shall \n13 attempt to agree upon a schedule of subsequent tours \n14 and reports for the upcoming year, to be repeated \n15 annually thereafter. \n16 6.\t The Monitor shall provide the Parties with a written \n17 report as soon as possible, but at least within 60 days \n18 of each tour and shall detail with as much specificity \n19 as possible how the State is or is not in compliance \n20 with particular provisions of the Consent Judgment. \n21 Drafts of the Monitor's reports shall be provided to \n22 the Parties for comment at least ten (10) business days \n23 prior to issuance of the reports.  Upon the achievement \n24 of eighteen (18) months of substantial compliance with \n25 any substantive paragraph(s) of this Agreement, no \n26 further reporting shall be required on that paragraph. \n27\n28\n86\n\n\n1 7.\t The Defendants shall notify the Monitor immediately \n2 upon the death of any current State Hospital patient, \n3 including any person who died following transfer due to \n4 medical condition from a State Hospital to another \n5 medical facility.  The Defendants shall forward to the \n6 Monitor copies of any completed incident reports \n7 related to deaths, autopsies and/or death summaries of \n8 residents, as well as all final reports of \n9 investigations that involve State Hospital patients. \n10 The Defendants shall also notify the Monitor \n11 immediately if they receive a citation or threat to \n12 de-certify a State Hospital from the Centers for \n13 Medicaid and Medicare Services. \n14 E.\t The United States' Access to Information and the State \n15 Hospitals \n16 1.\t The United States shall have full access to, and shall, \n17 upon request, receive copies of any documents, records, \n18 databases, and information relating to the \n19 implementation of this Consent Judgment.  The \n20 Defendants shall provide any requested documents, \n21 records, databases, and information to the United \n22 States as soon as possible, but no later than within \n23 thirty (30) business days of the request, or within a \n24 time frame negotiated by the parties if the volume of \n25 requested material is too great to reasonably produce \n26 within thirty days.  The United States, upon reasonable \n27 notice, shall have full access to all of the State \n28 Hospitals' buildings and facilities, staff, patients, \n87\n\n\n1 patients' records, documentation, and information \n2 relating to the issues addressed in this Consent \n3 Judgment.  The State Hospitals' Executive Directors \n4 shall direct all employees to cooperate fully with the \n5 United States.  The United States may receive and \n6 respond to unsolicited calls or contacts from State \n7 personnel outside the presence of State \n8 representatives. \n9 PART III\n\n10 MODIFICATION OF TERMS\n\n11 A.   If the Parties reach a subsequent agreement that varies from \n12 the Plan, the new agreement shall be reduced to writing, signed, \n13 and filed with the Court for approval. \n14 PART IV\n\n15 COMPLIANCE AND TERMINATION\n\n16 A.   The purpose of this Consent Judgment is that the Defendants \n17 will be able to achieve desired outcomes for and provide the \n18 necessary protections, supports, and services to the \n19 individuals served by the State Hospitals.  All of the terms of \n20 the Plan set forth in Part I hereof shall be implemented at the \n21 State Hospitals within 36 months of the Enhancement Plan's \n22 effective date, except that § I.3 of the Plan and all provisions \n23 of the Plan having to do with suicide prevention measures shall \n24 be implemented at the State Hospitals upon the effective date of \n25 this Consent Judgment.  This Consent Judgment will be terminated \n26 and the case dismissed five (5) years after the effective date of \n27 the Consent Judgment.  This Consent Judgment may terminate at an \n28 earlier date if the Parties agree that the Defendants are in \n88\n\n\n1 substantial compliance with each provision of the Consent \n2 Judgment, and the State has maintained compliance for at least \n3 eighteen (18) months (\"maintained sustained compliance\").  If \n4 Defendants and the Monitor contend that the Defendants have \n5 maintained sustained compliance and the United States disagrees, \n6 Defendants may move this Court for an order terminating this \n7 Consent Judgment.  In any instance in which the parties disagree \n8 as to compliance, the Court shall give appropriate deference to \n9 the Monitor's assessment of compliance.  Noncompliance with mere \n10 technicalities, or temporary failure to comply during a period of \n11 otherwise sustained compliance shall not constitute failure to \n12 maintain substantial compliance.  At the same time, temporary \n13 compliance during a period of sustained noncompliance shall not \n14 constitute substantial compliance. \n15 B.   At all times, the State shall comply with applicable federal \n16 and state licensing requirements. \n17 C.   If the United States maintains that the Defendants have \n18 failed to carry out any requirement of this Consent Judgment, the \n19 United States shall notify the Defendants with specificity of any \n20 instance(s) in which it maintains that the Defendants have failed \n21 to carry out the requirements of this Consent Judgment. \n22 D.   With the exception of conditions or practices that pose an \n23 immediate and serious threat to the life, health, or safety of \n24 individuals served by the State Hospitals, the Defendants shall \n25 have thirty (30) days from the date of a deficiency notice from \n26 the United States to cure the claim of noncompliance.  During \n27 this period, the Parties shall coordinate and shall discuss areas \n28 of disagreement and attempt to resolve outstanding differences. \n89\n\n\n1 E.   Unless specified to the contrary elsewhere herein, in any \n2 compliance or other adversarial hearing prior to final dismissal \n3 of this action, the burden of proof will be on the Party moving \n4 the Court. \n5 F.   All provisions of this Consent Judgment shall have ongoing \n6 effect until the final dismissal of this action.  The Court shall \n7 retain jurisdiction for all purposes until such time as this \n8 action dismissed.  Independent of the foregoing, if the United \n9 States and the Defendants agree that the State Hospitals have \n10 achieved substantial compliance with each section of this Consent \n11 Judgment, the Parties shall file a joint motion to dismiss this \n12 action. \n13 G.   This case shall be treated administratively as inactive. \n14 However, the Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the terms of \n15 this Order. \n16\n17\n18 DATED:  This   2  day of     May  , 2006. \n19\n20\n21\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n90\n\n\n1 APPROVED AS TO FORM AND CONTENT: \n2\n3\n4 ________________________________\nWAN J.

      "title": "Re: Metropolitan State Hospital, Norwalk, California",
      "text": "February 19, 2004 \nThe Honorable Arnold Schwarzenegger \nGovernor of California \nState Capitol Building \nSacramento, CA  95814 \nRe:  Metropolitan State Hospital, Norwalk, California \nDear Governor Schwarzenegger: \nOn March 21, 2002, we notified then Governor Davis that we \nwere investigating conditions at Metropolitan State Hospital \n(“Metropolitan”), pursuant to the Civil Rights of \nInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997. \nDuring the weeks of June 24 and July 8, 2002, we visited the \nfacility.  Our first tour, “Metropolitan I,” focused on the care \nand treatment provided to the facility’s child and adolescent \npatients, all of whom are in Metropolitan’s Program I.  Our \nsecond tour, “Metropolitan II,” addressed the care and treatment \nprovided to the facility’s adult patients.  At exit interviews \nconducted at the end of each facility visit, we verbally conveyed \nour preliminary findings to counsel and facility officials. \nConsistent with the requirements of CRIPA, we wrote to Governor \nDavis on May 13, 2003, to apprise him of our findings regarding \nthe child and adolescent patients.  We are writing now to \ntransmit our findings regarding the care and treatment of the \nfacility’s adult patients. \nAs we noted in our previous letter, we appreciate the \ncooperation and assistance provided to us by the administrators \nand staff of Metropolitan.  We hope to continue to work with the \nState of California and officials at Metropolitan in a \ncooperative manner. \nWe conducted our investigation by reviewing medical and \nother records relating to the care and treatment of approximately \n150 of Metropolitan’s adult patients; interviewing administrators \nand staff; speaking with patients; and conducting on-site surveys \nof the facility.  We were assisted in our investigation by expert \nconsultants in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric \nnursing, and incident management and quality assurance. \n\n- 2  \nAs of the time of our July 2002 visit, Metropolitan had a \ncensus of approximately 825 patients, ranging in age from 11 to \nmore than 80, roughly 725 of whom were adults.  Metropolitan’s \nadult patients are placed in one of five treatment programs, \nbased on a mix of factors, primarily:  (a) the nature of their \nadmission (civil or forensic); (b) their gender; (c) the severity \nof their illness, (d) their assessed ability to participate in \npsychological and social rehabilitation (“psychosocial \nrehabilitation”); (e) their need for skilled nursing care; and \n(f) their language and cultural needs.  Each of these treatment \nprograms, identified as Programs II through VI, operates semi-\nindependently, with its own director, nurse coordinator, and \nsenior psychiatrist. \nResidents of state-operated facilities have a right to live \nin reasonable safety and to receive adequate health care, along \nwith habilitation to ensure their safety and freedom from \nunreasonable restraint, prevent regression, and facilitate their \nability to exercise their liberty interests.  See Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  Similar protections are accorded by \nfederal law.  See, e.g., Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1395hh, and implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. Parts\n482-483 (Medicaid and Medicare Program Provisions).  The State \nalso is obliged to provide services in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to individuals’ needs.  Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et \nseq.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130 (d); see Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 \n(1999). \nAs was the case with Metropolitan’s Program I, which serves \nthe facility’s child and adolescent patients, it was apparent \nthat many Metropolitan staff are highly dedicated individuals who \nare genuinely concerned for the well-being of the persons in \ntheir care.  In particular, certain staff display admirable \ndedication to the patients whom they serve, and undertake \nsignificant, largely self-initiated, efforts to provide effective \nrehabilitation to their patients.  Further, again as is true of \nProgram I, Metropolitan’s adult programs are demonstrably \nproficient in many procedural aspects of care.  Nevertheless, it \nis also the case that significant and wide-ranging deficiencies \nexist in Metropolitan’s provision of care to its adult patients, \nand that the First Amendment rights of its patients are being \nviolated.  Our findings, facts that support them, and the minimum \nremedial steps that we believe are necessary to correct \ndeficiencies are set forth below. \n\n- 3  \n\nI.  INTEGRATED TREATMENT PLANNING \nThe planning of treatments and interventions (“treatment \nplanning”) for Metropolitan’s adult patients substantially \ndeparts from generally accepted professional standards of care. \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care instruct that \ntreatment plans should integrate the individual assessments, \nevaluations, and diagnoses of the patient performed by all \ndisciplines involved in the patient’s treatment; be \nindividualized; and identify and build on the patient’s \nstrengths, interests, preferences, and goals, to optimize the \npatient’s recovery and ability to sustain herself in the most \nintegrated, appropriate setting. \nAs a threshold matter, Metropolitan’s treatment planning \nformat does not recognize that adequate treatment planning is \ndependent upon a logical sequence:  first and foremost, the \nformulation of an accurate diagnosis; subsequently, the \nutilization of the diagnosis to identify the fundamental problems \nthat are caused by the diagnosed illness; the development of \nspecific, measurable goals that are designed to ameliorate \nproblems and promote functional independence; the interventions \nthat will guide staff as they work toward those goals; and, \nfinally, ongoing assessment and, as warranted, revision of the \nplan. \nAlmost uniformly, the document entitled “Treatment Plan” in \nMetropolitan charts bears no resemblance to a comprehensive, \nintegrated plan for the provision of treatment addressing \nindividual patient needs.  It is often redundant, burdensome, and \nconfusing for staff to follow.  Although there was some slight \nvariation in the structure of the plans between units, in no \ninstance, among approximately 150 charts reviewed, did we see an \nindividualized plan of treatment. \nDiagnoses listed on the plan often differ from diagnoses \nlisted in the physician documentation section of the patient’s \nchart.  Similarly, identified problems often differ with other \ncomponents in the plan, and the patient’s medication plan often \nis not integrated into the overall treatment plan. \nThe primary reason for hospitalization is not identified and \naddressed carefully, and documentation of the need for continued \nhospitalization is not individualized or valid.  Short- and long-\nterm goals are typically generic, overly broad, not attainable, \ndo not account for the patient’s level of functioning, likes, \n\n- 4  \n\npreferences and goals, and do not include measurable outcomes \nregarding objectives such as developing a skill, altering a \nbehavior or experiencing a reduction in symptoms.  Further, \ninformation about the anticipated length of stay is not linked to \nachievable outcomes. \nTreatment interventions are determined and implemented \narbitrarily and indiscriminately.  Further, treatment plans do \nnot identify in rational, operationally defined terms the \nsymptoms or problems to be monitored or the frequency with which \nsuch monitoring and reporting should occur.  Consequently, \nsymptoms and problems are not reliably monitored or reported.  In \nthis regard, Metropolitan does not regularly collect or analyze \ninformation regarding patient progress relative to target \nsymptoms and problems, or utilize such information in the \nreassessment and revision of treatment plans.  In fact, based on \nour review, it is rare for the facility to modify treatment plans \nbecause of a patient’s lack of progress under an existing plan. \nThis is fundamentally at odds with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care. \nNumerous examples illustrate these problems.  Diagnoses \nlisted in the treatment plans differed from those listed in \npsychiatric assessments in the cases of S.B.,1 N.Cj., and T.E. \nFurther, S.B. had an April 2002 treatment plan indicating “no \nprogress” with a problem that was listed as closed in October \n2001 on his master treatment plan.  Another problem identified at \nS.B.’s admission was not identified in the treatment plan until \nalmost two years after admission.  Further, the treatment plan \nindicated “no change” in the patient’s goals, although numerous \nchanges, in fact, had been documented elsewhere. \nSimilarly, N.Cj.’s treatment plan includes problems that are \nlisted as “discontinued” or “revised” on another form dated the \nsame date.  In fact, as to each of the listed problems, three \nsuccessive treatment plans stated, “Goals not achieved, goals not \nchanged, interventions not changed.”  T.E.’s short-term goal for \nanger management deficit was not revised as of October 2002, \nalthough her chart indicates that she accomplished this goal in \nearly 2001. \nMedication compliance was listed as an intervention and/or a \ncriteria for discharge for T.E. and F.I. even though this is not \n1 In this letter, to protect patients’ privacy, we identify \npatients by initials other than their own.  We will separately \ntransmit to the State a schedule cross-referencing the initials \nwith patient names. \n\n- 5  \nidentified as a problem for either of these patients.  In \ncontrast, medication compliance is not listed as a problem for \nU.C., a patient who was noncompliant with her medication when she \ncommitted an assault with a deadly weapon.  C.Hb. was prescribed \nmedications for anxiety and depression, but there is no mention \nof either problem as targets in his treatment plan. \nI.C.’s psychiatrist started him on Risperdol (a psychotropic \nmedication) and stated, in the treatment plan, \"patient will be \ninvolved in different unit teaching activities.\"  The treatment \ngroups to which this patient was assigned appear to have little \npurpose beyond occupying his time.  In this regard, the \npsychiatrist’s clinical description of this patient makes no \nreferences to impulse control problems nor impairments in social \nproblem solving skills.  In fact, the master interdisciplinary \ntreatment plan of the hospital from which this patient was \ntransferred states that, even when he was acutely delusional, \n\"Mr. [C.’s] strength is social competence.”  Nevertheless, many \nof the groups to which this patient was assigned were to teach \n“impulse control” and “socially approved problem solving \ntechniques.”  Further, although this patient has little previous \ninstitutional history, his treatment plan emphasizes socializing \nhim to the role of a psychiatric hospital resident (attending \ngroups), rather than reinforcing the patient's own stated desire \nto “get back to work.”  Thus, the harm to patients from \nMetropolitan’s treatment planning practices goes beyond a failure \nto provide care.  It includes fostering the institutionalization \nof its patients.  This is a gross deviation from generally \naccepted professional standards of care. \nN.D. is an 18-year-old patient who was transferred from a\njuvenile facility with assaultive and self-injurious behavior, \nand a history of brutal sexual abuse and neglect apparently \nbeginning at age two.  Apart from medications, which a \nneurologist identified as being at toxic levels at one point, the \nchart provides no evidence that N.D. is receiving any treatment \non her unit, which constitutes a substantial departure from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care.  Further, \nN.D.’s chart describes her as a nonpsychotic individual of at \nleast average intelligence.  Notwithstanding that N.D. has the \ncognitive ability to engage in such a discussion, we could not \nlocate anything in N.D.’s chart indicating that any staff member \nhad ever talked with her about her personal goals and objectives \nfor a life outside of an institution.  It appears that developing \nsuch goals, or even the skills needed to achieve such goals, is \nnot part of her treatment plan.  In fact, her chart does not \narticulate any long-term goals.  Such failures are inconsistent \nwith federal regulations that require the development of adequate \ntreatment plans.  See 42 C.F.R. § 482.61(c). \n\n- 6  \nTreatment plans are not tailored to the needs of patient \nsubpopulations, such as patients with cognitive impairments, \npersistent dangerous behaviors, and substance abuse, and patients \nwho have been found not guilty by reason of insanity (“NGRI”). \nMetropolitan assigns generic interventions to these patients \nrather than developing targeted interventions geared toward their \nparticular needs. \nLike the treatment plans in Program I, treatment plans in \nthe adult units are completed and reviewed after unacceptably \nlong delays.  The infrequency of treatment team meetings leads to \ndelayed treatment, poor interdisciplinary communication, \ninability to modify treatment in a timely manner, and \nunnecessarily prolonged hospitalization. \nAdequate treatment planning also requires that patients have \ngenuine input into and understand their treatment plans and their \nimplementation.  Metropolitan’s documentation reflects that the \npatients do not meaningfully participate in their treatment.  For \ninstance, during the treatment team meetings that we observed for \nC.D., S.G., and P.P., team members talked about the patients in \nthe third person in front of them, frequently interrupted the \npatients, failed to discuss the patients’ goals in front of them, \nand/or ignored the patients’ legitimate concerns.  During one of \nthese meetings, staff’s response to S.G.’s inquiry regarding his \nplacement options was, “I wish I were a fortune teller” and “Your \nmom has to find a place.”  Similarly, S.G.’s psychiatrist \nentirely ignored S.G.’s repeated statement that he needed his \nmedication changed.  Our expert consultant subsequently confirmed \nthat changes in S.G.’s medication regimen were clinically \nwarranted. \nFurther, Metropolitan’s treatment teams often are \nuncoordinated, disorganized, and unstable.  Also, while some \nteams carry comparatively light loads, others have many more than \n24 patients.  More fundamentally, Metropolitan’s treatment teams \noften appear to lack a common understanding of the patients’ \nsymptoms or problems that should drive treatment interventions. \nTreating psychiatrists do not verify that psychiatric and other \ninterventions, particularly behavioral treatments, do not \nconflict.  Also, many of the treatment team meetings that we \nobserved concluded without an agreement among the team members on \nthe modifications that had been or should be made to the \ntreatment plan or any dialogue indicating a common understanding \nof, or response to, the patient’s status. \nMetropolitan also has no mechanism to address patients’ risk \nfactors.  The current procedure, whereby staff check a box on the \nadmission risk assessment form to indicate if a patient is \n\n- 7  \n\nsuicidal, homicidal, an elopement risk, or a fire-setter, is not \nperformed consistently.  More importantly, these risk factors are \nnot then tracked by treatment teams or integrated into the \ntreatment plans. \nFor instance, “fire-setter” or “homicidal” are identified in \nadmission risk assessments for T.C., S.B., O.U., and Z.F., but \nthese risks are neither addressed in the treatment plans nor \ntracked by the treatment teams.  Z.F.’s admission risk assessment \nfails to identify suicidal behavior as a risk factor, although \nthis patient had jumped off of a building approximately two years \nearlier.  T.Eb.’s preliminary psychiatric evaluation does not \ncontain a formalized risk assessment, despite his long history of \npsychotic illness, substance abuse, proclivity to assault others, \nand attempted elopement.  Similarly, K.P.’s preliminary \npsychiatric evaluation lists no risk factors, notwithstanding his \nadmission as a danger to others and his prior elopement from \nMetropolitan during a previous hospitalization.  Further, there \nis no reference to the admission risk factors in the discharge \nnotes.  In general, Metropolitan lacks an adequate procedure to \nidentify or track patterns of high-risk behavior or to establish \nthresholds to ensure early and timely intervention to reduce \nongoing risk. \nIn summary, Metropolitan’s treatment planning for its adult \npatients substantially departs from generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care.  These deficiencies subject \npatients to treatment that:  (a) prolongs their psychiatric \ndistress; (b) needlessly worsens or prolongs their difficulties \nwith problem solving, memory, or attention, thereby exacerbating \ntheir disability; (c) unnecessarily exposes those with substance \nabuse problems to additional drug dependency; (d) needlessly \nextends their institutionalization; (e) exposes them to an \nincreased risk of relapse after discharge; and (f) contributes to \nan overall lower quality of life. \nII.  ASSESSMENTS \nAdequate assessment of a mental health patient for treatment \nplanning purposes requires input from various disciplines, under \nthe active direction and guidance of the treating psychiatrist, \nwho is responsible for assuring that relevant patient information \nis obtained and considered.  At Metropolitan, as at many mental \nhealth facilities, assessments typically are reflected in: (a) \npsychiatric assessments and diagnoses; (b) psychological \nassessments; (c) rehabilitation assessments; and (d) social \nhistory evaluations. \n\n- 8  \n\nA.  Psychiatric Assessments and Diagnoses \nIn many respects, psychiatric assessments are the main \nvehicle establishing the patient’s diagnoses, establishing safe \nand effective treatment, and providing direction for treatment \nplanning.  Yet, it appears that Metropolitan psychiatrists \nroutinely diagnose their adult patients as having psychiatric \ndisorders without clinical justification.  As a result, patients’ \nactual illnesses are not being properly treated, patients are \nexposed to potentially toxic treatments for conditions from which \nthey do not suffer, patients are not provided appropriate \npsychiatric rehabilitation, and patients’ options for discharge \nare seriously limited. \nIn the majority of cases that we reviewed, the information \ngathered during the assessment process does not justify the \npatient’s diagnoses.  For instance, F.I. was diagnosed with \nschizoaffective disorder, although nothing in her history, her \nmental status examination, or her psychiatric progress note dated \nthe week after admission indicated that she had any psychotic \nsymptoms.  Similarly, N.Cj.’s chart contained no support for his \ndiagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.  Apart from his reported \nilliteracy, his diagnosis of mental retardation was also \nunsupported. \nMetropolitan psychiatrists diagnosed K.Sf. with, and \nprescribed two antidepressants for, a mood disorder, even though \nhis records consistently indicated no evidence of a mood disorder \nof any kind.  However, this patient does suffer from Huntington’s \nChorea, a degenerative neurological disease causing ever \nincreasing dementia and severe abnormal movements.  Although his \nchart identifies numerous occurrences of falls, poor balance, \nclumsy movement and poor gait, recorded by different staff within \ndays of an ostensibly detailed psychiatric evaluation of his \nabnormal involuntary movements, that evaluation inexplicably \nidentified no abnormal movements whatsoever.  In numerous other \ncases, including D.I., L.E., I.Q., N.E., and S.G., the \ninformation gathered by facility psychiatrists during the \nassessment process did not justify the patients’ diagnoses. \nSeparately, many of Metropolitan’s adult patients receive \ntentative and unspecific diagnoses (often referred to as “rule \nout” (“R/O”) or “not otherwise specified” (“NOS”) diagnoses), \nwithout being further assessed, at least as evidenced in their \ncharts, to finalize these open diagnoses.  For instance, U.E. has \nhad a diagnosis of “psychotic disorder, NOS” since his admission \nto Metropolitan in 1997.  His treating psychiatrist stated that \nno diagnostic work-up was performed to resolve this diagnosis \nbecause “that is the diagnosis [U.E.] came in with,” an assertion \n\n- 9  \n\nat odds with a psychiatrist’s duty to attempt to identify the \nnature of his patient’s illness. \nErroneous and untimely psychiatric evaluations and diagnoses \ncan lead to the wrong mix of treatments and interventions, \nthereby causing harm through ineffective, potentially deleterious \ntreatment, and the withholding of appropriate interventions.  It \nis clear that Metropolitan’s practices are irreconcilable with \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care in this area, \nand that its patients experience harm and a significant risk of \nharm as a result. \nB.  Psychological Assessments and Evaluations \nLike the other forms of patient assessments and evaluations \nat Metropolitan, psychological assessments and evaluations, with \nfew exceptions, are inaccurate, incomplete, and uninformative. \nThese poor assessments and evaluations contribute directly to bad \ntreatment choices that, in turn, expose patients to actual or \npotential harm.  In the context of patients’ needs for \npsychological supports and adequate life skills, this harm takes \nthe form of prolonged and/or exacerbated behavioral disorders and \nfunctional disabilities that, in turn, needlessly prolong \npatients’ confinement in a highly restrictive environment and \nblock their successful re-entry into the community. \nMetropolitan’s policies generally provide that psychological \nassessments (which involve formal testing) and psychological \nevaluations (which do not involve formal testing) are to be \nperformed when “clinically indicated.”  Yet, we found numerous \ninstances where assessments and evaluations were warranted but \nnot performed.  Examples include M.H. and N.T. \nIn fact, generally accepted professional standards of care \nfor facilities such as Metropolitan dictate that, before a \npatient’s treatment plan is developed, facility psychologists \nprovide a thorough psychological assessment of the patient to \nassist the treating psychiatrist in reaching an accurate \ndiagnosis and provide an accurate evaluation of the patient’s \npsychological needs.  As indicated above, this does not happen at \nMetropolitan.  Moreover, as needed, additional psychological \nassessments should be performed early in the patient’s \nhospitalization to assist with any psychiatric disorders that may \nneed further study, such as “Rule Out,” deferred, and “NOS” \ndiagnoses.  However, this rarely occurs at Metropolitan.  As \nnoted above, it is common for patients there to carry open, or \nunresolved, diagnoses for several years, which is a gross \ndeviation from generally accepted professional standards of care \nthat also contributes to ineffective, even harmful, treatments. \n\n- 10  \n\nFurther, based on our review of numerous patient charts, the \npsychological assessments and evaluations that were performed \nwere generally strikingly poor, and more likely to lead to bad or \nineffective interventions than good ones.  The psychological \nassessment of N.Cj., for example, contains glaring weaknesses \nthat render it of little use.  The total analysis of this \npatient’s intelligence is, “[p]atient said he never went to \nschool and doesn’t read or write.”  Regarding the patient’s \n“strengths and coping style,” the analysis is blank.  Although it \nstates that the patient has a history of assaultive behaviors and \nproperty destruction at the hospital, it provides no analysis of \nthe antecedents, circumstances, causes, or consequences of this \nbehavior, notwithstanding that these are the core elements of \nbehavioral analysis.  Thus, it provides none of the information \nessential to understand and correctly address his behavioral \ndisorders.  Similarly, the May 2, 2002 psychological assessment \nof N.E. advances numerous factual inaccuracies, various \nunintelligible statements, and a psychiatric diagnosis contrary \nto that used by the rest of the treatment team, with no apparent \njustification or explanation. \nA December 3, 2001 psychology assessment of K.Q. concludes, \nwithout support, that this patient’s schizophrenia is not the \ncause of his dementia because his cognitive deficits “appear to \nexceed those associated with schizophrenia,” notwithstanding that \nthe opposite is likely true.  Further, the assessment recommends \nthat K.Q. undergo neurological testing, because the last such \ntesting ostensibly had occurred 15 years earlier.  In fact, \nK.Q.’s chart makes clear that he had undergone a thorough \nneurological exam at Metropolitan the previous month. \nA subsequent, October 10, 2002 “Functional Evaluation of \nBehavior” for K.Q., performed by two other Metropolitan \npsychologists, also is significantly flawed.  Its analysis of \n“reenforcers,” or factors that support various behaviors, lists \nitems that K.Q. reportedly enjoys but provides no analysis as to \nhow they affect his behaviors.  Similarly, the summary and \nconclusion of the report list various factors that might \ncontribute to the patient’s negative behaviors but provide no \nanalysis as to how or whether any of them actually have any \nrelationship with those behaviors.  Notwithstanding its stated \npurpose as a “functional evaluation” of this patient’s behavior, \nthe report is devoid of any evaluation or other support for its \nconclusion regarding this patient’s behavioral disorders. \nFurther, many Metropolitan patients suffer from acquired \nbrain damage or primary neurological diseases, resulting, for \ninstance, from motor vehicle accidents or strokes that affect \ncognitive function in a manner not typical of primary psychiatric \n\n- 11  \n\ndisorders.  Nevertheless, Metropolitan lacks staff possessing an \nexpertise in neuropsychology.  Consequently, these patients \nreceive inadequate or no assessments of their injuries, their \ntreatment teams do not understand the nature of their cognitive \ndeficits, and they receive misguided, ineffective treatments and \ninterventions. \nM.C., for instance, is an 80-year-old patient who has a \nhistory of stroke and possible bipolar disorder.  It was apparent \nfrom our interview of two psychologists who have worked with M.C. \nover several years that they do not know whether he had \nexperienced one or multiple strokes, where in the brain the \nstroke(s) had occurred, or what the likely relationship is \nbetween the stroke(s) and this patient’s cognitive and behavioral \nproblems, one of which is “aggression.”  Although M.C.’s \naggression strongly appears to be the result of behavioral \ndisinhibition (often thought of as loss of “impulse control”), \nwhich is a phenomenon occurring in many victims of significant \nbrain injury, the hospital’s intervention is classes in anger \nmanagement and coping skills – highly inappropriate treatments \nwhere brain injury produces, first, aggression resulting from \nbehavioral disinhibition, rather than “anger,” and, second, \ncognitive impairments that interfere with skill acquisition. \nSimilarly, T.Q. suffered a traumatic brain injury from a \nmotorcycle accident, and experiences significant short-term \nmemory problems, difficulty concentrating, and explosive, \nunpredictable outbursts that are described as impulsive motor \noutbursts with little association to his actual emotional state. \nNotwithstanding that it is fundamental, in such cases, to perform \na neuropsychological examination to determine the nature of the \npatient’s memory deficits and to assist in identifying \nalternative learning methods to address severe cognitive \ndeficits, the facility has not performed such an examination. \nFurther, although he cannot remember, has difficulty \nconcentrating, and has outbursts that probably are not caused by \nhis temper, the facility has placed him in anger management \nclasses. \nC.  Rehabilitation Assessments \nEffective psychiatric rehabilitation derives from accurate \nand complete rehabilitation assessments.  Rehabilitation \nassessments should identify the patient’s life skills, cognitive \nabilities, and distinct strengths, weaknesses, likes, and \ndislikes.  This information is fundamental to developing adequate \ntreatment.  Generally speaking, Metropolitan’s rehabilitation \nassessments substantially depart from generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care. \n\n- 12  \nA few of the rehabilitation assessments at Metropolitan \nprovide good descriptions of patients’ interests and skills. \nTypically, however, assessments fail to address patients’ \nrehabilitation needs.  In fact, the assessments indicate that \nmany of Metropolitan’s rehabilitation therapists lack even a \nbasic understanding of psychiatric illnesses.  Consequently, the \nassessments generally do not provide information that is \nnecessary in developing appropriate rehabilitation goals and \ninterventions. \nThe February 22, 2002 rehabilitation assessment for K.P., \nfor example, states that “[t]he patient has fair to poor \ntreatment potential at this time due to the patient’s attitude \nand lack of motivation to attend and participate in his treatment \ngroups and also his response to his treatment plan.”  The \nassessment’s focus on this patient’s “attitude” and “lack of \nmotivation” is troubling.  This patient’s record clearly \nidentifies activities that he voluntarily undertakes, such as \nreading a certain genre of novels, but these are not identified \nin the assessment as potential bases for rehabilitation \nactivities.  Rather than serving as a basis for appropriate \ntreatment, K.P.’s rehabilitation assessment saddles him with a \nnegative prognosis for recovery. \nMajor portions of S.G.’s rehabilitation assessments of \nFebruary 7, 2002, and August 20, 2002, are incoherent.  Further, \nthe sections that are understandable reflect no knowledge of \nappropriate rehabilitation objectives.  Finally, more than half \nof the August assessment, including its most incoherent portions, \nis identical to the February assessment. \nD.  Social History Evaluations \nThe social history evaluation should reliably inform the \npsychiatrist and other treatment team members regarding such \nfundamental factors as the circumstances surrounding the onset of \nthe patient’s illness, the history of the illness, and relevant \nfamily information, because these factors are often essential to \nforming an accurate diagnosis and developing adequate treatments \nand interventions.  Additionally, an adequate social history \nevaluation permits treatment teams to learn from previously \nattempted interventions and to plan effectively for the patient’s \ndischarge. \nSome Metropolitan social history evaluations were thorough \nand complete.  However, most contained significant factual \nomissions, apparent errors, or unresolved internal \ninconsistencies.  Consequently, patients’ social history \nevaluations were generally unreliable and often fostered \n\n- 13  \n\ninadequate interventions around psychiatric needs, behavioral \nproblems, and important life skill deficits.  This is \nirreconcilable with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare. \nFor instance, the latest social history evaluation of U.C. \nstates that “patient does not have a history of arrest prior to \nthe instant case.”  Yet, it separately indicates that the patient \nhad been arrested and convicted numerous times, including \nseparate instances of “battery on a peace officer,” “assault with \na deadly weapon with great bodily harm,” and “assault on a peace \nofficer.”  The evaluation also indicates that the patient’s \nmother had been mentally ill and had committed suicide when the \npatient was a child.  Then, with no attempt to reconcile the \nprevious observation, it suggests that the mother was last known \nto be living in a nursing home.  Although patient histories \ninevitably will involve incomplete and sometimes inconsistent \nfacts, the evaluator’s failure to recognize and attempt to \nresolve facts having important treatment implications – such as \nwhether the patient has a history of assaults and a mother who \ncommitted suicide – compromises diagnoses and treatment \ndecisions, and exposes patients to harm and a significant risk of \nharm. \nThe social history evaluation of N.D. contains similar \nobvious gaps and significant, unaddressed inconsistencies. \nAlthough the patient was 18-years-old as of the most recent \nsocial evaluation history, it irreconcilably states that “patient \nhas had a long and serious history of dangerous behavior since \nage 18.”  Nowhere does this report detail the dangerous \nbehaviors, discuss possible precipitants, or otherwise set forth \ninformation shedding light on this problem. \nE.  Court Assessments \nA number of Metropolitan’s adult patients are committed due \nto a not guilty by reason of insanity status (“NGRI”). \nMetropolitan prepares court reports assessing these patients, the \ncontent and quality of which are instrumental in shaping the \ncourt’s decision whether to release the patient to a lower level \nof care.  The format and content of the court reports, however, \nfail to provide the court adequate and accurate information and, \nconsequently, contribute to needlessly maintaining patients in a \nhighly restrictive setting when they qualify for a less \nrestrictive environment. \nFor instance, Metropolitan’s court reports regarding M.C. \ndid not recommend him for the conditional release program \n(“CONREP”) although his chart indicates that he consistently met \n\n- 14 -\n\nCONREP’s criteria  – “person would not pose a substantial danger \nof physical harm to others if released into the community” – \nsince February 1999. \nSimilarly, all of U.T.’s records and court reports indicate \nhis cooperativeness, compliance, and participation, but he failed \nto meet CONREP’s criteria for release due to his reported lack of \nunderstanding of his illness and ability to cope with anger. \nYet, U.T.’s treatment plan did not focus on either of these two \nissues.  These patients are exposed to unnecessarily restrictive \ntreatment so long as the court’s decisions are based on \nincomplete and inaccurate analyses of the patients’ condition, \nand the facility fails to provide treatments focused on the \nreasons for its patients’ hospitalization. \nIII.\t DISCHARGE PLANNING AND PLACEMENT IN THE MOST INTEGRATED \nSETTING \nWithin the limitations of court-imposed confinement, \nfederal law, as interpreted through generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care, requires that treatment teams, \nwith the leadership of psychiatrists and the support of the \nhospital administration, actively pursue the timely discharge of \npatients to the most integrated, appropriate setting that is \nconsistent with patients’ needs.  Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 \n(1999).  From the time of admission, the factors that likely \nwill foster viable discharge for a particular patient should be \nidentified expressly, through professional assessments, and \nshould drive treatment interventions. \nThe discharge planning process for Metropolitan’s adult \npatients falls well short of these standards of care. \nConsequently, patients are subjected to unnecessarily extended \nhospitalizations, poor transitions, and a high likelihood of \nreadmission, all of which result in harm. \nMetropolitan’s various policies indicate that planning for a \npatient’s discharge is an interdisciplinary effort that starts \nthe day the patient arrives.  However, in practice, \nMetropolitan’s discharge planning is done by the social worker \nalone, near the end of the anticipated Metropolitan tenure, and \ntypically is limited to finding a residential facility that will \ntake the patient and arranging for a clinical appointment after \ndischarge.  In a few instances, individual staff make exceptional \nefforts to overcome largely bureaucratic discharge issues, but \nsuch individual efforts are not sufficient to offset the \nfacility’s more systemic shortcomings. \n\n- 15  \nBased on our extensive chart review, treatment team \ndiscussion of discharge is generally limited to the type of \nsetting to which the patient is likely to go.  Apart from obvious \nfactors, such as the absence of psychiatric symptoms, assaultive \nbehaviors, and fundamental deficits in the activities of daily \nliving, criteria for discharge are rarely considered or \nintegrated in treatment planning.  For instance, the causes of \npreviously failed discharges or particular reasons for the \npatient’s admission to a psychiatric institution are seldom \nconsidered and addressed.  Also, the patient’s strengths, \npreferences, and personal goals play virtually no meaningful role \nin discharge planning. \nPreparation for discharge while in the hospital appears to \nbe almost nonexistent.  In no instance could we determine that a \ntreatment team actually had prepared a patient to transition to, \nor succeed in, a new setting.  In fact, the provision of \ntransition supports almost never was discussed in the numerous \npatient records that we extensively reviewed.  Further, \nrehabilitation goals are couched – and functional recovery is \nevaluated – on the basis of patients' ability to engage in group \ntherapy and leisure activities, not on expressed and demonstrated \nskills in work, school, or independent living.  Finally, the \npatient plays virtually no significant role in the discharge \nprocess. \nExamples of these deficiencies can be found in many patient \ncharts.  K.C.’s discharge plan, for instance, is limited to a \nboilerplate discussion of housing issues.  E.B.’s plan consists \nof a facility placement to an Institute for Mental Disease \n(typically a locked facility, oriented towards maintenance, with \nless oversight of patients than Metropolitan provides) “until she \nis able to get her self-destructive behavior under control and is \nless resistive to treatment . . . .  The patient will be assisted \nto get independently [sic] living skills training for herself. \nIt is also hoped that the patient will enroll herself into \nvocational rehabilitation for continued schooling alternative \n[sic].\" \nIn many respects, this patient’s discharge plan underscores \na failure within Metropolitan to accept responsibility for \nhelping patients to recover and to gain behavioral control.  The \nplan instead makes this a treatment goal for the next provider, \nwhile Metropolitan is to address “living skills.” \nThe discharge plan for D.D. is simply a list of generic \ncriteria (e.g., “for 90 days will comply with meds, attend 70% of \ngroups, comply with [activities of daily living], and free of \n[danger to self, danger to others] and AWOL attempts.”)  The plan \n\n- 16  \n\ncould apply to virtually every adult Metropolitan patient with \nany history of dangerousness; it is not individualized and says \nnothing about meaningful activity following discharge. \nN.T.’s discharge plan is limited to placement in a less \nrestrictive environment.  The paucity of care reflected in this \nplan is particularly glaring; this patient was readmitted to \nMetropolitan after only nine weeks of living in the community \nfollowing her previous discharge, and although her treatment team \nshould have focused in discharge planning on identifying and \naddressing the causes of her previously failed placement, it did \nnot do so.  The discharge plans for C.Hb. and N.D. similarly are \nessentially nonexistent. \nMetropolitan’s failure to provide adequate, individualized \ndischarge planning, that is integrated in treatment decisions, \nsignificantly deviates from generally accepted professional \nstandards of care and contributes to unnecessarily prolonged \nhospitalization and to inappropriate, unsuccessful placements in \nother settings.  As a consequence, patients are harmed or exposed \nto the risk of harm by the effects of prolonged \ninstitutionalization and by being denied a reasonable opportunity \nto live successfully in the most integrated, appropriate setting. \nIV.  SPECIFIC TREATMENT SERVICES \nThe provision of effective interventions for patients in \ncare settings such as Metropolitan requires the integrated \nparticipation of various treatment services, the exact \nconfiguration of which is dictated by the individual patient’s \nneeds.  As noted at Section I, above, Metropolitan’s ability to \nprovide integrated treatment is deficient.  Further, many of \nthese services, standing alone, substantially depart from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care. \nA.  Psychiatry Services \nMetropolitan’s psychiatric supports and services grossly \ndeviate from generally accepted professional standards of care, \nexposing patients to harm and a significant risk of harm. \nGenerally speaking, Metropolitan’s psychiatrists fail to direct \ntheir treatment teams adequately, which is an essential \nrequirement of a mental health facility.  More specifically, as \ndiscussed herein, they fail to exercise adequate and appropriate \nmedical management and monitor appropriately medication side \neffects.  Also, as discussed in more detail, at Sections I and \nII, above, and at Section IV.B.2., below, these psychiatrists \nfail to plan adequate and appropriate treatments, fail to \nintegrate properly psychiatric, behavioral, and other services, \n\n- 17  \n\nand fail to provide clinically justified assessments and \ndiagnoses of psychiatric disorders.  The resultant harm to the \npatients takes many forms, among them, inadequate and \ncounterproductive treatment, serious physiological and other side \neffects from inappropriate and unnecessary medications, and \nexcessively long hospitalizations. \n1.  Medication Management \nIt is a basic tenet of generally accepted professional \nstandards of care that the use of psychotropic medication always \nshould be justified by the clinical needs of a patient. \nMetropolitan fails to ensure that its adult population is \nafforded appropriate pharmacological treatment. \nIn this regard, vulnerable patients are routinely prescribed \ninappropriate or unsafe medications without justification. \nPatients, for instance, who have documented diagnoses of alcohol \nand/or other substance abuse frequently receive high doses of \nbenzodiazepines, psychotropic drugs which are professionally \nwell-known to have a high potential for addiction.  T.E., a \npatient with severe and persistent alcoholism for almost 30 \nyears, was prescribed Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine used for \nanxiety disorders.  When interviewed, the treating psychiatrist \nwas unable to state the side effects of this medication.  It is \nwidely known by professionals that the regular administration of \nLorazepam is habit-forming and that Lorazepam is detrimental for \npatients, such as T.E., with a history of severe alcohol abuse. \nSimilarly, benzodiazepines and anticholinergic agents carry \na professionally well-known potential side effect of exacerbating \ncognitive decline.  Nevertheless, numerous patients who suffer \nfrom memory or other cognitive deficits routinely receive these \nmedications at Metropolitan.  Similarly, Metropolitan’s diabetic \npatients, obese patients, and patients with hyperlipidemia (the \npresence of excess fats or lipids in the blood) are prescribed \nmedications professionally well-known to aggravate these \nconditions.  Based upon documentation and interviews, it does not \nappear that these medications are justified or that the \npsychiatrists have considered safer and equally effective \nmedications for these patient populations. \nIn this regard, numerous Metropolitan patients, such as L.I. \nand U.H., have received older, so-called “typical” antipsychotic \nmedications, such as haldol decanoate and lithium, for several \nyears, without either improvement in their condition or \ndocumentation in their chart indicating that other, more commonly \nused “atypical” antipsychotic medications were considered or \nattempted.  As a group, atypical antipsychotic medications are \n\n- 18  \n\ngenerally regarded as equally effective as conventional \nantipsychotics, while having a lower propensity to produce \nmovement disorders, such as drug-induced Parkinsonism (muscular \nrigidity, tremors, restricted speech, and gait disturbance), \ndystonia (uncontrollable muscle spasms), and tardive dyskinesia \n(“TD”) (involuntary, aimless movements of the tongue, face, \nmouth, jaw, or other body parts).  Further, atypicals are \ngenerally considered to have a lower risk of producing cognitive \ndysfunction and akathisia (restlessness, subjective distress and \nagitation), than conventional medications, and, in some \ninstances, may have therapeutic effects on TD.  Accordingly, as a \ngeneral matter, atypicals are the first choice among \nantipsychotic medications, and it is a gross deviation from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care, absent \nindividual considerations, to initiate a patient on conventional \nantipsychotic medications. \nFurther, the use of multiple medications to address the same \ncondition (“polypharmacy”), while possibly appropriate in some \ncircumstances, always should be clinically justified.  In many \ncases, including those of T.E., F.I., and S.G., Metropolitan’s \nuse of polypharmacy is unjustified.  Unjustified polypharmacy can \npotentially harm patients by exposing them to, among others \nrisks, unnecessary medication, harmful side effects, and harmful \ndrug-to-drug interactions. \nIndependent of the fact that patients frequently are \nmedicated based upon clinically unjustified diagnoses, we note \nthat Metropolitan’s medication guidelines do not meet generally \naccepted professional standards of care.  See 42 C.F.R. \n§ 482.25(b).  Significant protocols for medication usage and \nmanagement of side effects are outdated and incomplete.  We would \nalso flag for the State’s consideration that generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care dictate that facilities such as \nMetropolitan use appropriate procedures to ensure patients are \nafforded safe and effective pharmacological treatment, including \nmechanisms to:  (a) monitor practitioners’ adherence to drug \nmedication guidelines (“drug utilization evaluation” or “DUE”); \n(b) report and analyze adverse drug reactions (“ADR”); and \n(c) report, analyze, and document actual and potential variances\nin medication use (“medication variance reporting” or “MVR”). \nSee Id.  Metropolitan fails to meet these standards of care. \nAdding to this lack of protections, the functions of the two \ncommittees that are to provide oversight of medication use at \nMetropolitan - the Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee (“P&T”) and \nthe Therapeutics Review Committee(“TRC”) – are poorly \ncoordinated, overlapping, and disconnected.  As a result, neither \ncommittee performs the critical, comprehensive review of \n\n- 19  \n\nmedication practices that is essential at a facility such as \nMetropolitan to assure adequate and safe treatment. \n2.  Side Effect Monitoring \nMetropolitan fails to assess or monitor adequately side \neffects of medications and in particular the side effect TD.  TD \nis associated with prolonged treatment with conventional \nantipsychotic medications.  Metropolitan’s psychiatrists are not \nadequately tracking patients’ signs and symptoms of TD, nor are \nthey adhering to appropriate precautions.  In fact, without \njustification, these psychiatrists prescribe medications that are \nprofessionally known to be the main causes of TD to patients with \na diagnosis and history of TD.  This practice is a substantial \ndeparture from  generally accepted professional standards of \ncare.  Relatedly, the hospital’s internal pharmacological \nconsultant agreed that certain medications, in particular \nanticholinergic agents, are over-prescribed at Metropolitan and \nthat their use risks aggravating patients’ TD. \nMoreover, Metropolitan’s psychiatrists often appear to be \nconfused as to which medications are associated with particular \nside effects.  For example, N.S.’s psychiatrist told us that \n“Cogentin protects from TD,” when this medication actually is \nprofessionally well-known to be detrimental for patients with TD, \nbecause it masks TD symptoms.  When asked if Clozapine has any \neffects on the cardiovascular system, S.E.’s psychiatrist \nresponded “[i]t is missing my mind [sic].”  Cardiovascular \neffects are, in fact, the most common side effect of treatment \nwith Clozapine.  Moreover, Metropolitan’s psychiatrists appear to \nconfuse their role in monitoring side effects.  One psychiatrist \nstated that he had sought a neurology consultation to rule out \nTD, although the detection of TD is generally accepted among \nprofessionals to be a core psychiatric competency. \nB.  Psychology Services \nMetropolitan’s provision of psychological services to its \nadult patients is fundamentally at odds with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care.  As discussed at Section II, \nabove, assessments and evaluations that should shape \npsychological and other supports and services frequently are \nincomplete, inaccurate, and outdated and, consequently, are \nunreliable in identifying important elements of the patient’s \ncondition and shaping adequate interventions.  Interventions \noften do not address assessed needs regarding functional skills \nand maladaptive behaviors, and those interventions actually \naddressing such needs typically are poorly conceived, excessively \ngeneric, and untherapeutic.  The stated goals of psychological \n\n- 20  \n\ninterventions, which should serve to measure patient progress, \nare frequently inappropriate and unmeasurable.  Further, the \nimplementation of interventions is inconsistent and essentially \nunmonitored.  For these reasons, interventions are not revised to \naccount for patient progress or lack thereof.  These deficiencies \nare irreconcilable with generally accepted professional standards \nof care and expose patients to harm and to risk of harm. \n1.  Psychosocial/Rehabilitative Interventions \nThe purpose of psychosocial and rehabilitative interventions \nis to improve a patient’s ability to engage in more independent \nlife functions, so that he can better manage the consequences of \npsychiatric distress and avoid decompensation in more integrated \nsettings.  To be effective, these interventions should address \nthe patient’s needs and should build on the patient’s existing \nstrengths.  Further, according to generally accepted professional \nstandards of care, they should occur at regular, frequent \nintervals.  Nevertheless, it appears from our extensive chart \nreview that, at Metropolitan, rehabilitative and psychosocial \ninterventions are largely driven by what is available on a \nparticular unit, not what is appropriate for a given patient, and \noccur on an irregular and infrequent basis.  Metropolitan’s off-\nunit Stepping Stones and Psychosocial Rehabilitation programs \nwere exceptions to this, but they are unavailable to the bulk of \nthe facility’s population. \nOn the units themselves, patients most typically are \nassigned to groups depending upon what is available and what \nstaff feel the patient can tolerate, regardless of need or \nindication.  In this regard, many patients have a critical need \nfor specialized treatment for problems such as substance abuse, a \nrecognized psychiatric disorder, in addition to their underlying \nmental illness.  The failure to provide specialized treatment for \nthese dually diagnosed patients is a substantial departure from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care.  Nevertheless, \nMetropolitan often fails to identify and assess dually diagnosed \npatients.  For instance, F.I. was not diagnosed with substance \nabuse although her psychiatric assessment included information \nthat she has a history of this problem.  Similarly, N.T.’s \npsychiatric assessment indicated an extensive history of \nsubstance abuse, with sobriety for the past four years.  The \npsychiatrist, however, did not identify her substance abuse \nhistory. \nEven when identified and assessed, treatment plans do not \naddress the needs of these patients.  Substance abuse groups, for \ninstance, were not scheduled for some patients in serious need of \nsuch interventions while relatively stable patients with remote \n\n- 21  \n\nhistories but no recent substance abuse were scheduled for this. \nFor example, C.Nj., a 27-year-old man whose parents were both \nsubstance abusers and who himself has a long history of \npolysubstance dependence, had no interventions addressing this \nproblem in his treatment plan, and there were no substance abuse \ngroups on his schedule.  I.Q. was not assigned to a substance \nabuse group in spite of the fact that his Axis I diagnosis is \nalcohol-induced persisting dementia. \nMetropolitan patients are expected to attend the groups on \ntheir schedule, and, for the majority of patients, group \nattendance is the short-term, and often, long-term treatment \ngoal.  However, without a specific goal, or intended outcome, for \na particular treatment, it is not possible to determine whether \nthe treatment’s objective is achieved.  Further, patients’ \nresponses to treatment were virtually never recorded in treatment \nplans, social work evaluations, or rehabilitation assessments. \nThus, with respect to on-unit rehabilitation, which is all the \nrehabilitation that the majority of Metropolitan patients \nreceive, it is clear that psychiatric rehabilitation activities \nserve little purpose other than to fill the day and structure the \nunit’s operations.  This is an extraordinary failure of care. \nIn addition, on-unit rehabilitation groups are not reliably \noffered as scheduled.  We sampled 23 patients, from different \nunits, at a mid-morning or mid-afternoon time point other than \nmealtime.  Of these patients, only two clearly could be \ndetermined to be engaged in an activity.  Very few groups \noccurred as scheduled, representing a very small proportion of \npatients on each unit.  Patients spend strikingly little time in \na treatment or rehabilitation program. \n2.  Behavioral Supports \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care dictate \nthat patients receive appropriate behavioral interventions when: \n(a) their behaviors place them or others at risk of harm or\notherwise significantly limit their ability to function in a \nnoninstitutional setting; and (b) these behaviors are driven by \nfactors that are susceptible to effective behavioral \ninterventions.  A determination whether behavioral supports are \nclinically warranted begins with an assessment of the challenging \nbehavior and why it occurs. \nFor instance, to the extent that a patient’s behaviors are \npurely the result of delusions or hallucinations, behavioral \ninterventions are less likely to be appropriate.  Often, however, \nchallenging behaviors are driven by factors as simple as a need \nfor attention or an aversion to a noisy environment, factors \n\n- 22  \n\nreadily susceptible to effective behavioral interventions.  In \nany case, without an adequate assessment of why challenging \nbehaviors occur, it is not possible to determine whether \nbehavioral interventions are necessary and appropriate and, if \nso, the form those interventions should take. \nBy contrast, Metropolitan’s approach is to provide \nbehavioral supports, in the form of a “Special Treatment Plan,” \nfor patients experiencing high rates of seclusion, restraint, or \none-to-one supervision.  However, those patients who are not \ndisruptive but nevertheless have significant behavioral needs – \nsuch as extreme withdrawal, isolation, anxiety, and avoidance \nbehaviors – rarely, if ever, receive behavioral supports. \nFurther, our expert consultants identified numerous patients who, \ngiven their high rates of seclusion, restraint, or one-to-one \nsupervision, warranted behavioral supports, even according to \nMetropolitan’s practice, but nevertheless did not receive them. \nMore particularly, a sizable number of patients suffer from \nchronic illnesses that are resistant to traditional treatment, \nsuch as schizoaffective disorder and polysubstance abuse (e.g., \nL.I.), persistent disruptive or maladaptive behaviors (e.g., \nN.D.), cognitive impairments with deficits in self-care (e.g., \nT.P.), lack of motivation to participate in treatment or be \ndischarged to a lower level of care (e.g., T.Eb.), and severe and \npersistent self-abuse (e.g., F.I.) and aggression (e.g., N.Cj.; \nD.I.), that clearly clinically warranted the development of \nbehavioral plans which, in fact, were not developed. \nK.P.’s chart indicates that he has been at Metropolitan for \nmost of the past 12 years, is extremely violent at times and does \nnot have a Special Treatment Plan, apparently because the \nprevious plan was ineffective and therefore discontinued.  N.T. \nhas made several suicide attempts and repeatedly has engaged in \nself-injurious behavior, but she does not have a Special \nTreatment Plan to help her to address these behaviors.  According \nto her chart, D.N.H. has a history of yelling and screaming, \nhitting other patients and staff, and self-abusive behaviors. \nShe also may have mental retardation.  Her chart indicates that \nshe does not have a Special Treatment Plan, and it does not \nidentify any other interventions to assist her in addressing \nthese behaviors.  Metropolitan clearly is not identifying and \nproviding adequate behavioral supports for a large number of its \npatients having significant behavioral needs, and this is wholly \ninconsistent with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare. \nEven when behavioral plans are developed, they typically are \npoorly coordinated with other interventions and, on their face, \n\n- 23  \n\nare inadequate.  Analyses of behaviors are inadequate, individual \npsychotherapy is not goal-directed or individualized, and the \nplans are too simplistic to make a difference in patients who \nhave persistent and severe mental illness.  Documentation \nindicates that psychiatrists are not aware of their patients’ \nbehavioral plans, nor is there any integration of these plans and \nthe patients’ pharmacological treatment.  N.Cb.’s Special \nTreatment Plan highlights this lack of integration.  It \nsystematically withdraws his access to treatment groups which he \nenjoys and which presumably are intended to help him, independent \nof his behavioral control problems. \nPatients in need of this treatment are not only denied \nadequate treatment and, consequently, exposed to prolonged \nhospitalization, but also exposed to potentially serious risks of \nphysical harm.  In 2001, D.S. swallowed batteries, screws, \npackets of mustard, and paper, resulting in surgery in December \n2001 to remove these objects.  So long as D.S. is denied adequate \nand effective treatment, he is at continued risk of this \nbehavior.  Similarly, so long as D.D., who has a history of \naggression, does not receive effective, integrated treatment, \nboth he and his fellow patients are at continued risk of \nassaultive behavior, and he likely will be subject to ongoing \nrestraint and seclusion as a result of this behavior.  K.Ej. is \nat continued risk of self-abusive behaviors so long as she does \nnot receive a behavioral therapy program. \nC.  Nursing and Unit-Based Services \nMetropolitan’s adult unit nursing services are \nirreconcilable with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare and treatment.  Nursing and other unit staff fail to \nadequately:  (a) monitor, document, and report patients’ \nsymptoms; (b) document the administration of medications; (c) \nprovide a therapeutic environment; and (d) participate in the \ntreatment team process.  These deficiencies expose patients to \nharm and a significant risk of harm. \nMany nursing and unit staff appear to lack adequate support, \ntraining, and supervision.  Metropolitan leadership does not \nencourage these staff to communicate with other team members to \nanticipate and minimize problems.  Consequently, nursing and unit \nstaff respond to patient needs in a largely reactive way, often \nsubjecting Metropolitan’s patients to excessive and inappropriate \nuses of medication, seclusion and restraints, inadequate and \nineffective therapeutic interventions, and needlessly long \nhospitalization. \n\n- 24  \n\n1.  Monitoring, Documenting, and Reporting Symptoms \nAs indicated in Section I, above, for the treatment team to \nevaluate the adequacy of implemented interventions, staff must \nmonitor, document, and report patients’ symptoms.  For \npsychiatrists to prescribe medications and psychologists and \ntherapists to properly oversee therapeutic interventions, they \nmust rely upon nursing and other unit staff to document and \nreport symptomology. \nAs noted at Section I, above, Metropolitan treatment plans \ndo not adequately define the criteria or target variables by \nwhich treatments and interventions are to be assessed, nor do the \nplans identify how and when these factors should be monitored. \nConsequently, nursing and unit staff do not monitor patients’ \nproblems and symptoms adequately, and treatment teams lack \nsignificant information regarding the efficacy of interventions. \nFurther, we found no formal documentation system or \nobjective exchange of substantive information between staff \nduring shift changes or at other relevant times.  Without a \nreliable system of recording and tracking patients’ progress \nrelative to identified goals and problems, chart entries \nregarding a patient’s status have little value.  Metropolitan’s \nlack of substantive documentation and information regarding \npatient progress hinders the provision of adequate treatment, \nneedlessly exposing patients to potentially ineffective \ninterventions and prolonging their institutionalization. \n2.  Medication Administration \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care require \nthat staff properly complete the Medication Administration \nRecords (“MARs”).  MARs list the current medications, dosages, \nroutes, and times that medications are to be administered. \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care also dictate \nthat staff sign the MARs at the time the medication is \nadministered.  Completing the MARS properly is fundamental to \nmaintaining patient safety and reducing the likelihood of \nmedication errors and adverse drug effects.  If staff members \nfail to document the medications they are administering, it may \nresult in patients not receiving medications or receiving \nmedications multiple times.  Further, generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care require that all “controlled” \nsubstances be signed out on the control log and that there be an \naccurate count at all times of such medications. \nDuring our tours, we observed a number of instances in which \nstaff failed to sign the MARs for medications that reportedly had \n\n- 25  \n\nbeen administered.  In addition, controlled medications were \nadministered without staff signing the control log.  Staff’s \nfailure to properly sign the MARs or the control log should be \nconsidered a medication error and documented as such, and follow-\nup should occur to reduce the likelihood that such errors will \ncontinue to occur.  However, Metropolitan fails to follow such \nprocedures. \nMoreover, generally accepted professional standards of care \ndictate that staff who administer medication know:  (a) what the \nmedication is for; (b) its expected results and their timing; and \n(c) the symptoms of the disorder that it is targeting. \nMetropolitan’s nurses generally are unfamiliar with the purposes \nof the medication they administer and unable to identify the \nexpected results or their timing.  Also, a number of nurses we \ninterviewed were unable to identify the symptoms associated with \nthe disorder for which a particular medication was prescribed. \nIf nurses do not understand patients’ disorders or the purposes \nof the medications that they are administering, they lack \ninformation fundamental to their responsibilities to assess and \nreport their patients’ progress.  This shortcoming is a \nsubstantial departure from generally accepted professional \nstandards of care, and places residents at risk of harm from \nineffective or inappropriate treatment interventions. \nFinally, while not necessarily rising to the level of a \nviolation of federal law, we flag for the State’s consideration \nthat staff administering medications were not observed to \nproperly educate patients about their medications, the expected \neffects or the expected side effects.  These failures are not \nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare. \n3.  Provision of Therapeutic Activity \nAt Metropolitan, nursing and unit staff generally do not \nappear to understand their roles in the therapeutic process, nor \ndo they appear to be familiar with basic therapeutic tools or \ntreatment modalities.  In this regard, we observed a number of \nskilled nursing facility (“SNF”) unit patients in their beds \nduring the day time with the privacy curtains pulled around them \nand their doors closed.  It appeared that they had not had \ncontact with anyone for hours.  From our observations, \nMetropolitan was not providing any stimulation or therapeutic \nactivities for these individuals.  This complete lack of \ninteraction for patients such as these, with cognitive and memory \ndeficits, causes harm in that it exacerbates their symptoms. \n\n- 26  \n\nEven more critically, some patients, such as E.D. and K.E., \nare bed-bound.  We saw no indication that Metropolitan staff \nassisted them to get out of bed on a daily basis.  Generally \naccepted professional standards of care require that patients be \nassisted out of bed on a daily basis, unless there is a medically \njustified and documented reason to maintain the person in a “bed \nbound” status.  We did not find such justification for either of \nthese patients.  Among other concerns, prolonged periods in a \nsupine position places patients at serious risk of skin \nbreakdown.  This failure is at odds with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care. \nD.  Pharmacy \nIt is generally accepted professional practice for \npharmacists to review individual patients’ medication regimens on \na regular, at least quarterly, basis.  Such a review should \nencompass all of the medications prescribed (not just psychiatric \ndrugs and “as-needed” (also known as “pro re nata” or “PRN”) \nmedications) and should include documentation of any \ncommunication between the pharmacists and physicians regarding \nconcerns, potential medication interactions, and the need for \nlaboratory testing.  Metropolitan pharmacists review patients’ \nmedication regimens, for example, when new medication orders are \nissued or lab results are returned.  However, they are not \nsystematically reviewing patients’ medication regimens. \nMoreover, when pharmacists’ review of medications does identify \nproblems, adequate follow-up does not occur to ensure that \nphysicians have reviewed the pharmacists’ recommendations and \ntaken appropriate action.  Numerous Pharmacy Intervention forms \nwe reviewed identified problems and actions that needed to be \ntaken, such as the completion of laboratory work.  However, we \nwere unable to confirm from the documentation provided that such \nactions actually were taken in a timely manner.  This is a \nsignificant deviation from generally accepted professional \nstandards of care.  These failures are particularly troubling, \ngiven the unjustified and outdated combinations of medications \nthat often are prescribed for Metropolitan’s patients. \nE.  General Medical Services \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care dictate \nthat patients be provided adequate and timely preventative, \nroutine, specialized, and emergency medical services. \nMetropolitan’s provision of general medical care, however, \ndeviates substantially from these standards.  Metropolitan has \nnot adequately defined the primary care physicians’ \nresponsibilities, nor the triggers for initial assessments, \n\n- 27  \n\nongoing care, and re-assessments.  It has not established \nprotocols governing physician-nurse communication, or mechanisms \nintegrating patients’ mental health and medical care. \nBecause staff fail to monitor, document, and report \npatients’ symptoms, treatment teams lack objective data to \ndetermine whether treatments addressing patients’ general medical \nissues should be modified.  Many patients receive unspecific or \nvague diagnoses that contribute to inadequate, inappropriate, or \nno medical treatment.  For instance, diagnoses such as “Other \nConvulsions,” given to K.D., K.Eb., M.C., E.D., K.E., Ep.G., and \nU.O., and “Paralysis, Unspecified,” given to M.C. and X.F., are \nnot adequate to guide treatment.  Further, Metropolitan lacks a \nmeans to obtain medical records consistently from hospitals \nproviding treatment to Metropolitan patients. \nSeparately, Metropolitan’s after-hours medical coverage \nplaces patients at serious risk of harm in the case of a \npsychiatric emergency.  It is a generally accepted professional \nstandard of care in an in-patient facility such as Metropolitan \nthat at least one psychiatrist be on-site at all times or, at a \nminimum, be available by telephone and able to come to the \nfacility as needed.  At Metropolitan, after-hours medical \ncoverage (typically from 5 p.m. - 8 a.m.) is provided by primary \ncare physicians without any psychiatry support.  Moreover, \naccording to the chairman of psychiatry and six staff \npsychiatrists, these physicians have not been formally \n“privileged” in psychiatry.  Rather, “they basically learn on the \njob.”  Physicians who are not “privileged” in psychiatry have not \nreceived critical training in psychiatry or in dealing with \npsychiatric emergencies, including the assessment of \ndangerousness, suicidality, or behavioral disorders that may \nrequire restrictive interventions.  Such a practice assumes that \npsychiatric emergencies do not occur after-hours, is a gross \ndeviation from generally accepted professional standards of care, \nand places patients at great risk of harm. \nThere are numerous instances in which Metropolitan has \nfailed to provide necessary medical care to its patients.  For \nexample, T.N. inserted a metal object into her abdomen.  The \nobject was never removed, causing an abscess on her abdomen and \nsevere abdominal pain.  E.E., an ambulatory patient, fell in \nApril, 2001, while at Metropolitan, fracturing his right femur. \nThe community hospital determined that he was “not a candidate” \nfor repair of his femur.  That hospital also detected a mass in \nhis left lung but failed to perform a biopsy.  As of May, 2002, \nMetropolitan had never questioned the community hospital’s \ndeterminations or ordered a biopsy.  Further, since this injury, \n\n- 28 -\n\nE.E. has been permanently bed-bound, has experienced multiple\nbouts of pneumonia, has been placed on a feeding tube and has had \nnumerous pressure sores, ranging in severity from Stage II (which \ninvolve a partial loss of skin layer that presents clinically as \nan abrasion, blister, or shallow crater) to Stage IV (meaning \nsoft tissue is exposed to the bone, the most severe \nclassification of pressure ulcers). \nF.  Infection Control \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care require \nthat infections and communicable diseases be tracked and trended \nin an institutional setting such as Metropolitan.  When analysis \nof trends reveals potential problems, it is standard practice for \ncorrective action plans to be developed and implemented. \nAfter we stated in our May 13, 2003 letter that Metropolitan \ndoes not systemically track or trend infections or communicable \ndiseases, the State referred us to infection control committee \nminutes indicating that Metropolitan does track infections and \ncommunicable diseases.  However, neither in our interview of one \nof the facility’s two infection control nurses nor in any \ndocumentation that we reviewed, including the infection control \ncommittee minutes, were we able to detect that the facility takes \nappropriate interventions to minimize the risk of infections. \nFor instance, we saw no evidence that the facility monitors \nliving units for infectious contaminants and takes measures to \neliminate or prevent such contaminants, although generally \naccepted professional standards of care dictate that this be \nperformed as part of a standard infection control program.  In \nfact, the infection control nurse told us that infections are \naddressed on an individual basis (although, here again, we saw no \ndocumentation in the numerous charts that we reviewed indicating \nthat nurses had provided treatment or education to an individual \npatient to resolve an infection and prevent its reoccurrence). \nIn this regard, as noted in Section VII, below, we saw urine-\nsoaked laundry on the floors of patients’ bedrooms and in \nuncovered bins in patient-inhabited areas.  The obvious presence \nof such potential infection sources in living units is at odds \nwith adequate infection controls and places patients at risk of \nharm from infection.  We further note that it also did not appear \nthat the facility’s quality assurance system amalgamated and \nassessed its infection control data. \n\n- 29  \n\nG.  Dental Services \nAt Metropolitan, dental care substantially departs from \ngenerally accepted professional standards.  Consequently, \npatients experience harm and are at risk of harm. \nMany Metropolitan patients’ dental health deteriorates \nbecause of long delays in, or the complete absence of, dental \ntreatment.  These deficiencies appear to be caused by, among \nother factors, Metropolitan’s failure to:  (a) take patients to \ndental appointments; (b) identify and address the causes for \npatient refusals to participate in dental appointments; and \n(c) follow-up on recommendations made by the dentist.  Patients \nwhose dental care appears to have been compromised because of \nthese factors include Tu.Q., E.H., K.N., Q.C., Kb.N., F.E., \nKp.E., Mz.H., Dm.D., O.U., X.F., X.X., M.C., C.Hb., T.N., U.O., \nK.B., C.W., K.Ep., and I.Q. \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care also \ndictate that appropriate efforts be made to restore patients’ \nnatural teeth before resorting to the irreversible extraction of \nteeth.  However, several Metropolitan patients, including K.P., \nM.C., B.M., S.N., U.H., Tu.Q., N.G., and E.H., have had teeth \nextracted without adequate clinical justification to support such \ndecisions. \nFurther, to avoid medical complications, it is essential \nthat the dentist take account of diseases, medications, and \nphysical disabilities that have a major impact on dental health. \nIndividuals with diabetes, for example, may be at increased risk \nfor developing mouth infections.  They may also take longer to \nheal from dental procedures, increasing their risk of infection. \nIndividuals with certain cardiovascular conditions, such as \nmitral valve prolapse, need to receive certain antibiotics prior \nto undergoing dental procedures to prevent an infection of the \nlining of the heart, which can be life-threatening.  However, \nMetropolitan often fails to document significant health \ninformation in its patients’ dental records that would indicate \nthat its dentists have accounted for such important factors in \nproviding treatment.  In addition, it is a generally accepted \nprofessional standard of care that dentists document their \nfindings and their plan of care.  Metropolitan rarely maintains \nadequate documentation in these areas.  As a result, patients are \nat risk of receiving inadequate treatment and/or treatment that \njeopardizes their physical health. \n\n- 30  \n\nH.  Physical and Occupational Therapy \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care provide \nthat patients who require physical therapy (“PT”) or occupational \ntherapy (“OT”) to regain, maintain, or improve functioning \nreceive such services in a timely manner in accordance with an \nindividualized plan of care.  This plan of care should be \nintegrated into the patient’s overall treatment plan.  In \naddition to the direct services provided by the physical and/or \noccupational therapists, PT and OT programs should be \nincorporated into patients’ daily activities, whenever \nappropriate. \nAs with other treatment plan goals and objectives, it is a \ngenerally accepted professional standard of care that PT and OT \ngoals and objectives be measurable, observable, and functional. \nAlthough many of Metropolitan’s OT goals appear to meet this \ncriteria, many of its PT goals do not, making it impossible to \ndetermine if patients have met their goals or if the goals are \nappropriate to meet their needs.  Moreover, generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care require that physical and \noccupational therapists provide staff with clear, individualized \nguidelines regarding positioning and transferring patients who \ncannot complete these activities independently.  This is \nessential to both patient and staff safety.  Metropolitan has no \nsuch guidelines.  These deficiencies depart largely from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care. \nOther impediments to patients receiving adequate PT and OT \nservices are Metropolitan’s failures to take them to scheduled \nappointments, provide adequate staffing, or address appropriately \npatients’ refusals to participate in PT and/or OT sessions. \nNumerous appointments for numerous patients are cancelled due to \na lack of transportation, patient refusals, or patients or staff \nbeing “unavailable” at the time of the appointments.  Examples of \npatients who experienced these issues include B.N., N.Q., S.Q., \nEf.H., D.B., Cj.D., E.H., and O.K. \nStaff on certain units stated that they require patients to \nuse wheelchairs because they are afraid that walkers and canes \ncould be used as weapons.  However, we found no evidence that \nMetropolitan had completed assessments to determine whether \nindividual patients could use canes and walkers safely on their \nunits, or if the patients could be placed on another unit where \nsuch adaptive equipment could be used safely.  Other patients, \nsuch as S.M., are blind and could utilize walking canes to \nincrease their level of independent mobility, but Metropolitan \nhas not provided them with the equipment or the requisite \n\n- 31  \n\ntraining.  Rather than promoting patients’ independence, \nMetropolitan’s practices are fostering their functional decline. \nWheelchairs need to be fitted properly for the individuals \nusing them.  A number of patients, such as M.C. are in \nwheelchairs that do not fit them and, consequently, provide \ninadequate postural support and body alignment that can result in \ninjury or medical complications.  For instance, patients \ndiagnosed with Huntington’s Chorea are at risk of contracting \nrespiratory diseases.  When placed in a wheelchair providing \nincorrect postural support, their risk may be significantly \nincreased.  We observed one such patient, S.U., seated in a \nwheelchair with his posture collapsed, making it more difficult \nfor him to breathe. \nI.  Dietary Services \nMetropolitan’s dietary services substantially depart from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care, which require \nthat patients’ weight and other dietary issues be addressed \ncomprehensively by their treatment teams.  Medical conditions \nsuch as hypertension or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease \n(“COPD”) can be exacerbated by obesity, and many of the \nmedications that Metropolitan frequently uses, such as Depakote, \nThorazine, and Haldol can cause significant weight gain. \nFurther, the charts of several Metropolitan adult patients \nprescribed such medications, such as E.E., Mz.H., Q.C., N.K., and \nF.E., indicate that these patients are at risk of significant \nhealth problems because of their weight.  However, most of the \ntreatment plans that we reviewed for patients appearing to have \nsignificant weight problems did not address their weight. \nFurther, the treating psychiatrist and the treatment teams did \nnot appear to consider a patient’s weight when determining which \npsychotropic medications to prescribe. \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care dictate \nthat individuals at risk of aspirating be evaluated adequately \nand have mealtime protocols developed by their treatment team \nthat include specific instructions for staff on topics such as \nthe texture of the food, the patient’s position during and \nimmediately after meals, and the level of supervision staff need \nto provide.  These protocols also should address other activities \ninvolving swallowing, such as tooth brushing, dental \nappointments, and medication administration.  Finally, staff \nresponsible for implementing these protocols must be able to do \nso correctly.  Metropolitan’s services in this regard \nsubstantially depart from generally accepted professional \nstandards of care. \n\n- 32  \nIt appears that a number of Metropolitan patients with \naspiration problems, such as X.F., B.M., E.E., Q.C., E.T., \nD.N.H., N.K., H.S., Kv.Q., M.C., C.K., S.U., E.D., and T.T., lack \nthese protections.  In some cases, evaluations had been completed \nwhich clearly identified serious problems, but Metropolitan had \nfailed to follow-up on the resulting recommendations.  It appears \nthat no specific, individualized mealtime protocols are available \nfor staff who are assisting patients to eat, and we saw no \nmechanism enabling staff to identify those patients who are at \nhigh risk for aspiration.  Nor was there any indication that such \npatients are adequately monitored.  We also found no \nindividualized written instructions regarding other activities \ninvolving swallowing for patients at risk for aspiration. \nConsequently, it appears that Metropolitan’s patients with \naspiration problems are at risk of harm. \nIn addition, at the time of our visit, there were six \npatients on the SNF units who were fed by tubes.  Generally \naccepted professional standards of care for such individuals \nrequire that efforts be made to address the underlying causes of \nthe person’s inability to eat by mouth so that these feeding \ntubes, which, among other concerns, pose infection risks, can be \nremoved.  However, we found no evidence these activities were \noccurring at Metropolitan.  As a result, these patients are at \nrisk of long-term, unjustified use of feeding tubes. \nV.  DOCUMENTATION OF PATIENT PROGRESS \nAs noted in Section II.A, above, Metropolitan’s \npsychiatrists do not chart their patients’ progress with \nsufficient frequency.  Further, the substance of the \npsychiatrists’ progress notes at Metropolitan grossly departs \nfrom generally accepted professional standards of care. \nPsychiatrists often fail to:  (a) document significant \ndevelopments in their patient’s condition; (b)describe target \nsymptoms; (c) identify a patient’s response to treatments; (d) \ndocument rationales for changes in pharmacological treatment; (e) \nidentify medication side effects; (f) assess the use of PRN \nmedications; (g) explain changes in diagnoses; (h) explain the \nrationale for polypharmacy; and (i) assess the patient’s \ncompetence on an ongoing basis.  These deficiencies directly \nimpede adequate assessment of patients’ progress and evolving \nneeds during hospitalization and indirectly lead to ineffective \nand even harmful treatment. \nIn fact, the progress notes of Metropolitan’s psychiatrists \noften suggest unfamiliarity with patients’ status.  For instance, \non numerous occasions F.I.’s psychiatrist wrote that she was \n\n- 33  \n\nstable, without noting that she had been in seclusion and/or \nrestraints that same month for being assaultive or self-abusive. \nSimilarly, in August 2002, N.Cj. reportedly swallowed batteries \nand was referred to a medical consultant.  The psychiatrist’s \nsubsequent progress notes ignore this event and report nothing \nabout the status of the medical follow-up.  The 2001 monthly \nprogress notes for K.E. contain no justification for the \npatient’s medication regimen, fail to mention a number of his \nmedications, and include no discussion of his frequent use of \n“as-needed” (also known as pro re nata or “PRN”) medication or \nhis response to treatment. \nVI.  RESTRAINTS, SECLUSION AND “AS-NEEDED” MEDICATIONS \nMetropolitan’s use of seclusion, restraints, and “as-needed” \nmedications for its adult patients substantially departs from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care and exposes \nthose patients to excessive and unnecessarily restrictive \ninterventions.  Generally accepted professional standards of care \ndictate that seclusion and restraints:  (a) will be used only \nwhen persons pose an immediate safety threat to themselves or \nothers and after a hierarchy of less restrictive measures has \nbeen considered and/or exhausted; (b) will not be used in the \nabsence of, or as an alternative to, active treatment, as \npunishment, or for the convenience of staff; (c) will not be used \nas a behavioral intervention, and (d) will be terminated as soon \nas the person is no longer a danger to himself or others. \nGenerally accepted professional standards also instruct that PRN \npsychotropic medications should be used only as a short-term \nmeasure to relieve a patient in acute distress, not as means to \nescape mild, possibly healthy, discomfort or as a repeatedly \ndeployed substitute for treatment. \nMetropolitan uses seclusion, restraints, and PRN medications \nfor its adult patients in the absence of adequate treatment and, \nin some instances, as punishment.  Many instances of seclusion, \nrestraints, or PRN medication result from adult patients \nexhibiting symptoms of their mental health disorders.  Without \nthe benefit of appropriate medication and therapeutic \ninterventions, patients lack the means to control such symptoms. \nThus, inadequate mental health treatment exposes patients to \nexcessive use of seclusion, restraints, or PRN medications. \nMoreover, we found numerous incidents in which patients exhibited \nbehaviors that initially were not a danger to themselves or \nothers, but which escalated with staff involvement into dangerous \nsituations.  We also found that documentation often did not show \nthat staff first attempted less restrictive interventions before \nusing seclusion, restraints, or PRN medications. \n\n- 34  \n\nWhen seclusion, restraints or PRN medications are frequently \nused, it is generally accepted professional practice for the \ntreatment team to reassess interventions and, as necessary, \nmodify the treatment plan to ensure that adequate measures are \nidentified and implemented.  Frequent use of seclusion, \nrestraints and/or PRN medications is an indicator that an \nindividual’s diagnosis is erroneous and/or that the treatment \nplan is inappropriate.  Metropolitan fails to review routinely \nits adult patients’ treatment plans after such episodes. \nNumerous patient charts identify frequent episodes of \nseclusion, restraint, or PRN medication without related \ndocumentation indicating that the team adequately assessed the \npatient, developed and/or reviewed the treatment plan, or \nconsidered alternative interventions.  For example, D.I. was in \nwalking restraints 24-hours-a-day for almost the entire month of \nMarch 2002, and was in restraints another 41 times between April \n7 and November 11, 2002.  T.N. was placed in wrist and ankle \nwalking restraints continuously April 27 through 29, 2002, and \nagain from April 30 through May 9, 2002. U.H. was placed in \nseclusion and/or restraints on 25 occasions between February 8 \nand November 13, 2002, with restraint episodes lasting between 30 \nminutes and 23 hours.  D.D. was kept in walking restraints 24-\nhours-a-day April 1 through May 3, 2002, and again May 9 through \n12, 2002.  For over six months between January and July 2002, \nC.X. was kept in walking restraints during waking hours and\nplaced in a locked seclusion room to sleep.  It appears that no \nmechanism was in place to alert treatment teams to these \nincidents of seclusion and restraint, and that treatment teams \ndid not meet routinely to review and modify, as appropriate, the \ntreatment interventions of these patients.  We also could not \nlocate documentation indicating that other, less restrictive \nalternatives had been attempted prior to restraining or secluding \npatients. \nFurther, Metropolitan fails to comply with generally \naccepted professional standards of care that require physicians \nor other licensed medical practitioners to conduct face-to-face \nassessments of patients placed in seclusion or restraints within \none hour of the initiation of the seclusion and/or restraints. \nD.I.’s chart indicates that he was placed in seclusion and/or \nrestraints at least five times in October 2001 without a signed \nphysician’s order denoting a face-to-face assessment within the \nrequired time frame, and on February 2, 2002, he was kept in \nseclusion and/or restraints for more than 11 continuous hours \nwithout a timely assessment by a physician.  L.T. was placed in \nphysical restraints seven times between November 10 and December \n29, 2001, without a physician’s assessment, including one episode \n\n- 35  \nthat lasted 24 hours.  U.Cs. was placed in seclusion and \nrestraints at least 14 times between February 25 and September 8, \n2001, without evidence in his chart of any face-to-face \nassessments. \nAccording to generally accepted professional standards of \ncare, bed side rails constitute physical restraints.  Patients, \nparticularly those experiencing significant cognitive \ndifficulties, can become entangled in side rails when attempting \nto exit beds, and can be severely injured or killed, as a result. \nWhere side rails are used, they must be part of a patient’s \ntreatment plan that reflects that they are the least restrictive \nintervention then available and that alternative interventions \nare being explored to obviate their need.  During our tours of \nthe SNF units during the day, evening, and night shifts, most \npatients had their side rails up when they were in bed.  None of \nthe treatment plans reviewed for these patients documented that \nthey were the least restrictive intervention.  Moreover, there \nwas no indication that Metropolitan had attempted to reduce the \nuse of side rails and/or identify other, less dangerous \nalternatives.  This places patients at risk of harm.  Likewise, \nvest and soft wrist restraints should not be used without proper \nassessments that justify the need for them, and without treatment \nplans that include interventions designed to eliminate or \nminimize their use.  Metropolitan is regularly using vest and \nsoft wrist restraints with patients on the SNF units without \nproper justification and/or treatment planning. \nSeparately, as indicated in Section IV.A, above, \nMetropolitan has no parameters governing the use of PRN \nmedication.  Because Metropolitan’s psychiatrists frequently fail \nto review critically the use of PRN medications and patients’ \nreactions to them, they are unable to refine patients’ diagnoses \nand adjust routinely administered medications.  Without adequate \nmonitoring by psychiatrists of PRN medications, patients are at \nrisk of being overly and/or improperly medicated. \nFor example, psychiatrists’ failure to review adequately the \nuse of PRNs was evident in the chart of K.E., who was prescribed \none PRN medication for insomnia and two PRN medications for \nagitation.  This patient’s psychiatric progress notes fail to \njustify the use of these medications, neglect even to mention one \nof them, do not describe the frequency of the PRN medication use, \nand do not provide the patient’s response to these medications. \nThis is particularly concerning because, during the period when \nthis patient was prescribed a PRN medication for agitation, his \nchart reports that he was “weak” and “bed bound” and indicates \nthat any agitation he may have had was limited to occasional \n\n- 36  \n\nverbal outbursts in response to hands-on care.  Similarly, during \nthe treatment team meeting for S.G., a nurse reported that this \npatient had received eight PRN medications over the previous \nmonth and repeatedly had requested a change in his medication, \nbut the psychiatrist did not critically review the use of S.G.’s \nPRN medications or his reactions to them. \nVII.  PROTECTION FROM HARM \nWe indicated in our May 13, 2003 letter that we would \naddress protection from harm issues on a facility-wide basis in \nthis letter.  It is an essential component of generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care in congregate care facilities such \nas Metropolitan, to maintain an effective incident management \nsystem and a related quality assurance system to prevent harmful \nincidents and identify and correct deficiencies in care. \nHowever, Metropolitan’s systems are themselves deficient and fail \nto protect its patients from avoidable harm. \nMetropolitan also fails to provide its patients a safe \nliving environment.  As was true of Program I, Metropolitan’s \nadult units contain environmental hazards, some of which pose \nrisks of serious injury, illness, and death.  The harm that \nMetropolitan’s patients experience as a result of these \ndeficiencies is multi-faceted, including physical and \npsychological abuse; physical injury; excessive and inappropriate \nuse of physical and chemical restraints; inadequate, ineffective, \nand counterproductive treatment; and excessively long \nhospitalizations. \nA.  Incident Management \nIt is a generally accepted professional standard that, to \nensure that patients are provided a reasonably safe environment, \nfacilities such as Metropolitan maintain an effective incident \nmanagement system, including mechanisms for:  reporting; \ninvestigating thoroughly; tracking and trending; and identifying \nand monitoring implementation of appropriate corrective and \npreventative action.  Metropolitan’s incident management system \nis at odds with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare and exposes its patients to actual and potential harm. \nFacility records indicate that, in Program I, which serves \napproximately 100 children and adolescents, for the period \nbetween May 1, 2001, and March 31, 2002, there were 131 patient-\nagainst-patient assaults, 169 incidences of patients abusing \nthemselves, and 74 accidental injuries.  Between May 1, 2001, \nand April 30, 2002, there were 27 allegations of staff abuse. \n\n- 37  \nIn addition, based on an incomplete list provided by \nMetropolitan, between May 1, 2001, and April 30, 2002, there \nwere six allegations of rape and an additional 28 instances of \ninappropriate sexual contact between children and adolescents. \nOf the 28 incidents of inappropriate sexual contact, an \naggressor and/or victim was identified in 21 of them, indicating \nthey were not consensual.  During this same time period, 15 \nsuicide attempts and 23 elopements and/or attempted elopements \noccurred. \nMetropolitan’s adult patients are also frequently exposed \nto harmful incidents.  Between April 1, 2001, and March 31, \n2002, Metropolitan’s adult patients were involved in 475 \npatient-against-patient assaults, 310 incidences of patients \nabusing themselves, 304 accidental injuries, and 11 incidents of \nelopement or attempted elopement.  In addition, between May 1, \n2001, and April 30, 2002, there were 42 allegations of patient \nabuse by staff. \nMany of these incidents left patients in need of medical \ntreatment.  Between April 1, 2001, and March 31, 2002, patients \nrequired first aid on 749 occasions, more extensive medical \ntreatment on 114 occasions, and hospitalization on 61 occasions. \nSome individual examples illustrate the problem: \nOn September 11, 2001, D.H. allegedly was hit in the face \nby another patient.  D.H. was admitted to the hospital with a \ndiagnoses of facial bruising and fracture of the nose and left \neye socket.  He was scheduled for plastic surgery. \nOn January 10, 2002, although patients are not supposed to \nbe in the employee cafeteria, F.I. gained access, broke a glass \nbottle on a bench, and swallowed some of the glass, leaving her \nwith cuts in her mouth and small bits of glass in her lower \nintestine. \nOn July 27, 2002, while on compound privileges with 13 \nstaff and 134 other patients, S.W. sustained a laceration to his \nface and neck that was 22 centimeters in length and one \ncentimeter deep.  The incident report indicates that 38 sutures \nwere necessary to close the external wound and it was unknown \nhow many sutures were necessary to close the internal damage. \nS.W. reported that he was attacked from behind.  Two state-\nissued razor blades made into a weapon were found in the grass \nnear the unit’s entrance. \n\n- 38  \n\n1.  Incident Reporting \nAs the above examples indicate, Metropolitan’s patients \nfrequently are subjected to the most basic kinds of harm. \nMoreover, it appears that the frequency of these incidents is \nactually higher than what Metropolitan reports, because of \nmultiple factors.  As a threshold matter, Metropolitan’s \npolicies and procedures related to reporting and categorizing \nincidents are disjointed, uncoordinated and confusing. \nConsequently, there is a significant risk that incidents will \nnot be reported or reported correctly.  In this regard, the \nHospital Police Department’s (“HPD”) Crime Statistics Report \nincludes several incidents that were not reported or tracked by \nthe facility on its list of “Special Incidents” (which involve \nsignificant harm, such as allegations of abuse, and actual or \nattempted elopement or suicide).  Further, it appears that staff \nfrequently do not formally report Special Incidents at \nMetropolitan or report them in writing days after they occur. \nThis practice substantially departs from generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care, which require that staff who \nwitness or first discover an incident submit a written report \nbefore the end of that person’s shift. \nIncident reporting is further complicated for children and \nadolescents attending the school program.  Metropolitan \ncontracts with Los Angeles County Office of Education (“LACOE”) \nfor the provision of educational services to its children and \nadolescents.  LACOE staff have different Special Incident \nreporting requirements than Metropolitan staff, and there does \nnot appear to be a formal cooperative agreement between the two \nentities to ensure consistency in reporting.  Although \nMetropolitan and LACOE have developed informal methods for \ncommunicating about patients, it appears that some incidents \nthat occur during the school day are not recorded by the program \nunits.  Without consistent reporting, Metropolitan is unable to \nprotect its patients from harm adequately, to take appropriate \nand adequate preventative and corrective action, or to trend and \ntrack incidents comprehensively across programs. \nMoreover, generally accepted professional standards of care \ndictate that incidents be categorized consistently, so that they \ncan be reliably aggregated and analyzed.  However, \nMetropolitan’s ability to do so is significantly compromised, \nbecause its policies do not define concepts as fundamental as \nneglect or exploitation, leaving it to individual staff to \ndetermine whether incidents involve such harm.  This lack of \nclarity creates a significant risk that instances of neglect and \nexploitation will never be reported, investigated, and \n\n- 39  \n\naddressed, which is irreconcilable with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care. \n2.  Incident Investigations \nMetropolitan’s investigations vary widely in quality and, \nin many respects, substantially depart from generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care.  Metropolitan’s investigations \noften lack the necessary components of a valid investigation. \nFor instance, investigations often do not appear to reconcile \nevidence appropriately, calling into question the \ninvestigations’ conclusions.  Consequently, more often than not, \nallegations of abuse are unsubstantiated.  Also, the \ninvestigations almost never address programmatic issues that are \nnecessary to identify the underlying causes of incidents. \nConsequently, adequate corrective action cannot be taken and \nMetropolitan’s patients are needlessly exposed to risk of harm. \nIt appears that many of the program level staff, HPD staff, and \nSenior Special Investigators (“SSIs”) who share responsibility \nfor conducting investigations have not been trained adequately \nto conduct investigations in a mental health setting.  Finally, \nsome investigations are performed by staff who appear to have \nconflicts of interest.  Although SSIs are available to conduct \nindependent investigations, it appears that often cases of \nalleged abuse are investigated by unit staff, including \nsupervisors. \nWe saw numerous investigations reflecting these problems. \nTwo are illustrative.  On January 7, 2002, L.A. alleged that a \nstaff person raped her.  Without conducting or documenting a \nthorough investigation, L.A.’s treatment team concluded that the \nallegation was not credible and added a problem of “false \naccusations” to L.A.’s problem list.  Facility records do not \nindicate that this allegation was referred to an SSI for further \ninvestigation. \nAnother incident, reported on April 18, 2002, arose from \nstaff’s denial of D.O.’s request for a shower or soap to clean \nherself after being incontinent.  It escalated to staff placing \nD.O. in restraints and seclusion.  D.O. alleged that, while \nrestraining her, a staff person intentionally hurt her. \nNotwithstanding the circumstances preceding the seclusion and \nrestraint, the ensuing investigation did not address whether \nstaff appropriately implemented programmatic requirements or \nwhether changes in staff’s approach should be considered. \nFurther, the investigating staff concluded that the allegation \nwas not substantiated but did not reconcile relevant evidence \n\n- 40  \n\nnor interview all witnesses.  Finally, although the incident \ninvolved alleged abuse, it apparently was not referred to an SSI \nfor further investigation. \n3.  Incident Tracking and Trending \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care also \nrequire facilities such as Metropolitan to track and trend \nincident data to address problematic trends.  Metropolitan’s \nunder reporting of incidents obviously compromises its ability \nto trend and track incidents adequately.  Further, \nMetropolitan’s incident tracking and trending system, itself, is \nat odds with generally accepted professional standards of care. \nFor example, Metropolitan’s incident trending reports do not \ntrack important types of incidents, such as allegations of \npatient abuse by staff, neglect, rape, or other inappropriate \nsexual incidents.  Furthermore, although the summary reports \nprovide some information regarding patterns or trends, there are \na number of other potential trends and patterns that are not \nincluded but that are fundamental to identifying potential \nproblems and formulating solutions, such as which patients most \noften are victims or aggressors. \nEven when Metropolitan identifies problematic trends, we \ncould not identify evidence that adequate or appropriate \nremedies ensue.  For example, in response to high numbers of \npatient assaults resulting in staff injuries, Metropolitan \ninitiated use of an additional type of restraint, a containment \nblanket.  However, Metropolitan did not, so far as we could \ndetermine, consider and address the cause of the high numbers of \nassaults.  Likewise, Metropolitan’s Special Incident Reports \nSummaries for the period between April 1, 2001, and March 31, \n2002, identify early evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays as \npeak times for the occurrence of incidents.  However, \nMetropolitan does not appear to have investigated this trend or \nidentified strategies to address it.  Metropolitan’s failure to \ntake appropriate and timely action to address such trends and \npatterns places its patients at ongoing risk of harm. \nB.  Quality Improvement \nThroughout this letter and our May 13, 2003 correspondence, \nwe enumerate various failures at Metropolitan to provide \nadequate care and treatment for its patients.  With few \nexceptions, Metropolitan has failed to identify these problems \nindependently, or formulate and implement remedies to address \nthem.  Consequently, actual and potential sources of harm to \nMetropolitan’s patients are going unaddressed. \n\n- 41  \nAlthough at the time of our tours, Metropolitan had begun \nto engage in some quality improvement activities, these efforts \ngenerally were disjointed and inadequate.  Specifically, each of \nMetropolitan’s six programs collects data on different aspects \nof the protections, treatments, services, and supports they \nprovide, making system-wide analysis virtually impossible on all \nbut a few issues.  Moreover, most of the data Metropolitan \ncollects relates to process, not outcomes being achieved by \npatients or the adequacy of the protections, treatments, \nsupports, and services being provided.  For example, \nMetropolitan collects data about the number of restraint and/or \nseclusion episodes, but does not collect data about whether the \nuse of such procedures was clinically necessary and justified. \nSome programs collect data on the number of group therapy and/or \neducational sessions scheduled and attended, but do not collect \ndata about the outcomes achieved by patients as a result of \nattendance at these sessions as compared with their \nindividualized therapy and educational goals.  Similarly, one \nprogram (Program IV) collects data on the number of missed \nmedical appointments.  These numbers show that patients \nfrequently miss medical appointments due to patient refusal. \nHowever, it does not appear that the program analyzes the \nefforts treatment teams are taking to minimize these refusals \nand/or the adequacy of these efforts. \nMoreover, Metropolitan does not adequately or appropriately \nuse the data that it does collect.  Each program prepares and \nsubmits a Performance Improvement report on a quarterly or, \noccasionally, monthly basis.  Although these reports include \nvarious and sometimes extensive data, Metropolitan often fails \nto analyze the data to identify problematic trends or areas in \nneed of improvement.  It also often fails to conduct the further \nanalyses necessary to determine which policies, procedures, and \npractices are working, which are not, and to recommend and \nimplement actions designed to correct deficiencies and/or \nimprove performance.  Even when data indicates improvement or \npositive trends, it does not appear that Metropolitan analyzes \nsuch trends to determine which policies, procedures, and \npractices might be replicated throughout a program, or facility-\nwide. \nWe found numerous examples of quality assurance breakdowns \nindicating weaknesses in Metropolitan’s ability to identify or \ncorrect causes of actual or potential harm to patients.  For \ninstance, the July 24, 2001 Interdepartmental Performance \nImprovement Committee minutes indicate that the Committee \nidentified problems regarding the use of seclusion and \nrestraint.  A number of strategies were identified, and the \n\n- 42  \n\nCommittee made various recommendations, including revision of \nthe Managing Assaultive Behavior (“MAB”) training curriculum, \nproviding staff with additional education, and increasing the \nuse of alternatives to seclusion and restraint.  According to \nminutes provided to us, no other mention of this issue occurred \nuntil November 27, 2001, when almost identical strategies were \nidentified.  No subsequent discussion apparently occurred \nthereafter through March 26, 2002, the period that we reviewed; \nthe minutes are silent regarding implementation of the \npreviously identified strategies or recommendations, or their \nimpact on resolving the identified issues.  This apparent lack \nof follow-up is especially problematic, given the problems \nidentified in Section VI, above, regarding Metropolitan’s use of \nrestraint and/or seclusion. \nC.  Environmental Issues \nIn a facility serving people at risk of harming themselves \nor others, the environment should be kept free of hazards. \nMetropolitan has failed to meet this generally accepted \nprofessional standard of care.  As we pointed out in the \npresence of administrators who toured the adult units with us, \nthe vents and window grills on several units contained holes \nlarge enough to thread a sheet or other cloth through, placing \npatients at risk for suicide by hanging.  As on the children and \nadolescent units, some of the vents on the adult units were not \ncovered, allowing patients to access wires and other potentially \ndangerous items.  Several of the units contained other hazards, \nsuch as wires holding down seclusion beds that, if accessed by \npatients, could be used to hurt oneself or others.  In one of \nthe restraint rooms, we observed plaster on the floor that \neasily could have been swallowed by a patient. \nExamples of Metropolitan’s breakdown in environmental \nprotections include a January 17, 2001 incident in which W.T. \nwas found standing on a heater vent with torn linen tied tightly \naround his neck and attached to a bar on the window.  He jumped \nfrom the vent in an attempt to strangle himself.  By the time \nstaff arrived to assist, his face reportedly had turned a bluish \nhue.  Despite the fact that this incident clearly identified \nthat the bars on the windows are a potential suicide hazard, it \ndoes not appear that systemic action was taken to ameliorate the \nsituation.  On July 11, 2001, a peer notified staff that N.T. \nhad attempted to hang herself in her bedroom with a bed sheet \nlooped around her neck and fastened to a metal frame of a \nwindow.  Again on July 15, 2001, a peer reported to staff that \nN.T. was attempting to hang herself.  Staff found N.T. with a \nblanket tied around her neck and the other end tied to the bars \n\n- 43  \n\non the window.  Less than three months later, on October 8, \n2001, N.T. was found with a bed sheet looped around her neck and \nfastened to a metal frame of a window.  N.T. was then placed in \nseclusion and restraint.  One day earlier, staff found K.S. in \nthe bathroom with a blanket tied around his neck and the other \nend tied to the bars on the window. \nBased on both staff statements and our own observations, \nMetropolitan fails to maintain temperatures in some patient \nareas that do not pose a risk to health.  For example, during \nthe evenings, the SNF units were excessively warm.  We observed \nthat staff repositioning patients were sweating profusely. \nCommendably, staff had attempted to ameliorate the heat by \npointing fans into patient rooms, but privacy curtains were \nblocking the airflow.  Moreover, fans blowing on patients whose \nhealth is compromised, such as patients requiring skilled \nnursing care, places them at high risk for complications such as \npneumonia. \nLastly, areas throughout the facility, primarily the SNF \nunits, had a strong smell of urine and excrement.  This is a \npotential indication that patients had been sitting in their \nurine or feces for a long period of time, placing them at high \nrisk for skin breakdown.  We observed urine-soaked laundry on \nthe floors of some patients’ rooms and in uncovered bins in \npatient-inhabited areas, presenting an infection hazard. \nD.  Use of Untrained Personnel in Patient Interventions \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care for \nfacilities such as Metropolitan dictate that program staff be \nresponsible for patient treatment and care.  Although there is \nnothing improper about utilizing such security personnel to \nhandle episodic incidents of violence by residents, it is not \nappropriate to rely on security staff -- who lack mental health \ntraining -- to share material responsibility for patient \ntreatment and care. \nIt appears that treatment staff frequently rely on officers \nbecause staff cannot effectively address patients’ behavioral \nneeds.  This practice highlights weaknesses in Metropolitan’s \ntherapeutic interventions and presents substantial risk of harm \nto patients.  First, given that the officers are armed with \npepper spray and batons, their presence on the units presents a \nsafety risk if a patient were to gain control of these weapons. \nSecond, the officers are not trained properly to address the \n\n- 44  \n\nprogrammatic needs of patients and, as a result, are more likely \nto resort to force, placing patients at increased risk of \nrestraint or physical injury. \nVIII.  FIRST AMENDMENT AND DUE PROCESS \nAs set forth in our letter of May 13, 2003, the State \nindicated prior to our tours of Metropolitan that it would \nrefuse to allow patients to speak with the Department of Justice \nor its expert consultants unless persons acting at the direction \nof the State were present, and State representatives did, in \nfact, attend all of our discussions with patients.  The \nabridgements of patients’ First Amendment and due process rights \nidentified in our earlier letter apply with equal force to \nMetropolitan’s adult patients. \nIX.  MINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES \nTo remedy the deficiencies discussed above and to protect \nthe constitutional and federal statutory rights of the patients \nat Metropolitan, California promptly should implement the \nminimum remedial measures set forth below. \nA.\t Integrated Treatment Planning \nMetropolitan should provide its patients with integrated \ntreatment planning consistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care.  More particularly, Metropolitan \nshould: \n1.\t Develop and implement policies and procedures \nregarding the development of treatment plans \nconsistent with generally accepted professional \nstandards of care, as set forth in Section I, \nabove. \n2.\t Use these policies and procedures to review and \nrevise, as appropriate, each patient’s treatment \nplan to ensure that it is current, \nindividualized, strengths-based, outcome-driven, \nand emanates from an integration of the \nindividual disciplines’ assessments of patients. \n3.\t Revise treatment plans as appropriate, based on \nsignificant developments in patients’ conditions, \nincluding patients’ progress, or lack thereof, as \ndetermined by the scheduled monitoring of \nidentified criteria or target variables. \n\n- 45  \n\n4.\t Ensure that treating psychiatrists verify, in a \ndocumented manner, that psychiatric and \nbehavioral treatments are properly integrated. \n5.\t Require all clinical staff to complete \nsuccessfully competency-based training on the \ndevelopment and implementation of \ninterdisciplinary treatment plans. \n6.\t Ensure that each treatment team has a stable core \nof members, includes other members as needed, and \nmaintains case loads that are not excessive. \nB.\t Assessments \nMetropolitan should ensure that its patients receive \naccurate, complete, and timely assessments, consistent with \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care, and that \nthese assessments drive treatment interventions.  More \nparticularly, as to the following areas, Metropolitan should: \n1.  Psychiatric Assessments and Diagnoses \na.\t Develop diagnostic practices, guided by \ncurrent, generally accepted professional \ncriteria, for reliably reaching the most \naccurate psychiatric diagnoses. Develop a \nclinical formulation of each patient that: \n(1)\t integrates relevant elements of the \npatient’s history, mental status \nexamination, and response to current \nand past medications and other \ninterventions; and \n(2)\t is used to prepare the patient’s \ntreatment plan. \nb.\t Review and revise, as appropriate, \npsychiatric assessments of all patients, \nproviding clinically justifiable current \ndiagnoses for each patient, and removing all \ndiagnoses that cannot be clinically \njustified.  Modify treatment and medication \nregimens, as appropriate, considering \nfactors such as the patient’s response to \ntreatment, significant developments in the \npatient’s condition, and changing patient \n\n- 46  \nneeds.  Ensure that each patient’s \npsychiatric assessments, diagnoses, and \nmedications are collectively justified in a \ngenerally accepted professional manner. \nc.\t Ensure that treating psychiatrists utilize \nbehavioral data in refining their diagnosis \nand enhancing their understanding of the \ntargeted behavior, especially when \npreviously provided treatments have failed \nto achieve desired outcomes. \n2.  Psychological Assessments and Evaluations \nEnsure that: \na.\t psychologists provide appropriate \npsychological assessments, as clinically \nindicated. \nb.\t before the treatment plan is developed, \npsychologists provide a psychological \nassessment of the patient that will: \n(1)\t address the nature of patient \nimpairments to assist the psychiatrist \nin reaching a clear diagnosis; and \n(2) \t provide an accurate evaluation of the \npatient’s psychological functioning to \ninform the treatment planning process. \nc.\t additional psychological assessments are \nperformed to assist with any psychiatric \ndisorders that may need further work up. \nd.\t the purpose of the assessment is clearly \nidentified. \ne.\t psychological assessments are performed by \nprofessionals having a demonstrated \ncompetency in the methodology required to \naddress the purpose of the assessment. \nf.\t psychological assessments include an \naccurate, complete, and up-to-date summary \nof the patient’s clinical history and \nresponse to previous treatment. \n\n- 47  \n\ng.\t where applicable, psychological assessments \nadhere to generally accepted professional \nstandards for behavioral assessments.  If \nbehavioral intervention is indicated, \nfurther assessment must be conducted by a \nprofessional having demonstrated competency \nin applied behavior analysis and must be \nconsistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of applied behavioral \nanalysis. \nh.\t psychological assessments contain \nconclusions which specifically address the \npurpose of the assessment, and a summary of \nthe empirical basis for all conclusions, and \nany remaining unanswered questions. \n3.\t Rehabilitation Assessments \nEnsure that each patient’s rehabilitation assessments: \na.\t are accurate, complete, and coherent as to \nthe patient’s functional abilities; \nb.\t identify the patient’s life skills prior to, \nand over the course of, the mental illness \nor disorder; \nc.\t identify the patient’s observed and, \nseparately, expressed interests, activities, \nand functional strengths and weaknesses; and \nd.\t provide specific strategies to engage the \npatient in appropriate activities that the \npatient views as personally meaningful and \nproductive. \n4.\t Social History Evaluations \nEnsure that each patient’s social history evaluation: \na.\t is, to the extent reasonably possible, \naccurate, current, complete, and coherent; \nb.\t expressly identifies factual inconsistencies \namong sources, resolves or attempts to \nresolve inconsistencies, and explains the \nrationale for the resolution offered; and \n\n- 48  \n\nc.\t reliably informs the patient’s treatment \nteam about the patient’s relevant social \nfactors. \n5.\t Court Assessments \na.\t Develop and implement policies and \nprocedures to ensure an interdisciplinary \napproach to the development of court \nsubmissions for patients adjudicated NGRI \nbased on accurate information, \nindividualized risk assessments, and \nevaluations of readiness for community \noutpatient treatment. \nb.\t As appropriate, review and revise all court \nassessments and reports for NGRI patients so \nthat they are individualized, accurate, and \nconsistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care. \nC.\t Discharge Planning and Placement in the Most \nIntegrated Setting \nWithin the limitations of court-imposed confinement, the \nState should pursue actively the appropriate discharge of \npatients and ensure that they are provided services in the most \nintegrated, appropriate setting that is consistent with \npatients’ needs.  More particularly, Metropolitan should: \n1.\t Identify at admission and address in treatment \nplanning the criteria that likely will foster \nviable discharge for a particular patient, \nincluding but not limited to: \na.\t the individual patient’s symptoms of mental \nillness or psychiatric distress; \nb.\t any other barriers preventing that specific \npatient in transitioning to a more \nintegrated environment, especially \ndifficulties raised in previously \nunsuccessful placements; and \nc.\t the patient’s strengths, preferences, and \npersonal goals. \n\n- 49  \n2.\t Include in treatment interventions the \ndevelopment of skills necessary to live in the \nsetting in which the patient will be placed, and \notherwise prepare the patient for her new living \nenvironment. \n3.\t Ensure that the patient is an active participant \nin the placement process. \n4.\t Provide the patient adequate assistance in \ntransitioning to the new setting. \n5.\t Develop and implement a quality \nassurance/improvement system to oversee the \ndischarge process and aftercare services.  This \nsystem should ensure that professional judgments \nabout the most integrated setting appropriate to \nmeet each patient’s needs are implemented and \nthat appropriate aftercare services are provided \nthat meet the needs of the patient in the \ncommunity. \nD.\t Specific Treatment Services \n1.\t Psychiatry Services \nMetropolitan should provide adequate psychiatric supports \nand services for the treatment of the severely and persistently \nmentally ill population of adults that it serves in accordance \nwith generally accepted professional standards of care.  More \nparticularly, Metropolitan should: \na.\t Develop and implement policies and \nprocedures requiring physicians to document \ntheir analyses of the benefits and risks of \nchosen treatment interventions. \nb.\t Ensure that all physicians and clinicians \ncan demonstrate competence, consistent with \ngenerally accepted professional standards, \nin appropriate psychiatric evaluation and \ndiagnosis, medication management, treatment \nteam functioning, and the integration of \nbehavioral and pharmacological treatments. \nc.\t Ensure that all psychotropic medications \nare: \n\n- 50 -\n\n(1)\t specifically matched to current, \nclinically justified diagnoses; \n(2)\t prescribed in therapeutic amounts; \n(3)\t tailored to each patient’s individual \nsymptoms; \n(4)\t monitored for efficacy against clearly-\nidentified target variables and time \nframes; \n(5)\t modified based on clinical rationales; \nand \n(6)\t properly documented. \nd.\t Review the medication treatment for all \npatients prescribed continuous \nanticholinergic treatment for more than two \nmonths.  Review the medication treatment for \nall elderly patients and patients with \ncognitive impairments who are prescribed \ncontinuous anticholinergic treatment \nregardless of duration of treatment. \ne.\t Review the medication treatment for all \npatients prescribed benzodiazepines as a \nscheduled modality for more than two months. \nReview the medication treatment for all \npatients prescribed benzodiazepines with \ndiagnoses of substance abuse and cognitive \nimpairments regardless of duration of \ntreatment. \nf.\t Develop and implement policies and \nprocedures to monitor, document, report, and \nproperly address potential side effects of \nprescribed medications to reflect generally \naccepted professional standards of care. \nReview treatment of all patients with a \ndiagnosis of tardive dyskinesia in \naccordance with this updated policy. \ng.\t Make appropriate attempts to use those newer \npsychotropic medications having fewer, less \nserious side effects, rather than those \n\n- 51  \nolder psychotropic medications having more \nserious side effects. \nh.\t Develop and implement a comprehensive system \nto report all actual and potential variances \nin medication use to ensure that all \npotential and actual errors are captured. \ni.\t Develop and implement written guidelines and \nprocedures consistent with generally \naccepted professional standards of care \nregarding medication practices, including \nthe use and monitoring of PRN medications. \nj.\t Develop and implement a system for the \ntimely identification, reporting, and \nmonitoring of adverse drug reactions. \n2.\t Psychology Services \nMetropolitan should provide psychological supports and \nservices adequate to treat the functional and behavioral needs \nof its adult patients according to generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care.  More particularly, Metropolitan \nshould: \na.\t Ensure that psychologists provide evidence-\nbased psychological interventions across a \nrange of modalities, as the assessed needs \nof the patient dictate. \nb.\t Provide active psychosocial rehabilitation, \nconsistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care, that: \n(1)\t is derived from the assessed, \nindividualized needs of the patient to \nengage in more independent life \nfunctions; \n(2)\t addresses those needs in a manner \nbuilding on the patient’s strengths, \npreferences, and interests; \n(3) \t includes a focus on the patient’s \nvulnerabilities to mental illness, \nsubstance abuse and readmission due to \nrelapse; \n\n- 52 -\n\n(4)\t takes place regularly and as scheduled; \nand \n(5)\t is documented in the patient’s \ntreatment plan. \nc.\t Develop and implement policies to ensure \nthat patients who require treatment for \nsubstance abuse are appropriately \nidentified, assessed, treated, and monitored \nin accordance with generally accepted \nprofessional standards. \nd.\t Ensure that behavioral interventions are \nbased on appropriate, positive behavioral \nsupports, not the use of aversive \ncontingencies. \ne.\t Ensure that psychologists treating \nMetropolitan’s adult patients have a \ndemonstrated competence, consistent with \ngenerally accepted professional standards, \nin the use of functional assessments and \npositive behavioral supports. \nf.\t Ensure that psychologists integrate their \ntherapies with other treatment modalities, \nincluding drug therapy. \ng.\t Ensure that psychosocial, rehabilitative, \nand behavioral interventions are monitored \nappropriately against rational, \noperationally defined, target variables and \nrevised as appropriate in light of \nsignificant developments and the patient’s \nprogress, or the lack thereof. \n3.\t Nursing and Unit-Based Services \nMetropolitan should provide nursing and unit-based services \nto its patients consistent with generally accepted professional \nstandards of care.  Such services should result in \nMetropolitan’s patients receiving individualized services, \nsupports, and therapeutic interventions, consistent with their \ntreatment plans.  At a minimum, Metropolitan should: \na.\t Ensure that, before they work directly with \npatients, all nursing and unit-based staff \n\n- 53  \n\nhave successfully completed competency-based \ntraining regarding mental health diagnoses, \nrelated symptoms, psychotropic medications, \nidentification of side effects of \npsychotropic medications, monitoring of \nsymptoms and target variables, and \ndocumenting and reporting of the patient’s \nstatus. \nb.\t Ensure that, prior to assuming their duties \nand on a regular basis thereafter, all staff \nresponsible for the administration of \nmedication have successfully completed \ncompetency-based training on the completion \nof the Medication Administration Records and \nthe controlled medication log. \nc.\t Ensure that all failures to properly sign \nthe Medication Administration Record or the \ncontrolled medication log are treated as \nmedication errors, and that appropriate \nfollow-up occurs to prevent recurrence of \nsuch errors. \nd.\t Ensure that staff responsible for medication \nadministration regularly ask patients about \nside effects they may be experiencing. \ne.\t Ensure that each patient’s treatment plan \nidentifies: \n(1)\t the diagnoses, treatments, and \ninterventions that nursing and other \nstaff are to implement; \n(2)\t the related symptoms and target \nvariables to be monitored by nursing \nand other unit staff; and \n(3)\t the frequency by which staff need to \nmonitor such symptoms. \nf.\t Ensure that staff monitor, document, and \nreport the status of symptoms and target \nvariables in a manner enabling treatment \nteams to assess the patient’s status and to \nmodify, as appropriate, the treatment plan. \n\n- 54  \n\ng.\t Ensure that only patients with clinically \njustified reasons remain in a “bed-bound” \nstatus.  For patients who have been \nunjustifiably maintained in this status, \ndevelop and implement methodical plans to \nreduce their time spent in bed, paying \nparticular care to plan for and monitor \nthese patients due to the risks associated \nwith their long-term, bed-bound status. \nh.\t Ensure that nursing and other staff \nproviding direct support to patients are \nknowledgeable about their patients and \nparticipate meaningfully in the treatment \nteam process. \n4.\t Pharmacy \nMetropolitan’s patients should receive pharmacy services \nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare.  More particularly, Metropolitan should: \na.\t Develop and implement policies and \nprocedures that: \n(1)\t require pharmacists to complete \nregular, appropriate reviews of \npatients’ entire medication regimens, \ntrack the use of psychotropic PRN \nmedications, and, as warranted, make \nrecommendations to the treatment team \nabout possible drug-to-drug \ninteractions, side effects, medication \nchanges, and needs for testing; and \n(2)\t require that physicians consider \npharmacists’ recommendations, clearly \ndocument their responses and actions \ntaken, and for any recommendations not \nfollowed, provide an adequate clinical \njustification. \n5.\t General Medical Care \nMetropolitan should provide adequate preventative, routine, \nspecialized, and emergency medical services on a timely basis, \nin accordance with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare.  More particularly, Metropolitan should: \n\n- 55  \na.\t Develop and implement policies and \nprocedures that clearly define \nMetropolitan’s primary care physicians’ \nscope of service and ensure the timely \nprovision of initial assessments, ongoing \ncare and re-assessments, physician-nurse \ncommunication, and the integration of \npatients’ mental health and medical care. \nb.\t Ensure that each patient’s treatment plan \nidentifies general medical diagnoses, the \ntreatments to be employed, the related \nsymptoms to be monitored by nursing and \nother unit staff, and the frequency by which \nstaff need to monitor such symptoms. \nc.\t Revise the system of after-hours coverage by \nprimary care physicians to institute formal \npsychiatric training and provide psychiatric \nbackup support after hours. \n6.\t Infection Control \nMetropolitan should implement adequate infection control \nprocedures to prevent the spread of infections or communicable \ndiseases.  More specifically, Metropolitan should: \na.\t Revise infection control policies and \nprocedures to include analysis of aggregated \ndata and development and implementation of \ncorrective action plans. \nb.\t Establish an effective infection control \nprogram that: \n(1)\t actively collects data with regard to \ninfections and communicable diseases; \n(2)\t assesses these data for trends; \n(3)\t initiates inquiries regarding \nproblematic trends; \n(4)\t identifies necessary corrective action; \n(5)\t monitors to ensure that appropriate \nremedies are achieved; and \n\n- 56 -\n\n(6)\t integrates this information into \nMetropolitan’s quality assurance \nreview. \nc.\t Develop proper procedures to remove dirty \nlinens and clothing from the living units in \na timely and safe manner. \n7.\t Dental Services \nMetropolitan should provide its patients with routine and \nemergency dental care and treatment on a timely basis, \nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare.  More particularly, Metropolitan should: \na.\t Retain an adequate number of qualified \ndentists to provide timely and appropriate \ndental care and treatment to Metropolitan \npatients. \nb.\t Develop protocols and procedures that \nrequire: \n(1)\t the timely provision of documented \ndental services; and \n(2)\t preventative and restorative care be \nused whenever possible and tooth \nextractions be used as a treatment of \nlast resort, which, when used, will be \njustified in a manner subject to \nclinical review. \nc.\t Ensure that dentists demonstrate, in a \ndocumented fashion, an accurate \nunderstanding of their patients’ health \nconditions and medications that bear on \ndental care, as well as an accurate \nunderstanding of their current dental status \nand complaints. \nd.\t Ensure that transportation and staffing \nissues do not preclude residents from \nattending dental appointments. \ne.\t Ensure that treatment teams review, assess, \nand develop strategies to overcome patient \n\n- 57  \nrefusals to participate in dental \nappointments. \nf.\t Ensure that dentists consistently document \ntheir findings, a description of the \ntreatment they have provided, and their plan \nof care. \n8.  Physical and Occupational Therapy Services \nMetropolitan should provide its patients with physical and \noccupational therapy consistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care.  More particularly, Metropolitan \nshould: \na.\t Develop and implement policies related to \nthe provision of physical and occupational \ntherapy that address, at a minimum: \n(1)\t the assessment process; \n(2)\t the development of plans of care; \n(3)\t the provision of direct services by \ntherapists; \n(4)\t the oversight by therapists of \nindividualized programs; \n(5)\t program implementation by nursing and \nunit staff; and \n(6)\t training for staff with related \nresponsibilities. \nb.\t Ensure that patients are provided with \ntimely and adequate PT and OT services and \nthat transportation and staffing issues do \nnot preclude residents from attending PT and \nOT appointments. \nc.\t Ensure that treatment teams review, assess, \nand develop strategies to overcome patient \nrefusals to participate in PT and OT \nsessions. \nd.\t Ensure that each person who requires \nadaptive equipment is provided with \n\n- 58  \nequipment that meets their individualized \nneeds and promotes their independence. \nProvide patients with training and support \nto use such equipment. \ne.\t Provide competency-based training to nursing \nand other unit staff on the use and care of \nadaptive equipment, transferring, and \npositioning, as well as the need to promote \npatients’ independence. \n9.\t Dietary Services \nMetropolitan should ensure that its patients, particularly \nthose experiencing weight-related problems, receive adequate \ndietary services, consistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care.  More particularly, Metropolitan \nshould: \na.\t Modify treatment planning policies and \nprocedures to require that the treatment \nplans of patients who experience weight \nproblems or related health concerns include \nadequate strategies and methodologies to \naddress the identified problems and that \nsuch strategies and methodologies are \nimplemented in a timely manner, monitored \nappropriately, and revised, as warranted. \nb.\t Increase the availability of individualized \nand group exercise and recreational options \nfor its adult patients. \nc.\t Develop and implement policies and \nprocedures to address the needs of patients \nwho are at risk for aspiration, including \nbut not limited to, patient assessments, and \nthe development and implementation of \nprotocols for mealtimes and other activities \ninvolving swallowing.  Ensure that staff \nwith responsibilities for these processes \nhave successfully completed commensurate \ncompetency-based training. \nd.\t Develop and implement policies requiring the \ntreatment of the underlying causes for tube \nfeeding placement, and ongoing assessment of \nthe individuals for whom these treatment \n\n- 59  \noptions are utilized to determine the \nfeasibility of returning them to oral intake \nstatus. \nE.\t Documentation of Patient Progress \nMetropolitan should ensure that patient records accurately \nreflect patient progress, consistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care.  More particularly, Metropolitan \nshould: \n1.\t Develop and implement policies and procedures \nsetting forth clear expectations regarding the \ncontent and timeliness of progress notes, \ntransfer notes, and discharge notes. \n2.\t Ensure that such records include meaningful, \naccurate assessments of a patient’s progress \nrelating to the treatment plan and treatment \ngoals. \nF.\t Restraint, Seclusion, and “As-Needed” Medications \nMetropolitan should ensure that seclusion, restraints and \nPRN psychotropic medications are used in accordance with \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care.  More \nparticularly, Metropolitan should: \n1.  Ensure that restraints and seclusion: \na. \t are used in a reliably documented manner and \nonly when persons pose an immediate safety \nthreat to themselves or others and after a \nhierarchy of less restrictive measures has \nbeen considered and/or exhausted; \nb.\t will not be used in the absence of, or as an \nalternative to, active treatment, as \npunishment, or for the convenience of staff; \nc.\t will not be used as part of a behavioral \nintervention. as indicated in (a), above; \nand \nd.\t will be terminated as soon as the person is \nno longer an imminent danger to himself or \nothers. \n\n- 60  \n2.\t Ensure that PRN psychotropic medications are used \nonly as a short-term measure to relieve a patient \nin acute distress, not as means to escape mild, \npossibly healthy, discomfort or as a repeatedly \ndeployed substitute for treatment. \n3.\t Reduce its use of seclusion, restraints, and \npsychotropic PRN medications. \n4.\t Revise, as appropriate, and implement policies \nand procedures consistent with these generally \naccepted professional standards of care. \n5.\t Ensure that staff successfully complete \ncompetency-based training regarding \nimplementation of such policies and the use of \nless restrictive interventions. \n6.\t Revise, as appropriate, and implement policies \nand procedures to require the review and \nmodification, if appropriate, of patients’ \ntreatment plans after use of seclusion or \nrestraints. \n7.\t Comply with 42 C.F.R. § 483.360(f) as to \nassessments by a physician or licensed medical \nprofessional of any resident placed in seclusion \nor restraints. \n8.\t Develop and implement a systemic plan to reduce \nthe use of side rails as restraints in a \nsystematic and gradual way to ensure the \nresidents’ safety.  Ensure that residents’ \nindividualized treatment plans address the use of \nside rails for those who need them, including \nidentification of the medical symptoms that \nwarrant the use of side rails, plans to address \nthe underlying causes of the medical symptoms, \nand strategies to reduce the use of side rails. \n9.\t Develop and implement a policy consistent with \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care \ngoverning the use of psychotropic PRN medication \nfor psychiatric purposes and requiring that: \na.\t such medications are used on a limited basis \nand not as a substitute for adequate \n\n- 61  \ntreatment of the underlying cause of the \npatient’s distress; \nb.\t the patient’s physician assess the patient \nwithin 24 hours of the administration of PRN \nmedication; and \nc.\t in a clinically justifiable manner, the \npatient’s treatment team, including the \npsychiatrist, timely review the use of such \nmedications, determine whether to modify the \npatient’s treatment plan, and implement the \nrevised plan, as appropriate. \nG.\t Protection from Harm \nMetropolitan should provide its patients with a safe and \nhumane environment and protect them from harm.  At a minimum, \nMetropolitan should: \n1.\t Review, revise, as appropriate, and implement an \nincident management system that comports with \ngenerally accepted professional standards of \ncare.  At a minimum, Metropolitan should: \na.\t review, revise, as appropriate, and \nimplement comprehensive, consistent incident \nmanagement policies and procedures that \nprovide clear guidance regarding reporting \nrequirements and the categorization of \nincidents; \nb.\t require all staff to complete successfully \ncompetency-based training in the revised \nreporting requirements; \nc.\t review, revise, as appropriate, and \nimplement unified policies and procedures \naddressing the investigation of serious \nincidents, including requirements that such \ninvestigations be comprehensive, include \nconsideration of staff’s adherence to \nprogrammatic requirements, and be performed \nby independent investigators; \nd.\t require all staff involved in conducting \ninvestigations to complete successfully \ncompetency-based training on technical and \n\n- 62  \nprogrammatic investigation methodologies and \ndocumentation requirements necessary in \nmental health service settings; \ne.\t monitor the performance of staff charged \nwith investigative responsibilities and \nprovide technical assistance and training \nwhenever necessary to ensure the thorough, \ncompetent, and timely completion of \ninvestigations of serious incidents; \nf.\t develop and implement a reliable system to \nidentify the need for, and monitor the \nimplementation of, appropriate corrective \nand preventative actions addressing problems \nidentified as a result of investigations; \nand \ng.\t review, revise, as appropriate, and \nimplement policies and procedures related to \nthe tracking and trending of incident data, \nto ensure that appropriate corrective \nactions are identified and implemented in \nresponse to problematic trends. \n2.\t Develop and implement a comprehensive quality \nimprovement system consistent with generally \naccepted professional standards of care.  At a \nminimum, such a system should: \na.\t collect information related to the adequacy \nof the provision of the protections, \ntreatments, services, and supports provided \nby Metropolitan, as well as the outcomes \nbeing achieved by patients; \nb.\t analyze the information collected in order \nto identify strengths and weaknesses within \nthe current system; and \nc.\t identify and monitor implementation of \ncorrective and preventative actions to \naddress identified issues and ensure \nresolution of underlying problems. \n3.\t Conduct a thorough review of all units to \nidentify any potential environmental safety \n\n- 63  \nhazards, and develop and implement a plan to \nremedy any identified issues. \na.\t Ensure that all areas of the hospital that \nare occupied or utilized by patients have \nadequate temperature control at all times. \nb.\t Review, revise as appropriate, and implement \nprocedures and practices so that incontinent \npatients are assisted to change in a timely \nmanner. \nc.\t Develop clear guidelines stating the \ncircumstances under which it is appropriate \nto utilize staff who are not trained to \nprovide mental health services in addressing \nincidents involving patients.  Ensure that \npersons who are likely to intervene in \npatient incidents are properly trained to \nwork with patients with mental health \nconcerns. \nH.\t First Amendment and Due Process \nThe State should permit Metropolitan patients to exercise \ntheir constitutional rights of:  (a) free speech, and, in \nparticular, the right to petition the government for redress of \ngrievances without State monitoring; and (b) due process.  More \nparticularly, the State should: \n1.\t Permit patients to speak with representatives of \nthe federal government outside the presence of \npersons acting for the State. \n2.\t Permit patients to engage in confidential \ncommunications. \n***** \n\n- 64  \n\nThe collaborative approach that the parties have taken thus \nfar has been productive.  We hope to continue working with the \nState in this fashion to resolve our significant concerns \nregarding the care and services provided at this facility. \nWe will forward our expert consultants’ reports under \nseparate cover.  Although their reports are their work – and do \nnot necessarily represent the official conclusions of the \nDepartment of Justice - their observations, analyses, and \nrecommendations provide further elaboration of the relevant \nconcerns, and offer practical technical assistance in addressing \nthem.  We hope that you will give this information careful \nconsideration and that it will assist in facilitating a dialogue \nswiftly addressing areas requiring attention. \nIn the unexpected event that the parties are unable to \nreach a resolution regarding our concerns, we are obligated to \nadvise you that the Attorney General may initiate a lawsuit \npursuant to CRIPA, to correct deficiencies or to otherwise \nprotect the rights of Metropolitan’s patients, 49 days after the \nreceipt of this letter.  42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(1).  Accordingly, \nwe will soon contact State officials to discuss in more detail \nthe measures that the State must take to address the \ndeficiencies identified herein. \nSincerely, \nR.

Therapeutic  and  rehabilitation  service  planning \n10  provides  timely  attention  to  the  needs  of  each \n11  individual,  in particular: \n12  i.  initial therapeutic  and  rehabilitation \n13  service  plans  (Admission  Wel1ness  and \n14  Recovery  Plan  (\"A-WRP\"))  are  completed  within \n15  24  hours  of  admission; \n16  ii.  master  therapeutic  and  rehabilitation  service \n17  plans  (WRP)  are  completed  within  7  days  of \n18  admission;  and \n19  iii.  therapeutic  and  rehabilitation  service  plan \n20  reviews  are  performed  every  14  days  during \n21  the  first  60  days  of  hospitalization and \n22  every  30  days  thereafter.  The  third monthly \n23  review  is a  quarterly  review  and  the  12th \n24  monthly  review  is  the  annual  review. \n25  c.  Treatment,  rehabilitation,  and  enrichment  services \n26  are  goal-directed,  individualized,  and  informed  by \n27  a  thorough  knowledge  of  the  individual's \n28 \n10 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 11 of 94\n1  psychiatric,  medical,  and  psychosocial  history and \n2  previous  response  to  such  services. \n3  d.  Therapeutic  and  rehabilitation  service  planning  is \n4  based  on  a  comprehensive  case  formulation  for  each \n5  individual  that  emanates  from  interdisciplinary \n6  assessments  of  the  individual  consistent  with \n7  generally  accepted  professional  standards  of  care. \n8  Specifically,  the  case  formulation  shall: \n9  i.  be  derived  from  analyses  of  the  information \n10  gathered  from  interdisciplinary  assessments, \n11  including  diagnosis  and  differential \n12  diagnosis; \n13  ii.  include  a  review  of:  pertinent  history; \n14  predisposing,  precipitating  and  perpetuating \n15  factors;  previous  treatment  history;  and \n16  present  status; \n17  iii.  consider  biomedical,  psychosocial,  and \n18  psychoeducational  factors,  as  clinically \n19  appropriate,  for  each  category  in  §  C.2.d.ii \n20  above; \n21  iv.  consider  such  factors  as  age,  gender, \n22  culture,  treatment  adherence,  and  medication \n23  issues  that  may  affect  the  outcomes  of \n24  treatment  and  rehabilitation  interventions; \n25  v.  support  the' diagnosis  by  diagnostic \n26  formulation,  differential  diagnosis,  and \n27  Diagnostic  and  Statistical Manual-IV-TR  (or \n28  the  most  current  edition)  checklists;  and \n11 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 12 of 94\n1  vi.  enable  the  interdisciplinary  team  to  reach \n2  sound  determinations  about  each  individual's \n3  treatment,  rehabilitation,  enrichment  and \n4  wellness  needs,  the  type  of  setting  to  which \n5  the  individual  should  be  discharged,  and  the \n6  changes  that  will  be  necessary  to  achieve \n7  discharge. \n8  e.  The  therapeutic  and  rehabilitation  service  plan \n9  specifies  the  individual's  focus  of \n10  hospitalization  (goals),  assessed  needs \n11  (objectives),  and  how  the  staff will  assist  the \n12  individual  to  achieve  his  or  her  goals/objectives \n13  (interventions) . \n14  f.  Therapeutic  and  rehabilitation  service  planning  is \n15  driven  by  individualized  needs,  is  strengths-based \n16  (i.e.,  builds  on  an  individual's  current \n17  strengths),  addresses  the  individual's motivation \n18  for  engaging  in wellness  activities,  and  leads  to \n19  improvement  in  the  individual's mental  health, \n20  physical  health,  and  well  being,  consistent  with \n21  generally  accepted  professional  standards  of  care. \n22  Specifically,  the  interdisciplinary team  shall: \n23  i.  develop  and  prioritize  reasonable  and \n24  attainable  goals/objectives  (e.g.,  at  the \n25  level  of  each  individual's  functioning)  that \n26  build  on  the  individual's  strengths  and \n27  address  the  individual's  identified needs \n28 \n12 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 13 of 94\n1  and,  if any  identified need  is  not  addressed, \n2  provide  a  rationale  for  not  addressing  the \n3  need; \n4  ii.  ensure  that  the  objectives/interventions \n5  address  treatment  (e.g.,  for  a  disease  or \n6  disorder),  rehabilitation  (e.g., \n7  skills/supports,  motivation  and  readiness), \n8  and  enrichment  (e.g.,  quality of  life \n9  activities); \n10  iii.  write  the  objectives  in behavioral, \n11  observable,  and/or  measurable  terms; \n12  iv.  include  all  objectives  from  the  individual's \n13  current  stage  of  change,  or  readiness  for \n14  rehabilitation,  to  the  maintenance  stage  for \n15  each  focus  of  hospitalization,  as  clinically \n16  appropriate; \n17  v.  ensure  that  there  are  interventions  that \n18  relate  to  each  objective,  specifying  who  will \n19  do  what,  within  what  time  frame,  to  assist \n20  the  individual  to  meet  his/her  needs  as \n21  specified  in  the  objective; \n22  vi.  implement  interventions  appropriately \n23  throughout  the  individual's  day,  with  a \n24  minimum  of  20  hours  of  active  treatment  per \n25  week.

This \n14  requirement  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to, \n15  ensuring  that  individuals  are  assigned  to \n16  mall  groups  that  link directly to  the \n17  objectives  of  the  individual's  treatment  plan \n18  and  needs; \n19  g.  Therapeutic  and  rehabilitation  service  plans  are \n20  revised  as  appropriate  to  ensure  that  planning  is \n21  based  on  the  individual's  progress,  or  lack \n22  thereof,  ~s determined  by  the  scheduled  monitoring \n23  of  identified  criteria  or  target  variables, \n24  consistent  with  generally  accepted  professional \n25  standards  of  care.  Specifically,  the \n26  interdisciplinary  team  shall: \n27  1.  revise  the  focus  of  hospitalization \n28  objectives,  as  needed,  to  reflect  the \n14 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 15 of 94\n1  individual's  changing  needs  and  develop  new \n2  interventions  to  facilitate  attainment  of  new \n3  objectives  when  old  objectives  are  achieved \n4  or  when  the  individual  fails  to  make  progress \n5  toward  achieving  these  objectives; \n6  ii.  review  the  focus  of  hospitalization,  needs, \n7  objectives,  and  interventions  more  frequently \n8  if there  are  changes  in  the  individual's \n9  functional  status  or  risk  factors  (i.e., \n10  behavioral,  medical,  and/or  psychiatric  risk \n11  factors) ; \n12  iii.  ensure  that  the  review  process  includes  an \n13  assessment  of progress  related  to  discharge \n14  to  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to \n15  meet  the  individual's  assessed  needs, \n16  consistent  with  his/her  legal  status;  and \n17  iv.  base  progress  reviews  and  revision \n18  recommendations  on  data  collected as \n19  specified in  the  therapeutic  and \n20  rehabilitation  service  plan. \n21  h.

In  the  event \n12  that  Dr.  El-Sabaawi  is  unable  to  serve  or  continue  serving  as  the \n13  Monitor,  or  in  the  event  that  the  Parties  for  any  reason  agree  to \n14  discontinue  the  use  of  Dr.  EI-Sabaawi,  the  Parties  shall  meet  or \n15  otherwise  confer  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  being  notified of  the \n16  incapacity  or  the  decision  to  discontinue  use  of  Dr.  El-Sabaawi \n17  to  select  a  new  Monitor.  If the  Parties  are  unable  to  agree  upon \n18  a  selection,  each  Party  shall  submit  two  names,  along  with \n19  resumes  or  curricula  vitae  and  cost  proposals,  to  the  Court  and \n20  the  Court  shall  appoint  the  Monitor  from  among  the  names \n21  submitted.  The  procedure  described  in  this  paragraph  shall  apply \n22  to  all  successor Monitors.  The  Parties  agree  that  the  Monitor \n23  may  use  consultants  to  assist  the  Monitor.  Any  such  consultants \n24  shall  be  time,  services,  and  expenses  pursuant  to  the \npaid~for \n25  Monitor's  existing budget.  In  collaboration with  the  Monitor, \n26  the  Parties  shall meet  or  otherwise  confer  whenever  necessary  to \n27  agree  upon  which  particular  consultant(s)  the  Monitor  shall  use \n28  to  assist  the  Monitor  in  his  duties  as  Monitor ..  Neither  the \n83 \n\n• \nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 84 of 94\n1  Monitor,  nor  any  person  or  entity hired  or  retained  by  the \n2  Monitor  to  assist  in  furthering  any  provision  of  this  Consent \n3  Judgment,  shall be  liable  for  any  claim,  lawsuit,  or  demand \n4  arising  out  of  the  Monitoring  of  this  Consent  Judgment.  This \n5  paragraph  does  not  apply  to  any  proceeding  before  this  Court  for \n6  enforcement  or  payment  of  contracts  or  subcontracts  for \n7  monitoring  this  Consent  Judgment. \n8  B.  Budget  of  the  Monitor \n9  The  Parties  and  the  Monitor  have  agreed  upon  the  annual \n10  budget  for  the  Monitor's  work. \n11  c.  Reimbursement  and  Payment  Provisions \n12  1.  The  cost  of  the  Monitor,  including  the  cost  of  any \n13  consultant  to  assist  the  Monitor,  shall be  borne  by  the \n14  State  in  this  action.  All  reasonable  expenses  incurred \n15  by  the  Monitor  or  any  consultant,  in  the  course  of  the \n16  performance  of  the  duties  of  the  Monitor,  pursuant  to \n17  the  budget  of  the  Monitor,  shall  be  reimbursed  by  the \n18  State.  The  United  States  will  bear  its own  expenses  in \n19  this matter. \n20  2.  The  Monitor  shall  submit  monthly  invoices  to  the \n21  Defendants,  with  a  copy  to  the  United  States,  detailing \n22  all  expenses  the  Monitor  incurred  during  the  prior \n23  month.  These  invoices  shall  include  daily  records  of \n24  time  spent  and  expenses  incurred,  and  shall  include \n25  copies  of  any  supporting  documentation,  including \n26  receipts.  The  Defendants  agrees  to pay  each month's \n27  invoice  in  full  from  the  Monitor  within  thirty  (30) \n28  days  of  receipt  of  the  monthly  invoice  from  the \n84 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 85 of 94\n1  Monitor.  If  the  Defendants  dispute  all  or part  of  the \n2  invoice,  the  Defendants  shall  notify  in  writing  the \n3  Monitor  and  the  United  States  within  ten  days  of \n4  receipt  of  the  Monitor's  monthly  invoice.  The  Monitor, \n5  the  Defendants  and  the  United  States  will  endeavor  to \n6  resolve  any  invoice  disputes  promptly  and  in  good \n. \n7  faith.  Where  the  Monitor  and  the  Parties  are  unable  to \n8  resolve  any  invoice  dispute,  the  Monitor  and/or  the \n9  Parties may  petition  the  Court  to  resolve  the  dispute. \n10  D.  Responsibilities  and  Powers  of  the  Monitor \n11  1.  The  overall  duties  of  the  Monitor  shall  be  to  observe, \n12  review,  report  findings,  and make  recommendations, \n13  where  appropriate,  with  regard  to  the  implementation  of \n14  the  foregoing  Enhancement  Plan  at  the  State  Hospitals. \n15  The  Monitor  shall  regularly  review  the  therapeutic  and \n16  rehabilitation  services  provided  to  individuals  to \n17  determine  the  Defendants'  implementation  of  and \n18  compliance  with  this  Consent  Judgment.  During  the \n19  Monitor's  review,  the  Monitor  shall have  full  and \n20  complete  access  to  all  of  the  State  Hospitals' \n21  buildings  and  facilities,  staff,  patients,  patient \n22  records,  documentation,  and  information  relating  to  the \n23  issues  addressed  in  this  Consent  Judgment.  The  State \n24  Hospitals'  Executive  Directors  shall  direct  all \n25  employees  to  cooperate  fully  with  the  Monitor.  The \n26  Monitor  shall  be  permitted  to  initiate and  receive  ex \n27  parte  communications  with  the  Parties.  The  Monitor \n28  shall  devote  such  time  as  is  necessary  to  fulfill  the \n85 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 86 of 94\n1  purposes  of  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of  the \n2  Monitor  pursuant  to  this  Consent  Judgment. \n3  2.  The  Monitor  shall  consult  with  the  Parties  and  shall \n4  submit  a  written plan  with  regard  to  the  methodologies \n5  to  be  used  by  the  Monitor  to  assess  the  Defendants' \n6  compliance  with  and  implementation  of  the  Consent \n7  Judgment.  The  Monitor's  evaluation  shall  include: \n8  regular  on-site  inspection  of  the  State  Hospitals' \n9  facilities  and  programs  for  patients,  interviews  with \n10  administrators,  professional  and  other  staff, \n11  contractors,  and  patients,  and  detailed  review  of \n12  pertinent documents  and  patient  records.  The  Parties \n13  envision  that  the  Monitor  may  provide  specific \n14  recommendations  to  the  Defendants  with  regard  to  steps \n15  to  be  taken  to  come  into  compliance  with  the  Consent \n16  Judgment.  However,  the  Defendants  retain  the \n17  discretion  to  achieve  compliance  by  any  legal  means \n18  available  to  them,  and  may  choose  to  utilize methods \n19  other  than  those  that may  be  proposed by  the  Monitor  or \n20  the  United  States.  The  Monitor  shall  not  be  empowered \n21  to  direct  the  Defendants  to  take,  or  to  refrain  from \n22  taking,  any  specific  action  to  achieve  compliance  with \n23  the  Consent  Judgment.  The  Parties  do  not  intend  for \n24  the  Monitor  to  have  the  role  of  a  \"Special  Master.\" \n25  The  Agreement  is  the  product  of  two  governmental \n26  agencies  exercising  their  expertise. \n27  3.  In  any  instance  in  which  either party  disagrees  as  to \n28  compliance,  the  Court  shall  give  appropriate  deference \n86 \n\n• \nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 87 of 94\n1  to  the  Monitor's  assessment  of  compliance. \n2  4.  The  Parties  envision  that  the  United  States  and  the \n3  Monitor  shall  conduct  a  \"baseline\"  evaluation  of  the \nl, .. ..1 \n4  Defendants'  compliance  with  the  terms  of  this  Consent \n5  Judgment  at  the  State  Hospitals  within  the  first  180 \n6  days  after  the  filing  of  this  Consent  Judgment.  This \n7  initial baseline  evaluation  is  intended  to  inform  the \n8  Parties  and  the  Monitor  of  the  status  of  compliance \n9  with  this  Enhancement  Plan.  The  Monitor  shall  produce \n10  a  written  report  to  the  Parties  with  regard  to  the \n11  State's  compliance  with  particular provisions  of  the \n12  Consent  Judgment  as  soon  as  possible,  but  at  least \n13  within  60  days  of  each  visit. \n14  5.  Following  the  baseline  tour,  the  Monitor  shall  conduct \n15  subsequent  tours  of  each  State  Hospital  at  least \n16  semi-annually,  upon  reasonable  notice  to  the  State \n17  Hospital,  in  order  to  fulfill  his  or  her  obligations \n18  pursuant  to  this  Consent  Judgment.  In  connection  with \n19  the  baseline  tours,  the  Parties  and  the  Monitor  shall \n20  attempt  to  agree  upon  a  schedule  of  subsequent  tours \n21  and  reports  for  the  upcoming  year,  to  be  repeated \n22  annually  thereafter. \n23  6.  The  Monitor  shall  provide  the  Parties  with  a  written \n24  report  as  soon  as  possible,  but  at  least  within  60  days \n25  of  each  tour  and  shall  detail  with  as  much  specificity \n26  as  possible  how  the  State  is  or  is  not  in  compliance \n27  with  particular provisions  of  the  Consent  Judgment. \n28  Drafts  of  the  Monitor's  reports  shall  be  provided  to \n87 \n\n•  • \nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 88 of 94\n1  the  Parties  for  comment  at  least  ten  (10)  business  days \n2  prior  to  issuance  of  the  reports.  Upon  the  achievement \n3  of  eighteen  (18)  months  of  substantial  compliance  with \n4  any  substantive  paragraph(s)  of  this  Agreement,  no \n5  further  reporting  shall  be  required  on  that  paragraph. \n6  7.  The  Defendants  shall  notify  the  Monitor  immediately \n7  upon  the  death  of  any  current  State  Hospital  patient, \n8  including  any  person  who  died  following  transfer  due  to \n9  medical  condition  from  a  State  Hospital  to  another \n10  medical  facility.  The  Defendants  shall  forward  to  the \n11  Monitor  copies  of  any  completed  incident  reports \n12  related  to  deaths,  autopsies  and/or  death  summaries  of \n13  residents,  as  well  as  all  final  reports  of \n14  investigations  that  involve  State Hospital  patients. \n15  The  Defendants  shall  also  notify  the  Monitor \n16  immediately  if they  receive  a  citation or  threat  to \n17  de-certify a  State  Hospital  from  the  Centers  for \n18  Medicaid  and  Medicare  Services. \n19  E.  The  United  States'  Access  to  Information  and  the  State \n20  Hospitals \n21  1.  The  United  States  shall  have  full  access  to,  and  shall, \n22  upon  request,  receive  copies  of  any  documents,  records, \n23  databases,  and  information  relating  to  the \n24  implementation  of  this  Consent  Judgment.  The \n25  Defendants  shall  provide  any  requested documents, \n26  records,  databases,  and  information  to  the \n27  United  States  as  soon  as  possible,  but  no  later than \n28  within  thirty  (30)  business  days  of  the  request,  or \n88 \n\n• \nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 89 of 94\n1  within  a  time  frame  negotiated by  the  parties  if the \n2  volume  of  requested material  is  too  great  to  reasonably \n3  produce  within  thirty days.  The  United  States,  upon \n4  reasonable  notice,  shall  ha've  full  access  to  all  of  the \n5  State  Hospitals'  buildings  and  facilities,  staff, \n6  patients,  patients'  records,  documentation,  and \n7  information  relating  to  the  issues  addressed  in  this \n8  Consent  Judgment.  The  State  Hospitals'  Executive \n9  Directors, shall  direct  all  employees  to  cooperate  fully \n10  with  the  United  States.  The  United  States may  receive \n11  and  respond  to  unsolicited calls  or  contacts  from  State \n12  personnel  outside  the  presence  of  State \n13  representatives. \n14  PART  III \n15  MODIFICATION  OF  TERMS \n16  A.  If  the  Parties  reach  a  subsequent  agreement  that  varies  from \n17  the  Plan,  the  new  agreement  shall be  reduced  to writing,  signed, \n18  and  filed  with  the  Court  for  approval. \n19  PART  IV \n20  COMPLIANCE  AND  TERMINATION \n21  A.  The  purpose  of  this  Consent  Judgment  is  that  the  Defendants \n22  will  be  able  to  achieve  desired  outcomes  for  and  provide  the \n23  necessary protections,  supports,  and  services  to  the \n24  individuals  served by  the  State  Hospitals.  All  of  the  terms  of \n25  the  Plan  set  forth  in  Part  I  hereof  shall  be  implemented  at  the \n26  State  Hospitals  within  36  months  of  the  Enhancement  Plan's \n27  effective  date,  except  that  §  I.3  of  the  Plan  and  all provisions \n28  of  the  Plan  having  to  do  with  suicide  prevention measures  shall \n89 \n\n• \nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 90 of 94\n1  be  implemented  at  the  State  Hospitals  upon  the  effective  date  of \n2  this  Consent  Judgment.  This  Consent  Judgment  will  be  terminated \n3  and  the  case  dismissed  five  (5)  years  after  the  effective  date  of \n4  the  Consent  Judgment.  This  Consent  Judgment  may  terminate  at  an \n5  earlier date  if the  Parties  agree  that  the  Defendants  are  in \n6  substantial  compliance  with  each  provision  of  the  Consent \n7  Judgment,  and  the  State  has  maintained  compliance  for  at  least \n8  eighteen  (18)  months  (\"maintained  sustained  compliance\") .If \n9  Defendants  and  the  Monitor  contend  that  the  Defendants  have \n10  maintained  sustained  compliance  and  the  United  States  disagrees, \n11  Defendants  may  move  this  Court  for  an  order  terminating  this \n12  Consent  Judgment.  In  any  instance  in which  the  parties  disagree \n13  as  to  compliance,  the  Court  shall  give  appropriate  deference  to \n14  the  Monitor's  assessment  of  compliance.  Noncompliance  with mere \n15  technicalities,  or  temporary  failure  to  comply  during  a  period  of \n16  otherwise  sustained  compliance  shall  not  constitute  failure  to \n17  maintain  substantial  compliance.  At  the  same  time,  temporary \n18  compliance  during  a  period  of  sustained  noncompliance  shall  not \n19  constitute  substantial  compliance. \n20  B.  At  all  times,  the  State  shall  comply  with  applicable  federal \n21  and  state  licensing  requirements. \n22  C.  If the  United  States  maintains  that  the  Defendants  have \n23  failed  to  carry  out  any  requirement  of  this  Consent  Judgment,  the \n24  United  Sta~es shall  notify  the  Defendants  with  specificity of  any \n25  instance(s)  in which  it maintains  that  the  Defendants  have  failed \n26  to  carry  out  the  requirements  of  this  Consent  Judgment. \n27  D.  With  the  exception  of  conditions  or practices  that  pose  an \n28  immediate  and  serious  threat  to  the  life,  health,  or  safety of \n90 \n\n, \nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 91 of 94\n1  individuals  served  by  the  State  Hospitals,  the  Defendants  shall \n2  have  thirty  (30)  days  from  the  date  of  a  deficiency  notice  from \n3  the  United  States  to  cure  the  claim of  noncompliance.  During \n4  this  period,  the  Parties  shall  coordinate  and  shall  discuss  areas \n5  of  disagreement  and  attempt  to  resolve  outstanding  differences. \n6  E.  Unless  specified  to  the  contrary  elsewhere  herein,  in any \n7  compliance  or  other  adversarial  hearing  prior  to  final  dismissal \n8  of  this  action,  the  burden  of  proof  will  be  on  the  Party moving \n9  the  Court. \n10  F.  All  provisions  of  this  Consent  Judgment  shall  have  ongoing \n11  effect  until  the  final  dismissal  of  this  action.  The  Court  shall \n12  retain  jurisdiction  for  all purposes  until  such  time  as  this \n13  action dismissed.  Independent  of  the  foregoing,  if the  United \n14  States  and  the  Defendants  agree  that  the  State  Hospitals  have \n15  achieved  substantial  compliance  with  each  section of  this  Consent \n16  Judgment,  the  Parties  shall  file  a  joint motion  to  dismiss  this \n17  action. \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21  DATED:  This  2 'I  dayof  ~ ,  2006. \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n91 \n\nCase 2:06-cv-02667-GPS-E     Document 9      Filed 02/27/2007     Page 92 of 94\n1  APPROVED  AS  TO  FORM  AND  CONTENT: \n2 \n3 \n5  rney  General \n6 \n7 \n8  ETTA  Y.

      "text": "May 13, 2003 \nThe Honorable Gray Davis \nGovernor of California \nState Capitol Building \nSacramento, CA  95814 \nRe: Metropolitan State Hospital, Norwalk, California \nDear Governor Davis: \nOn March 21, 2002, we notified you that we were \ninvestigating conditions at Metropolitan State Hospital \n(“Metropolitan”), in Norwalk, California, pursuant to the Civil \nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1997.  During the weeks of June 24 and July 8, 2002, we visited \nthe facility.  Our first tour, “Metropolitan I,” focused on the \ncare and treatment provided to the facility’s child and \nadolescent patients, all of whom are in Metropolitan’s Program 1. \nOur second tour, “Metropolitan II,” addressed the care and \ntreatment provided to the facility’s adult patients.  At exit \ninterviews conducted at the end of each facility visit, we \nverbally conveyed our preliminary findings to counsel and \nfacility officials.  Consistent with the requirements of CRIPA, \nwe are now writing to apprise you of our findings regarding the \nchild and adolescent patients.  We will transmit our findings \nregarding the facility’s adult patients when our Metropolitan II \ninvestigation is complete. \nAs a threshold matter, we wish to express our appreciation \nfor the cooperation and assistance provided to us by the \nadministrators and staff of Metropolitan.  In particular, \nfacility personnel cooperated fully with our document requests. \nWe hope to continue to work with the State of California and \nofficials at Metropolitan in a cooperative manner. \nWe conducted our investigation by reviewing medical and \nother records relating to the care and treatment of approximately \n70 patients; interviewing administrators and staff; speaking with \npatients; and conducting on-site surveys of the facility.  We \n\n-2­\n\nwere assisted in this exercise by expert consultants in the \nfields of child psychiatry, child psychology, psychiatric \nnursing, and special education. \nAt the time of our June 2002 visit, Metropolitan had a \ncensus of approximately 825 patients.  Program 1, the hospital’s \nChild and Adolescent Program, had a census of approximately 100 \npatients.  These patients, who range in ages from 11 to 17, \nsuffer from serious mental health disorders and histories of \nsevere traumatization.  Many also have significant cognitive or \nacademic impairments and/or health-related concerns.  The \nmajority also had an average of 10 to 12 failed out-of-home \nplacements prior to their placement at Metropolitan.  In many \nrespects, these children and adolescents are the most \npsychiatrically and emotionally disturbed in the State’s system \nof care.  Because Metropolitan is the only public mental health \ninstitution for this population in the State, these children and \nadolescents are referred to Metropolitan by counties throughout \nthe State of California. \nResidents of state-operated facilities have a right to live \nin reasonable safety and to receive adequate health care, along \nwith habilitation to ensure their safety and freedom from \nunreasonable restraint, prevent regression and facilitate their \nability to exercise their liberty interests.  See Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  Similar protections are accorded by \nfederal statute.  See, e.g., Title XIX of the Social Security \nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 1396; 42 C.F.R. Part 483 (Medicaid Program \nProvisions).  The State also is obliged to provide services in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to individual residents’ \nneeds.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), \n42 U.S.C. § 12132 et seq.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130 (d); see Olmstead \nv. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). \nIt was apparent that many Metropolitan staff are highly \ndedicated individuals who are genuinely concerned for the well­\nbeing of the persons in their care.  Generally speaking, it \nappeared that staff promptly intervened to prevent or minimize \ninjury after patients became physically aggressive.  Further, \nMetropolitan repeatedly has demonstrated its proficiency in \ncomplying with many procedural aspects of care.  Also, the \nfacility commendably has initiated mechanisms to address some \nproblematic aspects of its care, such as the use of restraints \nand seclusion.  Nevertheless, there are significant and wide-\nranging deficiencies in patient care provided at Metropolitan. \n\n-3­\n\nOur Child and Adolescent Program findings, the facts supporting \nthem, and the minimum remedial steps that we believe are \nnecessary are set forth below. \nI.  PSYCHIATRY \nProgram 1's psychiatric supports and services substantially \ndepart from generally accepted professional standards of care and \nexpose the children and adolescents there to a significant risk \nof harm and to actual harm.  Specifically, Metropolitan fails to \nprovide clinically justified evaluations and diagnoses of \npsychiatric disorders; fails to provide adequate and appropriate \ntreatment planning; fails to identify and address cognitive and \nacademic deficits; fails to prescribe clinically justified \npsychotropic medications; fails to assess appropriately the side \neffects of medications; and fails to provide an appropriate \ntherapeutic environment.  The harm to these children and \nadolescents takes many forms, among them, inadequate, ineffective \nand counterproductive treatment, exposure to inappropriate and \nunnecessary medications posing serious physiological and other \nside effects, and excessively long hospitalizations, which \ncompound psychiatric distress. \nA.  Psychiatric Evaluation and Diagnosis \nEach individual’s psychiatric evaluation and diagnoses \nshould be justified in a generally accepted professional manner. \nSpecifically, there should be a close relationship amongst a \npatient’s diagnoses, identified problems in the treatment plan, \ndaily clinical descriptions by staff, and the medications \nadministered.  Program 1 does not meet these minimum standards of \ncare.  Psychiatric evaluations and diagnoses are woefully \ninadequate.  Psychiatrists chronically diagnose patients with \npsychiatric disorders without any clinical justification or any \ndocumentation of signs or symptoms required for such diagnoses. \nThe number of clinically unjustified diagnoses strongly indicates \nthat psychiatrists deliberately make psychiatric diagnoses to \njustify the use of psychotropic medication.  Indeed, multiple \npsychiatrists indicated to us that they have assigned psychiatric \ndiagnoses for this reason. \nNot only do psychiatrists diagnose patients with disorders \nfor which there is little or no clinical justification, they also \nroutinely fail to diagnose patients with disorders for which \npatients do exhibit signs or symptoms.  For example, abandonment \n\n-4­\n\nissues and past trauma are nearly universal problems for the \npatients in Program 1.  However, psychiatrists frequently ignore \nthese disorders in diagnosing patients.  Consequently, these \ndisorders often are not identified as a focus of treatment.  Such \nmissed diagnoses are a grave deficiency, because without proper \nevaluation and diagnosis, it is virtually impossible for patients \nto receive adequate treatment.  Moreover, improper diagnosis and \ntreatment affect opportunities for patients to be placed in the \nmost integrated setting appropriate to meet their needs. \nThe evaluations are also incomplete in that they routinely \nfail to include information about the patients’ medication \nhistories, medications at time of admission, recommended \nmedication regimens to be utilized for treatment, or general \nmedical diagnoses.  This information is crucial in guiding \ntreatment.  In particular, existing medical problems should be a \nsignificant determinant when choosing a psychotropic medication \nregimen so as to avoid interactions and exacerbations of \nindividuals’ mental health or medical disorders. \nThere were many examples of these diagnostic problems.  For \ninstance, one patient, D.S.,1 was placed upon admission on \nnumerous medications, none of which corresponded with his \ndiagnoses.  Two other patients, B.S. and N.C., were diagnosed \nwith Bipolar Disorder and Bipolar Disorder II Depressed with \nPsychotic Features, respectively.  Both were prescribed \nmedications appropriate to treat acute mania.  Neither patient, \nhowever, had any documentation in their evaluation to support \nthese diagnoses, nor did they have identified problems in their \ntreatment plans consistent with these diagnoses.  Moreover, \nN.C.’s symptoms were more consistent with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder than the Bipolar diagnosis.  E.Z.’s evaluation \ncontained no information about the dosages of previously \nprescribed medications, how those medications affected his \nsymptoms, or his current medication regimen.  Further, Attention \nDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was not listed as an Axis I \ndiagnosis to be ruled out despite the fact that E.Z. had a past \ndiagnosis of ADHD and the evaluation stated that more information \nwas required to confirm this diagnosis.  The medical diagnosis of \n1In this letter, to protect patients’ privacy, we identify\npatients by initials other than their own.  We will separately\ntransmit to the State a schedule cross referencing the initials\nwith patient names. \n\n-5­\n\nasthma noted in his evaluation was also not listed under the Axis \nIII diagnoses.  Similarly, the psychiatrist for another patient, \nU.C., failed to assess the possibility of Traumatic Brain Injury \nor to diagnose her with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, despite \nher history of head trauma, prenatal exposure to drugs, sexual \nabuse, and neglect, including an incident resulting in her being \nseriously burned.  Her evaluation also failed to list her past \nmedication history or medications at the time of admission. \nSeparately, Metropolitan’s procedure calls for a preliminary \npsychiatric evaluation on the day of admission to Program 1 and a \nsecond evaluation once the patient is admitted to a specific \nunit.  For several patients, including E.Z., B.P., L.M., X.N., \nC.H., Bc.O., J.U., B.H., and N.T., the information contained in \nthe initial evaluation either was not included in, or conflicted \nwith, the information contained in the second evaluation.  This \nis of particular concern given that the evaluations were \nconducted within one or two days of each other.  Contrary to \ngenerally accepted professional standards, there was no \nindication that the physicians who conducted these evaluations \ncommunicated about their significantly different findings. \nB.  Treatment Planning \nAccording to generally accepted professional standards of \ncare, treatment plans should be individualized and should, at a \nminimum:  (a) identify patients’ diagnoses and symptoms; \n(b) provide interventions to address each diagnosed psychiatric\ndisorder and the associated symptoms; (c) include medication \nplans; (d) provide interventions and treatments to address \ndeficits in cognitive, academic and adaptive functioning, and \naddress any other significant treatment or medical needs; \n(e) provide for monitoring of treatment efficacy; (f) provide for\nmonitoring of medication side effects; (g) include plans to \neducate patients about their medications and other treatment \ninterventions; and (h) identify the barriers to placement in the \nmost integrated appropriate setting and the specific steps to \novercome such barriers.  Metropolitan’s treatment plans often \nfail to include this information and are not updated on a timely \nbasis.  More fundamentally, because Metropolitan fails to \nevaluate or diagnose adequately its patients, it is nearly \nimpossible for it to develop appropriate treatment plans. \n1.  Diagnoses and Symptoms \n\n-6­\n\nIt is a serious concern that many patients have psychiatric \ndisorder diagnoses although their treatment plans did not \nidentify any problems related to psychosis.  Only one of two \nconclusions results from these practices:  either the diagnoses \nare appropriate and treatment teams therefore fail to identify \nthe symptoms of patients’ most serious psychiatric disorders, or \npatients are not experiencing symptoms of psychiatric disorder \ndiagnoses and thus the assigned diagnoses are unjustified. \nNeither possibility is clinically acceptable. \n2.  Interventions \nWe found that nearly every Program 1 treatment plan lists \nthe same generic interventions.  Treatment plans should be \ntailored to meet the individualized needs of the patients, and \nshould take into account factors such as the patient’s \nfunctioning level, cognitive level, history of trauma, and \nmedical conditions.  None of the plans that we reviewed were \nindividualized or sufficiently detailed.  Generic statements such \nas “chemotherapy” or “group therapy” do not offer the level of \ndetail necessary to allow teams to provide adequate treatment. \nFor instance, X.N.’s treatment plan consisted of general \ninterventions:  “chemotherapy, individual therapy, group therapy, \nrecreational therapy, IT assignment, and special educational \nprograms.”  The interventions listed for L.M. and N.Q. contained \nsimilar generic statements. \nFurther, none of the plans that we reviewed included any \ntreatment for, or acknowledgment of, the patients’ severe \ntraumatization and multiple out-of-home placements.  The plans \nalso provided no differentiation between major psychiatric and \nbehavioral problems that were the reason for a patient’s \nhospitalization and relatively trivial problems not requiring \nhospitalization (such as aches and pains). \nThe use of highly restrictive interventions, including the \nuse of seclusion, restraints and/or as-needed (so-called pro re \nnata or “PRN”) medication, should trigger a review of the \neffectiveness of a patient’s treatment plan.  Metropolitan, \nhowever, does not routinely review treatment plans based upon \nthese events, thereby exposing patients to ongoing restrictive \ninterventions and ineffective treatment. \n3.  Cognitive, Academic and Adaptive Functioning \n\n-7­\n\nPsychiatrists must be aware of and take into account \npatients’ cognitive, adaptive and academic levels of functioning \nto make accurate evaluations and diagnoses and for treatment to \nbe appropriate and effective.  A patient’s cognitive abilities \nwill influence significantly her response to Program 1's \nexpectations and the appropriateness of her treatment plans and \ncriteria for discharge.  Her cognitive abilities also will affect \nher understanding of the medications that she is prescribed. \nSystematically, Metropolitan fails to identify and address \npatients’ cognitive, adaptive and academic deficits.  Of the \npatients reviewed who had significant cognitive and/or academic \ndeficits listed in their charts, none had any remediation or \naccommodation for these deficits in their treatment plans. \nTreatment teams seemed unfamiliar with the results of such \ntesting, and they did not express concern that cognitive or \nacademic deficits were reported to have changed from one 90-day \nevaluation to the next.  In many cases, the only reason such \ntesting appeared to be performed was to determine supports and \nservices needed for discharge placement; in particular, to \ndetermine whether the patient could be transferred into \nCalifornia’s system of care for mentally retarded individuals. \nThe following examples are representative of Program 1's \nfailure to identify and address cognitive and academic deficits. \nFirst, K.N.’s diagnosis changed from “Rule Out Mental \nRetardation” in November 1998, to “Moderate Mental Retardation” \nin January 2001, to “Borderline Intellectual Functioning” in \nApril 2002.  No member of his treatment team could explain these \nchanging diagnoses to us, nor did the team include the patient’s \ncognitive/academic deficits as part of his treatment plan. \nSecond, B.Q. had the diagnosis of “Mild Mental Retardation by \nhistory” on admission.  This diagnosis was changed to “Borderline \nIntellectual Functioning” on her first 90-day evaluation without \nany new cognitive testing.  Cognitive testing finally was \nperformed over one year after admission for the purpose of \ndetermining discharge placement.  The results of these tests were \nnot available at the time of our tour, two months after testing \nhad been completed.  Third, D.S. was admitted with a cognitive \ndisorder diagnosis.  He, however, did not have cognitive testing \nuntil one and a half years after admission, at which time \ndischarge was being considered.  The fact that the results of \nD.S.’s test were in the mildly mentally retarded range did not \nresult in any change in his treatment plan. \n\n-8­\n\nProgram 1's practice is to review treatment plans at 90-day \nintervals, after an initial 14-day hospitalization.  This \nexcessively long time period between treatment team meetings does \nnot comport with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare, which call for such meetings at a minimum of every 4 weeks, \nand contributes to excessively long hospitalizations.  The \ninfrequency of treatment team meetings exposes patients to \nheightened psychiatric distress, both from long-term \ninstitutionalization and from potentially deleterious treatments, \nthe effects of which the treatment team is not in a position to \ntimely detect and correct. \nIt is also critical that patients have genuine input into \nand understand their treatment plans and their implementation. \nAlthough Program 1 patients generally sign their treatment plans, \nthere is no evidence that they have any meaningful input into, or \nagreement with, the plans.  We observed treatment teams ignore \nsignificant self-initiated input from patients regarding their \ntreatment during treatment team meetings.  Moreover, there is no \nevidence that patients are educated about or understand the \npurposes of their prescribed medication, medication side effects, \nor the length of time it takes medication to take effect.  As \nexplained below at Section II, nursing and unit staff do not have \nthe knowledge to assist the facility’s children and adolescents \nin understanding these issues.  As a result, medications \nsometimes are changed without clinical justification because \npatients report that the medications are not working, although \nthe prescribed medications may not have had time to work.  In \nthese cases, no documentation was found in the patients’ charts \nto show that staff had educated the patients about the time that \nneeded to elapse before results could be expected. \nFinally, treatment plans do not reflect an interdisciplinary \nprovision of services.  In part this is because Metropolitan has \nnot identified a team member to coordinate the interdisciplinary \ntreatment process.  As a result, no one is accountable or \nresponsible for coordinating patients’ overall treatment.  No one \nensures that treatment plans are developed and reviewed as \nnecessary or that the various disciplines work together to \ndevelop and implement one coordinated, comprehensive plan. \nSimilarly, communication and coordination among treatment team \nmembers and between treatment teams and the school is poor or \nnon-existent.  Staff whom we interviewed stated that various \ndisciplines communicate informally.  In any event, whatever \ncommunication takes place is not properly documented. \n\n-9­\n\nThe care provided to F.Q. illustrates several unacceptable \naspects of Program 1's psychiatric evaluations, diagnoses, \ntreatment planning, and treatment implementation.  During or \nsubsequent to a treatment team meeting for F.Q. that we attended, \nthe team:  (a) focused on whether she had a diagnosis of anorexia \nnervosa, notwithstanding that, given her excess weight, this \ndiagnosis was not clinically possible, and that her desire to \nlose weight was reasonable; (b) failed to discuss a number of her \npsychiatric, Axis I, diagnoses or any specific symptoms \nsupporting these diagnoses; (c) could not provide clinical data \nto support her diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder; (d) failed to \nidentify or discuss her apparent sedation or Parkinsonian \nappearance, acknowledging that they had not evaluated her for \nside effects of medication; (e) failed to address her numerous \nself–initiated comments regarding her problems, needs and \ninterests; (f) appeared unsurprised that she did not know the \nmembers of her treatment team; (g) acknowledged that they had no \nplans to evaluate her cognitive or academic functioning, despite \nthe diagnosis of “Rule Out Borderline Intellectual Functioning”; \nand (h) could not explain the dramatic increase in her \nmedication, conceding that a decrease in dosage may be indicated. \nRegrettably, from our observations, interviews, and document \nreview, F.Q.’s treatment team meeting exemplifies the deficient \ntreatment generally provided in Program 1. \nC.  Psychotropic Medication \nThe use of psychotropic medication always should be \njustified by the clinical needs of a patient.  However, as \npreviously explained, Program 1's use of psychotropic medication \nrarely is justified in that patients frequently are medicated \nbased upon clinically unjustified diagnoses.  Documentation does \nnot support the types of medications being prescribed, the doses \nprescribed, or either the extended lengths of time that \nmedications are prescribed in some cases or the rapid change of \nmedications in others.  Rather, several of the psychiatrists’ \nnotes give the impression that there is little or no analysis \nconducted when choosing the patients’ medication regimens. \nFurthermore, many patients are routinely prescribed \ninappropriate medications.  Numerous patients, such as M.D. and \nN.H., were prescribed medications that are appropriate for \nchronically mentally ill adults, not children or adolescents. \nPsychiatrists also commonly prescribed older antipsychotic \n\n-10­\n\nmedications, such as Thorazine and Haldol, as part of patients’ \nregular medication regimens or as medication to be used as a PRN. \nIn view of the fact that these older antipsychotic medications \nhave a host of serious side effects that the newer atypical \nantipsychotic medications do not have, the use of these \nmedications in an adolescent population is an outdated, \npotentially harmful, medication practice.  Moreover, these \nmedications were prescribed for at least 21 children and \nadolescents without any documented clinical justification.  It \nappears that these medications are prescribed to control \nindividuals’ behaviors in lieu of an appropriate medication \nregimen and/or of therapeutic treatment interventions. \nAlso, although modification of medications is appropriate at \ntimes, Metropolitan’s psychiatrists often recommend medication \nchanges frequently and abruptly without any documented rationale \nfor the change.  This practice is unsafe, given that such changes \ncan exacerbate or precipitate an individual’s symptoms. \nFurther, it is generally accepted that, in most instances, \npsychotropic medication should be used to treat psychosis.  When \npsychotropic medication is prescribed to treat symptoms other \nthan psychosis, this practice should be documented clearly with a \nspecific plan for minimizing the dosage and duration of the use \nof the medication.  As indicated above, more than one Program 1 \npsychiatrist acknowledged prescribing psychotropic medication to \nreduce aggression and agitation rather than to treat psychosis, \nand acknowledged manufacturing diagnoses to justify this \npractice.  Assigning psychiatric diagnoses to patients who do not \nmeet the diagnostic criteria for such diagnoses in order to \njustify the use of psychotropic medication is an unacceptable \nmedical practice. \nPsychiatrists also prescribe medication for purposes that \nhave no mention in current or past literature and for which their \nuse has no known pharmacological basis.  This form of so-called \n“off-label” medication usage is considered speculatively \nexperimental, should be practiced ethically only under the \nsupervision of an institutional review board, and requires a \npatient’s and/or guardian’s clear consent.  Program 1 does not \nmeet any of these requirements.  For example, a number of \npatients are prescribed Naltrexone, a psychotropic, to treat a \nhost of different behavioral problems.  Metropolitan’s medical \nadministration appeared unaware that this was occurring. \nAlthough documentation reflected that the off-label usage of this \n\n-11­\n\nmedication was approved by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics (“P&T”) \nCommittee, there is no institutional review board to provide \noversight, there is no experimental design to monitor this \npractice, and there has been no effort to obtain patients’ and/or \nguardians’ informed consent. \nDespite the fact that many of the medications that are \nprescribed for Program 1's children and adolescents have \npotentially serious, and often irreversible side effects, such as \ntardive dyskinesia, Metropolitan has no standardized instrument \nin place to assess regularly these side effects.  Similarly, \ntreatment plans do not include plans for monitoring potential \nside effects.  Without objective measures in place to identify \nmedication side effects at an early stage, Program 1's children \nand adolescents are at risk of developing potentially \nirreversible complications. \nWhen potential side effects of psychotropic medication are \nidentified, Metropolitan’s response is inadequate and \ninappropriate.  For instance, E.Z.’s physical examination \nindicated that he had gynecomastia (development of prominent \nbreast tissue in a male), a potential side effect of one of his \nmedications.  There was no indication, however, that this was \never addressed or evaluated further.  Similarly, several \nindividuals suffer constipation related to psychotic medication \nuse.  Rather than reassess the medications for these individuals, \nclinicians rely on the chronic administration of stool softeners \nand laxatives, an unacceptable medical practice for this \npopulation. \nD.  Therapeutic Environment \nAs part of its psychiatric treatment, generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care dictate that Program 1 should \nprovide a therapeutic environment that minimizes the deleterious \neffects of institutionalization (namely, the compounding of \nchildrens’ and adolescents’ psychiatric problems such that their \ndevelopmental trajectory is further compromised) and is conducive \nto the treatment of severely psychiatrically disturbed and \ntraumatized children and adolescents.  In providing a therapeutic \nenvironment, there should be a structure comprised of community \nrules, meetings, and social interactions that help patients learn \nadaptive coping skills, improve self-esteem, and develop positive \nskills (“milieu structure”).  The environment in Program 1 does \n\n-12­\n\nnot meet any of these goals.  Rather, Program 1 is characterized \nby a great shortage of staff-initiated, positive interactions. \nWe saw few positive, spontaneous, therapeutic interactions \nin which staff initiated and facilitated a patient’s expression \nof feelings, connected a patient’s behavior with feelings, \nemployed a “teachable moment” technique, or started a meaningful, \npositive staff-to-patient or patient-to-patient exchange.  Staff \ntypically failed to use natural social experiences, such as \ndistribution of snacks, doing chores, or engaging in recreational \nactivities, to promote positive social functioning.  Rather, \nstaff’s interactions with the individuals on the units were \nmainly reactive and/or directive in nature, and at times resulted \nin power struggles with patients, exacerbating crisis situations. \nSimilarly, we observed a lack of staff-facilitated, age \nappropriate patient-to-patient interactions.  Patients appeared \nbored, over-medicated, ignored and/or upset.  Program 1's failure \nto provide an appropriate health-promoting environment is \nunacceptable and does not meet generally accepted professional \nstandards of care. \nProgram 1's milieu structure is largely based upon a Point \nand Level System.  Staff appear to believe that this system \nmotivates patients to the extent that simply the interaction \nbetween patients and the system constitutes active milieu \ntherapy.  We found numerous serious deficiencies with this \nsystem. \nThe Point System is a complex process that neither patients \nnor staff are likely to understand adequately.  The system does \nnot allow for consistent, accurate or individualized application \nof points across residential units and/or schools.  Points are \nnot distributed contingent upon the occurrence of behaviors, and \nthey are not distributed frequently and immediately in \nassociation with those behaviors.  Consequently, their intended \ntherapeutic effect is negated.  The number of points that \nstudents can earn at school - ten percent of their total daily \npoints - significantly undervalues the educational portion of \ntheir lives.  Most significantly, points are not utilized in a \ntherapeutic way to connect a patient’s behaviors with feelings or \nto identify more effective coping strategies. \nSimilarly, the Level System is very complex.  Children and \nadolescents who are severely mentally ill and traumatized, many \nof whom have cognitive impairments, are highly unlikely to \n\n-13­\n\nunderstand it.  Procedures by which patients’ levels are dropped \nor raised are not defined clearly.  It is virtually certain that, \nin light of their histories of abuse and trauma, many Program 1 \npatients will experience the system as arbitrary and punitive, \nthereby negating any therapeutic effect.  The fact that this \nsystem is a key component to determining patients’ attainment of \ndischarge criteria makes it even more troubling.\n Program 1's physical environment is also deficient.  Given \nProgram 1's population, the physical environment should, within \nthe bounds of safety, promote privacy, individuality, creativity, \nand the opportunity for recreational activities to minimize the \neffects of institutionalization and promote positive social \nbehavior.  However, we found problems in all of these areas. \nAs a primary matter, patients’ rights to privacy and \nconfidentiality are breached by the public distribution of \nmedication and the posting of patient-specific information on \npublically visible boards.  More broadly, recreational equipment \nwas limited to televisions, damaged basketball nets, and often-\nviolent video games.  The courtyards, which appear to be used \nrarely by patients, are in disrepair and poorly equipped. \nAlthough the facility has a fenced playing field, not once during \nour multiple trips around facility grounds during our two five-\nday visits did we see any children or adolescents on it. \nMany of Program 1's problems in providing adequate \npsychiatric services are the result of a lack of leadership and \ndirection by psychiatrists and senior administration.  There is \nno evidence of medical staff providing leadership in treatment \nteams or during periods in which patients are experiencing acute \npsychiatric distress.  Indeed, there was scant acknowledgment, at \nleadership and administrative levels, that extended \ninstitutionalization frequently exacerbates existing psychiatric \nproblems of children and adolescents.  In important respects, the \nadministration’s focus lies elsewhere; various Metropolitan \ndocuments identify the facility’s “clients” as, not the children \nthemselves, but rather the counties from which they come. \nII.  NURSING \nProgram 1's nursing services substantially depart from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care and treatment \nand expose the children and adolescents there to a significant \nrisk of harm and actual harm.  These deficits derive from nursing \n\n-14­\n\nand unit staff’s:  (a) failure to identify, monitor and report \npatients’ symptoms and side effects of medications; \n(b) unfamiliarity with mental health diagnoses, associated\nsymptoms, and appropriate treatments and interventions; (c) lack \nof knowledge regarding their patients; and (d) ineffective \nparticipation in the treatment team process. \nMany nursing and unit staff appear to lack adequate support, \ntraining and supervision.  Metropolitan leadership does not \nencourage Program 1 nursing and unit staff to communicate with \nother team members to solve problems proactively.  As a result, \nnursing and unit staff respond to patient needs in a largely \nreactive way.  This, in turn, exposes Program 1's children and \nadolescents to excessive and inappropriate uses of medication; \nseclusion, and restraints; inadequate and ineffective therapeutic \ninterventions; and unnecessary institutionalization. \nA.  Monitoring and Reporting of Patients’ Symptoms \nGenerally accepted professional practice requires that \npatients’ treatment plans identify the interventions and \nstrategies to be utilized by nursing and unit staff to address \nthe symptoms of patients’ diagnoses, the symptoms to be \nmonitored, and the frequency with which the symptoms are to be \nmonitored.  It is essential for nursing and unit staff to \nmonitor, document and report patients’ symptoms for the treatment \nteam to determine if the implemented interventions are adequate \nor require modification.  The psychiatrists who prescribe \nmedications and the psychologists and social workers who oversee \nother therapeutic interventions rely on nursing and unit staff to \ncollect and report this information.  Nursing and other unit \nstaff are on the unit 24-hours a day, seven days a week; they can \nand should record and report this information.  Program 1 nursing \nand unit staff do not properly monitor, document and report such \ninformation.  In part, this is because Program 1's treatment \nplans generally do not identify the symptoms to be monitored or \nthe frequency with which staff should monitor them. \nMetropolitan does not appear to have a system in place to \ncollect and analyze such information on a regular basis or to \nutilize such information in the reassessment and treatment plan \nrevision process.  Without objective measures in place to \ndetermine the effectiveness of the interventions being used, \nProgram 1's patients are likely to receive inappropriate and \nineffective treatment interventions for long periods of time, and \n\n-15­\n\nto be exposed to excessive or inappropriate uses of medications, \nseclusion, and/or restraints. \nStaff who administer medication should know what the \nmedication is for, know what results it is intended to achieve \nand when, and know the symptoms of the disorder that the \nmedication is supposed to address.  As a general matter, the \nProgram 1 nurses are unfamiliar with the purposes of the \nmedication they administer, and a number of nurses we interviewed \nwere unable to identify the symptoms associated with the disorder \nfor which a particular medication was prescribed.  This lack of \nbasic clinical knowledge contributes to nursing staff’s failure \nto monitor and report patients’ symptoms. \nB.  Monitoring of Medication Side Effects \nGenerally accepted professional practice requires that \nnursing staff monitor patients for potential side effects of \nmedications.  However, Metropolitan nursing staff responsible for \nthe day-to-day care of patients do not monitor, document or \nreport evidence of side effects on a regular basis.  This is in \npart because, as stated above, treatment plans do not include \nplans for monitoring potential side effects.  Even when nursing \nstaff do identify patients who are experiencing side effects, \nthey do not take adequate action to notify the prescribing \nphysicians and to ensure that appropriate follow-up occurs.  The \ncharts of a number of patients included notes indicating that \nnursing staff had witnessed side effects such as drooling, but \nthey failed to report this to the prescribing physician and/or \ndocument the symptom on a more formal basis, such as through \nstandarized instruments that measure and record medication side \neffects. \nC.  Participation in Treatment Team Process \nNursing and unit staff consistently demonstrated a lack of \nknowledge regarding the therapeutic process.  Many could not \nprovide essential information about the individuals on their \nunits such as the level of family involvement, issues being \npursued in therapy, symptoms of Axis I disorders, reasons for \nmedication changes, or options for discharge.  Without nurses’ \nknowledge of this crucial information, the units cannot function \nadequately as therapeutic environments. \n\n-16­\n\nIt is generally accepted professional practice for nursing \nstaff, as well as other staff who provide direct support to \npatients, to participate as active members of the treatment team. \nBecause these staff work on a daily basis with the children and \nadolescents of Program 1, they likely know the patients best. \nHowever, Program 1 nursing and unit staff do not participate \nmeaningfully in the treatment team process.  Generally speaking, \nProgram 1 nursing and unit staff do not appear to understand \ntherapeutic tools or how to implement them.  Nursing staff do not \nknow the children’s and adolescents’ histories, especially the \nfamily histories, which is where mental health issues often \nstart.  Nurses do not appear to understand their role as \npsychiatric nurses. \nThis lack of knowledge and skills places nurses and other \nunit staff at a disadvantage in the team process.  Without \nadequate knowledge and skills, nursing and unit staff cannot \ncontribute meaningfully to the development of treatment plans and \ninterventions; cannot challenge other team members to consider \nalternative diagnoses, medications or interventions when those in \nplace do not appear to be correct; cannot implement interventions \neffectively; and cannot provide a therapeutic milieu.  This \nultimately results in the children and adolescents of Program 1 \nreceiving inadequate treatment and care. \nIII.  PSYCHOLOGY \nProgram 1's psychological services and behavioral \ninterventions substantially depart from generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care and expose the children and \nadolescents of Program 1 to significant risk of harm and to \nactual harm.  The deficiencies include inadequate clinical \nassessments; insufficient, inappropriate active treatment; and \ninadequate behavioral interventions.  The harm to these children \nand adolescents takes many forms, among them, perpetuating their \nemotional behavioral difficulties; unnecessarily extending their \nstay in a highly restrictive setting; diminishing their sense of \nself worth; subjecting them to excessive use of seclusion, \nrestraints, or sedating medications; fostering despair and \nhopelessness; and, in some cases, depriving them of physical \nsafety. \nA.  Psychological Evaluations \n\n-17­\n\nIn attempting to determine the psychological problems and \nneeds of children and adolescents, it is critical that \npsychologists and direct care staff observe and assess them on a \nregular basis.  However, clinical staff infrequently observe and \ndirectly assess the children and adolescents in their care. \nConsequently, in making treatment decisions, clinicians fail to \nconsider important aspects of both the patients’ clinical status \nand their level of functioning.  This deficiency is exacerbated \nby the lack of a hospital policy dictating when psychological \nevaluations are to be updated. \nPsychological evaluations should identify and address \npsychiatric issues when such issues are present.  Program 1 \nevaluations frequently fail to do so.  For instance, although \nM.C.’s psychological evaluation on admission identified no \npsychiatric issues, he subsequently was psychiatrically diagnosed \nwith Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features.  Notwithstanding \nthat psychiatric diagnosis, his psychological evaluation was not \nupdated.  Consequently, either M.C.’s psychiatric diagnosis was \nwrong or his psychological evaluation was significantly \ndeficient.\n Similarly, as discussed in Section I, psychological \nevaluations should identify and address functional abilities.  In \nthis regard, “Mental Retardation” and “Borderline Intellectual \nFunctioning” are distinct categories of intellectual assessment \nthat should trigger different treatment interventions. \nMetropolitan’s psychological evaluations often do not recognize \nthis distinction.  For example, K.N. was admitted to Metropolitan \nwith a diagnosis of “Rule Out Mental Retardation,” and shortly \nthereafter was assessed as having a full-scale IQ of 54 – well \ninto the range of mental retardation.  Nevertheless, without \ndocumented justification, his diagnosis was changed to \n“Borderline Intellectual Functioning.” \nPsychological evaluations also must address relevant \ncomponents of particular disorders, but Program 1's evaluations \nfrequently do not.  For instance, O.N. was diagnosed with \nAutistic Disorder, but nowhere in his chart was it evident that \nhis speech and language had been evaluated, notwithstanding that \nan understanding of an autistic patient’s communication abilities \nis essential in shaping appropriate interventions. \nQuestions generated in psychological evaluations should be \nanswered, not left unresolved for extended periods of time. \n\n-18­\n\nFailure to address promptly questions fundamental to a correct \npsychological evaluation undercuts the evaluation’s efficacy. \nNevertheless, a Metropolitan psychologist informed us that it was \nnot unusual for unresolved diagnoses (so-called “rule out \ndiagnoses”) to remain open for 10 to 12 months.  For example, \nE.H. was admitted in April 1999 with “Rule Out Mild Mental\nRetardation.”  That unresolved diagnosis was in place when we \ntoured the facility more than three years later.  In fact, a \nnumber of patients went through their entire treatment regimen \nand were discharged with one or more unresolved diagnoses.  This \nproblem is exacerbated by nursing and unit staff’s failure to \nmonitor, document and report patients’ symptoms as discussed \nabove. \nThe foregoing deficiencies signal that Program 1 treatment \nteams undervalue psychological evaluations.  Evidence of this \ncomes from various charts, such as S.N.’s and F.U.’s, that do not \neven contain a psychological evaluation.  The evaluations \napparently had been removed from the active charts in \ncontravention of facility policy.  Further evidence that the \nfacility disregards the importance of psychological evaluations \nis its failure to use Spanish-language testing tools for patients \nwhose primary language is Spanish.  Metropolitan identified 11 \nsuch patients at the time of our tour. \nThese problems lead to inaccurate, incomplete, and \nunreliable evaluations, which in turn leave the appropriateness \nof the psychological interventions to chance.  This is a \nsubstantial departure from generally accepted professional \nstandards of care that subjects Program 1 patients to the risk of \nharm and actual harm, in the form of untreated psychological \ndisorders and psychological disorders that are worsened through \ninappropriate treatment. \nB.  Active Treatment \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care call for \nevidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, that is, \ninterventions that are empirically supported as effective. \nProgram 1 policy does not reflect such a standard.  Instead, it \nunspecifically states that “[e]ach patient shall be provided with \nan individualized program of treatment activity which reflects \nthe program’s highest level of performance and the optimal level \nof patient participation.” \n\n-19­\n\nIn any event, activity logs indicate that a number of \nchildren and adolescents receive virtually no active treatment. \nThat is, they have scant participation in individual and group \ntherapy or in activities of leisure and recreation. \nAttendance records indicate that some children receive as \nlittle as one-half hour of individual therapy and 30 total hours \nof structured therapeutic activity, a month.  One patient \nreceived no recorded therapeutic activities for a 12-day period, \nother than participation in 30-minute group meetings at which the \npatients’ points for behavior, treatment and school participation \nare announced.  Metropolitan staff could not identify any current \nactive treatment for patient T.T.’s primary diagnosis of Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder.  Further, although T.T. also carries a \ndiagnosis of polysubstance abuse, she reportedly has attended a \nsubstance abuse group only once and apparently is receiving no \nother substance abuse interventions.  Moreover, most patients we \nreviewed receive no family therapy, despite the fact that many \nhave significant traumatic family histories. \nFurther, as explained in Section I, above, there is little \nevidence of spontaneous, positive social interactions, especially \ninteractions initiated by staff.  There is also little evidence \nthat the courtyards and free time are used constructively to \nenhance patients’ lives.  In summary, the amount of active \ntreatment that Program 1 patients actually receive is alarmingly \nlow. \nSeparately, there are a number of concerns with the quality \nof individual and group therapy.  To be effective, individual \npsychological therapy should be available to patients in their \nprimary language.  Moreover, Metropolitan is a provider of health \nand social services that receives federal financial assistance \nfrom the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  As such, \nit is required to provide Limited English Proficient (“LEP”) \npersons such language assistance as is necessary to afford them \nmeaningful access to these services, free of charge.  Title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq.; 45 \nC.F.R. § 80.3(b).  See also Policy Guidance on the Prohibition \nAgainst National Origin Discrimination as It Affects Persons with \nLimited English Proficiency, 65 Fed. Reg. 52762 (Aug. 30, \n2000)(“Health and social service providers must take adequate \nsteps to ensure that [LEP] persons receive the language \nassistance necessary to afford them meaningful access to their \nservices, free of charge.”); 28 C.F.R. § 42.405 (d)(1) (“ Where a \n\n-20­\n\nsignificant number or proportion of the population eligible to be \nserved or likely to be directly affected by a federally assisted \nprogram . . . needs service or information in a language other \nthan English in order effectively to be informed of or to \nparticipate in the program, the recipient shall take reasonable \nsteps, considering the scope of the program and the size and \nconcentration of such population, to provide information in \nappropriate languages to such persons.”)  Notwithstanding these \nobligations, Metropolitan has a significant number of primarily \nSpanish-speaking patients, such as F.U., whose therapists do not \nspeak Spanish. \nIn any event, there is also little indication that the \ntherapy sessions have an effective impact on individuals’ \noutcomes.  For example, inconsistent documentation indicates that \nJ.U. received somewhere between 6 and 12 hours of individual\ntherapy from February to May 2002.  From late April to late May, \nshe received five psychotropic PRNs and was placed in seclusion \nand/or restraints on 16 occasions.  Similarly, T.T. received \napproximately 4½ hours of individual therapy from March to May \n2002.  She received no family therapy despite her issues \nregarding family dysfunction and her family’s active visitation. \nFrom early April to early May, she received 12 psychotropic PRNs \nand was placed in seclusion and/or restraints on 11 occasions. \nThese examples reflect Metropolitan’s failure to provide the \nnecessary therapeutic interventions to treat appropriately and \neffectively the children and adolescents in its care. \nThe group therapy provided at Metropolitan is inadequate. \nOnly 9 of the 157 group therapy/activity protocols that we \nreviewed for Program 1 contained interventions or approaches that \nwere empirically supported as effective.  Groups are provided too \ninfrequently and inconsistently.  In particular, Metropolitan is \nnot providing adequate substance abuse or medication groups -­\ncritical groups for this population given that all of the \npatients are taking psychotropic medications and many have drug \nand alcohol issues. \nFurther, the lack of clinical oversight of group therapy \nraises serious concerns.  Generally accepted professional \nstandards of care require that such oversight be provided to: \n(a) determine a patient’s readiness to participate in a group;\n(b) identify the group(s) that will provide therapeutic value to\nthe individual; and (c) follow the patient’s progress in the \ngroup(s) and regularly re-assess the appropriateness of the \n\n-21-\n\ngroup(s) based on the patient’s individualized needs.  Program \n1's group therapy lacks any such clinical oversight, thereby \nexposing its patients to serious risk of harm.  For example, many \nof the children and adolescents served by Program 1 have \nhistories of being subjected to abuse.  By placing these patients \nin groups in which subjects such as abuse are discussed prior to \nassessing their readiness to participate in such a group, \nMetropolitan is potentially re-traumatizing these children and \nadolescents.  This is further exacerbated by making attendance at \ngroups a requirement for earning points in the point system and \nultimately for being considered for placement in a more \nintegrated setting. \nThe quality of milieu programs (which are programs \napplicable to all patients and are to help them learn adaptive \ncoping skills, improve self-esteem, and develop positive skills) \nappears also to be inadequate, as evidenced by the number of \npatients, such as Ui.N., Bc.O., I.X., and D.C., who have opted to \nmiss almost as much as a month of school, and the many patients \nwho “refuse to participate” in group therapy, according to their \ncharts.  High rates of treatment refusal convey a message \nregarding the quality of the treatment and should trigger an \nurgent assessment of programming and/or the patient, but this \ndoes not occur at Program 1.  Moreover, patients whose group \ntherapy attendance qualifies them for desirable activities, such \nas weekly community outings, are sometimes told that they cannot \nparticipate in these activities because of staffing constraints, \nwhich diminishes whatever therapeutic effectiveness group \nprogramming might have. \nThe efficacy of psychological treatments is further undercut \nby the use of excessive sedation for several Program 1 patients. \nDuring our tour, we frequently observed patients sleeping in day \nrooms during free time, sleeping in school classes, and sleeping \nduring group activities.  Many other patients were awake but \nshowed signs of heavy sedation.  Excessive sedation does not \ncomport with generally accepted professional standards of care. \nRather, it indicates inappropriate reliance on medication to \nmanage patient behavior and restricts participation in treatment \nand educational programming.  It also fosters a mentality that \nbehavior cannot be internally and voluntarily controlled. \nFurther, it prolongs patients’ stay in a highly restrictive \nenvironment. \n\n-22­\n\nIndependent of the quality of therapy, the documentation of \nindividual and group therapy and group activities is \nfundamentally insufficient, stating neither the nature of the \ninterventions employed nor the patients’ responses.  For example, \ndocumentation regarding I.X. is limited to general statements in \nthe nursing notes, such as “has been . . . attending group,” and \nvarious lists of the groups in which I.X. has participated. \nSimilarly, the notes for B.S. by the physician, social worker, \nand psychologist do not even mention group treatment, and the \nnurse’s notes contain only general statements, such as “[p]atient \nparticipates in groups.”  Consequently, it is not possible to \ngauge accurately the efficacy of particular treatments or assess \nthe patient’s progress relative to those treatments.  In \naddition, patients’ records often indicated that individual \ntherapy was provided when therapy progress notes did not.  These \ndiscrepancies call into question the integrity of the \ndocumentation as well the actual provision of services. \nIn any event, the dearth of effective active treatment \ninterventions predictably contributes to poor patient progress in \nmeeting treatment goals and discharge criteria.  E.H. is \nillustrative.  E.H. was admitted to the facility in April 1999. \nDuring our tour, personnel on his unit contemplated relaxing the \nstandard discharge criteria, such that E.H. could be discharged \nif he maintained Level 3, the highest level of performance, for \none month.  Even this standard fails to recognize the \nineffectiveness of E.H.’s treatments; in the more than three \nyears that E.H. has resided at Metropolitan, this patient has \nachieved Level 3 one time. \nE.H. illustrates the predicament of many of Metropolitan’s\nchildren and adolescents.  The failure to reach benchmarks that \nMetropolitan has determined to be achievable for patients like \nhim primarily reflects, not his personal failings, but rather the \nshortcomings of the treatments he receives; E.H. is not receiving \ntreatments that will allow him to maintain Level 3 long enough to \nleave the facility. \nIn summary, it is apparent that Program 1's active treatment \ninterventions are too infrequent, are of inadequate quality, and \nare insufficiently documented.  These deficiencies result in \nunnecessarily extended hospital stays, and they likely exacerbate \npsychological symptoms and increase feelings of hopelessness and \nemotional distress. \n\n-23­\n\nC.  Behavioral Interventions \nBehavioral intervention is a fundamental component of any \nappropriate treatment program for children and adolescents with \nemotional and behavioral disorders.  Behavioral intervention \noccurs in milieu, or structural, context and on an individual \nlevel.  In general terms, the objective of behavioral \nintervention is to facilitate other forms of treatment by \ncontrolling environmental conditions and shaping responses to \nenvironmental conditions.  Shaping of responses occurs most \ntypically through the consistent, comprehensible imposition of \nconsequences that increase desirable behavior and decrease \nundesirable behavior.  Virtually every aspect of Program 1's \nbehavioral treatment programs is profoundly below generally \naccepted professional standards of care. \n1.  Milieu Programs \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care for \nbehavioral programming call for the identification of specific, \n“operationally defined” “target” behaviors and the provision of \nconsistent responses across settings to those behaviors.  (In \ngeneral terms, “operationally defined” means behaviors that are \nspecified with particularity such that different observers can \nagree whether the behavior has occurred, and “target” behaviors \nmeans behaviors identified for treatment.)  Behavioral \nprogramming that departs from these standards is virtually \ncertain to fail and may exacerbate behavioral problems. \nPerhaps the most prominent aspect of Program 1's milieu \nprograms is its Point and Level System, the deficiencies of which \nare discussed above, at Section I.  Independent of the Point and \nLevel System, target behaviors in Program 1 behavior programs \nwere stated in vague terms.  Many patients’ behavior programs \nincluded one target behavior for the unit, addressed only in the \nunit, and a different target behavior for the school, addressed \nonly in the school.  Thus, contrary to generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care, Program 1 does not ensure that \nresponses to targeted behaviors are consistent across \nenvironments.  Further, in at least one unit, the treatment \nteam’s review of, and changes to, target behaviors were not \ndocumented.  In this regard, there was no effective means of \ntracking patient progress relative to the targeted behavior. \n\n-24­\n\nThese problems severely restrict any benefit of the milieu \nprograms and serve to frustrate and confuse patients. \n2.  Individual Behavioral Planning \nGenerally speaking, individual behavioral assessment is the \ncareful examination of patient behaviors and the settings and \ncircumstances in which they occur for purposes of developing \nappropriate interventions for undesirable behaviors and \nreinforcing desirable behaviors.  Under generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care, this assessment is done through a \nfunctional analysis or functional assessment, which determines \nthe purpose of the behavior and helps identify appropriate \nreplacement behaviors. \nAs an initial matter, it is not clear that psychologists are \naware of relevant behavioral data, including episodes of \nseclusion and restraints, which is essential in developing \nappropriate behavior support.  Facility chart “thinning” \nguidelines dictate that the most recent three months of clinical \ndata must be kept in the active chart, but we reviewed active \ncharts from which recent instances of seclusion and/or restraints \nhad been removed.  T.T. is an example.  Data regarding 15 \nepisodes of seclusion or seclusion/restraints occurring in the \nthree months just before our tour were “thinned” from T.T.’s \nactive chart and placed in another chart intended to store dated \ninformation.  Further, as indicated in Section II, Metropolitan \ndoes not have procedures in place to ensure that nursing and unit \nstaff reliably monitor, document and report patients’ symptoms \nand behaviors. \nProgram 1 behavioral supports are prepared without an \nadequate analysis of undesirable behaviors.  The individual \nbehavior treatment plans for F.U., I.X., D.Q., and N.Q., were \nprepared without a functional analysis or assessment of the \nbehaviors which the plans are to address.  One unit psychologist \nacknowledged that he had received no training in conducting \nfunctional behavioral assessments and was not aware of any tools \nfor performing such assessments.  The psychologist on another \nunit stated that systematic tools for conducting functional \nassessments were not available in the hospital. \nThe Program 1 individual behavior treatment plans are \nidentified interchangeably as “special treatment plans” or \n“behavioral treatment plans.”  It appears that they are prepared \n\n-25­\n\nwithout adherence to specific criteria regarding methodologies or \nrequired components; the plans that we reviewed lack a common \nstructure or approach.  Their lack of functional analysis, of \nconsistent, justifiable methodology, and of uniform components \nare shortcomings that significantly depart from generally \naccepted professional standards of care. \nSeparately, the triggers for performing behavioral \nassessments are poorly conceived.  Consequently, individual \nbehavior treatment plans are developed too rarely.  In this \nregard, generally accepted professional standards of care require \na clearly defined behavioral response, such as a behavioral \ntreatment plan, to repeated episodes of highly restrictive \ninterventions.  However, Metropolitan policy requires \nindividualized behavioral treatment plans only after the use of \none-to-one supervision for 72 hours, due to harmful, or \npotentially harmful, behaviors. \nIndeed, many patients are placed in seclusion and restraints \nrepeatedly without triggering a behavioral assessment.  Although \nT.T. was placed in seclusion and restraints 17 times over the 90-\nday period reviewed, and was subjected to PRN psychotropic \nmedications 13 times over the 85-day period reviewed, T.T. did \nnot have an individual behavior treatment plan.  An intervention, \nof sorts, had been in place, but that was limited to T.T. \nreporting hourly to the nursing staff and was terminated because \nT.T. reportedly was uncooperative.  Similarly, O.I. had 19 \nepisodes of seclusion or restraints and 18 episodes of PRN \nmedication in the period of slightly less than three months \nimmediately preceding our Program 1 tour, but O.I. did not have \nan individual behavior treatment plan.  Program 1 personnel \nindicated to us that, as a general matter, the decision to begin \ntracking individual behaviors was made informally. \nFurther, when behavioral interventions were developed, in at \nleast some cases they were prepared with inordinate delay. \nUi.N.’s chart indicates that a functional analysis of U.N.’s \nbehavior was conducted in July 2001, followed by behavior \ntracking in October 2001 and the development of a “Special \nTreatment Plan” dated May 7, 2002.  This example highlights not \nonly a significant delay in treatment, but also another serious, \nmore fundamental problem, which is that the facility is \nlackadaisical in responding to children and adolescents who are \nin need of urgent care and for whom extended institutionalization \nitself causes harm, by compounding their psychiatric problems. \n\n-26­\n\nWhen developed, the behavioral interventions are deficient \nin nearly every significant respect.  They:  (a) frequently are \nnot prepared based on a functional analysis of behaviors, as in \nthe plans of I.X., D.Q., Bc.O. and N.Q.; (b) describe target \nbehaviors too broadly for the behaviors to be identified and \ntracked consistently, as in the plans for Ui.N., I.X., D.Q. and \nN.Q.; (c) do not sufficiently prescribe which environmental and \nconsequential factors should be altered, as in the plans for \nUi.N., I.X., D.Q., Bc.O., F.N. and N.Q.; (d) are internally \ninconsistent, as in the plans for Ui.N. and I.X.; (e) lack a \nreliable method to insure integrity of implementation, as in the \nplans for Ui.N., I.X. and D.Q.; and (f) lack criteria for \nrevision or termination, as in the plans for Ui.N., I.X., D.Q. \nand N.Q. \nAlthough Metropolitan has a Behavioral Treatment Review \nCommittee charged with evaluating and approving behavioral \ntreatments before they are implemented and with providing \nguidance to the psychologists preparing behavioral interventions, \nit is clear from the foregoing discussion that this committee is \nnot functional.  In fact, we could find no committee minutes for \nMarch and April 2002.  The lack of quality control, guidance and \nleadership emanating from this committee conveys a message of \nindifference to the persons charged with providing adequate \npsychological care, indifference to the therapeutic importance of \nthat care, and indifference to the children and adolescents who \nneed but are not receiving adequate psychological care.  That \nmessage of indifference contributes to the deficient \npsychological care at Program 1 and the resulting harm to its \npatients. \nD.\t Use of Seclusion, Restraints and “As-Needed” \n\nMedications\n\nProgram 1's use of seclusion, restraints and “as-needed” \n(also known as pro re nata or “PRN”) medications substantially \ndeparts from generally accepted professional standards of care \nand exposes the children and adolescents there to excessive and \nunnecessary restrictive interventions.  It is generally accepted \nprofessional practice that seclusion and restraints will only be \nused when a person is a danger to self or others and when all \nother less restrictive measures have been attempted but failed. \nIt also is generally accepted professional practice that \nseclusion and restraints will not be used in the absence of \ntreatment or as punishment and will be terminated as soon as the \n\n-27­\n\nperson is no longer a danger to himself or others.  Finally, \naccording to generally accepted professional medication \npractices, PRN medications should be used for psychiatric \npurposes only as a short-term measure to relieve a patient in \nacute distress, not as means to escape mild, possibly healthy, \ndiscomfort or as a repeatedly deployed substitute for treatment \nof the patient’s underlying condition. \nMetropolitan Program 1 staff use seclusion, restraints \nand/or PRN medications in the absence of adequate treatment \nand/or as punishment.  Many episodes of seclusion, restraints \nand/or PRN medication use occur as a result of Program 1 patients \nexhibiting symptoms of their mental health disorders.  Without \nthe benefit of appropriate medication and therapeutic \ninterventions, the children and adolescents are unable to control \nsuch symptoms.  As a result of inadequate mental health \ntreatment, children and adolescents are exposed to excessive use \nof seclusion, restraints, and/or PRN medications. \nMoreover, we found numerous incidents in which patients \nexhibited behaviors that initially were not a danger to \nthemselves or others, but because nursing and unit staff \nexacerbated their behaviors, the patients were ultimately \nsubjected to seclusion, restraints and/or PRN medications. \nBecause many Program 1 staff are not skilled in de-escalating \ntheir patients’ behaviors, and because the patients lack adequate \nbehavior support plans, staff frequently engage in power \nstruggles with the patients.  The documentation that is intended \nto reflect the interventions that staff attempted to use before \nseclusion, restraints and/or PRN medications does not indicate \nthat staff had attempted other, less restrictive interventions. \nWhenever a seclusion, restraint and/or PRN medication is \nused, it is generally accepted professional practice for the \ninterdisciplinary team to reassess interventions and, as \nnecessary, to modify the treatment plan to ensure that adequate \nproactive measures are identified and implemented.  Frequent use \nof seclusion, restraints and/or PRN medications is an indicator \nthat an individual’s diagnosis is erroneous and/or that the \ntreatment plan is inappropriate.  Program 1 is failing to review \npatients’ treatment plans after such episodes.  There were \nnumerous patient charts that, on one hand, identified frequent \nseclusion, restraint and/or PRN medication episodes but, on the \nother, contained no documentation that the team had reviewed the \ntreatment plan or considered alternative interventions.  For \n\n-28­\n\nexample, J.U. was placed in seclusion and/or restraints on 19 \noccasions between April 16 and June 17, 2002.  O.I. was placed in \nseclusion and/or restraints on 20 occasions between April 4 and \nMay 30, 2002.  S.N. was placed in seclusion and/or restraints on \n18 occasions between April 2, 2002 and June 29, 2002.  We found \nno evidence that any of these patients’ treatment plans were \nreassessed or that other interventions were utilized before \nrestraints.  Moreover, staff frequently failed to document any \ninformation about the patients’ status before, after or between \nepisodes of seclusion, restraint and/or PRN medication use, \nmaking it difficult to improve the treatment plans. \nAlthough Program 1 has made efforts to address its high \nrates of seclusion and restraints, those rates remain excessive. \nAccording to Metropolitan’s statistics, for the 85 days \nimmediately preceding our tour, there were 359 episodes of \nseclusion, restraints, or seclusion and restraints.  Metropolitan \nstatistics indicate that the average Program 1 census during our \ntour was 96.  Together, these figures yield 43.99 episodes per \n1,000 patient days, which is almost double the national aggregate \ndata for adolescent psychiatric inpatient programs of 24.49 \nepisodes per 1,000 patient days.  See Association of Maryland \nHospitals & Health Systems’ Quality Indicators Project (2000) at \nhttp://www.qiproject.org/publicdata/psych/ (national comparative \nstudy). \nFurther, it appears that Metropolitan’s statistics under­\nreport the actual amount of seclusion and restraints that is \nbeing used.  A random check of “Seclusion/Restraint” forms (form \nMSH 1172) uncovered numerous instances of seclusion and \nrestraints not included in the summary seclusion and restraints \ndata that Metropolitan provided to us.  Examples of seclusion and \nrestraints not captured in this summary data include: \n(a)  K.C. seclusion/restraints on 4/25/02, 18:05-\n19:30; \n(b)  K.S. seclusion/restraints on 4/28/02, 19:00-\n20:30; \n(c)  L.M. seclusion/restraints on 4/7/02, 14:20-\n16:10; \n(d)  P.B. seclusion/restraints on 4/13/02, 12:35-\n13:30; \n(e)  F.S. seclusion/restraints on 4/1/02, 15:15-\n17:15; \n\n-29-\n\n(f)  S.N. seclusion/restraints on 4/24/02, 15:15-\n17:15; and \n(g)  E.G. seclusion/restraints on 5/7/02, 9:05-\n11:00. \nThe excessive use of PRN medications is also of great \nconcern.  For the 85 days immediately preceding our tour, PRN \nmedications were administered 392 times.  Based on a census of \n96, this yields a rate of 48.04 episodes of PRN use per 1,000 \npatient days, which is an excessive rate. \nThere are numerous specific examples of excessive use of PRN \npsychotropic medications.  U.C. received 20 PRN doses of Haldol \nbetween April 3 and June 16, 2002.  Strikingly, 11 of these PRNs \nwere administered by injection at U.C.’s request because “it was \nfaster.”  Ub.N. received 22 psychotropic medication PRNs from \nApril 6 to June 23, 2002, ten by injection.  More than half of \nthe PRNs were Haldol and Thorazine.  Over approximately the same \ntwo month period, at least nine other individuals received \nbetween seven and 15 antipsychotic PRNs each.  Many of these PRNs \nwere for Haldol or Thorazine and/or were administered by \ninjection. \nThe documentation indicates that patients frequently request \nand receive PRN medications when they are feeling “anxious.”  The \nfacility appears to permit the use of PRN medications as a \nsubstitute for sound therapeutic intervention, thereby \ncontributing to patients’ medication dependency and dysfunction. \nIn our review of charts of patients requesting PRNs, there was \nlittle indication that patients were provided proactive, \nsupportive interventions before or after the administration of \nthese medications.  It does not appear that staff use such \nopportunities to teach children and adolescents the coping skills \nnecessary to live independently in the community.  Moreover, as \ndiscussed in Section I above, the use of the older antipsychotic \nmedications raises a host of other serious risks to these \npatients’ health. \nIV.  PHARMACY \nIt is standard practice for pharmacists to review individual \npatient’s medication regimens.  Such a review should encompass \nall of the medications prescribed (not just psychiatric drugs and \nPRN medications) and should include documentation of any \ncommunication between the pharmacists and physicians regarding \n\n-30­\n\nconcerns, potential medication interactions, and the need for \nlaboratory testing.  Pharmacists, by the nature of their \neducation and licensure, are the facility’s experts regarding \nmedications and medication interactions and share responsibility \nwith physicians regarding medication decisions.  We found no \nevidence that Metropolitan pharmacists perform these crucial \nroles.  This is particularly troubling given the outdated and \nunjustified combinations of medications that are prescribed for \nthese children and adolescents.  By not providing adequate \npharmacy services, Metropolitan places Program 1 patients at risk \nfor the misuse of medication, unnecessary side effects from \nmedication, potential drug interactions, general health problems, \nand excessively long hospitalizations. \nV.  GENERAL MEDICAL CARE \nThere are numerous instances in which Metropolitan fails to \nprovide necessary medical care to the children and adolescents in \nProgram 1.  A number of children, including U.C., E.Z., S.K., \nC.H., Ui.N. and T.T., waited one to two months for an evaluation \nafter complaining of vision problems and an additional one to \nthree months to receive their glasses.  U.C. experienced \nnighttime incontinence and received 15 doses of Motrin over two \nmonths for headaches.  Neither problem was evaluated.  The \nresults of an x-ray for E.Z. were not noted by his physician for \nover one month.  Similarly, C.H.’s physician did not initial his \nx-ray for more than two months. \nVI.  INFECTION CONTROL \nIn an institutional setting such as Metropolitan, it is \nstandard practice for infections and communicable diseases to be \ntracked and trended.  When analysis of trends reveals potential \nproblems, it is standard practice for corrective action plans to \nbe developed and implemented.  Metropolitan has two infection \ncontrol nurses on staff, but they only monitor individual patient \ninfections.  Metropolitan completes no systemic tracking or \ntrending of infections or communicable diseases in Program 1 or \nthroughout the hospital.  As a result, Metropolitan’s patients \nare at increased risk for infections and/or communicable \ndiseases.  Because no tracking or trending information was \navailable for our review, it was impossible to determine if such \ninfections had occurred or diseases had been allowed to spread \nwithout the benefit of corrective action plans. \n\n-31­\n\nVII. DENTAL SERVICES \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care require \nthat dental care and treatment be provided in a timely manner. \nProgram 1 patients, however, experience delays of several months \nin receiving needed dental care and treatment or do not receive \ntreatment at all.  This problem was noted in the April and May \n2002 minutes of Metropolitan’s CNS/NC Committee, which stated \nthat individuals were not seen by a dentist in a timely manner \nand the “backlog” of dental patients required attention.  At the \ntime of our tour, the dentist assigned to Program 1 was on \nextended leave and the dentist for Metropolitan’s adult \npopulation, an additional 800 or so individuals, was covering the \nProgram 1 caseload.  This coverage is insufficient to ensure \ntimely and appropriate dental care.  Even when Program 1 patients \ndo receive dental services, documentation of these services is \ngrossly incomplete, often failing to indicate the individual’s \ncurrent dental status and leaving numerous sections of the \nevaluation blank. \nVIII.  DIETARY \nProgram 1's dietary services substantially depart from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care and expose the \nchildren and adolescents there to significant risk of harm.  The \nfacility’s dietician estimated that eighty percent of Program 1's \npatients are obese, an estimate consistent with our own \nobservations and review of patient records.  Many of the \nmedications these children and adolescents receive exacerbate \nweight problems.  These patients’ obesity, which is very severe \nin several cases, places them at increased risk for physical \nhealth problems, such as high blood pressure, and other \ndeleterious effects, such as decreased self-esteem, that worsen \nexisting mental health problems.  Notwithstanding these \nsignificant consequences, virtually every one of the several \nnutritional evaluations that we reviewed indicated that the \nfacility was not pursuing dietary interventions because the \npatient “refused [a] weight reduction program” that consisted \nalmost entirely of receiving a smaller portion of the same meals \nserved to other patients.  We found no evidence that the facility \nwas actively promoting viable alternative interventions to \naddress patients’ severe weight problems.  Our record review of \nProgram 1’s exercise group, for instance, indicated that the \ngroup rarely met.  Whether or not these children and adolescents \narrived at Metropolitan greatly overweight, the facility is not \n\n-32­\n\nimplementing meaningful interventions to address their serious \nweight problems or related self-esteem issues. \nIX.  PLACEMENT IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care and \nfederal law require that treatment teams, with the leadership of \npsychiatrists and the support of the hospital administration, \nactively pursue the timely discharge to the most integrated, \nappropriate setting that is consistent with patients’ needs.  In \nthis regard, factors that contributed to previous unsuccessful \nplacements should be identified and addressed.  Program 1's \ndischarge planning process fails to meet these standards of care. \nConsequently, the process results in unnecessarily extended \nhospitalizations, poor transitions, and a high likelihood of \nreadmission, all of which result in harm to Program 1's children \nand adolescents. \nThe excessive length of numerous patients’ hospitalizations \nis alarming.  As of the week of our visit, the average length of \nstay was reported to be 350 days, with 30 percent of the current \npatients having been at Program 1 more than one year and 14 \npercent more than two years.  Staff appear to take little \nresponsibility for the discharge process, stating that \nexcessively long stays are unavoidable.  Despite the fact that \nsome children and adolescents remain at Program 1 for years, \nProgram 1 has not developed any mechanism to identify and review \nthose patients having extremely lengthy hospitalizations.  Given \nthat there is no mechanism to identify patients who are stalled \nin their discharge implementation, senior administration seems to \nhave no understanding that children and adolescents remaining \ninstitutionalized for years constitute a systemic crisis, nor do \nthey demonstrate any influence over this process. \nMetropolitan’s discharge criteria and the portions of \ntreatment plans addressing discharge are also inappropriate and \ncontribute to patients’ lengthy hospitalizations.  Plans fail to \nidentify clearly the barriers to discharge to the most integrated \nsetting, and the actions that staff and/or the patient needs to \ntake to overcome these barriers.  Plans also do not contain \nmeasurable action steps, persons responsible for discharge steps, \nand time frames for the completion of those steps. \nFurther, discharge criteria in the majority of cases are \nidentical.  Most patients are required to maintain nearly 100 \n\n-33­\n\npercent compliance with most aspects of Program 1 rules and to \nmaintain discharge criteria for 90 days prior to the facility \nseeking a placement.  Thus, even after the point at which an \nindividual achieves discharge criteria, he or she is typically \nnot discharged for many months.  For instance, Ui.N.’s April 2002 \ntreatment plan stated that he had met discharge criteria, but his \nestimated discharge date read “three to six months.”  The fact \nthat discharge plans routinely have broad estimated time frames \nfor discharge rather than a specific date as the estimated date \nof discharge favors such easily extendable discharge dates. \nAs a general matter, Metropolitan’s approach to the \ndischarge process is passive, as illustrated by the case of N.Q. \nThis patient had met all of the facility’s discharge criteria. \nNevertheless, he remained there because his receiving program \nwould not accept him without an updated audiological evaluation, \nand Metropolitan had not scheduled one.  Moreover, discharge \nsummaries for a number of patients included no appointments for \nfollow-up care.  Failure to ensure follow-up care places these \nchildren and adolescents at marked risk of re-hospitalization. \nMetropolitan’s shortcomings regarding N.E. illustrate many \nof these problems.  Despite the fact that she met discharge \ncriteria for 90 days, that her family was willing to care for \nher, and that a court, at N.E.’s insistence, ordered her \ndischarged, the treatment team was so entrenched in their view of \ndischarge planning that they discharged her “against medical \norders” to her family, because they wanted her sent, instead, to \na group home.  The discharge form indicated that N.E. was \nfrustrated over the period of time she had waited to be \ndischarged, stating “you guys won’t do anything so I have to.” \nIndeed, many aspects of Metropolitan’s approach to discharge \nplanning reflect an attitude that the children, and not the \nfacility, bear responsibility for improving their health. \nIn part, the problems with the discharge process are due to \nthe diffusion of authority and responsibility for the provision \nof discharge services between the facility and California \ncounties; the facility typically determines when a patient is \nready for discharge and recommends a setting for placement, but \nthe resident’s county of origin determines the actual placement \nsetting.  Also, social workers, who are required to organize the \ndischarge process with little administrative support from \nMetropolitan, have a limited ability to influence many of the \ndecisions regarding placement.  Discharge planning, however, \n\n-34­\n\ncannot be disconnected from treatment and based solely upon \nfunding and resource availability.  One social worker expressly \nstated to us that these factors posed obstacles to discharge. \nMetropolitan must take necessary actions in the discharge process \nto treat its patients adequately and appropriately and to comply \nwith federal law. \nX.  SPECIAL EDUCATION \nMetropolitan’s provision of special education substantially \ndeparts from generally accepted professional standards of care \nand from federal law in that it fails to provide children and \nadolescents adequate habilitation to prevent regression and to \nfacilitate their ability to exercise their liberty interests. \nSee Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  California is also \nfailing to meet its more specific obligation to provide \nindividualized educational programs that are reasonably \ncalculated to enable the children and adolescents of Metropolitan \nto receive educational benefits.  See Bd. of Educ. of the \nHendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206-07 \n(1982). \nFederal law conditions federal financing of State special \neducation programs upon the State’s provision of a free and \nappropriate public education (“FAPE”).  Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq. \n(2002).  In this regard, the IDEA requires educational agencies \nto develop an individualized education program (“IEP”) for each \nchild having a disability.  The required elements of the IEP \ninclude, but are not limited to:  (a) present levels of \neducational performance; (b) annual goals and short-term \nobjectives; (c) specific educational services that are to be \nprovided; and (d) statements of how progress toward annual goals \nare to be measured.  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d) (2002).  The IDEA \nfurther requires such “related services” as are necessary to \npermit the child to benefit from instruction, including \npsychological services.  Id. at §§ 1401(22), 1414(d)(2002). \nThus, the IDEA requires “access to specialized instruction and \nrelated services which are individually designed to provide \neducational benefit to the handicapped child.”  Rowley, 458 U.S. \nat 201.\n Metropolitan does not provide “specialized instruction and \nrelated services which are individually designed,” id., nor has \nit developed clear statements of how progress toward annual goals \n\n-35­\n\nare to be measured, see 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2002).  Its \ndeficiencies in this regard cause harm to most of its Program 1 \npatients, who are entitled to a free and appropriate education, \nbut do not receive it. \nInadequate direction is a common component of many of the \nproblems in this area.  School administration is not effective in \nsupervising teachers, overseeing instruction, or ensuring that \nprocedures, such as the recording of attendance, are \nappropriately followed.  For example, the principal of the Allen \nYoung School, which is the on-campus school serving Metropolitan \npatients under age 18, appeared largely unaware of what happened \nin his classrooms; he was unable to identify which students were \ndoing well or even recall significant incidents of violence and \nsuspensions that recently had occurred in the school. \nA.  Individual Education Programs \nMetropolitan’s IEPs substantially depart from generally \naccepted professional standards of care and do not comply with \nfederal law.  Based on our review of 15 plans, it is apparent \nthat they are formulaic.  Many plans vary by only a few words \nfrom student to student.  Further, they reflect poor assessments \nof students’ individual levels of educational performance. \nMetropolitan’s assessments of unique educational needs are \nunreliable.  They frequently are based on assessment tools that \nare greatly outdated and that do not evaluate students in their \nnon-English native languages.  Consequently, the IEPs do not \ncorrectly identify students’ current levels of education \nperformance. \nFurther, although the IEPs do contain nominally “specific \neducation services” to be provided to each student, the \nidentified services are, in substance, largely generic among \nstudents.  Specificity regarding the unique educational needs of \nthe individual student is mostly absent.  As a consequence of \nthese deficiencies, the identified annual goals and short-term \nobjectives of students often are not appropriate.  For that \nmatter, the IEPs generally do not contain individualized goals. \nFor many of Program 1's students, behavioral supports are \nnecessary “related services” that are not currently being \nprovided.  Without such services, students are unable to benefit \nfrom instruction.  Given the population enrolled in the Allen \nYoung School, it is troubling that only one of the IEPs reviewed \n\n-36­\n\nindicated a need for functional behavioral assessment.  Even when \nassessments and behavioral plans are included in the IEPs, they \nare inadequate for many of the reasons discussed at Section III, \nabove, including their lack of individualization, specificity or \nobjective data.  It is also of great concern that there appears \nto be no coordination between the behavior support plans at the \nschool and those on the residential units.  The children and \nadolescents are likely to be confused by disparate plans, thereby \nnegating their intended therapeutic effect. \nFinally, although the IEPs should include appropriate, \nobjective criteria for determining whether instructional \nobjectives are being achieved, they do not.  In this regard, two \nteachers acknowledged to us that they have no formal system for \nassessing progress, and most teachers indicated that they use \ninformal, subjective estimates of students’ progress.  Thus, \nMetropolitan’s IEPs neither comply with the IDEA nor have \nsignificant utility in identifying and providing for individuals’ \neducation needs. \nB.  Instruction \nOne of the most critical elements of the IEP is that it be \nreasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational \nbenefits.  See Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206-07.  It is axiomatic that, \nfor students to receive educational benefits, they must receive \nadequate instruction.  Generally accepted professional standards \nregarding special education instruction call for teacher-directed \nlessons, provided in small, homogeneous groups, composed of \nfrequent teacher questions and student answers, progressing in \nsmall increments, with abundant teacher feedback.  Although we \nsaw some elements of such instruction in three classes, no such \ninstruction was evident in another five classes that we attended. \nGenerally speaking, Metropolitan’s classroom instruction is not \neffective in conveying the educational benefits to which its \nspecial education students are entitled. \nC.  Literacy \nMetropolitan’s records clearly show that some special \neducation students lack basic reading and writing skills.  These \nskills are the most fundamental educational benefit to which \nspecial education students are entitled.  Although some IEPs \ncontained literacy objectives, we found no evidence that \nliteracy instruction was, in fact, provided.  We saw no literacy \n\n-37­\n\ninstruction during our tour, nor records of planning for \nfundamental literacy instruction.  Teachers we interviewed \nindicated that they had adult readers assist students having \nreading difficulties, but they did not provide remedial reading \ninstruction.  One school staff person stated that the speech \ntherapist provided remedial reading instruction, but the speech \ntherapist told us that she was not teaching reading. \nConsequently, it appears that Metropolitan is not providing the \nmost basic academic skills to the special education students who \nlack them.  This is a substantial departure from generally \naccepted professional standards of care that is harmful to these \nstudents in that it deprives them of educational tools that are \nessential to function adequately in society. \nD.  Least Restrictive Environment \nThe IDEA requires that, \n[t]o the maximum extent possible, children with \ndisabilities, including children in public or \nprivate institutions or other care facilities, are \neducated with children who are not disabled, and \nspecial classes, separate schooling, or other \nremoval of children with disabilities from the \nregular educational environment occurs only when the \nnature or severity of the disability of a child is \nsuch that education in regular classes with the use \nof supplementary aids and services cannot be \nachieved satisfactorily. \n20 U.S.C. § 1412 (5)(A).  See also Rowley, 458 U.S. at 202 (“The \nAct requires participating States to educate handicapped children \nwith nonhandicapped children whenever possible.”)  None of \nMetropolitan’s children and adolescents participates in any off-\ngrounds schooling, with non-institutionalized children. \nMetropolitan does not meaningfully assess each child and \nadolescent to determine whether he or she, when provided adequate \nsupervision and supports, is capable of participating in at least \nsome regular school activities with non-disabled peers.  Although \nmany patients’ disorders may preclude any participation in a \nregular educational environment, other patients, especially those \napproaching discharge, may be capable of at least some integrated \neducation, with appropriate supports.  Metropolitan’s failure to \nassess continuously each of its child and adolescent patients to \ndetermine whether he or she requires separate schooling, and its \n\n-38­\n\nfailure to provide access to a regular school environment for \nthose patients who could participate, with reasonable supports, \nis in violation of the IDEA. \nXI.  PROTECTION FROM HARM \nDuring the Metropolitan II exit interview, we outlined \nfacility-wide issues relating to protection from harm and quality \nassurance, and we will address these facility-wide issues in \nconnection with our findings regarding Metropolitan’s adult \nunits.  Regarding Program 1, in particular, the foregoing \ndiscussion makes evident that Metropolitan fails to protect the \nchildren and adolescents it serves from harm. \nFurther, as we pointed out in the presence of facility \nadministrators who toured Program 1 units with us, the vents and \nwindow grills on several units contained holes large enough for \npatients to thread a sheet or other cloth through them, placing \nthem at risk for suicide by hanging.  In this regard, a number of \nthe units had metal window frames with space between the frame \nand the ceiling which could be potential suicide hazards. \nLikewise, some of the vents in Program 1 were not covered.  This \npresented a hazard in that patients could access wires and other \npotentially dangerous items.  Several of the units contained \nother hazards, such as wires holding down seclusion beds that, if \naccessed by patients, could be used to hurt oneself or others. \nIn addition, one of Unit 101's seclusion rooms did not have \nmirrors properly positioned, creating a blind spot and preventing \nstaff from monitoring patients who have been placed in the room. \nFurther, some of the seclusion room restraints were worn, placing \npatients who are restrained at risk of abrasions and skin \nbreakdown. \nIn at least one instance, Metropolitan did not take steps to \nameliorate known risks.  On January 23, 2002, patient I.X. \nattempted to commit suicide by tying a shoelace through openings \non the under side of her bed and strangling herself.  Less than 4 \nmonths later, on May 17, 2002, she again attempted suicide using \nthe same methodology. \nFurther, frequent instances of same-sex sexual contact among \npatients were labeled by Metropolitan as “consensual” when it \nappeared that the facility was making insufficient effort to \nensure that patients were not being coerced into sexual activity. \n\n-39­\n\nA staff member on Unit 107 estimated that there had been 10 such \ninstances on the unit over the preceding year, but our search for \ndocumentation of these instances uncovered a record of only one. \nSeparately, as to a patient who had made a documented claim that \nhe had been raped, we found no evidence in the chart that a \nphysician had examined him physically, and no responsive \ninterventions were undertaken, according to the chart, apart from \nmoving the involved boys to separate bedrooms. \nThese examples and much of the foregoing discussion raise \nconcerns regarding Metropolitan’s ability to protect patients \nfrom harm and its incident management system, including the \ntracking and trending of unusual incidents, the quality of the \ninvestigations being completed, and the identification and \nimplementation of corrective actions.  As indicated above, we \nwill elaborate on those concerns in our findings addressing \nMetropolitan’s adult units. \nXII. FIRST AMENDMENT AND DUE PROCESS \nPrior to our tours of Metropolitan, the State indicated that \nit would refuse to allow Program 1 patients to speak with the \nDepartment of Justice or its expert consultants unless persons \nacting at the direction of the State were present.  During our \ntours of Metropolitan, the State maintained this position, and \nState representatives participated in all of our discussions with \npatients.  The State’s effort to circumscribe our access to \nMetropolitan patients and to information regarding their care and \nwell being is troubling. \nAs the State is aware, the United States District Court for \nthe Central District of California has ruled that CRIPA preempts \na jurisdiction’s invocation of procedural hurdles to “restrict or \ndeny the DOJ access to [a juvenile facility], the juveniles held \ntherein and their records.”  United States  v. County of Los\nAngeles, 635 F. Supp. 588, 594 (C.D. Cal. 1986).  More \nfundamentally, by denying its patients the right to speak \nconfidentially to attorneys from, or expert consultants acting \nfor, the Department of Justice, the State impermissibly has \nconstrained its patients’ constitutional rights to:  (a) free \nspeech, including the right to petition the government for \nredress of grievances; and (b) due process.  See United States \nConstitution Amendments I, XIV; Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, \n485 (1969)(stating that even state prisoners retain the freedom \nto petition for redress of grievances); Gary W. v. Louisiana, 437 \n\n-40­\n\nF. Supp. 1209, 1224 (E.D. La. 1976), aff’d, 622 F.2d 804 (5th \nCir. 1980)(stating that children institutionalized for treatment \nenjoy the First Amendment right to free communication, and the \nState may monitor such children’s communications only under \n“carefully circumscribed conditions,” when “necessary to prevent \nserious harm to the child”); In re Quarles 158 U.S. 532, 535-36 \n(1895)(discussing the rights of citizens to communicate with \nfederal law enforcement officials regarding violations of federal \nlaw).  By imposing itself on communications between the federal \ngovernment and its citizens, California wrongfully abridges these \nrights. \nFurther, California’s position violates the protections that \nit itself affords to persons institutionalized in its mental \nhealth hospitals, in its Code of Mental Health Patients’ Rights. \nSee Cal. Welf. & Instit. Code § 5325 (2002).  Under California \nlaw, all State mental health patients are entitled to certain \nrights, that must be posted in English and Spanish throughout the \ninstitution, and that include the right to engage in \ncommunications that are confidential.  Id.  The right to \nconfidential communication provided by California law –­\nespecially communication with one’s government regarding matters \nof important public interest, such as conditions of care at a \nstate institution -- is one of real substance, the State’s \nencumbrance of which implicates the due process clause of the \nUnited States Constitution.  In placing its own interests in \nlimiting its exposure to a federal investigation of a State \nfacility over the constitutional interests of the patients \nresiding in that facility, the State has further harmed those \npatients. \nXIII.  MINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES \nTo remedy the deficiencies discussed above and to protect \nthe constitutional and federal statutory rights of the children \nand adolescents in Program 1 of Metropolitan, California promptly \nshould implement the minimum remedial measures set forth below. \nA.  Psychiatric Services \nMetropolitan should provide psychiatric supports and \nservices to provide adequate treatment for chronically and \nseverely mentally ill and traumatized children and adolescents. \nMore particularly, Metropolitan should: \n\n-41­\n\n1.\t Ensure that each individual’s psychiatric \nevaluation, diagnoses, and medications are \njustified in a generally accepted professional \nmanner. \n2.\t Ensure that all physicians and clinicians can \ndemonstrate competence in appropriate psychiatric \nevaluation and diagnosis. \n3.\t Develop standard psychiatric evaluation protocols \nfor reliably reaching psychiatric diagnoses. \n4.\t Review and revise, as appropriate, psychiatric \nevaluations of all individuals currently residing \nin Program 1, providing clinically justifiable \ncurrent diagnoses for each individual, and \nremoving all diagnoses that cannot be clinically \njustified.  Modify treatment and medication \nregimen, as appropriate. \n5.\t Develop and implement policies and procedures \nregarding the development of treatment plans \nconsistent with generally accepted professional \nstandards of care. \n6.\t Review and revise, as appropriate, each \nindividual’s treatment plan so that it is current, \nindividualized, and consistent with generally \naccepted professional standards of care. \n7.\t Develop appropriate protocols that require the \ncompletion of cognitive and academic assessments \nof all Program 1 patients within 30 days of \nadmission, unless valid testing has been completed \nwithin one year of admission. \n8.\t Develop and implement a plan of remediation in \nboth treatment and educational plans for any \nidentified cognitive and academic deficits of \ncurrent Program 1 children and adolescents. \n9.\t Develop policies and protocols to ensure patients \nhave genuine input into their treatment plans, \nincluding education regarding the purposes and \nside effects of medication. \n\n-42­\n\n10.\t Increase the frequency of treatment team meetings \nand discharge plan reviews from every 90 days to a \nminimum of every 30 days, and more frequently, as \nappropriate. \n11.\t Ensure that all psychotropic medications are \nappropriate for Program 1's population, are \nspecifically matched to current, clinically \njustified diagnoses, are prescribed in therapeutic \namounts, are monitored for efficacy against \nclearly-identified target variables and time \nframes, are modified based on clinical rationales, \nand are properly documented. \n12.\t Develop and implement protocols and procedures \nconsistent with generally accepted professional \nstandards of care regarding the use of \npsychotropic medications to treat symptoms other \nthan psychosis, including that this practice be \nclearly documented with a specific plan for \nminimizing the dosage and the duration of the \nmedication. \n13.\t Develop and implement protocols and procedures \nconsistent with generally accepted professional \nstandards of care regarding off-label medication \nusage, including the establishment of an \ninstitutional review board to supervise this \npractice, the development of research protocols, \nand policies to obtain appropriate informed \nconsent from minors and/or guardians. \n14.\t Develop and implement protocols and procedures to \nensure that each patient’s treatment plan includes \na plan to monitor, document, report and properly \naddress potential side effects of prescribed \nmedications. \n15.\t Develop and implement formal tools to be used \nprogram-wide for each person at risk of \nexperiencing medication side effects in accordance \nwith generally accepted professional standards. \n\n-43­\n\n16.\t Make appropriate attempts to use newer \npsychotropic medications with fewer, less serious \nside effects, rather than older psychotropic \nmedications. \n17.\t Use a milieu structure for Program 1 that is \nconsistent with generally accepted professional \nstandards of care.  Ensure that it is applied to \npatients in a consistent, comprehensible and \ntherapeutic manner, and ensure that staff \nimplementing milieu programs first have \nsuccessfully completed competency-based training \nin implementing such programs. \n18.\t Remedy those aspects of Program 1's physical \nenvironment that inhibit appropriate psychiatric \ntreatment, including, but not limited to, the \nviolation of individual’s privacy, the lack of \nindividualization, and the lack of appropriate \nrecreational facilities. \nB.\t Nursing \nMetropolitan should provide nursing services to the children \nand adolescents it serves that are consistent with generally \naccepted professional standards of care.  Such services should \nresult in Program 1's patients receiving individualized services, \nsupports and therapeutic interventions.  At a minimum, \nMetropolitan should: \n1.\t Develop and implement a treatment planning policy \nthat ensures that each patient’s treatment plan \nidentifies the Axis I diagnoses and the related \nsymptoms to be monitored by nursing and other unit \nstaff and the frequency by which staff need to \nmonitor such symptoms.  This policy should include \nrequirements for staff to monitor, document and \nreport such symptoms and for treatment teams to \nanalyze the information collected and to modify, \nas appropriate, treatment plans based upon this \ndata. \n2.\t Develop and implement a policy consistent with \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care \n\n-44­\n\nregarding psychotropic medication side effects \nmonitoring. \n3.\t Ensure that, before they work directly with \npatients, all nursing and other unit staff have \nsuccessfully completed competency-based training \nin mental health diagnoses, related symptoms, \npsychotropic medications, and the identification \nof side effects of psychotropic medications. \n4.\t Ensure that, before they work directly with \npatients, all nursing and other unit staff have \nsuccessfully completed competency-based training \nin the provision of a therapeutic milieu on the \nunits. \n5.\t Ensure that, before they work directly with \npatients, all nursing and other unit staff have \nsuccessfully completed competency-based training \nin proactive, positive interventions to prevent \nand de-escalate crises. \nC.\t Psychology \nMetropolitan should provide psychological supports and \nservices adequate to treat the emotional and behavioral disorders \nexperienced by Program 1 children and adolescents according to \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care.  More \nparticularly, Metropolitan should: \n1.\t Where clinical information is insufficient, \nincrease the use of direct clinical assessment of \npatients to provide a comprehensive clinical \npicture, and when additional clinical questions \nare raised, including so-called “Rule Out” and \ndeferred diagnoses, implement appropriate clinical \nassessments to answer the questions promptly. \n2.\t Ensure that clinically relevant information \nremains readily accessible in the active chart. \n3.\t For patients whose primary language is not \nEnglish, provide comprehensive psychological \nassessments in the patients’ primary language. \n\n-45­\n\n4.\t Ensure that psychologists communicate and \ninterpret psychological assessment results to the \ntreatment team, along with the implications of \nthose results for diagnosis and treatment. \n5.\t Develop and implement policies and procedures, in \naccordance with generally accepted professional \nstandards of care, regarding the necessary and \nsufficient components of a comprehensive \npsychological evaluation. \n6.\t Ensure that patients in need of individual, group \nand/or family therapy services receive such \nservices in accordance with generally accepted \nprofessional standards, and that these services \nare provided in a patient’s primary language. \n7.\t Document the provision of individual and group \ntherapy services each time they occur, including \nclear descriptions of the problem being addressed, \nthe focus of the session, the intervention \nprovided by the therapist, and the patient’s \nresponse to the intervention. \n8.\t Provide adequate clinical oversight to therapy \ngroups to ensure that patients are assigned to \ngroups that are appropriate to their individual \nneeds, that groups are provided frequently and \nconsistently, and that issues particularly \nrelevant for this population, including the use of \npsychotropic medications and substance abuse, are \naddressed in group therapy. \n9.\t Ensure that all group leaders are competent \nregarding selection and implementation of \nappropriate approaches and interventions to \naddress group therapy objectives, are competent in \nmonitoring patient responses to group therapy, and \nare supervised by clinical staff. \n10.\t Ensure the consistent implementation of \nreinforcement and behavior programs. \n\n-46­\n\n11.\t Ensure that patients are not denied, because of \nexcess sedation, the full benefit of behavioral \ntreatment and educational interventions. \n12.\t Ensure that all psychologists can demonstrate \ncompetence in the development and implementation \nof milieu behavioral programs that are consistent \nwith generally accepted professional standards of \ncare, including the monitoring of patient progress \nin such programs and program revision as \nmonitoring warrants. \n13.\t Ensure that all responsible program staff \ndemonstrate competence in implementing individual \nbehavioral programs. \n14.\t Ensure that, before they work with patients, all \npsychologists have successfully completed \ncompetency-based training, in accordance with \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care, \nin conducting a functional analysis of behavior, \npreparing individualized behavior interventions \nand positive behavior support plans, designing \nmethods of monitoring the program intervention and \nthe effectiveness of the intervention, providing \nstaff training regarding program implementation, \nand, as appropriate, revising or terminating the \nprogram. \n15.\t Specify and utilize, in accordance with generally \naccepted professional standards of care, triggers \nfor instituting individualized behavior treatment \nplans. \n16.\t Continue to reduce the use of seclusion, \nrestraints and psychotropic PRN medications. \n17.\t Ensure the accuracy of seclusion, restraints, and \npsychotropic PRN medications data. \n18.\t Revise and implement policies and procedures to \nprohibit the use of seclusion, restraints and/or \npsychotropic PRN medications as an alternative to \nadequate treatment and/or as punishment.  Include \nrequirements for staff to utilize and document the \n\n-47­\n\nuse of proactive, positive, and less restrictive \nmethods before using seclusion, restraints and/or \npsychotropic PRN medication.  Ensure that staff \ndemonstrate competence in the implementation of \nsuch policies. \n19.\t Revise and implement policies and procedures to \nrequire the review and modification, if necessary, \nof patients’ treatment plans after any use of \nseclusion, restraints and/or psychotropic PRN \nmedication. \n20.\t Develop and implement a policy consistent with \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care \ngoverning the use of psychotropic PRN medication \nfor psychiatric purposes in child and adolescent \npatients and ensuring, in particular, that such \nmedications are used on a limited basis and not \nas a substitute for adequate treatment of the \nunderlying cause of the patient’s distress. \nD.\t Pharmacy \nMetropolitan’s Program 1 patients should receive pharmacy \nservices consistent with generally accepted professional \nstandards of care.  Specifically, Metropolitan should: \n1.\t Develop and implement policies and procedures that \nrequire pharmacists to complete monthly reviews of \npatients’ medication regimens, and, as \nappropriate, to make recommendations to the \ntreatment team, including the prescribing \nphysician, about possible medication changes. \nSuch a review process should include medical and \npsychotropic drugs. \n2.\t Develop and implement policies and procedures that \nrequire pharmacists to track the use of \npsychotropic PRN medications, and, whenever \nappropriate, notify the prescribing physician of \nproblematic trends. \n\n-48­\n\nE.\t General Medical Care \nMetropolitan should provide adequate preventative, routine, \nspecialized and emergency medical services on a timely basis, in \naccordance with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare.  More particularly, Metropolitan should: \n1.\t Develop and implement protocols and procedures to \nensure the timely provision of medical care, \nincluding but not limited to, evaluation of vision \ncare, dental care, and x-ray services. \n2.\t Render appropriate medical treatment on a timely \nbasis. \n3.\t Monitor patients’ health status indicators in \naccordance with generally accepted professional \nstandards of care, and, whenever appropriate, \nmodify their treatment plans to address any \nproblematic changes in health status indicators. \nF.\t Infection Control \nMetropolitan should implement adequate infection control \nprocedures to prevent the spread of infections and/or \ncommunicable diseases.  More specifically, Metropolitan should: \n1.\t Revise infection control policies and procedures \nto include the tracking and trending of infections \nand communicable diseases as well as the \ndevelopment and implementation of corrective \naction plans. \n2.\t Establish an effective infection control program \nthat:  (a) actively collects data with regard to \ninfections and communicable diseases; (b) assesses \nthese data for trends; (c) initiates inquiries \nregarding problematic trends; (d) identifies \nnecessary corrective action; (e) monitors to \nensure that appropriate remedies are achieved; and \n(f) integrates this information into\nMetropolitan’s quality assurance review. \nG.\t Dental Services \n\n-49­\n\nPatients should be provided with routine and emergency \ndental care and treatment on a timely basis and in a manner \nconsistent with generally accepted professional standards of \ncare.  More specifically, Metropolitan should: \n1.\t Retain an adequate number of adequately qualified \ndentists to provide timely and appropriate dental \ncare and treatment to Metropolitan patients. \n2.\t Develop protocols and procedures that require the \ncomprehensive and timely provision of dental \nservices and the documentation of such services. \nH.\t Dietary \nMetropolitan Program 1 patients should receive adequate \ndietary services, particularly patients who experience weight-\nrelated problems.  Specifically, Metropolitan should: \n1.\t Modify treatment planning policies and procedures \nto require that the treatment plans of children \nand adolescents who experience weight problems \nand/or related health concerns include adequate \nstrategies and methodologies to address the \nidentified problems and that such strategies and \nmethodologies are implemented in a timely manner. \n2.\t Ensure that treatment team members demonstrate \ncompetence in the dietary and nutritional issues \naffecting children and adolescents and the \ndevelopment and implementation of strategies and \nmethodologies to address such issues. \n3.\t Increase the availability of individualized and \ngroup exercise and recreational options for the \nchildren and adolescents in Program 1. \nI.\t Placement in the Most Integrated Setting \nMetropolitan should pursue actively the appropriate \ndischarge of patients and ensure that they are in the most \nintegrated, appropriate setting that is consistent with patients’ \nneeds.  More particularly, Metropolitan should: \n\n-50­\n\n1.\t Ensure that discharge planning begins at the time \nof admission and that all patients have realistic \nand individualized discharge criteria.  Ensure \nthat each patient has a professionally developed \ndischarge plan, including measurable action steps, \npersons responsible and time frames for \ncompletion. \n2.\t Ensure that patients who have met discharge \ncriteria are discharged expeditiously and with \nappropriate supports. \n3.\t Develop and implement a policy and protocol that \nidentifies patients with lengths of stay exceeding \nsix months.  Establish a regular review forum, \nincluding senior administration, to review these \npatients, their treatment plans, and obstacles to \nsuccessful discharge to the most integrated, \nappropriate setting.  Create an individual action \nplan for each individual being reviewed. \n4.\t Consolidate responsibility for discharge planning \nwith the authority to provide the supports and \nservices that discharge planning indicates are \nnecessary. \n5.\t Ensure that all Program 1 staff, including senior \nadministration, provide care and treatment to \nmitigate the dangers of long-term \ninstitutionalization for the children and \nadolescents in their care. \n6.\t Provide transition and follow-up supports and \nservices consistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care. \nJ.\t Special Education \nMetropolitan should ensure that all of its child and \nadolescent patients who qualify for special education receive \nindividualized educational programs that are reasonably \ncalculated to enable these patients to receive educational \nbenefits.  More particularly, Metropolitan should: \n\n-51­\n\n1.\t Ensure that all Individualized Education Programs \nare developed and implemented consistent with the \nrequirements of the Individuals with Disabilities \nAct, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq. (2002)(“IDEA”). \n2.\t Ensure that special education students receive \ninstruction appropriate to their needs and \nlearning abilities, consistent with generally \naccepted professional standards of care. \n3.\t Provide appropriate literacy instruction for \nstudents with significant deficits in reading \nand/or writing. \n4.\t Provide appropriate supplemental education for \nstudents whose individualized education programs \nat the facility have not been reasonably \ncalculated to enable them to receive educational \nbenefits. \n5.\t Continuously assess each student’s capacity to \nparticipate, with appropriate supports and \nservices, in a regular, non-institutional, \neducation environment, and provide access to a \nregular education environment for those students \nwho can participate in one with appropriate \nsupports and services. \n6.\t Ensure that all students receive their education \nin the least restrictive setting pursuant to the \nrequirements of the IDEA. \nK.\t Protection from Harm \nMetropolitan should provide its patients with a safe and \nhumane environment and protect them from harm.  At a minimum, \nMetropolitan should: \n1.\t Conduct a thorough review of the units within \nProgram 1 to identify potential safety hazards, \nand develop and implement a plan to remedy any \nidentified issues. \n2.\t Thoroughly review and, as appropriate, revise \nhospital policy, and Program 1 practice, regarding \n\n-52­\n\nsexual contact between patients.  Establish clear \nguidelines regarding staff responses to reports of \nsexual contact and monitor staff responses to \nincidents.  Comprehensively document therapeutic \ninterventions in patient charts in response to \ninstances of sexual contact. \n3.\t Develop and implement a comprehensive quality \nassurance plan consistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care, including but not \nlimited to an effective incident management \nsystem. \nL.\t First Amendment, Access to Courts and Due Process \nThe State should permit Metropolitan Program 1 patients to \nexercise their constitutional rights of:  (a) free speech, and, \nin particular, the right to petition the government for redress \nof grievances without State monitoring; and (b) due process. \nMore particularly, the State should: \n1.\t Permit patients to speak with representatives of \nthe federal government outside the presence of \npersons acting for the State. \n2.\t Permit patients to engage in confidential \ncommunications. \n***** \nThe collaborative approach that the parties have taken thus \nfar has been productive.  We hope to continue working with the \nState in this fashion to resolve our significant concerns \nregarding the care and services provided at this facility. \nWe will forward our expert consultants’ reports under \nseparate cover.  Although their reports are their work – and do \nnot necessarily represent the official conclusions of the \nDepartment of Justice - their observations, analyses and \nrecommendations provide further elaboration of the relevant \nconcerns, and offer practical assistance in addressing them.  We \nhope that you will give this information careful consideration \n\n-53­\n\nand that it will assist in facilitating a dialogue swiftly \naddressing areas requiring attention. \nIn the unexpected event that the parties are unable to reach \na resolution regarding our concerns, we are obligated to advise \nyou that the Attorney General may initiate a lawsuit pursuant to \nCRIPA, to correct deficiencies or to otherwise protect the rights \nof Metropolitan’s patients, 49 days after the receipt of this \nletter.  42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(1).  Accordingly, we will soon \ncontact State officials to discuss in more detail the measures \nthat the State must take to address the deficiencies identified \nherein. \nSincerely, \nRalph F.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nSpecial Litigation Section - PHB \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, DC  20530 \nMay 2, 2006 \nThe Honorable Arnold Schwarzenegger\nGovernor of California \nState Capitol Building\nSacramento, CA  95814 \nRe: Atascadero State Hospital, Atascadero, California \nDear Governor Schwarzenegger: \nI am writing to report the findings of the Civil Rights\nDivision’s investigation of conditions and practices at\nAtascadero State Hospital (“ASH”), in Atascadero, California.  On \nFebruary 16, 2005, we notified you that we were investigating\nconditions at ASH pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  CRIPA \ngives the Department of Justice authority to seek remedies for\nany pattern and practice of conduct that violates the\nconstitutional or federal rights of persons with mental illness\nwho are served in public institutions. \nDuring the week of November 28, 2005, we conducted an on-\nsite inspection of ASH.  We reviewed a wide variety of relevant\nState and facility documents, including policies, procedures, and\nmedical and other records relating to the care and treatment of\npatients.  During our visit, we also interviewed ASH\nadministrators, professionals, and staff, and talked to and\nobserved patients in their living units, at activity areas, and\nduring treatment meetings.  We were assisted by expert\nconsultants in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, medical\ncare, and quality assurance and risk management.  In keeping with\nour pledge of transparency and to provide technical assistance\nwhere appropriate regarding our investigatory findings, we\nconveyed our preliminary findings to State counsel and to certain\nState and facility administrators and staff during verbal exit\npresentations at the close of our on-site visit. \nAs a threshold matter, we commend the administrators and\nstaff of ASH for their helpful and professional conduct \n\n \n- 2 -\nthroughout the course of the investigation.  In particular,\nfacility personnel cooperated fully and expeditiously with our\ndocument requests.  We hope to continue to work with the State of\nCalifornia and officials at ASH in a cooperative manner. \nAt the time of our November 2005 visit, ASH had a census of\napproximately 1,350 patients.  ASH provides forensic psychiatric\nservices to these patients admitted under a variety of State\nstatutes.  Residents of state-operated facilities have a right to\nlive in reasonable safety and to receive adequate health care,\nalong with habilitation to ensure their safety and freedom from\nunreasonable restraint, prevent regression and facilitate their\nability to exercise their liberty interests.  See generally\nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  Determining whether\ntreatment is adequate focuses on whether institutional conditions\nsubstantially depart from generally accepted professional\njudgment, practices, or standards.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323;\nSharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1171-72 (9th Cir. 2000).  The \nState also must provide services in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to individual residents’ needs.  Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et\nseq.; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130 (d) (“A public entity shall administer\nservices, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with\ndisabilities.”); see generally Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581\n(1999).  Additionally, the State must provide persons committed\nto psychiatric hospitals for an indefinite term with mental\nhealth treatment that gives them a realistic opportunity to be\ncured and released.  Oregon Advocacy Center v. Mink, 322 F.3d\n1101, 1121 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing Sharp, 233 F.3d at 1172). \nIt was apparent that many ASH staff are highly dedicated\nindividuals who are genuinely concerned for the well-being of the\npersons in their care.  Nevertheless, there are significant and\nwide-ranging deficiencies in patient care provided at ASH.\nIndeed, conditions of care and treatment at ASH in psychiatry,\nincluding pharmaceutical services; psychology; medical care,\nincluding general medical services, infection control, physical\nand occupational therapy, dietary and dental care, nursing\nservices, placement in the most integrated setting; and\nprotection from harm and quality assurance, are materially\nsimilar to those outlined in the Metropolitan findings letters of\n2003 and 2004.  Consistent with the statutory requirements of\nCRIPA, we now write to advise you of the findings of our\ninvestigation, the facts supporting them, and the minimum\nremedial steps that are necessary to address the deficiencies we\nhave identified. \n\n \n- 3 -\nI.  PSYCHIATRY \nASH's psychiatric supports and services substantially depart\nfrom generally accepted professional standards of care and expose\npatients to a significant risk of harm and to actual harm.\nGenerally, our investigation uncovered problems in three main\nareas:  assessments, treatment planning, and medication\nmanagement. \nIn many respects, psychiatric assessments are the main\nvehicles establishing the patients’ diagnoses, establishing safe\nand effective treatment, and providing direction for treatment\nplanning.  We found ASH provides timely initial assessments.\nThese initial assessments, however, are cursory and not\nindividualized.  These cursory assessments fail to provide the\nbasis for a valid and reliable diagnosis and for distinguishing\naccurately among disorders with similar presentations.  For \nexample, ASH lists too many patients with an ambiguous “not\notherwise specified” diagnosis, and fails to document further\nfollow up testing. \nOngoing assessments are likewise inadequate.  These \nassessments are crisis driven, rather than treatment driven.  ASH \ngenerally fails to documents risks, benefits, and rationales for\nprescribed medication regimens and universally fails to review\nthe use of medications prescribed on an as needed (“PRN”) basis.\nAssessments generally fail to track risk factors, assess\ncontributing factors, and provide timely supports and\ninterventions to minimize the risk. \nOverall, ASH fails to provide clinically justified\nassessments and diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and fails to\nprovide adequate social history, court, and rehabilitative\nassessments.  As a result, patients’ actual illnesses are not\nbeing properly treated and are permitted to progress, patients\nare exposed to potentially toxic treatments for conditions from\nwhich they do not suffer, patients are not provided appropriate\npsychiatric rehabilitation, and patients’ options for discharge\nare seriously limited. \nBeyond assessments, ASH fails to provide adequate and\nappropriate treatment planning.  Generally accepted professional\nstandards of care instruct that treatment plans should dictate\nappropriate clinical interventions by integrating the individual\nassessments, evaluations, and diagnoses of the patient performed\nby all disciplines involved in the patient’s treatment.\nTreatment plans should be individualized and should identify and\nbuild on the patient’s strengths, interests, preferences, and \n\n \n- 4 -\ngoals, to optimize the patient’s recovery and ability to sustain\nhimself in the most integrated, appropriate setting. \nLike assessments, treatment plans are cursory, generic, and\nnot integrated.  Rather than an integrated interdisciplinary\ninput model, ASH currently employs an ineffective symptom\nreduction model.  Treatment plans are static, and rarely modified\nin response to the progress of the patients.  Treatment plans\nfail to provide meaningful targets for rehabilitation and for\nmeasurable outcomes.  Despite many patients with cognitive\ndisorders, ASH fails to provide cognitive remediation groups.\nASH’s focus on symptom reduction ignores the impairments that\ncontribute to a perpetual cycle of chronic disability and\nrepeated hospitalizations. \nASH is working toward using a collaborative\ninterdisciplinary input model with meaningful outcome-oriented\nobjectives and interventions.  Yet, ASH’s move to the\ninterdisciplinary model has significant problems.\nInterdisciplinary teams lack a psychologist, causing a failure to\nprovide the appropriate behavioral interventions for vast numbers\nof patents.  Because of a lack of competent leadership,\ninterdisciplinary teams spend most of their time assessing rather\nthan planning treatment.  Contrary to generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care, ASH fails to base its treatment\nplanning on a comprehensive case formulation that provides a\nfunctional bridge between assessments and the treatment plan. \nASH’s medication management substantially deviates from\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  ASH fails to \nprescribe clinically justified psychotropic medications, and to\nassess the side effects of medications appropriately.  We found \nthat ASH does not timely modify medications, even when\nmedications appear to cause harm, and alternatives exist.  A \nreview of patients’ treatment plans shows that ASH does not\nintegrate medication management with treatment plans.  ASH \nmedication management also suffers from a fractured review, with\nthe pharmacy and psychiatry staff reviewing medications\nseparately. \nThe harm to these patients caused by these deficiencies in\npsychiatric care takes many forms, among them, inadequate,\nineffective, and counterproductive treatment; exposure to\ninappropriate and unnecessary medications, including PRN\nmedications, posing serious physiological and other side effects;\nexcessively long hospitalizations, which compound psychiatric\ndistress; increased risk of relapse after discharge; and an\noverall lower quality of life. \n\n \n- 5 -\nII.  PSYCHOLOGY \nASH's psychological services and behavioral interventions\nsubstantially depart from generally accepted professional\nstandards of care and expose patients to significant risk of harm\nand to actual harm.  Generally, our investigation uncovered an \noperational failure in symptom/behavioral management, and\npsychosocial rehabilitation/recovery. \nAssessments use boilerplate language, are not\nindividualized, and are infrequently updated.  Further, ASH\nprovides insufficient, inappropriate psychological interventions.\nIn fact, treatment plans are generic and unresponsive to\nindividual problems, rendering them of little use.  In addition,\nthe provided psychological interventions are provided only\ninfrequently and are of poor quality.  Not surprisingly, there is\nscant participation in group and individual therapy. \nASH’s behavior management system substantially departs from\ngenerally accepted professional standards.  To develop an\neffective behavior program, generally accepted professional\npractice requires that psychology staff identify the underlying\nfactors that precipitate or cause the patient’s maladaptive\nbehavior (i.e., the “function” of the behavior) through an\nindividualized, formal functional assessment.  Notwithstanding an\nextensive need for behavioral interventions among its patients,\nASH employs few behavioral plans and interventions, none of which\nit individualizes.  Behavioral supports are prepared without an\nadequate functional analysis or assessment of undesirable\nbehaviors.  Behavioral plans are internally inconsistent, lack a\nreliable method to insure integrity of implementation, and lack \ncriteria for revision or termination.  Not surprisingly, we could\nuncover no evidence that these generic behavior plans actually\nmodify targeted behaviors. \nRehabilitative therapy is limited to activities that do not\nconstitute actual treatment and rehabilitation but rather is \nessentially diversionary, such as playing “bingo”.  Again,\ntherapy plans are not individualized, resulting in inadequate\ngroup and individual therapy services. \nASH staff frequently use PRN medications and/or restrictive\npractices in the absence of adequate treatment and/or as\npunishment.  Staff regularly use PRN medications and other\nrestrictive interventions as standard practice, without\nattempting to employ less restrictive alternatives.  According to\ngenerally accepted professional medication practices, PRN \n\n \n- 6 -\nmedications should only be used for psychiatric purposes as a\nshort-term measure.  ASH staff, however, repeatedly employ PRN\nmedications, without adequate review, as a substitute for\ntreatment of the patient’s underlying condition. \nThe harm to the patients caused by these deficiencies in\npsychological supports and services takes many forms, among them,\ndiagnoses that perpetuate their behavioral difficulties;\nunnecessarily extending their stay in a highly restrictive\nsetting; subjecting them to excessive and unnecessary use of\nseclusion, restraints, or sedating medications; fostering despair\nand hopelessness; and, in some cases, depriving them of physical\nsafety. \nIII.  PHARMACY \nASH’s pharmacy services substantially depart from generally\naccepted professional standards of care, exposing to significant\nactual and potential harm.  Pharmacists fail to adequately review\nindividual patients’ medication regimens, fail to adequately\nevaluate drug use at the facility, and fail to identify\nproblematic medication practices. \nAs part of integrated treatment, ASH pharmacists should\nattend and participate in treatment team meetings and planning.\nWe found inadequate documentation of communication between the\npharmacists and physicians regarding concerns, potential\nmedication interactions, and the need for laboratory testing.\nPharmacists also are inadequately involved in medical clinics.\nFurthermore, the Pharmacy and Therapeutic Committee fails to\ninsure safe medication standards of practice. \nBy not providing adequate pharmacy services, ASH places its\npatients at risk for the misuse of medication, unnecessary side\neffects from medication, potential drug interactions, general\nhealth problems, and excessively long hospitalizations. \nIV.  GENERAL MEDICAL CARE \nASH’s medical care substantially departs from generally\naccepted professional standards of care.  ASH fails to provide\nits patients with appropriate and timely preventative, routine,\nspecialized, and emergency services.  Overall, medical care at\nASH is reactive, and little attention is paid to identifying and\nresponding to significant changes in patients’ physical status,\nestablishing target outcomes, and measuring the success of \n\n \n- 7 -\ninterventions.  ASH only addresses acute health issues, with\nlittle, to no, initiation of interventions focused on prevention. \nASH fails to provide adequate physical, occupational, and\nspeech therapy assessments and services that permit persons\nevaluated for such services to regain, maintain, or improve\nfunctioning.  A number of patients at ASH have significant needs,\nbut have not been referred for physical, occupational, and speech\ntherapy.  Moreover, the physical, occupational, and speech\ntherapy staff are not integrated into the treatment teams.\nTherefore, therapy interventions are not consistently implemented\nand reinforced by other staff throughout a patient’s day.  This \ndeficient integration results in poor outcomes, even when\npatients are referred for such services. \nASH also fails to provide dietary and nutrition assessments\nand services that address comprehensively patients’ weight and\nother dietary issues through, among other things, mealtime\nprotocols, particularly for individuals at risk for aspiration. \nAlthough the facility’s dentist is enthusiastic, we found\nthat ASH provides inadequate dental services, because dentists\nare not available for the provision of emergency care during\nnonbusiness hours.  Consequently, patients needing emergency\ndental services have been required to wait days in significant\npain before being treated.  ASH also fails to provide adequate\ninfection control that tracks and trends infections and \ncommunicable diseases in an institutional setting. \nAlthough we found many dedicated staff, it was apparent that\nthe medical and psychiatric departments limit the participation\nand input of other clinicians, to the detriment of patient care.\nIn part because of a lack of integrated clinical participation,\nclinical decisions are being made without input from\nprofessionals possessing the necessary expertise. \nBy not providing adequate medical services, ASH exposes its\npatients to a significant risk of harm and actual harm due to the\nlack of timely, routine and preventative care, which causes\npatient health care to deteriorate, and results in a heightened\nneed for more specialized and emergent care. \nV.  NURSING \nASH’s nursing services substantially depart from generally\naccepted professional standards of care and treatment, and\nexpose patients there to a significant risk of harm and actual \n\n \n- 8 -\nharm.  In particular, nursing staff fail to adequately monitor\nand report changes in patients’ status, and fail to document\nthorough and complete medical progress notes.  Medication \nadministration records show missed medications and show that \nnurses fail to consistently document the administration of\nmedications.  Unit staff fail to identify, monitor, and report\npatients’ symptoms and side effects of medications.  We found \nnurses often are unfamiliar with mental health diagnoses,\nassociated symptoms, and appropriate treatments and\ninterventions.  Nurses often lack knowledge of their patients\nand do not effectively participate in the treatment team\nprocess.  These substantial deviations from generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care place individuals at ASH at a\nsignificant risk of harm.  The above problems are compounded by\nASH’s chronic shortage of nursing staff and prolonged mandatory\nuse of overtime.  They are also compounded by the fact that ASH\ndoes not fully utilize psychiatric nurse practitioners, who are\nnot allowed to work up to the full scope of their licenses. \nVI.  PLACEMENT IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING \nGenerally accepted professional standards of care and, as\nset forth above, federal law require that ASH actively pursue the\ntimely discharge to the most integrated, appropriate setting that\nis consistent with patients’ needs and the terms of any court-\nordered confinement.  In this regard, there have been\nunsuccessful placements, but the factors that contributed to\nthese unsuccessful placements are poorly identified and\naddressed.  ASH’s discharge planning process fails to meet these\nstandards of care.  ASH fails to identify and address factors\nthat contributed to previous unsuccessful placements.\nConsequently, the process results in unnecessarily extended\nhospitalizations, poor transitions, and a high likelihood of\nreadmission, all of which result in harm to ASH’s patients. \nVII.  PROTECTION FROM HARM \nGenerally accepted professional standards of practice call\nfor an incident management system that reports incidents,\ninvestigates incidents, identifies areas of improvement, and\ntracks incidents to identify systemic improvement opportunities.\nASH substantially departs from these professional standards by\nfailing to maintain an effective incident management system and a\nrelated quality assurance system to prevent harmful incidents,\nand identify and correct deficiencies in care and treatment. \n\n \n- 9 -\nThe quality of the investigations ASH completes is\ninadequate.  ASH does not interview witnesses, but simply\ndescribes the incident in a report.  No independent objective\nreview exists, nor are areas of improvement identified.\nFrequently, ASH also takes months to resolve complaints. \nAll incidents should be investigated, and each investigation\nshould result in a written report that includes a summary of the\ninvestigation, findings, and as appropriate, recommendations for\ncorrective action/areas for improvements.  Additionally, ASH does\nnot have an organized, coherent, written quality improvement plan\nthat defines the performance improvement priorities and\nobjectives for the hospital. \nAdverse environmental conditions, such as potential suicide\nhazards, are not adequately identified and prioritized for\nsystematic corrective action.  Finally, ASH fails to adequately\naddress inappropriate sexual contact among individuals served at\nthe facility, including sexual contact between staff and\npatients. \nConsequently, ASH fails to protect its patients from\navoidable harm.  The harm that ASH patients experience as a\nresult of these deficiencies is multifaceted, including physical\nand psychological abuse; physical injury; excessive and\ninappropriate use of physical and chemical restraints;\ninadequate, ineffective and counterproductive treatment; and\nexcessively long hospitalizations. \nVIII.  MINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES \nThe minimum remedial measures required to protect the\nconstitutional and federal statutory rights of the patients at\nASH are outlined below and more extensively detailed in the\n“Enhancement Plan,” negotiated between the State and the\nDepartment: \n\t\nA. Integrated Treatment Planning  ASH should provide its\npatients with integrated treatment planning consistent\nwith generally accepted professional standards of care. \n\t\nB. Assessments  ASH should ensure that its patients\nreceive accurate, complete, and timely assessments,\nconsistent with generally accepted professional \n\n- 10 -\nstandards of care, and that these assessments drive\ntreatment interventions. \n\t\nC. Psychiatry Services  ASH should provide adequate\npsychiatric supports and services for the treatment of\nthe severely and persistently mentally ill population\nit serves in accordance with generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care. \n\t\nD. Psychology Services  ASH should provide psychological\nsupports and services adequate to treat the functional\nand behavioral needs of its patients according to\ngenerally accepted professional standards of care. \n\t\nE. Restraints, Seclusion, and PRN Medications  ASH should \nensure that restraints, seclusion, and PRN medications\nare used in accordance with generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care. \n\t\nF. Pharmacy  ASH’s patients should receive pharmacy\nservices consistent with generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care. \n\t\nG. General Medical Care  ASH should provide adequate\npreventative, routine, specialized, and emergency\nmedical services, occupational, physical, and speech\ntherapy, and dental and dietary services, on a timely\nbasis, in accordance with generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care. \n\t\nH. Nursing Care  ASH should provide nursing services to\nits patients consistent with generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care.  Such services should \nresult in ASH’s patients receiving individualized\nservices, supports, and therapeutic interventions,\nconsistent with their treatment plans. \n\t\nI. Documentation of Patient Progress  ASH should ensure \nthat patient records accurately reflect patient\nprogress, consistent with generally accepted\nprofessional standards of care. \n\n \n- 11 -\n\t\nJ. Discharge Planning and Placement in the Most Integrated\nSetting  Within the limitations of court-imposed\nconfinement, the State should pursue actively the\nappropriate discharge of patients and ensure that they\nare provided services in the most integrated,\nappropriate setting that is consistent with the\npatients’ needs. \n\t\nK. Protection From Harm  ASH should provide its patients\nwith a safe and humane environment and protect them\nfrom harm. \n***** \nWe hope to continue working with the State in an amicable\nand cooperative fashion to resolve our outstanding concerns with\nregard to ASH.  Provided that our cooperative relationship\ncontinues, we will forward our expert consultants’ reports under\nseparate cover.  Although their reports are their work – and do\nnot necessarily represent the official conclusions of the\nDepartment of Justice - their observations, analyses and\nrecommendations provide further elaboration of the relevant\nconcerns, and offer practical assistance in addressing them.  We \nhope that you will give this information careful consideration\nand that it will assist in your efforts at prompt remediation. \nWe are obligated to advise you that, in the unexpected event\nthat we are unable to reach a resolution regarding our concerns,\nwithin 49 days after your receipt of this letter, the Attorney\nGeneral is authorized to initiate a lawsuit pursuant to CRIPA, to\ncorrect deficiencies of the kind identified in this letter.  See \n42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(1).  We would very much prefer, however, to\nresolve this matter by working cooperatively with you.\nAccordingly, we will soon contact State officials to discuss this\nmatter in further detail. \n\n \n- 12 -\nIf you have any questions regarding this letter, please call\nShanetta Y. Cutlar, Chief of the Civil Rights Division’s Special\nLitigation Section, at (202) 514-0195. \nSincerely, \nWan J.
