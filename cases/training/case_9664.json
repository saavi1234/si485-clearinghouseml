    "summary": "<p>On July 13, 1998, plaintiff, Bronwyn Ford, filed a civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, seeking damages from the City of Boston arising from two alleged strip-searches that followed her arrest on a defective warrant.  Brown claimed that after being wrongly arrested, she was taken to the Boston Police Station on Berkeley Street where she was strip-searched and was then transported to the Suffolk County Jail on Nashua Street were she was strip-searched again, prior to her detention.  Brown further alleged that while in custody she was denied medical treatment by officials deliberately indifferent to her needs.  She alleged violations of the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and of Massachusetts state law.  Suffolk County was subsequently added as a defendant.</p><p>On December 10, 1998, a female plaintiff represented by Boston civil rights attorney Howard Friedman filed a class action Section 1983 lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  The lawsuit challenged the strip search policies of the Boston Police Department and the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department.  The class action case, styled Mack v. Suffolk County, alleged that all women arrested by the Boston Police Department and who could not post bail were transported to the Suffolk County Jail for detention pending an initial court appearance.  Mack further alleged that at all persons confined at the Suffolk County Jail were subjected to a stripsearch and a visual body cavity search, regardless of the offense charged and whether or not there was reasonable suspicion that the search would produce weapons or contraband.  Mack alleged that the County's blanket strip search policy violated the Fourth Amendment.  Mack further alleged that because the Boston PD only sent female pre-arraignment detainees to the Suffolk County Jail (male detainees were held in police holding cells), only female detainees had to suffer through the unconstitutional blank strip-search policy, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p><p>The Ford and Mack cases were litigated separately for over a year.  During that time, the respective parties engaged in motion practice and discovery.  The Mack case was certified as a class action on February 16, 2000.  Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000) (District Judge Nancy Gertner).  In an unpublished order, Judge Gertner consolidated the cases on April 4, 2000.  While the Ford case was designated as the lead case because it had been filed first, the consolidation order essentially placed the cases under the leadership of class counsel Friedman.  After the consolidation, Ms. Ford decided to opt out of the class so that she could pursue her individual damage claim.</p><p>All parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, which Judge Gertner ruled on in two separate opinions dated July 31, 2001.  As to the Mack class claims, Judge Gertner noted that Suffolk County strip search policy changed over the relevant class period.  Until late May 1999, the policy was for all prisoners to be strip searched.  On May 24, 1999, the policy was amended to require a finding of probable cause prior to a strip-search of an arrestee charged with a misdemeanor, but continued to require strip-searches of all arrestees charged with felonies. On September 20, 1999, the County eliminated altogether the routine strip-searching of pre-arraignment detainees.  Because of the policy change, Judge Gertner created two sub-classes: (1) Sub- class I: class members who were searched following arrests (either originally or on a default warrant) for offenses involving neither violence nor drugs (class representative Katrina Mack); and (2) Sub-Class II: the remaining class members, who were searched after following arrests for offenses (either misdemeanors or felonies) involving drugs or ``violence\" (class-representative to be determined).  Judge Gertner found that the County's search policies during the class period were facially unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.  She entered summary judgment against both the City and the County for the strip searches of women charged with felonies and misdemeanors not involving drugs or guns, and for women arrested on default warrants for such offenses.  Summary judgment was denied as to particular strip-searches of women who arrested for drug offenses or violent crimes.  Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F. Supp.2d 131 (D. Mass. 2001).</p><p>On Ford's individual claims, Judge Gertner granted Ford summary judgment on the issue of liability for her Fourth Amendment and equal protection claims (strip-searches).  Sheriff Rouse was granted qualified immunity for Ford's claims and the County was granted summary judgment on Ford's medical deprivation claim.  Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F.Supp.2d 123 (D.Mass. 2001).</p><p>Immediately after the rulings, the City and the Mack class began settlement discussions.  The City initially refused to talk settlement with Ford, but eventually agreed to mediation.  Ford's claims did not settle.  Mediation proceeded with the class claims and a global settlement was reached with both the City and the County.</p><p>Under the Settlement Agreement, which was approved by the Court on October 1, 2002, the County and the City agreed to pay $10 million ($5 million from each) for settlement of the class claims.  Of that sum, the Court approved $3 million for attorney's fees (30%), plus $142,101 for litigation costs (1.42%) and $110,247 for claims administration expenses (1.1%) for a total of 32.52% of the settlement.  Class representatives were awarded a $15,000 incentive bonus.  The remainder was allocated among the class members per an agreed distribution formula.   (See JC-MA-10-0002).</p><p>Suffolk County did not timely make its $5 million settlement payment and was held in contempt.  The Court levied fines $74,948.79 against Suffolk County.</p><p>The Ford case eventually settled as well on all issues except attorney's fees. Judge Gertner awarded Ford's attorneys only $18,816.50, finding that Ford piggybacked the efforts of attorney Friedman in the Mack litigation.</p><p>We have no information indicating material post-settlement activity in either case.</p><p></p>",

DEFINITIONS \nl.  A \"Claimant\" is a person who submits a valid complete Settlement Claim \nForm postmarked on or before September 20, 2002 to the claims administrator. \n2.  A \"Participating Class Member\")s a claimant who has been verified as a \nclass member by the claims administrator after review of the information supplied by the \nclaimant in the Settlement Claim Form. \n3.  The \"Data\" is the electronic booking data used by Suffolk County which has \nbeen provided to plaintiffs' counsel. \nII.  PARTICIPATING CLASS MEMBER VERIFICATION \n4.  The claims administrator will verify that a claimant is  a class member by \nreviewing the information provided by the claimant in the Settlement Claim Form and \nchecking it against the data. This information includes the claimant's name, social security \nnumber, date of birth and any alias information. \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56-3      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 3 of 8\n5.  If a claimant cannot be verified as a class member, the claims administrator \nwill send a Notice of Claim Denial to the claimant within- 14 davs of the deadline for \n/ \nsubmitting Settlement Claim Forms.  A copy of the notice is attached as Exhibit D.  Any \nclaimant who disagrees 'ivith the determination that she is not a class member may appeal \nto a special master to be appointed by the Court \">vi thin I 4 days from the date the claims \nadministrator sends the claimant the Notice of Claim Denial.  The claimant must submit \na written statement 'ivith supporting documentary evidence whjch shows that the data is \nincorrect or incomplete.  The evidence may include a notarized letter from t~e County, \ncriminal offender's record information (CORI), or certified court documents from  the \ncriminal case.  The special master will make a determination of class membership vvithin \n30 days of the claimant's appeal of claim denial and will report his findings to the claims \nadministrator and class counsel.  Rulings by the special master shall be final and binding. \n6.  Rose King, attorney for Suffolk County, has als·o agreed to accept telephone \ncalls from claimants to verify the data.  If attorney King is able to verify that a claimant \nis a class member, she 'ivill forward the verified class member's booking information to the \nclaims administrator and class counsel.  The verified class member 'ivill need not appeal \nto the special master. \n7.  If claimant is  verified as  a class member,  the claims administrator will \nidentify all of the class member's booking admissions into the Jail during the class period \nby reviewing the name,  Suffolk County unique identification number, social security \nnumber and date of birth of the class member. \n2 \n\nCase 0:99-cv-03126-DRH     Document 56-3      Filed 03/01/2007     Page 4 of 8\nIII.  SETTLEMENT CATEGORIES \n8.  To determine each participating class member's-share in the settlement, the \nclaims administrator will place the class member into one of four settlement categories \nbased on the data. \n9.  Membership in a settlement category vv:ill be determined based on the crime \ncharged at time of the participating class member's admission into the Nashua Street Jail. \nIf the participating class member was charged vv:ith more than one crime during t:C:e class \nperiod, the most severe crime determines her membership in a settlement \ncat~gory. \nl 0.

Garand,\nSuffolk County Sheriff's Department, Boston, MA, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM RE: MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT BY AND\nAGAINST PLAINTIFF FORD\nGERTNER, District Judge.\nPlaintiff Bronwyn Ford (\"Ford\") was arrested on a defective default warrant and subjected to two strip-searches\n[1]\nand one visual body cavity search while in custody.  She challenges the constitutionality of these searches\nunder the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and under the\nConstitution and common-law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In addition, she claims the defendants\nwere deliberately indifferent to her medical needs while in custody, in violation of the Fourth, Eighth, and\nFourteenth Amendments.\nFord moves for summary judgment against the City of Boston (\"City\") on her Fourth Amendment claim relating to\nthe search at the Boston Police Department's (\"BPD\") Berkeley Street facility (\"Berkeley Street lockup\"), against\nSuffolk County (\"County\"), Richard Rouse (\"Rouse\"), and the City on her Fourth Amendment claims relating to\nthe search at the Nashua Street Jail (\"County Jail\"), and against the City on her equal protection claim. The City\ncross-moves for summary judgment of all counts in which it is named (Counts I, IV, V, and VI), and the County\n125 and Sheriff *125 Rouse (together, \"County defendants\") move for summary judgment of all claims in which they\n[2]\nare named (Counts III, IV, V, and VI).\nFor the reasons discussed below, Ford and the County's motions for summary judgment [docket entries # 41 and\n42] are hereby ALLOWED in part and DENIED in part. The City's motion for summary judgment [docket entry #\n90] is DENIED. Specifically, I issue the following rulings:\n1. Summary Judgment is DENIED as to the City's liability for the alleged booking search by City\npolice officers at the Berkeley Street lockup.\n2. Summary judgment is GRANTED for Ford as to the County and City's liability under the Fourth\nAmendment, and the City's liability under the Equal Protection Clause, for the strip and visual\nbody cavity search by officials at the County Jail. The amount of damages to which Ford is entitled\nraises questions of fact that must be resolved in a future proceeding.\n3. Rouse is entitled to sovereign immunity for his role in the strip-search at the County Jail.\n\n4. Summary judgment is DENIED as to any defendants' liability under Article XIV of the\nMassachusetts Declaration of Rights.\n5. Summary judgment is GRANTED in favor of the County defendants as to their alleged\ndeliberate indifference to the plaintiff's medical needs while incarcerated. And finally,\n6. Summary judgment is DENIED as to the City's liability for negligent infliction of emotional\ndistress resulting from the searches at the City and County Jails.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Facts Relating to the BPD's Policy of Transferring Female\nArrestees to the County Jail\nThe reader is referred to the Background section of the accompanying Memorandum Re: Motions for Summary\nJudgment by and Against the Class Plaintiffs [hereinafter, \"Class Summary Judgment Memorandum\"] for a\ngeneral discussion of the BPD's policy of transporting all female arrestees to the County Jail for detention\npending an initial court appearance, and for a detailed description of the comprehensive strip-search policy in\nplace at that Jail at the time Ford was detained there.\nB. Facts as Presented by the Plaintiff\nFord tells a very simple story. On February 19, 1997, she was arrested at her home on a default warrant for\n[3]\nfailure to pay a restitution fee on a charge of malicious destruction of property valued over $250.00.  On the\nway to the police vehicle, Ford was handcuffed. The arresting officers neither searched nor frisked her in any way\nduring or after the arrest.\nUpon arrival at the Berkeley Street lockup, Ford was searched by a female officer, Loletha Graham-Smith\n126 (\"Officer Graham-Smith\"). Ford alleges that she was completely naked during the search, *126 but she does not\nindicate that Officer Graham-Smith conducted a visual body-cavity inspection.\nFollowing the strip-search, Ford was allowed to dress. She was then placed in a cell to await transport to the\nCounty Jail. Ford was held in the cell, alone, for over an hour.\nFord indicates that she was transported to the County Jail in the custody of two Boston police officers. According\nto the officers in question, although they do not specifically recall transporting Ford, their usual practice at the\ntime was to ensure that arrestees never left their sight, custody, or control from the time they were taken from the\nholding cage at the City police station until they were turned over to booking officers at the County Jail. Arrestees\nremained handcuffed during the entire transfer.\nAs part of the admission process at the County Jail, Ford was required to submit to a full strip and visual body\ncavity search. As detailed in the Background section of the Class Summary Judgment Memorandum, this second\nstrip-search was thorough, invasive, and humiliating. Ford indicates she was told to strip, to lift her breasts so the\nJail officials could inspect underneath them, and to bend over and spread the cheeks of her buttocks apart. She\nwas then allowed to dress and placed in a holding cell, where she remained overnight.\nAt some point during her ordeal, Ford avers, her personal belongings were confiscated by County officers.\nAlthough she repeatedly asked Jail officials to return certain prescription medications, the officials refused either\n[4]\nto return the medications or to attend to her medical needs in any other way.\nThe next morning, Ford was taken to Lynn District Court. The court reviewed the docket in her case and\nultimately dismissed the case, as \"the warrant was issued in error.\"\n\nC. Facts as Presented by the Defendants\nThe defendants do not contest that City police officers arrested Ford, searched her at the Berkeley Street lockup,\nand then transferred her to the County Jail, where she was subjected to a strip and body cavity search. The\ndefendants do, however, challenge certain other details of Ford's story.\nSpecifically, Officer Graham-Smith states that she does not remember searching Ford, but that it was not her\npractice to require female arrestees to be completely naked during a search. Further, the City indicates that Ford\n[5]\nwas carrying two sharp knives in her handbag at the time of the arrest.\nIn addition, with respect to Ford's alleged requests for her medication while she was in County custody, the\nCounty defendants indicate that Ford never requested 00and, indeed, explicitly refused00 medical attention while\n97 97\nat the County Jail. Further, they allege that while Ford was at the Jail, she never informed Jail staff that she\nsuffered from any conditions or symptoms requiring medical attention.\n127  II. DISCUSSION\n*127\nA. Summary Judgment Standard\nThe summary judgment standard is fully described in the corresponding section of the Class Summary Judgment\nMemorandum.\nB. Federal and State Constitutional Law Governing Strip-searches\nThe federal law in this Circuit regarding strip and visual body cavity searches is discussed at length in the Class\nSummary Judgment Memorandum. In this context, the following summary suffices.\nReferring to the general issue of \"reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment,\" the Supreme Court has\ninstructed lower courts reviewing searches to \"balanc[e] ... the need for the particular search against the invasion\nof personal rights that the search entails\" (\"the Bell balancing test\"). Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct.\n1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). First Circuit case law applying this test provides additional, though somewhat\nequivocal guidance. In 1993, the court concluded that strip and visual body cavity searches must be justified, at\nthe least, by a reasonable suspicion that the individual being searched is carrying a weapon or harboring\ncontraband. Id., 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1997). The court did not, however, articulate the constitutional prerequisite\nto a strip-search in the absence of a visual body cavity inspection, stating only that \"strip and/or visual body cavity\nsearches are not routine, and must be carefully evaluated.\" Then, in Roberts v. Rhode Island, the First Circuit\nsuggested that in cases involving \"particularly dangerous\" prisoners or arrestees charged with violent felonies,\ninstitutional security concerns might justify strip and visual body cavity searches in the absence of particularized\nreasonable suspicion. Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 111-12 (1st Cir.2001).\nBy comparison, state law on the issue is less ambiguous. Article XIV of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights,\nMass. Const. pt. 1, art. XIV, provides every person the right \"to be secure from all unreasonable searches.\" \nSwain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d at 110012 (1st Cir.1997). Further, the Supreme Judicial Court recently\n97\nheld00presumably, though not explicitly, under this Article00\"that probable cause is the appropriate standard to\n97 97\napply to strip and visual body cavity searches.\" Commonwealth v. Thomas, 429 Mass. 403, 708 N.E.2d 669, 673\n(1999). Thus, Massachusetts courts apply a stricter standard to strip and visual body cavity searches than do\nfederal courts in this circuit. Accord Swain, 117 F.3d at 11 (expressing a similar view, but before Thomas was\ndecided).\n\nC. Discussion of Plaintiff's Claims\nIn the interests of clarity, I discuss Ford's claims in the order in which the alleged injuries occurred, rather than the\norder in which the claims are listed in Ford's complaint. I therefore begin with the search at the Berkeley Street\nlockup, then address, in turn, the search at the County Jail, Sheriff Rouse's claim of qualified immunity, the\nplaintiff's claims under Article XIV of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, and the County defendants' alleged\ndeliberate indifference to Ford's medical needs, and finally I address the City's liability for negligent infliction of\nemotional distress.\n1. Search at the Berkeley Street Lockup\nCity liability for the alleged strip-search at the Berkeley Street lockup cannot be determined on summary\n128 judgment, as numerous issues of material fact remain unresolved. To begin with, although Ford *128 claims that\nshe was naked during the search, Officer Graham-Smith denies that the women she searched were completely\nnaked at any point during a search. Without a more accurate factual picture of the extent of the search at the\nBerkeley Street lockup, I can neither conduct the Bell balancing test nor determine the appropriate state legal\nstandard to assess the constitutionality of that search.\nFurther, even assuming that the search at the Berkeley Street lockup was unconstitutional under the\nCommonwealth or Federal Constitution, Ford cannot establish City liability for the search unless she can show\nthat an \"official policy [was] the moving force [behind] the constitutional violation.\" Monell v. Department of Social\nServs., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); Hancock v. Town of Wakefield, 1996 WL\n490175, *4 (Mass.Super.1996) (concluding that the Supreme Judicial Court would apply Monell to the MCRA\n(citing Rodriques v. Furtado, 575 N.E.2d 1124, 1131 (1991))). I cannot make this determination on the record\nnow before me.\nIn support of her claim that City policy provided the moving force behind the alleged constitutional violation, Ford\nmaintains that the City failed either to promulgate a constitutional strip-search policy or to train its officers\nregarding the legal requirements for a strip-search. While I certainly agree that, in principal, failure to promulgate\na policy or provide training \"may be fairly said to represent a policy for which [a] city is responsible,\" such\nresponsibility only attaches if \"the need for more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy so likely to\nresult in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have\nbeen deliberately indifferent to the need.\" City of Canton Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 390, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103\nL.Ed.2d 412 (1989).\nHere, Ford variably alleges (1) that the BPD had a policy (Rule 318) under which all female arrestees were strip-\nsearched, and (2) that the BPD had \"no policy ... on strip-searches and that such lack of policy caused the police\nofficers to not know the rules regarding strip-searches.\" These vague and seemingly contradictory allegations are\ninsufficient to prove, as a matter of law, that the City was \"deliberately indifferent\" to the constitutional rights of\narrestees.\nOn the other hand, Ford does introduce sufficient evidence to raise a genuine question of fact as to whether the\nCity paid adequate attention to the evolving case law regarding the constitutional requirements for a strip-search.\nSpecifically, Officer Graham-Smith's testimony about the wide range of circumstances in which she routinely\nstrip-searched arrestees strongly suggests a need for a new search policy and/or further training. Further, the\nCity's blithe assertions that \"Rule 318 does not mandate a strip-search,\" and \"it is not the policy of the [BPD] to\nstrip-search women being transferred to the Suffolk County Jail,\" do little to dispel this suggestion, particularly as\nthe City is apparently unable to articulate what its strip-search policy was at the time Ford was arrested.\nThus, I find that Ford has introduced sufficient evidence to raise genuine questions of fact regarding the\nconstitutionality both of the strip-search at the Berkeley Street lockup, and of the City's then-applicable search\n\"policy.\" These questions of fact preclude summary judgment in favor of either party on any issue arising out of\n\nthe contested City strip-search. Ford and the City's motions for summary judgment are therefore DENIED insofar\nas they relate to the search at the Berkeley Street lockup.\n129  2. Search at the County Jail\n*129\nFord's claims relating to the search at the County Jail are completely addressed by my discussion in the Class\nSummary Judgment Memorandum. Had Ford chosen to remain in the class, she would have been a member of\nSub-Class I, as her underlying offense00smashing the headlights of someone's empty car with an empty beer\n97\n[6]\nbottle00involved neither drugs nor violence against another individual.  As such, Ford is entitled to damages\n97\nfrom the City and the County for violation of her Fourth Amendment rights in connection with the search at the\nCounty Jail, and from the City for violation of her equal protection rights. The amount of damages to which Ford is\nentitled remains to be determined. Ford's motion for summary judgment is therefore GRANTED, and the\ndefendants' corresponding motions are DENIED, insofar as they relate to the City and County's liability for the\nunconstitutional search at the County Jail.\n3. Sheriff Rouse's Qualified Immunity\nFor the reasons stated in the Class Summary Judgment Memorandum, I conclude that Rouse has established\nthe defense of sovereign immunity for his role in the County strip-search, as the search occurred before June 25,\n1997, when the First Circuit issued its decision in Swain, supra. Accordingly, the County defendants' motion for\nsummary judgment is GRANTED with respect to Sheriff Rouse's liability for Ford's injuries.\n4. Claims under Article XIV of the Constitution of the Commonwealth\nThe defendants seek summary judgment of the plaintiffs' claims under Article XIV of the Massachusetts\nDeclaration of Rights, on the grounds that the \"Declaration of Rights does not provide for a direct, private, right of\naction without a statutory basis or vehicle.\" This may be true, but it is irrelevant. As the First Circuit observed in \nSwain, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (\"MCRA\") provides a private right of action for vindication of \"rights\nprotected by either federal or state law.\" 117 F.3d at 11-12. Thus, the defendants' motions for summary judgment\n[7]\nof Ford's Article XIV claims are DENIED.\n5. County Defendants' Deliberate Indifference to Ford's Medical Needs\nat the County Jail\nI next consider the County defendants' request for summary judgment of Ford's Eighth Amendment allegations\n130 regarding inadequate provision of medical care at the *130 County Jail. Ford's filings on this issue are quite\nsparse. In her complaint, she says only that during her detention, she \"repeatedly asked for her medication (in\nher pocketbook) which was prescribed by her doctor for a serious health condition,\" and that these requests were\ndenied, apparently by Jail officials. Then, in her opposition to the County defendants' motion for summary\njudgment, Ford alleges more broadly that she \"requested [medical] help\" while in the County Jail, but Jail officials\n\"denied [her] her medication and ignored her medical needs.\" Neither of these pleadings provide any information\nat all about the nature of Ford's alleged medical condition.\nFord's deposition provides some additional information. For example, Ford indicates that she suffers from\nmigraine headaches and takes beta blockers preventively. In the deposition, however, Ford directly states that\nshe does not recall asking to see a nurse while at the County Jail, nor informing any staff at the Jail that she was\n\"experiencing the symptoms of a migraine headache.\"\nThese few facts are simply insufficient to support Ford's Eighth Amendment claim. Most tellingly, Ford does not\nbring a claim against the individuals directly responsible for the alleged deprivation of medical care. As a result,\nher claim cannot be premised solely on Jail officials' treatment of her but must rest more broadly on the County\n\nand Sheriff Rouse's deliberate indifference to the medical needs of all Jail inmates. But Ford provides absolutely\nno evidence to support this broader claim. Without any such evidence, Ford's conclusory allegation that\nconditions at the Jail violate the Eighth Amendment cannot survive summary judgment. Accordingly, the County\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment of Ford's Eight Amendment claim is GRANTED.\n6. City's Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (Count I)\nFinally, I consider Ford's claim against the City for negligent infliction of emotional distress as a result of the strip-\nsearches at the City and County Jails. This claim requires Ford to prove: \"(1) negligence (duty of reasonable care\nand breach of that duty); (2) emotional distress; (3) causation; (4) physical harm manifested by objective\nsymptomatology; and (5) that a reasonable person would have suffered emotional distress under like\ncircumstances.\" Brimage v. City of Boston, 2001 WL 69488, *1 (Mass.Super.2001) (citing Payton v. Abbott Labs,\n386 Mass. 540, 437 N.E.2d 171, 181 (1982)). Ford bases the claim on the City's alleged failure to formulate a\nconstitutional strip-search policy or to train City police officers regarding the constitutional prerequisites to such a\nsearch.\nThe City argues that it is entitled to summary judgment of this claim, because State law provides immunity to\nmunicipalities for \"any claim arising out of an intentional tort.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, § 10(c). The City\nobserves that a strip-search \"is a prototypical intentional act,\" and it therefore concludes that it is immune to\nliability for any emotional distress Ford may have suffered as a result of the contested searches.\nThe City correctly states Massachusetts law, but I question its reasoning. While I certainly agree that a strip-\nsearch is an intentional \"act,\" it is not an intentional tort unless the officer performing the search acted with \"intent\nto harm (or a state of mind of knowing that the act would result in a violation of a legally protected right).\" Foster\n131 v. McGrail, 844 F.Supp. 16, 25 (D.Mass.1994) (citing *131Schenker v. Binns, 18 Mass.App.Ct. 404, 466 N.E.2d\n131 (1984)). Thus, the strip-searches of Ford cannot have been intentional torts unless the officers performing\nthe searches knew at the time that the searches were unlawful. But this is precisely what Ford contests: She\nargues that the City failed to adequately train the officers, as a result of which they did not know, at the time, that\nthe searches were unconstitutional. If Ford is ultimately able to prove her claim of failure to train she will also\nhave conclusively proven that the strip-searches were not intentional torts.\nPut differently, the fact that the same set of circumstances could also form the basis for intentional tort claims\ndoes not preclude Ford's alternative theory of the case. According to Ford, the City failed adequately to train its\nofficers, so it is the City that should be liable for the officers' resulting (uninformed, and therefore unintentional)\nviolation of her rights. Ford must still establish the factual truth of this story at trial, but assuming she is able to do\nso, Massachusetts law does not grant the City immunity from her claim. Therefore, the City's request for\nsummary judgment of this claim is DENIED.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above and in the Class Summary Judgment Memorandum, all parties' motions for\nsummary judgment are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The details of this decision are provided above\nand in the attached Order Re: Summary Judgment Motions.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Ford opted out of the certified class of plaintiffs, but she continues to be a party to this action, and to pursue\nher individual claims against the defendants. This Memorandum only addresses Ford's individual claims. I\naddress the claims of the plaintiff class in another Memorandum, also issued today.\n[2] This Court previously dismissed Count II of the plaintiff's complaint.\n[3] Apparently, Ford struck someone's car with a bag of beer bottles and broke at least one headlight and one\nwindow. \n\nThe default warrant was later determined to be defective, as Ford had previously paid the restitution fee in full.\nFord does not allege, however, that any of the defendants knew or should have known, at any time relevant here,\nthat the warrant was defective.\n[4] Although the record is not entirely clear on this point, Ford apparently takes a prescription medication to\nprevent migraines. She does not indicate whether she actually had a headache while in the County Jail, or simply\nwished to take the medication preventively.\n[5] Although City officials apparently failed to find these knives, County officials found them upon Ford's\nadmission to the County Jail.\n[6] The fact that Ford had two small knives in her handbag when she was admitted to the County Jail does not\naffect this analysis. Ford indicates, and the County does not dispute, that the knives were \"tiny\" pen-knives, one\nwooden, and one with inlaid stones. Ford alleges she carried them to \"cut apples and carrots at the barn to give\nmy horse.\" If the presence of such small penknives in an arrestee's handbag, without more, were sufficient to\ncreate \"reasonable suspicion\" that the arrestee was harboring weapons or contraband, that jurisprudential\nstandard would afford little protection. Almost every woman carries some small sharp objects in her handbag\n00nailfiles, keys, ballpoint pens, safety pins. I do not dispute the Jail officials' right and obligation to confiscate the\n97\nknives, but I cannot accept that their mere presence in Ford's handbag justified her strip and visual body cavity\nsearch.\n[7] Ford does not request summary judgment of this claim, so I reach no conclusion as to its underlying merits. I\nremind Ford, however, that in order to maintain her claim under the MCRA, she must ultimately prove, based on\nthe specific facts of her case, that the injuries resulting from her strip-search were \"perpetrated by `threats,\nintimidation, or coercion' as required under Massachusetts law.\" Swain, 117 F.3d at 12.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

INTRODUCTION\n1.  The  parties  to  this  action,  Katrina  Mack  and  the  additional class\nrepresentatives (“Plaintiffs”), and Suffolk County and the City of Boston (“Defendants”),\nby counsel, have entered into this Settlement Agreement.\nII.  BACKGROUND\n2.  The  plaintiff  Katrina  Mack  filed  this  action  on  December  10, 1998,\nchallenging the constitutionality of strip-searches at the Suffolk County Jail.\n3.  On February 16, 2000, this Court certified this case as a class action\npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 (b)(2) and (b)(3) for all women who, between December 10,\n1995 and September 20, 1999, were:\na.  taken into custody by the Boston Police Department and transferred\nto the Suffolk County Jail pursuant to Boston Police Department\nrules regarding the custody of female prisoners to be held pending a\nfirst court appearance, or after an arrest on a default warrant; and\nb.  subjected to a routine strip-search and visual body cavity search at the\nSuffolk County Jail pursuant to the policy, practice or custom of the\nSuffolk County Sheriff.\n\n4.  An approved class action notice was sent to all potential class members at\ntheir last known addresses in September 2000.\n5. All class members are bound by this Settlement Agreement except for ten\nwomen who sent a timely Notice of Exclusion. \n6.  On  July  31,  2001,  this  Court  granted  plaintiffs’  motion  for summary\njudgment establishing the defendants’ liability.\nIII.  TERMS OF SETTLEMENT\n7.  The defendants will pay the sum of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00)\ninto a settlement fund to settle all claims brought by the plaintiffs in this action, including\nattorney’s fees and costs (“Settlement Amount”).\n8.  Class counsel recommends Blackman Kallick Bartelstein LLP, 300 South\nRiverside  Plaza,  Suite  660,  Chicago  IL,  to  be  approved  by  the  Court  as  claims\nadministrator for this settlement.  Class counsel will oversee the settlement administration\nprocess and distribution phases and will provide direction to the claims administrator as\nneeded.\n9.  The claims administrator will arrange for an escrow agent to maintain an\ninterest bearing settlement fund account.\n10.  The County agrees that it will make its best effort to pay $5 million into the\nsettlement fund account no later than 12:00 noon on September 6, 2002.  If the County,\ndespite its best efforts to obtain funding, is unable to make its payment by 12:00 noon on\n2\n\nSeptember 6, 2002, the County will make its payment as soon as possible thereafter.  In\nany event, the County agrees that it will make its payment of $5 million into the\nsettlement fund account no later than 12:00 noon on November 29, 2002.  If the County\nfails to make its full payment by 12:00 noon on November 29, 2002, then the County\nshall pay in addition interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum, compounded daily, on\nall unpaid amounts until all of such unpaid amount and accrued interest have been paid.\n11.  The City agrees to pay $5 million into the settlement fund account no later\nthan 12:00 noon on September 6, 2002, provided that the County also pays $5 million\nby that time.  If the County, despite its best efforts to obtain funding, is unable to make\nits payment by 12:00 noon on September 6, 2002, the City will be permitted to hold its\npayment until the day the County makes its payment.  In any event, the City agrees that\nit will make its payment of $5 million into the settlement fund account no later than\n12:00 noon on November 29, 2002.  If the City fails to make its full payment on the same\nday as the County or by 12:00 noon on November 29, 2002, whichever is applicable, then\nthe City shall pay in addition interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum, compounded\ndaily, on all unpaid amounts until all of such unpaid amount and accrued interest have\nbeen paid.\n12.  The settlement amount and any interest earned in the settlement fund\naccount until the date of distribution shall belong to the plaintiffs.  If there is any balance\nin the settlement fund account from additional interest earned after all of the settlement\n3\n\nchecks have been distributed and all expenses, bonuses and attorney’s fees have been paid,\nthe plaintiff will petition the Court for instructions on the distribution of the remaining\nfunds.\n13.  A  hearing  by  the  Court  to  approve  the  settlement  will  take  place on\nThursday, September 26, 2002 at 2:30 p.m.  Any objections to the proposed settlement\nwill be heard by the Court at that time as provided below.\nIV.  CLAIMS PROCEDURES AND SETTLEMENT FUND DISTRIBUTION\n14.  A Notice of Class Action Settlement and of the Hearing to Approve the\nSettlement will be sent by first class mail postage prepaid to all potential class members\nwith good addresses within 15 days of the Court’s Order granting preliminary approval\nof settlement.  The notice will include the following:\na.  Terms of the settlement;\nb.  The class member’s right to contest the settlement by first filing a\nwritten objection within the time period for filing a claim form and\nthen by appearing in person or through counsel at the fairness hearing\non September 26, 2002 at 2:30 p.m.; and\nc.  A  Settlement  Claim  Form,  which  must  be  submitted  by class\nmembers in order to share in the settlement fund.\nA copy of the notice is attached as Exhibit A.  Notice will also be made by publication for\ntwo days in the Boston Herald, copy attached as Exhibit B.\n15.  The claims administrator will establish a Claims Hotline with a toll free\nnumber staffed live two days a week, from the day after the mailing the Notice of Class\n4\n\nAction  Settlement  through  the  deadline  by  which  class  members  must  submit  a\nSettlement Claim Form, to answer questions from class members about the notice, the\nSettlement Claim Form or the fairness hearing.  On days when the Claims Hotline is not\nstaffed live, the claims administrator will run a tape recording that will provide the class\nmembers with information about the class action and times to call the Claims Hotline to\nspeak to a person.  Under the supervision and direction of class counsel, the claims\nadministrator will also answer any questions posed in letters from class members. \n16.  Class members must submit a valid and complete Settlement Claim Form\npostmarked no later than September 20, 2002 (at least 45 days from the date of mailing\nof the Notice of Class Action Settlement) in order to share in the settlement fund.  A copy\nof the claim form is attached as Exhibit C.  \n17.  If a class member objects to the proposed settlement, she must submit a\nletter of objection, in addition to the Settlement Claim Form, postmarked no later than\nSeptember 20, 2002 (at least 45 days from the date of mailing of the Notice of Class\nAction Settlement).  She must also appear in person or through counsel at the September\n26, 2002 fairness hearing to have her objection considered by the Court.  The claims\nadministrator will forward all letters of objection to the Court and to counsel for all\nparties.\n18.  The claims administrator will verify that a person who submits a valid\nSettlement Claim Form postmarked on or before September 20, 2002 (“Claimant”) is a\n5\n\nclass member by reviewing the information provided by the claimant in the Settlement\nClaim Form and checking it against the electronic booking data used by Suffolk County\nwhich has been provided to plaintiffs’ counsel (“Data”).  This information will include the\nclaimant’s name, social security number, date of birth and any alias information. \n19.  If a claimant cannot be verified as a class member, the claims administrator\nwill send a Notice of Claim Denial to the claimant within 14 days of the deadline for\nsubmitting Settlement Claim Forms.  A copy of the notice is attached as Exhibit D.  Any\nclaimant who disagrees with the determination that she is not a class member may appeal\nto a special master to be appointed by the Court within 14 days from the date the claims\nadministrator sends the claimant the Notice of Claim Denial.  The claimant must submit\na written statement with supporting documentary evidence which shows that the data is\nincorrect or incomplete.  The evidence may include a notarized letter from the County,\ncriminal offender’s record information (CORI), or certified court documents from the\ncriminal case.  The special master will make a determination of class membership within\n30 days of the claimant’s appeal of claim denial and will report his findings to the claims\nadministrator and class counsel.  Rulings by the special master shall be final and binding.\n20.  Rose King, attorney for Suffolk County, has also agreed to accept telephone\ncalls from claimants to verify the data.  If attorney King is able to verify that a claimant\nis a class member, she will forward the verified class member’s booking information to the\n6\n\nclaims administrator and class counsel.  The verified class member will need not appeal\nto the special master.\n21.  If claimant is verified as a class member, the claims administrator will\nidentify all of the class member’s booking admissions into the Jail during the class period\nby reviewing the name, Suffolk County unique identification number, social security\nnumber and date of birth of the class member.\n22.  To determine each participating class member’s share in the settlement, the\nclaims administrator will place the class member into one of four settlement categories in\naccordance with the Distribution Formula attached to and made part of this Settlement\nAgreement.  Each of the four settlement categories has received a point rating to determine\nthe pro rata settlement amount for each participating class member.  \n23.  A Notice of Claim Approval and Membership in a Settlement Category will\nbe sent by first class mail postage-prepaid to all participating class members at the address\nprovided by the class member on the Settlement Claim Form within 30 days of the\nCourt’s final approval of the settlement.  The notice will include the following:\na.  Membership in a settlement category.\nb.  An estimate of the disbursement amount for the settlement category.\nc.  The participating class member’s right to contest her membership in\nthe settlement category by appealing to a special master.\nA copy of the notice is attached as Exhibit E.\n7\n\n24.  A  participating  class  member  may  contest  the  determination  of her\nmembership  in  a  settlement  category  by  filing  an  appeal  with  the  special  master\npostmarked within 45 days from the date of mailing of the Notice of Claim Approval and\nMembership  in  a  Settlement  Category.    The  special  master  will  notify  the  claims\nadministrator and class counsel of those class members who have appealed.\n25.  To successfully contest the determination of her membership in a settlement\ncategory, a class member must move up at least one category (i.e, from category IV to\ncategory III, etc.).  If the error sought to be corrected would not change the claimant’s\ncategory, the appeal will be denied without a hearing.  If a participating class member\nunsuccessfully contests the determination of her membership in a settlement category, she\nwill be penalized by deducting 20% of the point rating she would otherwise have been\nentitled to.\n26.  The  special  master  will  decide  all  appeals  regarding  membership  in a\nsettlement category.   Within 15 days of the deadline for class members to file appeals,\nthe special master will notify those who appeal to appear at a hearing at a time and place\nand in a format determined by the special master.  All appeals will be resolved within 60\ndays of the deadline for class members to file appeals.  The special master’s decision will\nbe final and binding on all parties.\n8\n\n27.  The special master will report his decisions to the claims administrator and\nclass counsel.  The claims administrator will send notice to the class member of the special\nmaster’s final decision.\n28.  The  claims  administrator  will  make  a  final  calculation  of distribution\namounts in accordance with the Distribution Formula after all Settlement Claim Forms\nhave been submitted, the deadline for class members to appeal their membership in a\nsettlement category has passed and all appeals have been resolved.  \n29.  The settlement fund will be distributed among participating class members\n(after approval and payment of attorney’s fees, expenses and class member bonuses)\nwithin  30  days  after  the  claims  administrator  begins  to  make  final  calculation  of\ndistribution amounts.\n30.  Bonuses will be paid to compensate class representatives and class members\nwho spent time working with class counsel to achieve the settlement.  These checks will\nbe paid at the same time as payments to class members.  Class members will receive a\nbonus for each of the following activities as follows:\na.  Serving as a class representatives - $15,000.\nb.  Being the subject of a deposition - $5,000.\nc.  Being selected for a damages trial and preparing to testify - $4,000.\nd.  Providing  an  affidavit  in  support  of  the  plaintiffs’  motion for\nsummary judgment - $500.\n9\n\ne.  Speaking with newspaper, radio or television reporters about the case\nbefore the case was settled - $1,500.\nClass counsel will provide the class administrator with a list of class members who are\nentitled to bonuses.\n31.  Class counsel will request that the Court approve an attorney’s fee of 30%\nof the settlement amount with a partial payment of attorney’s fees to be paid within 30\ndays of the Court granting final approval of the settlement and with the remainder to be\npaid on the day the settlement fund is distributed to class members. \n32.  Expenses, including the cost of the claims administrator, the special master\nand other costs of administration of this settlement, will be paid from the settlement fund\nsubject to approval by the Court.  Class counsel will provide an itemization of all expenses\nfor approval by the Court on the day the special master resolves all appeals.\n33.  The claims administrator will make distributions from the settlement fund\nto all participating class members within 30 days after the claims administrator begins to\nmake the final determination of settlement fund distribution amounts.  The settlement\nchecks will be made payable only in the name of the participating class member and will\nbe sent to the address provided by the participating class member on the Settlement Claim\nForm.\n34.  If a participating class member does not provide a mailing address or if the\nsettlement check is returned as undeliverable, the class member will be required to appear\n10\n\nin person before the special master at a time and place determined by the special master\nto present verification of her identity in order to receive her settlement check. \n35.  Participating class members who make a personal appearance must present\none of the following forms of identification to establish their identity: (a) a driver’s license\nor  a  state  identification  card,  (b)  a  passport  or  a  green  card,  or  (c)  some  other\nphotographic identification card not readily subject to forgery such as a military or student\nidentification card.  Other forms of reliable identification may be considered by the special\nmaster.\n36.  If a participating class member is deceased at the time of the distribution of\nsettlement funds, the settlement check will be sent to the class member’s estate if an\nexecutor or administrator has been appointed in accordance with law. Payments will not\nbe made to agents of participating class members other than court appointed legal\nrepresentatives.  The representative must provide the necessary documentation to the\nclaims administrator.\n37.  A participating class member who is confined in a prison, hospital or other\ninstitution and who has provided an address for such an institution for payment, will be\nsent payment to that address.\n38.  If any settlement check to a participating class member is not cashed or is\nnot claimed, it will be sent to the State Treasury in accordance with the Massachusetts\nAbandoned Property Act so that the participating class member may claim it in the future.\n11\n\n39.  The claims administrator will prepare all necessary tax forms relating to the\nsettlement fund account and 1099's for class members who received a settlement check\nwithin 6 months of making distributions from the settlement fund. \n40.   The claims administrator will provide a  report to  the Court and counsel for\nall parties accounting for the distribution of the settlement fund including attorney’s fees\nand expenses. \n41.  Class counsel shall make final payment to the claims administrator within\n30 days after the claims administrator completes the administration of the settlement for\nfees and expenses not already paid in administrating the settlement.\n42.  Any deadlines or other dates in this Settlement Agreement may be changed\nby the Court on a showing of good cause. \nV.  RELEASE\n43.  In exchange for payment of the settlement amount, the defendants will be\nreleased from liability for the strip-searches of class members at the Nashua Street Jail that\nwere part of this law suit unless the class member exercised her right to be excluded from\nthis class action.\nVI.  SUPERVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT\n44.  The Court shall retain jurisdiction over the settlement of this case and may\nenter orders as appropriate to enforce the settlement, to adjudicate  the rights and\n12\n\nresponsibilities of the parties and to effectuate the fair and orderly administration of the\nsettlement.\nFor the plaintiffs,\nBy their attorneys,\n______________________________\nHoward Friedman\nBBO #180080\nMyong J.

The Court FURTHER AUTHORIZES a second distribution to class \nmembers once the County pays. \n1.  The Court directs that the first distribution pay class member awards, \ncourt-approved bonuses, attorney's fees, and administrative expenses as follows: \na.  The Claims Administrator will pay each class member one-half of \nwhat the Claims Administrator estimates she would have received, \nunder the Settlement Agreement and Distribution Formula, if the \nsettlement had been consummated on schedule and on the budget \ndeveloped  with  class  counsel;  i.e.,  without  yet  accounting  for \nq\\ \n\ninterest, which will be paid in the second distribution. \nb.

The Claims Administrator and Special Master will be paid, subject \nto the court's approval, for fees and expenses. \n2.  The Court directs  that the second distribution be made after Suffolk \nCounty pays its $5 million and interest.

The Claims Administrator and Special Master will be paid, subject \nto the court's approval, for incurred fees and expenses. \nb.  The  Claims Administrator will  set aside,  subject to the court's \napproval, a portion of the settlement account's funds sufficient to \npay for anticipated fees and expenses. \nc.  The Claims Administrator will reimburse class counsel for litigation \nexpenses, subject to the court's approval. \n2 \n\nd.

The Settlement Agreement in this case provides:  \nThe settlement amount and any interest earned in the settlement fund\naccount until the date of distribution shall belong to the plaintiffs.  If there is\nany balance in the settlement fund account from additional interest earned\nafter all of the settlement checks have been distributed and all expenses,\nbonuses and attorney’s fees have been paid, the plaintiff will petition the\nCourt for instructions on the distribution of the remaining funds.\nSettlement Agreement at ¶12. The agreement also provides this Court with the power\nto make any orders necessary to enforce the settlement agreement. ¶ 44. Counsel for the\nclass recommends that this money go to MCLS, consistent with the cy pres doctrine\nwhich is used by courts to direct distribution of funds remaining in a class action.1\n1 A Memorandum of Understanding between plaintiffs’ counsel and MCLS is attached\nto this memorandum. \n\nMCLS is a non-profit corporation that provides legal services to prisoners.\nFounded in 1972, MCLS was established to provide legal and civil services to people in\nMassachusetts jails and prisons. MCLS is supported through government contracts,\ngrants and private donations.\n The cy pres doctrine allows for excess and unclaimed funds from a class action\nsettlement to be disbursed to a charitable organization at the direction and under the\nsupervision of the court. Under the cy pres doctrine, the funds should be used to benefit\nthe “next best class.” Democratic Central Committee of the District of Columbia\nv..Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission, 84 F.3d 451 (D.C. Cir.1996)\n(current bus riders found to be the next best class); In Re Three Mile Island Litigation\n557 F. Supp 96 (M.D. Pa. 1992) (payment made to newly formed foundation to study\nthe biological effects of radiation exposures from a nuclear plant accident). The National\nAssociation of Consumer Advocates Guideline for plaintiff’s lawyers on cy pres states:\nclass counsel should propose a disposition of the unclaimed portion of the\naward that will either (1) protect the interests of the persons injured by the\nillegal conduct and thus indirectly benefit absent class members or (2)\npromote the purposes of the statutory prohibitions sought to be enforced\nin the underlying litigation.\n“Standards and Guidelines for Litigating and Settling Consumer Class Actions,” 176\nF.R.D. 375, 393 (1997). Because this was a §1983 case on behalf of women in custody,\nit is most appropriate that the funds be used to protect the constitutional rights of\nwomen in prison in Massachusetts.\n2\n\nUnder the Memorandum of Understanding, the funds will be used to further\nMCLS’s current advocacy on behalf of women prisoners. MCLS will also receive cy pres\nmoney from another class action which it will use to investigate potential areas of\nlitigation and of advocacy for prisoners at MCI -Framingham. The funds from this case\nwill be used to implement the recommendations by litigation if necessary.  \n Incarcerated women suffer from a disproportionate rate of physical and mental\nillness. Initiatives for formulating and implementing sufficient programming, counseling\nand medical care for the female prison population are underfunded and generally\nunsupported compared to men’s institutions. See 12 A.L.R. 4th 1219 §3. Due to the lack\nof funding for medical screening, preventative care and treatment, many incarcerated\nwomen have unwillingly and prematurely surrendered their lives to cervical and breast\ncancer. Kendra D. Arnold, Note, The Right to Live: A Constitutional Argument for Mandatory\nPreventative Health Care for Female Prisoners, 10 Wm. & Mary J. Women & L. 343, 343\n(2004). Incarcerated women are also more susceptible than the general population to\nHIV, Hepatitis C, and reproductive diseases. Cynthia Chandler, Articles, Death and\nDying in America: The Prison Industrial Complex’s Impact on Women’s Health, 18 Berkeley\nWomen’s L.J. 40, 42 (2003). Furthermore, studies show that a significantly high number\nof women who have been incarcerated are victims and survivors of male violence such\nas rape, incest or domestic violence and often times have chemical dependencies for\nillegal drugs or alcohol. Despite an overwhelming need for women’s correctional facilities\nto provide health care, programming, child-care or parenting assistance, substance abuse\n3\n\ncounseling and mental health counseling, prison administrations have neglected the area.\nResearch by MCLS conducted with the aid of these funds may allow the organization\nto focus attention on these issues and help incarcerated women in this state.\nBy distributing the remaining settlement funds to MCLS, this Court is both\ncomplying with the terms of the Settlement Agreement and assuring that the funds will\nbe  used  to  promote  respect  for  the  constitutional  rights  of  women  prisoners  in\nMassachusetts. Since many of the class members in this case were held at MCI-\nFramingham, the funds will serve to benefit members of the class.\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,\nThe plaintiffs\nBy their attorneys,\n/s/ Howard Friedman\n________________________________\nHoward Friedman\nBBO #180080\nMyong J.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS \n) \nKATRINA MACK, et al., on behalf of  ) \nthemselves and others similarly situated,  ) \nPlaintiffs  ) \n)  Civil Action No. 98-12511-NG \nv.  ) \n) \nSUFFOLK COUNTY, et aI.,  ) \nDefendants  ) \n----------------------------) \nMEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS' MOTION \nTO HOLD SUFFOLK COUNTY IN CONTEMPT \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs ask this court to hold Suffolk County in contempt of the court's order \nof February 26,2003. Plaintiffs ask the court to fine the County for each day that it fails \nto comply with the order. Plaintiffs suggest a fine beginning at $3,000 per calendar day \nwith the amount of the daily fine increasing by $1 ,000 each subsequent Monday until \nthe  County complies with  this  court's order.  The plaintiffs  propose that the fines \ncollected  be  used  to  establish a  fund  for  the benefit of Suffolk County's women \nprisoners. \nPlaintiffs request the fine to motivate the County to pay without disrupting the \nCounty's operations. But this order would put the County and its officials on notice that \nif the County remains in contempt, further sanctions may be imposed, such as  the \nseizure of county property or an order directing the county treasurer to make payment \n\nfrom the county's operating accounts. Measures beyond a fine would be a last resort \nbecause they could impair the County's ability to run the jail and prison. The requested \nfine is  consistent with the equity court's obligation to use the \"least possible power \nadequate to the end proposed.\" Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 276 (1990). \nLikewise, plaintiffs do not seek a finding of contempt against county officials at this \ntime, but if the County's obstreperous behavior persists, such a motion might become \nnecessary. See Spallone. \nII.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \nThis civil rights class action suit settled after mediation by Senior District Judge \nA. David Mazzone on May 30,2002. Over the next month, class counsel negotiated the \nterms of the Settlement Agreement with counsel for the City and County. The parties \nagreed that the defendants would each pay $5 million by September 6, 2002. Because \ncounsel for the County were concerned they might need more time, the County agreed \nto make its \"best effort\" to pay by the September 6 deadline, but the agreement gave the \nCounty a grace period of seven weeks before it would \"in any event\" make its payment \nby November 29,2002. The parties agreed that if either defendant failed to pay its share \nby November 29, it would pay interest from that date forward.l \nOn July 1,2002, General Counsel Melissa Garand reported to class counsel that \nthe Commonwealth's Executive Office of Administration and Finance was committed \nI See Affidavit of Howard Friedman at ~~2-3. \n2 \n\nto paying the $5 million and that the money would be put in the supplemental budget \nfor 2002. Attorney Garand hoped that this would be accomplished by the end of July \n2002 but could not give class counsel a firm date. The Settlement Agreement was signed \non July 8, 2002.2 \nThe court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on July 10,2002. Based \non the agreed dates class counsel and the claims administrator developed a timewline for \nadministrating the settlement and mailed notice of the settlement to class members on \nJuly  22,  2002.  The court  held a fairness  hearing on September 26,  2002, on the \nassented-to motion to give final approval to the settlement. The County did not raise \nany objections to approval of the settlement. This court granted final  approval on \nOctober I, 2002.3 \nClass counsel and the defendant City of Boston took the steps necessary to \nconsummate  the  settlement  and  to  ensure  that  the  settlement  funds  would  be \ndistributed on time. Only the County failed to fulfill its settlement obligations. On \nNovember 18, 2002, class counsel wrote to remind the County that its payment was due \non November 29,2002, and that after that date interest would accrue at a rate of about \n$50,000 a month. On January 14, 2003, class counsel wrote to the County seeking \npayment by February 28,2003. Class counsel informed the County that if the County \n2 See Affidavit of Howard Friedman at 11114~ 5. \n3 See Affidavit of Howard Friedman at 11116~8. \n3 \n\ndid not guarantee payment by February 28,2003, the plaintiffs would file a motion to \nenforce the settlement at the beginning of February. On January 24,2003, counsel for \nthe County told class counsel that the plaintiffs would need to file the motion to secure \npayment.4 \nOn February 3, 2003, plaintiffs filed  a motion to enforce the settlement. In \nresponse to the motion, on February 24, 2003, the County acknowledged its obligation \nbut claimed that the County does not have the money to pay the amount it agreed to \npay. The County did not explain what steps it took to comply with the Settlement \nAgreement. On February 26,2003, the court ordered the County to pay the $5 million \nand accrued interest \"forthwith.\" On March 4, 2003, class counsel reported the court's \norder to Assistant General Counsel James Davin by telephone and faxed a copy of the \ndocket sheet. 5 \nOn March 5, 2003, the Sheriff's General Counsel Anne Powers forwarded the \ncourt's order to the County commissioners with copies to other County officials \"for \nresolution.\" On March 6, 2003, the County commissioners responded by reminding the \nGeneral Counsel that the County's budget is set by the County Government Finance \nReview Board suggesting that the order be referred there.6 \nSee Affidavit of Howard Friedman at 11119-12. \n4 \nSee Affidavit of Howard Friedman at 111113-14. \n5 \nSee Affidavit of Howard Friedman at 111115-16. \n6 \n4 \n\nThe  County's failure  to pay on time  prevents  complete  distribution of the \nsettlement funds  as  planned. A timetable was  established and class  members were \nnotified based on the County's promise to pay by November 29, 2002. The claims \nadministrator expects, by the end of March 2003, to have finished processing all claims \nand appeals (including those claims that were permitted to be filed late by the court) and \nto be ready to distribute settlement funds. The County's failure to make its payment is \nthe only cause for delay in distributing the settlement funds. 7 \nClass members are expecting to receive the promised settlement funds soon. Many \nof these women need the money.8 To minimize their harm, class counsel will shortly \nmake a separate motion for permission to make partial distributions from the City's \npayment. \nIII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  This Court Has the Power to Enforce the Agreement \nThis court has the power to secure the County's compliance with this class action \nsettlement for several reasons. First, the settlement agreement explicitly provides that \nthe court will have the power to \"enter orders as appropriate to enforce the settlement.\" \nSecond, when parties voluntarily enter into a settlement agreement, the agreement \ncannot  be  repudiated  by either  party,  and  the  court will  summarily  enforce  the \nSee Affidavit of Howard Friedman at 'U 17. \n7 \n8 See Affidavit of Howard Friedman at 'UIB. \n5 \n\nagreement. In re Mal De Mer Fisheries, 884 F.Supp. 635 (D.Mass. 1995); Mathewson \nCorp. v. Allied Marine Indus.! Inc., 827 F.2d 850, 852-53 (l  Cir.  1987); Malave v. \nst \nCarney Hospital, 170 F.3d 217, 220 (1  Cir. 1999); Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., \nst \n511  U.S. 375, 381  (1994). Federal courts have enforcement jurisdiction so that each \ncourt may \"function successfully, that is  ... manage its proceedings, vindicate its \nauthority, and effectuate its decrees.\" U.S.I.  Properties Corp. v.  M.D. Construction \nCompany, 230 F.3d 489,496  Cir. 2000) quoting Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 380. \n(lst \nFinally, given its supervisory role over the settlement of class actions, this court \nhas an even stronger obligation to ensure the settlement is completed. \"In a class action, \nthe district court has a duty to class members to see that any settlement it approves is \ncompleted, and not merely to approve a promise ... to pay the relief to which it has \ndecided class members are entitled.\" In re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation, \n752 F.2d 137,141 (5th Cir.1985). \nB.  The County Has Violated a Court Order \nJust as Suffolk County flouted its obligations under the settlement agreement, it \nhas disregarded the court's order. The County agreed to make its \"best efforts\" to pay \nthe settlement amount by September 6,2002, and \"in any event\" to pay by November \n29,2002. But, the County has not made a payment. Instead it seems the County waited \nfor a motion to enforce the settlement before trying to secure the needed money. \nOn February 26,2003, this court ordered Suffolk County pay the $5 million plus \naccrued  interest  \"forthwith.\"  This  was  the  least  intrusive  mechanism  to  secure \n6 \n\ncompliance  with  the  Settlement  Agreement.  The  Sheriff's  Department,  which \nthroughout this long litigation has been representing the County, responded by sending \nthe court order to the County's commissioners. The commissioners referred the matter \nback to the Sheriff's Department, claiming that it had not followed proper procedure. \nOnly now is the County planning a meeting for officials to discuss this matter-which \nthey should have done before the County signed the agreement on July 8,2002. \nTwenty days after the court commanded payment \"forthwith,\" the County has \nstill not paid. Because the County did not comply with the court order, this court should \nhold the County in contempt and order the County to pay a fine until it complies. \nC.  Contempt Is the Proper Remedy \nCourts have broad discretion in holding a party to be in civil contempt and in \nimposing a sanction for the contempt. AccuSoft Corporation v. Palo, 237 F .3d 31 (1 \nst \nCir. 2001). \"Courts have inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders \nthrough civil contempt.\" Spallone v. United States, 493 U.S. 265, 276 (1990), quoting \nShillitani v.  United  States,  384 U.S.  364  (1966).  The contempt sanction should \nrecognize the interest of local authorities in managing their own affairs. Id. \n\"Intent is not an issue in civil contempt proceedings. The sole question is whether \na party complied with the district court's order.\" Donovan v. Mazzola, 716 F.2d 1226, \n1240 (9th  Cir.  1983). Even good faith is  not a defense to civil contempt. Fortin v. \nCommissioner of Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare, 692 F.2d at 796. Civil \ncontempt can be justified by showing clear and convincing evidence that the party had \n7 \n\nnotice of the court's order and that the order was violated. AccuSoft Corporation v. Palo. \nIn this case, it is undisputed that the County had notice of the court's order to pay \n\"forthwith\" but has not paid. \nA finding of civil contempt and an increasing fine would help prevent further \nharm to class members' interests. Already, class members' settlement checks will be \ndelayed. A contempt ruling and fines should provide the necessary motivation to the \nCounty to make payment without further delay.  Giving the County more time, in \nexchange for yet another promise, would not likely result in compliance. \nD.  The County's Obligation Is Not Excused by its Failure to Take the \nNecessary Steps to Obtain Payment \nThe County may not be excused from its obligation by its failure to take the steps \nneeded to secure funds. Fortin v. Commissioner of Massachusetts Department of Public \nWelfare, 692 F.2d 790 798, n.9 (1  Cir. 1982). The County might argue that it cannot \nst \npay because it has not complied with state law requirements. For example, it might claim \nthat it does not have the approval of the County Government Finance Review Board or \nthat the funds have not been included in the County's budget. But the County has had \nnine months since it agreed to the settlement to take the steps needed for payment. The \nSettlement  Agreement  was  not  conditioned  on  securing  funding  from  the \nCommonwealth, nor did it specify that the payment would be made only from a specific \naccount. Before signing the Settlement Agreement and asking this court to approve the \nclass settlement, the County should have secured funding. The County's failure to take \n8 \n\nthe necessary steps months ago does not excuse its failure to comply with the court \norder. Were such an excuse a valid excuse, \"defendants could evade court orders simply \nby refusing to take preliminary steps toward compliance and claiming impossibility.\" Id. \nNeither maya government entity escape its responsibilities in a civil rights case \nby arguing that compliance violates state law. Hook v. Arizona, 907 F.Supp. 1326 (D. \nAriz. 1995) (failing to pay a court -appointed special master is not excused by an Arizona \nstatute that prohibits the payment of special masters appointed by a federal court). Nor \nmay the County be excused by protesting that compliance would result in a financial \ncrisis. Stone v. City and County of San Francisco, 968 F.2d 850, 858 (9th Cir. 1992). \nE.  A Fine of $3.000 per Day. Increasing Each Week. Is Proper \nA sanction to induce compliance with a court's order should take into account the \nprobable effectiveness of the sanction. Morales-Feliciano v. Parole Board of Puerto Rico, \n887 F.2d 1,  6 (lst Cir.  1989). Factors the court should consider in determining the \namount of the fine are: the magnitude of the harm threatened by future violations, the \nfine's probable effectiveness as a coercive sanction, and the financial burden it would \nimpose. Perfect Fit Industries v. Acme Quilting Company, 673 F.2d 53, 56-58 (2nd \nCir.1982); Princess House v. Iewels by Park Lane, 1991 WL 35495 (D. Mass. 1991). \nThe most important factor in this case is the sanction's probable effectiveness. \nThe County did not make its payment on time despite an interest provision requiring \nthat the County pay interest on its $5 million obligation at the rate of 12% per year \n9 \n\ncompounded daily, which equals approximately $50,000 per month.9 Since $50,000 a \nmonth was not large enough to move the County, the fine should start at an amount \nthat is larger. And to impress ever-increasing urgency, the amount of the fine should \nincrease regularly. Plaintiffs suggest that the fine begin at $3,000 per calendar day and \nthat each subsequent Monday the daily fine increase by $1,000.10 Such fines would be \nincurred in addition to the accruing interest. \nA daily fine against the City of Yonkers beginning at $100 a day and doubling \neach day of noncompliance though not to exceed $1 million a day was affirmed by the \nSupreme Court in Spallone, a case in which the defendant city had agreed to a judgment \nrequiring legislation but had then failed to pass the legislation. 493 U.S. 265 (1990). \nF.  The Fine Should Establish a Fund to Assist Women Prisoners \nFines for civil contempt may serve a coercive purpose, a compensatory purpose, \nor both. Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers' InternationalA<;sociation v. EEOC, 478 U.S. \n421,443 (1986). Because the participating class members will receive interest, the fine \nneed not be compensatory. Thus the requested fine would be primarily for coercing \ncompliance. Plaintiffs ask the court to use its equitable power to create a fund to benefit \nwomen incarcerated in the County's facilities. The many class members who did not \n9 See Attachment A: Calculation of Interest. \nThus each day of the second calendar week would cost $4,000, each day the third \n10 \ncalendar week would cost $5,000, and so on. If the court issued this order on, say, Monday, \nMarch 31, with the first fine's being incurred on Tuesday, April  I, then the fines would total \n$151,000 by May 1. See Attachment B: Sample Calculation of Fines. \n10 \n\nsubmit claim forms will not share in the class distribution. The proposed fund would \nbenefit some of these woman and many others in similar situations. The fund should be \nadministered by a non-profit group named by the court at a later date. \nPrecedent  supports  this  proposal.  In  Local  28  of  Sheet  Metal  Workers' \nInternational Association v.  EEOC, the Supreme Court affirmed a court's order that \n$150,000 in fines be used to finance a fund to increase minority membership in a union \napprenticeship  program  and  in the  union.  The  Sixth  Circuit  affirmed  the  use  of \ncontempt fines in a fund used for women inmates in a similar class action. Glover v. \nIohnson, 199 F.3d 310 (6th Cir. 1999). The First Circuit has also affirmed establishing \na fund from coercive sanctions to benefit plaintiffs. Cabrera v. Municipality of Bayamon, \n622 F.2d 4 (1  Cir. 1980). Other district courts have created funds used to benefit class \nst \nmembers generally. Palmigiano v. DiPrete, 710 F. Supp. 875 (D. R.I. 1989) aff'd, 887 \nF.2d 258 (lst Cir. 1989); Mobile County Inmates v. Purvis, 581 F.Supp. 222 (S.D. Ala. \n1984). Contempt fines have also been used to fund a special master and hearing master. \nHalderman v. Pennhurst State School and Hospital, 526 F.Supp. 423 (E.D. Pa. 1981). \nUsing the fines to aid women prisoners would, like this lawsuit, promote their humane \ntreatment. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nThis court should hold Suffolk County in  contempt of this court's order of \nFebruary 26,2003, and should order the County to pay a non-refundable fine beginning \n11 \n\nat $3,000 per calendar day, with the daily fine increasing by $1,000 each subsequent \nMonday, until the County pays the plaintiffs the settlement amount and interest. The \nfines collected should be used to establish a fund for the benefit of Suffolk County's \nwomen prisoners. \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \nFor the plaintiffs, \nBy1Tyl_-----., \nKoward Friedman \nBBO #180080 \nMyong J.

On December 5, 1996 Joanne Maniscalco was arrested outside the Fleet \nCenter in Boston for violation of a Boston ordinance against peddling without a license. \nShe had been selling  sausages from a cart.  She was taken to the Area A police station \nin Government Center.  She was booked at the police station. After she was held at the \npolice station for two to three hours Ms. Maniscalco was transported to the Suffolk \nCounty Jail on Nashua Street. \n13.  When Ms. Maniscalco was told she was to be searched she explained that \nshe was only arrested for selling sausages.  The correctional officer referred to here as \nJane  Doe 2 told the plaintiff that they search everyone.  Jane Doe 2  ordered Ms. \nManiscalco to take off all of her clothing.  She did so. The officer visually searched her \nbody.  Next Jane Doe 2 stood behind Ms. Maniscalco and ordered her to bend over and \nspread her cheeks.  Ms. Maniscalco did what she was required to do. \n14.  After the search Ms. Maniscalco was placed in a cell type room near the \nbooking area until she was released from custody.  The plaintiff felt that this search was \nhumiliating and degrading.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip \n\n4 \nsearch, Ms.  Maniscalco suffered and continues to suffer pain, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nChristine Daley \n15.  On September 22,1997 plaintiff Christine Daley was arrested in Boston and \ncharged with assault and battery.  She had been in an argument with a roommate.  Her \nroommate was arrested and charged with two counts of assault and battery with a \ndangerous weapon on Ms. Daley. \n16.  Ms. Daley was taken to the D-4 police station.  She was booked at the \npolice station. Mter being held at the police station for about an hour she was taken to \nthe Suffolk County Jail on Nashua Street.  At the jail Jane Doe 3 ordered Ms. Daley to \ntake off all of her clothing.  She complied.  Jane Doe 3 visually searched plaintiff's body. \nThen Jane Doe 3 stood behind Ms. Daley and ordered plaintiff to bend over and spread \nher cheeks.  She did as she was told. \n17.  Ms. Daley felt the strip search was humiliating and degrading.  As a result \nof the search she was upset and scared.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful \nstrip search,  Ms. Daley suffered and continues to suffer pain, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n18.  Ms. Daley was placed in a cell type room near the booking area.  She \nremained in this cell until she was released from the jail.  The charges against Ms. Daley \nwere ultimately dismissed. \n\n5 \nDenise Gasparini \n19.  Denise Gasparini was arrested by a Boston police officer on Dec. 7, 1998 \non a default warrant from the Somerville district court.  She was charged with larceny \nunder $250.00 based on the failure to return a rented  video game. \n20.  Ms. Gasparini was taken to the East Boston police station where she was \nbooked.  She was held at the police station for a couple of hours.  Then she was taken \nto the Suffolk County Jail on Nashua Street. \n21.  Jane Doe 4 brought Ms.  Gasparini into a room with a younger female \nprisoner.  Jane Doe 4 ordered the other prisoner to take off all of her clothing.  First the \ncorrectional officer conducted a strip and visual body cavity search of the other prisoner. \nThen Jane Doe 4 ordered Ms. Gasparini to remove her clothing.  The officer searched \nplaintiff's body.  Next the officer ordered plaintiff to bend over and spread her cheeks \nwhile Jane Doe 4 stood behind her. \n22.  Ms. Gasparini was shocked and scared as a result of the search.  She felt \nhumiliated and degraded.  The search was emotionally traumatic.  As a direct and \nproximate result of the unlawful strip search, Ms. Gasparini suffered and continues to \nsuffer pain, suffering and mental anguish. \nAlice Buckley \n23.  Alice Buckley was arrested without a warrant on the evening of June 16, \n1998 and charged with assault and battery.  She was held in a cell at the Area A police \nstation for five to six hours.  Finally she was taken to the Suffolk County Jail on Nashua \nStreet.  Jane Doe 5, a female correctional officer, took her into a room and ordered \n\n6 \nplaintiff to take off her clothing.  Plaintiff removed her clothing.  Jane Doe 5 required \nMs. Buckley to lift her breasts, bend over and spread her cheeks and lift her feet.  Ms. \nBuckley was scared during the search.  She had no idea what she might be ordered to do \nnext.  Ms. Buckley felt humiliated and violated. As a direct and proximate result of the \nunlawful strip search,  Ms. Buckley suffered and continues to suffer pain, suffering and \nmental anguish. \n24.  The charges against Ms. Buckley were ultimately dismissed. \nFacts Applicable to All Intervenors \n25.  There was no reason to suspect that any of the intervening plaintiffs had \na weapon or contraband hidden on her person. \n26.  Jane  Does  2-5  did  not  have  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  any of the \nintervening plaintiffs had a weapon or contraband hidden on her person. \n27.  The searches of each plaintiff by defendants Jane Doe 2-5 took place \nbecause of the written policy of the defendant Suffolk County, specifically, Sheriff's \nDepartment Policy Number S507.  This policy states that \"strip searches  shall be \nconducted of all inmates committed to the custody of the Department .... \"  The policy \nrequires a strip search of the nude body of every person \"at the time of each admission \nto the facility .... \"  The policy also requires that every female prisoner undergo a visual \nbody cavity search of the prisoner's anus and vagina. \n28.  The policy of the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department requires this search \nas a matter of routine, without any reason to suspect a strip search and visual body \ncavity search is necessary. \n\n7 \n29.  The policy of the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department applies regardless \nof the length of time the person is to be held or of the charges lodged against the person. \n30.  At the time of the incidents alleged in this complaint the Suffolk County \nSheriff's Department conducted a strip search and body cavity search of all women who \nwere  admitted to the  jail  including women who were waiting for  an initial  court \nappearance and women who were arrested on default warrants. \n31.  Each of the intervening plaintiffs was searched in the manner described \nabove because of the policy of the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department. \n32.  Rule 31BC of the Rules and Procedures of the Boston Police Department, \nrequires  that  all  female  prisoners  \"be  transported  to  the  Suffolk  County Jail  for \ndetainment.\"  Female prisoners are not held overnight at Boston Police stations. \n33.  When female prisoners arrive at the Suffolk County Jail on Nashua Street, \nthey are subjected to a routine strip search and visual body cavity search as described \nabove. \n34.  It is the policy of the Boston Police Department to hold male prisoners in \ncells at Boston Police stations until their first appearance in court. \n35.  Male prisoners who are held awaiting an initial court appearance or after \narrest on a default warrant in a Boston police station are not subjected to a routine strip \nsearch or body cavity search.  Male prisoners arrested in Boston are only strip searched \nif there is a reason to suspect the male prisoner has a weapon or contraband hidden on \nhis person. \n\n8 \n36.  If the intervening plaintiffs has been male, they would have remained in \ncustody in a Boston police station and they would not have been required to submit a \nroutine strip and visual body cavity search. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n37.  This action is brought pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b) (1), (2) and (3)  of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by plaintiff as a class action on behalf of all women \nwho, from December 10, 1995 forward,  were or who will in the future be: \na.  taken  into  custody  by  the  Boston  Police  Department and \ntransferred to the Suffolk County Jail pursuant to Boston Police \nDepartment rules regarding the custody of female prisoners to be \nheld pending a first court appearance, or after an arrest on a default \nwarrant; and \nb.  subjected to a routine strip search and visual body cavity search at \nthe Suffolk County Jail pursuant to the policy, practice or custom \nof the Suffolk County Sheriff. \n38.  The intervening plaintiffs are members of the class.  The class represented \nby the plaintiff is  so numerous that joinder of all such persons is  impractical.  On \ninformation and belief, the number of class  members is  more than three thousand \nwomen. \n39.  There are questions of law and fact which are common to the class of \nplaintiffs. Central to all the claims is the constitutionality of the policy or practice of the \nSuffolk County Sheriff to routinely conduct strip and visual body cavity searches and \nthe policy of the City of Boston of conducting routine strip and visual body cavity \nsearches of woman but not of men who are otherwise in a similar position. \n\n9 \n40.  Plaintiff-intervenors' claims or defenses are typical of the claims or defenses \nof the class of plaintiffs. \n41.  Plaintiff-intervenors will fairly and accurately represent and protect the \ninterests of the members of the class.  The attorney for the plaintiffs is experienced and \ncapable in civil rights litigation and has successfully represented plaintiffs in other civil \nrights  litigation including cases  alleging  unlawful  strip  searches.  Counsel  has  the \nresources and expertise to prosecute this action. \n42.  This  action  is  properly  maintained  as  a  class  action  because  the \nprosecutions of separate actions by the individual members of the class would create a \nrisk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \nclass, which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the defendants. \n43.  This  action  is  properly  maintainable  as  a  class  action  because  the \nprosecutions of separate actions would create a risk of adjudications with respect to \nindividual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the \ninterests of the other members who are not parties or substantially impair or impede \ntheir ability to protect their interests. \n44.  The defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class \nthereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or declaratory relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole. \n\n10 \n45.  As a direct result of policy class members have been subject to  unlawful \nstrip searches and visual body cavity searches which has caused each member of the class \nto endure  pain and suffering and mental anguish. \nFIRST COUNT: 42 U.S.C. § 1983: DEFENDANT SUFFOLK COUNTY \n46.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein. \n47.  The policy of the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department regarding strip \nsearches directs County employees to conduct searches that violate the United States \nConstitution. \n48.  By the actions  described above,  the defendant deprived the plaintiff \nintervenors of their clearly established right guaranteed by the Constitution of the \nUnited States to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure. \n49.  As  a  direct and proximate result of this  conduct, plaintiff-intervenors \nsuffered the injuries described above. \nSECOND COUNT: 42 U.S.C. § 1983: DEFENDANT RICHARD ROUSE \n50.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein. \n51.  Defendant Richard Rouse is the Sheriff and is the policymaker for the \nSuffolk County Jail. \n52.  Defendant Rouse implemented and maintained a policy of conducting \nstrip searches and visual body cavity searches of all persons who are admitted to the \nSuffolk County Jail,  regardless of the nature of charges or the circumstances of the \nindividual. \n\n11 \n53.  Defendant Rouse knew or should have known that the strip search policy \nat  the  Suffolk  County  Jail  would  result  in  correctional  officers  conducting \nunconstitutional searches of women who were being held for arraignment or pursuant \nto a default warrant. \n54.  Defendant Rouse established and enforced the policy of conducting routine \nstrip searches without any reason to believe the woman has anything concealed on her \nperson by implementing and maintaining the strip search policy. \n55.  As  a  result  of defendant  Rouse's  conduct,  plaintiff-intervenors  were \nsubjected to the search described above. \n56.  Even after defendant Rouse had actual knowledge that the policy of strip \nsearching women who were held for arraignment or pursuant to a default warrant was \nunconstitutional, he continued to enforce the policy. \n57.  Defendant Rouse acted with reckless indifference to the constitutional \nrights of women who are detained at the Suffolk County Jail as described above. \n58.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, the plaintiff-intervenors \nsuffered the injuries described above. \nTHIRD COUNT: 42 U.S.C. § 1983: DEFENDANT CITY OF BOSTON \n59.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein. \n60.  By requiring female prisoners awaiting an initial court appearance to be \nheld  at the  Suffolk County Jail,  it is  the  policy  or  custom  of the  Boston  Police \nDepartment to require women who are arrested and held in custody before their first \n\n12 \ncourt appearance to undergo a strip search and visual body cavity search while men in \nthe same circumstances are not required to undergo similar searches. \n61.  The strip search and visual body cavity search of all females awaiting an \ninitial court appearance is an affirmative policy of the Boston Police Department which \nviolates the right of women to the equal protection of law and violates the right of \nwomen under the Fourth Amendment to be  free  from  unreasonable  searches  and \nseizures. \n62.  As a direct and proximate result of the policies or customs of the City of \nBoston, the plaintiff-intervenors suffered the injuries described above. \nFOURTH COUNT: 42 U.S.C. §1983: DEFENDANTS DOE 2-5 \n63.  The above paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n64.  At all times relevant to this complaint, defendants Doe 2-5 were acting \nunder color of the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the County of \nSuffolk. \n65.  By the actions described in the preceding paragraphs, the correction officers \nreferred to as Jane Doe 2-5 deprived the plaintiff-intervenors of clearly established rights \nguaranteed  by  the  Constitution  of the  United  States  and  by  the  Massachusetts \nDeclaration of Rights including freedom from an unreasonable search and seizure and \nthe right to be treated equally under the law. \n66.

Garand, Rose E.\nKing, Assistant General Counsel, Boston, MA, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM RE: MOTION FOR RECUSAL\nGERTNER, District Judge.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis Memorandum addresses an important question in this age of close media coverage of judicial proceedings:\nwhether a district judge's statement to a reporter about a pending case creates an appearance of partiality that\nrequires recusal when the substance of the statement is already a matter of public record, widely reported in the\nmedia.\nTo be sure, the First Circuit has looked at the statement in question in connection with a recusal motion in an\nunrelated action, Boston's Children First v. City of Boston, Civil Action No. 99-11330-NG [hereinafter \"Boston's\nChildren\"]. In its decision In re Boston's Children First, 239 F.3d 59 (1st Cir.2001)modified,244 F.3d 164 (1st\nCir.2001) [hereinafter \"In re Boston's Children\"], it is clear that the Court has significant concerns about a judge's\nspeaking to the press about a pending case. But it is also clear that the opinion raises important questions\nconcerning how to evaluate the \"appearance of impartiality\" standard for recusal, after such a comment has been\nmade. This important and ongoing debate, however, does not affect the bottom line here: Whatever the standard,\nhowever broadly applied, this case is distinguishable.\nThis action involves a class of women plaintiffs (\"the plaintiffs\" or \"the plaintiff class\") allegedly strip-searched at\nthe Suffolk County Jail between December 10, 1995, and September 20, 1999, in violation of their constitutional\nrights. The case has been pending for nearly two years. In a published and widely reported decision released\nFebruary 16, 2000, this Court determined that the plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims. Mack v. Suffolk\nCounty, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D.Mass.2000) [hereinafter \"Mack\"]. The factual findings on standing were clear: This\nCourt found that the plaintiffs \"suffered a personal injury ... fairly traceable to defendant's allegedly unlawful\nconduct and ... likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" Id. at 19.\nOn August 3, 2000, I spoke to a newspaper reporter about the Boston's Children case. In a Boston Herald article\n[1]\nthe following day (\"the August 4 article\"),  I made the following statement contrasting the standing issues in the \nBoston's Children case and this one:\n\nIn [the instant] case, there was no issue as to whether [the plaintiffs] were injured. It was\nabsolutely clear every woman had a claim.... [Boston's Children] is a more complex case.\nNow, over six months after the article was published, the defendants (including the City of Boston, which took the\nopposite position in Boston's Children) suddenly argue that I am obliged to recuse myself, because the statement\nsomehow suggests the position the Court will take on the ultimate question 00 \"that the Defendants are liable for\n97\nthe act of strip-searching all of the [plaintiffs] and that every plaintiff was injured.\"\n118 *118 This characterization of the reported statement is untenable. What I said was identical to what I had\npreviously said in my published standing decision 00 in this case, \"there [is] no issue as to whether [the plaintiffs]\n97\nwere injured.\" Indeed, in the very next sentence, I make it clear that I am referring to the plaintiffs' \"claims,\" not to\nany damages they may ultimately receive. The statement forecasts absolutely nothing about future decisions.\nNo one familiar with the record of this case, or with the media coverage, could reasonably question my\nimpartiality based on this reiteration of publicly recited facts. If defendants' belated argument justifies recusal in a\ncase pending before me for two years, then the standard is truly overbroad.\nDefendants' motion for recusal [docket entry # 82] is therefore DENIED.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. The Boston's Children Action\nFor purposes of clarity, I begin by summarizing the procedural posture of the unrelated Boston's Children case, to\nwhich I referred in my controversial statement in the Boston Herald.\nIn that high-profile case, filed in mid-1999, the plaintiffs challenge the City of Boston's allegedly racially-\ndiscriminatory school assignment policies. On July 26, 2000, the Boston Herald published an article (\"the July 26\narticle\") detailing an interview with the plaintiffs' counsel, in which the counsel misrepresented the procedural\nposture of the case and made several provocative and unsubstantiated assertions, including alleging that this\nCourt had refused to hear class certification claims of white children in Boston's Children, while granting class\n[2]\ncertification to jailed women in the instant action.\nTo correct the inaccuracies in the July 26 article, I wrote a letter to the Boston Herald, dated July 28, 2000, with\ncopies to counsel. Subsequently, the Herald reporter called to inquire about the standing issues in Boston's\nChildren and in the present action. As reported in the August 4 article and quoted above, I responded:\nIn [the present] case, there was no issue as to whether [the plaintiffs] were injured. It was\n[3]\nabsolutely clear every woman had a claim.... This is a more complex case.\nBased on my letter and this comment, the Boston's Children plaintiffs filed a motion for recusal, claiming that my\n[4]\n\"impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"  Essentially, they argued that my comment somehow forecast\nthe position I would take on their class certification motions.\nI denied the motion after a hearing on the issue. Plaintiffs then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, again\nseeking recusal. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit granted the writ and denied my subsequent petition for\nrehearing or rehearing en banc. In re Boston's Children, 239 F.3d at 66.\nB. This Action\nThe procedural history of the instant case is very different. This action was filed in July 1998. On February 16,\n2000, I determined that the plaintiffs have standing to pursue their claims, and I certified the plaintiff class. Mack,\n[5]\n191 F.R.D. at 19-21. The decision was well covered in the press.\n119\n\n*119 In this standing decision, I found that all of the plaintiffs had demonstrated both (1) that they had suffered\npersonal injury \"fairly traceable to defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and ... likely to be redressed by the\nrequested relief\"; and (2) \"that, at the time the complaint was filed, a real and immediate threat of future injury\n[6]\nexisted.\" Id. at 19, 21.  The defendants apparently sought appellate review of my standing and class\ncertification decision, but the First Circuit denied their petition.\nSix months after the article was published, this motion was filed.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. The Recusal Standard\nThe defendants seek recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), which obliges any justice, judge, or magistrate of the\nUnited States to disqualify herself \"in any proceeding in which [her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"\n[7]\n This provision establishes an objective standard, mandating recusal only \"when the facts asserted `provide\nwhat an objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to be a reasonable basis for doubting the\njudge's impartiality.'\" In re Boston's Children, 239 F.3d at 62 (emphasis added) (citing In re United States, 666\nF.2d 690, 695 (1st Cir.1981)).\nAs indicated by the word \"knowledgeable,\" above, the § 455(a) standard requires that the \"facts asserted\" be\nevaluated from the perspective of an \"objective, disinterested observer fully informed of the underlying facts.\" \nUnited States v. Bayless, 201 F.3d 116, 126 (2d Cir.2000) (emphasis added) (quoting Diamondstone v. Macaluso,\n148 F.3d 113, 120-21 (2d Cir.1998) (internal citations omitted)); accord El Fenix de Puerto Rico v. M/Y\nJOHANNY, 36 F.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir.1994) (summarizing the § 455(a) test as, \"whether a reasonable person,\n`were he to know all the circumstances, would harbor doubts about the judge's impartiality'\" (citing Home\nPlacement Serv., Inc. v. Providence Journal Co., 739 F.2d 671, 675 (1st Cir. 1984))).\nThus, one must determine whether recusal is warranted \"`not by considering what a straw poll of the only partly\ninformed man-in-the-street would show[,] but by examining the record facts and the law, and then deciding\nwhether a reasonable person knowing and understanding all the relevant facts would recuse the judge.'\" Bayless,\n201 F.3d at 127 (quoting SEC v. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., 861 F.2d 1307, 1313 (2d Cir.1988) (internal\ncitations omitted)).\nB. The Defendants' Recusal Motion\nDefendants' recusal motion entirely fails to meet this objective, reasonable- and knowledgeable-person standard.\nThe nub of defendants' claim is that my August 4 comment implies that I have pre-judged their liability for the\n120 plaintiffs' injuries. *120 This interpretation is entirely unreasonable. Whatever questions one may have about the\nrecusal inquiry outlined by the First Circuit in In re Boston's Children case, it is clear that defendants' motion falls\nshort.\n1. The February 2000 Decision Conveys Precisely the Same Message\nas My Statement\nAnyone familiar with the record in this action knows that in February 2000, I issued a decision that recognizes\nplaintiffs' standing to pursue their claims for compensatory damages and injunctive relief. Mack, 191 F.R.D. at\n19-21. The opinion clearly indicates that a plaintiff seeking compensatory damages can only satisfy the standing\nrequirement \"by demonstrating that [she] ... suffered a [past] personal injury.\" As the defendants chose not to\nchallenge this aspect of plaintiffs' standing, the decision wastes little time in concluding that plaintiffs adequately\n[8]\ndemonstrated such injury.\n\nSo, defendants' belated recusal motion accuses me of repeating to a reporter the two facts that the February\n2000 decision had already established: that the plaintiffs \"were injured,\" and that \"every woman had a claim.\"\n2. The August 4 Article Only Addresses Plaintiffs' Standing, Not\nDefendants' Liability\nIn light of the February 2000 procedural ruling, no one familiar with the record in this case, or with press coverage\nsurrounding it could reasonably misconstrue my comment in the August 4 article as forecasting future decisions\nor indicating bias. The article focuses on questions of class certification and standing. It quotes the counsel for\nthe plaintiffs in Boston's Children as arguing that this Court should \"hear [the plaintiffs'] motion for class\n[9]\ncertification\" before holding a hearing on standing.  That approach, plaintiffs' counsel suggests, would comport\nwith the sequence followed in the instant action.\nThe meaning of my response is unmistakable: In Boston's Children, it would be inappropriate to address class\ncertification before standing, as I did in Mack because questions of standing are \"complex,\" whereas in the\npresent action, there is no \"issue as to whether [the plaintiffs] were injured.... [E]very woman ha[s] a claim.\"\nThis observation does not indicate bias. It is about standing, not substantive liability. It speaks the language of\npleadings 00 what the women's claims were 00 not the language of proof. Indeed, it reflects the defendants'\n97 97\nposition, that there was no meaningful contest about plaintiffs' \"claims\" of past injury.\n3. The February 2000 Standing Decision Was Widely Reported in the\nMedia\nEven if one were unfamiliar with the judicial record in this case and were entirely reliant on the media, one still\ncould not reasonably question my impartiality based on the comment in the August 4 article. Any reasonable\n[10]\nreader of the press would recognize that the comment simply restates the (well-reported ) conclusions I\nreached earlier regarding standing and class certification in this case.\n4. The Holding in In re Boston's Children Should Not be Applied Here\n121 One need not question the First Circuit's holding in In re Boston's Children to *121 reach a contrary decision\nregarding recusal in this case. In that case, the panel was apparently concerned that my use of the term \"more\ncomplex\" to describe the \"pending\" standing and class certification issues in Boston's Children could \"arguably\"\nbe interpreted to suggest \"that the petitioner's claims for certification and temporary injunctive relief were less\nthan meritorious.\" In re Boston's Children, 239 F.3d at 62-63.\nNo such misunderstanding could occur here. As of August 4, 2000, I had already published my standing and\nclass certification decision. No substantive motions were pending. My comment could not \"arguably\" be\ninterpreted to suggest anything except that the plaintiffs in this case have demonstrated injury 00 a factual finding I\n97\nhad already made on the record.\nFurther, the panel's decision in In re Boston's Children is expressly limited to the \"particular events in, and\ncharacter of, [that] highly idiosyncratic ... [and] newsworthy ... case,\" and the decision itself emphasizes that there\nis a \"continuing need for a case-by-case determination of [recusal] issues.\" Id. at 65, 66.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nEven if one agrees with the recusal standard announced in In re Boston's Children, and agrees that my\n[11]\nstatement in the August 4 article warrants recusal in the Boston's Children case,  and agrees that a judge\n\nshould always avoid comment on pending cases, the In re Boston's Children decision does not dictate the\noutcome here.\nTo hold that my recitation of previously-and publicly-established fact casts doubt on a judge's impartiality, thereby\nnecessitating recusal, would establish a judicial code of silence that reason cannot bear. Defendants' motion is\nDENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Dave Wedge, Race-Based Admissions Case to Be Heard, Boston Herald, August 4, 2000, available at 2000\nWL 4331739.\n[2] Dave Wedge, Lawyer Fights School Ruling; Claims White Kids Have Class-Action Rights, Boston Herald, July\n26, 2000, available at 2000 WL 4331012.\n[3]Supra note 1.\n[4] Plaintiffs base their recusal motion on 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), which provides, \"Any justice, judge, or magistrate of\nthe United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be\nquestioned.\"\n[5]E.g.

McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 111 S.Ct. 1661, 114 L.Ed.2d 49 (1991), in\nwhich the Supreme Court observed, \"[a]t the core of the standing doctrine is the requirement that a plaintiff\n`allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by\nthe requested relief.'\" Id. at 51, 111 S.Ct. 1661 (citing Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82\nL.Ed.2d 556 (1984)).\n[7] The defendants also cite Canon 3(A)(6) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, which instructs that a \"judge should\navoid public comment on the merits of a pending or impending action.\" As the First Circuit has \"indicated that the\nCode ... does not overlap perfectly with § 455(a),\" and that \"it is possible to violate the Code without creating an\nappearance of partiality ... [or] to comply with the Code yet still be required to recuse [oneself],\" I confine my\ndiscussion to the recusal standard set out in § 455(a). In re Boston's Children, 239 F.3d at 63.\n[8] The issue of prospective relief is more complex. A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must \"also demonstrate that\nshe is in real and immediate danger of sustaining future, direct injury as a result of official conduct ongoing at the\ntime of the suit.\" Id. at 19. On the truncated record presented at the class certification hearing, I determined that\nhere, too, the plaintiffs ultimately prevail. Id. at 20-21.\n[9]Supra note 1.\n[10]Supra note 6\n[11] The active judges on the First Circuit are apparently themselves divided regarding the appropriateness of the\npanel's decision in In re Boston's Children. 239 F.3d at 66 (\"Those active judges who are not members of the\npanel are currently of the view that, even if the district court's statement to the reporter comprised a comment on\nthe merits, it does not create an appearance of partiality such as to require mandatory recusal under 28 U.S.C. §\n455(a)\").\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe plaintiff, Bronwyn Ford (\"Ford\"), moves for attorneys'\nfees after having settled her claim against the City of Boston\nand the County of Suffolk, for their illegal strip search of her. \nThe litigation in this case was lead by counsel for the class in\nMack v. Suffolk County, et al. (98-12511), Howard Friedman.  The\nresults obtained in Ford depended almost entirely on the results\nof the class action litigation and the leverage it generated. \nPlaintiff's counsel in Mack, Mr. Friedman, shaped the arguments,\nwhich the Court accepted in substantial measure on summary\njudgment.  The outlines for the settlement were worked out by all\nof the parties in Mack with substantial and commendable effort.\nAnd once the outlines had been set, the settlement of the Ford\ncase should have followed.  It did not for the reasons described\nbelow.\n\nWhile the plaintiff's counsel plainly deserves a fee award\nof some amount, it is also plain that the amount requested is\nentirely excessive.\nA. Ford Litigation\nOn July 13, 1998, the plaintiff, Bronwyn Ford, filed a\ncomplaint against the Defendant City of Boston (hereinafter\n\"City\") for damages allegedly resulting from two strip-searches\nthat she claims she was subjected to after her arrest on a\ndefault warrant.  She brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nalleging violations of the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments of the United States Constitution and under the common\nlaw of Massachusetts.  She further claimed that the defendants\nwere deliberately indifferent to her medical needs while she was\nin custody, thereby violating the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth\nAmendments.  \nShortly thereafter, plaintiff filed an amended complaint,\nadding Suffolk County (hereinafter \"County\") and the Sheriff as\ndefendants. \nThe City moved to dismiss Count II of the complaint, as\nduplicative of plaintiff's section 1983 claim.  This motion was\ngranted on April 29, 1999.\nB. Mack Litigation\nOn March 27, 2000, both the plaintiff and the County filed\nmotions for summary judgment.  Rather than acting on the motions,\n-2-\n\nhowever, this Court consolidated the Ford case with a putative\nclass action raising identical issues, Mack v. Suffolk County, et\nal., U.S. Dist. Ct. 98-12511, on April 4, 2000.  The Mack\nlitigation had been filed on December 10, 1998.1\nFrom the outset, it was clear that counsel for Ford was\nworking with counsel for Mack.  Furthermore, the consolidation\norder consolidated both cases essentially under the leadership of\nAttorney Friedman, class counsel and an acknowledged expert in\ncivil rights litigation. \nOn November 15, 2000, the Mack plaintiffs moved for summary\njudgment.2  At the same time, Friedman filed a brief supporting\nFord's earlier filed motion for summary judgment.  \nOn July 31, 2001, the Court granted summary judgment to the\nMack class, in a broad-ranging decision, declaring the County's\nsearch policies during the class period to be facially\nunconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.  See Ford v. City of\nBoston, 154 F. Supp.2d 131 (D. Mass. 2001).  Both the City and\nthe County were found also liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the\nstrip searches of women charged with felonies and misdemeanors\nnot involving drugs or guns, and for women arrested on default\nwarrants for such offenses.  Defendant Sheriff Rouse was found to\n1 The Mack class had been certified on February 16, 2000.  See Mack v.\nSuffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16 (D. Mass. 2000). Ford had specifically opted out\nof the class.  \n2 The plaintiffs in Mack were consolidated into Ford.  Any reference to\nthe Mack plaintiffs, class, or litigation refers to the class action\nplaintiffs in the Ford case.\n-3-\n\nhave qualified immunity for his actions during part of the\nrelevant period, and not to be immune for the remainder.  \nThe outcome of the decision in Ford, the action by the\nindividual Bronwyn Ford, was shaped directly by the decision for\nthe Mack plaintiffs.  See Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F. Supp.2d\n123, 125 (D. Mass. 2001).3  All damages questions in both cases\nwere to be resolved at a future proceeding.\nImmediately thereafter, settlement discussions began as\nbetween the Mack plaintiffs and the City.  Not surprisingly, the\nCity would not even address the settlement with Ford, until the\nclass action was resolved.  Ford presented substantially the same\nset of circumstances as many individuals in the then certified\nclass action.  \nThe City, in fact, proposed that action in Ford's case be\nsuspended entirely, to allow a final determination regarding the\nMack plaintiffs.  Again, the suggestion made perfect sense, but\ncounsel for Ford refused, serving a request for admissions, and\nthen a second.  The Court stepped in, allowing the City's motion\nfor a protective order, relieving it of the obligation to answer\ndiscovery requests. \n3 In addition, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the County\ndefendants as to their alleged deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's\nmedical needs and dismissed the claims against defendant Rouse.\n-4-\n\nIn June of 2002, the parties in Ford attempted mediation,\nwhich failed.4  But the mediation of the Mack case proceeded\napace, and by June 17, 2002, those efforts produced an omnibus\nsettlement for all class members.  By October 1, 2002, Ford\nsettled as well, leaving attorneys' fees for future litigation.\nII. LEGAL ANALYSIS\nA. Appropriateness of Fee Award\nThe Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Awards Act of l976\nauthorizes the district court to allow the prevailing party in\n4 Defendants claim that mediation failed solely due to the amount of\nattorneys' fees that counsel in Ford was requesting.  Plaintiff does not deny\nthe characterization.  Rather, counsel for plaintiff claims that I should\nstrike any reference to the content of settlement discussions under Rule 408\nof the Federal Rules of Evidence which precludes evidence of a settlement\noffer \"to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount.\"\nHowever, Rule 408 specifically states that it \"does not require exclusion when\nthe evidence is offered for another purpose . . . .\"  As one court has\nspecifically held:\nWhile determining the reasonableness of a claim for\nattorney's fees is not specifically mentioned as a\npurpose for which evidence of a settlement offer may\nbe considered, strong public policy considerations\nsupport its admissibility for that purpose.  See\ngenerally Abeshouse v. Ultragraphics, Inc., 754 F.2d\n467, 473 (2d Cir.1985) (finding no abuse of discretion\nwhere infringer's 'diligent' settlement efforts were\nfactored into district court's refusal to award\nattorney's fees against infringer).  Settlements are\nto be encouraged and a party to an action in which\nattorney's fees may be awarded should not be allowed\nto believe that it can reject a reasonable settlement\noffer and still recover the full amount of its\nattorney's fees if ultimately it recovers little more\nthan the original offer.  Moreover, litigation is not\na weapon to punish an adversary and one who makes a\ntotally unreasonable settlement demand should not be\nrewarded at the end of the litigation with a generous\naward of counsel fees.  \nGreenwich Film Prod., S.A. v. DRG Records, Inc., 1996 WL 502336,\n*2 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). \n-5-\n\nany Civil Rights Act suit “a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of\nthe costs.”  42 U.S.C. § 1988.  A plaintiff prevails if he has\nsucceeded on “'any significant issue in litigation which\nachieve[d] some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing the\nsuit.’”  Texas State Teachers Ass'n. v. Garland Indep. Sch.\nDist., 489 U.S. 782, 791-92 (1989) (quoting Nadeau v. Helgemoe,\n581 F.2d 275, 278-279 (1st Cir. 1978)). \nAlthough the case has settled, and this Court found the City\nand County liable to Ford, the settlement occurred as a result of\nFriedman's efforts in the Mack litigation, on which Ford\npiggybacked.  For example, the plaintiff never made a claim for\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause in her complaint.  The\nfirst time she did so was in a her motion for summary judgment --\none paragraph, no citations to case law.  She did so only after\nthe Mack plaintiffs claimed Fourteenth Amendment violations.  And\nas to the claims that she alone litigated, the majority were\ndenied. \nWhile some fee award may be appropriate, it is surely not\nappropriate in the amounts that plaintiff's counsel seeks.\nB. Framework for Analysis\nEssentially, the amount for attorneys' fees is determined by\na two-pronged test.  First, the calculation of the “lodestar\nfigure” which is the number of hours reasonably expended\nmultiplied by the applicable hourly market rate for legal\nservices.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983).  The\n-6-\n\nsecond is an upward or downward adjustment “to account for\nexceptional circumstances.”  Rogers v. Motta, 655 F. Supp. 39, 43\n(D. Mass. 1986).  One factor in determining exceptional\ncircumstances is plaintiff's success or lack of success in the\nlitigation.  Id.\n1. The Lodestar Amount\na. Reasonable Rate\nA reasonable rate is measured by comparing counsel’s regular\nrates with those of the marketplace.5  \nPlaintiff requests hourly rates ranging from $175 in 1997 to\n$250 in 2002.  Attorney Klein graduated from law school in 1995,\n5 As the Supreme Court noted, \nWe recognize, of course, that determining an\nappropriate \"market rate\" for the services of a lawyer\nis inherently difficult.  Market prices of commodities\nand most services are determined by supply and demand.\nIn this traditional sense there is no such thing as a\nprevailing market rate for the service of lawyers in a\nparticular community.  The type of services rendered\nby lawyers, as well as their experience, skill and\nreputation, varies extensively -- even within a law\nfirm.  Accordingly, the hourly rates of lawyers in\nprivate practice also vary widely.  The fees charged\noften are based on the product of hours devoted to the\nrepresentation multiplied by the lawyer's customary\nrate.  But the fee usually is discussed with the\nclient, may be negotiated, and it is the client who\npays whether he wins or loses.  The § 1988 fee\ndetermination is made by the court in an entirely\ndifferent setting: there is no negotiation or even\ndiscussion with the prevailing client, as the fee --\nfound to be reasonable by the court -- is paid by the\nlosing party.  Nevertheless, as shown in the text\nabove, the critical inquiry in determining\nreasonableness is now generally recognized as the\nappropriate hourly rate.  And the rates charged in\nprivate representations may afford relevant\ncomparisons. \nBlum v. Stenson, 465 U.S.886, 895 n.11 (1984).\n-7-\n\nonly three years before the litigation commenced; Attorney Samit\nin 199l.  Neither practiced in the police litigation area or,\nmore broadly, civil rights law (as contrasted with Attorney\nFriedman who is an expert). (Indeed, for part of the period of\ntime requested, they have sought fees at a rate even higher than\nthat of Attorney Friedman.)  They have not remotely justified the\nrates they have sought, either through the decisions of other\ncourts awarding them fees, or through the expert opinions of\nother counsel with respect to their work.\nAccordingly, I have reduced the hourly rate for Mr. Klein\nand Mr. Samit for core hours to a range of $125 to $200, and $60\nper hour for non-core hours.\n2. Number of Hours\nA lawyer is supposed to exercise billing judgment in \napplying for fees.  The Court is to exclude from the fee\ncalculation hours that were not reasonably expended, including\nhours that were \"excessive, redundant or otherwise unnecessary.\" \nHensley, 46l U.S. at 434.  A lawyer is to provide detailed and\ncontemporaneous time records.\nCritical to this petition is whether the hours upon hours\nexpended by counsel for Ford were remotely reasonable given the\nfact that Friedman was the lead attorney, doing the lion's share\nof work for the class.  At the very minimum, time expended after\nAugust 30, 2001, should be struck.  On that date, the City\nappropriately offered to stay the Ford case until the Mack case\n-8-\n\nhad been resolved.  Counsel had assured Ford's counsel that the\nFord case would be negotiated after Mack. \nWith respect to time before August 30, 2001, it is\nreasonable to distinguish between \"core\" and \"non-core\" work. \nCiulla v. Rigny, 89 F.Supp.2d 97, 104-105 (D. Mass. 2000).  Core\nwork involves legal research, etc.; non-core work is less\ndemanding tasks, like letter-writing and telephone calls.  This\nis particularly significant in the instant case, where so much of\nthe \"core\" time was spent replicating the work of Mack counsel. \n3. Degree of Success\nThere is no question that plaintiff Ford succeeded on some\ncounts.  She succeeded on a Fourth Amendment strip search claim\nand on a claim she did not raise -- a violation of equal\nprotection.  Yet it is also abundantly clear that this success\nwas mainly due to the efforts of counsel in Mack.  The scope of\nthe Mack case was such that many, if not all, of the issues in\nFord were folded within its litigation. While it was important\nfor counsel for Ford to protect their client's interests, and\nthey should be compensated for that, it is not at all clear that\nwork required anywhere near the time that was expended.  \nUnder the circumstances, the petition is plainly\nunreasonable in relation to the results obtained. \nIII. CONCLUSION\n-9-\n\nAccordingly, I AWARD Eighteen Thousand, Eight Hundred\nSixteen And 50/100 ($18,816.50) Dollars, in toto, for Attorneys'\nFees to Plaintiff.

This is a civil rights action for money damages against Suffolk County, \nSuffolk County Sheriff Richard Rouse, correctional officer Jane Doe, and the City of \nBoston, for injuries caused by the unconstitutional strip search of the plaintiffs. \n2.  The named plaintiff, Katrina Mack, seeks to represent a class of all women \nwho were admitted to the Suffolk County Jail while waiting for bail to be set or for an \ninitial court appearance, women who are arrested on default warrants, and women who \nare held in protective custody.  Included in this class are women who have been taken \ninto custody by the Boston Police Department, the MBTA Police Departme \n\n2 \nMassachusetts  State  Police  and  the  police  departments  of  Chelsea,  Revere  and \nWinthrop.  These women have all been unlawfully subjected to routine strip searches \nand routine visual body cavity searches due to a formal written policy implemented by \nthe  Suffolk County Sheriffs  Department that states  that \"strip  searches  shall  be \nconducted of all inmates committed to the custody of the Department .... \"  The policy \nrequires a strip search of the nude body of every person \"at the time of each admission \nto the facility .... \" The policy also requires a visual body cavity inspection of a prisoner's \nanus and vagina. These searches are conducted routinely, without any reason to suspect \na strip search or a visual body cavity search is necessary. \n3.  The City of Boston is sued for violating the constitutional rights of women \nbecause,  under its policy,  all women who are held in custody overnight are  to be \nroutinely subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity search while men who are \nheld in custody overnight are not subject to such searches as a matter of routine. \n4.  Plaintiff seeks to have this Court declare that these routine searches are \nunconstitutional and to enjoin the defendants from conducting strip searches and visual \nbody cavity searches of women who are held awaiting their first court appearance for the \nsetting of bail, and women who are arrested on default warrants, and women who are \nheld in protective custody on the grounds that it violates their constitutional right to be \nfree  from  unreasonable searches  under both the Massachusetts and United States \nConstitutions. \n\n3 \nJURISDICTION \n5.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 and the \nFourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \nJurisdiction is founded upon 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and 1343. \nPARTIES \n6.  The named plaintiff,  Katrina Mack, was  at all  times  relevant to this \ncomplaint a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. \n7.  The  defendant  Suffolk  County  is  a  duly  designated  county in the \nCommonwealth  of  Massachusetts,  under  the  laws  of  the  Commonwealth  of \nMassachusetts. \n8.  The defendant Richard Rouse was at all times relevant to this complaint \nthe Sheriff of Suffolk County.  He is sued in his individual capacity.  The actions of \ndefendant Rouse alleged in this complaint were taken under color of law. \n9.  The defendant Jane Doe is  a correctional officer employed by Suffolk \nCounty.  She is sued in her individual capacity. \n10.  The actions of defendant Doe alleged in this complaint were taken under \ncolor of the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the County of Suffolk. \n11.  The defendant City of Boston is a duly organized municipal corporation \nin the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. \n\n4 \nFACTS \n12.  On March 5, 1998 at 1: 30 a.m. plaintiff Katrina Mack was arrested by a \nBoston police officer in the Charlestown section of Boston for driving while under the \ninfluence of intoxicating liquor and leaving the scene after causing property damage. \n13.  Ms. Mack was taken to the Area A Boston police station on New Chardon \nStreet in Boston. \n14.  Ms. Mack was booked, fingerprinted, frisked and placed in a cell with \nanother female prisoner. \n15.  At approximately 3:00 a.m., the plaintiff was told that it was too late for \nher to be released on  bail. \n16.  Plaintiff was then put in leg shackles, handcuffed and taken in a Boston \nPolice wagon to the Suffolk County Jail on Nashua Street. \n17.  When plaintiff arrived at the Suffolk County Jail, defendant Doe brought \nplaintiff to a room and ordered her to take off all of her clothing. \n18.  Ms. Mack protested but defendant Doe replied, \"You have to do this.\" \n19.  Ms. Mack began to cry.  She complied with the order and took off all her \nclothing.  Then defendant Doe searched plaintiffs clothing. \n20.  Defendant Doe next ordered plaintiff to face her, lift her arms up, turn \naround, bend over and spread her cheeks while defendant Doe conducted a visual body \ncavity search. \n\n5 \n21.  Defendant Doe had no reason to suspect that plaintiff had any weapons \nor contraband hidden on her person. \n22.  After the search, plaintiff was placed into a cell alone. \n23.  Later in the morning, plaintiff was placed in a holding room with other \nwomen.  She was taken to the Charlestown District Court for arraignment.  The court \nordered the plaintiff released on personal recognizance. \n24.  Plaintiff suffered extreme emotional distress as a result of the strip search \nand visual body cavity search conducted at the Suffolk County Jail.  She was shocked \nby  the incident.  She felt humiliated, degraded and violated. \n25.  The search of plaintiff by defendant Doe conformed to the written policy \nof the defendant Suffolk County, specifically, Sheriffs Department Policy Number \nS507.  This  policy  states  that  \"strip  searches  shall  be  conducted  of all  inmates \ncommitted to the custody of the Department.. .. \"  The policy requires a strip search of \nthe nude body of every person \"at the time of each admission to the facility .... \"  The \npolicy also requires that every female prisoner undergo a visual body cavity search of the \nprisoner's anus and vagina. \n26.  The policy of the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department requires this search \nas a matter of routine, without any reason to suspect a strip search and visual body \ncavity search is necessary. \n27.  The policy of the Suffolk County Sheriffs Department applies regardless of \nthe length of time the person is to be held or of the charges lodged against the person. \n\n6 \n28.  The Suffolk County Sheriffs Department conducts a strip search and body \ncavity search of all women who are admitted to the jail inc1udingwomen who are waiting \nfor an initial court appearance, women who are arrested on default warrants, and women \nwho are held in  protective custody. \n29.  Rule 318C of the Rules and Procedures of the Boston Police Department, \nrequires  that all  female  prisoners  \"be  transported  to  the  Suffolk  County Jail  for \ndetainment.\"  Female prisoners are not held overnight at Boston Police stations. \n30.  When female prisoners arrive at the Suffolk County Jail, they are subjected \nto a routine strip search and visual body cavity search as described above. \n31.  It is the policy of the Boston Police Department to hold male prisoners in \ncells at Boston Police stations until their first appearance in court. \n32.  Male prisoners who are held awaiting an initial court appearance, after \narrest on a default warrant or who are held in protective custody in a Boston police \nstation are not subjected to a routine strip search or body cavity search. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n33.  This action is brought pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b) (1), (2) and (3)  of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by plaintiff as a class action on behalf of all women \nwho were or will in the future be: \na.  taken into custody at the Suffolk County Jail before arraignment, or \nafter  an  arrest  on a  default warrant  or after  being taken  into \nprotective custody; and \n\n7 \nb.  subjected to a routine strip search and visual body cavity search at \nthe Suffolk County Jail pursuant to the policy, practice or custom \nof conducting a strip search and visual body cavity search of every \nperson who is admitted to the jail. \n34.  The named plaintiff, Katrina Mack, is a member of the class.  The class \nrepresented by the plaintiff is so numerous that joinder of all such persons is impractical. \nOn information and belief, the number of class members is more than three thousand \nwomen. \n35.  There are questions of law and fact which are common to the class of \nplaintiffs. Central to all the claims is the constitutionality of the policy or practice of the \nSuffolk County Sheriff to routinely conduct strip and visual body cavity searches. \n36.  Plaintiff's claims or defenses are typical of the claims or defenses of the \nclass of plaintiffs. \n37.  Plaintiff will fairly and accurately represent and protect the interests of the \nmembers of the class. The attorney for plaintiff is experienced and capable in civil rights \nlitigation and has  successfully represented plaintiffs  in other civil  rights  litigation \nincluding cases alleging unlawful strip searches. Counsel has the resources and expertise \nto prosecute this action. \n38.  This  action  is  properly  maintained  as  a  class  action  because  the \nprosecutions of separate actions by the individual members of the class would create a \nrisk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \nclass, which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the defendants. \n\n8 \n39.  This  action  is  properly  maintainable  as  a  class  action  because  the \nprosecutions of separate actions would create a risk of adjudications with respect to \nindividual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the \ninterests of the other members who are not parties or substantially impair or impede \ntheir ability to protect their interests. \n40.  The defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class \nthereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or declaratory relief with respect to the \nclass as a whole. \n41.  As a direct result of policy class members have been subject to  unlawful \nstrip searches and visual body cavity searches which has caused each member of the class \nto endure  pain and suffering and mental anguish. \nFIRST COUNT: 42 U.S.C. § 1983: DEFENDANT SUFFOLK COUNTY \n42.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein. \n43.  The policy of the Suffolk County Sheriffs Department regarding strip \nsearches directs County employees to conduct searches that violate the United States \nConstitution. \n44.  By the actions described above, the defendant deprived the plaintiff and \nmembers  of the plaintiff class  of their clearly established  right guaranteed by the \nConstitution of the United States to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure. \n45.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, plaintiff suffered the \ninjuries described above. \n\n9 \nSECOND COUNT: 42 U.S.C. § 1983: DEFENDANT RICHARD ROUSE \n46.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein. \n47.  Defendant Richard Rouse is the Sheriff and is the policymaker for the \nSuffolk County Jail. \n48.  Defendant Rouse implemented and maintained a policy of conducting \nstrip searches and visual body cavity searches of all persons who are admitted to the \nSuffolk County Jail, regardless of the nature of charges or the circumstances of the \nindividual. \n49.  Defendant Rouse knew or should have known that the strip search policy \nat  the  Suffolk  County  Jail  would  result  in  correctional  officers  conducting \nunconstitutional searches of women who were being held for arraignment, in protective \ncustody or pursuant to a default warrant. \n50.  Defendant Rouse established and enforced the policy of conducting routine \nstrip searches without any reason to believe the woman has anything concealed on her \nperson by implementing and maintaining the strip search policy. \n51.  As a result of defendant Rouse's conduct, plaintiff was subjected to the \nsearch described above. \n52.  Even after defendant Rouse had actual knowledge that the policy of strip \nsearching women who were held for arraignment, in protective custody, or pursuant to \na default warrant was unconstitutional, he continued to enforce the policy. \n\n.. \n10 \n53.  Defendant Rouse acted with reckless indifference to the constitutional \nrights of women who are detained at the Suffolk County Jail as described above. \n54.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, plaintiff suffered the \ninjuries described above. \nTHIRD COUNT: 42 U.S.C. § 1983: DEFENDANT CITY OF BOSTON \n55.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein. \n56.  By requiring female prisoners awaiting an initial court appearance to be \nheld  at the  Suffolk County Jail,  it is  the  policy or custom  of the  Boston  Police \nDepartment to require women who are arrested and held in custody before their first \ncourt appearance to undergo a strip search and visual body cavity search while men in \nthe same circumstances are not required to undergo similar searches. \n57.  The strip search and visual body cavity search of all females awaiting an \ninitial court appearance is an affirmative policy of the Boston Police Department which \nviolates the right of women to the equal protection of law and violates the right of \nwomen under the Fourth Amendment to be free  from  unreasonable  searches  and \nseizures. \n58.  As a direct and proximate result of the policies or customs of the City of \nBoston, the plaintiff suffered the injuries described above. \nFOURTH COUNT: 42 U.S.C. §1983: DEFENDANT DOE \n59.  The above paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n\nII \n60.  At all times relevant to this complaint, defendant Doe was acting under \ncolor of the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the County of Suffolk. \n61.  Defendant Doe had no legal justification for conducting a strip search or \na visual body cavity search of the plaintiff's person. \n62.  By  the actions  described  in the preceding paragraphs,  the  defendant \ndeprived the plaintiff of clearly established rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the \nUnited States and by the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights including freedom from \nan unreasonable search and seizure and the right to be treated equally under the law. \n63.  As a direct and proximate result of the acts of the defendant, the plaintiff \nsuffered the injuries described above. \nWHEREFORE the plaintiff requests that this Court: \n1.  declare that the policy or practice of conducting routine strip searches and \nroutine visual body cavity searches of women is illegal and unconstitutional \nand enjoin enforcement of the policy; \n2.  award compensatory damages to the individual plaintiff and to members \nof the plaintiff class; \n3.  award punitive damages against the defendant Rouse; \n4.  award the plaintiffs the costs of this action including reasonable attorney's \nfees; and \n5.  award  whatever  additional  relief  this  Court  deems  necessary and \nappropriate. \n\n12 \nIURYDEMAND \nA jury trial is hereby demanded. \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \nBBO #180080 \nLaw Offices of Howard Friedman \n90 Canal Street \nBoston, MA 02114-2022 \n(617) 742-4100 ",

Garand,\nSuffolk County Sheriff's Department, Boston, MA, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM RE: MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT BY AND\nAGAINST THE CLASS PLAINTIFFS\nGERTNER, District Judge.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBetween December 10, 1995, and September 20, 1999 (\"class period\"), the City of Boston (\"City\") followed an\nexpress policy of transferring all female arrestees who could not post bail to Suffolk County's maximum security\nNashua Street Jail (\"Jail\"). In contrast, the City held male arrestees in City facilities. During the same time period,\nthe Suffolk County (\"County\") Sheriff's Department followed an express policy of subjecting these Jail\nadmittees00all women00to strip and visual body cavity searches.\n97 97\nUntil May 24, 1999, the County's search policy was astonishingly broad. Under this pre-May 1999 policy, County\nofficials strip-searched all arrestees admitted to the Jail, regardless of the crimes with which they were charged,\nor any other individual factors. Women were searched following arrests for crimes as minor as peddling sausages\nwithout a license, and larceny under $250 associated with the failure to return a rented video game.\nThe searches could not have been more degrading. Officers inspected each woman's ears, mouth, and nostrils,\nhumiliating or offensive to the dignity of the woman, asked her to lift each breast and to spread the cheeks of her\nbuttocks so that the officers could inspect her genitals.\nFrom May 24, 1999, until the end of the class period, the search policy was more limited, requiring a\ndetermination of probable cause prior to searches of misdemeanants. The amended policy continued to permit\nsuspicionless strip-searches of all arrestees charged with felonies, however, and it made no attempt to\ndistinguish between arrestees charged with offenses involving violence or illicit substances, and other felony\narrestees arguably less likely to be carrying weapons or contraband.\n134 As a direct result of the City's transfer policy and the County's search policies, *134 more than five thousand\n[1]\nwomen  taken into custody by the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") during the class period were transferred\n[2]\nto the County Jail, where they were subjected to \"routine\"  strip and visual body cavity searches. At issue here\nare the basic rights of this class of women 00many of whom were detained solely because they could not afford to\n97\npost bail. The women00a certified class00challenge the constitutionality of the Jail strip-searches on Fourth\n97 97\n[3]\nAmendment and equal protection grounds.\n\nThis memorandum and order addresses the class' motion for summary judgment [docket entry # 75], as well as\nthe cross motion for partial summary judgment filed by the County, Richard J. Rouse (\"Rouse\") and Jane Doe\n(\"Doe\") (together, \"County defendants\") [docket entry # 92]. For the reasons discussed below, I find and\nDECLARE the County's search policies during the class period facially unconstitutional. Summary judgment is\ntherefore GRANTED in favor of the plaintiffs on all questions relating to the facial constitutionality of those\npolicies.\nI further find the County and the City liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (\"§ 1983\") for violation of the Fourth\nAmendment rights of all class members charged with felonies or misdemeanors involving neither violence nor\ndrugs, and class members held on default warrants for similar offenses. Accordingly, summary judgment of\nliability against the County and City is GRANTED in favor of those plaintiffs.\nWith respect to Sheriff Rouse, I find that he is entitled to qualified immunity for his role in any unconstitutional\nstrip-searches that occurred prior to June 25, 1997, when the First Circuit decided Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1\n(1st Cir. 1997). As detailed below, however, he is liable for all unconstitutional strip-searches that occurred after\nthat date. Accordingly, summary judgment of liability against Sheriff Rouse is GRANTED in part and DENIED in\npart.\nBecause of the state of the record, this Memorandum reaches no decision as to the defendants' Fourth\nAmendment liability for strip-searches of women arrested initially or on default warrants for crimes involving\n[4]\nviolence or drugs.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs' request for summary judgment of liability under the Fourth\nAmendment, and the County defendants' corresponding cross-motion for partial summary judgment, are DENIED\nwith respect to those searches. As described below, further briefing and factual development is necessary to\nclarify the claims of these class members.\n135 *135 To facilitate resolution of the remaining issues in this case, I hereby create two sub-classes of women: (1)\nthose class members arrested (initially or on default warrants) for crimes involving neither drugs nor violence\n(\"Sub-Class I\"); and (2) those class members arrested (initially or on default warrants) for offenses involving\neither drugs or \"violence\" (\"Sub-Class II\"). See Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(4). The plaintiffs are DIRECTED to identify a\nnamed representative for Sub-Class II, or to propose further divisions of the sub-class, by August 15, 2001. This\nfiling should also propose a suitable definition for the term \"violence\" in the context of this case. The defendants'\nresponse is due within fifteen days thereafter.\nFinally, I turn to the plaintiffs' claims against the City for violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. On this question, my holding is clear: The record is more than sufficient to establish that the City\ndenied all plaintiffs, in both Sub-Classes I and II, the equal protection of the laws. Accordingly, the plaintiffs'\nmotion for summary judgment of liability against the City for violation of the Equal Protection Clause is\nGRANTED.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Facts as Presented by the Plaintiff Class\nThe basic, largely uncontested facts of this case are both straightforward and appalling. During the almost four-\nyear period at issue here (and for several previous years), the City transported all female arrestees who could not\n[5]\npost bail to the Suffolk County Jail, a maximum security pre-trial detention facility,  for detention pending their\n[6]\ninitial court appearance.  From the beginning of the class period until late May 1999 (almost a year after this\naction was filed), most if not all of these women00regardless of the crime with which they were charged, or any\n97\n[7]\nother individual characteristics00were strip-searched upon their admission to the Jail.  Worse still, these routine\n97\nstrip-searches were mandated by Sheriff's Department policy (\"Policy I\").\nOn May 24, 1999, the County amended its policy to require a finding of probable cause prior to a strip-search of\nan arrestee charged with a misdemeanor, but the new policy (\"Policy II\") continued to require strip-searches of all\n\narrestees charged with felonies. Not until September 20, 199900 the end of the class period00did the County finally\n97 97\n[8]\neliminate routine strip-searches of all pre-arraignment detainees, including those charged with felonies.\n136 *136 The County concedes that it made the first of these policy changes to conform00 albeit two years late00to a\n97 97\n1997 First Circuit ruling, which held that \"[s]trip and visual body cavity searches must be justified by at least a\n[9]\nreasonable suspicion that [an] arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons.\" Swain, 117 F.3d at 6. The\nCounty apparently made the second change to bring its search policy into conformity with both state law and the\n[10]\nBPD's newly adopted search policy.\nDuring the years in which strip-searches of women arrestees were routine, the searches were conducted without\nany individualized findings of reasonable suspicion. Many of the plaintiffs were searched following arrests for\nmisdemeanors or non-violent felonies, in situations in which there was no apparent reason to suspect them of\ncarrying weapons or contraband. For example, the class representative, Katrina Mack, was strip-searched on\nMarch 5, 1998, after she was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and\n[11]\nleaving the scene after causing property damage.  Another plaintiff was strip-searched after she was arrested\n[12]\nfor violating a municipal ordinance that prohibits peddling sausages without a license.  A third was arrested on\na default warrant for larceny under $250.00, issued after her children failed to return a rented Sega video game.\n[13]\nEven more troubling, the plaintiffs represent that many of the women strip-searched at the Jail had already been\nsearched00and some had undergone visual body cavity inspections00while in BPD custody. That is, according to\n97 97\nthe plaintiffs, these class members were first strip-searched by the BPD, then transported in BPD custody to the\nJail, and then strip-searched again by the officials at the Jail.\nPursuant to the Sheriff's Department's Policy S507(B), the strip-searches at the Jail were incredibly thorough and\ninvasive. Jail officials were told to:\n137 *137 1. Instruct the inmate to empty his/her pockets and set aside property for searching.\n2. Instruct the inmate to remove all clothing and set aside clothes for searching.\n3. Visually examine the inmate's entire body in a careful and systematic order ... to identify and\nseize contraband ....\n4. Start with the inmate's head and hair. Have the inmate run through his/her hair with his/her\nfingers.\n5. Examine behind the inmate's ear.\n6. Check the inmate's mouth by having him/her open wide ....\n7. Check the inmate's nostrils for any abnormalities.\n8. ... Check his/her entire back and chest down to the waist line. Then have the inmate roll his/her\nhands 180 degrees forward and then backwards with his/her fingers widespread. You should also\ncheck under his/her fingernails. Check his/ her armpits carefully and then examine down the sides\nof his/her body to the waist line. If the inmate is female, she must lift each breast separately so\nthat you can check for possible contraband ....\n9. ... [E]xamine the inmate's buttocks and groin area ....\na. The inmate must be told to bend forward and spread the cheeks of his/her buttocks. Be sure to\nlook for possible strings protruding from the anus or vagina ....\nb. The front groin (pubic) area and in between the inmate's legs must be checked thoroughly ....\n10. ... [S]earch down both of the inmate's legs00front, back, inside and out.\n97\n\n11. ... [C]heck the inmate's feet. Don't forget to look between each toe and check the bottom of\neach foot.\nAlthough the County issued a new strip-search policy every year, the basic procedure did not change.\nDespite this exhaustive search procedure, plaintiffs assert, strip-searches of BPD arrestees during the class\nperiod only uncovered contraband 0.063% of the time00on five occasions, during a period in which almost 8,000\n97\nfemale arrestees were brought to the Jail by Boston police.\nAnother disturbing aspect of this story is the City's disparate treatment of male and female arrestees. In\naccordance with City policy during the class period, only female arrestees who could not post bail were\ntransported to the Jail. As a result, although both male and female arrestees were subjected to searches during\n[14]\nbooking at City police stations,  male arrestees who could not post bail were then held in City police lockups\nand only rarely subjected to a second search, while female arrestees were brought to the Jail, where they were\nroutinely subjected to humiliating strip and visual body cavity searches.\nB. Contested Issues of Fact Identified by the County and Sheriff\nRouse\n138 The defendants concede many of the facts detailed above, but they insist that a *138 few key issues remain in\ndispute. For example, the County challenges the plaintiffs' assertion that only 0.063% of searches conducted at\nthe Jail produced contraband. The County argues00with some testimonial support, but no data00that Jail officers in\n97 97\nfact uncovered contraband \"on a regular basis\" as a result of searching BPD detainees. Further, the County\nmaintains that the very fact that some of the Jail searches of BPD detainees uncovered contraband indicates that\n\"proper searches were not conducted by Boston Police before transportation to the Jail.\"\nThe County also takes issue with the plaintiffs' statistics regarding the crimes with which class members were\ncharged, and it offers alternative data. Of most relevance here, the County indicates that it believes there were\n[15]\n7,907 admissions of BPD detainees during the relevant time period,  of which 5,080 were held on\nmisdemeanors only, 2,048 were held on felonies only, and 774 were held on both misdemeanors and felonies.\n[16]\n The County emphasizes that these figures do not indicate that 7,907 women were strip-searched during the\nclass period. It concedes, however, that its policy until May 1999 was to strip-search all arrestees admitted to the\nJail except those who specifically objected to the search, and it offers no data regarding the number of women\nwho objected during the period.\nTurning to the question of liability, the County argues that its obligation to ensure safety at the Jail raises an issue\nof material fact that cannot be addressed on summary judgment. Specifically, the County notes that the Jail is\nprimarily a maximum security pretrial detention facility. It suggests that institutional security concerns during the\nclass period required that BPD detainees entering the Jail be strip-searched before they were brought in contact\nwith the general population. In light of these concerns, the County argues that before this Court can evaluate the\nreasonableness of the contested strip-searches, the fact-finder must determine the appropriate \"weight to be\ngiven the institutional security needs\" at the Jail.\nFinally, the County and Sheriff Rouse argue that there is an outstanding issue of fact regarding the role that\nRouse played in promulgating Suffolk County Sheriff's Department policies. The County avers that it will\ndemonstrate at trial that \"someone other than ... Rouse had final authorization\" to issue such policies.\nC. Contested Issues of Fact Identified by the City\nThe City, too, identifies issues of fact that it believes preclude summary judgment for the plaintiffs. Specifically,\nalthough the City admits that it transferred all of the plaintiffs to the Jail, it asserts that it had no authority or\ncontrol over the manner in which they were treated at the Jail, and it further suggests that it was entitled to\nassume that the County's treatment of the women was constitutional. At \"worst\" (from its perspective), the City\n\nargues that any question of vicarious City liability for searches conducted pursuant to County strip-search policies\n139 raises issues of fact regarding whether the City had *139 actual or constructive knowledge of the County policies.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. Summary Judgment Standard\nSummary judgment is proper only \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In this context, \"material\" means\nthat \"a contested fact has the potential to change the outcome of the suit ... if the dispute over it is resolved\nfavorably to the nonmovant.\" McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 313, 315 (1st Cir.1995). Similarly,\n\"genuine\" means that \"the evidence about the fact is such that a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor\nof the nonmoving party.\" Id.\nIn ruling on a summary judgment motion, a court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party. Rodriguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 181 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir.1999). Overall, therefore, Rule\n56(c) \"mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a\nparty who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's\ncase, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322,\n106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).\nFinally, I note that where, as here, there are dueling motions for summary judgment, the Rule 56 standard\nremains intact. The motions \"simply demand that all factual disputes and any competing rational inferences be\nresolved in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.\" Santana v. Deluxe Corp., 12\nF.Supp.2d 162, 167 (D.Mass.1998) (citing Den Norske Bank v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 75 F.3d 49, 53 (1st\nCir.1996)).\nB. Constitutionality of the Search Policies\nThe plaintiffs' overarching request is that I \"declare that the policy or practice of conducting routine strip-searches\nand routine visual body cavity searches of women is illegal and unconstitutional\" and \"enjoin enforcement\" of the\n[17]\nchallenged County search policies.  For the reasons discussed below, these requests are GRANTED with\n[18]\nrespect to both Policies I and II.\n1. Legal Background\nAs the First Circuit recently held in a similar case, \"[b]oth convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees\"00and\n97\ntherefore, clearly, the pre-arraignment arrestees who largely make up the plaintiff class here00 \"retain\n97\nconstitutional rights despite their incarceration, including basic Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable\n140 searches and seizures.\" Roberts v. Rhode*140Island, 239 F.3d 107, 1090010 (1st Cir. 2001).[19] Since the\n97\ndetainees are confined, their rights may be somewhat more limited than those of the general public, but they are\nnot the nullity that Suffolk County's expansive strip-search policies would suggest.\nStrip and visual body cavity searches are far from \"routine.\" The Supreme Court indicated more than twenty\nyears ago that such searches \"instinctively give[ it] ... pause,\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861,\n60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), and since then courts have used much stronger language. The First Circuit, for example,\ndeems such searches \"an `extreme intrusion' on personal privacy and `an offense to the dignity of the individual.'\"\nRoberts, 239 F.3d at 110 (citing Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1996)). The Seventh Circuit's\nlanguage is even more strident: \"[S]trip searches involving the visual inspection of the anal and genital areas\n[are] demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive,\n\nsignifying degradation and submission.\" Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983)\nmodified (1984) (internal citations omitted).\nThese strong sentiments, which I share, provide the backdrop for my analysis of the challenged County search\npolicies. In addition, the courts have provided a more explicit00if occasionally inconsistent00analytic framework.\n97 97\nThe foundation for this framework is the Supreme Court's observation in Bell that the \"test of reasonableness\nunder the Fourth Amendment ... requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\n[20]\npersonal rights that the search entails.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. To perform this \"Bell balancing test,\" the Court\ninstructed future courts to \"consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Id.\nApplying this test almost two decades later, the First Circuit concluded that strip and visual body cavity searches\n\"must be justified by at least a reasonable suspicion that the [particular] arrestee is concealing contraband or\nweapons.\" Swain, 117 F.3d at 7 (emphasis added). Earlier this year, the First Circuit again applied the\n\"reasonable suspicion\" standard to strike down two Rhode Island policies under which arrestees were routinely\nstrip-searched prior to admission to a state prison. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 108. Further, the Court found the Rhode\nIsland blanket strip-search policies unconstitutional even though the plaintiff in the case was held in a maximum\nsecurity facility where arrestees routinely \"mingle[d] with the general population\"00circumstances arousing\n97\n[21]\nprecisely the same institutional security concerns invoked by the defendants here. Id. at 112-13.\nIn their filings, the defendants cite the Roberts decision, for the proposition that the reasonable suspicion\nstandard only applies \"in the context of prisoners held in local jails for minor offenses.\" Further, the County\n141 invokes Roberts to support its *141 institutional security arguments, because the Roberts court observes in\npassing, \"institutional security is a legitimate need of law enforcement, and may provide a compelling reason for\na warrantless strip-search absent reasonable suspicion of individual wrongdoing.\" Roberts, 239 F.3d at 110, 111.\nThe County takes these quotations entirely out of context. Both of these observations appear in dicta preceding\nthe court's discussion of Roberts' specific claims. Further, even in its discussion of \"compelling\" institutional\nsecurity concerns, the Roberts court provides only two examples of circumstances in which blanket warrantless\nand suspicionless searches may be constitutional: (1) searches of inmates after largely private, full-contact visits\nwith outsiders; and (2) searches of \"particularly dangerous inmates\" returning to a \"special security area\" of a\n[22]\nmaximum security prison after a visit to the law library or infirmary. Id. at 111 (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 5580059; \n97\nArruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 888 (1st Cir.1983)). Neither example applies here.\nThe Roberts court's only other reference to circumstances possibly justifying a blanket search policy that does\nnot require individualized suspicion is its later observation, also in dicta, that the \"reasonable suspicion standard\nmay be met simply by the fact that the inmate was charged with a violent felony.\" Id. at 112 (emphasis added).\nThese dicta, however, give little guidance as to what sort of felony is categorized as \"violent,\" or why someone\ncharged with such an offense should be suspected of concealing weapons or contraband. One might argue, for\nexample, that while the nature of the crime for which someone was arrested should be considered in evaluating\nthe presence or absence of a \"reasonable suspicion\" to search, does not independently establish \"reasonable\nsuspicion\" sufficient to justify a blanket search policy.\n2. Policy I\nThe First Circuit's analysis in Roberts may signal a certain ambivalence about the reasonable suspicion standard\nand the relationship between that standard and institutional security concerns, but that ambivalence does not\naffect the outcome here. In this case, there is absolutely no question that the County's concern for the security of\nthe Jail does not justify its pre-May 1999 policy of searching all BPD arrestees without any individual or class-\nwide findings of reasonable suspicion.\nTo begin with, by the defendants' own admission, the majority of the BPD arrestees were charged with\nmisdemeanors or other minor offenses, and fewer than a quarter of those arrestees were charged with drug\noffenses. Further, the record in this case clearly indicates that many or even most members of the plaintiff class\n\n[23]\nhad already been searched  during booking by the BPD, and had been transported to the Jail in BPD custody.\n142 [24] Under these *142 circumstances, the County cannot reasonably have suspected the women, as a class, of\nharboring weapons or contraband at the time of admission.\nThe County posits that because BPD arrestees joined the general population at the maximum security Jail, they\ncould have served as a conduit for the introduction of drugs or other illicit items. I find this unlikely. It defies belief\nto suppose that any of the plaintiffs deliberately sought arrest in order to smuggle contraband or weapons into the\nJail. Cf. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111 (noting the \"essentially unplanned nature of an arrest and subsequent\nincarceration\"). Further, Jail officials here had no reason to believe00and, indeed, numerous reasons to\n97\ndoubt00that the BPD arrestees, as a class, were particularly dangerous. It may be reasonable \"to safeguard[]\n97\ninstitutional security\" by engaging in \"extra efforts to ensure that the most dangerous inmates do not have access\nto weapons or contraband,\" but \"the extension of the intrusion to far less dangerous inmates ... is a severe\nincursion on privacy frowned upon by the Bell balancing test.\" Id. at 111.\nFinally, I note that if the County truly had serious concerns about allowing the BPD arrestees to mingle with the\ngeneral population, it could simply have held the women in a separate area of the Jail during their short stays.\nIndeed, the County admits that since May 1999, when it abandoned Policy I, it has housed all BPD arrestees in a\nbooking area separate from the Jail's main housing unit. In light of this policy change, which clearly indicates the\nready availability of isolated space to house BPD arrestees, the County's earlier choice to strip-search all BPD\narrestees is nothing short of outrageous.\nNothing on the record before me, therefore, justifies the search policy in place at the Jail prior to May 24, 1999.\n[25]\n Jail officials made no individualized findings of reasonable suspicion prior to conducting strip-searches of\nBPD arrestees. Nor were there any class-wide characteristics or factual circumstances that warranted such\nsearches in every case. While I understand the County's concern over institutional security, that concern does not\nexcuse the County's decision to require the women in the plaintiff class00many of whom had yet to see a judge00to\n97 97\nendure the indignities of a strip and visual body cavity search. \"`[A]n indiscriminate strip-search policy routinely\napplied ... can not be justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.'\" \nRoberts, 239 F.3d at 113 (quoting Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir.1981)).\nThus, Policy I fails to satisfy the Bell balancing test and falls well short of the constitutional standards articulated\nby the First Circuit in Swain and Roberts. Accordingly, I find the policy facially unconstitutional under the Fourth\nAmendment.\n143  3. Policy from May 24 to September 20, 1999\n*143\nAs noted above, the County amended its search policy on May 24, 1999, to require a finding of probable cause\nprior to a strip-search of any pre-arraignment detainee arrested for a misdemeanor. With County approval,\nthough, Jail officials continued to search everyone else00all BPD arrestees charged with felonies, and apparently,\n97\nthose held on default warrants00 without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion, let alone probable\n97\ncause.\nPolicy II also fails Fourth Amendment scrutiny. As indicated above, the First Circuit has only identified a few\nnarrow circumstances in which the reasonable suspicion standard is inapplicable, and blanket strip-searches\npermissible. None of those circumstances is present here. This case does not involve full-contact visits with\noutsiders, but rather routine admissions of new arrestees. There is no indication that women arrested by the BPD\nafter May 1999 were \"particularly dangerous,\" or that the Jail had a \"lengthy [documented] history\" of \"contraband\n[26]\nproblems.\"  Finally, the County made no effort to distinguish women charged with violent felonies from those\nheld on default misdemeanor warrants or charged with lesser felony offenses00like the plaintiff charged with\n97\n[27]\nlarceny over $250.00 for failing to return a rented video game.  I find no support in the First Circuit case law, or\nanywhere else, for the County's peculiar conviction that State officials may constitutionally strip-search all felony\narrestees, and all arrestees held on default warrants, upon admission to the Jail.\n\nIndeed, quite apart from First Circuit law, there is simply no rational basis for making such a consequential and\nyet arbitrary distinction between groups of BPD arrestees. While the felony-misdemeanor distinction provides a\nconvenient benchmark by which society can estimate the seriousness of an offense, it offers little information\n[28]\nabout the likelihood that an individual arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband.  Why, for example,\nshould a woman charged with larceny over $250.00 be suspected of concealing contraband and therefore\nsubjected to a routine suspicionless strip-search, when a woman charged with misdemeanor possession of drugs\ncannot be strip-searched without probable cause? A blanket search policy that distinguished between violent and\nnonviolent felons might be closer to the mark, offering an arguably reasonable00or at least rational00approach to\n97 97\nbalancing the need for particular searches against the indignities consequent to such invasions of privacy, but\ndrawing the line between misdemeanants and felons is not.\nSimilarly, the mere fact that women held on default warrants \"ha[ve] been arraigned, ha[ve] had bail set and ha\n[ve] defaulted on ... court appearance[s]\" does not, as the County maintains, justify routine suspicionless strip-\nsearches. There is no reason to suppose that a woman who once failed to appear before a court is, as a result,\nmore likely to be carrying a weapon or contraband if and when she is later arrested. Indeed, the plaintiff in \n144 Roberts was arrested on such an outstanding warrant, and the First Circuit itself observed *144 that \"both highly\ndangerous and relatively harmless offenders may be incarcerated with judicial approval.\" Roberts, 239 F.3d at\n111. In light of this observation, the County's position that the \"need\" to search all women arrested on default\nwarrants somehow outweighs the resulting invasion of personal rights is simply incomprehensible.\nIn short, I find no reason to believe that a woman charged with a felony or held on a default warrant inherently\npresents a greater risk to prison security (through introduction of weapons or contraband) than a woman charged\nwith a misdemeanor. As a result, I am not persuaded that the County corrected the constitutional deficiencies in\nPolicy I simply by instituting a requirement of probable cause prior to a strip-search of misdemeanor arrestees.\nThe Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches mandates some effort by Jail officials either to\npremise searches on individualized reasonable suspicion or to identify classes of arrestees that reasonably pose\na heightened risk to institutional security. Policy II does neither and is therefore facially unconstitutional.\nC. Defendants' Liability\nAlthough the County's search policies during the class period are facially unconstitutional and warrant declaratory\nrelief for the plaintiffs, the defendants' liability for the promulgation and implementation of those policies00and\n97\nthus, the damages due to the individual plaintiffs00presents a harder question. I first discuss the County's liability\n97\nunder the Fourth Amendment. I then consider Sheriff Rouse's claim of qualified immunity for unconstitutional\nsearches. Finally, I turn to the City's liability for the searches, first under the Fourth Amendment and then under\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n1. The County's Liability for Fourth Amendment Violations\nTo hold a local government entity liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for civil rights violations committed by its\nemployees, a plaintiff must establish that the violations resulted from implementation or execution of a policy or\ncustom of the entity. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 6900091, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56\n97\nL.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Here, there can be no question that (1) prior to May 1999, Suffolk County had an explicit\npolicy of strip-searching every BPD arrestee admitted to the Jail, regardless of any individual characteristics, and\n(2) between May and September 1999, the County had an explicit policy of strip-searching all BPD felony\narrestees and arrestees held on default warrants, again regardless of any individual characteristics. Thus, if any\nof the resulting searches were unconstitutional, the County is liable under Monell.\nThe next question, therefore, is whether any or all Jail searches of BPD arrestees during the class period violated\nthe arrestees' civil rights. As Policies I and II are facially unconstitutional, it is tempting to conclude that all\nsearches conducted while those policies were in effect were also unconstitutional. At this stage, however, I\ndecline to make such a broad finding as a matter of law. Among other issues, it may well be that women charged\nwith certain violent felonies are not entitled to damages for violations of their Fourth Amendment rights in\n\nconnection with the Jail searches. Even though the County policies under which these women were searched\nwere unconstitutional, the particular searches may not have been. Thus, I find it appropriate to subdivide the\nplaintiff class into two sub-classes, the first made up of women to whom the County is clearly liable in damages\n145 as a matter of law, and the second *145 made up of women whose stories present more difficult questions.\nIn identifying the line that separates these sub-classes, I am guided at this preliminary stage by my conviction\nthat arrestees charged with offenses00felonies or misdemeanors00that involve neither drugs nor violence pose no\n97 97\ninherent risk to the institutional security of a detention facility. I am also guided by the First Circuit's suggestion in\ndicta that the \"reasonable suspicion standard may be met simply by the fact that [an] inmate was charged with a\nviolent felony.\" Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112. While I am not persuaded that this statement governs my decisions in\nthis case, it does convince me that on the record now before me, I cannot determine that all plaintiffs charged\nwith violent felonies are entitled to damages from the County as a matter of law.\nBased on these principles, I define the following sub-classes: (1) Sub-Class I: class members who were searched\nfollowing arrests (either originally or on a default warrant) for offenses involving neither violence nor drugs (class\nrepresentative Katrina Mack); and (2) Sub-Class II: the remaining class members, who were searched after\nfollowing arrests for offenses (either misdemeanors or felonies) involving drugs or \"violence\" (class\n[29]\nrepresentative to be determined).\na. County Liability to Sub-Class I\nThere can be no question about the County's liability in damages to the women in Sub-Class I. All of these\nwomen were subjected to horribly invasive strip and visual body cavity searches. The County made no pretense\nof balancing the need for the searches against \"the invasion of personal rights that the search[es] entail[ed].\" Bell,\n441 U.S. at 559.\nFurther, even if I were to allow the County now to propose a retroactive rationale for the searches, nothing the\nCounty could suggest would suffice to justify its routine policy of searching women whose alleged\nconduct00whether misdemeanor or felony00involved neither drugs nor violence. Why should a woman charged\n97 97\nwith uttering a forged check00or, for that matter, violating a regulation governing sausage peddling00therefore be\n97 97\n[30]\nsuspected of carrying concealed weapons or drugs?  There is no rational reason for the County to have\nconcluded that these women, as a class, posed a threat to the institutional security of the Jail.\nAccordingly, the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment of liability against the County is GRANTED in part. The\nCounty is liable in damages for the unconstitutional searches of all women in Sub-Class I. With respect to Sub-\nClass I, therefore, this action will now proceed to individual hearings to determine the amount of damages owed\nto each woman. One further caveat: If the County can produce evidence suggesting that it had individualized\n146 reasonable suspicion to search any particular *146 woman in Sub-Class I00due, for example, to her conduct\n97\nduring arrest00it is invited to introduce that evidence during the individualized damages hearings. The Court or the\n97\nfact-finder will then make findings of fact, and I will adjust my estimate of liability accordingly.\nb. County Liability to Sub-Class II\nOn the record now before me, the County's liability in damages as a matter of law to the women in Sub-Class II is\nless clear. While I appreciate these plaintiffs' argument that they are entitled to damages because the County did\nnot, at the time of the searches, conduct the Bell balancing test, let alone make individualized findings of\nreasonable suspicion, I also recognize that generic characteristics may occasionally generate sufficient security\nconcerns to justify \"warrantless strip-search[es] absent reasonable suspicion of individual wrongdoing.\" Roberts,\n239 F.3d at 111. In this case, the maximum security Jail sought, reasonably, to prevent the introduction of drugs\nor weapons. It therefore seems plausible00albeit barely00 that Jail officials could constitutionally have followed a\n97 97\npolicy of searching arrestees charged with certain crimes, namely those involving weapons or drugs, on the\ntheory that perpetrators of such crimes are marginally more likely to be hiding weapons or drugs on their person\nat the time of the arrest.\n\nI emphasize, however, that this discussion does not constitute a prediction that the County will ultimately be\nabsolved of liability for the routine searches of the women in Sub-Class II. Rather, my point is merely that on the\nrecord now before me, I cannot conclude as a matter of law that those women are entitled to damages.\nThe plaintiffs' current filings paint a very sympathetic picture of the class as a whole, because they tell the stories\nonly of those women arrested for minor and nonviolent offenses. Before I reach any decision regarding the\nCounty's liability to the women in Sub-Class II, I must have some better understanding of the types of crimes with\nwhich the women were charged. Accordingly, summary judgment of liability is DENIED with respect to Sub-Class\nII.\nTo facilitate resolution of the remaining issues relating to Sub-Class II, the plaintiffs are ORDERED to identify a\n[31]\nsub-class representative, or to propose further subdivisions of the sub-class,  by August 15, 2001. In this\nsame filing, the plaintiffs are instructed to propose a suitable definition for the terms \"violence\" and \"violent\noffense,\" as used herein. The defendants may respond within fifteen days thereafter.\n2. Sheriff Rouse's Liability for Fourth Amendment Violations\nThe parties agree that the Sheriff of Suffolk County \"has final policymaking authority for establishing policies for\nconducting searches of prisoners at the Nashua Street Jail.\" Thus, because Rouse became Sheriff in October\n1996 and remained in that position for the rest of the class period, he clearly bears responsibility for the County's\nunconstitutional strip-search policies during most of the class period.\nThe County's argument to the contrary 00that Rouse never directly \"exercised []his authority\" to establish County\n97\nsearch policies, but instead \"relied on the expertise of his staff in promulgating Department policies\"00is\n97\n147 unavailing. Sheriff Rouse's hands-off approach to his job does *147 not absolve him of responsibility for\nunconstitutional policies developed and promulgated by his underlings on his watch.\nThe only outstanding question relevant to Rouse's liability in damages, therefore, is whether he is entitled to\nimmunity for any of the unconstitutional searches performed during the class period. The Supreme Court\n[32]\nestablished the standard for qualified immunity  two decades ago, in Harlow v. Fitzgerald:\n[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for\ncivil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.... If the law at [the time of\nthe offense] was not clearly established, an official could not reasonably be expected to anticipate\nsubsequent legal developments, nor could he fairly be said to \"know\" that the law forbade conduct\nnot previously identified as unlawful.\nId., 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); see also Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 569\n(1st Cir.1985) (discussing a Sheriff's potential qualified immunity in a context similar to that here). This standard\nrequires a court to inquire first whether the constitutional right in question was clearly established at the time of\nthe injury, and second whether \"a reasonable, similarly situated official [would have understood] that the\nchallenged conduct violated that established right.\" Swain, 117 F.3d at 9. Applying this standard here, I find\nSheriff Rouse entitled to qualified immunity for all unconstitutional searches conducted prior to the First Circuit's\n1997 decision in Swain, but liable in damages for all such searches performed thereafter.\nThe law governing strip-searches has changed significantly over the last thirty years. As recently as 1975, the\nFirst Circuit held that post-arrest searches involving visual body cavity inspections were \"plainly authorized\" by\nSupreme Court precedent and required no further scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment. United States v. Klein,\n522 F.2d 296, 300 (1975). Since then, the Court has come full circle, announcing on June 25, 1997 that Klein is\nno longer good law, and further, that strip and visual body cavity searches cannot be conducted without\nindividualized reason to suspect that the arrestee is harboring weapons or contraband. Swain, 117 F.3d at 7.\nThis is precisely the sort of situation for which the doctrine of qualified immunity was developed. The rationale for\nthe doctrine is, in part, that it reduces the likelihood that \"able citizens\" will be deterred \"from accept[ing] public\n\noffice\" by the possibility of personal liability for actions taken in good-faith reliance on uncertain legal standards. \nHarlow, 457 U.S. at 814. I therefore find that Sheriff Rouse has established the defense of qualified immunity for\nthose searches. Between 1975 and 1997, the lingering effects of Klein sufficiently muddied the waters of Fourth\nAmendment jurisprudence in this Circuit that a reasonable person in the Sheriff's position could, in good faith,\n[33]\nhave believed the County's routine search policy to be constitutional.\n148 *148 In conclusion, therefore, summary judgment of liability against Sheriff Rouse is GRANTED in part, and the\nCounty defendants' motion for summary judgment is also GRANTED in part. I find Rouse liable in damages to all\nmembers of Sub-Class I who were searched at the Jail after June 25, 1997. As discussed above for the County,\n[34]\nthe amount of those damages will be determined in future, individualized hearings.\nRouse's liability for searches of the women in Sub-Class II remains to be determined, but should those searches\nultimately be found to be unconstitutional, Rouse will only be responsible for searches conducted after June 25,\n[35]\n1997.\n3. The City's Liability for Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment\nViolations\n[12] City liability for the Jail searches of BPD arrestees poses an interesting question of institutional responsibility.\nAgain, the governing standard derives from Monell: § 1983 provides a cause of action against a municipality for\nviolations resulting from implementation or execution of city policies or customs. Monell, 436 U.S. at 6900091. In\n97\nthis case, though, the plaintiffs' claims fit none of the standard analytic models for municipal liability. For example,\nthe City, unlike the County, had no express policy of subjecting all BPD arrestees to strip and visual body cavity\nsearches. Indeed, the City claims00and I assume, for purposes of this ruling00that it had no control over the\n97 97\npromulgation of the County policies proximately responsible for the challenged searches. Further, the record\nbefore me does not suggest that any City employees had a practice or custom of conducting such searches00let\n97\nalone a practice sufficiently \"well settled and widespread\" as to be attributable to the City. Bordanaro v. City of\nEverett, 871 F.2d 1151, 1156 (1st Cir.1989). Finally, none of the challenged searches resulted directly from the\nCity's failure to promulgate a search policy, e.g. Cornfield v. Consolidated High School District No. 230, 991 F.2d\n1316 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"[I]n situations that call for procedures, rules, or regulations, the failure to make a policy\nitself may be actionable\"), nor from its failure to train its employees regarding the constitutional prerequisites to a\nsearch, City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 3880090, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1988) (\"[T]here\n97\nare limited circumstances in which an allegation of a `failure to train' can be the basis for liability under § 1983\").\nNonetheless, the plaintiffs' claims against the City are clearly actionable under § 1983. The plaintiffs point to an\nexpress agreement between the City and the County Sheriff, under which the County agreed to \"take custody of\nand house\" BPD arrestees at the Jail. This case is thus best analyzed as involving a subcontract between the\nCity and the County, under which Jail employees, acting as agents of the City, supervised and cared for City\n149 arrestees.[36] As such, the City had *149 an affirmative obligation00as is present in the more standard models for\n97\nmunicipal liability00to ensure that the policy of the Jail officials did not lead to widespread violation of BPD\n97\narrestees' constitutional rights. Ancata v. Prison Health Services, Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 705 n. 9 (11th Cir.1984)\n(\"[W]here a governmental entity delegates the final authority to make decisions then those decisions necessarily\nrepresent official policy\").\nA simple example is sufficient to prove this point. Suppose the City had contracted with a private party to run a\nwomen's detention facility. If the wardens at that facility followed a deliberate and explicit policy of starving or\ntorturing the women in their care, the City clearly could not argue that it bore no responsibility for those abuses.\n\"In that sense, the [City's] duty [to detainees in its care] is non-delegable.\" Id. at 705. Similarly, here, \"although\nthe [County] ... contracted to perform an obligation owed by the [City], the [City] itself remains liable for any\n[37] [38]\nconstitutional deprivations caused by the policies or customs of the [County].\" Id.\nHaving established that the City had an affirmative obligation to monitor conditions for BPD arrestees housed at\nthe Jail, I must next assess whether the City failed to meet that obligation. In so doing, I find the \"deliberate\n\nindifference\" standard of City of Canton readily applicable. 489 U.S. at 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197. As in that action, the\nalleged municipal misdeed here is not an affirmative policy but a \"failure\" 00the failure adequately to monitor the\n97\nsearch policies followed by City agents employed at the Jail, to ensure compliance with minimum constitutional\nstandards. To establish liability, then, the plaintiffs must establish that the City's failure to monitor \"amount[ed] to\ndeliberate indifference to the rights\" of BPD detainees. City of Canton, 489 U.S. at 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197.\nThe plaintiffs easily meet this standard. Strip-searches at maximum security detention facilities are an unfortunate\n150 fact of life, yet the City chose to house almost *150 ten thousand BPD arrestees in such a facility without once\nchecking, even after the 1997 Swain decision, that the facility had a constitutional search policy00let alone\n97\ninvestigating the actual practices of Jail employees. For that matter, no City official apparently remarked on Jail\npersonnel's surprising lack of curiosity about the precise nature of BPD booking searches. This lack of curiosity\nitself should have alerted City officials to the likelihood that the Jail followed a policy of routinely strip-searching\nall admittees rather than tailoring each search to the particular circumstances of an individual admittee's arrest.\nAs this case sadly illustrates, the risks posed by the City's \"glaring omissions\" of oversight are concrete and\nobvious. Board of County Comm'rs of Bryan County, Okla. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 410, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137\nL.Ed.2d 626 (1997). Those risks are more than sufficient to establish \"deliberate indifference\" as a matter of law.\n[39]\nId.\nTo excuse its failure to monitor the Jail's search policy and practice, the City cites Deaton v. Montgomery County,\nOhio, 989 F.2d 885, 888 (6th Cir.1993), for the proposition that it was entitled to assume that conditions at the Jail\ncomported with constitutional standards. This argument might make some sense if the City had merely asked the\nCounty to house a few arrestees for a short period. Here, however, the City effectively used the County Jail as its\nown facility for almost a decade. To permit the City to escape liability in this case would be to sanction willful\ndisregard of municipal obligations. The City presumably could have chosen to build a municipal facility for\n[40]\nwomen, or to hold arrestees in one of the ten existing City police station lockups.  That it chose instead to\ncontract with the County to house female arrestees did not entitle it to bury its head in the sand and ignore the\nmanner in which the County treated those arrestees. Governmental entities may not \"slough off their responsibilit\n[ies]\" by performing \"a `shell game' with the legal ownership of prisons.\" Deaton v. Montgomery County, Ohio,\n989 F.2d 885, 890 (6th Cir.1993) (Boggs, J., concurring).\nUnder these circumstances, there can be no question that the City's liability in damages for Jail violations of BPD\narrestees' Fourth Amendment rights is coextensive with that of the County. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' request for\nsummary judgment of City liability is GRANTED in part. The City is liable in damages for the unconstitutional\nsearches of women in Sub-Class I throughout the class period. The City's liability for the searches of women in\nSub-Class II remains to be determined.\n4. The City's Liability for Equal Protection Violations\nFinally, I turn to the plaintiffs' claim that the City denied female arrestees the equal protection of the laws. As (1)\nthere can be no question that explicit City policy mandated that the women be sent to the Jail, and (2) I have\n151 already concluded that the City can be held liable under *151 § 1983 for subsequent Fourth Amendment\nviolations at the Jail, the only issue that must be addressed to determine City liability on the plaintiffs' equal\nprotection claim is whether the City policy, and the resulting searches, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nThe City's policy of sending women to the County Jail resulted in a clear and significant gender disparity in the\ntreatment of BPD arrestees. Both male and female arrestees were searched incident to booking, but only female\narrestees were routinely subjected to degrading strip and visual body cavity searches thereafter. To satisfy the\nrequirements of the Equal Protection Clause, the City would have to show that it had \"an `exceedingly persuasive\njustification' for [this] differing treatment.\" Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273 (citing Mississippi University for Women\nv. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724, 102 S.Ct. 3331, 73 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1982)).\n[This] burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on the [City].... The [City] must show\n`at least that the [challenged] classification serves `important governmental objectives and that the\n\ndiscriminatory means employed' are `substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.'\nThe justification ... must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents,\ncapacities, or preferences of males and females.\nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996).\nThe City fails to carry this burden. It explains its decision to house female arrestees at the County Jail by referring\nbriefly to \"the need to ensure the security, safety and health of the female prisoners, which could not adequately\nbe fulfilled at the [BPD] area station houses.\" It indicates that \"[p]olice district cells could not hold women,\nbecause they were not configured to separate women from men,\" and it argues \"the department did not have the\npersonnel and resources to administer holding cells for women.\"\nThese conclusory statements do little more than recast the City's original decision to discriminate in less offensive\nterms. To satisfy the strictures of the equal protection jurisprudence outlined above, the City would have to\nexplain why it could find no satisfactory space for women in the BPD station houses, and why it felt its personnel\n[41]\nand resources were better used to meet the needs of male rather than female arrestees.  Vague and general\nreferences to funding and space constraints cannot justify a policy that resulted directly in the strip and visual\nbody cavity searches of thousands of female arrestees, while permitting their male counterparts to rest in the\nrelative comfort and security of BPD lockups. An explicit City policy of searching female but not male BPD\narrestees would clearly violate the Equal Protection Clause. E.g., Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 12730074. The policy\n97\nat issue here is an improvement in name only.\nThus, I find the City liable in damages for the violation of the equal protection rights of all women in the plaintiff\nclass, regardless of the crimes with which they were charged, or the sub-class in which they fall for the Fourth\nAmendment analysis. The amount of damages remains to be determined.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n152 As detailed above, the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is ALLOWED in *152 part and DENIED in part.\nThe County defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED.\nThe plaintiffs are ORDERED to name a representative for Sub-Class II00or alternatively, to propose further\n97\nsubdivision of that class00by August 15, 2001. The defendants' response is due within fifteen days thereafter.\n97\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] As noted below, the defendants indicate that almost 8,000 women meet this class description. This larger\nnumber apparently includes many women who chose to opt out of the plaintiff class.\n[2] I adopt the plaintiffs' terminology, but I note that I do not believe \"`a strip-search can ... be characterized as a\nroutine procedure. ... Indeed, a strip-search, by its very nature, constitutes an extreme intrusion upon personal\nprivacy, as well as an offense to the dignity of the individual.'\" Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1996),\ncited with approval in Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1997).\n[3] One individual plaintiff, Bronwyn Ford, opted out of the class but continues to pursue her claims as an\nindividual party to this action. I discuss her claims in a separate Memorandum, also issued today.\n[4] I note, however, that Sheriff Rouse's qualified immunity for searches conducted prior to June 25, 1997,\nextends to searches of women arrested initially or on default warrants for crimes involving violence or drugs.\n[5] According to Sheriff Rouse, the Jail was never intended to house pre-arraignment detainees.\n[6] This practice began in March 1991, when the City closed its House of Detention and established a policy\nwhereby \"[f]emale prisoners arrested or detained by members of the Boston Police Department [(\"BPD\")] [were]\nprocessed in the usual manner and then transported to the Suffolk County Jail ... for detainment.\" BPD Rule 318-\nC. And the practice will apparently stop as of September 2001. \n\nIn apparent response to this ongoing class action, I note that the BPD recently announced that beginning as early\nas September 2001, it will no longer place female suspects awaiting arraignment in the custody of the County\nSheriff's Department. Francie Latour, Boston to Stop Holding Women Suspects in Suffolk Jail, Boston Globe,\nJune 7, 2001, at A21.\n[7] The County indicates that prior to May 24, 1999, the only detainees not searched were those who explicitly\nrefused the search. Those detainees were not housed with the general Jail population but were instead placed\nalone in a cell in the Booking Room and watched by a Jail officer. The County provides no record of the number\nof women who avoided a search in this way.\n[8] The parties' various filings are strangely silent about the County's search policy for prisoners held pursuant to\ndefault felony or misdemeanor warrants. As the County defendants' various filings argue that routine searches of\nsuch women are constitutional, I proceed on the assumption that both Policy I and Policy II allowed such\nsearches without a finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause.\n[9] See County's Suppl. Resp. to Pls.' Fourth Set of Interrogs at Resp. 4.\n[10]Id. at Resp. 5. \nIn 1999, the SJC concluded that \"probable cause is the appropriate standard to apply to strip and visual body\ncavity searches.\" Commonwealth v. Thomas, 429 Mass. 403, 708 N.E.2d 669, 673 (Mass.1999). The BPD then\nadopted a new policy, under which probable cause \"to believe an arrestee has either contraband or weapons in\nhis or her possession is necessary before a strip-search may be conducted.\" BPD Rule 318D.\n[11] The plaintiffs' filings do not seem to indicate whether Mack was charged with a misdemeanor or a felony, but\nunder Massachusetts law, \"a first offense of operating while under the influence is a misdemeanor.\" \nCommonwealth v. Savage, 430 Mass. 341, 719 N.E.2d 473, 477 (Mass.1999). In the absence of any contrary\nindication, therefore, I will assume Mack was charged with a misdemeanor. \nAccording to the plaintiffs, 575 other members of the class were also charged with motor vehicle violations,\nincluding operating under the influence, and operating without a license.\n[12] Plaintiffs indicate that like this woman, 137 women in the class were arrested for miscellaneous minor\nmisdemeanors.\n[13] Plaintiffs maintain that 553 class members were charged with larceny, (90 for larceny under $250.00, and\n463 for larceny over $250.00), 630 with shoplifting, and 156 with uttering. \nAdditional statistics provided by the plaintiffs include: 286 class members charged with trespass; 351 with\ndisorderly conduct; 201 with receiving a stolen motor vehicle; 588 with domestic assault and battery; and 188\nwith violation of a restraining order.\n[14] The City's search policy and practice apparently varied during the class period, but the plaintiffs allege that\nboth men and women were frequently strip-searched incident to booking, and a few plaintiffs claim they were also\nsubjected to visual body cavity inspections while in BPD custody.\n[15] This number includes all BPD detainees admitted to the Jail during the time period at issue here. It therefore\ncounts all women who fit the class description, including those who opted out of this action. (The parties offer no\nexplanation for the difference between this figure (7,907) and the numbers cited by the plaintiffs (7,878 at one\npoint, and 8,109 elsewhere)).\n[16] Five women cannot be placed into one of these three categories due to an obscure problem with the\nCounty's charge data.\n[17] I recognize that neither Policy I nor II remains in effect, and further, that the SJC's recent decision in \nCommonwealth v. Thomas, supra note 11, renders it unlikely that the City or County will ever again pursue a\npolicy of strip-searching arrestees without probable cause. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief are not moot, as the defendants have not established that it is \"`absolutely clear'\" their \"`wrongful\n\nbehavior'\" will not recur. Mack v. Suffolk County, 191 F.R.D. 16, 21 (D.Mass.2000) (citing City of Mesquite v.\nAladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 102 S.Ct. 1070, 71 L.Ed.2d 152 (1983)).\n[18] I emphasize that this finding does not resolve the issue of the defendants' liability for the strip-searches of\nclass members. That issue is discussed at length below.\n[19] As indicated below, the Roberts decision involved a constitutional challenge to two Rhode Island blanket\nstrip-search policies.\n[20] This is commonly referred to as the \"Bell reasonableness test.\" E.g., Roberts, 239 F.3d at 108.\n[21] I also note that Roberts was arrested on an outstanding \"body attachment\"00a Rhode Island writ that \"allows\n97\nofficers to take the defendant into custody if the family court is not in session.\" Id. at 108 n. 2. Thus, Roberts'\narrest was sanctioned by a judge, much like the arrests on default warrants at issue here.\n[22] In addition to the factors referenced in the text, the prison in question also had a long, well-documented\nhistory of contraband problems. Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111 (citing Arruda, 710 F.2d at 888). Though the defendants\nhere argue that the County Jail has such a contraband problem, they provide little data to support their contention\nthat BPD arrestees contribute to the problem in any way.\n[23] The defendants dispute the plaintiffs' claim that City police officers strip-searched female arrestees as part of\na routine booking search. The City provides no evidence, however, to refute the numerous depositions submitted\nby the plaintiffs, in which female officers indicate that they routinely required women to strip, partially or\ncompletely, during a booking search.\n[24] The County's observation that Jail officials found some contraband on BPD arrestees in spite of the prior\nbooking searches does little to convince me that the contested searches were necessary. Though there is some\nfactual dispute as to the amount of contraband discovered as a result of the strip-searches of BPD arrestees, the\nCounty has produced only five records indicating that Jail officials discovered contraband as a result of an\nintrusive strip-search. \"The lack of specific instances where a body cavity search was necessary to discover\ncontraband supports a finding that the policy of searching all [arrestees] is an unreasonable one.\" Id. at 112.\n[25] I recognize that the challenged searches would have been still worse if, for example, Jail officials had\nperformed them in a public setting, or if male officials had searched the female arrestees. The absence of these\naggravating factors does not, however, render harmless the County's misguided search policy. Cf. Roberts, 239\nF.3d at 107 (noting that the unconstitutional search at issue in that case was performed \"in a relatively private\nmanner\").\n[26]See supra note 22.\n[27] Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, § 30 (defining larceny over $250.00 as a felony offense).\n[28]See generally Gabriel M. Helmer, Note, Strip-search and the Felony Detainee: A Case for Reasonable\nSuspicion, 81 B.U. L.Rev. 239, 284 (2001) (surveying cases and concluding that the \"circuits have found, in\ninterpreting the Bell standard, that the mere classification of the crime charged, whether felony or misdemeanor,\nis irrelevant.\")\n[29] I reach no decision here as to the definition of the term \"violence\" in the context of this case. As indicated\nbelow, the parties are invited to propose a suitable definition in their next filings to this Court. In so doing, the\nparties should keep in mind that the object of this endeavor is to separate offenses that inherently generate a\nsuspicion the offender may be concealing weapons or contraband, from offenses that generate no such\nsuspicion.\n[30] This conclusion is only strengthened by the particular facts of this case, including the prior BPD booking\nsearches, the women's transferral to the Jail in BPD custody, and the documentary evidence suggesting that full\nstrip and visual body cavity searches only rarely resulted in the discovery of contraband.\n\n[31]Cf. United States Parole Commission v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 408, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 63 L.Ed.2d 479 (1980)\n(discussing \"the burden of constructing subclasses\").\n[32] There can be no question that, \"as a prison administrator, the Sheriff is entitled to invoke [this] immunity\ndefense.\" Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 569 (1st Cir.1985).\n[33] In fact, the district judge in Swain himself concluded that \"[a]lthough Klein predate[d] the premiere Supreme\nCourt case on strip-searches, Bell ..., it remain[ed] valid First Circuit law.\" Swain, 932 F.Supp. 25 (D.Mass.1996), \nrev'd,117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997).\n[34] As the issue of punitive damages involves questions of Rouse's subjective knowledge and intent, that issue,\ntoo, is best reserved for resolution in individualized damages hearings.\n[35] My findings regarding qualified immunity also extend to defendant Doe. The plaintiffs do not request\nsummary judgment of their claims against Doe, however, so I do not here assess her liability for searches after\nJune 25, 1997.\n[36] I recognize that this would not be sufficient to support City liability under a theory of respondeat superior. \nBoard of County Comm'rs of Bryan County, Okla. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626\n(1997) (\"We have consistently refused to hold municipalities liable under a theory of respondeat superior.\"\n(internal citations omitted)). Here, however, the question is City liability for promulgation and implementation of an\nexpress County policy, not City liability for the negligent acts of County employees acting as agents of the City.\n[37] That the County is a public entity does not alter this analysis. At least in the prison context, a private party\nthat contracts to perform a public service is considered a \"state actor\" for purposes of § 1983 liability, so there is\nno reason to suppose that a municipality's constitutional obligations to its detainees are somehow more\nacceptably delegated to a public than a private entity. E.g. West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101\nL.Ed.2d 40 (1988) (holding that for § 1983 purposes, a private physician under contract to provide medical\nservices to inmates in a state prison system acted \"under color of state law\" when treating an inmate). Thus, any\nentity, public or private, that takes on the city's obligations may be held liable as a state actor under § 1983, but\nthe city, too, retains its oversight obligations.\n[38]Accord Young v. City of Little Rock, 249 F.3d 730 (8th Cir.2001). The Young case involved a situation similar\nto that here, in which the City of Little Rock contracted with Pulaski County for the housing of city prisoners. The\nplaintiff in the case, Willie Mae Young, sought to hold the City accountable for her strip-search at the County jail.\nThe Eighth Circuit upheld the jury verdict for Young, reasoning as follows: \nStrip-searching of prisoners is routine procedure, and the jury could reasonably infer that the City knew that a\nperson entering the [County] jail, in jail clothing with a group of other detainees, would be strip-searched. In these\ncircumstances, it is far from unfair to attribute to the City the policies routinely used by the County jail in the\nhousing and processing of City prisoners.\nId. at 736.\n[39] As further evidence of the City's deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of its arrestees, the\nplaintiffs note that the City failed to adopt its own policy on the issue of strip-searches until September 1998,\nmidway through the class period. Though regrettable, that omission is not directly relevant here. Even if the City\nhad promulgated an explicit policy regarding strip-searches, the policy would not necessarily have protected\nfemale BPD arrestees from strip-searches at the Jail; the absence of such a policy is neither necessary nor\nsufficient to prove \"deliberate indifference\" to conditions at the Jail.\n[40] In fact, this is what the City now proposes to do. City's Letter to the Court of June 6, 2001 [docket entry #\n114].\n[41] For example, cells in one of the existing station houses could have been devoted to female arrestees, as the\nCity now proposes to do.
