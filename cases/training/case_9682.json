    "summary": "<p>On September 18, 1996, a group of Hispanic migrant workers filed a lawsuit against the Ohio State Highway Patrol under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of  Ohio, alleging that the Highway Patrol conducted unconstitutional automobile stops, detentions and searches solely on the basis of race and/or national origin; interrogated them about their immigration status and confiscated immigration papers without justification.   Plaintiffs asserted violations of the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification.</p><p>On June 24, 1997, the District Court (Judge James G. Carr) denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, as none of the named plaintiffs had ever been stopped by the Highway Patrol.  After amending their complaint to add plaintiffs who had been so detained, plaintiffs renewed their request for a preliminary injunction.  Judge Carr issued a preliminary injunction on December 8, 1997, prohibiting the questioning about immigration status, or seizure of immigration papers, without reasonable cause.  He, however, declined relief on plaintiffs' claim of stops based on ethnicity. Farm Labor Organizing Committee v. Ohio State Highway Patrol, 991 F.Supp. 895 (N.D.Ohio 1997). On August 17, 1998, the District Court certified the case as a class action.  Farm Labor Organizing Committee v. Ohio State Highway Patrol, 184 F.R.D. 583, (N.D. Ohio 1998).</p><p>The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment. By order dated September 8, 1999, the Court (Judge Carr) granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on one claim (Fourth Amendment violation in retaining two plaintiffs' green cards for four days following traffic stop), but entered judgment for defendants on all other claims.  The preliminary injunction was dissolved.  Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of their claims for  injunctive relief under Title VI, class-wide claims for injunctive relief under the Fourth Amendment, and equal protection claims.  The District Court  granted in part and denied in part the motion for reconsideration, granting partial summary judgment to plaintiffs' on their equal protection claims, but denying relief under Title VI and finding that there as no standing for class wide injunctive relief.  The Court also refused to extend qualified immunity to defendants on some claims.  Farm Labor Organizing Committee v. Ohio State Highway Patrol, 95 F.Supp.2d 723 (N.D.Ohio Apr 20, 2000).   Defendants then appealed. The Court of Appeals (Circuit Judge Moore) affirmed. Farm Labor Organizing Committee v. Ohio State Highway Patrol 308 F.3d 523 (6th Cir. 2002).</p><p>On remand, the parties settled the case.  A formal Settlement Agreement was filed on May 5, 2003.  Under the Agreement, the Highway Patrol agreed to pay two named plaintiffs $7,500 each and pay attorneys' fees of $85,000 to the Equal Justice Foundation.  The Highway Patrol also agreed to continue to maintain and enforce its policies, procedures and training protocols regarding the issue of racial bias.</p><p>We have no further information on this case.</p><p></p>",

Ohio, Western Division.\nApril 20, 2000.\n777722224567 *724*725*726*727 John Mark Finnegan, William B. Senhauser, Equal Justice Foundation, Toledo, OH, for\nPlaintiff.\nAllen P. Adler, Carol Hamilton O'Brien, Office of Attorney General, Corrections Litigation Section, Columbus, OH,\nTomi L. Dorris, Office of Attorney General, Ohio State Highway Patrol, Columbus, OH, for Defendants.\nORDER\nCARR, District Judge.\nThis is a civil rights case involving the questioning of Hispanic motorists about their immigration status by the\nOhio State Highway Patrol (OSHP). This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Pending is plaintiffs'\nmotion for reconsideration of my September 8, 1999 Order. (Doc. 111). For the following reasons, plaintiffs'\nmotion for reconsideration shall be granted in part and denied in part.\nBACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs are migrant workers who claim that the OSHP, particularly members of its Traffic and Drug Interdiction\nTeam (TDIT), violated their constitutional rights by interrogating them about their immigration status, and, in some\ncases, confiscating immigration documents, on the basis of their Hispanic appearance. Plaintiffs seek a an\ninjunction prohibiting this alleged practice and money damages. (See Doc. 44).\nOn Sunday, March 26, 1995, at approximately 2:00 p.m., named plaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza were traveling\neastbound on Interstates 80-90 near the exit for Ohio State Route 2. Aguilar was driving. Trooper Kiefer pulled\nplaintiffs over for a faulty headlight. Plaintiffs do not dispute the legitimacy of this stop.\nTrooper Kiefer approached and asked to see Aguilar's license. Aguilar complied, providing an Illinois license.\nTrooper Kiefer then ordered Aguilar out of the car and placed him in the back of his cruiser.\nAlmost immediately, a second cruiser arrived. The trooper from the second cruiser walked a drug-sniffing dog\naround the outside of plaintiffs' vehicle. The dog \"alerted,\" thereby indicating that plaintiffs' vehicle contained\n[1]\nnarcotics.\nThe second trooper demanded to see Esparza's identification; she provided Illinois photo identification. She then\nwas asked to produce her green card, which she did. Esparza was placed in the cruiser with Aguilar. Trooper\nKiefer demanded to see Aguilar's green card at that time.\nAfter initial examination of the green cards, Trooper Kiefer asked plaintiffs where they had gotten their green\ncards and whether they had paid for them, meaning to ask whether they were forged documents. Plaintiffs replied\n728 that they had, in fact, paid for their green cards, intending to communicate that they had *728 paid the required\n[2]\nprocessing fees, not that they had obtained their green cards illegally.  Trooper Kiefer misunderstood from\nplaintiffs' answers that the green cards were forged because green cards are not available for purchase.\n\nRather than return the green cards, Trooper Kiefer retained them for authentication. He did not issue plaintiffs a\nreceipt for their green cards, tell them when they could expect them back if the cards were indeed authentic, or\ntell them where or how to inquire if they had any questions about the seizure.\nOn Monday, the day following the seizure of the documents, paralegal Arturo Ortiz contacted the OSHP on behalf\nof Aguilar and Esparza, but the OSHP could not help him because Ortiz lacked certain information regarding the\nincident. On Thursday, four days after the seizure, Ortiz obtained this required information from Aguilar and\nEsparza. He then contacted the OSHP and spoke to Trooper Kiefer. Trooper Kiefer delivered the green cards\nlater that same day.\nIn my September 8, 1999 Order, I granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to the issue of whether\nTrooper Kiefer violated the Fourth Amendment by retaining Aguilar's and Esparza's green cards for four days,\nand denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to all other issues and all other defendants. In addition, I\ngranted summary judgment in favor of defendants Marshall, Davies, Healy, Elling, Elders, Blue, Ambrose,\nBaronowski, Courtney, Laubacher, Piatarek, Pape, Stevens, Unger, and Williams, and denied Trooper Kiefer's\nmotion for summary judgment. Lastly, I dissolved the preliminary injunction I previously had granted. (Doc. 67).\nPlaintiffs now move this Court to reconsider the dismissal of their equal protection, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title VI\n[3]\nclaims.  In opposition, defendants raise two affirmative defenses, one based on standing and the other on the\napplicable statute of limitations.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nSummary judgment must be entered \"against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the\nexistence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at\ntrial.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The moving party\nalways bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those\nportions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Id. at 323, 106 S.Ct.\n2548. The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party who \"must set forth specific facts showing that there is a\ngenuine issue for trial.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202\n(1986) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)).\nOnce the burden of production shifts, the party opposing summary judgment cannot rest on its pleadings or\nmerely reassert its previous allegations. It is insufficient \"simply [to] show that there is some metaphysical doubt\nas to the material facts.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348,\n89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Rather, Rule 56(e) \"requires the nonmoving party to go beyond the [unverified] pleadings\"\nand present some type of evidentiary material in support of its position. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548.\n729 *729 In deciding the motion for summary judgment, the evidence of the non-moving party will be believed as true,\nall doubts will be resolved against the moving party, all evidence will be construed in the light most favorable to\nthe non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences will be drawn in the non-moving party's favor. Eastman\nKodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 456, 112 S.Ct. 2072, 119 L.Ed.2d 265 (1992).\nSummary judgment shall be rendered only if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\nthat the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).\nDISCUSSION\nI. Standing\nDefendants argue that I should not enjoin the OSHP from asking motorists about their immigration status on the\nbasis of their Hispanic appearance because Aguilar and Esparza, the class representatives, have no standing.\nAccording to defendants, Aguilar and Esparza lack standing to obtain equitable relief because they cannot show\n\nthat it is likely that they will be questioned about their immigration status and/or have their green cards seized\nagain at some future time. Thus, defendants assert, regardless of the merits of plaintiffs' equal protection, § 1983\nand Title VI claims, plaintiffs are not entitled to an injunction, either individually or on behalf of the class they seek\n[4]\nto represent.\nPlaintiffs disagree, citing evidence that suggests that it is the OSHP's policy to ask Hispanic-looking motorists\nwhether they have proper immigration papers. This, plaintiffs argue, proves that it is inevitable that some\nmembers of the class will be subject to ethnically discriminatory questioning, giving the class representatives\nstanding by proxy. In any event, plaintiffs observe that I already made a ruling on standing in their favor. (See\nDocs. 67 and 94).\nThose who seek to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts must satisfy Article III of the Constitution by\nalleging an actual case or controversy. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 94-101, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947\n(1968). An actual case or controversy is characterized by a \"personal stake in the outcome\" of a lawsuit; this\nrequirement assures that constitutional issues will be presented only when ripe for resolution. Baker v. Carr, 369\nU.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962). \"Abstract injury is not enough.\" City of Los Angeles v. Lyons,\n461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). A plaintiff must show that \"he has sustained or is\nimmediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury\" as a result of the challenged conduct; the injury or threat\nof injury must be \"real and immediate,\" not \"conjectural\" or \"hypothetical.\" Id. (citing Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S.\n103, 109-10, 89 S.Ct. 956, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969); United Public Workers of America v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75,\n89-91, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947); Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43\nS.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923)). Further, the injury must be one that is \"fairly traceable to the defendant's\nallegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" Kardules v. City of Columbus, 95\n730 F.3d 1335, 1352 (6th Cir.1996) (quoting *730Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556\n(1984)).\nSynthesizing these principles, the Supreme Court has articulated a three part test for a party to have standing to\nsue:\nOver the years, our cases have established that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\ncontains three elements: First, the plaintiff must have suffered `injury in fact'00an invasion of a\n97\nlegally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) `actual or imminent, not\nconjectural or hypothetical.' Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and\nthe conduct complained of00the injury has to be `fairly trace[able] to the challenged action of the\n97\ndefendant, and not ... [t]he result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the\ncourt.' Third, it must be `likely,' as opposed to merely `speculative,' that the injury will be\n`redressed by a favorable decision.'\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (citations omitted).\nThe party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing its standing. Id. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130.\nAs plaintiffs rightfully point out, I previously determined that plaintiffs had carried their burden. (Docs. 67 and 94).\nUpon reconsideration, however, my decision on standing requires clarification and revision.\nThe Supreme Court recognizes that there is not much that separates the injury in fact element of Article III\nstanding from the need to show \"likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury\" as a prerequisite to\nobtaining an injunction. O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495-96, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974) (the case\nor controversy elements under Article III \"shade into those determining whether the complaint states a sound\nbasis for equitable relief.\"). Given this overlap, courts (and parties) often combine Article III analysis and equitable\nrelief analysis. But it is important to keep in mind that these are two distinct inquiries, and that it is possible to\nhave standing to assert a claim for damages to redress past injury, while, at the same time, not have standing to\nenjoin the practice that gave rise to those damages. This may be so even if the practice is likely to continue. \nLyons, 461 U.S. at 105, 103 S.Ct. 1660 (just because a plaintiff may have standing to obtain damages to remedy\npast harm \"does nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that he again\" would be harmed, which is a\nnecessary precondition to having standing to seek an injunction).\n\nIndeed, that is the irony of this case and cases like it. There can be little dispute that Aguilar and Esparza have\nstanding to sue for damages on an equal protection theory because they allege they were asked about their\nimmigration status on the basis of their Hispanic appearance, and, further, had their green cards seized. (See\nDoc. 67 at pp. 2-3). To have standing to enjoin such race-based treatment, however, these named plaintiffs must\nshow that they are likely to be asked about their immigration status and/or have their green cards seized again at\nsome time in the reasonably near future. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 111, 103 S.Ct. 1660 (absent a showing that the\nplaintiff would again be wronged in a similar way, the plaintiff had no standing to pursue an injunction). See also \nEllis v. Dyson, 421 U.S. 426, 434, 95 S.Ct. 1691, 44 L.Ed.2d 274 (1975) (Article III required that plaintiffs show a\n\"credible\" and \"genuine\" threat that they again would be prosecuted under a challenged loitering law). While past\nwrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury, \"[p]ast exposure\nto illegal conduct does not in itself show a ... case or controversy\" sufficient to support an injunction. O'Shea, 414\nU.S. at 495-96, 94 S.Ct. 669.\n731 In light of the evidence propounded to date, I cannot find support for plaintiffs' *731 claim that Aguilar and\nEsparza likely will be stopped again, and again asked questions about their immigration status or have their\ngreen cards seized. Though Aguilar and Esparza both have relatives in Ohio, and represent that they expect to\n[5]\ntravel Ohio's highways in the future,  it is undisputed that during their past travels in Ohio, they only were\nstopped and questioned once. (See Amended Complaint at ¶ 8). They do not travel to or in Ohio on a regular\nbasis because they reside in Chicago, Illinois. (Id. at ¶ 34).\nAccepting as true plaintiffs' allegation that the OSHP systematically asks Hispanic-looking motorists about their\nimmigration status, and, as a matter of course, seizes green cards, none of this can happen unless a Hispanic\nmotorist is stopped. It is this contingent event that not only diminishes the chances that Aguilar and Esparza will\nbe repeat victims of the practice they challenge, it also might explain why they each were victims on only one\n[6]\noccasion in the past.\nThe plaintiffs' claim of standing in this case is similar to that of the plaintiff in City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461\nU.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). In Lyons, the plaintiff sued the City of Los Angeles and certain of\nits police officers, alleging that in 1976 he was stopped for a traffic violation, and, though he offered no\nresistance, the officers who stopped him applied a choke-hold. As a consequence of the officers' use of a choke-\nhold, the plaintiff alleged that he lost consciousness and suffered damage to his larynx. In addition to seeking\ndamages, his complaint sought injunctive relief against the City of Los Angeles and its police department to bar\nthe use of choke-holds except in situations where an arrestee reasonably appears to be threatening the use of\ndeadly force. The district court entered the injunction, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nThe Supreme Court vacated the injunction because the plaintiff did not have standing. Though the plaintiff had\nstanding to assert a damages claim, he could not obtain an injunction because it was unlikely that he again would\nbe subject to a choke-hold:\nLyons' standing to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to suffer\nfuture injury from the use of the choke-holds by police officers. ... That Lyons may have been\nillegally choked by the police on October 6, 1976, while presumably affording Lyons standing to\nclaim damages against the individual officers and perhaps against the City, does nothing to\nestablish a real and immediate threat that he would again be stopped for a traffic violation, or for\nany other offense, by an officer or officers who would illegally choke him into unconsciousness\nwithout any provocation on his part.\n* * * * * *\n732 In order to establish an actual controversy in case, Lyons would have had not *732 only to allege\nthat he would have another encounter with the police but also to make the incredible assertion\neither, (1) that all police officers in Los Angeles always choke any citizen with whom they happen\nto have an encounter, whether for the purpose of arrest, issuing a citation or for questioning or, (2)\nthat the City ordered or authorized police officers to act in such manner.\n\nId. at 105-06, 103 S.Ct. 1660 (emphasis added).\nTo be sure, the facts of Lyons are distinguishable from those in this case, because here Aguilar and Esparza do\nallege that 1) officers of the OSHP systematically ask all Hispanic appearing motorists, who are stopped for\nroutine traffic violations, whether they have proper immigration papers and/or confiscate those papers, and 2) the\nOSHP authorizes this practice. While important, these distinguishing allegations do not, however, show that\nAguilar and Esparza will \"have another encounter with the police.\" Id.\nIn Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc), the named plaintiffs' inability to show\nthat they would have another encounter with federal law enforcement officials prevented them from achieving\nstanding to seek an injunction. Plaintiffs in Hodgers-Durgin were a class of Hispanic motorists who alleged they\nwere stopped by the Border Patrol along the United States' border with Mexico on the basis of their Hispanic\nappearance. The class had two named plaintiffs. The first was a United States citizen living in Tucson, Arizona,\nwho described himself as having typically Hispanic features: black hair, dark skin and dark eyes. He traveled two\nor three days a week on I-19 between Tucson and the border town of Nogales. Despite the fact that he saw\nagents of the Border Patrol every time he traveled I-19, he only had been stopped once in a ten year period.\nThe second named plaintiff was a United States citizen who had been living in Rio Rico, Arizona, since 1985. She\ntestified that she had driven on I-19 from Rio Rico to Nogales00a distance of approximately 15 miles00at least four\n97 97\nor five times a week, and that whenever she did she saw the Border Patrol. Though she regularly saw agents of\nthe Border Patrol along I-19, she only had been stopped once in approximately ten years.\nBoth named plaintiffs sought an injunction to stop the Border Patrol from pulling over motorists who looked\nHispanic. The district court denied the request for an injunction on standing grounds. Upholding the denial of the\ninjunction, the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, agreed that neither named plaintiff could establish, based on having\nbeen stopped once, that he or she would be stopped in the future by the Border Patrol:\nBased on plaintiffs' own factual record, we believe that it is not sufficiently likely that ... [named\nplaintiffs] will again be stopped by the Border Patrol.\n* * * * * *\nAs the Supreme Court recently wrote, translating the language of injunctions and imminency into\nthe language of declaratory judgments and ripeness, `A claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests\non `contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\"\nWhether the named plaintiffs are likely to be stopped again by the Border Patrol is simply too\nspeculative to warrant an equitable judicial remedy, including declaratory relief, that would require,\nor provide a basis for requiring, that the Border Patrol change its practices.\nId. at 1044 (citations omitted). In a concurrence, Judge Reinhardt added that \"[i]n reality, all we hold in this case\nis that [the named plaintiffs] ... are not the right plaintiffs to have filed this class action,\" essentially inviting the\nsubstitution of new class representatives who had been stopped by the Border Patrol on multiple occasions. Id. at\n733 1047. Cf. Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 712, 97 S.Ct. 1428, *733 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977) (equitable relief was\navailable where plaintiff had been prosecuted three times for obscuring \"Live Free or Die\" motto on his license\nplate in a span of five weeks); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903\n(1983) (plaintiff who had been stopped fifteen times had standing to challenge an anti-loitering statute as\nunconstitutionally vague because there was a \"credible threat\" that he might be detained again).\nPlaintiffs here might have standing to obtain an injunction if they could either: 1) present evidence that Aguilar\nand Esparza have been stopped and asked about their immigration status with sufficient frequency to give rise to\na belief that such inquiries will be made of them in the future, or 2) substitute new class representatives who have\nbeen stopped and questioned with greater frequency than they have. Absent satisfaction of either of these\nrequirements, the current named plaintiffs, having been stopped but once, lack standing to seek equitable relief.\n[7]\n\nFinally, it is not enough that the unnamed class members, as a group, almost certainly will be subject to the\npractice in question: the named plaintiffs themselves must show that they are likely to become repeat victims. \nAllee v. Medrano, 416 U.S. 802, 828-29, 94 S.Ct. 2191, 40 L.Ed.2d 566 (1974) (\"A named plaintiff cannot acquire\nstanding to sue by bringing his action on behalf of others who suffered injury which would have afforded them\nstanding had they been named plaintiffs; .... Standing cannot be acquired through the back door of a class\naction.\"). See also Hodgers-Durgin, 199 F.3d at 1040 (quoting Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357, 116 S.Ct.\n2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996)) (\"That a suit may be a class action ... adds nothing to the question of standing, for\neven named plaintiffs who represent a class `must alleged and show that they personally have been injured, not\nthe injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they\npurport to represent.'\"). Thus, the prospect that unnamed class members are likely to be questioned about their\nimmigration status (and have their green cards taken) cannot provide a basis for Aguilar and Esparza to seek an\ninjunction.\nIn sum, I find that Aguilar and Esparza do not have standing to seek an injunction to prevent the OSHP from\nasking Hispanic-looking motorists about their immigration status and/or confiscating immigration papers.\nII. Equal Protection\nPlaintiffs allege that the OSHP routinely interrogates Hispanic motorists about their immigration status, and, in\nsome cases, confiscates immigration documents, solely on the basis of race or national origin. Such practice,\n734 plaintiffs argue, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the *734 Fourteenth Amendment, notwithstanding my\nprevious ruling on searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment. Defendants respond that plaintiffs have\nfailed to prove facts that would support their claims, and deny treating Hispanic motorists differently than\nmotorists of any other race or ethnicity.\nCitizens are entitled to equal protection of the laws at all times. Central to the notion of equal protection is \"the\nprevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race.\" Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239, 96\nS.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). Law enforcement is quintessentially official conduct00the police function being\n97\n\"one of the basic functions of government.\" Foley v. Connelie, 435 U.S. 291, 297, 98 S.Ct. 1067, 55 L.Ed.2d 287\n(1978). \"If law enforcement adopts a policy, employs a practice, or in a given situation takes steps to initiate an\ninvestigation of a citizen based solely upon that citizen's race, without more, then a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause has occurred.\" United States v. Avery, 137 F.3d 343, 355 (6th Cir.1997). See also United\nStates v. Taylor, 956 F.2d 572, 578 (6th Cir.1992) (\"[A] general practice or pattern that primarily targeted\nminorities\" would give rise to \"due process and equal protection constitutional implications cognizable by this\ncourt.\"); United States v. Jennings, 985 F.2d 562, 1993 WL 5927, at *4 (6th Cir. Jan.13, 1993) (unpublished\nopinion) (\"A law enforcement officer would be acting unconstitutionally were he to ... consensually interview a\nperson of color solely because of that person's color, absent a compelling justification.\").\n\"A person cannot become the target of a police investigation solely on the basis of skin color.\" Avery, 137 F.3d at\n354. Accordingly, the Fourteenth Amendment provides citizens a degree of protection independent of the Fourth\nAmendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. Id. at 352.\nTo prevail under the Equal Protection Clause, the victim of discrimination \"must prove the decision makers in his\ncase acted with discriminatory purpose.\" McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 292, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262\n(1987). \"Determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor\" behind a law enforcement\nofficer's actions \"demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be\navailable.\" Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266, 97 S.Ct.\n555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). See also Avery, 137 F.3d at 355 (\"Often, it is difficult to prove directly the invidious\nuse of race ... Accordingly, discrimination can be proved through direct evidence, which seldom exists, or\ninferences ... drawn from ... circumstantial evidence.\").\nThe burden rests on plaintiffs to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they were treated differently than\nsimilarly situated non-minorities. Jennings, 985 F.2d 562, 1993 WL at *4. Once such a prima facie case is made,\nthe burden shifts to defendants to either 1) rebut the presumption of unconstitutional action by articulating a race-\n\nneutral reason for its action, or 2) identify a compelling government interest for its race-based conduct. Id. (citing \nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 270-71 n. 20, 97 S.Ct. 555). See also Avery, 137 F.3d at 356 (\"Once a prima facie\ncase is established ..., the government must articulate a race-neutral reason for its action, or identify a compelling\ngovernmental interest in the race-based interviews.\").\nBecause I find that plaintiffs have satisfied their prima facie burden, and because defendants' rebuttal is\ninsufficient as a matter of law, plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration is well taken.\nA. Plaintiffs' Prima Facie Evidence\nPlaintiffs cite evidence which, they allege, indicates a pattern and practice of questioning Hispanic motorists on\n735 the basis *735 of their appearance. Plaintiffs highlight the testimony of Lieutenant William D. Healy, a twenty-two\nyear veteran of the OSHP. Since June 1992, Lt. Healy has served as the coordinator of the TDIT. In that position,\nLt. Healy has been responsible for providing guidance, direction, supervision, and training for all TDIT officers. Lt.\nHealy's duties include monitoring the quality of the TDIT. (Healy Dep. at 18).\nBeginning in 1995, the OSHP00particularly its TDIT unit00began taking a more active role in the enforcement of\n97 97\nfederal immigration laws. According to Lt. Healy, after determining that an individual may be an illegal immigrant,\na member of the OSHP will contact the Border Patrol and detain the suspect until the Border Patrol arrives. (Id. at\n23). By Lt. Healy's admission, the OSHP has detained hundreds of motorists who were suspected to be illegally\nin the United States following routine traffic stops; such detention, in all likelihood, was precipitated by answers\ngiven to questions regarding the motorists' immigration status. (Id. at 20).\nLt. Healy acknowledged that the OSHP has been known to inquire into motorists' immigration status during\nroutine traffic stops. According to Lt. Healy, a driver might be asked about his immigration status because an\nofficer would \"like to know whether or not you have a legal right to be here....\" (Healy Dep. at 51). Lt. Healy\napproved of officers inspecting immigration documents, stating that \"I would have no problem with a Trooper\nasking to see the alien registration card ... it's a consensual encounter.\" (Id. at 60).\nLt. Healy further testified that he is aware of officers seizing alien registration cards, some of which were later\ndetermined to be legitimate. (Id. at 32). Although such seizures are \"not a common occurrence,\" Lt. Healy\nadmitted that the OSHP has, in fact, seized legitimate immigration documents and delivered those documents to\nfederal authorities. (Id. at 32, 70). Lt. Healy indicated during his testimony that there are no plans for the TDIT,\nwhich he runs, to change its policies. (Id. at 114-16).\nMembers of the OSHP receive little or no training in the area of federal immigration law. Lt. Healy testified that he\nonce arranged for the TDIT to sponsor a training session on the identification of fraudulent immigration\ndocuments. (Id. at 12-15, 34). Only TDIT officers participated in this training. (Id. at 14). The two-hour session did\nnot, however, address substantive issues related to immigration. (Hrg. at 288-90).\nBecause only one training session of this sort has been held, no TDIT officer joining the OSHP after April 1993\nhas received any formal training in the identification of fraudulent immigration documents, let alone in the\nassessment of what articulable facts would suggest that a motorist is an illegal immigrant. (Healy Dep. at 55,\n96-97, 101-04; Hrg. at 290). Indeed, Lt. Healy himself testified that he does not know how to tell if a motorist is an\nalien, having not the \"foggiest idea\" what an alien might look like. (Healy Dep. at 30-31).\nGiven defendants' admitted lack of training in the identification of illegal immigrants, the only reasoned basis on\nwhich to question a motorist about immigration status, plaintiffs argue, is the motorist's Hispanic appearance\ncoupled with indicators of Hispanic ethnicity, such as 1) inability to speak English, or 2) appearing to be a migrant\nworker.\nPlaintiffs point out that Sergeant Bruce Elling (a supervisor in the TDIT) testified that the vast majority of green\ncards examined and seized by the TDIT belonged to Hispanic motorists; in fact, Sgt. Elling was not aware of any\ngreen cards being seized from non-Hispanics. (Elling Dep at 68; see also Stockman Dep. at 44-45; Kiefer Dep. at\n77; Smart Dep at 64). According to William Mitchell, the supervisor of all Border Patrol personnel working in\n\n736 northwestern Ohio, more than 90 percent *736 of the OSHP's immigration inquiries \"concern[ed] Hispanics.\"\n(Mitchell Dec. at 2).\nMoreover, the TDIT provides officers with a list of immigration related questions in English along with their\nSpanish translations, but there is no evidence that such translations are provided in any other languages.\n(Baranowski Dep. at 72-73). Some deposed officers testified that they were under the impression that one must\nspeak English to be a United States citizen. According to Sgt. Elling: \"I mean, if [motorists] don't speak [English]\nat all, I mean that's definitely an indicator of something amiss because you have to speak English to become an\nAmerican citizen.\" (Elling Dep. at 35, 60-61). Lt. Barry Elder echoed Sgt. Elling's sentiments, testifying that one\nmust speak English to be a citizen of the United States and/or a permanent resident alien. (Elder Dep. at 67).\nTrooper Smart similarly thought that fluency in English was a prerequisite to obtaining citizenship. (Smart Dep.\nat). And Trooper Kiefer testified that if he has a hard time understanding what drivers or passengers are saying or\nif they have a hard time understanding him, he will ask for a green card. (Kiefer Dep. at 39, 60-61, 172-74).\nIn addition, Lt. Elder testified he became suspicious that a motorist was an illegal alien if the motorist was going\nto pick crops, was coming from Florida or Texas, had little money, was driving an older vehicle, and/or was\nwearing old clothes. (Elder Dep. at 49-53). Plaintiffs argue that this describes the typical migrant worker, who in\nalmost every case is of Hispanic descent. Further, plaintiffs argue that these are precisely the factors courts have\ndisfavored as giving rise to an inference that a motorist is illegally in the country. See Ramirez v. Webb, 599\nF.Supp. 1278, 1283 (W.D.Mich.1984) (a motorist's ethnic appearance, the condition of his car, the manner in\nwhich he dresses, and the presence of out-of-state plates on his car \"cannot justify the subjugation of individual\nrights.\").\nPlaintiffs also cite the testimony of Trooper Kiefer, who testified that when he found Hispanic passengers hiding\nunder a blanket, he called the Border Patrol, but that if he found white people hiding under a blanket, he would\nnot. (Kiefer Dep. at 83). Sgt. Elling likewise testified that he would not call the Border Patrol regarding a motorist\n\"unless [he] would think that they would probably be Hispanic in nature.\" (Elling Dep. at 33-34). And Trooper Pahl\nadmitted that she once had contacted the Border Patrol after coming across two Hispanic men whose car had\nbroken down, but that she wouldn't do the same for a white man. (Pahl Dep. at 37).\nTo further illustrate what they believe to be the OSHP's race-based investigatory tactics, plaintiffs have introduced\na videotape (with audio) showing the stop of a Hispanic motorist, Heriberto Navarro, and his two Hispanic\npassengers. Navarro was pulled over for driving slightly above the speed limit. The videotape shows Navarro,\nwho speaks accented English, conversing with Trooper Kiefer after Trooper Kiefer approached the passenger's\nside of the stopped car. Next, Navarro and his passengers provided their California driver's licenses to Trooper\nKiefer on his request to see photo identification. Trooper Kiefer then questioned Navarro about his destination.\nNavarro answered by stating that he was driving to Michigan for vacation. Trooper Kiefer informed Navarro that\nhe was going to let him off for the speeding violation, but that he first had to run the licenses through a police\ncomputer. At this point, Trooper Kiefer walked away from Navarro's car toward his patrol car. After two or three\nsteps, however, Trooper Kiefer turned back to ask Navarro where he was born and whether he and his\npassengers were in possession of permanent resident alien cards.\nPlaintiffs believe the videotape demonstrates that Navarro and his companions were questioned about their\n737 immigration *737 status solely on the basis of their Hispanic appearance, because nothing about their conduct\nsuggested that they were in the country illegally; indeed, Trooper Kiefer had been prepared to release Navarro so\nlong as Navarro's license cleared.\nDefendants counter that while plaintiffs' evidence shows that in some cases Hispanic motorists have been asked\nabout their immigration status, no evidence presented thus far indicates that Hispanic motorists are treated\ndifferently than non-Hispanic motorists. This, defendants emphasize, is the key equal protection issue, given that\nI already have decided that it is legitimate for officers, under the Fourth Amendment, to question motorists about\ntheir immigration status during the time it takes to complete a lawful traffic stop. (Doc. 109 at 4). In other words,\ndefendants argue that unless plaintiffs have evidence showing that Aguilar and Esparza were singled out, the\nmere fact that Hispanic motorists have been subject to questions regarding their immigration status does not\nprove an equal protection violation.\n\nDefendants' theory does not fit the facts of this case. Plaintiffs have introduced direct evidence that Hispanic\nmotorists are treated differently than white motorists. Trooper Kiefer, Sgt. Elling, and Trooper Pahl all testified\nthat, in their experience, they would refer Hispanic motorists to the Border Patrol when, in precisely the same\ncircumstances, they would not refer someone who was white (i.e., not of Hispanic appearance).\nMoreover, inferential evidence of a discriminatory practice is more than enough. See Avery, 137 F.3d at 355\n(\"`Necessarily, an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of relevant facts ....'\")\n(quoting Washington, 426 U.S. at 242, 96 S.Ct. 2040). Here, such inferential evidence abounds. Almost all\nmotorists whose green cards were seized were Hispanic. It would not be illogical to conclude from this, together\nwith other evidence presented by plaintiffs, that most motorists (including Aguilar and Esparza) asked about their\ngreen cards were Hispanic-looking. Further, defendants' lack of training in the area of immigration law, and their\nseeming inability to articulate what might give rise to a reasonable suspicion that a motorist is illegally in the\ncountry, make it highly plausible that racial stereotyping influences the kinds of questions an officer chooses to\nask during a traffic stop. This is particularly true where so many officers are misinformed about the language skills\nrequired for citizenship, and many of the migrant workers subjected to questioning have difficulty speaking\nEnglish.\nFinally, the circumstances surrounding the stop of Aguilar and Esparza help establish plaintiffs' prima facie case.\nDefendants argue that the seizure of Aguilar's and Esparza's immigration documents can be explained by the\n\"alert\" of a drugsniffing dog immediately before their documents were taken from them. But the potential\npresence of drugs in a motorist's car says nothing about the likelihood that the motorist is an illegal immigrant.\nDefendants admit as much. Lt. Healy testified that there is no correlation between the possession of drugs and\nbeing illegally in the country, a view shared by other OSHP officers. (Healy Dep. at 106; see also Baranowski\nDep. at 105-06; Elling Dep. at 25; Laubacher Dep. at 70). If there is no such correlation, the alert cannot justify\nquestions about immigration. Yet, beyond the dog alert, defendants have articulated no reason why Aguilar and\nEsparza were asked for their green cards.\nIn sum, I find that plaintiffs have satisfied their prima facie burden that the OSHP discriminates against Hispanic\nmotorists in its immigration questioning, and, more specifically, have demonstrated that Trooper Kiefer deprived\nAguilar and Esparza of their equal protection rights.\nB. Defendants' Rebuttal\nTo rebut plaintiffs' prima facie case, defendants must 1) articulate a race-neutral reason for their action, or 2)\n738 identify a *738 compelling government interest for their race-based conduct. Avery, 137 F.3d at 356. Defendants\nhave done neither.\nNo defendant has explained what race-neutral criteria are used to determine whether a motorist should be asked\nto produce immigration documents. While defendants deny taking action based on the race or national origin of\nan individual, more than a disavowal of discriminatory conduct is required. Defendants are obligated to articulate\nthe race-neutral, precipitating factors behind questions relating to a motorist's immigration status. They have not\ndone so.\nIn the alternative, defendants have the option of providing a compelling government interest for acknowledged\nrace-based conduct. Defendants, however, have shied away from this option, steadfastly maintaining that their\nactions are not race-based.\nIn sum, defendants have failed to satisfy their rebuttal burden. Aguilar and Esparza, to the extent they can satisfy\nthe requirements of § 1983 and Title VI, are entitled to summary judgment on their equal protection claims.\nIII. 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n[8]\nThere are numerous individual defendants in this case.  Section 1983 requires Aguilar and Esparza (as class\nrepresentatives) to establish a causal connection between their injuries and each defendant's conduct. Absent\n\nsuch link, no liability may attach, despite defendants' collective inability to rebut plaintiffs' evidence of\ndiscrimination. Horn v. Madison County Fiscal Court, 22 F.3d 653, 659 (6th Cir.1994) (citing Doe v. Sullivan\nCounty, Tennessee, 956 F.2d 545, 550 (6th Cir.1992)) (\"A violation of a federally secured right is remediable in\ndamages only upon proof that the violation proximately caused injury.\").\nFurther, defendants are sued in varying capacities: some are sued as officials while others are sued as\nindividuals. And some are sued for active participation in the stop of Aguilar and Esparza while others are sued\nbecause they exercised supervisory authority. Depending on the capacity in which a defendant is sued, different\nimmunity rules apply. Issues of causation and immunity, moreover, often intertwine in § 1983 analysis.\nTo establish a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must prove: 1) that conduct was committed by a defendant acting\nunder the color of state law, and 2) the defendant's conduct deprived the plaintiff of rights, privileges, or\nimmunities secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States. Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640,\n100 S.Ct. 1920, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980); Sargi v. Kent City Board of Educ., 70 F.3d 907, 913 (6th Cir.1995). It is\naxiomatic that equal protection falls within the ambit of \"rights, privileges, or immunities\" § 1983 was designed to\npreserve. See, e.g., French v. Heyne, 547 F.2d 994, 997 (7th Cir.1976) (\"Redress for denial of equal protection is\navailable under § 1983.\").\nThe following subsections consider plaintiffs' evidence of causation with respect to each defendant, and\ndetermine whether any defendants are entitled to immunity.\n1. Trooper Kiefer: Sued In His Individual Capacity\nTrooper Kiefer physically participated in the questioning of Aguilar and Esparza, and he confiscated their green\ncards. Plaintiffs seek to hold him personally liable. Trooper Kiefer claims qualified immunity.\nWhen public officials are sued for damages under § 1983 in their individual capacities, they can assert qualified\n739 immunity. Stack v. Killian, 96 F.3d 159, 161 (6th Cir.1996). Officials are entitled to *739 qualified immunity so long\nas their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457\nU.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); Christophel v. Kukulinsky, 61 F.3d 479, 484 (6th Cir. 1995)\n. \"The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable officer would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that right.\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987).\nWhether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable turns on the \"objective legal\nreasonableness\" of his acts. Johnson v. Estate of Laccheo, 935 F.2d 109, 111 (6th Cir.1991).\nA court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity \"must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the\ndeprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if so, proceed to determine whether that right was clearly\nestablished at the time of the alleged violation.\" Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 290, 119 S.Ct. 1292, 143\nL.Ed.2d 399 (1999). \"Deciding the constitutional question before addressing the qualified immunity question\npromotes clarity in the legal standards for official conduct, to the benefit of both officers and the general public.\" \nWilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999).\nHere, there can be no dispute that Trooper Kiefer should have understood, in 1995, that questioning motorists\nabout their immigration status on the basis of their race or ethnicity was unconstitutional. For well over 100 years,\na bedrock principal of our constitutional democracy has been that people should be treated equally under the law,\nand that government actors cannot treat individuals differently bases on their ethnic background. Yick Wo v.\nHopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373-74, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886). Accordingly, the Sixth Circuit has admonished\nthe police not to \"unevenly apply the laws against a citizen because of his race....\" Gardenhire v. Schubert, 205\nF.3d 303, 320 (6th Cir.2000). Indeed, the Gardenhire court held that by 1996 it had long been \"clearly established\nthat police officers could not selectively enforce ... [the] laws based on racial distinctions.\" Id. The same can be\nsaid for 1995, when Aguilar and Esparza were stopped. Thus, Trooper Kiefer has no immunity from suit.\nFurther, Trooper Kiefer's conduct clearly resulted in the injuries claimed by Aguilar and Esparza, supporting a\ncausal connection.\n\nIn sum, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment00on Aguilar's and Esparza's § 1983 claims that they were\n97\ndeprived of their equal protection rights00shall be granted as to Trooper Kiefer.\n97\n2. Defendants Marshall, Healy, Elling And Elders: Sued In Their\nOfficial Capacities\nPlaintiffs sued defendants Marshall, Healy, Elling and Elders in their official capacities to obtain an injunction. (\nSee Amended Complaint at ¶¶ 18, 20-22). As previously discussed, however, Aguilar and Esparza do not have\nstanding to obtain injunctive relief. Thus, plaintiffs' claims against defendants Marshall, Healy, Elling and Elders in\ntheir official capacities shall be dismissed.\n3. Defendants Marshall, Davies, Healy, Elling And Elders: Sued As\nSupervisors In Their Individual Capacities\nAlthough Aguilar and Esparza do not claim that Marshall, Davies, Healy, Elling and Elders participated in their\nstop, plaintiffs seek to impose liability on them personally as the supervisors of Trooper Kiefer, who was involved.\nSupervisory officials may not be found vicariously liable for the actions of their subordinates under § 1983. Monell\nv. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 691-694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); Rizzo v. Goode,\n740 423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976). To *740 hold a supervisor liable, a plaintiff must demonstrate\nthat the supervisor \"either encouraged the specific incident of misconduct or in some other way directly\nparticipated in it.\" Sova v. City of Mt. Pleasant, 142 F.3d 898, 904 (6th Cir. 1998); Swales v. Township of\nRavenna, 989 F.Supp. 925, 938 (N.D.Ohio 1997). Thus, at minimum, plaintiffs in this case must show that\nMarshall, Davies, Healy, Elling and Elders \"implicitly authorized, approved or knowingly acquiesced\" in the\ndeprivation of Aguilar's and Esparza's constitutional rights. Bellamy v. Bradley, 729 F.2d 416, 421 (6th Cir.1984); \nHays v. Jefferson County, Kentucky, 668 F.2d 869, 874 (6th Cir.1982). This ensures that supervisors sought to be\nheld accountable actually \"caused\" the deprivation at issue. Doe v. Claiborne County, Tennessee, 103 F.3d 495,\n511 (6th Cir. 1996).\nFurther, when the allegation is that a supervisor improperly trained a subordinate, the supervisor may be liable\nonly where his failure to train evinces \"deliberate indifference\" to the public. Sova, 142 F.3d at 904 (citing City of\nCanton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989)).\nHere, plaintiffs argue that the discriminatory treatment of Hispanic motorists was wide-spread within the OSHP.\nThat such an atmosphere developed under the supervision of Marshall, Davies, Healy, Elling and Elders reflects,\nin plaintiffs' view, that they authorized, approved or knowingly acquiesced in race-based immigration questioning.\nPlaintiffs submit that Trooper Kiefer adopted investigatory tactics that he and his fellow patrolmen learned from\nmore experienced officers, including their supervisors. It is improbable, plaintiffs claim, that Trooper Kiefer's\nactions did not comport with the OSHP's general practices. Rather, it is more likely that Trooper Kiefer simply was\ndoing what his supervisors' implicitly sanctioned.\nMore generally, plaintiffs allege that defendants Marshall, Davies, Healy, Elling and Elders cannot distance\nthemselves from Trooper Kiefer when they did practically nothing to train him in how to identify illegal immigrants\nin a race-neutral manner. Plaintiffs contend that these supervisors directed the OSHP's rank and file to enforce\nfederal immigration laws more aggressively, without avoiding, through training, the likelihood that racial bias\nwould influence their decisions in the field. In plaintiffs' view, this set the stage for Trooper Kiefer's handling of the\n[9]\nstop of Aguilar and Esparza.\nDefendants respond by adducing evidence that Marshall, Davies, Healy, Elling and Elders did not participate,\n741 directly, in *741 Aguilar's and Esparza's stop, and therefore could not have authorized or approved of it. (Docs. 84\nand 93).\n\nI find there to be a genuine factual dispute whether Marshall, Davies, Healy, Elling and Elders \"implicitly\nauthorized, approved or knowingly acquiesced\" in the deprivation of Aguilar's and Esparza's constitutional rights.\nThere is sufficient evidence to suggest that, at all supervisory levels of the OSHP, patrolmen (including Trooper\nKiefer) were encouraged to ask Hispanic motorists about their immigration status. However, this evidence is not\nenough to support summary judgment in plaintiffs' favor. Therefore, this issue shall be left for a jury to resolve,\n[10]\nand the parties' respective motions for summary judgment shall be denied.\n4. Troopers Ambrose, Blue, Baranowski, Courtney, Laubacher,\nPiatarek, Pape, Stevens, Unger and Williams: Sued In Their Individual\nCapacities\nPlaintiffs have sued Troopers Ambrose, Blue, Baranowski, Courtney, Laubacher, Piatarek, Pape, Stevens, Unger\nand Williams in their individual capacities. None of these Troopers, however, participated in Trooper Kiefer's stop\nof Aguilar and Esparza, and plaintiffs do not allege that these Troopers exercised supervisory responsibility. That\nthey may have interrogated unnamed class members on race-based grounds does not establish a causal link to\nAguilar and Esparza. Therefore, plaintiffs' § 1983 claims of deprivation of equal protection shall be dismissed as\nto Troopers Ambrose, Blue, Baranowski, Courtney, Laubacher, Piatarek, Pape, Stevens, Unger and Williams.\nIV. Title VI\nPlaintiffs allege that the OSHP has engaged in a pattern and practice of questioning Hispanic-looking motorists\non the basis of their Hispanic appearance in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 42 U.S.C. §\n2000d, et seq. Title VI provides:\nNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded\nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any\nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\nId.\nThe Supreme Court has noted that Congress \"understood Title VI as authorizing an implied private right of action\nfor victims of the prohibited discrimination.\" Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 703, 99 S.Ct. 1946,\n60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \"The proper defendant in a Title VI case is an entity rather than an individual.\" Farmer v.\nRamsay, 41 F.Supp.2d 587, 592 (D.Md.1999) (citing Jackson v. Katy Independent School District, 951 F.Supp.\n1293 (S.D.Tex.1996)). See also Buchanan v. City of Bolivar, Tennessee, 99 F.3d 1352, 1356 (6th Cir. 1996)\n(\"Plaintiff's claim ... fails because she asserts her claim against Lawson and Weaver and not against the school,\nthe entity allegedly receiving financial assistance.\"). To maintain a private right of action under Title VI, a plaintiff\nmust prove that he was victimized by a \"program or activity\" that received federal funds. Buchanan, 99 F.3d at\n1356. There must be a nexus between the alleged discriminatory conduct and the specific program to which\nfederal funds were directed. David K. v. Lane, 839 F.2d 1265, 1275-76 (7th Cir.1988). See also 42 U.S.C. §\n2000d-1 (\"Compliance with any requirement pursuant to [Title VI] ... shall be limited in its effect to the particular\nprogram, or part thereof, in which ... non-compliance has been so found.\").\n742 *742 A \"program or activity\" is defined as \"all the operations of\" a \"department, agency, ... or other instrumentality\nof a State or of a local government.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-4a(1)(A). The immunity conferred upon the states by the\nEleventh Amendment does not apply to violations of Title VI. Id. at § 2000d-7(1); Franks v. Kentucky School for\nthe Deaf, 142 F.3d 360, 362-63 (6th Cir.1998).\nSome courts have found that \"Congress did not intend to extend protection under Title VI to any person other\nthan an intended beneficiary of federal financial assistance.\" Simpson v. Reynolds Metals Co., Inc., 629 F.2d\n1226, 1235 (7th Cir.1980). See also Scelsa v. City University of New York, 806 F.Supp. 1126, 1140\n(S.D.N.Y.1992) (\"[T]o establish standing to sue under ... [Title VI] plaintiffs must be the intended beneficiaries of\n\nthe federal spending program.\"). This interpretation reads Title VI too narrowly. By its plain language, Title VI\naffords protection to persons \"subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\" receiving federal funds.\nThus, even if Aguilar and Esparza were not the intended beneficiaries of money flowing to the OSHP (as\nemployees, for instance), they nevertheless can bring a Title VI claim on the grounds that the OSHP qualifies as\n[11]\na \"program or activity\" that allegedly subjected them to discrimination.\n[12]\nThe issue, then, is how the OSHP spends its federal funds.  Use of funds is critical because there must be\nsome connection between the plaintiffs' unequal treatment and the federal funds received by the OSHP. David K.\nv. Lane, 839 F.2d at 1275-76.\nPlaintiffs have presented evidence that the OSHP receives substantial federal funding. In fiscal years 1995, 1996,\nand 1997, the OSHP received over $5.6 million from the federal government. (See Defendants' Response to\nInterr. 3). Moreover, Lt. Healy testified that during 1992 and 1993, the TDIT received a $100,000 federal grant,\nwhich was used for overtime pay and to purchase equipment. (Healy Dep. at 5-7). Other than this $100,000\ngrant, however, Lt. Healy does not believe the TDIT has received any federal money. Id. Plaintiffs have not\nintroduced any evidence beyond the testimony of Lt. Healy regarding federal funding to the TDIT.\nA single $100,000 grant to the TDIT, which was spent in 1992 and 1993, is not enough to establish that the TDIT\nwas a federally funded \"program or activity\" in 1995, when Aguilar and Esparza were stopped and had their\ngreen cards seized. Further, though the TDIT is a unit of the OSHP, plaintiffs have offered no proof that the TDIT\nis one of the specific programs to which the OSHP channeled its federal money. David K., 839 F.2d at 1275-76.\nThe only evidence of distribution comes from the National Highway Transportation Safety Board, which indicates\nthat the OSHP relied on assistance from the federal government to pay for overtime hours spent targeting crash-\ncausing violations (such as speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol) and enforcing commercial\nvehicle regulations. (See Defendants' Response to Interr. 3).\nThere is no evidence that these funds were allocated to the TDIT. David K., 839 F.2d at 1275-76 (plaintiffs' broad\n743 assumption that an entire prison system benefits *743 when one of its programs receives federal funds00thereby\n97\ncausing the entire prison system to be subject to Title VI regulation 00was not supported absent proof of such\n97\nbenefit). In fact, defendants have propounded evidence that the TDIT is (and always has been) funded out of\nOhio's general operating budget, which, in turn, raises money through gas taxes. Plaintiffs have not rebutted this\ncontention.\nThus, Aguilar and Esparza can prevail on their Title VI claims only by demonstrating some nexus between 1) the\n$5.6 million used by the OSHP on overtime pay to reduce crash-causing violations and regulate commercial\nvehicles, and 2) their stop on March 26, 1995. Id. Plaintiffs argue that such a nexus exists. I disagree.\nOf course, there are many fathomable reasons why the availability of federal funds for overtime pay might\nredound to the benefit of all law enforcement activities, even if the primary purpose of having officers work\novertime (as in this case) is to address specific concerns, such as automobile crashes and commercial vehicle\nregulation. One could speculate that the more money the OSHP has for overtime the more OSHP officers will be\npatrolling Ohio's highways. Thus, federal money dedicated to overtime conceivably could result in an increase in\nthe number of traffic stops that would have occurred without federal assistance. From this postulation, plaintiffs\nconclude that federal funding earmarked for overtime pay has impacted the number of Hispanic motorists\nquestioned about their immigration status by the OSHP, including Aguilar and Esparza.\nPlaintiffs' argument, however, is conjectural. There is no evidence of how the OSHP used its federal money to\ntarget crash causing violations and/or regulate commercial vehicles. The record contains no evidence that the\nOSHP used federal funds to increase the number of officers on routine patrol. Moreover, there is no evidence that\nthe $5.6 million had any residual effect on the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Particularly, plaintiffs\nhave failed to show that Trooper Kiefer's stop of Aguilar and Esparza was made possible, in whole or in part, by\nfederal funding.\nIn sum, there is insufficient support for the claim of a nexus between the OSHP's federal funding and any equal\nprotection violation. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on its Title VI claims, therefore, shall be denied as to\n[13]\nthe OSHP.\n\nV. Statute Of Limitations\nDefendants argue that the two year statute of limitations on civil rights actions bars the claims of Aguilar and\nEsparza. (Doc. 120 at 4-5). According to defendants, the statute of limitations began running on March 26, 1995,\nthe date Trooper Kiefer stopped Aguilar and Esparza. Plaintiffs filed their class action suit on September 18,\n1996, but Aguilar and Esparza were not added as named plaintiffs until June 1997. Thus, defendants argue,\nAguilar and Esparza asserted their claims two months too late.\n\"The commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members\nof the class.\" Crown, Cork & Seal Co., Inc. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 353-54, 103 S.Ct. 2392, 76 L.Ed.2d 628\n(1983) (citing American Pipe & Const. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 554, 94 S.Ct. 756, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974)).\nOnce the statute of limitations has been tolled, it remains tolled for all putative class members until certification is\nresolved. Id.\nIn light of Parker, the two year statute of limitations was suspended for Aguilar and Esparza (and all other class\n744 members) *744 as of September 18, 199600eighteen months after Aguilar and Esparza were stopped.\n97\nAccordingly, defendants' statute of limitations argument has no merit.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, on reconsideration of my September 8, 1999 Order, it is hereby\nORDERED THAT\n1) Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their § 1983 claims against Trooper Kiefer is\ngranted;\n2) Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their § 1983 claims against defendants Marshall,\nHealy, Elling and Elders (in their official capacities) is denied;\n3) Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their § 1983 claims against defendants Marshall,\nDavies, Healy, Elling and Elders (as supervisors in their individual capacities) is denied; and\n4) Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their Title VI claims is denied.\nSo ordered.\n[1] It later was determined that the dog had alerted in error, and that neither Aguilar nor Esparza were carrying\ndrugs.\n[2] It is undisputed that Esparza and Aguilar have difficulty communicating in English and the exchange with\nTrooper Kiefer took place in English.\n[3] Plaintiffs correctly point out that my September 8, 1999 Order does not address these issues, which were\nraised in their original motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 77). Thereafter, the parties' subsequent briefs focused\nexclusively on the Fourth Amendment, as did my September 8, 1999 Order.\n[4] Plaintiffs filed a class action complaint, which later was amended. (Doc. 44). Aguilar and Esparza were added\nas class representatives in the amended complaint. (Id. at ¶ 8). On May 15, 1998, plaintiffs moved to have the\nclass certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Doc. 78). Plaintiffs proposed\nthat the class be defined as \"all current and future Hispanic motorists and/or passengers traveling in Ohio, who\nare involved in traffic stops by officers, agents or employees of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, and are\nquestioned about immigration matters, or suffer the seizure of their lawfully issued immigration documents.\" (Id.\nat 3). In my August 17, 1998 Order, I certified the class as proposed by plaintiffs. (Doc. 94).\n\n[5] Aguilar and Esparza attested in affidavits that they visit relatives in Toledo, Ohio, approximately 3-4 times per\nyear.\n[6] Aguilar's and Esparza's standing with regard to future stops is weakened further by the fact that their stop on\nMarch 26, 1995 was lawful. In fact, no stop of any plaintiff in this case has been shown to have occurred without\nantecedent observation of a traffic violation, and, significantly, there has been no evidence of racial profiling in the\ninitial stopping of Hispanic motorists. Thus, Aguilar and Esparza cannot prove imminency of future injury unless\nthey assert that they will again commit traffic violations for which they expect to be stopped. Where a party can\nprevent all risk of constitutional injury by controlling his conduct (without sacrificing any of his rights, privileges, or\nimmunities), his claim of standing, which is predicated on a future unlawful act on his part, is of dubious\nlegitimacy. See, e.g., O'Shea, 414 U.S. at 497, 94 S.Ct. 669 (\"[I]t seems to us that attempting to anticipate\nwhether and when these respondents will be charged with a crime ... takes us into the area of speculation and\nconjecture.... We assume that respondents will conduct their activities within the law and so avoid ... exposure to\nthe challenged course of conduct....\").\n[7] There is one named plaintiff, Merced Valdez, a United States citizen and resident of Ohio, who alleges three\ninstances where he was stopped and questioned about his immigration status. Because he was stopped three\ntimes, Valdez is able to make a strong argument that he likely will be stopped again in the future. Valdez,\nhowever, has a different standing problem, as I detailed in my June 24, 1997 Order: he is unable to trace the\ntimes he was stopped and questioned to the OSHP. (See Doc. 31 at 7). During cross examination at an\nevidentiary hearing held November 21-22, 1996, (Docs. 26-27 [Hrg.]), Valdez testified that the first time he was\nstopped and asked to produce documentation of citizenship, an officer of the Defiance, Ohio police\ndepartment00not the OSHP00conducted the stop. (Hrg. at 175). As to the other two times he was stopped, the\n97 97\nOSHP has no record of this, though the OSHP consistently keeps such records. Meanwhile, traffic records do\nindicate that non-OSHP agencies had made inquiries of Valdez's immigration status, suggesting that Valdez was\nconfusing the actions of municipal and other local law enforcement agents with agents of the OSHP. (Hrg. at\n245-250; Doc. 31 at 13). Thus, I determined that the evidence was too uncertain to grant Valdez standing. (Id.).\nNo new evidence has been developed since 1997, to my knowledge, that would cause me to rethink my position.\n[8] On June 15, 1998, the OSHP filed a motion for summary judgment, requesting that the § 1983 claims against\nit be dismissed. Plaintiffs did not oppose this motion. (Doc. 89 at 2).\n[9] Specifically, plaintiffs allege that Kenneth Marshall acted as the Superintendent of the OSHP during a time\nwhen Policy 9-902.08 was being enforced. Policy 9-902.08 provided guidelines for \"handling suspected illegal\naliens.\" (See Plaintiffs' Ex. 1). According to plaintiffs, Policy 9-902.08 spurred the stepped-up enforcement of\nfederal immigration laws in Ohio. Colonel Davies also was a Superintendent while Policy 9-902.08 was in effect. \nPlaintiffs allege that Lt. Healy was one of the architects of the OSHP's immigration enforcement policies, and that\nhe approved of officers inquiring into a motorists' immigration status. Lt. Healy organized the single training\nsession on immigration for members of the TDIT unit, during which he taught officers how to identify forged green\ncards; Lt. Healy admitted, however, that he himself had no idea how to recognize an illegal immigrant. Plaintiffs\nfurther allege that Lt. Healy was informed that Aguilar and Esparza had had their green cards taken from them,\nyet defended Trooper Kiefer's actions and refused to address Aguilar's and Esparza's complaints.\nPlaintiffs allege that Sgt. Elling was a supervisor in the TDIT unit, and that he helped determine the OSHP's\nimmigration policies. Plaintiffs also allege that Sgt. Elling, after being told of the incident involving Aguilar and\nEsparza, did nothing to prevent officers from confiscating and destroying green cards in the future.\nFinally, plaintiffs allege that Lt. Elder headed a post of the Ohio Turnpike between Exits 3 and 3A south of Toledo,\nOhio, where he assisted in the enforcement of federal immigration laws.\n[10] If the jury imposes supervisory liability, no defendant would be protected by qualified immunity for the same\nreasons that deprive Trooper Kiefer of his claim of qualified immunity.\n[11] Further, 28 C.F.R. § 42.104(b), promulgated under Title VI, provides that a federally funded program or\nactivity cannot provide any \"disposition ... to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner\"\n\nbased on that individual's race, color or national original. \"Disposition\" is defined as any \"treatment, handling,\ndecision, sentencing, confinement, or other prescription of conduct.\" Id. at § 42.102(j). Clearly, the process of\nquestioning motorists about their immigration status constitutes a \"disposition\" within the meaning of Title VI.\n[12] As already discussed, plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case of unequal protection against the OSHP,\nwhich has gone unrebutted. (See Section II, supra., at 16-22).\n[13] Because Title VI claims only can be brought against entities, not individuals, plaintiffs' Title VI claims shall be\ndismissed as to all individual defendants (i.e., defendants Marshall, Davies, Healy, Elling, Elders, Kiefer, Blue,\nAmbrose, Baranowski, Courtney, Laubacher, Piatarek, Pape, Stevens, Unger, and Williams).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

This is a civil rights class action in three Counts.  The suit challenges the practice \nof the Ohio State Highway Patrol of making automobile stops, detentions and searches, \nwith or without lawful grounds to stop, detain and search, based on race and/or national \norigin. \n2.  Count I is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \net seg.  for violations of the First and the Fourth Amendments to the United  States \nConstitution  and  the  Due  Process  and  Equal  Protection  Clauses  of the  Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  In Count I, plaintiffs seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief and money damages for themselves and for the plaintiff class. \n3.  Count II is brought pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C. \nm \n§ 2000d m~., as amended, and 28 CFR § 32.101  ~., the administrative regulations \nof the United States Department of Justice effectuating Title VI.  In this Count, plaintiffs \nseek declaratory and injunctive relief and money damages for themselves and for the \nplaintiff class. \n4.  In Count III, plaintiffs invoke the supplemental jurisdiction of this Court pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1376, and raise claims under state constitutional and common law.  In \nCount III, plaintiffs seek money damages for themselves and for the plaintiff class. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  The jurisdiction of the Court in Counts I and II is founded on 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343 (a) (3) & (4) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1.  Jurisdiction in Count III is based on this \nCourt's supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \n2 \n\n6.  Venue is proper in this Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (b) (2), because \ndefendant the Ohio State Highway Patrol maintains an office, and defendant Marshall \nresides, in this district. \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) is a Union of migrant and \nseasonal farm workers.  It is  based  in Toledo,  Ohio,  and  has approximately 15,000 \nmembers nationwide.  During the harvest season, FLOC has approximately eight thousand \nmembers traveling and residing in Ohio.  These members are predominately Hispanic, and \nvirtually all of them will drive in Ohio or travel in vehicles driven on Ohio's highways by \nHispanic drivers.  FLOC's members are currently traveling through or residing in Ohio, and \nwill return year after year.  In addition, many of FLOC's members work and reside in \nMichigan, and travel from Florida and other points South through Ohio en route to their \nemployment.  FLOC conducts much of its business on the highways of Ohio, and its \norganizers have been victims of defendants' actions.  Plaintiffs Fernando Cuevas Sr. and \nFernando Cuevas Jr. are members of, as well as employees of, FLOC.  Plaintiffs Eusebio \nand Guadalupe Ariola and Merced Valdez and several other plaintiffs are members of \nFLOC. \n8.  Plaintiffs Jose Aguilar and  Irma  Esparza  are  lawfully admitted  permanent \nresident  aliens  in  the  United  States.  Mr.  Aguilar  and  Ms.  Esparza  are  Hispanic. \nDefendants seized the lawfully issued alien registration receipt cards of Mr. Aguilar and Ms. \nEsparza during a traffic stop.  Mr. Aguilar and Ms. Esparza travel in and through Ohio \nfreq uently. \n3 \n\n9.  Plaintiff Merced Valdez is a resident of Ohio. He is Hispanic, and is a United \nStates citizen.  He is a member of FLOC. \n10.  Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas Sr. is Hispanic, and is a United States citizen.  Each \nyear, he resides part of the year in Ohio and part of the year in Florida.  He is the First Vice \nPresident of FLOC. \n11.  Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas Jr. is Hispanic, and is a United States citizen.  Each \nyear, he resides part of the year in Ohio and part of the year in Florida.  He is a field \norganizer for FLOC. \n12.  Plaintiff Alicia Quintero was recently employed with Migrant Head Start in Ohio. \nShe is Hispanic, and a citizen of the United States.  She resides in Ohio and travels \nfrequently to Texas. \n13.  Plaintiff Francisco Quintero is Hispanic, and a citizen of the United States.  He \nresides in Ohio, and travels frequently to Texas. \n14.  Plaintiffs Guadalupe and Eusebio Ariola are farm workers who spend part of \neach year in Ohio.  They plan to return to Ohio each year in the future.  They are both \nHispanic citizens or lawfully admitted aliens. \n15.  Plaintiff Melissa Lopez is a citizen of the United States.  She is Hispanic, and \nresides part of each year in Ohio.  She plans to return to Ohio each year in the future. \n16.  Plaintiff Margarita Olivares is a migrant farm worker from Florida.  He is a \nlawfully admitted permanent resident alien of the United States.  He plans to return to Ohio \nin the future to work and reside.  He is Hispanic. \n4 \n\n17.  Defendant Ohio State Highway Patrol (\"Highway Patrol\" or \"O.H.P.\") is a state \nlaw-enforcement agency.  Pursuant to O.R.C. § 5503.01 et §eg., the O.H.P. is empowered \nto enforce the laws of the State of Ohio.  The O.H.P. is a recipient of federal funds.  The \nO.H.P. is a defendant in Count II only, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7. \n18.  Defendant Superintendent Kenneth Marshall (\"MarshalllJ) is the Superintendent \n-.-'~~ .... ,......  . ._ .... \nof the O.H.P. during some of the relevant time periods.  Defendant Marshall is sued in his \nindividual capacity for money damages and in his official capacity for injunctive relief. \nDefendant Marshall is authorized to make policy for the defendant O.H.P. \n19.  Defendant Colonel Warren Davies (\"Davies\") was the Superintendent of the \nO.H.P. during most of the relevant time periods.  Defendant Davies is sued in his individual \ncapacity for money damages.  Defendant Davies was authorized to make policy for the \ndefendant O.H.P. \n20.  Defendant Staff Lieutenant William D. Healy is the statewide coordinator of the \n,--....... ~-...... ,. ..... \"~\" •.•.•.•.•- ......... .-.. ........... -................................................................. -: .. . \nTraffic and Drug Interdiction Team (\"TOIT\"), a program of the O.H.P. that focuses on stops \nand searches of drivers and vehicles on the streets and highways of the Northwest part of \nOhio.  He has served in that capacity since the TOIT's inception.  When he learned of \ndefendants' practices relating to the immigration questioning and seizure of immigration \ndocuments of plaintiffs Aguilar, Esparza and other Hispanics, he defended the practice and \nrefused to take action to curtail the practice.  He is sued for damages in his individual \ncapacity as well as for injunctive relief in his official capacity.  He is authorized to make \npolicy for the defendant O.H.P. as it relates to the TOIT. \n5 \n\n21.  Defendant Bruce Elling is a Sergeant with the Ohio State Highway Patrol and \na quadrant supervisor of the TDIT.  He is authorized to make policy for those defendants \ninvolved in the TDIT.  When he learned that defendant Kiefer and his partners had seized \nthe permanent resident alien cards of plaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza, and that defendant \nKiefer's sergeant had told Kiefer that it was not good to confiscate immigration documents, \nElling  refused  to take  any action  to  curtail the  practice,  even  after he  learned that \ndefendant Kiefer and his partners planned to defy the sergeant and continue to confiscate \nHispanic' immigration documents.  He is sued in his individual capacity for money damages \nand in his official capacity for purposes of injunctive relief. \n22.  Defendant Berry Elders is the head of the Swanton Highway Patrol Post located \nalong the Ohio Turnpike between Exits 3 and 3A south of Toledo.  He is sued in his \nindividual capacity for money damages and in his official capacity as Post Commander for \npurposes of injunctive relief. \n23.  Defendants Kevin Kiefer, Rebecca Ambrose, Steven R. Blue, John Baranowski, \n~'~\"''''''''''''':';''''''''''''-''''''''':''~''-: ..•. ''\",\"\". .. ,. .... ,. ....; . \nBrian Courtney, DeaQ ... ~~.~~.~9.Der, Paul ~i.~t~rek, Paul P~pe, Bob St~vens, RichardqQ.g~r \n....•.•............•............... --.......... -...•.•...•;  •.•••.•..•.•: ...........  \". ...... .\",.. ....... ' ............................; ......  . .. '...................  \"....  .'\" . \nand C~~r~.~§ Y'fi.II.!~ms, a.k.a Tracy McCray are troopers of the Ohio State Highway Patrol. \nDefendant Kiefer testified  in  deposition that most of these troopers  had  questioned \nmotorists as to their immigration status, sometimes handling and confiscating immigration \ncards.  Plaintiffs also sue other, unknown officers of the Highway Patrol who effectuated \nthe stops, detentions and searches of the named plaintiffs, as well as unknown officers of \nthe Highway Patrol who have effectuated the stops, detentions and searches of other class \nmembers.  All such officers are sued in their individual capacities only. \n6 \n\n24.  At all times pertinent hereto, all defendants were acting under color of state law \nand their conduct constituted state action. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n25.  Plaintiffs bring this Complaint as a class action under Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiffs seek to represent, pursuant to Rules 23 (b) (2) and 23 \n(b) (3), a class of all persons traveling on the streets and highways of Ohio, who, because \nof their national origin and/or race, in the past have been, or in the future will be, stopped, \ndetained,  searched,  with  or without  legally sufficient cause  and  justification,  and/or \nharassed, including the following two subclasses: \nA.  All Hispanic motorists who have been questioned by defendants as to their \nimmigration status, or who have had their immigration documents questioned and/or seized \nby defendants; and \nB.  A\" Hispanic passengers who have been questioned by defendants as to their \nimmigration status, or who have had their immigration documents questioned or seized by \ndefendants. \n26.  All of the prerequisites to a class action as stated in Rule 23 (a) are satisfied by \nthe class and sub-classes. \na.  Numerous individuals have been stopped, detained and also often searched \nby defendants pursuant to defendants' unlawful practices, and numerous \nindividuals will be in the future.  Defendants have admitted that they have \nquestioned hundreds of motorists and passengers as to their immigration \nstatus and documentation, and defendants have admitted that they have \n7 \n\nexamined  hundreds  of  immigration  documents,  and  have  seized \napproximately 100 immigration documents.  Therefore, the class and sub \nclasses are so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nb.  There are questions of law and fact common to the plaintiff class.  The \ncommon questions include whether the defendants' practices described \nbelow of stopping, detaining and also often searching persons on the basis \nof national origin and/or race with or without legally sufficient cause and \njustification unconstitutionally burdens the First, Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendment rights of those so stopped, detained and searched, \ntheir constitutional right to freedom of movement, and the corresponding \nstate constitutional guarantees, and whether these practices of defendants \nviolate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nc.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class and \nsub-classes: the named plaintiffs were stopped, detained and also searched \npursuant to the practices challenged here, as were members of the class and \nsub-classes. \nd.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nclass: they have no interests antagonistic to the class; they seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief and money damages on behalf of the entire class and \nsuch relief will benefit all members of the class; and they are represented by \ncounsel who are competent and experienced in civil rights and class action \nlitigation. \n8 \n\n27.  The class satisfies Rule 23 (b) (2) because the defendants have engaged in a \ncourse  of conduct common to  all  members of the class  and  sub-classes,  and final \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief in favor of the plaintiff class is therefore appropriate.  In \naddition, the class satisfies Rule 23 (b) (3) because the questions of law and fact common \nto members of the class predominate over any questions affecting individual members and \na class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication \nof the controversy. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nDefendants' First Unlawful Practice \n28.  It is the practice of the Highway Patrol and its officers to stop, detain and also \noften search individuals traveling on streets and highways in Ohio because of the travelers' \nrace and/or national origin, with or without legally sufficient cause and justification (\"the first \npractice\").  Once defendants make the stops, they treat the motorists and passengers \ndifferently based on race and/or national origin.  Each of the named plaintiffs have been \nvictims of the first practice. \n29.  The first practice is widespread and systemic.  For example, during the three \nmonth period from December 1,  1996 through February 28,  1997, 25% of the traffic \ncitations issued by defendant Kiefer were issued to Hispanics.  In addition, during the same \ntime period, defendant Kiefer detained nearly 20 other Hispanics for long periods of times, \nwithout issuing any traffic citation.  However, according to the 1990 United States Census, \nthe upper mid-west (Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin) is only 3% Hispanic. \nRecently Judge Skow of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, wrote about the traffic \nI \n9 \n\nstop of two Hispanics by the TOIT: \"In sum then, one is left to wonder if this car-outwardly \nunremarkable and with  no suspicious behavior-was targeted.a.by means of a  profile. \nTrooper Kiefer insists not, but Trooper Kiefer's credibility is suspect.\"  On the other side of \nOhio, Judge Cross of the Medina County Court of Common Pleas, wrote of another stop \nof Hispanic motorists by the TDIT: \"Until the police can provide this Court with more reason \nto delay motorists and conduct searches than the national origin of the persons detained, \nthis Court will suppress evidence gained from such searches.\"  In yet another repudiation \nof the tactics of the TOfT, Judge Gretick of the Williams County Court of Common Pleas \nwrote about another stop of aliens by the TOfT: \"The troopers denied using any 'profile' in \ndeciding which cars to stop .... Finding none other than that the vehicle and its occupants \nmet some impermissible profile, the Court finds the stop to be constitutionally deficient.\" \nDefendants' Second Unlawful Practice \n30.  At times, when defendants engage in the first practice, they also question some \nor all of the occupants of vehicles as to their immigration status, including demands to see \nimmigration documents (\"the second practice\").  This is a routine practice.  Defendants \nhave admitted identifying large numbers of \"illegal\" aliens during \"routine traffic stops\", and \nadmit detaining  several  hundred  Hispanics for investigation  by the  Immigration and \nNaturalization Service Border Patrol in Michigan. \nDefendants' Third Unlawful Practice \n31. At times, when defendants engage in the first and second practices, defendants \nconfiscate crass members' immigration documents, including lawfully issued certificates of \nalien registration or alien registration receipt cards (\"the third practice\").  Defendants keep \n10 \n\nthese lawfully issued certificates of alien registration or alien registration receipt cards for \nlong  periods  of time.  Defendants'  third  practice  subjects  aliens  to  federal  criminal \nprosecution for failure to possess their lawfully issued certificates of alien registration or \nalien registration receipt cards.  In addition, defendants are committing a federal criminal \nact by ca using these persons to be without their lawfully issued certificates of alien \nregistration or alien registration receipt cards. \n32.  Defendant Trooper Kevin Kiefer told several witnesses that an individual named \nCoutcher, who is a federal law-enforcement agent with the Immigration and Naturalization \nService Border Patrol Office in Trenton, Michigan, has traveled around the State of Ohio \ntraining O.H.P. troopers to confiscate aliens' immigration documents, and bring them to \nCoutcher, who checks the documents through a computer system.  Kiefer said that it is his \npractice to collect immigration documents from alien travelers from Saturday through \nThursday, and deliver the confiscated documents on Fridays to agent Coutcher.  Kiefer \ntestified under oath that he has witnessed many other troopers, both in and out of the \nTDIT, examine and confiscate permanent resident alien cards from Hispanic motorists and \npassengers during \"routine traffic stops.\" \n33.  Defendants' practices as described above are widespread.  Individuals are \nstopped, detained and also often searched pursuant to the three practices in all areas of \nthe State of Ohio on a persistent, recurrent basis. \n11 \n\nThe Stop, Detention and Search of Plaintiffs Jose Aguilar and Irma Esparza, and the \nSeizure of Their Lawfully Issued Permanent Resident Alien Cards \n34.  Plaintiffs Jose Aguilar and  Irma Esparza are lawfully admitted Permanent \nResident Aliens who reside in Chicago, Illinois.  They have many friends and relatives in \nthe Toledo, Ohio area, and travel frequently between Chicago and Toledo. \n35.  On March 26,1995, at approximately 2:00 P.M., plaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza \nwere traveling eastbound on Interstates 80-90 (\"Toll Road\") near the Airport Highway (Ohio \n2) Exit.  Mr. Aguilar was driving.  Defendant Officer Kiefer was driving behind plaintiffs and \nactivated the flashing lights on his patrol car, thereby signaling to Mr. Aguilar to pull over. \nMr. Aguilar pulled over to the shoulder and Kiefer pulled his patrol car over behind the \nvehicle driven by Mr. Aguilar. \n36.  Officer Kiefer approached the vehicle driven by Mr. Aguilar and asked for Mr. \nAguilar's driver's license and  immigration documents.  Mr. Aguilar handed Kiefer his \ndriver'S license and alien registration receipt card.  Officer Kiefer went back to his patrol car \nwith Mr. Aguilar's documents.  Officer Kiefer gave Mr. Aguilar a warning ticket for having \na broken headlight. \n37.  Highway Patrol troopers took possession of the immigration documents of Mr. \nAguilar and  Ms.  Esparza.  Ms.  Esparza and  Mr.  Aguilar were told their immigration \ndocuments would be sent by defendants to another location for investigation of their \nauthenticity. \n38.  Mr. Aguilar and Ms. Esparza were detained at the roadside for approximately \ntwenty (20) minutes while the officers searched their vehicle and possessions.  The Ohio \n12 \n\nHighway Patrol officers also used a dog to sniff around the plaintiffs' vehicle, opened the \ninside door panel of the vehicle, searched the contents of the back seat and searched the \ncontents of a number of suitcases and other items in the locked trunk of the vehicle without \nthe permission of either Ms.  Esparza or Mr. Aguilar.  No guns, drugs, contraband or \nevidence of illegal activity was found. \n39.  In his Answer filed with this Court in Aguilar v.  Ohio State Highway Patrol, No. \n3:96CV7729 (N.D. Ohio) (Carr, J.), defendant Kiefer has confirmed the events described \nin paragraphs 35 to 38. \n40.  No defendant explained to Ms. Esparza or Mr. Aguilar why the cards were \nconfiscated, where the cards would be taken, who would view the cards, how to learn the \ncause of the seizure of the cards, how to seek return of the cards and how to chaUenge \ndefendants' taking of the cards. \n41.  At no time did Ms. Esparza or Mr. Aguilar consent to the search of their vehicle \nand possessions or the seizure of their immigration documents. \n42.  The vehicle of Ms.  Esparza and Mr. Aguilar was detained at the roadside \nwithout reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity and the length of their detention exceeded \na reasonable amount of time for an investigative stop even if such stop had been lawful. \nTheir vehicle and possessions were searched without probable cause. \n43.  The complained of conduct by Officer Kiefer and other unnamed officers of the \nOhio State Highway patrol was motivated by the raceland or national origin of Ms. Esparza \nand Mr. Aguilar. \n13 \n\n44.  The seizure of plaintiffs' immigration documents was pursuant to the third \npractice identified stated above. \n45.  In  deposition,  defendant  Healy  testified  that  in  the  last  18  months, \napproximately 300-400 aliens had been detained during routine traffic stops and held for \nthe Border Patrol.  Defendant Healy also testified that TDIT troopers had received a few \nhours of training on identifying immigration documents several years ago, but no training \nsince, and that field troopers had never received any training on any matters related to \nimmigration. \n46.  In deposition, defendant Kiefer testified that in the last two years,  he has \nquestioned over 300 aliens about their immigration status, and had examined 75-100 \npermanent resident alien cards,  keeping approximately 10 of them permanently.  He \ntestified that he called the Border Patrol to investigate virtually all of the aliens he had \nquestioned about immigration.  Kiefer could not identify the race or nationality of any non \nHispanics he had questioned about immigration. \nThe Stop, Detention and Search of Plaintiff Merced Valdez \n47.  Approximately six months ago, an unknown Highway Patrol officer who was \nbehind Plaintiff Merced Valdez's car turned on his flashing lights, signaling Mr. Merced \nValdez to pull over.  Mr Merced Valdez pulled the car over to the right shoulder. \n48.  The officer approached the car and asked for Mr. Merced Valdez's license. \nAfter Mr. Merced Valdez provided his license, the trooper demanded to see his immigration \npapers.  Mr.  Merced Valdez is a United States citizen and as a result possesses no \nimmigration papers. \n14 \n\n49.  When Mr. Merced Valdez questioned the trooper's request for immigration \npapers, the trooper gruffly ordered Mr. Valdez out of the car, and ordered him to raise his \nhands and face away from his car.  Upon information and belief, the trooper then searched \nMr. Valdez' car.  Mr. Valdez never consented in any way to the trooper's actions. \n50.  Eventually, the trooper instructed Mr. Merced Valdez that he was free to go. \nNo ticket or citation of any sort was issued. \nThe Stop. Detention and Search of Plaintiff Margarito Oliyares \n51.  Plaintiff Margarito Olivares is a migrant farm worker who resides in farm labor \ncamps in Ohio during part of the year.  During August, 1996, he was walking along a state \nroute near Fremont, Ohio, returning to his farm labor camp from a nearby grocery store. \nA Highway Patrol trooper stopped him, and demanded to search his grocery bag.  The \ntrooper also demanded to see his identification, and carefully examined Mr. Olivares' \nlawfully issued alien registration receipt card.  The trooper then ordered Mr. Olivares to \nreturn directly to his farm labor camp, without making any detours.  The trooper never \nexplained to Mr. Olivares why he was detained and searched. \nThe Stop. Detention and Search of Plaintiff Melissa Lopez \n52.  Plaintiff Melissa Lopez is a farm worker near Fremont Ohio.  In August, 1996, \nshe, her mother, and her daughter were driving en route to a migrant farm labor camp near \nFremont.  A Highway Patrol trooper drove out from a corn field and stopped Ms. Lopez \nnext to the farm labor camp.  The trooper asked Ms. Lopez several questions of a personal \nnature while peering into the interior of Ms. Lopez's car.  None of the Lopezes were given \nany ticket or citation of any sort.  Throughout the summer of 1996, members of the \n15 \n\nHighway Patrol have routinely parked next to this farm labor camp, and watched the camp \nand its occupants from their cars.  The camp is on an isolated back road in Sandusky \nCounty, with very little traffic. \nThe Stop. Detention and Search of Plaintiffs Guadalupe and Eusebio Ariola \n53.  Guadalupe and Eusebio Ariola are migrant farm workers who live part of the \nyear in Texas and part of the year in migrant farm labor housing near Fremont, Ohio.  In \nJune of 1996, Eusebio was driving the family in a van on the turnpike between Fremont \nand Toledo, Ohio.  It was approximately 2:30 in the afternoon.  They were stopped by two \ntroopers of the Highway Patrol.  Almost immediately a sport utility vehicle arrived with a \ndrug-sniffing dog.  The trooper asked the Ariolas to sign a consent to search form.  When \nthe Ariolas asked why the troopers wanted to search the van, the trooper said that \"it was \nprocedure.\"  Reasonably believing that they could not refuse, Eusebio signed.  The van \nwas thoroughly searched for an extended period of time.  After finding no contraband of \nany sort, the troopers searched Guadalupe Ariola's purse and wallet, looking through each \nof her cards.  The Ariolas were given no ticket or written citation of any sort. \nThe First Stop, Detention and Search of Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas, Jr. \n54.  Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas, Jr. is an organizer for the Farm Labor Organizing \nCommittee (FLOC).  He is a citizen of the United States.  During the summer in 1993, he \nwas driving on FLOC business.  He was pulled over on Interstate 280 by five Highway \nPatrol officers.  One of the officers demanded to see his license and vehicle registration. \nMr. Cuevas, Jr. was told that he was being held \"on suspicion.  The officers demanded to \ntJ \n16 \n\nsearch Mr. Cuevas' pick-up truck.  Reasonably believing that he was not allowed to refuse, \nMr. Cuevas permitted his vehicle to be searched. \n55.  Highway  Patrol  officers  detained  Plaintiff  Fernando  Cuevas,  Jr.  for \napproximately two and one-half hours, while the officers searched his truck.  Absolutely no \ncontraband was found.  Mr. Cuevas was released and was given no warning ticket nor \ncitation of any type.  He missed his Union farm labor camp meeting. \nThe Second Stop. Detention and Search of Plaintiff Fernandez Cuevas, Jr. \n56.  Later during the summer of 1993 while again conducting FLOC business, Mr. \nCuevas Jr. was driving on State Route 20 just outside of Woodville, Ohio.  A Highway \nPatrol officer ordered him to pull over.  The officer demanded that he turn over his license \nand registration.  The officer repeatedly questioned Mr. Cuevas concerning use of funds \nfrom an Ohio bank to purchase a truck registered in Florida.  After approximately one-half \nhour, Mr. Cuevas was released.  He was not issued a warning ticket or citation of any sort. \nThe Third Stop. Detention and Search of Plaintiff Fernandez Cuevas, Jr. \n57.  During September, 1995, Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas, Jr. was driving on the Ohio \nTurnpike just west of the Toledo Airport.  It was approximately noon, and he was driving \na car registered to the Farm Labor Research Project (FLRP).  He was accompanied by his \nfather, Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas, Sr., who is the first vice-president of FLOC.  They were \ndriving from one Union camp meeting to another. \n58.  Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas, Jr. had the cruise control set at the speed limit. \nThey passed a Highway Patrol trooper parked at the side of the turnpike.  The trooper \nbegan to follow them.  Approximately two miles ahead, they saw three more Highway \n17 \n\nPatrol cruisers parked on the side of the turnpike.  One of those troopers signaled the \nCuevas' to stop, which they did. \n59.  Once stopped, both of the Cuevas' were ordered to produce their drivers' \nlicenses and car registration.  After each complied, each was separately questioned at \nlength by the troopers about who they were visiting, what they were doing, who they had \ntalked with, and what their plans were.  All four of the O.H.P. cruisers stayed at the scene. \nIn the course of questioning, one of the troopers learned that the car was registered to \nFLRP.  Eventually, the Cuevases were released.  The Highway Patrol officers did not issue \na ticket, warning or citation of any sort. \nThe First Stop, Detention and Search of Plaintiffs Francisco and Alicia Quintero \n60.  In 1991, Plaintiffs Francisco and Alicia Quintero and their four children were \ndriving on the Ohio Turnpike west of Toledo en route to visit their seriously ill mother in \nTexas, when they were detained by three O.H.P. cruisers and one undercover car carrying \na drug sniffing dog.  The Quintero's car and possessions were searched for over one hour. \nNo contraband was found.  They were not given a ticket or citation of any sort. \nThe Second Stop. Detention and Search of Francisco and Alicia Quintero \n61.  On or about March, 1996, Plaintiffs Francisco and Alicia Quintero were driving \nin Northwestern Ohio when they were stopped by an unmarked O.H.P. car.  Francisco and \ntheir four children were ordered out of the car, and their car and the families' possessions \nwere searched for approximately forty minutes.  They were not asked to produce their \ndrivers' licenses, registration or any form of identification.  They were issued no warning, \nticket nor citation of any sort. \n18 \n\nOther Instances of Defendants' Unlawful Practices \n62.  Both prior and subsequent to the named plaintiffs being stopped, detained and \nsearched by Highway Patrol troopers based on national origin and/or race with or without \nlegally sufficient cause and justification, numerous other Hispanics and persons of color \nhave been subjected to defendants' persistently applied practices, in many instances, \nmultiple times.  Among these applications of defendants' practices are the following: \nThe Stop of Cynthia Ruiz \n63.  Cynthia Ruiz resides in Texas and is employed as a county prosecutor.  She \nis Hispanic.  During the summer of 1994, while she was employed as a summer law clerk \nfor Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, Inc. (ABLE), in Fremont, Ohio, she was stopped \non the Ohio Turnpike by a Highway Patrol trooper.  He asked her several personal \nquestions, and then said that the car smelled like marijuana and asked her if she had been \nsmoking marijuana that morning.  She had not.  The trooper then asked to search her car. \nShe refused.  The trooper continued to attempt to intimidate her.  She finally demanded \nto be ticketed or released.  The trooper finally released her.  She was issued no warning, \nticket or citation of any sort. \nThe Stop. Detention and Search of Ruben Valdez \n64.  Ruben Valdez is a resident of Ohio.  He is Hispanic, and is a United States \ncitizen.  While driving home in Defiance, Ohio in 1996, Ruben Valdez was detained at gun \npoint by several police officers.  An unknown Highway Patrol trooper was present during \nthe stop and search of Ruben Valdez's car.  At no time did Mr. Ruben Valdez consent to \nthe stop, detention or search of the car.  No drugs, guns, contraband or evidence of illegal \n19 \n\nactivity was found.  Mr. Ruben Valdez was not given a ticket, warning or citation of any \nsort, \nGeneral Allegations Concerning Defendants' Conduct \n65.  Each Plaintiff's auto was stopped without reasonable suspicion of unlawful \nactivity,  No plaintiff was engaged in any illegal activity.  Each plaintiff was detained at the \nroadside without reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity and the length of each plaintiffs \ndetention exceeded a reasonable amount of time for an investigative stop, even if such \nstop had been lawful.  Each plaintiffs car and possessions were searched without probable \ncause. \n66.  The complained of conduct by each defendant was motivated by plaintiffs' \nnational origin and/or race. \n67.  The stop, detention and search of plaintiffs was pursuant to the three practices \nstated above. \n68.  Defendants  Davies,  Elling,  and  Elders  either  authorized  or  knowingly \nacquiesced in the unconstitutional actions of their subordinates, and they were deliberately \nindifferent to constitutional violations likely to result from serious deficiencies in the training \nprogram of Highway Patrol officers concerning stopping of vehicles on a prohibited basis. \n69.  Each  defendant  and  the  other  unknown  officers  acted  knowingly  and \nintentionally.  Moreover, their actions were taken with recklessness or callous disregard for \nplaintiffs' rights. \n70.  The actions of defendants in unlawfully stopping and detaining plaintiffs and \nsearching their cars,  persons and possessions have had a disproportionate effect on \n20 \n\nHispanics and other persons of color have penalized plaintiffs for the exercise of their \nconstitutional right to freedom of movement in the State of Ohio and  have hindered \nplaintiffs' exercise of that right. \nInjury To Plaintiffs \n71.  As a direct and proximate result of defendants' conduct as stated herein, \nplaintiffs and the class they seek to represent have suffered humiliation, embarrassment, \nmental fright and emotional distress.  In addition, defendants' conduct has hindered \nplaintiffs and the class they seek to represent in freely traveling the streets and highways \nin the State of Ohio.  Defendants' actions have had a discriminatory impact against \nplaintiffs and class members. \nNecessity for Injunctive Relief \n72.  Each plaintiff presently either resides in Ohio or has family, friends or business \ninterests in Ohio and thus expects to travel Ohio's highways in the future.  They wish to be \nfree to travel to and in Ohio and on highways in Ohio without being stopped, detained and \nsearched pursuant to the defendants' unlawful practices.  Plaintiff FLOC is hindered in its \nmission and in its operation by defendants' actions. \n73.  Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent are threatened with substantial, \nimmediate and irreparable injury at the hands of the defendants.  Defendants began their \npractices of stopping, detaining and also often searching Hispanic persons traveling on \nhighways in Ohio based on national origin and/or race  before the incidents involving the \nnamed plaintiffs, and defendants continue to engage in the practices against the numerous \nmembers of the class.  Individual Highway Patrol troopers are authorized by the Highway \n21 \n\n~: \nPatrol  to engage in  the conduct to which  the  named  plaintiffs  and  numerous other \nHispanics and persons of color have been subjected.  Plaintiffs will also continue in the \nfuture to suffer the ongoing effects of defendants' past applications of the practice to them. \n74.  Unless  restrained  by  this  Court,  defendants will  continue  their  unlawful \npractices.  Pursuant to these practices, plaintiffs are likely in the future to be stopped, \ndetained and searched by defendants based on national origin and/or race with or without \nlegally sufficient cause and justification.  Plaintiffs continue to, and will in the future, travel \non streets and highways in Ohio patrolled by the Highway Patrol.  Plaintiffs will continue \nto be unable, even by fully conforming their conduct to all legal requirements, to avoid \nbeing stopped, detained and also often searched by defendants pursuant to defendants' \nunlawful practices. \n75.  Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable injury and, in the absence of injunctive relief, \nwill continue to suffer irreparable injury.  They have no adequate remedy at law. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n(Interference with Freedom of Association) \n76.  Defendants' actions in maintaining the practices and in stopping plaintiffs' \nautomobiles and detaining plaintiffs pursuant to these practices have deprived plaintiffs \nand the class they seek to represent of their right to freedom of association as guaranteed \nby the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n22 \n\nx' \n(Unlawful Detention) \n77.  Defendants' actions in maintaining the practices and in stopping plaintiffs' \nautomobiles and detaining plaintiffs pursuant to the practices have deprived plaintiffs and \nthe class they seek to represent of their right to be free from unreasonable seizures as \nguaranteed by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n(Unlawful Search) \n78.  Defendants' actions in maintaining the practices and in searching plaintiffs, their \nvehicles and their possessions pursuant to the practices have deprived plaintiffs and the \nclass they seek to represent of their right to be free from unreasonable searches as \nguaranteed by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n(Denial of Equal Protection) \n79.  The defendants' actions in maintaining the practices and in stopping, detaining \nand searching plaintiffs, their vehicles and their possessions pursuant to the practices have \nbeen motivated by discriminatory animus and constitute denial of equal protection of the \nlaws  based  on  plaintiffs'  national  origin  and/or  race  in  violation  of the  Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \n(Violation of Right to Travel) \n80.  The defendants' actions in maintaining the practices and in stopping, detaining \nand searching plaintiffs, their vehicles and their possessions pursuant to the practices have \nunreasonably burdened the fundamental right to travel guaranteed to plaintiffs and the \nclass they seek to represent by Article IV, Section II of the United States Constitution. \n23 \n\n(Violation of Right to Freedom of Movement) \n81.  The defendants' actions in maintaining the practices and in stopping, detaining \nand searching plaintiffs, their vehicles and their possessions pursuant to the practices have \nunreasonably burdened the fundamental right to freedom of movement guaranteed to \nplaintiffs and the class they seek to represent by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \nCOUNT II \n(Violations of Federal Civil Rights Act and Regulations) \n82.  The Ohio State Highway Patrol maintains or constitutes a program or activity \nthat receives federal financial assistance from the United States Department of Justice. \nThus, it is subject to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 2000d m~. and 28 CFR § 42.101 \nm~. Plaintiffs are intended beneficiaries of such program or activity. \n83.  The selection of persons to be stopped, detained and searched on the basis \nof race and/or national origin, with  or without legally sufficient cause  or justification \nconstitutes intentional discrimination and has a discriminatory effect and a disproportionate \nimpact on Hispanics and other persons of color. \n84.  The violation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000d and 28 CFR § 42.101 et seq. as alleged \nabove,  has  caused,  and  will  cause  unless  the  practice  is  enjoined  by  this  Court, \ntremendous harm and public humiliation to Hispanics and other individuals of color who are \nstopped, detained or searched pursuant to the above practices. \n85.  The defendants' actions in maintaining the practices and in stopping, detaining \nand searching plaintiffs pursuant to the practices have been motivated by discriminatory \n24 \n\nanimus, have a discriminatory effect, have a disproportionate impact on Hispanics and \nother persons of color and constitute a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d .m~. and its implementing regulations at 28 CFR § 42.101 .m~. \nCOUNT III \n(Supplemental State Claims) \n86.  All defendants in this Count are sued in their individual capacities only. \n87.  Defendants have acted recklessly, oppressively and willfully, with a design to \noppress and injure plaintiffs. \n(State Constitution - Unlawful Seizure) \n88.  The actions of defendants in maintaining the practices and in stopping and \ndetaining plaintiffs pursuant to the practices have denied plaintiffs and the class they seek \nto represent their right to be free from unreasonable seizures in violation of Art. I, Sec. 14 \nof the Ohio Constitution. \n(State Constitution - Unlawful Search) \n89.  The  actions of defendants  in  maintaining  the  practices  and  in  stopping, \ndetaining and also often searching plaintiffs, their vehicles and their possessions pursuant \nto the practices have been motivated by discriminatory animus and constitute denial of \nequal protection of the laws based on plaintiffs' national origin or race in violation of the \nOhio Constitution. \n25 \n\n(State law -False Arrest) \n90.  When defendants arrest and detain plaintiffs without probable cause and \nwithout authorization pursuant to federal or Ohio law, they have falsely arrested plaintiffs \nand similarly situated class members. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs request: \nA. A declaratory judgment that defendants' practices of stopping, detaining and also \noften  searching  persons, their vehicles and  their possessions with  or without legally \nsufficient cause or justification on the basis of national origin and/or race violates the rights \nof plaintiff class members, guaranteed by the First Amendment, to freedom of association; \nB. A declaratory judgment that defendants' practices of stopping, detaining and also \noften  searching  persons, their vehicles and their possessions with  or without legally \nsufficient cause or justification on the basis of national origin and/or race violates the rights \nof plaintiff class  members,  guaranteed  by the  Fourth  Amendment,  to  be  free from \nunreasonable searches and seizures; \nC.  A declaratory judgment that defendants' practices of stopping, detaining and \nalso often searching persons, their vehicles and their possessions with or without legally \nsufficient cause or justification on the basis of national origin and/or race violates plaintiff \nclass members' right to Equal Protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment; \nD.  A declaratory judgment that defendants' practices of stopping, detaining and \nalso often searching persons, their vehicles and their possessions with or without legally \nsufficient cause or justification on the basis of national origin and/or race violates plaintiff \n26 \n\nclass members' constitutional right to freedom of movement as secured by the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; \nE. A decfaratory judgment that defendants' practices of stopping, detaining and also \noften searching persons, their vehicles and their possessions with or without legally \nsufficient cause or justification on the basis of national origin and/or race violates plaintiff \nclass members' constitutional right to freedom of travel as secured by Article IV, Section \nII of the United States Constitution; \nF. A decfaratory judgment that defendants' practices of stopping, detaining and also \noften searching persons on the basis of national origin and/or race, with or without legally \nsufficient cause or justification, violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d and its implementing regulations at Title VI, 28 CFR § 42.101 et~.; \nG.  A preliminary, and then a permanent injunction barring all defendants and their \nofficers, agents, servants, employees and attorneys and those persons in active concert \nor participation with them from stopping or detaining individuals or searching them, their \npossessions or their automobiles on the basis of race and/or national origin, with or without \nlegally sufficient cause or justification; \nH.

      "text": "., \n:.  \nr••,••.J c.> ~ '~~.. \",L  ... ~ \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \nWESTERN DIVISION \nFarm Labor Organizing Committee, et al.,  Case No.3 :96CV7580 \nPlaintiffs, \nv.  Order \nThe Ohio State Highway Patrol, et al., \nDefendants. \nThis is a civil rights case in which plaintiffs seek preliminary relief from allegedly unlawful \nand  unconstitutional practices by defendants. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331. Pending is plaintiffs' renewed motion for a preliminary injunction. (Doc. 37). Defendants \nfiled a memorandum in opposition (Doc. 47), and plaintiffs filed a reply.  (Doc.  49).  For the \nfollowing reasons, plaintiffs' motion shall be granted in part and denied in part. \nBackground \nPlaintiffs are Hispanic migrant workers who claim that the Ohio State Highway Patrol \n(OSHP) has violated their constitutional rights by stopping, searching, and detaining them on the \nbasis of race or national origin, interrogating them about their immigration status, and confiscating \nimmigration documents without either justification or providing substitute documents. Plaintiffs seek \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n2 \na preliminary injunction ordering the OSHP to stop these practices. Plaintiffs' earlier motion for a \npreliminary injunction was denied without prejudice on June 24,1997, because none of the named \nplaintiffs had ever been stopped, and therefore no named plaintiff had standing. (Doc. 31). An \namended complaint was filed adding plaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza, who have been stopped by the \nOSHP and questioned about their immigration status and had their immigration documents seized. \n(Doc. 44). \nA. Standing \nThe first step in the preliminary injunction analysis is standing. To establish standing the \nplaintiffs must show: 1) injury in fact; 2) traceability; and 3) redressibility. Kardules v. City of \nColumbus, 95 F.3d 1335, 1346 (6th Cir. 1996). \nThe injury in fact prong requires that the plaintiff has suffered a concrete or particularized \ninjury that is actual or imminent. Id. Plaintiffs are aliens. As such, they  possess alien registration \nreceipt cards, also known as \"green cards.  All aliens over the age of eighteen must at all times have \ntI \npossession of their green cards. 8 U.S.C. §1304(e). An alien failing to possess his or her green card \nfaces a fine of not more than $100 or imprisonment not to exceed thirty days, or both. Id. \nPlaintiffs allege unjustified seizure and retention of green cards by OSHP troopers. If this \nallegation is proven, defendants have exposed plaintiffs to criminal penalties including possible \nimprisonment. Thus, if plaintiffs prove an unjustified seizure and retention of green cards, they have \nshown a concrete particularized injury. 1 \nIThe parties did not addressed the question of whether return to plaintiffs of their green cards \nhas mooted their demand for preliminary injunctive relief. There are two reasons this action is not \nmooted by the return of green cards. First, plaintiffs are a class whose claims are not dismissed as \nmoot due to the resolution of the class representative's claims. Sosna y. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393 (1975), \n(\"the issue sought to be litigated escapes full appellate review at the behest of any single challenger, \nA072A \n(Aev.8/82) \n\n3 \nThese actions are clearly traceable to the defendant, whose troopers are accused of stopping \nthe plaintiffs, questioning them about immigration status, and confiscating their immigration \ndocuments. If issued, an injunction against these practices will clearly redress plaintiffs' grievances. \nTherefore, plaintiffs meet the three requirements of standing and can proceed with their motion for \na preliminary injunction. \nB. Requirements For Injunctive Relief \nBefore issuing a preliminary injunction, a district court must consider: \n1) the likelihood that the party seeking the preliminary injunction will succeed on the \nmerits of the claim; 2) whether the party seeking the injunction will suffer irreparable \nharm without the injunction; 3) the probability that granting the injunction will cause \nsubstantial harm to others; and 4) whether the public interest is advanced by the \nissuance of the injunction. \nDayton Area Visually Impaired Persons v. Fisber, 70 F.3d 1474, 1480 (6th Cir.1995) {g!ing \nWashington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1099 (6th Cir. 1994)). Those four considerations are Itfactors to \nbe balanced, not prerequisites that must be met.\" In re DeLorean Motor Co., 755 F.2d 1223, 1229 \n(6th Cir.1985). Thus, \"[n]ot all of these factors fully need to be established for an injunction to be \nproper,\" and no single factor is to be \"given controlling weight.\" Michigan State AFL-CIO v. Miller, \n103 F.3d 1240,  1249 (6th Cir.  1977). Accord, Blue Cross &  Blue Shield Mutual of Ohio v. \ndoes not inexorably become moot by the intervening resolution of the controversy as to the named \nplaintiffs,\"). Second, even if this were an individual action it would not be mooted because this is \na situation that is capable of repetition but evasive of judicial review and redress. Where the facts \nthat are the basis of the litigation expire before judicial review, but are capable of repetition, there \nis a live controversy. Southern Pacific Terminal Co. y. Interstate Commerce COmmission, 219 U.S. \n498,515 (1911), Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 124-25 (1973). In United States y. New York Tel. Co., \n434 U.S. 159, 165 (1977), the Supreme Court found a live controversy where the judicial order that \nwas the basis for the suit had expired. Because such orders would always expire before judicial \nreview, and the challenged practice could be repeated, the controversy was not moot. Here, the \nOSHP could continue to seize green cards unlawfully, subjecting the victims to potential criminal \npenalties, and yet avoid legal redress by returning the green cards before trial. \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n4 \nColumbialHCA Healthcare et aI., 110 F.3d 318,334 (6th Cir. 1997) (\"none of the four factors is to \nbe deemed conclusive on its own [and] each need not be viewed in isolation from the others, solely \nas an independent variable\"). \nOne aspect of the analysis is certain: a preliminary injunction shall not issue where there is \nno likelihood of success on the merits. Sandison v. Michi2an Hi2h School Athletic Association, 64 \nF.3d 1026, 1037 (6th Cir.  1995). The certitude of success on the merits need not, however, be \nabsolute. The Sixth Circuit recognizes that a preliminary injunction may be granted where the \nmoving party only shows \"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair \nground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the \npreliminary relief.\" Friendship Materials. Inc. v. Michigan Brick. Inc., 679 F.2d 100, 103 (6th Cir. \n1982) (quoting Sonestalnt'l Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Assocs., 483 F.2d 247,250 (2nd Cir. 1973)). \nAs detailed below, I conclude there are \"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits\" of \nplaintiffs' allegations and a balance of hardships  \"tipping decidedly\" toward plaintiffs. \n1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \na. The Fourth Amendment Applies to this Situation \nA threshold question is whether the Fourth Amendment applies to the case at bar. I have little \ndifficulty in concluding that it does. The Fourth Amendment, which applies to citizens and aliens \nalike, Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266,273 (1973), protects the \"right of the people \nto be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. State officials must comply with the Fourth Amendment when \ndischarging their official duties; thus, OSHP troopers must act in a manner and under circumstances \ncompatible with the Fourth Amendment. \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n5 \nAs  its  language  expressly  indicates,  the  Fourth  Amendment  \"protects  two  types  of \nexpectations, one involving 'searches,' the other 'seizures.'\" United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, \n113 (1984). The Fourth Amendment does not bar all contact between the police and citizenry. It \ndoes, however, \"prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with the \nprivacy and personal security of individuals.\" United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 554 \n(1976). Although \"searches and seizures [must] be founded upon an objective justification,\" no such \njustification is required where there has been neither a search nor a seizure. United States v. \nMendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 551 (1980). As stated in Mendenhall: \nAs long as a person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the \nquestions and walk away, there has been no intrusion upon that person's liberty or \nprivacy as would under the Constitution require some particularized and objective \njustification ... We conclude that a person has been seized within the meaning of the \nFourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the \nincident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. \nId. at 553-54. An officer \"seizes\" an individual only where the officer impairs the individual's right \nto leave.  When a seizure occurs, the Fourth Amendment requires that the seizure have been \nreasonable. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 16 (1968). \nMoreover,  even though a  seizure was  lawful,  it can become unlawful  by becoming \nunreasonably intrusive or prolonged. The scope and duration of a seizure must reasonably relate to \nthe underlying justification for the seizure. Once that justification expires, the seizure must end. As \nstated by the Supreme Court in ThI:o:, 392 U.S. at 19-20, \"in determining whether the seizure and \nsearch were 'unreasonable' [the] inquiry is a dual one--whether the officer's action was justified at \nits inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the \ninterference in the first place.\" Thus, \"the scope of the search must be 'strictly tied to and justified \nA072A \n(Rev.8J82) \n\n6 \nby' the circumstances which rendered its initiation possible.\" .til at 19. An officer must confine his \nor her investigation \"strictly to what was minimally necessary\" to achieve the justified, proper \nobjective. ilL at 30. ~ also Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500 (1983) (officer's search must be \n\"tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered its initiation possible\"). \nIn light of the foregoing, the traffic stops giving rise to this lawsuit indisputably were seizures \nunder the Fourth Amendment. See United States v. Bri~oni-Potice, 422 U.S. 873 (1975) (traffic \nstops implicate the Fourth Amendment). Even if the stops complied with the Fourth Amendment, \nthe officers' subsequent activities must also have met Fourth Amendment requirements: 1.&:., those \nfurther actions must have reasonably been related to the purpose--to enforce Ohio's traffic laws--of \nthe stop. Th!n, 392 U.S. at 30. \nh. Stopping, Detaining, and Searching Motorists \nBased on Hispanic Origin or Appearance \nThe first issue--whether the officer was justified in stopping the plaintiffs' vehicle--asks if \n\"the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search 'warrant a man of \nreasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate.\" kL at 21-22. \"Anything less,\" \nthe Court stated in Th!n, \"would invite intrusions on nothing more substantial than inarticulate \nhunches, a result this Court has consistently refused to sanction.\" llL Thus \"in determining whether \nthe officer acted reasonably in such circumstances, due weight must be given, not to his inchoate and \nunparticularized suspicion or 'hunch,' but to the specific reasonable inferences which he is entitled \nto draw from the facts in light of his experience.\" .tiL at 27. Reasonableness, in all cases, must be \nmeasured by an objective standard, not by the subjective impressions of the particular officer. \nDelaware y. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654-55 (1979). \nA072A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\n7 \nThere can be no question that a seizure based solely on race or ethnicity can never be \nreasonable. In Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. at 884, the Supreme Court, curtailing the authority of \nfederal agents to engage in questioning and searches of potentially illegal immigrants, declared that \nofficers may stop vehicles \"only if they are aware of specific articulable facts, together with rational \ninferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicles contain aliens who \nmay be illegally within the country.\" .ki In other words, an officer must have \"particularized \nsuspicion\" before he or she stops, detains, and questions a potential illegal alien. In finding the \nofficers' actions in Brignoni-Ponce unconstitutional, the Supreme Court stated: \nIn this case the officers relied on a single factor to justify stopping respondent's car: \nthe apparent Mexican ancestry of the occupants. We cannot conclude that this \nfurnished reasonable grounds to believe that the three occupants were aliens. At best \nthe officers had only a fleeting glimpse of the persons in the moving car, illuminated \nby headlights. Even if they saw enough to think the occupants were of Mexican \ndescent, this factor alone would justify neither a reasonable belief that they were \naliens, nor a reasonable belief that the car concealed other aliens who are illegally in \nthe country. Large numbers of native-born and naturalized citizens have the physical \ncharacteristics identified with Mexican ancestry, and even in the border area a \nrelatively small proportion of them are aliens. The likelihood that any given person \nof Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a \nrelevant factor, but standing alone it does not justify stopping all Mexican-Americans \nto ask if they are aliens. \nhL at 885-87. See ~ Murillo v. Musegades, 809 F. SUppa 487,499 (W.D. Tex. 1992); United \nStates v. Ramos, 753 F. SUppa 75, 79-80 (W.D.N.Y. 1990); Ramirez, 599 F. SUppa at 1283. As \nrecently stated by the Sixth Circuit in a case involving seizure of an airline passenger: \ncitizens are entitled to equal protection of the laws at all times. If law en:b. e  t \nadopts a policY, employs a practice, or in a given situation takes steps to 'mitate \ninvestigation of a citizen based solely upon that citizen's race, without more, then a \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause has occurred. \nA072A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\n8 \nUnited States v. Avery,  F.3d  (6th Cir. 1997) (1997 WL 690734, *11 (6th Cir. \n(Ky.)). \nIn the case at bar, if defendants stopped the plaintiffs' vehicle for violations of motor vehicle \nlaws, the stop was \"reasonable\" and thus not violative of the Fourth Amendment. If, however, the \nstop was made because of \"inarticulate hunches\" based solely on plaintiffs' Hispanic appearance, \nthen the stop was unreasonable and violated the Fourth Amendment. \nDefendants claim that the plaintiffs were pulled over because Aguilar's car had a burned out \nheadlight. (Doc. 47 at 3). Plaintiffs admit that they were stopped for a malfunctioning parking light. \n(Doc. 49 at 11). Therefore, plaintiffs do not dispute that there is an objective basis for the initial stop. \nUnder United States v. Ferguson, 8 F.3d 385, 391 (~Cir.l993), a traffic stop is lawful, regardless \nof any subjective motivation on the officer's part, if the stop has an objectively lawful basis under \nthe applicable traffic laws. Because there is no dispute that the initial stop of plaintiffs was \nreasonable under this standard, plaintiffs have presented insufficient proof of a substantial likelihood \nof success on the merits of their claim of initial stops based on ethnicity. \nc.  Questioning As To Immigration Status \nThe plaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza challenge defendants' questioning of them about their \nimmigration status. An initial question is whether ~ officers can ask questions about a person's \nstatus under federal immigration laws. \nThe federal government possesses exclusive power to regulate immigration.  DeCanas v. \nrum \nBica, 424 U.S. 351 (1976). See  Oceanic Steam Nayigation Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U.S. 320,339 \n(1909) (,'Over no conceivable subject is the power of Congress more complete than it is over the \nadmission of aliens\"). Congress has exercised its constitutional authority to regulate immigration by \nA072A \n(Rev. 8182) \n\n9 \nenacting the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. §1101  et seq. The INA and its \naccompanying regulations comprehensively address  issues relating to  immigration, including \nauthorized entry, length of stay, residence status, and deportation. The INA, furthermore, delegates \nenforcement duties to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). No state can add to or \nreduce the force of immigration regulations enacted by Congress. Takahashi v. Fish &  Game \nCorom'n, 334 U.S. 410, 419 (1948). \nIn light of the preemptive reach of federal authority over immigration, the states, at least \narguably, have no interest in, and thus no role to play in the enforcement of federal laws relating to \naliens. As a general rule, however, local police are not precluded from enforcing federal statutes. \nGonzales v. City of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468, 474 (9th Cir.  1983). Thus, where state enforcement \nactivities do not impair federal regulatory interests, concurrent enforcement activity by local and \nfederal enforcement authorities is authorized. Florida Avacado Growers v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142 \n(1963). \nThese general doctrines about the enforceability of federal law by local police were applied \nto immigration laws in Gonzales. In that case the Ninth Circuit concluded that Unothing in federal \nlaw precluded [local]  police from enforcing the criminal provisions of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Act [and] Arizona law authorizes local officers to arrest for violations\" of the Act. \n722 F .2d at 477. In reaching its conclusion that local police could enforce federal immigration laws, \nthe Court in Gonzales examined whether: 1) federal law precluded concurrent enforcement by state \nofficers of federal criminal immigration laws, and 2) state law affirmatively authorized local law \nenforcement officials to enforce federal immigration laws. \nA072A \n(Rev.8182) \n\n10 \nIn Gonzalez, the court detennined that the Arizona legislature authorized police authorities \nin that state to enforce criminal provisions of the federal immigration laws. Arizona's peace officers \nare  authorized to  make  warrantless  misdemeanor arrests.  Federal  immigration laws  include \nmisdemeanors.2  Because Arizona peace officers can make misdemeanor arrests, the court in \nGonzales concluded that Arizona peace officers could make misdemeanor arrests based on violations \nof criminal provisions of the federal immigration laws.  722 F .2d \"at 476. \nI  agree with the court in Gonzales that federal  law does not preclude local or state \nenforcement of the penal provisions of the INA. As stated in Gonzales, the INA does not evidence \n\"an intent to preclude local enforcement of the Act's criminal provisions.\" hL at 474. Likewise, it \ncannot be inferred that \"the federal government has occupied the field of criminal immigration \nenforcement\" to the exclusion of local and state authorities. Id. at 474-75. \nMoreover, the explicit language of § 1324(c ) of the INA leaves open the possibility of local \nor state assistance in the enforcement of federal immigration laws: 'In]o officer or person shall have \nThe pertinent provisions of the federal immigration laws are located at 8 U.S.C. § 1324(c) \n2 \n(penalties for document fraud) and § 1325 (improper entry by aliens). Defendants also claim authority \nto enforce 18 U.S.C. §1028(6) (possession of stolen identification documents), 18 U.S.C. §1426 \n(reproduction of naturalization or citizenship papers), 18 U.S.C. § 1546 (fraud and misuse of visas, \npennits, and other entry documents), and O.R.C.  §2913.31 (forgery). \nUnder federal law, any offense punishable by more than one year in prison is classified as \na felony while any offense punishable by less than one year is either a misdemeanor or infraction. \n18 U.S.C. §3559. A violation of §1324(c) subjects an individual to a cease and desist order along \nwith a civil money penalty. Section 1325, improper entry by an alien first-time offender, is a \nmisdemeanor that occurs at the time of illegal entry. See United States v. Rincon-Jimenez, 595 F.2d \n1192, 1193-94 (9th Cir. 1979). \nViolations of 18 U.S.C. §1028(6) range from felonies to misdemeanors depending on the \nextent of the fraud.  The penalty for  violating  § 1426 is a  fine  of not more than $5,000 or \nimprisonment for not more than five years, or both. A transgression of § 1546 is also a felony, \npunishable by a fine of up to $2,000 or imprisonment of not more than five years, or both. There are \nvarying degrees offelonies for violating the Ohio forgery statute, O.RC. §2913.31, but all violations \nare felonies. \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n11 \nauthority to make any arrest for a violation of any provision of this section except officers and \nemployees of the Service designated by the Attorney General, ... and all other officers whose duty \nit is to enforce criminal laws.\" Thus, any officer, including officers of the OSHP, \"whose duty it is \nto enforce criminal laws\" may, consistent with the doctrine of preemption, enforce the criminal \nprohibitions of the INA. \nIn Ohio, officers of the OSHP are peace officers under O.R.C. §2935.01(B). '''Peace officer' \nincludes a sheriff, deputy sheriff, marshal, ... [and] the superintendent and troopers of the state \nhighway patrol.\" OSHP troopers are authorized to enforce criminal laws on state property. O.R.C. \n§5503.02. This also applies to the turnpike. O.R.C. §5503.31. An offense is defined in O.R.C. \n§2935.01(D) as including,\"felonies, misdemeanors, and violations of ordinances of municipal \ncorporations and other public bodies authorized by law to adopt penal regulations.\" Therefore, OSHP \ntroopers are authorized by Ohio law to enforce the criminal provisions of federal immigration law. \nThis, in turn, means that state officers can, at least in some circumstances, question motorists about \ntheir alienage and immigration status. \nThe constitutionality of such questions to motor vehicle occupants and drivers depends on \nthe second ~ inquiry: namely, whether such investigation is \"reasonably related in scope to the \njustification for [its] initiation\" or \"reasonably designed\" to meet the objectives which justified the \ninterference in the first place. Isan, 392 U.S. at 29. In the context of this case, this means that the \nintrusiveness (i.e., questions about alienage or immigration status) and duration of the stop must bear \na reasonable relation to either the underlying traffic offense or other circumstances that come \nlawfully to the officers' attention during the stop. ~ United States v. Mesa, 62 F.3d 159, 161-62 \n(6th Cir. 1995) (search following a traffic stop improper absent reasonable suspicion for further \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n12 \nquestioning or investigation;  \"[0] nce the purposes of the initial traffic stop were completed, there \nis no doubt that the officer could not further detain the vehicle or its occupants unless something that \noccurred during the traffic stop generated the necessary reasonable suspicion to justify a further \ndetention\") . \nAn example of how an investigation must be reasonably related in scope to the justification \nfor the initial stop appears in Brignoni-Ponce. 422 U.S. 873 (1975). There the Supreme Court held \nthat due to the difficulty of policing the Mexican-United States border, a brief stop and investigation \nfor illegal aliens was justified. kL at 881. The investigation was limited to the circumstances that led \nto the stop, i.e., a suspicion that the car contained illegal aliens: \nAs in ~, the stop and inquiry must be 'reasonably related in scope to the \njustification for their initiation.' 392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. at 1884. The officer may \nquestion the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and \nhe may ask them to explain suspicious circumstances, but any further detention or \nsearch must be based on consent or probable cause. \nkL at 881-82. Because the initial stop was to check for illegal aliens, inquiries about citizenship were \njustified. \nPlaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza were detained for a traffic violation. An inquiry by the OSHP \nas to an individual's immigration status cannot be !treasonably designed\" to meet the objectives of \na traffic stop or \"strictly tied to and justified by\" the circumstances that led to the stop and ensuing \nseizure.  Therefore,  detention  beyond the  time  needed to  issue  a  warning  or citation for  a \nmalfunctioning light, must be based on articulable facts giving rise to reasonable suspicion. Mesa, \n62 F.3d at 162.3 \n3 Officers may also run a computer check on the driver's license, and the vehicle registration. \nUnited States v. Bradshaw, 102 F.3d 204, 212 (6th  Cir. 1996). However, once the license and \nregistration check is complete and the citation is written, any further detention or questioning must \nA072A \n(Rev.8J82) \n\n13 \nIn the context of a conventional traffic stop, therefore, any inquiry about alienage or \nimmigration status must be based on either reasonable suspicion about such status or the occupants' \nconsent. In the instant case, there has been no showing that the officers had reasonable suspicion or \ncause, aside from the plaintiffs' Hispanic appearance,4 to believe that they may have been aliens. The \npolice report, attached as defendants' exhibit A, shows that the plaintiffs had an Illinois driver's \nlicense and an Illinois identification card. (Doc. 47, exh. A). This proves that plaintiffs did not have \nto produce their green cards as their only form of identification. There is no other evidence in the \nrecord or argument by defendants as to the  specific facts  creating reasonable  suspicion for \nquestioning about immigration status. \nAt some point during the encounter, the drug detection dog \"alerted.\" The record is not clear \non the question of whether the alert occurred before or after the inquiry about immigration status and \nseizure of the green cards. I conclude that it is more likely than not that the alert came after, rather \nthan before such inquiry and seizure because there is no indication in the record that the plaintiffs \nwere told they were under arrest before the green cards were taken from them. Had the dog already \nalerted, it is highly likely that the officers would have focused on the apparent presence of drugs, \nrather than taking the time to ask about immigration status and seize the green cards. \nDefendants, apparently aware of the lack of any other basis for questioning the plaintiffs \nabout their immigration status, contend that plaintiffs consented to such questioning and, ultimately, \nbe based on a reasonable suspicion or consent. ~, ID.lI2.D!. \n4 Once the activities incident to the traffic stop had been completed, any further detention of \nthe plaintiffs that was motivated by a desire, based solely on their Hispanic ethnicity, to question \nthem about their immigration status was unlawful under the Equal Protection Clause. See~, \nF .3d at  ,WL 690734 at 4 . \nA072A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\n14 \nseizure of their green cards, which, defendants assert, were voluntarily supplied as a means of \nidentification. (Doc. 47 at 3). When a law enforcement activity is conducted pursuant to valid \nconsent, no claim can be made that a Fourth Amendment violation has occurred. See Schneckloth \nv. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218 (1973). Accord, ~ 392 U.S. at 16 (when a person voluntarily \ncooperates with a law enforcement officer, that individual is in no meaningful way detained and no \nseizure occurs for Fourth Amendment purposes). \nWhere the validity of a search rests on consent, the state has the burden of proving that the \nnecessary consent was obtained and that such consent was freely and voluntarily given. This burden \nis not satisfied by merely showing submission to a claim of lawful authority. Royer, 460 U.S. at 497; \nLo-Ji Sales, Inc. v. New York, 442 U.S. 319, 329 (1979); Bumperv. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, \n548-49 (1968). As stated by the Supreme Court: tithe Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments require \n[that the government] demonstrate that the consent was in fact voluntarily given and not the result \nof duress or coercion, express or implied.\" Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 248-49. In addition, according \nto the Supreme Court: \nwhile most citizens will respond to a police request, the fact that people do so, and \ndo  so without being told they  are  free  not to respond,  hardly  eliminates the \nconsensual nature of the response. Unless the circumstances of the encounter are so \nintimidating as to demonstrate that a reasonable person would have believed he was \nnot free to leave ifhe had not responded, one cannot say that the questioning resulted \nin a detention under the Fourth Amendment. \nINS v. Del~ado, 466 U.S. 210,216 (1984). \nPlaintiffs raise a serious challenge to the alleged consensual nature of defendants' questions \nto them about their immigration status and production of their green cards. Being stopped for a minor \ntraffic offense and given a ticket or warning is one thing; being questioned in a forceful tone by \nA072A \n(Rev.8I82) \n\n15 \nseveral officers, one of whom has arrived on the scene with a drug-sniffmg canine, is quite another. \nPlaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the issue of lack of consent. In sum, with \nregard to defendants' practice of questioning motorists about their immigration status, plaintiffs have \nraised \"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation.\" \nFriendship Materials Inc., 679 F .2d at 103. \nd. Confiscation of Immigration Documents \nFinally, plaintiffs challenge defendants' occasional practice of confiscating green cards. On \nregistering with the INS and providing certain personal information and fingerprints, a legal alien \nis issued \"a certificate of alien registration or an alien registration receipt card.\" 8 U.S.C. §1304(d); \n8 C.F .R. §264 .1. These documents provide legal aliens with proof of their alien registration and legal \nstatus. \nGreen cards playa significant role in the day-to .. day lives of legal aliens. All legal aliens over \nthe age of eighteen are required to carry their green card at all times and failure to do so is a \nmisdemeanor. 8 U.S.C. §1304(e). Furthermore, a green card is a preferred way to procure other \nimportant forms of identification (i.e., a social security card or driver's license) and establish \neligibility  for  a  variety  of  governmental  programs,  including  Medicaid,  unemployment \ncompensation, food stamps, and aid to families with dependent children. Etuk v. Slattery, 936 F.2d \n1433, 1437 (2nd Cir. 1991); Etuk v. Blackman, 748 F. Supp. 990, 992 (E.D.N.Y. 1990). Finally, and \nperhaps most importantly, a legal alien can use his or her green card to establish eligibility to work. \nhL~ also Blackman, 748 F. Supp. at 992. \nBecause the green card is \"the most widely utilized and accepted means of proving [legal \nalien] status,  which in tum enables lawfully admitted aliens to provide for themselves and their \nIt \nA072A \n(Rev.8182) \n\n16 \nv. \ndependents, the Second Circuit held in Etuk  Slattery that the federal immigration laws require the \nINS to provide temporary proof of legal status to aliens whose green cards have been seized. 936 \nF .2d at 1448. I agree with the analysis and conclusion in Slattery that federal law grants legal aliens \nthe right to possess suitable permanent or temporary documentation by which to prove their legal \nstatus after a green card has been seized. \nIf the INS cannot confiscate a green card without providing a temporary substitute, neither \ncan the OSHP.  Just as federal agents \"cannot completely interfere with a [legal alien's] ability to \nearn a living and provide for himself or family,t' Slattety, 936 F.2d at 1447, so too the OSHP cannot \ninterfere so completely with such ability under federal law. 5 \nPlaintiff Aguilar stated in his affidavit that Trooper Kiefer demanded his green card while \nhe was locked in the back seat of the police cruiser. (Doc. 37, Exh. 1). Plaintiff Esparza stated in her \naffidavit that a trooper grabbed her wallet and dug through it until he found her green card. (Doc. 37, \nExh. 2). Defendants admit confiscating immigration documents in their response. (Doc. 47). Thus, \nthe admitted confiscation by defendants of certain immigration documents, in my view, raises \nsubstantial concerns as to which plaintiffs are likely to prevail. Thus, in addition to defendants' \npractice of questioning motorists about their immigration status, the confiscation of immigration-\nrelated documents is a \"fair ground\" for litigation. Friendship Materials. Inc., 679 Fold at 103. \nI note that plaintiffs seek to represent a class of migrant workers. This colloquial description \n5 \nsuggests the importance of green cards to the plaintiffs and members oft he putative class. To get and \nto get to work a migrant laborer necessarily must travel freely and be able to show his or her green \ncard to fanners in whose fields he or she will be working. Employers must verify that everyone they \nhire is not an illegal alien  8 U.S.C. §1324a (b)(1)(A-D). This is accomplished by checking the \nemployee's identification documents. Employers who fail to confinn an alien employee's legal status \nexpose themselves to legal penalties. 8 U.S.C. §1324a (f). Without a green card, an alien migrant \nworker cannot secure lawful employment from a law abiding employer. \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n17 \n2. Possibility of Irreparable Harm to the Plaintiffs \nThere can be no dispute that the violation of an individual's Fourth Amendment rights is a \nserious injury, especially where the violation leads to confiscation of critical documents that, by law, \na legal alien is required to carry under penalty of detention, fine, or even imprisonment. Violations \nof the Fourth Amendment constitute irreparable harm sufficient to justify injunctive relief. Zepeda \nv. INS, 753 F.2d 727 (9th Cir. 1983). Thus, as to defendants' immigration-related activities, the \nsecond prong of the preliminary injunction test is easily satisfied. \n3. Probability That Injunction Will Harm Others \nNo showing has been made that issuance of a preliminary injunction against defendants' \nimmigration-related activities would cause substantial harm to others. Defendants have failed to \nexpress with any degree of specificity how the proposed injunction will hinder their ability to enforce \nthe laws of Ohio or obstruct drug interdiction on Ohio highways. Because defendants are not \nauthorized to seize green cards without supplying substitute identification, an injunction would not \nimpede them from exercising the full breadth of their lawful authority. \nA preliminary injunction against defendantsf immigration-related activities would not require \nthe OSHP to undertake any affirmative act, be it instituting new training procedures or promulgating \nnew rules. A preliminary injunction would not significantly regulate the internal operations of the \nOSHP: it merely would require defendants to act in accordance with the dictates of the Fourth \nAmendment. Preliminary injunctive relief would serve as a prophylaxis against unconstitutional \ntreatment ofHisparucs using Ohio highways. Therefore, the third prong of the preliminary injunction \ntest is satisfied. Taken together, at this point in the litigation, I am persuaded that the balance of \nhardships tips decidedly toward plaintiffs. \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n18 \n4. Advancement of the Public Interest \nFinally, guarding against violations of the Fourth Amendment and federal law serves the \npublic interest. In issuing this preliminary order, I recognize that critical interests are served by state \nofficers zealously enforcing criminal laws, be they state or federal criminal laws, and protecting the \npublic. However, the OSHP may not detain drivers on the basis of ethnicity alone, ~ A very,~, \nand the OSHP lacks authority to seize green cards without supplying substitute identification. \nTherefore, I believe that the public interest would be served by enjoining such practices. \nConclusion \nI am mindful that fundamental principles of federalism restrict the power of a United States \ncourt to interfere with or impinge on the internal affairs of a state agency and the administration of \nstate law. Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362,378 (1976); O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488,500 (1974). \nFurthermore, I recognize that relief against law enforcement authority \"must not be granted lightly, \nfor unduly obtrusive or hasty judicial intervention can undermine the important values of police self-\nrestraint and self-respect.\" Long v. District of Columbia, 469 F.2d 927, 932 (D.C. Cir. 1972). In the \ncourse of briefing, defendants, however, have failed to express with any degree of specificity how \nthey justify on constitutional and legal grounds their inquiries concerning alienage and immigration \nstatus, much less their seizure of green cards without supplying appropriate substitutes. Further, \ndefendants fail to address how the proposed relief would harm the OSHP, other persons or entities, \nor the public interest. The requested injunction appears unlikely to impede the defendants from \nexercising the full breadth of their lawful authority. \nI find that plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their \nclaims concerning questioning about immigration status and seizure of immigration documents, but \nA072A \n(Rev. 8/82) \n\n19 \nhave not shown such likelihood with regard to their claim of stops based on ethnicity. In addition, \nthe other three parts of the preliminary injunction analysis weigh in plaintiffs' favor. Plaintiffs also \nshow that the balance of the hardships tips decidedly in their favor. \nI do not, however, believe that I can enjoin the OSHP absolutely from all questioning as to \nimmigration status. Such questioning is proper if, on the basis of objective, articulable facts, it bears \na reasonable relationship to the circumstances of the initial seizure, there is reasonable suspicion that \nmotorists are in violation of immigration laws, or the motorists have given uncoerced consent to such \nquestioning. The OSHP can, however, be enjoined from questioning about immigration status when \nthose circumstances do not exist. In any event, I perceive no basis in the present record for not \nenjoining the practice of seizing green cards without lawful cause and supplying appropriate \nsubstitute documents. \nTherefore, it is \nORDERED THAT plaintiffs' renewed motion for a preliminary injunction, (Doc. 37), be \nand hereby is, \n1) Denied as to their claim of stops based on ethnicity; \n2) Granted as follows with regard to questioning about immigration status and seizure of \nimmigration documents: \nA) The officers, agents, and employees of the Ohio State Highway Patrol are \nenjoined from questioning motorists about their immigration status  1) without \nreasonable suspicion based on articulable objective facts arising either a) from the \ncircumstances of the initial seizure of motorists or b) other circumstances arising \nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n20 \nduring such seizure that such motorists are in violation of federal law relating to \nimmigration, or 2) uncoerced and otherwise lawful consent to such questioning; and \nB) The officers, agents, and employees of the Ohio State Highway Patrol are enjoined \nfrom seizing immigration documents from motorists absent lawful cause for doing \nso  and,  if such  seizure  occurs,  providing  forthwith  fully  effective  substitute \ndocuments. \nSo ordered. \n\" \n,-~-~--.-.-\n<:J \nJames G.

Ohio, Western Division.\nDecember 8, 1997.\n888999678 *896*897*898 William B. Senhauser, John Mark Finnegan, Equal Justice Foundation, Toledo, OH, for plaintiffs.\nAllen P. Adler, Office of the Attorney General, Columbus, OH, for defendants.\nOrder\nCARR, District Judge.\nThis is a civil rights case in which plaintiffs seek preliminary relief from allegedly unlawful and unconstitutional\npractices by defendants. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Pending is plaintiffs' renewed\nmotion for a preliminary injunction. (Doc. 37). Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition (Doc. 47), and\nplaintiffs filed a reply. (Doc. 49). For the following reasons, plaintiffs' motion shall be granted in part and denied in\npart.\n899  Background\n*899\nPlaintiffs are Hispanic migrant workers who claim that the Ohio State Highway Patrol (OSHP) has violated their\nconstitutional rights by stopping, searching, and detaining them on the basis of race or national origin,\ninterrogating them about their immigration status, and confiscating immigration documents without either\njustification or providing substitute documents. Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction ordering the OSHP to stop\nthese practices. Plaintiffs' earlier motion for a preliminary injunction was denied without prejudice on June 24,\n1997, because none of the named plaintiffs had ever been stopped, and therefore no named plaintiff had\nstanding. (Doc. 31). An amended complaint was filed adding plaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza, who have been\nstopped by the OSHP and questioned about their immigration status and had their immigration documents\nseized. (Doc. 44).\nA. Standing\nThe first step in the preliminary injunction analysis is standing. To establish standing the plaintiffs must show: 1)\ninjury in fact; 2) traceability; and 3) redressibility. Kardules v. City of Columbus, 95 F.3d 1335, 1346 (6th Cir.1996).\nThe injury in fact prong requires that the plaintiff has suffered a concrete or particularized injury that is actual or\nimminent. Id. Plaintiffs are aliens. As such, they possess alien registration receipt cards, also known as \"green\ncards.\" All aliens over the age of eighteen must at all times have possession of their green cards. 8 U.S.C. §\n1304(e). An alien failing to possess his or her green card faces a fine of not more than $100 or imprisonment not\nto exceed thirty days, or both. Id.\nPlaintiffs allege unjustified seizure and retention of green cards by OSHP troopers. If this allegation is proven,\ndefendants have exposed plaintiffs to criminal penalties including possible imprisonment. Thus, if plaintiffs prove\n[1]\nan unjustified seizure and retention of green cards, they have shown a concrete particularized injury.\n\nThese actions are clearly traceable to the defendant, whose troopers are accused of stopping the plaintiffs,\nquestioning them about immigration status, and confiscating their immigration documents. If issued, an injunction\nagainst these practices will clearly redress plaintiffs' grievances. Therefore, plaintiffs meet the three requirements\nof standing and can proceed with their motion for a preliminary injunction.\nB. Requirements For Injunctive Relief\nBefore issuing a preliminary injunction, a district court must consider:\n1) the likelihood that the party seeking the preliminary injunction will succeed on the merits of the\nclaim; 2) whether the party seeking the injunction will suffer irreparable harm without the\ninjunction; 3) the probability that granting the injunction will cause substantial harm to others; and\n4) whether the public interest is advanced by the issuance of the injunction.\n900 Dayton Area Visually Impaired Persons v. Fisher, 70 F.3d 1474, 1480 (6th Cir.1995)*900 (citing Washington v.\nReno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1099 (6th Cir.1994)). Those four considerations are \"factors to be balanced, not\nprerequisites that must be met.\" In re DeLorean Motor Co., 755 F.2d 1223, 1229 (6th Cir. 1985). Thus, \"[n]ot all of\nthese factors fully need to be established for an injunction to be proper,\" and no single factor is to be \"given\ncontrolling weight.\" Michigan State AFLCIO v. Miller, 103 F.3d 1240, 1249 (6th Cir. 1997). Accord, Blue Cross &\nBlue Shield Mutual of Ohio v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare et al., 110 F.3d 318, 334 (6th Cir.1997) (\"none of the four\nfactors is to be deemed conclusive on its own [and] each need not be viewed in isolation from the others, solely\nas an independent variable\").\nOne aspect of the analysis is certain: a preliminary injunction shall not issue where there is no likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits. Sandison v. Michigan High School Athletic Association, 64 F.3d 1026, 1037 (6th Cir.1995).\nThe certitude of success on the merits need not, however, be absolute. The Sixth Circuit recognizes that a\npreliminary injunction may be granted where the moving party only shows \"sufficiently serious questions going to\nthe merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party\nrequesting the preliminary relief.\" Friendship Materials, Inc. v. Michigan Brick, Inc., 679 F.2d 100, 103 (6th\nCir.1982) (quoting Sonesta Int'l Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Assocs., 483 F.2d 247, 250 (2nd Cir.1973)). As\ndetailed below, I conclude there are \"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits\" of plaintiffs' allegations\nand a balance of hardships \"tipping decidedly\" toward plaintiffs.\n1. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\na. The Fourth Amendment Applies to this Situation\nA threshold question is whether the Fourth Amendment applies to the case at bar. I have little difficulty in\nconcluding that it does. The Fourth Amendment, which applies to citizens and aliens alike, Almeida-Sanchez v.\nUnited States, 413 U.S. 266, 273, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), protects the \"right of the people to be\nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const.\namend. IV. State officials must comply with the Fourth Amendment when discharging their official duties; thus,\nOSHP troopers must act in a manner and under circumstances compatible with the Fourth Amendment.\nAs its language expressly indicates, the Fourth Amendment \"protects two types of expectations, one involving\n`searches,' the other `seizures.'\" United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85\n(1984). The Fourth Amendment does not bar all contact between the police and citizenry. It does, however,\n\"prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of\nindividuals.\" United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 554, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976).\nAlthough \"searches and seizures [must] be founded upon an objective justification,\" no such justification is\nrequired where there has been neither a search nor a seizure. United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 551,\n100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980). As stated in Mendenhall:\n\nAs long as a person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk\naway, there has been no intrusion upon that person's liberty or privacy as would under the\nConstitution require some particularized and objective justification ... We conclude that a person\nhas been seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the\ncircumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not\nfree to leave.\nId.446 U.S. at 553-54. An officer \"seizes\" an individual only where the officer impairs the individual's right to\nleave. When a seizure occurs, the Fourth Amendment requires that the seizure have been reasonable. Terry v.\nOhio, 392 U.S. 1, 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).\nMoreover, even though a seizure was lawful, it can become unlawful by becoming unreasonably intrusive or\n901 prolonged. The scope and duration of a seizure must reasonably relate to the underlying justification *901 for the\nseizure. Once that justification expires, the seizure must end. As stated by the Supreme Court in Terry, 392 U.S.\nat 1920, \"in determining whether the seizure and search were `unreasonable' [the] inquiry is a dual one 00\n97\nwhether the officer's action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the\ncircumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\" Thus, \"the scope of the search must be `strictly\ntied to and justified by' the circumstances which rendered its initiation possible.\" Id.392 U.S. at 19. An officer\nmust confine his or her investigation \"strictly to what was minimally necessary\" to achieve the justified, proper\nobjective. Id. at 30. See also Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (officer's\nsearch must be \"tied to and justified by the circumstances which rendered its initiation possible\").\nIn light of the foregoing, the traffic stops giving rise to this lawsuit indisputably were seizures under the Fourth\nAmendment. See United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975) (traffic\nstops implicate the Fourth Amendment). Even if the stops complied with the Fourth Amendment, the officers'\nsubsequent activities must also have met Fourth Amendment requirements: i.e., those further actions must have\nreasonably been related to the purpose 00 to enforce Ohio's traffic laws 00 of the stop. Terry, 392 U.S. at 30.\n97 97\nb. Stopping, Detaining, and Searching Motorists Based on Hispanic\nOrigin or Appearance\nThe first issue 00 whether the officer was justified in stopping the plaintiffs' vehicle 00 asks if \"the facts available to\n97 97\nthe officer at the moment of the seizure or the search `warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief' that the\naction taken was appropriate.\" Id.392 U.S. at 21-22. \"Anything less,\" the Court stated in Terry, \"would invite\nintrusions on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches, a result this Court has consistently refused to\nsanction.\" Id. Thus \"in determining whether the officer acted reasonably in such circumstances, due weight must\nbe given, not to his inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or `hunch,' but to the specific reasonable inferences\nwhich he is entitled to draw from the facts in light of his experience.\" Id. at 27. Reasonableness, in all cases, must\nbe measured by an objective standard, not by the subjective impressions of the particular officer. Delaware v.\nProuse, 440 U.S. 648, 654-55, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396-97, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979).\nThere can be no question that a seizure based solely on race or ethnicity can never be reasonable. In Brignoni-\nPonce, 422 U.S. at 884, the Supreme Court, curtailing the authority of federal agents to engage in questioning\nand searches of potentially illegal immigrants, declared that officers may stop vehicles \"only if they are aware of\nspecific articulable facts, together with rational inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that\nthe vehicles contain aliens who may be illegally within the country.\" Id. In other words, an officer must have\n\"particularized suspicion\" before he or she stops, detains, and questions a potential illegal alien. In finding the\nofficers' actions in Brignoni-Ponce unconstitutional, the Supreme Court stated:\nIn this case the officers relied on a single factor to justify stopping respondents' car: the apparent\nMexican ancestry of the occupants. We cannot conclude that this furnished reasonable grounds to\nbelieve that the three occupants were aliens. At best the officers had only a fleeting glimpse of the\npersons in the moving car, illuminated by headlights. Even if they saw enough to think the\noccupants were of Mexican descent, this factor alone would justify neither a reasonable belief that\n\nthey were aliens, nor a reasonable belief that the car concealed other aliens who are illegally in\nthe country. Large numbers of nativeborn and naturalized citizens have the physical\ncharacteristics identified with Mexican ancestry, and even in the border area a relatively small\nproportion of them are aliens. The likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien\nis high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor, but standing alone it does not\njustify stopping all Mexican-Americans to ask if they are aliens.\n902 *902Id. at 885-87. See also Murillo v. Musegades, 809 F.Supp. 487, 499 (W.D.Tex.1992); United States v.\nRamos, 753 F.Supp. 75, 79-80 (W.D.N.Y.1990); Ramirez, 599 F.Supp. at 1283. As recently stated by the Sixth\nCircuit in a case involving seizure of an airline passenger:\ncitizens are entitled to equal protection of the laws at all times. If law enforcement adopts a policy,\nemploys a practice, or in a given situation takes steps to imitate an investigation of a citizen based\nsolely upon that citizen's race, without more, then a violation of the Equal Protection Clause has\noccurred.\nUnited State v. Avery, 128 F.3d 974, 985 (6th Cir.1997).\nIn the case at bar, if defendants stopped the plaintiffs' vehicle for violations of motor vehicle laws, the stop was\n\"reasonable\" and thus not violative of the Fourth Amendment. If, however, the stop was made because of\n\"inarticulate hunches\" based solely on plaintiffs' Hispanic appearance, then the stop was unreasonable and\nviolated the Fourth Amendment.\nDefendants claim that the plaintiffs were pulled over because Aguilar's car had a burned out headlight. (Doc. 47\nat 3). Plaintiffs admit that they were stopped for a malfunctioning parking light. (Doc. 49 at 11). Therefore,\nplaintiffs do not dispute that there is an objective basis for the initial stop. Under United States v. Ferguson, 8 F.3d\n385, 391 (6th Cir.1993), a traffic stop is lawful, regardless of any subjective motivation on the officer's part, if the\nstop has an objectively lawful basis under the applicable traffic laws. Because there is no dispute that the initial\nstop of plaintiffs was reasonable under this standard, plaintiffs have presented insufficient proof of a substantial\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claim of initial stops based on ethnicity.\nc. Questioning As To Immigration Status\nThe plaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza challenge defendants' questioning of them about their immigration status. An\ninitial question is whether state officers can ask questions about a person's status under federal immigration\nlaws.\nThe federal government possesses exclusive power to regulate immigration. DeCanas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351, 96\nS.Ct. 933, 47 L.Ed.2d 43 (1976). See also Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, 214 U.S. 320, 339, 29\nS.Ct. 671, 53 L.Ed. 1013 (1909) (\"Over no conceivable subject is the power of Congress more complete than it is\nover the admission of aliens\"). Congress has exercised its constitutional authority to regulate immigration by\nenacting the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. The INA and its accompanying\nregulations comprehensively address issues relating to immigration, including authorized entry, length of stay,\nresidence status, and deportation. The INA, furthermore, delegates enforcement duties to the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service (INS). No state can add to or reduce the force of immigration regulations enacted by\nCongress. Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, 334 U.S. 410, 419, 68 S.Ct. 1138, 92 L.Ed. 1478 (1948).\nIn light of the preemptive reach of federal authority over immigration, the states, at least arguably, have no\ninterest in, and thus no role to play in the enforcement of federal laws relating to aliens. As a general rule,\nhowever, local police are not precluded from enforcing federal statutes. Gonzales v. City of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468,\n474 (9th Cir.1983). Thus, where state enforcement activities do not impair federal regulatory interests, concurrent\nenforcement activity by local and federal enforcement authorities is authorized. Florida Lime & Avocado Growers\nv. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 10 L.Ed.2d 248 (1963).\nThese general doctrines about the enforceability of federal law by local police were applied to immigration laws in\nGonzales. In that case the Ninth Circuit concluded that \"nothing in federal law precluded [local] police from\n\nenforcing the criminal provisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Act [and] Arizona law authorizes local\nofficers to arrest for violations\" of the Act. 722 F.2d at 477. In reaching its conclusion that local police could\n903 enforce federal immigration *903 laws, the Court in Gonzales examined whether: 1) federal law precluded\nconcurrent enforcement by state officers of federal criminal immigration laws, and 2) state law affirmatively\nauthorized local law enforcement officials to enforce federal immigration laws.\nIn Gonzales, the court determined that the Arizona legislature authorized police authorities in that state to enforce\ncriminal provisions of the federal immigration laws. Arizona's peace officers are authorized to make warrantless\n[2]\nmisdemeanor arrests. Federal immigration laws include misdemeanors.  Because Arizona peace officers can\nmake misdemeanor arrests, the court in Gonzales concluded that Arizona peace officers could make\nmisdemeanor arrests based on violations of criminal provisions of the federal immigration laws. 722 F.2d at 476.\nI agree with the court in Gonzales that federal law does not preclude local or state enforcement of the penal\nprovisions of the INA. As stated in Gonzales, the INA does not evidence \"an intent to preclude local enforcement\nof the Act's criminal provisions.\" Id. at 474. Likewise, it cannot be inferred that \"the federal government has\noccupied the field of criminal immigration enforcement\" to the exclusion of local and state authorities. Id. at\n474-75.\nMoreover, the explicit language of § 1324(c) of the INA leaves open the possibility of local or state assistance in\nthe enforcement of federal immigration laws: \"[n]o officer or person shall have authority to make any arrest for a\nviolation of any provision of this section except officers and employees of the Service designated by the Attorney\nGeneral, ... and all other officers whose duty it is to enforce criminal laws.\" Thus, any officer, including officers of\nthe OSHP, \"whose duty it is to enforce criminal laws\" may, consistent with the doctrine of preemption, enforce the\ncriminal prohibitions of the INA.\nIn Ohio, officers of the OSHP are peace officers under O.R.C. § 2935.01(B). \"`Peace officer' includes a sheriff,\ndeputy sheriff, marshal, ... [and] the superintendent and troopers of the state highway patrol.\" OSBP troopers are\nauthorized to enforce criminal laws on state property. O.R.C. § 5503.02. This also applies to the turnpike. O.R.C.\n§ 5503.31. An offense is defined in O.R.C. § 2935.01(D) as including, \"felonies, misdemeanors, and violations of\nordinances of municipal corporations and other public bodies authorized by law to adopt penal regulations.\"\nTherefore, OSHP troopers are authorized by Ohio law to enforce the criminal provisions of federal immigration\nlaw. This, in turn, means that state officers can, at least in some circumstances, question motorists about their\nalienage and immigration status.\nThe constitutionality of such questions to motor vehicle occupants and drivers depends on the second Terry\ninquiry: namely, whether such investigation is \"reasonably related in scope to the justification for [its] initiation\" or\n\"reasonably designed\" to meet the objectives which justified the interference in the first place. Terry, 392 U.S. at\n904 29. In the context of this case, this means that the intrusiveness (i.e., questions about alienage *904 or\nimmigration status) and duration of the stop must bear a reasonable relation to either the underlying traffic\noffense or other circumstances that come lawfully to the officers' attention during the stop. See United States v.\nMesa, 62 F.3d 159, 161-62 (6th Cir.1995) (search following a traffic stop improper absent reasonable suspicion\nfor further questioning or investigation; \"[o]nce the purposes of the initial traffic stop were completed, there is no\ndoubt that the officer could not further detain the vehicle or its occupants unless something that occurred during\nthe traffic stop generated the necessary reasonable suspicion to justify a further detention\").\nAn example of how an investigation must be reasonably related in scope to the justification for the initial stop\nappears in U.S. v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975). There the Supreme\nCourt held that due to the difficulty of policing the Mexican-United States border, a brief stop and investigation for\nillegal aliens was justified. Id.422 U.S. at 881. The investigation was limited to the circumstances that led to the\nstop, i.e., a suspicion that the car contained illegal aliens:\nAs in Terry, the stop and inquiry must be `reasonably related in scope to the justification for their\ninitiation.' 392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. at 1884. The officer may question the driver and passengers\nabout their citizenship and immigration status, and he may ask them to explain suspicious\ncircumstances, but any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause.\n\nId. at 881-82. Because the initial stop was to check for illegal aliens, inquiries about citizenship were justified.\nPlaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza were detained for a traffic violation. An inquiry by the OSHP as to an individual's\nimmigration status cannot be \"reasonably designed\" to meet the objectives of a traffic stop or \"strictly tied to and\njustified by\" the circumstances that led to the stop and ensuing seizure. Therefore, detention beyond the time\nneeded to issue a warning or citation for a malfunctioning light, must be based on articulable facts giving rise to\n[3]\nreasonable suspicion. Mesa, 62 F.3d at 162.\nIn the context of a conventional traffic stop, therefore, any inquiry about alienage or immigration status must be\nbased on either reasonable suspicion about such status or the occupants' consent. In the instant case, there has\nbeen no showing that the officers had reasonable suspicion or cause, aside from the plaintiffs' Hispanic\n[4]\nappearance,  to believe that they may have been aliens. The police report, attached as defendants' exhibit A,\nshows that the plaintiffs had an Illinois driver's license and an Illinois identification card. (Doc. 47, exh. A). This\nproves that plaintiffs did not have to produce their green cards as their only form of identification. There is no\nother evidence in the record or argument by defendants as to the specific facts creating reasonable suspicion for\nquestioning about immigration status.\nAt some point during the encounter, the drug detection dog \"alerted.\" The record is not clear on the question of\nwhether the alert occurred before or after the inquiry about immigration status and seizure of the green cards. I\nconclude that it is more likely than not that the alert came after, rather than before such inquiry and seizure\nbecause there is no indication in the record that the plaintiffs were told they were under arrest before the green\ncards were taken from them. Had the dog already alerted, it is highly likely that the officers would have focused\non the apparent presence of drugs, rather than taking the time to ask about immigration status and seize the\ngreen cards.\n905 *905 Defendants, apparently aware of the lack of any other basis for questioning the plaintiffs about their\nimmigration status, contend that plaintiffs consented to such questioning and, ultimately, seizure of their green\ncards, which, defendants assert, were voluntarily supplied as a means of identification. (Doc. 47 at 3). When a\nlaw enforcement activity is conducted pursuant to valid consent, no claim can be made that a Fourth Amendment\nviolation has occurred. See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). \nAccord, Terry, 392 U.S. at 16 (when a person voluntarily cooperates with a law enforcement officer, that individual\nis in no meaningful way detained and no seizure occurs for Fourth Amendment purposes).\nWhere the validity of a search rests on consent, the state has the burden of proving that the necessary consent\nwas obtained and that such consent was freely and voluntarily given. This burden is not satisfied by merely\nshowing submission to a claim of lawful authority. Royer, 460 U.S. at 497; Lo-Ji Sales, Inc. v. New York, 442 U.S.\n319, 329, 99 S.Ct. 2319, 60 L.Ed.2d 920 (1979); Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 548-49, 88 S.Ct. 1788,\n20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968). As stated by the Supreme Court: \"the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments require [that\nthe government] demonstrate that the consent was in fact voluntarily given and not the result of duress or\ncoercion, express or implied.\" Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 248-49. In addition, according to the Supreme Court:\nwhile most citizens will respond to a police request, the fact that people do so, and do so without\nbeing told they are free not to respond, hardly eliminates the consensual nature of the response.\nUnless the circumstances of the encounter are so intimidating as to demonstrate that a\nreasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave if he had not responded, one\ncannot say that the questioning resulted in a detention under the Fourth Amendment.\nINS v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210, 216, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984).\nPlaintiffs raise a serious challenge to the alleged consensual nature of defendants' questions to them about their\nimmigration status and production of their green cards. Being stopped for a minor traffic offense and given a\nticket or warning is one thing; being questioned in a forceful tone by several officers, one of whom has arrived on\nthe scene with a drug-sniffing canine, is quite another. Plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of success\non the issue of lack of consent. In sum, with regard to defendants' practice of questioning motorists about their\n\nimmigration status, plaintiffs have raised \"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair\nground for litigation.\" Friendship Materials Inc., 679 F.2d at 103.\nd. Confiscation of Immigration Documents\nFinally, plaintiffs challenge defendants' occasional practice of confiscating green cards. On registering with the\nINS and providing certain personal information and fingerprints, a legal alien is issued \"a certificate of alien\nregistration or an alien registration receipt card.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1304(d); 8 C.F.R. § 264.1. These documents provide\nlegal aliens with proof of their alien registration and legal status.\nGreen cards play a significant role in the day-to-day lives of legal aliens. All legal aliens over the age of eighteen\nare required to carry their green card at all times and failure to do so is a misdemeanor. 8 U.S.C. § 1304(e).\nFurthermore, a green card is a preferred way to procure other important forms of identification (i.e., a social\nsecurity card or driver's license) and establish eligibility for a variety of governmental programs, including\nMedicaid, unemployment compensation, food stamps, and aid to families with dependent children. Etuk v.\nSlattery, 936 F.2d 1433, 1437 (2nd Cir.1991); Etuk v. Blackman, 748 F.Supp. 990, 992 (E.D.N.Y. 1990). Finally,\nand perhaps most importantly, a legal alien can use his or her green card to establish eligibility to work. Id. See\nalso Blackman, 748 F.Supp. at 992.\nBecause the green card is \"the most widely utilized and accepted means of proving [legal alien] status,\" which in\nturn enables lawfully admitted aliens to provide for themselves and their dependents, the Second Circuit held in \n906 Etuk v. Slattery that the *906 federal immigration laws require the INS to provide temporary proof of legal status\nto aliens whose green cards have been seized. 936 F.2d at 1448. I agree with the analysis and conclusion in \nSlattery that federal law grants legal aliens the right to possess suitable permanent or temporary documentation\nby which to prove their legal status after a green card has been seized.\nIf the INS cannot confiscate a green card without providing a temporary substitute, neither can the OSHP. Just as\nfederal agents \"cannot completely interfere with a [legal alien's] ability to earn a living and provide for himself or\nfamily,\" Slattery, 936 F.2d at 1447, so too the OSBP cannot interfere so completely with such ability under federal\n[5]\nlaw.\nPlaintiff Aguilar stated in his affidavit that Trooper Kiefer demanded his green card while he was locked in the\nback seat of the police cruiser. (Doc. 37, Exh. 1). Plaintiff Esparza stated in her affidavit that a trooper grabbed\nher wallet and dug through it until he found her green card. (Doc. 37, Exh. 2). Defendants admit confiscating\nimmigration documents in their response. (Doc. 47). Thus, the admitted confiscation by defendants of certain\nimmigration documents, in my view, raises substantial concerns as to which plaintiffs are likely to prevail. Thus, in\naddition to defendants' practice of questioning motorists about their immigration status, the confiscation of\nimmigration-related documents is a \"fair ground\" for litigation. Friendship Materials, Inc., 679 F.2d at 103.\n2. Possibility of Irreparable Harm to the Plaintiffs\nThere can be no dispute that the violation of an individual's Fourth Amendment rights is a serious injury,\nespecially where the violation leads to confiscation of critical documents that, by law, a legal alien is required to\ncarry under penalty of detention, fine, or even imprisonment. Violations of the Fourth Amendment constitute\nirreparable harm sufficient to justify injunctive relief. Zepeda v. INS, 753 F.2d 719 (9th Cir. 1983). Thus, as to\ndefendants' immigration related activities, the second prong of the preliminary injunction test is easily satisfied.\n3. Probability That Injunction Will Harm Others\nNo showing has been made that issuance of a preliminary injunction against defendants' immigration-related\nactivities would cause substantial harm to others. Defendants have failed to express with any degree of\nspecificity how the proposed injunction will hinder their ability to enforce the laws of Ohio or obstruct drug\ninterdiction on Ohio highways. Because defendants are not authorized to seize green cards without supplying\n\nsubstitute identification, an injunction would not impede them from exercising the full breadth of their lawful\nauthority.\nA preliminary injunction against defendants' immigration-related activities would not require the OSHP to\nundertake any affirmative act, be it instituting new training procedures or promulgating new rules. A preliminary\ninjunction would not significantly regulate the internal operations of the OSHP: it merely would require defendants\nto act in accordance with the dictates of the Fourth Amendment. Preliminary injunctive relief would serve as a\nprophylaxis against unconstitutional treatment of Hispanics using Ohio highways. Therefore, the third prong of\nthe preliminary injunction test is satisfied. Taken together, at this point in the litigation, I am persuaded that the\nbalance of hardships tips decidedly toward plaintiffs.\n4. Advancement of the Public Interest\nFinally, guarding against violations of the Fourth Amendment and federal law serves the public interest. In issuing\n907 this preliminary order, I recognize that critical interests *907 are served by state officers zealously enforcing\ncriminal laws, be they state or federal criminal laws, and protecting the public. However, the OSHP may not\ndetain drivers on the basis of ethnicity alone, see Avery, supra, and the OSHP lacks authority to seize green\ncards without supplying substitute identification. Therefore, I believe that the public interest would be served by\nenjoining such practices.\nConclusion\nI am mindful that fundamental principles of federalism restrict the power of a United States court to interfere with\nor impinge on the internal affairs of a state agency and the administration of state law. Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S.\n362, 378, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976); O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 500, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d\n674 (1974). Furthermore, I recognize that relief against law enforcement authority \"must not be granted lightly, for\nunduly obtrusive or hasty judicial intervention can undermine the important values of police self-restraint and self-\nrespect.\" Long v. District of Columbia, 469 F.2d 927, 932 (D.C.Cir.1972). In the course of briefing, defendants,\nhowever, have failed to express with any degree of specificity how they justify on constitutional and legal grounds\ntheir inquiries concerning alienage and immigration status, much less their seizure of green cards without\nsupplying appropriate substitutes. Further, defendants fail to address how the proposed relief would harm the\nOSHP, other persons or entities, or the public interest. The requested injunction appears unlikely to impede the\ndefendants from exercising the full breadth of their lawful authority.\nI find that plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claims concerning\nquestioning about immigration status and seizure of immigration documents, but have not shown such likelihood\nwith regard to their claim of stops based on ethnicity. In addition, the other three parts of the preliminary injunction\nanalysis weigh in plaintiffs' favor. Plaintiffs also show that the balance of the hardships tips decidedly in their\nfavor.\nI do not, however, believe that I can enjoin the OSHP absolutely from all questioning as to immigration status.\nSuch questioning is proper if, on the basis of objective, articulable facts, it bears a reasonable relationship to the\ncircumstances of the initial seizure, there is reasonable suspicion that motorists are in violation of immigration\nlaws, or the motorists have given uncoerced consent to such questioning. The OSHP can, however, be enjoined\nfrom questioning about immigration status when those circumstances do not exist. In any event, I perceive no\nbasis in the present record for not enjoining the practice of seizing green cards without lawful cause and\nsupplying appropriate substitute documents.\nTherefore, it is\nORDERED THAT plaintiffs' renewed motion for a preliminary injunction, (Doc. 37), be and hereby is,\n1) Denied as to their claim of stops based on ethnicity;\n\n2) Granted as follows with regard to questioning about immigration status and seizure of\nimmigration documents:\nA) The officers, agents, and employees of the Ohio State Highway Patrol are enjoined from\nquestioning motorists about their immigration status 1) without reasonable suspicion based on\narticulable objective facts arising either a) from the circumstances of the initial seizure of motorists\nor b) other circumstances arising during such seizure that such motorists are in violation of federal\nlaw relating to immigration, or 2) uncoerced and otherwise lawful consent to such questioning; and\nB) The officers, agents, and employees of the Ohio State Highway Patrol are enjoined from\nseizing immigration documents from motorists absent lawful cause for doing so and, if such\nseizure occurs, providing forthwith fully effective substitute documents.\nSo ordered.\n[1] The parties did not addressed the question of whether return to plaintiffs of their green cards has mooted their\ndemand for preliminary injunctive relief. There are two reasons this action is not mooted by the return of green\ncards. First, plaintiffs are a class whose claims are not dismissed as moot due to the resolution of the class\nrepresentative's claims. Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975), (\"the issue sought to\nbe litigated escapes full appellate review at the behest of any single challenger, does not inexorably become\nmoot by the intervening resolution of the controversy as to the named plaintiffs,\"). Second, even if this were an\nindividual action it would not be mooted because this is a situation that is capable of repetition but evasive of\njudicial review and redress. Where the facts that are the basis of the litigation expire before judicial review, but\nare capable of repetition, there is a live controversy. Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce\nCommission, 219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911),Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 124-25, 93 S.Ct.\n705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). In United States v. New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 165, 98 S.Ct. 364, 54 L.Ed.2d\n376 (1977), the Supreme Court found a live controversy where the judicial order that was the basis for the suit\nhad expired. Because such orders would always expire before judicial review, and the challenged practice could\nbe repeated, the controversy was not moot. Here, the OSHP could continue to seize green cards unlawfully,\nsubjecting the victims to potential criminal penalties, and yet avoid legal redress by returning the green cards\nbefore trial.\n[2] The pertinent provisions of the federal immigration laws are located at 8 U.S.C. § 1324(c) (penalties for\ndocument fraud) and § 1325 (improper entry by aliens). Defendants also claim authority to enforce 18 U.S.C. §\n1028(a)(6) (possession of stolen identification documents), 18 U.S.C. § 1426 (reproduction of naturalization or\ncitizenship papers), 18 U.S.C. § 1546 (fraud and misuse of visas, permits, and other entry documents), and\nO.R.C. § 2913.31 (forgery). \nUnder federal law, any offense punishable by more than one year in prison is classified as a felony while any\noffense punishable by less than one year is either a misdemeanor or infraction. 18 U.S.C. § 3559. A violation of §\n1324(c) subjects an individual to a cease and desist order along with a civil money penalty. Section 1325,\nimproper entry by an alien first-time offender, is a misdemeanor that occurs at the time of illegal entry. See United\nStates v. Rincon-Jimenez, 595 F.2d 1192, 1193-94 (9th Cir.1979).\nViolations of 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(6) range from felonies to misdemeanors depending on the extent of the fraud.\nThe penalty for violating § 1426 is a fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years, or\nboth. A transgression of § 1546 is also a felony, punishable by a fine of up to $2,000 or imprisonment of not more\nthan five years, or both.

To get and to get to work a migrant\nlaborer necessarily must travel freely and be able to show his or her green card to farmers in whose fields he or\nshe will be working. Employers must verify that everyone they hire is not an illegal alien 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(1)\n(A-D). This is accomplished by checking the employee's identification documents.

This is a civil rights class action in three Counts.  The suit challenges the \npractice of the Ohio State Highway Patrol of making automobile stops, detentions and \nsearches, with or without lawful grounds to stop, detain and search, based on race \nand/or national origin. \n2.  Count I is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988 and 28 U.S.C. § \n2201 .et~. for violations of the First and the Fourth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution.  In Count I, plaintiffs seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief and money damages for themselves and for the plaintiff class. \n3.  Count II is brought pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000d .et~., as amended, and 28 CFR § 32.101 .m~., the administrative \nregulations of the United States Department of Justice effectuating Title VI.  In this \nCount, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief and money damages for \nthemselves and for the plaintiff class. \n4.  In Count III, plaintiffs invoke the supplemental jurisdiction of this Court \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1376, and raise claims under state constitutional and common \nlaw.  In Count III, plaintiffs seek money damages for themselves and for the plaintiff \nclass. \n2 \n\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  The jurisdiction of the Court in Counts I and II is founded on 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343 (a) (3) & (4) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1.  Jurisdiction in Count III is based \non this Court's supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \n6.  Venue is proper in this Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (b) (2), \nbecause defendant the Ohio State Highway Patrol maintains an office, and defendant \nDavies resides, in this district. \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) is a Union of migrant \nand seasonal farm workers.  It is based in Toledo, Ohio, and has approximately 15,000 \nmembers nationwide.  During the harvest season, FLOC has approximately eight \nthousand members traveling and residing in Ohio.  These members are predominately \nHispanic, and virtually all of them will drive in Ohio or travel in vehicles driven on Ohio's \nhighways by Hispanic drivers.  FLOC's members are currently traveling through or \nresiding in Ohio, and will return year after year.  In addition, many of FLOC's members \nwork and reside in Michigan, and travel from Florida and other points South through \nOhio en route to their employment.  FLOC conducts much of its business on the \nhighways of Ohio, and its organizers have been victims of defendants' actions. \nPlaintiffs Fernando Cuevas Sr. and Fernando Cuevas Jr. are members of, as well as \nemployees of, FLOC.  Plaintiff Merced Valdez and several other plaintiffs are members \nof FLOC. \n3 \n\n8.  Plaintiff Merced Valdez is a resident of Ohio. He is Hispanic, and is a \nUnited States citizen.

Defendant Ohio State Highway Patrol (\"Highway Patrol\" or \"O.H.P.\") is a \nm \nstate law-enforcement agency.  Pursuant to O.R.C. § 5503.01  s.e.Q., the O.H.P. is \nempowered to enforce the laws of the State of Ohio.  The O.H.P. is a recipient of \nfederal funds.  The O.H.P. is a defendant in Count II only, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n2000d-7. \n17.  Defendant Colonel Warren Davies (\"Davies\") is the Superintendent of the \nO. H. P., defendant Davies is sued in his individual capacity for money damages and in \nhis official capacity for purposes of injunctive relief.  Defendant Davies is authorized to \nmake policy for the defendant O.H.P. \n18.  Defendant Bruce Elling is a Sergeant with the Ohio State Highway Patrol \nand a quadrant supervisor of the \"Traffic Drug Interdiction Team,') a program of the \nO.H.P. that focuses on stops and searches of drivers and vehicles on the streets and \nhighways of the Northwest part of Ohio.  He is authorized to make policy for those \ndefendants involved in the Traffic Drug Interdiction Team.  He is sued in his individual \ncapacity for money damages and in his capacity as supervisor for purposes of \ninjunctive relief \n19.  Defendant Berry Elders is the head of the Swanton Highway Patrol Post \nlocated along the Ohio Turnpike between Exits 3 and 3A south of Toledo.  He is sued in \nhis individual capacity for money damages and in his official capacity as Post \nCommander for purposes of injunctive relief. \n20.  Defendants Kevin Kiefer, Rebecca Ambrose, and Steven R. Blue are \ntroopers of the Ohio State Highway Patrol.  Plaintiffs also sue other, unknown officers of \n5 \n\nthe Highway Patrol who effectuated the stops, detentions and searches of the named \nplaintiffs, as well as unknown officers of the Highway Patrol who have effectuated the \nstops, detentions and searches of other class members.  All such officers are sued in \ntheir individual capacities only. \n21.  At all times pertinent hereto, all defendants were acting under color of \nstate law and their conduct constituted state action. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n22.  Plaintiffs bring this Complaint as a class action under Rule 23 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiffs seek to represent, pursuant to Rules 23 (b) \n(2) and 23 (b) (3), a class of all persons traveling on the streets and highways of Ohio, \nwho, because of their national origin and/or race, in the past have been, or in the future \nwill be, stopped, detained, searched, with or without legally sufficient cause and \njustification, and/or harassed. \n23.  All of the prerequisites to a class action as stated in Rule 23 (a) are \nsatisfied by the class. \na.  Numerous individuals have been stopped, detained and also often \nsearched by defendants pursuant to defendants' unlawful practices, and \nnumerous individuals will be in the future.  Therefore, the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nb.  There are questions of law and fact common to the plaintiff class. \nThe common questions include whether the defendants' practices \ndescribed below of stopping, detaining and also often searching persons \n6 \n\non the basis of national origin and/or race with or without legally sufficient \ncause and justification unconstitutionally burdens the First, Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendment rights of those so stopped, detained and \nsearched, their constitutional right to freedom of movement and the \ncorresponding state constitutional guarantees. \nc.  The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the \nclass:  the named plaintiffs were stopped, detained and also searched \npursuant to the practices challenged here, as were members of the \nclass. \nd.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the \ninterests of the class: they have no interests antagonistic to the class; \nthey seek declaratory and injunctive relief and money damages on behalf \nof the entire class and such relief will benefit all members of the \nclass; and they are represented by counsel who are competent and \nexperienced in civil rights and class action litigation. \n24.  The class satisfies Rule 23 (b) (2) because the defendants have engaged \nin a course of conduct common to all members of the class, and final declaratory and \ninjunctive relief in favor of the plaintiff class is therefore appropriate.  In addition, the \nclass satisfies Rule 23 (b) (3) because the questions of law and fact common to \nmembers of the class predominate over any questions affecting individual members \nand a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of the controversy. \n7 \n\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nDefendants' First Unlawful practice \n25.  It is the practice of the Highway Patrol and its officers to stop, detain and \nalso often search individuals traveling on streets and highways in Ohio because of the \ntravelers' race and/or national origin, with or wi.t~~.L:J~.I~~~.!.Iy'~ufficient cause and \njustification (\"the first practice\").  Each of the na\".:1.~~ .. 'pI~i.o.~i.ff~~~ve been victims of the \n................~ _ ••••••- \"' ..... .,.• ••••••'  ...............................• •• ..• ••• ..•  ........... -.·. ..• •••• ••• A ...........  _ ••••••• _ ••••••••••' .'. ....... _ •••••••••••• \nfirst practice. \n26.  The first practice is widespread and systemic.  For example, defendant \nTrooper Rebecca Ambrose admitted under oath: \"There are what you could call a \nprofile stop and I, I mean if you saw a Hispanic person, possibly Hispanic, or a Mexican \nor whoever by themselfs [sic], that would be a profile, if you're facing, if you're making a \nstop just on just on what you saw\". \nT \nDefendants' Second Unlawfyl practice \n27.  At times, when defendants engage in the first practice, they also question \nsome or all of the occupants of vehicles as to their immigration status, including \n--,---- -\n'-~.--~ ........•  .............. ...................  \ndemands to see immigration documents (\"the second practice\").  This is a routine \npractice.  Defendants have admitted identifying \"large numbers of illegal aliens\" during \n\"routine traffic stops\". \nDefendants' Third Unlawful practice \n28.  At times, when defendants engage in the first and second practices, \ndefendants confiscate class members' immigration documents including lawfully issued \nT \n,,~...-................ ~ •• ,.o.AA.\". .........._  .-...• •' \"\"-V~~-'~ ...._ .....-.-...-.. _  .>¥J>._ ..............~  ........... .\".,.........  • ..........- ••••••- ... ~ •••••• \ncertificates of alien registration or alien registration receipt cards (\"the third practicelt\n). \n8 \n\nDefendants keep these lawfully issued certificates of alien registration or alien \nregistration receipt cards for long periods of time.  Defendants' third practice subjects \naliens to federal criminal prosecution for failure to possess their lawfully issued \ncertificates of alien registration or alien registration receipt cards.  In addition, \ndefendants are committing a federal criminal act by causing these persons to be \nwithout their lawfully issued certificates of alien registration or alien registration receipt \ncards. \n29.  Defendant Trooper Kevin Kiefer told several witnesses that an individual \nnamed Coutcher, whom plaintiffs believe is a federal law-enforcement agent with an \noffice at the Toledo Airport, has traveled around the State of Ohio -t-r..a--i-n-_in g O.H.P. \n--\n..  .............................. .. \ntroopers to confiscate aliens' immigration documents, and bring them to Coutcher, who \n-\n..................... \"..........  .. . ... ~-.......................... ~ ............................ -. .....................  . ...................... . \nchecks the documents through a computer system.  Kiefer said that it is his practice to \ncollect immigration documents from alien travelers from Saturday through Thursday, \nand deliver the confiscated documents on Fridays to agent Coutcher. \n30.  Defendants' practices as described above are widespread.  Individuals \nare stopped, detained and also often searched pursuant to the three practices in all \nareas of the State of Ohio on a persistent, recurrent basis. \nThe Stop, Detention and Search of plaintiff Merced Valdez \n31.  Approximately six months ago, an unknown Highway Patrol officer who \nwas behind Plaintiff Merced Valdez's car turned on his flashing lights, signaling Mr. \nMerced Valdez to pull over.  Mr Merced Valdez pulled the car over to the right shoulder. \n9 \n\n32.  The officer approached the car and asked for Mr. Merced Valdez's \nlicense.  After Mr. Merced Valdez provided his license, the trooper demanded to see his \nimmigration papers.  Mr. Merced Valdez is a United States citizen and as a result \npossesses no immigration papers. \n33.  When Mr. Merced Valdez questioned the trooper's request for immigration \npapers, the trooper gruffly ordered Mr. Valdez out of the car, and ordered him to raise \nhis hands and face away from his car.  Upon information and belief, the trooper then \nsearched Mr. Valdez' car.  Mr. Valdez never consented in any way to the trooper's \nactions. \n34.  Eventually, the trooper instructed Mr. Merced Valdez that he was free to \ngo.  No ticket or citation of any sort was issued. \nThe Stop, Detention and Search of plaintiff Margarito Olivares \n35.  Plaintiff Margarito Olivares is a migrant farm worker who resides in farm \nlabor camps in Ohio during part of the year.  During August, 1996, he was walking \nalong a state route near Fremont, Ohio, returning to his farm labor camp from a nearby \ngrocery store.  A Highway Patrol trooper stopped him, and demanded to search his \ngrocery bag.  The trooper also demanded to see his identification, and carefully \nexamined Mr. Olivares' lawfully issued alien registration receipt card.  The trooper then \nordered Mr. Olivares to return directly to his farm labor camp, without making any \ndetours.  The trooper never explained to Mr. Olivares why he was detained and \nsearched. \n10 \n\nThe Stop, Detention and Search of plaintiff Melissa Lopez \n36.  Plaintiff Melissa Lopez is a farm worker near Fremont, Ohio.  In August, \n1996, she, her mother, and her daughter were driving her car en route to a migrant farm \nlabor camp near Fremont.  A Highway Patrol trooper drove out from a corn field and \nstopped Ms. Lopez next to the farm labor camp.  The trooper asked Ms. Lopez several \nquestions of a personal nature while peering into the interior of Ms. Lopez's car.  None \nof the Lopezes were given any ticket or citation of any sort.  Throughout the summer of \n1996, members of the Highway Patrol have routinely parked next to this farm labor \ncamp, and watched the camp and its occupants from their cars.  The camp is on an \nisolated back road in Sandusky County, with very little traffic. \nThe Stop. Detention and Search of plaintiffs Guadalupe and EsebjQ AriQla \n37.  Guadalupe and Eusebio Ariola are migrant farm workers who live part of \nthe year in Texas and part of the year in migrant farm labor housing near Fremont, \nOhio.  In June of 1996, Eusebio was driving the family in a van on the turnpike between \nFremont and Toledo, Ohio.  It was approximately 2:30 in the afternoon.  They were \nstopped by two troopers of the Highway Patrol.  Almost immediately a sport utility \nvehicle arrived with a drug-sniffing dog.  The trooper asked the Ariolas to sign a \nconsent to search form.  When the Ariolas asked why the troopers wanted to search the \nvan, the trooper said that \"it was procedure\".  Reasonably believing that they could not \nrefuse, Eusebio signed.  The van was thoroughly searched for an extended period of \ntime.  After finding no contraband of any sort, the troopers searched Guadalupe Ariola's \n11 \n\npurse and wallet, looking through each of her cards.  The Ariolas were given no ticket \nor written citation of any sort. \nThe First Stop, Detention and Search of plaintiff Fernando Cyeyas, Jr. \n38.  Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas, Jr. is an organizer for the Farm Labor \nOrganizing Committee (FLOC).  He is a citizen of the United States.  During the \nsummer in 1993, he was driving on FLOC business.  He was pulled over on Interstate \n280 by five Highway Patrol officers.  One of the officers demanded to see his license \nand vehicle registration.  Mr. Cuevas, Jr. was told that he was being held \"on \nsuspicion\".  The officers demanded to search Mr. Cuevas' pick-up truck.  Reasonably \nbelieving that he was not allowed to refuse, Mr. Cuevas permitted his vehicle to be \nsearched. \n39.  Highway Patrol officers detained Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas, Jr. for \napproximately two and one-half hours, while the officers searched his truck.  Absolutely \nno contraband was found.  Mr. Cuevas was released and was given no warning ticket \nnor citation of any type.  He missed his Union farm labor camp meeting. \nThe Second Stop, Detention and Search of plaintiff Fernandez Cyeyas. Jr. \n40.  Later during the summer of 1993 while again conducting FLOC business, \nMr. Cuevas Jr. was driving on State Route 20 just outside of Woodville, Ohio.  A \nHighway Patrol officer ordered him to pull over.  The officer demanded that he turn over \nhis license and registration.  The officer repeatedly questioned Mr. Cuevas concerning \nuse of funds from an Ohio bank to purchase a truck registered in Florida.  After \n12 \n\napproximately one-half hour, Mr. Cuevas was released.  He was not issued a warning \nticket or citation of any sort. \nThe Third Stop, Detention and Search of plaintiff Fernandez Cyeyas, Jr. \n41.  During September, 1995, Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas, Jr. was driving on \nthe Ohio Turnpike just west of the Toledo Airport.  It was approximately noon, and he \nwas driving a car registered to the Farm Labor Research Project (FLRP).  He was \naccompanied by his father, Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas, Sr., who is the first vice \npresident of FLOC.  They were driving from one Union camp meeting to another. \n42.  Plaintiff Fernando Cuevas, Jr. had the cruise control set at the speed limit. \nThey passed a Highway Patrol trooper parked at the side of the tumpike.  The trooper \nbegan to follow them.  Approximately two miles ahead, they saw three more Highway \nPatrol cruisers parked on the side of the turnpike.  One of those troopers signaled the \nCuevas' to stop, which they did. \n43.  Once stopped, both of the Cuevas' were ordered to produce their drivers' \nlicenses and car registration.  After each complied, each was separately questioned at \nlength by the troopers about who they were visiting, what they were doing, who they \nhad talked with, and what their plans were.  All four of the O.H.P. cruisers stayed at the \nscene.  In the course of questioning, one of the troopers learned that the car was \nregistered to FLRP.  Eventually, the Cuevases were released.  The Highway Patrol \nofficers did not issue a ticket, warning or citation of any sort. \n13 \n\nThe First Stop, Detention and Search of plaintiffs Francisco and Alicia QYintero \n44.  In 1991  Plaintiffs Francisco and Alicia Quintero and their four children \nJ \nwere driving on the Ohio Turnpike west of Toledo en route to visit their seriously ill \nmother in Texas, when they were detained by three O.H.P. cruisers and one \nundercover car carrying a drug sniffing dog.  The Quintero's car and possessions were \nsearched for over one hour.  No contraband was found.  They were not given a ticket or \ncitation of any sort. \nThe Second Stop, Detention and Search of Francisco and Alicia QYintero \n45.  On or about March, 1996, Plaintiffs Francisco and Alicia Quintero were \ndriving in Northwestern Ohio when they were stopped by an unmarked O.H.P. car. \nFrancisco and their four children were ordered out of the car, and their car and the \nfamilies' possessions were searched for approximately forty minutes.  They were not \nasked to produce their drivers' licenses, registration or any form of identification.  They \nwere issued no warning, ticket nor citation of any sort. \nOther Instances of Defendants' Unlawfyi practices \n46.  Both prior and subsequent to the named plaintffs being stopped, detained \nand searched by Highway Patrol troopers based on national origin and/or race with or \nwithout legally sufficient cause and justification, numerous other Hispanics and persons \nof color have been subjected to defendants' persistently applied practices, in many \ninstances, multiple times.  Among these applications of defendants' practices are the \nfollowing: \n14 \n\nThe Stop, Detention and Search of Jose Aguilar and Irma Esparza \n47.  Mr. Jose Aguilar and Ms. Irma Esparza are lawfully admitted permanent \nresident aliens.  Approximately one year ago, they were driving their van from Chicago, \nIllinois, to Toledo, Ohio.  It was approximately 1: 30 pm on a Sunday, it was raining, and \nthey had turned on their head-lights. \n48.  Their van was stopped by four Highway Patrol vehicles and several \nofficers.  One of the vehicles had a drug sniffing dog.  The officers issued Mr. Aguilar a \nwarning citation for an improper headlight.  One officer used the drug sniffing dog to \nsearch Mr. Aguilar's car, while other officers partially dismantled the car, searched \nthrough the car seats, opened a locked trunk and searched through the couple's \nsuitcases and other personal possessions.  Mr. Aguilar and Ms. Esparza, who speak \nvirtually no English, were powerless to stop the violation of their rights.  They did not \nconsent to the search. \n49.  When the officers found no contraband, they seized Mr. Aguilar's and Ms. \nEsparza's lawfully issued certificates of alien registration or alien registration receipt \ncards and left the location.  The Highway Patrol officers gave no reason for confiscating \nthe certificates of alien registration or alien registration receipt cards, did not inform Mr. \nAguilar or Ms. Esparza where the cards were being taken, whether their cards would be \nreturned to them or whom to contact to learn any information relating to their cards. \nThere is no lawful explanation for the search and seizure by the Highway Patrol officers \nof lawfully issued certificates of alien registration or alien registration receipt cards to \nlawfully residing Permanent Resident Aliens Aguilar and Esparza. \n15 \n\n50.  At no time did Mr. Aguilar or Ms. Esparza consent to the stop, detention or \nsearch.  At all times, Mr. Aguilar made clear his refusal to consent to the continuing \ndetention and the search and his wish to continue on his way. \nThe Stop of Cynthia Rujz \n51.  Cynthia Ruiz resides in Texas and is employed as a county prosecutor. \nShe is Hispanic.  During the summer of 1994, while she was employed as a summer \nlaw clerk for Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, Inc. (ABLE), in Fremont, Ohio, she \nwas stopped on the Ohio Turnpike by a Highway Patrol trooper.  He asked her several \npersonal questions, and then said that the car smelled like marijuana and asked her if \nshe had been smoking marijuana that morning.  She had not.  The trooper then asked \nto search her car.  She refused.  The trooper continued to attempt to intimidate her. \nShe finally demanded to be ticketed or released.  The trooper finally released her.  She \nwas issued no warning, ticket or citation of any sort. \nThe Stop, Detention and Search of Ryben Valdez \n52.  Ruben Valdez is a resident of Ohio.  He is Hispanic, and is a United \nStates citizen. While driving home in Defiance, Ohio in 1996, Ruben Valdez was \ndetained at gun-point by several police officers.  An unknown Highway Patrol trooper \nwas present during the stop and search of Ruben Valdez's car.  At no time did Mr. \nRuben Valdez consent to the stop, detention or search of the car.  No drugs, guns, \ncontraband or evidence of illegal activity was found.  Mr. Ruben Valdez was not given a \nticket, warning or citation of any sort. \n16 \n\nGeneral Allegations Concerning Defendants' Condyct \n53.  Each Plaintiffs auto was stopped without re~s.~na~_~.~,\",~~~~picion of unlawful \n..... ... . .... ~ .. -.. \nactivity.  No plaintiff was engaged in any illegal activity.  Each plaintiff was detained at \nthe roadside without reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity and the length of each \nplaintiffs detention exceeded a reasonable amount of time for an investigative stop, \neven if such stop had been lawful.  Each plaintiffs car and possessions were searched \nwithout probable cause. \n54.  The complained of conduct by each defendant was motivated by plaintiffs' \nnational origin and/or race. \n55.  The stop, detention and search of plaintiffs was pursuant to the three \npractices stated above. \n56.  Defendants Davies, Elling, and Elders either authorized or knowingly \nacquiesced in the unconstitutional actions of their subordinates, and they were \ndeliberately indifferent to constitutional violations likely to result from serious \ndeficiencies in the training program of Highway Patrol officers concerning stopping of \nvehicles on a prohibited basis. \n57.  Each defendant and the other unknown officers acted knowingly and \nintentionally.  Moreover, their actions were taken with recklessness or callous disregard \nfor plaintiffs' rights. \n58.  The actions of defendants in unlawfully stopping and detaining plaintiffs \nand searching their cars, persons and possessions have had a disproportionate effect \non Hispanics and other persons of color have penalized plaintiffs for the exercise of \n17 \n\ntheir constitutional right to freedom of movement in the State of Ohio and have hindered \nplaintiffs' exercise of that right. \nInjyry To plaintiffs \n59.  As a direct and proximate result of defendants' conduct as stated herein, \nplaintiffs and the class they seek to represent have suffered humiliation, \nembarrassment, mental fright and emotional distress.  In addition, defendants' conduct \nhas hindered plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent in freely traveling the \nstreets and highways in the State of Ohio.  Defendants' actions have had a \ndiscriminatory impact against plaintiffs and class members. \nNecessity for Injynctiye Relief \n60.  Each plaintiff presently either resides in Ohio or has family, friends or \nbusiness interests in Ohio and thus expects to travel Ohio's highways in the future. \nThey wish to be free to travel to and in Ohio and on highways in Ohio without being \nstopped, detained and searched pursuant to the defendants' unlawful practices. \nPlaintiff FLOC is hindered in its mission and in its operation by defendants' actions. \n61.  Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent are threatened with \nsubstantial, immediate and irreparable injury at the hands of the defendants. \nDefendants began their practices of stopping, detaining and also often searching \nHispanic persons traveling on highways in Ohio based on national origin and/or race \nbefore the incidents involving the named plaintiffs, and defendants continue to engage \nin the practices against the numerous members of the class.  Individual Highway Patrol \ntroopers are authorized by the Highway Patrol to engage in the conduct to which the \n18 \n\nnamed plaintiffs and numerous other Hispanics and persons of color have been \nsubjected.  Plaintiffs will also continue in the future to suffer the ongoing effects of \ndefendants' past applications of the practice to them. \n62.  Unless restrained by this Court, defendants will continue their unlawful \npractices.  Pursuant to these practices, plaintiffs are likely in the future to be stopped, \ndetained and searched by defendants based on national origin and/or race with or \nwithout legally sufficient cause and justification.  Plaintiffs continue to, and will in the \nfuture, travel on streets and highways in Ohio patrolled by the Highway Patrol.  Plaintiffs \nwill continue to be unable, even by fully conforming their conduct to all legal \nrequirements, to avoid being stopped, detained and also often searched by defendants \npursuant to defendants' unlawful practices. \n63.  Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable injury and, in the absence of injunctive \nrelief, will continue to suffer irreparable injury.  They have no adequate remedy at law. \nJury Demand \n64.  Plaintiffs demand trial by jury. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n(Interference with Freedom of Association) \n65.

The Ohio State Highway Patrol maintains or constitutes a program or \nactivity that receives federal financial assistance from the United States Department of \nJustice.  Thus, it is subject to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 2000d m~. and 28 \nCFR § 42.101 m~. Plaintiffs are intended beneficiaries of such program or activity. \n72.  The selection of persons to be stopped, detained and searched on the \nbasis of race and/or national origin, with or without legally sufficient cause or \njustification constitutes intentional discrimination and has a discriminatory effect and a \ndisproportionate impact on Hispanics and other persons of color. \n73.  The violation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000d and 28 CFR § 42.101 SU.s1aQ. as \nalleged above, has caused, and will cause unless the practice is enjoined by this Court, \ntremendous harm and public humiliation to Hispanics and other individuals of color who \nare stopped, detained or searched pursuant to the above practices. \n74.  The defendants' actions in maintaining the practices and in stopping, \ndetaining and searching plaintiffs pursuant to the practices have been motivated by \n21 \n\ndiscriminatory animus, have a discriminatory effect, have a disproportionate impact on \nHispanics and other persons of color and constitute a violation of Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C. § 2000d .e.1~. and its implementing regulations at 28 \nCFR § 42.101 e1~. \nCOUNT III \n(Supplemental State Claims) \n75.  All defendants in this Count are sued in their individual capacities only. \n76.  Defendants have acted recklessly, oppressively and willfully, with a design \nto oppress and injure plaintiffs. \n(State Constitution - Unlawful Seizure) \n77.

I, Sec. 14 of the Ohio Constitution. \n(State Constitution - Unlawful Search) \n78.  The actions of defendants in maintaining the practices and in stopping, \ndetaining and also often searching plaintiffs, their vehicles and their possessions \npursuant to the practices have been motivated by discriminatory animus and constitute \ndenial of equal protection of the laws based on plaintiffs' national origin or race in \nviolation of the Ohio Constitution. \n22 \n\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs request: \nA.

For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM the denial of qualified immunity\nas to the plaintiffs' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims. Furthermore, we AFFIRM the district court's grant\nof partial summary judgment to plaintiffs on the issue of Fourth Amendment liability and REMAND for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Factual Background\nPlaintiffs Jose Aguilar and Irma Esparza (\"plaintiffs\") are lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens. On Sunday,\n529 *529 March 26, 1995, Aguilar and Esparza were driving from their home in Chicago, Illinois, to Toledo, Ohio, to\nvisit family members. During this trip, an Ohio State Highway Patrol (\"OSHP\") trooper, Kevin Kiefer, stopped\nAguilar and Esparza for driving with a faulty headlight. After the plaintiffs pulled over, Trooper Kiefer approached\nthe plaintiffs' car and asked to see Aguilar's driver's license. Aguilar provided Trooper Kiefer with a valid Illinois\ndriver's license. Trooper Kiefer then ordered Aguilar out of the car and placed him in the back of his cruiser.\nAlmost immediately thereafter, a second OSHP cruiser arrived. A trooper from the second cruiser walked a drug-\nsniffing dog around the outside of the plaintiffs' vehicle. The dog \"alerted,\" indicating that the vehicle contained\n[2]\nnarcotics.\nThe second trooper then asked Esparza for identification. She offered the trooper an Illinois identification card,\nbut the trooper reportedly grabbed her wallet and removed her green card. The trooper then instructed Esparza\nto step out of the vehicle. She was locked in the back of Trooper Kiefer's cruiser next to Aguilar. Trooper Kiefer\n\nthen demanded to see Aguilar's green card. The green cards of both Aguilar and Esparza were valid and in force\nat the time of this encounter.\nAfter examining the green cards, the troopers asked Aguilar and Esparza where they had obtained their green\ncards and whether they had paid for them. The troopers were attempting to inquire whether the documents were\nforged, since green cards are not offered for sale. Aguilar and Esparza speak limited English, however, and\nbelieved that the troopers were asking whether they had paid the required processing fees. They responded that\nthey had paid for the cards, meaning that they had paid all required fees. Trooper Kiefer interpreted the plaintiffs'\nresponse as an indication that the cards were likely forged, and retained the green cards for authentication.\nTrooper Kiefer was unable to contact the INS to verify the authenticity of plaintiffs' green cards at the time of the\nencounter, because it was a Sunday, so he took the green cards and let the plaintiffs go. Trooper Kiefer \"did not\nissue the plaintiffs a receipt for their green cards, tell them when they could expect them back if the cards were\nindeed authentic, or tell them where or how to inquire if they had any questions about the seizure.\" Farm Labor\nOrg. Comm. v. Ohio State Highway Patrol, 95 F.Supp.2d 723, 728 (N.D.Ohio 2000).\nThe next day (Monday), the plaintiffs retained an attorney. That day, paralegal Arturo Ortiz contacted the OSHP\non behalf of Aguilar and Esparza, but was unable to obtain assistance because he lacked information regarding\nthe incident. On Thursday, Ortiz again contacted OSHP and spoke to Trooper Kiefer. Kiefer returned the green\ncards personally that same day, four days after the initial seizure. When asked in his deposition why it took so\nlong to verify the green cards, Trooper Kiefer explained that he had taken a few days off from work and was\nunable to reach the INS during that time.\nThe plaintiffs contend that Trooper Kiefer's actions were, in part, the product of a pattern and practice by the\nOSHP of questioning motorists about their immigration status on the basis of their Hispanic appearance. From\n530 the record, it appears that the OSHP 00 particularly its Traffic *530 and Drug Interdiction Team (TDIT) 00 began\n97 97\ntaking a more active role in immigration enforcement in 1995. Pursuant to this role, OSHP troopers have been\nknown to inquire into motorists' immigration status during routine traffic stops. When these inquiries lead an\nOSHP trooper to conclude that an individual may be an illegal immigrant, the trooper will contact the Border\nPatrol and detain the suspect until the Border Patrol arrives. Pursuant to this practice, \"the OSHP has detained\nhundreds of motorists who were suspected to be illegally in the United States following routine traffic stops; such\ndetention, in all likelihood, was precipitated by answers given to questions regarding the motorists' immigration\nstatus.\" Farm Labor Org. Comm., 95 F.Supp.2d at 735. Although the OSHP maintains that it does not do so\nfrequently, troopers sometimes seize alien registration cards of suspected illegal immigrants and deliver them to\nfederal authorities.\nB. Procedural History\nThis case was brought as a class action lawsuit. The plaintiff class (the \"class\") is composed of migrant workers\nwho claim that the OSHP has violated their constitutional rights by interrogating them about their immigration\nstatus, and, in some cases, confiscating immigration documents, on the basis of their Hispanic appearance. The\nclass's initial motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin this practice was denied without prejudice, because\nnone of the named plaintiffs had ever been stopped, and the class therefore lacked standing. Farm Labor Org.\nComm. v. Ohio State Highway Patrol, 991 F.Supp. 895, 899 (N.D.Ohio 1997). The class subsequently amended\nits complaint to add plaintiffs Jose Aguilar and Irma Esparza, who were stopped by the OSHP. The district court\nthen granted in part the class's request for a preliminary injunction, ordering the OSHP to (1) refrain from\nquestioning motorists about their immigration status absent consent or reasonable suspicion based upon\narticulable objective facts, (2) refrain from seizing immigration documents without \"lawful cause for doing so,\" and\n(3) provide effective substitutes for any immigration documents seized. Id. at 907.\nOn August 17, 1998, the district court certified the class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). Farm\nLabor Org. Comm. v. Ohio State Highway Patrol, 184 F.R.D. 583 (N.D.Ohio 1998). On September 8, 1999, the\ndistrict court issued an order granting summary judgment to all defendants, except Trooper Kevin Kiefer, on the\nclass's Fourth Amendment claims. The court granted the motion of plaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza for summary\njudgment against Trooper Kiefer based upon the claim that Trooper Kiefer had unreasonably detained their green\n\ncards for four days after the March 26, 1995, stop. The court found that questioning regarding immigration status,\nhowever, did not offend the Fourth Amendment, so long as it took place pursuant to lawful traffic stops and the\nduration of these stops was not extended beyond the time required to complete the legitimate purposes of a\ntraffic stop. The court found that the questioning of Aguilar and Esparza took place after the police had probable\ncause to perform a search for narcotics, based upon the alert of the drug detection dog. Consequently, the\nquestioning of Aguilar and Esparza regarding their immigration status did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The\ndistrict court also dissolved the preliminary injunction it issued on December 8, 1997.\nThe class subsequently moved for reconsideration of the September 8th order. The class asserted that the\n531 September 8th order failed to address a number of matters, *531 including its motion for injunctive relief under\nTitle VI, the status of class-wide claims for injunctive relief under the Fourth Amendment, and claims for relief\nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nOn April 20, 2000, the district court granted the motion for reconsideration in part and denied it in part. Farm\nLabor Org. Comm., 95 F.Supp.2d 723. The court found that the class lacked standing for class-wide injunctive\nrelief, because the named plaintiffs had been stopped only once and the court did not find a sufficient likelihood\nthat they would be subjected to similar practices again in the future. Id. at 730-33 (citing City of Los Angeles v.\nLyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983)). The court found that plaintiffs Aguilar and Esparza\ndid have standing to sue for damages on an equal protection theory, however. Id. at 730. The district court then\ndenied Trooper Kiefer's motion for summary judgment based upon qualified immunity, and granted Aguilar's and\nEsparza's motions for summary judgment against Trooper Kiefer on their equal protection claims. The court found\nthat Aguilar and Esparza had presented sufficient evidence to make a prima facie case that Trooper Kiefer\ntargeted them for investigation regarding their immigration status solely on the basis of their being Hispanic. Id. at\n737. The court further concluded that Trooper Kiefer had failed to offer any legitimate race-neutral explanation for\nthe investigation. Id. at 738. The court also denied summary judgment based upon qualified immunity to certain\nof Trooper Kiefer's superior officers in connection with Aguilar's and Esparza's claims against them in their\nindividual capacities for deliberate indifference to Aguilar's and Esparza's constitutional rights. Id. at 741. Finally,\nthe district court granted summary judgment to all defendants in connection with the class's Title VI claims,\nbecause the class failed to demonstrate a sufficient nexus between federal funds provided to the OSHP and the\nchallenged activity. Id. at 743.\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. Jurisdiction\nIn Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985), the Supreme Court held that\ndenials of summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, to the extent that such orders turn on issues of\nlaw, are immediately appealable under the \"collateral order\" doctrine articulated in Cohen v. Beneficial Indus.\nLoan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Pursuant to this doctrine, federal appellate\ncourts have jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals concerning \"the legal question of qualified immunity, i.e.,\nwhether a given set of facts violates clearly established law.\" Mattox v. City of Forest Park, 183 F.3d 515, 519 (6th\nCir.1999). Conversely, denials of qualified immunity may not be reviewed on interlocutory appeal insofar as \"a\ndefendant simply wants to appeal a district court's determination that the evidence is sufficient to permit a\nparticular finding of fact after trial.\" Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 314, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995)\n. For the purposes of this appeal, therefore, we assume the plaintiffs' version of the facts is true, and ask whether,\ngiven such facts, the plaintiffs have demonstrated that Trooper Kiefer violated their clearly established rights\n[3]\nunder the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n532  B. Standard of Review\n*532\nWe review de novo a district court's denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds, because the\ndetermination of whether qualified immunity is applicable to an official's actions is a question of law. Dickerson v.\n\nMcClellan, 101 F.3d 1151, 1157 (6th Cir.1996). Summary judgment is proper only when there is no dispute as to\na material question of fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).\nAccording to the doctrine of qualified immunity, \"government officials performing discretionary functions generally\nare shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory\nor constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,\n818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Qualified immunity involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court\nconsiders whether \"[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, ... the facts alleged show\n[that] the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right.\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156,\n150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). If the court finds a constitutional violation has been demonstrated, it must then consider\nwhether the violation involved \"`clearly established constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.'\" Dickerson, 101 F.3d at 1158 (quoting Christophel v. Kukulinsky, 61 F.3d 479, 484 (6th Cir.1995)); see\nalso Saucier, 121 S.Ct. at 2156. For a right to be clearly established, \"`[t]he contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.'\" Russo v.\nCity of Cincinnati, 953 F.2d 1036, 1042 (6th Cir.1992) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639, 107\nS.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)). \"Although it need not be the case that `the very action in question has been\npreviously held unlawful, ... in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.'\" Id. (quoting \nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034). As the Supreme Court has recently explained, \"officials can still be\non notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.\" Hope v. Pelzer, ___\nU.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2516, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002). \"Although earlier cases involving `fundamentally similar'\nfacts can provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established, they are not\nnecessary to such a finding.\" Id.\nC. Equal Protection\nPlaintiffs allege that Trooper Kiefer violated their rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\n533 Amendment *533 by targeting them for investigation concerning immigration status and seizing their green cards\nbecause of their Hispanic appearance. The district court found that the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to\nshow that they were targeted for questioning about their immigration status solely because of their Hispanic\nappearance, and that the OSHP and Trooper Kiefer had failed to articulate a race-neutral reason for questioning\nthe plaintiffs. The court therefore denied Trooper Kiefer's motion for summary judgment based upon his defense\nof qualified immunity and granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the issue of liability. Trooper Kiefer\ncontends that he is entitled to qualified immunity because the undisputed facts show that his inquiries into the\nplaintiffs' immigration status were motivated by the plaintiffs' difficulties speaking and understanding English,\nwhich he contends is a legitimate race-neutral reason for the investigative steps taken.\n1. Constitutional Violation\nIn assessing Trooper Kiefer's claim of qualified immunity, we first determine whether the facts, viewed in the light\nmost favorable to the plaintiffs, show a violation of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Dickerson, 101 F.3d at 1158.\nThe plaintiffs allege that Trooper Kiefer singled them out for inquiry into their immigration status on the basis of\ntheir Hispanic appearance during the course of a lawful traffic stop. The plaintiffs do not challenge the validity of\ntheir initial stop for a faulty headlight. Nor do they assert that the questioning exceeded the permissible scope of\nthe stop under the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless, as this court has recognized, \"[t]he Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment provides citizens a degree of protection independent of the Fourth Amendment\nprotection against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" United States v. Avery, 137 F.3d 343, 352 (6th Cir.1997)\n. Similarly, the Supreme Court, in Whren v. United States, confirmed that an officer's discriminatory motivations\nfor pursuing a course of action can give rise to an Equal Protection claim, even where there are sufficient\nobjective indicia of suspicion to justify the officer's actions under the Fourth Amendment:\nWe of course agree with petitioners that the Constitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law\nbased on considerations such as race. But the constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally\n\ndiscriminatory application of laws is the Equal Protection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment.\nSubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.\n517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Therefore, if the plaintiffs can show that they were\nsubjected to unequal treatment based upon their race or ethnicity during the course of an otherwise lawful traffic\nstop, that would be sufficient to demonstrate a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Cf. United States v.\nMontero-Camargo, 208 F.3d 1122, 1135 (9th Cir.) (en banc) (holding that equal protection principles precluded\nuse of Hispanic appearance as a relevant factor for Fourth Amendment individualized suspicion requirement), \ncert. denied,531 U.S. 889, 121 S.Ct. 211, 148 L.Ed.2d 148 (2000).\nThe Supreme Court has explained that a claimant alleging selective enforcement of facially neutral criminal laws\nmust demonstrate that the challenged law enforcement practice \"had a discriminatory effect and that it was\n534 motivated by *534 a discriminatory purpose.\"[4]Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 608, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84\nL.Ed.2d 547 (1985). \"To establish discriminatory effect in a race case, the claimant must show that similarly\nsituated individuals of a different race were not prosecuted.\" United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 465, 116\nS.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996). A claimant can demonstrate discriminatory effect by naming a similarly\nsituated individual who was not investigated or through the use of statistical or other evidence which \"address[es]\nthe crucial question of whether one class is being treated differently from another class that is otherwise similarly\nsituated.\" Chavez v. Ill. State Police, 251 F.3d 612, 638 (7th Cir.2001). Discriminatory purpose can be shown by\ndemonstrating that the \"`decisionmaker ... selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part\n`because of,' not merely `in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.'\" Wayte, 470 U.S. at 610, 105\nS.Ct. 1524 (quoting Personnel Adm'r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870\n(1979)). Determining whether official action was motivated by intentional discrimination \"demands a sensitive\ninquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.\" Village of Arlington Heights v.\nMetro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977). \"[A]n invidious discriminatory\npurpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the fact, if it is true, that the\n[practice] bears more heavily on one race than another.\" Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2040,\n48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976).\nThis framework has been applied in a number of cases in this and other circuits involving allegations of\ndiscriminatory police enforcement practices. See, e.g, United States v. Bullock, 94 F.3d 896, 899 (4th Cir.1996)\n(applying selective enforcement test to criminal defendant's claim that officer tended to escalate traffic stops of\nyoung black males into drug investigations); United States v. Bell, 86 F.3d 820, 823 (8th Cir.) (holding that\ndefendant was required to demonstrate discriminatory effect to sustain defense based upon theory that police\nenforced bicycle headlight law only against black offenders), cert. denied,519 U.S. 955, 117 S.Ct. 372, 136\nL.Ed.2d 262 (1996); United States v. Anderson, 923 F.2d 450, 453-54 (6th Cir.) (applying selective prosecution\n535 framework to defendant's claim that he was singled out by the police *535 for a background check for prior\nfelonies following his arrest), cert. denied,499 U.S. 980, 111 S.Ct. 1633, 113 L.Ed.2d 729, and 500 U.S. 936,\n111 S.Ct. 2062, 114 L.Ed.2d 467 (1991). Many of these cases involved § 1983 equal protection claims similar to\nthose presented by the plaintiffs in the instant case. See Chavez, 251 F.3d at 635-36 (applying discriminatory\npurpose/discriminatory effect test in class action suit alleging that state police used racial classifications in\ndeciding whom to stop, detain, and search in enforcing traffic laws); Gardenhire v. Schubert, 205 F.3d 303, 318\n(6th Cir.2000) (applying selective prosecution test to § 1983 claim alleging that police made racially motivated\ndecision to pursue theft investigation against interracial couple); Stemler v. City of Florence, 126 F.3d 856, 873\n(6th Cir.1997) (applying selective prosecution test to § 1983 claim alleging that police arrested plaintiff because\nthey believed she was a lesbian), cert. denied,523 U.S. 1118, 118 S.Ct. 1796, 140 L.Ed.2d 936 (1998).\nIn its April 20, 2000, order, the district court determined that the plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence to\nprove the requisite facts for a prima facie case of intentional discrimination under the selective prosecution\nframework. J.A. at 239 (\"I find that plaintiffs have satisfied their prima facie burden....\"). After reviewing the\nrecord, the district court initially determined that plaintiffs had advanced sufficient evidence to support a factual\nfinding that \"`the decision makers in [their] case acted with discriminatory purpose.'\" J.A. at 238 (quoting \nMcCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 292, 107 S.Ct. 1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987)). The court noted that the record\ncontained a range of circumstantial evidence supporting such a finding of intent. Perhaps most significantly, the\ncourt cited the deposition testimony of Kiefer and other OSHP officials:\n\nTrooper Kiefer ... testified that when he found Hispanic passengers hiding under a blanket, he\ncalled the Border Patrol, but that if he found white people hiding under a blanket, he would not.\nSgt. Elling likewise testified that he would not call the Border Patrol regarding a motorist [ ]unless\n[\"][he] would think that they would probably be Hispanic in nature.\" And Trooper Pahl admitted that\nshe once had contacted the Border Patrol after coming across two Hispanic men whose car had\nbroken down, but that she wouldn't do the same for a white man.\nJ.A. at 242 (citations omitted). The court also cited additional circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent. The\ncourt noted that over ninety percent of OSHP's immigration inquiries concerned Hispanic motorists. The court\nalso appears to have credited plaintiffs' argument that \"[g]iven defendants' admitted lack of training in the\nidentification of illegal immigrants, the only reasoned basis on which to question a motorist about immigration\nstatus ... is the motorist's Hispanic appearance coupled with indicators of Hispanic ethnicity.\" J.A. at 240-41. The\ndistrict court also observed that \"TDIT provides officers with a list of immigration related questions along with their\nSpanish translations, but there is no evidence that such translations are provided in any other languages.\" J.A. at\n241. Finally, the court discussed a videotape of a traffic stop in which Trooper Kiefer pulled over a car containing\nthree Hispanic individuals for \"driving slightly above the speed limit.\" J.A. at 242. During the stop, Kiefer\nquestioned the driver and two passengers about their immigration status even after the individuals presented\nvalid state identification cards and after Kiefer had decided not to issue a speeding citation. The court appears to\n536 have accepted plaintiffs' characterization of the tape as supporting an *536 inference that the individuals in the\nvehicle \"were questioned about their immigration status solely on the basis of their Hispanic appearance,\nbecause nothing about their conduct suggested that they were in the country illegally; indeed, Trooper Kiefer had\nbeen prepared to release [the driver] so long as [his] license cleared.\" J.A. at 243.\nAs to the discriminatory effect prong, the district court observed that \"[t]he burden rests on plaintiffs to show, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that they were treated differently than similarly situated non-minorities.\" J.A. at\n238. The court considered, and rejected, defendants' argument that \"no evidence presented thus far indicates\nthat Hispanic motorists are treated differently than non-Hispanic motorists.\" J.A. at 243. The court concluded that\nplaintiffs' evidence was sufficient to permit a finding that similarly situated non-Hispanic motorists were treated\ndifferently, observing that\nPlaintiffs have introduced direct evidence that Hispanic motorists are treated differently than white\nmotorists. Trooper Kiefer, Sgt. Elling, and Trooper Pahl all testified that, in their experience, they\nwould refer Hispanic motorists to the Border Patrol when, in precisely the same circumstances,\nthey would not refer someone who was white (i.e., not of Hispanic appearance).\nJ.A. at 243-44. The district court noted that this finding was supported by additional \"inferential evidence of a\ndiscriminatory practice,\" including the fact that \"most motorists ... [who were] asked about their green cards were\nHispanic-looking\" and defendants' misinformation and lack of training concerning what facts give rise to\nreasonable suspicion of immigration violations. J.A. at 244.\nBecause this is an interlocutory appeal, we do not consider whether the plaintiffs' evidence is sufficient to present\na genuine issue for trial as to the underlying factual elements of their selective enforcement claim 00 i.e., whether\n97\nplaintiffs' evidence could support a finding that Trooper Kiefer actually did target the plaintiffs in part because of\ntheir Hispanic appearance or that the OSHP does not investigate non-Hispanic motorists who are similarly\n[5]\nsituated to the plaintiffs.  Under Johnson, 515 U.S. at 317, 115 S.Ct. 2151, we lack jurisdiction on interlocutory\nappeal of a denial of qualified immunity to review the district court's determination that plaintiffs have presented\n537 sufficient evidence to prove the underlying or basic *537 facts alleged in support of their constitutional claim. \nWilliams v. Mehra, 186 F.3d 685, 690 (6th Cir.1999) (en banc) (observing that appellate court lacked jurisdiction\nto consider factual questions relating to defendants' knowledge and conduct). Questions of evidentiary sufficiency\nare not separate and distinct from the merits of plaintiffs claims, and review of such questions on interlocutory\nappeal \"can consume inordinate amounts of appellate time\" by requiring the appeals court to comb a voluminous\npretrial record to assess plaintiffs' evidence. Johnson, 515 U.S. at 316, 115 S.Ct. 2151. This limitation on our\nappellate jurisdiction applies with particular force to evidence sufficiency questions relating to a defendant's\nintent, such as whether a defendant acted with a discriminatory purpose. See id.; McCloud v. Testa, 97 F.3d\n\n1536, 1544-45 (6th Cir.1997) (\"[T]he example that the Johnson Court chose to illustrate what kinds of cases it\nwanted to prevent the courts of appeals from exercising jurisdiction over focused on intent....\"). \"[T]o determine\nwhether there is or is not a triable issue of fact about such a matter [as the defendant's intent] may require\nreading a vast pretrial record, with numerous conflicting affidavits, depositions, and other discovery materials.\nThis fact means, compared with Mitchell, greater delay.\" Johnson, 515 U.S. at 316, 115 S.Ct. 2151. Thus, our\nreview in the instant case is confined to the question of whether \"all of the conduct which the District Court\ndeemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment met the Harlow standard of `objective legal\nreasonableness.'\" Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 313, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). The district\ncourt concluded that the plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could find that the\ndefendants, including defendant Kiefer, acted with a discriminatory purpose and did not initiate immigration\ninvestigations of non-Hispanic motorists who were otherwise similarly situated to the plaintiffs. We therefore\nassume, without deciding, for the purposes of this appeal that the plaintiffs can prove these underlying factual\nclaims. Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319, 115 S.Ct. 2151 (\"[T]he court of appeals can simply take, as given, the facts\nthat the district court assumed when it denied summary judgment....\").\nPerhaps realizing this limitation on the range of issues appealable on interlocutory appeal, defendant Kiefer does\nnot dispute that the plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing of discriminatory effect and discriminatory\npurpose. Instead, Kiefer properly limits his appeal to \"neat abstract issues of law\" relating to qualified immunity 00\n97\ni.e., whether the facts alleged by the plaintiffs demonstrate a violation of clearly established law. Id. at 317, 115\nS.Ct. 2151 (quotation omitted). Kiefer first argues that, assuming plaintiffs have shown that he targeted them for\ninvestigation in part because of their Hispanic appearance, the facts alleged by the plaintiffs do not demonstrate\nthat he targeted them solely because of their apparent ethnicity. Kiefer argues that the undisputed facts reveal\nthat he was motivated at least in part by plaintiffs' inability to speak English, which he alleges to be a valid race-\n[6]\nneutral basis for initiating an immigration investigation.\n538 *538 Kiefer relies on our opinion in United States v. Travis, 62 F.3d 170 (6th Cir. 1995),cert. denied,516 U.S.\n1060, 116 S.Ct. 738, 133 L.Ed.2d 688 (1996), for the proposition that a civil-profiling plaintiff must prove that he\nor she was targeted solely because of his or her race. In Travis, this circuit held that \"consensual searches may\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause when they are initiated solely based on racial considerations.\" Id. at 173. The\nlegal standard articulated in Travis does appear to place the burden on the plaintiff to show that no race-neutral\nmotives played a role in the challenged police conduct. Specifically, the Travis court explained that where\n\"officers ... decide to interview a suspect for many reasons, some of which are legitimate and some of which [are]\nbased on race[,] .... the use of race in the pre-contact stage does not give rise to any constitutional protections.\" \nId. at 174.\nNevertheless, we think it would be inappropriate to apply Travis to the factual circumstances presented in the\ninstant case. Travis and its progeny, particularly United States v. Avery, 137 F.3d 343 (6th Cir.1997), addressed\nequal protection challenges to consensual police interviews of airport travelers, which were allegedly initiated\nbased upon racial criteria. This circuit has never used the Travis standard in cases alleging racially discriminatory\nconduct by officers toward an individual who has already been detained, and who is therefore not free to leave\nand terminate the encounter at will. As our earlier discussion of the relevant case law makes clear, this circuit and\nour fellow courts of appeals have consistently applied the selective enforcement framework of Wayte and \nArmstrong in cases involving non-consensual police encounters. We see no reason to depart from this approach\nin the instant case. The selective enforcement framework does not require a plaintiff to show that the defendant\nhad no race-neutral reasons for the challenged enforcement decision. Instead, it is enough to show that the\nchallenged action was taken \"at least in part `because of' ... its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.'\" \nWayte, 470 U.S. at 610, 105 S.Ct. 1524 (quoting Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279, 99 S.Ct. 2282).\nThe \"sole motive\" requirement announced in Travis is an anomaly in equal protection law, and should not be\napplied outside the narrow factual context of purely consensual encounters. The only legal authority cited by the \nTravis court for its \"sole motive\" analysis was the Supreme Court's decision in Mt. Healthy City School District\nBoard of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), a First Amendment retaliation\ncase. However, Mt. Healthy merely announced that the presence of an impermissible motive will not give rise to a\n539 constitutional violation if the state can show that the challenged decision would *539 have been made regardless\nof the improper motive. Id. at 286-87. Mt. Healthy does not limit constitutional liability to instances in which an\n\nimpermissible purpose was the sole motive for an adverse action; it simply requires an inquiry into whether the\nimpermissible motive was a \"but for\" cause of the challenged decision. The same multiple-motive analysis\napplies in the equal protection arena: proof that a decision was \"motivated in part by a racially discriminatory\npurpose .... shift[s] to the [defendant] the burden of establishing that the same decision would have resulted even\nhad the impermissible purpose not been considered.\" Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 270 n. 21, 97 S.Ct. 555; see\nalso Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222, 232, 105 S.Ct. 1916, 85 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985); Howard v. Senkowski, 986\nF.2d 24, 30 (2d Cir.1993) (applying Mt. Healthy/Arlington Heights multiple-motive analysis to claim of race-based\nuse of peremptory strikes). Indeed, the Supreme Court has clearly explained that the Equal Protection Clause\n\"does not require a plaintiff to prove that the challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purposes.\" \nArlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265, 97 S.Ct. 555. Thus, we believe that Travis is in fact inconsistent with the\nSupreme Court's approach in Mt. Healthy and other multiple-motive cases involving equal protection issues. For\nthat reason, we decline to extend the standard articulated in Travis beyond the narrow factual situation addressed\nin that case.\nThus, even if Trooper Kiefer is correct that the record reveals that he possessed some race-neutral basis for\ninitiating the investigation of the plaintiffs, this fact alone would not entitle him to summary judgment on qualified\nimmunity as long as the plaintiffs can demonstrate that he was partly motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Of\ncourse, Trooper Kiefer can still argue, based upon Mt. Healthy and Arlington Heights, that his race-neutral\nreasons would have caused him to investigate the plaintiffs regardless of any discriminatory motive that may\nhave existed. The question of whether Trooper Kiefer's allegedly discriminatory motive played a determinative\nrole in the decision to investigate the plaintiffs, however, is a factual dispute best suited for resolution at trial.\nMoreover, we disagree with Trooper Kiefer's contention that the plaintiffs' difficulty speaking English necessarily\nestablishes a valid race-neutral basis for initiating an immigration investigation. Kiefer relies on United States v.\nOrtiz, 422 U.S. 891, 897, 95 S.Ct. 2585, 45 L.Ed.2d 623 (1975), in which Supreme Court identified one's \"inability\nto speak English\" as one of many factors that may be taken into account in deciding whether there is probable\ncause to search a private vehicle for illegal aliens. According to Kiefer, Ortiz conclusively establishes that officers\nlawfully may select individuals for immigration investigations based upon their inability to speak English.\nWe think Ortiz provides little guidance in the instant case. Ortiz was a Fourth Amendment case involving\nautomobile searches at a Border Patrol checkpoint less than 100 miles from the U.S.-Mexican border. The\nrespondent in Ortiz did not raise a Fourteenth Amendment claim and the Court mentioned the use of one's\nEnglish-speaking ability as a basis for selection only once in a laundry list of factors that might be used in\ndeciding whether there is probable cause to refer an automobile for further inspection. Id. The Ortiz Court\ntherefore had no occasion to consider fully the equal protection implications raised when motorists are targeted\nfor immigration investigations on the basis of their lack of familiarity with the English language. Moreover, the\n540 Supreme Court *540 has cautioned against extending the logic of border enforcement cases to situations remote\nfrom the border, where the government interest in immigration policing may be less compelling. See United\nStates v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 564 n. 17, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976); accord United States\nv. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 881, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975) (noting that in the Fourth\nAmendment context, certain practices may be permitted at the border in part \"because of the importance of the\ngovernmental interest at stake ... and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border\").\nThe Supreme Court did consider the equal protection implications of using language as a basis for selection in \nHernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991). In Hernandez, the Court\ncautioned that when a government official uses as a criterion for decision a person's ability to speak a particular\nlanguage that is closely associated with a specific ethnic group, that fact may \"raise[ ] a plausible, though not a\nnecessary, inference that language might be a pretext for what in fact were race-based\" actions. Id. at 363, 111\nS.Ct. 1859. In Hernandez, a prosecutor struck several Hispanic individuals from a criminal defendant's petit jury.\nAmong the reasons articulated by the prosecutor for the strikes was the fact that the jurors were bilingual in\nEnglish and Spanish and might therefore not accept the interpreter's account of the testimony of some of the\nprosecution's key witnesses, who were Spanish-speaking. The trial court found that the criminal defendant had\nshown a prima facie case of race-based challenges, but concluded that the prosecutor's proffered reasons were\nlegitimate. The Court approved the trial court's conclusion, explaining that the question of whether the\n\nprosecutor's explanation was genuine or mere pretext masking an intent to discriminate was a \"pure issue of fact\"\nthat turned largely upon credibility assessments and demeanor observations. Id. at 364, 111 S.Ct. 1859.\nConsidering Ortiz in light of Hernandez, we think that an officer's reliance upon a suspect's inability to speak\nEnglish may be a proper race-neutral factor, but that fact questions as to pretext are necessarily present where\nan officer acts based upon the fact that a suspect speaks Spanish due to the close connection between the\nSpanish language and a specific ethnic community, such as the large migrant labor community in Northwest\nOhio. In light of this principle, it may be that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Trooper Kiefer's\nreliance on plaintiffs' inability to speak English was a legitimate race-neutral reason or a mere pretext for\ndiscrimination. The district court concluded that plaintiffs' evidence permitted the inference that OSHP officers\nfocus on motorists' English-speaking ability largely because it is an \"indicator[ ] of Hispanic ethnicity.\" J.A. at 241.\nThe district court particularly emphasized the fact that \"the TDIT provides officers with a list of immigration related\nquestions in English along with their Spanish translations, but there is no evidence that such translations are\nprovided in any other languages.\" J.A. at 241. In contrast, OSHP officers dispute that they question only Spanish-\nspeaking motorists. See Elling Dep. at 35 (noting that OSHP has questioned Polish persons who spoke \"broken\nEnglish\"). This appears to be a factual dispute best suited to resolution at trial, and therefore it is not a proper\nbasis for granting summary judgment to the defendant on qualified immunity.\n2. Whether the Relevant Law Was Clearly Established\n541 Trooper Kiefer contends that, even if his actions did constitute a violation *541 of the plaintiffs' constitutional\nrights, these rights were not clearly established at the time of the challenged encounter. In particular, the\ndefendant argues that this circuit did not recognize the existence of the rights asserted by the plaintiffs until our\ndecision in Travis, 62 F.3d 170, which was handed down in August of 1995, more than four months after the\n[7]\nevents in question.  As noted in the foregoing section, Travis held that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits a\npolice officer from selecting an airport traveler for a consensual interview solely on the basis of the traveler's race.\nId. at 174. The defendant points to our observation in Travis that we had addressed the issue of whether racially\nmotivated consensual encounters could give rise to an equal protection claim \"only once before in an\nunpublished opinion.\" Id. at 173 (citing United States v. Jennings, 1993 WL 5927 (6th Cir. Jan. 13, 1993)). Since\nthe first published opinion on the issue was handed down after the events in question, the defendant argues, a\nreasonable officer would not have known that Trooper Kiefer's actions violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\nWe disagree with the defendant's characterization of the state of the law in 1995. While Travis may have been\nthe first case to reach the merits of such an equal protection claim, we expressly acknowledged in a 1992 en\nbanc case, United States v. Taylor, that an equal protection claim could be based upon evidence that law\nenforcement officers targeted minorities for consensual interviews on the basis of race. 956 F.2d 572, 578-79 (6th\nCir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 952, 113 S.Ct. 404, 121 L.Ed.2d 330 (1992). The Taylor court explained:\nA review of ... the briefs and arguments of counsel before the trial court and initially before this\ncourt[ ] disclosed no charge that the appellant ... had been selected for a consensual interview\n542 because he was an African American, that the law enforcement officers at the *542 Memphis\nAirport implemented a general practice or pattern that primarily targeted minorities for consensual\ninterviews, or that they had incorporated a racial component into the drug courier profile. A\nfactually supported record of such charged official conduct in the instant case would have given\nrise to due process and equal protection constitutional implications cognizable by this court.\nId. (emphasis added). We think this statement demonstrates that, at least by 1992, it was clearly established that\nthe Constitution prohibited racial targeting in law enforcement investigations, regardless of whether an encounter\nwas lawful under the Fourth Amendment.\nMoreover, even before Taylor, we had applied the selective enforcement framework to a criminal defendant's\nclaim that he was improperly selected for a prior-felonies-background check after his arrest. Anderson, 923 F.2d\nat 453. The claim advanced in Anderson closely resembles the plaintiffs' claim in the instant case insofar as both\nclaims involve allegedly discriminatory police motives for pursuing a particular course of investigation of a\n\nsuspect who is already in police detention. Although we did not find a selective enforcement violation in \nAnderson, our discussion in that case left little doubt that we would have permitted the claim had the defendant\nbeen able to satisfy his burden under the Supreme Court's selective enforcement test. Id. (citing Wayte, 470 U.S.\nat 608 n. 10, 609, 105 S.Ct. 1524). We think Anderson demonstrates that any ambiguity in the law of selective\nenforcement before Travis was confined to the limited factual context of consensual police encounters. Since we\nhave already determined that the consensual airport encounter cases are inapposite to the instant case, we\nconclude that any ambiguity in the law relating to consensual encounters before the Travis opinion does not\njustify granting qualified immunity to Trooper Kiefer.\nFurthermore, as we have already observed, for a right to be clearly established, \"it need not be the case that `the\nvery action in question has been previously held unlawful.'\" Russo, 953 F.2d at 1042 (quoting Anderson, 483 U.S.\nat 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034). Rather, the pre-existing law must be such that existence of the right is apparent. See id.\nIn this vein, we have recognized that \"[i]t is a venerable rule under the Equal Protection Clause that the state may\nnot choose to enforce even facially neutral laws differently against different portions of the citizenry solely out of\nan arbitrary desire to discriminate against one group.\" Stemler, 126 F.3d at 874; see also Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118\nU.S. 356, 373, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886) (\"Though the law itself be fair on its face, and impartial in\nappearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as\npractically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their\nrights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the constitution.\"). This principle has long been\nheld to condemn selective prosecution of suspected offenders based upon their membership in a particular\ngroup. See generally Wayte, 470 U.S. 598, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547. We conclude, therefore, that a\nreasonable officer at the time of the events in question would have known that the Constitution forbade\nembarking on an investigation of someone for a particular offense on the basis of that person's race.\nIn conclusion, we determine that the facts alleged by the plaintiffs would, if proved, establish that Kiefer violated\n543 their rights under the Equal Protection Clause by targeting them for immigration-related *543 questioning on the\nbasis of their race. Moreover, we think that the relevant legal principles controlling this case were clearly\nestablished at the time of the defendant's actions. We therefore conclude that the district court correctly denied\nTrooper Kiefer's motion for summary judgment on his defense of qualified immunity with respect to the plaintiffs'\nequal protection claims.\nD. Detention of the Plaintiffs' Green Cards\nTrooper Kiefer next appeals the district court's denial of his motion for summary judgment based on his qualified\nimmunity defense to the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim, which alleged that Kiefer's four-day detention of the\nplaintiffs' green cards was unreasonable. The court found that Trooper Kiefer's initial seizure of the plaintiffs'\ngreen cards was lawful, because the plaintiffs' confusing answers to Trooper Kiefer's questions about whether\nthey had \"paid for\" the green cards gave rise to reasonable suspicion 00 but not probable cause to believe 00 that\n97 97\nthe cards had been forged. The court concluded, however, that Trooper Kiefer's failure to return the green cards\nchanged the nature of the seizure from a brief investigative detention that could be based upon mere reasonable\nsuspicion to a full seizure that could be justified only by probable cause. Because Trooper Kiefer did not have\nprobable cause for such a seizure, the court concluded that his actions were unreasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment. The district court further determined that no material facts were in dispute regarding this claim, and\nconsequently granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs. On appeal, Trooper Kiefer requests that we reverse the\ndistrict court's denial of qualified immunity, or \"[i]n the alternative, ... dismiss Plaintiff's claims on the merits.\"\nAppellant's Br. at 19.\n1. The Constitutional Violation\nThe Fourth Amendment protects the \"right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" The text of the Fourth Amendment therefore extends\nprotection against unreasonable seizures of personal property, i.e., \"papers[ ] and effects,\" as well as seizures of\nthe person. United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 700-01, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983); United States\n\nv. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 120-21, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984) (concluding that detention of package\nsent through private carrier was \"seizure\" subject to Fourth Amendment reasonableness requirement). In general,\nlike seizures of the person, seizures of personal property require probable cause. As the Supreme Court has\nexplained:\nIn the ordinary case, the Court has viewed a seizure of personal property as per se unreasonable\nwithin the meaning of the Fourth Amendment unless it is accomplished pursuant to a judicial\nwarrant issued upon probable cause and particularly describing the items to be seized. Where law\nenforcement authorities have probable cause to believe that a container holds contraband or\nevidence of a crime, but have not secured a warrant, the Court has interpreted the Amendment to\npermit seizure of the property, pending issuance of a warrant to examine its contents, if the\nexigencies of the circumstances demand it or some other recognized exception to the warrant\nrequirement is present.\nPlace, 462 U.S. at 701, 103 S.Ct. 2637 (citations omitted). As is the case with brief investigative detentions of the\nperson, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), however, the Supreme Court has\n544 recognized that some *544 brief detentions of personal effects may be permitted based upon reasonable\nsuspicion falling short of probable cause, provided that such detentions are \"minimally intrusive.\" Place, 462 U.S.\nat 706, 103 S.Ct. 2637 (\"[S]ome brief detentions of personal effects may be so minimally intrusive of Fourth\nAmendment interests that strong countervailing governmental interests will justify a seizure based only on\nspecific articulable facts that the property contains contraband or evidence of a crime.\"); see also United States v.\nSaperstein, 723 F.2d 1221, 1231 (6th Cir.1983) (explaining that \"seizures of personal effects when based on\nanything less than probable cause\" are permitted only to the extent that they satisfy the standards for\nreasonableness applicable to \"Terry-type investigative detention[s]\"); United States v. Sanders, 719 F.2d 882, 886\n(6th Cir.1983). In his brief on appeal, Trooper Kiefer does not challenge the district court's ruling that he did not\n[8]\npossess probable cause to seize the plaintiffs' green cards.  The relevant question, therefore, is whether the\nseizure of the plaintiffs' green cards satisfied the standards for Fourth Amendment reasonableness applicable to\nseizures of personal property based upon less than probable cause.\nDetermining whether a seizure of personal property based upon less than probable cause is reasonable for the\npurposes of the Fourth Amendment involves a two-step inquiry. \"First, the Court must determine whether the\ndetaining officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the property he wishes to seize is connected\nwith criminal activity.\" Sanders, 719 F.2d at 887. Second, the scope of the seizure must be reasonable, both in\nduration and in intrusiveness. Place, 462 U.S. at 709, 103 S.Ct. 2637; Sanders, 719 F.2d at 887 (\"If there is\nreasonable suspicion, the Court must then ascertain whether the detention is reasonable, that is, (1) was it\nsufficiently limited in time, and (2) were the investigative means used `the least intrusive means reasonably\navailable.'\" (quotation omitted)). \"Although an officer may have reasonable suspicion to detain a person or his\npossessions for investigation, the officer's investigative detention can mature into an arrest or seizure if it occurs\nover an unreasonable period of time or under unreasonable circumstances.\" Avery, 137 F.3d at 349. In the instant\ncase, the plaintiffs concede that Trooper Kiefer had reasonable suspicion to believe that their green cards were\n545 forged. They contend, however, that the seizure of their green cards exceeded the *545 legitimate scope of a\nseizure of property based upon less than probable cause, because Trooper Kiefer detained the cards for four\ndays before they were returned. We agree.\nThe Supreme Court has previously emphasized that \"the brevity of the invasion of the individual's Fourth\nAmendment interests is an important factor in determining whether [a] seizure [of personal property] is so\nminimally intrusive as to be justifiable on reasonable suspicion.\" Place, 462 U.S. at 709, 103 S.Ct. 2637. In Place,\nDEA agents seized a traveler's suitcase in an airport based upon facts giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that\nthe suitcase contained narcotics. When the traveler refused to consent to a search of his luggage, the agents\ndecided to hold the luggage while they awaited the arrival of a drug-sniffing dog. The agents allowed the traveler\nto leave. After the agents had held the luggage for ninety minutes, the dog arrived and \"alerted\" that the luggage\ncontained narcotics, thereby supplying probable cause for a search. See id. at 699-700, 103 S.Ct. 2637. The\nCourt concluded, however, that the ninety-minute detention of the luggage prior to establishing probable cause\nwas unreasonable. The Court explained that \"[t]he length of the detention of respondent's luggage alone\nprecludes the conclusion that the seizure was reasonable in the absence of probable cause.\" Id. at 709, 103\n\nS.Ct. 2637. In reaching this conclusion, the Court \"reject[ed] the Government's suggestion that the point at which\nprobable cause for seizure of luggage from the person's presence becomes necessary is more distant than in the\ncase of a Terry stop of the person himself.\" Id. at 708, 103 S.Ct. 2637. The Court acknowledged that, in some\ncircumstances, seizures of property may be less intrusive than seizures of persons, but concluded that this is not\nthe case when the police detain luggage in an airport traveler's immediate possession. The Court explained that\n\"such a seizure can effectively restrain the person since he is subjected to the possible disruption of his travel\nplans in order to remain with his luggage or to arrange for its return.\" Id. Therefore, the Court found that the\nagents' seizure of the luggage should be subjected to the same standards of reasonableness that are applied to\ninvestigative detentions of the person. Id. at 709, 103 S.Ct. 2637. Noting that \"we have never approved a seizure\nof the person for the prolonged 90 minute period involved here,\" the Court concluded that it \"[could] not do so on\nthe facts presented by this case.\" Id. at 709-10, 103 S.Ct. 2637.\nRather than adopt a per se time limitation for seizures based upon less than probable cause, however, the\nSupreme Court has consistently \"emphasized the need to consider the law enforcement purposes to be served\nby the stop as well as the time reasonably needed to effectuate those purposes.\" United States v. Sharpe, 470\nU.S. 675, 685, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985); see also Place, 462 U.S. at 709-10, 103 S.Ct. 2637.\n\"Much as a `bright-line rule' would be desirable, in evaluating whether an investigative detention is unreasonable,\ncommon sense and ordinary human experience must govern over rigid criteria.\" Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 685, 105\nS.Ct. 1568; see also Place, 462 U.S. at 709, 103 S.Ct. 2637 (\"[I]n assessing the effect of the length of the\ndetention, we take into account whether the police diligently pursue their investigation.\"). Accordingly, the Place\nCourt relied heavily upon the fact that the agents had advance notice of the defendant's arrival, and thus \"had\nample time to arrange for their additional investigation ... and thereby could have minimized the intrusion on\n546 respondent's Fourth Amendment interests,\" but failed do so. Place, 462 U.S. at 709, 103 *546 S.Ct. 2637. The \nPlace Court further observed that the Fourth Amendment \"violation was exacerbated by the failure of the agents\nto accurately inform respondent of the place to which they were transporting his luggage, of the length of time he\nmight be dispossessed, and of what arrangements would be made for return of the luggage if the investigation\ndispelled the suspicion.\" Id. at 710, 103 S.Ct. 2637.\nTurning to the the instant case, we conclude that the facts presented by the plaintiffs are sufficient to show that\nTrooper Kiefer's four-day detention of the plaintiffs' green cards based upon mere reasonable suspicion was\nunreasonable in duration. Both the Supreme Court and this circuit have found property seizures of much shorter\nduration than the four days presented herein to be unreasonable when based upon less than probable cause. \nSee, e.g., Place, 462 U.S. at 709, 103 S.Ct. 2637 (holding ninety minutes excessive); Saperstein, 723 F.2d at\n1233 (holding 13½ hour seizure of luggage at airport was unreasonable under standards for investigative\ndetentions); Sanders, 719 F.2d at 887 (holding three to four hour detention of luggage unreasonable). As was the\ncase in Place and in the cases from this circuit involving seizures of luggage from travelers, we think that Trooper\nKiefer's seizure interfered with both the plaintiffs' possessory interests in the green cards and their liberty\ninterests in continuing uninterrupted with their travels. The plaintiffs' green cards were seized from them while\nthey were traveling from their home in Chicago to Toledo to visit relatives. Moreover, \"`[g]reen cards' play a\nsignificant role in the daily lives of [lawful permanent resident aliens].\" Etuk v. Slattery, 936 F.2d 1433, 1437 (2nd.\nCir.1991). Failure to carry one's green card on his or her person can subject a legal resident alien to criminal\nsanctions, 8 U.S.C. § 1304(e), and green cards are an essential means by which resident aliens can establish\neligibility for employment and participation in federally funded programs. See Etuk, 936 F.2d at 1437 (discussing\nrelevant statutory provisions). Given the importance of these documents, the challenged seizure undoubtedly\nsubjected the plaintiffs to disruption of their travel plans in order to remain with the documents or arrange for their\nreturn. Accord Place, 462 U.S. at 708, 103 S.Ct. 2637; United States v. Baro, 15 F.3d 563, 567 n. 1 (6th Cir.)\n(holding that seizure of traveler's cash was \"tantamount to a seizure of his person\" where officer presented\ntraveler with \"a Hobson's choice: abandon more than $14,000 to a plain-clothed stranger without obtaining a\nreceipt in return or miss his flight, forfeit his plane ticket, and remain stranded in foreign environs\"), cert. denied,\n513 U.S. 912, 115 S.Ct. 285, 130 L.Ed.2d 201 (1994). Although Aguilar and Esparza were traveling by car, and\ntherefore may have had more flexibility in their itinerary than an air traveler who must catch a plane, we think this\nadded flexibility was not so great as to permit a four-day disruption of their travel plans.\nMoreover, the facts alleged by the plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrate that the length of the detention was\nexcessive in light of \"the law enforcement purposes to be served by the stop as well as the time reasonably\n\nneeded to effectuate those purposes.\" Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 685, 105 S.Ct. 1568. Although we decline to set a\ndefinitive time limit, we agree with the district court that reasonable suspicion would permit Trooper Kiefer to\n[9]\ndetain the green cards no longer than until the following day, when they could be verified by the INS.  Trooper\n547 Kiefer has not articulated *547 any reason why a longer detention would have been necessary. The undisputed\nfacts indicate that the INS could be reached to verify the authenticity of the plaintiffs' green cards on the Monday\nfollowing the initial stop. By waiting for four days to return the plaintiffs' green cards, Trooper Kiefer failed to\n\"diligently pursue [his] investigation.\" Place, 462 U.S. at 709, 103 S.Ct. 2637. The unreasonable nature of the\nseizure was exacerbated by the undisputed fact that Trooper Kiefer \"did not make clear to the plaintiffs how long\n[10]\nthe documents would be held or when or how he would return them to plaintiffs if they proved authentic.\"  J.A.\nat 210 (Sep. 8, 1999, Order at 14); accord Place, 462 U.S. at 710, 103 S.Ct. 2637 (pointing to similar facts in\nfinding detention of luggage unreasonable).\nContrary to Trooper Kiefer's assertion, Fox v. Van Oosterum, 176 F.3d 342 (6th Cir.1999), does not require a\nholding in his favor. In Fox, the plaintiff brought a § 1983 action against county officials, alleging that they acted\nunreasonably in refusing to return his driver's license, which had been seized during a valid inventory search of\nthe plaintiff's truck. Id. at 345. The plaintiff in Fox never challenged the initial seizure of his license. Rather, he\ncontended that an unreasonable seizure occurred when county officials refused his request, four months after the\ninitial seizure, that the license be returned. Id. at 349. We concluded that the challenged action 00 the refusal to\n97\nreturn the license 00 was not a \"seizure\" for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, because the seizure had\n97\nbeen completed long before the date of his request. Id. at 350. The court explained that \"`a seizure of property ...\noccurs when there is some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests in ... property,'\" and\nthat the seizure of the plaintiff's driver's license ended once the act of taking his property was complete. Id. at 350\n(quoting Soldal v. Cook County, Ill., 506 U.S. 56, 61, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992) (additional quotation\nomitted)). Once the county officials had seized and stored the license for a number of months, the plaintiff had\nalready been completely dispossessed of his possessory interests in the license, and the seizure was complete.\nThe defendant's reliance on Fox in the instant case is misplaced. Unlike the plaintiff in Fox, the plaintiffs in the\ninstant case have alleged facts showing that the initial seizure of their green cards was constitutionally defective\nbecause it exceeded the permissible scope of investigative detentions based upon less than probable cause. The\n548 Fox case did not consider the central issue presented in the instant *548 case 00 namely, the permissible scope of\n97\na Terry seizure of an individual's personal effects. As explained above, this is an inherently time-sensitive inquiry.\nIn Fox, the initial seizure resulted from a valid inventory search of the plaintiff's truck, which had been impounded\nafter his arrest; it was not a Terry seizure based upon reasonable suspicion only. Moreover, the plaintiff in Fox\nconceded the constitutionality of the county's detention of his license for the four months that preceded his\nrequest for its return. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Fox court concluded that the county's continued\ndetention of the license beyond that time did not \"change[ ] the character of the [original] seizure from a\nreasonable one to an unreasonable one.\" Id. at 350. In contrast, we have concluded that Trooper Kiefer's four-\nday delay transformed the character of the seizure from a relatively brief investigative detention, which could be\njustified by mere reasonable suspicion, to a full-blown seizure requiring probable cause. The Fox court\ndistinguished Place, which more closely resembles the instant case, on precisely these grounds:\nThe Place Court provided a framework for analyzing when law enforcement agents may hold\nsomeone's property for a very short time on less than probable cause to pursue a limited course\nof investigation. The instant case involves an alleged \"seizure\" that occurred well after the point in\ntime where Place is directly relevant. The plaintiff here is not challenging any action of the\ndefendants until over four months after the plaintiff's license was removed from a vehicle pursuant\nto an inventory search, inventoried, and stored.\nId. at 351 n. 6. Were we to accept the defendant's interpretation of Fox, law enforcement officers would be able to\ndetain indefinitely an individual's property based upon reasonable suspicion alone. Such an interpretation is\nwholly inconsistent with the Supreme Court's clear instruction that courts look to the duration of investigative\ndetentions of personal property to determine whether such detentions are sufficiently \"minimally intrusive\" to be\npermissible based upon reasonable suspicion falling short of probable cause. Place, 462 U.S. at 709, 103 S.Ct.\n2637.\n\nWe also find unpersuasive the defendant's contention that the concept of a \"continuing seizure\" was rejected by\nthe Supreme Court in California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 625, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991). Hodari\nD. merely explained that if a suspect flees after an initial seizure, the seizure does not continue throughout the\nsubsequent pursuit. See id. (\"To say that an arrest is effected by the slightest application of physical force,\ndespite the arrestee's escape, is not to say that for Fourth Amendment purposes there is a continuing arrest\nduring the period of fugitivity.\" (emphasis in original)). Hodari D. addresses situations where physical control over\na suspect is established, and then lost. It does not stand for the proposition that a seizure ends at the instant that\nphysical control is initially established, no matter how long a government official retains physical control of the\nsuspect thereafter.\n2. Whether the Relevant Law Was Clearly Established\nWe further conclude that the rights asserted by the plaintiffs were clearly established at the time of the challenged\ndetention. United States v. Place, upon which the plaintiffs' claims rely, was decided in 1983, twelve years before\nthe events in question. We think that case was sufficient to put a reasonable officer on notice that the seizure for\n549 four days of important personal effects from a traveler on the public roads would violate the *549 Fourth\nAmendment if based upon less than probable cause.\nIn sum, we conclude that the agreed-upon facts of this case reveal that the four-day detention of the plaintiffs'\ngreen cards based upon less than probable cause was unreasonable. Therefore, we determine that the district\ncourt properly denied Trooper Kiefer's motion for summary judgment based upon his claim of qualified immunity.\n[11]\n3. The Grant of Summary Judgment to the Plaintiffs\nOrdinarily, we would conclude our review after determining whether the defendant was entitled to qualified\nimmunity, and we would decline to address the district court's grant of partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs.\nThis is an interlocutory appeal. As explained above, we have jurisdiction to hear the instant appeal because a\ndenial of summary judgment based on \"the legal question of qualified immunity\" is an immediately appealable\norder under the \"collateral order\" doctrine. Mattox, 183 F.3d at 519. In contrast, \"a partial summary judgment on\nthe issue of liability alone is not a `final decision' under 28 U.S.C. § 1291,\" nor does such an order qualify as an\nimmediately appealable collateral order. Brennan v. Township of Northville, 78 F.3d 1152, 1157 (6th Cir.1996).\nTherefore, we would not normally have jurisdiction to consider an interlocutory appeal of the district court's grant\nof partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their Fourth Amendment claims.\nUnder the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction, however, a court of appeals may, in its discretion, \"exercise\njurisdiction over issues that are not independently appealable when those issues are `inextricably intertwined'\nwith matters over which the appellate court properly and independently has jurisdiction.\" Chambers v. Ohio Dep't\nof Human Servs., 145 F.3d 793, 797 (6th Cir.),cert. denied,525 U.S. 964, 119 S.Ct. 408, 142 L.Ed.2d 331 (1998)\n; see also Brennan, 78 F.3d at 1157. \"We have interpreted `inextricably intertwined' to mean coterminous with, or\nsubsumed in, the claim before the court on interlocutory appeal.\" Hadix v. Johnson, 228 F.3d 662, 669 (6th\nCir.2000) (quotation omitted). In Brennan, we applied the pendent appellate jurisdiction doctrine in circumstances\nanalogous to those presented here. In that case, the plaintiff brought a § 1983 claim against the city and\nindividual city officials claiming that he unconstitutionally was detained for twenty-two hours without an\narraignment. The district court denied the individual defendants' motion for summary judgment based upon\nqualified immunity. Finding no genuine dispute of fact concerning this claim, the district court also granted partial\n550 summary judgment to the plaintiff on *550 the issue of liability. Brennan, 78 F.3d at 1154. We reversed after\nconcluding that the facts, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, did not establish a violation\nof the plaintiff's constitutional rights. Id. at 1156. We went on to review the district court's partial grant of summary\njudgment to the plaintiff against the city. We noted that, although partial summary judgment is not a final decision\nsubject to review, \"[t]his case presents a special situation ... in which the issues of liability and qualified immunity\nare so related to each other that we can dispose of them together under the doctrine of pendent appellate\n\njurisdiction.\" Id. at 1157. We concluded that pendent appellate jurisdiction was appropriate because our\ndetermination that the plaintiff had not alleged facts showing a constitutional violation \"necessarily and\nunavoidably decide[d]\" the issue of whether the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment. Id. at 1158. We\nobserved that the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction under such circumstances best served \"the interest of\njudicial economy,\" since any further proceedings on the plaintiff's claim would be a waste of judicial resources\nonce it was determined that he could not show a constitutional violation. Id.\nGuided by the foregoing principles, we think it is appropriate to exercise our pendent appellate jurisdiction to\naddress the district court's grant of partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the issue of Fourth Amendment\nliability. In reviewing the issue of qualified immunity, we have determined that the agreed-upon facts of the instant\ncase demonstrate that Trooper Kiefer violated the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights by detaining their green\ncards for four days without probable cause. Where, as here, the parties do not dispute the underlying facts, this\n[12]\ndetermination necessarily subsumes the merits of the plaintiffs' constitutional claim.  In his brief, Trooper\n551 Kiefer admits that he \"does not dispute the facts found by the District Court.\"[13] Appellant's Br. at 5. A review \n*551 of the record confirms that the parties are in complete agreement as to the underlying facts relating to the\nseizure and detention of plaintiffs' green cards. Having determined that these facts show a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment, there is nothing left for us to resolve concerning the district court's grant of summary judgment to\nthe plaintiffs on the issue of liability. Thus, in the instant case, as in Brennan, \"the issues of liability and qualified\nimmunity are so related to each other that we can dispose of them together under the doctrine of pendent\nappellate jurisdiction.\" Id. at 1157.\nOur decision here is compelled by the interests of judicial efficiency underlying the pendent appellate jurisdiction\ndoctrine. See id. at 1158. A subsequent appeal of the district court's partial grant of summary judgment following\na trial to determine damages would only waste judicial resources. Any future appeal of the liability issue would be\ndecided based upon the same record that is before us. We see little benefit, therefore, in postponing judgment on\nthis question. Consequently, we exercise our pendent appellate jurisdiction and affirm the district court's decision\ngranting the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the issue of Fourth Amendment liability.\nIn sum, we conclude that the undisputed facts reveal that Trooper Kiefer violated the plaintiffs' clearly established\nrights by detaining their green cards for over four days without probable cause. We therefore affirm the district\ncourt's denial of summary judgment to defendant Kiefer, as well as the district court's decision granting partial\nsummary judgment to the plaintiffs.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the district court's denial of Trooper Kiefer's motion for summary\njudgment as to his defense of qualified immunity. Furthermore, we AFFIRM the district court's grant of partial\nsummary judgment to plaintiffs on the issue of Fourth Amendment liability and REMAND for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\nKENNEDY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\nThis appeal deals only with officer Kiefer's individual liability to plaintiffs Esparza and Aquilar for events that\noccurred after a traffic stop for a burned-out headlight. Thus, while the plaintiffs' claims are made as a part of a\nclass action, Kiefer is liable to plaintiffs only for his acts in this incident.\nPlaintiffs do not question the legitimacy of the initial traffic stop. They do not claim they were stopped because of\ntheir race. Nor do plaintiffs challenge the propriety of the drug search of their vehicle. The inquiry as to their\nimmigration status and green cards did not arise until after a drug dog had alerted to their vehicle. At that time,\nplaintiff Aquilar was in defendant's cruiser where Kiefer was checking Aquilar's Illinois driver license and\nregistration. After the dog alert, a second officer asked passenger Esparza, who was still in Aquilar's vehicle, for\nher identification and brought her to Kiefer's cruiser. Thereafter, Kiefer asked plaintiffs for Aquilar's green card\nand where they had gotten their green cards. The facts are in dispute as to just what plaintiffs said. Both plaintiffs\n552 spoke very little English. Defendant states that plaintiffs said they paid for their green cards. Plaintiffs state *552\nthey said they paid all the necessary fees for their green cards. The district court appears to have accepted the\n\ndefendant's version of what was said. For plaintiffs' equal protection claim, it makes little difference since the\ndiscrimination they complain of is the inquiry about their immigration status 00 \"that Officer Kiefer targeted them\n97\nfor investigation regarding their immigration status solely on the basis of their being Hispanic.\"\nKiefer moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs' equal protection claim on the ground that the undisputed facts\nshow that he had a racially neutral reason for inquiring about plaintiffs' immigration status; namely, their\ndifficulties in speaking and understanding English.\nHe also moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim, asserting that he seized their green\ncards when they responded to his question as to where they got the green cards with the response that they paid\nfor them. This led him to the conclusion they were obtained illegally. The possession of illegal identification is a\ncrime under Ohio law. He also asserts this is a race neutral reason for their seizure.\nWhile it is unclear whether the court rejects the inability to speak English as race neutral, if it does then it should\naffirm the summary judgment for plaintiffs since it is the race neutral basis relied on by Kiefer for his inquiry.\nThe majority, while not rejecting the inability to speak and understand English as a race neutral reason, declines\nto apply our decision in United States v. Travis, 62 F.3d 170 (6th Cir.1995),cert. denied,516 U.S. 1060, 116 S.Ct.\n738, 133 L.Ed.2d 688, in which we acknowledged that \"consensual searches may violate the Equal Protection\nclause when they are initiated solely based on racial considerations.\" Travis placed the burden on plaintiffs to\nshow that no race neutral motives played a role in the challenged police conduct. Travis, 62 F.3d at 173-74\n(explaining that when officers \"decide to interview a suspect for many reasons, some of which are legitimate and\nsome of which [are] based on race ... the use of race in the pre-contact stage does not give rise to any\nconstitutional protections.\"). While Travis deals with an equal protection challenge to consensual police interviews\nof airport travelers, and here we are dealing with questions to persons whose continued detention is because\nthere is probable cause to believe they are transporting illegal drugs, the inquiry here, if anything, is less intrusive\n00 a mere request to see another item of identification rather than a consensual search.\n97\nFurther, it is an inquiry which must be made were the officers to arrest plaintiffs since the arrest of an alien\nrequires the arresting officers to notify the alien's consulate under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations\nApril 25, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, T.I.A.S. No. 6820. Also OHSP policy # 9-902.08 requires special steps where an\nalien is arrested. These requirements apply without regard to the race of the alien. While there ordinarily may be\nno reason to inquire about immigration status in conjunction with a traffic stop, which ordinarily does not result in\nan arrest but rather a traffic citation, a broader inquiry is justified for a drug investigation which is likely to result in\nan arrest. While some other officer is searching the vehicle, I would hold that an officer could further investigate\nthe identity of the driver and passenger and the likelihood of their being from a nation that is a known drug\nsource. Nowhere is it clearly established that the officers must wait until they find the drugs before they may\n553 inquire further regarding suspects whose difficulty in speaking English suggests they may be *553 aliens. This is\nnot a case where the police initiated the investigation based on race.\nWhether Travis was correctly decided or whether it should continue to be followed, I believe it is sufficient to\nentitle Kiefer to qualified immunity in the action against him individually for damages. I would, therefore, reverse\nthe denial of qualified immunity on this issue.\nA recurring problem in this appeal is that the district court wrote no separate opinion dealing with plaintiffs' claims\nagainst Kiefer individually. The district court's opinions dealt with other defendants as well as with class claims.\nThus, in describing discriminatory conduct, neither the district court nor the majority limit their recitation of the\nfacts to Kiefer's conduct with respect to plaintiffs. Kiefer is not personally liable for another's conduct. There is no\nclaim he supervised other defendants. I am at a loss to understand how Kiefer's intent can be inferred from\nSergeant Elling's or Trooper Pache's conduct or that of other OSHP officials.\nIn rejecting Travis, the majority would adopt a standard shifting to the defendant the burden of establishing that\nthe same decision would have resulted even if the impermissible purpose had not been considered, relying on \nWayte and Armstrong. The effect of the majority's holding would greatly diminish the protection of qualified\nimmunity in equal protection claims. It would be a rare case involving a minority where plaintiff could not assert\nan issue of fact as to an officer's intent no matter how strong the non-discriminatory motive may be. I assume the\n\nmajority would apply the same balancing to cases where there is probable cause as well as to the investigative\nstop we have here. The balancing would require officers engaged in an investigation to make, at their peril and at\nevery step, a decision as to whether they would pursue their present course of investigation if they had no\ndiscriminatory motive. They may or may not be thinking of the discriminatory motive at the time. And keep in mind\nthat it is not whether this officer would or would not act the same. To be prudent the officer must consider what a\njury would be likely to conclude 00 and all this would need to be done on the spot 00 perhaps in seconds. The\n97 97\nquestion of what plays a determinate role is not one easily decided.\nConfronted by a related problem in Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89\n(1996), where an officer engaged in law enforcement was alleged to have mixed motives in stopping a vehicle\nbut had probable cause to do so, the Court held that if the officer had probable cause to stop the vehicle, the\nCourt would not inquire whether the officer had another motive.\nAlthough the court left open the question of whether Whren's holding would apply if challenged on equal\nprotection grounds, it would be a trap for the unwary if the officer were subject to a suit for damages after he or\nshe arrested someone with probable cause and a jury concluded the officer had not proved he would have made\nthe arrest except for a discriminatory purpose. I believe there is the same need for the Whren analysis in equal\nprotection claims, a holding that an officer may arrest with probable cause and that the court will not examine\nwhether the officer also had a discriminatory purpose.\nIn Whren, recognizing that the Court had been unwilling to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges based on\nindividual motivation of officers, petitioners had sought a standard as to what a reasonable officer would have\ndone under same circumstances. In rejecting that standard, the Court stated:\n554 the Fourth Amendment's concern with \"reasonableness\" allows certain actions *554 to be taken in\ncertain circumstances, whatever the subjective intent. See, e.g. [United States v. Robinson, 414\nU.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973)].\nWhren, 517 U.S. at 814, 116 S.Ct. 1769.\nElsewhere in its opinion, the Court characterized Robinson, holding as follows:\nWe described Robinson as having established that \"the fact that the officer does not have the\nstate of mind which is hypothecated by the reasons which provide the legal justification for the\nofficer's action does not invalidate the action taken as long as the circumstances, viewed\nobjectively, justify that action.\" 436 U.S. at 136, 138, 98 S.Ct. at 1723.\nId. at 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769 (quoting Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978)).\nThe Court found no need to do a balancing analysis except for cases conducted in an extraordinary manner,\nharmful to a person's privacy or physical interest. While the Court pointed out,\nBut the constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally discriminatory application of laws is the\nEqual Protection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment. Subjective intentions play no role in ordinary,\nprobable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis.\nId. at 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, it would be anomalous and a trap for the unwary to tell police officers they could arrest\nwith probable cause without regard to motivation but they would be liable for damages for the same conduct\nunder the equal protection clause unless they could prove to a jury they would have done the same without the\ndiscriminatory motive. There is no reason to believe that the Court would reject its holding that probable cause to\nbelieve the law has been broken \"outbalances\" private interest in avoiding police contact.\nI must also respectfully dissent from the majority's disposition of plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim. I do not\nbelieve we have jurisdiction to decide defendant's appeal since there is a material fact in dispute. Defendant has\nnot accepted for the purpose of this appeal plaintiffs' assertion that they told Kiefer they had paid all the\nnecessary fees, rather than, as asserted by Kiefer, that they paid for their green cards. If the jury believed\nplaintiffs' testimony, no retention after the drug investigation ended was permissible because there would have\nbeen no basis for a reasoned suspicion that the cards were counterfeit, invalid, or illegally obtained and therefore\n\ncontraband under Ohio law. Under Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995), the\ncourt of appeals may not review an interlocutory appeal on the grounds of qualified immunity where there are\nmaterial issues of fact unresolved. I would dismiss the Fourth Amendment portion of the appeal for that reason.\nWe review defendant's motion for summary judgment de novo. In the district court, Kiefer argued that he had\nprobable cause to seize the cards in view of the plaintiffs' admission that they had paid for the cards. The district\ncourt found only a reasonable suspicion to seize the cards. While defendant accepted the factual findings of the\ndistrict court, probable cause is not a fact but a legal issue reviewed de novo, Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S.\n690, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996), or at least a mixed question where the legal issues are reviewed \nde novo by the appellate court. Kiefer has continued to argue in his brief on appeal that he lawfully seized the\ncards. If we accept as fact that plaintiffs said they \"paid for the cards,\" I would hold he had probable cause to\n555 seize the cards. Even if Kiefer erred in concluding that probable cause existed to *555 seize the cards, he would\nbe entitled to qualified immunity because his conclusion was reasonable, if mistaken. Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S.\n224, 228, 229, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73\nL.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The cards would be contraband under Ohio law since they would be forged if not lawfully\nissued to plaintiffs.\nPossession of a writing known to be forged with the purpose to utter or uttering an identification card is a crime\nunder Ohio law. CRC §§ 2901.01(m), 2913.32 and 2933.42. The green card is clearly an identification card.\nKiefer knew that green cards are not legally bought and paid for. He had plaintiffs' admissions that their cards had\nbeen paid for. Clearly the cards were possessed with the intent to use them as identification. The cards were\nevidence of the suspected crime. They could easily be destroyed if not retained. As the district court recognized,\nOhio State Highway Patrol troopers are entitled to seize forged documents. (J.A. 205)\nAs the Court stated in Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983):\n[P]robable cause is a flexible, common-sense standard. It merely requires that the facts available\nto the officer would \"warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief,\" Carroll v. United States,\n267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S.Ct. 280, 288, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925), that certain items may be contraband\nor stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime; it does not demand any showing that such a\nbelief be correct or more likely true than false. A \"practical, nontechnical\" probability that\nincriminating evidence is involved is all that is required. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160,\n176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949).\nId. at 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535.\nIf the cards were legally seized on this basis, the continued retention of the green cards does not constitute a\n[1]\nseparate Fourth Amendment seizure. Fox v. Van Oosterum, 176 F.3d 342 (6th Cir.1999).\nIf I am in error and there was no probable cause to seize the cards, then I agree that United States v. Place, 462\nU.S. 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983) was the controlling-established law and the cards were required\nto be returned after the search for drugs was completed.\nFinally, I do not believe we should apply the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction and affirm the grant of\nsummary judgment to plaintiffs for at least three reasons. First, the parties have been given no opportunity to\nbrief the issue. While plaintiffs asked that we review additional issues beyond defendant's qualified immunity, that\nmotion was not granted.\nSecond, in granting summary judgment to plaintiffs, the court is foreclosing defendant Kiefer from appealing the\nissue of whether he had probable cause to seize the green cards. Judge Moore's opinion holds that in his brief on\n556 appeal Kiefer does not challenge the district court's ruling that he *556 did not possess probable cause to seize\nthe green cards and does not address the merits of that issue. Although Kiefer did not raise the issue specifically\nin his brief, he has not waived it explicitly either and has argued in his brief in chief that the cards could be seized\nas contraband, a status they could achieve only if there were probable cause for their seizure. It is patently unfair\nto grant summary judgment to plaintiffs without reviewing an issue they raised in the district court but may not\nhave adequately raised on the limited appeal of a qualified immunity defense. In effect, the panel is requiring that\n\ndefendants appealing on qualified immunity must appeal all possible issues and if defendants fail to appeal an\nissue, judgment may be entered against them and they will be foreclosed from presenting that issue at trial.\nThird, neither we nor the district court have clearly defined the boundaries of the constitutional violation. Judge\nMoore's opinion concludes that at least the retention of the cards beyond some time on Monday, when their\nvalidity could have been checked, violated the Fourth Amendment. If the violation is controlled by Place, and\nthere was no probable cause, it seems to me that retention of the green cards after finding no drugs and\npermitting plaintiffs to be on their way completed the constitutional violation. A green card seems as closely\nrelated and important to a traveler as luggage and the Supreme Court held in Place that a seizure of drugs based\non reasonable suspicion could not be extended 90 minutes to wait for the drug dog. The district court appears to\nhold that the retention for verification \"would only be permissible under the Fourth Amendment if Trooper Kiefer\nmade clear to plaintiffs how he planned to reunite them and the green cards and if retention was no longer than\nabsolutely necessary to verify the documents.\" (J.A. 210) While the Court in Place held that \"the violation was\nexacerbated by the failure of the agents to accurately inform respondent of the place to which they were\ntransporting his luggage, of the length of time he might be dispossessed, and of what arrangements would be\nmade for return of the luggage if the investigation dispelled the suspicion.\" 462 U.S. at 710, 103 S.Ct. 2637, there\nis no suggestion that providing that information is constitutionally required or that, standing alone, the failure to\ngive such information is a constitutional violation.\nAlso, while the district court seems to accept the officer's testimony that plaintiffs told them they paid for the\ncards, plaintiffs have not abandoned their claim that they told him they had paid the necessary fees. (App.Br.4)\nThey maintain there was no reasonable suspicion justifying retention of the cards in light of that answer. If the jury\nbelieved they said \"fees\" or paid the fees, it could find there was no basis to retain the cards beyond the time\n[2]\ntaken for the drug investigation.\nIn granting summary judgment to plaintiffs, the district court also held that Kiefer was required to give plaintiffs\nsome kind of substitute card. I cannot agree that this requirement was clearly established or constitutionally\nrequired.\nThe court is granting summary judgment to both plaintiffs. The second officer, not defendant Kiefer, took the\n557 green *557 card from Esparza. The record is unclear as to the relationship between defendant Kiefer and the\nsecond officer. They appear to have arrived in separate vehicles, but even this is unclear. While Kiefer retained\nEsparza's card, he was not the one who seized it.\nIn view of the factual issues, the uncertainty as to the parameters of the Fourth Amendment violation, the lack of\nbriefing, the denial of the ability to raise the probable cause issue on appeal of summary judgment for plaintiffs,\neven though he clearly did not waive it, I do not believe we should decide plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment\non the Fourth Amendment claim. It seems to me that affirming summary judgment for plaintiffs on our own\ninitiative requires more certainty than we have here. I do not see the issue that is inextricably intertwined in the\nissues properly before us.\n[1] In this opinion, we address only Trooper Kiefer's claims on appeal. Although the Notice of Appeal refers to \"all\nDefendants,\" Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\") at 258, the Appellants' brief discusses only Trooper Kiefer's defense of\nqualified immunity. We therefore decline to consider any appellate issues relating to the other defendants in this\naction. See Ahlers v. Schebil, 188 F.3d 365, 374 (6th Cir.1999) (explaining that issues not raised in briefs on\nappeal may be deemed waived).\n[2] It was later determined that the dog had alerted in error, and that neither of the plaintiffs were carrying drugs.\n[3] The dissent argues that we do not have jurisdiction to consider defendant's appeal on the Fourth Amendment\nissue because Trooper Kiefer has not accepted plaintiffs' version of the facts. We disagree. In his brief, Trooper\nKiefer clearly states that he \"does not dispute the facts found by the District Court.\" Appellant's Br. at 5. Morever,\neven if the parties were not in agreement on the facts, we still would have jurisdiction to decide the legal question\nof qualified immunity 00 i.e., whether, assuming the plaintiffs' version of the facts to be true, the plaintiffs have\n97\nshown a violation of their clearly established constitutional rights. Johnson merely establishes that we lack\n\njurisdiction over \"a portion of a district court's summary judgment order that, though entered in a `qualified\nimmunity' case, determines only a question of `evidence sufficiency,' i.e., which facts a party may, or may not, be\nable to prove at trial.\" 515 U.S. at 313, 115 S.Ct. 2151. For example, we would not have jurisdiction over Kiefer's\nappeal if his argument were merely that the plaintiffs cannot prove that he seized their green cards. Such an \"[I]\ndidn't do it\" defense would present a Johnson problem. Id. at 316, 115 S.Ct. 2151. Nevertheless, Johnson does\nnot preclude our review of purely legal questions, such as whether a given set of facts alleged by the plaintiffs\nwould demonstrate a constitutional violation.\n[4] We note that the record contains no indication that the OSHP employs explicit racial criteria or admits to\nracially-motivated decision making. If such a showing could be made, the plaintiffs would not need to establish\nthe existence of a similarly situated class that was not investigated. See Brown v. City of Oneonta, 221 F.3d 329,\n337 (2d Cir.2000) (\"[I]t is not necessary to plead the existence of a similarly situated non-minority group when\nchallenging a law or policy that contains an express, racial classification.\"), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct.\n44, 151 L.Ed.2d 16 (2001); cf. United States v. Ovalle, 136 F.3d 1092, 1104-05 (6th Cir.1998) (holding that it is\nunnecessary for criminal defendant to establish three-prong test for discrimination in grand jury selection where\nthere is direct evidence of exclusion based upon race). \"In its more recent pronouncements on laws based on\nracial classifications, the Supreme Court has started `from the premise that [l]aws that explicitly distinguish\nbetween individuals on racial grounds fall within the core of [the Equal Protection Clause's] prohibition.'\" Ovalle,\n136 F.3d at 1105 (quoting Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 905, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 132 L.Ed.2d 762 (1995)). Where\nthe state adopts explicit racial criteria, strict scrutiny will automatically be applied, even in the absence of\nevidence of discriminatory purpose. Wayte, 470 U.S. at 610 n. 10, 105 S.Ct. 1524; Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S.\n541, 546, 119 S.Ct. 1545, 143 L.Ed.2d 731 (1999) (\"When racial classifications are explicit, no inquiry into\nlegislative purpose is necessary.\").\n[5] Since we decline to address the sufficiency of the plaintiffs' evidence to show the underlying factual elements\nof a selective enforcement claim, we likewise do not consider the propriety of the district court's partial grant of\nsummary judgment to the plaintiffs on the issue of Fourteenth Amendment liability. We note, however, that even a\ncursory review of the record reveals, for example, that Kiefer and other OSHP officials deny selecting motorists\nfor immigration interviews based upon Hispanic appearance. If a trier of fact believed this testimony, it would\nnegate the intent element of plaintiffs' equal protection claim. The record contains other factual disputes as well.\nFor example, Kiefer maintains in his deposition that only about half of the motorists he questions concerning\nimmigration violations are Hispanic, which conflicts with the district court's determination that nearly all\nimmigration investigations are initiated against Hispanic motorists. It seems apparent, therefore, that the record is\nnot as one-sided as the district court believed. Thus, although we are without jurisdiction to review the court's\ngrant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs on the Fourteenth Amendment issue, we do think the grant of\nsummary judgment likely was premature, and we suggest that the district court reconsider this decision on\nremand. In any event, the defendant remains free to challenge the grant of summary judgment on the Fourteenth\nAmendment claim following a final order from the district court.\n[6] The defendant also asserts in his reply brief that the alert of the drug-sniffing dog provided a race-neutral\nreason to inquire into immigration status and inspect resident alien cards. We think this argument is without merit.\nLieutenant Healy of the TDIT admitted the presence of narcotics bears no rational relation to the likelihood that\nthe drivers are illegal immigrants, and the defendant concedes this point in his reply brief. Appellant's Reply Br. at\n3. Instead, the defendant contends that because the Vienna Convention requires foreign nationals to be informed\nof their right to communicate with a consular officer of their home country if they are arrested or imprisoned, the\ndefendant had a racially-neutral reason to inquire into the plaintiffs' immigration status 00 namely, to determine\n97\nwhether information consistent with the Vienna Convention needed to be given. This argument appears to have\nbeen raised for the first time in the defendant's reply brief on appeal, and it is not supported by any evidence in\nthe record, so we decline to consider it. The defendant points to no evidence in the record to show that it is the\npractice of the OSHP to provide such information to arrested foreign nationals. Nor is there any evidence in the\nrecord that Trooper Kiefer considered the requirements of the Vienna Convention when deciding whether to\npursue an investigation of the plaintiffs' immigration status.\n[7] In his reply brief, Trooper Kiefer further suggests that United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 96 S.Ct.\n3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976), created uncertainty in the law as to whether it was appropriate to target\n\nindividuals for immigration inquiries based in part upon their Hispanic appearance. The Martinez-Fuerte Court\nheld that it was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment for officials at a fixed border checkpoint selectively to\nrefer motorists to a secondary inspection area, \"even if it be assumed that such referrals are made largely on the\nbasis of apparent Mexican ancestry.\" Id. at 563, 96 S.Ct. 3074. We think this argument is unavailing to the\ndefendant. Martinez-Fuerte was a Fourth Amendment case, not an Equal Protection case. The Court's decision\nin Martinez-Fuerte merely considered whether, for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, the Border Patrol was\nrequired to articulate an individualized basis for suspicion beyond the motorists' apparent nationality to justify the\nstop. The Court's holding was based upon its conclusion that because the intrusion presented by the checkpoint\nstop was \"sufficiently minimal[,] ... no particularized reason need exist to justify it.\" Id. The Court did not consider\nwhether, if the Border Patrol relied upon racial or ethnic classifications in making the stop, such actions would\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause. Consideration of this issue was rendered unnecessary by the Court's\nconclusion that the Border Patrol had offered conclusive evidence \"to refute any suggestion that the Border Patrol\nrelies extensively on apparent Mexican ancestry standing alone in referring motorists to the secondary area.\" Id.\nat 563 n. 16, 96 S.Ct. 3074. The Martinez-Fuerte Court, moreover, limited its holding to the particular\ncircumstance of a checkpoint at the Mexican border, and noted that \"[d]ifferent considerations would arise if, for\nexample, reliance were put on apparent Mexican ancestry at a checkpoint operated near the Canadian border.\" \nId. at 564 n. 17, 96 S.Ct. 3074. Given that the challenged stop occurred near Toledo, Ohio, a location much\ncloser to the Canadian border than to the Mexican border, we think Martinez-Fuerte offers little support for\nTrooper Kiefer's argument.\n[8] Judge Kennedy's dissent maintains that Trooper Kiefer did have probable cause to seize the green cards. The\ndissent points out that Trooper Kiefer argued that he had probable cause in the district court. Nevertheless, Kiefer\ndid not renew that argument on appeal, and therefore has waived the argument. Nowhere in his opening brief or\nreply brief does Trooper Kiefer challenge the district court's determination that the facts gave rise to no more than\nreasonable suspicion that the green cards were forged. It is well established that an issue not raised in a party's\nbriefs on appeal may be deemed waived. See Ahlers, 188 F.3d at 374. Although Trooper Kiefer does argue in his\nappellate briefs that the initial seizure of the green cards was valid, he bases this claim on the district court's\nconclusion that his seizure was supported by reasonable suspicion. On appeal, Trooper Kiefer's only argument is\nthat once reasonable suspicion was established to justify the initial seizure, the Fourth Amendment placed no\nlimits on the duration of the ensuing detention. If Trooper Kiefer desired to challenge this aspect of the district\ncourt's ruling, the instant appeal would have been the proper time to do so. The legal question of whether the\nundisputed facts demonstrate that Kiefer had probable cause to seize the plaintiffs' green cards is directly\nrelevant to step one of the qualified immunity test, insofar as it relates to whether the plaintiffs have shown a\nconstitutional violation under Place.\n[9] Such a detention would still be considerably longer than the ninety-minute detention rejected in Place. It is\nunnecessary to consider whether Place imposes a shorter time limit on the challenged seizure, since Trooper\nKiefer's detention of the plaintiffs' green cards was well in excess of the length of time the district court or we\nwould approve. \nThe dissent argues that if the seizure of plaintiffs' green cards is controlled by Place, then the constitutional\nviolation was complete as soon as the search of plaintiffs' vehicle was completed. For the purposes of the instant\ncase, we think it is enough that the four-day length of detention at issue exceeded any acceptable time limit for a\nseizure based upon less than probable cause under these circumstances. We see no need to consider whether a\nshorter detention might also have violated the Fourth Amendment under Place. Both Place and Sharpe counsel\nagainst unnecessarily setting per se time limits on Terry-style seizures. We therefore decline to do so.\n[10] We note that we do not mean to suggest that Trooper Kiefer's failure to provide plaintiffs with this information\nconstitutes a per se Fourth Amendment violation. We simply hold that this factor enters into the totality of\ncircumstances to be considered in deciding whether the seizure was more than minimally intrusive.\n[11] Judge Kennedy's dissent voices concerns about a ruling by the district court, which allegedly held that\nTrooper Kiefer was required to provide the plaintiffs with a lawful substitute for their green cards. We are unable\nto locate any such ruling in the record. In its September 8, 1999, order granting summary judgment to the\nplaintiffs on their Fourth Amendment claims, the district court dissolved a preliminary injunction in which the court\n\nhad ordered OSHP officers to issue substitute documents when they seize green cards known to be valid. We\nare not aware of any order reinstating that injunction. Furthermore, even if such an order existed, the issue is not\nrelevant to the instant appeal. The only issues before us are the specific constitutional claims of plaintiffs Aguilar\nand Esparza against Trooper Kiefer. In its September 8, 1999, order, the district court explained that its previous\nruling concerning the necessity of issuing lawful substitutes did not apply to the claims of Aguilar and Esparza,\nbecause they made \"no allegation that OSHP troopers seized green cards known to be valid.\" J.A. at 206.\n[12] The dissent argues that a factual dispute still exists as to whether the plaintiffs told Trooper Kiefer that they\nhad paid for the green cards or only that they had paid the necessary fees. Our review of the record, however,\nreveals that all parties agree on the substance of the conversation between Trooper Kiefer and the plaintiffs.\nThere is no dispute that Trooper Kiefer asked the plaintiffs whether they had paid for their green cards or that the\nplaintiffs answered in the affirmative. The plaintiffs contend that they meant that they had paid the necessary\nfees; but they have never claimed that they specifically answered Kiefer's question by saying that they had only\npaid for processing fees. The only remaining question then is the legal question of whether this exchange gave\nrise to mere reasonable suspicion or to something more. The district court concluded that the plaintiffs' answers\ngave rise to no more than reasonable suspicion, given the plaintiffs' obvious difficulty understanding Kiefer's\nquestions. Trooper Kiefer does not dispute this conclusion. Consequently, we disagree with the dissent's\nassertion that material disputes of fact remain with respect to this issue.\n[13] We emphasize that this is not a case in which the defendant concedes to the plaintiff's view of the facts for\nthe purposes of appeal only. We recognize that after Johnson, 515 U.S. at 313, 115 S.Ct. 2151, a defendant\nseeking interlocutory appeal of a denial of qualified immunity generally is well served to assume the correctness\nof the plaintiff's version of the facts for the purposes of appeal in order limit the appeal to the purely legal issue of\nqualified immunity. Such a limited concession obviously would not bind the defendant to the plaintiff's account of\nthe facts. But this case is different; Trooper Kiefer did not merely assume the plaintiffs' version of the facts to be\ntrue for the purposes of appeal. The record makes clear that there is no dispute between the parties as to the\nmaterial facts relating to the seizure and detention of the plaintiffs' green cards. Our decision to exercise our\npendent appellate jurisdiction, therefore, is limited to the unique circumstances presented when, as here, the\nrecord clearly demonstrates that the only issue in dispute between the parties is the legal question of whether an\nofficer's admitted conduct violates the Constitution.\n[1] As we stated in United States v. Anderson, 923 F.2d 450, 457 (6th Cir.1991), \"probable cause is determined\nby an objective examination of all of the circumstances known to the officers. Just as a subjective belief by the\narresting officer would not establish probable cause where none existed, a subjective belief by the arresting\nofficer cannot destroy probable cause where it exists.\" (citing Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 507, 103 S.Ct.\n1319, 1329, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1982)). \nOur court went on to hold that \"knowledge of the precise crime committed is not necessary to a finding of\nprobable cause provided that probable cause exists showing that a crime was committed by the defendants.\" Id.\nat 457.\n[2] It is unclear whether plaintiffs will be permitted to show that the officer was without basis to seize the green\ncards because they said they paid the fees 00 not that they paid for the cards. Their damages may be different if\n97\nthere were no basis for seizing the cards. [Will defendant be precluded from arguing that the appearance of one\nof the cards made him question its validity? A fact he testified to in his deposition.]\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
