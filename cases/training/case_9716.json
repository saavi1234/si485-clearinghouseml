    "summary": "<p>On June 9, 2005, seven plaintiffs, represented by attorneys with the Florida Justice Institute, filed a 42 U.S.C. §1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, challenging the allegedly unconstitutional practice of subjecting all non-felony arrestees booked into the John E. Polk Correctional Facility (a/k/a \"the Seminole County Jail\") to strip and visual body cavity searches prior to their first appearance before a judge.  All but one of the named plaintiffs had been arrested for failure to appear at court appointments for non-violent crimes and all named plaintiffs were strip searched pursuant to the County's blanket strip search policy.  Plaintiffs initially alleged that the blanket strip search policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as Florida state law.  On August, 2, 2005, Plaintiffs amended the complaint in order to further challenge, under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, the defendants' practice of allegedly over-detaining persons who had been ordered to be immediately released by a judge.  On August 2, 2005, an eighth named plaintiff was added to the complaint and, on April 20, 2006 the complaint was again amended to add a ninth named plaintiff.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary and punitive damages, and class certification.   </p><p>The County and Sheriff answered the complaint by denying all allegations.  They also maintained that, shortly after the December 3, 2004 incident involving the majority of the named Plaintiffs, the Sheriff revised its strip search policy.  The new policy became effective on August 30, 2005.</p><p>The County and the Sheriff moved to dismiss the case.  The Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss as to the Fourth Amendment strip search claim, but dismissed Plaintiffs' state law strip search claim and their over-detention claim.  Parilla v. Eslinger, 2005 WL 3288760 (M.D.Fla. Dec 05, 2005). </p><p>Following discovery, the case was submitted to mediation.  Shortly after mediation, the case was settled.  Under the terms of the settlement, which was approved by Judge Gregory A. Presnell on May 24, 2007, the 9 representative plaintiffs received a total of $360,000.  Defendants also agreed to pay each verified Settlement Class Member (SCM) up to $1800.  The parties estimated that there were between 6 and 19 potential SCMs.  In addition, $206,000 was paid as attorneys' fees, costs and expenses.</p><p></p>",

PARILLA, ALDA RUGG, BILLY\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 67-3      Filed 12/29/2006     Page 3 of 17\nCATES, THERESA DECLUE, AILEEN NUNEZ, DAVID W. ROBERTS, and FRANTARSHIA\nSTAFFORD, on behalf of themselves and all persons similarly situated, filed a complaint in the\nabove-captioned matter in which they challenged, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, certain practices\nof Defendants including the strip search of certain detainees, prior to first appearance, and sought\ndamages and declaratory and injunctive relief.  The complaint was subsequently amended to\nchallenge the practices of the Defendants to unreasonably detain persons ordered immediately\nreleased by a judge or who have posted bond and are held for an unreasonable time period prior to\nbeing released from the John E. Polk Correctional Facility.  The complaint was subsequently\namended to add Named Representative Plaintiffs KIM LEMISTER and SHANE BRADLEY.\nThe parties entered into extensive discovery which included exchange of documents,\npreparation  of  and  responses  to  request  for  production  of  documents,  interrogatories,  and\ndepositions.\nShortly after the December 3, 2004 incident involving the majority of the named Plaintiffs,\nthe Sheriff’s Office reviewed the formal policy and training on strip searches at the John E. Polk\nCorrectional Facility.  As a consequence of that review, the Sheriff’s Office revised the policy.  The\nnew policy, made effective August 30, 2005 and revised on October 15, 2005, complies with Fla.\nStat. § 901.211 regarding strip searches.  A copy of the current policy, Policy and Procedure Number\n09.13,  relating to the strip search and body cavity searches of pre-first appearance detainees is\nattached hereto as Exhibit “1”. \n  On February 3, 2006, Judge Presnell issued an order substituting Terrance Schmidt as the\nmediator.  Mediation was conducted on March 27, 2006.  The parties attended the mediation and\ncontinued to discuss settlement after further discovery of various documents, and have now agreed\nto this Stipulation of Settlement which, subject to the approval of the Court, settles this action in the\nmanner and upon the terms set forth below and fully resolves the dispute.\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED, by and between the\nParties, as follows:\n-3-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 67-3      Filed 12/29/2006     Page 4 of 17\nII.\nDEFINITIONS FOR THIS STIPUATION\n1.  The “Bar Date” is the date established by the Court by which any Settlement Class\nMember (“SCM”) who wishes to receive payment pursuant to this Stipulation of Settlement must\nfile his/her Claim Form(s), objections to this Stipulation of Settlement, or request to be excluded\nfrom the class (opt-out).\n2.  The “Claim Form” is the form required to be used to make a claim for payment under this\nsettlement.  A copy of the proposed Claim Form is attached as Exhibit “2”.\n3.  “Class Counsel” means, collectively, The Law Office of Larry Hanks, P.A., and Larry\nHanks, attorney; and the Florida Justice Institute, Inc., and Randall C.

The judgment will be deemed final only\nupon expiration of the time to appeal or, if a Notice of Appeal is filed, upon exhaustion of all appeals\nand petitions for writ of certiorari.\n7.  “First appearance” means the procedure described in Rule 3.130, Florida Rules of\nCriminal Procedure.  For purposes of this settlement, and to determine whether a person is an actual\nremand by court under Paragraph 11, a first appearance occurs when a person has actually appeared\nbefore a judge and been ordered into the custody of the Sheriff.\n8.  The “Named Representative Plaintiffs” are RONALD M. PARILLA, ALDA RUGG, THE\nESTATE OF BILLY CATES, THERESA DECLUE, AILEEN NUNEZ, DAVID W.

The Settlement Class means all persons who meet all of the following criteria: (1)\nerroneously designated during the Class Period by the John E. Polk Correctional Facility as a\n\"remand by court\" (RBC) and thereby strip-searched; (2) who were at the time of the RBC\ndesignation facing only charges of a violation of a municipal ordinance, a traffic infraction, or\nmisdemeanor charge not involving violence, drugs, or weapons; (3) who did not actually appear\nbefore a judge prior to the strip search; and (4) for whom there was not probable cause for a strip\nsearch to check for contraband or weapons.  The Settlement Class is estimated to number between\nsix (6) and nineteen (19) individuals and is anticipated to consist primarily of individuals who were\narrested at the Seminole County Courthouse.\n12.  A “Settlement Class Member” (“SCM”) means any member of the Settlement Class\nincluding representatives, successors and assigns, who does not file a valid and timely Request for\nExclusion  as  provided  in  Paragraph  45  of  this  Stipulation  of  Settlement.    The  “Named\nRepresentative Plaintiffs” are not SCMs.\n13.  “Special Master” shall mean Magistrate Judge Karla R. Spaulding of the United States\nDistrict Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, who shall be appointed by the Court\nto preside over disputes related to this Stipulation of Settlement and who shall have power to make\ndecisions in all matters pertaining to administration and enforcement of the Stipulation of Settlement.\n14.  “Strip search” is as defined in Fla.

It does not\ninclude a visual or non-intrusive inspection when done by medical personnel for medical reasons.\n-5-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 67-3      Filed 12/29/2006     Page 6 of 17\nIII.\nTERMS AND EFFECT OF STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT\n15.  This Stipulation of Settlement is for settlement purposes only, and neither the fact of,\nnor any provision contained in this Stipulation of Settlement or its exhibits, nor any action taken\nhereunder shall constitute, be construed as, or be admissible in evidence as any admission of the\nvalidity of any claim or any fact alleged by Plaintiffs or SCMs in this action or in any other pending\naction or of any wrongdoing, fault, violation of law, or liability of any kind on the part of Defendants\nor admission by Defendants of any claim or allegation made in this action or in any other action, nor\nas an admission by any of the Plaintiffs, SCMs or Class Counsel of the validity of any fact or defense\nasserted against them in this action or in any other action.  Defendants deny all allegations of\nwrongdoing and deny any liability to Plaintiffs or to any other class members.  The parties have\nagreed that, in order to avoid long and costly litigation, this controversy should be settled pursuant\nto the terms of this settlement, subject to the approval of the Court.\n16.  The parties agree solely for the purposes of this settlement and implementation that the\nwithin action shall proceed as a class action, with the Settlement Class as defined in Paragraph 11,\nand that attorneys for the Class are Class Counsel as defined in Paragraph 3, but if such settlement\nfails to be approved or otherwise fails of consumption, then this Stipulation of Settlement is hereby\nwithdrawn.\n17.  The parties agree that the “Named Representative Plaintiffs” will not pursue the claims\nfor themselves or for a class of unnamed persons for “overdetention,” or the perceived delay in\noutprocessing once an inmate has been ordered to be released by a Court or paid a bond. \n18.  In return for the release of any claims for overdetention or delay in outprocessing, and\nin recognition of the benefit to future inmates, the Sheriff’s Office, and Seminole County, of\nreducing  the  time  required  to  perform  these  tasks,  the  Sheriff’s  Office  has  either  already\nimplemented or will implement in the near future, the following changes:\na. The Sheriff’s Office has purchased and is installing an automated telephonic\n-6-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 67-3      Filed 12/29/2006     Page 7 of 17\ninformation system that will allow members of the public to call and obtain\ninformation about friends and family who are inmates.  This information will include\npending charges, bond amount, and court dates.  This information will be available\nin both English and Spanish.  The Sheriff’s Office has also purchased a module for\nthis system that will make this information available over the Internet.  The purpose\nof this system is to improve communications between the public and the John E. Polk\nCorrectional Facility and to reduce the time that intake and release clerks spend\nanswering such inquiries.  The Sheriff will report to the Court as soon as this task is\ncompleted.  The Sheriff's Office agrees that, for a period of two years from the\nEffective Date, it will not substantively change this policy without first conferring\nwith Plaintiffs' counsel or, in the event that counsel cannot agree on the change, the\nCourt.\nb. The Sheriff’s Office has created four (4) additional positions [two (2) quality\nassurance specialists and two (2) detention service officers] in intake and release.\nThe Sheriff’s Office is working to fill those positions.  In the meantime, the Sheriff’s\nOffice has reorganized staff to create special “release teams” that will focus on\noutprocessing during the highest volume days and times, particularly Wednesday and\nThursday of each week, when volume of release is heaviest.  The Sheriff will report\nto the Court as soon as these positions are filled.  The Sheriff's Office agrees that, for\na period of two years from the Effective Date, it will not substantively change this\npolicy without first conferring with Plaintiffs' counsel or, in the event that counsel\ncannot agree on the change, the parties will bring to the Court for resolution.\nc. When an inmate is first booked into the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, one of the\nintake procedures is to obtain an National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check\non the inmate.  When that inmate is to be released, another NCIC check is usually run\nin order to determine whether new warrants or holds have been issued.  Beginning\n-7-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 67-3      Filed 12/29/2006     Page 8 of 17\nat the latest January 1, 2007, for those inmates who have no aliases and no prior\narrests, the initial NCIC check shall be used for the first twenty-four (24) hours of\ndetention such that, if an inmate meets that criteria and is ordered to be released or\nposts bond within twenty-four (24) hours of intake, no additional NCIC check shall\nbe necessary.  The Sheriff will report to the Court as soon as this intake procedure is\ncomplete.  The Sheriff's Office agrees that, for a period of two years from the\nEffective Date, it will not substantively change this policy without first conferring\nwith Plaintiffs' counsel or, in the event that counsel cannot agree on the change, the\nparties will bring to the Court for resolution.\nd. The Sheriff’s Office will observe that an order stating that an inmate is subject to\n“immediate release” will be released as soon as possible, without the formal release\nprocess, and the goal for release in that circumstance shall be thirty(30) minutes or\nless.  The Sheriff will report to the Court as soon as this procedure is implemented.\nThe Sheriff's Office agrees that, for a period of two years from the Effective Date, it\nwill not substantively change this policy without first conferring with Plaintiffs'\ncounsel or, in the event that counsel cannot agree on the change, the parties will bring\nto the Court for resolution.\n19.  There are no persons currently known to the Plaintiffs and their counsel who were\nrelying on the possible class certification for the waived claim of “overdetention” or the perceived\ndelay in outprocessing once a person has been ordered to be released by a court or paid a bond.\nHowever, in the event there are such persons, Defendants hereby agree and stipulate as follows:\na. Defendants hereby waive and shall not assert the defense of statute of limitations\nagainst any person who files a claim in a lawsuit for “overdetention” or the perceived\ndelay in outprocessing once a person has been ordered to be released by a court or\npaid a bond from June 9, 2001 until four (4) years prior to the Effective Date\nprovided said claim has been filed in another lawsuit no more than sixty (60) days\n-8-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 67-3      Filed 12/29/2006     Page 9 of 17\nafter the Effective Date.\n20.  There are no persons currently known to the Plaintiffs and their counsel who do not meet\nthe criteria of Paragraph 11 who were relying on the possible class certification to include all\npersons arrested on municipal ordinance, infraction or misdemeanor charges not involving violence,\ndrugs or weapons who, prior to first appearance were incarcerated in the John E. Polk Correctional\nFacility, and who were strip searched without “probable cause” reported in writing on an incident\nform.  However, in the event there are such persons, Defendants hereby agree and stipulate as\nfollows:\na. Defendants hereby waive and shall not assert the defense of statute of limitations\nagainst any person who files a claim in a lawsuit for “being illegally strip searched”\nfrom June 9, 2001 until four (4) years prior to the Effective Date provided said claim\nhas been filed in another lawsuit no more than sixty (60) days after the Effective\nDate.\n21.  SCMs who comply with the requirements set forth in this Stipulation of Settlement will\nbe paid specified sums determined by the procedures set forth herein in full satisfaction of all claims.\n  22.  The Stipulation of Settlement, as of the Effective Date, resolves in full all claims against\nthe Released Persons by all of the SCMs, including the Named Representative Plaintiffs  RONALD\nM.

ROBERTS,\nKIM LEMISTER, SHANE BRADLEY, FRANTARSHIA STAFFORD, and the ESTATE OF\nBILLY CATES, involving violation of their Fourth Amendment rights, their Fourteenth Amendment\nrights, or of any other federal, state or local law, regulation, duty, or obligation which are based upon\nor could be based upon or arise from the facts alleged in Case No. 6:05-cv-850-GAP-KRS filed in\nthe United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando  Division, including the Named\nRepresentative  Plaintiffs'  claims  for  unlawful  strip  searching  and  overdetention  or  delay  in\noutprocessing.  When the Stipulation of Settlement is final, as of the Effective Date, all SCMs,\nincluding the Named Representative Plaintiffs, hereby release all such claims.\n-9-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 67-3      Filed 12/29/2006     Page 10 of 17\n23.  The Parties  agree that the Court, by preliminarily approving the Stipulation of\nSettlement, will be certifying the class as defined in Paragraph 11, as the Settlement Class, subject\nto final approval of this Stipulation of Settlement at the fairness hearing and that the Court shall\nretain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction of the action, Parties, SCMs, and the Special Master to\ninterpret and enforce the terms, conditions and obligations under this agreement.\n24.  The parties further agree that once this Stipulation of Settlement is entered as an Order\nof the Court, the Court shall retain jurisdiction for two (2) years to enforce the implementation of\nthose measures set forth in Paragraph 18. \n25.  As of the Effective Date of this Stipulation of Settlement, the SCMs, including the\nNamed Representative Plaintiffs, hereby waive any and all rights to pursue, initiate, prosecute, or\ncommence any action or proceeding before any court, administrative agency or other tribunal, or to\nfile any complaint with regard to acts of commission or omission by the Released Persons respecting\nsuch SCMs with respect to any strip search by Defendants prior to their first appearance which\noccurred during the Class Period, or for “overdetention” or the perceived delay in outprocessing once\na person has been ordered to be released by a Court or paid a bond \n26.  This Stipulation of Settlement contains all the terms and conditions agreed upon by the\nParties hereto regarding the subject matter of the instant proceeding, and no oral agreement entered\ninto at any time nor any written agreement entered into prior to the execution of this Stipulation shall\nbe deemed to exist, or to bind the Parties hereto, or to vary the terms and conditions contained\nherein, except as expressly provided herein.\n27.  The ESTATE OF BILLY CATES shall be substituted for Named Representative Plaintiff\nBILLY CATES.\n28.  No Opt-Out shall share in any monetary benefits provided by this Stipulation of\nSettlement.\n29.  This agreement is subject to and conditioned upon the final approval of this Stipulation\nof Settlement and the issuance of the final order by the United States District Court, Middle District\n-10-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 67-3      Filed 12/29/2006     Page 11 of 17\nof Florida, Orlando Division, providing the below specified relief, which relief shall be pursuant to\nthe terms and conditions of this Stipulation of Settlement and the Parties’ performance of their\ncontinuing rights and obligations hereunder.  The order and judgment will be deemed final only upon\nexpiration of the time to appeal, or if a Notice of Appeal is filed, upon exhaustion of all appeals and\npetitions for writs of certiorari.  Such final order and judgment shall: \na. Dismiss with prejudice all complaints in the action as to the Released Persons;\nb. Provide that no SCM shall assert against any Released Person any claims which the\nSCMs had, has, or may have in the future arising out of the facts alleged in the\nComplaint;\nc. Release each Released Person from the claims which any SCMs has, had, or may\nhave in the future, against such Released Person arising out of the facts alleged in the\nComplaint;\nd. Determine that this Stipulation of Settlement is entered into in good faith, is\nreasonable, fair and adequate, and in the best interest of the Class; and \ne. Reserve the Court’s continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the Parties to this\nStipulation of  Settlement, including Defendants and all SCMs, to administer,\nsupervise, construe and enforce the Stipulation of Settlement in accordance with the\nterms for the mutual benefit of all the Parties.\n30.  The parties will take all necessary and appropriate steps to obtain preliminary approval\nof the Stipulation of Settlement, final approval of the Settlement, and entry of a final order, as\ndescribed in Paragraph 29.  If the Court finally approves this Stipulation of Settlement, and if there\nis an appeal from such decision, the Defendants will not oppose Plaintiffs’ efforts to defend the\nStipulation of Settlement.\nIV.\nRESOLUTION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES\n31.  The total settlement amount which shall be used to pay all claims, attorney fees and\n-11-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 67-3      Filed 12/29/2006     Page 12 of 17\nlitigation expenses shall be $620,000.00 (Six Hundred and Twenty Thousand Dollars).

Polk Correctional Facility in Seminole County and strip-searched\nprior to your first appearance between June 9, 2001 and August 30,\n2005, and are entitled to monetary compensation under a class action\nsettlement.\nIf You Wish to Claim Monetary Compensation, fill out and return by mail\nthe enclosed Claim Form as Soon as Possible but No Later than May 4,\n2007.\nFor more information, please read this notice.\nThere is now pending in the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, an action\nfiled as a class action on behalf of persons allegedly illegally strip searched and unreasonably detained after\nbeing ordered immediately released or posting bond at the Seminole County Jail between June 9, 2001 and\nAugust 30, 2005.  A Stipulation of Settlement, approved preliminarily by the Court, defines the class in this\nsettlement as follows:\nAll persons who meet all of the following criteria: (1) erroneously designated during the Class\nPeriod by the John E. Polk Correctional Facility as a \"remand by court\" (RBC) and thereby\nstrip-searched; (2) who were at the time of the RBC designation facing only charges of a\nviolation of a municipal ordinance, a traffic infraction, or misdemeanor charge not involving\nviolence, drugs, or weapons; (3) who did not actually appear before a judge prior to the strip\nsearch; and (4) for whom there was not probable cause for a strip search to check for\ncontraband or weapons. \nThe Settlement Class is estimated to number between six (6) and nineteen (19) individuals and believed to\nconsist primarily of individuals who were arrested while at or near the Seminole County Courthouse.\nWhile the Stipulation of Settlement does make changes to better ensure that persons who have been\nordered released from detention or who have posted bond will not be kept for an unreasonable length\nof time, it does not provide any such persons with monetary damages. \nYou have received this Notice because the parties have determined that you are a possible class member\nbased on their review of the Sheriff’s records and your criminal case file.\nThis Notice is to inform you that a settlement has been proposed in this action and that, as a possible class\nmember, your rights may be affected by the settlement.  This Notice also summarizes the terms and effect\nof the proposed settlement, what you can do to participate in it, how you may obtain money under the\nsettlement and what you must do if you choose to exclude yourself from the class.  \nSUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED TERMS\nA Stipulation of Settlement (“Settlement”) was entered into after intensive negotiations between the parties,\nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION STRIP SEARCH CASE Page 2 of 6\n\nconducted with the assistance of a third party mediator.  The Parties are requesting that the Court approve\nthe Settlement.  \nA.  Parties to the Settlement.\nThe parties to the Settlement are the Plaintiffs named in Parilla, et al. v. Donald Eslinger, et al., United States\nDistrict Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, Case No. 6:05-cv-850-Orl-31KRS filed on behalf\nof themselves and the Settlement Class, and various defendants including the Sheriff of Seminole County,\nthe current and past Directors of the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, and Seminole County.  Counsel for\nthe class are Randall C. Berg, Jr., Esq., Florida Justice Institute, Inc., 4320 Bank of America Tower, 100 S.E.\nSecond Street, Miami, FL 33131-2300 and J. Larry Hanks, Esq., Larry Hanks, P.A., 6500 South Highway 17-\n92, Fern Park, Florida 32730. \nB.  Defendants Do Not Admit Any Liability\nPlaintiffs allege that the acts and/or omissions which are the subject of the claims covered by this action (strip\nsearches) violated various state and federal laws.  Defendants deny all allegations of wrongdoing and deny\nany liability to plaintiffs or to any other class members.  The parties have agreed that, in order to avoid long\nand costly litigation, this controversy should be settled pursuant to the terms of the settlement as described\nin this Notice, subject to the approval of the Court.\nC.  Monetary Terms of Settlement\n1.  Payment to Representative Plaintiffs\nUnder the terms of the settlement, the nine (9) representative plaintiffs will receive a total of\n$360,000.00 to be allocated equally among them.\n2.   Payment to Settlement Class Members Who File Claims and Are Verified\nDefendants have offered to pay as much as $54,000.00 under the terms of the settlement which will\nbe referred to as the Class Fund to verified Settlement Class Members (SCMs). \nThe parties have determined that it is probable that the number of SCMs is not less than six (6) nor\nmore than nineteen (19). Verified SCMs will receive $1,800.00 each, provided there are no more than\nthirty (30) verified SCMs.  If there are less than thirty (30) SCM, any remaining Class Funds will be\nreturned to the Defendants.  \nIn the event there are more than thirty (30) verified SCMs, the settlement stipulation will be\nconsidered null and void, and the lawsuit will be placed back on the trial docket.  However,\nthe Defendants have the option of deciding within fourteen (14) calendar days from the Bar\nDate whether to pay any additional verified SCMs in excess of thirty (30), $1,800.00 each,\nand thereby salvage the Stipulation of Settlement. \n3.  Attorneys’ Fees, Expenses, and Costs\nIn addition to funds reserved for the payment of Class Claims, Class Counsel will receive, subject to\napproval of the Court, a fee of $206,000.00 as attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses.   \nD. Strip Search Policy\nDefendants have revised their strip search policies so that no person arrested on infractions or ordinance\nviolations or misdemeanors not involving violence, drugs, or weapons, without reasonable suspicion that a\nstrip search would be productive of contraband or weapons, will be strip searched prior to first appearance,\nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION STRIP SEARCH CASE Page 3 of 6\n\nunless there is probable cause to do so and prior written authorization for the strip search has been obtained\nfrom a supervising officer. Defendants have further agreed to make no further substantive changes in the strip\nsearch policies for two years without prior approval of class counsel or order of the Court.\nE.   Unreasonable Detention \nDefendants have agreed to hire additional staff, to purchase automated telephonic information\nequipment,  and to change their intake review policies to effectuate more prompt releases of persons once\nordered released by a judge or after they have posted bond.  The Sheriff will report to the court once these\nprocedures are in place.  There will be no monetary settlement for any claim of unreasonable detention\nfor the settlement class.  In the event there are persons currently unknown to class counsel who were\nrelying on this lawsuit and for whom the statute of limitations may have expired, and who would like\nto pursue any monetary claim they may have for being unreasonably detained after being ordered\nreleased or after posting bond, those persons may bring any such claim independent of this action\nwithout the fear of the Defendants defending on the basis of a violation of the statute of limitations\nprovided such action is filed within 90 (Ninety) days of the Effective Date approving this Stipulation\nof Settlement.\nF. Your Options as a Settlement Class Member\n1. Be Bound by, and Participate in the Settlement.\nTo qualify for a payment, you must timely mail in the enclosed Claim Form to Class Counsel.  You\nhave until May 4, 2007, to submit a Claim Form or to opt-out of the settlement.  Mail your completed\nClaim Form to: Randall C. Berg, Jr., Esq., Florida Justice Institute, Inc., 100 S.E. Second Street, 4320\nBank of America Tower, Miami, Florida 33131-2309.\nRemember, if you do not timely submit a Claim Form, you cannot get a payment. If you submit a Claim Form,\nyou will be bound by the settlement and receive money.  If you do not submit a claim form but do not exclude\nyourself from the class (as explained in the next paragraph), you will be bound by the terms of the Settlement\nand dismissal entered in this case, but you will not receive any money.\nBy participating in this Settlement you will be waiving all your rights to all claims up to and including August\n30, 2005, related to strip searches at the John E. Polk Detention Facility, even those of which you are not\npresently aware.  \n2. Exclude Yourself From the Class.\nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class. This is called “excluding”\nyourself.  If you exclude yourself, you can not get a payment and you can not object to the Settlement.\nAny Court orders will not apply to you.  To exclude yourself, you must sign a request for exclusion\nletter that states that you want to be excluded from Parilla, et al. v. Donald Eslinger, et. al., Case No.\n6:05-cv-850-Orl-31KRS, and file it with the Clerk of Court, whose address is United States District\nCourt, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, George C. Young U.S. Courthouse & Federal\nBuilding, 80 North Hughey Avenue, Orlando, Florida 32801.  A copy of your exclusion letter to the\nClerk of the Court must also be mailed and postmarked before May 5, 2007, to:  Randall C. Berg, Jr.,\nEsq, Florida Justice Institute, Inc., 100 S.E. Second Street, 4320 Bank of America Tower, Miami, Florida\n33131-2309.\nIf you do not follow these instructions, you will lose your right to exclude yourself.  If you exclude yourself, you\ncannot get any money from the Settlement of this case and you cannot tell the Court you do not like the\nSettlement (which is called “objecting”). If you exclude yourself, you are no longer part of the class or the\nSettlement. But you can sue or be part of a different lawsuit against the Sheriff of Seminole County and\nSeminole County about the claims in this case.\nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION STRIP SEARCH CASE Page 4 of 6\n\nG. Fairness Hearing and Process for Objections. \nA fairness hearing will be held on May 24, 2007 at 1:00 p.m. at the United States District Court, Middle District\nof Florida, Orlando Division,  George C.

For example, you can say you do not think the Settlement is fair or adequate.

ALL PLAINTIFFS\n83.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated are subjected are short-lived legal violations that are over before they can be challenged in\ncourt because all Plaintiffs are released prior to or at First Appearance (within the first 48 hours of\nincarceration), and are legal violations which are an on-going policy of the Defendants and for which\nmonetary damages alone after-the-fact is not suitable long-term relief.  Similarly, the unreasonably\nlong detention in the Jail after being ordered “immediately released” by a judge or after the posting\nof bond is a short-lived legal violation which is over before it can be challenged in court, and is a\nlegal violation which is an on-going policy of the Defendants and for which monetary damages after-\nthe-fact is not a suitable long-term relief.  There is a reasonable likelihood that Defendants’ policies\nand practices will continue and some Plaintiffs and Plaintiff class members will most certainly be\n-16-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 50     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 17 of 27(cid:10)\nre-arrested in Seminole County, Florida.  Therefore, the illegal polices are capable of repetition but\nevading judicial review if declaratory and injunctive relief is not provided.\n84.  As a result of being subjected to the strip and/or visual body cavity searches complained\nof herein and the unreasonably long detention after being ordered immediately released or after\nposting bond, each of the Plaintiffs (except Lemister for the length of detention) suffered physical,\nmental and emotional distress, invasion of privacy, lost work opportunities, and the violation of due\nprocess of law and federal constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages according to\nproof.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n85.  The named Plaintiffs bring this suit as a class action, pursuant to the provisions of Rule\n23(b)(2) & (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for injunctive and declaratory relief, and\nmonetary damages on behalf of a class of all persons similarly situated.\n86.  There are two Plaintiff classes.  One class consists of all individuals who, within the\napplicable four year statute of limitations and continuing to this date, were subjected by Defendants\nto pre-First Appearance strip and/or visual body cavity searches at the John E. Polk Correctional\nFacility in Seminole County, Florida without Defendants having, and recording in writing, a\nparticularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n87.  The other class consists of all persons unreasonably detained at the Jail for a period in\nexcess of the time necessary to effectuate a release after a judge’s order for immediate release or the\nposting of bond.\n88.  These Plaintiff classes consists of an unknown but large number of individuals,\nnumbering in the thousands, so that joinder of all members is impracticable.\n-17-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 50     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 18 of 27(cid:10)\n89.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants have the ability\nto identify all such similarly situated Plaintiffs who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity\nsearches prior to first appearance without Defendants first having, and recording, a particularized\nreasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n90.   Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants have the\nability to identify all such similarly situated Plaintiffs who were unreasonably held in the Jail long\nafter being ordered by a judge to be immediately released or after paying their bond.\n91.  There are questions of fact common to these classes including, but not limited to: (1)\nwhether Defendants routinely subject all arrested persons to strip and/or visual body cavity searches\nprior to first appearance if they intend such persons to be housed in the John E. Polk Correctional\nFacility; (2) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches prior to First\nAppearance without there being any particularized reasonable suspicion, based on specific or\narticulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband\nin bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a strip and/or visual body cavity search; (3)\nwhether the strip or visual body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the\nsearches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the searches, or whether the strip or visual\nbody cavity search are conducted in areas where they may be observed by persons not participating\nin the searches; and (4) whether persons ordered to be immediately released by a judge or who have\nposted bond are held for an unreasonable time period prior to being released from the Jail.\n92.  There are questions of law common to the class, including, but not limited to: (1) whether\nDefendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity searches on persons prior to their First\nAppearance without particularized reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to\n-18-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 50     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 19 of 27(cid:10)\nbelieve any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband, which would likely\nbe discovered by a strip and/or visual body cavity search; (2) whether strip and/or visual body cavity\nsearches may be conducted in areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in\nthe search without violating Plaintiffs’ federal constitutional rights; (3) whether Defendants’ strip\nand/or visual body cavity search policy and procedure is in accordance with the federal constitution;\nand (4) whether Defendants’ policy and procedure of detaining pre-trial detainees for hours after their\nimmediate release has been ordered by a judge or after their bond has been paid violates Plaintiffs’\nfederal constitutional rights. \n93.  The claims of the representative Plaintiffs are typical of the classes.  Plaintiffs were\nsearched, prior to First Appearance, without reasonable suspicion that a strip and/or visual body\ncavity search would produce drugs, weapons or contraband.  Representative Plaintiffs have the same\ninterests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the other class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims\narose because of Defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual\nbody cavity searches before First Appearance without having a reasonable suspicion that the search\nwould be productive of contraband or weapons. Plaintiffs’ claims (except Lemister) also arose for\nbeing unreasonably detained in the Jail for hours despite an order signed by a judge that the Plaintiffs\nbe immediately released or released after posting bond.  Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same\nlegal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each class member suffered actual damages as a\nresult of being subjected to a visual body cavity search and being unreasonably held for hours after\nbeing ordered immediately released or after posting bond.  The actual damages suffered by\nrepresentative Plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by each class\nmember.\n-19-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 50     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 20 of 27(cid:10)\n94.  The representative Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interest.\nPlaintiffs’ interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. They have a\nstrong personal interest in the outcome of this action and have no conflicts of interest with members\nof the Plaintiff class. The named Plaintiffs were all subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches\nwithout legal justification.  The named Plaintiffs (except Lemister) were all subjected to being\nunreasonably detained for hours in the Jail after being ordered immediately released by a judge or\nafter posting bond.  As long as the policies, practices and customs of the Defendants continue to\npermit dehumanizing invasive strip and visual body cavity searches or the Defendants continue to\nunreasonably detain persons ordered immediately released by a judge or after posting bond, the named\nPlaintiffs (except Lemister), and the class they represent, are and will remain at high risk of being\nsubjected to searches in clear violation of established constitutional rights or being detained\nunreasonably in the Jail after being ordered immediately released by a judge or after posting bond.\n95.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel who specialize in civil rights\nclass action litigation.\n96.  The prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a\nrisk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would\nestablish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.\n97.  The prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a\nrisk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a\npractical matter, substantially impair or impede the ability of the other members of the class to protect\ntheir interests.\n98.  The Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making\n-20-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 50     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 21 of 27(cid:10)\nappropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \n99.  A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and equitable\nadjudication of the controversy between the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\nthereupon allege, that the interests of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution\nof a separate action is low in that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any\naction at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members of the\nclass will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\nthereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims\narise in the same location.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law\nand fact in one form, rather than in multiple courts.\nCOUNT ONE\n(Violation of Fourth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution\non Behalf of Plaintiffs and All Persons Similarly Situated)\n100.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs one (1) through ninety-nine (99) as though fully\nset forth herein.\n101.  The strip and/or visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of named\nDefendants.\n102.  The strip and/or visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated were subjected are short-lived legal violations that are over before they can be challenged in\ncourt because all Plaintiffs are released prior to or at First Appearance (within the first 48 hours of\nincarceration), are legal violations which are an on-going policy of the Defendants and for which\nmonetary damages after-the-fact is not a suitable long-term solution, there is a reasonable likelihood\n-21-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 50     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 22 of 27(cid:10)\nthat the policy and practice will continue and plaintiff class members will be re-arrested, and therefore\nthe illegal policy is capable of repetition but evading review if declaratory and injunctive relief is not\nprovided. \n103.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the\nalleged offenses for which Plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not Plaintiffs\nwere eligible for prompt release and without regard to whether or not Plaintiffs were eligible for\nand/or were released on their own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches complained of herein\nwere performed without Defendants having a reasonable belief that the Plaintiffs so searched\npossessed drugs, weapons or contraband or that there existed facts supporting a particularized\nreasonable suspicion that the searches would produce drugs, weapons or contraband, and those facts\nbeing articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.\n104.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants routinely\nfollow their policy, practice, and custom of requiring pre-First Appearance detainees to strip naked\nand to submit to visual body cavity searches without having a particularized reasonable suspicion that\nthe searches will be productive of drugs, weapons or contraband or weapons. \n105.  Strip and body cavity searches, as alleged in this Complaint, are done as a matter of\nroutine, and are permitted and encouraged, in accordance with the established policies, practices and\ncustoms of the Defendants.\n106.  In searching the Plaintiffs as alleged, staff at the Jail act or have acted in accordance with\nthe policy, practice and custom authorized or permitted by Defendants Tidwell and Diggs. \n107.  The policy, practice and custom of strip or visual body cavity searching all arrestees, as\nauthorized or permitted by Defendants Tidwell and Diggs is attributable to Defendant Eslinger who,\n-22-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 50     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 23 of 27(cid:10)\nif he did not specifically authorize and permit the strip and visual body cavity searches as herein\nalleged, allowed Defendants Tidwell and Diggs to create and implement the policy, practice and\ncustom employed at the Jail.\n108.  The policy, practice and custom of strip or visual body cavity searching all arrestees, as\nauthorized or permitted by Defendants Tidwell, Diggs, and Eslinger, is attributable to Seminole\nCounty, which has delegated the creation of policy, practice and custom at the Jail to Defendant\nEslinger.\n109.  Defendants Tidwell, Diggs, and Eslinger facilitate, encourage, and acquiesce in the\nbehavior of their subordinates, who routinely conduct strip and visual body cavity searches, as alleged\nin this Complaint.\n110.  Individual named Defendants herein are personally responsible for the promulgation and\ncontinuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which Plaintiffs herein and\nall those similarly situated, were subjected to the searches complained of herein.\n111.  Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual body cavity\nsearches complained of herein violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.\nConstitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and directly and proximately\ndamaged Plaintiffs as herein alleged, entitling Plaintiffs to recover damages for said constitutional\nviolations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n-23-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 50     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 24 of 27(cid:10)\nCOUNT TWO\n(Unreasonable Detention After Being Ordered to be Immediately Released is an\nUnreasonable Seizure in Violation of a Liberty Interest Forbidden by the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution on Behalf of Plaintiffs and All Persons Similarly\nSituated)\n112.  Plaintiffs (except Lemister) repeat and reallege paragraphs one (1) through ninety-nine\n(99) as though fully set forth herein.\n113.  The unreasonably long detention in the Jail, after a release order is entered and after Jail\nofficials are made aware of the order, or after the posting of bond, to which Plaintiffs (except\nLemister) and all those similarly situated were subjected were performed pursuant to policies,\npractices, and customs of named Defendants. \n114.  The unreasonable detention to which the Plaintiffs (except Lemister) and all those\nsimilarly situated were subjected are short-lived legal violations that are over before they can be\nchallenged in court, are legal violations which are an on-going policy of the Defendants and for which\nmonetary damages alone after-the-fact is not a suitable long-term solution, there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the policy,  practice, and custom will continue and Plaintiff class members will be re-\narrested, and therefore the illegal policy, practice, and custom is capable of repetition but evading\nreview if declaratory and injunctive relief is not provided. \n115.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants routinely\nfollow their policy, practice, and custom of unreasonable detention after receipt of release orders or\nthe posting of bond.  \n116.  Unreasonably long detentions, as alleged in this Complaint, are done as a matter of\nroutine, and are permitted and encouraged, in accordance with the established policies, practices and\n-24-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 50     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 25 of 27(cid:10)\ncustoms of the Defendants.\n117.  In unreasonably detaining the Plaintiffs as alleged, staff at the Jail act or have acted in\naccordance with the policy, practice and custom authorized or permitted by Defendants Tidwell and\nDiggs. \n118.  The policy, practice and custom of unreasonably long detention, as authorized or\npermitted by Defendants Tidwell and Diggs is attributable to Defendant Eslinger who, if he did not\nspecifically authorize and permit the unreasonably long detention as herein alleged, allowed\nDefendants Tidwell and Diggs to create and implement the policy, practice and custom employed at\nthe Jail.\n119.  The policy, practice and custom of unreasonably long detention, as authorized or\npermitted by Defendants Tidwell, Diggs, and Eslinger, is attributable to Seminole County, which has\ndelegated the creation of policy, practice and custom at the Jail to Defendant Eslinger.\n120.  Defendants Tidwell, Diggs, and Eslinger facilitate, encourage, and acquiesce in the\nbehavior of their subordinates, who routinely unreasonably detain persons ordered to be released or\nafter the payment of bond, as alleged in this Complaint.\n121.  Individual named Defendants herein are personally responsible for the promulgation and\ncontinuation of the unreasonable detention policy, practice, and custom to which Plaintiffs, and all\nthose similarly situated, were subjected.\n122.  Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs regarding the unreasonable detention after\nbeing ordered released or the payment of bond, violated Plaintiffs’ (except Lemister) rights to due\nprocess and a liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment, and directly and proximately\ndamaged Plaintiffs as herein alleged, entitling Plaintiffs (except Lemister) to recover damages and\n-25-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 50     Filed 04/20/2006     Page 26 of 27(cid:10)\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief as requested hereunder for said constitutional violations pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nWherefore, Plaintiffs pray for relief as hereunder appears.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nA.

Polk Correctional Facility in Seminole County and strip-searched\nprior to your first appearance between June 9, 2001 and August 30,\n2005, and are entitled to monetary compensation under a class action\nsettlement.\nIf You Wish to Claim Monetary Compensation, fill out and return by mail\nthe enclosed Claim Form as Soon as Possible but No Later than May 4,\n2007.\nFor more information, please read this notice.\nThere is now pending in the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, an action\nfiled as a class action on behalf of persons allegedly illegally strip searched and unreasonably detained after\nbeing ordered immediately released or posting bond at the Seminole County Jail between June 9, 2001 and\nAugust 30, 2005.  A Stipulation of Settlement, approved preliminarily by the Court, defines the class in this\nsettlement as follows:\nAll persons who meet all of the following criteria: (1) erroneously designated during the Class\nPeriod by the John E. Polk Correctional Facility as a \"remand by court\" (RBC) and thereby\nstrip-searched; (2) who were at the time of the RBC designation facing only charges of a\nviolation of a municipal ordinance, a traffic infraction, or misdemeanor charge not involving\nviolence, drugs, or weapons; (3) who did not actually appear before a judge prior to the strip\nsearch; and (4) for whom there was not probable cause for a strip search to check for\ncontraband or weapons. \nThe Settlement Class is estimated to number between six (6) and nineteen (19) individuals and believed to\nconsist primarily of individuals who were arrested while at or near the Seminole County Courthouse.\nWhile the Stipulation of Settlement does make changes to better ensure that persons who have been\nordered released from detention or who have posted bond will not be kept for an unreasonable length\nof time, it does not provide any such persons with monetary damages. \nYou have received this Notice because the parties have determined that you are a possible class member\nbased on their review of the Sheriff’s records and your criminal case file.\nThis Notice is to inform you that a settlement has been proposed in this action and that, as a possible class\nmember, your rights may be affected by the settlement.  This Notice also summarizes the terms and effect\nof the proposed settlement, what you can do to participate in it, how you may obtain money under the\nsettlement and what you must do if you choose to exclude yourself from the class.  \nSUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED TERMS\nA Stipulation of Settlement (“Settlement”) was entered into after intensive negotiations between the parties,\nconducted with the assistance of a third party mediator.  The Parties are requesting that the Court approve\n-10-\nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION STRIP SEARCH CASE Page 10 of 17\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 73      Filed 01/25/2007     Page 11 of 17\nthe Settlement.  \nA.  Parties to the Settlement.\nThe parties to the Settlement are the Plaintiffs named in Parilla, et al. v. Donald Eslinger, et al., United States\nDistrict Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, Case No. 6:05-cv-850-Orl-31KRS filed on behalf\nof themselves and the Settlement Class, and various defendants including the Sheriff of Seminole County,\nthe current and past Directors of the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, and Seminole County.  Counsel for\nthe class are Randall C. Berg, Jr., Esq., Florida Justice Institute, Inc., 4320 Bank of America Tower, 100 S.E.\nSecond Street, Miami, FL 33131-2300 and J. Larry Hanks, Esq., Larry Hanks, P.A., 6500 South Highway 17-\n92, Fern Park, Florida 32730. \nB.  Defendants Do Not Admit Any Liability\nPlaintiffs allege that the acts and/or omissions which are the subject of the claims covered by this action (strip\nsearches) violated various state and federal laws.  Defendants deny all allegations of wrongdoing and deny\nany liability to plaintiffs or to any other class members.  The parties have agreed that, in order to avoid long\nand costly litigation, this controversy should be settled pursuant to the terms of the settlement as described\nin this Notice, subject to the approval of the Court.\nC.  Monetary Terms of Settlement\n1.  Payment to Representative Plaintiffs\nUnder the terms of the settlement, the nine (9) representative plaintiffs will receive a total of\n$360,000.00 to be allocated equally among them.\n2.   Payment to Settlement Class Members Who File Claims and Are Verified\nDefendants have offered to pay as much as $54,000.00 under the terms of the settlement which will\nbe referred to as the Class Fund to verified Settlement Class Members (SCMs). \nThe parties have determined that it is probable that the number of SCMs is not less than six (6) nor\nmore than nineteen (19). Verified SCMs will receive $1,800.00 each, provided there are no more than\nthirty (30) verified SCMs.  If there are less than thirty (30) SCM, any remaining Class Funds will be\nreturned to the Defendants.  \nIn the event there are more than thirty (30) verified SCMs, the settlement stipulation will be\nconsidered null and void, and the lawsuit will be placed back on the trial docket.  However,\nthe Defendants have the option of deciding within fourteen (14) calendar days from the Bar\nDate whether to pay any additional verified SCMs in excess of thirty (30), $1,800.00 each,\nand thereby salvage the Stipulation of Settlement. \n3.  Attorneys’ Fees, Expenses, and Costs\nIn addition to funds reserved for the payment of Class Claims, Class Counsel will receive, subject to\napproval of the Court, a fee of $206,000.00 as attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses.   \nD. Strip Search Policy\nDefendants have revised their strip search policies so that no person arrested on infractions or ordinance\n-11-\nNOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION STRIP SEARCH CASE Page 11 of 17\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 73      Filed 01/25/2007     Page 12 of 17\nviolations or misdemeanors not involving violence, drugs, or weapons, without reasonable suspicion that a\nstrip search would be productive of contraband or weapons, will be strip searched prior to first appearance,\nunless there is probable cause to do so and prior written authorization for the strip search has been obtained\nfrom a supervising officer. Defendants have further agreed to make no further substantive changes in the strip\nsearch policies for two years without prior approval of class counsel or order of the Court.\nE.   Unreasonable Detention \nDefendants have agreed to hire additional staff, to purchase automated telephonic information\nequipment, and to change their intake review policies to effectuate more prompt releases of persons once\nordered released by a judge or after they have posted bond.  The Sheriff will report to the court once these\nprocedures are in place.  There will be no monetary settlement for any claim of unreasonable detention\nfor the settlement class.  In the event there are persons currently unknown to class counsel who were\nrelying on this lawsuit and for whom the statute of limitations may have expired, and who would like\nto pursue any monetary claim they may have for being unreasonably detained after being ordered\nreleased or after posting bond, those persons may bring any such claim independent of this action\nwithout the fear of the Defendants defending on the basis of a violation of the statute of limitations\nprovided such action is filed within 90 (Ninety) days of the Effective Date approving this Stipulation\nof Settlement.\nF. Your Options as a Settlement Class Member\n1. Be Bound by, and Participate in the Settlement.\nTo qualify for a payment, you must timely mail in the enclosed Claim Form to Class Counsel.  You\nhave until May 4, 2007, to submit a Claim Form or to opt-out of the settlement.  Mail your completed\nClaim Form to: Randall C. Berg, Jr., Esq., Florida Justice Institute, Inc., 100 S.E. Second Street, 4320\nBank of America Tower, Miami, Florida 33131-2309.\nRemember, if you do not timely submit a Claim Form, you cannot get a payment. If you submit a Claim Form,\nyou will be bound by the settlement and receive money.  If you do not submit a claim form but do not exclude\nyourself from the class (as explained in the next paragraph), you will be bound by the terms of the Settlement\nand dismissal entered in this case, but you will not receive any money.\nBy participating in this Settlement you will be waiving all your rights to all claims up to and including August\n30, 2005, related to strip searches at the John E. Polk Detention Facility, even those of which you are not\npresently aware.  \n2. Exclude Yourself From the Class.\nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class. This is called “excluding”\nyourself.  If you exclude yourself, you can not get a payment and you can not object to the Settlement.\nAny Court orders will not apply to you.  To exclude yourself, you must sign a request for exclusion\nletter that states that you want to be excluded from Parilla, et al. v. Donald Eslinger, et. al., Case No.\n6:05-cv-850-Orl-31KRS, and file it with the Clerk of Court, whose address is United States District\nCourt, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, George C. Young U.S. Courthouse & Federal\nBuilding, 80 North Hughey Avenue, Orlando, Florida 32801.  A copy of your exclusion letter to the\nClerk of the Court must also be mailed and postmarked before May 5, 2007, to:  Randall C. Berg, Jr.,\nEsq, Florida Justice Institute, Inc., 100 S.E.

If you exclude yourself, you\ncannot get any money from the Settlement of this case and you cannot tell the Court you do not like the\nSettlement (which is called “objecting”). If you exclude yourself, you are no longer part of the class or the\nSettlement. But you can sue or be part of a different lawsuit against the Sheriff of Seminole County and\nSeminole County about the claims in this case.\nG. Fairness Hearing and Process for Objections. \nA fairness hearing will be held on May 24, 2007 at 1:00 p.m. at the United States District Court, Middle District\nof Florida, Orlando Division,  George C. Young U.S. Courthouse & Federal Building, 80 North Hughey Avenue,\nOrlando, Florida 32801 in Courtroom 3.  If you are a class member and do not exclude yourself, you can tell\nthe Court you do not like the Settlement or some part of it at this hearing. This is called objecting to the\nSettlement.  For example, you can say you do not think the Settlement is fair or adequate.  The Court will\nconsider your views. \nTo object, you must send a letter to the court that contains all of the following: \n1. The name and title of the lawsuit, Parilla, et al. v.

The matters considered at such future hearings may include, but shall not be limited to, further\nconsideration of the fairness and adequacy of the proposed settlement, the determination of the settlement\nof  individual  claims  filed  by  class  members,  consideration  of  the  request  for  attorneys’  fees  and\nreimbursement of costs and expenses to class counsel, and the form and entry of the final judgment of\ndismissal in the event the proposed settlement is approved by the court.\nIndividually, or through counsel, any class member has the right to object to the proposed Settlement as a\nwhole, to the amount of attorneys’ fees and costs of Class Counsel, or to any portion of either.  ANY SUCH\nOBJECTIONS MUST BE FILED IN WRITING ON OR BEFORE MAY 4, 2007, IN THE UNITED STATES\nDISTRICT COURT, MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, ORLANDO DIVISION,  GEORGE C.

Plaintiffs’ class was represented by Class Counsel\nRandall  C. Berg, Jr., of the Florida Justice Institute, Inc., and J.

On January 25, 2007 this court entered its Order preliminarily approving settlement of the\nabove captioned class action.  Since the entry of the Court’s preliminary Order, in accordance with\nthe Stipulation of Settlement as proved to the satisfaction of the Court, the requisite notice of\nSettlement, with opt-out and objection information, was published in the Orlando Sentinel (February\n12, 2007 and February 19, 2007) and on the web at www.FloridaJusticeInstitute.com with Questions\nand Answers, the Stipulation of Settlement, Class Notice and Claims Forms; and notice of the\nSettlement and approved claim forms were posted by First Class U.S. Mail to the last known address\nof each person in groups one and two of the settlement class.  Both the published notice and the\nmailed notice specified that claim forms had to be delivered to Plaintiffs’ Counsel at the Florida\nJustice Institute, post marked not later than May 4, 2007.\n2. Both the published and mailed notices specified that any person who chose to object to the\nSettlement, either personally or through counsel, and desired to appear at the Fairness Hearing was\nrequired to submit a Notice of Intention to Appear, together with written arguments in support of any\nobjection, by May  4, 2007.  No written objections were received by the Court.  Furthermore,\nalthough opportunity was given by the court to voice objections at the time of the Fairness Hearing,\nno objections were stated by any member of the class or representative of any such class member.\nThe notice also specified that any person who chose to exclude themselves from the class may do\nso by signing a request for exclusion that must be filed with the Clerk of the Court by May 5, 2007.\nRequests for exclusion were received by the clerk from BONNIE RETALIC, A.K.A. BONNIE\nKOZIMOR (DE 77), ASIER MURUA (DE 78), and  DR. LINDA TAVERNIER-ALMADA (DE\n79).\n3. The Court is satisfied from all of the memoranda of law, declarations, and exhibits\nsubmitted to the Court, that the Stipulation of Settlement is, and the Court now finds, is fair and\n-2-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 89      Filed 05/30/2007     Page 3 of 5\nfinally approves it as such. The Stipulation of Settlement is incorporated herein by this reference as\nif set out in full.\n4. The members of the settlement class include the following:\na.  Representative Class Members (RCMs): RONALD PARILLA, ALDA RUGG,\nTHE ESTATE OF BILLY CATES, THERESA DECLUE, AILEEN NUNEZ,\nDAVID  W.  ROBERTS,  KIM  LEMISTER,  SHANE  BRADLEY,  and\nFRANTARSHIA STAFFORD.\nb. Verified Settlement Class Members (VSCMs) include: DARREN GREEN,\nBRIAN STAMEN, MICAH STEPHENS, and ROBERT BROCK.\n5.  Claim forms were timely submitted by potential class members, reviewed, and were \nfound to be unverified claims.  Unverified Class Members (UVMs) include: DAVID MORTON,\nWILLIE WRIGHT, JUDY HAGNER, RESHARD NOBLE, NICHOLAS BENNETTO, and JOHN\nWARREN.\n6. Claim forms were untimely submitted by potential class members and were excluded from\nthe verification process. The time-barred claims were submitted by PHILLIP SCOTT HALL and\nELIZABETH SCOTT.\n7.  On May 24, 2007, JUDY HAGNER did appear at the Fairness Hearing and was heard by\nthe Court.  After a review of her claim form, jail records and correspondence, it was determined that\nMs. HAGNER was not a verified class member.   Ms. HAGNER was informed as to the Court’s\nreasoning for not allowing her claim, and what remedies she still has if she wishes to file a separate\naction.\n8.  Persons who previously commenced civil litigation challenging the legality of any strip\nsearch at the John E. Polk Correctional Facility during the class period and have prevailed, settled\nor had their complaints denied on their merits, and persons who have given timely notice of their\nelection to be excluded from the settlement class are not included in the settlement class.\n9.  With the exception of any individuals who submitted timely requests to the Court to opt-\n-3-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 89      Filed 05/30/2007     Page 4 of 5\nout of the Stipulation of Settlement, all claims and complaints of the named representative plaintiffs,\ntogether with all persons in the settlement class, are now dismissed with prejudice as to all of the\nRelated Persons defined to include the defendants and their predecessors, successors, and/or assigns,\ntogether with past, present and future officials, employees, representatives, attorneys and/or agents\nof the John E. Polk Correctional Facility.  Claims and complaints of such persons are now forever\nbarred, and all settlement class members are enjoined from asserting against any Released Person\nor persons any and all claims which the settlement class members had, have, or may have in the\nfuture arising out of the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint.\n10.  Each Released Person is released from the claims which any settlement class member\nhas had or may in the future have against any such Released Person arising out of the facts in the\nComplaint.\n11.  This Court explicitly finds that the Stipulation of Settlement, which is now made final\nby this Judgment, was entered into in good faith, is reasonable, fair and adequate, and is in the best\ninterest of the Class.  The Court expressly approves payment to Class Counsel the Law Office of\nLarry Hanks, P.A.  and the Florida Justice Institute, Inc., of the amount of Two Hundred and Six\nThousand Dollars ( $206,000) as and for attorneys’ fees for the representation of the settlement class\nmembers herein, to be paid as provided in the Stipulation of Settlement.\n12.  The Court further explicitly approves payment from the payment fund of a total of Three\nHundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars ($360,000) to be divided among the Representative Class\nMembers (RCMs), as specified in the Stipulation of Settlement.  The Court finds the amount is fair\nand adequate in view of the damages suffered by the representative plaintiffs and the efforts they\nexpended in litigating this case in the several years since the underlying events occurred which gave\nrise to the filing of the Complaint.\n13.  Pursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement, defendants have allocated up to Fifty-Four\nThousand Dollars ($54,000) to pay verified Settlement Class Members (SCMs).  Claims have been\nsubmitted to and, in accordance with the claims processing procedure specified in the Stipulation\n-4-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 89      Filed 05/30/2007     Page 5 of 5\nof Settlement, will be paid eighteen hundred dollars each ($1, 800.00 each) to the four (4) VSCM\nset forth above in ¶ 4.b. as soon as practicable following the effective date of this Judgment, meaning\nthe date it is entered and becomes final.  The Judgment will be deemed final only upon the expiration\nof the time to appeal or, if a Notice of Appeal is filed, upon exhaustion of all appeals and petitions\nfor a Writ of Certiorari.\n14.  The Court reserves continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the parties in this action,\nincluding defendants and all settlement class members, to administer, supervise, and construe and\nenforce the settlement in accordance with the terms for the mutual benefit of all of the parties.\n15.  It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the Complaint in this action be dismissed\nwith prejudice and that Judgment be and the same hereby is entered pursuant to the terms of this\nOrder.\nDONE AND ORDERED in chambers in Orlando, Florida, Orange County this May 30, 2007.\nCopies to all counsel of record\n-5-",

Plaintiff Declue and the others were taken into custody, handcuffed, and moved to\nanother location in the courthouse where leg-irons and waist chains were applied.\n40. At the courthouse, Plaintiff Declue’s personal belongings were taken.

Polk Correctional\nFacility.\n41. At the jail, Plaintiff Declue was subjected to a strip or visual body cavity search. She\nwas required to remove all her clothing, squat and spread her rectum.\n42. At the conclusion of the search, PlaintiffDeclue was required to dress in a jail uniform.\n43. An Order to release Plaintiff Declue from custody was filed by the clerk of the circuit\ncourt at 2:22 pm and faxed to the jail at 3:48 pm. Despite this Order, jail staff continued the booking\nprocess. Plaintiff Declue was not released from custody until approximately 9:00 pm.\n44. Prior to December 3, 2004, Plaintiff Declue had never been in a jail.\n45. Plaintiff Declue is a 29 year old Administrative Assistant for a major employer in the\nOrlando area. She was humiliated and embarrassed by being subjected to the aforementioned strip\nand visual body cavity search and by being required to stand, naked, for any passerby to observe.\nShe suffered mental and emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions\nin depriving her of rights secured to her by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution.\nE. AILEEN NUNEZ\n46. On December 3, 2004, Plaintiff Nunez went to the Seminole County Courthouse in\nSanford, Florida for a non-moving traffic violation. She was told to report to courtroom lB. In the\ncourtroom, a court employee told PlaintiffNunez to sit down until her name was called.\n47. Approximately two hours later the judge in courtroom 1B suggested that there were too\nmany people in his courtroom and called the names of people still on his docket. The eleven people\nnot named, which included PlaintiffNunez, were told by the judge to go to courtroom 1A next door.\n-8-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS Document 1 Filed 06/09/2005 Page 9 of 19\nShortly after PlaintiffNunez arrived at courtroom 1 A, the room began filling with Deputy Sheriffs.\nThen, one of the Deputies announced to the crowd that the judge in courtroom 1A, Judge John R.\nSloop, had signed warrants for their arrests for failure to appear.\n48. At the Courthouse, PlaintiffNunez was placed in restraints and then taken to the jail.\n49. Upon arrival at the Jail, PlaintiffNtmez was subjected to a strip or visual body cavity\nsearch. She was forced to squat and cough, and the officers ran their fingers through her hair. The\nofficers took her bra with under wire. After eight hours in custody, she was released.\n50. PlaintiffNunez is a 25 year old bank employee. She was humiliated and embarrassed\nby being subjected to the aforementioned strip and visual body cavity search and by being required\nto stand, naked, for any passerby to observe. She suffered mental and emotional distress as a direct\nand proximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving her of rights secured to her by the Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nF. DAVID W. ROBERTS\n51. On December 3, 2004, Plaintiff Roberts went to the Seminole County Courthouse in\nSanford, Florida, for a non-moving traffic violation. He went to courtroom 1B, where a court\nemployee told Plaintiff Roberts to sit down until his name was called.\n52. Approximately two hours later the judge in courtroom 1B suggested that there were too\nmany people in his courtroom and called the names of people still on his docket. The people not\nnamed, which included Plaintiff Roberts, were told by the judge to go to courtroom 1A next door.\nShortly after PlaintiffRoberts arrived at courtroom 1A, the room began filling with Deputy Sheriffs.\nThen, one of the Deputies announced to the crowd that the judge in courtroom 1A, Judge John R.\nSloop, had signed warrants for their arrests for failure to appear.\n-9-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS Document 1 Filed 06/09/2005 Page 10 of 19\n53. Plaintiff Roberts and the others were taken into custody, handcuffed, and moved to\nanother location in the courthouse where leg-irons and waist chains were applied.\n54. At the courthouse, Plaintiff’s belt, shoelaces and personal belongings were taken, he was\nsubjected to a pat down search, and then placed in a van and transported to the John E. Polk\nCorrectional Facility.\n55. At the jail, Plaintiff Roberts was subjected to a strip or visual body cavity search.\n56. Plaintiff Roberts is a 39 year old employee of a local construction firm. He was\nhumiliated and embarrassed by being subjected to the aforementioned strip and visual body cavity\nsearch and by being required to stand, naked, for any passerby to observe. He suffered mental and\nemotional distress as a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving him of rights\nsecured to him by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nG. FRANTARSHIA STAFFORD\n57. On December 3, 2004, Stafford appeared at the Seminole County Courthouse in response\nto traffic tickets for no insurance and no registration. She was initially directed to the wrong\ncourtroom and then arrested for \"failure to appear\" after being directed to courtroom 1B at the\nSeminole County Courthouse. At the Courthouse, she was handcuffed, forced to take off her shoes\nand put on jailhouse slippers, and put in belly chains.\n58. Upon arrival at the Jail, Plaintiff Stafford was subjected to a strip or visual body cavity\nsearch. She was forced to squat, bend over, and cough, and the officers ran their fingers through her\nhair. The officers took her bra with under wire. After eight hours in custody, she was released.\n59. Although arrested before, Plaintiff Stafford was never subjected to a strip search prior\nto December 3, 2004.\n-10-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS Document 1 Filed 06/09/2005 Page 11 of 19\n60. Plaintiff Stafford was humiliated and embarrassed by being subjected to the\naforementioned strip and visual body cavity search and by being required to stand, naked, for any\npasserby to observe. She suffered mental and emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of\nDefendants’ actions in depriving her of rights secured to her by the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.\ntt. ALL PLAINTIFFS\n61. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated are subjected are short-lived legal violations that are over before they can be challenged in\ncourt because all plaintiffs are released prior to or at first appearance (within the first 48 hours of\nincarceration), and are legal violations which are an on-going policy of the Defendants and for which\nmonetary damages after-the-fact is not suitable long-term relief. There is a reasonable likelihood that\nDefendants’ policy and practice will continue and some plaintiff class members will most certainly\nbe re-arrested in Seminole County, Florida. Therefore the illegal policy is capable of repetition but\nevading judicial review if declaratory and injunctive relief is not provided.\n62. As a result of being subjected to the strip and visual body cavity searches complained\nof herein, each of the Plaintiffs suffered physical, mental and emotional distress, invasion of privacy,\nand the violation of due process of law and federal constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover\ndamages according to proof.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n63. The named Plaintiffs bring this suit as a class action, pursuant to the provisions of Rule\n23(b)(2) & (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for injunctive and declaratory relief, and\nmonetary damages on behalf of a class of all persons similarly situated.\n-11-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS Document 1 Filed 06/09/2005 Page 12 of 19\n64. The class of Plaintiffsconsists of all individuals who, during the period beginning four\n(4) years before the date this action is filed, were taken to the jail and who were subjected by\nDefendants to pre-first appearance strip and/or visual body cavity searches at the John E. Polk\nCorrectional Facility without Defendants having, and recording in writing, a particularized\nreasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n65. The Plaintiff class consists of an unknown but large number of individuals, numbering\nin the thousands, so that joinder of all members is impracticable.\n66. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants have the\nability to identify all such similarly situated Plaintiffs who were subjected to strip and/or visual body\ncavity searches prior to first appearance without Defendants first having, and recording, a\nparticularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n67. There are questions of fact common to the class including, but not limited to: (1) where\nDefendants routinely subject all arrested persons to strip or visual body cavity searches prior to first\nappearance if they intend such persons to be housed in the John E. Polk Correctional Facility; (2)\nwhether persons are subjected to strip or visual body cavity searches prior to first appearance without\nthere being any particularized reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe\nany particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which\ncould be detected by means of a strip or visual body cavity search; (3) whether the strip or visual\nbody cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by\npersons not participating in the searches, or whether the strip or visual body cavity search are\nconducted in areas where they may be observed by persons not participating in the searches; and (4)\nwhether the strip or visual body cavity searches are reasonably related to Defendants’ penalogical\n-12-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS Document 1 Filed 06/09/2005 Page 13 of 19\ninterest to maintain the security of the jail whether or not there are less intrusive methods for\nprotecting any such interest.\n68. There are questions of law common to the class, including, but not limited to: (1)\nwhether Defendants may perform strip or visual body cavity searches on persons prior to their first\nappearance without particularized reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to\nbelieve any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband, which would likely\nbe discovered by a strip or visual body cavity search; (2) whether Defendants may perform strip or\nvisual body cavity searches on persons without first reasonably relating the use of the strip search\nto Defendants’ penalogical interest to maintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a\nless intrusive method to protect that interest; (3) whether strip or visual body cavity searches may\nbe conducted in areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search\nwithout violating Plaintiff’s federal constitutional rights; and (4) whether or not Defendants’ strip\nsearch policy and procedure is in accordance with the federal constitution.\n69. The claims of the representative Plaintiffs are typical of the class. Plaintiffs were\nsearched, prior to first appearance, without reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity\nsearch would produce drugs, weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any such\nsuspicion being articulated in a supervisor approved document). Representative Plaintiffs have the\nsame interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the other class members. Plaintiffs’\nclaims arose because of Defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and\nvisual body cavity searches before first appearance without having, and recording in writing, a\nreasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons. Plaintiffs’\nclaims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members. Each class\n-13-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS Document 1 Filed 06/09/2005 Page 14 of 19\nmember suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity search. The\nactual damages suffered by representative Plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the actual\ndamages suffered by each class member.\n70. The representative Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interest.\nPlaintiffs’ interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. They have\na strong personal interest in the outcome of this action and have no conflicts of interest with\nmembers of the Plaintiff class. The named Plaintiffs were all subjected to strip and visual body\ncavity searches without legal justification. As long as the policies, practices and customs of the\nDefendants continue to permit dehumanizing invasive strip and visual body cavity searches, the\nnamed Plaintiffs, and the class they represent, are and will remain at high risk of being subjected to\nsearches in clear violation of established constitutional rights.\n71. The named Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel who specialize in civil\nrights litigation.\n72. The prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create\na risk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class\nwould establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.\n73. The prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create\na risk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as\na practical matter, substantially impair or impede the ability of the other members of the class to\nprotect their interests.\n74. The Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making\nappropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.\n-14-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS Document 1 Filed 06/09/2005 Page 15 of 19\n75. A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and equitable\nadjudication of the controversy between the parties. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\nthereupon allege, that the interests of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution\nof a separate action is low in that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any\naction at all. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members of the\nclass will not be able to find counsel to represent them. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\nthereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the\nclaims arise in the same location. It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common\nquestions of law and fact in one form, rather than in multiple courts.\nCAUSE OF ACTION\n76. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of named\nDefendants.\n77. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated were subjected are short-lived legal violations that are over before they can be challenged\nin court because all plaintiffs are released prior to or at first appearance (within the first 48 hours of\nincarceration), are legal violations which are an on-going policy of the Defendants and for which\nmonetary damages after-the-fact is not a suitable long-term solution, there is a reasonable likelihood\nthat the policy and practice will continue and plaintiff class members will be re-arrested, and\ntherefore the illegal policy is capable of repetition but evading review if declaratory and injunctive\nrelief is not provided.\n78. The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the\n-15-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS Document 1 Filed 06/09/2005 Page 16 of 19\nalleged offenses for which Plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not Plaintiffs\nwere eligible for prompt release and without regard to whether or not Plaintiffs were eligible for\nand/or were released on their own recognizance. Furthermore, the searches complained of herein\nwere performed without Defendants having a reasonable belief that the Plaintiffs so searched\npossessed weapons or contraband or that there existed facts supporting a particularized reasonable\nsuspicion that the searches would produce contraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded\nin a supervisor-approved document.\n79. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants routinely\nfollow their policy, practice, and custom of requiring pre-first appearance detainees to strip naked\nand to submit to visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a\nparticularized reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of contraband or weapons.\n80. Strip and body cavity searches, as alleged in this Complaint, are done as a matter of\nroutine, and are permitted and encouraged, in accordance with the established policies, practices and\ncustoms of the Defendants.\n81. In searching the Plaintiffs as alleged, staff at the jail act or have acted in accordance with\nthe policy, practice and customs authorized or permitted by Defendants Diggs and Tidwell.\n82. The policy, practice and custom of strip or visual body cavity searching all arrestees, as\nauthorized or permitted by Defendants Tidwell and Diggs is attributable to Defendant Eslinger who,\nif he did not specifically authorize and permit the strip and visual body cavity searches as herein\nalleged, allowed Defendants Tidwell and Diggs to create and implement the policy, practice and\ncustoms employed at the Jail.\n83. The policy, practice and custom of strip or visual body cavity searching all arrestees, as\n-16-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS Document 1 Filed 06/09/2005 Page 17 of 19\nauthorized or permitted by Defendants Tidwell, Diggs, and Eslinger, is attributable to Seminole\nCounty, which has delegated the creation of policy, practice and custom at the Jail to Defendant\nEslinger.\n84. Defendants Tidwell, Diggs, and Eslinger facilitate, encourage, and acquiesce in the\nbehavior of their subordinates, who routinely conduct strip and visual body cavity searches, as\nalleged in this Complaint.\n85. Individual named Defendants herein are personally responsible for the promulgation and\ncontinuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which Plaintiffs herein and\nall those similarly situated, were subjected to the searches complained of herein.\n86. Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual body cavity\nsearches complained of herein violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.\nConstitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and violated said Plaintiffs’ rights\nto due process and privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, and directly and proximately damaged\nPlaintiffs as herein alleged, entitling Plaintiffs to recover damages for said constitutional violation\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nWherefore, Plaintiffs pray for relief as hereunder appears.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nA. For declaratory and injunctive relief declaring illegal and enjoining, preliminarily and\npermanently, Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs of subjecting prcrfirst appearance\ndetainees to strip and visual body cavity searches without having and recording in writing a\nreasonable suspicion that such searches would bc productive of contraband or weapons;\nB.

After\npassing through the metal detector he asked Seminole County Deputy Sheriff Carraday for directions\nto “courtroom F” as noted on his ticket. Carraday told Plaintiff Parilla that there was no “courtroom\nF” and directed him to “courtroom 1B,” pointing towards the courtroom as they spoke.  In the\ncourtroom, a court employee told Plaintiff Parilla to sit down until his name was called.\n21.  Approximately two hours later, the judge in “courtroom 1B” suggested that there were\ntoo many people in his courtroom and called the names of people still on his docket. The people not\n-4-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 5 of 27(cid:10)\nnamed, which included Plaintiff Parilla, were told by the judge to go to “courtroom 1A” next door.\nShortly after Plaintiff Parilla arrived at “courtroom 1A,” the room began filling with Deputy Sheriffs.\nThen, one of the Deputies announced to the crowd that the judge in “courtroom 1A,” Judge John R.\nSloop, had signed warrants for their arrests for failure to appear.\n22.  Plaintiff Parilla and the others were taken into custody, handcuffed, and moved to\nanother location in the courthouse where leg-irons and waist chains were applied.\n23.

At the Jail, Plaintiff Parilla was subjected to a strip or visual body cavity search.  He was\nrequired to remove all his clothing, lift his private parts and spread his rectum.\n25.  The correctional officer who performed the search did not have the prior written\nauthorization of a supervising officer on duty. The search was performed without their being,\nrecorded in writing or otherwise, a particularized reasonable suspicion that the search would be\nproductive of contraband or weapons. \n26.  At the conclusion of the search, Plaintiff Parilla was allowed to dress in his civilian\nclothing.\n27.  An Order signed by a judge that Plaintiff Parilla be immediately released from custody\nwas filed by the clerk of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida at 2:22 p.m. and faxed to\nthe Jail at 3:48 p.m. on December 3, 2004.

He\nwas humiliated and embarrassed by being subjected to the aforementioned strip and visual body\ncavity search and by being required to stand naked for any passerby to observe.  He suffered mental\nand emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving him of\nrights secured to him by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nB.

He was\nhumiliated and embarrassed by being subjected to the aforementioned strip and visual body cavity\nsearch and by being required to stand naked for any passerby to observe. By being unreasonably held\nwithout justification over 5 hours after being ordered “immediately released,” Plaintiff Roberts was\nunable to engage in work and otherwise engage in his normal everyday activities.  He suffered\nmental and emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving\nhim of rights secured to him by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n-12-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 13 of 27(cid:10)\nG. KIM LEMISTER\n67.  On September 13, 2002, Plaintiff Lemister was arrested at 1:00 a.m. for driving while\nintoxicated.  She was on one crutch as a result of a knee injury.  She was taken to the Jail to be\nbooked.  She was told by the female correctional officer on duty to go into the bathroom, take off\nher clothes and take a shower.  When Plaintiff Lemister finished showering, she was told to go back\ninto the shower and thoroughly wash her hair.  After the shower, she was told to spread her legs and\nwas given a visual body cavity search.  The correctional officer took her bra because it contained an\nunderwire.  Her head was then sprayed for lice as were all other body areas containing hair.  She was\nnot given a towel to dry.  She was told to dress in a jail uniform and taken to a single cell in the\ninfirmary area because she possessed a crutch.\n68.  On information and belief, the female correctional officer who performed the search did\nnot have the prior written authorization of a supervising officer on duty.  The search was performed\nwithout there being, recorded in writing or otherwise, a particularized reasonable suspicion that the\nsearch would be productive of contraband or weapons. \n69. Plaintiff Lemister’s boyfriend came to the Jail and paid her bond at 2:00 a.m.  She was\nreleased the next morning at approximately some time between 10:30 to 11:00 a.m.\n70.  Plaintiff is a 32 year old employee of a bank.  She was humiliated and embarassed by\nbeing subjected to the aforementioned strip and/or visual body cavity search.  She has suffered\nmental and emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions in depriving\nher of rights secured to her by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.\n-13-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 14 of 27(cid:10)\nH.   FRANTARSHIA STAFFORD\n71.  On December 3, 2004, Plaintiff Stafford appeared at the Seminole County Courthouse\nin response to traffic tickets for no insurance and no registration.  She was initially directed to the\nwrong courtroom and then arrested for “failure to appear” after being directed to “courtroom 1B”\nat the Seminole County Courthouse.  At the Courthouse, she was handcuffed, forced to take off her\nshoes and put on jailhouse slippers, and put in belly chains.\n72.  Upon arrival at the Jail, Plaintiff Stafford was subjected to a strip or visual body cavity\nsearch by a correctional officer.  She was forced to squat, bend over, and cough and officers ran their\nfingers through her hair.  The correctional officer took her bra because it had an underwire.   At 2:22\np.m., an order that Plaintiff Stafford (formerly Coleman) be “immediately released from custody\nROR [release on own recognizance]” was filed in the Clerk’s Office, and faxed to Defendants at 3:50\np.m.  However, Plaintiff Stafford was not released until approximately 9:00 p.m.\n73.  The correctional officer who performed the strip search did not have the prior written\nauthorization of a supervising officer on duty. Plaintiff Stafford had never been subjected to a strip\nsearch prior to December 3, 2004.  The search was performed without there being, recorded in\nwriting or otherwise, a particularized reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of\ncontraband or weapons. \n74.  She was humiliated and embarrassed by being subjected to the aforementioned strip\nand/or visual body cavity search and by being required to stand naked for any passerby to observe.\nBy being unreasonably held without justification over 5 hours after being ordered “immediately\nreleased,” Plaintiff Stafford was unable to engage in work and otherwise engage in her normal\neveryday activities.  She suffered mental and emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of\n-14-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 15 of 27(cid:10)\nDefendants’ actions in depriving her of rights secured to her by the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.\nI.  ALL PLAINTIFFS\n75.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated are subjected are short-lived legal violations that are over before they can be challenged in\ncourt because all Plaintiffs are released prior to or at First Appearance (within the first 48 hours of\nincarceration), and are legal violations which are an on-going policy of the Defendants and for which\nmonetary damages alone after-the-fact is not suitable long-term relief.  Similarly, the unreasonably\nlong detention in the Jail after being ordered “immediately released” by a judge or after the posting\nof bond is a short-lived legal violation which is over before it can be challenged in court, and is a\nlegal violation which is an on-going policy of the Defendants and for which monetary damages after-\nthe-fact is not a suitable long-term relief.  There is a reasonable likelihood that Defendants’ policies\nand practices will continue and some Plaintiffs and Plaintiff class members will most certainly be\nre-arrested in Seminole County, Florida.  Therefore, the illegal polices are capable of repetition but\nevading judicial review if declaratory and injunctive relief is not provided.\n76.  As a result of being subjected to the strip and/or visual body cavity searches complained\nof herein and the unreasonably long detention after being ordered immediately released or after\nposting bond, each of the Plaintiffs (except Lemister for the length of detention) suffered physical,\nmental and emotional distress, invasion of privacy, lost work opportunities, and the violation of due\nprocess of law and federal constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages according to\nproof.\n-15-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 16 of 27(cid:10)\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n77.  The named Plaintiffs bring this suit as a class action, pursuant to the provisions of Rule\n23(b)(2) & (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for injunctive and declaratory relief, and\nmonetary damages on behalf of a class of all persons similarly situated.\n78.  There are two Plaintiff classes.  One class consists of all individuals who, within the\napplicable four year statute of limitations and continuing to this date, were subjected by Defendants\nto pre-First Appearance strip and/or visual body cavity searches at the John E. Polk Correctional\nFacility in Seminole County, Florida without Defendants having, and recording in writing, a\nparticularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons,\nand without the officer performing the strip and/or visual body cavity search having obtained the\nprior written authorization of a supervising officer on duty.\n79.  The other class consists of all persons unreasonably detained at the Jail for a period in\nexcess of the time necessary to effectuate a release after a judge’s order for immediate release or the\nposting of bond.\n80.  These Plaintiff classes consists of an unknown but large number of individuals,\nnumbering in the thousands, so that joinder of all members is impracticable.\n81.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants have the\nability to identify all such similarly situated Plaintiffs who were subjected to strip and/or visual body\ncavity  searches  prior  to  first  appearance  without  Defendants  first  having,  and  recording,  a\nparticularized reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons,\nand without the officer performing the strip and/or visual body cavity search having obtained the\nprior written authorization of a supervising officer on duty. \n-16-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 17 of 27(cid:10)\n82.   Plaintiffs are also informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants have the\nability to identify all such similarly situated Plaintiffs who were unreasonably held in the Jail long\nafter being ordered by a judge to be immediately released or after paying their bond.\n83.  There are questions of fact common to these classes including, but not limited to: (1)\nwhether Defendants routinely subject all arrested persons to strip and/or visual body cavity searches\nprior to first appearance if they intend such persons to be housed in the John E. Polk Correctional\nFacility; (2) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches prior to First\nAppearance without there being any particularized reasonable suspicion, based on specific or\narticulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband\nin bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a strip and/or visual body cavity search; (3)\nwhether the strip or visual body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the\nsearches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the searches, or whether the strip or\nvisual body cavity search are conducted in areas where they may be observed by persons not\nparticipating in the searches; (4) whether the strip or visual body cavity searches are conducted by\nofficers who do not obtain prior written authorization of a supervising officer on duty; and (5)\nwhether persons ordered to be immediately released by a judge or who have posted bond are held\nfor an unreasonable time period prior to being released from the Jail.\n84.  There are questions of law common to the class, including, but not limited to: (1)\nwhether Defendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity searches on persons prior to their\nFirst Appearance without particularized reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts,\nto believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons and/or contraband, which would\nlikely be discovered by a strip and/or visual body cavity search; (2) whether strip and/or visual body\n-17-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 18 of 27(cid:10)\ncavity searches may be conducted in areas where the search can be observed by people not\nparticipating in the search without violating Plaintiffs’ federal constitutional rights; (3) whether\nDefendants’ strip and/or visual body cavity search policy and procedure is in accordance with the\nfederal constitution; (4) whether Defendants’ strip search policy and procedure is in accordance with\nFla. Stat. § 901.211; and (5) whether Defendants’ policy and procedure of detaining pre-trial\ndetainees for hours after their immediate release has been ordered by a judge or after their bond has\nbeen paid violates Plaintiffs’ federal constitutional rights. \n85.  The claims of the representative Plaintiffs are typical of the classes.  Plaintiffs were\nsearched, prior to First Appearance, without reasonable suspicion that a strip and/or visual body\ncavity search would produce drugs, weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any\nsuch suspicion being articulated in a supervisor approved document).  Representative Plaintiffs have\nthe same interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the other class members.  Plaintiffs’\nclaims arose because of Defendants’ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip\nand/or visual body cavity searches before First Appearance without having, and recording in writing,\na reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons. Plaintiffs’\nclaims (except Lemister) also arose for being unreasonably detained in the Jail for hours despite an\norder signed by a judge that the Plaintiffs be immediately released or released after posting bond.\nPlaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each\nclass member suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a visual body cavity search\nand being unreasonably held for hours after being ordered immediately released or after posting\nbond.  The actual damages suffered by representative Plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the\nactual damages suffered by each class member.\n-18-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 19 of 27(cid:10)\n86.  The representative Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interest.\nPlaintiffs’ interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. They have\na strong personal interest in the outcome of this action and have no conflicts of interest with\nmembers of the Plaintiff class. The named Plaintiffs were all subjected to strip and visual body\ncavity searches without legal justification.  The named Plaintiffs (except Lemister) were all subjected\nto being unreasonably detained for hours in the Jail after being ordered immediately released by a\njudge or after posting bond.  As long as the policies, practices and customs of the Defendants\ncontinue to permit dehumanizing invasive strip and visual body cavity searches or the Defendants\ncontinue to unreasonably detain persons ordered immediately released by a judge or after posting\nbond, the named Plaintiffs (except Lemister), and the class they represent, are and will remain at high\nrisk of being subjected to searches in clear violation of established constitutional rights or being\ndetained unreasonably in the Jail after being ordered immediately released by a judge or after posting\nbond.\n87.  The named Plaintiffs are represented by experienced counsel who specialize in civil\nrights class action litigation.\n88.  The prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create\na risk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class\nwould establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.\n89.  The prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create\na risk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as\na practical matter, substantially impair or impede the ability of the other members of the class to\nprotect their interests.\n-19-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 20 of 27(cid:10)\n90.  The Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making\nappropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \n91.  A class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and equitable\nadjudication of the controversy between the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\nthereupon allege, that the interests of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution\nof a separate action is low in that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any\naction at all.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most members of the\nclass will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and\nthereupon allege, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the\nclaims arise in the same location.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common\nquestions of law and fact in one form, rather than in multiple courts.\nCOUNT ONE\n(Violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.\nConstitution on Behalf of Plaintiffs and All Persons Similarly Situated)\n92.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs one (1) through ninety-one (91) as though fully\nset forth herein.\n93.  The strip and/or visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of named\nDefendants.\n94.  The strip and/or visual body cavity searches to which Plaintiffs and all those similarly\nsituated were subjected are short-lived legal violations that are over before they can be challenged\nin court because all Plaintiffs are released prior to or at First Appearance (within the first 48 hours\nof incarceration), are legal violations which are an on-going policy of the Defendants and for which\n-20-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 21 of 27(cid:10)\nmonetary damages after-the-fact is not a suitable long-term solution, there is a reasonable likelihood\nthat the policy and practice will continue and plaintiff class members will be re-arrested, and\ntherefore the illegal policy is capable of repetition but evading review if declaratory and injunctive\nrelief is not provided. \n95.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the\nalleged offenses for which Plaintiffs had been arrested, without regard to whether or not Plaintiffs\nwere eligible for prompt release and without regard to whether or not Plaintiffs were eligible for\nand/or were released on their own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches complained of herein\nwere performed without Defendants having a reasonable belief that the Plaintiffs so searched\npossessed drugs, weapons or contraband or that there existed facts supporting a particularized\nreasonable suspicion that the searches would produce drugs, weapons or contraband, and those facts\nbeing articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document. The searches complained of\nherein were also performed by officers who did not have the prior written authorization of\nsupervising officers on duty.\n96.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants routinely\nfollow their policy, practice, and custom of requiring pre-First Appearance detainees to strip naked\nand  to  submit  to  visual  body  cavity  searches  without  having,  and  recording  in  writing,  a\nparticularized reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of drugs, weapons or\ncontraband or weapons. \n97.  Strip and body cavity searches, as alleged in this Complaint, are done as a matter of\nroutine, and are permitted and encouraged, in accordance with the established policies, practices and\ncustoms of the Defendants.\n-21-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 22 of 27(cid:10)\n98.  In searching the Plaintiffs as alleged, staff at the Jail act or have acted in accordance with\nthe policy, practice and custom authorized or permitted by Defendants Tidwell and Diggs. \n99.  The policy, practice and custom of strip or visual body cavity searching all arrestees, as\nauthorized or permitted by Defendants Tidwell and Diggs is attributable to Defendant Eslinger who,\nif he did not specifically authorize and permit the strip and visual body cavity searches as herein\nalleged, allowed Defendants Tidwell and Diggs to create and implement the policy, practice and\ncustom employed at the Jail.\n100.  The policy, practice and custom of strip or visual body cavity searching all arrestees,\nas authorized or permitted by Defendants Tidwell, Diggs, and Eslinger, is attributable to Seminole\nCounty, which has delegated the creation of policy, practice and custom at the Jail to Defendant\nEslinger.\n101.  Defendants Tidwell, Diggs, and Eslinger facilitate, encourage, and acquiesce in the\nbehavior of their subordinates, who routinely conduct strip and visual body cavity searches, as\nalleged in this Complaint.\n102.  Individual named Defendants herein are personally responsible for the promulgation\nand continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom pursuant to which Plaintiffs herein\nand all those similarly situated, were subjected to the searches complained of herein.\n103.  Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual body cavity\nsearches complained of herein violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.\nConstitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and violated said Plaintiffs’ rights\nto due process and privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, and directly and proximately damaged\nPlaintiffs as herein alleged, entitling Plaintiffs to recover damages for said constitutional violations\n-22-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 23 of 27(cid:10)\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nCOUNT TWO\n(Failure to Obtain Prior Written Authorization to a Strip Search is a \nViolation of a Liberty Interest Forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nU.S. Constitution on Behalf of Plaintiffs and All Persons Similarly Situated)\n104.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs one (1) through one-hundred-and-three (103)\nas though fully set forth herein.\n105.  Plaintiffs are informed and on that basis allege that Defendants strip search persons at\nthe Jail without first obtaining the prior written authorization from a supervising officer on duty, in\nviolation of Fla. Stat.  § 901.211.\n106.  Fla. Stat. § 901.211 is non-discretionary and therefore creates a liberty interest in not\nbeing strip searched without the prior written authorization specified therein.\n107.  Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual body cavity\nsearches complained of herein which are conducted by officers who do not obtain the prior written\nauthorization of a supervising officer on duty violates Plaintiffs’ rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment of the U.S. Constitution in that Fla. Stat. § 901.211(5) creates a liberty interest\npreventing strip searches without the prior written authorization of a supervising officer on duty, and\ndirectly and proximately damaged Plaintiffs as herein alleged, entitling Plaintiffs to recover damages\nfor said constitutional violation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nCOUNT THREE\n( Unreasonable Detention After Being Ordered to be Immediately Released is an\nUnreasonable Seizure in Violation of the Fourth Amendment and a Violation of a Liberty\nInterest Forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution on Behalf of\nPlaintiffs and All Persons Similarly Situated)\n-23-\n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 20     Filed 08/02/2005     Page 24 of 27(cid:10)\n108.  Plaintiffs (except Lemister) repeat and reallege paragraphs one (1) through one-\nhundred-and-seven (107) as though fully set forth herein.\n109.  The unreasonably long detention in the Jail, after a release order is entered and after Jail\nofficials are made aware of the order, or after the posting of bond, to which Plaintiffs (except\nLemister) and all those similarly situated were subjected were performed pursuant to policies,\npractices, and customs of named Defendants. \n110.  The unreasonable detention to which the Plaintiffs (except Lemister) and all those\nsimilarly situated were subjected are short-lived legal violations that are over before they can be\nchallenged in court, are legal violations which are an on-going policy of the Defendants and for\nwhich monetary damages alone after-the-fact is not a suitable long-term solution, there is a\nreasonable likelihood that the policy,  practice, and custom will continue and Plaintiff class members\nwill be re-arrested, and therefore the illegal policy, practice, and custom is capable of repetition but\nevading review if declaratory and injunctive relief is not provided. \n111.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Defendants routinely\nfollow their policy, practice, and custom of unreasonable detention after receipt of release orders or\nthe posting of bond.  \n112.  Unreasonably long detentions, as alleged in this Complaint, are done as a matter of\nroutine, and are permitted and encouraged, in accordance with the established policies, practices and\ncustoms of the Defendants.\n113.

The policy, practice and custom of unreasonably long detention, as authorized or\npermitted by Defendants Tidwell and Diggs is attributable to Defendant Eslinger who, if he did not\nspecifically authorize and permit the unreasonably long detention as herein alleged, allowed\nDefendants Tidwell and Diggs to create and implement the policy, practice and custom employed\nat the Jail.\n115.  The policy, practice and custom of unreasonably long detention, as authorized or\npermitted by Defendants Tidwell, Diggs, and Eslinger, is attributable to Seminole County, which has\ndelegated the creation of policy, practice and custom at the Jail to Defendant Eslinger.\n116.

P ARILLA, ALDA RUGG, \nBILLY CATES, THERESA DECLUE, \nAILEEN NUNEZ, DAVID W. ROBERTS, \nKIM LEMISTER, and FRANTARSHIA \nSTAFFORD, individually and on behalf of \na class of all others similarly situated, \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nDONALD ESLINGER, individually and \nin his official capacity as Sheriff of Seminole \nCounty, MICHAEL TIDWELL, individually \nand in his official capacity as Director of the \nJohn E. Polk Correctional Facility, DAVID DIGGS, \nin his individually capacity, and SEMINOLE \nCOUNTY, \nDefendants. \n--------------------------------------~/ \nANSWER AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO \nSECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT, \nBY DEFENDANTS ESLINGER, TIDWELL, AND DIGGS \nCOME NOW Defendants Donald Eslinger, individually and in his official \ncapacity as Sheriff of Seminole County, Florida, Michael Tidwell, individually and \nin his official capacity as Director of the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, and \n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 58     Filed 05/04/2006     Page 2 of 6(cid:10)\nDavid Diggs, in his individual capacity, and answer Plaintiffs' Second Amended \nClass-Action Complaint as follows: \n1.  It is admitted that Donald Eslinger is, and at all material times to this \naction was, the Sheriff of Seminole County, Florida.  It is admitted that all actions \nundertaken by the Sheriff in relation to this action were taken in his discretionary \nauthority as Sheriff. \n2.  It is admitted that Michael Tidwell is the current commander of the \nJohn E. Polk Correctional Facility and that all actions undertaken by him in regard \nto this matter were in his discretionary authority. \n3.  It is  admitted that David Diggs was  the  commander of the John E. \nPolk Correctional Facility until  approximately December 31,  2004,  and  that all \nactions  undertaken  by  him  in  regard  to  this  matter  were  in  his  discretionary \nauthority. \n4.  All other allegations of Plaintiffs' Complaint not expressly admitted \nherein are denied. \n5.  It is specifically denied that the claims, or circumstances surrounding \nthe claims of, the named Plaintiffs are common to, typical of, or representative of \nthe claims of the proposed classes.  It is further denied that the named Plaintiffs or \ntheir claims are otherwise appropriate as common to, typical of, representative of \n2 \n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 58     Filed 05/04/2006     Page 3 of 6(cid:10)\nthe  proposed  classes  and  it  is  further  denied  that  this  action  may properly be \nmaintained as a class action. \nAFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES \nFirst Affirmative Defense \n6.  The Second Amended Class-Action Complaint fails  to state a claim \nupon which relief may be  granted in  terms  of the  alleged unconstitutional strip \nsearches.  Specifically,  particularized  reasonable  suspicion  is  not  the  correct \nstandard for strip searches for safety and security, conducted at a pre-trial detention \ncenter. \nSecond Affirmative Defense \n7.  The  Court has previously dismissed the  claims  for  unconstitutional \nstrip searches based on failure to obtain prior written authorization for search.  To \nthe extent that Plaintiffs continue to seek redress based on such claims, Defendants \nwould  assert  that  prior  written  authorization  is  not  required  by  the  U.S. \nConstitution nor does the requirement for prior written authorization in state statute \nrepresent a federal right actionable under § 19830 \nThird Affirmative Defense \n8.  The Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted \nas to the Fourteenth Amendment overdetention claims brought in Count II of the \nSecond  Amended  Class-Action  Complaint.  Pursuant  to  the  Court's  order  of \n3 \n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 58     Filed 05/04/2006     Page 4 of 6(cid:10)\nDecember 5,  2005, these claims are  governed by a Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess analysis.  The  correct standard is  a shocks the  conscience or deliberate \nindifference  standard  and  the  time-frames  complained  of do  not  shock  the \nconscience,  reflect  deliberate  indifference  to  the  constitutional  rights  of  the \nPlaintiffs, or othelWise represent violations of Plaintiffs' rights. \nFourth Affirmative Defense \n9.  All claims brought on behalf of proposed class members, where the \nproposed class members were incarcerated or othelWise detained on the date of the \nfiling or the bringing of this action, are barred by 42 U.S.C.  § 1997(e) absent a \nshowing by said Plaintiffs of a physical injury. \nFifth Affirmative Defense \n10.  To the extent sued in their individual capacities, each of the named \nDefendants was acting in his discretionary capacity as a governmental official and \ndid not violate clearly established law such that he is entitled to qualified immunity \nfrom suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nSixth Affirmative Defense \n11.  Defendant  Sheriff  Eslinger  is  independently  entitled  to  qualified \nimmunity, to the extent sued in his individual capacity, as the actions complained \nof in the Second Amended Class-Action Complaint were not undertaken pursuant \n4 \n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 58     Filed 05/04/2006     Page 5 of 6(cid:10)\nto the  Sheriffs supervisory capacity and because the  Defendant did not violate \nclearly established law. \nSeventh Affirmative Defense \nThe  Court lacks jurisdiction over  the  injunctive relief sought under such \ndoctrines as separation of powers and sovereign immunity, and should otherwise \nabstain from entry of any Order which interferes with the Defendants' judgment as \nmembers  of the  Executive  branch  in  discretionary  policy-making.  The  Court \nshould  defer  to  the  Defendants  in matters  of jail management  and  should  not \ninterfere with decisions of the Defendants in day-to-day operation of the jail as the \nCourt is not equipped to monitor or manage such issues and is an inferior position \nto do  so, particularly with respect to  the claims based in the procedures used or \nlength of time for intake and release of inmates. \n5 \n\nCase 6:05-cv-00850-GAP-KRS     Document 58     Filed 05/04/2006     Page 6 of 6(cid:10)\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \nI hereby certify that on this 4th  day of May 2006, I electronically filed the \nforegoing with the Clerk of the Court by using the CM/ECF system which will \nsend a notice of electronic  filing  to the  following:  J.

Both the published and mailed notices specified that any person who chose to object to \nthe Settlement, either personally or through counsel, and desired to appear at the Fairness Hearing \nwas required to submit a Notice of Intention to Appear, together with written arguments in support \nof any objection, by May 4,2007.

After her claim 's fonn,jail records and correspondence reviewed, it was detennined that \nMs. HAGNER was not a verified class member.  Ms. HAGNER was infonned as to the Court's \nreasoning for not allowing her claim, and what remedies she still has ifshe wishes to file a separate \naction. \n8.
