In addition, pursuant to the Court's oral ruling at the March 26, 2009, scheduling conference, the parties may proceed with discovery regarding the named plaintiffs' overdetention claims. During the preliminary phase of factual development, initial disclosures shall be limited to an initial exchange of documents, as outlined. In addition to the described exchange of documents, there shall be a period of forty-five (45) days from the execution of the Scheduling Order within which the parties may serve written discovery, including interrogatories and requests for production of documents, limited to the scope of discovery as ordered. The parties shall have an additional sixty (60) days after the conclusion of written discovery to conduct depositions. At the conclusion of this initial phase of discovery, the parties shall submit to the Court proposed stipulations of fact with citations to documents or deposition transcripts. Proposed stipulations shall be due twenty (20) days after conclusion of the deposition phase of discovery. Signed by Judge Richard W. Story on 7/14/09.

    "summary": "<p>On April 21, 2004, eleven former male detainees of the Fulton County Jail, represented by private attorneys, brought this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The plaintiffs challenged as unconstitutional the Jail's practices of (a) conducting \"blanket strip searches\" of inmates entering and/or returning to the Jail without any individualized determination that such searches would reveal contraband; and (b) detaining inmates past their scheduled release dates (\"over-detention\").  The plaintiffs alleged that these practices had persisted at the Fulton County Jail for years and estimated that some 10,000 or more inmates were affected.  The plaintiffs claimed that the practices were improper under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as the Georgia Constitution and common law.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages and class certification.  </p><p>The complaint was amended four times.  In addition to suing the former and current Fulton County Sheriffs, the plaintiffs sued Fulton County and the City of Atlanta, alleging that those governmental entities were liable because their police forces had entrusted arrestees to the Fulton County Jail with knowledge of the unconstitutional conditions that existed there.  The plaintiffs alleged that three types of blanket strip searches occurred at the Jail: (1) blanket strip searches of arrestees as part of their point-of-entry booking into the Jail (AR Group); (2) blanket strip searches of detainees who posted bond or were ordered released at the Jail before their point-of-entry booking into the Jail (AL Group); and (3) blanket strip searches of detainees who returned to the jail from a court appearance after having been ordered released in state court (CR Group). </p><p>The defendants denied all allegations and sought dismissal of the action for failure to state a claim and under the defenses of both Eleventh Amendment immunity and qualified immunity.  On July 5, 2005, the District Court (Judge Richard W. Story) granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motions to dismiss.  The Court determined that: (1) the Sheriffs were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity for the monetary claims against them in their official capacity; (2) the Sheriffs were entitled to qualified immunity for the strip search claims; (3) the Sheriffs were not entitled to qualified immunity as to the over-detention claims; (4) the detainees adequately stated § 1983 claims against the county; and (5) the detainees lacked standing to seek injunctive relief against the county defendants.  Powell v. Barrett, 376 F.Supp.2d 1340 (N.D.Ga. 2005).  All parties appealed.   </p><p>In two separate August 23, 2007, opinions, one published and one unpublished, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case to the District Court.  In the published opinion, the Eleventh Circuit panel (Justice Susan Harrell Black) found that some plaintiffs could pursue their strip search claims against former Sheriff Barrett in her individual capacity.  All of the strip search claims against current Sheriff Freeman, Fulton County, and the City of Atlanta were ordered dismissed.  Powell v. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir. 2007).  In the unpublished opinion, the Eleventh Circuit panel (per curiam) let stand the over-detention claims against former Sheriff Barrett in her individual capacity.  All other over-detention claims were ordered dismissed.  Powell v. Barrett, 246 Fed.Appx. 615 (11th Cir. Aug 23, 2007). </p><p>On February 4, 2008, the Eleventh Circuit, acting en banc, vacated the August 23, 2007 panel opinions and agreed to rehear the appeal.  On September 4, 2008, the en banc Eleventh Circuit issued an opinion in which they ruled that a policy or practice of strip searching all arrestees as a part of the process of booking them into the general population of a detention facility, even without reasonable suspicion to believe that they may be concealing contraband, is permissible, so long as the strip search is no more extensive than the one upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  The en banc panel then remanded the case back to the original Eleventh Circuit panel for proceedings in line with this decision.</p><p>The case was promptly remanded to the district court, which on March 27, 2009, dismissed the City of Atlanta, the State of Georgia, and Fulton County from the case and entered judgment in their favor.  The case proceeded against other defendants.</p><p>On March 3, 2011, the court granted summary judgment to the defendants as to the strip-search claims, but denied the motion for summary judgment for the over-detention claims.  Discovery continued regarded the over-detention claims. </p><p>On February 17, 2012, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs' over-detention claims. Since no claims remained, the court entered final judgment in favor of the defendants. 2012 WL 567065.</p><p>The plaintiffs appealed both grants of summary judgment for the over-detention claim and the strip-search claim. On March 7, 2013, the Eleventh Circuit (Judge Hull) affirmed the district court's holding that the defendant was entitled to qualified immunity as to the plaintiffs' over-detention and strip search claims. Specifically, the Eleventh Circuit held that 1) assuming without deciding that, when they were over-detained, the plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by jail employees, the plaintiffs failed to establish that sheriff was liable as a supervisor; 2) the jailers did not violate pre-trial detainees' Fourth Amendment rights by visually searching them for legitimate safety and penological reasons prior to admitting or readmitting them to the jail's general population; and 3) pre-trial detainees have no constitutional right, much less a clearly established right, to be held in a particular cell or a separate area of a jail and not be placed back in the general jail population. 511 F. App'x 957, 964 (11th Cir. 2013).</p><p>The plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case, but on November 4, 2013, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. 134 S. Ct. 513 (2013). The case is now closed. </p><p></p>",

During 2002, Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin conceived a plan to order \nAtlanta PD officers to exercise their discretion to charge all persons who \ncould be charged with either municipal or state offenses with state offenses. \n68.  During 2002, Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin conceived a plan to order \nAtlanta PD officers to exercise their discretion to commit all persons it \narrested and charged with state offenses to Fulton County Jail instead of an \nAtlanta detention facility. \n69.  Mayor Shirley Franklin expressly announced that the purpose of her \nplan was to save money for the City of Atlanta. \n70.  Mayor Franklin advised the City of Atlanta City Council that her plan \nwould save the City of Atlanta about $11.4 million in fiscal year 2003. \n16 \n\nE \n-'  t \ni.  ._  _.  _.  .__  i1/IaVC1Tl'Y'$IIK11Tla^yiaia, 3:1^. \nbudget. \n72.  Fulton County officials had estimated it would cost anywhere from $8 \nmillion to $17 million to process and house the arrestees the City of Atlanta \nhad previously processed and housed. \n73.  As of January 1, 2003, the Atlanta PD began charging all persons who \ncould be charged with either municipal offenses or state offenses with state \noffenses. \n74.  As of January 1, 2003, the City of Atlanta stopped detaining persons \narrested by the Atlanta PD in Fulton County. \n75.  As of January 1, 2003, the Atlanta PD began committing those \narrestees it arrested in Fulton County and charged with state offenses \ndirectly to the Fulton County Jail. \nRecords Room And Operations Of The Records Room \n76.  The Records Room is the unit of the Fulton County Jail that has \nresponsibility for booking arrestees into the Fulton County Jail. \nAdditionally, these employees create and administer institutional files for \n17 \n\nr \nl \ninm~tpe, anti kPPtl YT'ACk of inmates to BilSiiiiiis i. icii i^cic^cZB° uc^\"^.;'C'.:1e LO \n77.  The Records Room uses a combined system of paper files and computer \ndatabases to keep track of inmates, prepare them to be transported to court \nfor court hearings, and process the release and commillment. orders generated \nat the court hearings. \n78.  When inmates are \"booked\" into the Fulton County Jail, the Records \nRoom creates, or in the case of a person who has previously been booked into \nthe Fulton County Jail, updates a 4x6 card for each inmate showing his \ndemographic information, his open charges, and his charge history. \n79.  As part of the booking process, the Records Room staff also checks \ncriminal databases to determine if the new commitment is the subject of any \nother wants, holds or detainees from other jurisdictions. \n80.  If there are such holds, the information is noted in the inmate's \ninstitutional files, and on the 4x6 card. \n18 \n\ni \ni \n41 .  \\hll..,fl,o,\" +hp ;nmat.a iC t.hP RubiECt of 3RV other wants, hlolds or \n;;- -oai t:m__=' nn_ tna \nLV1d1111i'd1-1-1-c \" CviuY~u  4~~ ~~.,.....,.,  u.. . ..., ;.lwblo to Record.- -Room staff and deputies. \n82.  The Jail and the courthouses have their own computer systems for \nkeeping track of defendants and their court dates, and entering diqposIt10I_IS \ninto the computer systems. \n83.  As a result, court data, release, and commitment orders issued by \njudges for in-custody defendants must be faxed from the courthouses to the \nFulton County Jail.  This information must be processed by hand for each \ninmate. \n84.  The large number of inmates in the Fulton County Jail, and the \nconstant flow of inmates and releases, have overwhelmed the outmoded, \npaper-driven system for processing inmates. \n85.  Lack of staff and lack of training exacerbates problems caused by the \nsystemic deficiencies in the inmate management system. \n19 \n\nt \nv \nRG;.

Because of problems and backlogs in the Records Room, many newly \ncommitted inmates are not actually booked into the Jail for several days alter \ntheir commitment. \n88.  The Fulton County Jail also accepts for commitment to the Fulton \nCounty Jail arrestees brought by the Atlanta PD, and the Fulton County \nPolice Department, to the Fulton County Jail without charging or arrest \ndocuments. \nThe Fulton County Jail Policy Of Strip Searching All Arrestees Booked Into \nThe Fulton County Jail \n89.  Every person booked into the Fulton County Jail is subjected to a strip \nsearch conducted without an individual determination of reasonable \nsuspicion to justify the search, and regardless of the crime with which the \nperson is charged. \n20 \n\n.', \ni \nnn  TL.y Va\u001e;., \u001e _ _n~ r,pnraCC involves having file arrested person go +=%t^ \nlarge, 7'UVlll Wi~ia a K,iv1j.~  ~. l1~'; ''..,r.  ;_1.1_`_-_. -v } ; P;-4;- \"\" other inmatPR, remove.  dlnl  Ulr  \nh15 clothing, axiu7  place 4~1.,...,.  clothing t_ o ~llIYPC \n91.  The arrested person, along with the group, takes a shower and is then \nsprayed with delousing agent. \n92.  Each arrestee then either singly, or standing in a line with others, is \nvisually inspected front and back by deputies. \n93.  The Fulton County Jail does not keep any logs or other records of any \nindividual strip searches performed in the booking areas. \nThe Fulton County Jail Policy For Court Returns \n94.  Every weekday, about 100 to 150 in-custody defendants are transported \nfrom the Fulton County Jail to the Superior Court and the State Court for \ncourt appearances. \n95.  The Records Room does not run checks for wants and holds on in- \ncustody defendants before they are transported to the courthouses for \nhearings. \n21 \n\nt \ni \n.\u001e.,  MI-_ n ; ..~.,a~ u\u001e\u001e\u001e,  floc null t.-hp. 4x6 earn of each 111111cl1.C who i5 gc.^.g ~o \nS, courthouse, iti  n  ,~ t~\u001e a !;~ar.i\u001e..~~ .  andi  r,~rs the ra_rri,c \naside in the necu~u5 ~ oo:.~. \n97.  The in-custody defendants are under the constant supervision of Fulton \nCounty Sheriffs deputies while in transit, and while at the courthouses. \n98.  While at the courthouse, in-custody defendants are not allowed to have \ncontact with anyone apart from Fulton County Sheriffs deputies, except for \nvisits in the lockups with attorneys.  These attorney visits are subject to \nsupervision by Fulton County Sheriffs deputies during the visits. \n99.  After an in-custody defendant appears before a judge, the judge issues \nan order directing release or further commitment.  These orders are reduced \nto writing by the clerk. \n100.  The clerk does not enter the disposition into the court computer system \nin real time. \n101.  Dispositions are entered into the court computer system later in the \nday, or the next day. \n102.  The release and commitment orders are faxed to the Records Room. \n22 \n\ni  i \n1VJ.

Every in-custody defendant transported to the Superior Court or the \nState Court for a court event is sent back to the Fulton County Jail following \nhis court appearance even ii the judge has issued a release order.  Such \npersons are sometimes called \"court returns\". \n105.  The Fulton County Jail sends these court returns with release orders \nback to the Fulton County Jail so the Records Room can check for any other \nopen cases with detention orders, warrants, detainees or holds before \nreleasing them. \n106.  The Records Room relies on its paper records as updated by the faxed \ncourt orders.  Fulton County has not implemented a county-wide computer \ninmate management system as it was ordered to do by this Court. \n107.  Court returns entitled to release are booked back into the Fulton \nCounty Jail general populations while the Records Room processes the day's \ncommit and release orders.  Even though they are entitled to release, these \ncourt returns are not actually released until a later date. \n23 \n\ni \nTl,o 0.\u001e,- ()f Tl,n Q~rprfla~antnn - I let.atninPParanns Ordered Releasect TO \nw'vi  i~v\"t~fj inp=P Uf ii r in-ii,  i'v'i n i~nrFiiicii~ \nn . \nii hv0v .

The fact that the Fulton County Jail has no effective inmate \nmanagement system has been documented by a series of reports and \nnewspaper articles, as well as by court cases dating back many years. \n110.  The Fulton County Jail has recently aggravated the backlog of \noverdetained inmates by overreacting to a string of premature releases. \n111.  The Fulton County Jail's policy of returning all in-custody defendants \nsent to the courthouses for hearings back to the Jail for processing after their \nhearings, even those whose cases have been dismissed, swells the backlog of \nunprocessed inmates. \n112.  This policy and practice is a major contributing cause of the Records \nRoom's inability to process and release individuals on their Release Dates. \n24 \n\ni  e \nl l :j'I'ha nnlirv nt cPnriinu emirt. returns entitled LO release back t0 the Jail. \n,~..1, ....nl,lom \n114.  If the court returns entitled to release by virtue of their court \nappearances were released at the courthouse, they would not be booked back \nin and strip searched in the first place. \n115.  The policy of sending court returns entitled to release back to the Jail, \ninstead of releasing them from the courthouses, exacerbates the \noverdetention and overcrowding problem.  This policy adds persons who have \nalready been ordered released by a judge into an already overloaded system. \n116.  The Fulton County Jail's policy of sending all court returns, even those \nwhose cases have been dismissed, back to the jail for processing costs \ntaxpayers money, swells the population of the facilities unnecessarily, and \ncauses inmate unrest. \n25 \n\ni \nl \ni'nP 0verv.rnwrii»g.

The Fulton County Jail has a long and documented history of \novercrowding, overdetaining inmates past their release dates, and \nprematurely releasing inmates. \n118.  The old jail had been the subject of a 1982 class-action lawsuit Fambro \nv.  Fulton,  82-cv2136, JOF) challenging conditions at that facility, including \novercrowding and overdetentions. \n119.  Among the many deficiencies the monitor found at the old jail in 1989, \nthree broad areas were especially outrageous:  1) overcrowding, 2) medical \nservices, and 3) sanitation. \n120.  The Court ultimately had to take the drastic step of ordered wholesale \nreleases in an attempt to solve the problems of 1) overcrowding, 2) medical \nservices, and 3) sanitation. \n121.  In 1989, this Court published a decision that warned the Fulton \nCounty Commissioners that the new jail would not be sufficient to \nhandle the present inmate population requirements of the county \n26 \n\nt  i \nher.anca nT a c\u001ehcr.ant;aiiv nianer poquiaiion, and nirohiems with \n4~Y.:iicll X112 :.^i^liiAI \n122.  The 1982 class-action lawsuit continued to cover the current Rice \nStreet Jail when that facility opened in 1991, until the suit was settled by the \nFulton County Commission in 1994, and was dismissed by this Court. \n123.  The unconstitutional 1) overcrowding, 2) medical services, and 3) \nsanitation deficiencies persisted in the new facility. \n124.  Certain inmates of the Fulton County Jail again brought a class action \nagainst Fulton County, the Sheriff, and the Board in 1999.  Foster v.  Fulton \nCounty,  1 :99-cv-900-MHS challenging 1) overcrowding, 2) medical services, \nespecially medical services for HIV positive inmates, 3) overdetentions, and \n4) sanitation. \n125.  The Court found that systemic problems lead to unnecessary \nincarceration and chronic jail overcrowding, which in turn adversely affected \nliving conditions at the jail, thus increasing the risk of exposure to dangerous \ndiseases, and interfering with the provision of adequate medical care, and \nthus being a major contributing moving force of the overdetentions. \n27 \n\ni \nt` \n199  -Rarant.  nnt.nrirnic axamnlES of OV0TQ0LEriL10I1 show the ovurdetuilt-on and \n127.  At least eight jail inmates were released by error over the past year. \n128.  Inmates routinely must obtain attorneys or inmate rights organizations \non the outside to call the Records Room just to obtain release in accordance \nwith their Release Dates. \n129.  On information and belief, at any one time up to 5-20% of the Fulton \nCounty Jail population is being held past their Release Dates. \n130.  The chart set forth below shows how pervasive and widespread the \noverdetention problem is. \n131.  The chart shows the court date, Release Date, and Exit Date for \nvirtually every inmate who appeared in magistrate court first appearance \nhearings (9 a.m.  and 1 p.m.  calendars) and State Court

For example, Plaintiff Alan Powell was arrested anti committed into-  \nthe Fulton County Jail early on the morning of Saturday, March 20, 2004. \nHe was not booked in until approximately 6:00 p.m.  the following day; \nSunday, March 21, 2004. \n135.  As a result, Mr. Powell was not taken to the misdemeanor court in \nState Court for First Appearance, and so was not given a bond hearing. \n136.  Moreover, even though Mr. Powell was entitled to bail based on a \nschedule for minor offenses, Jail staff told him that he could not be released \non bail until after he was booked. \n137.  Finally, on the evening of Sunday, March 21, 2004, Mr.  Powell was \nformerly booked into the jail. \n138.  Along with the booking procedure came a degrading, humiliating strip \nsearch. \n40 \n\nE \npVPYV(1TlP else booked into Li s iiiitvii i..'^.uI:;.ly e)uSi ion \n?~~T1CLHy ctYeili.

Then each man took his clothes to a counter and exchanged  :s a~:^. \nclothes for a jail jumpsuit. \n141.  Before picking up his jumpsuit, Mr.  Powell, along with every other \ninmate in the process, had to stand before a guard front and center, and show \nhis front and back sides while naked. \n142.  Mr.  Powell's family posted his bond on Sunday, March 21, 2004. \n143.  However, Mr.  Powell was not released.  When he complained, guards \nthreatened to \"lose\" his paperwork. \n144.  Mr.  Powell was finally released on Tuesday morning, March 23, 2004. \n145.  The jail frequently sends recently arrested inmates to bond hearings at \nState Court before the inmates have been booked in. \n41 \n\ni  r \n...  -  '~--  ~-----7 Lc-- ~rP 1T1P`i]-n1]]ejQSS UF'I.AILSE the ilaTiait~°S \nCannot :i£ °:tr°Y eng_rgeii Oi bvnuc~.

Without probable cause, \njudges are forced to throw out cases within 48 hours. \n148.  On March 18, 2004, Judge Roy Roberts in State Court dismissed \nmisdemeanor charges against 22 defendants because they were presented in \nhis courtroom without paperwork.  They had been sent to court without \nhaving been booked. \n149.  However, even when a judge orders inmates released at the first \nappearance, their release is no sure thing. \n150.  During the period March 18-31, 2004, approximately 135 persons \npresented before the magistrate for a probable cause hearing.. \n151.  Almost every single person was overdetained for periods ranging from \none day to twelve days.

Defendants have known of the ineffective and chaotic condition of the \nRecords Room inmate management system for years. \nM_  Moreover, ;ail_ officials have had personal knowledge of the problem for \nyears. \n154.  The Fulton County Commission has also been aware of the above- \ndescribed problems in the inmate management system for years. \n155.  In the past few years, the Fulton County commissioners have had a \nfederal judge, a grand jury, two separate private consultants, and a rash of \nescapes to tell them about problems at the Fulton County Jail.  These \nproblems are such as money for more guards, money for mental health \ntreatment, money for new facilities to handle nonviolent inmates in work- \nrelease programs, money to fix a crippled computer system, money to \nstreamline the court system, money for public defenders, and money for \nmore probation officers. \n43 \n\nf \nE \nE \nCt  a statemei-A ternung \ncontirliAhig problems. at the crowUlmj` aln,I   \"%s-tL-a-f-f - M J1-\"1.  -n  \"s-t ate of- \nemergency.\" \nDefendant Jacqueline Barrett's Failure To Take Meaningful.  Sustained \nCorrective Action \n157.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett has acquiesced in the Records Room's \nchaotic procedures leading to the overdetention and strip search problems by \nfailing to take any meaningful, sustained corrective action. \n158.  The Fulton County Jail is understaffed.  Only about 650 guards watch \nover 2,900 inmates. \n159.  Fulton County has refused to provide adequate funding to the Fulton \nCounty Jail. \n160.  Last year, the Fulton County Commission reduced the Jail's funding by \n$3,000,000. \n161.  Jacqueline Barrett never sent inmates to other county jails as she was \nauthorized to do under Georgia law. \n44 \n\nE \nA..  - fo~, Cf,. \u001e .Cno,~nhpc Pprfnrmar{ RV Tha F'nltnn ('.nnnfv .la;l \n162.  On March 21, 2004, Plaintiff Alan Powell was booked into the Fulton \nCounty Jail's general population.  He was subjected to a strip search without \nany individualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that he \nwas concealing contraband or weapons. \n163.  On February 6, 2003, Plaintiff Tory Dunlap was booked into the Fulton \nCounty Jail's general population.  He was subjected to a strip search without \nany individualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that he \nwas concealing contraband or weapons \n164.  On December 20, 2003, Plaintiff Lee Antonio Smith was booked into \nthe Fulton County Jail's general population.  He was subjected to a strip \nsearch without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or \nprobable cause that he was concealing contraband or weapons. \n165.  On August 22, 2003, Plaintiff David Evans was booked into the Fulton \nCounty Jail's general population.  He was subjected to a strip search without \nany individualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that he \nwas concealing contraband or weapons. \n45 \n\ni \nf'lacc Art.inn illjvo'at.innc \n\"Arrestee Strip Search Class\" -- Class Action Allegations \nlbb.  m1 lh  e rAi rre8iee S(~t~ ri' p ~Ce .a i`C7U_  Name u.l Trli_di._uPl~aiintuif f_s  1b.r..i'.n_ g i lii..i5_  acit_i_o_n_  und1e.r..  \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the two years preceding the \nfiling of this action up until the date this case is terminated, was or will be, (i) \nupon being arrested and committed into the Fulton County Jail;  (ii) on a \ncharge other than a charge of drugs, weapon or felony violence;  (iii) was \nsubjected to a blanket strip search without any individualized finding of \nreasonable suspicion or probable cause that he or she was concealing drugs, \nweapons or other contraband. \n167.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Fulton County Jail has a policy, and engages in a \npattern and practice of conduct that has uniformly affected all members of \nthe class.  Injunctive relief against Defendant to enjoin the practice will \nbenefit each and every Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiff and class \nmember. \n168.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above- \n46 \n\ni \nrlnenr;hprl nnlirv an(i nract.7f'.P alt Sllh10Ct1Ile $YY2SL20S LO blanketL  strip Sedi~Ci105 \ni\"  i \nL11 AL lic vi oiic  ~o~i;\u001eR a=nac ixraanrnic or nthPr contraband. \n169.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate in that common questions of law and tact predominate over \nany individual questions.  A class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below. \n170.  Regarding the Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and members of \nthe class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability.  Every \narrestee committed into the Fulton County Jail is subjected to the blanket \nstrip searches.  None of the staff of the Fulton County Jail keeps records of \nthese searches.  Therefore, Defendant cannot show that any of the searches \nwere conducted based on an individual determination of reasonable \nsuspicion.  Should records exist demonstrating such individualized suspicion, \nsuch people would, by definition, not be members of the class. \n171.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na.  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett instituted a policy, \nor acquiesced in a custom and practice of subjecting arrestees \n47 \n\ni  i \n-- _.---:++~a ~= 4-1,~ TP.,If-\u001e ('n\u001enfv .laid nanrlina nYPRPTIt.meni to \nf11i111Ke 6 JLllp sed11.11GJ vvuiavu~ u- ...`.'. . ..~. .\u001e.._1.'_._~ ..l_  1  ~  ..F~ \nL11 at the d l'i\"Cj~CCS were iii posses O+vix v..F  a vr~u\u001egro.a ,- , c~r.o_oi,n.n._n_c..  !1_\" l1fl'1P7' \ncontraband; \nb.  whether such policy or practice, if found to exist, violates \nthe Fourth Amendment; \nc.  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett was deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of such arrestees; \nd.  whether the Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and \nthe members of the class have sustained damages and, if so, the \nproper measure of such damages; \ne.  whether the Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and \nthe members of the class and future members are entitled to \nequitable relief and, if so, what is the nature of that relief;  and \nf.  whether determination of damages suffered by a \nstatistically representative sample of the class provides the basis \nfor determination of all class members' damages except those who \n48 \n\ng.  Whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to \nqualified immunity on the §1983 claims;  and \nh.  Whether Defendant Jacaueline Barrett is entitled to \ngovernmental immunity on the state law claims. \n172.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time. \nHowever, every week at least 100 persons meeting the Arrestee Strip Search \nClass class definition are committed into the Fulton County Jail pending \npresentment.  All are subject to the illegal searches.  Thus, this class well \nexceeds 10,000 members. \n173.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and the Fulton County Jail have within \ntheir records the names and addresses of all current and past class members. \nThis information is maintained in the Fulton County Jail computer systems \n(CJUS, JDL and Banner and Mainframe), logbooks, and other paper records \nmaintained by the Fulton County Jail. \n174.

The class action is superior to any other \navailable means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Fourth \nAmendment Class.  The class action will be manageable because so many \ndifferent records systems exist from which to ascertain the members of the \nputative class.

The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules \n23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf \nof a class consisting of:  (a) each person who has been, is, or who will be \nincarcerated in any Fulton County Jail facility in the two years preceding the \nfiling of this action up to and until the date this case is terminated;  and (b) \nwho was not released or, in the future, will not be released by midnight on \nthe date on which the person is entitled to be released by court order, posting \nbail, or the date on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise \nexpired. \n202.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because Defendant Jacqueline Barrett implemented a policy, or \nengages in a pattern and practice of conduct that has uniformly affected all \n54 \n\nf \ni \n-  -  .,_,_  r  ,...;\u001e,+ noto*,~Ia*,+ .iarnuPiine Barrett \nW111 UCilcii~ each aa  ::d every ~-~VE'rIiYI.viIL1Vii N, am cu i iu...un-.--- Aa 4~ q --- 1, or \n203.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed policy and practice of overdetentions. \n204.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions.  A class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below. \n205.  Regarding the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs and members of the \nclass, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability other than \nwhether an individual has been overdetained.  The answer to that question \ncan be determined by ministerial inspection of the Jail's records. \n206.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na)  whether the Constitution provides a bright line, maximum \nlength of time measured in hours beyond which Defendant \ncannot hold a person before releasing that person from jail after a \njudge has ordered his release or he has posted bail, or the basis \n55 \n\ni \nfnr hi.c riatant.inn hac nt.harwica axnirari~ \nb)  whether Defendants have exceeded that maximum for \neach class member; \nc)  whether there is a pattern and practice of the Fulton \nCounty Jail of holding inmates past their Release Dates; \nd)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett has been \ndeliberately indifferent to the pattern and practice of the Fulton \nCounty Jail of holding inmates past their Release Dates; \ne)  whether Defendants' acts as alleged herein violate the \nConstitution of the United States by holding detainees and \ninmates past their release dates; \nwhether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fourth \nand/or Fourteenth Amendments; \ng)  whether Jacqueline Barrett was deliberately indifferent to \nthe rights of inmates and detainees in the custody of the Fulton \nCounty Jail; \n56 \n\nf \n1-1  --.1..,.til...r fl.n (l..o,\"apfnn+;nn Nnmpri Plaintiffs anti the \nIIICI11U61'3 Vl b11 C V  uciciaia viuou \nand, 11 JU, the iJ1ViJC iiaicaouic vaCoouuCclh,  auaauu6C;; \ni)  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for \ndetermination of all class members' damages except those who \nopt out; \nj)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to qualified \nimmunity on the section 1983 claims;  and \nk)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to \ngovernmental immunity on the state law claims. \n207.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time. \nHowever, every week at least 100 persons meeting the Overdetention Class \ndefinition are released from the Fulton County Jail.  Thus, this class well \nexceeds 10,000 members. \n208.

The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of \nthe other members of the class, because the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs \nand all other members of the class were injured by exactly the same means; \nthat is, by the systemic collapse of the inmate management system, and the \npractice of returning in-custody defendants entitled to release by virtue of \ntheir court appearances from the courthouses to the Fulton County Jail to \ncheck for wants, holds and detainers. \n210.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the members of the class.  They have retained counsel who \nare competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action \nlitigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n211.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are \ncontrary to, or in conflict with, those of the class. \n212.

Upon being booked into the Fulton County Jail, each of the Arrestee \nStrip Search Named Plaintiffs, and every other Arrestee Strip Search Class \nmember, was subjected to a strip search without an individual determination \nthat the search would reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband. \n216.  Subjecting an arrestee arrested on a non-drug, non-weapon non-violent \nfelony offense to a strip search, without an individual determination that the \nsearch would reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband, violates his or her \nFourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n217.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett knew that the Arrestee Strip Search \nNamed Plaintiffs and other class members would be subjected to these \n60 \n\ni  -niPCrpr'I in t1hp.  searches. \n218.  Defendant's actions, and failures to act as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving forces behind the violations of \nthe Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and the class members' Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n219.  Defendant caused the unreasonable strip searches of the Arrestee Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiffs and all other class members by deliberate \nindifference to the risk of constitutional injury by maintaining and/or \nacquiescing in a policy and practice and custom of strip searching arrestees. \n220.

The City of Atlanta, acting through its mayor and council, knew that \nthe Fulton Defendant Fulton County and the Board were deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs and the \nOverdetention Class class members to be released by midnight of their \nRelease Dates. \n74 \n\nr  i \nnor)  TL\u001e ftia.. -CA }l..\u001eF~'~ .7.,l;l,ovofn ;nr~if+pronra to }h P rtaht.s nf t.-hp \n\\7VCIUCLC11L1V1i iVCi111GU i i<tiiuiiiu uiau`vuv  \" ~ .v~a°... ...~. n..,. ..,...  -.--~---..-- ntnFa \nreieasea~  iu  y ullul7 lltj il.l L VIf  ~bl1_1 C1' 1 D14,G.11,C..fQ.

This is an action brought by C.  Alan Powell, Tory Dunlap, Lee Antonio \nSmith and David Evans (the \"Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs\") on his \nown behalf and on behalf of a class of individuals (\"Arrestee Strip Search\") \nwho were injured by Defendant Jacqueline Barrett's conduct in causing them \nto be subjected to blanket strip searches (described below) upon their arrest \nand commitment to the Fulton County Jail;  by Defendant Jacqueline \nBarrett's deliberate indifference to the strip searches;  by her failure to train, \nsupervise and/or discipline her staff, and by her failure to promulgate and \nenforce policies. \n2.  This is also an action brought by each of C. Alan Powell, Tory Dunlap, \nLee Antonio Smith, and David Evans (the \"Overdetention Named \n2 \n\nPlaintiffs\") on his own behalf and on behalf of the class defined below \ninjured, or who are being injured, or who will be injured in the future by \nthe Fulton County Jail's pattern and practice of overdetaining inmates. \nThey will be further injured by Defendant Jacqueline Barrett's deliberate \nindifference to the overdetentions, and by her failure to train, supervise \nand/or discipline her staff, and by her failure to promulgate and enforce \npolicies.  To \"overdetain\" means to hold an inmate in the Fulton County \nJail, including any of its annexes, past midnight of his or her release date, \nas defined below \n3.  This is also an action brought by David Evans (the \"Court Return Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiff') on his own behalf and on behalf of a class of \nindividuals (\"Court Return Strip Search Class\") who were injured by \nDefendant Jacqueline Barrett's conduct in subjecting them to blanket strip \nsearches (described below) after they were returned from Superior Court or \nState Court to the Fulton County Jail after a judge ordered their release, and \nafter there was no longer a basis for their detention.  They were further \ninjured by Jacqueline Barrett's deliberate indifference to the practice of strip \nsearches;  her failure to train, supervise and/or discipline her staff, and by her \nfailure to promulgate and enforce policies. \n3 \n\n4.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action against \nDefendant Jacqueline Barrett under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1871, 42 U.S.C.  §1983, to enforce the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments, for injuries suffered by them and other members of the \nclass at the Fulton County Jail.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs also base their claims on the Constitution of the State of \nGeorgia and the common law of the State of Georgia. \n5.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs bring this action against \nDefendant Jacqueline Barrett under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1871, 42 U.S.C.  §1983, to enforce the Fourth, Eighth, and \nFourteenth Amendments, for injuries suffered by them and other \nmembers of the class at the Fulton County Jail.  The Overdetention \nNamed Plaintiffs also base their claims on the Constitution of the State \nof Georgia and the common law of the State of Georgia. \n6.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff brings this action \nagainst Defendant Jacqueline Barrett under Section 1983 of the Civil \nRights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.  §1983, to enforce the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments, for injuries suffered by him and the class. \nThe Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff also bases his claims on \n4 \n\nthe Constitution of the State of Georgia and the common law of the \nState of Georgia. \nJurisdiction and Venue \n7.  This Court has jurisdiction over the Arrestee Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs and the Court \nReturn Strip Search Named Plaintiffs §1983 claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C.  § 1331 and 28 U.S.C.  § 1343(a)(3).  This Court has supplemental \njurisdiction over their state law claims under 28 U.S.C.  § 1367. \n8.  Venue is appropriate in this District and this division.  Each of the \nclaims for relief arose in this judicial district and this division. \nClass Action Allegations \n\"Arrestee Strip Search Class\" - Class Action Allevations \n9.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure on behalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the two \nyears preceding the filing of this action up until the date this case is \nterminated, was or will be, (i) upon being arrested and committed into \nthe Fulton County Jail;  (ii) on a charge other than a charge of drugs, \n5 \n\nweapon or felony violence;  (iii) was subjected to a blanket strip search \nwithout any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable \ncause that he or she was concealing drugs, weapons or other \ncontraband. \n10.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \nis appropriate because the Fulton County Jail has a policy, and engages \nin a pattern and practice of conduct that has uniformly affected all \nmembers of the class.  Injunctive relief against Defendant to enjoin the \npractice will benefit each and every Arrestee Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and class member. \n11.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed policy and practice of subjecting arrest.ees to blanket strip \nsearches without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause that he or she was concealing drugs, weapons or other \ncontraband. \n12.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(6)(3) \nis also appropriate in that common questions of law and fact \npredominate over any individual questions.  A class action is superior \nfor the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy as detailed \n6 \n\nbelow. \n13.  Regarding the Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and members of \nthe class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability. \nEvery arrestee committed into the Fulton County Jail is subjected to \nthe blanket searches.  None of the staff of the Fulton County Jail keeps \nrecords of the searches.  Therefore.  Defendant cannot show that any of \nthe searches were conducted based on an individual determination of \nreasonable suspicion.  Should records exist demonstrating such \nindividualized suspicion, such people would, by definition, not be \nmembers of the class. \n14.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na.  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett instituted a policy, or \nacquiesced in a custom and practice of subjecting arrestees \ncommitted to the Fulton County Jail pending presentment to \nblanket strip searches without an individualized determination \nthat the arrestees were in possession of drugs, weapons or other \ncontraband; \nb.  whether such policy or practice, if found to exist, violates the \n7 \n\nFourth Amendment; \nc.  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett was deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of such arrestees; \nd.  whether the Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class have sustained damages and, if so, the \nproper measure of such damages; \ne.  whether the Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class and future members are entitled to \nequitable relief and, if so, what is the nature of that relief;  and \nf.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for \ndetermination of all class members' damages except those who \nopt out. \ng.  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to qualified \nimmunity on the §1983 claims;  and \nh.  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to \ngovernmental immunity on the state law claims. \n8 \n\n15.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but \nis likely to consist of at least many hundreds of people. \n16.  Every week at least 100 persons meeting the Arrestee Strip Search Class \nclass definition are committed into the Fulton County Jail pending \npresentment and subject to the illegal searches.  Thus this class well exceeds \n10,000 members. \n17.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and the Fulton County Jail have within \ntheir records the names and addresses of all current and past class members \nin the Fulton County Jail computer systems (CJUS, JDL and Banner and \nMainframe), logbooks and other paper records maintained by the Fulton \nCounty Jail. \n18.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class, because the Arrestee Strip Search \nFramed Plaintiffs and all other members of the class were injured by exactly \nthe same means;  that is, by the blanket strip searches. \n19.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class.  They have retained counsel \n9 \n\nwho are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class \naction litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n20.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are \ncontrary to, or in conflict with, those of the class. \n21.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that \nwill be encountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude \nits maintenance as a class action.  The class action is superior to any other \navailable means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Arrestee Strip \nSearch Class.  The class action will be manageable because so many different \nrecords systems exist from which to ascertain the members of the putative \nclass, and damages can be determined on a class-wide basis using a damages \nmatrix set by a jury, or by trying the damages of a statistically valid sample \nof the class to a jury and extrapolating those damages to the class as a whole. \n22.  Class treatment will be superior because liability can be determined on a \nclass-wide basis.  Damages can also be determined on a class-wide basis \nthrough use of statistical sampling. \n\"Overdetention Class\" - Class Action Allegations \n23.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules 23(a), \n10 \n\n23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a \nclass consisting of:  (a) each person who has been, is, or who will be \nincarcerated in any Fulton County Jail facility in the two years preceding the \nfiling of this action up to and until the date this case is terminated;  and (b) \nwho was not released or, in the future, will not be released by midnight on the \ndate on which the person is entitled to be released by court order, posting \nbail, or the date on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise \nexpired. \n24.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because Defendant Jacqueline Barrett implemented a policy, or \nengages in a pattern and practice of conduct that has uniformly affected all \nmembers of the class., Injunctive relief against Defendant Jacqueline Barrett \nwill benefit each and every Overdetention Named Plaintiff and class member. \n25.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above \ndescribed policy and practice of overdetentions. \n26.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions.  A class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below. \n11 \n\n27.  Regarding the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs and members of the class, \nthere are no individual questions on the issue of liability other than whether \nan individual has been overdetained.  The answer to that question can be \ndetermined by ministerial inspection of the jail's records. \n28.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na)  whether the Constitution provides a bright line, maximum length \nof time measured in hours beyond which Defendant cannot hold a \nperson before releasing that person from jail after a judge has \nordered his release or he has posted bail, or the basis for his \ndetention has otherwise expired; \nb)  whether Defendants leave exceeded that maximum for each class \nmember; \nc)  whether there is a pattern and practice of the Fulton County Jail \nof holding inmates past their Release Dates; \nd)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett has been deliberately \nindifferent to the pattern and practice of the Fulton County Jail \nof holding inmates past their Release Dates; \ne)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett's acts as alleged herein \n12 \n\nviolate the Constitution of the United States by holding detainees \nand inmates past their release dates: \nwhether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fourth and/or \nFourteenth Amendments; \ng)  whether Jacqueline Barrett was deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of inmates and detainees in the custody of the Fulton \nCounty Jail; \nh) whether the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs and the members of \nthe Overdetention Class have sustained damages and, if so, the \nproper measure of such damages; \ni)  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for \ndetermination of all class members' damages except those who opt \nout. \nj)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to qualified \nimmunity on the section 1983 claims;  and \nk)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to \ngovernmental immunity on the state law claims. \n13 \n\n29.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but \nis likely to consist of at least many hundreds of people. \n30.  Every week at least 100 persons meeting the Overdetention Class \ndefinition axe released from the Fulton County Jail.  Thus, this class well \nexceeds 10,000 members. \n31.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and the Fulton County Jail have within \ntheir records the names and addresses of all current and past class members \nin the Fulton County Jail computes- systems (CJUS, JDL and Banner and \nMainframe), logbooks and other paper records maintained by the Fulton \nCounty Jail. \n32.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of \nthe other members of the class, because the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs \nand all other members of the class were injured by exactly the same means; \nthat is, by the systemic collapse of the inmate management system, and the \npractice of returning in-custody defendants entitled to release by virtue of \ntheir court appearances from the courthouses to the Fulton County Jail to \ncheck for wants, holds and detainers. \n14 \n\n33.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the members of the class.  They have retained counsel who \nare competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action \nlitigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n34.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are contrary \nto, or in conflict with, those of the class. \n35.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be \nencountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its \nmaintenance as a class action.  The class action is superior to any other \navailable means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Overdetention \nClass.  The class action will be manageable because so many different records \nsystems exist.  from which to ascertain the members of the putative class, and \ndamages can be determined on a class wide basis using a damages matrix set \nby a jury or by trying the damages of a statistically valid sample of the class \nto a jury and extrapolating those damages to the class as a whole. \n36.  Class treatment.  will be superior because liability can be determined on a \nclass wide basis.  Damages can also be determined on a class wide basis \nthrough use of statistical sampling. \n15 \n\n\"Court Return Strip Search Class\" - Class Action Allegations \n37.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff brings this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(U) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of a class consisting of:  each person who, in the two years preceding the \nfiling of this action up until the date this case is terminated, has been, is or \nwill be:  (i) in the custody of the Fulton County Jail;  (ii) taken to court from \nthe Fulton County Jail;  (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise \nbecame entitled to release by virtue of the court appearance because the \ncharge on which he had been held was no longer pending or was dismissed at \nthe hearing, was ordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted \nbail, was sentenced to time served, was acquitted or was otherwise entitled to \nrelease;  (iv) was not the subject of any other pending case or cases which \nimposed any condition of release other than personal recognizance;  (v) was \nnot the subject of any detainer or warrant;  (vi) was returned to the Fulton \nCounty Jail;  and (vii) was subjected to a strip search without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons before being released, regardless of \nwhether he was overdetained. \n38.  Certification of the Court Return Strip Search Class under Federal Rule \n16 \n\nof Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate because Defendant Jacqueline \nBarrett implemented a policy, and/or acquiesces in a pattern and practice of \nconduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class.  Injunctive relief \nagainst Defendant will benefit each and every Overdetention Named Plaintiff \nand class member. \n39.  The Court Return Strip Search Class is entitled to injunctive relief of \nterminating the above-described policy of subjecting court returns entitled to \nrelease by virtue of their court appearances to strip searches without any \nindividualized findings of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that the \ncourt returns were concealing contraband or weapons. \n40.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate in that common questions of law and fact predominate over \nany individual questions.  A class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below. \n41 .  Regarding the Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff and members \nof the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability because \nevery court return returned to the Fulton County Jail is subjected to the \nblanket searches.  No records of the searches are kept.  Defendant Jacqueline \nBarrett cannot show that any of the searches were conducted based on an \n17 \n\nindividual determination of reasonable suspicion.  Should records exist \ndemonstrating such individualized suspicion, such people would, by \ndefinition, not be members of the class. \n42.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na.  whether there is a policy, custom and practice of subjecting court \nreturns entitled to release by virtue of their court appearances returned \nto the Fulton County Jail to blanket strip searches without an \nindividualized determination that the person was in possession of \ndrugs, weapons or other contraband; \nb.  whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fourth \nAmendment; \nc.  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett was deliberately indifferent \nto the lights of such court returns by acquiescing in the strip searches; \nd.  whether the Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff and the \nmembers of the class have sustained damages and, if so, the proper \nmeasure of such damages; \ne.  whether the Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff, the \nmembers of the class, and future members are entitled to equitable \n18 \n\nrelief and, if so,  the nature of that relief;  and \nf.  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically \nrepresentative sample of the class provides the basis for determination \nof all class members' damages except those who opt out. \ng.  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to qualified \nimmunity on the section 1983 claims;  and \nh.  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to governmental \nimmunity on the state law claims. \n43.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nThe exact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but \nis likely to consist of at least many hundreds of people. \n44.  Every week at least 100 persons meeting the Court Return Strip Search \nClass definition are committed into the Fulton County Jail pending \npresentment and subjected to the illegal searches.  Thus this class well \nexceeds 10,000 members. \n45.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and the Fulton County Jail have within \ntheir records the names and addresses of all current and past Court Return \nStrip Search Class members in the Fulton County Jail computer systems \n19 \n\n(CJUS, JDL and Banner and Mainframe), logbooks and other paper records \nmaintained by the Fulton County Jail. \n46.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff's claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class, because the Court Return Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiff and all other members of the class were injured by \nexactly the same means;  that is, by the blanket searches. \n47.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class.  He has retained counsel \nwho are competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class \naction litigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n48.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff has no interests that are \ncontrary to, or in conflict with, those of the class. \n49.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff knows of no difficulty \nthat will be encountered in the management of this litigation that would \npreclude its maintenance as a class action.  The class action is superior to any \nother available means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Court \nReturn Strip Search Class.  The class action will be manageable because so \nmany different records systems exist from which to ascertain the members of \n20 \n\nthe putative class.  Damages can be determined on a class-wide basis using a \ndamages matrix set by a jury, or by trying the damages of a statistically valid \nsample of the class to a jury and extrapolating those damages to the class as a \nwhole. \n50.  Class treatment will be superior because liability can be determined on a \nclass-wide basis, and damages can also be determined on a class-wide basis \nthrough use of statistical sampling. \nPARTIES \n51.

She is sued in \nher official and in her individual capacity for money damages. \n56.  At all times described herein Defendant Jacqueline Barrett was acting \nunder color of state law. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nFulton County Jail's Pattern And Practice Of Overdetentions and Illegally \nStrip Searching Arrestees and Court Returns \nIntroduction and Description of the Overdetention Problem \n57.  The Fulton County Jail has a long and documented history of \noverdetaining detainees and inmates past their release dates. \n58.  \"Overdetain\" means holding an inmate in Fulton County Jail custody \npast the person's release date. \n59.  \"Release Date\" for each inmate is the day on which the person is entitled \nto be released by court order, or the date on which the basis for his or her \ndetention has otherwise expired, for example by posting bond. \n22 \n\n60.  18 USCA §3624(a) requires that an inmate shall be released on the date \nof the expiration of the inmate's term of imprisonment, less any time credited \ntoward the service of the inmate's sentence.  18 USCA § 3624(a). \n61.  \"Exit Date\" for each inmate means the date on which he or she was \nactually released from the custody of the Fulton County Jail. \n62.  Overdetentions happen at practically every event in the criminal justice \nsystem from arrest to trial. \n63.  The problem starts when inmates are committed into the Fulton County \nJail without being \"booked\" in;  that is, fingerprinted, identified checked for \noutstanding wants, holds, warrants and detainees, and entered into the \ncomputerized inmate management system. \n64.  For example, Plaintiff Alan Powell was arrested and committed into the \nFulton County Jail early on the morning of Saturday, March 20, 2004.  He \nwas not booked in until approximately 6:00 p.m.  the following day;  Sunday, \nMarch 21, 2004 . \n65.  As a result, Mr.  Powell was not taken to the misdemeanor court in State \nCourt for First Appearance, and so was not given a bond hearing. \n23 \n\n66.  Moreover, even though Mr.  Powell was entitled to bail based on a \nschedule for minor offenses, jail staff told him that he could not be released on \nbail until after he was booked. \n67.  Finally, on the evening of Sunday, March 21, 2004, Mr.  Powell was \nformerly booked into the jail. \n68.  Along with the booking procedure came a degrading, humiliating strip \nsearch. \n69.  Mr.  Powell, and everyone else booked into the Fulton County Jail on \nSunday night (or any other night or day), was taken to a large room, told to \ntake off all clothes, put them in a plastic box, and take a shower with the \nwhole group in a single large room. \n70.  Then, each man took his clothes to a counter and exchanged his own \nclothes for a jail jumpsuit. \n71.  Before picking up his jumpsuit.  Mr.  Powell, along with every other \ninmate in the process, had to stand before a guard front and center, and show \nhis front and back sides while naked. \n72.  Mr.  Powell's family posted his bond Sunday March 21, 2004. \n24 \n\n73.  However, Mr.  Powell was not released.  When he complained, guards \nthreatened to \"lose\" his paperwork. \n74.  Mr.  Powell was finally released on Tuesday morning, March 23, 2004. \n75.  The jail frequently sends recently arrested inmates to bond hearings at \nState Court before the inmates have been booked in. \n76.  As a result, the bond hearings are meaningless because the inmates \ncannot be either charged or bonded out. \n77.  Without the paperwork generated by a booking, prosecutors lack the \ndocumentation necessary to show probable cause.  Without probable cause, \njudges are forced to throw out cases within 48 hours. \n78.  On March 18, 2004, Judge Roy Roberts in State Court dismissed \nmisdemeanor charges against 22 defendants because they were presented in \nhis courtroom without paperwork.  They had been sent to court without \nhaving been booked. \n79.  However, even when a judge orders inmates released at the first \nappearance, their release is no sure thing. \n25 \n\n80.  During the period March 18-31, 2004, of'the approximately 135 persons \npresented before the magistrate for a probable cause hearing, almost every \nsingle one was overdetained for periods ranging from one day to twelve days \n(see chart below). \n81.  Moreover, to add insult to injury, every single inmate returning from \ncourt, even those whose cases have been dismissed, was subjected to a strip \nsearch, after a judge had ordered his release. \nJacqueline Barrett's Responsibilities For Inmates At The Fulton County Jail \n82.  Jacqueline Barrett is the Sheriff of Fulton County. \n83.  Jacqueline Barrett has been the Sheriff of Fulton County since 1992. \n84.  Jacqueline Barrett's duties include formulating, implementing and \nexecuting policies concerning the operation of the Fulton County Jail \nfacilities. This includes promulgating regulations ensuring the release of \ninmates on their Release Dates, and policies controlling the strip searches of \ninmates. \n85.  Jacqueline Barrett has ultimate training, supervisory, and disciplinary \nauthority for all operations of the Fulton County Jail. \n26 \n\n86.  Jacqueline Barrett is also responsible for ensuring that each employee of \nthe Fulton County Jail discharges his or her duties in accordance with the \nlaw and court orders. \n87.  The American Correctional Association's Standards for Adult Local \nDetention Facilities require that a detention facility maintain an inmate \npopulation accounting system that includes records on the admission, \nprocessing, and release of inmates.  American Correctional Association's \nStandards for Adult Local Detention Facilities, 3d, 3-ALDF-IF-O1 to -11 .  The \nsame standards require a detention facility to record for every person booked \ninto the facility the date and duration of confinement, and a copy of the court \norder or other basis of confinement. \n88.  The standards also require a detention facility to make a determination \nat the time a new inmate is admitted to the facility that the inmate is legally \ncommitted to the facility. \n89.  The Records Office is the unit of the Fulton County Jail that has \nresponsibility for keeping track of inmates and ensuring their release \naccording to their Release Dates. \n27 \n\n90.  Jacqueline Barrett is ultimately responsible for the functioning of the \nFulton County Jail's Records Office, as defined below, and all other units of \nthe Fulton County Jail. \n91.  Jacqueline Barrett had, and continues to have the duty to establish \nprocedures and policies, and to train and monitor Fulton County Jail \nemployees in order to ensure the release on their Release Dates of all \ninmates in the custody of the Fulton County Jail. \n92.  Jacqueline Barret.t.  had, and continues to have the duty to establish \nprocedures and policies, and to train and monitor Jail employees in order to \nprevent unreasonable strip searches of individuals who are in Jail custody. \nThe Fulton County Jail \n93.  The Fulton County Jail is the primary facility used by Fulton County to \nhouse inmates in Fulton County. \n94.  Built to house about 1,450 inmates, the Fulton County Jail opened with \nmany cells holding extra bunks to raise bed capacity to 2.250. \n95.  Currently, the jail has about 2,900 inmates, with 400 others in two \nannexes.  \"That is more than double what should be in the jail,\" according to a \nknowledgeable person surnamed Rosser. \n28 \n\n96.  Most of the inmates at the Fulton County Jail are either pre-trial \ndetainees, misdemeanants serving sentences, or probation violators. \nThe Inmate Management Svstem \n97.  The records office located at the Fulton County Jail (\"Records Office\") is \nresponsible for administering and maintaining the records, including the \njudgment and commitment files, of all persons housed at the Fulton County \nJail. \n98.  The Records Office is responsible for ensuring that all persons housed at \nthe Fulton County Jail are released according to their Release Dates. \n99.  Release and commitment data entered into the court computer systems by \ncourtroom clerks do not appear in the computer system used by the Records \nOffice for several days. \n100. As a result, all release and commitment orders generated by judges in \nthe Superior and State Courts on paper must be faxed to the Fulton County \nJail or hand carried to the Records Office by deputies as inmates are bused \nfrom the courthouse to the Fulton County Jail. \n101.  Some release orders are faxed from the courthouses to the Fulton County \nJail. \n29 \n\n102.  All processing of release and commitment orders must be done by hand \nat the Records Office located at the I?ulton County Jail. \nThe Fulton County Jail Policy and Procedure for Booking Inmates into the \nFulton County Jail and Strip Searching Then \n103.  Every person booked into the Fulton County Jail is subjected to a strip \nsearch conducted without an individual determination of reasonable suspicion \nto justify the search, and regardless of the crime with which the person is \ncharged. \n104.  The strip search process involves having the arrested person go into a \nlarge room with a group of thirty to forty other inmates, remove all of his \nclothing, and place it in boxes. \n105.  The arrested person, along with the group, takes a shower and is then \nsprayed with delousing agent. \n106.  Each arrestee then either singly, or standing in a line with others, is \nvisually inspected front and back by deputies. \n107.  The Fulton County Jail does not keep any logs or other records of any \nindividual strip searches performed in the booking areas. \n30 \n\n108.  When inmates are \"booked\" into the Fulton County Jail, the jail staff \nchecks criminal databases to see whether the inmate is the subject of any \nother wants.  holds or detainers from other jurisdictions.  If there are such \nholds, the information is noted in the inmate's institutional files. \n709.  Whether the inmate is the subject of any other wants, holds or detainees \nfrom other jurisdictions is also available in real time on the \"Mainframe\" \ncomputer, available to Records Office staff and deputies. \nThe Fulton County Jail Policy and Procedure for Processing Court Returns \n110. The Sheriff follows a policy and practice under which every in-custody \ndefendant taken from the Fulton County Jail to the Superior Court or the \nState Court for a hearing, and ordered released by a judicial officer because \nthe charge was no longer pending, or because of a change in conditions of \nrelease or some other reason, and is returned to the Fulton County Jail to \ncheck for wants and holds and detainees rather than being released from the \ncourthouse. \n31 \n\n111.  Every weekday about 100 to 150 in-custody defendants are transported \nto the Superior Court and State Court for court appearances, and then \nreturned to the Fulton County Jail after their court appearances (\"court \nreturns\"). \n112. The in-custody defendants are under the constant supervision of Fulton \nCounty Sheriff's deputies while in transit, and while at the courthouses. \n113.  While at the courthouse, in-custody defendants are not allowed to have \ncontact with anyone apart from Fulton County Sheriffs deputies, except for \nnon-contact visits in the lockups with attorneys subject to supervision by \nFulton County Sheriffs deputies. \n114.  In-custody defendants whose cases have been discharged are not.  given \nthe option of being discharged from the courthouse. \n115.  Every in-custody defendant transported to the Superior Court or the \nState Court for a court event is sent back to the Fulton County Jail following \nhis court appearance, even if there is a judicial determination that there is no \nlonger a basis for his detention. \n116.  The Fulton County Jail returns court returns with release orders back to \nthe Fulton County Jail so the Records Office can check for any warrants, \n32 \n\ndetainers or holds on them before releasing them. \n117.  Court returns entitled to release are booked back into the Fulton County \nJail general populations and not released until a later date. \n118 .  The jail staff checks the Mainframe for wants, holds and detainers before \nreleasing an inmate. \nThe Fulton County Jail's Policy and Procedure of Strip Searching all Court \nReturns \n119.  Upon returning to the Fulton County Jail, inmates are separated by sex, \nmales into one area and females into another area. \n120.  Staff subjects every court return returned to the Fulton County Jail to a \nstrip search without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause that the person is concealing contraband or weapons. \n121.  Staff subjects every court return returned to the Fulton County Jail to a \nstrip search without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or \nprobable cause that the person is concealing contraband or weapons, even if \nthe person has been ordered released by a judge and there is no other basis \nfor his continued detention. \n33 \n\n122.  The standard strip search procedure of the Fulton County Jail for all \ninmates booked into the facility, whether new commitments or court returns \nwho have been ordered released, is the complete removal of all clothing and a \nvisual strip search. \n123.  The Fulton County Jail does not keep any logs or other records of any \nindividual strip searches performed on court returns. \nThe Cause of the Overdetention - Collapse of the Inmate Management \nSystem \n124.  The cause of the overdetention and illegal strip search problems is the \ndeliberate indifference of Defendant Jacqueline Barrett to the rights of \ninmates to be released on their Release Dates, inasmuch as the Fulton \nCounty Jail has no effective inmate management system that can ensure \nrelease of inmates by their Release Dates. \n125.  The fact that the Fulton County Jail has no effective inmate \nmanagement system has been documented by a series of reports and \nnewspaper articles, as well as by court cases dating back many years. \n126.  The Fulton County Jail has recently aggravated the backlog of \noverdetained inmates by overreacting to a string of premature releases. \n34 \n\n127.  The Fulton County Jail's policy of returning all court returns, even those \nwhose cases have been dismissed, back to the jail for processing swells the \nbacklog of unprocessed inmates.  This policy and practice is a major \ncontributing cause of the Records Office's inability to process and release \nindividuals on their Release Dates. \n128.  The Fulton County Jail's policy of returning all court returns, even those \nwhose cases have been dismissed, back to the jail for processing costs \ntaxpayers money, swells the population of the facilities unnecessarily, and \ncauses inmate unrest. \n129.  The policy of returning court returns entitled to release creates the court \nreturn strip search problem.  If the court returns entitled to release by virtue \nof their court appearances were released at the courthouse, they would not be \nbooked back in and strip searched in the first place. \n130.  The inability of the Fulton County Jail to process and release individuals \non their Release Dates leads to their being overdetained and illegally strip \nsearched. \n35 \n\nDefendant Jacqueline Barrett's Knowledge of the Collapse of the Inmate \nManagement System at the Fulton County Jail \n131.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett has known of the ineffective and chaotic \ncondition of the Records Office inmate management system for years. \n132. Moreover, jail officials have had personal knowledge of the problem for \nyears. \n133. The Fulton County Commission has also been aware of the above- \ndescribed problems in the inmate management system for years. \nDefendant Jacqueline Barrett's Failure to Take Meaningful, Sustained \nCorrective Action \n134.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett has acquiesced in the Records Office's \nchaotic procedures leading to the overdetention and strip search problems by \nfailing to take any meaningful, sustained corrective action. \n135.  The Fulton County Jail is understaffed.  Only about 650 guards watch \nover 2,900 inmates. \n136.  Fulton County has refused to provide adequate funding to the Fulton \nCounty Jail. \n36 \n\n137.  Last year, the Fulton County Commission reduced the jail's funding by \n$3,000,000. \nThe Collapse of the Inmate Management System - A Lonestanding, \nPervasive and Continuing Problem Known to Defendant Jacqueline Barrett \nand Jail Officials and County Officials \n138.  Both overdetentions and premature releases are symptomatic of a non- \nfunctioning inmate management system. \n139.  Recent notorious examples of overdetention show the overdetention and \nstrip search problems persist. \n140.  Eight jail inmates were released by error over the past year, including \nmurder suspect James Cooper, 28, charged with the April slaying of John \nAtkins, a self-service-laundry operator. \n141 .  James Cooper was released in November on what jail spokepersons \ncalled a \"clerical error.\" \n142.  Some premature releases over the past 15 months involving Fulton \nCounty Jail inmates: \n37 \n\n143.  May 14:  Terrence Tutman, a material witness in a 1999 killing, is picked \nup after hiding from subpoena servers for seven months.  He is mistakenly \nreleased the next day after being misidentified. \n144.  June 19:  Rape suspect Jesse Henry is mistakenly set free when a deputy \nassigns to Henry a bond actually paid for another prisoner.  Henry is \ncaptured five days later. \n145.  Nov.  8:  Murder and robbery suspect James Cooper is mistakenly \nreleased when an employee lets the wrong James Cooper go.  He turns \nhimself in Dec.  8. \n146.  March 4.  2004:  Shoplifting suspect Kenneth Dodd is freed after a \ncomputer operator overlooks an outstanding warrant.  He is recaptured the \nsame day. \n147. March 4:  Burglary suspect Sterling Bruno is let go because jail \nsupervisors do not follow \"double check\" release policies.  He is recaptured the \nsame day. \n148.  Kenneth Dodd, 44, awaiting trial for alleged shoplifting, was released \nwhen a computer operator overlooked an outstanding warrant that would \nhave kept him in custody. \n38 \n\n149.  Sterling Bruno, 31, was let go because jail supervisors did not follow \n\"double check\" release policies, according to Defendant Jacqueline Barrett. \n150.  Recently Defendant Jacqueline Barrett released a statement terming \ncontinuing problems at the crowded and understaffed jail a \"state of \nemergency.\" \n151.  The chart set forth below shows how pervasive and widespread the \noverdetention problem is. \n152.

Inmates routinely have to obtain attorneys or inmate rights \norganizations on the outside to call the Records Office just to obtain release in \naccordance with their Release Dates. \n154.  On information and belief, at any one time up to 5-20% of the Fulton \nCounty Jail population is being held past their Release Dates. \n155.  The policies of the Fulton County Jail, and the overcrowding, cascade \ninto larger problems. \n49 \n\n156. The Sheriff returns all in-custody defendants from the courtrooms to the \njail to the cells they occupied before court, after they have been ordered \nreleased, in order to check for wants and holds in other cases. \n157.  The court returns swell the backlog in an already overcrowded system . \n158.  Because the system is plagued by erroneous releases of persons released \nbefore their release dates, the jail imposes extra release checks that would \nnot be needed in a functioning Records Office, thereby further slowing an \nalready overclogged, backlogged system. \n159.  Many inmates are not processed and booked into the jail's computerized \nimnate management system for a day or more after commitment, in many \ncases after the first appearance. \n160.  Failing to book persons in upon commitment prohibits these inmates \nfrom being released before first appearance under a bond set by schedule; \npersons cannot be bonded out until they have been entered into the system. \n161.  Persons who have not been booked in until after first appearance cannot \nbe released promptly because they must be booked in before wants and holds \nchecks can be run on them and they have been booked in. \n50 \n\n162.  Many inmates held at the Fulton County Jail are overdetained by 24 \nhours or more because the breakdown of the inmate management system has \nresulted in a backlog of inmates awaiting release.  Therefore, inmates who \nhave been ordered released by a judge are held one or more days past their \nRelease Dates. \nArrestee Strip Searches Performed By the Fulton County Jail \n163.

She \nfurther failed to implement policies and, as a result, such employees were \nincompetent to perform their duties. \n64 \n\n222.  This negligent training, and negligent failure to train and supervise, and \nfailure to implement policies by Defendant Jacqueline Barrett resulted in the \ncomplete breakdown in the inmate management system of the Fulton County \nJail.  These failures have caused the overdetent.ion of The Overdetention \nNamed Plaintiffs and the other members of the putative class. \n223.  As a result of said negligence of Defendant Jacqueline Barrett, The \nOverdet.ent.ion Named Plaintiffs suffered injuries described in the preceding \nparagraphs of this Complaint. \nCLAIMS OF COURT RETURN STRIP SEARCH NAMED PLAINTIFF \nCount 5 \nSection 1983 Claim of Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff \n224.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff realleges and \nincorporates by reference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n225.  Upon returning from the Superior Court or State Court to the Fulton \nCounty Jail after court hearings at which a judge ordered him released, the \nCourt Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff, and every other Court Return \nStrip Search Class member, was subjected to a strip search without an \n65 \n\nindividual determination that the search would reveal weapons, drugs or \nother contraband. \n226.  Subjecting court returns entitled to release by virtue of their court \nappearances to strip searches without an individual determination that the \nsearch would reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband violates their Fourth \nAmendment and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n227.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett knew that the Court Return Strip Search \nNamed Plaintiff and other class members would be subjected to searches in \nthe Fulton County Jail, and acquiesced in such searches. \n228.  Defendant's actions, and failure to act as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were and are the moving forces behind the \nviolations of the Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff and the class \nmembers' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n229.  Defendant caused the unreasonable strip searches of the Court Return \nStrip Search Named Plaintiff and all other class members by deliberate \nindifference to the risk of constitutional injury by maintaining and/or \nacquiescing in a policy and practice and custom of strip searching arrestees. \n66 \n\n230 .  Defendant is therefore liable under 42 U.S.C.  §1983 for constitutional \ninjuries to the Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff and all other class \nmembers caused by their conduct. \nCount 6 \nNegligent Training and Negligent Supervision and Failure to Implement \nPolicies Regarding Searches of Court Return Strip Search Class Members \n231.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiff realleges and \nincorporates by reference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n232.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett entrusted certain duties, including but not \nlimited to, searching all court returns booked hack into the Fulton County \nJail to certain jail employees. \n67 \n\n233.  Therefore, Defendant Jacqueline Barrett had a duty to exercise \nreasonable care in training,  supervising, and disciplining such employees in \nexercising their duties. \n234.  The need for such training was obvious from the nature of the \nresponsibilities entrusted to such jail employees. \n235.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett deliberately failed to implement and \nenforce procedures employees under her supervision and control needed to \nensure the constitutional searches of court returns entitled to release by \nvirtue of their court appearances. \n236.  The problems at the jail described above, and the various reports in the \nmedia should have made it obvious to Defendant Jacqueline Barrett that the \ntraining such employees were receiving was inadequate, the policies in place \nwere inadequate, and that.  as a direct and proximate result of these \ninadequacies,  the inmates under her supervision would suffer injury. \n68 \n\n237.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett negligently trained and supervised, or \nnegligently failed to train and supervise such employees in their duties, and \nfailed to implement policies.  As a direct result of these failures, such \nemployees were incompetent to perform their duties. \n238.  This negligent training, and negligent failure to train and supervise, and \nfailure to implement policies by Defendant Jacqueline Barrett resulted in the \nunconstitutional strip searches of the Court Return Strip Search Named \nPlaintiff and the other members of the putative class. \n239. As a result of said negligence of Defendant Jacqueline Barrett, Court \nReturn Strip Search Named Plaintiff suffered injuries described in the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint. \nIRREPARABLE INJURY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n240.  Defendant is overdetaining members of the plaintiff class, and \nunreasonably subjecting members of the Arrestee Strip Search Class and the \nCourt Return Strip Search Class to strip searches which irreparably harms \nthem, even if they are later able to recover compensatory damages. \n69 \n\n241.  Defendant's overdetaining members of the plaintiff class, and performing \nillegal strip searches of the Arrestee Strip Search Class and the Court Return \nStrip Search Class, has irreparably harmed them and will continue to \nirreparably harm members of the proposed plaintiff Overdetention Class and \nArrestee Strip Search Class and the Court Return Strip Search Class, thus \nmaking declaratory and injunctive relief necessary. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court \ngrant the following relief: \n1.  grant a jury trial on all claims so triable; \n2.  declare that with respect to the Arrestee Strip Search Class this action \nmay be maintained as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) and certifying the Arrestee Strip Search \nNamed Plaintiffs as the proper representative of the class consisting of each \nperson who, in the two years preceding the filing of this action up until the \ndate this case is terminated, was or will be, (i) upon being arrested and \ncommitted into the Fulton County Jail;  (ii) on a charge other than a charge of \ndrugs, weapon or felony violence;  (iii) was subjected to a blanket strip search \n70 \n\nwithout any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause \nthat he or she was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. \n3.  declare that, with respect to the Overdetention Class, this action may be \nmaintained as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b)(3) and certifying the Overdetention Named \nPlaintiffs as the proper representative of the Overdetention Class consisting \nof class consisting of:  (a) each person who has been, is, or will be incarcerated \nin any Fulton County Jail facility in the two years preceding the filing of this \naction up to and until the date this case is terminated;  and (b) who was not \nreleased, or, in the future, will not be released by midnight on the date on \nwhich the person is entitled to be released by court order, posting bail, or the \ndate on which the basis for his or her detention has otherwise expired. \n4.  declare that with respect to the Court Return Strip Search Class this \naction may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a), 23(b) (2), \nand 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class \nconsisting of:  each person who, in the two years preceding the filing of this \naction up until the date this case is terminated, has been, is or will be:  (i) in \nthe custody of the Fulton County Jail;  (ii) taken to court form the Fulton \n71 \n\nCounty Jail;  (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to \nrelease by virtue of the court appearance because the charge on which he had \nbeen held was no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was \nordered released on his own recognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced \nto time served, was acquitted or was otherwise entitled to release;  (iv) was not \nthe subject of any other pending case or cases which imposed any condition of \nrelease other than personal recognizance;  (v) was not the subject of any \ndetainer or warrant;  (vi) was returned to the Fulton County Jail;  and (vii) \nwas subjected to a strip search without any individualized finding of \nreasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was concealing contraband or \nweapons before being released, regardless of whether he was overdetained. \n5.

CONCLUSION\nPlaintiffs, 11 male former detainees at the Fulton County Jail (the Jail), filed a putative class action under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 against the former and current sheriffs of the Jail (the Sheriffs), Fulton County (the County), the\nmembers of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners (the Board), and the City of Atlanta (the City)\n[1]\n(collectively, Defendants).  In their Fourth Amended Complaint (the Complaint), Plaintiffs claim their\nconstitutional rights were violated when they were subjected at the Jail to \"blanket strip searches,\" or strip\nsearches without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that each Plaintiff was concealing weapons,\ndrugs, or other contraband. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing,\ninter alia, the Sheriffs were entitled to both Eleventh Amendment immunity and qualified immunity and the County\n1297 and City lacked the requisite control over the policies at the Jail to be liable as municipalities *1297 under § 1983.\nIn an order dated July 5, 2005 (the Order), the district court granted in part and denied in part Defendants'\n[2]\nmotions to dismiss.  In this appeal and cross-appeal, the parties challenge the district court's Order. After\nhearing oral argument, considering the parties' briefs, and reviewing the pertinent record, we affirm in part,\n[3]\nreverse in part, and remand in part.\nI. BACKGROUND\nIn the Complaint, Plaintiffs sue former Sheriff Jacqueline Barrett in her individual capacity, current Sheriff Myron\n[4]\nFreeman in his official and individual capacities, the County, the Board,  and the City. Plaintiffs seek both\n[5]\nmonetary damages and injunctive relief against Defendants.  Plaintiffs challenge the blanket strip searches at\nthe Jail on behalf of three putative classes: the Arrestee Strip Search Class (AR Group), Alpha Strip Search Class\n[6]\n(AL Group), and Court Return Strip Search Class (CR Group).  Although the Complaint contains a chart\nshowing the Plaintiffs included in each strip search group, there are some discrepancies between the chart and\nthe allegations in the Complaint. The chart that appears in the appendix to this opinion is consistent with the\nallegations in the Complaint, and we rely on the appended chart for purposes of our opinion. As shown in the\n[7]\nchart, the Plaintiffs and their respective strip search groups are as follows: C. Alan Powell (AR and AL Groups),\n\nDavid Evans (AR and CR Groups), Stanley Clemons (AR Group), Allen Middleton (AR Group), Anthony\nWestbrook (AR Group), Benjamin Blake (AR Group), Harry Witherspoon (AR Group), Antionne Wolf (AR and CR\n1298 Groups), and Kristopher Alan Matkin (AL Group).[8] Plaintiffs identify *1298 three types of blanket strip searches\n[9]\n they contend violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights: (1) blanket strip searches of arrestees\nas part of their point-of-entry booking into the Jail (AR Group); (2) blanket strip searches of detainees who posted\nbond or were ordered released at the Jail before their point-of-entry booking into the Jail was started or\ncompleted (AL Group); and (3) blanket strip searches of detainees who return from a court appearance after\n[10]\nhaving been ordered released in state court (CR Group).\nWe first summarize the factual allegations in the Complaint as they pertain to each group. We then explain the\nclaims against the various Defendants and summarize the district court's rulings on those claims.\nA. Factual Allegations in the Complaint Concerning the Jail's Strip Search Policy\n1. Strip Searches as part of Point-of-Entry Booking into the Jail (AR Group)\n[11]\nAccording to the Complaint, there is a policy at the Jail whereby every male arrestee \"booked\"  into the Jail's\ngeneral population upon entering the Jail, regardless of the crime for which he is arrested, is subjected to a strip\nsearch without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons, drugs,\nor other contraband. Each male arrestee is placed in a room with a group of 30 or 40 other persons, removes all\n[12]\nof his clothing and places it in boxes, and, along with the group, takes a shower.  Each arrestee then either by\nhimself or standing in line with others is visually inspected front and back by deputies. The booking strip search\nprocess is referred to as \"dressing out.\" The AR Group Plaintiffs allege they were subjected to blanket strip\nsearches as part of their point-of-entry booking into the Jail.\n2. Strip Searches after Becoming Entitled to Release at the Jail (AL Group)\nAccording to the Complaint, the Jail's inmate management system is so inefficient that many persons committed\nto the Jail either post bond (or have someone post it for them) or are ordered released at First Appearance\n1299 hearings at the Jail before *1299 their point-of-entry booking into the Jail has been started or completed.[13]\nBecause these detainees were not booked immediately upon entering the Jail, they are subjected to the booking\nprocess 00 including the booking strip searches 00 after posting bond or having been ordered released at the Jail.\n97 97\nPlaintiffs allege that, as a result, there is a practice of subjecting detainees who are to be released to booking\n[14]\nstrip searches before they are released from the Jail.  The AL Group Plaintiffs allege they were subjected to\nbooking strip searches after having posted bond, in the case of Powell, or having been ordered released at a\nFirst Appearance hearing at the Jail, in the case of Matkin. It is not clear why Jail officials included the strip\nsearches as part of the late booking process for the AL Group Plaintiffs given that they were to be released.\nHowever, we assume the AL Group Plaintiffs were strip searched because they were placed into the Jail's\ngeneral population, where they were held while the staff in the Records Room checked for other detention orders,\nwarrants, or holds and processed their release.\n3. Strip Searches upon Returning from Court Appearance (CR Group)\nFurther, Plaintiffs allege the Jail has a policy whereby detainees who have been ordered released by a judge in\nstate court are returned to the Jail following their court appearance instead of being released from the\ncourthouse. Upon their return to the Jail, these detainees are subjected to blanket strip searches and booked\nback into the Jail's general population while the Record Rooms staff checked for other warrants or holds and\n[15]\nprocessed their release.  The CR Group Plaintiffs, Evans and Wolf, allege they were subjected to blanket strip\nsearches upon returning to the Jail after their court appearances. Unlike the AL Group Plaintiffs, the CR Group\n[16]\nPlaintiffs were immediately booked upon entering the Jail and thus were already strip searched once before.\nThe CR Group Plaintiffs allege that, while in transit to and from the Jail and while at the courthouse, they were\nunder constant supervision and were not permitted to have contact with anyone other than the Sheriff's deputies\nand their attorneys. According to the Complaint, the detainees' visits with their attorneys while at the courthouse\nwere \"subject to supervision by the Fulton County Sheriff's deputies.\"\n\nB. Section 1983 Claims based on the Jail's Strip Search Policy\n1300 Plaintiffs assert § 1983 claims against Defendants based on the Jail's policies of *1300 conducting: (1) blanket\nstrip searches of arrestees as part of their point-of-entry booking into the Jail (AR Group); (2) blanket strip\nsearches of detainees who posted bond or were ordered released at the Jail before their point-of-entry booking\ninto the Jail was started or completed (AL Group); and (3) blanket strip searches of detainees who return from a\n[17]\ncourt appearance after having been ordered released in state court (CR Group).\n1. Claims against the Sheriffs\nThe AR, AL, and CR Groups assert § 1983 claims against the Sheriffs in Counts 1, 5, and 9 of the Complaint,\nrespectively. Plaintiffs allege the Sheriffs knew of the strip search policies at the Jail and acquiesced in the strip\nsearches. According to Plaintiffs, the Sheriffs' failure to act was the \"moving force\" behind the constitutional\nviolations and, by maintaining or acquiescing in the strip search policies, the Sheriffs were deliberately indifferent\nto the risk of constitutional injury.\n2. Claims against the County and the Board\nThe AR, AL, and CR Groups assert § 1983 claims against the County and the Board in Counts 3, 7, and 11 of the\nComplaint, respectively. Plaintiffs allege the County and the Board had \"ultimate authority\" over the Jail, failed to\nadequately fund and staff the Jail and the County's criminal justice network, and failed to train the Sheriffs and\ntheir staff.\nAccording to Plaintiffs, the County and the Board have authority to \"maintain and operate facilities for the\ndetention, incarceration or confinement of all persons subject to confinement under the laws of the state, any\ncounty resolution, or any city ordinance.\" They claim the County exercised its authority when it built the current\nJail. According to Plaintiffs, the Board has the power to designate the person who controls the County's\nincarceration facilities, and the Board has designated the sheriff as the person who operates and controls the\nJail. Plaintiffs allege, therefore, that \"the Board, not the sheriff, has ultimate control\" over the Jail.\nPlaintiffs also allege the County, through the Board, sets the budget for the Jail; administers the Fulton County\nCivil Service System, which governs all county employees, including deputies, Records Room staff, and other\nJail staff; maintains a unified pension system for all county employees, including the sheriff and the sheriff's staff;\nand supervises the sheriff's duties to hire, discipline, and fire Jail employees, as well as the sheriff's duties to\nformulate, implement, and execute \"policies concerning the operation of the Fulton County Jail facilities subject to\nthe authority of the Board.\" Lastly, Plaintiffs allege the Board controls and operates the Fulton County Police\nDepartment, which transports the individuals it arrests to the Jail for confinement.\nPlaintiffs allege the County and the Board \"knew or should have known\" of the illegal strip searches at the Jail\n1301 and were \"deliberately indifferent\" to the rights of Plaintiffs to be free from such strip *1301 searches. Plaintiffs\nclaim the County's and the Board's \"deliberate indifference\" was the \"motivating factor\" of Plaintiffs' injuries.\n3. Claims against the City\nThe AR, AL, and CR Groups assert § 1983 claims against the City in Counts 4, 8, and 12 of the Complaint,\nrespectively. Plaintiffs allege the City has control over the Atlanta Police Department's policy of charging persons\narrested within the municipality with either municipal or state offenses and over where to incarcerate those\npersons, even those charged with state offenses.\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs state that, prior to January 1, 2003, the Atlanta Police Department committed all persons it\narrested, even those it charged with state offenses, to a City of Atlanta detention facility instead of the County\nJail. The City detained and assumed responsibility for conducting probable cause hearings for all persons its\nofficers arrested, whether the persons were arrested on state or municipal charges. Persons arrested for state\noffenses for whom probable cause was found were then transferred to the Jail. However, many of the persons\narrested for state offenses had their charges reduced to municipal offenses at their probable cause hearings, and\nthus many arrestees were never transferred to the County Jail.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that during 2002, the mayor developed-and the city council approved-a new policy to \"save\nmoney for the City.\" As of January 1, 2003, the City ceased its policy of committing persons arrested within the\nmunicipality to an Atlanta detention facility and holding their First Appearance hearings there. Instead, under the\nnew policy, the Atlanta Police Department began charging all arrestees with state offenses, whenever possible,\nand committing those persons directly to the Jail, instead of detaining them in the City detention facility as they\nhad previously done.\nAccording to Plaintiffs, the City knew or should have known the Jail had a custom and policy of subjecting the AR,\nAL, and CR Group Plaintiffs to illegal blanket strip searches and still chose to change its policy. Plaintiffs allege\nthe City was \"deliberately indifferent\" to the rights of Plaintiffs, and its deliberate indifference was the \"moving\nforce\" behind Plaintiffs' injuries.\nC. District Court's Order\nIn its Order, the district court addressed Defendants' motions to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Powell v. Barrett, 376 F.Supp.2d 1340 (N.D.Ga.2005).\nIn response to the Sheriffs' motion to dismiss, the district court first determined Sheriff Freeman functions as an\narm of the State and, therefore, is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from claims against him in his official\ncapacity seeking monetary damages. Id. at 1345-46. The district court relied on this Court's decisions in Grech v.\nClayton County, 335 F.3d 1326 (11th Cir.2003) (en banc), Manders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir.2003) (en\nbanc), and Purcell ex rel. Estate of Morgan v. Toombs County, 400 F.3d 1313 (11th Cir.2005), where we stated\nthat a sheriff \"functions as an arm of the State00not [the] County00when promulgating polices and procedures\n97 97\ngoverning conditions of confinement at the [ ] County Jail.\" Powell, 376 F.Supp.2d at 1345 (alterations in original).\nThe district court clarified, however, that the Eleventh Amendment did not foreclose Plaintiffs from seeking\nprospective, injunctive relief against Sheriff Freeman in his official capacity.\n1302 *1302 The district court also determined the Sheriffs were entitled to qualified immunity from Plaintiffs' strip\nsearch claims for monetary damages against the Sheriffs in their individual capacities. Id. at 1346-50. After\nassuming Plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged constitutional violations, the district court determined that Plaintiffs'\nright to be free from blanket strip searches was not clearly established. Id. at 1346 n. 3, 1349. The district court\nanalyzed this Court's decisions in Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2001), and this Court's panel and en\nbanc decisions in Evans v. City of Zebulon, 351 F.3d 485 (11th Cir. 2003),vacated by364 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.\n2004), and Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir.2005) (en banc) (Evans I and Evans II, respectively). Id.\nat 1347-50. It found that because this Circuit had \"perceive[d] room to debate the contours of this constitutional\nright,\" the Sheriffs could not justifiably be charged with having fair warning that conducting strip searches absent\nreasonable suspicion violated the law. Id. at 1349. Accordingly, the district court dismissed the strip search claims\nagainst the Sheriffs in their individual capacities. Id. at 1350.\nIn response to the County's and City's motions to dismiss, the district court agreed the County and the City\n[18]\nlacked the requisite control over the strip search policies at the Jail to be liable under § 1983 for such policies.\nThe district court explained that, with respect to the City, Plaintiffs failed to advance any allegation that the City\n\"controlled\" or was \"actually responsible for\" the strip search practices at the Jail. With respect to the County, the\ndistrict court found the County could not be held liable for the strip search practices at the Jail under Grech and \nManders, explaining that a Georgia sheriff acts as an arm of the state in his or her corrections and detainee-\noversight roles and the County lacks any meaningful authority to direct the sheriff's actions in those regards.\nFurther, the district court rejected Plaintiffs' argument that three \"local constitutional amendments\" applicable only\nto Fulton County gave the County control over the operation of the Jail and treatment of detainees at the Jail. The\ndistrict court explained that it found nothing in the amendments or the Fulton County Code reflecting the Board's \nexercise of any potential authority granted by the amendments. Additionally, it found the amendments did not give\nthe County the authority to direct the policies of the Sheriffs, nor did they alter the established allocation of power\nbetween the Sheriffs and County with respect to corrections.\nThe district court nonetheless concluded Plaintiffs had stated a claim against the County and the City insofar as\nPlaintiffs alleged the County and the City, through their respective police forces, maintained a policy of placing\n\ntheir respective arrestees in the Jail with knowledge of the Jail's unconstitutional practices. According to the\ndistrict court, in addition to the policies at the Jail, Plaintiffs had identified another \"proximate `moving force'\"\nbehind their alleged constitutional violations, namely, the County's and City's policies of placing their arrestees at\nthe Jail. The district court found that, because Georgia law suggests the County and the City do control where\ntheir respective police departments place arrestees, the County and the City could face § 1983 liability for these\n1303 policies. Accordingly, the district court denied *1303 the County's and City's motions to dismiss. Id. at 1356, 1360.\nII. DISCUSSION\nOn appeal, the County and the City maintain they cannot be held liable under § 1983 for their policies of placing\narrestees at the Jail. They argue that because they do not control the policies at the Jail, Plaintiffs' claims against\nthem must be dismissed.\nOn cross-appeal, Plaintiffs contend the district court erred in determining Sheriff Freeman is entitled to Eleventh\nAmendment immunity because, under three local constitutional amendments applicable to Fulton County, the\n[19]\nCounty operates the Jail and thus the Sheriff acts for the County rather than the State of Georgia.  Plaintiffs\nalso cross-appeal the district court's determination that the Sheriffs are entitled to qualified immunity from the\nstrip search claims against them in their individual capacities. Plaintiffs argue their constitutional rights to be free\nfrom blanket strip searches was clearly established at the time they were strip searched at the Jail.\nWe must determine, therefore, whether (1) Sheriff Freeman is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from\nPlaintiffs' strip search claims for monetary damages against him in his official capacity; (2) Sheriff Barrett is\nentitled to qualified immunity from Plaintiffs' strip search claims for monetary damages against her in her\n[20]\nindividual capacity;  and (3) the County and City are subject to municipal liability under § 1983 for Plaintiffs'\nstrip search claims.\nWe note at the outset that we have jurisdiction to consider the issues raised on both appeal and cross-appeal\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Section § 1292(b) permits this Court to review a district court order not\notherwise appealable as an interlocutory decision if the district court certifies that its order \"involves a controlling\nquestion of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal\nfrom the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). The district\ncourt certified the issues addressed in its Order for immediate appeal in an order dated August 1, 2005.\nDefendants timely petitioned and Plaintiffs timely cross-petitioned this Court for permission to appeal the Order,\n[21]\nand we granted the petitions on December 8, 2005.\n1304 *1304 We review the district court's rulings on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo, accepting\nall factual allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Hill v. White, 321 F.3d\n1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003); see also Ass'n for Disabled Americans, Inc. v. Fla. Int'l Univ., 405 F.3d 954, 956 (11th\nCir.2005) (applying de novo standard to district court's grant of a motion to dismiss based upon Eleventh\nAmendment immunity); Dalrymple v. Reno, 334 F.3d 991, 994 (11th Cir.2003) (applying de novo standard to\ndistrict court's decision to grant or deny the defense of qualified immunity on a motion to dismiss). \"While a\ncomplaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's\nobligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a\nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, ___ U.S. ___, 127\nS.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citations and internal quotations omitted). A complaint is subject to\ndismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) when the allegations in the complaint, on their face, show that an affirmative\ndefense bars recovery on the claim. Marsh v. Butler County, 268 F.3d 1014, 1022 (11th Cir.2003) (en banc).\nA. Eleventh Amendment Immunity from Suit in Official Capacity\nWe first address whether Sheriff Freeman is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from Plaintiffs' strip search\nclaims for monetary damages against him in his official capacity. \"The Eleventh Amendment protects a State from\nbeing sued in federal court without the State's consent.\" Manders, 338 F.3d at 1308. The Eleventh Amendment\nalso bars suits brought in federal court against a defendant acting as an \"arm of the State.\" Id. To determine\n\nwhether a defendant is an \"arm of the State,\" this Court examines the four factors enumerated in Manders: \"(1)\nhow state law defines the entity; (2) what degree of control the State maintains over the entity; (3) where the\nentity derives its funds; and (4) who is responsible for judgments against the entity.\" Id. at 1309. The factors must\nbe considered \"in light of the particular function in which the defendant was engaged when taking the actions out\nof which liability is asserted to arise.\" Id. at 1308. Further, our determination is dependent on the law of the state\nin which the sheriff operates, since \"states have extremely wide latitude in determining their forms of government\nand how state functions are performed.\" Id. at 1309 n. 10. Accordingly, at issue in the instant case is whether,\nunder Georgia law, Sheriff Freeman acted as an arm of the State in promulgating policies and procedures to\nmaintain security at the Jail for the safety of detainees, visitors, and jail personnel, through the Jail's strip search\npolicy.\nIn Manders, this Court addressed whether the sheriff of Clinch County, Georgia, was an arm of the State with\nrespect to his \"force policy at the jail and the training and disciplining of his deputies in that regard.\" Id. at\n1308-09. Recognizing that resolution of the issue depended in part on state law, we discussed the relationship\namong the sheriff, the State, and Clinch County under Georgia law. Id. at 1309-18. Because the instant case also\ninvolves the relationship of a Georgia sheriff with the county in which he operates and the State, we rely on the\npertinent discussion of Georgia law in Manders.\nIn Manders, we noted:\nGeorgia's Constitution grants the State legislature the exclusive authority to establish and to\ncontrol a sheriff's powers and duties. Interpreting this constitutional provision, the Georgia\n1305 Supreme *1305 Court has explained that sheriffs are subject to the control of the Georgia\nlegislature and are not county employees. . . .\nIn contrast to the State's authority and control over sheriffs, Georgia's Constitution grants counties\nno legislative power or authority over sheriffs and expressly prevents counties from controlling or\naffecting the sheriff's office or the personnel thereof. In this regard, the Georgia Supreme Court\nhas concluded that this constitutional restriction on the legislative power granted to\ncounties00home rule00prevents counties from taking action affecting the sheriff's office. . . . Further,\n97 97\nin Georgia, counties also do not delegate any of their governmental or police powers to sheriffs.\nInstead, the sheriffs' authority and duties are derived directly from the State. . . .\nGeorgia law likewise makes the county entity itself, here Clinch County, a separate entity\nindependent of the sheriff's office. . . . As a separate entity, Clinch County is headed by its Board\nof Commissioners, which is given \"exclusive jurisdiction over and control of county affairs.\" In\ncontrast, under Georgia's Constitution, the State has exclusive authority and control over the\nduties and affairs of the sheriff's office. Although the State requires the county to fund the sheriff's\nbudget, Georgia's Constitution precludes the county from exercising any authority over the sheriff,\nincluding how the sheriff spends that budget.\nId. at 1310-11 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted); see also Bd. of Comm'rs of Dougherty County v. Saba,\n278 Ga. 176, 598 S.E.2d 437, 439 (2004) (\"The sheriff is an elected constitutional officer and not an employee of\nthe county commission.\"); Bd. Of Comm'rs of Randolph County v. Wilson, 260 Ga. 482, 396 S.E.2d 903, 903\n(1990) (same).\nWith this brief summary of the relationship between the State, the sheriff, and the County, we turn to the four\nfactors in Manders. Although Manders analyzed the four factors in light of a sheriff's use-of-force policy, see \nManders, 338 F.3d at 1305, we determine that the analysis in Manders is applicable to Sheriff Freeman's function\nof maintaining security at the Jail. And, guided by Manders, we conclude the factors weigh in favor of finding that\nSheriff Freeman is an arm of the State in performing this function. See Purcell, 400 F.3d at 1325 (11th Cir.2005)\n(finding, in a suit against the sheriff of Toombs County, Georgia for failure to prevent inmate-on-inmate violence,\nthe sheriff acts as an arm of the State \"when promulgating policies and procedures governing conditions of\n[22]\nconfinement at the Toombs County Jail\").  We briefly analyze the four factors below.\n\n1. Eleventh Amendment Factors\na. How state law defines the sheriff's office\nThe sheriff's office is a \"separate and independent office\" from the county and its governing body, notwithstanding\nthat the sheriff is elected by county voters. Manders, 338 F.3d at 1319; Brown v. Dorsey, 276 Ga.App. 851, 625\nS.E.2d 16, 21 (2005) (\"[T]he Constitution has made the sheriff independent from the County, notwithstanding the\n1306 designation of the sheriff *1306 as a `county officer.'\"). The essential governmental nature of the sheriff's office is\nto (1) enforce the law and preserve the peace on behalf of the State and (2) perform specific statutory duties, \ndirectly assigned by the State, in law enforcement, state courts, and corrections. Manders, 338 F.3d at 1319. With\nrespect to corrections, in particular, the State requires the sheriff to take custody of pre-trial detainees charged\n[23]\nwith state felony and misdemeanor offenses. Id. at 1315. The State also charges the sheriff with providing for\nthe protection and well-being of the detainees in his custodial care. Mayo v. Fulton County, 220 Ga.App. 825, 470\n[24]\nS.E.2d 258, 259 (1996).  Thus, in performing his State-assigned function of maintaining security at the Jail,\nSheriff Freeman acted for the State. Based on Manders, therefore, we conclude the first factor weighs in favor of\nimmunity.\nb. Where state law vests control\nThe State requires, and funds, annual specialized training of sheriffs in law enforcement, investigation, judicial\nprocess, and corrections practices. Manders, 338 F.3d at 1320. It is reasonable to assume that the State-\nmandated training in corrections includes instruction on maintaining security at the Jail and protecting the safety\nof detainees and others at the Jail. If a sheriff fails to comply with the annual training requirements, the\nGovernor00on behalf of the State00may sanction the sheriff for noncompliance. Id. at 1320. In fact, as we\n97 97\nrecognized in Manders, the Governor retains significant control over sheriffs:\n[T]he Governor has broad investigation and suspension powers regarding any misconduct by a\nsheriff in the performance of any of his duties. If a sheriff's policy permits excessive force in the\ncounty jail, plainly the Governor may discipline the sheriff. If a sheriff fails to take custody of state\noffenders in the county jail, plainly the Governor may discipline the sheriff.\nThe State legislature expressly has made [the Sheriffs] answerable to the Governor for [their]\nconduct. . . .\nSpecifically, the Governor may initiate an investigation of any suspected misconduct by any sheriff\nand may suspend the sheriff. . . . The State funds the investigation.\nId. at 1321 (citations omitted).\nIn contrast to the State's and Governor's authority over the sheriff's office, the counties have no authority or\ncontrol over the sheriff's corrections duties. See id. at 1322. While Georgia counties have obligations regarding\nthe jail structure and inmates' food, clothing, and medical necessities, those matters are \"wholly separate and\ndistinct\" from the sheriff's policies governing strip searches and release of detainees at the Jail. See id. Given\n\"the State's direct and substantial control over the sheriff's duties, training, and discipline and the county's total\nlack thereof,\" id., we determine that the second factor also weighs in favor of immunity in this case.\n1307  c. Where the entity derives its funds\n*1307\nState funds are involved, to some extent, in the functions at issue here, including the annual training of sheriffs in\ncorrections matters and in the Governor's disciplinary procedure over sheriffs for misconduct. See id. at 1323.\nWhile counties bear the major burden of funding the sheriff's office and county jail, they are required to do so by\nState law. Id. The State requires the County to pay for pre-trial state offenders, maintain the jail structure, provide\n\nnecessities to inmates, and pay the salaries of the Sheriffs and their deputies. Id. at 1323 & n. 42. Although the\nCounty sets and funds the sheriff's total budget, however, it cannot dictate how the sheriff spends that budget in\nthe exercise of the Sheriffs' duties, including their duties to maintain security at the Jail. See id. at 1323; see also \nMcMillian v. Monroe County, 520 U.S. 781, 791, 117 S.Ct. 1734, 1740, 138 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997) (\"The county's\npayment of the sheriff's salary does not translate into control over [the sheriff], since the county neither has the\nauthority to change [the sheriff's] salary nor the discretion to refuse payment completely.\"); Chaffin v. Calhoun,\n262 Ga. 202, 415 S.E.2d 906, 907-08 (1992). Because both state and county funds are involved in the function at\nissue here, and because county funds are involved only by virtue of state law, we conclude the third factor weighs\nin favor of immunity. See Manders, 338 F.3d at 1324.\nd. Liability for and payment of adverse judgments\nUnder Georgia law, \"counties are not liable for, and not required to give sheriffs money to pay, judgments against\nsheriffs in civil rights actions.\" Id. at 1326. We noted in Manders, however, that while the counties would not be\nliable for judgments against the sheriffs, the State might not be liable either. Id. at 1327. We could not find a\nGeorgia law that expressly required the State to pay an adverse judgment against the Sheriff in his official\ncapacity. Id. We suggested, therefore, that the sheriff may have to pay a judgment against him out of his own\nbudget. Id. This could, in turn, affect both state and county funds indirectly. Id. The situation in Manders with\nrespect to the county's or state's liability for adverse judgments is the same as that in the instant case. Thus, we\nconclude, as did the Manders court, that the fourth factor, \"at a minimum, . . . does not defeat Sheriff [Freeman's]\nimmunity claim.\" Id. at 1328.\n2. Local Constitutional Amendments\nPlaintiffs maintain on appeal that three local constitutional amendments applicable only to Fulton County alter the\n\"default\" allocation of authority between a Georgia sheriff and the county established in Manders. In particular,\n[25]\nPlaintiffs rely on the amendment they refer to as the \"Jail Local Constitutional Amendment\" (JLCA).  Plaintiffs\n1308 contend that because the JLCA authorizes the County to \"maintain and *1308 operate\" detention facilities and\ndesignate a person to \"control\" those facilities, the Sheriff acts for the County rather than as an arm of the State\nin operating the County's Jail.\nWe disagree. The three local amendments to which Plaintiffs draw our attention do not affect our reliance on \nManders. We recognize that, in Manders, we stated in a footnote that a local act of the State legislature could\ngive a Georgia county control over the county jail, such as a local act granting Chatham County control over its\n[26]\njail. Manders, 338 F.3d at 1318 n. 34. The Chatham County act explicitly gives the commissioners of Chatham\nCounty the power to make \"rules and regulations\" for the \"government and control\" of the Chatham County jail\nand inmates. Further, the Chatham County act affirmatively vests the commissioners with the \"management and\ncare\" of the jail. By contrast, the JLCA does not give the County power to make rules and regulations for the\nadministration of the Jail. Therefore, the JLCA does not alter the relationship among the State, the County, and\nthe Sheriff, as the County continues to have no say in how the Sheriff implements his policies at the Jail.\nHowever, even if the JLCA altered the analysis in Manders, the County has not exercised any potential authority\ngranted to it under the JLCA because the Sheriff, an office established by the State legislature, continues to\ncontrol the Jail.\nUnder Georgia law, the office of sheriff carries with it all of its common-law duties and powers, except as modified\nby statute. Elder v. Camp, 193 Ga. 320, 18 S.E.2d 622, 625 (1942). Where a statute limits the common-law\nduties and powers of a sheriff, it must be strictly construed, particularly where the limitation or restriction applies\nto only one sheriff in the State. Warren v. Walton, 231 Ga. 495, 202 S.E.2d 405, 409 (1973). We cannot conclude\nthe JLCA definitely and positively grants to the County the traditional powers allocated to the sheriff of a Georgia\ncounty, thereby altering the established allocation of power between the State, the County, and Sheriff Freeman.\nWe therefore affirm the district court's determination that Sheriff Freeman is entitled to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity, and we dismiss Plaintiffs' claims against Sheriff Freeman in his official capacity to the extent Plaintiffs\n[27]\nseek monetary damages.\n1309\n\n*1309 B. Qualified Immunity from Suit in Individual Capacity\nWe turn next to whether Sheriff Barrett is entitled to qualified immunity from Plaintiffs' strip search claims for\nmonetary damages against her in her individual capacity. \"Qualified immunity offers complete protection for\ngovernment officials sued in their individual capacities if their conduct `does not violate clearly established\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\" Vinyard v. Wilson, 311 F.3d\n1340, 1346 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d\n396 (1982)). To receive qualified immunity, the government official first must prove he was acting within his\ndiscretionary authority when the alleged wrongful acts occurred. Id. Once the government official establishes he\nwas acting within his discretionary authority, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the defendant is not entitled\nto qualified immunity. Id. The Supreme Court has established a two-part test to determine whether a defendant is\nentitled to qualified immunity. \"The threshold inquiry a court must undertake . . . is whether [the] plaintiff's\nallegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation.\" Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 736, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2513,\n153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (citing Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)\n). If, under the plaintiff's version of the facts, the defendant violated a constitutional right, \"the next, sequential\nstep is to ask whether the right was clearly established.\" Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. at 2156.\nSheriff Barrett is undisputedly a government official. Further, Plaintiffs do not dispute that Sheriff Barrett was\nacting within the scope of her discretionary authority in having Plaintiffs strip searched to maintain security at the\nJail. Therefore, we consider only whether, with respect to the AR, AL, and CR Group Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs\nsufficiently alleged violations of constitutional rights and, if so, whether such rights were clearly established at the\ntime of the alleged violations.\n1310 *1310 1. Constitutional Violation\na. Strip searches of AR Group Plaintiffs\nWe first address the constitutionality of the blanket strip searches conducted on the AR Group Plaintiffs as part of\n[28]\ntheir point-of-entry booking into the Jail.  Plaintiffs allege each arrestee booked into the Jail's general\npopulation, regardless of the crime for which the person is arrested, is subjected to a blanket strip search without\nan individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that the person is concealing drugs, weapons, or other\ncontraband. Under the law of this Circuit, an arrestee to be detained in the general jail population has a\nconstitutional right under the Fourth Amendment to be free from strip searches conducted without reasonable\nsuspicion that the detainee is concealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband. Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1341, 1343\n(plaintiff arrested for driving under the influence); Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678, 680, 682 (11th Cir. 2000)\n(plaintiff arrested for driving under the influence). Thus, under our binding precedent, the Jail's alleged policy of\nconducting blanket strip searches on all arrestees at booking, on the single ground they are to be placed in the\nJail's general population, must be deemed unconstitutional. See Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1343; Skurstenis, 236 F.3d\nat 682.\nOur holding with respect to the Jail's policy does not mean, however, that the particular strip search conducted on\neach AR Group Plaintiff actually violated that Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights. Hicks v. Moore, 422 F.3d 1246,\n1251 (11th Cir.2005); Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 682\n. Reasonable suspicion may have existed to justify the searches of some Plaintiffs. Id. \"`Whether an officer has\nreasonable suspicion is an objective question viewed from the standpoint of a reasonable [ ] officer at the scene.\nIt is based on the totality of the circumstances, and is a question of law to be reviewed de novo.'\" Id. at 1252\n(quoting Evans II, 407 F.3d at 1280). In determining whether reasonable suspicion existed for the strip search, it\nis immaterial whether the specific arresting officer or jailer actually and subjectively had reasonable suspicion, or\nwhether anyone at the time actually conducted a reasonable suspicion analysis. Hicks, 422 F.3d at 1252.\nInstead, our inquiry is whether, given the circumstances, reasonable suspicion objectively existed to justify the\nsearch. Id.\nOur precedent demonstrates that reasonable suspicion to justify the strip search of an arrestee may be based on,\namong other things, the circumstances of the person's arrest and/or the nature of the offense for which the\n\nperson was arrested. First, we have recognized that the circumstances surrounding a person's arrest may\nsupport reasonable suspicion to justify a strip search upon booking into the jail. 236 F.3d at 682. For example, in \nSkurstenis, we held that \"possession of a weapon by a detainee [at the time of arrest] provides the `reasonable\nsuspicion' necessary to authorize a strip search.\" Id. Although we noted the jail's policy of conducting blanket strip\nsearches on arrestees before being placed in a cell or detention room was unconstitutional, we upheld the\nparticular strip search conducted on the plaintiff because, at time of her arrest for driving under the influence, she\n[29]\nhad a handgun in her possession. Id.\n1311 *1311 Second, we have recognized that \"a person's being charged with a crime of violence is sufficient to evoke\nreasonable suspicion that the person may be concealing weapons or contraband.\" Hicks, 422 F.3d at 1252; see\nalso Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989). Similarly, where a person is arrested for an offense\ninvolving weapons or drugs00such as possession or use of a firearm and possession, use, or distribution of an\n97\nillegal substance00it is objectively reasonable to conduct a strip search of that person before he comes into\n97\ncontact with other detainees. In such cases, the nature of the arrest charge itself, independent of the facts\nsurrounding the arrest, gives rise to reasonable suspicion. On the other hand, where a person is arrested for an\noffense not generally associated with violence and not involving weapons or drugs, the single fact the arrestee\nwill be placed in the general jail population is not sufficient justification for the search under our binding\nprecedent. See Hicks, 422 F.3d at 1251-52. In such a case, there must be additional facts giving rise to\nreasonable suspicion that the person is concealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband, such as the\ncircumstances surrounding the person's arrest, as in Skurstenis.\nWe have declined to draw a distinction between felonies and misdemeanors, recognizing there exist both felonies\nand misdemeanors that are crimes of violence or that involve weapons or drugs and whose nature, therefore,\ngive rise to reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband. In Hicks,\nfor example, a panel of this Court found that the misdemeanor offense of \"family violence battery,\" for which the\ndetainee was arrested and charged, justified the strip search conducted on the plaintiff. 422 F.3d at 1252.\nBecause it was the first time the plaintiff had been arrested for and charged with family violence battery, he was\ncharged with a misdemeanor. See id. at 1249 n. 2. Finding the offense was \"obviously one of violence,\" the panel\nexplained that Georgia law defined family violence battery as \"`intentionally caus[ing] substantial physical harm or\nvisible bodily harm' to a `past or present spouse.'\" Id. at 1252 (quoting O.C.G.A. § 16-5-23.1(a)). The panel\nreached its conclusion not by considering whether the arrest charge was a felony or misdemeanor, but by looking\nto the elements of the offense. See id. The panel determined that, although the arresting officers and jailers did\nnot subjectively suspect the detainee of concealing weapons or drugs, the nature of the arrest charge (of which\nthe jailers were notified) was sufficient to justify the strip search. Id. at 1249, 1252.\nWe stress that under Hicks, the question of whether an offense is a crime of violence depends not on the\noffense's classification as a felony or misdemeanor, but instead on the elements of the offense for which the\narrestee was arrested and charged. Where the elements of the offense demonstrate that it is a crime of violence\nor a crime that involves weapons or drugs, the offense itself gives rise to reasonable suspicion to justify a strip\nsearch. Of course, even where the offense is not a crime of violence and does not involve weapons or drugs, the\ncircumstances surrounding the arrest may nonetheless support reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is\nconcealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband. See Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 682.\nIn the instant case, there are no allegations about the circumstances surrounding the arrest of each AR Group\nPlaintiff. Accordingly, we can look only to the nature of the particular offenses for which the AR Group Plaintiffs\nwere arrested to determine if their strip searches were supported by reasonable suspicion.\n1312 *1312 Based on the allegations in the Complaint, we conclude the following AR Group Plaintiffs were arrested for\ncrimes of violence or crimes involving weapons or drugs: David Evans, arrested on a charge of disorderly\nconduct but transferred to the Jail on a warrant for possession of a weapon; Anthony Westbrook, arrested on a\n[30] [31]\ncharge of simple battery;  and Benjamin Blake, arrested for battery.  Because the strip searches of these\nAR Group Plaintiffs were supported by reasonable suspicion based on the nature of the arrest offenses, the\nallegations do not establish a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. We therefore affirm the dismissal of the\nstrip search claims asserted by Plaintiffs Evans, Westbrook, and Blake.\n\nWe also conclude the following AR Group Plaintiffs were arrested for offenses that are not crimes of violence and\ndo not involve weapons or drugs: C. Alan Powell, arrested after revocation of bond for \"disorderly conduct\" and\n[32]\nfailure to pay a \"bar tab\"; Stanley Clemons, arrested on a charge of burglary;  Allen Middleton, arrested on a\nwarrant for an \"unpaid $27 traffic ticket\"; Harry Witherspoon, arrested for \"driving under the influence\"; and\nAntionne Wolf, arrested for \"contempt/nonpayment of child support.\" The strip searches of this latter group of AR\nGroup Plaintiffs, as alleged in the Complaint, were not supported by reasonable suspicion based on the nature of\nthe arrest offenses alone. Therefore, the allegations in the Complaint, at least at this Rule 12(b)(6) stage,\nestablish a violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs Powell, Clemons, Middleton, Witherspoon, and\n[33]\nWolf.  We must proceed to consider whether the rights of these AR Group Plaintiffs were clearly established.\nBefore doing so, however, we point out that a majority of our Court has expressed uncertainty about our\nprecedent holding that strip searches of arrestees to be placed in the jail's general population, absent reasonable\nsuspicion, violate the Fourth Amendment. See Evans II, 407 F.3d at 1278. In imposing a requirement of\nreasonable suspicion, our prior decisions relied on, but misconstrued, the Supreme Court's decision in Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). See Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1342-43; Skurstenis, 236\nF.3d at 681-82; Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th Cir.1992). We have since recognized\nour misinterpretation of Bell, stating: \"Most of us are uncertain that jailers are required to have a reasonable\nsuspicion of weapons or contraband before strip searching00for security and safety purposes00arrestees bound for\n97 97\nthe general jail population. Never has the Supreme Court imposed such a requirement.\" Evans II, 407 F.3d at\n1279 (citations omitted). Nonetheless, we recognize we are bound by our Circuit's prior panel decisions that a\njail's general practice of conducting blanket strip searches on arrestees on the single ground that they will be\n1313 placed in the *1313 jail's general population is unconstitutional under Wilson and Skurstenis.\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the strip search claims asserted by\nPlaintiffs Evans, Westbrook, and Blake, concluding the allegations do not establish a violation of their Fourth\nAmendment rights. With respect to Plaintiffs Powell, Clemons, Middleton, Witherspoon, and Wolf, we conclude\nthe allegations in the Complaint do establish a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights, and we consider in\nsection II.B.2.a. whether the rights of these AR Group Plaintiffs were clearly established.\nb. Strip searches of AL and CR Group Plaintiffs\nWe turn next to the constitutionality of blanket strip searches conducted on the AL and CR Group Plaintiffs after\nbecoming entitled to release. Plaintiffs allege, with respect to the AL Group, the Jail has a practice of conducting\nblanket strip searches on detainees who have posted bond or who have been ordered released at a First\nAppearance hearing at the Jail. The AL Group Plaintiffs were subjected to the booking process, including the\nbooking strip searches, after becoming entitled to release because their point-of-entry booking into the Jail was\nnot started or completed upon their arrival at the Jail. We assume the AL Group Plaintiffs were subjected to strip\nsearches as part of this late booking process because they were placed in the general jail population while the\nstaff in the Records Room, as part of the release process, searched for other detention orders, warrants, and\n[34]\nholds.\nPlaintiffs also allege, with respect to the CR Group, the Jail has a policy of conducting blanket strip searches on\npersons who are returned to Jail following a court appearance at which they were ordered released, despite the\nfact that these \"in-custody defendants\" were under the constant supervision of the Sheriff's deputies, were not\npermitted to have contact with anyone while in transit or at the courthouse, and were already strip searched upon\nentering the Jail. The CR Group Plaintiffs were strip searched upon their return from the courthouse before being\nbooked back into the general jail population, where they were held while the Records Room searched for\noutstanding detention orders, warrants, and other holds before releasing them. The CR Group Plaintiffs had\nalready been strip searched once as part of their point-of-entry booking into the Jail and thus were subjected to\nblanket strip searches twice.\nAs with arrestee strip searches, the Supreme Court's reasonableness test articulated in Bell is the applicable\nstandard to evaluate the strip searches of the AL and CR Group Plaintiffs. In each case, the test requires \"a\n\nbalancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\nCourts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for\n[35]\ninitiating it, and the place in which it was conducted.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.  This Court\n1314 conducted such a balancing in Wilson and Skurstenis, explaining the \"justification\" prong of the *1314Bell test\nand finding that strip searches of arrestees as they enter the Jail cannot be justified on the single ground that the\narrestees will be placed in the Jail's general population. Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1342-43; Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 682.\nRather, under the law of this Circuit, an arrestee to be detained in the general jail population has a constitutional\nright under the Fourth Amendment to be free from strip searches conducted without reasonable suspicion that the\ndetainee is concealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband. Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1341-43; Skurstenis, 236 F.3d\nat 678, 680, 682. Here, the justification is the same as in Wilson and Skurstenis, that is, continued detention in\nthe general jail population. Additionally, the privacy interests of the AL and CR Group Plaintiffs are the same, or\narguably greater than, those of arrestees because they are entitled to release and the basis for their detention at\n[36]\nthe Jail no longer exists.  Accordingly, if our precedent requires reasonable suspicion to justify point-of-entry\nstrip searches of arrestees bound for the general jail population, then at a minimum, reasonable suspicion must\nexist to justify strip searches of persons entitled to release from the Jail who are to be placed in the general jail\npopulation while their records are checked for other detention orders, warrants, or holds. Therefore, we must\ndeem unconstitutional the Jail's policies of conducting blanket strip searches on detainees who are entitled to\nrelease from the Jail under the factual circumstances presented here.\nAlthough we conclude the Jail's policy is unconstitutional, we must determine whether reasonable suspicion\nexisted to justify the particular strip searches of the AL and CR Group Plaintiffs. We first discuss the two Plaintiffs\nin the AL Group, Powell and Matkin. Because Powell posted bond, rather than having been ordered released, his\narrest charge remained pending against him at the time he was strip searched. Therefore, the nature of the\noffense for which he was arrested may give rise to reasonable suspicion to justify his strip search. Powell was\narrested on charges of \"disorderly conduct\" and failure to pay a \"bar tab,\" neither of which are crimes of violence\nor involve weapons or drugs. Thus, we conclude that Powell's strip search after having posted bond was not\nsupported by reasonable suspicion based on the nature of the arrest charge alone. Matkin, however, was ordered\nreleased by a judicial officer at the Jail. According to the Complaint, Matkin was arrested on March 18, 2004 on a\ncharge of \"aggravated assault\"; on March 19, 2004, a judicial officer at the Jail dismissed the aggravated assault\ncharge and ordered Matkin released; instead of being released, Matkin was booked into the Jail, strip searched,\nand held for four days; Matkin was permitted to leave the Jail only on March 23, 2004. Based on the allegations,\n[37]\nwe cannot say at this 12(b)(6) stage that Matkin's strip search was supported by reasonable suspicion.\nThe two Plaintiffs in the CR Group, Evans and Wolf, had already been strip searched upon entering the Jail and\nwere ordered released in state court. Thus, there were no pending charges against them at the time they were\nstrip searched again, and we cannot look to the nature of their arrest charges to find reasonable suspicion.\nFurther, according to the Complaint, the CR Group Plaintiffs were under constant supervision while in transit to\n1315 and from the Jail and while at *1315 the courthouse, and they were not permitted to have contact with anyone\nother than the Sheriff's deputies and their attorneys. Plaintiffs make no allegations indicating they had an\n[38]\nopportunity to acquire contraband during their transfers within the Jail or between the Jail and the courthouse.\n[39]\nWe therefore conclude that all Plaintiffs of the AL Group00Powell  and Matkin00and all Plaintiffs of the CR\n97 97\n[40]\nGroup00Evans  and Wolf00have sufficiently alleged violations of their Fourth Amendment rights. We proceed to\n97 97\ndetermine whether their rights were clearly established in section II.B.2.b. below.\n2. Clearly Established Law\nIn determining whether a constitutional right is clearly established, \"[t]he relevant, dispositive inquiry . . . is\nwhether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\" \nSaucier, 533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. at 2156. This inquiry \"must be undertaken in light of the specific context of\nthe case, not as a broad general proposition.\" Id. at 201, 121 S.Ct. at 2156. The contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear such that a reasonable official would understand that his conduct violates that right. Hope, 536\nU.S. at 739, 122 S.Ct. at 2515. \"This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless\nthe very action in question has previously been held unlawful; but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law\n\nthe unlawfulness must be apparent.\" Id. (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034,\n3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (citation omitted)). The salient question, therefore, is whether the state of the law\ngave the government official \"fair warning\" that his treatment of the plaintiff was unconstitutional. Id. at 741, 122\nS.Ct. at 2516; see also Marsh v. Butler County, 268 F.3d 1014, 1031 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc) (stating \"fair and\nclear notice to government officials is the cornerstone of qualified immunity\").\nIn most instances, \"fair warning\" will be given by case law existing at the time of the alleged violation. See \nVinyard, 311 F.3d at 1351. In finding applicable case law, we look to decisions of the United States Supreme\nCourt, decisions of this Court, and decisions of the highest court of the pertinent state. Marsh, 268 F.3d at\n1032-33 n. 10; Hamilton v. Cannon, 80 F.3d 1525, 1532 n. 7 (11th Cir. 1996). In many instances, case law will\nannounce a holding that is tied to a particular set of facts. Vinyard, 311 F.3d at 1351-52. When such fact-specific\nprecedents are said to clearly establish the law, the circumstances in the instant case facing the government\n1316 official must be \"materially similar\" to those in the preexisting case law for us to conclude the government *1316\nofficial had fair warning of the unconstitutionality of his conduct. See id. at 1352. However, although cases with\nmaterially similar facts can provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established,\nthey are not always necessary. Hope, 536 U.S. at 741, 122 S.Ct. at 2516. A governmental official can be on\nnotice that his conduct violates the law even in novel factual circumstances. Id.; see Vinyard, 311 F.3d at 1351-52\n. Where case law announces broad principles of law that are not tied to particularized facts, such case law can\nclearly establish the law applicable in a variety of different factual circumstances. Vinyard, 311 F.3d at 1351. We\nhave cautioned, however, that if a broad principle is to clearly establish the law applicable to a specific set of\nfacts, \"it must do so `with obvious clarity' to the point that every objectively reasonable government official facing\nthe circumstances would know that the official's conduct did violate federal law when the official acted.\" Id.\n(emphasis added).\na. Strip Searches of AR Group Plaintiffs\nWe first consider whether the Fourth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs Powell, Clemons, Middleton, Witherspoon,\nand Wolf of the AR Group were clearly established. This Court's panel decisions in both Skurstenis and Wilson,\nissued before the strip searches in the instant case occurred, make clear that jailers are required to have\nreasonable suspicion of weapons, drugs, or other contraband before strip-searching arrestees bound for the\ngeneral jail population. Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1343 (holding the strip search of the plaintiff absent reasonable\nsuspicion, as well as Shelby County Jail's policy authorizing the strip search, were unconstitutional); Skurstenis,\n236 F.3d at 682 (holding Shelby County Jail's policy of strip-searching inmates without reasonable suspicion was\nunconstitutional); see also Cuesta v. School Bd. of Miami-Dade County, 285 F.3d 962, 969 (11th Cir.2002) (\"This\nCourt has explained the `justification' prong of the Bell decision in two recent cases: Skurstenis v. Jones and \nWilson v. Jones. Both cases make clear that the Fourth Amendment requires jail officials to have `reasonable\nsuspicion' that an arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband before they can perform a strip search.\"\n(citations omitted)).\nFurther, on at least two occasions, this Court has emphasized the holding of Wilson. In Hicks, for example, a\npanel of this Court addressed the constitutionality of a county jail's practice of strip searching every arrestee to be\nplaced in the general jail population. Citing Wilson, we stated: \"[G]iven the Circuit's precedent, we must conclude\nthe search of Plaintiff cannot be justified under the Constitution on the single ground that Plaintiff was about to be\nplaced in the Jail's general population,\" and \"we accept that reasonable suspicion is required by the law of this\nCircuit.\" Hicks, 422 F.3d at 1251. In Evans I, we again recited the holding of Wilson: \"Arrestees who are to be\ndetained in the general jail population can constitutionally be subjected to a strip search only if the search is\nsupported by reasonable suspicion that such a search will reveal weapons or contraband.\" Evans I, 351 F.3d at\n490. Accordingly, we conclude Sheriff Barrett had fair warning that the blanket strip searches conducted on the\nAR Group Plaintiffs were unconstitutional.\nIt is true, as the district court pointed out, that we have questioned our requirement of reasonable suspicion. See \nEvans II, 407 F.3d at 1278 (\"Most of us are uncertain that jailers are required to have a reasonable suspicion of\n1317 weapons or contraband before strip searching00for security and safety purposes00arrestees *1317 bound for the\n97 97\ngeneral jail population\"); Hicks, 422 F.3d at 1251 n. 5 (\"We personally question that such a practice violates the\n\nFourth Amendment.\"). However, our questioning has been merely dicta, and we have previously recognized that\ndicta plays no role in the clearly established analysis: \"The law cannot be established by dicta. Dicta is\nparticularly unhelpful in qualified immunity cases where we seek to identify clearly established law.\" Hamilton, 80\nF.3d at 1530. However, even if our dicta in Evans II and Hicks could be said to \"muddle\" the law of this Circuit,\nthe opinions in both cases were issued after the alleged strip searches in the instant case occurred and thus\ncould not have affected Sheriff Barrett.\nWe also disagree with the district court's conclusion that there is a \"pronounced dissimilarity\" between the strip\nsearches in Wilson and those in the instant case such thatWilson could not have given Sheriff Barrett fair warning\nof our requirement of reasonable suspicion. Specifically, the district court found the strip searches alleged in the\ninstant case were \"markedly less invasive\" than those in Wilson. This ignores the allegations in the instant case\nthat Plaintiffs were required not only to remove their clothing but also to shower together with a group of thirty or\nforty other persons. Each arrestee then either singly or standing in line with others was visually inspected front\nand back. In Wilson, the plaintiff was required to remove her clothing, \"squat, spread her buttocks, and cough\nthree times.\" Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1341. The female officer in Wilson checked the plaintiff's ears, mouth, nose, and\nbreasts during the search. Id. at 1341-42. While the strip search in Wilson and those in the instant case were\nconducted in different manners, each was invasive and we cannot conclude that any difference in the degree of\ninvasiveness is material. Like the instant case, Wilson addressed strip searches of arrestees to be placed in the\ngeneral jail population without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion. See id. at 1341. Thus, while \nWilson's holding is to a certain extent tied to the particular facts at issue, the pertinent facts of both cases are\n[41]\nmaterially similar.  Accordingly, we conclude Sheriff Barrett had fair warning that strip-searching the AR Group\nPlaintiffs absent reasonable suspicion violated their Fourth Amendment rights.\nBecause Plaintiffs Powell, Clemons, Middleton, Witherspoon, and Wolf sufficiently alleged violations of their\nFourth Amendment rights, and because such rights were clearly established, we reverse the district court's\ndismissal of the strip search claims for monetary damages against Sheriff Barrett in her individual capacity.\nb. Strip Searches of AL and CR Group Plaintiffs\nWe next consider whether the Fourth Amendment rights of Plaintiffs Powell and Matkin, of the AL Group, and\nPlaintiffs Evans and Wolf, of the CR Group, were clearly established. The conduct challenged in the instant case-\nroutine, indiscriminate strip searches-is the same as the conduct we addressed in Wilson. Further, in both Wilson\n1318 and the instant case, the purported justification for the routine, indiscriminate strip searches was that the *1318\narrestees would be placed in the general jail population. Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1341; see also Hicks, 422 F.3d at\n1251. We concluded in Wilson that such a justification, alone, was not sufficient to justify the challenged conduct. \nSee Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1341, 1343. To the extent the rule announced in Wilson was tied to particularized facts,\nwe determine the facts of the instant case with respect to the AL and CR Groups are materially similar to the\npertinent facts in Wilson.\nThe fact that the AL and CR Group Plaintiffs were not newly-admitted arrestees makes it even more obvious\nunder Wilson that their strip searches were unconstitutional. They, unlike newly-admitted arrestees, were entitled\nto release from the Jail and, in case of those Plaintiffs ordered released either at the Jail or in state court, no\nlonger had pending charges against them. Accordingly, we conclude Sheriff Barrett had fair warning, under this\nCircuit's precedent, that strip-searching the AL and CR Group Plaintiffs absent reasonable suspicion violated their\nFourth Amendment rights.\nBecause the AL and CR Group Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged violations of their Fourth Amendment rights, and\nbecause such rights were clearly established, we reverse the district court's dismissal of their strip search claims\nagainst Sheriff Barrett in her individual capacity.\nC. Municipal Liability of the County and the City under § 1983\nThe question of municipal liability under § 1983 is relevant only when a constitutional violation has occurred. \nRooney v. Watson, 101 F.3d 1378, 1381 (11th Cir. 1996). Thus, we address the County's and City's liability under\n\n§ 1983 only with respect to those Plaintiffs who have sufficiently alleged violations of their Fourth Amendment\nrights, namely Plaintiffs Powell, Middleton, Witherspoon, Matkin, Wolf, and Evans.\n\"The Supreme Court has placed strict limitations on municipal liability under § 1983.\" Grech, 335 F.3d at 1329. A\nmunicipality can be found liable under § 1983 only where the municipality itself causes the constitutional violation\nat issue. City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 385, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1203, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). Thus, a\nplaintiff seeking to impose liability on a municipality under § 1983 must identify a municipal policy or custom that\ncaused the plaintiff's injury. Grech, 335 F.3d at 1329. Because a municipality will rarely have an officially-adopted\npolicy of permitting a particular constitutional violation, most plaintiffs must show the local government has a\ncustom or practice that evidences a \"deliberate indifference\" to the plaintiff's right. See id.; McDowell v. Brown,\n392 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir.2004). Only where the municipality's custom or practice reflects a \"deliberate\" or\n\"conscious\" choice from among various alternatives can the municipality be liable for its conduct. Harris, 489 U.S.\nat 388, 109 S.Ct. at 1205. However, it is not enough to identify conduct properly attributable to the municipality. \nId. A plaintiff must also demonstrate that the municipality's custom is the \"direct causal link\" between the\nmunicipality and the constitutional injury such that the municipality's action was the \"moving force\" behind the\nviolation. Id. at 385, 389, 109 S.Ct. 1197.\nOur decision today that Sheriff Freeman acts as an arm of the State forecloses Plaintiffs' argument that the\nCounty can be held liable under § 1983 based on its control of the strip search policies at the Jail. As we\npreviously explained, the Sheriffs do not act as policymakers for the County when performing their function of\n1319 maintaining security at the Jail. See Manders,*1319 338 F.3d at 1328; Grech, 335 F.3d at 1332.\nHowever, plaintiffs identify another set of \"policies\" which they claim the City and County do control, namely the\nCounty's and the City's policies of committing arrestees to the Jail through their respective police departments.\nWe agree with the district court that, when read in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Complaint can be read\nto allege these other \"policies.\" Nonetheless, as we explain below, we conclude that Plaintiffs' claims of municipal\nliability against the County and City for the violation of Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights, even when based on\nthese other \"policies,\" fail.\n1. Liability of the City\nWith respect to the City, not one of the Plaintiffs who sufficiently alleged a violation of their Fourth Amendment\nrights was arrested by the City of Atlanta Police Department. There are no constitutional injuries attributable the\nCity, therefore, because the City did not place at the Jail any of the Plaintiffs who sufficiently alleged constitutional\ninjuries. Because the City did not violate the constitutional rights of these Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' strip search claims\nagainst the City under § 1983 must be dismissed. See Rooney, 101 F.3d at 1381 (explaining that inquiry into a\ngovernmental entity's custom or policy is relevant only when a constitutional deprivation has occurred).\n2. Liability of the County\nWith respect to the County, Plaintiffs claim the County \"knew or should have known\" of the unconstitutional strip\nsearches and were \"deliberately indifferent\" to Plaintiffs' rights \"to be free from illegal strip searches.\" Plaintiffs\nallege the County's deliberate indifference was the \"moving force\" or \"motivating factor\" behind Plaintiffs'\nconstitutional injuries. Although Plaintiffs allege that the County was \"deliberately indifferent,\" we question\nwhether the County's commitment of arrestees at the Jail was in fact a \"deliberate choice from among various\nalternatives.\" In fact, unlike their allegations about the City, Plaintiffs do not specifically allege that the County has\na choice over where to commit its arrestees.\nEven assuming, however, the County's placement of arrestees at the Jail constitutes a policy that reflects a\ndeliberate indifference to Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights, this case presents additional problems of\ncausation. The link between the County's policy of placing arrestees at the Jail and the strip searches conducted\nat the Jail by the Sheriff and his deputies-over which the County has no control-is too attenuated to impose\nliability on the County. See Turquitt v. Jefferson County, 137 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.1998) (\"[L]ocal\ngovernments can never be liable under § 1983 for the acts of those whom the local government has no authority\nto control.\"). We recognize that had the County not placed its arrestees at the Jail, those persons would not be\nsubjected to the strip searches at the Jail; but we cannot say, based on Plaintiffs' allegations, that the County's\n\nplacement of arrestees at the Jail was the direct causal link or the moving force that animated the behavior of the\nSheriffs and their deputies that resulted in the constitutional violations alleged. \"Obviously if one retreats far\nenough from a constitutional violation some municipal `policy' can be identified behind almost any . . . harm\ninflicted by a municipal official.\" Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 823, 105 S.Ct. 2427, 2436, 85 L.Ed.2d\n791 (1985) (plurality opinion). For example, Plaintiffs would never have been committed to the Jail if the County\ndid not have a \"policy\" of arresting state offenders, and Plaintiffs would never have been arrested, if the County\n1320 did not have \"policy\" of establishing a police force. See id. But the Supreme Court's rigorous standards of *1320\nculpability and causation that apply where a municipality's actions are facially valid require more, which Plaintiffs\nhave failed to show. See Harris, 489 U.S. at 388, 109 S.Ct. at 1205. Plaintiffs' conclusory statement that the\nCounty was the \"moving force\" behind Plaintiffs' injuries does not cure this defect. See Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at\n1964-65 (requiring more than a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action to survive a motion to\n[42]\ndismiss). We therefore reverse the district court's denial of the County's and City's motions to dismiss.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the strip search claims for monetary damages\nagainst Sheriff Freeman in his official capacity; we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court's dismissal of\nthe strip search claims for monetary damages against Sheriff Barrett in her individual capacity; we reverse the\ndistrict court's denial of the County's and the City's motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' strip search claims; and we\nremand for the district court to dismiss Plaintiffs' strip search claims for monetary damages against Sheriff\nFreeman in his individual capacity and Plaintiffs' strip search claims for injunctive relief against Sheriff Freeman in\nhis official capacity.\nAfter remand consistent with our instructions, only the strip search claims for monetary damages asserted by\nPlaintiffs Powell (both his AR and AL Group claims), Clemons, Middleton, Witherspoon, Wolf, Matkin, and Evans\n(only his CR Group claim) against Sheriff Barrett in her individual capacity will remain.\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED IN PART.\nAppendix:\nAR GROUP\nBlanket strip searches as part of point-of entry booking into the Jail\nName                         Charge\nC.

Ryskamp, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] Plaintiffs also brought state law negligence claims against the Sheriffs. Those claims are not before us on\nappeal.\n[2] The district court's July 5, 2005 order relies, in part, on a previous order dated January 13, 2005, in which the\ndistrict court addressed the County's and City's motions to dismiss the First Amended Complaint. We include in\nthis opinion the pertinent analysis from the January 13, 2005 order.\n[3] In their Complaint, Plaintiffs also claim their constitutional rights were violated when they were detained past\nmidnight on their scheduled release dates, or \"overdetained.\" The district court granted in part and denied in part\nDefendants' motions to dismiss the overdetention claims. We address the district court's orders on the\noverdetention claims in a separate, unpublished opinion.\n[4] Plaintiffs name the members of the Board as defendants in their Complaint. Although Plaintiffs have\nexpressed their intent to dismiss their suit against the Board, it appears Plaintiffs have not yet done so.\nNonetheless, because the parties do not treat the County and the Board separately in their briefs, we, like the\ndistrict court, treat the County and the Board as one in our discussion of municipal liability.\n[5] Although the Complaint is not entirely clear, it appears Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief specifically against the\nCounty, the City, and Sheriff Freeman in his official capacity.\n\n[6] Because these classes have not yet been certified by the district court, we refer to them as \"groups\"\nthroughout the opinion, and we use the names assigned to each putative class in the Complaint.\n[7] C. Alan Powell is a Plaintiff for both the AR Group and AL Group. According to the Complaint, Powell was\narrested on March 20, 2004 on charges of \"disorderly conduct\" and \"not paying a bar tab.\" On March 21, 2004,\nsomeone posted bond for Powell. Before being released, Powell was strip searched. This strip search is the\nbasis of Powell's involvement in the AL Group. At some point after Powell was released, his bond was revoked.\nOn May 20, 2004, he was re-arrested and booked back into the Jail on the same charges following revocation of\nhis bond. Upon booking, he was strip searched. This second strip search is the basis of Powell's involvement in\nthe AR Group.\n[8] Two of the eleven plaintiffs in this case, Tory Dunlap and Lee Antonio Smith, are not included in any of the\nstrip search groups. Plaintiffs Dunlap and Smith only assert overdetention claims against Defendants.\n[9] The Complaint states that \"[b]lanket strip search means a strip search conducted without any determination of\nwhether a basis to conduct the search exists.\" Thus, as used in this opinion, \"blanket strip search\" is a strip\nsearch without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that each Plaintiff was concealing weapons,\ndrugs, or other contraband.\n[10] Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the strip searches only under the Fourth Amendment, as made\napplicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. See United States v. Davis, 313 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th\nCir.2002). Plaintiffs do not contend in their briefs that the strip searches violated rights arising independently\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Further, under the law of this Circuit, we analyze\nthe constitutionality of a strip search conducted without reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment. See \nCuesta v. School Bd. of Miami-Dade County, 285 F.3d 962, 969 n. 6 (11th Cir.2002). We therefore apply Fourth\nAmendment standards in addressing the constitutionality of the strip searches at issue here.\n[11] Plaintiffs use the term \"booked\" to refer to the process during which a person committed to the Jail is\nfingerprinted, identified, and entered into the Jail's computerized inmate management system. Plaintiffs explain\nthat blanket strip searches are also a part of the booking process.\n[12] Because there are no factual allegations in the Complaint regarding female arrestees, we refer to Plaintiffs\nhereinafter as \"arrestees\" without reference to gender.\n[13] Although Plaintiffs' allegations state that the AL Group Plaintiffs are released either at the Jail or at one of the\ncourthouses, the two AL Group Plaintiffs never left the Jail. C. Alan Powell was released after his family posted\nbond for him, and Kristopher Alan Matkin was ordered released by a judicial officer at the Jail.\n[14] While Plaintiffs allege that \"many\" 00 as opposed to \"all\" 00 detainees who have posted bond or have been\n97 97\nordered released by a judicial officer at the Jail are subjected to booking strip searches, we nonetheless construe\nthe Complaint as alleging a policy or practice with respect to the AL Group strip searches. Plaintiffs refer to it as a\n\"practice\" in other parts of the Complaint.\n[15] Again, while Plaintiffs allege that \"many\" 00 as opposed to \"all\" 00 detainees who are returned to the Jail\n97 97\nfollowing a court appearance are subjected to strip searches, we nonetheless construe the Complaint as alleging\na policy or practice with respect to the CR Group strip searches. Plaintiffs refer to it as a \"policy\" in other parts of\nthe Complaint.\n[16] Based on Plaintiffs' allegations that every person booked into the Jail is strip searched, we must assume that\nbecause the CR Group Plaintiffs have been \"booked\" into the Jail, they have already been strip searched once.\n[17] Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of the strip searches only under the Fourth Amendment, as made\napplicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment. See United States v. Davis, 313 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th\nCir.2002). Plaintiffs do not contend in their briefs that the strip searches violated rights arising independently\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Further, under the law of this Circuit, we analyze\nthe constitutionality of a strip search conducted without reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment. See \n\nCuesta v. School Bd. of Miami-Dade County, 285 F.3d 962, 969 n. 6 (11th Cir.2002). We therefore apply Fourth\nAmendment standards in addressing the constitutionality of the strip searches at issue here.\n[18] The district court first addressed the County's and City's liability in its January 13, 2005 order. In their\nmotions to dismiss the Complaint, the County and City requested the district court reconsider, or, alternatively,\nclarify its January 13, 2005 holding regarding their potential liability under § 1983. The district court denied the\nrequest for reconsideration, but granted the request for clarification.\n[19] Alternatively, Plaintiffs contend that Sheriff Freeman is not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity\nbecause suing him in his official capacity amounts to suing the Sheriff's office, which is neither an arm of the\nCounty nor an arm of the State but is instead an independent entity. Plaintiffs did not raise this argument before\nthe district court, however, arguing only that Sheriff Freeman acts for Fulton County and not as an arm of the\nState. We therefore decline to consider whether the sheriff's office is independent from both the County and the\nState. Madu v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 470 F.3d 1362, 1366 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006) (\"[A]n argument made for the first time in\nthe court of appeals is generally waived.\"); see also Manders, 338 F.3d at 1328 n. 54.\n[20] Defendants claim Plaintiffs lack standing to sue Sheriff Freeman in his individual capacity because the\nallegations in the Complaint show that all Plaintiffs were released from the Jail before Sheriff Freeman took office.\nWe agree and remand to the district court to dismiss Plaintiffs' strip search claims for monetary damages against\nSheriff Freeman in his individual capacity. Thus, we address qualified immunity only with respect to the strip\nsearch claims for monetary damages against Sheriff Barrett in her individual capacity.\n[21] The district court's certification and this Court's grant of permission to appeal also included the issues\naddressed in the district court's January 13, 2005 order.\n[22]Compare Brown v. Dorsey, 276 Ga.App. 851, 625 S.E.2d 16, 21 (2005) (finding that, for purposes of\nmunicipal liability under § 1983, the sheriff of Dekalb County, Georgia, did not act as final policymaker for the\ncounty when using departmental personnel and resources to commit a murder and thus the county could not be\nliable for the sheriff's actions under § 1983), with Freeman v. Barnes, 282 Ga.App. 895, 640 S.E.2d 611, 615-16\n(2006) (finding that the sheriff is a county official for workers' compensation purposes).\n[23] Under O.C.G.A. 42-4-12, the sheriff has a duty to accept persons charged with an indictable offense, and by\nimplication, a right to refuse to receive any municipal prisoner who is not charged with an offense against the\nState. Tate v. Nat'l Sur. Corp., 58 Ga.App. 874, 200 S.E. 314, 315 (1938). In the instant case, although some of\nthe Plaintiffs were arrested by the Atlanta Police Department, we assume based on Plaintiffs' allegations that they\nwere all charged with state offenses.\n[24] We note, as we did in Manders, that this is not a case of feeding, clothing, or providing medical care to\ninmates, which are matters over which Fulton County does have obligations and which are therefore county\nfunctions. Manders, 338 F.3d at 1319, 1322.\n[25] The full text of the JLCA is as follows: \nThe governing authority of Fulton County is hereby authorized to maintain and operate facilities within or without\nthe boundaries of said County for the detention, incarceration or confinement of all persons (including juveniles)\nsubject to detention, incarceration or confinement under the laws of this State, under any County resolution or\nunder any City ordinance. Such facilities, whether designated as a jail, public works camp or detention center,\nshall be under the control of such person or official as may be designated by the governing authority of Fulton\nCounty, and need not be used exclusively for any one class of prisoner or person.\nH.R. 687-1585, 1972 Sess., at 1439 § 1 (Ga. 1972), continued in effect in S. 503, 1986 Sess., at 4428 (Ga.1986);\nsee also Fulton County, Ga., Code § 1-122.\nPlaintiffs also rely on two other constitutional amendments, which they refer to as the \"Civil Service Local\nConstitutional Amendment\" and the \"Pension Local Constitutional Amendment.\" We agree with the district court\nthat these amendments do not establish the requisite control on the part of the County to render the Sheriff a\ncounty actor.\n\n[26] The text of the local act giving Chatham County control over its jail is as follows: \n\"Said Commissioners (of Chatham County) shall have power to make proper rules and regulations for the\ngovernment and control of said jail of Chatham County, and the prisoners and inmates therein, and, except as\nhereinbefore provided, are hereby invested with the management and care of said jail.\" Griffin v. Chatham\nCounty, 244 Ga. 628, 261 S.E.2d 570, 572 (1979) (emphasis added).\n[27] The Eleventh Amendment does not prevent Plaintiffs from seeking prospective, injunctive relief against\nSheriff Freeman in his official capacity. See Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U.S. 431, 437, 124 S.Ct. 899, 903,\n157 L.Ed.2d 855 (2004). Defendants maintain, however, that Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue prospective\ninjunctive relief on their strip search claims against both Sheriff Freeman in his official capacity and against the\nCity. We need only address Plaintiffs' standing to seek injunctive relief against Sheriff Freeman in his official\ncapacity because we dismiss the strip search claims against the County and the City in section II.C. below. In\norder to meet the constitutional minimum for standing to seek injunctive relief, Plaintiffs must show they \"[have]\nsustained or [are] immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of the challenged official\nconduct and the injury or threat of injury must be both real and immediate, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" City of\nLos Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1665, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (internal quotations\nomitted). \"[P]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding\ninjunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.\" Id. (internal quotations\nomitted). All Plaintiffs (other than Stanley Clemons) had been released from the Jail before they were added as\nparties to this suit. We agree with the district court that the threat they face of future unconstitutional strip\nsearches is too speculative or conjectural and not real and immediate. See, e.g., Shain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211,\n216 (2d Cir.2004) (finding the likelihood of plaintiff being subjected to unconstitutional strip search policy at\ncorrectional center after release is \"too speculative and conjectural\"). Further, although Clemons was still at the\nJail at the time he was added as a plaintiff to this suit, he has since been released from the Jail, which moots his\nclaim for relief. See Spears v. Thigpen, 846 F.2d 1327, 1328 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that claims regarding\ntreatment at a facility at which prisoner was no longer incarcerated were moot); see also Wahl v. McIver, 773 F.2d\n1169, 1173 (11th Cir.1985) (explaining that absent class certification, an inmate's claim for injunctive relief under\n§ 1983 action is moot once the inmate has been transferred). Clemons does not meet the two conditions for the\n\"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" exception to apply: (1) the challenged action must be of too short a\nduration to be fully litigated prior to its cessation, and (2) a reasonable expectation must exist that the same\ncomplaining party will be subject to the same action again. Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149, 96 S.Ct.\n347, 348, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975). While the first condition may be satisfied, the second is not because Clemons\nhas not demonstrated a reasonable expectation that he will again be arrested, committed to the Jail, and\nunconstitutionally strip searched. Thus, we conclude Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief against Sheriff Freeman\nin his official capacity should be dismissed.\n[28] We note that, in the instant case, Plaintiffs do not challenge the manner of the strip searches.\n[29] At the time of her arrest for driving under the influence, \"Skurstenis had a .38 special handgun, for which she\nhad an expired permit, in the floorboard of her car.\" Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 680. Skurstenis was arrested only for\ndriving under the influence, however, and was not charged with any weapons offense. See id.\n[30] According to the Complaint, Anthony Westbrook also was arrested for \"child abandonment (non-support)\"\nand on a probation warrant for \"forgery.\"\n[31] According to the Complaint, Benjamin Blake also was arrested for \"trespass\" and \"obstruction.\"\n[32] We note that, in some circumstances, burglary may be a crime of violence. However, the allegations in the\ninstant case are insufficient for us to make that determination.\n[33] At the summary judgment stage, Defendants may show facts regarding the circumstances of each Plaintiff's\narrest, the nature of the arrest offenses, or some other conduct that support reasonable suspicion. At this 12(b)(6)\nstage, however, we look only to the allegations in the Complaint.\n\n[34] Plaintiffs do not challenge the late booking process as a whole. For example, Plaintiffs do not challenge the\nprocess during which a person committed to the Jail is fingerprinted, identified, and entered into the Jail's\ncomputerized inmate management system. Rather, Plaintiffs challenge the policy of conducting booking strip\nsearches, as part of the late booking process, after they have posted bond or have been ordered released by a\njudicial officer at the Jail.\n[35] Because the AL and CR Group Plaintiffs do not challenge the scope, place, or manner of their strip searches,\nwe address only the \"justification\" prong.\n[36] We recognize that the AL Group Plaintiffs who posted bond still have charges pending against them.\n[37]See supra note 33.\n[38] Because the allegations do not give rise to reasonable suspicion as required under our precedent, we need\nnot determine what particular level of cause is necessary to justify the strip searches of the AL and CR Group\nPlaintiffs. Further, at this 12(b)(6) stage, Defendants have had no opportunity to present evidence on, or respond\nabout, whether there was constant supervision and no contact or, even so, whether there were opportunities to\nobtain weapons, other contraband, or items from which weapons could be made.\n[39] As we concluded above, Powell's strip search upon being booked into the Jail, which was based on his\nsecond commitment to the Jail after his bond was revoked, also violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n[40] Although the strip search conducted on Evans upon being booked into the Jail did not violate his Fourth\nAmendment rights, see supra, his strip search after returning from a court appearance at which he was ordered\nreleased lacked reasonable suspicion and, under our precedent, violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\n[41] We note that Wilson's holding imposing a requirement of reasonable suspicion was in no way qualified by the\nmanner in which the strip search was conducted. However, because judicial opinions \"cannot make law beyond\nthe facts of the cases in which those decision are announced,\" we recognize that the holding is limited to a\ncertain extent by the material facts presented to the Court. Watts v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 316 F.3d 1203,\n1207 (11th Cir.2003).\n[42] We note that Plaintiffs do not argue on appeal the County was deliberately indifferent based on its failure to\ntrain the Sheriffs and their staff.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The Court addresses the remaining motions\nbefore it following its review of the record and the parties’ briefs.\nBackground\nPlaintiffs, certain former detainees at the Fulton County Jail (the “Jail”),\ninitiated this putative class action on April 21, 2004.  In their Complaint, as\npresently amended, Plaintiffs assert claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Georgia\n1Plaintiffs  are  cautioned  to  fully  respond  to  Defendants’  arguments  in  all  future\nfilings  with  the  Court.    Although  the  Court  in  this  instance  will  consider  the  arguments\nasserted in the submitted surreply, it is not required to do so.  See L.R. N.D. Ga. 7.1\n(providing for filing a motion and brief, response brief, and reply brief);  Garrison\nv. Northeast Ga. Med. Ctr., Inc., 66 F. Supp. 2d 1336, 1340 (N.D. Ga. 1999) (it\nis not the function or obligation of the district court to engage in “refereeing an\nendless volley of briefs”).  \n3\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\ncommon law respecting the conditions of their confinement at the Jail.  They\ncomplain about being subject to “blanket strip searches” upon entering and/or\nreturning to the Jail, as well as their continued detention past scheduled or\nnecessary release dates (a condition they refer to as “over-detention”).  \nIn particular, Plaintiffs allege that they and others similarly situated were\nheld at the Fulton County Jail for periods of time, in some instances, almost two\nweeks, after they had served misdemeanor sentences, posted bond or had been\nordered released by a Fulton County Court.  Moreover, they assert that the Jail\nmaintained a policy of strip searching inmates without any individualized\ndetermination that such searches would reveal weapons, drugs or other\ncontraband, and that they and others were subjected to these invasive searches\nat the hands of Jail staff.  Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that at least some of these\nsearches were conducted with respect to persons who were returning from\ncourt hearings pursuant to which they were entitled to be released from the\nfacility.  \nPlaintiffs allege that these conditions at the Fulton County Jail were\nubiquitous and had persisted for many years.  Moreover, they assert that\nthrough media coverage and several published judicial decisions relating such\n4\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nconditions to the public, the unconstitutional treatment of inmates at the Jail had\ngrown notorious, such that the government actors who placed arrestees into the\nJail’s custody were aware of these alleged practices.\nPlaintiffs assert that the foregoing treatment violates rights guaranteed\nthem under the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution, and predict that the persons falling within the proposed classes\ndenominated in their pleadings will number 10,000 or more.  As a result of\nexposure to such conditions, Plaintiffs seek monetary and injunctive relief\nagainst Fulton County Sheriff Jacqueline Barrett, Fulton County, the members\nof the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, and the City of Atlanta.\nDiscussion\nThe motions before the Court fall into four distinct categories–motions to\namend, motion to certify class, motions to dismiss, and several filings\nconcerning discovery.  The Court addresses these submissions in that order. \nI. Motions to Amend\nThe Court first considers Plaintiffs’ Rule 15 motions to amend.  Pursuant\nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), after a responsive pleading has been\nfiled, a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or written consent\n5\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nof the adverse party.  The rule goes on to provide, “leave shall be freely given\nwhen justice so requires.”  Even so, granting leave to amend is not automatic. \nFaser v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 674 F.2d 856, 860 (11th Cir. 1982); see also\nUnderwriters at Interest on Cover Note JHB92M10582079 v. Nautronix, Ltd.,\n79 F. 3d 480, 484 (5th Cir. 1996) (“approval of motion to amend is not\nautomatic”); Ashe v. Corley, 992 F. 2d 540, 542 (5th Cir. 1993) (same).  Rather,\ndistrict courts have “extensive discretion” in deciding whether to grant leave to\namend and may choose not to allow a party to do so “when the amendment\nwould prejudice the defendant, follows undue delays or is futile.”  Campbell v.\nEmory Clinic, 166 F.3d 1157, 1162 (11th Cir. 1999).\nPlaintiffs submitted their first motion to amend in July 2004, requesting\nthe addition of one Stanley Clemens II as a named plaintiff in this action.2\nAccording to Plaintiffs, the amendment was sought because, at the time the\nmotion was filed, Mr. Clemens was still housed at the Jail (despite a decision\n2Although  the  second  motion  to  amend  (requesting  leave  to  file  a  pleading\ncaptioned,  “Third  Amendment  Complaint”)  likewise  identifies  Mr.  Clemens  as  a  named\nplaintiff,  Plaintiffs  elected  not  to  withdraw  their  earlier  motion  because  they  assert  the\nSecond  Amended  Complaint  “relates  back”  to  a  time  when  Mr.  Clemens  was  still  housed\nat the Jail.  (See Pls.’ Br. in Supp. of their Mot. for Leave to  Amend  their  Second  Am.\nCompl. at 2 n.1.)  \n6\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nfrom Judge Bedford of the Superior Court of Fulton County ordering his\nimmediate release).  Consequently, Plaintiffs submit, his standing to pursue\ninjunctive relief is free from doubt. \nThe Fulton County Defendants oppose this motion, contending that the\nrequested amendment would be futile for two reasons.  First, the Fulton County\nDefendants assert that the proposed amended pleading does not state claims for\nrelief against them for all the reasons set forth in their Motion to Dismiss. \nSecond, they urge that Mr. Clemens had failed to exhaust his administrative\nremedies before seeking leave to be joined in this action, thereby foreclosing the\nrelief sought under habeas corpus jurisprudence and the mandates of the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act of 1996, 42 U.S.C. § 1997(e) (hereinafter, “PLRA”).  \nAs it relates to the first ground for opposition, the Court declines to deny\nleave to amend based on a pleading’s alleged failure to assert meritorious claims\nagainst some named Defendants.3  The viability of claims against a subset of\nlitigants can be tested more effectively through a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to\ndismiss, and the Court will not exercise its discretion in favor of a wholesale\n3The  Court  addresses  the  merits  of  the  Fulton  County  Defendants’  Motion  to\nDismiss infra, Part III.\n7\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\ndenial of sought after amendments when the allegations against other parties\nappear to state cognizable claims for relief.\nLikewise, Defendants’ “failure to exhaust” futility argument fails to\npersuade the Court that Plaintiffs should be denied the right to file their Second\nAmended Complaint.  Pretermitting whether Plaintiffs’ request for an injunction\ncan appropriately be considered as a petition for habeas corpus relief,4 Plaintiffs\nhave come forward with evidence tending to show that Mr. Clemens had\nexhausted available remedies at the time he sought to become a named Plaintiff. \nThey have additionally included an allegation to that effect in their Third\nAmended Complaint.  While deficiencies in the allegations contained in a\nproposed amended pleading may permit a court to exercise its discretion in\nfavor of refusing the amendment on grounds of futility, see Bellanger v. Health\nPlan of Nevada, Inc., 814 F. Supp. 914, 916 (D. Nev. 1992), the Court is\nguided here by the principle that “[a] denial of leave to amend is justified ‘only if\n4Plaintiffs  contend  that  Mr.  Clemens  does  not  seek  release  from  his  individual\nconfinement,  but  rather,  joins  with  the  remaining  Plaintiffs  in  asking  for  an  injunction\nproscribing  the  continued  over-detention  of  inmates  at  the  Jail.    This,  Plaintiffs  argue,  takes\ntheir  request  for  relief  outside  the  umbrella  of  habeas  corpus  jurisprudence.    The  Court\nneed  not  address  the  merits  of  Plaintiffs’  contention  at  this  juncture,  however,  because\nirrespective  of  whether  the  exhaustion  requirement  applies  to  the  instant  controversy,\nDefendants have not persuaded the Court that Mr. Clemens’ claims are not viable. \n8\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nit appears to a certainty that plaintiff cannot state a claim.’”  Grupke v. Linda\nLori Sportswear, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 987, 993 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (quoting Square\nD Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bur., Inc., 760 F.2d 1347, 1366 (2d Cir.\n1985)).  Here, in light of the proffered evidence and Plaintiffs’ subsequent\nrepresentations, no such certainty exists.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion to\nAmend the First Amended Complaint [16-1] is GRANTED.\nThe Plaintiffs have also requested leave to file a Third Amended\nComplaint, in which they add additional parties, numerous allegations\nconcerning the facts underlying this dispute, as well as two new putative plaintiff\nclasses.5  Defendants have not opposed this requested amendment, and after a\nreview of the proposed pleading, and in light of the Rule 15(a) mandate that\nleave to amend should be freely given, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are\nentitled to the requested amendment.  Consequently, Plaintiffs’ Motion for \n5Plaintiffs’  Third  Amended  Complaint  introduces,  for  the  first  time,  a  class\ndenominated  as  the  “Alpha  Strip  Search  Class”–persons  who  are  subjected  to  the  Jail’s\npurported “blanket strip search” policy despite having had the cases against them dismissed,\nor  having  posted  bond.    In  addition,  the  Third  Amended  Complaint  restores  a  class  of\nPlaintiffs found in the original Complaint,  but  omitted  from  the  First  and  Second  Amended\nComplaints, designated as the “Court Return Strip Search Class.”\n9\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nLeave to Amend their Second Amended Complaint [42-1] is hereby\nGRANTED.\nII. Motion for Class Certification\nIn mid-August 2004, Plaintiffs submitted their Motion for Class\nCertification.  There is some question regarding whether this Motion was\nproperly served on Defendants, and no Defendant has yet filed a response.6 \nThe Fulton County Defendants, however, have requested that they be permitted\nan extension of time to submit a brief in opposition to the Motion, asking that\ntheir response deadline be set at sixty days following this Court’s resolution of\ntheir Motion to Dismiss.\nIn view of the fact that Plaintiffs submitted their Motion for Class\nCertification while their First Amended Complaint remained the operative\npleading in this case, and in light of Plaintiffs’ subsequent addition of new\nnamed plaintiffs and of two new proposed classes, the Court concludes that\nconsiderations of judicial efficiency militate against the development and\nconsideration of this important issue based on the incomplete arguments\n6The Fulton County Defendants state that they were  not  served  with  a  copy  of  this\nMotion.\n10\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\ncurrently before it.  Rather, the Court finds that its resources, and those of the\nparties, would be efficiently and best conserved if the Plaintiffs were to submit\nan amended, complete brief to the Court (addressing all classes and named\nplaintiffs) after the Defendants have tendered responsive pleadings to the Third\nAmended Complaint.  See LR 23.1B, NDGa (“[I]n any class action . . . in\nwhich one or more defendants have filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 12 in lieu of an answer to the complaint . . . the plaintiff shall move\nfor a determination under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1) within thirty (30) days after all\ndefendants have filed an answer to the complaint.  The court may extend the\ntime upon a showing of good cause”). \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification [15-1] is \nDENIED with the right to re-file.  The Fulton County Defendants’ Motion\nfor Extension of Time to File a Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Class\nCertification [22-1] is DENIED as moot.\nIII. Motions to Dismiss\nBoth the Fulton County Defendants and the City of Atlanta have moved\nto dismiss Plaintiffs’ causes of action against them.  Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(6) empowers the Court to grant a defendant’s motion to\n11\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\ndismiss when a complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted.7  In considering whether to grant or deny such a motion, the Court may\nlook only to the pleadings.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).  The pleadings are construed\nbroadly so that all facts pleaded therein are accepted as true, and all inferences\nare viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S.\n546, 546, 84 S. Ct. 1733, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1030 (1964); Conner v. Tate, 130 F.\nSupp. 2d 1370, 1373 (N.D. Ga. 2001).  Thus, a motion to dismiss should be\ngranted when “it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of\nfacts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.”  Conley v.\nGibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957); see Linder v.\nPortocarrero, 963 F.2d 332 (11th Cir. 1992). \nEven so, a court may not accept conclusory allegations or unwarranted\nfactual deductions as true.  Purvis v. City of Orlando, 273 F. Supp. 2d 1321,\n1324 (M.D. Fla. 2003).  Nor may a court presume that a plaintiff can prove facts\nit has not alleged or “accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual \n7Although  the  motions  are  directed  at  Plaintiffs’  First  Amended  Complaint,  the\nCourt  evaluates  the  parties’  arguments  with  reference  to  the  current,  operative  pleading,\ni.e., the Third Amended Complaint.  \n12\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nallegation.”  Papasan v.Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d\n209 (1983); see also Purvis, 273 F. Supp. 2d at 1324.\nHere, the Fulton County Defendants and the City of Atlanta contend that\nPlaintiffs have failed to state a claim against them.  In particular, pointing to the\nEleventh Circuit’s decisions in Grech v. Clayton County, 335 F.3d 1326 (11th\nCir. 2003), and Manders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir. 2003), these\nDefendants assert that they lacked control over the management of the Fulton\nCounty Jail and, specifically, the over-detention and strip search policies at issue\nin this litigation, and that this lack of control forecloses their liability under §\n1983.8  \nA. Requisites of Municipal Liability under § 1983\nSection 1983 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n8Defendants  also  argue  that  certain  Georgia  statutes  shield  them  from  liability  under\n§ 1983.  See O.C.G.A. §§ 36-1-4, 36-33-1.  The Court finds this argument to lack merit.\nSee Howlett v. Howlett, 496 U.S. 356, 376, 110 S. Ct. 2430, 110 L. Ed. 2d 332 (1990)\n(“Conduct by persons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983 . . . cannot be immunized by state law.  A construction of the federal  statute which\npermitted  a  state  immunity  defense  to  have  controlling  effect  would  transmute  a  basic\nguarantee  into  an  illusory  promise;  and  the  supremacy  clause  of  the  Constitution  insures\nthat  the  proper  construction  may  be  enforced.”)  (quoting  Martinez  v.  California,  444  U.S.\n277, 284, 100 S. Ct. 553, 62 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1980)).  \n13\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nEvery person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State\nor Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or\ncauses to be subjected, any citizen of the United\nStates or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to\nthe deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to\nthe party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or\nother proper proceeding for redress . . . .\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Although municipal bodies are undoubtedly “persons”\nsubject to liability under the statute, Monell v. Department of Social Services,\n436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978), the Supreme Court\nhas placed “strict limitations” on the circumstances in which § 1983 municipal\nliability may arise.  Grech, 335 F.3d at 1329 (11th Cir. 2003) (plurality opinion).9 \nSpecifically, municipalities can be found liable under § 1983 only when their “\n‘official policy’ causes a constitutional violation[,]” and only for acts or\nomissions for which they are “actually responsible[.]”  Id.  Liability may not be\n9Herein,  citations  to  Grech  direct  the  reader  to  the  plurality  opinion  authored  by\nJudge Hull in that case.  The Court observes that the concurring Judges in Grech appeared\nto  take  issue  only  with  those  parts  of  the  plurality’s  opinion  related  to  the  scope  of  the\nplurality’s  determination,  the  plurality’s  conception  of  sheriffs  as  subservient\nconstitutional  officers,  and  the  plurality’s  reading  of  Georgia  law.    For  the  most  part,  this\nCourt’s  reliance  on  Grech  is  for  propositions  dealing  more  generally  with  municipal\nliability  under  §  1983–an  issue  over  which  the  en  banc  panel  in  Grech  did  not  seem  to\nevince the same disagreement.\n14\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nbased on the acts of the municipality’s agents or employees under the theory of\nrespondeat superior.  Id.  \nIn order for a plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of a municipal\n“policy,” he must identify either (i) an officially promulgated municipal mandate,\nor (ii) an unofficial custom or practice of the municipality shown through the\nrepeated acts of one of its final policymakers, and that such custom or practice\nconstitutes “the moving force behind the constitutional violation.”  Id. at 1329-\n30.  In either case, to prevail on a § 1983 claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate\nthat the relevant local governmental entity has authority and control over the\ngovernmental function in question, and identify those officials who speak with\nfinal policymaking authority for that body concerning the act alleged to have\ncaused the particular constitutional injury.  Id. at 1330.  \nIn the instant litigation, the parties dispute whether Plaintiffs’ allegations\nsuffice to demonstrate that either the City of Atlanta or the Fulton County\nDefendants possess the requisite degree of control over the policies that\nallegedly gave rise to Plaintiffs’ constitutional injuries.  Plaintiffs respond to\nDefendants’ attacks on their pleading by arguing, in the first instance, that these\nDefendants did control the over-detention and strip search practices in place\n15\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nwithin the Jail.  Alternatively, Plaintiffs contend that regardless of whether the\nDefendants controlled the offensive Jail practices, their knowledge of the\n“notoriously” unconstitutional conditions at the Jail render them liable by virtue\nof their election to nevertheless subject arrestees to detainment there.10  \nFollowing its consideration of Plaintiffs’ allegations and the authorities\nraised in the parties’ papers, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ first argument to lack\nmerit.  Conversely, the Court concludes that if Plaintiffs prove the allegations\ncontained in their Complaint, including, critically, that the City and County\ncontrolled the placement of arrestees in the Fulton County Jail with knowledge\nof the pervasive constitutional violations alleged to exist at the facility, they may\nbe entitled to § 1983 relief.\n10In  their  Response  to  the  Fulton  County  Defendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss,  Plaintiffs\nalso  argue  that  the  Fulton  County  Defendants  are  in  violation  of  orders  entered  by  Judge\nShoob  in  Foster  v.  Fulton  County,  1:99-cv-900-MHS.    Defendants  contend  that  these\norders have been vacated or terminated.  Irrespective of whether Judge Schoob’s orders are\nstill  in  force,  Plaintiffs  have  not  filed  any  motion  for  contempt  with  this  Court,  and  have\nnot  explained  how  the  alleged  violation  of  Judge  Schoob’s  orders  is  germane  to  the\nquestion  of  whether  the  Fulton  County  Defendants  had  “control”  over  the  Jail  policies  at\nissue in this litigation.\n16\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nB. The County and City’s Lack of Requisite Control Over the\nOver-Detention and Strip Search Policies\nConfined to the most narrow perspective, the constitutional injuries\nasserted in this litigation can be seen as the direct product of two purported\npractices in the Fulton County Jail.  First, Plaintiffs allege that they and other\ninmates were subjected to blanket strip searches while detained at the Jail, and\nthat these searches were administered without an individual determination that\nthe search would reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband.  (Third Am.\nCompl. ¶¶ 404-506.)  According to Plaintiffs, exposure to such searches\nviolates rights afforded them under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment. \nSecond, Plaintiffs contend that they and others similarly situated were subject to\ndetention beyond their scheduled release dates, and that being so detained\nviolated their Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  (Id. ¶¶ 507-\n544.)  \nAs Plaintiffs concede, at all times relevant to this action, it was the duty of\nDefendant Jacqueline Barrett, Sheriff of Fulton County, to formulate, implement,\nand execute policies concerning the operation of the Fulton County Jail.  (See\nThird Am. Compl. ¶ 132 (acknowledging such duties on the part of Defendant\n17\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nBarrett “subject to the authority of the [Fulton County] Board”)).  Moreover,\nPlaintiffs acknowledge that the aforementioned duties “include promulgating\npolicies controlling the strip searches of inmates, and regulations ensuring the\nrelease of inmates on their Release Dates.”  (Id. ¶ 133.)  \nAs discussed supra, in order to prevail on a § 1983 claim against a\nmunicipal body, a plaintiff must prove that “the local government entity . . . has\nauthority and responsibility over the governmental function at issue.”  Grech,\n335 F.3d at 1330.  Stated differently, a plaintiff is required to show that the\nrelevant municipality had “control” over the governmental act or acts that are the\nsource of the alleged constitutional wrong.  Id. at 1330-31 (emphasizing\nimportance of municipal control in § 1983 analysis).  With respect to the\npolicies of alleged over-detention and blanket strip searches, therefore, Plaintiffs\nmust plead and prove that the City and County had authority over the such\npractices, rendering them “actually responsible” for the acts giving rise to the\nconstitutional violations.  Id. 1329-31.  As Defendants correctly observe in their\npapers, Plaintiffs have not alleged facts that would demonstrate the requisite\ndegree of control on the part of the County or the City over these functions, and\nunder binding precedent, cannot make the required showing.\n18\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nInitially, with respect to the City, Plaintiffs do not advance any allegation\nthat the City controlled or is “actually responsible” for the practices in place at\nthe Fulton County Jail.  (See generally Third Am. Compl. ¶¶ 427-437, 461-472,\n497-506, 532-542.)  Indeed, aside from their contention, discussed infra, that\nthe City placed its arrestees in the custody of a facility where it knew that\nunconstitutional treatment was likely to occur, Plaintiffs identify no germane\nnexus between the acts or omissions of the City and the cited violations of their\nconstitutional rights.  Consequently, the Court has little difficulty concluding that\nDefendant City of Atlanta did not exercise the requisite “control” over the over-\ndetention and strip search policies identified in Plaintiffs’ pleading to support its\nliability for that conduct under § 1983.  See Grech, 335 F.3d at 1330.  \nLikewise, clearly established law forecloses the liability of the Fulton\nCounty Defendants based upon any theory that they “controlled” the\nunconstitutional treatment of detainees within the Fulton County Jail.  In two\nrecent decisions, Grech v. Clayton County, 335 F.3d 1326 (11th Cir. 2003), and\nManders v. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir. 2003), the Eleventh Circuit thoroughly\nelucidated the relationship of Georgia county sheriffs vis-a-vis their respective\nmunicipalities and the State.  It is clear from those decisions, as well this\n19\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCourt’s own review of Georgia law, that the Sheriff in her corrections and\ndetainee oversight role is acting as an arm of the State, and that the County lacks\nany meaningful authority to direct the Sheriff’s actions in that regard.  See\nManders, 338 F.3d at 1312-1318 (recognizing “counties . . . do not assign or\ncontrol any of the sheriffs’ duties[,]” including duties related to corrections, and\nthat “counties have no authority over what corrections duties sheriffs perform,\nor which state offenders serve time in county jails, or who is in charge of the\ninmates in the county jails”); see also Grech, 335 F.3d at 1333-44 (refusing to\nfind county liable in § 1983 case relating to sheriff’s law enforcement functions,\nobserving, “In contrast to the control it gives the State, Georgia’s Constitution\ndoes not grant counties legislative power or authority over sheriffs and expressly\nprevents counties from controlling or affecting the sheriff’s elective county\noffice.”) (plurality opinion).  Without such control, the County similarly cannot\nbe held liable for the cited occurrences taking place within the Fulton County Jail\nin the event those occurrences were ultimately to prove unconstitutional.\nPlaintiffs cite three “local” constitutional amendments in an attempt to\nalter this result, at least with respect to the County.  Specifically, Plaintiffs argue\nthat what they denominate as the Jail Local Constitutional Amendment, the Civil\n20\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nService Local Constitutional Amendment and the Pension Local Constitutional\nAmendment, in conjunction with acts taken by Fulton County pursuant thereto,\nplace Fulton County on unique footing in the Georgia municipal landscape. \nAccording to Plaintiffs, by virtue of this unique position, the County does\nexercise the requisite degree of control over the Jail and its personnel to sustain\nmunicipal liability under § 1983.  Upon review of the cited constitutional\nprovisions, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ argument unavailing.\nThe “Jail Local Constitutional Amendment” cited by Plaintiffs provides as\nfollows:\nThe governing authority of Fulton County is hereby\nauthorized to maintain and operate facilities within or\nwithout the boundaries of said County for the\ndetention, incarceration or confinement of all persons\n(including juveniles) subject to detention, incarceration\nor confinement under the laws of this State, under any\nCounty resolution or under any City ordinance.  Such\nfacilities, whether designated as a jail, public works\ncamp, or detention center, shall be under the control\nof such persons or official as may be designated by\nthe governing authority of Fulton County, and need\nnot be used exclusively for any one class of prisoner\nor person.\nH.R. 687-1585, 1972 Sess., at 1439 § 1 (Ga. 1972), continued in effect in S.\n503, 1986 Sess., at 4428 (Ga. 1986); see also Fulton County, Ga., Code § 1-\n21\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\n122 (codifying same provision as part of Fulton County Code relating to\npowers of the Board of Commissioners).  According to Plaintiffs, this provision\nof the Georgia constitution and the Fulton County Code give the Fulton County\nBoard power over the operation of the County Jail, and thus, bring them within\nthe ambit of municipal liability under § 1983.  The Court rejects this reading of\nthe amendment.  \nInitially, the amendment, by its express terms, is simply an enabling\nmandate.  It merely authorizes the Fulton County Board to determine whether it\nwishes to operate an independent detention facility.  See H.R. 211, 1972 Sess.,\nat 1439 § 1 (Ga. 1972) (“The governing authority of Fulton County is hereby\nauthorized to maintain and operate facilities within or without the boundaries of\nsaid County for the detention, incarceration or confinement of all persons\n(including juveniles) subject to detention, incarceration or confinement under the\nlaws of this State . . . .”) (emphasis supplied).  Even as subsequently adopted in\nthe Fulton County Code, it does not reflect the election of the Fulton County\nBoard to pursue its power under the constitutional amendment, and Plaintiffs\nhave directed the Court to no authority that Fulton County has actually seized\nupon this power and decided to undertake the maintenance of an incarceration\n22\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\ncenter.  Thus, the cited amendment establishes only the Fulton County\nDefendants’ potential ability to exert some level of control over a county\ndetention facility, not the exercise of that power in such a way as to render them\n“actually responsible” for the policies of any facility bearing the Fulton County\nname. \nMoreover, while Plaintiffs characterize Fulton County as having\n“designated” Sheriff Barrett as the person in charge of the county’s detention\nfacility (presumably, by virtue of their failure to designate someone else under\nthe enabling amendment), that allegation does not cure the defect in their claims. \nEven if Plaintiffs’ contention was sustainable, the amendment does not give the\nCounty the ability to direct the policies of any designee, nor does it purport to\nalter (or even mention) the established allocation of power between the Sheriff\nand the County in the corrections arena.  Such amorphous, unexercised\n“control” conferred upon Fulton County by the Jail Local Constitutional\nAmendment is insufficient to sustain § 1983 municipal liability.\nSimilarly, the Civil Service Local Constitutional Amendment, H.R. 1501,\n1982 Sess., at 4896 (Ga. 1982), see also Fulton County, Ga., Code § 34-31 et\nseq., does not establish the requisite “control” on the part of the Fulton County\n23\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nDefendants over the Jail practices at issue to render them liable under § 1983. \nPlaintiffs’ argument as it relates to the amendment is that, by virtue of Fulton\nCounty’s election to participate in the Civil Service System, the Sheriff’s ability\nto hire, discipline and terminate Jail employees is constrained by the acts of the\nFulton County Personnel Board, a political subdivision subject to the authority\nof the Fulton County Board.  Such attenuated constraint over personnel matters,\nhowever, is far from the sort of “control” over offending policies that would be\nsufficient to sustain § 1983 municipal liability.  See Grech, 335 F.3d at 1330-32. \nIndeed, were the ability to exercise employer-like authority over staff deemed\nsufficient to render a municipality liable under § 1983, the proscription against\nimposition of municipal liability based on principles of respondeat superior\nwould cease to have any meaningful force.  See id. at 1329 (“A county’s liability\nunder § 1983 may not be based on the doctrine of respondeat superior.”).\nFinally, the Court is not persuaded that the so-called Pension Local\nConstitutional Amendment, No. 247, 1939 Sess., at 39 (Ga. 1939), provides a\nfoundation for the Fulton County Defendants’ liability under § 1983.  While\nPlaintiffs emphasize that this amendment places the Sheriff and her employees’\nwithin a “unified county pension system[,]” they have provided no argument or\n24\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nauthority suggesting that such placement in any way affects the § 1983 municipal\nliability inquiry.  Moreover, the Court observes that the Eleventh Circuit has\nalready rejected the argument that a county’s authority over a sheriff’s budget\n(including, by necessity, authority over salary and pensions) can impute liability\nto the county as a consequence of policies adopted by the sheriff.  See\nManders, 338 F.3d at 1323-24; see also Grech, 335 F.3d at 1339-40.\nIn sum, Plaintiffs have directed the Court to no allegation or authority that\nwould take this case outside of the Eleventh Circuit’s pronouncements in Grech\nand Manders.  Because the City of Atlanta and the Fulton County Defendants\nlack control over the offending Jail policies of over-detention and blanket strip\nsearches, these municipalities cannot be held liable for such practices under §\n1983. \nC. Entrustment-Based Liability\nPlaintiffs additionally contend that, regardless of whether the City or\nCounty could be said to control the over-detention and strip search policies in\nplace at the Fulton County Jail, these municipalities are subject to § 1983 liability\nbecause they entrusted their arrestees to the Jail with full knowledge of the\n“notoriously” unconstitutional conditions present at that facility.  The City and\n25\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCounty counter by arguing that there was nothing inherently unlawful in their\nplacement of arrestees in the Fulton County Jail, and that in any event, any\npurported knowledge on their part of the Jail’s unconstitutional policies is not\ntantamount to the control necessary to sustain § 1983 municipal liability.\nAfter careful consideration of the issue, the Court agrees with Defendants\nto the extent they insist that a municipality’s knowledge of unconstitutional\ntreatment by another government actor, without more, is insufficient to render\nsuch a municipality liable under § 1983.  Likewise, the Court agrees with\nDefendants that a municipality’s mere entrustment of arrestees to another\ngovernment actor, who in turn engages in unconstitutional conduct, cannot\nsupport such liability.  These two conclusions are compelled by the Eleventh\nCircuit’s mandate that “a local government . . . is liable under section 1983 only\nfor acts for which the local government is actually responsible.”  Marsh v. Butler\nCounty, 268 F.3d 1014, 1027 (11th Cir. 2001) (en banc); see Turquitt v.\nJefferson County, 137 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir. 1998) (“local governments\ncan never be liable under § 1983 for the acts of those whom the local\ngovernment has no authority to control”) (en banc); see also Grech, 335 F.3d at\n1331. \n26\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nNevertheless, those principles, in isolation, do not end the inquiry.  This is\nbecause the Complaint, read in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, does not\npredicate claims against the County and City on either bare knowledge of\nunconstitutional conditions at the Fulton County Jail, or the mere entrustment of\narrestees to a constitutional misfeasor.  Rather, Plaintiffs contend that these\nmunicipal bodies are liable under § 1983 for maintaining the policy and practice\nof actively entrusting their arrestees to the Jail with knowledge of the\nunconstitutional treatment such arrestees would face upon their confinement\nthere.  The Court finds that such an allegation, if substantiated, could lay the\nfoundation for § 1983 liability.\nPrecedent addressing this precise theory of § 1983 liability is not\nvoluminous.  Nonetheless, other federal courts to have considered the issue\nhave either held or implicitly recognized that a municipality that places its\narrestees in the detention facility of another government subdivision can be liable\nfor the latter’s unconstitutional conduct if it knew that such conduct was taking\nplace at the facility.  See Young v. City of Little Rock, 249 F.3d 730, 735 (8th\nCir. 2001) (holding that city that entrusted its arrestees to county with\nknowledge of unconstitutional practice at issue could be held liable under § 1983\n27\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nfor injury arising out of arrestee’s exposure to the practice); Deaton v.\nMontgomery County, 989 F.2d 885, 889-90 (6th Cir. 1993) (in declining to hold\ncounty liable under § 1983 for city’s unconstitutional practices in treatment of\narrestees, emphasized that “[t]here are no facts presented indicating that the\nsheriff knew or should have known that strip searches were conducted in\nviolation of state law”).11  The Court finds the reasoning expressed in such\nprecedent persuasive.\n11Plaintiffs additionally cite Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F. Supp. 2d 131 (D. Mass.\n2001), in support of their assertion that the City and County can be liable in this case as a\nconsequence  of  the  Fulton  County  Jail’s  allegedly  unconstitutional  policies.    While  the\nFord decision would lend additional support to the outcome reached above, the Court reads\nFord  as  extending  §  1983  liability  beyond  the  limited  basis  provided  for  in  its  holding\ntoday.  In particular, the Court observes that the  Ford court appeared to subject a city to\nliability  under  §  1983  based  solely  on  the  city’s  decision  to  entrust  arrestees  to  a  county\njail  where  unconstitutional  treatment  occurred.    There  was  no  requirement  articulated  in\nFord  that  the  city  knew  that  unconstitutional  treatment  was  taking  place;  rather,  the  court\nimposed  upon  the  city  an  affirmative  obligation  to  determine  whether  such  unconstitutional\nconditions were prevalent at the jail.  See 154 F. Supp. 2d at 148-49.  The Court’s decision\nin this case should not be read as imposing such an obligation.\nMoreover, the Court does not concur in the Ford court’s reading of  Ancata v. Prison\nHealth  Services,  Inc.,  769  F.2d  700  (11th  Cir.  1984),  to  impose  such  an  affirmative\ninvestigatory burden in cases where one municipality is sought to be held liable for the acts\nof  another  government  entity.    Ancata  involved  an  instance  in  which  a  defendant\nmunicipality farmed out a  non-delegable duty to a private actor.  The reasons underlying\nthe  imposition  of  an  affirmative  duty  to  investigate  in  that  circumstance,  if  Ancata  can  be\nread  as  imposing  such  a  burden,  simply  do  not  exist  where,  as  here,  the  misfeasor  is  a\npublic  body  with  its  own  independent  obligation  to  ensure  compliance  with  constitutional\nmandates.\n28\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nMoreover, the Court rejects the City and County’s assertion that these\nauthorities are in any way inconsistent with the Eleventh Circuit’s holding that a\nmunicipal body can only be liable under § 1983 for policies which it actually\ncontrols.  The flaw in such an argument is the unduly myopic scope with which\nDefendants’ attempt to define the “policies” at issue in this litigation.  \nPlainly, the most direct cause of the Plaintiffs’ asserted constitutional\ninjuries in this case was the Fulton County Jail’s alleged policies of over-\ndetention and blanket strip searches–policies which, as discussed supra, neither\nthe County nor the City can be said to control in the manner necessary to\nsustain § 1983 liability.  But those policies are not the only ones which Plaintiffs\ncontend were the proximate cause of the suffered constitutional wrongs.  \nInstead, Plaintiffs identify a third, proximate “moving force” behind their\nconstitutional injuries; namely, the City and County’s policy of placing arrestees\nin the custody of a facility in which they knew constitutional violations were\nrampant.  \nIn contrast with the over-detention and strip search policies discussed\nsupra, Georgia law suggests that these Defendants did possess control over\nwhere their police departments placed arrestees.  See Ga. Const. of 1983, art.\n29\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nIX, § 2, ¶ 3(a)(1) (“any county, municipality, or any combination thereof may\nexercise the following powers and provide the following services . . . [p]olice . .\n. protection”); O.C.G.A. § 36-8-5 (placing county police within the control of\nthe county governing authority); Fulton County, Ga., Code § 146-31 (creating\nFulton County Police Department, and providing Fulton County Board with\ncontrol over police rules and regulations); Atlanta, Ga., Code § 98-26 (creating\nAtlanta Police Department).12  In light of such control, the Court finds nothing in\nbinding precedent that would insulate these Defendants from liability in the event\nPlaintiffs prove that they exercised such control by electing to place their\narrestees in the custody of a facility which they knew engaged in the\nunconstitutional treatment of detainees.  To provide such insulation would be to\neffectively encourage a municipality, whether motivated by fiscal considerations\nor more sinister intentions, to “wash its hands,” so to speak, of unconstitutional \n12The City cites Manders, 338  F.3d  at  1315,  for  the  proposition  that  a  municipality\nlacks  control  over  where  its  arrestees  are  housed.    The  Court  finds  that  Defendants’\nreliance on Manders to support such a “rule” is misplaced.  Rather, the Court construes the\nlanguage  cited  by  the  City  as  simply  acknowledging  that  the  sheriff  lacks  the  authority  to\nrefuse to  take  custody  of  an  individual  arrested  by  the  police  for  a  state  offense.    It  does\nnot address the ability of a municipality to detain arrestees at a separate facility.\n30\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nevils by simply passing off its inmates to another government actor.  Cf. Young,\n249 F.3d at 735. \nThat being said, however, the liability of the City and County can extend\nno further than their control over the placement of arrestees in the Fulton County\nJail.  Marsh, 268 F.3d at 1027; Turquitt, 137 F.3d at 1292; see also Grech, 335\nF.3d at 1331. Stated differently, even assuming Plaintiffs can demonstrate that\nthese actors had the requisite knowledge regarding the prevalence of\nconstitutional infractions at the Jail, neither the City nor the County may be liable\nfor constitutional injuries suffered by a detainee unless it had the authority to\nchoose whether to entrust such a person to the facility.  Critically, therefore,\nwhile Fulton County may be liable for the arrestees placed in the Jail by its\npolice department (over which it exerted control), it may not be subject to §\n1983 liability for arrestees placed in the Jail by the Sheriff or her deputies.  See\nManders, 338 F.3d at 1312-1318 (county does not control sheriff’s correction\nfunctions); see also Grech, 335 F.3d at 1333-44 (county does not control\nsheriff’s law enforcement functions).\nAccordingly, the Fulton County Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss\nAmended Complaint [17-1], and Defendant City of Atlanta’s Motion to Dismiss\n31\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nAmended Complaint [21-1] are hereby DENIED.  The City and County may be\nliable under § 1983 in the event Plaintiffs prove their allegations that these\nmunicipal bodies, through their respective police departments, entrusted\narrestees to the Fulton County Jail with knowledge of the unconstitutional\nconditions cited in the Complaint.\nIV. Discovery Motions; Motions for Scheduling Order, Conference\nAlthough pending for less than one year, this case, due to a series of\nrecusals, has been before four different Judges in this District.  It was assigned\nto the undersigned on December 6, 2004.  As a consequence of its movement\nthrough the Court, and notwithstanding its procedural infancy, it has\naccumulated a substantial volume of outstanding motions relating to discovery. \nMany of these motions are now of questionable relevance given the passage of\ntime and the procedural posture of this case, and the Court concludes that the\nmost efficient and effective way to address the questions asserted therein would\nbe to meet and confer with counsel.  Consequently, the Court will take up these\nmatters at a status and scheduling conference to be held on   2nd   day of\nFebruary, 2005 at 10:30 a.m. at Courtroom 2105, Richard B. Russell Federal\nBuilding, 2121 United States Courthouse, 75 Spring Street, SW, Atlanta,\n32\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nGeorgia 30303.  In addition, given that many matters raised in the outstanding\nmotions are now moot, and that other scheduling issues may have since arisen,\nthe parties are permitted, and encouraged, to submit concise statements in\nadvance of the conference regarding matters they wish the Court to address\nduring the course of the scheduling conference.\nConclusion\nDefendant Jacqueline Barrett’s Motion for Leave to File Answer [12-1],\nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Supplement their Opposition to the Fulton County\nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss [32-1], and Plaintiffs’ Motion to Late File their\nReply to the Fulton County Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for\nLeave to Amend their First Amended Complaint [41-1] are GRANTED nunc\npro tunc. \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Amend the First Amended Complaint [16-1], and\nMotion for Leave to Amend their Second Amended Complaint [42-1] are\nhereby GRANTED.\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification [15-1] is  DENIED with the\nright to re-file.  The Fulton County Defendants’ Motion for Extension of Time\n33\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nto File a Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification [22-1] is\nDENIED as moot.\nThe Fulton County Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint\n[17-1], and Defendant City of Atlanta’s Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint\n[21-1] are hereby DENIED. \nAs it relates to the Fulton County Defendants’ Motion to Stay Discovery\n[27-1], Plaintiffs’ Motion for Entry of a Scheduling Order Including Setting\nDeadlines and Extending Certain Dates [34-1], the Fulton County Defendants’\nRequest for Scheduling Conference [44-1], the Fulton County Defendants’\nMotion for Protective Order [46-1], and the Fulton County Defendants’ Motion\nto Quash Subpoenas [61-1], the Court will take up these matters at a status and\nscheduling conference to be held on    2nd    day of  February, 2005 at 10:30\na.m. at Courtroom 2105, Richard B. Russell Federal Building, 2121 United\nStates Courthouse, 75 Spring Street, SW, Atlanta, Georgia 30303.  In addition,\ngiven that many matters raised in the outstanding motions are now moot, and\nother scheduling issues may have since arisen, the parties are permitted, and\nencouraged, to submit concise statements in advance of the conference \n34\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nregarding matters they wish the Court to address during the course of the\nscheduling conference.\nFinally, with respect to the stay entered by the Court in its December 7,\n2004 Order [66-1], that stay shall remain in effect pending the resolution of\ndiscovery issues at the status and scheduling conference.  \nSO ORDERED this   13th   day of January, 2005.\n/s/ Richard W.

We answer\nthat question in the affirmative, at least where the strip search is no more intrusive\nthan the one the Supreme Court upheld in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S. Ct.\n1861 (1979). \n2\n\nI.\nThe facts and procedural history of this entire case are set out in accurate\ndetail in the panel opinion.  Powell v. Barrett, 496 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir. 2007),\nvacated, No. 05-16734 (11th Cir. Feb. 1, 2008).  As it explains, the named\nplaintiffs in this class action lawsuit are eleven former detainees at the Fulton\nCounty Jail in Georgia, all of whom were strip searched upon entering or re-\nentering the general population at that detention facility.  Id. at 1296, 1298.  The\neleven named plaintiffs can be divided into three groups, which overlap to some\nextent.  Id. at 1297.  One of those three groups is “the Arrestee Strip Search Class\n(AR Group),” which consists of the eight plaintiffs who were strip searched as part\nof the point-of-entry booking process before they were placed into the general jail\npopulation for the first time.  Id. at 1297–98.  Three of the eight members of that\ngroup were arrested on charges that supplied reasonable suspicion to believe that\nthey might be concealing contraband at the time they were booked into the jail.  Id.\nat 1312. \nOur en banc interest, as reflected in our briefing instructions, is in the strip\nsearches conducted on the other five members of the arrestee group (plaintiffs\nPowell, Clemons, Middleton, Witherspoon and Wolf).  Id.  As to each of those\nfive, neither the charge itself nor any other circumstance supplied reasonable\n3\n\nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee might be concealing contraband.  See id. at\n1312–13.  The five were strip searched solely because they were entering the\ngeneral population of inmates at the detention facility. \nBecause this is an appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss, we take the\nfacts from the allegations of the complaint.  Pielage v. McConnell, 516 F.3d 1282,\n1284 (11th Cir. 2008); Locke v. SunTrust Bank, 484 F.3d 1343, 1345 n.1 (11th\nCir. 2007); Spain v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 363 F.3d 1183, 1186\n(11th Cir. 2004).  The allegations are that four of these five plaintiffs were taken to\nthe Fulton County Jail for detention after being arrested on relatively minor\ncharges:  a bail revocation on a disorderly conduct charge, a traffic ticket warrant, a\nDUI charge, and a contempt charge for failure to pay child support.  Powell, 496\nF.3d at 1312; (R6:78:¶89.)  The fifth plaintiff in this group was arrested on a\nburglary charge, which we (like the panel) assume did not involve an element of\nviolence.  Powell, 496 F.3d at 1312 & n.32.  \n“Every person booked into the Fulton County Jail general population is\nsubjected to a strip search conducted without an individual determination of\nreasonable suspicion to justify the search, and regardless of the crime with which\nthe person is charged.”  (R6:78:¶180.)  The booking process includes “having the\narrested person go into a large room with a group of up to thirty to forty other\n4\n\ninmates, remove all of his clothing, and place the clothing in boxes.”  (Id. ¶181.) \nThe entire group of arrestees then takes a shower in a single large room.  (Id.\n¶¶182, 238.)  After the group shower each arrestee “either singly, or standing in a\nline with others, is visually inspected front and back by deputies.”  (Id. ¶183.)\n“Then each man [takes] his clothes to a counter and exchange[s] his own clothes\nfor a jail jumpsuit.” (Id. ¶ 239.)  Identifying an illustrative case, the complaint\nalleges that one of these five plaintiffs “along with every other inmate in the\nprocess, had to stand before a guard front and center, and show his front and back\nsides while naked.”  (Id. ¶240.)  There is no allegation that any members of the\nopposite sex either conducted the visual searches or were present while they were\nbeing conducted.  Nor is there any allegation that the searches were conducted in\nan abusive manner.  See Powell, 496 F.3d at 1310 n.28 (“We note that, in the\ninstant case, Plaintiffs do not challenge the manner of the strip searches.”).\nThe five plaintiffs contend that the strip searches violated the Fourth\nAmendment because there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that any of them\nhad hidden contraband.  The panel felt forced to agree, citing our prior decision in\nWilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir. 2001), as well as an earlier opinion that\nhad reached the same conclusion, albeit in dicta, Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678,\n682 (11th Cir. 2000) (stating that a strip search without reasonable suspicion does\n5\n\nnot comport with the Fourth Amendment but that reasonable suspicion existed in\nthat case).  Powell, 496 F.3d at 1310, 1312; see also Cuesta v. Sch. Bd., 285 F.3d\n962, 969 (11th Cir. 2002) (noting that “[i]n Wilson, we made the dicta of\nSkurstenis binding law” but concluding that reasonable suspicion existed in that\ncase).  The panel did point out that our decisions imposing a reasonable suspicion\nrequirement for point-of-entry strip searches at detention facilities had “relied on,\nbut misconstrued, the Supreme Court’s decision in Bell,” and that “[w]e have since\nrecognized our misinterpretation” of that decision.  Powell, 496 F.3d at 1312\n(citing Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272, 1279 (11th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (dicta)).  \nDespite its misgivings, the panel acted properly in following Wilson because\nit was bound by the prior panel precedent rule to do so.  Smith v. GTE Corp., 236\nF.3d 1292, 1301–02 (11th Cir. 2001); Cohen v. Office Depot, Inc., 204 F.3d 1069,\n1076 (11th Cir. 2000); United States v. Steele, 147 F.3d 1316, 1317–18 (11th Cir.\n1998) (en banc); Cargill v. Turpin, 120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir. 1997); Gwin v.\nSnow, 870 F.2d 616, 623–24 (11th Cir. 1989).  We are not.  Sitting en banc, we are\nfree to revisit the Wilson decision and its interpretation of Bell and to decide for\nourselves what Bell means. \nII.\n           The reasoning that leads us to uphold the searches of these five plaintiffs is\n6\n\nsimple.  After balancing the privacy interests of detention facility inmates against\nthe important security interests involved, the Supreme Court upheld the visual\nbody cavity strip searches at issue in the Bell case against a Fourth Amendment\nattack.  The security needs that the Court in Bell found to justify strip searching an\ninmate re-entering the jail population after a contact visit are no greater than those\nthat justify searching an arrestee when he is being booked into the general\npopulation for the first time.  And the searches conducted in the Bell case were\nmore intrusive, and thereby impinged more on privacy interests, than those\nconducted in this case.  It follows from the Bell decision that the less intrusive \nsearches in this case do not violate the Fourth Amendment.  That is the gist of our\nreasoning, the details of which follow.\nA.\nBefore getting into those details, we pause briefly to address the defendants’\ncontention that the test we should apply is the one for prison regulations in general\nthat was announced in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S. Ct. 2254 (1987),\ninstead of the more strip search-specific Fourth Amendment analysis that the\nSupreme Court used in Bell.  In their brief, the plaintiffs oppose the defendants’\nposition, arguing instead that we should apply the specific Fourth Amendment\napproach.\n7\n\nThe plaintiffs’ position is consistent with the Supreme Court’s repeated\nadmonitions that we should not assume that it has, by implication, overruled a prior\ndecision specifically on point with later, more general language in a different\ndecision.  Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236, 252–53, 118 S. Ct. 1969, 1978\n(1998) (“Our decisions remain binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider\nthem, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their\ncontinuing vitality.”); Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S. Ct. 1997, 2017\n(1997) (“We do not acknowledge, and we do not hold, that other courts should\nconclude our more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an earlier\nprecedent.”); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477,\n484, 109 S. Ct. 1917, 1921–22 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court has direct\napplication in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of\ndecisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls,\nleaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.”).  We take\nthose admonitions seriously.  See United States v. Greer, 440 F.3d 1267, 1275–76\n(11th Cir. 2006); Eng’g Contractors Ass’n of S. Fla. Inc. v. Metro. Dade County,\n122 F.3d 895, 908 (11th Cir. 1997); Brisentine v. Stone & Webster Eng’g Corp.,\n117 F.3d 519, 525–26 (11th Cir. 1997); Scala v. City of Winter Park, 116 F.3d\n1396, 1399 n.2 (11th Cir. 1997).  Until the Supreme Court tells us that the Bell\n8\n\napproach no longer applies where that Court applied it, we are inclined to continue\nusing it. \nWe also concur in the agreement that is implicit in the parties’ opposing\npositions—that to the extent of any difference, the Bell Fourth Amendment test is\nmore detainee friendly in this context than the test in Turner.  Because we conclude\nthat the plaintiffs lose even under the straight Fourth Amendment approach of Bell,\nwe need not decide if that approach has been superseded by the more deferential\nTurner one.\nB. \nThe Bell case involved a class action lawsuit brought by pretrial detainees\nbeing held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City.  Bell,\n441 U.S. at 523, 99 S. Ct. at 1866.  The MCC had a general strip search policy that\napplied to all inmates, id. at 530, 99 S. Ct. at 1869, including pretrial detainees,\n“convicted inmates who [were] awaiting sentencing or transportation to federal\nprison,” “convicted prisoners who [had] been lodged at the facility under writs of\nhabeas corpus . . . issued to ensure their presence at upcoming trials, witnesses in\nprotective custody, and persons incarcerated for contempt,” id. at 524, 99 S. Ct. at\n1866.  \nUnder the MCC’s policy all inmates, regardless of the reason for their\n9\n\ndetention, were required “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a\npart of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from outside\nthe institution.”  Id. at 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1884.  More specifically:  “If the inmate is\na male, he must lift his genitals and bend over to spread his buttocks for visual\ninspection.  The vaginal and anal cavities of female inmates also are visually\ninspected.”  Id. at 558 n.39, 99 S. Ct. at 1884 n.39.\nThe pretrial detainees alleged in their complaint in Bell that the MCC’s strip\nsearch policy violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable\nsearches.  Id. at 526–27 & n.7, 99 S. Ct. at 1868 & n.7.  The district court\nemphatically agreed.  United States ex rel. Wolfish v. Levi, 439 F. Supp. 114,\n146–48 (S.D.N.Y. 1977).  In an overwrought passage crackling with indignation,\nthe court described the postures that the inmates were forced to assume during the\nvisual body cavity searches as “calculated to trigger, in the officer and inmate\nrespectively, feelings of sadism, terror, and incipient masochism that no one alive\ncould have failed to predict.”  Id. at 147.  The court found that on some occasions\n“male correction officers have been incited by the temptation to indulge the sense\nof a cheap machismo” and had made “insultingly suggestive remarks and banal but\nterrifying expressions of aggression” to those being searched.  Id.  It was, the court\ninsisted, a “grisly procedure” and a “loathesome practice.”  Id.  The court credited\n10\n\nthe testimony of some inmates who said that they had found the visual body cavity\nsearches “so high a price as to forego [contact] visits or to feel after a visit that it\nwas not worthwhile.”  Id. \nNot only that, but the district court in Bell also found that visually inspecting\nthe body cavities of inmates after each contact visit had turned up barely any\ncontraband.  Id.  That was not surprising, the court reasoned, given that “inmates\nand their visitors are in full view during the visits and fully clad,” so that “[t]he\nsecreting of objects in rectal or genital areas becomes in this situation an imposing\nchallenge to nerves and agility.”  Id.  In all of the time that the searches had been\nconducted there had been only one occasion when any object—it was a red balloon\ncontaining heroin—had been spotted in an inmate’s vagina.  Wolfish v. Levi, 573\nF.2d 118, 131 (2d Cir. 1978) (“[I]n this case appellants proved only one instance in\nthe MCC’s several years of existence when contraband was found during a body\ncavity inspection.”); Wolfish, 439 F. Supp. at 147.  The visual inspections of\nanuses had never turned up any contraband, a fact that did not surprise the court for\nphysiological reasons it felt compelled to explain.  Wolfish, 439 F. Supp. at 147.\nEven though it recognized that “the prospect of the strip search may serve as\na deterrent to people planning to secrete and import forbidden things,” the district\ncourt believed that deterrence “cannot justify the more extreme and offensive\n11\n\naspects of the strip search.”  Id.  It advised the warden of MCC and the Director of\nthe Bureau of Prisons that they should be most concerned about weapons, which\n“are discoverable by metal detecting devices and, if necessary, other equipment\nemployed for airline security and other purposes.”  Id.  As for “other things, mainly\nnarcotics, that might still be secreted and evade detection,” the court could not say\n“with confidence” how serious that problem may be.  Id.  It could say with\nconfidence, though, that “the goal of absolute security is unattainable, and we must\nassume that some contraband will continue to make its way into jails and prisons,\nas it always has—whether through visitors, guards, lawyers, clergymen, or\notherwise.”  Id. at 148.  \nThat said, the district court in Bell insisted that it was not treating the\nsecurity needs of the detention facility lightly and would let the officials who ran it\n“go as far as may be permitted by the demands of reasonableness in the Fourth\nAmendment and the claims of decency in the Fifth.”  Id.  The court ordered the\ndetention officials to “cease the routine requirements of anal and genital\ninspections after visits.”  Id.  They could perform those inspections only “upon a\nspecific and particular demonstration of probable cause for doing so.”  Id.   \nHowever, the district court in Bell did not curtail all routine strip searches. \nTo the contrary, the court justified its restriction on anal and genital inspections by\n12\n\nstating that:  “[T]he demands of security are amply satisfied if inmates are required\nto disrobe, to have their clothing subjected to inspection, and to present open hands\nand arms to demonstrate the absence of concealed objects.”  Id.  The court allowed\nthose full body visual strip searches, which did not require the inmates to take any\naction to more fully expose their anal or genital areas to inspection, to continue\nwithout any showing of cause.  Id.; see also Bell, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1884\n(“The District Court upheld the strip-search procedure but prohibited the body-\ncavity searches, absent probable cause to believe that the inmate is concealing\ncontraband.”); Wolfish, 573 F.2d at 131 (stating that the district court judge “left\nthe basic strip-search procedures undisturbed, but . . . [h]e prohibited inspection of\nthe genitals and anus unless there is probable cause to believe that the inmate is\nconcealing contraband”).  The district court left the basic strip search procedure in\nplace only “with grave reluctance, inviting reconsideration by wiser judges or [the\ndetention officials] themselves in the more mature wisdom of future times.” \nWolfish, 439 F. Supp. at 148.\nThree decades have passed but the Bureau of Prisons, which administers\nMCC, still has not reached the state of “more mature wisdom” that the district\ncourt in Bell hoped that it would.  A materially identical strip search policy is still\nin effect at all federal detention facilities.  See infra at 23–24.  There was \n13\n\n“reconsideration by wiser judges” of the district court’s decision, but ultimately it\ndid not come out the way that court had hoped. \nOn appeal, the Second Circuit agreed with the district court’s conclusions\nabout the strip searches.  Wolfish, 573 F.2d at 131.  Its reasoning about the body\ncavity inspection part of the strip searches is summed up in these two sentences\nfrom its opinion:  “The gross violation of personal privacy inherent in such a\nsearch cannot be outweighed by the government’s security interest in maintaining a\npractice of so little actual utility.  To speak plainly, in the circumstances presented\nby this record, the procedure shocks one’s conscience.”  Id.  The Second Circuit’s \ndecision nonetheless left the detention officials free to require, even without any\nindividualized cause, full body visual strip searches.  Id.  What the decision\nprohibited, absent probable cause, was forcing inmates to assume postures or take\nother actions that would more fully expose their anal and genital areas to visual\ninspection.  Id.  In other words, the court of appeals affirmed the district court’s\norder on strip searches.  Id.  \nThe Supreme Court did not.  In facing the issue the high court did not\nattempt to airbrush the facts but instead described in unblinking terms how the\nvisual body cavity searches were conducted.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 558 & n.39, 99 S.\nCt. at 1884 & n.39.  Because the district court had upheld the strip search policy\n14\n\nexcept for the body cavity inspections, it was that most intrusive part of the\nsearches that defined the question before the Supreme Court.  See id. at 558, 99 S.\nCt. at 1884.  The Court acknowledged that of the five MCC practices before it, the\nblanket policy of requiring body cavity inspections after each contact visit with\nanyone from the outside “instinctively gives us the most pause.”  Id.  But the Court\ndid not pause long.  It quickly demolished, in just three paragraphs and an equal\nnumber of footnotes, the arguments that the policy violated the Fourth\nAmendment.  Id. at 558–60, 99 S. Ct. at 1884–85.   \nThe Supreme Court did not hold that inmates at a detention facility had any\nFourth Amendment rights to begin with.  It only assumed that they did.  Id. at 558,\n99 S. Ct. at 1884 (“However, assuming for present purposes that inmates, both\nconvicted prisoners and pretrial detainees, retain some Fourth Amendment rights\nupon commitment to a corrections facility . . . .”).  Even with that assumption,\nhowever, the Court concluded that the body cavity inspection searches after every\ncontact visit were constitutionally permissible because the Fourth Amendment\n“prohibits only unreasonable searches, and under the circumstances, we do not\nbelieve that these searches are unreasonable.”  Id. (citation omitted).\nThe Court explained that the reasonableness of a search cannot be\ndetermined by “precise definition or mechanical application,” but instead “requires\n15\n\na balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal\nrights that the search entails.”  Id. at 559, 99 S. Ct. at 1884.  In balancing those\ninterests there are four factors courts must consider:  “the scope of the particular\nintrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and\nthe place in which it is conducted.”  Id.  \nAs for the first factor, the Supreme Court did not “underestimate the degree\nto which these searches may invade the personal privacy of inmates.”  Id. at 560,\n99 S. Ct. at 1885.  It described how intrusive the searches were when it described\nhow they were performed.  Id. at 558 n.39, 99 S. Ct. at 1884 n.39.  And it quoted\nthe Second Circuit’s view that the searches were a “‘gross violation of personal\nprivacy.’”  Id. at 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1884 (quoting Wolfish, 573 F.2d at 131).  As for\nthe second factor, the Court did not “doubt, as the District Court noted, that on\noccasion a security guard may conduct the search in an abusive fashion.”  Id. at\n560, 99 S. Ct. at 1885.  Such abuses are not to be condoned.  Id.  The searches\nmust be conducted in a reasonable manner, but the Court recognized that “we deal\nhere with the question whether visual body-cavity inspections . . . can ever be\nconducted on less than probable cause.”  Id.  (The emphasized “ever” served to\nunderscore the assumption that the searches will be conducted in a non-abusive,\nreasonable manner.) \n16\n\nThe Supreme Court answered that question in the affirmative, and the reason\nit did so was the combined weight of the third and fourth factors—the justification\nfor the searches and the place they were conducted.  Those two factors merged into\none heavy consideration because the searches took place in a detention facility, and\nthe justification for them was the critically important security needs of the facility. \nAs the Court explained:  “A detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious\nsecurity dangers.  Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is\nall too common an occurrence.”  Id. at 559, 99 S. Ct. at 1884.  The Court viewed\nthat factor as a critical one even though the record indicated only one instance in\nthree years “where an MCC inmate was discovered attempting to smuggle\ncontraband into the institution on [her] person.”  Id. at 559, 99 S. Ct. at 1885; see\nalso Wolfish, 439 F. Supp. at 147.  That fact, the Court believed, “may be more a\ntestament to the effectiveness of this search technique as a deterrent than to any\nlack of interest on the part of the inmates to secrete and import such items when the\nopportunity arises.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S. Ct. at 1885.  The Court noted that\nofficials had testified “that visual cavity searches were necessary not only to\ndiscover but also to deter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other contraband\ninto the institution.”  Id. at 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1884.\nThe district court’s position that less intrusive alternatives, such as metal\n17\n\ndetectors, should be used instead of the body cavity inspections was rejected.  For\none thing the Supreme Court was not ready to concede that lesser alternative\nanalysis has any place in the Fourth Amendment area.  Id. at 559 n.40, 99 S. Ct. at\n1885 n.40 (“‘[T]he logic of such elaborate less-restrictive-alternative arguments\ncould raise insuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure\npowers.’” (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428\nU.S. 543, 556–57 n.12, 96 S. Ct. 3074, 3082 n.12 (1976)).  For another thing the\nCourt decided that, even assuming lesser alternatives may be considered, the metal\ndetectors suggested by the district court would not be as effective as visual body\ncavity inspections because metal detectors cannot detect currency, drugs, and other\nnonmetallic contraband.  Id.\nThe bottom line of the Bell decision is that, after “[b]alancing the significant\nand legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of\nthe inmates,” the Supreme Court concluded that the visual body cavity\ninspections—the most intrusive part of the strip searches in that case—were\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at 559–60, 99 S. Ct. at 1884–85. \nThe policy the Court upheld required that searches be conducted on every inmate\nafter each contact visit, even without the slightest cause to suspect that the inmate\nwas concealing contraband.  Id. at 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1884. \n18\n\nC.\nWe are aware that some courts have interpreted the Bell decision as\nrequiring, or at least permitting lower courts to require, reasonable suspicion as a\ncondition for detention facility strip searches, especially those that involve visual\nbody cavity inspections.  See, e.g., Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997)\n(“Balancing these interests, courts have concluded that, to be reasonable under\nWolfish, strip and visual body cavity searches must be justified by at least a\nreasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons. . . . \nAccordingly, it is clear that at least the reasonable suspicion standard governs strip\nand visual body cavity searches in the arrestee context as well.” (citation omitted));\nChapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395 (10th Cir. 1993) (“In this case, it is\nundisputed that plaintiffs were arrested for minor traffic violations and were\nawaiting bail, that jail officials had no reasonable suspicion that these particular\narrestees were likely to be carrying or concealing weapons or drugs, and that\nplaintiffs were searched solely because the blanket policy required all detainees to\nbe subjected to a strip search.  Every circuit court, including our own, which has\nconsidered the above circumstances under the Wolfish balancing test has\nconcluded that a search under these circumstances is unconstitutional.”).  We\nourselves have done that.  Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1343 (“Because Wilson was strip\n19\n\nsearched absent reasonable suspicion, we hold that the search of Wilson, as well as\nthe jail’s policy authorizing her search, violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures.”).  Those decisions misread Bell as\nrequiring reasonable suspicion. \nThe Bell decision, correctly read, is inconsistent with the conclusion that the\nFourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion before an inmate entering or re-\nentering a detention facility may be subjected to a strip search that includes a body\ncavity inspection.  And the decision certainly is inconsistent with the conclusion\nthat reasonable suspicion is required for detention facility strip searches that do not\ninvolve body cavity inspections.  \nFirst, and most fundamentally, the Court in Bell addressed a strip search\npolicy, not any individual searches conducted under it.  The Court spoke\ncategorically about the policy, not specifically about a particular search or an\nindividual inmate.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S. Ct. at 1885; see also Hudson v.\nPalmer, 468 U.S. 517, 538, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 3206 (1984) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (citing Bell for the proposition that “[i]n some contexts, . . . the Court\nhas rejected the case-by-case approach to the ‘reasonableness’ inquiry in favor of\nan approach that determines the reasonableness of contested practices in a\ncategorical fashion”).  The policy that the Court categorically upheld in Bell\n20\n\napplied to all inmates, including those charged with lesser offenses and even those\ncharged with no wrongdoing at all who were being held as witnesses in protective\ncustody.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 524, 99 S. Ct. at 1866.  The policy did not require\nindividualized suspicion.  Just the opposite.  It called for a search of every inmate\nreturning from a contact visit regardless of whether there was any reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that the inmate was concealing contraband.  See id. at 558, 99\nS. Ct. at 1884.\nThe Supreme Court said:  “[A]ssuming for present purposes that inmates,\nboth convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees, retain some Fourth Amendment\nrights upon commitment to a corrections facility, we nonetheless conclude that\nthese searches do not violate that Amendment.”  Id. (citations omitted, emphasis\nadded).  When the Court stated that “these searches” do not violate the Fourth\nAmendment, it obviously meant the searches that were before it, and those\nsearches were conducted under a blanket policy without reasonable suspicion.  It\nreally is that simple.\nIf more is needed, it can be found in Justice Powell’s dissenting opinion in\nBell, the significance of which has been underappreciated.1  Justice Powell\n1  Some, but by no means most, of the discussion in this part of the opinion is borrowed,\noccasionally verbatim, from Evans, 407 F.3d at 1283–92 (Carnes, J., concurring specially), with\nthe gracious consent of the author of that opinion.\n21\n\ndissented for one and only one reason, which was that the Court did not require\nreasonable suspicion for conducting the strip searches in that case.  His opinion, a\nmodel of brevity, states in its entirety:\n         I join the opinion of the Court except the discussion and holding\nwith respect to body-cavity searches.  In view of the serious intrusion\non one’s privacy occasioned by such a search, I think at least some\nlevel of cause, such as a reasonable suspicion, should be required to\njustify the anal and genital searches described in this case.  I therefore\ndissent on this issue.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 563, 99 S. Ct. at 1886 (Powell, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part).  Obviously, Justice Powell would not have dissented from a\nholding that the Court had not made. \nGranted, it can be risky to place too much reliance on dissenting opinions\nbecause they sometimes take a Chicken Little or doomsday approach, exaggerating\naspects of the majority opinion in order to have a bigger target to attack.  Justice\nPowell’s dissent in Bell is not of that type.  It does not attack the majority opinion. \nInstead, it states in three sentences that it disagrees with only one aspect of the\ndecision and that is the failure to require “some level of cause, such as a reasonable\nsuspicion” before the “anal and genital searches described in this case” can be\nperformed.  Id.  If the majority had required reasonable suspicion for body cavity\ninspection strip searches of pretrial detainees, Justice Powell would not have\ndissented at all.  And Justice Marshall would have had one less thing to complain\n22\n\nabout in his separate dissenting opinion.  Id. at 578, 99 S. Ct. at 1894 (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting) (“Here, the searches are employed absent any suspicion of\nwrongdoing.”).\nFrom his perspective inside the Court, Justice Powell (like Justice Marshall)\nhad a far better sense of the majority’s decision in Bell than any of us lower court\njudges could, and he understood that the decision permitted the body cavity\ninspection strip searches without reasonable suspicion.  Confronted with the\ndissenting statements, the majority, if it had not intended to permit those searches\nof pretrial detainees without reasonable suspicion, would have noted as much in its\nopinion.  It would have been a simple matter to do that.  The majority, however,\ndid not change its opinion to state that reasonable suspicion was required because\nJustice Powell’s (and Justice Marshall’s) reading of its opinion was accurate.  The\nBell decision means that the Fourth Amendment does not require reasonable\nsuspicion for this type of strip search in detention facilities.\nThe decisions that conclude to the contrary not only disregard the existence\nof the dissenting opinions, but they also ignore one momentous fact of Franciscan\nsimplicity:  The Bureau of Prisons’ policy has not changed in any material respect. \nUnder that policy body cavity strip searches without reasonable suspicion are\nconducted today just as they were when the Bell lawsuit was brought.  Indeed, the\n23\n\nyear after the Bell decision the Bureau enshrined the policy in a regulation, where\nit remains to this day.  The policy still subjects inmates to strip searches involving\n“a visual inspection of all body surfaces and body cavities” whenever there is\neither a “reasonable belief” or “a good opportunity for concealment has occurred.” \nFed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Program Statement No. 5521.05,\nSearches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas 6(b)(1) (1997)\n(quoting 28 C.F.R. § 552.11(c)(1)).  And the policy specifies that “a good\nopportunity for concealment has occurred,” and the searches are to be performed,\nwhen an inmate is processed into the facility for the first time, when an inmate\nreturns from having any contact with the public, such as during a contact visit, and\nso on.  Id.  That policy applies to federal facilities nationwide.  See Bell, 441 U.S.\nat 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1884.  Yet, so far as we can tell, in the nearly thirty years since\nthe Bell decision was issued no court has attempted to enjoin the Bureau of Prisons\nfrom performing body cavity inspection strip searches without reasonable\nsuspicion.  The reason should be obvious. \nIf the Supreme Court’s decision in Bell had required, or permitted lower\ncourts to require, reasonable suspicion before body cavity strip searches could be\nconducted at detention facilities, the district court in that case would have done so\non remand.  However, the court must have recognized that the Supreme Court’s\n24\n\ndecision did not permit it to require reasonable suspicion before the searches could\nbe performed.  All other courts should recognize as much.  \nSome courts fail to recognize that because they misread one sentence from\nthe Bell opinion.  See, e.g., Swain, 117 F.3d at 6; Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 800\n(2d Cir. 1986).  In that sentence the Supreme Court said:  “But we deal here with\nthe question whether visual body-cavity inspections as contemplated by the\n[facility’s] rules can ever be conducted on less than probable cause.”  Bell, 441\nU.S. at 560, 99 S. Ct. at 1885.  The Court answered “yes,” but neither the question\nnor the answer compels the conclusion that “less than probable cause” means\n“reasonable suspicion.”  The absence of reasonable suspicion is also “less than\nprobable cause.”  The context of that sentence, which we have already discussed,\nsee supra at 16, is also important.  In the sentences that came before that one the\nCourt had acknowledged that some guards may conduct the visual body cavity\nsearches in an abusive fashion.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S. Ct. at 1885; see also\nWolfish, 439 F. Supp. at 147.  The “ever” referred to searches that did not involve\nabuse.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S. Ct. at 1885.  \nInterpreting the quoted sentence from Bell to require reasonable suspicion\nputs more weight on it than the words will bear.  Doing so also ignores the rest of\nthe majority opinion as well as the dissenters’ interpretation of it, see id. at 563, 99\n25\n\nS. Ct. at 1886 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); id. at 578, 99\nS. Ct. at 1894 (Marshall, J., dissenting), an interpretation that the majority\nimplicitly accepted by not modifying its opinion to require reasonable suspicion.  \nAnd it ignores the fact that the same searches that were being conducted without\nreasonable suspicion at MCC when Bell was decided are still being conducted\nwithout reasonable suspicion there and at every other federal detention facility in\nthe country.2 \nOne other point is worth discussing.  In judging the constitutionality of strip\nsearches for detainees, some other circuits draw a distinction between whether the\nperson has been arrested on a felony charge or just for a misdemeanor or some\nother lesser violation.  See, e.g., Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.\n1989); Stewart v. Lubbock County, Tex., 767 F.2d 153, 156–57 (5th Cir. 1985);\nGiles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984), overruled on other grounds\nby Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1041 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999) (en\nbanc); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).\nWhile those decisions vary in detail around the edges, the picture they paint\nis essentially the same.  The arrestee is charged with committing a misdemeanor or\nsome other lesser violation and, while being booked into the detention facility, she\n2  The parties have not cited and we have been unable to find any post-Bell decision\nenjoining any type of strip search at any federal detention facility. \n26\n\nis subjected to a strip search pursuant to the facility’s policy.  She later sues the\nofficials asserting that the search was unconstitutional because the guards did not\nhave any reasonable basis for believing that she was hiding contraband on her\nperson.  See, e.g., Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1266.  In each cited case, the court of\nappeals concludes that because the plaintiffs were “minor offenders who were not\ninherently dangerous,” id. at 1272, detention officials could conduct a strip search\nonly where there was “a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is\ncarrying or concealing contraband,” Giles, 746 F.2d at 617.  In each of the cases\nwhere reasonable suspicion was lacking, the search is held to violate the Fourth\nAmendment.\nThose decisions are wrong.  The difference between felonies and\nmisdemeanors or other lesser offenses is without constitutional significance when\nit comes to detention facility strip searches.  It finds no basis in the Bell decision,\nin the reasoning of that decision, or in the real world of detention facilities.  The\nSupreme Court made no distinction in Bell between detainees based on whether\nthey had been charged with misdemeanors or felonies or even with no crime at all. \nInstead, the policy that the Court treated categorically, and upheld categorically,\nwas one under which all “[i]nmates at all Bureau of Prison facilities, including the\nMCC, are required to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a\n27\n\nstrip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the\ninstitution.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1884.  It was a blanket policy\napplicable to all.  \nAmong the “[i]nmates at all Bureau of Prison facilities, including the MCC,”\nwere detainees facing only lesser charges, people incarcerated for contempt of\ncourt, and witnesses in protective custody who had not been accused of doing\nanything wrong.  See id. at 524 & n.3, 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1866 & n. 3, 1884.  The\nMCC was hardly a facility where all of the detainees were “awaiting trial on\nserious federal charges,” as some of the opinions incorrectly state.3  See, e.g., Mary\nBeth G., 723 F.2d at 1272.  It is on that basis that some of the decisions involving\ncounty jails erroneously distinguish what they describe as the exaggerated need for\nstrip searches at that type of facility from the real need for them at federal\nfacilities.4  Id.  \n3  Nor was the MCC facility some special sort of seething cauldron of criminality.  The\nSupreme Court described it this way:  “The MCC differs markedly from the familiar image of a\njail; there are no barred cells, dank, colorless corridors, or clanging steel gates.  It was intended\nto include the most advanced and innovative features of modern design of detention facilities.” \nBell, 441 U.S. at 525, 99 S. Ct. at 1866.  Yet, the Supreme Court found that “serious security\ndangers” warranted the strip search policy at MCC and all federal detention facilities.  Id. at 559,\n99 S. Ct. at 1884.\n4  Even if we were to buy into that distinction, which we do not, it would not make any\ndifference in this case.  The Fulton County Jail is a large detention facility, housing about 2,900\ninmates, some of whom are charged with or have been convicted of felonies.  (See R6:78:¶102);\nsee also Foster v. Fulton County, Ga., 223 F. Supp. 2d 1292, 1294 (N.D. Ga. 2002); Foster v.\nFulton County, Ga., 223 F. Supp. 2d 1301, 1308 (N.D. Ga. 2002).\n28\n\nThe need for strip searches at all detention facilities, including county jails,\nis not exaggerated.  Employees, visitors, and (not least of all) the detained inmates\nthemselves face a real threat of violence, and administrators must be concerned on\na daily basis with the smuggling of contraband by inmates accused of\nmisdemeanors as well as those accused of felonies.  See Clements v. Logan, 454\nU.S. 1304, 1305, 102 S. Ct. 284, 286 (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice) (noting that the\njail’s strip search policy had been “adopted after the shooting of a deputy by a\nmisdemeanant who had not been strip-searched”), vacated, 454 U.S. 1117, 102 S.\nCt. 961 (1981); Johannes v. Alameda County Sheriff’s Dep’t, No. C 04-458MHP,\n2006 WL 2504400, at *4–6  (N.D. Cal. Aug. 29, 2006) (discussing in statistical\ndetail as well as practical terms the contraband problem at a large county jail and\nthe usefulness of strip searches in combating it); Dodge v. County of Orange, 282\nF. Supp. 2d 41, 46–49 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (discussing testimony that strip searches\nwere essential to prevent gangs from smuggling in contraband to the county jail),\nappeal dismissed, 103 F. App’x 688 (2d Cir. 2004).  Even some of the circuits that\nhave required reasonable suspicion for searches of those arrested for misdemeanors\nconcede that there have been instances where contraband was smuggled into a jail\nby detainees facing only misdemeanor or other lesser charges.  See, e.g., Mary\nBeth G., 723 F.2d at 1272–73.\n29\n\nThen there is the fact that gang members commit misdemeanors as well as\nfelonies.  In one county jail, for example, fifty percent of those being held on\n“misdemeanor or lesser charges” were gang members.  Dodge, 282 F. Supp. 2d at\n48 & n.9 (citing figures from 2002).  “Gang members are often more violent,\ndangerous, and manipulative than other inmates, regardless of the nature of the\ncharges against them.”  Id. at 48.  Moreover, some gang members “attempt to\ncoerce family members or to coerce, cajole, or intimidate lesser violators into\nsmuggling contraband into the facility.”  Id.  To make matters worse, “officials at a\ncounty jail . . . usually know very little about the new inmates they receive or the\nsecurity risks they present at the time of their arrival.”  Id.  The officials usually\nhave no way of knowing whether someone coming into the detention facility after\nan arrest on a misdemeanor or other minor offense is only a minor offender or is\nalso a gang member who got himself arrested so that he could serve as a mule\nsmuggling contraband in to other members.  \nThese reasons support the expert opinion of jail administrators that all of\nthose who are to be detained in the general population of a detention facility should\nbe strip searched when they enter or re-enter it.  Id. at 49 (“All jail personnel who\ntestified at this trial, including plaintiffs’ expert, Robert Joseph DeRosa, testified\nthat, if they could, they would strip search every newly arrived inmate, regardless\n30\n\nof what brought him or her to their facility, in order to minimize the risk of\nintroduction of contraband.”).  \nThe Supreme Court has instructed us that jailers and corrections officials\n“should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of\npolicies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order\nand discipline and to maintain institutional security.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.\nCt. at 1878.  It has also explained that “judicial deference is accorded not merely\nbecause the administrator ordinarily will, as a matter of fact in a particular case,\nhave a better grasp of his domain than the reviewing judge, but also because the\noperation of our correctional facilities is peculiarly the province of the Legislative\nand Executive Branches of our Government, not the Judicial.”  Id. at 548, 99 S. Ct.\nat 1879 (citing Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405, 94 S. Ct. 1800, 1807\n(1974)).  Decisions that carve out misdemeanor arrestees at county facilities for\nspecial treatment do not afford those who run detention facilities the “wide-ranging\ndeference” the Supreme Court has mandated.  The courts issuing those decisions\nhave also failed to explain why misdemeanor arrestees in a county detention\nfacility are entitled to more favorable Fourth Amendment treatment than those\nbeing detained for contempt of court or as witnesses in protective custody at a\nfederal detention facility were afforded by the Supreme Court in Bell. \n31\n\nThe decisions acknowledging Bell but reaching a contrary result are clothed\nin the language of distinction and difference, but at least one of them appeared to\nthe author of the Bell decision himself to be thinly disguised defiance.  In\nClements, then Justice Rehnquist issued a stay of the decision in Logan v. Shealy,\n660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1981).  Clements, 454 U.S. at 1310, 102 S. Ct. at 288\n(Rehnquist, Circuit Justice).  The court of appeals had decided that the strip search\nof a woman who was booked into the county jail on a charge of driving while\nintoxicated violated the Fourth Amendment.  As Justice Rehnquist saw it, the\nFourth Circuit had “recited from Bell v. Wolfish the general standard by which\nsearches are judged under the Fourth Amendment, but it chose to ignore the\nCourt’s application of that standard to the practice of conducting strip-searches of\npersons detained after being charged with a crime.”  Id. at 1309, 102 S. Ct. at 288. \nIn lambasting what the court of appeals had done, he complained:  “In short, the\nCourt of Appeals decision reads as if Bell v.Wolfish had never been decided. \nMuch as that may have been the desire of the lower court, the decision is\nauthoritative precedent and I believe it clearly dictates a contrary result in this\ncase.”  Id. at 1310, 102 S. Ct. at 288.5  We recognize the Bell decision as\n5 The Supreme Court vacated the stay that Justice Rehnquist had issued to permit the\nCourt to consider the certiorari petition, Clements, 454 U.S. 1117, 1117, 102 S.Ct. 961, 961\n(1981), and then denied the petition, Clements, 455 U.S. 942, 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 1435 (1982). \nOur dissenting colleague finds this fact “highly salient” because of her mistaken belief that the\n32\n\nauthoritative precedent and reach the result it dictates in this case.\ndenial of certiorari and vacation of the stay means that “Justice Rehnquist’s reading of Bell was\nrejected by the Supreme Court.” Dissenting op. at 4.  The implicit premise of the syllogism that\ninforms her misunderstanding about this point is that the denial of certiorari or vacation of a stay\nis an indication of the Court’s view on the merits.  It is not.  \nFor at least eight decades the Supreme Court has instructed us, time and again, over and\nover,  that the denial of certiorari does not in any way or to any extent reflect or imply any view\non the merits.  See, e.g., United States  v. Carver, 260 U.S. 482, 490, 43 S.Ct. 181, 182 (1923)\n(“The denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case,\nas the bar has been told many times.”); House v. Mayo, 324 U.S. 42, 48, 65 S.Ct. 517, 521\n(1945) (“[A]s we have often said, a denial of certiorari by this Court imports no expression of\nopinion upon the merits of a case.”), overruled on other grounds by Hohn v. United States, 524\nU.S. 236, 118 S.Ct. 1969 (1998); Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, 338 U.S. 912, 919, 70\nS.Ct. 252, 255 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., opinion respecting the denial of certiorari) (“Inasmuch,\ntherefore, as all that a denial of a petition for a writ of certiorari means is that fewer than four\nmembers of the Court thought it should be granted, this Court has rigorously insisted that such a\ndenial carries with it no implication whatever regarding the Court’s views on the merits of a case\nwhich it has declined to review.  The Court has said this again and again; again and again the\nadmonition has to be repeated.”); Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363,\n365 n.1, 93 S.Ct. 647, 650 n.1 (1973) (reiterating “the well-settled view that denial of certiorari\nimparts no implication or inference concerning the Court’s view of the merits.”); Teague v.\nLane,  489 U.S. 288, 296, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1067–68 (1989) (“As we have often stated, the denial\nof a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case.  The variety\nof considerations that underlie denials of the writ counsels against according denials of certiorari\nany precedential value.”) (citations, marks, and brackets omitted); Evans v. Stephens, 544 U.S.\n942, 942, 125 S.Ct. 2244, 2244 (2005) (Stevens, J., opinion respecting the denial of certiorari)\n(“On several occasions in the past, I have found it appropriate to emphasize the fact that a denial\nof certiorari is not a ruling on the merits of any issue raised by the petition.”).  \nBecause the denial of certiorari implies no view of the merits, the denial or vacation of a\nstay that was entered to permit consideration of a certiorari petition logically cannot imply any\nview of the merits either.  We have previously held exactly that at least twice.  Ford v.\nStrickland, 734 F.2d 538, 542 (11th Cir. 1984) (reiterating that the Supreme Court’s “denial of a\nstay pending filing and disposition of a writ of certiorari imports no more than a decision to deny\ncertiorari, which does not express any views on the merits of the claims presented.”) (citation\nand internal marks omitted);  Ritter v. Smith, 726 F.2d 1505, 1511 (11th Cir. 1984) (holding that\nthe Supreme Court’s vacation of a stay, like its denial of a stay, pending certiorari “imports no\nmore than a decision to deny certiorari, which does not express any views on the merits of the\nclaims presented,” and that is true even when it was done in a co-defendant’s case).  \n33\n\nD. \n          The strip searches of the five plaintiffs before us did not include body cavity\ninspections.  Indeed, the full body visual searches performed on them are exactly\nwhat even the district court in Bell grudgingly recognized would be reasonable.6 \nSee Bell, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S. Ct. at 1884; Wolfish, 573 F.2d at 131; Wolfish,\n439 F. Supp. at 148.  If these plaintiffs had been strip searched after contact visits\nat the Fulton County Jail, instead of as part of the booking process, their claims\nwould not have a prayer of surviving even the most cursory reading of Bell.  Their\nbest hope for distinguishing Bell lies in the fact that they were strip searched as\npart of the booking process instead of after contact visits. \nOf course, an inmate’s initial entry into a detention facility might be viewed\nas coming after one big and prolonged contact visit with the outside world.  There\nis no denying that arrestees entering a detention facility usually have had plenty of\ncontact with outsiders, most having been outsiders themselves until they were\n6  Indeed, the searches of these plaintiffs came immediately after each one had taken a\ngroup shower with the other incoming detainees of the same sex and before they put on their jail\njumpsuit.  (R6:78:¶¶181–83, 238–40.)  The strip searches consisted of one or more guards\nviewing the front and back sides of the plaintiffs’ naked bodies.  (Id. ¶¶183, 240.)  The exposure\nof flesh was no greater than occurred in the shower itself.  We do not think it is open to serious\ndispute that inmates of the same sex may be required to shower together and that guards of that\nsex may watch them while they are showering to prevent any misconduct.  See generally, Oliver\nv. Scott, 276 F.3d 736, 746 (5th Cir. 2002); Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 145–46 (7th Cir.\n1995); Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093, 1101–02 (8th Cir. 1990).  It necessarily follows that this\ntype of visual strip search is not unconstitutional. \n34\n\narrested.  What the plaintiffs argue is that with contact visits detainees have enough\nnotice and time to arrange for contraband to be brought to them, while that is not\nthe case with newly arriving arrestees.  Arrests, they insist, are not anticipated and\nas a result provide no chance for one to obtain and conceal contraband. \nThe factual premise of this argument is unsupportable.  Not everyone who is\narrested is surprised, seized, and slapped into handcuffs without a moment’s notice. \nSome people surrender when they are notified that a warrant for them is\noutstanding.  Those who do not turn themselves in often have notice that officers\nare coming to arrest them.  Even those in a vehicle who are pulled over and\narrested may have time to hide items on their person before the officer reaches the\ncar door.  Then there are those who deliberately get themselves arrested.  \nDemonstrators or protestors engaged in civil disobedience are one example.  \nAnother example, as we mentioned earlier, is gang members who get themselves\narrested just so they can smuggle in contraband.  They have all the time they need\nto plan their arrests and conceal items on their persons.  \nThe point is that there are plenty of situations where arrestees would have\nhad at least as much opportunity to conceal contraband as would inmates on a\ncontact visit, which is the situation Bell involved.  See Wolfish, 439 F. Supp. at\n147 (“[I]nmates and their visitors are in full view during the [contact] visits and\n35\n\nfully clad.  The secreting of objects in rectal or genital areas becomes in this\nsituation an imposing challenge to nerves and agility.”).\nIn conclusion, assuming that arrestees being booked into a jail or detention\nfacility retain some Fourth Amendment rights, see Bell, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S. Ct.\nat 1884,7 those rights are not violated by a policy or practice of strip searching each\none of them as part of the booking process, provided that the searches are no more\nintrusive on privacy interests than those upheld in the Bell case.  We also assume,\nof course, that the searches are not conducted in an abusive manner.  Because the\npart of our Wilson decision finding a constitutional violation under the facts of that\ncase, Wilson, 251 F.3d at 1343, is inconsistent with our reasoning here, we\noverrule it.  We also disavow any dicta to the same effect as the Wilson decision. \nSee, e.g., Skurstenis, 236 F.2d at 682.\nIII.\nInsofar as the district court dismissed the Fourth Amendment point-of-entry\nstrip search claims of the “the Arrestee Strip Search Class (AR Group),” we\nAFFIRM its decision.  We REMAND the case back to the panel to apply the\n7  This assumption and our reasoning make it unnecessary to decide whether, as the\ndefendants insist, Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 104 S. Ct. 3194 (1984), means that inmates\nhave no right to privacy.  We do note, without endorsement or criticism, that one of our\ndecisions concludes that jail inmates retain a right to bodily privacy that implicates the Fourth\nAmendment.  See Fortner v. Thomas, 983 F.2d 1024, 1026 (11th Cir. 1993) (“As a matter of first\nimpression in this circuit, we hold that a prisoner retains a constitutional right to bodily\nprivacy.”).\n36\n\nprinciples we have discussed in this opinion to the other two groups of plaintiffs in\nthis case, which it denominated the “Alpha Strip Search Class (AL Group)” and the\n“Court Return Strip Search Class (CR Group).”\n37\n\nEDMONDSON, Circuit Judge, Concurring:\nI do not write in a complaining spirit.  I unhesitatingly concur in the Court's\njudgment and in almost all of today's Court opinion.  I write separately because I\nthink it is jurisprudentially unsound to look at a Justice's dissenting opinion to\ndetermine what the Supreme Court has decided in a case. \nTo the degree that our Court today seems to make some verifying use--I\nthink unnecessarily--of this approach, I cannot join it.\n38\n\nBARKETT, Circuit Judge, Dissenting:\nI believe the majority misreads Bell as justifying a balancing test that is\nsatisfied by the mere fact that the strip searches take place in jails. The complaint\nalleges the automatic strip-searching, in a group, of arrestees charged with petty\nmisdemeanors when there is no cause whatsoever to suspect the individuals of\nconcealing contraband.  No justification for these invasive searches is alleged and\nthere are no other facts before us at this juncture to permit upholding these searches\nunder the Bell balancing test.  Under the longstanding, widely-held reading of Bell,\nwith which I agree, the plaintiffs have stated a valid constitutional claim for a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.\nA.  Applying the Bell Balancing Test to the Complaint\nLike the majority, I recognize and appreciate the deference due to jail\nadministrators as they fulfill their charge of ensuring security in jails, not only for\nthe jail officials but also for the inmates.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520,\n547–48 (1979).  At the same time, “convicted prisoners do not forfeit all\nconstitutional protections by reason of their conviction and confinement in prison.” \nId. at 545.  This principle applies with at least as much force to individuals\ndetained prior to their trial on petty misdemeanor charges such as failing to pay\nchild support, driving without a license, or trespassing.  See id.  These protections,\n39\n\nsuch as the right to be free from degrading, humiliating, and dehumanizing\ntreatment and the right to bodily integrity, include protection against forced\nnakedness during strip searches in front of others.  See Boxer X v. Harris, 437 F.3d\n1107, 1111 (11th Cir. 2006) (“We have reaffirmed the privacy rights of prisoners\nemphasizing the harm of compelled nudity.” (citing Padgett v. Donald, 401 F.3d\n1273, 1281 (11th Cir. 2005))).1\nI recognize that even these rights can be circumscribed given adequate\ncause.  The question is whether there is adequate cause to permit the intrusive\nsearches of these arrestees.  The Supreme Court in Bell instructed the lower courts\nto answer that question by considering the following four factors: (1) the\n1  Additionally, in Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 192 (11th Cir. 1992),\nwe stated:\nIt is axiomatic that a strip search represents a serious intrusion upon personal\nrights.  In Mary Beth G., the court referred to strip searches as “demeaning,\ndehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing,\nrepulsive, signifying degradation and submission.”  Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at\n1272.  Another court described the indignity individuals arrested for minor\noffenses experience in the following manner:\nThe experience of disrobing and exposing one’s self for visual\ninspection by a stranger clothed with the uniform and authority of\nthe state, in an enclosed room inside a jail, can only be seen as\nthoroughly degrading and frightening.  Moreover, the imposition\nof such a search upon an individual detained for a lesser offense is\nquite likely to take that person by surprise, thereby exacerbating\nthe terrifying quality of the event.\nJohn Does 1-100 v. Boyd, 613 F. Supp. 1514, 1522 (D. Minn. 1985).  One\ncommentator has gone so far as to describe strip searches as “visual rape.”  See\nShuldiner, Visual Rape:  A Look at the Dubious Legality of Strip Searches, 13 J.\nMarshall L. Rev. 278 (1980).\n40\n\njustification for initiating the search; (2) the scope of the particular intrusion; (3)\nthe manner in which the search is conducted; and (4) the place in which it is\nconducted.  441 U.S. at 559.  It did so based on a fully developed trial record,\nwhich detailed the procedure in place, the asserted justifications for the procedure,\nand the alleged violations of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  Id. at 528, 559.\nFor almost thirty years, circuit courts have followed the Bell Court’s\ninstructions and, until today, universally held that reasonable suspicion is\nnecessary to constitutionally justify the types of searches before us.  See Wilson v.\nJones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir. 2001); Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\nCir. 1997); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989); Weber v.\nDell, 804 F.2d 796, 804 (2d Cir. 1986); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, 741–42\n(8th Cir. 1985); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156–57 (5th Cir. 1985);\nGiles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984), overruled on other grounds\nby Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999) (en\nbanc); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394–95 (10th Cir. 1984); Mary Beth G. v.\nCity of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d\n1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981).\nThe Supreme Court has never found it necessary to contradict the unanimous\nview of the circuit courts that required reasonable suspicion for strip searches over\n41\n\nthe past three decades.  Quite the opposite.  When the Court had the opportunity, it\nrefused to do so.  In Logan v. Shealy, after a trial, the Fourth Circuit enjoined a\ndetention center from applying its blanket policy of strip-searching all booked\nindividuals.  660 F.2d at 1013.  The Fourth Circuit determined that the strip search\nof Logan—who was arrested for a DWI offense—had no “discernible relationship\nto security needs at the Detention Center that, when balanced against the ultimate\ninvasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably be thought justified.”  Id. \nAs the majority notes, in an order staying the injunction issued by the Fourth\nCircuit, Justice Rehnquist, in an individual opinion as Circuit Justice,  strongly\nexpressed his belief that the Fourth Circuit misapplied Bell by failing to give\nproper weight to the security concerns identified by the law enforcement officials\nas justification for the search.  Clements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1304, 1309–10\n(Rehnquist, Circuit Justice), vacated, 454 U.S. 1117 (1981).  However,  Justice\nRehnquist’s reading of Bell was rejected by the Supreme Court, as evidenced by\nthe vacation of the stay and the denial of certiorari.  This is highly salient because,\nin essence, the majority’s argument merely repackages the interpretation of Bell\nthat Justice Rehnquist futilely advanced in Clements.\nToday, the majority reads the balancing test out of Bell and effectively\nestablishes a per se rule permitting automatic strip searches of all detainees,\n42\n\nregardless of their status, in the name of security and administrative convenience. \nBut Bell did not validate strip searches in detention settings per se.  441 U.S. at\n559; Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 113 (1st Cir. 2001) (“Bell has not\nbeen read as holding that the security interests of a detention facility will always\noutweigh the privacy interests of the detainees.” (quoting Dobrowolskyj v.\nJefferson County, 823 F.2d 955, 957 (6th Cir. 1987))); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at\n1272.  Instead, the Supreme Court explained, “[t]he test of reasonableness under\nthe Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical\napplication.  In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular\nsearch against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.”  Bell, 441\nU.S. at 559 (emphasis added).  As this language makes clear, the Bell balancing\ntest is case-specific and there is no general rule rendering the allegations before us\ninadequate to state a claim.\nNor does the fact that Bell upheld a blanket policy, after a trial, mean that\nthe Supreme Court implicitly rejected a finding that reasonable suspicion is ever\nnecessary to justify strip searches or strip search policies.  This is too broad a\nconstitutional principle to derive from an allegedly implicit holding of the Supreme\nCourt.  A more reasonable interpretation would be that the Supreme Court did not\nneed to address the issue because reasonable suspicion was present in the\n43\n\nevidentiary record based on the detainees’ planned contact with outsiders knowing\nthey would be returning to the general population of the detention center after the\nvisit.  Id. at 558; Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64 (2nd Cir. 2001) (“Second, and\nmore important, Bell authorized strip searches after contact visits, where\ncontraband often is passed.”).2  Such a reading would be consistent with the\nSupreme Court’s description of the issue as dealing only with the need for probable\ncause.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 560.\nThe majority also reads too much into the dissents of Justice Powell and\nJustice Marshall to support its argument that the Supreme Court implicitly\nsanctioned strip searches without reasonable suspicion.  The reading more\nconsistent with judicial rules of construction is that Justice Powell wanted the\nSupreme Court to decide more than it was willing to decide, namely, to explicitly\narticulate a level of cause necessary to justify the searches.  See Kennedy v. Los\nAngeles Police Dep’t, 901 F.2d 702, 715 (9th Cir. 1990) (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at\n2 Reading a finding of reasonable suspicion into Bell is consistent with the precedent in a\nnumber of circuit courts—including our own—that have found reasonable suspicion sufficient to\njustify strip searches of individuals based on the nature of the charged offense that led to their\narrest or other behavioral indicators.  See, e.g., Hicks v. Moore, 422 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir.\n2005) (“We accept that a person’s being charged with a crime of violence is sufficient to evoke\nreasonable suspicion that the person may be concealing weapons or contraband.”); see also\nThompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir. 1989) (holding that reasonable\nsuspicion existed to strip-search an inmate upon introduction to the general jail population based\non nature of the charges); Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 887 (1st Cir. 1983) (upholding strip\nsearches of inmates upon their return from the infirmary).\n44\n\n563 (Powell, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part)).  The Bell majority was\nwilling to say that probable cause was not necessary but was unwilling to state any\nmore than that.  This silence cannot be construed to mean that the Supreme Court\nrejected the notion that the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion to\njustify strip searches of misdemeanor detainees.  If the Bell Court had intended to\nrestrict lower courts from making that determination, it would have just said so.\nIn the case before us, the majority purports to apply the Bell balancing test to\nthe complaint.  However, the allegations of the complaint do not include any facts\nthat support the majority’s conclusion that justification exists for the strip searches\nof these appellants.  Facts regarding the jail administration’s justification for the\npolicy are simply absent because there is no evidentiary record at this stage.  Given\nthis absence, it is no surprise that neither the Supreme Court nor any circuit court\nhas found constitutional this type of strip-search policy on a motion to dismiss.3\nThe majority says that the policy is justified on the basis of generalized\nsecurity concerns, citing the records of cases that describe contraband problems of\nspecific detention facilities other than the Fulton County Jail.  Although\ngeneralized security concerns might be relevant in a Bell analysis, simply saying\n3  Several courts have noted the general problem of applying the Bell balancing test to\naffirm a dismissal of a complaint.  See, e.g., Beaulieu v. Ludeman, No. 07-CV-1535, 2008 WL\n2498241, at *12 (D. Minn. June 18, 2008) (“[T]his Court does not have before it any facts to\nassist it in evaluating the factors necessary to determine if the alleged blanket strip search policy\nin this case is appropriate.”).\n45\n\njails typically are dangerous places is not a sufficient “justification for initiating”\nthe strip searches under Bell.  Generalized security concerns cannot be enough to\njustify an infringement of such magnitude—an infringement that involves an\nintrusion of the most intimate sort.  I believe the majority’s reliance on factual\nfindings unrelated to the specific situation at the Fulton County Jail is an\nabdication of our responsibility to weigh the significant competing\ninterests—particularly the justification for the search—on the basis of specific\nfacts.\nTo adequately weigh the justification for a search against the privacy\nconcerns that Bell recognized, there has be an institution-specific justification for\nthe policy.  Should such justification be offered, deference might be due.  There is\na difference, however, between deference and abdication of our duty to perform the\nweighing function with which we have been charged.  See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at\n712 (“When litigants petition the federal courts to review the application of an\ninstitutional policy, the courts must proceed cautiously; the Supreme Court has\nsounded this warning emphatically and with considerable wisdom.  Yet, at the\nsame time, we must be equally careful not to abdicate our function as the guardians\nof the Constitution.”).\n46\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court in Bell specifically noted that deference is not\ndue when there is “substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials\nhave exaggerated their response to these considerations.”  441 U.S. at 548 (quoting\nPell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 827 (1974)).  Automatically strip-searching all\npretrial misdemeanor detainees absent any suspicion that such detainees pose a\nsecurity threat and anything indicating they were aware that they were going to be\narrested is the exaggerated response which Bell cautioned against.4  “[A]rrest and\nconfinement in the [county jail] are unplanned events, so the policy could not\npossibly deter arrestees from carrying contraband.”  Giles, 746 F.2d at 617.\n  These appellees differ significantly from those in Bell, where the strip-\nsearched plaintiffs had advance knowledge of their return to the general jail\npopulation after their planned interactions with outsiders.  Again, as other circuit\ncourts have recognized, the reasonable need for inspection in the Bell scenario is\nsimply not present after the unplanned arrest of individuals for petty misdemeanors\nunrelated to contraband.  See, e.g., Shain, 273 F.3d at 64; Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111\n(“[T]he deterrent rationale for the Bell search is simply less relevant given the\nessentially unplanned nature of an arrest and subsequent incarceration.”); Giles,\n4 And if, for example, Powell was such a threat, he would not have been committed to the\nFulton County Jail for over twenty-four hours without being strip-searched.  See Logan, 660\nF.2d at 1013 (finding relevant that “when strip-searched, [the plaintiff] had been at the Detention\nCenter for one and one-half hours without even a pat-down search”).\n47\n\n746 F.2d at 617.  The majority’s assertion that pretrial detainees booked on petty\nmisdemeanor charges might anticipate their arrests or that gang members might\ndeliberately get arrested in order to smuggle weapons and drugs into jail is\nunwarranted speculation in this case.  See generally Shain, 273 F.3d at 64 (“Unlike\npersons already in jail who receive contact visits, arrestees do not ordinarily have\nnotice that they are about to be arrested and thus an opportunity to hide something. \nFor the exceptions—for example, a person who is allowed to visit the bathroom\nunescorted before an arrest—reasonable suspicion may well exist.”).\nIt is simply unreasonable to assume that individuals arrested on\nmisdemeanor charges not giving rise to reasonable suspicion are going about their\ndaily lives carrying contraband in such a way as to be discoverable only by a strip\nsearch.  More to the point, it is an exaggerated response to strip-search all pretrial\nmisdemeanor detainees on the basis of this speculative concern.  Although easier\nand more convenient to simply subject all detainees to a blanket policy, the\nindiscriminate strip searches before us “cannot be justified simply on the basis of\nadministrative ease in attending to security considerations.”  Roberts, 239 F.3d at\n113 (quoting Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013); see also Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d\n393, 396 (10th Cir. 1993); see generally Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 346 (1993)\n(Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting “the clear holding of our cases that ‘administrative\n48\n\nconvenience’ is a thoroughly inadequate basis for the deprivation of core\nconstitutional rights”).  As the Ninth Circuit noted, intermingling alone is an\ninsufficient justification because the practice is inherently “limited and avoidable.” \nGiles, 746 F.2d at 619.  And, to echo the concern voiced by the First Circuit, “[t]o\nplace so much weight on one (potentially alterable) characteristic of the state\nprison system would gut the balancing approach endorsed by the Supreme Court in\nBell . . . .”  Roberts, 239 F.3d at 113.\nMoreover, the current existence of less-intrusive alternatives to strip-\nsearching is instructive in an assessment of the strength of the justification for the\nstrip search policy.  Metal detectors would be effective in discovering metallic\nweapons, discounting—at least, to some degree—the safety rationale.  And, in this\ncase, Powell points to the availability of new technology that could detect non-\nmetallic contraband as well.  Thus, assuming all else being equal, the search in the\ninstant case is less reasonable than the one in Bell because of the present\navailability of less intrusive but equally effective means of achieving the important\ngoal of jail safety.\nThe Bell test also requires courts to examine “the scope of the particular\nintrusion.”  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  In its balancing, the Bell Court noted the highly\nintrusive nature of the strip and visual body-cavity searches.  Id. at 560 (“We do\n49\n\nnot underestimate the degree to which these searches may invade the personal\nprivacy of inmates.”).  Even the least invasive strip search is highly intrusive.  See,\ne.g., Kirkpatrick v. City of Los Angeles, 803 F.2d 485, 489–90 (9th Cir. 1986)\n(“[T]he fact that a strip search is conducted reasonably, without touching and\noutside the view of all persons other than the party performing the search, does not\nnegate the fact that a strip search is a significant intrusion on the person searched.”)\n(citation omitted);  Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1446 (“The feelings of humiliation and\ndegradation associated with forcibly exposing one’s nude body to strangers for\nvisual inspection is beyond dispute.”).  Furthermore, as our own precedent\nrecognizes, the general harm of forced nudity is often even greater when imposed\nupon a misdemeanor detainee given that such treatment “is quite likely to take that\nperson by surprise, thereby exacerbating the terrifying quality of the event.” \nJustice, 961 F.2d at 192 (quoting John Does 1-100, 613 F. Supp. at 1522).\nTurning to the remaining “manner” and “place” prongs of the Bell balancing\ntest, I note that the strip searches in this case took place in rooms of 30 to 40\npeople as a matter of course.5  The presence of others likewise militates against the\nreasonableness of the searches.  See, e.g., Masters, 872 F.2d at 1250, 1254;\n5 In Bell, the policy subjected detainees to individual searches, although in practice,\nprisoners were sometimes searched in the presence of other inmates.  See 441 U.S. at 577\n(Marshall, J., dissenting).\n50\n\nEdwards, 770 F.2d at 742; Hill, 735 F.2d at 394.  The majority discounts this factor\nby noting that detainees in the Fulton County Jail are observed during a required\ngroup shower.  While the amount of exposed flesh might remain constant, the level\nof scrutiny surely differs when a jail official monitors the detainees during a group\nshower for physical altercations as opposed to when a jail official closely\nscrutinizes an individual for contraband during a strip search.  Moreover, the\nobservation of group showers was not at issue in this case and had never been\naddressed by this circuit before the majority’s cursory treatment of the issue in a\nfootnote.\nB.  The Detainees in the Other Groups Were Entitled to Immediate Release\nFinally, the majority remands the case back to the panel to apply the\nprinciples discussed in the opinion to the Alpha Strip Search Class (AL Group) and\nthe Court Return Strip Search Class (CR Group).  Members of these groups were\nentitled to release and could not be legally detained any longer.  Powell v. Barrett,\n496 F.3d 1288, 1314 (11th Cir. 2007), vacated, No. 05-16734 (11th Cir. Feb. 1,\n2008) (recognizing “the privacy interests of the AL and CR Group Plaintiffs are\nthe same, or arguably greater than, those of arrestees because they are entitled to\nrelease and the basis for their detention at the Jail no longer exists”); see also\nCannon v. Macon County, 1 F.3d 1558, 1563 (11th Cir. 1993).  These individuals\n51\n\nshould not have been subjected to any strip search, since their detention was no\nlonger authorized under any possible legal principle.  I also would note that today’s\ndecision should not be read as foreclosing future Fourth Amendment challenges in\ncases where a jail’s search policy is more intrusive without a concomitant increase\nin the justification for the intrusion.\n52",

After a review of the\nrecord, the Court issues the following Order.\nAs an initial matter, Plaintiffs did not file any opposition to Defendant’s\nStatement of Material Facts [269-2], therefore their Motion for Leave to File a\nRevised Opposition [284] is DENIED.\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 2 of 20\nBackground\nPlaintiffs assert claims against Defendant Jacqueline Barrett in her\nindividual capacity for alleged strip searches and over-detentions that occurred\nat the Fulton County Jail between December 2003 and May 2004, during the\nperiod when Defendant was sheriff of the Jail.  According to the Fourth\nAmended Complaint, the Jail had no effective inmate management system\nwhich caused inmates to be detained after they had been ordered release.\n(Fourth Am. Comp., Dkt. [78] at ¶¶ 206, 208).  Plaintiffs assert that this policy\nof over-detention was a violation of their constitutional rights. (Id. at ¶ 395).\nThe named Plaintiffs in this case also claim that they were subjected to\nillegal strip searches upon entering or re-entering the general population at the\nFulton County Jail. (Id. at ¶¶ 12, 14). The eleven named plaintiffs can be\ndivided into three groups with regard to their strip search claims. The first\ngroup, the Arrestee Strip Search Class (AR), consists of inmates who were strip\nsearched as part of the point-of-entry booking process before they were placed\ninto the general jail population for the first time. (Id. at ¶ 180). The second\ngroup, the Alpha Strip Search Class (AL), were subjected to the booking\nprocess, including the booking strip searches, after posting bond or having been\n2\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 3 of 20\nordered released at their first appearances. (Id. at ¶¶ 187, 188). The third group,\nthe Court Return Strip Search Class (CR), includes inmates who were ordered\nreleased by a judge in state court and returned to the Jail where they were\nsubjected to blanket strip searches. (Id. at ¶¶ 204, 205). \nIn an en banc decision, the Eleventh Circuit held that the strip searches of\nthe AR class did not violate Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment rights. Powell v.\nBarrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2008). The court then remanded the\ncase back to this court to apply the principles discussed in the opinion to the AL\nand CR classes. Powell v. Barrett, 307 Fed. Appx. 434, 436 (11th Cir. 2009).\nDiscussion\nI.  Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment [269] and Plaintiffs’\nRule 56(d) Motion [282]\nA.  Background\nDefendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment as to Qualified\nImmunity [269]. In response, Plaintiffs have made a Rule 56(d) Motion alleging\nthat they are unable to present facts essential to justify their opposition to\nDefendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment. (Plaintiffs’ Rule 56(d) Motion to\nDeny Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. [282] at p. 2). Plaintiffs\nfiled their Rule 56(d) Motion on December 8, 2010 styled as a Rule 56(f)\n3\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 4 of 20\nMotion. Under the amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which\nbecame effective on December 1, 2010, the grounds Plaintiffs assert for\nopposing Defendant’s Summary Judgment Motion are now contained in Rule\n56(d), not Rule 56(f). Therefore, this Court will consider the Plaintiffs’ Motion\nas a Rule 56(d) Motion.\nB.  Rule 56(d) Standard\nDistrict Courts have the discretion to postpone ruling on a party’s motion\nfor summary judgment if the nonmovant needs additional discovery to explore\n“facts essential to justify its opposition.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(d).  Rule 56(d)\nprovides that a court may allow time for additional discovery “if a nonmovant\nshows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present\nfacts essential to justify its opposition” to the moving party’s motion for\nsummary judgment. Id.\nPlaintiffs assert that they are unable to respond to Defendant’s Motion for\nSummary Judgment. In his affidavit, William Claiborne, Plaintiffs’ counsel,\ncontends that Plaintiffs “cannot justify their opposition to defendant’s summary\njudgment motion . . . because plaintiffs have not had discovery on the claims\nfrom defendant and the summary judgment motion exceeds the scope of the\n4\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 5 of 20\nCourt of Appeals remand motion.” (Aff. of William Claiborne, Dkt. [282-2] at\np. 2).\n In its July 14, 2009 Order, the Court ruled that “discovery should be\nnarrowly limited until the threshold constitutional issues can be decided.” (Dkt.\n[199] at 2). As a result, discovery was restricted to information regarding only\nthe length of the named plaintiffs’ detentions and the circumstances of each\nplaintiff’s release from the Fulton County Jail. (Id. at pp. 2, 4).  Plaintiffs\ncontend that in order to properly respond  to Defendant’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment on the issue of qualified immunity, information regarding the releases\nof a broader class of inmates is necessary.\nC.  Standard for Qualified Immunity\nUnder the doctrine of qualified immunity, government officials\nperforming discretionary functions may not be held individually liable for civil\ndamages unless their conduct violates “clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Lassiter\nv. Alabama, 28 F.3d 1146, 1149 (11th Cir.1994)(en banc) (quoting Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)) The\ncourt may ascertain whether this standard has been met by making two\n5\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 6 of 20\ndeterminations: (1) whether the defendant committed a violation of the\nplaintiff’s constitutional rights, and (2) whether the violation was governed by\nclearly established law. See West v. Tillman, 496 F.3d 1321, 1327 (11th Cir.\n2007) (citing Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d\n272 (2001))1. In addition, where the plaintiff seeks to hold the defendant liable\nfor acts not taken by the defendant personally but by staff under the defendant’s\nsupervision, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with deliberate\nindifference to the plaintiff’s constitutional rights. Id. \nD.  Over-Detention Claims\nThe Eleventh Circuit in West v. Tillman explained that the deliberate\nindifference standard is “a difficult burden for the plaintiff to meet.” Id.  In\norder to prove deliberate indifference, plaintiffs in over-detention cases must\nestablish a history of widespread abuse sufficient to put the supervisor on notice\nof the need to correct the alleged deprivation. Id. at 1328-29.\nAlthough the Court initially limited discovery to information regarding\nonly the named plaintiffs’ over-detentions, under the requirements of West,\n1After the decision in West v. Tillman, the Supreme Court held that while the two\n-step sequence for resolving government officials’ qualified immunity claims established\nin Saucier is appropriate, it should no longer be regarded as mandatory in all cases. See\nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, 818, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009).\n6\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 7 of 20\nPlaintiffs do not have sufficient information to  respond to the deliberate\nindifference prong of Defendant’s argument for qualified immunity.  Additional\ndiscovery is necessary to enable Plaintiffs to demonstrate “a history of\nwidespread abuse” that was sufficient to put Sheriff Barrett on notice of the\nproblem with over-detentions at the Fulton County Jail and the need to correct\nthat problem.\nDefendant objects to the Rule 56(d) motion on the grounds that Plaintiffs\nfailed to explain how additional discovery would preclude the entry of summary\njudgment. (Def.’s Response in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Rule 56(d) Motion,\nDkt. [285] at pp. 12-15). However, Plaintiffs have explained that additional\ndiscovery will enable them to demonstrate a history of widespread abuse at the\nFulton County Jail. (Aff. of William Claiborne, Dkt. [282-2] at pp. 6-7). This\nshowing is necessary for Plaintiffs to rebut Defendant’s qualified immunity\ndefense and therefore necessary to respond to Defendant’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment. Id. Defendant also contends that Plaintiffs failed to make use of the\navailable discovery because they only served three interrogatories. (Def.’s\nResponse in Opposition to Plaintiff’s Rule 56(d) Motion, Dkt. [285] at pp. 15-\n16). However, based on the limited discovery allowed by the Court, Plaintiffs\n7\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 8 of 20\ndid not have access to the information necessary to rebut the defense of\nqualified immunity.\nThe Court will allow Plaintiffs additional discovery on any computerized\ninmate population accounting system used to track inmates in the Fulton\nCounty Jail and a manual examination of a statistically valid sample of\ninstitutional folders to obtain information on the extent of the over-detention\nproblem during the relevant period. Defendants will have seven days from the\ndate of this Order to file any objections to this expanded scope of discovery.\nPlaintiffs will then have seven days from the date of Defendant’s objections to\nreply. After considering the objections and the reply and determining the proper\nscope of additional discovery, the Court will seek a proposed Scheduling Order\nfrom the parties pertaining to any additional discovery. Plaintiffs’ Rule 56(d)\nMotion is GRANTED.\nGiven that the Court granted the Rule 56(d) Motion,  Defendant’s Motion\nfor Summary Judgment as to Qualified Immunity [269] as to the over-detention\nclass is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE, and with the right to re-file after\nthe completion of the additional discovery.\n8\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 9 of 20\nD.  Alpha Class\nThe AL class  is comprised of inmates held in the intake area prior to\ntheir first appearances in the Fulton County Jail, ordered released or granted\nbond at the first appearance, and then placed into the general population and\nsubjected to group, blanket strip searches prior to actual release. (Pl.’s Memo,\nDkt. [282-1] at pp. 23-24).  The AL class was placed in the general jail\npopulation while staff in the Records Room, as part of the release process,\nsearched for other detention orders, warrants, and holds. Powell v. Barrett, 496\nF.3d 1288, 1313 (11th Cir. 2007), rev’d en banc, 541 F.3d 1298 (2008).\nBecause the AL class was subjected to strip searches prior to entering the\ngeneral population, the inmates’ Fourth Amendment rights were not violated\nunder the standard established in the Eleventh Circuit’s en banc decision in this\ncase. Powell, 541 F.3d at 1302 (holding that strip searches of all arrestees as\npart of the booking process prior to entering the general population, even\nwithout reasonable suspicion, is constitutionally permissible). Therefore Sheriff\nBarrett is entitled to qualified immunity as to the strip search claims of the\nAlpha Class.\n9\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 10 of 20\nThe Eleventh Circuit in this case held that the Fulton County Jail’s policy\nof strip searching inmates entering the general population was justifiable and\ndid not violate the inmates’ constitutional rights. Powell, 541 F.3d at 1302.  The\ncourt stated that the reasonableness of a search “requires a balancing of the need\nfor the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search\nentails.” Id. at 1305 (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S. Ct.\n1861, 1884, 60 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1979)). In balancing those interests, courts must\nconsider four factors: (1) the scope of the particular intrusion; (2) the manner in\nwhich it was conducted; (3) the justification for initiating it; and (4) the place in\nwhich it is conducted. Id.\nThe  Eleventh Circuit, in considering the Bell factors, noted that “the\ncombined weight of the third and fourth factors” supported the finding that the\nstrip search policy as applied to the AR class did not violate the Fourth\nAmendment. Id. at 1306. The Eleventh Circuit held that these two factors\nmerged into one “heavy consideration because the searches took place in a\ndetention facility and the justification for them was the critically important\nsecurity needs of the facility.” Id.  According to the Court, “a detention facility\nis a unique place fraught with serious security concerns.” Id. (quoting Bell, 441\n10\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 11 of 20\nU.S. at 559).  “Employees . . . and . . . the detained inmates themselves face a\nreal threat of violence, and administrators must be concerned on a daily basis\nwith the smuggling of contraband by inmates accused of misdemeanors as well\nas those accused of felonies.” Id. at 1310. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that\nthese safety concerns justified the strip searches of the AR class before entering\nthe general population of  the Fulton County Jail. Id. at 1302. \nThese same safety concerns support the finding that the strip searches of\nthe AL class did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The late booking process\nwas the first time the AL class was subject to strip searches because the class\nwas not strip searched prior to attending their first appearances. As such, the AL\nclass, like the AR class, was strip searched prior to entering the general\npopulation after having contact with individuals outside of the Fulton County\nJail.  \n The Jail has significant and legitimate security interests supporting the\nrequirement that all inmates entering and re-entering the general population be\nstrip searched. The searches of the AL class occurred after the inmates had been\noutside the jail and presented an increased security hazard. Therefore, a search \n11\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 12 of 20\nof the body was necessary to ensure that no contraband was introduced into the\ngeneral population. \nPlaintiffs assert that if the AL class presented a security risk, the Fulton\nCounty Jail should have released them instead of placing them into the general\npopulation. (Pl.’s Memo, Dkt. [282-1] at p. 29).  While Plaintiffs’ claim that the\nAL class had a constitutional right to be released instead of placed into the\ngeneral population has merit, this contention goes to the over-detention claims\nand has no bearing on the constitutional validity of strip searching the AL class.\nUnder the reasoning of Powell, the Fulton County Jail has strong security\ninterests justifying searches of inmates prior to entering the general population.\nIn the case of the AL class, the strip searches were performed before the\ninmates entered the jail population and after they had contact with individuals\noutside of the jail facility. As a result, the Jail’s policy did not violate a clearly\nestablished constitutional right of the AL class. Defendant’s Motion for\nSummary Judgment as to Qualified Immunity [269] as to the AL Class is\nGRANTED.\nUnlike the over-detention class, Plaintiffs do not need additional\ninformation to respond to Defendant’s claim of qualified immunity. The\n12\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 13 of 20\nEleventh Circuit’s decision in this case demonstrates that the strip searches of\nthe AL class did not violate any clearly established constitutional rights.  There\nis no need for additional discovery as to this claim. As a result, Plaintiff’s Rule\n56(d) Motion [282] is DENIED as to the AL class.\nE.  Court Return Class\nThe CR class is comprised of in-custody defendants who went to court\nfor court hearings, became entitled to release at the hearings, and were\nsubjected to blanket strip searches upon their return to the Fulton County Jail.\n(Pl.’s Memo, Dkt. [282-1] at p. 31). The CR class was under constant\nsupervision while in transit to and from the Jail and while at the courthouse.\n(Fourth Am. Comp., Dkt. [78] at ¶ 193). Unlike the AL class, the CR class had\nalready been subjected to strip searches upon their initial entry into the Fulton\nCounty Jail. After returning from court, they were subjected to another strip\nsearch before being placed back into the general population.\nThe same security concerns that justified the searches of the AR and the\nAL classes support the strip searches of the CR class. The inmates were\nsubjected to the searches after having contact with individuals outside the Jail\npopulation. There was a risk that the CR class could acquire contraband during\n13\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 14 of 20\ntheir transfers between the Jail and the courthouse, and introduce it into the\ngeneral population. As a result, the strip searches before re-entering the general\npopulation are justified under the Eleventh Circuit’s en banc decision. Powell,\n541 F.3d at 1302.\nThe Jail’s security interests were not eliminated simply because the CR\nclass was under constant supervision during the transfers to and from the\ncourthouse.  In Bell, the Supreme Court upheld the searches of inmates re-\nentering the general population after having contact visits with individuals from\noutside the facility, even defense attorneys. Bell, 441 U.S. at 560. These contact\nvisits occurred in glass-enclosed rooms and were continuously monitored by\ncorrections officers. Id. at 577 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Despite the constant\nmonitoring of the inmates, the Supreme Court held that the security risks\nassociated with the smuggling of contraband justified searching the inmates\nafter these visits. Id. at 559. The CR class, like the plaintiffs in Bell, were\nsubject to constant monitoring during their time outside of the jail. Despite this\nmonitoring, the same risk of acquiring contraband that supported the search in\nBell exists in this case. \n14\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 15 of 20\nPlaintiffs assert that “every court that has addressed strip searching court\nreturns after a judge has ordered them released has condemned the practice, and\nruled returning court returns to a county jail to process them out or to check for\ndetainers is an administrative interest that does not justify strip searching them.”\n(Pl.’s Memo, Dkt. [282-1] at p. 36). Therefore, according to Plaintiffs, the strip\nsearches are not justified under the four factors identified by Bell because they\nserve the administrative convenience interests of the Sheriff, and not the\nlegitimate security interests of the Fulton County Jail. Id. While Plaintiffs’\nclaim that the CR class had a constitutional right to be kept out of the general\npopulation after posting bond or having charges dismissed may have merit, it\ndoes not impact the constitutionality of the strip searches. Moreover, despite\nPlaintiffs’ contention, the strip searches were not searches to process inmates\nout of the Jail. Id. Instead, they were searches conducted before the CR class re-\nentered the general population. The Eleventh Circuit acknowledged the\nnumerous security risks posed by inmates re-entering the general population.\nPowell, 514 F.3d at 1310-12. As a result, the strip searches served more than\n“administrative interests,”and instead served the security interests of the Jail.\nBecause the policy of strip searching the CR class did not violate a clearly\n15\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 16 of 20\nestablished constitutional right, Sheriff Barrett is entitled to qualified immunity.\nTherefore, Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to Qualified\nImmunity [269] as to the CR Class is GRANTED.\nMoreover, Plaintiffs’ do not need additional discovery to rebut\nDefendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to the CR class. Thus, Plaintiff’s\nRule 56(d) Motion [282] is DENIED as to the CR class.\nII.  Motion to Exclude Testimony [259]\nDefendant seeks to preclude Plaintiffs from offering any and all opinion \ntestimony of Plaintiffs’ expert witness, David Goldstein, relating to the\ninterpretation of inmate records on the grounds that Plaintiffs failed to satisfy\nthe requirements of Local Rule 26.2 (c) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B). (Def.’s\nBr., Dkt. [259-1] at pp. 1,5,6).\nDespite Plaintiffs’ contention that Mr. Goldstein is a fact witness, the\nCourt concludes that the testimony of Mr. Goldstein proffered by Plaintiffs is\nappropriately considered expert testimony under Fed. R. Evid. 702. Because\nMr. Goldstein will offer expert testimony, Plaintiffs are subject to the disclosure\nrequirements of Local Rule 26.2(c) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 26.  \n16\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 17 of 20\nA witness with specialized knowledge can testify as a fact witness if the\ntestimony is “rationally based on the witnesses own perceptions.” United States\nv. Rivera, 22 F.3d 430, 434 (2d. Cir. 1994)(quoting FED. R. EVID. 701(a)). \nWitnesses with specialized knowledge and training may be pure fact witnesses\nwhen they directly participate in the events at issue in a particular case. Morgan\nv. U.S. Xpress, Inc., 2006 WL 278398, at *2 (M.D. Ga. Feb. 3, 2006) (citing\nGomez v. Rivera Rodriguez, 344 F.3d 103,113 (1st Cir. 2003)). Moreover,\nowners and employees of a particular business may testify as fact witnesses\nbecause of their particularized knowledge gained by virtue of their position in\nthe business. See Tampa Bay Shipbuilding & Repair Co. v. Cedar Shipping Co.,\n320 F.3d 1213, 1222 (11th Cir. 2003). On the other hand, if the testimony\nconsists of “opinions based on scientific, technical, or other specialized\nknowledge,” the witness is not a fact witness, but instead an expert witness\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 702. Morgan, 2006 WL 278398, at *3 (quoting FED. R.\nEVID. 702).\nMr. Goldstein’s testimony will be expert testimony as opposed to lay\nopinion testimony. Mr. Goldstein has no affiliation with the Fulton County\nSheriff’s Office. Moreover, he has never worked in the Fulton County Jail, was\n17\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 18 of 20\nnot a sheriff’s deputy or employee, and did not represent any of the Plaintiffs in\nconnection with the charges leading to the subject incarcerations. As a result,\nMr. Goldstein’s testimony is not based on his own perceptions of the events at\nthe Fulton County Jail nor is his testimony based on specialized knowledge\nacquired by virtue of his position at the Jail. Instead,  Mr. Goldstein’s\ninterpretation of inmate records is appropriately considered expert testimony\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 702 because it is based on the specialized general\nknowledge he acquired working as a public defender.\nBecause the Court finds that Mr. Goldstein is an expert, Plaintiffs failed\nto make the appropriate disclosures required by Local Rule 26.2 and Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 26. Under Local Rule 26.2, a party “who desires to use the testimony of\nan expert witness shall designate the expert sufficiently early in the discovery\nperiod to permit the opposing party the opportunity to depose the expert.” Local\nRule 26.2(c), N.D. Ga. Plaintiffs failed to disclose Mr. Goldstein as an expert\nduring the discovery period. The discovery period for the current post-remand\nphase of the litigation expired on December 18, 2009, and the deadline for\nsupplemental discovery was June 14, 2010. Plaintiffs did not advise Defendant\nthat they had retained an expert until August 2, 2010, well after the close of the\n18\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 19 of 20\nsupplemental discovery period. Additionally, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B),\nthe disclosure of an expert witness must be accompanied by an expert report.\nHere, Plaintiffs failed to include an expert report when they disclosed Mr.\nGoldstein on August 2, 2010.\nAlthough the Court finds that Mr. Goldstein is an expert and that\nPlaintiffs failed to make the required disclosures, the Court will not exclude his\ntestimony at this juncture. Instead, given the extension of the discovery period \nto enable Plaintiffs to gather evidence of deliberate indifference, the Court will\nallow Plaintiffs the opportunity to make the required disclosures under Local\nRules 26.2 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B).  The expert report should be served\nupon Defendant within seven days from the date of this Order. Plaintiffs should\nmake Mr. Goldstein available to Defendant for deposition. Defendant will have\nfourteen days from the filing of the expert report to depose Mr. Goldstein and\nseven days from the date of the deposition to offer any counter-experts.\nPlaintiffs will then have fourteen days from that time to depose the Defendant’s\ncounter-experts. The parties will then have an opportunity to file any motions to\nexclude the testimony of either expert in accordance with the Local Rules of \n19\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 290   Filed 03/03/11   Page 20 of 20\nthis Court. Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Exclude Testimony [259] is\nDENIED.\nConclusion\nFor the aforementioned reasons, Defendant’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment [269] is GRANTED as to the AL and CR Classes, and DENIED\nwithout prejudice as to the Over-Detention Class.  Plaintiffs’ Rule 56(d)\nMotion [282] is GRANTED as to the Over-Detention Class, and DENIED as\nto the AL and CR Classes.  Defendant’s Motion to Exclude Testimony [259] is\nDENIED, and Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to File a Revised Opposition [284]\nis DENIED. \nSO ORDERED this   3rd    day of March, 2011.\n________________________________\nRICHARD W.

BARRETT, :\n:\nDefendant. :\n:\nORDER\nThis case comes before the Court on Defendant’s Motion for Summary\nJudgment [269], Plaintiffs’ Motion to Motion to [sic] Exclude Purported Expert\nOpinion Evidence of Mr. Lane [314], and Defendant’s Motion for Oral\nArgument [316].  After reviewing the Record, the Court enters the following\nOrder.\nAs a preliminary matter, the Court finds that oral argument will not aid\nthe Court in resolving Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment. \nAccordingly, the Court hereby DENIES Defendant’s Motion for Oral\nArgument [316]. \nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 2 of 15\nBackground\nPlaintiffs, certain former detainees at the Fulton County Jail (the “Jail”),\ninitiated this putative class action on April 21, 2004, raising claims against\nDefendant Jacqueline Barrett in her individual capacity arising out of alleged\nstrip searches and over-detentions to which Plaintiffs were subjected between\nDecember of 2003 and May of 2004, during which time Defendant was Sheriff\nof the Jail.  With respect to the strip search claims, the named Plaintiffs could\nbe classified into three separate groups: first, the Arrestee Strip Search Class\n(“AR Class”), which consisted of inmates who were strip searched as part of the\npoint-of-entry booking process before being placed, for the first time, into the\ngeneral Jail population; second the Alpha Strip Search Class (“AL Class”),\nwhich consisted of inmates who were granted bond or ordered to be released at\ntheir first appearances, but subjected to another strip search and placed back\ninto the general population prior to actual release; and, finally, the Court Return\nClass (“CR Class”), which consisted of inmates who went to court for hearings\nand were ordered to be released, but who were subjected to another strip search\nand placed back into the general population prior to being released.  (Order,\nDkt. No. [290] at 2, 9, 13.)\n2\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 3 of 15\nIn an en banc decision, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that\nthe strip searches of the AR Class did not violate those Plaintiffs’ constitutional\nrights.  Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2008).  The court then\nremanded the case back to this Court to apply the principles discussed in the\nopinion to the claims of the AL and CR classes.  Powell v. Barrett, 307 F.\nApp’x 434, 436 (11th Cir. 2009).  On remand, the Court held, by Order dated\nMarch 3, 2011, that under the principles articulated by the Eleventh Circuit, the\nstrip searches of the AL and CR classes did not violate those Plaintiffs’\nconstitutional rights; accordingly, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion for\nSummary Judgment [269] on grounds of qualified immunity as to the remaining\nstrip search claims.  (Order, Dkt. No. [290] at 13, 16.)\nIn the same Order, however, the Court denied without prejudice\nDefendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment [269] on grounds of qualified\nimmunity as to Plaintiffs’ over-detention claims, granting instead Plaintiffs’\nRule 56(d) Motion [282] for further discovery.  (Id. at 8-9.)  Specifically, the\nCourt granted Plaintiffs’ request for additional discovery to demonstrate a\n“history of widespread abuse” of inmates’ constitutional rights at the Jail (i.e., a\nhistory of over-detentions), which the Court found was necessary to enable\nPlaintiffs to rebut the defense of qualified immunity.  (Id. at 7-8.)\n3\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 4 of 15\n  By Order dated August 8, 2011, however, the Court vacated its March 3,\n2011 Order [290] to the extent it granted Plaintiffs’ Rule 56(d) Motion.  (Dkt.\nNo. [300] at 6.)  The Court found that contrary to the findings of its initial\nOrder, additional discovery was not needed to demonstrate a problem with\nover-detentions at the Jail given that Defendant admitted that such a problem\nexisted.  (Id. at 2-3.)  In light of this admission, Defendant argued that her\nqualified immunity defense would revolve around the issue of whether she was\ndeliberately indifferent to the problem.  (Id. at 5-6.)  Finding that Plaintiffs had\nhad a sufficient opportunity to discover information related to this issue, the\nCourt reconsidered and denied Plaintiffs’ Rule 56(d) Motion for further\ndiscovery.  (Id.)\nIn light of this ruling, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to respond to\nDefendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment [269] on the over-detention\nclaims–the only claims that currently remain in this case.

R. CIV. P.\n56(a).  “The moving party bears ‘the initial responsibility of informing the . . .\ncourt of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings,\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\naffidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue\nof material fact.’”  Hickson Corp. v. N. Crossarm Co., 357 F.3d 1256, 1259\n(11th Cir. 2004) (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986)\n(internal quotations omitted)).  Where the moving party makes such a showing,\nthe burden shifts to the non-movant, who must go beyond the pleadings and\npresent affirmative evidence to show that a genuine issue of material fact does\nexist.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 257  (1986). \nThe applicable substantive law identifies which facts are material.  Id. at\n248.  A fact is not material if a dispute over that fact will not affect the outcome\nof the suit under the governing law.  Id.  An issue is genuine when the evidence\nis such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party. \nId. at 249-50. \nIn resolving a motion for summary judgment, the court must view all\nevidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\n5\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 6 of 15\nnon-moving party.  Patton v. Triad Guar. Ins. Corp., 277 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th\nCir. 2002).  But, the court is bound only to draw those inferences which are\nreasonable.  “Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier\nof fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.” \nAllen v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 121 F.3d 642, 646 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting\nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)). \n“If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary\njudgment may be granted.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50 (internal citations\nomitted); see also Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586 (once the moving party has met\nits burden under Rule 56(a), the nonmoving party “must do more than simply\nshow there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts”).\nB. Qualified Immunity\nAs stated above, Defendant moves for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’\nover-detention claims on grounds of qualified immunity.  The doctrine of\nqualified immunity protects government officials performing discretionary\nfunctions from being sued in their individual capacities.  Wilson v. Layne, 526\nU.S. 603, 609 (1999).  Officials are shielded “insofar as their conduct does not\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\nreasonable person would have known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,\n6\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 7 of 15\n818 (1982).  The qualified immunity analysis thus is governed by a two-step\nframework.  One inquiry in the analysis is “whether the plaintiff’s allegations, if\ntrue, establish a constitutional violation.”  Barnett v. City of Florence, 409 F.\nApp’x 266, 270 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 736\n(2002)).  “If the facts, construed . . . in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\nshow that a constitutional right has been violated, another inquiry is whether the\nright violated was ‘clearly established.’”  Id. (citing Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.\n194, 201 (2001)).  “Both elements of this test must be present for an official to\nlose qualified immunity, and this two-pronged analysis may be done in\nwhatever order is deemed most appropriate for the case.”  Id. (citing Pearson v.\nCallahan, 555 U.S. 223, 241 (2009)).  Finally, the qualified immunity analysis\n“is a pure question of law” at the summary judgment stage once the court has\n“drawn all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party to the extent supportable\nby the record.”  Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 381 n.8 (2007). \nThe Court first undertakes the inquiry of whether Plaintiffs have shown a\nconstitutional violation on the part of Defendant.  If the Court finds a sufficient\nshowing of a constitutional violation, it then must consider whether the\nviolation was of a clearly established right.  If, however, no violation has been\nestablished, the inquiry ends and the Court must find Defendant entitled to\n7\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 8 of 15\nqualified immunity.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause, a\ndetainee has a “constitutional right to be free from continued detention after it\nwas or should have been known that [he] was entitled to release.”  Cannon v.\nMacon Cnty., 1 F.3d 1558, 1563 (11th Cir. 1993).  To establish a violation of\nthis right, “Plaintiffs must show that Defendant[ ] acted with deliberate\nindifference to Plaintiffs’ due process rights.”  West v. Tillman, 496 F.3d 1321,\n1327 (11th Cir. 2007).  \nIn this case, Plaintiffs seek to hold Defendant liable in her supervisory\ncapacity for the alleged over-detentions that occurred at the Jail.  In this regard,\n“‘[i]t is well established in this Circuit that supervisory officials are not liable\nunder § 1983 for the unconstitutional acts of their subordinates on the basis of\nrespondeat superior or vicarious liability.’”  Id. at 1328 (citing Cottone v. Jenne,\n326 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir. 2003)).  On the contrary, “supervisory liability\noccurs either when the supervisor personally participates in the alleged\nunconstitutional conduct or when there is a causal connection between the\nactions of a supervising official and the alleged constitutional violation.” \nCottone, 326 F.3d at 1360.  The requisite causal connection can be established\nby showing, among other things, “a history of widespread abuse [which] puts\nthe responsible supervisor on notice of the need to correct the alleged\n8\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 9 of 15\ndeprivation, and he fails to do so.”  Id.  The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals\nhas held that the standard for supervisory liability is “extremely rigorous.”  Id.\nat 1360.\nPlaintiffs seek to establish deliberate indifference on the part of\nDefendant to Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights by showing that Defendant was on\nnotice of the over-detentions and yet failed to take action to stop them. \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant “engaged in a pattern of continued\ninaction in the face of employees’ documented widespread abuse of [Plaintiffs’\nconstitutional rights] by failing to ensure their release on their Release Dates.” \n(Am. Compl., Dkt. No. [78] ¶ 517.)  In support of her Motion for Summary\nJudgment, Defendant does not deny the problem of over-detentions; on the\ncontrary, she admits that such a problem existed but argues that she “vigorously\naddressed [it] with a wide variety of actions” and thus was “anything but\ndeliberately indifferent” to it.  (Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. No [269] at 19-\n20.)  \nThe parties agree that one of the causes of the over-detentions was a\nshortage of Jail staff during the relevant time period combined with a sharp\nincrease in the average daily population at the Jail. (Def.’s Statement of\nUndisputed Material Facts (“Def.’s SOF”), Dkt. No. [269-2] ¶ 37.)   In 2003,\n9\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 10 of 15\nthe City of Atlanta decided to send all Atlanta Police Department arrestees\ncharged with state offenses to the Jail rather than city detention facilities, which\nresulted in a twenty-nine percent increase in the average daily Jail population. \n(Id. ¶¶ 32-33.)  Approximately fifty to sixty new inmates were received at the\nJail each day, with even higher numbers on Friday and Saturday.  (Id. ¶ 35.) \nDespite this influx of inmates, the number of Jail staff did not increase, causing\nthe Jail to experience significant staff shortages.  (Id. ¶¶ 34. 36.) \nIn addition to staff shortages and an increasing Jail population, Defendant\ncites other reasons for the over-detentions.  Defendant contends that\nunavoidable delays in obtaining paperwork from the courts further delayed the\nrelease of inmates, as did the fact that court documents were not in a standard\nformat and were often difficult for Jail staff to read and understand.  (Id. ¶¶ 38,\n41-44.)  Finally, Defendant contends that Jail staff had to consult different\ncomputer systems for the sheriff, courts, and district attorney before an inmate\ncould be cleared for release, which further contributed to the delays.  (Id. ¶ 39.) \nWhile Plaintiffs generally “deny” that these additional factors contributed to\ndelay, they put forward no evidence to refute them.  (Pls.’ Combined Opp. to\nDef.’s SOF and Pls.’ Statement of Facts (“Pls.’ SOF”), Dkt. No. [307-1] ¶¶ 38,\n39, 41-44.)\n10\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 11 of 15\nIn support of her argument that she was not deliberately indifferent to the\nproblem of over-detentions, Defendant alleges that she took the following\nactions: “(1) request[ed] funding for additional staff; (2) [took] steps to increase\nthe efficiency of existing staff; (3) work[ed] to improve the transfer of\ninformation from the courts to the Jail, so that releases could be processed more\nefficiently; and (4) hir[ed] a new Chief Jailor to study and improve Jail\nprocesses, particularly including the release process.”  (Def.’s Mot. for Summ.\nJ., Dkt. No. [269-1] at 20.)  With specific regard to staff shortages and staff\nefficiency, Defendant did the following: First, she attempted to reduce staff\nshortages by suggesting to the County that certain Jail staff positions be made\ncivilian rather than sworn, so that Defendant could hire more employees for less\nmoney.  (Barrett Dep., Dkt. No. [269-6] at 99-100.)  Additionally, Defendant\nreassigned staff from other parts of the Jail or from outside the building to help\nwith the book-out process.  (See id. at 99, lines 11-19  (“[During] peak periods I\nreassigned staff from inside of the building or even outside the building to come\nin and to help with the book-out process.  There was a point at which I required\nall of the senior staff, I don’t care what bureau they worked in, courts, warrant,\nall of us worked at the jail for at least a shift so that we could give some relief to\nothers inside the building so that we could redirect staff perhaps down to the\n11\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 12 of 15\nbook-out process.”).)  At one point, Defendant also required Jail staff to log on\na board the names of inmates who were waiting to be released with the goal of\nclearing those names off the board.  (Id. at 100, lines 9-13.)\nDefendant also obtained a new filing system for the Jail records room in\nan effort to speed up the book-out process.  (Id. at 111-12, lines 25-3.)  (The\nCourt notes, however, that this “new filing system” appears to refer only to\nfiling cabinets, which Defendant provided to take the place of milk crates.) \nWith regard to communicating with the courts, Defendant met with the Chief\nJudge of the Superior Court and members of the District Attorney’s office to\nmake sure that the Jail received records from the courts as expeditiously as\npossible.  (Id. at 104, lines 15-18.)  She also sent a memo to the Fulton County\njudges asking them to send orders regarding case dispositions to one central fax\nnumber.  (Id. at 134, lines 19-25.)   In addition, when the funds were available\nto pay employees overtime, Defendant authorized a staff member to be a liaison\nwith the Court to ensure that Court documents issued late in the day were sent\nto the Jail.  (Id. at 139-140, lines 13-5.)\nFinally, in September of 2003, Defendant hired Roland Lane, Jr. to serve\nas Chief Jailor.  (Decl. of Roland Lane, Dkt. No. [269-7] ¶ 2.)  Defendant\ntasked him with improving jail processes in Fulton County, generally, and\n12\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 13 of 15\ncharged him with “making the intake and release processes more efficient and\neffective using available staff.”  (Id. ¶ 6.)  Lane made it a priority as Chief Jailor\nto speed up the release process through an initiative he termed “Operation\nBum’s Rush.”  (Id. ¶ 7.)\nTo refute a claim of deliberate indifference, a supervisory official must\nshow that she “did not fail to act correctively to address the problem.”  West,\n496 F.3d at 1330.  Thus, the Eleventh Circuit has held that a sheriff was not\ndeliberately indifferent to the problem of under-staffing at the jail, which led to\nsignificant over-detentions, where the sheriff took the following actions: “asked\nexisting staff to work overtime,” “temporarily brought in employees from other\ndepartments,” and “hired new employees . . . .”  Id.  In this case, Plaintiffs argue\nthat the aforementioned measures Defendant took were insufficient to address\nthe problem of over-detentions and at times led to perverse results (i.e., longer\ndelays).  (See generally Pls.’ Opp’n, Dkt. No. [307].)  However, the question\nthe Court must answer is not whether Defendant approached the problem in the\nbest way or achieved the best results, but whether she was “deliberately\nindifferent”–that is, whether she failed to take corrective action.  As stated\nabove, this is an “extremely rigorous” standard to meet.  “Human error does not\nequal deliberate indifference.”  West, 496 F.3d at 1327.  Deliberate indifference\n13\nAO 72A\n(Rev.8/82)\n\nCase 1:04-cv-01100-RWS   Document 319   Filed 02/17/12   Page 14 of 15\nclearly contemplate culpable conduct greater than negligence.  Id.  In spite of\nthe evidence of negligence on the part of Defendant, under the rationale of\nWest, the Court cannot conclude, based on the conduct set forth above, that\nDefendant acted with deliberate indifference to the problem of over-detentions\nat the Jail.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the\nstandard for supervisory liability.  \nHaving found no constitutional violation on the part of Defendant, the\nCourt need not undertake the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis. \n(See, e.g., Cottone, 326 F.3d at 1362 (“Because [Plaintiffs have not established]\na constitutional violation committed by the supervisory defendant[], we need\nnot reach the ‘clearly established law’ prong of the qualified immunity inquiry\nwith respect to supervisory liability. . . .).)  The Court concludes that Defendant\nis entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs’ over-detention claims and hereby\nGRANTS Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment [269].\nII.

Defendant Jacqueline Barrett was the Sheriff of Fulton County until \nDecember 31, 2004.  She was previously sued in her official capacity for \nprospective injunctive relief.  She is sued currently in in her individual capacity, \nfor money damages.  She was suspended for a period of 60days effective July 24, \n  18 \n\n2004.  A receiver had authority over the Fulton County Jail from July 26, 2004 \nuntil December 31, 2004. \n91.  Defendant Myron Freeman is currently the Sheriff of Fulton County.  He is \nsued in his official capacity for prospective injunctive relief, and in his official \ncapacity, and individual capacity, for money damages. \n92.  Because there were different Sheriffs responsible for the operation of the \nFulton County Jail at different times, certain allegations are made herein with \nreference to the “the Sheriff.” Such allegations refer to each Sheriff for the time \nperiod during which that person was Sheriff. \n93.  At all times described herein, Defendant Jacqueline Barrett, Myron Freeman \nand each of Karen Handel, Robb Pitts, Tom Lowe, Emma I. Darnell, Nancy A. \nBoxill, William \"Bill\" Edwards was acting under color of state law. \n94.  Defendant Fulton County is a body corporate, with power to sue or be sued \nin any court.  O.C.G.A. §36-1-3. \n95.  The Fulton County County Commissioners are Karen Handel, Robb Pitts, \nTom Lowe, Emma I. Darnell, Nancy A. Boxill, William \"Bill\" Edwards. Plaintiffs \nsue Karen Handel, Robb Pitts, Tom Lowe, Emma I. Darnell, Nancy A. Boxill, \nWilliam \"Bill\" Edwards in their individual as well as their individual capacities. \n96.  The City of Atlanta is a municipal corporation with power to sue or be sued \nin any court. \n  19 \n\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nFulton County, The Fulton County Board Of Commissioners, And The Fulton \nCounty Jail \n95. Defendant Fulton County is administered by the Fulton County Board of \nCommissioners (\"Board\") which consists of seven Commissioners elected by the \nvoters of Fulton County to four-year terms.  \n96.  The Board sets Fulton County governmental policy, and approves \ndepartmental budget requests.  \n97.  Fulton County and its “governing authority,” that is, the Board, have \nauthority to maintain and operate facilities for the detention, incarceration or \nconfinement of all persons subject to confinement under the laws of the state, any \ncounty resolution, or any city ordinance. \n98.  Starting in 1989-1990, Fulton County exercised its authority to build and \noperate an incarceration facility, and built the current Fulton County Jail on Rice \nStreet to replace the old jail. \n99.  The current Fulton County Jail on Rice Street came online in about 1990. \n  20 \n\n100.  The Fulton County Jail at Rice Street (“Fulton County Jail” or sometimes \nthe “Jail”) is the primary facility used by Fulton County to house inmates in Fulton \nCounty. \n101.  The Fulton County Jail has a capacity of approximately 1,450 inmates.  \nHowever, at its opening the County put double beds in the cells and so Fulton \nCounty Jail opened with about 2,250 inmates. \n102.  Currently, the jail houses about 2,900 inmates, with 400 others in two \nannexes.  \n103.  Most inmates at the Fulton County Jail are either pre-trial detainees, \nmisdemeanants serving misdemeanor sentences, or probation violators. \n104.  The Board has the power to designate the person(s) to control incarceration \nfacilities, including the Fulton County Jail. \n105.  The Board has designated the Sheriff of Fulton County as the person to \ncontrol the County’s incarceration facilities.   \n106.  The Board has designated the Sheriff of Fulton County as the person to \noperate and control the Fulton County Jail. \n107.  The Board, not the sheriff, has ultimate control over the Fulton County Jail. \n108.  Fulton County also sets the budget for the County’s incarceration facilities. \n109.  The Fulton County Board and its members, pursuant to requirements of \nGeorgia state law, “shall pass an annual budget provide an annual budget sufficient \n  21 \n\nfor the efficient and effective operation of the jail.” O.C.G.A. § 42-4-94(b). By \ndefinition, a budget sufficient for the “efficient and effective operation of the jail” \nmust be one that permits constitutional requirements for the jail to be met. \n110.  On December 14, 1992, defendant Jacquelyn Barrett took office as the \nSheriff of Fulton County, Georgia.  \n111.  The old jail had been the subject of a 1982 class-action lawsuit (Fambro \nv. Fulton, 82-cv2136, JOF) challenging conditions at that facility including \novercrowding and overdetentions. \n112.  In a published opinion in the Fambro case this Court stated that the Fulton \nCounty criminal justice system not capable of functioning at an attainable rate. The \n1982 class-action lawsuit continued to cover the Rice Street Jail until the suit was \nsettled by the Fulton County Commission in 1994, and dismissed by this Court. \n113.  In April 2002, The Honorable Marvin Shoob of this Court issued a \npublished opinion in Foster v. Fulton County, which sought to address systemic \nproblems that lead to unnecessary incarceration and chronic jail overcrowding, \nwhich in turn adversely affected living conditions at the jail, increased the risk of \nexposure to dangerous diseases, and interfered with the provision of adequate \nmedical care.  Foster v. Fulton County, 223 F. Supp. 2d 1292 (N.D. Ga. 2002). \n  22 \n\n114.  The opinion detailed the unconstitutional condition of the Fulton County \ncriminal Justice system and the overcrowding and overdetention problems at the \nFulton County Jail. \n115.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference herein the contents of the published \nopinions in Foster. \n116.  The Foster Court specifically ordered Fulton County and the Fulton County \nJail and the sheriff to implement an integrated computer system that links all of the \nappropriate agencies in the Fulton County criminal justice system, expand the \ncurrent discharge planning resources at the jail and evaluate obstacles to discharge \nplanning and take steps to remove these obstacles. \n117.  The opinion detailed the fact that the Fulton County Jail allowed \ncommitment of intakes to the Fulton County Jail without obtaining commitment \ndocuments needed to book intakes to the Fulton County Jail, and process their \nappearances in court in about twenty percent of intakes.  \nFulton County and The Board’s Control Over Jail Staff \n118.  The Sheriff appoints deputies and jailers (civilian, administrative employees \nwho do not have any police powers) to staff the Fulton County Jail subject to the \nsupervision of the Board.  \n  23 \n\n119.  The Records Room staff (people that work in the records room and process \nadmissions and releases) are classified, administrative employees.  \n120.  Records Room staff employees are not deputies. \n121.  Records Room staff are county employees. \n122.  Both deputies and jailers are classified employees under the constitutionally \nmandated Fulton County Civil Service System. \n123.  Classified employees are subject to the constitutionally mandated Fulton \nCounty Civil Service System. \n124.  The Fulton County Board administers the Fulton County Civil Service \nSystem through the Personnel Board.  \n125.  The Personnel Board is appointed by the Board of Commissioners and is the \nmajor decision-making authority within the Personnel Department.  \n126.  The Fulton County Civil Service Act severely curtails the Fulton County \nSheriff’s power to hire, discipline, and fire Jail staff.  \n127.  The classified employees at the Fulton County Jail are employees of the \ncounty subject to the supervision of the Board. \n128.  All county employees, including deputies and Records Room staff and other \nFulton County Jail staff, are part of a unified, constitutionally mandated civil \nservice system subject to the Board. \n  24 \n\n129.  County employees may freely transfer between various county departments \n(including the sheriff’s department) without losing seniority. \n130.  All county employees, including not only the sheriff’s staff, but the sheriff \nherself, are part of a unified, constitutionally mandated pension system.  \n131.   \nThe Sheriff’s Responsibilities For Inmates At The Fulton County Jail \n132.  The Sheriff’s duties include hiring, disciplining, and firing Jail staff subject \nto the supervision of the Board. \n133.  The Sheriff’s duties also include formulating, implementing, and executing \npolicies concerning the operation of the Fulton County Jail facilities subject to the \nauthority of the Board.  \n134.  These duties include promulgating policies controlling the strip searches of \ninmates, and regulations ensuring the release of inmates on their Release Dates.  \n135.  The Sheriff has day-to-day training, supervisory, and disciplinary authority \nfor all operations of the Fulton County Jail subject to the supervision of the Board. \n136.  The Sheriff is also responsible for ensuring that each employee of the Fulton \nCounty Jail discharges his or her duties in accordance with the law, court orders, \nand authority designated her by the Board. \n  25 \n\nCriminal Justice Cycle And The Fulton County Jail  \n137.  The steps in an inmate’s trip through the criminal justice cycle in Fulton \nCounty are: (1) arrest; (2) commitment to the Fulton County Jail as a new \ncommitment; (3) hearing at the Fulton County Jail in the case of felony arrests, or \nhearing at the courthouse in the case of misdemeanor arrests; (4) transport from the \nFulton County Jail to court for subsequent court dates; and (5) return to the Fulton \nCounty Jail. \n138.  A suspect is arrested in Fulton County by the Fulton County Police or other \ncounty agent, by the Sheriff, or by a municipal police force. \n139.  The Fulton County Police Department transports all arrestees directly to the \nFulton County Jail, and commits them to the Fulton County Jail. \n140.  The Fulton County Police Department is controlled and operated by, and is \nsubject to, the authority of the Board. \n141.  At any one time, approximately forty percent (40%) of the Fulton County \nJail inmate population was committed by the Fulton County Police Department. \n142.  The City of Atlanta Police Department transports arrestees arrested on state \ncharges directly to the Fulton County Jail, and commits them to the Fulton County \nJail. \n143.  The Atlanta Police Department (“Atlanta PD“) is a department of the City of \nAtlanta with an authorized strength of over 2,300 employees. \n  26 \n\n144.  Every year during the past five years, officers of the Atlanta PD arrested \nabout 30,000 persons and committed them to the Fulton County Jail. \n145.  Approximately seventy-five percent (75%) of the cases in the State Court of \nFulton County originate in the City of Atlanta. \n146.  Many arrests made by the Atlanta Police Department charged as \nmisdemeanors could also have been charged as municipal offenses. \n147.  Many arrests made by the Atlanta PD charged as state law misdemeanors \ncould also have been taken before the City of Atlanta courts, given probable cause \nhearings there, and bound over to the Fulton County Jail upon a finding of \nprobable cause.  O.C.G.A. §  17-4-21; O.C.G.A. §  17-4-62; O.C.G.A. § §  15-7-\n4(a)(3)-(4); 15-10-2(1), (3), (9); 17-4-40(a); 17-6-1(b)(1); 17-6-1(f)(1); 17-7-20; \nand O.C.G.A. § 36-32-3 (granting municipal court judges the same power and \nauthority as magistrate court judges in criminal cases). \n148.  Prior to January 1, 2003, the Atlanta PD committed all persons it arrested \nand charged with state offenses to a City of Atlanta detention facility instead of the \nFulton County Jail. \n149.  Prior to January 1, 2003, the City of Atlanta detained, and assumed the \nresponsibility for conducting the 48 hour “McLaughlin v. County of Riverside” \nprobable cause hearings for all persons its officers arrested; even persons its \nofficers arrested and charged with state offenses. \n  27 \n\n150.  Prior to January 1, 2003, the City of Atlanta detained all persons its officers \narrested, even persons its officers arrested and charged with state offenses, and \nconducted whatever probable cause hearing was given to such persons. \n151.  Prior to January 1, 2003, persons for whom probable cause was found on the \nstate offense were bound over to Superior Court, and transferred to the Fulton \nCounty Jail unless the person was released on bond. \n152.  Many such arrestees were held by the City of Atlanta for several days before \nbeing transferred to the Fulton County Jail. \n153.  Prior to January 1, 2003, many persons arrested by the Atlanta PD and \ncharged with state offenses had their charges reduced to a municipal offense as a \nresult of their probable cause hearings, or after processing by City of Atlanta \nattorneys.  \n154.  First Appearances for persons arrested for felons committed to the Fulton \nCounty Jail are held in the Fulton County Jail. \n155.  First Appearances for persons arrested for misdemeanors committed to the \nFulton County Jail are held in the State or Superior Court during the week, and in \nthe Fulton County Jail on Saturdays. \n156.  In-custody defendants are transported from the Fulton County Jail to the \nState or Superior Court for subsequent hearings such as bond hearings or status \nhearings. \n  28 \n\n157.  All in-custody defendants transported from the Fulton County Jail to a \ncourthouse for a hearing are returned to the Fulton County Jail after their court \nappearances (“court returns”), even those entitled to release by virtue of their court \nappearances. \n2003 Changes In City Of Atlanta Arrest And Commitment And Hearing Practices \n \n158.  During 2002, Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin conceived a plan to order \nAtlanta PD officers to exercise their discretion to charge all persons who could be \ncharged with either municipal or state offenses with state offenses. \n159.  During 2002, Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin conceived a plan to order \nAtlanta PD officers to exercise their discretion to commit all persons it arrested and \ncharged with state offenses to Fulton County Jail instead of an Atlanta detention \nfacility. \n160.  Mayor Shirley Franklin expressly announced that the purpose of her plan \nwas to save money for the City of Atlanta. \n161.  Mayor Franklin advised the City of Atlanta City Council that her plan would \nsave the City of Atlanta about $11.4 million in fiscal year 2003. \n162.  The City Council approved Mayor Franklin’s plan, and her proposed budget. \n  29 \n\n163.  Fulton County officials had estimated it would cost anywhere from $8 \nmillion to $17 million to process and house the arrestees the City of Atlanta had \npreviously processed and housed. \n164.  As of January 1, 2003, the Atlanta PD began charging all persons who could \nbe charged with either municipal offenses or state offenses with state offenses. \n165.  As of January 1, 2003, the City of Atlanta stopped detaining persons arrested \nby the Atlanta PD in Fulton County. \n166.  As of January 1, 2003, the Atlanta PD began committing those arrestees it \narrested in Fulton County and charged with state offenses directly to the Fulton \nCounty Jail. \nRecords Room And Operations Of The Records Room \n167.  The Records Room is the unit of the Fulton County Jail that has \nresponsibility for booking arrestees into the Fulton County Jail.  Additionally, \nthese employees create and administer institutional files for inmates, and keep \ntrack of inmates to ensuring their release according to their court ordered Release \nDates. \n168.  The Records Room uses a combined system of paper files and computer \ndatabases to keep track of inmates, prepare them to be transported to court for \n  30 \n\ncourt hearings, and process the release and commitment orders generated at the \ncourt hearings. \n169.  When inmates are “booked” into the Fulton County Jail, the Records Room \ncreates, or in the case of a person who has previously been booked into the Fulton \nCounty Jail, updates a 4x6 card for each inmate showing his demographic \ninformation, his open charges, and his charge history. \n170.  As part of the booking process, the Records Room staff also checks criminal \ndatabases to determine if the new commitment is the subject of any other wants, \nholds or detainers from other jurisdictions.   \n171.  If there are such holds, the information is noted in the inmate’s institutional \nfiles, and on the 4x6 card.   \n172.  Whether the inmate is the subject of any other wants, holds or detainers from \nother jurisdictions is also available in real time on the “Mainframe” computer, \navailable to Records Room staff and deputies. \n173.  The Jail and the courthouses have their own computer systems for keeping \ntrack of defendants and their court dates, and entering dispositions into the \ncomputer systems.  \n174.  As a result, court data, release, and commitment orders issued by judges for \nin-custody defendants must be faxed from the courthouses to the Fulton County \nJail.  This information must be processed by hand for each inmate.  \n  31 \n\n175.  The large number of inmates in the Fulton County Jail, and the constant flow \nof inmates and releases, have overwhelmed the outmoded, paper-driven system for \nprocessing inmates. \n176.  Lack of staff and lack of training exacerbates problems caused by the \nsystemic deficiencies in the inmate management system. \n177.  Chronic absenteeism of Jail staff caused by unsanitary conditions in the Jail \nexacerbates the problems caused by the systemic deficiencies in the inmate \nmanagement system. \n178.  Because of problems and backlogs in the Records Room, many newly \ncommitted inmates are not actually booked into the Jail for several days after their \ncommitment. \n179.  The Fulton County Jail also accepts for commitment to the Fulton County \nJail arrestees brought by the Atlanta PD, and the Fulton County Police Department, \nto the Fulton County Jail without charging or arrest documents.  \nThe Fulton County Jail Policy Of Strip Searching All Arrestees Booked Into The \nFulton County Jail \n180.  Every person booked into the Fulton County Jail general population is \nsubjected to a strip search conducted without an individual determination of \nreasonable suspicion to justify the search, and regardless of the crime with which \nthe person is charged. \n  32 \n\n181.  The booking strip search process involves having the arrested person go into \na large room with a group of up to thirty to forty other inmates, remove all of his \nclothing, and place the clothing in boxes.   \n182.  The arrested person, along with the group, takes a shower. \n183.  Each arrestee then either singly, or standing in a line with others, is visually \ninspected front and back by deputies. \n184.  Inmates and guards refer to the booking strip searches as “dressing out.” \n185.  The Fulton County Jail does not keep any logs or other records of any \nindividual strip searches performed in the booking areas. \n186.  The City of Atlanta, through its agents, has had notice of the booking strip \nsearches before the class period through communications with county agents, \ninmates and other methods. \nThe Fulton County Jail Practice Of Subjecting Certain Persons To Booking Strip \nSearches After They Have Already Been Ordered Released By A Judge Or Had \nTheir Bond Posted, Or Should Have Been Posted \n187.  The booking and presentment processes at the Fulton County Jail before and \nduring the class period were so inefficient that many persons were committed to \nthe Fulton County Jail, presented to a judicial officer in the Fulton County Jail or \none of the court houses at First Appearance, ordered released by the judicial \nofficer, and then subjected to the booking strip searches (the “dress out” \n  33 \n\nprocedure), or, the persons were subjected to the illegal booking searches after they \nhad posted bail or someone had posted it for them. \n188.  The only reasons Alpha Strip Search Class members were subjected to a \nbooking strip search is because the Fulton County Jail made going through the \nbooking process a condition of release, and it also made an illegal strip search a \ncomponent of the booking process. \n189.  The Fulton County Jail’s booking process, as administered and acquiesced \nin, by defendants was so indifferent to the rights of these persons that it made a \nstrip search an element of the booking process, and required the booking process as \na condition of release, even after a person was entitled to release by court order or \nbond. \nThe Fulton County Jail Policy For Court Returns \n190.  Every weekday, about 100 to 150 in-custody defendants are transported \nfrom the Fulton County Jail to the Superior Court and the State Court for court \nappearances. \n191.  The Records Room does not run checks for wants and holds on in-custody \ndefendants before they are transported to the courthouses for hearings. \n192.  The Records Room does pull the 4x6 card of each inmate who is going to a \ncourthouse for a hearing the night before the hearing, and puts the cards aside in \n  34 \n\nthe Records Room. \n193.  The in-custody defendants are under the constant supervision of Fulton \nCounty Sheriff’s deputies while in transit, and while at the courthouses. \n194.  While at the courthouse, in-custody defendants are not allowed to have \ncontact with anyone apart from Fulton County Sheriff’s deputies, except for visits \nin the lockups with attorneys.  These attorney visits are subject to supervision by \nFulton County Sheriff’s deputies during the visits. \n195.  After an in-custody defendant appears before a judge, the judge issues an \norder directing release or further commitment.  These orders are reduced to writing \nby the clerk. \n196.  The clerk does not enter the disposition into the court computer system in \nreal time. \n197.  Dispositions are entered into the court computer system later in the day, or \nthe next day. \n198.  The release and commitment orders are faxed to the Records Room. \n199.  In-custody defendants whose cases have been discharged are not given the \noption of being discharged from the courthouse. \n200.  Every in-custody defendant transported to the Superior Court or the State \nCourt for a court event is sent back to the Fulton County Jail following his court \nappearance even if the judge has issued a release order.  Such persons are \n  35 \n\nsometimes called “court returns”.  \n201.  The Fulton County Jail sends these court returns with release orders back to \nthe Fulton County Jail so the Records Room can check for any other open cases \nwith detention orders, warrants, detainers or holds before releasing them. \n202.  The Records Room relies on its paper records as updated by the faxed court \norders. Fulton County has not implemented a county-wide computer inmate \nmanagement system as it was ordered to do by this Court. \n203.  Court returns entitled to release are booked back into the Fulton County Jail \ngeneral populations while the Records Room processes the day’s commit and \nrelease orders.  Even though they are entitled to release, these court returns are not \nactually released until a later date. \nThe Fulton County Jail Policy For Court Returns \n204.  The Fulton County Jail staff subject many court returns to strip searches, \neven after the court return has been ordered released by a judge, and has no other \ncases, detainers, warrants, holds or other basis to detain him.   \n205.  These court return strip searches are different from the booking strip \nsearches because they do not involve the “dressing out” process of turning in \nclothes and going through the showers. \n  36 \n\nThe Cause Of The Overdetention – Detaining Persons Ordered Released To Check \nFor Detainers And Warrants; Collapse Of The Inmate Management System \n206.  The Fulton County Jail has no effective inmate management system.  \n207.  The Records Room is plagued by both overdetentions and premature \nreleases. \n208.  Both overdetentions and premature releases are symptomatic of a non-\nfunctioning inmate management system. \n209.  The fact that the Fulton County Jail has no effective inmate management \nsystem has been documented by a series of reports and newspaper articles, as well \nas by court cases dating back many years.   \n210.  The Fulton County Jail has recently aggravated the backlog of overdetained \ninmates by overreacting to a string of premature releases. \n211.  The Fulton County Jail's policy of returning all in-custody defendants sent to \nthe courthouses for hearings back to the Jail for processing after their hearings, \neven those whose cases have been dismissed, swells the backlog of unprocessed \ninmates.   \n212.  This policy and practice is a major contributing cause of the Records \nRoom’s inability to process and release individuals on their Release Dates. \n213.  The policy of sending court returns entitled to release back to the Jail, \ninstead of releasing them from the courthouses, creates the court return strip search \nproblem.   \n  37 \n\n214.  If the court returns entitled to release by virtue of their court appearances \nwere released at the courthouse, they would not be booked back in and strip \nsearched in the first place.   \n215.  The policy of sending court returns entitled to release back to the Jail, \ninstead of releasing them from the courthouses, exacerbates the overdetention and \novercrowding problem.  This policy adds persons who have already been ordered \nreleased by a judge into an already overloaded system.  \n216.  The Fulton County Jail's policy of sending all court returns, even those \nwhose cases have been dismissed, back to the jail for processing costs taxpayers \nmoney, swells the population of the facilities unnecessarily, and causes inmate \nunrest. \nThe Overcrowding, Overdetentions And Premature Releases Are A Longstanding, \nPervasive And Continuing Problem Known To Defendants \n217.  The Fulton County Jail has a long and documented history of overcrowding, \noverdetaining inmates past their release dates, and prematurely releasing inmates. \n218.  The old jail had been the subject of a 1982 class-action lawsuit (Fambro \nv. Fulton, 82-cv2136, JOF) challenging conditions at that facility, including \novercrowding and overdetentions. \n  38 \n\n219.  Among the many deficiencies the monitor found at the old jail in 1989, three \nbroad areas were especially outrageous: 1) overcrowding, 2) medical services, and \n3) sanitation. \n220.  The Court ultimately had to take the drastic step of ordered wholesale \nreleases in an attempt to solve the problems of 1) overcrowding, 2) medical \nservices, and 3) sanitation. \n221.  In 1989, this Court published a decision that warned the Fulton \nCounty Commissioners that the new jail would not be sufficient to handle \nthe present inmate population requirements of the county because of a \nsubstantially higher population, and problems with moving persons \nexpeditiously through the criminal justice system. \n222.  The 1982 class-action lawsuit continued to cover the current Rice Street Jail \nwhen that facility opened in 1991, until the suit was settled by the Fulton County \nCommission in 1994, and was dismissed by this Court. \n223.  The unconstitutional 1) overcrowding, 2) medical services, and 3) sanitation \ndeficiencies persisted in the new facility. \n224.  Certain inmates of the Fulton County Jail again brought a class action \nagainst Fulton County, the Sheriff, and the Board in 1999.  Foster v. Fulton \nCounty, 1:99-cv-900-MHS challenging 1) overcrowding, 2) medical services, \n  39 \n\nespecially medical services for HIV positive inmates, 3) overdetentions, and 4) \nsanitation. \n225.  The Court found that systemic problems lead to unnecessary incarceration \nand chronic jail overcrowding, which in turn adversely affected living conditions at \nthe jail, thus increasing the risk of exposure to dangerous diseases, and interfering \nwith the provision of adequate medical care, and thus being a major contributing \nmoving force of the overdetentions. \n226.  In Foster v. Fulton County, 1:99-cv-900-MHS, the defendants, including \nFulton County and Fulton County Board of Commissioners, Mike Kenn, Karen \nWebster, Tom Lowe, Bob Fulton, Emma I. Darnell, Nancy Boxill, L. L. Briggs, \nand George Herron, filed monthly reports on the jail population containing (among \nother things) information documenting a persistent pattern of overdetentions, \nincluding certain inmates held past their Release Dates. \n227.  Recent notorious examples of overdetention show the overdetention and \nstrip search problems persist.   \n228.  At least eight jail inmates were prematurely released by error over the year \n2004. \n229.  Inmates routinely must obtain attorneys or inmate rights organizations on the \noutside to call the Records Room just to obtain release in accordance with their \nRelease Dates. \n  40 \n\n230.  On information and belief, at any one time up to 5-20% of the Fulton County \nJail population is being held past their Release Dates. \n231.  In addition to the court opinions referenced above, there were numerous \nnewspaper articles and other media reports detailing the systemic problems of \nconstitutional magnitude at the Fulton County Jail, including problems of \nOverdetentions.  \n232.  On information and belief, Fulton County, the Fulton County Board and its \nmembers were fully aware of the court opinions, newspaper articles and other \nmedia reports and court filings detailing the systemic problems of constitutional \nmagnitude at the Fulton County Jail, including problems of Overdetentions. \n233.  On information and belief, Sheriff Barrett directly informed Fulton County, \nthe Fulton County Board and its members, on numerous occasions, that the \ninsufficiency of the County’s allocation of funds “for the efficient and effective \noperation of the jail”, O.C.G.A. § 42-4-94(b), were directly responsible for serious \ndeficiencies of constitutional magnitude in the jail’s operation, including the \nproblem of Overdetentions.  \n234.  On information and belief, Fulton County, the Fulton County Board and its \nmembers were fully aware that the problem of Overdetentions at the Fulton County \nJail was significantly attributed to its lack of adequate funding “for the efficient \nand effective operation of the jail.” O.C.G.A. § 42-4-94(b).  \n  41 \n\n235.  On information and belief, Fulton County, the Fulton County Board and its \nmembers knowingly refused to provide adequate funding “for the efficient and \neffective operation of the jail.” O.C.G.A. § 42-4-94(b), and were fully aware that \nits inaction would result in the perpetuation of problems of the operation of the jail \nof constitutional magnitude, including Overdetentions. \n236.

Overdetentions happen at practically every event in the criminal justice \nsystem from arrest to trial. \n232.  The problem starts when inmates are committed into the Fulton County \nJail without being “booked in”; that is, fingerprinted, identified, checked for \noutstanding wants, holds, warrants and detainers, and entered into the \ncomputerized inmate management system. \n  52 \n\n233.  For example, Plaintiff Alan Powell was arrested and committed into the \nFulton County Jail early on the morning of Saturday, March 20, 2004.  He was not \nbooked in until approximately 6:00 p.m. the following day; Sunday, March 21, \n2004. \n234.  As a result, Mr. Powell was not taken to the misdemeanor court in State \nCourt for First Appearance, and so was not given a bond hearing. \n235.  Moreover, even though Mr. Powell was entitled to bail based on a \nschedule for minor offenses, Jail staff told him that he could not be released on bail \nuntil after he was booked. \n236.  Finally, on the evening of Sunday, March 21, 2004, Mr. Powell was \nformerly booked into the jail. \n237.  Along with the booking procedure came a degrading, humiliating strip \nsearch. \n238.  Mr. Powell, and everyone else booked into the Fulton County Jail on \nSunday night (or any other night or day), was taken to a large room, told to take off \nall clothes, put them in a plastic box, and take a shower with the entire group in a \nsingle large room.   \n239.  Then each man took his clothes to a counter and exchanged his own \nclothes for a jail jumpsuit. \n  53 \n\n240.  Before picking up his jumpsuit, Mr. Powell, along with every other \ninmate in the process, had to stand before a guard front and center, and show his \nfront and back sides while naked. \n241.  Mr. Powell’s family posted his bond on Sunday, March 21, 2004. \n242.  However, Mr. Powell was not released.  When he complained, guards \nthreatened to “lose” his paperwork. \n243.  Mr. Powell was finally released on Tuesday morning, March 23, 2004. \n244.  The jail frequently sends recently arrested inmates to bond hearings at \nState Court before the inmates have been booked in. \n245.  As a result, the bond hearings are meaningless because the inmates \ncannot be either charged or bonded out since they have not yet been booked. \n246.  Without the paperwork generated by a booking, prosecutors lack the \ndocumentation necessary to show probable cause. Without probable cause, judges \nare forced to throw out cases within 48 hours.   \n247.  On March 18, 2004, Judge Roy Roberts in State Court dismissed \nmisdemeanor charges against 22 defendants because they were presented in his \ncourtroom without paperwork.  They had been sent to court without having been \nbooked. \n248.  However, even when a judge orders inmates released at the first \nappearance, their release is no sure thing. \n  54 \n\n249.  During the period March 18-31, 2004, approximately 135 persons \npresented before the magistrate for a probable cause hearing.. \n250.  Almost every single person was overdetained for periods ranging from \none day to twelve days. (see chart at ¶131). \nDefendants’ Knowledge Of The Collapse Of The Inmate Management System \nAt The Fulton County Jail \n251.  Defendants have known of the ineffective and chaotic condition of the \nRecords Room inmate management system for years. \n252.  The City of Atlanta, through its agents, has had notice of the \noverdetention problem at the Fulton County Jail for years, through court opinions, \nnewspaper articles, TV news reports, or communications with county agents. \n253.  Moreover, jail officials have had personal knowledge of the problem for \nyears.   \n254.  The Fulton County Commission has also been aware of the above-\ndescribed problems in the inmate management system for years. \n255.  In the past few years, the Fulton County commissioners have had a \nfederal judge, a grand jury, two separate private consultants, and a rash of escapes \nto tell them about problems at the Fulton County Jail.  These problems are such as \nmoney for more guards, money for mental health treatment, money for new \n  55 \n\nfacilities to handle nonviolent inmates in work-release programs, money to fix a \ncrippled computer system, money to streamline the court system, money for public \ndefenders, and money for more probation officers. \n256.  Recently, Defendant Jacqueline Barrett released a statement terming \ncontinuing problems at the crowded and understaffed jail a \"state of emergency.\" \nDefendant Jacqueline Barrett's Failure To Take Meaningful, Sustained \nCorrective Action \n257.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett has acquiesced in the Records Room's \nchaotic procedures leading to the overdetention and strip search problems by \nfailing to take any meaningful, sustained corrective action. \n258.  The Fulton County Jail is understaffed.  Only about 650 guards watch \nover 2,900 inmates. \n259.  Fulton County has refused to provide adequate funding to the Fulton \nCounty Jail. \n260.  Last year, the Fulton County Commission reduced the Jail’s funding by \n$3,000,000. \n261.  Jacqueline Barrett never sent inmates to other county jails as she was \nauthorized to do under Georgia law. \n262.  In an opinion published on April 16, 2002, just a couple of weeks \nbefore the start of the class period, Judge Shoob held that it cost the county about \n  56 \n\n$45 per inmate per day to house an inmate in the Fulton County Jail.  Foster v. \nFulton County, 223 F. Supp. 2d 1292, 1295 n.3 (N.D. Ga. 2002). \n263.  Since at least 2002 the Board and the sheriff have had the option of \nsending inmates awaiting transfer to the state correctional system to other jails in \nGeorgia such as the facility in Pelham, Georgia. \n264.  Since 2002, Gwinnett County has \"housed out\" surplus inmates to \nPelham, 240 miles from Lawrenceville, at the rate of $35 per day. \n265.  \"We don't have a choice,\" said Gwinnett County Sheriff Butch Conway \nwas quoted as saying.  The population of Sheriff Conway’s 1,235-bed jail routinely \nexceeds its capacity, forcing inmates to sleep on mattresses on the floor. \n266.  The inmates housed out from Gwinnett County usually have been \nconvicted and are awaiting state cell space. \n267.  The Fulton County Commission never exercised its constitutional \npowers to build another jail or an addition to the Fulton County Jail. \n  57 \n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nARRESTEE STRIP SEARCHES CLASS ALLEGATIONS \nArrestee Strip Searches Performed on Arrestee Strip Search Class Named \nPlaintiffs \n268.  On May 20, 2004, Plaintiff Alan Powell was booked into the Fulton \nCounty Jail’s general population a second time on the same charges after his bond \nwas revoked.  He was subjected to a strip search without any individualized \nfinding of reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that he was concealing \ncontraband or weapons. \n269.  On August 22, 2003, Plaintiff David Evans was booked into the Fulton \nCounty Jail’s general population.  He was subjected to a strip search without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons. \n270.  On August 22, 2003, Plaintiff Stanley Clemons was booked into the \nFulton County Jail’s general population on a charge of felony burglary.  He was \nsubjected to a strip search before presentment without any individualized finding \nof reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that he was concealing contraband or \nweapons.  At First Appearance his charge was reduced to criminal trespass, but he \nwas indicted subsequently on burglary. \n  58 \n\n271.  On March 8, 2004, Plaintiff Allen Middleton was booked into the \nFulton County Jail’s general population.  He was subjected to a strip search \nwithout any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that \nhe was concealing contraband or weapons. \n272.  On March 24, 2004, Plaintiff Anthony Westbrook was booked into the \nFulton County Jail’s general population and subjected to a strip search without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons. \n273.  On April 26, 2004 Plaintiff Benjamin Blake was booked into the Fulton \nCounty Jail’s general population and subjected to a strip search without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons. \n274.  On February 11, 2004 Plaintiff Harry Witherspoon was booked into the \nFulton County Jail’s general population and subjected to a strip search without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons. \n“Arrestee Strip Search Class” -- Class Action Allegations \n275.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs bring this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \n  59 \n\nbehalf of a class consisting of each person who, in the two years preceding the \nfiling of this action up until the date this case is terminated, was or will be, (i) upon \nbeing arrested and committed into the Fulton County Jail; (ii) on a charge other \nthan a charge of drugs, weapons or felony violence; (iii) was subjected to a blanket \nstrip search without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable \ncause that he or she was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband.  \n276.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \nis appropriate because the Fulton County Jail has a policy, and engages in a pattern \nand practice of conduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class. \nInjunctive relief against Defendant to enjoin the practice will benefit each and \nevery Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiff and class member. \n277.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above- \ndescribed policy and practice of subjecting arrestees to blanket strip searches \nwithout any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or probable cause that \nhe or she was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband. \n278.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) \nis also appropriate in that common questions of law and fact predominate over any \nindividual questions. A class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n279.  Regarding the Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and members of \n  60 \n\nthe class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability. Every arrestee \ncommitted into the Fulton County Jail is subjected to the blanket strip searches. \nNone of the staff of the Fulton County Jail keeps records of these searches. \nTherefore, Defendant cannot show that any of the searches were conducted based \non an individual determination of reasonable suspicion.  Should records exist \ndemonstrating such individualized suspicion, such people would, by definition, not \nbe members of the class. \n280.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett instituted a policy, or acquiesced in a \ncustom and practice of subjecting arrestees committed to the Fulton County \nJail pending presentment to blanket strip searches without an individualized \ndetermination that the arrestees were in possession of drugs, weapons or \nother contraband; \nb) whether such policy or practice, if found to exist, violates the Fourth or \nFourteenth Amendment; \nc)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett was deliberately indifferent to the \nrights of such arrestees; \nd) whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to qualified immunity on \nthe §1983 claims;  \n  61 \n\ne)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett is entitled to governmental immunity \non the state law claims; \nf)  whether the County Defendants are liable for plaintiffs’ injuries;  \ng) whether the City of Atlanta is liable for plaintiffs injuries; \nh) whether the Arrestee Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs and the members \nof the class have sustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such \ndamages; \ni)  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically representative \nsample of the class provides the basis for determination of all class \nmembers’ damages except those who opt out; and \nj)  whether the Arrestee Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs and the members \nof the class and future members are entitled to equitable relief and, if so, \nwhat is the nature of that relief. \n287.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The \nexact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time.  However, \nevery week at least 100 persons meeting the Arrestee Strip Search Class class \ndefinition are committed into the Fulton County Jail pending presentment.  All are \nsubject to the illegal searches.  Thus, this class well exceeds 10,000 members. \n288.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and the Fulton County Jail and the County \nDefendants have within their records the names and addresses of all current and \n  62 \n\npast class members. This information is maintained in the Fulton County Jail \ncomputer systems (CJUS, JDL and Banner and Mainframe), logbooks, and other \npaper records maintained by the Fulton County Jail and the Fulton County \nDefendants. \n289.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims \nof the other members of the class because the Arrestee Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs, and all other members of the class, were injured by exactly the same \nmeans; that is, by the blanket strip searches. \n290.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class.  They have retained counsel who \nare competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action \nlitigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n291.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are \ncontrary to, or in conflict with, those of the class. \n292.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will \nbe encountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its \nmaintenance as a class action.  The class action is superior to any other available \nmeans to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Fourth Amendment Class.  The \nclass action will be manageable because so many different records systems exist \nfrom which to ascertain the members of the putative class. Damages can be \n  63 \n\ndetermined on a class-wide basis using a damages matrix set by a jury, or by trying \nthe damages of a statistically valid sample of the class to a jury and extrapolating \nthose damages to the class as a whole. \n293.  Class treatment will be superior because liability can be determined on a \nclass-wide basis.  Damages can also be determined on a class-wide basis through \nuse of statistical sampling.  \nALPHA STRIP SEARCHES CLASS ALLEGATIONS \nAlpha Strip Searches Performed By The Fulton County Jail \n294.  On 3/21/04, someone posted bond for Plaintiff Alan Powell.   \n295.  On 3/22/04, after someone had posted bond for him but before he was \npresented to a judicial officer for First Appearance, Plaintiff Alan Powell was \nsubjected to a strip search without any individualized finding of reasonable \nsuspicion, or probable cause that he was concealing contraband or weapons. \n296.  On 3/19/04, Plaintiff Kristopher Alan Matkin was ordered released by a \njudicial officer after his case was dismissed at First Appearance.   \n297.  On 3/22/04, after a judicial officer had dismissed his case and ordered him \nreleased at First Appearance, Plaintiff Kristopher Alan Matkin was subjected to a \nstrip search without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion, or probable \ncause that he was concealing contraband or weapons. \n  64 \n\n“Alpha Strip Search Class” -- Class Action Allegations \n298.  The Alpha Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules \n23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of \na class consisting of each person who, in the two years preceding the filing of this \naction up until the date this case is terminated, was or will be, (i) upon being \narrested and committed into the Fulton County Jail; (ii) subjected to a booking strip \nsearch without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable \ncause that he or she was concealing drugs, weapons or other contraband; (iii) after \na judicial officer had ordered his release at First Appearance, or, in the case of \npersons released without being taken before a judicial officer, after he had already \nposted bond (or someone had already posted it for him).  \n299.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because the Fulton County Jail has a policy, and engages in a pattern \nand practice of conduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class. \nInjunctive relief against Defendants to enjoin the practice will benefit each and \nevery Alpha Strip Search Class Named Plaintiff and class member. \n300.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above- described \npolicy and practice. \n301.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate in that common questions of law and fact predominate over any \n  65 \n\nindividual questions. A class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n302.  Regarding the Alpha Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs and members of \nthe class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability. None of the \nstaff of the Fulton County Jail keeps records of these searches. Therefore, \nDefendants cannot show that any of the searches were conducted based on an \nindividual determination of reasonable suspicion.  Should records exist \ndemonstrating such individualized suspicion, such people would, by definition, not \nbe members of the class. \n303.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na)  whether Defendants acquiesced in a practice or policy in which persons: (i) \nupon being arrested and committed into the Fulton County Jail; (ii) after a \njudicial officer at First Appearance had ordered their release, or, in the case \nof persons released without being taken before a judicial officer, after they \nhad already posted bond (or someone had already posted it for them); (iii) \nwere subjected to a blanket strip search without any individualized finding \nof reasonable suspicion or probable cause that they were concealing drugs, \nweapons or other contraband; \nb) whether such policy or practice, if found to exist, violates the Fourth or \nFourteenth Amendment; \n  66 \n\nc)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and Myron Freeman were deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of such arrestees; \nd) whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and Myron Freeman are entitled to \nqualified immunity on the §1983 claims;  \ne)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and Myron Freeman are entitled to \ngovernmental immunity on the state law claims; \nf)  whether the County Defendants are liable for plaintiffs’ injuries;  \ng) whether the City of Atlanta is liable for plaintiffs injuries; \nh)  whether the Alpha Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs and the members of \nthe class have sustained damages and, if so, the proper measure of such \ndamages; \ni)  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically representative \nsample of the class provides the basis for determination of all class \nmembers’ damages except those who opt out; and \nj)  whether the Alpha Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs and the members of \nthe class and future members are entitled to equitable relief and, if so, what \nis the nature of that relief. \n304.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The \nexact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time.  However, \nupon information and belief every week at least 20 persons meeting the Alpha \n  67 \n\nClass class definition are committed into the Fulton County Jail.  All are subject to \nthe illegal searches.  Thus, this class well exceeds 2,000 members. \n305.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and/or Myron Freeman and/or the Fulton \nCounty Jail and the Fulton County Defendants have within their records the names \nand addresses of all current and past class members. This information is \nmaintained in the Fulton County Jail computer systems (CJUS, JDL and Banner \nand Mainframe), logbooks, and other paper records maintained by the Fulton \nCounty Jail and the Fulton County Defendants. \n306.  The Alpha Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class because the Alpha Strip Search Class \nNamed Plaintiffs, and all other members of the class, were injured by exactly the \nsame means; that is, by the blanket strip searches. \n307.  The Alpha Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class.  They have retained counsel who \nare competent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action \nlitigation and/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n308.  The Alpha Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are \ncontrary to, or in conflict with, those of the class. \n309.  The Alpha Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that \nwill be encountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its \n  68 \n\nmaintenance as a class action.  The class action is superior to any other available \nmeans to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Fourth Amendment Class.  The \nclass action will be manageable because so records systems exist from which to \nascertain the members of the putative class. Damages can be determined on a \nclass-wide basis using a damages matrix set by a jury, or by trying the damages of \na statistically valid sample of the class to a jury and extrapolating those damages to \nthe class as a whole. \n310.

Damages can also be determined on a class-wide basis through \nuse of statistical sampling. \nCOURT RETURN STRIP SEARCH CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n“Court Return Strip Search Class” -- Class Action Allegations \n311.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiffs were subjected to illegal \nstrip searches after their court appearances as described above. \n312.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiffs brings this action under \nRules 23(a), 23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of a class consisting of: each person who, in the two years preceding the \nfiling of this action up until the date this case is terminated, has been, is or will be: \n(i) in the custody of the Fulton County Jail; (ii) taken to court from the Fulton \n  69 \n\nCounty Jail; (iii) ordered released by the court or otherwise became entitled to \nrelease by virtue of the court appearance because the charge on which he had been \nheld was no longer pending or was dismissed at the hearing, was ordered released \non his own recognizance, or had posted bail, was sentenced to time served, was \nacquitted or was otherwise entitled to release; (iv) was not the subject of any other \npending case or cases which imposed any condition of release other than personal \nrecognizance; (v) was not the subject of any detainer or warrant; (vi) was returned \nto the Fulton County Jail; and (vii) was subjected to a strip search without any \nindividualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he was \nconcealing contraband or weapons before being released, regardless of whether he \nwas overdetained. \n313.  Certification of the Court Return Strip Search Class under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate because Defendant Jacqueline Barrett \nimplemented a policy, and/or acquiesces in a pattern and practice of conduct that \nhas uniformly affected all members of the class, and on information and belief, that \nher successor, Myron Freeman has done so. Injunctive relief against Defendant \nwill benefit each and every Overdetention Named Plaintiff and class member. \n314.  The  Court Return Strip Search Class  is entitled to injunctive relief of \nterminating the above-described policy of subjecting court returns entitled to \nrelease by virtue of their court appearances to strip searches without any \n  70 \n\nindividualized findings of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that the court \nreturns were concealing contraband or weapons. \n315.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate in that common questions of law and fact predominate over any \nindividual questions.  A class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n316.  Regarding the Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and members of \nthe class, there are no individual questions on the issue of liability because every \ncourt return returned to the Fulton County Jail is subjected to the blanket searches.  \nNo records of the searches are kept. Defendant Jacqueline Barrett cannot show that \nany of the searches were conducted based on an individual determination of \nreasonable suspicion.  Should records exist demonstrating such individualized \nsuspicion, such people would, by definition, not be members of the class. On \ninformation and belief, Defendant Myron Freeman has continued the \naforementioned policies. \n317.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na)  whether there is a policy, custom and practice of subjecting court returns \nentitled to release by virtue of their court appearances returned to the Fulton \nCounty Jail to blanket strip searches without an individualized determination \nthat the person was in possession of drugs, weapons or other contraband; \n  71 \n\nb) whether such policy or practice, if found to exist, violates the Fourth or \nFourteenth Amendment; \nc)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and/or Myron Freeman were \ndeliberately indifferent to the rights of such arrestees; \nd) whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and/or Myron Freeman  are entitled to \nqualified immunity on the §1983 claims;  \ne)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and/or Myron Freeman are entitled to \ngovernmental immunity on the state law claims; \nf)  whether the County Defendants are liable for the Court Return Strip Search \nClass Named Plaintiffs’ injuries;  \ng) whether the City of Atlanta is liable for the Court Return Strip Search Class \nNamed Plaintiffs’ injuries; \nh) whether the Court Return Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class have sustained damages and, if so, the proper measure \nof such damages; \ni)  whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically representative \nsample of the class provides the basis for determination of all class \nmembers’ damages except those who opt out; and \n  72 \n\nj)  whether the Court Return Strip Search Class Named Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the class and future members are entitled to equitable relief and, \nif so, what is the nature of that relief. \n317.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The \nexact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time, but is likely to \nconsist of at least many hundreds of people. \n318.  Every week at least 100 persons meeting the Court Return Strip Search \nClass definition are committed into the Fulton County Jail pending presentment \nand subjected to the illegal searches.  Thus this class well exceeds 10,000 \nmembers. \n319.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and/or Defendant Myron Freeman and the \nFulton County Jail have within their records the names and addresses of all current \nand past Court Return Strip Search Class members in the Fulton County Jail \ncomputer systems (CJUS, JDL and Banner and Mainframe), logbooks and other \npaper records maintained by the Fulton County Jail and the Fulton County \nDefendants. \n320.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \nclaims of the other members of the class, because the Court Return Strip Search \nNamed Plaintiffs and all other members of the class were injured by exactly the \nsame means; that is, by the blanket searches. \n  73 \n\n321.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the members of the class.

The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs bring this action under Rules 23(a), \n23(b) (2), and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of a class \nconsisting of: (a) each person who has been, is, or who will be incarcerated in any \nFulton County Jail facility in the two years preceding the filing of this action up to \nand until the date this case is terminated; and (b) who was not released or, in the \nfuture, will not be released by midnight on the date on which the person is entitled \nto be released by court order, posting bail, or the date on which the basis for his or \nher detention has otherwise expired.  \n391.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is \nappropriate because Defendant Jacqueline Barrett implemented, and, on \ninformation and belief,  Defendant Myron Freeman continued a policy, or or \nengaged or engages in a pattern and practice of conduct that has uniformly affected \nall members of the class, Injunctive relief against Defendant Myron Freeman, the \ncurrent Sheriff will benefit each and every Overdetention Named Plaintiff and \nclass member. \n392.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above described \npolicy and practice of overdetentions. \n393.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is \nalso appropriate in that common questions of law and fact predominate over any \n  82 \n\nindividual questions.  A class action is superior for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy as detailed below.  \n394.  Regarding the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs and members of the class, \nthere are no individual questions on the issue of liability other than whether an \nindividual has been overdetained.  The answer to that question can be determined \nby ministerial inspection of the Jail's records. \n395.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are: \na)  whether the Constitution provides a bright line, maximum length of time \nmeasured in hours beyond which Defendant cannot hold a person before \nreleasing that person from jail after a judge has ordered his release or he has \nposted bail, or the basis for his detention has otherwise expired;  \nb) whether Defendants have exceeded that maximum for each class member; \nc)  whether there is a pattern and practice of the Fulton County Jail of holding \ninmates past their Release Dates; \nd) whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and/or Myron Freeman have been \ndeliberately indifferent to the pattern and practice of the Fulton County Jail \nof holding inmates past their Release Dates; \ne)  whether Defendants’ acts as alleged herein violate the Constitution of the \nUnited States by holding detainees and inmates past their release dates; \n  83 \n\nf)  whether such policy, if found to exist, violates the Fourth and/or Fourteenth \nAmendments; \ng) whether Jacqueline Barrett and/or Myron Freeman were deliberately \nindifferent to the rights of inmates and detainees in the custody of the Fulton \nCounty Jail;  \nh) whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and/or Myron Freeman are entitled to \nqualified immunity on the section 1983 claims;  \ni)  whether Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and/or Myron Freeman are entitled to \ngovernmental immunity on the state law claims; \nj)  whether the County Defendants are liable for plaintiffs’ injuries;  \nk) whether the City of Atlanta is liable for plaintiffs injuries; \nl)  whether the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs and the members of the \nOverdetention Class have sustained damages and, if so, the proper measure \nof such damages; \nm) whether determination of damages suffered by a statistically representative \nsample of the class provides the basis for determination of all class \nmembers’ damages except those who opt out; and \nn) whether the Overdetention Class Named Plaintiffs and the members of the \nclass and future members are entitled to equitable relief and, if so, what is \nthe nature of that relief. \n  84 \n\n397.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  The \nexact number of class members is unknown to plaintiffs at this time.  However, \nevery week at least 100 persons meeting the Overdetention Class definition are \nreleased from the Fulton County Jail.  Thus, this class well exceeds 10,000 \nmembers. \n398.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and/or Myron Freeman and the Fulton County \nJail and the Fulton County Defendants have within their records the names and \naddresses of all current and past class members. This information is maintained in \nthe Fulton County Jail computer systems (CJUS, JDL and Banner and Mainframe), \nlogbooks, and other paper records maintained by the Fulton County Jail and the \nFulton County Defendants. \n399.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the \nother members of the class, because the Overdetention Named Plaintiffs and all \nother members of the class were injured by exactly the same means; that is, by the \nsystemic collapse of the inmate management system, and the practice of returning \nin-custody defendants entitled to release by virtue of their court appearances from \nthe courthouses to the Fulton County Jail to check for wants, holds and detainers. \n400.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the members of the class.  They have retained counsel who are \ncompetent and experienced in complex federal civil rights class action litigation \n  85 \n\nand/or complex federal prisoner rights litigation. \n401.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs have no interests that are contrary to, or \nin conflict with, those of the class. \n402.  The Overdetention Named Plaintiffs know of no difficulty that will be \nencountered in the management of this litigation that would preclude its \nmaintenance as a class action.  The class action is superior to any other available \nmeans to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Fourth Amendment Class.  The \nclass action will be manageable because so many different records systems exist \nfrom which to ascertain the members of the putative class, and damages can be \ndetermined on a class wide basis using a damages matrix set by a jury or by trying \nthe damages of a statistically valid sample of the class to a jury, and extrapolating \nthose damages to the class as a whole.   \n403.  Class treatment will be superior because liability can be determined on a \nclass-wide basis.  Damages can also be determined on a class-wide basis through \nuse of statistical sampling. \n  86 \n\nSUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS \nCLAIMS OF ARRESTEE STRIP SEARCH NAMED PLAINTIFFS \nCount 1 \nSection 1983 Claims Of Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs Against \nDefendants Jacqueline Barrett and Myron Freeman \n404.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by \nreference all allegations set forth above in this Fourth Amended Complaint. \n405.  The phrase “Defendants” as used in Counts 1 and 2 herein refer to \nDefendants Barrett and Freeman. \n406.  Upon being booked into the Fulton County Jail, each of the Arrestee Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiffs, and every other Arrestee Strip Search Class member, was \nsubjected to a strip search without an individual determination that the search \nwould reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband. \n407.  Subjecting an arrestee arrested on a non-drug, non-weapon non-violent \nfelony offense to a strip search, without an individual determination that the search \nwould reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband, violates his or her Fourth \nAmendment and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n408.  Defendant Jacqueline Barrett knew that the Arrestee Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs and other class members would be subjected to these searches in the \n  87 \n\nFulton County Jail, and acquiesced in the searches. \n409.  On information and belief, Defendant Myron Freeman has continued the \nstrip search policies of Defendant Barrett, and was aware, or should have been \naware, that the strip search policies complained of herein were continuing. \n410.  Defendants’ actions, and failures to act as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were the moving forces behind the violations of the \nArrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs, and the class members’ Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendment Rights. \n411.  Defendants caused the unreasonable strip searches of the Arrestee Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiffs and all other class members by deliberate indifference to \nthe risk of constitutional injury by maintaining and/or acquiescing in a policy and \npractice and custom of strip searching arrestees. \n412.  Defendants are therefore liable under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for constitutional \ninjuries to the Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other class members \ncaused by their conduct. \nCount 2 \nNegligent Training And Negligent Supervision And Failure To Implement Policies \nClaims Against Defendant Jacqueline Barrett and Myron Freeman \n413.

Defendants entrusted certain duties including, but not limited to, searching \nall arrestees booked into the Fulton County Jail to certain Jail employees. \n415.  Therefore, Defendants had a duty to exercise reasonable care in training, \nsupervising and disciplining such employees in exercising their duties. \n416.  The need for such training was and is obvious from the nature of the \nresponsibilities entrusted to such jail employees. \n417.  Defendants deliberately failed to implement and enforce procedures \nemployees needed to ensure the constitutional searches of inmates. \n418.  The problems at the jail described above, and the various reports in the \nmedia, should have made it obvious to Defendants that the training employees \nunder her supervision and control were receiving was inadequate, that the policies \nin place were inadequate, and that, as a direct and proximate result of these \ninadequacies, the inmates under her supervision would suffer injury. \n419.  Defendants negligently trained and supervised, or negligently failed to train \nand supervise such employees in their duties; failed to implement policies and, as a \nresult, such employees were incompetent to perform their duties. \n420.  This negligent training; negligent failure to train; failure to  supervise, and \nfailure to implement policies by Defendants resulted in the unconstitutional strip \nsearches of the Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs  and the other members of \nthe putative class. \n  89 \n\n421.  As a result of said negligence of Defendants, Arrestee Strip Search Named \nPlaintiffs suffered injuries described in the preceding paragraphs of this Fourth \nAmended Complaint. \nCount 3 \nSection 1983 Claims Of Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs Against Defendant \nFulton County And Each Of Karen Handel, Robb Pitts, Tom Lowe, Emma I. \nDarnell, Nancy A.

Defendant Fulton County and each of Karen Handel, Robb Pitts, Tom Lowe, \nEmma I. Darnell, Nancy A. Boxill and William \"Bill\" Edwards’ deliberate \nindifference to the rights of the Arrestee Strip Search Class members to be free \nfrom illegal strip searches was the motivating factor of their injuries described \nabove.  \nCount 4 \nSection 1983 Claims Of Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs Against Defendant \nCity Of Atlanta \n429.  The Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by \nreference all allegations set forth above in this Fourth Amended Complaint. \n430.  The City of Atlanta, acting through its mayor and council, had control over \nthe Atlanta PD’s policy of charging persons arrested within the municipality for \neither municipal or state charges. \n431.  The City of Atlanta, acting through its mayor and council, had control over \n  91 \n\nthe city’s policy of holding persons arrested by the Atlanta PD within the \nmunicipality in an Atlanta detention facility.  \n432.  The City of Atlanta, acting through its mayor and council, had control over \nthe city’s policy of holding first appearance for persons arrested within the \nmunicipality in the Atlanta court system.  \n433.  The City of Atlanta, acting through its mayor and council, knew that the \nFulton County Jail was overcrowded during the ten years preceding this Fourth \nAmended Complaint. \n434.  The City of Atlanta, acting through its mayor and council, knew that the \nFulton County Jail had a custom and policy of subjecting all new commitments to \nblanket strip searches without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion as \npart of the booking process both before and during the class period. \n435.  Still, the City of Atlanta, acting through its mayor and council, discontinued \nits policy of committing persons arrested in the municipality to an Atlanta \ndetention facility and holding their first presentment hearings there. \n436.  The City of Atlanta, acting through its mayor and council, began directing \nits police officers to charge all persons they arrested with state charges, whenever \npossible, and commit them to the Fulton County Jail upon arrest. \n437.  The City of Atlanta, acting through its mayor and council, knew that \nDefendant Fulton County and the Board and the Fulton County Sheriff were \n  92 \n\ndeliberately indifferent to the rights of the Arrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs \nand the Arrestee Strip Search Class class members to be free from blanket strip \nsearches without an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion as part of the \nbooking process.  \n438.  The City of Atlanta’s deliberate indifference to the rights of the Arrestee \nStrip Search Named Plaintiffs and the Arrestee Strip Search Class class to be free \nfrom blanket strip searches without an individualized finding of reasonable \nsuspicion as part of the booking process was the moving force behind their \ninjuries.  \n439.  Defendant City of Atlanta is therefore liable under the Fourth and the \nFourteenth Amendments through 42 U.S.C. §1983 for constitutional injuries to the \nArrestee Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other class members caused by its \nconduct described herein and is jointly and severally liable with all other \ndefendants for injuries caused by their conduct described herein. \n  93 \n\nCLAIMS OF ALPHA STRIP SEARCH NAMED PLAINTIFFS \nCount 5 \nSection 1983 Claims Of Alpha Strip Search Named Plaintiffs Against Defendants \nJacqueline Barrett and Myron Freeman \n440.

Subjecting an Alpha Strip class member to such strip searches, without an \nindividual determination that the search would reveal weapons, drugs or other \ncontraband, violates his or her Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment \nRights. \n443.

The City of Atlanta, acting through its mayor and council, knew that \nDefendant Fulton County and the Board and the Fulton County Sheriff were \ndeliberately indifferent to the rights of the Alpha Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and \nthe Alpha Strip Search Class class members to be free from blanket strip searches \nwithout an individualized finding of reasonable suspicion as part of the booking \nprocess, even after they had been ordered released at First Appearance or after \nposting bond (or having it posted for them).  \n474.  The City of Atlanta’s deliberate indifference to the rights of the Alpha Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiffs and the Alpha Strip Search Class class members to be free \nfrom blanket strip searches without an individualized finding of reasonable \nsuspicion as part of the booking process was the moving force behind their \ninjuries.  \n475.  Defendant City of Atlanta is therefore liable under 42 U.S.C. §1983 for \nconstitutional injuries to the Alpha Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and all other \nAlpha Strip Search class members caused by its conduct described herein and is \njointly and severally liable with all other defendants for injuries caused by their \nconduct described herein. \n \n  100 \n\nCLAIMS OF COURT RETURN STRIP SEARCH NAMED PLAINTIFFSS \nCount 9 \nSection 1983 Claim of Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiffs against \nDefendant Jaquelyn Barrett and Myron Freeman \n476.  The Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiffs reallege and incorporates by \nreference all allegations set forth above in this Complaint. \n477.  Upon returning from the Superior Court or State Court to the Fulton County \nJail after court hearings at which a judge ordered him released, the Court Return \nStrip Search Named Plaintiffs, and many other Court Return Strip Search Class \nmember, was subjected to a strip search without an individual determination that \nthe search would reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband. \n478.  Subjecting court returns entitled to release by virtue of their court \nappearances to strip searches without an individual determination that the search \nwould reveal weapons, drugs or other contraband violates their Fourth Amendment \nand Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n479.  The phrase “Defendants” as used in Counts 9 and 10 herein refers to \nDefendants Barrett and Freeman. \n480.  Defendants knew that the Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiffs and \nother class members would be subjected to searches in the Fulton County Jail, and \nacquiesced in such searches. \n  101 \n\n481.  Defendants’ actions, and failure to act as described above, directly and \nproximately and affirmatively were and are the moving forces behind the \nviolations of the Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiffs’ and the class \nmembers’ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. \n482.  Defendants caused the unreasonable strip searches of the Court Return Strip \nSearch Named Plaintiffs and all other class members by deliberate indifference to \nthe risk of constitutional injury by maintaining and/or acquiescing in a policy and \npractice and custom of strip searching arrestees. \n483.

Therefore, Defendants had a duty to exercise reasonable care in training,  \nsupervising, and disciplining such employees in exercising their duties. \n487.  The need for such training was obvious from the nature of the \nresponsibilities entrusted to such jail employees. \n488.  Defendants deliberately failed to implement and enforce procedures \nemployees under her supervision and control needed to ensure the constitutional \nsearches of court returns entitled to release by virtue of their court appearances. \n489.  The problems at the jail described above, and the various reports in the \nmedia should have made it obvious to Defendants that the training such employees \nwere receiving was inadequate, the policies in place were inadequate, and that as a \ndirect and proximate result of these inadequacies, the inmates under her \nsupervision would suffer injury. \n490.  Defendants negligently trained and supervised, or negligently failed to train \nand supervise such employees in their duties, and failed to implement policies. As \na direct result of these failures, such employees were incompetent to perform their \nduties. \n491.  This negligent training, and negligent failure to train and supervise, and \nfailure to implement policies by Defendants resulted in the unconstitutional strip \nsearches of the Court Return Strip Search Named Plaintiffs  and the other members \nof the putative class. \n  103 \n\n492.

In failing to provide adequate funding for the Fulton County Jail to operate \nwithout violating the constitutional rights of the inmates, and specifically without \nviolating their right to be timely released from jail and not to be overdetained, \nDefendants displayed a conscious and knowing disregard for, and deliberate \nindifference towards, the constitutional rights of the Overdetention Named \nPlaintiffs and the class they represent. \n543.

Likewise, Plaintiffs' Motion for\nJudicial Notice [113-1], being unopposed, is GRANTED. See LR 7.1B, NDGa (\"Failure to file a response shall\nindicate that there is no opposition to the motion.\"). In accordance with its March 25, 2005 Order, moreover, the\nCourt continues to RESERVE RULING on County Defendants' Motion for Certification of Order for Interlocutory\nAppeal [77-1]. The Court addresses the remaining motions before it through the following Order.\nBackground\nPlaintiffs, certain former detainees at the Fulton County Jail (the \"Jail\"), initiated this putative class action on April\n21, 2004. In their Complaint, as presently amended, Plaintiffs assert claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 respecting\nthe conditions of their confinement at the Jail. They complain about being subject to \"blanket strip searches\" upon\nentering and/or returning to the Jail, as well as their continued detention past scheduled release dates (a\ncondition they refer to as \"over-detention\").\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs allege that they and others similarly situated were held at the Fulton County Jail for a\nnumber of days after they had served misdemeanor sentences, posted bond, or had been ordered released by a\nFulton County Court. In some instances, the periods of over-detention allegedly suffered by members of the\nputative class lasted almost two weeks.\nIn addition, Plaintiffs assert that the Jail maintained a policy of \"strip searching\" all inmates without an\nindividualized determination that such searches would reveal weapons, drugs, or other contraband. According to\nPlaintiffs, such searches were part of the process in which arrestees were \"booked\" into the Jail's general\npopulation. It involved an arrested individual being placed in a room with up to thirty or forty other arrestees,\nasked to remove his clothing, and instructed to place the clothing in a box. As a group, the arrestees were\nrequired to shower, and then, standing in a line with others, were visually inspected front and back by deputies.\nFurther, due to the Jail's practice of incorporating booking procedures into the release process, at least some of\nthese searches were allegedly conducted on persons who were returning from court proceedings and who were\nentitled to be released from the facility.\n1344 *1344 Plaintiffs allege that these practices at the Fulton County Jail were pervasive and had persisted for many\nyears. Moreover, they assert that through media coverage and published judicial decisions, the unconstitutional\ntreatment of inmates at the Jail had grown notorious, such that the government actors who placed arrestees into\nthe Jail's custody were aware of these alleged practices.\nPlaintiffs assert that the foregoing practices violate rights guaranteed them under the Fourth, Eighth, and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and predict that the persons falling within the\nproposed classes denominated in their pleadings will number 10,000 or more. As a result of exposure to such\nconditions, Plaintiffs seek monetary and injunctive relief against former Fulton County Sheriff Jacqueline Barrett,\nFulton County Sheriff Myron Freeman, Fulton County, the members of the Fulton County Board of\nCommissioners, and the City of Atlanta.\nOn January 13, 2005, this Court entered an Order that, inter alia, denied two motions to dismiss that had been\nfiled by the County Defendants and the City of Atlanta. In doing so, the Court recognized that in order to be held\nliable under § 1983, a municipal body must have had control over the policy that is alleged to have violated the\nplaintiff's rights. Moreover, it rejected Plaintiffs' assertion that either the City of Atlanta or the County Defendants\nexercised sufficient control over the over-detention and strip search practices in question to be held liable under\napplicable precedent. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs had stated a claim against these\nDefendants insofar as they alleged that Fulton County and the City of Atlanta, through their respective police\nforces, maintained a policy of entrusting arrestees to the Fulton County Jail with knowledge of the\nunconstitutional treatment these persons would face at the facility 00 a theory that will be referred to herein as that\n97\nof \"entrustment liability.\"\nThereafter, the Court permitted Plaintiffs to file a Fourth Amended Complaint. Defendants, including former\nSheriff Jacqueline Barrett and Sheriff Myron Freeman, have now filed a second round of motions to dismiss. In\naddition, they request a stay of discovery. For their part, Plaintiffs, in their opposition papers, appear to request\n\nreconsideration of the Court's Order insofar as it declined to read a so-called \"Jail Local Constitutional\nAmendment\" as making the Fulton County Sheriff an officer of Fulton County in his capacity as administrator of\nthe Jail.\nDiscussion\nI. Defendants' Motions to Dismiss\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) empowers the Court to grant a defendant's motion to dismiss when a\ncomplaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In considering whether to grant or deny such a\nmotion, the Court looks only to the pleadings, accepting all facts pleaded therein as true, and drawing all\ninferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12\nL.Ed.2d 1030 (1964); Conner v. Tate, 130 F.Supp.2d 1370, 1373 (N.D.Ga.2001). The motion may be granted only\nwhere \"it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would\nentitle him to relief.\" Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957); see Linder v.\n1345 Portocarrero, 963 F.2d 332 (11th Cir.1992). Motions to dismiss are disfavored and are *1345 rarely granted. \nGasper v. La. Stadium & Exposition Dist., 577 F.2d 897, 900 (5th Cir.1978); Woodham v. Fed. Transit Admin., 125\nF.Supp.2d 1106, 1108 (N.D.Ga.2000).\nHere, Defendants' motions to dismiss present four broad issues. First, the Sheriffs' motion requires resolution of\nwhether the claims against them are viable under the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of qualified\nimmunity. Next, both the City of Atlanta and the County Defendants request that the Court reconsider and/or\nclarify the entrustment liability theory it articulated in its January 13, 2005 Order. Third, the County Defendants\nask the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs' revised \"funding-based\" theory of liability. Finally, the County Defendants insist\nthat Plaintiffs lack Article III standing to bring claims for prospective injunctive relief.\nA. Liability of Sheriffs Barrett and Freeman\nSheriff Myron Freeman argues that the Eleventh Amendment bars suit against him in his official capacity\nbecause, in the administration of the Fulton County Jail, he is acting as an \"arm of the State.\" Both he and former\nSheriff Jacqueline Barrett, moreover, claim that they cannot be held liable in their individual capacities for the\nchallenged Jail practices under the doctrine of qualified immunity. For the reasons set forth below, the Sheriffs'\nmotion is granted in part and denied in part.\n1. Eleventh Amendment Immunity\nIt is well-settled that the Eleventh Amendment precludes a prisoner from seeking monetary damages against an\nofficer of the state in his or her official capacity. See Miller v. King, 384 F.3d 1248, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2004); see\nalso Edwards v. Wallace Cmty. Coll., 49 F.3d 1517, 1524 (11th Cir.1995) (\"A state, a state agency, and a state\nofficial sued in his official capacity are not `persons' within the meaning of § 1983, thus damages are unavailable\n[.]\"). At the same time, § 1983 contemplates, and the Eleventh Amendment does not foreclose, an action against\na state official in his official capacity where the plaintiff seeks only prospective, injunctive relief. Miller, 384 F.3d at\n1260.\nThe parties debate the impact of these principles on the instant litigation. Plaintiffs contend that Sheriff Freeman,\nin applying the challenged Jail policies, acts as the instrument of the County, not the State, and that the Eleventh\nAmendment bar is consequently inapplicable. The Count finds this attempt to avoid the preclusive effect of the\nEleventh Amendment unavailing in light of Grech v. Clayton County, 335 F.3d 1326 (11th Cir.2003), and Manders\nv. Lee, 338 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir.2003), as well as the Eleventh Circuit's more recent decision in Purcell ex rel.\nEstate of Morgan v. Toombs County, 400 F.3d 1313 (11th Cir.2005), where it held:\n[In Manders,] we decided that a sheriff's \"authority and duty to administer the jail in his jurisdiction flows from the\nState, not [the] County.\" [Cit.] Thus Manders controls our determination here; [the sheriff] functions as an arm of\nthe State 00 not [the] County 00 when promulgating policies and procedures governing conditions of confinement\n97 97\nat the [] County Jail. Accordingly, even if [the plaintiff] had established a constitutional violation, [the sheriff] would\nbe entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in his official capacity.\n\n400 F.3d at 1325.\n1346 Accordingly, insofar as Defendants seek a determination that the Eleventh Amendment *1346 bars suit for money\ndamages against the Sheriff in his official capacity, their motion is granted. This conclusion does not, however,\nforeclose Plaintiffs from seeking prospective, injunctive relief against the Sheriff.\n2. Qualified Immunity\nA considerably more difficult question is presented, however, by the Sheriffs' attempted invocation of qualified\nimmunity. As the Eleventh Circuit explained in Vinyard v. Wilson, 311 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2002), \"[q]ualified\nimmunity offers complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities if their conduct\n`does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.'\" 311 F.3d at 1346 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396\n(1982)). \"The purpose of this immunity is to allow government officials to carry out their discretionary duties\nwithout the fear of personal liability or harassing litigation, protecting from suit all but the plainly incompetent or\none who is knowingly violating the federal law.\" Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188, 1194 (11th Cir.2002) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\nHere, the parties dispute whether the rights Defendants are alleged to have violated were \"clearly established\" at\n[3]\nthe time the purported violations took place.  A constitutional right is clearly established \"only if its contours are\n`sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand what he is doing violates that right.'\" Vaughan v.\nCox, 316 F.3d 1210, 1212 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97\nL.Ed.2d 523 (1987)). The salient question is whether the state of the law at the time of the alleged violation gave\nofficials \"fair warning\" that their acts were unconstitutional. Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 740, 122 S.Ct. 2508,\n153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002); Holmes v. Kucynda, 321 F.3d 1069, 1078 (11th Cir.2003); see also Vinyard, 311 F.3d at\n1350-53 (articulating a tripartite analytical framework for ascertaining whether right at issue was \"clearly\nestablished\").\nIn answering this question, the Eleventh Circuit has instructed district courts to look to its decisions, those of the\nUnited States Supreme Court, and those of the highest court in the relevant state. Marsh v. Butler County, 268\nF.3d 1014, 1033 n. 10 (11th Cir.2001); but cf. Grayden v. Rhodes, 345 F.3d 1225, 1251 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003)\n(recognizing that decisions by the United States Supreme Court have suggested that looking to decisions of other\nCircuits is appropriate in qualified immunity analysis) (Birch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nQualified immunity is a question of law for the court. Post v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 7 F.3d 1552, 1557 (11th\nCir.1993).\n1347 *1347 a. Strip Search Policy\nPlaintiffs contend that, at all times relevant to this litigation, their right to be free from a blanket strip search policy\nwas clearly established. In support of this position, they rely principally on the Supreme Court's decision in Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), and the decision of the Eleventh Circuit in Wilson v.\nJones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2001). Given the importance of precedent in determining whether a right is\nsufficiently \"clear\" to warrant the denial of qualified immunity, and in light of the dynamic nature of the law as it\nrelates to inmate strip searches, the Court examines these and other pertinent decisions in some detail below.\nIn Bell, the Supreme Court was called upon to examine the constitutionality of certain jail policies affecting pretrial\ndetainees, including a policy requiring such persons \"to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part\nof a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution.\" 441 U.S. at 558,\n99 S.Ct. 1861. The defendants argued that such searches were justified, without probable cause, both to\ndiscover and to deter attempts to smuggle contraband into the general population. Id. Upholding the practice\nunder constitutional attack, the Court explained that the Fourth Amendment requires courts to balance the need\nfor a given search against the invasion of personal rights the search entails, considering \"the scope of the\nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Addressing the case before it, it concluded:\n\nWe do not underestimate the degree to which these searches may invade the personal privacy of inmates. Nor\ndo we doubt, as the District Court noted, that on occasion a security guard may conduct the search in an abusive\nfashion. [Cit.] Such an abuse cannot be condoned. The searches must be conducted in a reasonable manner.\n[Cit.] But we deal here with the question whether visual body-cavity inspections as contemplated by the MCC\nrules can ever be conducted on less than probable cause. Balancing the significant and legitimate security\ninterests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates, we conclude that they can.\nId. at 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (emphasis in original).\nMore than twenty years later, in Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2001), the Eleventh Circuit applied the \nBell analysis to a case involving a strip search of a woman arrested for driving under the influence. The plaintiff in\nWilson, before being taken to her cell, was escorted to a restroom in the jail by a female corrections officer and\n\"instructed ... to disrobe completely, face the wall, squat, spread her buttocks, and cough three times.\" 251 F.3d\nat 1341. In addition, while no body cavity search was performed below the Wilson plaintiff's waist, the corrections\nofficer examined the woman's \"ears, mouth, nose and breasts during the search.\" Id.\nRelying on Bell, the Circuit, employing a fact-specific balancing test, determined that the Jail's policy was\nunconstitutional because it had been conducted in the absence of a \"reasonable suspicion that [the plaintiff] was\nconcealing weapons or any other type of contraband.\" Id. at 1343. Nevertheless, it declined to deny the\ndefendants qualified immunity, recognizing material dissimilarities between the facts before it and those reflected\n1348 in binding *1348 precedent. Id. at 1344-46.[4]\nTwo years after Wilson, the Eleventh Circuit once again had the opportunity to review the constitutionality of a\nstrip search performed on pretrial arrestees. In Evans v. City of Zebulon, 351 F.3d 485 (11th Cir.2003)\n(hereinafter, \"Evans I\"), two young men were arrested while driving through the city of Zebulon, Georgia; one for\nspeeding and refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test, the other based on mistaken identity and the resultant\nbelief he had violated parole. 351 F.3d at 487-88. Upon arriving at the county jail, the two men were subjected to\nstrip searches which involved an examination and prodding of their anus and genitals with a slender black object.\nId. at 488-89.\nAddressing the constitutionality of the search, the Eleventh Circuit explained, \"Arrestees who are to be detained\nin the general jail population can constitutionality be subjected to a strip search only if the search is supported by\nreasonable suspicion that such a search will reveal weapons or contraband.\" Id. at 490. Because the Court found\nsuch a reasonable suspicion lacking, it held that the plaintiffs' constitutional rights had been violated. Id. at\n490-92. Nevertheless, it granted the officer involved in the search qualified immunity. Id. at 495-96.\nShortly after the Evans I panel issued its decision, the Circuit voted to vacate the opinion and rehear the appeal \nen banc. Evans v. City of Zebulon, 364 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.2004). On rehearing, the Court of Appeals likewise\nfound certain characteristics of the search unconstitutional, but concluded that the officer was not entitled to\nqualified immunity with respect to the allegedly abusive manner in which the search was conducted. See Evans\nv. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir.2005) (en banc) (hereinafter, \"Evans II\"). The most important aspect of the \nEvans II decision for purposes here, however, was not this result, but rather the following language in which the\nCircuit questioned the \"standard\" initially articulated by the panel in Evans I:\nThe panel opinion in this case included these words: \"Arrestees who are to be detained in the general jail\npopulation can constitutionally be subjected to a strip search only if the search is supported by reasonable\nsuspicion that such a search will reveal weapons or contraband.\" [Cit.] And these words doubtlessly contributed\nto causing some judges to vote for en banc rehearing.\nMost of us are uncertain that jailers are required to have a reasonable suspicion of weapons or contraband\nbefore strip searching 00 for security and safety purposes 00 arrestees bound for the general jail population.\n97 97\n407 F.3d at 1278. The Circuit went on to observe that the Supreme Court had never imposed such a \"reasonable\nsuspicion\" prerequisite on inmate strip searches, but stopped short of resolving the accuracy of the panel's earlier\nstatement. Rather, it explained that the case before it \"involve[d] a different kind of search altogether: a post-\narrest investigatory strip search by the police looking for evidence (and not weapons).\" Id. at 1279.\n1349\n\n*1349 In a concurring opinion, Judge Carnes, joined by Judge Dubina and Judge Hull, went further and\nexpressed his \"view is that reasonable suspicion is not necessary for a strip search of an arrestee who is to be\ndetained in the general jail population, if that search is conducted pursuant to a generally applicable, reasonable\njail policy designed to promote safety and security by guarding against the smuggling of weapons and other\ncontraband into a detention facility.\" Id. at 1284 (Carnes, J., concurring; emphasis supplied). These Judges\nrecognized that \"a strong argument can be made\" that decisions holding to the contrary, including that authored\nby the panel in Wilson v. Jones, were \"wrong,\" and were predicated on a misinterpretation of Bell. Id. at 1285.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Court's task here is to determine whether the \"strip search\" policy allegedly in place\nat the Fulton County Jail violated clearly established rights of detainees at the time the searches were purportedly\nperformed (i.e., in 2003 and 2004). Needless to say, the broad pronouncements in Wilson and Evans I,\ncontrasted with the en banc Court's election to vacate Evans I and subsequent reluctance in Evans II to impose a\n\"reasonable suspicion\" precondition on strip searches of arrestees bound for the general population, introduces a\nnovel and awkward wrinkle into this determination. After carefully considering the issue, however, the Court is\ninclined to agree with Sheriffs Barrett and Freeman that they are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the\nchallenged searches.\nAs the en banc Court of Appeals emphasized in Evans II, the Supreme Court has never expressly held that,\nbefore conducting a strip search of detainees bound for the general jail population, a jailer must possess a\nreasonable suspicion of the concealment of weapons or other contraband. See Evans II, 407 F.3d at 1279.\nMoreover, in Evans II, a majority of the Court of Appeals indicated its uncertainty regarding whether such a\nsuspicion must precede any constitutional strip search. Id. at 1278. Admittedly, that opinion was issued after the\nchallenged strip searches involved in this litigation allegedly took place. But if the majority of the Eleventh Circuit\ncontinues to perceive room to debate the contours of this constitutional right, it seems to this Court that no state\nofficial could justifiably be charged with having \"fair warning\" that conducting a strip search absent a reasonable\nsuspicion of contraband violates the law. See Hope, 536 U.S. at 740, 122 S.Ct. 2508. Put another way, this Court\ncannot characterize a state official's doubt in the existence of a constitutional rule \"unreasonable\" if his\nuncertainty is shared by a majority of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Vaughan, 316 F.3d at 1212 (11th\nCir.2003) (a right is clearly established \"only if its contours are `sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would\nunderstand what he is doing violates that right.'\") (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct.\n3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)).\nIn making this determination, the Court is aware that certain language in Wilson could be read as supporting a\ndifferent result. See251 F.3d at 1343 (\"Because Wilson was strip searched absent reasonable suspicion, we hold\nthat the search of Wilson, as well as the jail's policy authorizing her search, violated the Fourth Amendment\nprohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.\") (emphasis supplied). Nevertheless, a thorough\nreading of the Wilson opinion underscores that the constitutionality of any challenged strip search hinges on a\n1350 fact-intensive inquiry *1350 00 one in which a court is required to \"consider the scope of the particular intrusion,\n97\nthe manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Id. at\n1342 (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).). That being the case,\nany \"lesson\" to be taken from Wilson cannot be divorced from the facts of that case, including the invasiveness of\nthe search at issue there.\nThus, this Court finds it relevant that, in Wilson, the plaintiff had her breasts examined, and was required to\n\"squat, spread her buttocks, and cough....\" See251 F.3d at 1341. Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs' pleading describes\na markedly less invasive examination. Plaintiffs were simply required to submit to a visual \"front and back\"\ninspection upon leaving a shower. It is the view of this Court that such a pronounced dissimilarity between the\nintrusiveness of the searches at issue here in and Wilson could lead a reasonable official to believe one search is\n[5]\nconstitutional, while the other is not.\nInsofar as Sheriffs Barrett and Freeman seek qualified immunity on Plaintiffs'\"strip search\" claims, their motion to\n[6]\ndismiss is granted.\nb. Over-Detention\n\nSheriffs Barrett and Freeman likewise seek to invoke qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' \"over-detention\" claims.\n1351 They argue that case law within this Circuit does not establish a concrete deadline by which an *1351 arrestee\nwho is entitled to be released (e.g., because he has posted bond, served his misdemeanor sentence, or been\nordered released by a court) must be permitted to leave the jail. In the absence of such an indelible, \"bright line\"\nstandard, the Sheriffs argue their obligation to release inmates in a timely fashion cannot be described as \"clearly\nestablished.\" The Court disagrees.\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Hope v. Pelzer, the fundamental question in the qualified immunity analysis is\nwhether the state of the law provided an official with \"fair warning\" that his treatment of the plaintiff ran afoul of\nthe Constitution. See Hope, 536 U.S. at 740, 122 S.Ct. 2508. While materially similar precedent or \"broad\nstatements of principle\" can unquestionably establish a right with sufficient clarity to deny an officer qualified\nimmunity, they are not in all instances required to provide officials with the requisite notice. See Vinyard, 311 F.3d\nat 1350-52. Rather, in some cases, \"the words of a federal statute or federal constitutional provision may be so\nclear and the conduct so bad that case law is not needed to establish that the conduct cannot be lawful.\" Id. at\n1350. To borrow language from a slightly different context, there are some instances where the conduct in\nquestion goes so far beyond the \"hazy border\" of constitutionally permissible behavior that an official should be\ndenied qualified immunity even absent materially similar precedent. See id at 1350 n. 18.\nAs it relates to the instant case, there can be no doubt that a detainee has a \"constitutional right to be free from\ncontinued detention after it was or should have been known that [he] was entitled to release....\" See Cannon v.\nMacon County, 1 F.3d 1558, 1563 (11th Cir.1993),modified,15 F.3d 1022 (1994); see also Whirl v. Kern, 407\nF.2d 781, 791 (5th Cir.1968) (\"There is no privilege in a jailer to keep a prisoner in jail beyond the period of his\n[7]\nlawful sentence.\").  While the Constitution does not mandate instantaneous release, it does require that a\ndetainee be released within a reasonable time after the basis for his lawful detainment has ended. See Whirl, 407\nF.2d at 792 (\"The sheriff, of course, must have some protection too. His duty to his prisoner is not breached until\nthe expiration of a reasonable time for the proper ascertainment of the authority upon which his prisoner is\ndetained.\"); Lewis v. O'Grady, 853 F.2d 1366, 1370 (7th Cir.1988) (\"We recognize that the administrative tasks\nincident to a release of a prisoner from custody may require some time to accomplish 00 in this case perhaps a\n97\nnumber of hours.\"); see also County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 55, 111 S.Ct. 1661, 114 L.Ed.2d 49\n(1991) (Fourth Amendment required that persons arrested without warrant be given prompt judicial\ndeterminations of probable cause; establishing forty-eight hour standard to assess reasonableness of delay in\n[8]\nlight of inevitable administrative hurdles).\n1352 Plainly, within a given range, what is \"reasonable\" as it relates to a particular *1352 individual's release presents\na fact-specific question. See, e.g., Berry v. Baca, 379 F.3d 764, 770-72 (9th Cir.2004) (rejecting county sheriff's\nargument that release delays lasting up to forty-eight hours are presumptively reasonable; held twenty-nine hour\ndelay presented question for jury); Lewis, 853 F.2d at 1370 (recognizing that \"[i]t is virtually impossible to\nestablish an absolute minimum time to meet all potential circumstances which might exist\" in the context of\ninmate release; holding eleven-hour delay presented question for the jury); Arline v. City of Jacksonville, 359\nF.Supp.2d 1300, 1310 (M.D.Fla.2005) (two and a half hour detention following acquittal presented jury question\nunder Fourth Amendment). Equally as plain is that there are circumstances in which a lengthy delay is per se\nunreasonable, and necessarily runs afoul of the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., Douthit v. Jones, 619 F.2d 527,\n532 (5th Cir.1980) (\"Detention of a prisoner thirty days beyond the expiration of his sentence in the absence of a\nfacially valid court order or warrant constitutes a deprivation of due process.\").\nHere, Plaintiffs claim to have been over-detained for durations ranging from one to ten days, with a mean over-\n[9]\ndetention period of 3.90 days.  (See Fourth Am. Compl. ¶¶ 328, 334, 340, 345, 351, 357, 363, 369, 375, 381 &\n387.) In describing an \"illustrative case,\" moreover, Plaintiffs allege that Plaintiff Alan Powell was told by guards\nthat if he continued to complain about his over-detention, they might \"lose\" his paperwork 00 presumably\n97\nintimating that a problem arrestee could be detained for longer periods of time for reasons totally unrelated to the\nadministrative process incident to effectuating releases. (Fourth Am. Compl. ¶ 242.) It is the view of this Court\nthat such allegations, if proven, might preclude the Sheriff's invocation of qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' \"over-\ndetention\" claims.\n\nIn what has been recognized as a \"clearly analogous\" line of authority, the Supreme Court has established a\npresumptive deadline of forty-eight hours for persons arrested without a warrant to be taken before a judge for a\nprobable cause hearing. See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 55, 111 S.Ct. 1661, 114 L.Ed.2d\n49 (1991); see also Lewis, 853 F.2d at 1370 (recognizing that circumstances presented in case involving \"over-\ndetention\" of inmate and McLaughlin were \"clearly analogous\"). An arrestee who is provided a hearing within that\ntime period can prevail on a constitutional challenge only if he demonstrates the hearing was nonetheless\n1353 \"delayed unreasonably.\" McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 56, *1353 111 S.Ct. 1661. Among the delays that may be\nconsidered unreasonable are those \"motivated by ill will against the arrested individual, or delay for delay's sake.\"\nId. Conversely, \"[w]here an arrested individual does not receive a probable cause determination within 48\nhours..., the burden shifts to the government to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide emergency or other\nextraordinary circumstance.\" Id. at 57, 111 S.Ct. 1661. In cases arising after McLaughlin, moreover, courts have\nrecognized that an official may be denied qualified immunity where arrestees under his supervision was not given\na probable cause determinations within forty-eight hours of arrest and no emergency or extraordinary\ncircumstances justified the delay. See, e.g., Cherrington v. Skeeter, 344 F.3d 631, 643-44 (6th Cir.2003)\n(reversing summary judgment in favor of defendants on grounds of qualified immunity where arrestee held for\nseventy-two hours without probable cause determination and no emergency or extraordinary circumstances\njustified delay); Lingenfelter v. Bd. of County Comm'rs of Reno County, 359 F.Supp.2d 1163, 1173 (D.Kan.2005)\n(denying sheriff's motion to dismiss on grounds of qualified immunity where inmate was held eight days without\njudicial probable cause determination).\nOf course, the issue presented in McLaughlin is not in all respects identical to that presented here. See Berry,\n379 F.3d at 771 (observing that, \"while the two contexts share the same concerns about the need for flexibility in\nthe face of inevitable administrative and logistical delays,\" issues of over-detention and detainment pending\nprobable cause determination \"may not share the same precise calculus\"). Nevertheless, in circumstances where\na detainee is unquestionably entitled to be free from further governmental restraint, it cannot be doubted that the\npublic interest in his prompt release is even greater, and the constitutional tolerance for \"administrative delay\"\nsubstantially less, than in the context of arrestees awaiting probable cause determinations. See Berry, 379 F.3d\nat 771-72 (declining to adopt McLaughlin's presumption that forty-eight hour detention is constitutional in context\nof over-detentions, explaining that, in over-detention context, \"the societal interest in the process that result in\ndelay, while significant, may not be as weighty as in the probable cause context [,]\" and that, \"the administrative\nburden of accelerating the release process 00 in particular, running a computer check on wants and holds within\n97\nless than forty-eight hours 00 does not seem as weighty as the burden of establishing probable cause under a\n97\ntight timeline\"); Brass v. County of Los Angeles, 328 F.3d 1192, 1202 (9th Cir.2003) (\"It is unclear, however,\nwhether the 48-hour period applied to probable cause determinations is appropriate for effectuating the release of\nprisoners whose basis for confinement has ended. One might conclude that when a court orders a prisoner\nreleased 00 or when, for example, a prisoner's sentence has been completed 00 the outer bounds for releasing the\n97 97\n[10]\nprisoner should be less than 48 hours.\") (emphasis supplied).  It follows that an official who continues to hold\n1354 a detainee without legal *1354 justification for a period of time that would fail to pass muster even under \nMcLaughlin cannot be said to have lacked \"fair warning\" that his conduct violates the Constitution.\nHere, the allegations of the Complaint describe a lethargy in the Jail's release policies that could be said to exist\nwell beyond the \"hazy border\" of constitutionally acceptable delay. The Court has been unable to find any case,\nwhether within or outside of the Eleventh Circuit, in which the detainment of a properly identified individual for \ndays beyond his scheduled release date was held constitutionally permissible. And, read most favorably to\nPlaintiffs, the allegations of the Complaint suggest that the delays at issue here may have in some instances\nbeen the product of more than a mere lack of organization, but rather, indicative of a custom of purposeful\nindifference to the rights of detainees 00 \"motivated by ill will against the arrested individual, or delay for delay's\n97\nsake.\" McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 56, 111 S.Ct. 1661. Accordingly, based on the arguments and record currently\nbefore the Court, dismissal of Plaintiffs' over-detention claims on qualified immunity grounds would be improper.\nB. Entrustment Liability\n\nThe County Defendants and the City of Atlanta also move the Court to reconsider, or, in the alternative, to clarify\n[11]\nits January 13, 2005 holding regarding \"entrustment liability.\"  The Court addresses the requests for\nreconsideration and clarification separately.\n1. Reconsideration\nUnder the Local Rules of this Court, \"[m]otions for reconsideration shall not be filed as a matter of routine\npractice.\" LR 7.2(E), NDGa. Consequently, motions for reconsideration are not to be submitted as a matter of\ncourse, but only when \"absolutely necessary.\" Id. Such absolute necessity arises where there is \"(1) newly\ndiscovered evidence; (2) an intervening development or change in controlling law; or (3) a need to correct a clear\nerror of law or fact.\" Bryan v. Murphy, 246 F.Supp.2d 1256, 1258-59 (N.D.Ga.2003).\nConversely, motions for reconsideration may not be used as a vehicle to present the court with arguments which\nhave already been raised and rejected, or to \"repackage familiar arguments to test whether the court will change\nits mind.\" Bryan, 246 F.Supp.2d at 1259. Likewise, such motions \"may not be used to offer new legal theories or\nevidence that could have been presented in conjunction with the previously filed motion or response, unless a\nreason is given for failing to raise the issue at an earlier stage in the litigation.\" Adler v. Wallace Computer Servs.,\nInc., 202 F.R.D. 666, 675 (N.D.Ga.2001).\n1355 Here, Defendants' arguments in support of reconsideration do not fall within *1355 the limited range of objections\nthat may appropriately be raised in such a motion. Further, the Court remains of the view that a municipal body\nthat maintains a policy of entrusting its arrestees to a jail with knowledge of the unconstitutional treatment those\npersons will face upon their confinement there can be liable under § 1983. See Young v. City of Little Rock, 249\nF.3d 730, 735 (8th Cir.2001) (holding that city that entrusted its arrestees to county with knowledge of\nunconstitutional practice at issue could be held liable under § 1983 for injury arising out of arrestee's exposure to\nthe practice); Deaton v. Montgomery County, 989 F.2d 885, 889-90 (6th Cir.1993) (in declining to hold county\nliable under § 1983 for city's unconstitutional practices in treatment of arrestees, emphasized that \"[t]here are no\nfacts presented indicating that the sheriff knew or should have known that strip searches were conducted in\nviolation of state law\"); cf. also Warren v. D.C., 353 F.3d 36, 39 (D.C.Cir.2004) (holding that District of Columbia\ncould be liable § 1983 for entrusting inmate to private prison with \"actual or constructive knowledge that its\nagents will probably violate constitutional rights\"); Baker v. D.C., 326 F.3d 1302, 1306-07 (D.C.Cir.2003) (holding\nlikewise). The motions for reconsideration are denied.\n2. Clarification\nThe County Defendants additionally request that this Court clarify its January 13, 2005 holding as it relates to the\nshowing necessary to prevail on a theory of entrustment liability. In particular, they ask whether the \"knowledge\" a\nmunicipality must have to be liable under § 1983 is limited to the facts giving rise to the constitutional violation, or\nwhether it additionally must be chargeable with knowledge of the unconstitutionality of the challenged practice.\nThey assert that if the latter is required, then the legal landscape at the time the events in question took place\nhere did not provide them with the requisite notice (a concept they insist must be construed akin to the \"clearly\nestablished\" test for qualified immunity) to sustain their liability under an entrustment-based theory.\nThis Court is inclined to agree with the County Defendants that knowledge 00 either actual or constructive-of the\n97\nunconstitutionality of a challenged practice employed by a recipient government actor must exist before § 1983\nliability may attach. See Bd. of County Comm'rs of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 405, 117 S.Ct. 1382,\n137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997) (\"Where a plaintiff claims that the municipality has not directly inflicted an injury, but\nnonetheless has caused [another] to do so, rigorous standards of culpability and causation must be applied to\nensure that the municipality is not held liable solely for the actions of [others].\"); cf. also id. at 411, 117 S.Ct. 1382\n(\"A plaintiff must demonstrate that a municipal decision reflects deliberate indifference to the risk that a violation\nof a particular constitutional or statutory right will follow the decision.\"); City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378,\n396, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989) (\"Where a § 1983 plaintiff can establish that the facts available to\ncity policymakers put them on actual or constructive notice that the particular omission is substantially certain to\nresult in the violation of the constitutional rights of their citizens, the dictates of Monell are satisfied.\") (O'Connor,\n\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Warren, 353 F.3d at 39 (\"[F]aced with actual or construction\nknowledge that its agents will probably violate constitutional rights, the city may not adopt a policy of inaction.\").\n1356 *1356 At the same time, however, the Court cannot agree with the County Defendants that Plaintiffs have failed\nto state a claim for relief when this \"legal knowledge\" requirement is incorporated into the entrustment liability\ntest. Read in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Fourth Amended Complaint contains allegations that the\nCounty Defendants had actual knowledge that the challenged practices at the Fulton County Jail were\nunconstitutional. (See, e.g., Fourth Am. Compl. ¶ 232.) Were these allegations proven, then the County\n[12]\nDefendants have directed the Court to no authority that would permit them to avoid § 1983 liability.\nC. Plaintiffs' Revised Funding-Based Theory of Liability\nIn their Fourth Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs renew their attempt to impose § 1983 liability on Fulton County\nbased on the County's control over the Fulton County Sheriff's budget, this time infusing their allegations with\naccusations of deliberate indifference. The Court finds this theory foreclosed by Eleventh Circuit precedent.\nAs explained in this Court January 2005 Order, the Eleventh Circuit, after a thorough examination of the\nrelationship between the State of Georgia, its counties, and its sheriffs, flatly rejected the argument that a\ncounty's authority over a sheriff's budget can justify imposing liability on the county as a consequence of policies\nadopted by the sheriff. See Manders, 338 F.3d at 1323-24; see also Grech, 335 F.3d at 1339-40. Although it\nrecognized a different result might be appropriate where a county's own duty to provide medical care to inmates\nwas at issue, the provision of such care is not implicated by Plaintiffs' claims in this case. See Manders, 338 F.3d\nat 1323 n. 43 (\"We stress that this case does not involve medical care, which counties have a statutory obligation\nto provide to inmates in county jails.\") (citing O.C.G.A. § 42-5-2); compare McDowell v. Brown, 392 F.3d 1283\n(11th Cir.2004) (considering deliberate indifference challenge to Georgia county's alleged under-funding of jail\nthat was asserted to have resulted in its health services subcontractor's failure to treat inmate's medical\ncondition). Consequently, the Court finds Plaintiffs' revised funding-based theory of liability unavailing. Count 16\nof Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint is dismissed.\nD. Plaintiffs' Standing to Pursue Injunctive Relief\nFinally, the County Defendants challenge Plaintiffs' standing to pursue equitable relief in this case.\nIt goes without saying that those who seek to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts must satisfy the\nthreshold requirement imposed by Article III of the Constitution by alleging an actual case or controversy. [Cits.]\nPlaintiffs must demonstrate a \"personal stake in the outcome\" in order to \"assure that concrete adverseness\n1357 which sharpens the presentation of issues\" necessary for *1357 the proper resolution of constitutional questions.\n[Cit.] Abstract injury is not enough. The plaintiff must show that he \"has sustained or is immediately in danger of\nsustaining some direct injury\" as the result of the challenged official conduct and the injury or threat of injury must\nbe both \"real and immediate,\" not \"conjectural\" or \"hypothetical.\"\nCity of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-102, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1665, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). Where\ninjunctive relief is at issue, moreover, \"to have standing ... a plaintiff must show a sufficient likelihood that he will\nbe affected by the allegedly unlawful conduct in the future.\" Wooden v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga.,\n247 F.3d 1262, 1283 (11th Cir.2001). \"Although past wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real and\nimmediate threat of repeated injury ..., past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or\ncontroversy regarding injunctive relief if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.\" Id. at 1284\n(internal punctuation omitted).\nThese principles often prove problematic for former detainees seeking to enjoin conditions attendant to their\narrest and confinement. See, e.g., O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 497, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974)\n(equitable standing lacking where \"the prospect of future injury rests on the likelihood that respondents will again\nbe arrested for and charged with violations of the criminal law and will again be subjected to bond proceedings,\ntrial, or sentencing before petitioners\"); cf. also Lyons, 461 U.S. at 109, 103 S.Ct. 1660 (explaining that it was \"no\nmore than speculation\" that plaintiff would once again be arrested and subjected to allegedly unlawful\nchokehold); Dudley v. Stewart, 724 F.2d 1493, 1494 (11th Cir.1984) (\"Since Dudley is no longer in the custody of\n\ncounty jail officials, the most that can be said for his standing is that if he is released from prison, is convicted of\nanother crime and is incarcerated in the Daugherty County Jail, he might again be subject to disciplinary\nconfinement without due process.\"). Indeed, the Supreme Court has appeared singularly unwilling, \"for purposes\nof assessing the likelihood that state authorities will reinflict a given injury ... to assume that the party seeking\nrelief will repeat the type of misconduct that would once again place him or her at risk of that injury.\" Honig v.\nDoe, 484 U.S. 305, 320, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988) (collecting cases).\nWhile acknowledging that most of their ranks had been released at the time the complaint in this case was filed,\nPlaintiffs attempt to avoid this standing obstacle here by focusing on three of the eleven named Plaintiffs. First,\nthey concentrate on the claims of Mr. Powell and Mr. Blake, explaining that both men have been arrested by\nFulton County Police since the original complaint was filed in April 2004: Mr. Blake once, and Mr. Powell three\ntimes. They urge that these arrests (as well as the fact that Mr. Powell remains out on bond, and that Mr. Blake is\non probation) show a substantial likelihood that these men will again be detained at the Fulton County Jail and\nwill again face allegedly unconstitutional conditions of confinement.\nAdmittedly, there exists some language in Supreme Court precedent intimating that a plaintiff who, prior to filing\nhis complaint, has multiple \"run-ins\" with police might be able to show a sufficient likelihood of future police\n1358 encounters to be able to pursue injunctive relief against an unconstitutional law enforcement practice. *1358See \nLyons, 461 U.S. at 108, 103 S.Ct. 1660 (\"We cannot agree that the `odds[]' ... that Lyons would not only again be\nstopped for a traffic violation but would also be subjected to a chokehold without any provocation whatsoever are\nsufficient to make out a federal case for equitable relief. We note that five months elapsed between October 6,\n1976, and the filing of the complaint, yet there was no allegation of further unfortunate encounters between Lyons\nand the police.\") (emphasis supplied). That said, Plaintiffs have directed the Court to no authority actually holding\nthat a civilian claimant's potential for recidivism was so high that it took his future arrest and detainment out of the\nrealm of the hypothetical, laying the foundation for equitable standing. Compare 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329\nF.3d 1255, 1266 (11th Cir.2003) (in suit by foster children challenging conditions of foster care system, held\nchildren who were in custody of system had standing, explaining, plaintiffs \"are in the custody of the defendants \ninvoluntarily ... [and t]hey cannot avoid exposure to the defendants' challenged conduct\"); Church v. City of\nHuntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, 1337-38 (11th Cir.1994) (explaining presumption that person will not engage in\nmisconduct placing him at risk of injury does not preclude standing \"when, for reasons beyond the plaintiff's\ncontrol, he or she is unable to avoid repeating the conduct that led to the original injury at the hands of the\ndefendant\"; citing as examples mental illness and homelessness) (emphasis supplied); Cruz v. Hauck, 627 F.2d\n710, 717 (5th Cir.1980) (prisoners' claim attacking unconstitutional jail policies was not moot for purposes of class\ncertification, even though they were not in jail at time of class certification decision, where they could easily be\ntransferred from prison back to jail). This Court declines to extend precedent to find such a foundation here. Next,\nPlaintiffs emphasize that Mr. Clemons was still in Fulton County Jail at the time the Second Amended Complaint\n00 which added him as a Plaintiff 00 was filed. Clearly, his case places him in a much stronger position to pursue\n97 97\ninjunctive relief in this litigation. See McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 51, 111 S.Ct. 1661 (holding former inmates had\nstanding to pursue injunctive claims against county where \"at the time the second amended complaint was filed,\nplaintiffs James, Simon, and Hyde had been arrested without warrants and were being held in custody without\nhaving received a probable cause determination\"); see also Wooden, 247 F.3d at 1285 n. 21 (distinguishing \nMcLaughlin from those cases in which unconstitutional treatment had ended by the time the pleading was filed,\nexplaining \"McLaughlin... concerned a situation where the plaintiffs were exposed to a continuing unconstitutional\nact 00 a protracted delay in affording them probable cause hearings 00 which was ongoing at the time of the\n97 97\ncomplaint\") (emphasis supplied). Mr. Clemons, however, was arrested by the City of Atlanta, not the Fulton\nCounty Police, and his standing to pursue injunctive relief against the County is therefore lacking. (See Jan. 13,\n2005 Order at 31 (\"while Fulton County may be liable for the arrestees placed in the Jail by its police department\n(over which it exerted control), it may not be subject to § 1983 liability for arrestees placed in the Jail by\" other\nmunicipal or state actors) (emphasis in original).)\nIn sum, Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue injunctive relief against the County Defendants. Insofar as the County\nDefendants seek to dismiss such requests for relief, their motion is granted.\nII. Plaintiffs' Request for Reconsideration\n\n1359 Plaintiffs, in their opposition to Defendants' motions to dismiss, attempt to rely *1359 on Abusaid v. Hillsborough\nCounty Board of County Commissioners, 405 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.2005), as \"intervening case law\" establishing\nthat a so-called Jail Local Constitutional Amendment renders the Fulton County Sheriff an officer of Fulton\nCounty in his capacity as administrator of the Jail. (See Jan. 13, 2005 Order at 20-23 (discussing, and rejecting,\nPlaintiffs' argument).) In Abusaid, the Eleventh Circuit held a Florida sheriff was acting as a county official in his\nenforcement of a county ordinance. 405 F.3d at 1304. Plaintiffs argue that, because the Sheriff was \"designated\"\nto control the Fulton County Jail pursuant to the amendment, a similar result is compelled here. The Court finds\nthis argument to lack merit.\nThe \"Jail Local Constitutional Amendment,\" as this Court's prior Order explained, provides as follows:\nThe governing authority of Fulton County is hereby authorized to maintain and operate facilities within or without\nthe boundaries of said County for the detention, incarceration or confinement of all persons (including juveniles)\nsubject to detention, incarceration or confinement under the laws of this State, under any County resolution or\nunder any City ordinance. Such facilities, whether designated as a jail, public works camp, or detention center,\nshall be under the control of such persons or official as may be designated by the governing authority of Fulton\nCounty, and need not be used exclusively for any one class of prisoner or person.\nH.R. 687-1585, 1972 Sess., at 1439 § 1 (Ga.1972), continued in effect in S. 503, 1986 Sess., at 4428 (Ga.1986); \nsee also Fulton County, Ga., Code § 1-122 (codifying same provision as part of Fulton County Code relating to\npowers of the Board of Commissioners). Plaintiffs argued that this provision of the Georgia Constitution and the\nFulton County Code gave the Fulton County Board power over the operation of the County Jail, bringing them\nwithin the ambit of municipal liability under § 1983.\nThe Court declined to accept this argument in its January 13, 2005 Order, observing that it reflected a\nmisconstruction of the cited amendment. Specifically, it pointed out that nothing in the amendment or the Fulton\nCounty Code reflected the Board's exercise of any power to erect a separate detention facility, or to affirmatively\n\"designate\" any person to operate such a facility. It rejected, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs' argument that mere\ninaction by the Fulton County Board of Commissioners had implicitly resulted in its adoption of the Fulton County\nJail as its \"own,\" and that the Board's failure to designate someone other than the Sheriff to operate the facility\ntacitly resulted in its \"designation\" of the person holding that office to so control the institution. The Court\nstruggles to see how Abusaid in any way cures this basic legal flaw in Plaintiffs' argument. Their request for\nreconsideration is denied.\nIII. Defendants' Motions to Stay Discovery\nIn their motions to stay discovery, Defendants request a stay during the pendency of their motions to dismiss.\nThose motions now having been resolved, County Defendants' Motion to Stay Discovery [92-1] and Defendants\nBarrett and Freeman's Motion to Stay Discovery [93-1] are DENIED as moot.\nConclusion\n1360 Plaintiffs' Consent Motion for an Extension of Time to Respond to Defendants *1360 Barrett and Freeman's\nMotion to Dismiss [89-1], Plaintiffs' Consent Motion for Extension of Time to Respond to City of Atlanta's Motion\nto Dismiss [95-1], and Plaintiffs' Second Consent Motion for Extension of Time to Respond to County Defendants'\nMotion to Dismiss [101-1] are GRANTED nunc pro tunc. Likewise, Plaintiffs' Motion for Judicial Notice [113-1],\nbeing unopposed, is GRANTED. See LR 7.1B, NDGa (\"Failure to file a response shall indicate that there is no\nopposition to the motion.\").\nDefendants Barrett and Freeman's Motion to Dismiss Counts in the Fourth Amended Complaint [85-1], and the\nCounty Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint [88-1] are GRANTED in part and\nDENIED in part. Defendant City of Atlanta's Motion to Dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint [87-1] is DENIED.\nCounty Defendants' Motion to Stay Discovery [92-1] and Defendants Barrett and Freeman's Motion to Stay\nDiscovery [93-1] are DENIED as moot.\n\nIn accordance with its March 25, 2005 Order, the Court continues to RESERVE RULING on County Defendants'\nMotion for Certification of Order for Interlocutory Appeal [77-1]. The County Defendants will have 30 days from\nthe date appearing on this Order within which to either amend their pending Motion for Certification or to inform\nthe Court that they will not be filing an amendment. Plaintiffs will have 30 days after Defendants file their\namended motion or notice within which to file a response to the motion. Defendants' reply brief will be due 15\ndays after Plaintiffs file their response.\n[1] The term \"County Defendants,\" as used herein, refers to Fulton County and the seven members of the Fulton\nCounty Board of Commissioners.\n[2] Plaintiffs have additionally requested leave to exceed the page limits imposed by the local rules. Because the\nfilings already before the Court exceed those limitations, the Court will permit Plaintiffs the requested leave, and\nconsider their papers. As it relates to future submissions, however, Plaintiffs are strongly encouraged to focus\ntheir arguments in such a way as to bring their filings into compliance with LR 7.1D, NDGa.\n[3] The Court acknowledges that, ideally, the first inquiry to be undertaken in the qualified immunity analysis is\nwhether the facts as alleged, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, establish a constitutional violation. \nSaucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). Here, however, Defendants have\nneglected to fully brief this \"threshold\" question, and the Court is reluctant to rule on the precise contours of the\nrights at issue in this litigation without the benefit of hearing complete argument from both sides. As a\nconsequence, it will assume for purposes of the instant motion that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a\nconstitutional violation, and addresses only the question whether the rights purportedly violated were \"clearly\nestablished\" within the meaning of pertinent authority.\n[4] In affording the defendants qualified immunity in Wilson, the Eleventh Circuit engaged in a \"materially similar\"\ncomparison of relevant precedent to the record before it. This rigorous precedential comparison for determining\nwhether a defendant acted in violation of a claimant's \"clearly established\" rights has since been criticized by the\nSupreme Court. Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 740, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002).\n[5] Plaintiffs cite Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 227 F.R.D. 159 (N.D.N.Y.2005), to support a contrary view.\nThere, the District Court for the Northern District of New York considered, and ultimately rejected, an argument\nthat no \"strip search\" had been performed on inmates where they were made to disrobe in front of guards. 227\nF.R.D. at 168-69. The court read Second Circuit precedent as foreclosing a definition of a \"strip search\" as limited\nto those which targeted singularly private parts of the body. Id. at 169 (\"Defendants contend that the Second\nCircuit has determined that in order to be constitutionally problematic, a strip search must target the breast,\ngenitals, and anus.... This misstates the law of this Circuit.\"). This Court, however, does not find that Marriott\nadvances Plaintiffs' qualified immunity argument. That decision, issued after the searches at issue here took\nplace, could not have apprised Sheriffs Barrett and Freeman of the outer limits embodied in the concept of a\n\"strip search,\" and the Eleventh Circuit has squarely rejected the proposition that judicial decisions outside this\nCircuit can \"clearly establish\" principles of law for those officials who operate within its boundaries. See Marsh,\n268 F.3d at 1033 n. 10.\n[6] To be clear, this holding applies with equal force to the Plaintiffs and putative class members who fall or would\nfall into the so-called Alpha Arrestee Strip Search Class and Court Return Strip Search Class. These persons,\naccording to the Fourth Amended Complaint, had obtained the status of \"releasees\" at the time the challenged\nsearch was performed 00 whether by court order or the posting of bond. It is Plaintiffs' position that there is no\n97\nreason why these individuals should have to be put back into the Jail's general population prior to their release,\nand thus, that subjecting them to the strip search procedure that precedes reentry into that population is uniquely\noffensive. \nIn fairness to Plaintiffs, the Court appreciates that any need to conduct the challenged searches may be\nsignificantly diminished in these instances, and acknowledges that the status of the inspected persons may prove\ngermane to the ultimate constitutional inquiry. Plaintiffs have not, however, directed the Court to any United\nStates Supreme Court, Eleventh Circuit, or Georgia Supreme Court authority compelling a finding of\nunconstitutionality on these facts, and absent such authority, this Court cannot deem the rights Plaintiffs seek to\n\nvindicate vis-a-vis these subclasses any more \"clearly established\" than those of the remaining putative class. \nSee Marsh, 268 F.3d at 1033 n. 10.\n[7] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent the decisions of the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit handed down prior to September 30, 1981. Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661\nF.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir.1981).\n[8] As explained supra, note 3, the Court declines at this juncture to resolve the outer boundaries of the\nconstitutional right to be free from over-detention without the benefit of hearing full argument from the parties in\nthis litigation. That is, it declines to resolve whether the standard announced by the Supreme Court in \nMcLaughlin, or some more stringent analysis, should apply when an individual challenges his continued detention\nbeyond the expiration of the government's right to hold him. Nevertheless, the Court does not believe the case\nlaw leaves any room to doubt the existence of an individual's constitutional right to be released from detention\nwithin a reasonable time after it is or reasonably should be known that he is entitled to such release.\n[9] Plaintiff Alan Powell claims to have been over-detained for three days; Plaintiff Tory Dunlap for four days;\nPlaintiff Lee Antonio Smith for three days; Plaintiff David Evans for ten days; Plaintiff Stanley Clemons for two\ndays (as of the filing of the Second Amended Complaint); Plaintiff Allen Middleton for three days; Plaintiff Anthony\nWestbrook for four days; Plaintiff Benjamin Blake for two days; Plaintiff Henry Witherspoon for seven days;\nPlaintiff Antionne Wolf for one day; and Plaintiff Kristopher Matkins for four days.\n[10] Ironically, this Court's review of applicable precedent reveals that Brass held constitutional one of the longest\n\"over-detention\" delays in reported authority (outside the realm of \"mistaken identity\" cases) 00 a delay which\n97\nlasted 39 hours after a court had ordered the detainee's release. See328 F.3d at 1202. As the Ninth Circuit has\nobserved in subsequent decisions, however, Brass was unique in that the detainee there did not challenge the\noverall length of his delay, but rather, isolated administrative practices he found objectionable. See Berry, at\n768-69. Because the Brass court considered only the reasonableness of the challenged procedures, rather than\nwhether the aggregate resultant delay evinced deliberate indifference to the detainee's rights, it stands on a\ndifferent footing than this and most other \"over-detention\" controversies.\n[11] The City of Atlanta apparently requests reconsideration on other aspects of the Court's January 13, 2005\nOrder as well, having incorporated in their current motion to dismiss many arguments that were already\nconsidered, and rejected, by the Court. For all the reasons stated in subsection 1, infra, that request is denied.\n[12] Of course, the Court's holding that the rights of the \"strip search\" plaintiffs were not established with sufficient\nclarity to deny the defendant actors qualified immunity presents an arduous hurdle for Plaintiffs to overcome in\nsucceeding on a theory of entrustment liability. This Court is not presently prepared, however, to entirely conflate\nthe standard for constructive notice in the entrustment liability context with that employed in deciding whether a\nright is \"clearly established\" for purposes of qualified immunity. Given the procedural posture of this case,\nmoreover, that issue is not before the Court.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
