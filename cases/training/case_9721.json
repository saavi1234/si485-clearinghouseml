    "summary": "<p>On July 6, 1979, nine undocumented aliens living in New York brought a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, challenging their denial of Medicaid benefits on the basis of their alien status.  Plaintiffs claimed that Medicaid regulations, 42 C.F.R. ˜ 435.402(b), issued by the Department of Health and Human Services and a companion New York State regulation, 18 NYCRR ˜ 349.3, which called for the denial of all Medicaid benefits on the basis of alienage violated equal protection and due process and were contrary to the language of the Medicaid statute 42 U.S.C. ˜˜ 1396 et seq..  They also claimed that narrower restrictions which denied prenatal care to pregnant aliens and their unborn children were invalid.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification.</p><p>The case was certified as a class action on January 16, 1981, with the class defined as gall aliens residing in the State of New York who have been denied Medicaid on the basis of their alienage.h The class definition was later amended to include gall aliens residing in New York State under color of law who have applied or attempted to apply for Medicaid but have been or would be denied Medicaid on the basis of their alienage.h</p><p>The case languished for years while the parties engaged in pre-trial discovery.  </p><p>On July 14, 1986, the District Court (Judge Charles P. Sifton) granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff class and held that the denial of Medicaid benefits to all aliens who were not admitted for permanent residence or not gpermanently residing under color of lawh (PRUCOL) was not authorized by the Medicaid statute. Lewis v. Gross, 663 F.Supp. 1164 (E.D.N.Y.1986).  The defendants moved for reconsideration in light of a new law passed by Congress, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (gOBRAh), which contained new provisions concerning the eligibility of aliens for Medicaid benefits.  The Court found that since the language of the challenged regulation, 42 C.F.R. ˜ 435.402(b), appeared verbatim in the new law (OBRA), the Court would not bar enforcement of the regulation in the future.  However, the Court refused to preclude relief to aliens who had successfully challenged the regulation prior to passage of statute.  Lewis v. Grinker, 660 F.Supp. 169 (E.D.N.Y. 1987).  </p><p>In response to OBRA, plaintiffs and the City of New York, which joined the case as a plaintiff-intervenor, moved for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the new law contained an impermissibly narrow definition of the phrase gpermanently residing under color of lawh (PRUCOL) and that the continued denial of Medicaid benefits for prenatal care to pregnant alien women was unlawful.  The District Court granted the motion in part, and issued a preliminary injunction barring gthe denial of Medicaid coverage for prenatal care to alien women residing in New York State with a medically verifiable pregnancy if her unborn child would be eligible for Medicaid if born at the time of the application.h  Lewis v. Grinker, 1987 WL 8412 (E.D.N.Y. Mar 06, 1987).  The Court later made the injunction permanent. Lewis v. Grinker, 794 F.Supp. 1193 (E.D.N.Y. 1991).  The defendants appealed and the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the Medicaid statute as amended by OBRA '86 did not prevent otherwise eligible pregnant women from receiving prenatal care to benefit their future U.S. citizen children.   Lewis v. Grinker, 965 F.2d 1206 (2nd Cir.1992).</p><p>In a separate order dated April 1, 1991, the District Court granted relief to plaintiffs who were sued by health care providers for unpaid medical bills incurred prior to OBRA-86, which should have been paid by Medicaid.  Lewis v. Grinker, 1991 WL 338134 (E.D.N.Y. Apr 01, 1991).</p><p>     </p><p>The injunction regarding prenatal care remained in force until 2000, when the government moved to vacate it on the basis of the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 which contained further alien eligibility restrictions for Medicaid.  The Act changed the definition of gqualified aliensh eligible for Medicaid to exclude many PRUCOL aliens who were previously eligible for Medicaid under OBRA Œ86.  The District Court (Judge Sifton) denied the motion to vacate, finding that the Medicaid alien eligibility restrictions in Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act violated Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Lewis v. Grinker, 111 F.Supp.2d 142 (E.D.N.Y. 2000).  The defendants appealed.</p><p>The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part. The Court (Circuit Judge Newman) held that the Welfare Reform Act's denial of prenatal care to unqualified aliens did not violated equal protection and the part of the injunction ordering prenatal Medicaid assistance to the plaintiff class was therefore reversed.  The Court affirmed the part of the injunction which required the government to make automatic eligibility for Medicaid coverage available to the citizen children of the plaintiff class upon their birth.  Lewis v. Thompson, 252 F.3d 567 (2nd Cir.2001). On remand, the District Court modified its injunction in accordance with the Second Circuitfs opinion and entered final judgment on June 12, 2002.</p><p>As of the date of this summary, there was no further case activity noted on the PACER docket.</p><p></p>",

Since the suit was filed, the Medicaid statute has \nbeen amended in relevant ways five times, the district court has issued three different \ninjunctions and four separate opinions, the Secretary has announced a host of new \nregulations, and yet questions persist about the precise contours of aliens' entitlement to \nMedicaid coverage. \nIn this appeal, we are called upon to decide only a single narrow question. Did Congress, in \nenacting the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, P.L. 99-509, 100 Stat. 1874 \n(OBRA '86), intend to prevent otherwise eligible pregnant women who are residing in this \ncountry without the approval of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) from \nreceiving Medicaid sponsored prenatal care, even though their children, if born in the United \nStates, will become United States citizens? After reviewing the language of the statute, the \nlegislative and statutory background, and the relevant administrative interpretations, we \nconclude that Congress did not intend to bar these women from receiving Medicaid \nsponsored prenatal care. Accordingly, we affirm the permanent injunction issued by the \ndistrict court. \nI \nIn order to understand the complex question presented by this appeal, it is necessary to \nexplore in some depth the structure of the Medicaid statute, the development of Medicaid \ncoverage for prenatal care, and the origins of the alienage restriction at issue here. \nA \nOriginally enacted in 1965, Medicaid is a \"cooperative federal/state cost-sharing program \ndesigned to enable participating states to furnish medical assistance to persons whose \nincome and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical care and \n\nservices.\" DeJesus v. Perales, 770 F.2d 316, 318 (2d. Cir.1985), cert. denied, 478 U.S. \n1007, 106 S.Ct. 3301, 92 L.Ed.2d 715 (1986). In order to provide Medicaid coverage to its \ncitizens, a state must first adopt a state Medicaid plan and submit the plan for approval by \nthe Secretary. Once the state plan is approved, the federal government will partially \nreimburse the state for expenditures made pursuant to the state plan. \nThe Act authorizes state plans to extend coverage to two basic categories of individuals, the \ncategorically needy and the medically needy. As the district court explained in Lewis v. \nGross, 663 F.Supp. 1164, 1174 (E.D.N.Y.1986) (Lewis I), \"[r]oughly speaking, the \ncategorically needy are those who earn no more than that necessary to cover the \nnecessities of life; the medically needy differ in that it is only the expense of necessary \nmedical care that strains their ability to pay for basic necessities.\" The Medicaid statute \nprovides a complex set of standards for the way that participating states must provide \ncoverage to categorically and medically needy individuals. \nFirst, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i) requires participating states to provide Medicaid to a \nsub-group of the categorically needy, the \"mandatory categorically needy.\" This group is \nmostly made up of those already receiving some other government benefit, such as aid to \nfamilies with dependent children (AFDC), or supplemental security income (SSI). Women \nwho meet the statutory definition of \"qualified pregnant women\" are also considered \nmandatory categorically needy. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(III). \nSecond, § 1396d(a)(i) defines a group of categorically needy individuals to whom the state \nmay, at the state's option, choose to provide Medicaid coverage. \"Generally speaking ... the \noptionally needy subgroup includes minors, the elderly, the blind, the disabled, pregnant \nwomen, [and] the spouses of SSI recipients or AFDC-related caretaker relatives, if they are \n`needy' according to the income and resource requirements of the AFDC and SSI \n1209*1209 cash benefit programs.\" Lewis I, 663 F.Supp. at 1177. \nThird, the medically needy category includes the same groups of individuals that the states \nmay cover as optional categorically needy, but applies less stringent financial and resource \nrequirements. While medically needy coverage is generally optional with the states, once a \nstate chooses to provide coverage to some medically needy individuals, it must provide, \ninter alia, prenatal and delivery services to medically needy pregnant women. § \n1396a(a)(10)(C)(ii) & (iii). \nUnder current law, pregnant women seeking prenatal care may be eligible for Medicaid \nunder any of the three categories, depending on their financial status. However, this was \nnot always the case. Before 1981, pregnant women were not even identified as a special \neligibility group under the Medicaid statute. Instead, states simply had the option to extend \nprenatal care directly to the fetus, under the assumption that fetuses were optional \ncategorically needy as \"persons under the age of 21.\" In order to assess properly \nCongressional intent in enacting the immigration restriction of OBRA '86, it is first necessary \nto examine more carefully this shift from a fetal centered to a maternal centered approach to \nprenatal care. \nB \n\n1. Pre-1975. \nBefore the Medicaid statute was enacted in 1965, federal sponsorship of prenatal care \ncame largely under AFDC. AFDC required participating states to provide benefits to needy, \ndependent children. Federal law defined a \"dependent child\" as: \na needy child (1) who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of death, \ncontinued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, and who is \nliving with [relatives] ..., in a place of residence maintained by one or more such relatives as \nhis or their own home, and (2) who is (A) under the age of eighteen or (B) under the age 21 \nand ... a student. \n42 U.S.C. § 606(a) (1976). \nBeginning in the 1940's, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) \nreimbursed those states that chose to provide AFDC benefits to fetuses as dependent \nchildren. \nUntil 1975 it was unclear whether federal reimbursement for state AFDC expenditures to \nfetuses was mandatory because fetuses were dependent children within the definition of § \n606(a) or simply optional with the Secretary pursuant to his \"general authority to make rules \nfor the efficient administration of the Act.\" Burns v. Alcala, 420 U.S. 575, 584, 95 S.Ct. \n1180, 1186, 43 L.Ed.2d 469 (1975). \nIn Burns, the Supreme Court ruled that fetuses were not dependent children within the \nmeaning of the AFDC statute and thus the states were not required to provide AFDC to \npregnant women. The court viewed the question of whether the states retained the option of \ntreating fetuses as dependent children as not properly presented in the case but suggested \nthat HEW could authorize optional coverage of pregnant women under AFDC via its general \nregulatory powers. \n2. 1975-1981. \nBetween 1975 and 1981, HEW continued to allow states the option of treating fetuses as \ndependent children in order to provide AFDC to pregnant women. However, the Secretary \nnever adopted this casual practice in formal regulations. The Secretary acknowledges that \nduring this time period he allowed the states to provide Medicaid on a similar, optional \nbasis, under the theory that fetuses were optional categorically needy as \"persons under \nthe age of 21.\" While this informal practice was never adopted by regulation, until 1985 the \nMedicaid program manual that the Secretary sent to the states listed fetuses as a group the \nstates could cover as optional categorically needy. \n1210*1210 3. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \nof 1981. \n\nIn the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, P.L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 853 (1981) [OBRA \n'81], Congress began the slow shift from fetal centered to maternal centered provision of \nprenatal care. OBRA '81 amended the AFDC statute in three ways. \nFirst, OBRA '81 addressed the question left open by Burns, declaring that the states no \nlonger had the option to give AFDC directly to meet the needs of the unborn. OBRA '81, § \n2312(b), 95 Stat. 853. In place of direct AFDC coverage for the fetus, Congress broadened \ncoverage to include \nat the option of the state, a pregnant woman but only if it has been medically verified that \nthe child is expected to be born in the month such payments are made or within the three \nmonth period following such month of payment, and who, if such child had been born and \nwas living with her in the month of payment, would be eligible for [AFDC]. \nOBRA '81, § 2312(a), 95 Stat. 853. \nIn other words, women in the third trimester of pregnancy could apply for AFDC as if their \nchild had been born. Finally, the act gave the states the option to \"deem\" a pregnant woman \nan AFDC recipient for Medicaid purposes (and thus mandatorily eligible for Medicaid) if the \nwoman would be eligible for AFDC if the child had been born and was living with her. OBRA \n'81, § 2312(b), 95 Stat. 853. \nOBRA '81 also amended the Medicaid statute in two ways. First, echoing the \naforementioned addition to the AFDC statute, OBRA '81 authorized the states to \"deem\" \npregnant women to be AFDC recipients in order to provide these women with prenatal care \nunder Medicaid. Second, OBRA '81 provided that states with medically needy programs \nwere required to provide prenatal care to medically needy pregnant women. \nThus, after OBRA '81, states no longer had the option to provide AFDC directly to fetuses. \nNonetheless, OBRA '81 greatly expanded access to prenatal care. Under the act, a mother \nwas eligible for AFDC in the last three months of pregnancy if she would be eligible based \non the constructive birth of the fetus. Further, the states had the option to provide Medicaid \ncoverage for prenatal care to the mother either as mandatory categorically needy or as \nmedically needy. Finally, since the act did not address the question, the Secretary \ncontinued to allow the states the option to provide Medicaid coverage directly to the fetus as \na person under age 21. \n4. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. \nIn the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, P.L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 494 (1984) [DRA '84], Congress \nfor the first time established mandatory Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women. The DRA \nmade mandatory categorically needy any \"qualified pregnant woman or child,\" DRA '84 § \n2361(b), 98 Stat. 1104, defined as: \n(1) a pregnant woman who — \n(A) would be eligible for [AFDC] ... if her child had been born and was living with her in the \nmonth such aid would be paid, and such pregnancy has been medically verified; or \n\n(B) is a member of a family which would be eligible for [AFDC] ...; and \n(2) a child who is under 5 years of age ... and who meets the income and resources \nrequirements of the State [AFDC] plan. \nDRA '84, § 2361(b), 98 Stat. 1104. \nThe qualified pregnant woman provision greatly expanded access to prenatal care. Where \nOBRA '81 merely gave states the option to employ the constructive birth mechanism to \ndeem pregnant women AFDC recipients for Medicaid purposes, DRA '84 required the \nstates to do so. Further, DRA '84 provided for automatic eligibility for the newborn: \n[a] child born to a woman eligible for, and receiving medical assistance under a state plan \non the date of the child's birth shall be deemed to have applied for medical assistance and \nto have been found eligible for such assistance under such plan on the date of such birth \nand to remain eligible for such assistance for a 1211*1211 period of one year so long as the \nchild is a member of the women's household and the woman remains eligible for such \nassistance. \nDRA '84, § 2362(a), 98 Stat. 1104. \nThis provision insured that the Medicaid coverage would follow the fetus after birth. \nHowever, significant limits remained. Because qualified pregnant woman status turned on \nAFDC eligibility, the Medicaid applicant had to satisfy the categorical requirements of \nAFDC. For example, if the pregnant woman were living with the child's father, she would not \nbe a qualified pregnant woman under DRA '84 since the imputed child would not be a \ndependent child under AFDC, which requires that the child be \"deprived of parental support \nor care by reason of death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental \nincapacity of a parent.\" 42 U.S.C. § 606(a). \n5. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \nAct of 1985. \nIn the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, P.L. 99-272, 100 Stat. 201 \n[COBRA '85], Congress broke the link between AFDC eligibility and Medicaid eligibility for \npregnant women. The statute added a subsection (C) to the definition of a qualified \npregnant woman to include a pregnant woman who \"meets the income and resource \nrequirements of a [State AFDC plan].\" COBRA '85, § 9501, 100 Stat. 201. This separation \nmade it significantly easier for pregnant women to qualify for prenatal care. Where before \nthey had to demonstrate they fit into one of the particular categories of eligibility for AFDC, \nwhich took into account such factors as family structure, after COBRA '85 all the \nprospective qualified pregnant woman had to demonstrate was that she was sufficiently \npoor. Further, the Secretary interpreted the imputed birth provision to apply to all three \nsections of the definition of qualified pregnant women. 52 Fed.Reg. 43,065 (1987). Thus, \nthe fetus' interest could be considered in determining whether the woman was financially \nneedy. \n\nBetween 1981, when Congress eliminated direct AFDC eligibility for fetuses, and 1984, \nwhen Congress made Medicaid coverage for AFDC eligible pregnant women mandatory, \nthe Secretary apparently also allowed states to provide Medicaid coverage in the name of \nthe fetus rather than the pregnant woman. In February 1985, in Program Memorandum # \n85-3, for the first time the Secretary did not list fetuses as one of the categories of people \nunder age 21 to whom the states could, at their option, provide Medicaid. Whether this \nomission was inadvertent or intentional was not made clear until December 6, 1985, when, \nin response to an inquiry from a regional Medicaid administrator, the Acting Director of the \nBureau of Eligibility, Reimbursement and Coverage sent a memo to the regional \nadministrator informing him that HHS now considered Congress' intent to be that the \nexclusive source of Medicaid coverage for prenatal care would be through the pregnant \nmother. This unpublished decision by the Secretary completed the shift from fetal centered \nto maternal centered prenatal care. \nC \nWhen Congress passed the Medicaid statute in 1965, it did not address the eligibility of \naliens. Until 1973, the Secretary routinely approved State plans that provided Medicaid \nbenefits to aliens. Lewis I at 1181-82. Indeed, in 1972 the Secretary proposed regulations \nthat would have prevented the states from discriminating against aliens in providing \nMedicaid. See 37 Fed.Reg. 1,977 (1972). Before these regulations became final, however, \nCongress amended the Social Security Act to create the supplemental security income \n(SSI) program. SSI expressly excluded aliens from coverage. See Social Security Act \nAmendments of 1972, § 1614, Pub.L. No. 92-603, Title III, § 301, 86 Stat. 1329, 1471 \n(1972). Despite the fact that Congress simultaneously amended the Medicaid statute and \ndid not create an alien exclusion there, the Secretary concluded that Congress must also \nhave intended to preclude aliens from receiving Medicaid. Accordingly, the Secretary \npromulgated an 1212*1212 alienage restriction on access to Medicaid in 38 Fed.Reg. \n30,259 (1973), codified at 45 C.F.R. 248.50. This rule provided that: \n[a] state plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act [Medicaid] shall include an otherwise \neligible individual who is a resident of the United States but only if he is either (a) a citizen \nor (b) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing \nin the United States under color of law. \nThis pattern of Congressional enactment of an alienage restriction in some other benefit \nstatute coupled with simultaneous amendments to Medicaid not providing for an alienage \nrestriction continued when, in OBRA '81, Congress amended AFDC to include an alienage \nrestriction, but did not place one on Medicaid. Lewis I at 1182. \nSometime before 1986, the Medicaid alienage exclusion imposed by the Secretary in 1973 \nwas replaced with the following provision that does not appear to mandate excluding aliens: \nThe agency must provide Medicaid to otherwise eligible residents of the United States who \nare — \n(a) Citizens; or \n\n(b) Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence or permanently residing in the United \nStates under color of law ...\" \n42 C.F.R. 435.402. \nThe regulation did not state whether the federal government would reimburse a State that, \nalthough not mandated, nevertheless chose to provide benefits to aliens that were not \npermanently residing in the United States under color of law [PRUCOL] as well. \nNonetheless, the Secretary apparently continued to require that state Medicaid plans \nexclude aliens. \nThe Secretary has never published regulations dealing with the alienage status of the fetus. \nThe only expression of policy on this point appears in the HCFA Regional Office Manual-7, \nChapter 5 (May 10, 1979), which, in response to an inquiry from Region II on the Medicaid \neligibility of unborn children of non-citizen mothers, states, \"[u]nborn children carry the \ncitizenship status of the mother ... It cannot be assumed that a child will be born in the \nUnited States, and therefore, a child cannot gain U.S. citizenship through that means until \ndelivery.\" This 1979 office manual provision predates the creation of the imputed birth \nconcept in OBRA '81, which the Secretary interprets as requiring the states to treat the \nunborn child \"as if the child were born and living with the mother.\" 52 Fed.Reg. 43,068 \n(1987). Since the Secretary has not revisited the question, it is unclear whether the 1979 \npolicy survived this change in the law. \nIn 1986, five years after this litigation began, Congress enacted the Medicaid alienage \nrestriction that the Secretary here contends requires denying Medicaid coverage for \nprenatal care to non-PRUCOL pregnant alien women, even though their children will, in all \nlikelihood, be born in this country and thus become American citizens. See 42 U.S.C.A. § \n1396a (West Supp.1991). \nII \nThis litigation commenced in 1981, when plaintiffs Lewis et. al. sued to enjoin the Secretary \nfrom enforcing the regulations imposing a general alienage restriction on Medicaid eligibility. \nPlaintiffs argued that (1) the Medicaid statute did not explicitly authorize such a regulation; \n(2) that the regulations violated equal protection and due process; (3) that the Secretary's \ndefinition of PRUCOL was impermissibly narrow; and (4) that the regulations did not apply \nto benefits directed to unborn children. After years of pre-trial skirmishing over the \ndimensions of the plaintiff class, the litigation reached its apparent culmination in 1986. On \nJuly 14, 1986, the district court ruled that the Secretary's policy of denying Medicaid \nbenefits to all aliens who are not admitted for permanent residence or permanently residing \nunder color of law (PRUCOL) was not authorized by the statute. Lewis v. Gross, 663 \nF.Supp. 1164 (E.D.N.Y.1986) (Lewis I). The court pointed out that nothing in the Medicaid \nstatute expressly authorized an alienage restriction, while similar benefit programs, like \nAFDC and SSI, contained explicit alienage 1213*1213 restrictions in their authorizing \nstatutes. Id. at 1182. The court reasoned that Congress obviously knew how to create an \nalienage restriction, and had simply declined to do so for Medicaid. Id. at 1183. The court \nrejected the Secretary's arguments that Congress had acquiesced in the Secretary's \nlongstanding policy, id. at 1179-80, and that the Medicaid statute incorporated by reference \n\nthe alienage restrictions of the AFDC and Social Security Acts. Id. at 1180. Instead, the \ncourt noted that while the AFDC and SSI alienage restrictions could be imported into the \nmandatory categorically needy group, since Medicaid eligibility under this rubric turned on \nthe applicant already receiving AFDC or SSI, neither the medically needy group nor the \noptional categorically needy group explicitly made reference to AFDC or SSI. Accordingly, \nthe alienage restrictions in AFDC and SSI could not be incorporated into all the provisions \nof the Medicaid Act. Id. Since the court decided the case on statutory grounds, it did not \nreach any of plaintiffs' other claims. In particular, the court did not address the application of \nalienage restrictions to prenatal care. \nCongress responded swiftly to the district court's opinion. On October 21, 1986, Congress \npassed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-509, 100 Stat. 2050 \n(OBRA '86). OBRA '86 added to § 1396a of the Medicaid act the provision that: \n[n]otwithstanding paragraph 10(B) or any other provision of this subsection, a State plan \nshall provide medical assistance with respect to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for \npermanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of \nlaw only in accordance with section 1396b(v) of this title. \n42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a (1991 Supp.) \n§ 1396b(v) provides that: \n(2) Payments shall be made under this section for care and services that are furnished to an \nalien ... only if — \n(A) such care and services are necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical \ncondition of the alien, and \n(B) such alien otherwise meets the eligibility requirements for medical assistance under the \nState plan ... \n(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term \"emergency medical condition\" means a \nmedical condition (including emergency labor and delivery) manifesting itself by acute \nsymptoms of sufficient severity \n. . . . . \n42 U.S.C.A. § 1396b(v) (1991 Supp.) \nThe legislative history of OBRA '86 explains that these amendments were designed \nspecifically to address the district court's decision in Lewis I. The vice of Lewis I was that \n\"the result of th[e] decision is that otherwise qualified aliens who are eligible for Medicaid as \nnon-cash beneficiaries — i.e., medically needy or optional categorically needy individuals — \nare entitled to Medicaid coverage.\" H.Rep. No. 99-727, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 111 (1985), \nreprinted in, 1986 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.News 3607, 3701 [hereinafter 1986 House \nReport]. Accordingly, OBRA '86 was enacted in order to insure that \"nothing in the Medicaid \ntitle should be construed to require a State plan to offer coverage to aliens who are not \n\nlawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the U.S. \nunder color of law.\" Id. \nSince OBRA '86 was passed after the district court's decision in Lewis I but before the entry \nof final judgment, the district court invited the parties to brief the issue of what effect the \nstatute had on the ruling in Lewis I. The Secretary then moved to vacate Lewis I. On April \n23, 1987, the district court rejected the Secretary's request to vacate the prior opinion. \nWhile agreeing that prospective injunctive relief was no longer appropriate, the court \nconcluded that OBRA '86 was not intended to have retroactive effect, so the plaintiffs were \nentitled to relief for the period dating prior to January 1, 1987, when OBRA '86 went into \neffect. See Lewis v. Grinker, 660 F.Supp. 169 (E.D.N.Y.1987) (Lewis II). \nWhile the Secretary's motion for reconsideration of Lewis I was pending, the Secretary \nsubmitted to the court an advance 1214*1214 copy of an internal directive which, inter alia, \nprovided that pregnant non-PRUCOL women would not be eligible for Medicaid sponsored \nprenatal care. On January 20, 1987, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to \nprevent this policy from going into effect. The plaintiffs argued both that the policy was not \nauthorized by OBRA '86 and that, if it was, the policy was unconstitutional. On March 5, \n1987, the district court issued the preliminary injunction. Lewis v. Grinker, CV-79-1740, \n1987 WL 8412 (E.D.N.Y. March 5, 1987) (Lewis III). The court reasoned that fetuses were \neligible for Medicaid in their own name as optional categorically needy individuals under the \nage of 21, that fetuses were not aliens, and thus that the alienage restriction of OBRA '86 \ndid not apply. Lewis III at 27-28. The court did not reach the constitutional question. The \nSecretary chose not to appeal from the court's decision in Lewis III, despite the fact that the \ncourt's determination that fetuses were eligible in their own name conflicted with the \nagency's policy announced in the December 6, 1985 internal memorandum. \nIn November of 1989, the plaintiffs returned to the district court, this time seeking to turn the \npreliminary injunction of Lewis III into a permanent injunction. Lewis v. Grinker, CV-79-1740, \n1991 WL 337553 (E.D.N.Y. March 14, 1991) (Lewis IV). In Lewis IV, the district court \nagreed with the Secretary that fetuses were not eligible for Medicaid in their own name as \n\"individuals under age 21.\" Id. at 14. However, the court did not deny the request for a \npermanent injunction. Instead, the court determined that OBRA '86 did not prevent non-\nPRUCOL aliens from being deemed qualified pregnant women for the purpose of receiving \nprenatal care. The district court explained that the qualified pregnant woman rule requires \nthat the fetus be deemed born, and the fetus, if born would be a citizen. Lewis IV at 17. \nFurther, though provided through the mother, prenatal care is designed to benefit the fetus. \nId. at 19. Since the fetus has imputed citizenship, the district court concluded that the \nalienage restriction did not apply to prenatal care. Finally, though not explicitly deciding the \nconstitutional question, the district court observed that \"the denial of prenatal care in the \ncircumstances here presented may well violate the equal protection clause.\" Id. at 27. \nAccordingly, the district court granted the permanent injunction. Id. at 30. At long last, a \ndecade after the complaint was filed, this appeal followed. \nIII \nThe Secretary makes little effort to justify denying, pursuant to an alien restriction, care that \nwill, in all likelihood, benefit future citizens. The Secretary does not dispute that prenatal \n\ncare is cost effective or that a significant number of citizen children will suffer birth defects \nas a direct result of the denial of prenatal care to their non-PRUCOL mothers. The \nSecretary suggests only that denying Medicaid coverage to poor, pregnant, non-PRUCOL \nwomen will somehow inspire them to return to their native land for prenatal care. The \nSecretary's ambivalence about this highly speculative justification is suggested by the fact \nthat for the duration of this lawsuit, the Secretary has continued to provide non-PRUCOL \nwomen with prenatal care and neither appealed the preliminary injunction issued in Lewis III \nnor requested a stay pending appeal of the permanent injunction issued in Lewis IV. As \njudges, however, our task is not to assess whether the Secretary's decision to bar non-\nPRUCOL women from receiving prenatal care is a wise one. Instead, we must determine \nwhether Congress intended that result or some other, and, if it did, whether Congress' \nchoice was constitutional. \nThe Secretary relies principally on the plain language of OBRA '86 that \"[n]otwithstanding \nparagraph 10(B) or any other provision of this subsection, a State plan shall provide medical \nassistance with respect to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or \notherwise permanently residing under color of law only in accordance with section 1396b(v) \nof this title.\" Section 1396b(v) limits coverage to emergency situations, including emergency \nlabor and delivery. Plaintiffs 1215*1215 concede that prenatal care does not come within \nthe definition of an emergency condition in § 1396b(v). Clearly, the Secretary's position is \nconsistent with the plain language of the statute. \nIn the usual case, where the language of the statute is clear, that is the end of the analysis. \nConnecticut v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 656 F.2d 902, 909 (2d. Cir.1981). \nBut, we can never forget that what we are searching for is Congressional intent. Farley v. \nMetro-North Commuter R.R., 865 F.2d 33, 33 (2d Cir. 1989) (\"a judge must ascertain what \nCongress intended the law to be.\"). While the language employed by Congress is usually a \nsure guide to Congress' intent, it is not an infallible proxy. See Bob Jones University v. \nUnited States, 461 U.S. 574, 586, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 2025, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983) (\"It is a \nwell-established canon of statutory construction that a court should go beyond the literal \nlanguage of a statute if reliance on that language would defeat the plain purpose of the \nstatute.\"). We must bear in mind Learned Hand's admonition that \"it is one of the surest \nindexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the \ndictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to \naccomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their \nmeaning.\" Cabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d. Cir.), aff'd, 326 U.S. 404, 66 S.Ct. \n193, 90 L.Ed. 165 (1945). \nThis advice is particularly pertinent when construing a recent amendment to a complex \nstatute that produces an unexpected result and when there is strong reason to doubt that \nCongress intended that result. See DeJesus v. Perales, 770 F.2d 316, 321 (2d. Cir.1985), \ncert. denied, 478 U.S. 1007, 106 S.Ct. 3301, 92 L.Ed.2d 715 (1986); see also Farley v. \nMetro North Commuter R.R., 690 F.Supp. 268, 270 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (\"The need to examine \na statute's purpose is particularly strong when the situation facing the court was unforseen \nby the legislature at the time when the statute was passed.\"), aff'd, 865 F.2d 33 (2d \nCir.1989); 2A Singer, Statutory Construction § 45.09. \n\nFor example, in Rose v. Rose, 481 U.S. 619, 107 S.Ct. 2029, 95 L.Ed.2d 599 (1987), the \nSupreme Court ruled that a broad statutory bar on attaching veterans' benefits did not \nprevent states from seizing these benefits in order to enforce child support obligations. The \nstatute, 38 U.S.C. § 3101(a), provided that \"[p]ayment of benefits ... under any law \nadministered by the Veteran's Administration ... made to, or on account of, a beneficiary ... \nshall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process \nwhatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.\" Despite the breadth of this \nprohibition, the Court found that \"[r]ecognizing an exception to the application of § 3101(a)'s \nprohibition against attachment, levy, or seizure would further, not undermine, the federal \npurpose in providing these benefits,\" 481 U.S. at 634, 107 S.Ct. at 2038, since the statute \nintended that veterans' benefits support \"not only the veteran, but the veteran's family as \nwell.\" Id. Accordingly, the Court concluded that \"§ 3101(a) does not extend to protect a \nveteran's disability benefits from seizure where the veteran invokes that provision to avoid \nan otherwise valid order of child support.\" Id. Thus, where a broad statutory prohibition \nleads to unforseen results contrary to the purpose of the prohibition, the courts may \nlegitimately recognize an exception to the prohibition in order to further Congress' purpose. \nHere, although we agree with the Secretary that the plain language of the statute appears to \nrequire denying prenatal care to non-PRUCOL women, for the reasons discussed below we \nare convinced that Congress did not realize this result would follow from the blanket \nalienage restriction of OBRA '86 and that had Congress foreseen this problem, it would not \nhave enacted the statute as written. Accordingly, as in Rose, recognizing an exception to \nthe alienage restriction of OBRA '86 for non-PRUCOL pregnant women would further, not \nundermine, Congressional purpose. \n1216*1216 A \nThere are several reasons to believe that Congress did not realize that OBRA '86 would \nresult in denying non-PRUCOL women access to Medicaid sponsored prenatal care. First, \nthe Medicaid Act is a statute of \"unparalleled complexity,\" DeJesus, 770 F.2d at 321, among \nthe \"most intricate ever drafted by Congress\" Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, 453 U.S. 34, 43, \n101 S.Ct. 2633, 2640, 69 L.Ed.2d 460 (1981). Its provisions are \"`almost unintelligible to the \nuninitiated.'\" Id. (quoting Friedman v. Berger, 547 F.2d 724, 727 n. 7 (2d. Cir.1976) cert. \ndenied, 430 U.S. 984, 97 S.Ct. 1681, 52 L.Ed.2d 378 (1977)). In interpreting the Act, we \nmust resist \"the temptation of allowing a literal reading of a relatively recent amendment to \nset at naught the experience of administrators acquired over a score of years.\" DeJesus, \n770 F.2d at 321. Thus, we are always mindful of the possibility that Congress may have \nfailed to perceive a particular consequence of a blanket change in this complex statutory \nscheme. It simply is unwise to blindly assume that Congress will always fully anticipate \nevery implication of the plain meaning of a particular amendment to such a convoluted \nstatute. This seems particularly true when the Congressional enactment comes in the form \nof a section of an end-of-session, omnibus budget reconciliation bill. \nWithin this contorted scheme, few areas are more complex than the coverage of prenatal \ncare. As described above, in the years preceding OBRA '86, Congress had radically \nexpanded the basis for determining eligibility for prenatal care and had gradually moved \nfrom a fetal centered to a maternal centered approach. In doing so, Congress frequently \ntripped over the statute's complexities. For example, the Secretary has concluded that two \n\nsections of the definition of qualified pregnant women are redundant. See 50 Fed.Reg. \n48,102, 48,103 (1985) (\"In our view, the language of section 1905(n)(1)(B) of the Act, \ndefining a qualified pregnant woman, appears to identify a subset of the group already \ndefined in section 1905(n)(1)(A)\"); 52 Fed.Reg. 43,063, 43,068 (1987) (\"the distinction \nbetween the two requirements is not clear\"). Further, when Congress amended OBRA '81 \nto require states with medically needy programs to provide coverage to medically needy \npregnant women, Congress forgot to add pregnant women to § 1396d(a), which lists the \ncategories of individuals that the states can choose to cover as optional categorically needy \nor medically needy. This lacuna was corrected in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility \nAct of 1982, P.L. 97-248, § 137(a)(18), 96 Stat. 380. Both the complexity of the area and \nthe history of mistakes as Congress strove to expand prenatal benefits to future citizens \nraise doubts about whether Congress realized the implications of OBRA '86. \nFurther, the legislative history provides direct evidence that Congress neglected to consider \nthe implications of OBRA '86 for qualified pregnant women. The house report makes clear \nthat the alienage restriction of OBRA '86 was in direct response to the district court's \ndecision in Lewis I. However, that decision dealt with the general alienage restriction \ncontained in the Secretary's regulations and did not consider the narrow issue of whether \nthat alienage restriction applied to prenatal care. \nIn Lewis I the Secretary argued that the general alienage restriction was authorized by the \nstatute since the statute incorporated by reference the eligibility criteria of other statutes, \nlike SSI and AFDC, that contained explicit alienage restrictions. The district court \nacknowledged that \"[s]uch incorporation is clear with respect to the mandatory categorically \nneedy, who are those actually receiving AFDC and SSI benefits.\" Lewis I, 663 F.Supp. at \n1178. However, the court observed that AFDC or SSI eligibility was not a prerequisite for \nbeing classified as optional categorically needy or medically needy. Accordingly, it rejected \nthe Secretary's incorporation argument. Congress, in enacting OBRA '86, similarly \ncharacterized the group of applicants not currently under an alienage restriction imported \nfrom AFDC or SSI as \"otherwise qualified aliens who are eligible for Medicaid as non-cash \nbeneficiaries — i.e., medically needy or optional categorically 1217*1217 needy \nindividuals.\" H.Rep. at 111, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3701. The Secretary himself, \nin 1990, also agreed that the effect of Lewis I was limited to making eligible medically needy \nand optional categorically needy individuals. 55 Fed.Reg. 36,814 (1990). \nNeither Congress nor the Secretary appeared to realize that COBRA '85 created a class of \nindividuals who were mandatory categorically needy but were not eligible for AFDC or SSI. \nThat is, COBRA '85 added subsection (C) to § 1396d(n)(1), amending the definition of \nqualified pregnant women to include women who \"meet[] the income and resources \nrequirements of a State plan under [AFDC].\" The Secretary has construed subsection (C) to \nmean that \"[i]n determining whether a woman would be eligible under the provisions of \nsection [1396d](n)(1)(C) of the Act, State Medicaid agencies must apply only the financial \neligibility criteria of the State's approved AFDC plan.\" 52 Fed. Reg. 43,065 (1987) \n(emphasis added). In other words, women eligible under subsection (C) need not satisfy \nother criteria of AFDC, like citizenship. Thus, non-PRUCOL pregnant women who satisfied \nthe financial eligibility criteria of AFDC were, after the district court's decision in Lewis I, \nmandatory categorically needy persons eligible for Medicaid. Neither Congress nor the \nSecretary recognized this, since both thought the group made eligible by Lewis I included \n\nonly medically needy and optional categorically needy individuals. Thus, there is direct \nevidence that Congress did not consider qualified pregnant women when it passed the \nalienage restriction in OBRA '86. \nEven if Congress had been considering the plight of non-PRUCOL qualified pregnant \nwomen and their fetuses when it enacted the alienage restriction of OBRA '86, it is not clear \nthat Congress would have realized that OBRA '86 would cut off all Medicaid sponsored \nprenatal care to non-PRUCOL pregnant aliens. In order to foresee this result, Congress \nwould have had to have been aware of one of two unpublished positions taken by HHS: (1) \nthat states no longer had the option to provide coverage directly to the fetus (contained only \nin an unpublished December 5, 1985 letter to a regional administrator) or (2) that the fetus \ninherited the immigration status of the mother (contained only in an unpublished May 10, \n1979 response to an inquiry from a regional administrator). Otherwise, Congress would \nhave assumed that even after OBRA '86 the states would be free to extend prenatal care \ndirectly to the fetus as a person under 21. There is every reason to believe that Congress \nwas not aware of either of these positions. \"We have long since learned not to put too much \nstock in Social Security office manuals,\" N.Y.S. Dept. of Soc. Services v. Bowen, 846 F.2d \n129, 133 (2d. Cir.1988) which, after all, have \"no legal force.\" Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 \nU.S. 785, 789, 101 S.Ct. 1468, 1471, 67 L.Ed.2d 685 (1981) (per curiam). Thus, even if \nCongress had focused on the question, it is unlikely that Congress would have perceived \nthe effect that the Secretary asserts was plainly intended. \nFurther, construing OBRA '86 to terminate prenatal care for non-PRUCOL pregnant women \ncreates an anomaly in another section of the statute. Newborn children are automatically \neligible for Medicaid in their own name if their mothers were eligible for Medicaid sponsored \nprenatal care. 42 C.F.R. § 435.117. If non-PRUCOL pregnant women are ineligible for \nMedicaid, then the child of an alien would not automatically be eligible for Medicaid while \nthe child of a citizen would. Yet both children are United States citizens. Such discrimination \nagainst the citizen child on the basis of the alien status of the parent would raise serious \nequal protection questions. \nThis anomaly is not eliminated by the fact that the newborn child of the alien would be able \nto apply for Medicaid in her own name, or that if the infant were determined to be eligible, \nthe Medicaid award would be retroactive to before the date of her application. Significant \ndisparities in application procedure and coverage remain. Under 42 C.F.R. § 435.914, \nretroactivity extends back only three months prior to the 1218*1218 date of the application. \nThus, if the non-PRUCOL alien's newborn applies more than 3 months after birth, she \nwould not be eligible retroactively for full post birth medical expenses, while the child of the \ncitizen would be automatically eligible for all expenses for one year, without any need to \napply. This potential constitutional infirmity raises further doubt as to Congress' intent to \nexclude non-PRUCOL aliens from prenatal care. It also highlights the irrationality, which \nCongress doubtless would have perceived if it had focused on the issue, of treating the \nfetus of a non-PRUCOL women as an alien when, upon birth, the child will become eligible \nfor the full panoply of protections afforded citizens. \nThe Secretary offers only two arguments to support his claim that Congress considered the \nimpact on prenatal care when it passed the alienage restriction of OBRA '86. First, OBRA \n'86 adds section 1396b(v), which extends emergency care to non-PRUCOL aliens, and \n\ndefines emergency care to include emergency labor and delivery. From this, the Secretary \nargues that Congress must have intended that labor and delivery were the only sort of \nprenatal care that Congress wished to extend to aliens. Otherwise, including labor and \ndelivery within the definition of emergency care would be redundant. There are two \nproblems with this argument. First, emergency labor services differ from prenatal care in \none crucial respect. Emergency labor services inure, at least in part, to the benefit of the \nmother. In contrast, prenatal care principally benefits the fetus. Thus, it is hardly redundant \nto provide both emergency labor and delivery services to the mother and prenatal care to \nthe fetus. Moreover, we do not agree that any redundancy indicates a Congressional intent \nto limit prenatal care, since the existence of redundancies in coverage is consistent with \nCongressional desire to insure that children do not slip through the cracks of prenatal care. \nSee H.Rep. at 100-01, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3690-91 (expanding definition of \nmedically needy pregnant woman so as to prevent interruptions in coverage). \nThe Secretary also points out that in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, \nPub.L. No. 99-603, 100 Stat. 3359 (1986) (IRCA), Congress extended full Medicaid \neligibility for prenatal care to certain groups of legalized aliens. 8 U.S.C.A. § \n1255a(h)(3)(B)(i)(II) (West Supp.1991). The Secretary concludes from this that Congress \nknew how to create eligibility for prenatal care when it wanted to, and in OBRA '86 simply \nchose not to for non-PRUCOL aliens. \nHowever, the Secretary's reading fails to fully account for the structure of IRCA. IRCA \nallows non-PRUCOL aliens who have been residing illegally since January 1, 1982 and who \nmeet certain qualifications to receive an upgrade in immigration status to that of \"an alien \nlawfully admitted for temporary residence.\" § 1255a(a). As a price for the immigration \nupgrade, Section 1255a(h)(1)(A)(ii) of IRCA bars IRCA-legalized aliens, for five years after \nlegalization, from receiving any Medicaid coverage except as provided in sections (h)(2) & \n(h)(3). Section (h)(2) provides that section (h)(1) does not apply to certain Cuban and \nHaitian entrants or to the aged, the blind or the disabled. Section (h)(3) provides that section \n(h)(1) does not apply to bar receipt of emergency and prenatal care. Thus, far from \nexpressing a view about what Medicaid coverage Congress believed other non-PRUCOL \naliens were entitled to, section (h)(3) simply expresses Congress' view that even when \nCongress requires an alien to forego government benefits as the price for enhancement in \nimmigration status, prenatal care is too important to give up. Once again, the Secretary has \nmistaken Congressional solicitude for prenatal care in one area for an intent to deny access \nto prenatal care in every other area. \nTo sum up, the complexity of the statutory scheme, the legislative history of the alienage \nrestriction, the uncertainty of the state of the law at the time of the enactment of the \nalienage restriction, and the anomalies that result from the Secretary's position all indicate \nthat Congress did not realize the effect of the alienage restriction on prenatal care. The \nSecretary's arguments 1219*1219 to the contrary reveal only that Congress generally \nconsidered prenatal and delivery services important. In short, we are persuaded that when \nCongress passed OBRA '86, it did not foresee that the blanket alienage restriction would \nhave the effect of denying prenatal care to future citizens. That, however, is the beginning, \nnot the end, of the analysis. We must also determine whether this unexpected result is \ncontrary to the clearly expressed intent of Congress. \n\nB \nIn the ordinary case, we would be reluctant to conclude that even an unexpected result \nconflicted with Congressional purpose. Here, however, the purpose of Congress in enacting \nOBRA '86 and the long history of Congressional treatment of prenatal care point decisively \nin a direction opposite to the one the Secretary urges. Accordingly, here we can confidently \nstate that denying prenatal care to non-PRUCOL women conflicts with Congress' intent. \nOBRA '86 was a budget reconciliation act. Congress' basic purpose was to \"achieve net \nexpenditure reductions\" while \"achiev[ing] certain program improvements.\" H.Rep. 99-727 \nat 68, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3658. The Secretary does not deny that providing \nprenatal care is cost effective. Indeed, that conclusion is intuitive. Studies have shown that \nevery dollar spent on prenatal care saves between two and ten dollars in future medical \ncare costs. See Committee to Study the Prevention of Low Birthweight, Institute of \nMedicine, Preventing Low Birthweight Summary 22 (1985) (every dollar spent on prenatal \ncare can save $3.38 in health care costs for low birth weight infants in the first year of life); \nH.Rep. No. 99-727, 99th Cong. 2d Sess. at 98, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3607, \n3688 (discussing Southern Governor's Regional Task Force on Infant Mortality's study \nfinding that one dollar of prenatal care saves between two and ten dollars in medical costs). \nIndeed, in other parts of OBRA '86, Congress relied on the cost effectiveness of prenatal \ncare in its decision to expand Medicaid coverage for prenatal care. See H.Rep. No. 99-727 \nat 130, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3719-20. See also H.Rep. No. 100-391, 100th Cong. 1st \nSess. at 437 (1987), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, pp. 2313-1, 2313-257. In short, there \ncan be little question that denying prenatal care to non-PRUCOL aliens undermines the \nclearly expressed Congressional purpose of curbing expenditures. \nOur conclusion that the Secretary's policy conflicts with Congressional purpose is further \nsolidified by the fact that Congress has over the years unequivocally expressed its desire to \ncontinue to expand access to prenatal care. In addition to the expansions in prenatal care \ndiscussed in Part I above, Congress has lifted the financial ceiling for optional Medicaid \ncoverage to pregnant women first to 100 percent of the poverty level, OBRA '86, § 9401, \nand later up to 185 percent of the poverty level. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1987, Pub.L. 100-203, § 4101, 101 Stat. 1330-31 (1987). Congress has also lifted the \nfinancial ceiling for mandatory coverage for pregnant women to 133 percent of the poverty \nlevel. P.L. 100-360 § 302(a), 102 Stat. 750-51 (1988). Thus, this case presents the \nextremely rare instance where we can discern a clearly expressed Congressional intent \ncontrary to the plain language of the statute. Had Congress realized the implications of the \nalien restriction, it would most certainly not have cut off prenatal care to non-PRUCOL \nwomen. In short, this is the rare case like Rose where refusing to extend a broad statutory \nprohibition to a situation Congress did not foresee is necessary in order to avoid impeding a \nclearly expressed Congressional purpose. \nIn reaching this conclusion, we necessarily reject the claim that Congress, had it realized \nthe implications of the alienage restriction, would have concluded that immigration policy \nrequired barring the provision of prenatal care to non-PRUCOL aliens. While we express no \nview on whether Congress could, constitutionally, make such a choice, we do note that \n\"legislation directing the onus of a parent's misconduct against his children does not \ncomport with fundamental conceptions of justice.\" 1220*1220 Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, \n\n220, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 2396, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982). Accordingly, we are unwilling to over-\nride Congress' clearly expressed intention to curb expenditures by expanding prenatal care \nwithout more persuasive indicia of Congressional intent than are present here. Cf. Doe v. \nReivitz, 830 F.2d 1441, 1445 (7th Cir.1987) (\"we must not lose sight of the fact that the \nagency's policy is to deny, solely on the basis that their parents are illegal aliens, AFDC-UP \nbenefits to children who are U.S. citizens.... To hold this practice valid, we must therefore \nfind that the impact on children comports with the language of the statute and with the intent \nof the legislature.\"), amended, 842 F.2d 194 (7th Cir.1988). \nIV \nThe Secretary contends, however, that even if we disagree that the plain language compels \nthe course that the Secretary has taken, and even if we discern an intent contrary to the one \nthat the Secretary has found, nonetheless the Secretary's interpretation of the statute must \nbe affirmed so long as it is a permissible construction of the statute. See Chevron U.S.A., \nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d \n694 (1984). \nHowever, it is not clear here precisely what position of the Secretary this court ought to \ndefer to. The Secretary points to a response to a comment published in the federal register. \nThe commentator asked whether non-PRUCOL pregnant women could receive Medicaid \nbenefits for prenatal care, and the Secretary responded that they could not. 55 Fed.Reg. \n36,816 (1990). However, this response, coming while plaintiff's motion for a permanent \ninjunction was pending, is the sort of post hoc litigation posture that is entitled to no \ndeference. See Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U.S. 204, 212-13, 109 S.Ct. 468, \n473-74, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988). \nThe Secretary responds that he could not possibly have taken a position before the litigation \ncommenced, since this litigation produced OBRA '86 which in turn, the Secretary claims, \nauthorized the bar on prenatal care. Nonetheless, the Secretary has not explained why he \nfailed to publish this policy until 1990. Neither the 1988 proposed regulations implementing \nOBRA '86, 53 Fed.Reg. 38,032 (1988), nor the 1987 final regulations implementing DRA '84 \nand COBRA '85, 52 Fed.Reg. 43,063 (1987), take any position on the effect of OBRA '86 on \nthe eligibility of non-PRUCOL women for prenatal care. \nIf anything, the 1987 regulations seem to indicate that OBRA '86 does not bar such \ncoverage. In the 1987 regulations, the Secretary took the position that \"[i]n determining \nwhether a woman would be eligible under the provisions of section [1396d](n)(1)(C) of the \nAct, State Medicaid agencies must apply only the financial eligibility criteria of the State's \napproved AFDC plan.\" Id. at 43,065. Thus, after this litigation had commenced, and after \nOBRA '86, the Secretary published a position inconsistent with the one he offers now. While \nthis alone is not enough to defeat the Secretary's claim of deference, see Rust v. Sullivan, \n___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), it does undermine the Secretary's \nclaim that the 1990 position is anything more than a litigation posture. \nFinally, while we are mindful of the general rule that in interpreting a statute of this \ncomplexity, the agency's position carries special weight, DeJesus, 770 F.2d at 327, here the \nagency's position is not based on any expertise in the statute's realm. Rather, the only \n\njustification that this health agency offers is that \"immigration policy\" requires precluding \nnon-PRUCOL pregnant women from receiving prenatal care. Surely the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services has no special expertise in deciding what makes good immigration \npolicy, the province of a wholly separate executive department. See Hampton v. Mow Sun \nWong, 426 U.S. 88, 116, 96 S.Ct. 1895, 1911, 48 L.Ed.2d 495 (1976) (Civil Service \nCommission not entitled to deference in determining constitutionality of regulation excluding \nall aliens from civil service). We note that we have no indication that the 1221*1221 \nAttorney General, who bears primary responsibility for immigration policy, has ever taken a \nposition favoring denial of prenatal care to non-PRUCOL pregnant women. Accordingly, \nthere is no need in this case to give special weight to the Secretary's interpretation of the \nact. \nConclusion \nAfter examining the legislative history and the statutory context of OBRA '86, we conclude \nthat Congress did not intend to prevent otherwise eligible pregnant women from receiving \nprenatal care to benefit their future citizen children. Further, we conclude that the \nSecretary's determination to the contrary is not entitled to deference. Finally, since the case \ncan be resolved on statutory grounds, we express no opinion on plaintiffs' constitutional \nchallenge. Accordingly, the decision of the district court is affirmed. \nON PETITION FOR REHEARING \nFor the reasons stated below, the Secretary's petition for rehearing is denied. \nThe Secretary contends that our decision, \"by its own terms, directly violates a host of black \nletter rules of statutory construction which the Supreme Court has unequivocally reaffirmed \nin no less than five different cases decided within the past year.\" Upon review, we conclude \nthat the Secretary mistakes grey for black, as the cases which he cites — first brought to \nour attention now on petition for rehearing — do not dictate a contrary result than the one \nwe have reached. Indeed, they are inapposite. \nRelying primarily on Union Bank v. Wolas, ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 527, 116 L.Ed.2d 514 \n(1991); Ardestani v. INS, ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 515, 116 L.Ed.2d 496 (December 10, \n1991); Toibb v. Radloff, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 2197, 115 L.Ed.2d 145 (1991); and West \nVirginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 \n(1991), the Secretary argues that we are limited to the plain language of OBRA '86 in giving \nthe Medicaid Act its proper construction. As we explicitly stated in our opinion, were this an \nordinary case of statutory construction, we would agree. See op. at 1215 (\"In the usual \ncase, where the language of the statute is clear, that is the end of the analysis.\"). However, \nthis is not, by any means, an ordinary case. \nWe have found no decisions, including those relied upon by the Secretary, which hold that \nthe plain meaning of a statute invariably controls its construction — regardless of the self-\ndefeating and harmful consequences that would ensue. To the contrary, the Secretary \nconcedes, as he must, see Secretary's Petition for Rehearing at 6, that a statute's \"plain \nmeaning\" is not an absolute command to be blindly followed in every case. \n\nIn Ardestani v. INS, 112 S.Ct. at 520, cited by the Secretary, the Supreme Court recently \ncharacterized the plain meaning rule as a \"`strong presumption,'\" stating: \"The `strong \npresumption' that the plain language of the statute expresses congressional intent is \nrebutted only in `rare and exceptional circumstances,' ... when a contrary legislative intent is \nclearly expressed.\" Id. (citations omitted). See also, United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, \nInc., 489 U.S. 235, 242, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 1031, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989) (\"The plain meaning \nof legislation should be conclusive, except in the `rare cases [in which] the literal application \nof a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters'\") \n(quoting, Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 571, 102 S.Ct. 3245, 3250, 73 \nL.Ed.2d 973 (1982)); INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 432, n. 12, 107 S.Ct. 1207, \n1213, n. 12, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (\"we look to the legislative history to determine only \nwhether there is `clearly expressed legislative intention' contrary to that language, which \nwould require us to question the strong presumption that Congress expresses its intent \nthrough the language it chooses\"); Rubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, 430, 101 S.Ct. \n698, 701, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981) (\"When we find the terms of a statute unambiguous, \njudicial inquiry is complete, except `in \"rare and exceptional circumstances.\"'\") (quoting, \nTVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 187, n. 33, 1222*1222 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2298, n. 33, 57 L.Ed.2d \n117 (1978)). Thus, in a particular case, where \"rare and exceptional\" circumstances exist, \nthe plain language of a statute may not be controlling. \nSimilarly, in Union Bank v. Wolas, 112 S.Ct. at 530, the Court remarked that \"[g]iven the \nclarity of the statutory text, respondent's burden of persuading us that Congress intended to \ncreate or preserve a special rule for long-term debt is exceptionally heavy.\" Id. (emphasis \nadded). We note that where there is a burden there is a possibility, however slim, of moving \na court to consider legislative history. Thus, we do not read Union Bank to prohibit a court \nfrom ever looking beyond the text of the statute when construing its unambiguous language. \nIndeed, in Union Bank, the Court did not reflexively adhere to the plain meaning of the \nchallenged provision in the 1978 Bankruptcy Code. Instead, the Court examined the \nlegislative history to see if it exhibited a manifest intent contrary to the Code's actual \nlanguage. Upon review, the Court found that Congress had thoughtfully considered the full \nrange of the implications that would stem from its actions and, therefore, the statute's clear \nlanguage governed its interpretation. \"[T]he fact that Congress carefully reexamined and \nentirely rewrote the preference provision in 1978 support[ed] the conclusion that the text of \n§ 547(c)(2) as enacted reflects the deliberate choice of Congress.\" Id., op. at 532. However, \nas we discuss at some length in our opinion, see op. at 1215-1218, we are convinced that \nCongress did not similarly have a comprehensive view of the relevant statutory scheme \nwhen it passed the blanket alienage restriction of OBRA '86. \nIn Toibb v. Radloff, supra, the Court cited as one of its reasons for refusing to look behind \nthe clear terms contained in Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code the \"scant history on th[e] \nprecise issue,\" which did \"not suggest a `clearly expressed legislative inten[t] ... contrary ...' \nto the plain language of § 109(d).\" Id., 111 S.Ct. at 2200. The difference between Toibb and \nthe present case, on this point, could not be greater. Here, the legislative history is \nabundant, and leads inexorably to the conclusion \"that Congress has over the years \nunequivocally expressed its intent to continue to expand access to pre-natal care.\" Op. at \n1219. This expression of congressional intent, as it pertains to newborns who will be United \n\nStates citizens at birth, directly conflicts with the plain language of OBRA '86, and thus \nwarrants further inquiry into the statute's meaning. \nFurthermore, Toibb suggests appropriately that where enforcement of a statute's \nunambiguous language would inflict an apparently uncontemplated harm upon a legally \nprotected class, recourse to the legislative history may be had in determining the statute's \ntrue goal. The Court stated: \"Absent some showing of harm to the creditors of a \nnonbusiness debtor allowed to reorganize under Chapter 11, we see nothing in the \nallocation of `burdens' and benefits of Chapter 11 that warrants an inference that Congress \nintended to exclude a consumer debtor from its coverage.\" Id., 111 S.Ct. at 2201. Given \nCongress' avowed commitment to providing funds for prenatal care, its stated concern for \nthe healthy development of fetuses, and the congressionally recognized magnitude of harm \nthat will be inflicted on fetuses by depriving them of prenatal care — in this case, harm to \nchildren virtually all of whom will become United States citizens and thereby eligible to \nreceive Medicaid — we think Toibb supports our method of statutory construction. \nFinally, we find West Virginia Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, supra, wholly distinguishable. In that \ncase, the Court reversed an award of expert witness fees granted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1988, since the statute merely allowed for a prevailing party to recoup \"a reasonable \nattorney's fee.\" The Court rejected the argument that because Congress had passed and \namended other fee shifting statutes to include expert fees after the passage of § 1988, the \nplain language of § 1988 should be judicially expanded to cover \"expert fees.\" The \nargument continued that since \"Congress simply forgot\" to address § 1988's initial failure to \nprovide for expert 1223*1223 fees, it is the court's \"duty to ask how they would have \ndecided had they actually considered the question.\" Id., 111 S.Ct. at 1148. \nThe Court condemned this line of reasoning as judicial \"usurpation\" of legislative \nprerogative. Id. It stated: \nWhere what is at issue is not a contradictory disposition within the same enactment, but \nmerely a difference between the more parsimonious policy of an earlier enactment and the \nmore generous policy of a later one, there is no more basis for saying that the earlier \nCongress forgot than for saying that the earlier Congress felt differently. In such \ncircumstances, the attribution of forgetfulness rests in reality upon the judge's assessment \nthat the later statute contains the better disposition. \nId. \nWe agree. But what is at issue in the present case is exactly what was not at issue in West \nVirginia University Hospitals — \"a contradictory disposition within the same enactment.\" \nCongress has consistently extolled the cost-effectiveness of prenatal care for the reason \nthat it invariably costs more to treat the hardships of birth defects post-natally than it does to \nlimit or totally prevent them in utero. By broadly funding prenatal care, Congress has \nrationally embraced the wisdom of preventive medicine. In construing Congress' intent with \nrespect to the alienage restriction, we cannot forget that OBRA '86 was itself enacted as \nbudget reduction legislation and, to further that goal, it explicitly expanded access to \nprenatal care by lifting the financial ceiling for optional Medicaid coverage to pregnant \n\nwomen. See, OBRA '86, § 9401, slip op. at 1219. By reducing budgetary costs, the general \nexclusion of aliens from Medicaid, pursuant to the restriction, makes economic sense. Thus, \nit is consistent with the enactment's goal. However, it makes no sense, and is wholly \ninconsistent with the Congress' intentions, to preclude fetuses of alien mothers from \nreceiving prenatal care. At the moment of their birth in this country, these children become \nUnited States citizens and will be eligible for Medicaid. See eligibility discussion at op. 1217-\n1218. As Congress was aware, at that point the medical neglect that these children suffered \nduring their mothers' pregnancies will come home to roost in the health care system, at \nexponentially higher costs. See op. at 1219. Thus, to apply the alien restriction of OBRA '86 \nto fetuses would be internally inconsistent with the statute's intended purpose. Nothing in \nWest Virginia University Hospitals mandates that we do so. \nIn short, this is that \"rare and exceptional circumstance\" where the particular application of \nthe Medicaid Act's alienage restriction urged by the Secretary would fly in the face of \nlegislative history, see Ardestani, 112 S.Ct. at 520; Ron Pair Enterprises, 489 U.S. at 242, \n109 S.Ct. at 1031, and would create affirmative harms that Congress — through legislative \nendeavors over the past 10 years, including the specific statute at issue — has continually \nsought to alleviate. See Toibb, 111 S.Ct. at 2201. By recognizing that Congress, in its \ngeneral alien restriction on Medicaid, did not intend to bar prenatal care for fetuses who in \nall likelihood will become citizens of this country, we do not undermine congressional intent \nas embodied in a broad statutory proscription. Rather, we define the proscription so as to \ngive effect to clear congressional purpose. While our decision may be viewed as \nrecognizing an exception to the OBRA '86 alienage restriction, see Rose v. Rose, 481 U.S. \n619, 634, 107 S.Ct. 2029, 2038, 95 L.Ed.2d 599 (1987) (discussed in depth supra, op. at \n1215-1216), it may also be viewed as recognizing that the intent of that restriction pertains \nonly to medical services for aliens, including alien mothers — not to services intended for \nthe needed care of putative future United States citizens. \nContrary to the Secretary's characterization, this construction of the law does not represent \n\"judicial legislation\" in derogation of the judicial function. As the Court made evident in \nRose, it is precisely the judicial function to render an internally inconsistent statute \nmeaningful — not based 1224*1224 upon what the judge thinks best, but upon what \nCongress clearly intended. We note that under these circumstances, it remains \n\"emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\" \nMarbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch.) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). \nAccordingly, we deny the Secretary's petition for rehearing. \n ",

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge. \nThe principal issues on this appeal are whether Congress, in enacting in 1996 what is \nusually called the Welfare Reform Act (\"the Act\"),[1] prohibited most female illegal \n(technically \"unqualified\") aliens from receiving Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care, and, if \nso, whether that restriction is unconstitutional with respect to either the alien mothers or \ntheir United States citizen children. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices (\"Secretary\") appeals from the January 19, 2000, order of the District Court for the \nEastern District of New York (Charles P. Sifton, District Judge), denying a motion to lift a \n\nlong-standing injunction barring the denial of prenatal care to these aliens. Lewis v. Grinker, \n111 F.Supp.2d 142 (E.D.N.Y.2000) (\"Lewis VI\"). The Court ruled that the Act should be \nread to deny prenatal care to unqualified aliens, but that this denial is unconstitutional under \nthe Supreme Court's reasoning in Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 223-24, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 \nL.Ed.2d 786 (1982). \nAlthough we agree with the Court's interpretation of the Act, we conclude that the denial of \nprenatal care is not unconstitutional. However, we also conclude, in agreement with the \nDistrict Court, that citizen children of alien mothers are entitled to automatic eligibility for \nMedicaid benefits for a year after birth equivalent to the automatic eligibility extended to the \ncitizen children of citizen mothers. We therefore reverse the District Court's order holding \nthe statute unconstitutional as applied to prenatal care, and remand to the Court to modify \nthe injunction so that it requires the Secretary only to enable the citizen children of \nunqualified alien mothers to obtain automatic Medicaid eligibility on the same basis as the \ncitizen children of citizen mothers. \nBackground \nThe injunction at issue was imposed in 1987, in litigation that began in 1979. As we \nrecognized on the prior appeal in this litigation, Lewis v. Grinker, 965 F.2d 1206 (2d \nCir.1992) (\"Lewis V\")[2], the prenatal care provisions of the Medicaid statute are among the \nmost complex in a statute that is one of the \"most intricate ever drafted by Congress.\" Id. at \n1216 (internal quotation marks omitted). Understanding the parties' contentions therefore \nrequires a regrettably detailed review of the lengthy history of this action, as well as the \nevolution of Medicaid law as it pertains to prenatal care and aliens. \nI. The Framework of Medicaid \nMedicaid is a \"co-operative federal/state cost-sharing program designed to enable \nparticipating states to furnish medical assistance to persons whose income and resources \nare insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical care and services.\" DeJesus v. \nPerales, 770 F.2d 316, 318 (2d Cir.1985). State participation in Medicaid is optional, but \nonce a state chooses to participate, it must comply with federal statutes and regulations. \nThe basic framework of the Medicaid program has changed little since its inception in 1965. \nStates submit \"plans for medical assistance\" to the Department of 570*570 Health and \nHuman Services (\"HHS\"). 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a(a), (b) (West 1992 & Supp.2000).[3] If the \nplan is approved, the federal government partially reimburses the state for the state's \nexpenditures in subsidizing medical services for needy citizens covered by its plan. \nStates enjoy some flexibility in determining the breadth of a Medicaid plan, but are \nnonetheless cabined by a set of eligibility rules. The class of individuals eligible for Medicaid \nbenefits comprises three categories: the \"mandatory categorically needy,\" the \"optional \ncategorically needy,\" and the \"optional medically needy.\" \nAt a minimum, participating states must extend their Medicaid coverage to the \"mandatory \ncategorically needy.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i); 42 C.F.R. § 435.110. This category \n\nprincipally includes individuals already receiving some other need-based government \nbenefit, most commonly Aid to Families with Dependent Children (\"AFDC\"). 42 U.S.C.A. § \n1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(I). \nA state may, but need not, expand the ambit of its plan beyond the mandatory categorically \nneedy. It can do so in two ways. First, a state can include those who qualify as \"optional \ncategorically needy.\" Id. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii); 42 C.F.R. § 435.200. The \"optional \ncategorically needy\" must meet two prerequisites. They must be individuals in listed groups \nsuch as the elderly, the blind, and the disabled, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396d(a), people who are \nlikely to be uniquely vulnerable or in need of medical supervision. In addition, with a few \nexceptions, they must meet the \"income and resource requirements\" for some other form of \ngovernment aid, such as AFDC. 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(I)-(VIII). These \nindividuals need not be receiving such aid (if they were, they would qualify as \"mandatory \ncategorically needy\"). One group within the \"optional categorically needy\" that becomes \nspecially important to this litigation are \"individuals ... under the age of 21.\" Id. § \n1396d(a)(i).[4] \nSecond, a state may extend its Medicaid plan further to encompass the \"optional medically \nneedy.\" This category includes the same groups of vulnerable individuals who qualify as \n\"optional categorically needy,\" but offers a higher income and resources ceiling. 42 \nU.S.C.A. § 1396a(a)(10)(C); 42 C.F.R. § 435.301. \nNew York joined Medicaid in 1965 by adopting a plan extending coverage to all three \neligibility categories. See ch. 256, 1966 N.Y. Laws, codified as amended, N.Y. Soc. Serv. \nLaw §§ 363-69 (McKinney 1992 & Supp.2000). \nII. 1965 to 1979: Medicaid Developments \nA. Coverage of Prenatal Care \nFor some time, it was unclear whether states must, or even may, extend Medicaid coverage \nto prenatal care. Although the program has long covered many different forms of medical \nassistance, including hospital visits and physicians' services, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396d(a), the \neligibility of pregnant women for any aid was not self-evident from the statute. As explained \n571*571 above, aside from special coverage for the elderly, the blind, and other particularly \nneedy groups, Medicaid coverage is principally tied to eligibility for another form of \ngovernment aid, usually AFDC, and a woman, pregnant for the first time, was not clearly \ncovered by these programs. \nWhen first enacted, the Medicaid statute was silent as to coverage for pregnant women. \nHowever, prior to the enactment of Medicaid, the Secretary permitted states to offer AFDC \nassistance to a pregnant woman under the theory that her fetus qualified as a \"dependent \nchild\" under AFDC.[5] For a period of time after the advent of Medicaid, states could offer \nMedicaid to pregnant women if they were receiving AFDC assistance under this theory. \nIn addition to this avenue, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (\"HEW\") \n(predecessor to HHS) permitted states to offer Medicaid benefits for prenatal care on the \n\ntheory that unborn fetuses were \"individuals under the age of 21\" and therefore qualified as \n\"optional categorically needy.\" Lewis v. Grinker, No. CV 79-1740, 1987 WL 8412, at *7-*9 \n(E.D.N.Y.1987) (\"Lewis III\"). This approach regarded the (otherwise ineligible) woman as a \nconduit for furnishing medical assistance to the eligible fetus. \nB. Eligibility of Aliens \nThe 1965 Medicaid statute was also silent on the availability of Medicaid to aliens.[6] HEW at \nfirst read the statute to permit states to offer Medicaid assistance to aliens. However, in \n1973, Congress amended the Social Security Act to explicitly deny social security benefits \nto aliens. Pub.L. No. 92-603, § 301, 86 Stat. 1329, 1471 (1972). The Secretary apparently \ntook this to evince a congressional desire to withdraw all federally subsidized benefits from \naliens, and promptly issued a regulation denying Medicaid eligibility to any alien who was \nnot a permanent resident or \"otherwise permanently residing in the United States under \ncolor of law.\"[7] 38 Fed.Reg. 30,259 (1973), reprinted in Lewis V, 965 F.2d at 1212. This \nlatter status, for which the acronym PRUCOL is used, is an amorphous and \"elastic\" one, \n572*572 but this Court has read it to include at least those aliens who are residing in the \nUnited States with the INS's knowledge and permission and whom the INS does not \ncontemplate deporting. Berger v. Heckler, 771 F.2d 1556, 1575-76 (2d Cir. 1985); see also \n42 C.F.R. § 435.408 (defining PRUCOL and listing fifteen non-exclusive examples of non-\nPRUCOL aliens). \nIII. 1979 to 1985: Lewis I and Medicaid Developments \nA. Filing of the Complaint \nThus, by 1979, although the Medicaid statute was silent as to both prenatal care and aliens, \nthe Secretary read it to permit states to offer prenatal care to pregnant women, but not to \npermit states to offer any aid to non-PRUCOL aliens. In that context, Plaintiff Lydia Lewis \nfiled this class action in 1979. She filed the claim on behalf of a putative class initially \ncertified to include \"all aliens residing in the State of New York who have been denied \nMedicaid on the basis of their alienage,\" Lewis VI, 111 F.Supp.2d at 147 n. 7 (internal \nquotation marks omitted), thus challenging the denial of Medicaid benefits to non-PRUCOL \naliens. This class was certified on January 16, 1981.[8] \nThe Plaintiffs challenged the Secretary's alienage regulation on several grounds, but their \nprincipal claim was that the denial of all Medicaid services on the basis of alienage was \neither contrary to the Medicaid statute or unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection. \nThey also argued the narrower proposition that the denial of prenatal care to pregnant \naliens (and their unborn fetuses) was invalid. See Lewis VI, 111 F.Supp.2d. at 148 \n(recounting prior history of litigation). \nB. Statutory Changes \nDuring the early pretrial stages of this litigation, Medicaid underwent several changes \nrelevant to the case. \n\n1. OBRA '81 \nFirst, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (\"OBRA '81\"), \nPub.L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 357 (1981). This statute ended the Secretary's practice of \nallowing states to give AFDC money to pregnant women on the theory that their fetuses \nwere \"dependent children,\" id. § 2312(b), 95 Stat. at 853, but nonetheless authorized states \nto provide a pregnant woman with AFDC funding during the last three months of pregnancy \nif she would be eligible upon the birth of her child, id. § 2312(a), 95 Stat. at 853. In the same \nprovision, Congress permitted states to treat such a woman as participating in AFDC for \npurposes of Medicaid—and therefore as \"mandatory categorically needy\"—but without the \nthree-month limitation. Id. § 2312(a), codified as amended at 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396d(n)(1)(A). \nShe would therefore be eligible for Medicaid throughout her pregnancy. The concept that \nunderlies deeming a woman eligible for government benefits if she would be eligible upon \nthe birth of her child has become known as \"constructive birth.\" \nOBRA '81 opened another avenue to states wishing to extend Medicaid coverage to \npregnant women. The statute required states that chose to provide Medicaid to the \"optional \nmedically needy\" also to provide aid to needy pregnant women. Id. § 2171(a), codified as \namended at 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a(a)(10)(C)(ii). Thus, OBRA '81 gave states two additional \navenues by which they could offer Medicaid to 573*573 pregnant women, but states were \nnot required to do so.[9] \nIn the period after OBRA '81, the Secretary appears to have continued permitting states to \noffer prenatal care on the theory that fetuses are \"individuals under the age of 21,\" and \ntherefore qualify as \"optional categorically needy.\" Lewis III, 1987 WL 8412, at *9. \n2. DRA '84 \nThree years after OBRA '81, Congress made Medicaid coverage of needy pregnant women \nmandatory by adding \"qualified pregnant women or children\" to the list of \"mandatory \ncategorically needy.\" Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (\"DRA '84\"), Pub.L. No. 98-369, § \n2361(a), 98 Stat. 494, 1104 (1984), codified as amended at 42 U.S.C.A. § \n1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(III). Congress preserved the \"constructive birth\" approach of OBRA '81 \nby defining \"qualified pregnant woman or child\" to mean any woman medically verified as \npregnant who would be eligible for AFDC \"if her child had been born and was living with her \nin the month such aid would be paid.\" Id. § 2361(b), codified as amended at 42 U.S.C.A. § \n1396d(n)(1)(A). \nThe DRA '84 also added an \"automatic eligibility\" provision to Medicaid in order to expedite \nthe provision of federally sponsored post-natal care to newborns. The statute provided that \na child born to a woman on Medicaid would automatically receive Medicaid assistance for a \nyear following the child's birth so long as the mother remained Medicaid-eligible and the \nchild continued living with her. Id. § 2362(a), codified as amended at 42 U.S.C.A. § \n1396a(e)(4). \n3. COBRA '85 \n\nA year later, Congress again expanded Medicaid funding for pregnant women. In the \nConsolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (\"COBRA '85\"), Congress broke \nthe link between AFDC and Medicaid, permitting a pregnant woman to receive Medicaid \nassistance even if she would be ineligible for AFDC for some non-financial reason upon the \nbirth of her child, so long as she met the financial and resource requirements for AFDC \neligibility. Pub.L. No. 99-272, § 9501(a), 100 Stat. 82, 202 (1986), codified at 42 U.S.C.A. § \n1396d(n)(1)(C); 52 Fed.Reg. 43,065 (1987). So, for example, a needy pregnant woman who \nwas living with her employed husband would not have been eligible for AFDC (which \nrequired that the eligible child be \"deprived of parental support,\" 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 606 & \n607(a)), but would have been eligible for Medicaid after OBRA '85. \nC. The Decision in Lewis I \nOn July 14, 1986, Judge Sifton ruled that the Secretary's regulation barring non-PRUCOL \naliens from receiving any Medicaid benefits violated the Medicaid statute. Lewis I, 663 \nF.Supp. at 1184. Judge Sifton therefore did not then have occasion to consider the \nPlaintiffs' narrower argument that the denial of prenatal benefits to non-PRUCOL aliens was \nunlawful. \nIV. 1986-1992: Lewis II-Lewis V and Medicaid \nDevelopments \n1. OBRA '86 \nSoon after Judge Sifton issued his ruling in Lewis I, Congress responded[10] by amending \nthe Medicaid statute to bar aid 574*574 to non-PRUCOL aliens[11] for any condition short of \na medical emergency. See The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (\"OBRA '86\"), \nPub.L. No. 99-509, 100 Stat. 1874, 2057 (1986).[12] The statute defined an \"emergency \nmedical condition\" to mean: \na medical condition (including emergency labor and delivery) manifesting itself by acute \nsymptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate \nmedical attention could reasonably be expected to result in— \n(A) placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy, \n(B) serious impairment to bodily functions, or \n(C) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. \nOBRA '86, § 9406(a), 100 Stat. at 2058, codified at 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396b(v)(3). \nEven as it narrowed the access of aliens to Medicaid, OBRA '86 once again expanded \ncoverage of prenatal care, creating a new \"optional categorically needy\" group for pregnant \nwomen seeking \"services related to pregnancy.\" See OBRA '86, § 9401(a), 100 Stat. at \n2050, codified as amended at 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) & (l)(1). This new \n\ncategory offered more flexible financial eligibility ceilings than had the earlier provisions for \npregnant women. \n2. From Lewis II to Lewis IV \nIn light of the new alienage restrictions in OBRA '86, the Secretary moved to vacate the \nLewis I injunction. The Plaintiffs argued in opposition that OBRA '86 should not be given \nretroactive effect, and that the ruling in Lewis I should therefore support relief for denials of \nprenatal care made before January 1, 1987, the effective date of OBRA '86. \nOn April 23, 1987, the District Court rejected the Secretary's request to vacate the Lewis I \ninjunction, concluding that members of the plaintiff class were still entitled to relief for the \nperiod before January 1, 1987. Lewis v. Grinker, 660 F.Supp. 169 (E.D.N.Y.1987) (\"Lewis \nII\").[13] \n575*575 However, the proceedings were far from over. Some time earlier, the Secretary \nhad prepared an internal agency directive ordering that non-PRUCOL aliens be deemed \nineligible for prenatal care. The Plaintiffs asked the Court to declare the directive illegal and \nenjoin its enforcement. The Plaintiffs' theory was that the fetuses of even non-PRUCOL \nwomen were still optionally eligible for Medicaid as \"individuals under the age of 21.\" 42 \nU.S.C.A. § 1396d(a)(1). They argued in the alternative that the directive was \nunconstitutional. \nOn March 5, 1987, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining \nimplementation of the directive. Lewis III, 1987 WL 8412, at *12. The Court concluded that, \nbecause the Secretary had, at least until that point, continued to consider fetuses as \n\"individuals under the age of 21,\" federally subsidized medical assistance was available to \nthese fetuses in the form of prenatal care under the \"optional categorically needy\" category \nof Medicaid. Id. at *9. The Court declined to permit the Secretary to abandon this long-\nstanding administration interpretation in a litigation position, and ruled that the existing \ninterpretation must prevail unless Congress had clearly altered it. Judge Sifton found no \nsuch change in the alienage restriction in OBRA '86, in part because an unborn fetus, which \nwill become a United States citizen at birth,[14] is not clearly a non-PRUCOL alien. Id. at *8. \nJudge Sifton also noted that Congress had steadily expanded Medicaid coverage for \nprenatal care in OBRA '86 itself. Id. at *9. \nOn March 14, 1991, the District Court issued a permanent injunction forbidding the \nSecretary from denying prenatal care to non-PRUCOL aliens. Lewis v. Grinker, 794 F.Supp. \n1193 (E.D.N.Y.1991) (\"Lewis IV\"). Since the issuance of the preliminary injunction, the \nSecretary had formally renounced his interpretation that \"individuals under the age of 21\" \nincluded fetuses. Judge Sifton therefore abandoned his earlier deference to the Secretary's \nlong-standing interpretation of the \"under the age of 21\" provision and considered the \nprovision anew. Id. at 1197. \nJudge Sifton concluded that Congress had evidenced a desire since 1981 to focus on the \nmother in determining eligibility for delivering medical assistance to newborns, and that the \n\"under the age of 21\" provision therefore could no longer be read to include the unborn. Id. \nat 1198. \n\nNevertheless, Judge Sifton found the Secretary's directive denying prenatal care to non-\nPRUCOL aliens invalid on another ground. He turned to the provision of the Deficit \nReduction Act of 1984 that added \"qualified pregnant women\" to the list of mandatory \ncategorical needy, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(III), and noted that the definition of \n\"qualified pregnant woman,\" id. § 1396d(n), is keyed to the woman's eligibility for AFDC \nupon the child's birth. However, the woman's eligibility for AFDC turns on the child's \ncompliance with the prerequisites of coverage. And while there has long been an alienage \nrestriction for children seeking AFDC eligibility, see 42 U.S.C.A. § 602(a)(33), repealed by \nPub.L. No. 104-193, § 103(a)(1), 110 Stat. 2112 (1996), there is no such restriction for the \nmother who will be receiving money on her citizen child's behalf. Since the child will be an \nAmerican citizen at birth, Judge Sifton concluded, even a non-PRUCOL mother will be \neligible for AFDC upon the birth of her child, and 576*576 therefore will be a \"qualified \npregnant woman\" for purposes of Medicaid. See Lewis IV, 794 F.Supp. at 1199-1200. \nJudge Sifton found this result to be consistent with Congress's purpose in enacting OBRA \n'86, which was to reduce spending. Id. at 1201. Finally, Judge Sifton declined to consider \nthe Plaintiffs' constitutional challenge, but noted that his interpretation avoided serious \nconstitutional difficulties otherwise presented by the statute. Id. at 1202-04. \n3. Lewis V \nOn January 31, 1992, on the Secretary's appeal from Judge Sifton's permanent injunction, \nwe affirmed.[15] Lewis V, 965 F.2d at 1206. However, our statutory construction followed a \ndifferent path than that taken by Judge Sifton in either Lewis III or Lewis IV. We \nacknowledged that the plain text of OBRA '86 excluded non-emergency aid to non-\nPRUCOL aliens, and that prenatal care did not fall within the definition of an emergency \ncondition. Nevertheless, noting that the Medicaid Act is a statute of \"unparalleled \ncomplexity,\" and that \"few areas are more complex than the coverage of prenatal care,\" id. \nat 1216 (internal quotation marks omitted), and further noting the possibility that an \namendment in such a complex area might yield unforeseen results, we turned to the \nlegislative history to see if there was evidence that Congress contemplated the impact that \na literal application of the blanket alienage provision would have on eligibility for prenatal \ncare. \nFar from finding evidence that Congress considered the issue, we located \"direct evidence\" \nof congressional inattention.[16] See id. at 1216-18. Although we were reluctant to reject the \nclear direction of the statutory text, even if it produced an unexpected result, we concluded \nthat this was a special case for two reasons. First, the unexpected result in this case ran \ncounter to the clear purpose of the statute: to make government more cost-effective. We \nnoted in particular that Congress had increased access to government-sponsored prenatal \ncare in another portion of OBRA '86, as well as in other statutes over many years, explicitly \nto save money. Id. at 1219. \nSecond, we reasoned that to interpret OBRA '86 to deny prenatal care to non-PRUCOL \npregnant women \"would raise serious equal protection questions,\" since a 577*577 child \nborn to a citizen mother would receive \"automatic\" Medicaid eligibility under DRA '84, while \na child born to an unqualified alien mother seeking Medicaid would be denied Medicaid \neligibility. Id. at 1217-18; see also 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a(e)(4); 42 C.F.R. § 435.117. \n\nWe therefore concluded that this was one of those \"rare and exceptional\" circumstances \nwhere legislative intent and purpose should prevail over clear statutory text, and we \naffirmed the District Court's injunction. Lewis V, 965 F.2d at 1222 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nV. 1992 to the Present: Lewis VI and the Welfare \nReform Act \n1. The Welfare Reform Act \nIn the 1996 Welfare Reform Act, Congress altered the terrain of this case yet again by \nimposing sweeping restrictions on aliens' access to federally sponsored government aid. \nThe Act, as amended, provides: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law and except as provided in subsection (b) of this \nsection, an alien who is not a qualified alien (as defined in section 1641 of this title) is not \neligible for any Federal public benefit (as defined in subsection (c) of this section). \n8 U.S.C.A. § 1611(a). A \"qualified alien\" is narrowly defined as \nan alien who, at the time the alien applies for, receives, or attempts to receive a Federal \npublic benefit, is— \n(1) an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and \nNationality Act, \n(2) an alien who is granted asylum under section 208 of such Act, \n(3) a refugee who is admitted to the United States under section 207 of such Act, \n(4) an alien who is paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5) of such Act for a \nperiod of at least 1 year, \n(5) an alien whose deportation is being withheld under section 243(h) of such Act ...[,] \n(6) an alien who is granted conditional entry pursuant to section 203(a)(7) of such Act as in \neffect prior to April 1, 1980[,] or \n(7) an alien who is a Cuban and Haitian entrant (as defined in section 501(e) of the Refugee \nEducation Assistance Act of 1980). \nId. § 1641(b) (citations omitted).[17] An unqualified alien cannot receive any federally \nsponsored aid, with only a few explicit exceptions.[18] The first of these exceptions is for \nMedicaid assistance for an \"emergency medical condition.\" Id. § 1611(b)(1)(A).[19] The \nWelfare Reform Act retained the definition of \"emergency 578*578 medical conditions\" from \nOBRA '86. See 8 U.S.C.A. § 1611(b)(1)(A); 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396b(v)(3). \n\nThe definition of \"qualified aliens\" excludes many PRUCOL aliens who were eligible for \nMedicaid under OBRA '86,[20] and the Welfare Reform Act therefore expanded the class of \naliens who are largely ineligible for Medicaid (except for emergency care). Under OBRA '86, \nonly non-PRUCOL aliens were denied non-emergency Medicaid assistance. After the \nWelfare Reform Act, all non-PRUCOL aliens plus a sizable class of PRUCOL aliens are \ndenied non-emergency Medicaid assistance. \nEspecially pertinent to the pending appeal, the legislative history of the Act explicitly reveals \nCongress's understanding that conventional prenatal care does not qualify as aid for an \n\"emergency medical condition.\" In discussing the alienage restrictions in the bill, the House \nConference Report emphasizes: \nThe allowance for emergency medical services under Medicaid is very narrow. The \nconferees intend that it only apply to medical care that is strictly of an emergency nature, \nsuch as medical treatment administered in an emergency room, critical care unit, or \nintensive care unit. The conferees do not intend that emergency medical services include \npre-natal or delivery care assistance that is not strictly of an emergency nature as specified \nherein. \nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-725, at 380 (1996) (emphasis added), reprinted in 1996 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2649, 2768. \n2. Lewis VI \nAfter enactment of the Welfare Reform Act, the Secretary once again asked the District \nCourt to reconsider its injunction. Judge Sifton denied the request. Lewis VI, 111 F.Supp.2d \nat 144. He agreed with the Secretary that Congress had now made clear its intent to deny \nfederally subsidized prenatal care to illegal aliens, and that the considerations identified by \nthis Court in Lewis V that had warranted a departure from the prior statutory text were no \nlonger applicable. Id. at 155-63. \nFinding the statute clear, the District Court then had to consider the Plaintiffs' challenge to \nthe constitutionality of the denial of prenatal care to alien mothers. Ruling that at least some \nmembers of the plaintiff class had standing to assert the third-party rights of their newborn \ncitizen children, the Court noted that the statute was harming citizen children by visiting \nupon them debilitating conditions caused by a denial of prenatal care and by denying them \nautomatic newborn eligibility for Medicaid, and that both these consequences occurred only \nbecause of the alienage status of their parents. The Court then applied the heightened \nscrutiny of Plyler, id. at 169-82, in which the Supreme Court invalidated, for lack of a \n\"substantial\" rationale, a Texas statute that denied a free public education to children of \nillegal aliens, 457 U.S. at 224, 102 S.Ct. 2382. That statute, Plyler observed, \"impose[d] a \nlifetime hardship on a discrete class of children not accountable for their disabling status.\" \nId. at 223, 102 S.Ct. 2382. \nNext, Judge Sifton considered the Secretary's rationales for the denial of Medicaid for \nprenatal care. Characterizing 579*579 them as \"highly speculative,\" Lewis VI, 111 \nF.Supp.2d at 184 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court concluded that the Secretary \nhad not met her burden of demonstrating substantial government purposes for the denial, \n\nand therefore invalidated the denial as violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment, see id. at 183-86. \nDiscussion \nI. Prenatal Care and Aliens \nBefore considering the Plaintiffs' challenge to the District Court's literal interpretation of the \nAct to deny prenatal Medicaid assistance to unqualified aliens and the Secretary's \nchallenge to the Court's ruling that the Act, thus interpreted, is unconstitutional, we set forth \nwhat the record discloses concerning the consequences of upholding the Secretary's \nposition. These circumstances affect at least the context in which the parties' claims must \nbe evaluated, and, to some extent, bear on the analysis of the claims themselves. \nFirst, affidavits submitted by the Plaintiffs suggest substantial harm to the children of alien \nmothers as a result of the Act. Children who are denied prenatal care are substantially more \nlikely to be born premature and with debilitating physical and mental disabilities, are more \nlikely to be plagued by an array of life-threatening diseases throughout their lives, and have \na much shorter life expectancy. Furthermore, studies link the success of a poor woman's \npregnancy and the health of her child to her eligibility for prenatal care under Medicaid. See \nDeclaration of Dr. Solan Chao ¶ 61, at 18. \nThe record also indicates that furnishing prenatal care is vastly more cost-effective than is \ntreating the medical ailments that result from a lack of prenatal care. Prenatal care usually \nconsists of a series of routine visits to a doctor, who monitors the health of the mother and \nthe fetus and counsels the mother on steps she can take to ensure the birth of a healthy \nchild. If problems are observed during prenatal monitoring, it is less expensive to intervene \nwhile the woman is pregnant than to treat the child's resulting life-long disabilities. See \nAffidavit of Dr. Victor W. Sidel ¶ 90, at 22. Studies estimate that anywhere from $2 to $10 \ncan be saved in medical treatment costs for every dollar spent on preventive prenatal care. \nSee Affidavit of Dr. Howard L. Minkoff ¶ 38-42, at 13-15; see also Chao Decl. ¶ 8, at 3. The \nNew York State Department of Health believes that the costs of furnishing prenatal care for \nthe more than 13,000 annual births to undocumented pregnant women in New York would \nbe almost completely recouped by the savings from the decrease in initial postnatal \nhospitalizations alone, without even considering the vast savings from not having to treat \nthese children's lifetime health problems that would have resulted from denial of prenatal \ncare. \nFinally, there may be substantial public health costs. During the 1980s, the infant mortality \nrate in this country was the highest among 22 industrialized countries. Approximately one \npercent of all babies in the United States died before their first birthday, and ten percent of \nall babies were born with low birth weight and were therefore much more susceptible to \ndisabilities. Incidents of post-natal death and disabilities were highly concentrated among \nthe poor in urban centers. After Congress increased the access of the poor to prenatal care \nin statutes like OBRA '81, COBRA '85, and OBRA '86, the rate of infant mortality steadily \nimproved: in 1980, 12.6 per 1,000 babies died before their first birthday, while by 1992, the \nrate had decreased to 8.5 per 1,000. In the opinion of at least one expert, denying illegal \n\naliens Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care risks abandoning more than a decade's \ninvestment in expanding access to 580*580 prenatal care in America's inner cities. See \nMinkoff Aff. ¶ 43, at 15. \nII. Statutory Interpretation \nRejecting the contention of the Plaintiffs, we agree with the Secretary and the District Court \nthat the Welfare Reform Act should be read to deny federally-sponsored prenatal care to \nunqualified aliens. \nExamining first the text of the statute, we note that section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act \nis unequivocal: a non-qualified alien \"is not eligible for any Federal public benefit\" unless \nshe meets one of the exceptions in subsection (b). 8 U.S.C.A. § 1611(a). The only \nexception that might conceivably apply to the plaintiff class is the first, which permits aid \nnecessary to treat an \"emergency medical condition.\" 8 U.S.C.A. § 1611(b)(1)(A). However, \nthe statute defines \"emergency medical condition\" so narrowly as to make clear that \nconventional prenatal care is not within the exception. 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396b(v)(3).[21] In \nLewis V we considered a similar blanket alienage restriction, containing exactly the same \nexception for \"an emergency medical condition,\" and concluded that the literal terms of the \nrestriction barred prenatal care. Lewis V, 965 F.2d at 1214-15. \nNevertheless, we declined to give the prior restriction a literal interpretation because of \nsubstantial doubt, revealed in the legislative history, that Congress understood the \nrestriction to extend to the unique circumstances of prenatal care. Id. at 1215. By contrast, \nthe legislative history of the Welfare Reform Act leaves no doubt that Congress intended its \nalienage restriction to apply to prenatal care. The House Conference Report expressly \nstates that \"[t]he conferees do not intend that emergency medical services include pre-natal \nor delivery care assistance that is not strictly of an emergency nature as specified herein.\" \nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-725, at 380, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2768.[22] The \nlegislative history confirms what the text clearly states: with a few narrow exceptions that do \nnot encompass prenatal care, Congress intended to deny all federally funded medical \nassistance to unqualified aliens. \nThe Plaintiffs' argument stresses legislative purpose. It is undisputed, they reason, that \nprenatal care on balance saves money. And there is no doubt that, as with many of its \npredecessor statutes, one of the principal purposes of the Welfare Reform Act was to \nreduce federal spending. See H.R.Rep. No. 104-651, at 9-10, reprinted in 1996 \nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2183, 2190-91. However, even if we were inclined to regard this as the only \npurpose of the Welfare Reform Act (and it is not),[23] 581*581 we cannot ignore clear text \nand clear intent on a specific topic to achieve a more general congressional purpose. See \nHashim v. INS, 936 F.2d 711, 712-13 (2d Cir.1991) (unambiguous statutory language can \nonly be displaced by clear legislative intent, and even then only in rare cases). \nThe Plaintiffs ask us to employ the canon of statutory interpretation requiring a narrow \nconstruction of a statute to avoid constitutional doubt, and argue that a narrow construction \npreserving coverage of prenatal care is available. It is still the case, the argument continues, \nthat section 1396d(n)(1) defines a (mandatorily) eligible \"qualified pregnant woman\" to \ninclude a woman who would meet the financial and resource requirements of the former \n\nAFDC program if her unborn fetus were born.[24] A woman is eligible for AFDC if her child is \neligible, and the alienage eligibility restrictions in the AFDC statute, which apply only to the \nchild, are inapposite since an alien mother's child born in this country is a United States \ncitizen. Therefore, the Plaintiffs' argument concludes, even an illegal alien mother should be \nentitled to receive prenatal care as a \"qualified pregnant woman\" under section 1396d(n)(1). \nThe reading suggested by the Plaintiffs is untenable. Their arguments might be valid if the \nMedicaid statute regarded the unborn fetus as itself eligible for medical assistance. \nHowever, section 1396d(n)(1) instead considers the pregnant mother to be the recipient of \nprenatal care for the benefit of the fetus, and determines eligibility with respect to the alien \nmother and not her constructively born citizen child. Section 1396d(n)(1) is therefore clearly \ntrumped by the new alienage restrictions, which deny eligibility to \"an alien who is not a \nqualified alien\" \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law.\" See 8 U.S.C.A. § 1611(a). \nSection 1611(a) denies eligibility to the pregnant woman \"notwithstanding\" section \n1396d(n)(1), which might otherwise be read to give her eligibility. Because the statute is \nclear, the canon of narrow construction to avoid constitutional doubt does not apply. Miller v. \nFrench, 530 U.S. 327, 341, 120 S.Ct. 2246, 147 L.Ed.2d 326 (2000). \nThe Plaintiffs also argue that there is no real difference between the statutory scheme now \nbefore us and the scheme we considered in Lewis V, and that the analysis of Lewis V \nshould therefore prevail. This ignores the rationale of Lewis V, where we were convinced by \nthe legislative history that Congress \"did not realize\" that the blanket alienage restriction in \nOBRA '86 would operate to deny illegal alien pregnant women prenatal care. Lewis V, 965 \nF.2d at 1216. The Welfare Reform Act reveals precisely what OBRA '86 lacked: a clear \nindication that Congress was aware of the consequences of a literal reading of its blanket \nalienage restriction to preclude prenatal care.[25] \n582*582 Because we interpret the statute to evince a clear congressional intent to deny \nfederally-sponsored prenatal care to unqualified aliens, we must turn to the plaintiff class's \nclaim that the Welfare Reform Act's alienage restrictions are unconstitutional as applied to \nprenatal care. \nIII. Plaintiffs' Constitutional Challenges to Denial of \nPrenatal Care \nThe Plaintiffs make two constitutional challenges to the denial of prenatal care. First, they \ncontend that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to themselves, i.e., unqualified alien \npregnant women. Second, they contend that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the \nchildren of unqualified aliens, who automatically become citizens upon birth. \nA. Constitutionality as Applied to the Plaintiffs \n1. Level of Scrutiny \nThe Plaintiffs acknowledge that, to the extent that they are asserting harm to themselves, \nrational basis is the appropriate level of scrutiny of the constitutionality of the denial of \n\nMedicaid assistance for prenatal care. That is the indisputable teaching of Mathews v. Diaz, \n426 U.S. 67, 79-80, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976), upholding the Government's \n\"broad power over naturalization and immigration,\" and Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306, \n113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993), clarifying that rational basis scrutiny applies to \nimmigration and naturalization regulation. \"[R]esponsibility for regulating the relationship \nbetween the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political \nbranches.\" Diaz, 426 U.S. at 81, 96 S.Ct. 1883. Congress can therefore validly enact laws \nfor aliens that \"would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.\" Id. at 80, 96 S.Ct. 1883. We \nhave recently recognized that a \"highly deferential\" standard is appropriate in matters of \nimmigration. Lake v. Reno, 226 F.3d 141, 148 (2d Cir.2000). \nWhere rational basis scrutiny applies, the Government \"has no obligation to produce \nevidence,\" or \"`empirical data'\" to \"sustain the rationality of a statutory classification,\" Heller \nv. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993) (quoting FCC v. Beach \nCommunications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315, 113 S.Ct. 2096, 124 L.Ed.2d 211 (1993)), and \ninstead can base its statutes on \"rational speculation,\" id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \n\"`[A]ny reasonably conceivable state of facts'\" will suffice to satisfy rational basis scrutiny. \nId. (quoting Beach Communications, 508 U.S. at 313, 113 S.Ct. 2096). The burden falls to \nthe party attacking the statute as unconstitutional to \"negative every conceivable basis \nwhich might support it.\" Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U.S. 83, 88, 60 S.Ct. 406, 84 L.Ed. 590 \n(1940). There need only be a \"rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and \nsome legitimate governmental purpose.\" Heller, 509 U.S. at 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637. \nNevertheless, the Plaintiffs contend, a heightened level of scrutiny is appropriate to the \nextent that the Plaintiffs are asserting the harm to the children they will bear. In this part of \ntheir argument, the Plaintiffs are not asserting the rights of their children; that contention is \none we consider in Part III(B), infra. Instead, the claim is the closely related but conceptually \ndistinct one that the level of scrutiny appropriate for the Plaintiffs' own claim is heightened \nbecause of the harm to their children. The argument purports to find support in Weinberger \nv. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975), but that decision does \nnot provide what the Plaintiffs claim. \nIn Wiesenfeld, a widower challenged a provision of the Social Security Act that limited \nsurvivor benefits to his children. 583*583 He claimed a denial of equal protection because a \nsurviving widow was entitled to benefits for herself as well as her children. The Court upheld \nhis claim, ruling that the statute reflected a gender-based discrimination \"`premised on \noverbroad generalizations that could not be tolerated under the Constitution.'\" Id. at 643, 95 \nS.Ct. 1225 (quoting Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498, 507, 95 S.Ct. 572, 42 L.Ed.2d 610 \n(1975)). Although the Court accepted that \"men are more likely than women to be the \nprimary supporters of their spouses and children,\" id. at 645, 95 S.Ct. 1225, it condemned \n\"the denigration of the efforts of women who do work and whose earnings contribute \nsignificantly to their families[],\" id. The widower prevailed on his gender-based \ndiscrimination claim because of the gender-based discriminatory effect the survivor \nprovision had on a female wage-earner. The Court noted that a purpose of the statute was \nto \"enabl[e] the surviving parent to remain at home to care for a child,\" id. at 651, 95 S.Ct. \n1225, but the rationale for heightened scrutiny was gender-based discrimination on female \nwage-earners, not hardship to their surviving children, as the Plaintiffs in the pending case \nassert. Indeed, as Wiesenfeld makes clear, id. at 642-43, 95 S.Ct. 1225, its rationale \n\nderives directly from Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 \n(1973), which involved a gender-based discrimination against female members of the \narmed services (with respect to allowances for medical benefits and quarters) that had \nnothing whatever to do with dependent children.[26] \n2. Applying Rational Basis Scrutiny \nAlthough no court of appeals has yet considered the Welfare Reform Act's denial of \nprenatal care to unqualified aliens, every court of appeals to consider the Act's deprivation \nof other government benefits to unqualified aliens has found the denial to survive rational \nbasis scrutiny. See Aleman v. Glickman, 217 F.3d 1191, 1201-04 (9th Cir.2000) (denial of \nfood stamps to certain divorced aliens); City of Chicago v. Shalala, 189 F.3d 598, 605-09 \n(7th Cir.1999) (denial of food stamps, supplemental security income, and other public \nbenefits); Rodriguez v. United States, 169 F.3d 1342, 1350-53 (11th Cir.1999) (denial of \nfood stamps and supplemental security income); see also Kiev v. Glickman, 991 F.Supp. \n1090 (D.Minn.1998); Abreu v. Callahan, 971 F.Supp. 799 (S.D.N.Y.1997). \nThe Secretary offers three rationales for the denial of prenatal care to unqualified alien \npregnant mothers: deterrence of illegal immigration, self-sufficiency, and cost savings. The \nfirst alone suffices for rational basis review. \nCongress explicitly identified as a purpose of the Welfare Reform Act \"remov[ing] the \nincentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.\" 8 U.S.C.A. § \n1601(6). Although the record discloses no evidence that a prospective illegal immigrant \nconsiders the unavailability of prenatal care in deliberating whether to illegally enter the \ncountry, such evidence is not required to satisfy rational basis analysis. Heller, 509 U.S. at \n320, 113 S.Ct. 2637. It is sufficient that this proposition be \"reasonably conceivable,\" Beach \nCommunications, 508 584*584 U.S. at 313, 113 S.Ct. 2096, and it is reasonable for \nCongress to believe that some aliens would be less likely to hazard the trip to this country if \nthey understood that they would not receive government benefits upon arrival, see Graham \nv. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 379, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971) (state statutes that \ndeny welfare benefits to aliens who have not resided in a state for a specified number of \nyears \"necessarily operate ... to discourage entry into or continued residency in the State\"); \naccord City of Chicago, 189 F.3d at 607. Although it seems likely that many alien women \nwill illegally immigrate to obtain the benefit of citizenship for their children, undeterred by \nineligibility for prenatal care in the event of pregnancy, Congress is entitled to suppose that \nthe denial of care will deter some of them. In the realm of immigration, where congressional \ndiscretion is extremely broad, this supposition, even if dubious, satisfies rational basis \nreview.[27] \nB. Constitutionality as Applied to the Children \n1. Standing \nTurning to the Plaintiffs' constitutional claim on behalf of their children, we first consider \nwhether members of the plaintiff class have standing to invoke the third-party rights of their \nchildren. We conclude that they do. \n\nThe determination whether a plaintiff has standing to assert the rights of third parties has \nconstitutional and prudential components. Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 112, 96 S.Ct. \n2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976). First, as is the case with any plaintiff, she must meet the \nconstitutional prerequisites of standing: (1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation, and (3) \nredressability. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 102-03, 118 \nS.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (identifying this triad as the \"irreducible constitutional \nminimum of standing\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). In addition, she must satisfy \n\"prudential\" limitations on third-party standing: (1) a \"close relation with the third party\" and \n(2) \"some hindrance to the third party's ability to protect his or her own interests.\" Lake, 226 \nF.3d at 146; see Secretary of State v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 956, 104 S.Ct. \n2839, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984). \nThe Plaintiffs have demonstrated both constitutional and prudential standing. In the \nabsence of the challenged injunction, pregnant alien women would be forced to bear the \nexpense of prenatal care themselves, as well as the sizable costs of treating postnatal \nillness caused (or exacerbated) by deficient prenatal care. These women, who have to \ndemonstrate financial hardship to meet Medicaid eligibility standards, are \"injured in fact\" by \nthe denial of federally-sponsored government aid. See Doe v. Blum, 729 F.2d 186, 189 (2d \nCir.1984) (suggesting that an individual has standing to sue for denial of Medicaid coverage \n585*585 if she \"alleges that she requested and was denied\" Medicaid-sponsored care); \nHazard v. Shalala, 44 F.3d 399, 403 (6th Cir.1995) (recipient of Medicaid-sponsored care \nhas standing to challenge provision that bars him from receiving Medicaid). \nAs for prudential standing, the relationship between parent and child is obviously close. See \nLake, 226 F.3d at 147 (child may raise equal protection rights of deceased parent); see also \nMiller v. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 433, 118 S.Ct. 1428, 140 L.Ed.2d 575 (1998) (Stevens, J., \nwith whom Rehnquist, C.J., joins) (child may raise equal protection rights of parent who \ncannot bring own claim); id. at 447, 118 S.Ct. 1428 (O'Connor, J., with whom Kennedy, J., \njoins, concurring) (\"[I]t seems clear that petitioner has ... a close relationship with her father\" \nfor purposes of third-party standing); id. at 473, 118 S.Ct. 1428 (Breyer, J., with whom \nSouter and Ginsburg, JJ., join, dissenting) (child has a \"close\" relationship with her father \nfor purposes of standing). And there are probably few individuals less able to protect their \nown interests than newborn children, many of whom in this case start life with severe \nmental and physical disabilities due to the denial of prenatal care. See Smith v. \nOrganization of Foster Families, 431 U.S. 816, 841 n. 44, 97 S.Ct. 2094, 53 L.Ed.2d 14 \n(1977) (parents have prudential standing to raise third party claims of foster children \nbecause \"children usually lack the capacity\" to make litigation decisions).[28] \n2. The Merits of the Children's Claim \nIn asserting a claim on behalf of the children at and after birth, the Plaintiffs do not contend \nthat a fetus, in the womb of a pregnant unqualified alien, has been subjected to \nunconstitutional discrimination by the denial of prenatal care that would be available for the \nfetus of a financially eligible pregnant citizen. Such a claim would be foreclosed by the \nSupreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 \n(1973), which ruled that the fetus in utero is not a \"person\" within the meaning of the \nFourteenth Amendment, id. at 157-59, 93 S.Ct. 705. Lacking the status of a Fourteenth \nAmendment \"person,\" a fetus cannot validly claim a denial of equal protection, see Abele v. \n\nMarkle, 351 F.Supp. 224, 228-29 (D.Conn.1972) (\"[I]t is difficult to imagine how a statute \npermitting abortion could be constitutional if the fetus had fourteenth amendment rights.\"), \nvacated on other grounds, 410 U.S. 951, 93 S.Ct. 1417, 35 L.Ed.2d 683 (1973) (remanding \nfor reconsideration in light of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, \n35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973)), and there is no basis for contending that such a claim fares any \nbetter under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.[29] \n586*586 Instead, the Plaintiffs contend that the born child, who indisputably is a citizen \nentitled to equal protection of the laws, can challenge the constitutionality of the denial of \nprenatal care. This appears to be the premise of the District Court's constitutional ruling in \nthis case. See Lewis VI, 111 F.Supp.2d at 179. \nIn our view, recognition of a newborn child's constitutional challenge to the prior denial of \ncare in utero is foreclosed by Roe v. Wade just as clearly as would be a constitutional claim \nasserted on behalf of a fetus. If, as Roe v. Wade instructs, a fetus lacks constitutional \nprotection to assure it an opportunity to be born, we see no basis for according it \nconstitutional protection to assure it enhanced prospects of good health after birth. \nWe recognize, of course, that the child suffers after birth from lack of prenatal care in the \nwomb. And there can be no doubt that legislation may create for the child a cause of action \nto obtain compensation for the consequences of prenatal injury. See Humes v. Clinton, 246 \nKan. 590, 594, 792 P.2d 1032 (1990) (\"A majority of states allow an action for wrongful \ndeath of a viable fetus even when it is stillborn as a result of the prenatal injuries.\"). But a \nlegislative benefit does not imply a constitutional requirement. Roe's preclusion of a \nFourteenth Amendment right for a fetus would evaporate if a child could assert a \nconstitutional claim for prebirth injury. \nA claim asserted by a person for harm sustained in a previous status rarely if ever arises in \nan equal protection context, due most likely to the fact that, as a general matter, only \nimmutable characteristics are entitled to heightened protection under the Equal Protection \nClause. See Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638, 106 S.Ct. 2727, 91 L.Ed.2d 527 (1986) \n(\"close relatives\" not a \"suspect\" or \"quasi-suspect\" class because \"they do not exhibit \nobvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them as a discrete group\"); \nFrontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973) \n(classification on the basis of sex accorded heightened scrutiny because \"sex, like race and \nnational origin, is an immutable characteristic\"). Such a \"transitional\" equal protection claim \nmight conceivably be asserted by an alien who later becomes a citizen, but it would not \nsucceed. In Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977), the Supreme \nCourt held that the federal government need demonstrate only a rational basis for denying \nthe illegitimate alien child of a citizen father a special immigration preference available to a \nsimilarly situated illegitimate alien child of a citizen mother.[30] We have no doubt that if the \ndisadvantaged alien child in Fiallo later became a citizen, he could not obtain heightened \nscrutiny of the statutory discrimination that had denied him an immigration preference \nsimply because he continued to suffer the consequences of the discriminatory denial that \nhad occurred while he was an alien. \nThe Plaintiffs claim that Crumpton v. Gates, 947 F.2d 1418 (9th Cir.1991), supports their \nposition. The plaintiff in Crumpton was a six-year-old boy who alleged that his father had \n\nbeen killed by unconstitutional government conduct while the plaintiff was in utero. The \nNinth Circuit held that the plaintiff had a valid claim 587*587 for violation of a Fourteenth \nAmendment \"substantive due process liberty interest in having familial relations with a \nparent.\" Id. at 1422. Distinguishing cases rejecting constitutional claims on behalf of a child \nsuffering a prebirth injury, see Harman v. Daniels, 525 F.Supp. 798 (W.D.Va.1981); Ruiz \nRomero v. Gonzalez Caraballo, 681 F.Supp. 123 (D.P.R.1988), the Court ruled that \n\"[b]ecause a child has familial relationships only after birth, it follows that the child's right to \nfamilial relationships exists only after birth.\" Crumpton, 947 F.2d at 1422. \nWhether or not we would adhere to Crumpton, we see no conflict between that decision and \nour rejection of the Plaintiffs' constitutional claim on behalf of their children. In Crumpton, \nthe child was permitted to sue for the deprivation—loss of a child-parent relationship—that \nwas suffered only upon birth. Here, however, the alleged deprivation—a discriminatory \ndenial of Medicaid assistance on the basis of alienage—was suffered while the fetus was in \nutero. At that moment the fetus had no constitutional right to equal protection, and the born \nchild's subsequent protection by the Equal Protection Clause cannot retroactively create a \nclaim that was not cognizable before birth. \nIn upholding the Plaintiffs' equal protection claim on behalf of their children, the District \nCourt in this case relied on the many decisions that have ruled unconstitutional legal \ndisabilities or limitations of various kinds imposed because the children were illegitimate. \nLewis VI, 111 F.Supp.2d at 176-77 (collecting cases). In all such cases, the plaintiff child \nchallenged governmental action that was currently imposing some restriction. E.g., Clark v. \nJeter, 486 U.S. 456, 108 S.Ct. 1910, 100 L.Ed.2d 465 (1988) (six-year statute of limitations \non paternity suit by illegitimate child); Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 97 S.Ct. 1459, 52 \nL.Ed.2d 31 (1977) (law allowing illegitimate child to inherit by intestate succession from \nmother, but not father); Jimenez v. Weinberger, 417 U.S. 628, 94 S.Ct. 2496, 41 L.Ed.2d \n363 (1974) (Social Security Act provision imposing restrictions on illegitimate child's \nrecovery of benefit upon disability of parent). By contrast, the challenged denial of prenatal \ncare occurred before the Plaintiffs' children were born. After their birth, no governmental \naction was taken against them, except for the denial of automatic eligibility for Medicaid \ncoverage at birth, a matter to which we now turn. \nIV. Plaintiffs' Constitutional Challenge to Denial of \nChildren's Automatic Eligibility \nThe newborn child's lack of a valid equal protection claim to assure Medicaid assistance for \nprenatal care in utero does not mean that the entire claim advanced by the Plaintiffs on their \nchildren's behalf is without merit. What remains for consideration is the citizen child's claim \nto Medicaid coverage from the moment of birth, so-called \"automatic eligibility.\" \nA. The Statutory Scheme \nThe \"automatic eligibility\" provision of the Medicaid statute was added in DRA '84. This \nprovision ensures that a newborn child of a mother receiving Medicaid is automatically \neligible for Medicaid-sponsored care at birth: \n\nA child born to a woman eligible for and receiving medical assistance under a State plan on \nthe date of the child's birth shall be deemed to have applied for medical assistance and to \nhave been found eligible for such assistance under such plan on the date of such birth and \nto remain eligible for such assistance for a period of one year so long as the child is a \nmember of the woman's household and the woman remains (or would remain 588*588 if \npregnant) eligible for such assistance. During the period in which a child is deemed under \nthe preceding sentence to be eligible for medical assistance, the medical assistance \neligibility identification number of the mother shall also serve as the identification number of \nthe child, and all claims shall be submitted and paid under such number (unless the State \nissues a separate identification number for the child before such period expires). \n42 U.S.C.A. § 1396a(e)(4); see also 42 C.F.R. §§ 435.117, 435.301(b)(1)(iii).[31] This \nautomatic eligibility is important because it assures immediate care, unfettered by \npaperwork and bureaucratic hurdles, at a critical time in the child's life. \nBecause the Welfare Reform Act denies prenatal Medicaid assistance to an unqualified \nalien, she cannot meet section 1396a(e)(4)'s requirement of \"receiving medical assistance \nunder a State plan on the date of the child's birth,\" and her newborn child therefore does not \nqualify for a year of automatic Medicaid coverage under the literal terms of section \n1396a(e)(4). A citizen child of an unqualified alien mother is thus disadvantaged compared \nto a citizen child of a citizen mother. The latter will receive automatic Medicaid coverage at \nbirth if his or her mother, prior to birth, has qualified for Medicaid for herself. \nThe Secretary initially opposes the Plaintiffs' claim for automatic eligibility on the ground that \nthere is no discrimination at all: every child born of a parent who is not then on Medicaid \nmust file for Medicaid coverage and demonstrate entitlement as a child. See Brief for \nAppellants at 29. This argument calls to mind Anatole France's view of the equality that \nforbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges.[32] Although all alien and citizen mothers \nare equally prevented from obtaining automatic coverage for their children at birth in the \nabsence of their own Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, only the children of the plaintiff \nclass members have been denied automatic eligibility at birth because their mothers were \nprohibited by the Act's alienage provisions from obtaining Medicaid coverage during \npregnancy. \nThe Secretary also endeavors to minimize the significance of the distinction between the \ncitizen children of alien mothers and the citizen children of citizen mothers by pointing to the \nopportunity to obtain coverage after birth. If the child is eligible for Medicaid in the child's \nown right, the alien mother can sign the child up for Medicaid after the birth, and can obtain \nretroactive coverage to the date of birth, because Medicaid coverage is retroactive for three \nmonths from the date of application. 42 C.F.R. § 435.914. \nWe agree with the Plaintiffs, however, that the citizen children of alien mothers remain \ndisadvantaged by the lack of automatic eligibility. In the first place, although retroactive \ncoverage eases the financial problem of not being able to pay for medical services that are \nobtained, it does not solve the medical problem of not 589*589 receiving immediate medical \nservices for the child from providers who insist on proof of current Medicaid coverage. \nMoreover, automatic coverage at birth is obviously preferable to having to apply in the \nweeks immediately after childbirth and enduring bureaucratic delays. Finally, many mothers, \n\nparticularly those who recently arrived from another country, will not necessarily know that \ntheir children are likely eligible for postnatal care, and it is well documented that many do \nnot receive accurate or sufficient eligibility information from practitioners and social workers. \nSee Dennis Andrulis et al., Voices for Children's Health in New York State: Community \nRoundtables on Increasing Medicaid and Child Health Plus Enrollment, New York Forum for \nChild Health, available at \nhttp://www.nyam.org/publications/online/childinsurance/voices.html (visited April 11, 2001). \nB. Lawfulness of Denying Automatic Eligibility \nThe Plaintiffs' claim for automatic eligibility for citizen children of alien mothers can be \nconsidered as a request for either a favorable interpretation of the Medicaid statute to \npreclude denial of automatic eligibility, or, if the statute is thought to require such denial, \ninvalidation of the denial on equal protection grounds. The alternate approaches are related \nbecause the substantiality of the constitutional objection would weigh in favor of a favorable \nstatutory interpretation that would avoid any constitutional issue. We consider both \napproaches. \n1. Statutory Interpretation \nSection 1396a(e)(4) does not by its terms include within its coverage the citizen child of an \nalien mother. But neither this provision, nor any other provision of the Welfare Reform Act, \nappears designed to make sure that these citizen children will be denied the same \nautomatic eligibility accorded children of eligible citizen mothers. Moreover, there is no \nindication of congressional intent to deny these citizen children such automatic eligibility, \ncomparable to the clearly expressed intention, which we have recognized, to deny Medicaid \nassistance for prenatal care to alien women. \nThus, the circumstances present a compelling case for interpreting the Medicaid statute as \nfavorably for citizen children as we did in Lewis V for pregnant alien women seeking \nprenatal care. First, the mechanics of automatic eligibility for newborn children of eligible \ncitizen mothers is obscured by the density of the Medicaid statute, and it is highly unlikely \nthat Congress in 1996 was focusing on this aspect of the statute at all, much less intending \nto take the unusual step of denying such eligibility to citizen children because of the \nalienage of their mothers. Moreover, as we next discuss, reading the statute to preclude \nsuch eligibility encounters substantial constitutional objection. Nevertheless, we conclude \nthat we cannot \"interpret\" the Act to permit automatic Medicaid coverage at birth for citizen \nchildren of alien mothers denied Medicaid because of alienage. In Lewis V, we declined a \nliteral reading of the Act mainly to carry out the congressional purpose of saving money. \nWith the passage of the Welfare Reform Act and its alienage provisions, we now know that \nCongress is willing to risk incurring the added costs of treating children denied prenatal care \nbecause of the alienage of their mothers, doing so in the hope of deterring unlawful \nimmigration. We would not be furthering a congressional cost-saving objective, as in Lewis \nV, by \"interpreting\" the Medicaid statute to accord the Plaintiffs' children automatic Medicaid \neligibility. \n\n2. Constitutional Objection \nViewed as an equal protection issue, the Plaintiffs' claim on behalf of their children 590*590 \nis persuasive. Initially, we note that a disadvantage need not be especially onerous to merit \nassessment under the Equal Protection Clause. In Miller, the Supreme Court considered a \nprovision that grants automatic citizenship at birth to the child of an alien father and a citizen \nmother, but, in the case of the child of an alien mother and a citizen father, requires either \nthe child or the father to take any of several steps to confirm their relationship before the \nage of 18, 8 U.S.C. § 1409. One of the steps was obtaining the father's acknowledgment \nunder oath of his paternity, id. § 1409(a)(4)(B). The Court considered this discriminatory \ntreatment sufficient to trigger assessment under the Equal Protection Clause. Miller, 523 \nU.S. at 433-41, 118 S.Ct. 1428. As we noted in Comer v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 775 (2d \nCir.1994), the \"government harms minority individuals, and violates the Equal Protection \nClause ... `[w]hen the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for members \nof one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group.'\" Id. at 793 (quoting \nNortheastern Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. \n656, 666, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 124 L.Ed.2d 586 (1993)). \nIf the denial of automatic eligibility for the citizen children is assessed under the rational \nbasis standard, this might be the rare case where the equal protection claim would prevail. \nAlthough the denial is based on the alienage of the mother, the \"highly deferential\" standard \nappropriate in matters of immigration, see Lake, 226 F.3d at 148, is not applicable here \nbecause we are concerned with a claim asserted on behalf of a citizen.[33] As we recognized \nin Lake, \"Fiallo itself made clear that the reduced threshold of justification for governmental \naction that applied to immigrants did not apply to citizens.\" Lake, 226 F.3d at 148.[34] On a \ntraditional rational basis inquiry, the denial of automatic eligibility would encounter \nsubstantial objection. Although it is arguably rational to think that some pregnant women will \nbe deterred from crossing our borders by the unavailability of welfare benefits (despite the \ncertainty of citizenship for their children), the limits of \"rational speculation,\" Heller, 509 U.S. \nat 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637 (internal quotation marks omitted), are surely approached by \nthinking that they are deterred by the disadvantage of obtaining for their children \nautomatically the coverage that they can obtain by application. On this point, the Secretary's \nsuggestion that the disadvantage is slight substantially undermines whatever argument \nmight be made that the lack of automatic eligibility rationally serves to deter immigration. \nHowever, we need not decide whether the denial of automatic eligibility for the children \nbecause of their mother's alienage would survive traditional rational basis scrutiny, \nbecause, under Plyler, it fails to survive heightened scrutiny. \nIn Plyler, 457 U.S. at 220, 102 S.Ct. 2382, the Supreme Court invalidated a Texas statute \ndenying public schooling to 591*591 the children of illegal aliens because the denial \n\"directed the onus of a parent's misconduct against his children.\" Plyler concluded that such \na statute \"can hardly be considered rational unless it furthers some substantial goal of the \nState,\" id. at 224, 102 S.Ct. 2382, a test the Court recognized as consistent with \nintermediate scrutiny, see id. at 218 n. 16, 224, 102 S.Ct. 2382. \nThe Plaintiffs contend that the heightened scrutiny applied in Plyler is appropriate here \nbecause the discriminatory denial of automatic eligibility, although not based on gender or \nrace, is imposed on the citizen children solely because of the unqualified alien status of their \n\nmothers. The Secretary responds that Fiallo precludes the application of heightened \nscrutiny under Plyler. However, we have already held in Lake, drawing an inference from \nthe various opinions of the Justices in Miller, that citizen claimants with an equal protection \nclaim deserving of heightened scrutiny do not lose that favorable form of review simply \nbecause the case arises in the context of immigration. Lake, 226 F.3d at 145-46, 147-48. \nAdmittedly, the circumstances in Plyler, which the Court has never since invoked to \ninvalidate a statute, presented a more compelling case for heightened scrutiny than does \nthe Plaintiffs' claim for automatic eligibility, because the denial there — public education — \nis more burdensome than the brief postponement of obtaining Medicaid coverage (serious \nas that might be in some circumstances). On the other hand, the Plaintiffs' claim is stronger \nin that here it is asserted on behalf of citizen children, whereas the claimants in Plyler were \nalien children. Although the Supreme Court has noted that it has not extended Plyler \nbeyond its \"`unique circumstances,'\" Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Schools, 487 U.S. 450, \n459, 108 S.Ct. 2481, 101 L.Ed.2d 399 (1988) (quoting Plyler, 457 U.S. at 239, 102 S.Ct. \n2382 (Powell, J., concurring)), the Court has identified those circumstances as (a) \npenalizing children for the illegal conduct of their parents and (b) risking significant and \nenduring adverse consequences to the children, id. The first circumstance fully applies to \nthe denial of automatic eligibility to citizen children solely because of their alien mothers' \nunlawful status, and the second circumstance may be expected to apply to many of these \nchildren. See, e.g., Judy C. Bernbaum, Medical Care after Discharge, in Neonatology: \nPatholophysiology and Management of the Newborn 1355 (Gordon B. Avery et al. eds., 4th \ned.1993) (emphasizing importance of monitoring high-risk and low-birth-weight children \nshortly after birth to prevent and treat life-threatening diseases).[35] Moreover, the claim on \nbehalf of the children, like the alien children's claim in Plyler, is that a social welfare benefit, \nitself unrelated to immigration, has been denied on a discriminatory basis that violates the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nWe therefore conclude that the citizen children of the plaintiff class must be accorded \nautomatic eligibility on terms as favorable as those available to the children of citizen \nmothers. We will leave it to the District Court on remand to develop, after consultation with \nthe parties, a revised injunction that assures the plaintiff class 592*592 the same automatic \neligibility for their citizen children that is available to the children of citizen mothers. Because \nthe alien mother, unlike the citizen mother, cannot obtain Medicaid coverage for herself \nprior to giving birth, it seems likely that the Secretary will have to adopt some procedure \npermitting the alien mother, during her pregnancy, to apply for and obtain a Medicaid \nnumber for her child that is automatically effective upon the child's birth, assuming financial \neligibility requirements are met. \nConclusion \nThe order is reversed to the extent that it continues the injunction requiring the Secretary to \nprovide prenatal Medicaid assistance to the plaintiff class, affirmed to the extent that it \nrequires the Secretary to make automatic eligibility for Medicaid coverage available to the \ncitizen children of the plaintiff class upon their birth, on terms as favorable as those \navailable to the children of citizen mothers, and remanded for entry of a modified injunction \nconsistent with this opinion.

(2000) (statement of Jean \nHearne, Specialist in Social Legislation, Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress), available at 2000 WL \n19303668. \n[5] AFDC keyed eligibility to the need of a \"dependent child\" rather than the need of the mother. 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 605, \n606(a), repealed by Pub.L. No. 104-193, § 103(a)(1), 110 Stat. 2112 (1996). This presented a potential problem for \ndetermining eligibility for prenatal care because the fetus in need of care was unborn; nevertheless, for decades the \nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), predecessor to HHS, regarded a fetus as eligible under the \nAct. The Supreme Court held in Burns v. Alcala, 420 U.S. 575, 584-86, 95 S.Ct. 1180, 43 L.Ed.2d 469 (1975), that \nparticipating states were not required to offer prenatal care, but left open the possibility that states were nonetheless \npermitted to offer such care under the Plan, and that remained the Department's interpretation for some time. \n[6] Medicare, which provides medical assistance to the aged and disabled without regard to financial status, was \npassed at the same time as Medicaid, and contained an explicit restriction on alien eligibility. Social Security \nAmendments of 1965, Pub.L. No. 89-97, § 1836, 79 Stat. 286, 304 (1965). \n[7] At some point before 1986, the Secretary replaced the alienage regulation with the following provision:  \nThe agency must provide Medicaid to otherwise eligible residents of the United States who are— \n(a) Citizens; or \n(b) Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence or permanently residing in the United States under color of law \n[\"PRUCOL aliens\"].... \nLewis V, 965 F.2d at 1212 (quoting 42 C.F.R. § 435.402 (1992)). Although not on its face excluding reimbursement \nfor state plans that covered non-PRUCOL aliens, the regulation was interpreted that way by the Secretary. Id. \n[8] The class has since been amended to include \"all aliens residing in New York State who have applied or \nattempted to apply for Medicaid but have been or would be denied on the basis of their alienage.\" Lewis VI, 111 \nF.Supp.2d at 147 n. 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n[9] Congress also added an alienage restriction to AFDC in OBRA '81, but did not add a similar restriction to the \nMedicaid statute. OBRA '81, § 2320. \n[10] The legislative history makes it clear that Congress was reacting specifically to Judge Sifton's ruling. See \nH.R.Rep. No. 99-727, at 111 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3607, 3701:  \nOn July 14, 1986, a U.S. District Court struck down [the Medicaid alienage restriction] regulation as outside the scope \nof the authority delegated under the Medicaid statute.... \nIn response to the Court's invitation to clarify Congressional intent, the Committee bill amends the Medicaid statute to \nmake it explicit that Federal financial participation is not available for State expenditures for aliens who are not \nlawfully admitted for permanent residence or permanently residing in the U.S. under color of law. \n\n[11] However, Congress expressed a desire to give PRUCOL an expansive meaning in this context:  \nThe Committee intends that the Secretary and the States broadly interpret the phrase \"under color of law\" to include \nall of the categories recognized by immigration law, policy, and practice in effect at the time.... \nH.R.Rep. No. 99-727, at 111, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3701. \n[12] The statute provided:  \n(v)(1) [E]xcept as provided in paragraph (2), no payment may be made to a State under this section for medical \nassistance furnished to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently \nresiding in the United States under color of law. \n(2) Payment shall be made under this section for care and services that are furnished to an alien described in \nparagraph (1) only if— \n(A) such care and services are necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition of the alien, and \n(B) such alien otherwise meets the eligibility requirements for medical assistance under the State plan approved \nunder this title (other than the requirement of the receipt of aid or assistance under title IV, supplemental security \nincome benefits under title XVI, or a State supplementary payment). \nOBRA '86, § 9406(a). \n[13] Lewis II was filed after the earlier Lewis III, but we have retained the labeling of these decisions used by the \nDistrict Court and this Court throughout the litigation. \n[14] See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, cl. 1 (\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the \njurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"); 8 U.S.C.A. § 1401; INS v. \nRios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 446, 105 S.Ct. 2098, 85 L.Ed.2d 452 (1985). \n[15] An amended version of the opinion was issued on April 2, 1992. \n[16] This evidence took two forms. First, the legislative history of OBRA '86 reveals Congress to have been attentive \nonly to the absence of alienage restrictions in the \"optional categorically needy\" and \"optional medically needy\" \ncategories, apparently thinking that the alienage restriction in the AFDC statute took care of the \"mandatory \ncategorically needy\" category (which is principally tied to AFDC eligibility). However, among the problems with this \napproach was that it ignored \"qualified pregnant women,\" who are listed among the \"mandatory categorically needy\" \nbut whose eligibility is not tied to AFDC and therefore cannot be deemed to have incorporated AFDC's alienage \nrestrictions. Congress did not appear to have recognized this problem. We concluded that Congress was inattentive \nto the impact OBRA '86's alienage restrictions would have on Medicaid coverage of alien pregnant women's health \nneeds. See Lewis V, 965 F.2d at 1216-17.  \nSecond, we recognized that the states' authority to provide prenatal coverage directly to the fetus as an \"individual \nunder the age of 21,\" had been unresolved for some time. Since the OBRA '86 alienage restriction did not appear to \ndeal with the \"under the age of 21\" approach, we concluded that any attempt to impute to Congress an intent to deny \nprenatal care in these circumstances would be premised on the questionable assumption that Congress believed the \nlaw to have been settled against treating fetuses as \"individuals under the age of 21\" entitled to Medicaid assistance \nin their own right. Id. at 1217. \n[17] The statute was amended later in 1996 to except many battered spouses and their children receiving care for \ninjuries related to the battery. Pub.L. No. 104-208, § 501, 110 Stat. 3009-670, codified at 8 U.S.C.A. § 1641(c)(1)-(3). \n[18] The statute also allows a state to impose time limits on Medicaid eligibility (and, in some cases, deny eligibility \naltogether) for certain classes of qualified aliens who are not lawful permanent residents. See 8 U.S.C.A. § 1612(b). \n\n[19] Other exceptions are provided for immunizations and treatment of symptoms of communicable diseases not \ncovered by Medicaid, see 8 U.S.C.A. § 1611(b)(1)(C), short-term disaster relief, id. § 1611(b)(1)(B), certain \ncommunity service programs designated by the Attorney General, including such programs as soup kitchens and \ncrisis counseling, see id. § 1611(b)(1)(D), certain housing and community development programs, see id. § \n1611(b)(1)(E) and federally funded School Lunch and Breakfast programs, see id. § 1615. None of these exceptions \nis relevant to the prenatal care at issue in this case. \n[20] For example, an individual who, while not a permanent lawful resident, has entered and continuously resided in \nthe United States since 1972 is considered PRUCOL, see, e.g., 42 C.F.R. § 435.408(13), but such an alien would not \nautomatically count as \"qualified\" under the Welfare Reform Act, and states would be prohibited from dispensing \nMedicaid funds to her for a non-emergency condition unless she otherwise came within the meaning of \"qualified \nalien\" in section 1641(b). \n[21] Unlike the \"emergency medical condition\" defined in section 1396b(v)(3), prenatal care encompasses for the \nmost part regular, \"routine\" monitoring of the health and progress of the pregnant woman and fetus, as well as \nnutritional and other counseling. \n[22] The Plaintiffs insist that the Conference Report \"does not rule out a contrary reading of the statute.\" Br. for \nPlaintiffs-Appellees at 60. They apparently mean to suggest that the Report was not focusing on the ineligibility of \naliens for prenatal care, but rather on the narrow question of whether \"emergency medical services\" should be \ndefined to include prenatal care. However, the definition of \"emergency medical services\" is important to the statutory \nscheme only insofar as it defines what care will continue to be available to unqualified aliens. The Report's reference \nto prenatal care occurs in the middle of a one-page discussion under the heading \"Aliens who are not qualified aliens \n[are] ineligible for federal public benefits.\" The reference to prenatal care under this heading makes clear that the \nConference Committee had aliens in mind in defining \"emergency medical services\" to exclude prenatal care. See id. \nat 379, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2767. \n[23] We note Congress's additional purposes in Part III(A)(2), infra. \n[24] The Welfare Reform Act ended AFDC, but still tied eligibility for Medicaid assistance to the eligibility standards of \nAFDC as they existed before AFDC was eliminated. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396u-1 (West Supp.2000). \n[25] Another concern that led us to look beyond the statutory text in Lewis V is also absent from this case. We noted \nthat the provisions denying benefits to aliens were part of an \"end-of-session, omnibus budget reconciliation bill\" \nrather than an immigration law, and therefore could not be assumed to reflect the careful, focused attention of \nlegislators on matters of immigration policy. Lewis V, 965 F.2d at 1216, 1220. By contrast, the Welfare Reform Act \nwas the product of months of debate and extensive committee hearings in the House, and Congress articulated a \nclear vision of how it expected the Act to alter immigration law. See Welfare Reform Act, Pub L. 104-193, § 400, \ncodified at 8 U.S.C.A. § 1601 (\"The Congress makes the following statements concerning national policy with respect \nto welfare and immigration....\"). \n[26] The Plaintiffs make a similarly unavailing argument in reliance on Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 97 S.Ct. \n1021, 51 L.Ed.2d 270 (1977), but the rationale for the heightened scrutiny in that decision was also a gender-based \ndiscrimination, not hardship to children. Id. at 204, 97 S.Ct. 1021 (\"The gender-based distinction drawn by § \n402(f)(1)(D)—burdening a widower but not a widow with the task of proving dependency upon the deceased \nspouse—presents an equal protection question indistinguishable from that decided in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld.\" \n(citation omitted)). \n[27] Because the deterrence rationale suffices, we need not assess the Secretary's additional rationales of self-\nreliance, see 8 U.S.C.A. § 1601(5) (\"It is a compelling government interest to enact new rules for eligibility and \nsponsorship agreements in order to assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy\"), \nor saving money, see id. § 1601(4) (\"Current eligibility rules for public assistance ... have proved wholly incapable of \nassuring that individual aliens not burden the public benefits system.\"). The latter rationale would seem to press the \nlimits of even \"rational speculation,\" Heller, 509 U.S. at 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637 (internal quotations marks omitted); it \nrequires a belief that the welfare costs that would have been spent on the alien women (and their families) who are \ndeterred by the denial of benefits would exceed the added costs of providing extensive medical services, for the rest \nof their lives, to the citizen children of those who come anyway. \n\n[28] The Secretary additionally argues that the Plaintiffs cannot invoke the third-party rights of their children because \nthey did not specifically allege those rights in the complaint. However, a plaintiff's failure to allege third-party rights in \na complaint does not necessarily preclude a later assertion of those rights at summary judgment. See National Union \nof Hospital and Health Care Employees v. Carey, 557 F.2d 278 (2d Cir.1977) (adjudicating plaintiffs' attempt to \ninvoke third-party rights despite apparent absence of specific invocation of third-party rights in complaint). In this \ncase, the Plaintiffs challenged the application to their children of the Secretary's alienage restrictions from the start of \nthe litigation, see Lewis VI, 111 F.Supp.2d at 148; the State of New York specifically raised the constitutional rights of \nthe children of alien mothers when it intervened shortly after the commencement of the case, see Intervenor \nComplaint of City of New York at 12; the Plaintiffs have been submitting affidavits documenting the need for Medicaid \nfunding of prenatal care since at least 1987; and we looked to the constitutional rights of these children in deciding to \nnarrowly interpret the statute in Lewis V. \n[29] An equal protection claim, like the substantive due process claim in Roe v. Wade, can be asserted only by, or on \nbehalf of, a \"person\" entitled to Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment protection. \n[30] Fiallo involved several plaintiffs, some of whom were citizens and some were aliens. The characteristics of Serge \nWarner are pertinent to this discussion; he was the alien child of a citizen father and had been denied, allegedly in \nviolation of equal protection, the benefit of an immigration preference. See Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 790 n. 3, 97 S.Ct. 1473. \n[31] Section 435.117 of the regulations appears to limit automatic eligibility for the child to a mother receiving \nMedicaid assistance as \"mandatory categorically needy\"; section 435.301(b)(1)(iii) appears to provide automatic \ncoverage to a mother receiving Medicaid assistance as \"optionally medically needy.\" The precise nature of the \nautomatic coverage for the child of a citizen mother is not at issue on this appeal. We will consider the Plaintiffs' claim \nfor automatic coverage for the child of an alien to seek coverage on whatever terms apply to the child of a citizen. \n[32] \"The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under the bridges, to beg in the \nstreets, and to steal bread.\" Anatole France, Le Lys Rouge, ch. VII (1894). \n[33] We recognize that highly deferential rational basis scrutiny was used in Fiallo even though one of the plaintiffs, \nRamon Martin Fiallo, was a citizen. See Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 790 n. 3, 97 S.Ct. 1473. However, the citizen plaintiff child \nwas making no claim for himself; the claim in that case was for an immigration preference for the child's alien father, a \nmatter unquestionably subject to Congress's broad power over immigration. \n[34] There is a latent ambiguity in Lake as to whether the \"reduced threshold of justification for governmental action \nthat applied to immigrants\" means \"reduced from ordinary rational basis review\" or \"reduced from the heightened \nscrutiny that would apply to a discrimination on the basis of gender or race.\" \n[35] See also Sue R. Broyles, et al., Comprehensive Follow-up Care and Life Threatening Illnesses Among High-Risk \nInfants: A Randomized Controlled Trial, 284 J. Am. Med.

Gen., of State of N.Y., for defendant N.Y. State Dept. of Social Services.\n1195  MEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n*1195\nSIFTON, District Judge.\nThis class action is before the Court on (1) plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment to make permanent the\npreliminary injunction entered by this Court on March 5, 1987, enjoining the denial of Medicaid coverage for\nprenatal care to financially eligible pregnant undocumented alien women in New York State; (2) plaintiffs' motion\nfor summary declaratory judgment or injunction extending Medicaid eligibility to poor undocumented alien\nchildren in New York State; and (3) the federal defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment on the same\nissues.\nBACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs commenced this class action to challenge a 1973 regulation of the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices (the \"Secretary\") and a companion New York State regulation both denying Medicaid benefits to aliens\nexcept those who are lawfully admitted for permanent residence or permanently residing in the United States\nunder color of law (\"PRUCOL\"). On July 14, 1986, this Court determined that the regulations were not authorized\nunder the Medicaid statute. Lewis v. Gross, 663 F.Supp. 1164 (E.D.N.Y.1986). The Court did not reach plaintiffs'\nother claims challenging the regulations.\nFollowing that decision but before a final judgment was entered, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget\nReconciliation Act of 1986 (\"OBRA-86\"), Pub.L. No. 99-509, reprinted in 10 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News (100\nStat.) (Dec.1986). Section 9406 of OBRA-86 provided the missing statutory authority for imposing restrictions on\nMedicaid eligibility for aliens. The law stated that \"no payment may be made to a State under this section for\nmedical assistance furnished to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise\npermanently residing in the United States under color of law.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(v)(1). The federal defendant\nsought reconsideration of this Court's prior ruling in light of this legislative change.\nAt the same time, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on the ground that the unborn children of all alien\nwomen in this country, whether PRUCOL or not, were eligible for Medicaid under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(i) as\nthemselves citizens included within the statutory category of eligible \"individuals under the age of 21.\" The Court\nfound that the plaintiffs had shown irreparable injury and a likelihood of prevailing at trial on their claims and\nissued a preliminary injunction preventing defendants from denying Medicaid coverage for prenatal care to alien\n\nwomen residing in New York State with a medically verifiable pregnancy if the unborn child would be eligible for\nMedicaid if born at the time of the application. See Memorandum and Order, March 5, 1987.\nPlaintiffs now seek to make that preliminary injunction permanent on statutory and constitutional grounds. They\nalso challenge the Secretary's interpretation of the PRUCOL restrictions on statutory and constitutional grounds.\nFor the reasons discussed below, the preliminary injunction is now made permanent. Additionally, a hearing is\nordered to determine whether all or part of the plaintiff class of undocumented alien children should be\nconsidered PRUCOL and, thus, entitled to Medicaid payments. Thus, the first of plaintiffs' motions for summary\njudgment listed above is granted. The second and third motions listed above are denied.\nFACTS\nThe basic facts are not disputed, except where indicated.\nIt is not disputed that a substantial number of alien pregnant women who are not presently residing in this country\nunder color of law will have their babies in the United States. Under federal law and the Constitution, these\nbabies will be citizens of this country. See, e.g., INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 105 S.Ct. 2098, 85 L.Ed.2d\n452 (1985).\n1196 It is also undisputed that prenatal care is critical to the health of a substantial number *1196 of these future\ncitizens. Children who do not receive prenatal care are, it is undisputed, far more likely to be born with severe\nand debilitating mental and physical deformities.\nDefendants also do not dispute that from a cost effectiveness perspective prenatal care is far superior to\nsubsequent treatment of preventable birth defects. Congress has recognized this cost effectiveness in expanding\nMedicaid eligibility for pregnant women. 1986 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 3607, 3688-92.\nDefendants also do not dispute the proposition that the social costs of failing to provide prenatal care are\nsubstantial. As a result of handicaps related to birth defects, many of these children, now born citizens, will be\nunable to lead productive lives in this country because of their conditions and will be supported by a variety of\nother social welfare programs.\nPlaintiffs also submit undisputed evidence as to the effects of failing to provide non-emergency medical care to\nalien children in support of their application for injunctive relief based on the Secretary's alleged denial of\nMedicaid payments to such children who are, plaintiffs contend, PRUCOL. Where such children do not receive\npreventive health care, it is undisputed that some will end up with severe medical conditions that could have\notherwise been avoided. Where an illness becomes an emergency medical condition such that aid will be\nprovided, even under the Secretary's interpretation of the statute, the government will end up paying the medical\ncosts. Further, some number of citizen children and adults will undoubtedly contract contagious diseases as a\nresult of the failure to provide preventive medical care to alien children, imposing unquantifiable additional social\nand economic costs on the country.\nA dispute exists as to INS' policy towards alien children in New York. Defendants contest plaintiffs' contention that\nINS never deports alien children in New York. While the evidence establishes that INS does not formally deport\nalien children, the Secretary contends that INS uses other means to enforce their departure from this country and\nthat, as a result, they cannot be considered PRUCOL.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that a court shall grant summary judgment if it determines that\nthere is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\" A party moving for summary judgment has the burden of proving that no genuine issue of material fact\nexists. Rule 56(e) provides that a party opposing summary judgment \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or\ndenials of his pleading, but ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" See \nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). A party opposing\nsummary judgment may request that the Court search the record and grant it summary judgment if it establishes\nthat there are no genuine issues of material fact raised by plaintiff.\n\nIn this case, no genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to plaintiffs' motion concerning pregnant, non-\nPRUCOL aliens. However, because there are genuine issues of fact surrounding the motion for summary\njudgment regarding undocumented alien children, both plaintiffs' and defendants' motions for summary judgment\nare denied pending a hearing to resolve these factual disputes.\nDISCUSSION\nMEDICAID ELIGIBILITY FOR PREGNANT, NON-PRUCOL WOMEN\nOn March 5, 1987, this Court entered a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from \"denying Medicaid\ncoverage for prenatal care to alien women residing in New York State with a medically verifiable pregnancy if her\nunborn child would be eligible for Medicaid if born at the time of application.\" Plaintiffs now seek to make that\npreliminary injunctive relief permanent. That relief is granted.\n1197  AID TO THE UNBORN\n*1197\nPlaintiffs' principal contention is that they or their unborn children are eligible for medicaid under 42 U.S.C. §\n1396d(a)(i) which grants aid to citizen \"individuals under the age of 21.\" Plaintiffs claim that their unborn fetuses\nshould be included in this category.\nAdministrative Interpretation\nIn this Court's March 5, 1987 Memorandum and Order granting a preliminary injunction, the Court recognized\nthat both the federal and state defendants shared \"a longstanding administrative interpretation\" of the Medicaid\nstatute that the unborn were to be classified as \"individuals under the age of 21\" for Medicaid eligibility purposes. \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(i). Further, the Court noted that defendants have in the past interpreted the Medicaid\nstatute to provide prenatal care for pregnant women, themselves ineligible for Medicaid, on behalf of the unborn if\nthe unborn would be Medicaid eligible if born at the time of the Medicaid application.\nThe Court found that the Secretary's longstanding interpretation extending coverage to the unborn was\nconsistent with the purposes and policies of the Medicaid program, because the \"undisputed medical evidence\nshows the overwhelming importance of proper prenatal care to the future health of the infant.\" See Memorandum\nand Order, March 5, 1987, at 27.\nRecently, however, the federal defendant has repudiated this interpretation of the medicaid laws and decided that\nthe unborn are not included within the category of \"individuals under 21.\" The federal defendant urges that the\nCourt's previous decision, based on the federal defendant's earlier interpretation of the statute, now be reversed\nin the light of the Secretary's new understanding of the statute.\nDeference to Agency Interpretations\nThe first question is how much deference is due from this Court to the more recent interpretation of the agency.\nThe federal defendant contends that the principles of Chevron, USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467\nU.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), control this analysis. The Supreme Court has stated:\n\"[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court\nis whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\"\nSullivan v. Everhart, 494 U.S. 83, 110 S.Ct. 960, 964, 108 L.Ed.2d 72 (1990) (citations omitted).\n\nHowever, in this case, the high level of deference ordered by Chevron is inappropriate. The policy of excluding\nunborn children of non-PRUCOL women from the Medicaid program is interpretative, not legislative. See \nBatterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 2399, 2405 n. 9, 53 L.Ed.2d 448 (1977); Doe v. Reivitz, 830\nF.2d 1441, 1446 (7th Cir.1987). The agency has not engaged in notice and comment rule making but has\nestablished its new policy through a unilaterally issued \"State plan pre-print\" and Regional Office Manual.\nTherefore, this Court need not find the agency's interpretation of the Medicaid statute controlling. St. Mary's\nHospital v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield Ass'n, 788 F.2d 888, 890 (2d Cir.1986).\nStill, agency interpretations of congressional enactments are entitled to weight. St. Mary's Hospital, supra.\nConsistency with prior and subsequent pronouncements is a factor to be considered in determining how much\ndeference to accord to an agency's interpretation of a statute. The agency in this case has renounced a\nlongstanding interpretation that the unborn are covered under Medicaid as \"individuals under 21.\" This shift in\nposition warrants less deference to the agency's views than would otherwise be appropriate. \"An agency\ninterpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the agency's earlier interpretation is `entitled to\nconsiderably less deference' than a consistently held agency view.\" INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 447\nn. 30, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1221 n. 30, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (quoting Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 273, 101 S.Ct.\n1673, 1681, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981)).\n1198 Status of the Unborn\n*1198\nBecause the Court is far from bound by the agency interpretation of the medicaid statute, the statute itself must\nagain be examined. The statute does not directly address the issue of coverage for the unborn children of alien\nwomen not themselves eligible for Medicaid. The absence of specific provisions for such coverage may, however,\nbe of some significance in the light of the statute's history.\nThe unborn were at one time included as Medicaid-eligible because the AFDC statute provided AFDC eligibility to\nthe unborn, and Medicaid eligibility turned on AFDC eligibility. However, in 1981, the AFDC statute was amended\nto exclude eligibility for the unborn, replacing it with expanded coverage for pregnant women. As a result,\nMedicaid coverage for the unborn was eliminated and coverage for pregnant women, initiated. See 42 U.S.C. §\n1396d(a)(viii) (pregnant women added as an eligibility group to Medicaid statute).\nSubsequently, in recent years, Congress explicitly considered the need for and importance of Medicaid coverage\nof prenatal care and has specifically responded to that need by expanding Medicaid coverage for pregnant\nwomen. The federal defendant argues that these amendments leave no doubt that Congress does not intend to\ncover unborns in their own right. In these amendments, the federal defendant argues, Congress made clear that\nit intended to provide prenatal care for the unborn through the provisions of such care to pregnant women.\nThus, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (\"DRA\"), enacted before the Secretary changed his position on the\neligibility of unborn children of non-PRUCOL alien women, added as a mandatory categorically needy group all\npregnant women who would be eligible for AFDC if their unborn children were already born and were living with\nthem at the time of payment. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i), 1396d(n)(1). Congress made clear that,\nalthough it was the \"pregnant woman\" who was the Medicaid recipient, for purposes of determining the woman's\nfinancial eligibility, the state is to assume that the child is born and living with the pregnant woman. The Secretary\nthus requires states to consider the unborn child as living with the woman at the time of the application. 52\nFed.Reg. 430665 (Nov. 9, 1987). OBRA of 1986 again expanded optional coverage of pregnant women, giving\nthe states the option of covering pregnant women who do not satisfy the categorical requirements of AFDC and\nwhose financial situation places them at 100% of the federal poverty level. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(l). Congress once\nagain included the unborn child for purposes of determining the financial eligibility of the pregnant woman. Since\n1986, Congress has further expanded optional and mandatory coverage for pregnant woman under OBRA of\n1987 and the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988.\nThe federal defendant argues that what is significant in all of these amendments is that the entity whose eligibility\nis at issue is the pregnant women rather than the fetus she carries. Thus, Congress appears, as a matter of\n\nlegislative style, to have chosen to use the pregnant women eligibility group as the vehicle for providing Medicaid\ncoverage of prenatal care.\nIn all events, the phrase \"individuals under the age of 21\" does not easily apply to unborn children under ordinary\nusage. The unborn are not \"persons\" under the Constitution. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35\nL.Ed.2d 147 (1973). In addition, the \"age\" of any individual is normally computed from birth. While the statute\ndoes not require calculation of the precise age \"under 21\" of \"individuals under the age of 21,\" it is apparent that\nany construction of the phrase \"individuals under the age of 21\" which will accommodate the unborn is not\nordinary usage. Accordingly, I conclude that Congress did not intend the phrase \"individuals under the age of 21\"\nto include the unborn.\nAID SHOULD BE GRANTED TO \"QUALIFIED PREGNANT WOMEN\"\n1199 Section 1396d(a)(i) does not entitle the \"unborn\" to receive benefits in their *1199 own right. However, other\ncongressional changes in the complex system of providing medical benefits for the needy have, I conclude,\nmooted the question. In 1984, Congress passed Pub.Law 98-369, § 2361(a). This law amended the present §\n1396a(a)(10)(A) to expand the categories of mandatory eligible Medicaid recipients. As part of this expansion,\nCongress added subsection (III) which created another new category of eligibility, \"qualified pregnant women.\" An\nexamination of that subsection reveals that the fetus is entitled to receive aid through its mother, even where the\nmother, prior to pregnancy, is not herself, by reason of her status with INS, eligible for aid.\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(III) provides Medicaid to all \"qualified pregnant women.\" For reasons set out\nbelow, I find that the \"plain language\" of § 1396 includes pregnant non-PRUCOL aliens in the class of \"qualified\npregnant women.\" This reading is bolstered by the congressional intent reflected in the legislative history.\n42 U.S.C. § 1396d(n) defines a \"qualified pregnant woman\" as follows:\n\"The term `qualified pregnant woman or child' means ... a pregnant woman who ... would be\neligible for aid to families with dependent children under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter ... if\nher child had been born and was living with her in the month such aid would be paid.\"\nThe \"plain English\" meaning of this statute is that certain pregnant women, not themselves eligible for medical\nassistance, should nevertheless receive benefits by reason of the status of the unborn child. These benefits\nshould be granted when the ineligible women are (1) pregnant and (2) carrying children whose birth will render\nthe resulting family \"eligible for aid to families with dependent children [AFDC].\"\nSince the non-PRUCOL applicant living in the United States applies for aid under a statute which requires the\nassumption that the child \"had been born ... in [that] month,\" following § 1396d(n)'s prescribed fiction, the child is\nconsidered \"constructively\" born in the United States and, thus, a United States citizen.\nThis attention to the status and needs of the unborn child reflects the statute's overall orientation. AFDC\n[1]\nconcentrates on the needs of the child, not the parent.  If the child meets the various criteria to qualify as a\n\"dependent child\" then aid will be granted to the child and his or her family. 42 U.S.C. § 606.\nAmong the relevant criteria is the requirement that the dependent child be a citizen. 42 U.S.C. § 602(a)(33); Rios-\n[2]\nPineda, supra. However, as noted above, the \"constructive infant\" is a citizen.  The constructive child and family\n1200 must meet *1200 certain income requirements. 42 U.S.C. §§ 602(a)(18) et seq. However, nothing in the record of\nthis case suggests that plaintiffs' class is so wealthy that they would not qualify for aid. Beyond this, nothing in the\nstatute suggests that the \"constructive child\" would not qualify as a \"dependent child.\" Thus, the family (mother\nand fictitious child) is entitled to aid under AFDC.\nThe relevant case law supports this conclusion. Thus, in Doe v. Reivitz, 830 F.2d 1441 (7th Cir.1987), the court\nheld that citizen children of illegal alien parents are entitled to benefits under AFDC. Id. at 1451 (\"The illegal alien\nparents of these [citizen] children are not seeking benefits for themselves. We do not think that the intent to\nexclude citizen and eligible alien children from the AFDC-UP program should be lightly imputed to Congress.\").\n\nThis holding is nothing more than another example of the general and well-established rule that, where a child is\nqualified for AFDC, non-economic factors affecting the parents or household generally cannot be used to deny\naid. This general rule exists in several forms. It was first articulated as the \"Flemming Rule,\" which in its codified\nform held that state-AFDC programs could not deny aid \"to a child because of the conditions in the home in\nwhich the child resides.\" 42 U.S.C. § 604(b). The Supreme Court has given a broad reading to this rule, holding\nthat factors which do not affect the child's economic well-being cannot be used to deny aid. King v. Smith, 392\nU.S. 309, 329, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 2139, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968). See also Quern v. Mandley, 436 U.S. 725, 739-43,\n98 S.Ct. 2068, 2076-79, 56 L.Ed.2d 658 (1978); Taylor v. Lavin, 497 F.2d 1208, 1214 (2d Cir.1974),rev'd on other\ngrounds, 421 U.S. 338, 95 S.Ct. 1741, 44 L.Ed.2d 208 (1975). Thus, where the dependent child is a citizen and\notherwise eligible for AFDC, the non-citizen status of the parents cannot be used to deny aid.\nBecause this \"constructive\" family would be eligible for AFDC, the mothers in this family meet the tests of §\n1396d(n) of the Medicaid statute and must be considered a \"qualified pregnant woman.\" Thus, while non-\nPRUCOL pregnant aliens are not themselves eligible for medical assistance, as a result of their pregnancy they\nare entitled to prenatal and other medical care under the \"qualified pregnant woman\" rule.\nThe congressional purposes behind both the Medicaid statute and the AFDC program support this interpretation.\nCongress' intent with respect to Medicaid for prenatal care was to assure that the fetus is born as a healthy child\n[3]\nwho does not, as a citizen, become a burden on the country's social welfare system.  As with AFDC, the\nconcentration of attention is upon the children or unborn children, and the mother becomes a convenient means\nthrough which this aid to the child can be furnished.\nGiven these purposes, it makes no sense to determine whether a fetus should receive aid based on the status of\nits mother. If the fetus is the intended beneficiary, aid should be granted based on the beneficiary's qualifications.\nSince the statute's ultimate goal is to benefit the fetus after birth 00 to deliver a healthy baby 00 it is common sense\n97 97\nto look to post-birth not pre-birth qualifications.\nThe Secretary argues that the fetus' potential eligibility for aid is irrelevant because the statute only refers to the\npregnant mother's eligibility. However, as noted above, this interpretation disregards the Medicaid Act's plain\nlanguage, which bases eligibility on AFDC standards which in turn base eligibility on the status of the unborn\nchild. Congress did not intend that § 1396d(n) refer to the pregnant mother's eligibility for AFDC, since no parent\nis of her own sake eligible for AFDC. In addition, determining eligibility based on the mother's qualifications rather\nthan those of the child-to-be goes against the intended purpose of the act, a purpose which the federal defendant\nrecognizes.\n1201 *1201 Defendants also argue that, since § 1396b(v) of the statute now prohibits payments to non-PRUCOL aliens\nexcept in emergency situations, it prohibits coverage of prenatal care for the children of such aliens even though\nsuch children are deemed United States citizens for the purpose of determining their eligibility for such care. This\nargument as well must be rejected.\nAs the foregoing discussion of the interrelation of Medicaid for pregnant women and AFDC makes clear, the\nintended recipients of the medical coverage for prenatal care are not the non-PRUCOL mothers, but their future\nchildren. Non-PRUCOL pregnant aliens serve simply as the conduit for delivering the aid to their children.\nThe legislative history of the recent legislation also supports the conclusion that subsection (v) does not bar\nMedicaid coverage for prenatal care for the citizen children of alien mothers. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation\nAct of 1986 (\"OBRA-86\"), from which much of the present § 1396b stems, was designed to cut costs. As the chair\nof the congressional committee that passed the Medicaid sections of OBRA-86 wrote: \"The Committee is greatly\nconcerned about the federal deficit.... In the health field, the Committee adopted extensive provisions that\nachieve very substantial savings.\" 1986 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News at 3636.\nOne cost-cutting measure was a significant expansion of the groups of women eligible for prenatal care. As the\ncommittee report accompanying OBRA-86 explained, this expansion would significantly reduce costs because\n\"each dollar spent on prenatal care could save over three dollars in reduced health care costs for the care of low\nbirthweight infants.\" Id. at 3688. This conclusion, of course, is amply supported by current medical literature. See,\n\ne.g., 313 New Eng.J.Med. 44 (1985) (studies show that proper prenatal care reduces incidents of low birthweight\nby 75 percent).\nSubsection (v) represents another cost-cutting measure. This subsection prohibits direct payments of Medicaid to\naliens who are not legal residents or PRUCOL except in emergencies, thus cutting the total number of people\nentitled to U.S. Government assistance. However, nothing in the section or its purposes requires that the citizen\nbabies of non-PRUCOL aliens must also be denied prenatal care. Indeed, reading subsection (v) to exclude\nprenatal care for the citizen children of non-PRUCOL aliens would have the effect, as Congress explicitly\nrecognized, of increasing rather than decreasing costs since the ineligible aliens will give birth in the United\nStates and their children become citizens entitled to medical aid, as Congress also recognized. To deny one\ndollar in prenatal care now would cost three dollars in other federal benefits later when many of the fetuses will\nbe born with significant birth defects.\nCongress recognized that subsection (v) should not be used to deny aid, when such denial would ultimately\nincrease, not decrease, costs. The congressional report accompanying OBRA-86 urges administrators to read\nsubsection (v) \"broadly\" to include potential recipients when possible. Thus, subsection (v)'s ban on \"medical\nassistance furnished to an alien\" should not be read to apply to aid clearly understood by Congress to be\ndestined for a future citizen who will be a greater social burden later if denied such care now.\nIt should be noted that this interpretation hardly renders subsection (v) meaningless. Section 1396 covers many\nmedical services beyond prenatal care. Subsection (v) under any interpretation prohibits provision of non-\nemergency services to non-PRUCOL aliens except as incidental beneficiaries of the prenatal care of their citizen\nchildren.\nDespite this strong statement of congressional intent, defendants note that the Secretary of HHS has adopted a\nnarrower interpretation of OBRA in his regulations implementing OBRA-86 and urge this Court to do the same. \nSee 55 Fed.Reg. 36816. However, as previously noted in this opinion, this Court is not bound by the\ninterpretation offered by the Secretary. For a variety of considerations including those already discussed and\n1202 others discussed *1202 below, the government's interpretation, while entitled to deference, must be rejected.\nAvoiding Constitutional Conflicts (Ashwander)\nIn choosing between two potential interpretations of a statute, courts must choose the one, if it exists, that avoids\na constitutional conflict. As Justice Brandeis explained:\n\"The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record,\nif there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of.... `When the\nvalidity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of\nconstitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a\nconstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.'\"\nAshwander v. Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 347-48, 56 S.Ct. 466, 483, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J,\nconcurring) (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 297, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932)). This rule has,\nof course, been followed in this circuit. \"If a court can decide a case on non-constitutional grounds, it should not\nstray into the field of constitutional analysis.\" F.E.C. v. Central Long Island Tax Reform, 616 F.2d 45, 52 (2d\nCir.1980). See also Carlin Communications v. F.C.C., 749 F.2d 113 (2d Cir.1984); Occidental Chemical Corp v.\nF.E.R.C., 869 F.2d 127 (2d Cir.1989).\nThe two interpretations presented this Court present the kind of choice referred to in Ashwander and Central\nLong Island Tax Reform. The first interpretation of subsection (v) allowing payments for prenatal care for infant\ncitizens of non-PRUCOL aliens avoids constitutional decision making. The second option, however, would force\nthis court to confront several complex constitutional issues of first impression.\nRuling that § 1396b(v) excludes prenatal care for the as-yet-unborn citizen would present this Court with\nsubstantial constitutional questions of considerable difficulty. In Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72\nL.Ed.2d 786 (1982), the Supreme Court ruled that a state could not \"rationally\" bar the children of illegal aliens\n\nfrom attending school. In holding that this ban was irrational and that it violated the equal protection clause, the\nCourt explained:\n\"[L]egislation directing the onus of a parent's misconduct against his children does not comport\nwith fundamental conceptions of justice. `[V]isiting ... condemnation on the head of an infant is\nillogical and unjust. Moreover, imposing disabilities on the ... child is contrary to the basic concept\nof our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility or\nwrongdoing'. ... It is thus difficult to conceive of a rational justification for penalizing these children\nfor their presence within the United States....\n....\n\"In addition, education provides the basic tools by which individuals might lead economically\nproductive lives to the benefit of us all.... We cannot ignore the significant social costs borne by\nour Nation when select groups are denied the means to absorb the values and skills upon which\nour social order rests.\"\n457 U.S. 202, 220-22, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 2396-97.\nIt is argued by plaintiffs here that the same logic applies to their situation. Denying prenatal care will result in the\nbirth of numerous citizens hampered by severe birth defects. Not only will such children suffer for themselves, but\nthe burden of caring for a deformed child may demand such time and resources from its parents as to prevent\nthem from otherwise leading economically productive lives. The point is well documented. As sociologist William\nJulius Wilson has noted:\n\"For the overwhelmingly female-headed ghetto underclass families, access to quality child care\nbecomes a critical issue if steps are taken to move single mothers into education and training\nprograms and/or full- or part-time employment.\"\n1203 *1203 W.J. Wilson, The Truly Disadvantaged 153-54 (1987). If care of healthy children can create such obstacles\nto employment, care of handicapped children will compound the problem. As Wilson explains:\n\"[A]s long as some poor families are unable to work because of physical or other disabilities,\npublic assistance would be needed even if the government adopted a program of welfare reform\nthat included child support enforcement and family allowance provisions.\"\nId. at 154. Thus, denying prenatal care may be forcefully argued to lack the same \"rational justification\" as\ndenying education lacked in Plyler. As such, the denial of prenatal care in the circumstances here presented may\nwell violate the equal protection clause.\nDefendants do not dispute these economic results. Rather, they argue that Plyler does not apply because it dealt\nwith already-born children (\"persons\") while the present case deals only with the unborn, who are not \"persons\"\nunder the fifth or fourteenth amendments. While this is true, it ignores the fact that, as stated above, the pregnant\nmothers will also be affected. While the pregnant mothers are not citizens, neither were the child-plaintiffs in \nPlyler.\nDefendants additionally argue that Plyler dealt with a state, not federal, law. As the Plyler Court notes, a federal\nlaw would be entitled to substantially greater deference. However, as both the Court in Plyler, and the Court in \nMathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976), on which defendants rely heavily, note,\neven the federal government may not violate the rights of aliens with impunity. \"The Fifth Amendment protects\naliens whose presence in this country is unlawful from invidious discrimination by the Federal Government.\" \nPlyler, supra 457 U.S. at 210, 102 S.Ct. at 2391 (citing Mathews).\nThe Court of Appeals for this circuit has recently considered the issue of the deference owed the federal\ngovernment in alienage and immigration matters. Azizi v. Thornburgh, 908 F.2d 1130 (2d Cir.1990). The Azizi\ncourt held that the federal government is entitled to great deference in this area. Specifically, it held that\ndeportation regulations affecting the right to marriage, a right usually accorded strict scrutiny, need only pass a\n\nrational basis test. However, the court explicitly rejected the government's claim that in the field of immigration the\ncourts should avoid any involvement at all.\n\"[T]he government suggests that [the case law] mandates a lower level of scrutiny than is required\nby the rational basis test. We find that no distinction is intended by the descriptive language and\ntherefore conclude that the rational basis test is applicable.\n....\n\"While great deference must be accorded Congress' decision to classify aliens in such a manner,\nthe government must demonstrate some legitimate reason for adoption of the classification.\"\nAzizi, supra at 1133.\nIn setting some standard for review of congressional legislation, the Court of Appeals has held that such\nlegislation \"must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and\nsubstantial relation to the object of the legislation.\" Francis v. I.N.S., 532 F.2d 268, 272 (2d Cir.1976) (The court\nstruck down legislation distinguishing aliens who left the country and then returned from those who never left.\nThe court found that this distinction bore no rational relation to the object of the relevant immigration laws).\nGiven the stated objectives of the Medicaid statute and of OBRA, subsection (v)'s \"relation to the object\" of the\nstatutes seems, at best, unclear. As noted above, it may be argued with considerable force that an interpretation\nof subsection (v), which denies the benefits in this case, would directly undermine both the beneficent purposes\nof Medicaid and the cost-cutting objectives of OBRA.\nThis Court should not lightly engage in this constitutional scrutiny of Congress' justifications for its laws or\n1204 entertain the entirely new question of the rights of the unborn citizen. As noted above, Ashwander*1204 requires\nthis Court to avoid such constitutional analysis when possible. Because a \"construction of [§ 1396b(v)] is fairly\npossible by which the [constitutional problems] may be avoided,\" this construction is appropriately followed.\nAccordingly, § 1396b(v) is appropriately read as granting coverage for prenatal care for citizen children of non-\nPRUCOL aliens.\nMEDICAID ELIGIBILITY FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIEN CHILDREN\nPlaintiffs also move to enjoin the defendants from denying Medicaid benefits to undocumented alien children, and\ndefendants have cross-moved for summary judgment in their favor on this issue. Because several disputes exist\nwith respect to the material facts, both parties' motions for summary judgment on this issue must be denied.\nThe crux of the plaintiffs' argument is that undocumented, alien children are residing in this country under color of\nlaw (PRUCOL) and, thus, may not be denied Medicaid benefits by reason of 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(v), supra.\nDefendants contend that these children are non-PRUCOL and that subsection (v) prohibits granting them\nMedicaid coverage.\nIn discussing the new subsection (v), the committee report accompanying OBRA-86 states:\n\"[T]he Secretary and the States [shall] broadly interpret the phrase `under color of law' to include\nall of the categories recognized by immigration law, policy, and practice.\"\n1986 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 3701.\nIn Holly v. Lavine, 553 F.2d 845, 850 (2d Cir.1977) the court considered who should and who should not be\nincluded in the category of \"under color of law,\" concluding that the phrase00\n97\n\"encircles the law, its shadows, and its penumbra. When an administrative agency or legislative\nbody uses the phrase `under color of law' it deliberately sanctions the inclusion of cases that are,\nin strict terms, outside the law but are near its border.\"\n\nThe Secretary, in the agency's 1987 Operating Instructions implementing OBRA-86, set out the following\ndefinition of PRUCOL:\n\"Aliens who are PRUCOL and who may be eligible for Medicaid are aliens [who] are residing in\nthe United States with the knowledge and permission of the INS and whose departure from the\nUnited States the INS does not contemplate enforcing. An alien will be considered as one whose\ndeparture the INS does not contemplate enforcing if:\n\"a. it is the policy or practice of the INS not to enforce the departure of aliens in a particular\ncategory; or\n\"b. on all the facts and circumstances in that particular case, it appears that INS is otherwise\npermitting the alien to reside in the United States indefinitely.\"\n1987 Operating Instructions at 3-3-21. This Court's March 5, 1987 decision, supra, held that the above standard\nof PRUCOL was a reasonable interpretation of congressional intent.\nUnder this definition, plaintiffs must prove three things in order to be considered PRUCOL and, thus, eligible for\naid: First, the INS has \"knowledge\" of the children's existence in this country; second, the INS is \"permitting\"\nthese children to remain in the country; third, the INS does not \"contemplate enforcing\" the children's departure.\nGenuine issues of fact exist as to whether undocumented alien children meet each of these three tests.\nPlaintiffs must first show that the children in question resided in this country \"with the knowledge\" of the INS.\nThe government maintains that \"knowledge\" requires some documentary record of the existence of specific\nchildren in the files of the INS 00 that is, they claim that children cannot exist in this country \"with the knowledge\"\n97\nof the INS unless they are documented. The government claims that undocumented aliens such as the children\nin question here cannot be known to the INS. In support of this interpretation, defendants point to another\n1205 regulation in the *1205 1987 Operating Instructions, supra, which states: \"If an alien does not have ... any type of\nINS documentation, that person is not a lawful permanent resident or PRUCOL.\" Operating Inst. at 3-3-20.\n[4]\nThe government's interpretation must be rejected. Not only does it conflict with ordinary usage,  but it conflicts\nas well with Congress' and the Court of Appeals' instructions to read PRUCOL broadly.\nSince the government's narrow interpretation must be rejected, some other definition of \"knowledge\" is still\nrequired. Under a fair, broad, and reasonable interpretation of the term, knowledge includes that of which one is\naware from personal observation. Moreover, where a person is aware of a high probability of something but\ndeliberately avoids enlightenment, this too constitutes knowledge. As long ago as 1869, the Supreme Court\ndeclared that \"it is well-settled law that a party cannot willfully shut his eyes to the means of knowledge ... and\nthereby escape the consequences which would flow from the notice if it had actually been received.\" The Lulu, 10\nWall. 192, 201, 19 L.Ed. 906 (1869). See also Armstrong v. McAlpin, 699 F.2d 79 (2d Cir.1983); NLRB v. Local 3,\n216 F.2d 285 (2d Cir.1954); People v. Sugarman, 216 A.D. 209, 215 N.Y.S. 56, 63 (1st Dep't 1926) (\"If defendant\ndid not know of the specific [facts] his lack of knowledge resulted from an avoidance of any endeavor to know\nwhat happened ... which amounts in law to knowledge.\").\nTo apply these well-accepted definitions of knowledge to this case, several factual issues must be resolved. The\nINS clearly has actual knowledge of the existence of a substantial number of undocumented alien children. See\nNote 5, supra. However, a determination whether appropriate officials of the INS have consciously realized and\ndeliberately closed their eyes to the existence of an entire class of such children is a fact-based inquiry which\ncannot be resolved on these papers.\nThe next two prongs of this issue likewise present factual issues incapable of resolution on these papers.\nAssuming that INS does have knowledge of the plaintiff class of undocumented children, have they, in the past,\npermitted the children to remain in the country and do they, in the future, intend not to deport them?\n\nPlaintiffs claim that, while illegal alien children are here without de jure permission, as a matter of policy and\npractice the INS permits them to remain and does not contemplate deporting them. See 1986 U.S.Code Cong. &\nAdmin.News 3701, supra (urging consideration not only of \"immigration law\" but also INS \"policy and practice\").\nIn support of their claim, plaintiffs point to the deposition testimony of INS Representative Friess:\n\"Q: Now, if the parents are in fact deported and they leave the country and they leave the child\nbehind, whether with a close relative or somebody like that, would there then be no order to show\ncause that would be issued against that child left behind?\n\"A: Our experience tells us that that almost never happens because the parents usually have an\nattachment for their children. In fact, we would make some arrangement to get the child out\nwithout deportation. Usually working through the consulate of the country from which they came.\n\"Q: But you would not deport the child?\n\"A: We could not legally.\"\nFriess Testimony, App. D to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 51.\nThe defendants deny that as a matter of practice they do not deport children. In fact, they point to the same\ntestimony quoted above and specifically to the claim that \"we would make some arrangement to get the child out\n1206 without deportation.\" Thus, the defendants argue, even though formal *1206 deportation proceedings will not be\ninstituted against children, these children, once discovered, will still not be permitted to remain within the country.\n[5]\nClearly, the facts here are in dispute. Exactly how INS deals with illegal alien children once these children are\n[6]\nbrought to INS' attention is a crucial factual matter that must be settled before this Court can render a decision.\nAccordingly, hearings must be held in which each side can attempt to prove its respective factual contentions.\nFor all of the reasons stated above, summary judgment on the issue of Medicaid eligibility of alien children is\ndenied to both parties.\nCONCLUSION\nNon-PRUCOL, pregnant aliens are, as a matter of law, \"qualified pregnant women\" who are entitled to Medicaid\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). These women are not barred from receiving aid by 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(v).\nAccordingly, plaintiffs are entitled to a permanent injunction preventing the defendants from denying aid to these\nplaintiffs.\nNumerous factual issues must be resolved before this Court can determine whether illegal alien children are\nPRUCOL and thus entitled to aid. Thus, on this second issue, summary judgment is denied to both sides, and a\nhearing is ordered to settle these factual disputes.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] \"The term `aid to families with dependent children' means money payments with respect to a dependent\nchild.\" 42 U.S.C. § 606. \"[The act was created for] the purpose of encouraging the care of dependent children in\ntheir own homes ... by enabling each State to furnish financial assistance ... to needy dependent children and the\nparents or relatives with whom they are living.\" 42 U.S.C. § 601.\n[2] The government argues that the citizenship of the fetus must be the same as the mother. This, however, is\nbeside the point. Section 1396d(n) does not require ascertaining the alienage status of the actual fetus. Rather, it\nrequires us to examine a legislatively constructed setting in which the fetus has been born. Thus, in this section,\nwe are not concerned with the status of the fetus at all but with a constructive child. \n\nThe citizenship requirement also requires consideration of the citizenship of the \"caretaker relative.\" However, the\nlaw only requires such consideration to the extent that the caretaker relative's \"needs are to be taken into account\nin making the determination [of total funding level].\" See also Sudomir v. McMahon, 767 F.2d 1456, 1458 (9th\nCir.1985) (\"Her [the non-PRUCOL applicant's] application for AFDC benefits was rejected in part by the\nDepartment because [she was non-PRUCOL]. That is, the Department ignored [plaintiff's] own needs in\ncalculating her family's monthly AFDC grant.\").\nClearly, the plaintiff's non-PRUCOL status would result in a lower level of benefits, because this person's needs\nwould not be taken into account when setting a benefit level. However, the case at bar does not concern the level\nof AFDC benefits. Rather, it simply requires a determination of whether the family would be eligible for any\nbenefits at all. Neither the statute nor the case law suggests that the parents' status would render the dependent\nchild entirely ineligible.\n[3] Given the current constitutional problems surrounding the rights of fetuses, it makes perfect sense that\nCongress should choose this more indirect route toward supplying them with aid.\n[4] The INS' designated representative for depositions on INS practices in New York State clearly stated that the\nINS \"knows\" in the ordinary sense of the term of the existence of undocumented aliens. In fact, the INS is even\naware of the existence of specific children in those cases where the parents have been deported but the children\nhave not. See\nDeposition of INS Representative Friess, App. D to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 51.\n[5] The federal defendant also argues that INS regulations specifically call for the deportation of minor illegal\naliens. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 242-3(a), 103.5a(c). This, however, may not be particularly relevant to the current\ndiscussion. Even if INS as a matter of policy will deport alien children, if as a matter of practice they do not, then\nthe children will still be PRUCOL. Additionally, INS policy is to treat minors in accord with local state law, and\nunder New York law INS cannot legally institute deportation proceedings against a child. See NYCPLR §§ 309(a),\n1201, 1203. Thus, the stated national policy of the INS may not even apply here.\n[6] Plaintiffs also raise a number of constitutional arguments. Essentially, they claim that denying Medicaid\nbenefits to these children would violate the equal protection clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.\nThese arguments should not be addressed now. If this court ultimately determines that these children are\nPRUCOL, then they will be granted benefits and the constitutional issue is moot. If these children are not granted\nbenefits, then this Court will, by needs, turn to the constitutional issues. However, as noted supra, constitutional\nissues should not be taken up until all nonconstitutional methods of resolution have been exhausted.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

New York.\nJanuary 19, 2000.\n114434 *143*144 Richard Elliot Blum, Scott A. Rosenberg, The Legal Aid Society Civil Appeal & Law Reform Unit, New\nYork City, for Plaintiff.\nJoan Weiner Margiotta, Corporation Counsel of the City of New York, New York City, Mary Fisher Bernet,\nAttorney General, State of New York, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nSIFTON, Chief Judge.\nOn March 14, 1991, this Court entered a permanent injunction in this class action enjoining the defendants from\ndenying Medicaid coverage for prenatal care to otherwise eligible pregnant aliens on the ground that they were\nnot permanently residing in the United States under color of law. Lewis v. Grinker, 794 F.Supp. 1193\n(E.D.N.Y.1991),aff'd, and reh'g denied,965 F.2d 1206 (2d Cir.1992). Those decisions held that the language of\nthe federal Medicaid statute then at issue, which limited Medicaid coverage for undocumented aliens, should not\nbe interpreted as applying to the provision of Medicaid benefits for prenatal care in the absence of clear evidence\nof Congress' intent to deny coverage for such benefits.\nThis action is once again before this Court on the federal defendant's motion to vacate the permanent injunction.\nThe federal defendant contends that the permanent injunction must be vacated because Congress has now\nprovided evidence of its specific intent to deny Medicaid coverage for prenatal care to undocumented aliens\nthrough its enactment of Title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996\n(the \"Welfare Reform Act\"), Pub.L. No. 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105, 2260.\nFor the reasons set forth below, the federal defendant's motion to vacate the permanent injunction is denied.\nWhat follows sets forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which this determination is based.\nBACKGROUND\nStatutory Framework\nMedicaid was originally enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq. The\nSecond Circuit has described Medicaid as a \"cooperative federal/state cost-sharing program designed to enable\nparticipating states to furnish medical assistance to persons whose income and resources are insufficient to meet\n145 the costs of necessary medical care and services.\" DeJesus v. Perales, 770 F.2d 316, 318 (2d Cir.1985). *145\nStates that choose to participate in the Medicaid program are subject to the requirements of the applicable\nfederal statutes, see 42 U.S.C. § 1396a, and to the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Department\nof Health and Human Services (the \"Secretary\") pursuant thereto.\nThe Medicaid statute requires participating states to provide coverage to two basic categories of individuals: the\n\"categorically needy,\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A), and the \"medically needy,\" id. § 1396a(a)(10)(C). See also 42\n\n[1]\nC.F.R. § 435.4; DeJesus, 770 F.2d at 318.  \"Roughly speaking, the categorically needy are those who earn no\nmore than that necessary to cover the necessities of life; the medically needy differ in that it is only the expense\nof necessary medical care that strains their ability to pay for basic necessities.\" Lewis v. Gross, 663 F.Supp.\n1164, 1174 (E.D.N.Y.1986).\nPrenatal Care Under Medicaid\nUnder current law, pregnant women seeking prenatal care may be eligible for Medicaid under any one of three\ncategories, depending on their financial status. First, participating states must provide Medicaid coverage to a\nsubgroup of the categorically needy, called the \"mandatory categorically needy.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)\n(West Supp.1999). Included in this subgroup are \"qualified pregnant women,\" id. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(III), defined\nas any woman with a \"medically verified\" pregnancy whose household would have been eligible for benefits\nunder the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (\"AFDC\") program \"if her child had been born and was living\nwith her in the month such aid would be paid,\" or who \"meets the income and resource requirements\" of the\n[2]\nAFDC program, as in effect as of July 16, 1996.  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(n)(1)(A), (C).\nSecond, participating states may, at their option, choose to provide Medicaid coverage to individuals called the\n\"optional categorically needy.\" 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii), 1396a(d). This subgroup includes \"pregnant\nwomen\" in general, id. § 1396d(a)(viii), and \"women during pregnancy\" whose household incomes are between\n[3]\n133% and 185% of the federal poverty line, id. § 1396a(l)(1)(A), (2)(A).\nThird, the states may, at their option, choose to provide coverage to \"medically needy\" individuals. Id. § 1396a(a)\n(10)(C). This subgroup includes the same groups of individuals that the states may cover as \"optional\ncategorically needy\" but applies less stringent financial and resource requirements. While medically needy\ncoverage is generally optional with the states, once a state chooses to provide any type of medical coverage to\nsome medically needy individuals, it must provide, inter alia, prenatal and delivery services to medically needy\npregnant women. Id. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(C)(ii)-(iii), 1396d(a)(viii).\n146 Prior to 1981, pregnant women were not identified as a special eligibility group under *146 the Medicaid statute.\n[4]\n Instead, the Secretary gave participating states the option to extend Medicaid benefits directly to the fetus\nunder the assumption that fetuses were optional categorically needy \"persons under the age of 21.\" See Lewis v.\n[5]\nGrinker, 965 F.2d 1206, 1209 (2d Cir.1992) (\"Lewis IV-A\").\nIn the 1980's, Congress adopted a series of laws that greatly expanded access to prenatal care while at the\nsame time shifting the analytical focus from the fetus to the pregnant mother. In the Omnibus Budget\nReconciliation Act of 1981 (\"OBRA '81\"), Pub.L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 357, 853, in place of direct AFDC coverage\nfor the fetus, Congress permitted the states to provide AFDC benefits to women in their third trimester of\npregnancy if they would be eligible for AFDC based on the constructive birth of their fetuses 00 if they would be\n97\neligible had their children been born and living with them at the time the benefits were provided. OBRA '81, §\n2312(a), 95 Stat. 357, 853. OBRA '81, in order to provide pregnant women with prenatal care under Medicaid,\nalso amended the Medicaid statute to authorize states to \"deem\" a pregnant woman an AFDC recipient for\nMedicaid purposes, and thus mandatorily eligible for Medicaid, if the woman would be eligible for AFDC based on\nthe concept of the constructive birth of her fetus. OBRA '81 § 2312(b), 95 Stat. 357, 853. OBRA '81 also required\nstates that provided coverage to medically needy individuals to provide prenatal care to medically needy\npregnant women as well. Thus, states had the option to supply Medicaid coverage for prenatal care to a pregnant\nwoman either as mandatory categorically needy or as medically needy. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(viii) (adding\npregnant women as a separate eligibility group). At the same time, the Secretary continued to give the states the\noption of providing Medicaid coverage directly to the fetus by considering the fetus to be an individual under age\nof 21.\nIn the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-369, 98 Stat. 494 (\"DRA '84\"), Congress further expanded\naccess to prenatal care by requiring the states to provide Medicaid benefits to \"any qualified pregnant woman or\nchild\" as mandatory categorically needy. The statute defined a \"qualified pregnant woman\" as a pregnant woman\nwho would be eligible for AFDC \"if her child had been born and was living with her in the month such aid would\n\nbe paid, and such pregnancy has been medically verified.\" DRA '84 § 2361(b), 98 Stat. 494, 1104 (codified as\namended at 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(n)). The qualified pregnant woman provision expanded access to prenatal care\nbecause, while OBRA '81 merely gave the states the option to employ the constructive birth analysis to deem\npregnant women AFDC recipients for the purposes of providing Medicaid coverage for prenatal care, DRA '84\nrequired the states to do so. By mandating coverage for \"qualified pregnant women,\" the statute also eliminated\n147 categorical barriers in the AFDC program that had arbitrarily limited access to Medicaid *147 for poor pregnant\n[6]\nwomen such as those without any \"dependent children.\"  DRA '84 also ensured that Medicaid coverage would\nfollow the fetus after birth by providing that an infant born to a woman eligible for and receiving Medicaid benefits\non the child's date of birth was automatically covered by Medicaid at birth. DRA '84 § 2362(a), 98 Stat. 494, 1104\n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(e)(4)).\nIn the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, Pub.L. No. 99-272, 100 Stat. 82, 201 (1985) (\"COBRA\"),\nCongress again made it easier for pregnant women to qualify for prenatal care by breaking the link between\nAFDC eligibility and Medicaid eligibility. After COBRA, a prospective qualified pregnant woman only had to\ndemonstrate that she was sufficiently poor to qualify for Medicaid benefits. Because the Secretary interpreted the\nconstructive birth analysis to apply to all three sections of the definition of qualified pregnant woman, the fetus'\ninterest could be considered in determining whether the woman was financially needy. In February 1985, in\nProgram Memorandum # 853, for the first time the Secretary did not list fetuses as one of the categories of\npeople under age 21 to whom the states could, at their option, provide Medicaid. This omission completed the\nshift from fetal-centered to maternal-centered analysis of coverage for prenatal care.\nIn the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (\"OBRA '86\"), Pub.L. No. 99-509, 100 Stat. 1874, Congress\nremoved the categorical eligibility rules from the Medicaid prenatal scheme and began to expand prenatal\ncoverage by raising financial eligibility ceilings for pregnant women. See OBRA '86 § 9401(a) & (b), 100 Stat.\n1874, 2050-51 (adding subclause (IX) to 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii) and subsection (1) to 42 U.S.C. §\n1396a). OBRA '86 also created a new period of \"presumptive eligibility\" for ambulatory prenatal care in order to\nspeed access to services while Medicaid applications are being processed.\nIn 1988, Congress further expanded Medicaid coverage for prenatal care by making coverage for \"women during\npregnancy\" mandatory, at least for those households with income under 133% of the federal poverty line. See\nMedicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, § 302(a), Pub.L. No. 100-360, 102 Stat. 683, 750-51 (adding\nsubclause (IV) to 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(I)). Congress also eliminated administrative obstacles to the\nprovision of Medicaid coverage for \"women during pregnancy.\" 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(55), (c).\nCongress has also required states to coordinate the operation of Medicaid and the Special Supplemental Food\nProgram for Women, Infants, and Children (\"WIC\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(11)(C). The WIC program helps to\nprovide for the nutritional needs of pregnant women and postpartum women and their newborn children. 42\nU.S.C. § 1786.\nHistory of this Litigation\nPlaintiffs Lydia Lewis et al. commenced this class action in 1979 to challenge a 1973 regulation of the Secretary,\n42 C.F.R. § 435.402(b), and a companion New York State regulation, 18 NYCRR § 349.3, denying Medicaid\nbenefits to all aliens except those lawfully admitted for permanent residence or permanently residing in the United\n148 States under color of law (\"PRUCOL\").[7] Plaintiffs challenged the regulations *148 on four grounds: (1) the\nMedicaid statute did not explicitly authorize such regulations; (2) the regulations violated constitutional principles\nof equal protection and due process; (3) the Secretary's definition of PRUCOL under the regulations was\nimpermissibly narrow; and (4) the regulations did not apply to benefits directed to the unborn children of pregnant\nalien women.\nOn July 14, 1986, this Court issued a memorandum and order which, among other things, determined that the\nSecretary's regulation, 42 C.F.R. § 435.402(b), was not authorized by the Medicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et\nseq. See Lewis v. Gross, 663 F.Supp. 1164 (E.D.N.Y.1986) (Lewis I). Having based this decision on statutory\n\ngrounds, this Court did not reach any of plaintiffs' additional claims challenging the regulations. In particular, this\nCourt did not address the application of alienage restrictions to the provision of prenatal care under Medicaid.\n[8]\nFollowing that decision but before a final judgment was entered, Congress passed OBRA '86.  Section 9406 of\nOBRA '86 provided the missing statutory authority for imposing restrictions on aliens' Medicaid eligibility by\nadding to § 1396a of the Medicaid statute the provision that,\n[n]otwithstanding paragraph 10(B) or any other provision of this subsection, a State plan shall\nprovide medical assistance with respect to an alien who is not lawfully admitted for permanent\nresidence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law only in\naccordance with section 1396b(v) of this title.\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a (1991 Supp.). Section 1396b(v) provided:\n(2) Payments shall be made under this section for care and services that are furnished to an alien\n... only if 00\n97\n(A) such care and services are necessary for the treatment of an emergency medical condition of\nthe alien, and\n(B) such alien otherwise meets the eligibility requirements for medical assistance under the State\nplan ...\n(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term `emergency medical condition' means a medical\ncondition (including emergency labor and delivery) manifesting itself by acute symptoms of\nsufficient severity.\n42 U.S.C. § 1396b(v) (1991 Supp.). The legislative history of OBRA '86 explains that these amendments were\ndesigned specifically to address this Court's decision in Lewis I. See H.Rep. No. 99-727, at 111 (1985), reprinted\n[9]\nin 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3607, 3701 [hereinafter 1986 House Report].\n149 *149 The federal defendant sought reconsideration of this Court's decision in Lewis I in light of this legislative\nchange. While the federal defendant's motion for reconsideration of Lewis I was pending, the Secretary submitted\nto the Court an advance copy of an internal directive which, among other things, provided that pregnant non-\nPRUCOL aliens would no longer be eligible for Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care. On January 20, 1987, plaintiffs\nmoved for a preliminary injunction to prevent this policy from going into effect on the ground that the unborn\nchildren of all alien women in this country, whether PRUCOL or not, were eligible under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(1)\nfor Medicaid in their own names as optional categorically needy \"individuals under the age of 21\" under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396d(a)(1).\nOn March 5, 1987, this Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from denying Medicaid\ncoverage for prenatal care to alien women residing in New York State with a medically verifiable pregnancy if\ntheir unborn children would be eligible for Medicaid had they been born at the time of the application. See Lewis\nv. Grinker, CV-79-1740, 1987 WL 8412 (E.D.N.Y. Mar.6, 1987) (Lewis III). This Court recognized that the federal\nand state defendants shared a \"longstanding interpretation\" of the Medicaid statute that unborn children were to\nbe classified as \"individuals ... under the age of 21\" under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(1) for Medicaid eligibility\npurposes. Relying on this longstanding administrative interpretation, this Court found that plaintiffs had shown a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claims that the unborn children of alien mothers were eligible for\nMedicaid in their own names as optional categorically needy individuals under the age of 21 pursuant to § 1396d\n(a)(1). See Lewis III, 1987 WL 8412, at *9-10. The Secretary did not appeal this decision, \"despite the fact that\n[this] court's determination that fetuses were eligible for Medicaid benefits in their own name conflicted with the\nagency's policy announced in the December 6, 1985 internal memorandum.\" Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1214.\nIn November 1989, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment seeking to convert the preliminary injunction of Lewis\nIII into a permanent injunction. On March 14, 1991, this Court entered a permanent injunction enjoining\ndefendants from denying Medicaid to pregnant non-PRUCOL aliens. See Lewis v. Grinker, 794 F.Supp. 1193\n(E.D.N.Y.1991) (\"Lewis IV\"), aff'd, and reh'g denied,965 F.2d 1206 (2d Cir.1992).\n\nIn Lewis IV, this Court reconsidered its earlier decision in Lewis III and found that fetuses were not eligible for\nMedicaid in their own name as \"individuals ... under the age of 21\" under § 1396d(a)(1). See Lewis IV, 794\nF.Supp. at 1198.\nThis Court determined, however, that pregnant non-PRUCOL aliens were themselves eligible for Medicaid-\nsponsored prenatal care as \"qualified pregnant women\" under § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(III). Because the plain\nlanguage of the Medicaid statute based a pregnant woman's eligibility for Medicaid on her eligibility for AFDC\nbenefits under the AFDC statute, see 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(n), which in turn considered a pregnant woman eligible\nfor AFDC benefits in the last three months of her pregnancy if she would be eligible based on the constructive\nbirth of the fetus, see 42 U.S.C. § 606, this Court concluded that the \"qualified pregnant woman\" provision of the\nstatute required that the fetus be deemed born and that the fetus if born would be a United States citizen. See \nLewis IV, 794 F.Supp. at 1199.\nThis Court found that such an interpretation of the Medicaid statute was supported by congressional purposes\n150 behind Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care. Although *150 prenatal care is provided through the mother,\n\"Congress' intent with respect with Medicaid for prenatal care was to assure that the fetus is born as a healthy\nchild who does not, as a citizen, become a burden on the country's social welfare system.\" Id. at 1200. Because\nthe intended recipients of Medicaid coverage for prenatal care are not the non-PRUCOL mothers but their future\nchildren, \"it is common sense to look to post-birth not pre-birth qualifications.\" Id. at 1200-01. Noting that \"the\ndenial of prenatal care in the circumstances here presented may well violate the equal protection clause,\" id. at\n1203, this Court found that such an interpretation of the statute was further supported by the Ashwander doctrine\nof avoiding constitutional conflicts. See id. at 1202-04. Because § 1396b(v) could be appropriately read as\nproviding Medicaid coverage for prenatal care for the citizen children of non-PRUCOL aliens, this Court granted\nthe permanent injunction.\nThe federal defendant appealed and on January 31, 1992, the Second Circuit affirmed this Court's permanent\ninjunction somewhat on different grounds than those relied on by this Court. Lewis v. Grinker, 965 F.2d 1206 (2d\nCir.)(\"Lewis IV-A\"). The Second Circuit held, as did this Court, that, despite the general alien eligibility restrictions\nin OBRA '86, Congress did not intend to bar otherwise eligible non-PRUCOL pregnant aliens from receiving\nMedicaid-sponsored prenatal care. The Second Circuit concluded, however, that the plain language of OBRA '86\nappeared to require the Secretary to deny Medicaid benefits for prenatal care to non-PRUCOL pregnant aliens.\nHowever, after reviewing the legislative history and statutory background of OBRA '86, the Second Circuit\nconcluded that Congress did not realize that this result would follow from the blanket alienage restriction included\nin OBRA '86, and that, had Congress foreseen such a result, it would not have enacted the statute as written.\nThe Second Circuit found several reasons to believe that Congress did not foresee the results of the language it\nemployed in OBRA '86. First, noting that \"the Medicaid Act is a statute of `unparalleled complexity' ... [and]\namong the `most intricate ever drafted by Congress,'\" the Second Circuit stated, \"we are always mindful of the\npossibility that Congress may have failed to perceive a particular consequence of a blanket change in this\ncomplex statutory scheme.\" Id. at 1216 (internal citations omitted). It further noted that it was \"particularly unwise\nto blindly assume that Congress will always fully anticipate every implication of the plain meaning of a particular\namendment\" when the amendment \"comes in the form of an end-of-session, omnibus budget reconciliation bill.\" \nId. Further, the Second Circuit found that few areas within the \"contorted scheme\" of Medicare \"are more\ncomplex than the coverage of prenatal care\" and noted that \"Congress had frequently tripped over the statute's\ncomplexities\" in its efforts to \"radically expand[]\" access to prenatal care and to shift \"from a fetal centered to a\nmaternal centered\" approach to the provision of prenatal care. Id. at 1216. The Second Circuit then found that\nCongress had failed to recognize in the legislative history to OBRA '86 that, as a result of the 1985 amendments\nto the Medicaid statute, pregnant women became eligible for Medicaid as mandatory categorically needy\nindividuals. The Second Circuit found that in light of the Secretary's longstanding use of the fiction of the\nconstructively born child, Congress might have erroneously assumed that, even after OBRA '86, the states would\nbe free to extend prenatal care directly to the fetus as an \"individual under the age of 21.\" Id. at 1217. Finally, it\nfound that construing OBRA '86 otherwise would raise serious equal protection questions. Because the statute\nprovided that newborn children are automatically eligible for Medicaid in their own names at birth if their mothers\n151 were eligible for Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care, *151see 42 C.F.R. § 435.117 (1991), the Second Circuit\n\nnoted that an interpretation of the statute which found non-PRUCOL pregnant aliens ineligible for Medicaid would\nresult in discrimination against the citizen child of such an alien on the basis of the alien status of the parent. See\nid. at 1217.\nAfter concluding that Congress \"did not foresee that the blanket alienage restriction [in OBRA '86] would have the\neffect of denying prenatal care to future citizens,\" the Second Circuit next considered \"whether this unexpected\nresult is contrary to the clearly expressed intent of Congress.\" Id. at 1219. It noted that \"[i]n the ordinary case, we\nwould be reluctant to conclude that even an unexpected result conflicted with Congressional purpose.\" Id.\nHowever, after considering Congress' purpose in enacting OBRA '86 and \"the long history of Congressional\ntreatment of prenatal care,\" the Second Circuit concluded that the result of the plain language of the statute\nconflicted with Congress' clearly expressed intent. Noting the indisputable conclusion that prenatal care is cost-\neffective, the court first found that denying prenatal care to non-PRUCOL pregnant aliens would undermine the\n\"clearly expressed Congressional purpose [behind OBRA '86] of curbing expenditures.\" Id. The court next found\nthat its conclusion that denying prenatal care to non-PRUCOL pregnant aliens \"conflicts with Congressional\npurpose is further solidified by the fact that Congress has over the years unequivocally expressed its desire to\ncontinue to expand access to prenatal care.\" Id. at 1219. The court thus concluded that this case\npresent[ed] the extremely rare instance where we can discern a clearly expressed Congressional\nintent contrary to the plain language of the statute. Had Congress realized the implications of the\nalien restriction, it would most certainly not have cut off prenatal care to non-PRUCOL women. In\nshort, this is the rare case like Rose where refusing to extend a broad statutory prohibition to a\nsituation Congress did not foresee is necessary to avoid impeding a clearly expressed\nCongressional purpose.\nId. at 1219.\nWhile the court of appeals expressed no opinion on the constitutionality of denying prenatal care to non-PRUCOL\npregnant aliens, it went on to note that \"`legislation directing the onus of a parent's misconduct against his\nchildren does not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice.'\" Id. at 1219-20 (quoting Plyler v. Doe, 457\nU.S. 202, 220, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982)). Accordingly, it declared that \"we are unwilling to over-ride\nCongress's clearly expressed intention to curb expenditures by expanding prenatal care without more persuasive\nindicia of Congressional intent than are present here.\" Id. at 1220. The Secretary moved for a rehearing, which\nwas denied. The Secretary did not seek a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court.\nThe Welfare Reform Act\nFollowing the court of appeals' decision, Congress, in 1996, enacted the Welfare Reform Act. Title IV of that Act,\ncodified as amended at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1601 et seq., obtained approximately $24 billion in cuts in federal spending\nby enacting sweeping new restrictions on aliens' eligibility for federal welfare benefits. Section 401(a) of the\nWelfare Reform Act repealed the alienage restriction on the receipt of Medicaid benefits set forth in OBRA '86\nand replaced it with a more stringent alienage restriction. See Welfare Reform Act § 401(a), 110 Stat. 2105,\n2261. Section 401(a), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1611(a), provides that, in order to be eligible for any \"Federal public\nbenefit,\" including Medicaid, an alien must be a \"qualified alien.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1611(a) (West Supp.1999). Section\n431(b) of the Welfare Reform Act defines a \"qualified alien\" to mean:\nan alien who, at the time the alien applies for, receives, or attempts to receive a Federal public\nbenefit, is 00\n97\n152 *152 (1) an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and\nNationality Act,\n(2) an alien who is granted asylum under section 208 of such Act,\n(3) a refugee who is admitted to the United States under section 207 of such Act,\n\n(4) an alien who is paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5) of such Act for a period\nof at least 1 year,\n(5) an alien whose deportation is being withheld under section 243(h) of such Act, or\n(6) an alien who is granted conditional entry pursuant to section 203(a)(7) of such Act as in effect\nprior to April 1, 1980.\n[10]\nWelfare Reform Act § 431(b), 110 Stat. 2105, 2274 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. § 1641).  Section 401 of\nthe Welfare Reform Act thus not only extended alien eligibility restrictions to a much wider array of federal welfare\nprograms (any \"federal public benefit\"), but it also narrowed the classes of aliens eligible for programs such as\n[11]\nMedicaid to which the PRUCOL standard had previously applied.\nSection 401(b) of the Welfare Reform Act, however, continued to provide for certain limited exceptions to the\ngeneral rule that only \"qualified aliens\" are eligible for federal public benefits. Section 401(b)(1)(A), in particular,\ncodified as amended at 8 U.S.C. § 1611(b)(1)(A), provides that Section 401(a) does not apply to:\n[m]edical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq.] (or any\nsuccessor program to such title) for care and services that are necessary for the treatment of an\nemergency medical condition (as defined in section 1903(v)(3) of such Act [42 U.S.C. § 1396b(v)\n(3)]) of the alien involved and are not related to an organ transplant procedure, if the alien involved\notherwise meets the eligibility requirements for medical assistance under the State plan approved\nunder such title. ...\n8 U.S.C. § 1611(b)(1)(A) (West Supp.1999). The Medicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(v)(3), defines an\n\"emergency medical condition\" as:\na medical condition (including emergency labor and delivery) manifesting itself by acute symptoms\nof sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention\ncould reasonably be expected to result in 00\n97\n(A) placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy,\n(B) serious impairment to bodily functions, or\n(C) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n42 U.S.C. § 1396b(v)(3) (West Supp.1999).\nSection 401(b)(1)(A) is the only exception that explicitly authorizes the provision of Medicaid benefits to\n153 unqualified aliens. However, Section 401(b)(1)(C) also provides *153 a limited exception from the general\nprovisions of the statute for public health assistance other than Medicaid assistance for \"immunizations with\nrespect to immunizable diseases and for testing and treatment of communicable diseases whether or not such\nsymptoms are caused by a communicable disease.\" Welfare Reform Act § 401(b)(1)(C), 110 Stat. 2105, 2261\n[12]\n(codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1611(b)(1)(C)).  In addition, the Welfare Reform Act exempts the federally funded\nSchool Lunch and Breakfast programs from Section 401(a)'s alienage restriction and offers the states the option\nof not applying the restriction to various federally funded nutrition programs, including the WIC program. See 8\nU.S.C. § 1615 (West Supp.1999).\nFACTS\nThe basic facts relevant to this application are not disputed. Indeed, many of the relevant findings made in 1991\nin Lewis IV and reiterated by the Second Circuit in 1992 in Lewis IV-A continue to be the case today, and the\nfederal defendant does not dispute the continued validity of these findings.\n\nWhile the federal defendant notes the obvious possibility that the fetus of an unqualified pregnant alien may\nnever become a citizen of this country because it may not be born at all or because it may depart from the United\nStates en ventre sa mere, it is not disputed that a substantial number of unqualified pregnant aliens will give birth\nto their children in the United States. Under federal law and the Constitution, these children will be citizens of this\ncountry at the moment of their birth. See, e.g., INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 105 S.Ct. 2098, 85 L.Ed.2d 452\n(1985).\nIt is also undisputed that prenatal care is critical to the health of a substantial number of these citizen children.\nChildren who do not receive prenatal care unquestionably are far more likely to be born with severe and\ndebilitating birth defects and other physical and mental deformities. The substantial social costs of failing to\nprovide prenatal care also remain undisputed. As this Court found in Lewis IV, \"[a]s a result of handicaps related\nto birth defects, many of these children, now born citizens, will be unable to lead productive lives in this country\nbecause of their conditions and will be supported by a variety of other social welfare programs.\" Lewis IV, 794\nF.Supp. at 1196.\nIt is also undisputed that, from a cost-effectiveness perspective, prenatal care is far superior to the subsequent\ntreatment of preventable birth defects. Indeed, Congress has itself elsewhere recognized this cost-effectiveness\n[13]\nby consistently expanding Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women and access to prenatal care.\nAs further evidence of the substantial costs of denying prenatal care to unqualified pregnant aliens, plaintiffs cite\n154 studies published since 1992 that confirm the earlier *154 findings of this Court and the Second Circuit and\nsubmit the affidavit of Dr. Howard L. Minkoff, Distinguished Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Director\nof Maternal-Fetal Medicine at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn, New York. Dr.\nMinkoff concludes that \"any action which would limit access to prenatal care 00 especially amongst at risk women\n97\n00 would seriously undermine the slow, but steady gains made in the fight against infant mortality and low birth\n97\nweight,\" and, accordingly, were this Court to vacate the permanent injunction, \"more than a decade's investment\nin expanding access to prenatal care [among high risk alien women] would be lost.\" (Dr. Minkoff Aff. ¶¶ 17, 43.)\nBased on recent studies, Dr. Minkoff reports that the rates of infant mortality and low birth weight have improved\nslowly since the early 1980's due to increased attention from the medical and political community. While infant\nmortality rates in urban areas such as New York City remain higher than the national average, they have slowly\n[14]\ndecreased due to increased access to prenatal care.  The infant mortality rate for New York City's non-white\n[15]\npopulation, however, has not decreased as dramatically.  Dr. Minkoff reports that recent studies have\nconfirmed the crucial role of prenatal care in reducing low birth weight and infant mortality rates. A recent March\nof Dimes study found that infants born to mothers who received late or no prenatal care were about twice as\nlikely to be low birth weight (12% vs. 6.7%) and very low birth weight (2.5% vs. 1.2%) as infants born to mothers\nwho received early prenatal care. (Minkoff Aff. ¶ 31). New York State's Public Health Council recently concluded\nthat \"New York's goal should be to have comprehensive prenatal care received by every pregnant woman in New\nYork State.\" (Minkoff Aff. ¶ 32.)\nOther recent studies have shown that prenatal care continues to be cost-effective. A study delivered at the\nAmerican Public Health Association determined that the average cost of providing prenatal care and initial\nhospitalization for delivery is now approximately $1,200 per child, while the initial hospitalization cost is $10,000\nfor a low-birth-weight baby and $65,000 for a very low-birth-weight baby. (Minkoff Aff. ¶ 38.) The New York State\nDepartment of Health has estimated that the annual costs of providing prenatal care for approximately 13,472\nbirths to undocumented pregnant women in New York State is approximately $15,555,600. The total initial\nhospitalization (delivery and post-natal care) costs for normal weight, low-birth-weight, and very low-birth-weight\nbabies of these women are $44,487,259. In the absence of prenatal care for these same babies, the total initial\nhospitalization costs for all birth weights would be $59,183,574. As a result, the New York State Department of\nHealth concludes that the expenditure of $15.5 million on prenatal care for undocumented women saves an\nestimated $14.7 million just in the costs of providing initial hospitalization for these babies, and not including the\nextraordinary additional costs of providing lifelong medical care or the lifelong expense of special education for\nbabies born with severe birth defects. (Minkoff Aff. ¶¶ 39 & 40.) A study by the Southern Governors' Regional\n\nTask Force on Infant Mortality similarly found that between $2 and $10 can be saved in medical care costs for\nevery dollar spent in providing early prenatal care. (Minkoff Aff. ¶ 42.)\n155 DISCUSSION\n*155\nThe federal defendant moves for an order dissolving the permanent injunction issued in Lewis IV and dismissing\nthe complaint. Although Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 does not address the subject of modifying or vacating\ninjunctions, it is well established that a court may order the modification or vacation of an injunction due to\nchanges in the relevant decisional or statutory law. See, e.g., System Fed'n No. 91 v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 81\nS.Ct. 368, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961); 11A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice &\nProcedure § 2961 (1995). The Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he parties have no power to require of the court\ncontinuing enforcement of rights the statute no longer gives.\" System Fed'n No. 91, 364 U.S. at 652, 81 S.Ct. 368\n.\nThe federal defendant contends that the injunction must be vacated because it is inconsistent with both the plain\nlanguage and the clear legislative history of the alien eligibility restriction contained in Section 401(a) of the\nWelfare Reform Act. In Lewis IV-A, the Second Circuit held that the statutory language in OBRA '86 then at issue\nshould not be read to deny Medicaid benefits for non-emergency prenatal care to non-PRUCOL pregnant aliens\n\"without more persuasive indicia of Congressional intent.\" Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1220. The federal defendant\nsuggests that Congress has now provided that missing evidence of its specific intent, both in the language of\nSection 401 of the Welfare Reform Act and in the statute's legislative history.\nIn response, plaintiffs contend that neither the language nor the legislative history of the Welfare Reform Act\nestablishes that Congress intended to overrule the Second Circuit's holding in Lewis IV-A or to deprive all\nunqualified pregnant aliens of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care. Alternatively, plaintiffs argue that, if the\nfederal defendant's interpretation of the Welfare Reform Act were accepted as correct, the Secretary's application\nof Section 401(a) of the Act to deny Medicaid for routine prenatal care to unqualified pregnant aliens would\nviolate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\nBefore confronting the constitutional questions presented by this argument, this Court must \"first ascertain\nwhether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which [those] question[s] may be avoided.\" Ashwander\nv. Tennessee Valley Auth., 297 U.S. 288, 347-48, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).\nInterpretation of Section 401(a) of the Act\nRelying on the same rules of statutory construction employed by the Second Circuit in Lewis IV-A, the federal\ndefendant first argues that the language of Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act must be construed to\npreclude unqualified pregnant aliens from receiving Medicaid for non-emergency, or routine, prenatal care.\nIn Lewis IV-A, the court of appeals noted that \"in the usual case,\" a reviewing court's analysis must end where\nthe plain language of the statute is clear and unambiguous. See Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1215, 1221. The Second\nCircuit recognized, however, that, where \"`rare and exceptional' circumstances exist, the plain language of a\nstatute may not be controlling.\" Id. at 1221-22 (quoting Rubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, 430, 101 S.Ct. 698,\n66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981)). Relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Rose v. Rose, 481 U.S. 619, 107 S.Ct. 2029,\n95 L.Ed.2d 599 (1987), the court of appeals found that such \"rare and exceptional\" circumstances exist \"where\nrefusing to extend a broad statutory prohibition to a situation Congress did not foresee is necessary in order to\navoid impeding a clearly expressed Congressional purpose.\" Id. at 1219. The Second Circuit thus found that,\n\"where a broad statutory purpose leads to unforeseen results contrary to the purpose of the prohibition, a court\n156 may legitimately recognize an exception to a broad statutory *156 prohibition in order to further Congress's\npurpose.\" Id. at 1215.\nAfter considering the legislative history of OBRA '86 and the \"long history of Congressional treatment of prenatal\ncare\" generally, id. at 1219, the Second Circuit ultimately concluded that Congress did not realize that the plain\nlanguage of the blanket alienage restriction in OBRA '86 would result in the denial of Medicaid benefits for routine\n\nprenatal care to non-PRUCOL women and that, had Congress foreseen this result, it would not have enacted the\nstatute as written. The Second Circuit therefore found that recognizing an exception to the alienage restriction in\nOBRA '86 for the provision of Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care to non-PRUCOL pregnant aliens was necessary\nto further Congress' purpose.\nHere, plaintiffs do not dispute that the plain language of Section 401 of the Welfare Reform Act, like the plain\nlanguage of OBRA '86, precludes unqualified pregnant aliens from receiving Medicaid benefits for routine\nprenatal care. Section 401(a), as codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1611(a), provides that \"[n]otwithstanding any other\nprovision of law and except as provided in subsection (b), an alien who is not a qualified alien\" is precluded from\nreceiving any non-emergency Medicaid benefits. 8 U.S.C. § 1611. Pregnant aliens are not \"qualified aliens\"\nwithin the meaning of the Welfare Reform Act. 8 U.S.C. § 1641. Nor has the phrase \"emergency medical\ncondition\" ever been defined, nor have plaintiffs argued that it should be interpreted, to include routine prenatal\n[16]\ncare. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396b(v)(3); (Pls.' Opp. at 15).\nAccordingly, following the same rules of statutory construction employed by the Second Circuit in Lewis IV-A, the\nonly question that remains is whether Congress, when it passed the Welfare Reform Act, failed to realize that the\nblanket alien eligibility restriction included in Section 401(a) of the Act would have the effect of precluding\nunqualified pregnant aliens from receiving Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care. The federal defendant\nargues that it is unlikely that such a \"rare and extraordinary\" circumstance 00 i.e., that Congress was confused by\n97\nthe words it drafted 00 occurred not once, but twice within a ten-year period with respect to two different statutes\n97\nconcerning the same subject. In all events, the federal defendant argues that the legislative history of the Welfare\nReform Act, unlike that of OBRA '86, reflects an intent on the part of Congress to bring about the limitations on\nprenatal care that plaintiffs seek to avoid. Because Congress fully realized the effects of Welfare Reform Act's\nplain language, the federal defendant argues that this case does not present a \"rare and extraordinary\" situation\nin which this Court may legitimately recognize an exception to the statutory prohibition.\nIn support of its argument, the federal defendant cites two fragments from the Welfare Reform Act's legislative\nhistory. The first, and most explicit, is a statement included in the Conference Committee Report for the Act:\nHouse bill\nNoncitizens who are \"not qualified aliens\" (generally, illegal immigrants and nonimmigrants such\n157 as students) are ineligible for all Federal public benefits, *157 with limited exceptions for\nemergency medical services....\nConference Agreement\n....\nThe allowance for emergency medical services under Medicaid is very narrow. The conferees\nintend that it only apply to medical care that is strictly of an emergency nature, such as medical\ntreatment administered in an emergency room, critical care unit, or intensive care unit. The\nconferees do not intend that emergency medical services include prenatal or delivery care\nassistance that is not strictly of an emergency nature as specified herein.\nH.Conf.Rep. No. 104-725, at 874-75 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2649, 2767-68 (emphasis added).\nThe version of the bill reported out by the Conference Committee was adopted by the House and Senate in its\nentirety on July 31, and August 1, 1996, respectively. H.R.3734 (Enrolled Bill (sent to President)); Welfare Reform\nAct § 401(b)(1), 110 Stat. at 2261. On August 22, 1996, the President signed the conference version of the bill\ninto law as the Welfare Reform Act.\nIn addition to this statement in the Conference Committee Report, the federal defendant also points to 104th\nCongress' consideration and ultimate rejection of proposed statutory language that would have guaranteed\nMedicaid coverage for routine prenatal care for certain unqualified aliens. During the same session that\nconsidered and adopted the Welfare Reform Act, the 104th Congress considered and enacted the Illegal\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 100 Stat. 3009, 3009-546\n\n[17]\n(\"IIRIRA\"). On April 10, 1996, prior to Congress' adoption of the Welfare Reform Act,  the Senate Committee\non the Judiciary issued its report on Senate Bill S.1664, the Senate version of the bill that ultimately was enacted\nas the IIRIRA. S.1664, like H.R.3734 the bill which later became the Welfare Reform Act, contained its own\n[18]\nversion of an alienage restriction on the receipt of federal welfare benefits.  S.1664, however, unlike H.R.3734\nas considered by either house or as adopted by both houses, contained an express exception authorizing certain\notherwise ineligible aliens to receive Medicaid for non-emergency prenatal and postpartum services. Thus,\nSection 201(a)(4) of S.1664 provided that an ineligible alien could receive pregnancy services, including prenatal\n[19]\ncare, if she had resided in the United States continuously for three years or more.\n158 *158 Congress effectively rejected this version of S.1664 when it enacted the Welfare Reform Act and the IIRIRA.\nAlthough S.1664 had been reported out of committee in April 1996, the Senate did not include language identical\nor similar to the prenatal care exception in Section 201(a)(4) of S.1664 in the final version of the Welfare Reform\nAct passed by the Senate on July 23, 1996. Moreover, Congress did not include language similar to the\nexception in Section 201(a)(4) of S.1664 when both houses agreed to the version of the Welfare Reform Act\nreported out of the Conference Committee on July 31 and August 1, 1996, respectively.\nCongress also failed to include language similar to the prenatal care exception in Section 201(a)(4) of S.1664\n[20]\nwhen it amended the provisions of the Welfare Reform Act by enacting the IIRIRA.  In Section 501 of IIRIRA,\nCongress amended Section 431 of the Welfare Reform Act to allow Medicaid coverage for certain unqualified\naliens who have been \"battered\" or subjected to extreme cruelty by a family member. See IIRIRA § 501, 110 Stat.\nat 3009-670, 3009-671 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. § 1641(c)). Although the offering of this amendment\nmight have provided another occasion for creating an exception for prenatal care benefits for unqualified aliens,\nCongress again failed to include in Section 501 of IIRIRA language identical or similar to the prenatal care\nexception contained in Section 201(a)(4) of S.1664.\nBoth sides trade oft-cited quotations concerning the significance of Congress' failure to include language similar\nto the prenatal care exception in Section 201(a)(4) of S.1664 in either the Welfare Reform Act or the IIRIRA and\nwhether that failure constitutes additional evidence that Congress did not intend for unqualified pregnant aliens to\nreceive Medicaid benefits for non-emergency prenatal care. The federal defendant cites Justice Stewart's\nobservation that \"`[f]ew principles of statutory construction are more compelling than the proposition that\nCongress does not intend sub silentio to enact statutory language that it has earlier discarded in favor of other\nlanguage.'\" INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 442-43, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (quoting \nNachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 446 U.S. 359, 393-93, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 64 L.Ed.2d 354\n[21]\n(1980) (Stewart, J., dissenting)). Plaintiffs parry  with the oft-cited observation that \"[a]s a general matter, we\nare `reluctant to draw inferences from Congress's failure to act.'\" Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 632, 113\nS.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U.S. 293, 306, 108 S.Ct.\n1145, 99 L.Ed.2d 316 (1988)).\nAs a practical matter, the inclusion of an exception for Medicaid coverage for routine prenatal care in S.1664\nsuggests that at least some members of the Senate realized that the broad alienage restriction in Section 201 of\nthat Senate bill precursor of IIRIRA would result in the denial of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care to\nmany pregnant aliens. That is not to say that Congress' failure in IIRIRA to adopt the prenatal care exception in\n159 Section 201(a)(4) of S.1664 or language similar to *159 that exception constituted a recognition on the part of the\n104th Congress as a whole that the broad alienage restriction in Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act would\nproduce such a result. S.1664 was an earlier Senate version of the bill that ultimately became the IIRIRA, rather\nthan an earlier Senate version of the bill that ultimately became the Welfare Reform Act. Thus, this case does not\npresent a situation where Congress considered and rejected an earlier Senate or House version of the very same\nstatutory provision that ultimately was enacted by Congress. Cf. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 441-43, 107 S.Ct.\n1207 (inferring congressional intent regarding standard for relief under Section 208(a) of the Refugee Act of\n1980, 94 Stat. 1102, from Congress' rejection of a stricter standard in Senate version of the Act, S.643, in favor of\na more relaxed standard of House version of the statute, H.R.2816); United States v. Ten Cartons, 72 F.3d 285,\n287 (2d Cir.1995) (giving persuasive weight to Congress' rejection of an earlier version of the Dietary Supplement\nand Health Education Act (\"DSHEA\") when construing portion of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\namended by the DSHEA). Nor does there exist any legislative history of S.1664 that provides evidence of the\n\nSenate's motives in rejecting that bill or declining to adopt the prenatal care exception in Section 201(a)(4) of the\nbill. Cf. J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 562-63, 101 S.Ct. 1923, 68 L.Ed.2d 442\n(1981) (finding that House and Senate reports indicated \"strong opposition in both houses\" to proposed\nprovision); Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. at 442 n. 27, 107 S.Ct. 1207 (testimony before congressional committees\n[22]\nindicated that Congress realized the differences between the two standards at issue).  Accordingly, I will not\ndraw any inferences from the 104th Congress' failure to include Section 201(a)(4) of S.1664 or language similar\nto its prenatal care exception in the Welfare Reform Act under consideration.\nThe statement in the Conference Committee Report for H.R.3734 provides, however, strong evidence that the\n104th Congress realized and intended the effects of the plain language of Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform\nAct with respect to the provision of Medicaid for routine prenatal care to unqualified pregnant aliens. The\nstatement is included in a section of the Conference Committee Report that discusses Congress' understanding\nof the overall effect of Section 401, including both the broad restriction on aliens' eligibility for federal public\nwelfare benefits set forth in Section 401(a) and the exceptions to that broad restriction set forth in Section 401(b).\nThe statement in the Conference Committee Report thus makes sense only if the 104th Congress believed that\nMedicaid coverage for routine prenatal care would be subject to the newly enacted general alienage exclusion in\nSection 401(a) in the first place.\nThus, if this Court is to adhere to the rules of statutory construction employed by the Second Circuit in Lewis IV-\nA, as it must, this Court's inquiry must end. The Conference Committee Report provides the evidence for which\nthe court of appeals was searching in Lewis 00 that Congress realized and intended the effects of the plain\n97\nlanguage of Section 401(a)'s alien eligibility restriction on the provision of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal\ncare to unqualified pregnant aliens.\n160 While plaintiffs offer a host of arguments[23] in response to the federal defendant's *160 interpretation of Section\n401(a), none of these arguments provide a meaningful response to the federal defendant's contention that this\nstatement in the Conference Committee Report supplies the clear evidence of congressional intent that the\nSecond Circuit found missing in Lewis IV-A.\nPlaintiffs first argue that the Conference Committee's statement regarding the scope of the emergency medical\nservices exception in Section 401(b)(1)(A) is irrelevant to the issue before the Court because in plaintiffs' view the\nSecond Circuit in Lewis IV-A found it appropriate to recognize an exception to the broad alienage restriction in\nOBRA '86 for such prenatal care in order to \"avoid impeding\" Congress' clearly expressed intent to expand\naccess to prenatal care and to curb expenditures. See Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1219. In this connection, plaintiffs\nnote that Congress' commitment to expanded access to prenatal care, its concern for the health of children\nresiding in this country, and its desire to curb expenditures remain as strong today as they did at the time of the\nSecond Circuit's decision in Lewis IV-A. In further support of their argument, plaintiffs cite the Welfare Reform\nAct's failure to amend or restrict the provisions of the Medicaid statute which expanded access to prenatal care\nand the nature of the exceptions to Section 401(a)'s broad alienage restriction included in Section 401(b) of the\nAct. They note that the Welfare Reform Act did not amend or restrict any of the provisions of the Medicaid statute\nthat the Second Circuit in Lewis IV-A found to demonstrate Congress' intent to expand access to prenatal care.\nThey point out that the Welfare Reform Act left intact the methodology of the constructively born child as a means\n[24]\nof determining a pregnant woman's eligibility for Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(n)\n(1). Nor does the Act limit other forms of Medicaid coverage aimed at infant health, such as automatic newborn\ncoverage, see 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(e)(4); 42 C.F.R. § 435.117; presumptive eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care, \nsee 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(47) and 1396r-1; and mandatory coordination of Medicaid and WIC benefits, see id. §§\n1396a(55) and (c)(2). The Act also continues to allow states to provide benefits under the WIC program to\nunqualified alien women. See 8 U.S.C. § 1615.\nPlaintiffs also note that the exceptions in Section 401(b) further suggest that Congress did not intend to\ncompromise the health of United States citizens or children and pregnant women irrespective of their immigration\nstatus. Section 401(b)(1)(C) provides an exception for the \"testing and treatment of symptoms of communicable\n161 diseases whether or not such symptoms are caused by a communicable disease.\" 8 *161 U.S.C. § 1611(b)(1)\n(C). Plaintiffs further note that Congress permitted the states the option to exempt certain federal nutrition\nprograms for pregnant women and children, such as the school lunch and breakfast and WIC programs, from the\n\nAct's alien eligibility restrictions. See 8 U.S.C. § 1615. Plaintiffs now argue that these exceptions show Congress'\ncontinuing concern for the health of children residing in the United States irrespective of their immigration status\n[25]\nand a continued congressional policy to ensure that United States citizen children will be born healthy.\nApplying similar reasoning, plaintiffs also argue that the federal defendant's interpretation of the Welfare Reform\nAct conflicts with Congress' continuing intent to curb expenditures. Plaintiffs argue that, by preserving access to\nthe WIC program even as it sought to reduce expenditures on other federal welfare programs and benefits for\nimmigrants, Congress realized that the deprivation of nutrition to pregnant women would undermine the goals of\nthe Act.\nThere is, of course, no arguing with the fact that Congress, through the adoption of many pieces of legislation in\nthe last twenty years relating to prenatal care, has consistently expanded access to prenatal care and has\nrepeatedly expressed a desire to curb expenditures. See Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1219. Indeed, Congress\ncontinued to expand access to prenatal care in the Welfare Reform Act itself by expressly providing that Section\n115 of the Act, which denies certain federal welfare benefits to individuals convicted of certain drug-related\noffenses, should not be construed to deny federal benefits for prenatal care. See Welfare Reform Act § 115(f),\n110 Stat. 2105, 2181 (codified at 21 U.S.C. § 862a).\nHowever, Congress' broad purposes cannot be used to trump the plain language of a statute bolstered by a\nrelatively clear expression of intent from the legislative history of the statute under interpretation:\nApplication of \"broad purposes\" of legislation at the expense of specific provisions ignores the\ncomplexity of the problems Congress is called upon to address and the dynamics of legislative\naction. Congress may be unanimous in its intent to stamp out some vague social or economic evil;\nhowever, because its Members may differ sharply on the means for effectuating that intent, the\nfinal language of the legislation may reflect hard-fought compromises. Invocation of the \"plain\npurpose\" of the legislation at the expense of the terms of the statute itself takes no account of the\nprocesses of compromise and, in the end, prevents the effectuation of congressional intent.\nBoard of Governors of the Fed.

Citing the cannon of statutory interpretation that courts may \"presume that Congress is\nknowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the legislation it enacts,\" Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U.S.\n174, 184-85, 108 S.Ct. 1704, 100 L.Ed.2d 158 (1988), plaintiffs argue that Congress needed to explicitly state its\nintention to overturn Lewis IV-A in order to accomplish that result.\nHowever, plaintiffs' extraordinary suggestion that legislative history must refer to opinions intended to be\noverturned by citation need not be considered here because the relevant case law, at the time Congress enacted\nthe Welfare Reform Act, was internally inconsistent. Cf. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696, 99\nS.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). In Douglas v. Babcock, 990 F.2d 875 (6th Cir.1993), the Sixth Circuit\n[26]\nexpressly rejected the Second Circuit's method of statutory interpretation in Lewis IV-A:\n\nWe have fundamental concerns with the reasoning in Lewis v. Grinker, and its applicability to the\ncase before us. The Second Circuit in Lewis, instead of focusing on applying the applicable law as\nwritten by Congress, instead sought to determine what it deemed Congress's broader \"intent.\" We\ndo not believe our proper judicial role is to divine Congress's unlegislated intent, or to make the\nstatutes comport with what we believe Congress's preferred policy to be, or what it ought to be.\nRather, this court must apply the law as written, even when a result is produced that we may\npersonally question. The perceived legislative history of the relevant statutes should not be\nallowed to trump duly enacted laws even if the \"unenacted\" legislative policy, intent, or history is\n163 clear. Here, the legislative history is far from clear. We are not confident *163 that it would even be\npossible to discover what Congress's \"intent\" was respecting the very detailed and complex\nquestion presented by this appeal. We decline to follow the approach of Lewis.\nDouglas, 990 F.2d at 881. Moreover, the permanent injunction affirmed by the Second Circuit in Lewis IV-A\napplies only inside New York State. In every other state, even after Lewis IV-A was decided, federal Medicaid\nfunds were not being paid (and have not been paid) to provide routine prenatal care to non-PRUCOL or\nunqualified aliens. (Richardson Aff. ¶ 6). Thus, if Congress was aware that Medicaid funds were being paid to\nprovide routine prenatal care only in New York State, Congress could not have considered the Second Circuit's\ndecision in Lewis IV-A to be the prevailing understanding of OBRA '86.\nAlternatively, plaintiffs argue that the Welfare Reform Act is at least as complex as OBRA '86, if not more so, and\nthat it therefore is even less likely that the 104th Congress specifically considered the Act's effects on the\nprovision of Medicaid for routine prenatal care to unqualified prenatal care. However, the complexity of OBRA '86\nonly became relevant to the court of appeals because of the absence of a statement such as that included in the\nConference Committee Report which cuts through the complexity and alerts the 104th Congress to the fact that\nSection 401 would result in the denial of prenatal care. Cf. Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1216. Because the legislative\nhistory of the Welfare Reform Act, unlike that of OBRA '86, explicitly confronted Congress with the consequences\nof the Act, this Court may not indulge the presumption that Congress was confused by the Act's complexity. Cf.\nid.\nIn choosing between two possible interpretations of a statute, courts must choose the one, if it exists, that avoids\na constitutional conflict. As Justice Brandeis explained:\nThe Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record,\nif there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of.... \"When the\nvalidity of an act of the Congress is drawn into question, and even if a serious doubt of\nconstitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a\nconstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\"\nAshwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 347-48, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J.,\nconcurring) (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932)). This rule has, of\ncourse, been followed in this circuit. \"If a court can decide a case on non-constitutional grounds, it should not\nstray into the field of constitutional analysis.\" FEC v. Central Long Island Tax Reform Immediately Comm., 616\nF.2d 45, 52 (1980); see also Occidental Chem. Corp. v. FERC, 869 F.2d 127 (2d Cir.1989); Carlin\nCommunications, Inc. v. FCC, 749 F.2d 113 (2d Cir.1984).\nIn Lewis IV, this Court relied upon the Ashwander doctrine to interpret OBRA '86 to permit Medicaid coverage for\nprenatal care for non-PRUCOL aliens, rather than confront \"several complex constitutional issues of first\nimpression.\" Lewis IV, 794 F.Supp. 1202-03. This Court, however, may only avoid such constitutional analysis if\nanother construction of the statute is \"fairly possible.\" Because the plain language of the Welfare Reform Act has\nthe effect of precluding Medicaid coverage for routine prenatal care for unqualified immigrants and because the\nlegislative history of the Act establishes that Congress intended that result, it is not \"fairly possible\" to construe\nthe Act to permit Medicaid coverage for such prenatal care. As the Supreme Court recently noted:\nStatutes should be construed to avoid constitutional questions, but this interpretive canon is not a\n164 license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by *164 the legislature.... Any other\n\nconclusion, while purporting to be an exercise in judicial restraint, would trench upon the\nlegislative powers vested in Congress by Art. I, § 1, of the Constitution.\nSalinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 118 S.Ct. 469, 475, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997) (quoting United States v.\nAlbertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680, 105 S.Ct. 2897, 86 L.Ed.2d 536 (1985) (citation omitted)). Here, unlike in Lewis IV,\nthis Court cannot say that an alternative construction of the statute is \"fairly possible\" because Congress has\nsupplied the evidence of its intent that was missing in Lewis IV. Any other conclusion would represent \"judicial\nlegislation\" in derogation of the judicial function. Cf. Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1223.\nConstitutionality of Secretary's Denial of Prenatal Care\nBecause an alternative construction of Section 401 of the Welfare Reform Act is not \"fairly possible,\" it is\nnecessary to consider the merits of plaintiffs' claim that the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) to deny of\nMedicaid coverage for non-emergency prenatal care to unqualified pregnant aliens violates the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment.\nStanding\nBefore proceeding to the merits of plaintiffs' constitutional claims, plaintiffs' standing to raise those claims must be\nconsidered. Plaintiffs raise claims on behalf of themselves and on behalf of their citizen children.\nPlaintiffs clearly have standing under Article III to raise a claim on their own behalf and on behalf of all similarly\nsituated members of the plaintiff class that the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) to deny them Medicaid\nbenefits for routine prenatal care would violate their own rights to the equal protection of the laws under the Fifth\nAmendment's Due Process Clause. The \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\" consists of three\nelements. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). First, a\nplaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in fact\" 00 an invasion of a legally protected interest, which is concrete and\n97\nparticularized, and actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. See id. at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130; see also,\ne.g., Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 138 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997) (\"We have consistently stressed\nthat a plaintiff's complaint must establish that he has a `personal stake' in the alleged dispute, and that the\nalleged injury suffered is particularized to him.\"); Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d\n556 (1984). Second, the injury must be \"fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct.\" Allen, 468\nU.S. at 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315. Third, \"it must be `likely,' as opposed to merely `speculative,' that the injury will be\n`redressed by a favorable decision.'\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky.\nWelfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41-42, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976)).\nAs a result of the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act to them, the members of\nthe plaintiff class will suffer a concrete injury, the denial of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care, which is\ncaused by the conduct of the Secretary and which can be redressed by the continuation of this Court's injunction.\nIt is not disputed that, as a result of the Secretary's denial of prenatal care to unqualified pregnant aliens,\nsignificant numbers of the children of the members of the plaintiff class will be born with severe and potentially\nlifelong birth defects. The members of the plaintiff class thus have a direct and personal interest in this litigation;\nthey will bear the primary economic, social, and emotional burdens of caring for these children. As stated in Lewis\nIV, \"the burden of caring for a deformed child may demand such time and resources from its parents as to\n165 prevent them from otherwise leading economically productive lives.\" Lewis IV, 794 *165 F.Supp. at 1202.\nMoreover, \"a parent has his or her own direct, legally cognizable interest in preserving the highest level of health\nfor his or her child.\" Public Citizen v. FTC, 869 F.2d 1541, 1550 (D.C.Cir. 1989); cf. Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584,\n600-04, 99 S.Ct. 2493, 61 L.Ed.2d 101 (1979) (discussing \"parent's interest in and obligation for the welfare and\nhealth of the child\"); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 232, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (\"The history\nand culture of Western civilization show a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of\ntheir children.\"). Such a showing of injury more than suffices to meet concerns about plaintiffs' constitutional\nstanding.\n\nPlaintiffs, however, also ask this Court to consider the injuries that will be sustained by their citizen children as a\nresult of the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) to deny them Medicaid coverage for prenatal care, and\nindeed this claim, which involves disparate treatment of United States citizens, is, for reasons discussed\nhereinafter, the basis on which I conclude that the statute is unconstitutional.\nThe federal defendant responds initially to this claim that plaintiffs do not have standing under Article III to assert\na constitutional claim on behalf of their unborn citizen children because, under the Supreme Court's decision in \nRoe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 157-59, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), a fetus is not a \"person\" entitled to the\nequal protection of the laws under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments. Since a fetus is not a person, or in being,\nit does not itself have standing and a fortiori neither does the mother.\nThe question of whether a fetus is a \"person\" entitled to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is, however,\nnot dispositive in this case and the federal defendant's citation to Roe is inapposite. Whether or not plaintiffs may\nassert an equal protection claim on behalf of their unborn children, they clearly may assert an equal protection\n[28]\nclaim on behalf of their already-born citizen children,  and it is essentially on that claim that they are entitled to\nprevail in this lawsuit.\nThese citizen children themselves have standing to claim that the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) to\ndeny their alien mothers Medicaid coverage for routine prenatal care denies them equal protection because they\nhave suffered an injury-in-fact which is directly traceable to the Secretary's conduct and to claim that this injury is\nlikely to be redressed by this Court's continuation of the permanent injunction. The Medicaid statute provides that\nnewborn children are automatically eligible for Medicaid in their own name on the date of their birth if their\n166 mothers were eligible for Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care.[29] 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(e)(4) *166 (West Supp.1999);\n42 C.F.R. § 435.117 (1999). Thus, if the Secretary considers a pregnant alien ineligible for Medicaid-sponsored\nprenatal care under the alienage restriction in Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act, then the child of such an\nunqualified alien who is born in the United States will not be automatically eligible for Medicaid on the date of its\nbirth while the child of a citizen mother considered eligible for Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care will be eligible\n[30]\nfor Medicaid at birth. Both children, however, are United States citizens.  The citizen child of an unqualified\nalien woman thus may assert a claim that the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) to deny his or her alien\nmother Medicaid coverage for routine prenatal care results in discrimination against the citizen child on the basis\nof the alienage status of its mother, discrimination that, as noted below, clearly violates the child's right to equal\n[31]\nprotection under the Fifth Amendment.\nThis disparate treatment on the basis of the alienage of the mother is not eliminated by the fact that the Medicaid\nstatute permits the newborn citizen child of an alien mother to apply for Medicaid in his or her own name, or that,\nif and when the newborn child is determined to be eligible, the Medicaid statute provides that any award is\nretroactive to the date of the child's application, because significant disparities in application procedure and\ncoverage still remain. First, under 42 C.F.R. § 435.914, retroactivity only extends back three months prior to the\napplication for Medicaid. See 42 C.F.R. § 435.914 (1999) (\"The agency must make eligibility for Medicaid\neffective no later than the third month before the month of the application.\"). Thus, if the newborn citizen child of\nan unqualified alien mother applies for Medicaid more than three months after its birth, the child will not be\neligible retroactively for Medicaid coverage for post-birth medical expenses. By contrast, the child of an otherwise\neligible citizen mother will be automatically eligible for Medicaid coverage for all expenses for one year without\nneed to apply for such benefits. Of course, the impact of a lack of immediate Medicaid coverage for post-birth\nexpenses is very real, and not at all academic, since another result of the Secretary's application of Section 401\n(a) to deny Medicaid coverage for routine prenatal care to unqualified pregnant aliens will be the imposition of\nbirth defects and other severe and potentially lifelong physical and mental disabilities on a significant number of\n[32]\nthe citizen children born to the members of the plaintiff class.\nNor is the standing of the mothers and their children any less because of the contingencies cited by the federal\ndefendant which might, on the one hand, have spared the child all of the injuries to be feared from lack of\nprenatal or post-natal care to the child's mother or which might, on the other hand, have destroyed the legal claim\n167 of the child to relief from this Court. It is, of course, possible that the child of an *167 unqualified alien woman\n\n[33]\nmay be stillborn  or come through birth unscathed and not in need of Medicaid coverage. It was also possible,\nalthough not likely, that the child might not have been born in this country because the unqualified alien woman\nmight have left the United States while pregnant and failed to return before the birth of her child. So too the\nfederal defendant might have been more successful than it has in the past in its ongoing efforts to remove all\nunqualified aliens, whether pregnant or not, from the country. These contingencies, which make it possible that\nsome portion of those potentially threatened with injury by the statute will escape injury, do not lessen the\nstanding of that substantial number of the children of these aliens who will be born in this country and will, as a\nresult, be citizens entitled to the protections of the United States Constitution at the moment of their birth and will\nbe denied those protections as a result of the operation of this statute.\nSome children will be born without birth defects despite the lack of prenatal care and grow up as healthy United\nStates citizens. However, it is also indisputable that a significant number of citizen children will suffer from the\nlack of prenatal care provided to the alien mothers, and some appreciable number of young citizen children will\nundergo lifelong physical or mental disabilities as a direct result of the Secretary's application of the statute. As\ndiscussed in greater detail hereinafter, the imposition of such disabilities upon innocent citizen children solely on\nthe basis of the alienage of their mothers \"does not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice.\" Plyler, 457\n[34]\nU.S. at 220, 102 S.Ct. 2382.  Crucial here is the fact that there now exist citizen children of members of the\nplaintiffs' class who will be harmed by the application of the law because they will be eligible for post-natal care\non terms inferior to those enjoyed by similarly situated children of qualified mothers.\nA question, of course, remains whether the plaintiff mothers have standing to raise the third-party rights of their\n168 citizen children.[35] \"Ordinarily, one may not claim *168 standing ... to vindicate the rights of some third party.\" \nBarrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 255, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 97 L.Ed. 1586 (1953). This limitation on a litigant's ability\nto raise the rights of a third-party, or jus tertii, is \"not constitutionally mandated.\" Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190,\n193, 97 S.Ct. 451, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976). Rather, the doctrine is a prudential \"`rule of self-restraint' designed to\nminimize unwarranted intervention into controversies where applicable constitutional questions are ill-defined and\nspeculative.\" Craig, 429 U.S. at 193, 97 S.Ct. 451. The general prudential rule, however, may be relaxed where\nits underlying justifications are absent. See Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826\n(1976).\nA litigant generally may bring an action on behalf of a third party if \"three important criteria are satisfied\": (i) first,\nthe litigant \"must have suffered an `injury in fact,' thus giving him or her a `sufficiently concrete interest' in the\noutcome of the issue in dispute\"; (ii) second, \"the litigant must have a close relation to the third party\"; and (iii)\nthird, \"there must exist some hindrance to the third party's ability to protect his or her own interests.\" Powers v.\nOhio, 499 U.S. 400, 410-11, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991) (citing Singleton, 428 U.S. at 112-16, 96\nS.Ct. 2868); see also Campbell v. Louisiana, 523 U.S. 392, 118 S.Ct. 1419, 1422-23, 140 L.Ed.2d 551 (1998)\n(applying three prerequisites for third-party standing set forth in Powers).\nHere, as explained above, plaintiffs have suffered a concrete injury in fact. With respect to the second factor,\nplaintiffs' interests are inextricably linked to the rights of their citizen children and are equally as intense. Plaintiffs'\nright to obtain Medicaid coverage for routine prenatal care is involved pari passu with the rights of their children to\nbe considered automatically eligible for Medicaid coverage for post-birth care and expenses.\nMoreover, as other courts have observed, the relationship between a parent and child is much closer than those\ninvolved in other cases in which third-party standing has been found to exist, for example, the relationship\nbetween a physician and patient, Singleton, 428 U.S. at 117, 96 S.Ct. 2868; Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S.\n479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), or that between a beer vendor and a class of potential purchasers of\nthe product, Craig, 429 U.S. at 195-96, 97 S.Ct. 451. The relationship between parent and child has been\ndeemed to be \"more than sufficient to address the concerns that underlie the prudential doctrine\" of third-party\nstanding. Elias v. United States Dep't of State, 721 F.Supp. 243, 246-47 (N.D.Cal.1989). Other courts have\npermitted a child to assert his or her parent's equal protection rights in challenging the validity of statutes that\nconferred United States citizenship on the foreign-born off-spring of United States citizen fathers, but not United\nStates citizen mothers, see Wauchope v. United States Dep't of State, 985 F.2d 1407, 1411 (9th Cir.1993); Elias,\n721 F.Supp. at 246-47, or which chilled the parent's right to adopt a child, Lindley ex rel. Lindley v. Sullivan, 889\nF.2d 124, 129 (7th Cir.1989); see also Irving v. Clark, 758 F.2d 1260, 1267-68 (8th Cir.1985) (finding that heir and\n\ndevisee had third-party standing to assert Fifth Amendment rights of her decedent in challenging the\nconstitutionality of Indian Land Consolidation Act), aff'd sub nom. Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 107 S.Ct. 2076,\n95 L.Ed.2d 668 (1987). Further, the effectiveness of a parent's representation of his or her child is reflected in the\nwell-established tradition that permits parents to sue as the representatives of their minor children and to\n\"maintain litigation that rests directly on the standing of the children themselves.\" 13 Wright et al., Federal\nPractice and Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d § 3531.9 (2d ed.1984); see also, e.g., Sherman v. Community Consol.\n169 Sch. Dist. 21, 980 F.2d 437, 441 (7th Cir.1992) (finding that *169 father had derivative standing to sue as child's\nguardian).\nFinally, with regard to the ability of the third party to assert his or her own right, the answer is obvious. The citizen\nchildren of the members of the plaintiff class are minor children, many of whom will suffer from physical and\nmental disabilities as a result of birth defects caused by the Secretary's denial of prenatal care to their mothers,\nand, thus, are unable to effectively assert their own interests. The Secretary's provision of Medicaid coverage for\nprenatal care to their alien mothers is vital to the citizen children's ability to obtain automatic eligibility for\nMedicaid at birth.\nAccordingly, this Court finds that plaintiffs have satisfied the prerequisites of third-party standing set forth in \nPowers and have standing to assert the Fifth Amendment equal protection rights of their citizen children. I turn\ntherefore to the constitutionality of the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act to\ndeny Medicaid coverage for routine prenatal care to their unqualified alien mothers as it impacts their citizen\nchildren at the moment of their birth.\nEqual Protection Challenge Level of Review\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \"[n]o person shall be ... deprived of life,\nliberty, or property without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. While the Fifth Amendment contains no\nequal protection clause, \"[t]he concept of equal justice under the law is served by the Fifth Amendment's\nguarantee of due process, as well as by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Hampton v.\nMow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 100, 96 S.Ct. 1895, 48 L.Ed.2d 495 (1976) (\"Hampton I\"); see also Weinberger v.\nWiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 638 n. 2, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975). It is also settled law that aliens,\nwhether lawfully or unlawfully present in this country, are persons entitled to protection under the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments. See Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 77, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976) (Fifth\nAmendment); Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 596, 73 S.Ct. 472, 97 L.Ed. 576 (1953) (Fifth\nAmendment); Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 48, 70 S.Ct. 445, 94 L.Ed. 616,modified,339 U.S. 908,\n70 S.Ct. 564, 94 L.Ed. 1336 (1950) (Fifth Amendment); Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 371, 91 S.Ct. 1848,\n29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971) (Fourteenth Amendment); Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228, 238, 16 S.Ct. 977,\n41 L.Ed. 140 (1896) (Fifth Amendment).\n[36]\nWhile similar analyses are utilized for equal protection claims under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments,\nthe \"two protections are not always coextensive.\" Hampton I, 426 U.S. at 100, 96 S.Ct. 1895. \"Not only does the\nlanguage of the two Amendments differ, but more importantly, there may be overriding national interests which\njustify selective federal legislation that would be unacceptable for an individual State.\" Id.\nCongress, of course, has broad plenary authority over matters of immigration and naturalization, and in\nexercising this authority, Congress has the power to treat aliens differently from citizens and \"regularly makes\nrules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.\" Mathews, 426 U.S. at 80, 96 S.Ct. 1883. Because of this\nbroad authority to regulate aliens' entry to, and the conditions under which they may remain in this country, the\nrole of the Judiciary in reviewing congressional action related to immigration matters is very limited. See, e.g., \nFiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 796, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977); Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753,\n170 768-70, 92 S.Ct. 2576, 33 L.Ed.2d 683 (1972). The federal defendant thus argues, relying *170 primarily on \nMathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976), that this Court may apply only the rational\nbasis or a highly deferential standard of review to determine the constitutionality of the Secretary's application of\nSection 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act to deny Medicaid coverage for routine prenatal care to unqualified\npregnant aliens. Relying primarily on the reasoning of Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d\n\n786 (1982), plaintiffs argue that the Secretary's application of the alienage restriction in Section 401(a) should be\nsubjected to heightened scrutiny because the classification will result in the imposition of severe and lifelong\n[37]\nburdens on a discrete class of innocent citizen children unaccountable for their disabling status.\nIn order to properly evaluate the arguments of the parties, it is helpful first to consider the broader context of\n[38]\nconstitutional treatment of immigration measures and alienage classifications.  The Supreme Court has long\nheld that \"`over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over' the\nadmission of aliens.\" Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 792, 97 S.Ct. 1473 (quoting Oceanic Steam Co. v.

While the\n[41]\nstandard applied in recent years has been phrased in slightly differing language, it remains highly deferential.\nThe Court's most recent formulation states that congressional action within the scope of its plenary powers is\nsubject to rational basis review. See Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993); \naccord Azizi v. Thornburgh, 908 F.2d 1130, 1133 & n. 2 (2d Cir.1990); Abreu v. Callahan, 971 F.Supp. 799, 809\n(S.D.N.Y.1997).\nAccordingly, the lower federal courts have uniformly applied the rational basis standard of review or its substantial\nequivalent in considering Fifth Amendment equal protection challenges to federal laws that regulate aliens. See,\ne.g., United States v. Lue, 134 F.3d 79, 86-87 (2d Cir. 1998); Moving Phones Partnership v. Federal\nCommunications Commission, 998 F.2d 1051, 1056 (D.C.Cir.1993),cert. denied sub nom.

Mar.31, 1998),aff'd, 189 F.3d 598 (7th Cir.1999); Kiev v. Glickman, 991 F.Supp.\n1090, 1099 (D.Minn.1998); Rodriguez v. United States, 983 F.Supp. 1445, 1457 (S.D.Fla. 1997),aff'd,169 F.3d\n1342 (11th Cir.1999); Abreu, 971 F.Supp. at 815.\nIn Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976), the Court considered a Fifth Amendment\nequal protection challenge to a federal statute that granted eligibility for Medicare Part B supplemental benefits to\nresident citizens who were sixty-five years or older but denied eligibility to comparable aliens unless they had\n[42]\nbeen admitted for permanent residence and had resided in the United States for at least five years. See id. at\n69, 96 S.Ct. 1883.\n172 *172 After recognizing that aliens are persons entitled to the protections of the Fifth Amendment, the Court went\non to state:\nThe fact that all persons, aliens and citizens alike, are protected by the Due Process Clause does\nnot lead to the further conclusion that all aliens are entitled to enjoy all the advantages of\ncitizenship or, indeed, to the conclusion that all aliens must be placed in a single homogenous\n\nlegal classification. For a host of constitutional and statutory provisions rest on the premise that a\nlegitimate distinction between citizens and aliens may justify attributes and benefits for one class\nnot accorded to the other, and the class of aliens is itself a heterogeneous multitude of persons\nwith a wide-ranging variety of ties to this country.\nId. at 78-79, 96 S.Ct. 1883. The Court then recognized that Congress, \"[i]n the exercise of its broad power over\nnaturalization and immigration, ... regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens\" and\nthat a distinction by Congress between citizens and aliens \"does not in itself imply that such disparate treatment\nis `invidious.'\" Id. at 80, 96 S.Ct. 1883.\nThat said, however, the Court focused on the fact that the legislative classification at issue in Mathews did not in\nfact distinguish between citizens and aliens. Rather, the statute classified aliens into two groups 00 one eligible for\n97\na federal benefit program and one not. The Court thus narrowly framed the question presented by the plaintiffs'\nchallenge to the classification as follows: \"The real question presented by this case is not whether discrimination\nbetween citizens and aliens is permissible; rather, it is whether the statutory discrimination within the class of\naliens 00 allowing benefits to some aliens but not to others 00 is permissible.\" Id. at 80, 96 S.Ct. 1883.\n97 97\nBefore considering this question, the Court noted the special importance of broad deference to the legislative and\nexecutive branches in matters affecting aliens under the plenary power doctrine, stating:\nFor reasons long recognized as valid, the responsibility for regulating the relationship between the\nUnited States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal\nGovernment. Since decisions in these matters may implicate our relations with foreign powers,\nand since a wide variety of classifications must be defined in light of the changing political and\neconomic circumstances, such decisions are frequently of a character more appropriate to either\nthe Legislature or to the Executive than to the Judiciary.... Any rule of constitutional law that would\ninhibit the flexibility of the political branches of government to respond to changing world\nconditions should be adopted only with the greatest caution. The reasons that preclude judicial\nreview of political questions also dictate a narrow standard of review of decisions made by the\nCongress or the President in the area of immigration and naturalization.\nId. at 81, 96 S.Ct. 1883. The Court went on to define the scope of its deferential standard of review as applied to\nthe challenged classification as follows:\nSince it is obvious that Congress has no constitutional duty to provide all aliens with the welfare\nbenefits provided to citizens, the party challenging the constitutionality of the particular line\nCongress has drawn has the burden of advancing principled reasoning that will at once invalidate\n173 that line and yet tolerate *173 a different line separating some aliens from others.\nId. at 82, 96 S.Ct. 1883. Applying that standard to the lines Congress had drawn in providing that only certain\naliens were eligible for Medicare Part B supplemental benefits, a unanimous Court concluded that the\nclassification was constitutionally permissible because it was not \"wholly irrational.\" Id. at 83, 96 S.Ct. 1883. The\nCourt went on to state:\nThe task of classifying persons for medical benefits, like the task of drawing lines for federal tax\npurposes, inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to\nfavored treatment be placed on different sides of the line; the differences between the eligible and\nthe ineligible are differences in degree rather than differences in the character of their respective\nclaims. When this kind of policy choice must be made, we are especially reluctant to question the\nexercise of congressional judgment. In this case, since appellees have not identified a principled\nbasis for prescribing a different standard of review than the one selected by Congress, they have,\nin effect, merely invited us to substitute our judgment for that of Congress in deciding which aliens\nshall be eligible to participate in the supplementary insurance program upon the same conditions\nas citizens. We decline the invitation.\nId. at 83-84, 96 S.Ct. 1883.\n\nWhile the Court conceded that the strict scrutiny standard applies to Fourteenth Amendment equal protection\nchallenges to state classifications of aliens, see, e.g., Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 372, 91 S.Ct. 1848,\n29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971), it rejected the argument that strict scrutiny also applies to Fifth Amendment equal\nprotection challenges to federal classifications of aliens. The Court explained, \"the Fourteenth Amendment's\nlimits on state powers are substantively different from the constitutional provisions applicable to the federal power\nover immigration and naturalization.\" Mathews, 436 U.S. at 86-87, 98 S.Ct. 1690. This difference obtains\nbecause \"it is the business of the political branches of the Federal Government, rather than that of ... the States\n... to regulate the conditions of entry and residence of aliens. The equal protection analysis also involves\nsignificantly different considerations because it concerns the relationship between aliens and the States rather\nthan between aliens and the Federal Government.\" Id. at 84-85, 98 S.Ct. 1690. Thus, the Court concluded, it is\nappropriate to apply strict scrutiny when reviewing a state legislative classification based on alienage, but to\napply the considerably narrower \"wholly irrational\" or rational basis standard when reviewing a comparable\nclassification by the federal government. Id. at 86-87, 98 S.Ct. 1690.\nThe federal defendant argues that Mathews controls the determination of the proper standard of review in this\ncase. In support of this contention, the federal defendant observes that the other lower federal courts which have\nconsidered equal protection challenges to the provisions of the Welfare Reform Act that restrict qualified aliens'\neligibility for certain federal welfare programs have found Mathews controlling and, accordingly, have uniformly\napplied a rational basis standard of review. See Kiev v. Glickman, 991 F.Supp. 1090, 1093-99 (D.Minn.1998)\n(Section 402 of the Welfare Reform Act); Sinelnikov v. Shalala, No. 1998 WL 164889, at *11 (same); Rodriguez v.\nUnited States, 983 F.Supp. 1445, 1453-57 (S.D.Fla.1997),aff'd,169 F.3d 1342 (11th Cir.1999) (same); Abreu v.\nCallahan, 971 F.Supp. 799, 806-15 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (same). In each of these cases, lawful permanent resident or\nother legal aliens disqualified from receiving food stamps or supplemental security income benefits as a result of\n174 the citizenship requirement included Section 402 of the Welfare Reform Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1612, *174 claimed that\n[43]\nSection 402 violated their Fifth Amendment rights to equal protection. See Kiev, 991 F.Supp. at 1090; \nSinelnikov, 1998 WL 164889, at *1; Rodriguez, 983 F.Supp. at 1445; Abreu, 971 F.Supp. at 799. In each of these\ncases, the courts found that the restrictions in Section 402 of the Welfare Reform Act on the eligibility of qualified\naliens for certain federal welfare programs, like the legislative classification at issue in Mathews, discriminate\namong categories of aliens, rather than against aliens generally. Instead of distinguishing between citizens and\naliens generally, Section 402 of the Welfare Reform Act, like the statute at issue in Mathews, provides that certain\nqualified aliens are eligible for certain federal welfare programs while other qualified aliens are not. These courts\nhave thus found Section 402 of the Welfare Reform Act to be an exercise of Congress' broad plenary power to\ndraw legitimate distinctions between different categories of aliens in the allocation of federal public welfare\nbenefits which warrants only rational basis scrutiny.\nIn determining the proper level of scrutiny to be applied in this case, this Court must distinguish between the\nequal protection claims brought by plaintiffs on their own behalf and those brought by plaintiffs on behalf of their\nborn citizen children. In short, heightened scrutiny applies for claims arising from the rights of the citizen children\nwhile only rational basis analysis obtains for claims brought by plaintiffs on their own behalf.\nThe Supreme Court has consistently rejected the claim that illegal or undocumented aliens may be considered a\n\"suspect class\" for the purposes of equal protection analysis. See Plyler, 457 U.S. at 219 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. 2382\n(\"Unlike most of the classifications that we have recognized as suspect, entry into this class, by virtue of entry\ninto this country, is the product of voluntary action. Indeed, entry into the class is itself a crime.\"). \"Persuasive\narguments support the view that a State may withhold its beneficence from those whose very presence within the\n175 United States is the product of their own unlawful conduct.\" Plyler, 457 U.S. at 219, 102 *175 S.Ct. 2382.[44] As\nthe federal defendant notes, plaintiffs may not rely on the reasoning of Plyler to support their own claims that the\nSecretary's application of Section 401(a) violates their own Fifth Amendment rights to equal protection because\nthey, unlike the undocumented alien children who formed the plaintiff class in Plyler, are at fault for their presence\n[45]\nin this country, whether it be lawful or unlawful.\nThe citizen children of the members of the plaintiff class, however, like the alien children in Plyler, are not\ncomparably situated to their alien mothers. While their alien mothers \"have the ability to conform their conduct to\nsocietal norms\" and presumably the ability to remove themselves from this country, the citizen children of the\n\nmembers of the plaintiff class \"`can neither affect their [mothers'] conduct'\" nor alter their mothers' immigration\nstatus. Plyler, 457 U.S. at 220, 102 S.Ct. 2382 (quoting Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 770, 97 S.Ct. 1459, 52\nL.Ed.2d 31 (1977)). Yet the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act to deny their alien\nmothers Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care results in the imposition of a discriminatory burden on these newborn\ncitizen children on the sole basis of a characteristic over which they have no control 00 the immigration status of\n97\ntheir mothers. As discussed above, the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) to deny Medicaid for routine\nprenatal care to their alien mothers operates to deny these newborn innocent citizen children automatic eligibility\nfor Medicaid on the sole basis of the immigration status of their mother. Moreover, the ultimate result of the\nSecretary's denial of such prenatal care is the imposition of severe and potentially lifelong physical and mental\ndisabilities on these innocent citizen children on account of the conduct and status of their mothers.\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that \"[l]egislation directing the onus of a parent's misconduct\nagainst his children does not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice.\" Plyler, 457 U.S. at 220, 102 S.Ct.\n2382; see also Jimenez v. Weinberger, 417 U.S. 628, 632, 94 S.Ct. 2496, 41 L.Ed.2d 363 (1974); Weber v. Aetna\nCasualty & Surety Co., 406 U.S. 164, 175, 92 S.Ct. 1400, 31 L.Ed.2d 768 (1972).\n[V]isiting ... condemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and unjust. Moreover, imposing\ndisabilities on the ... child is contrary to the basic concept of our system of justice that legal\nburdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility or wrongdoing. Obviously, no\nchild is responsible for his birth and penalizing the ... child is an ineffectual 00 as well as an unjust\n97\n00 way of deterring the parent.\n97\nWeber, 406 U.S. at 175, 92 S.Ct. 1400 (footnote omitted); see also Pickett v. Brown, 462 U.S. 1, 7-8, 103 S.Ct.\n2199, 76 L.Ed.2d 372 (1983) (quoting Weber); Plyler, 457 U.S. at 220, 102 S.Ct. 2382 (same); Parham v.\nHughes, 441 U.S. 347, 352-53, 99 S.Ct. 1742, 60 L.Ed.2d 269 (1979) (same); Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762,\n769-70, 97 S.Ct. 1459, 52 L.Ed.2d 31 (1977) (same); Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U.S. 495, 505, 96 S.Ct. 2755, 49\nL.Ed.2d 651 (1976) (same); Jimenez, 417 U.S. at 632, 94 S.Ct. 2496 (same); New Jersey Welfare Rights Org. v.\nCahill, 411 U.S. 619, 620, 93 S.Ct. 1700, 36 L.Ed.2d 543 (1973) (same).\nIn Plyler, the Supreme Court relied upon this rationale to hold that a Texas law that withheld state funds from local\n176 school districts for the education of undocumented alien children and permitted local *176 school districts to deny\nenrollment to those children violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court in \nPlyler applied a heightened level of scrutiny rather than the traditional rational basis test, finding that the state's\nlegislative classification could not \"be considered rational unless it furthers some substantial goal of the State.\" \nPlyler, 457 U.S. at 224, 102 S.Ct. 2382. Before selecting this intermediate level of judicial scrutiny, Justice\nBrennan wrote for the majority of the Court:\nUndocumented aliens cannot be treated as a suspect class because their presence in this country\nin violation of federal law is not a \"constitutional irrelevancy.\" Nor is education a fundamental right;\na State need not justify by compelling necessity every variation in the manner in which education\nis provided to its population. But more is involved in these cases than the abstract question\nwhether § 21.031 discriminates against a suspect class, or whether education is a fundamental\nright. Section 21.031 imposes a lifetime hardship on a discrete class of children not accountable\nfor their disabling status.\nPlyler, 457 U.S. at 223, 102 S.Ct. 2382.\nThe Court's explicit adoption of heightened scrutiny in Plyler is notable because the Court had theretofore only\nexpressly adopted the language of heightened scrutiny where a suspect class was involved or a fundamental\n[46]\nright at stake.  Writing in dissent, Chief Justice Burger found the majority's adoption of a heightened standard\nof review unsupported by the Court's equal protection jurisprudence: \"Once it is conceded 00 as the Court does 00\n97 97\nthat illegal aliens are not a suspect class, and that education is not a fundamental right, our inquiry should focus\non and be limited to whether the legislative classification at issue bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state\npurpose.\" Plyler, 457 U.S. at 248, 102 S.Ct. 2382 (Burger, C.J., dissenting).\n\nThe Court's adoption of a heightened standard of review in Plyler, however, accords with the long line of cases in\nwhich the Court has subjected federal and state legislative classifications that impose disabilities on innocent\nchildren on the sole basis of the conduct of their parents to more rigorous judicial review. In the vast majority of\nthese cases, the Court has considered and struck down as unconstitutional legislative classifications that impose\ndisabilities on illegitimate children on the sole basis of their illegitimate status. See Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456,\n108 S.Ct. 1910, 100 L.Ed.2d 465 (1988) (striking down as unconstitutional a Pennsylvania six-year statute of\nlimitations on paternity suits brought on behalf of illegitimate children); Pickett v. Brown, 462 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct.\n2199, 76 L.Ed.2d 372 (1983) (striking down as unconstitutional a Tennessee two-year statute of limitations on\npaternity suits brought on behalf of certain illegitimate children); Mills v.

Perez, 409 U.S. 535, 93 S.Ct. 872, 35\nL.Ed.2d 56 (1973) (holding that once a state \"posits a judicially enforceable right on behalf of children to needed\nsupport from their natural fathers there is no constitutionally sufficient justification for denying such an essential\nright to a child simply because its natural father has not married its mother\"); Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety\nCo., 406 U.S. 164, 92 S.Ct. 1400, 31 L.Ed.2d 768 (1972) (striking down as unconstitutional a Louisiana statute\nthat denied workers compensation benefits to dependent, but unacknowledged, illegitimate children); Levy v.\nLouisiana, 391 U.S. 68, 88 S.Ct. 1509, 20 L.Ed.2d 436 (1968) (holding that state may not create a right of action\nin favor of children for the wrongful death of a parent and exclude illegitimate children from the benefit of such a\nright); see also King v.

Nonetheless,\n[48]\nthe Court has said that classifications based on illegitimacy are not \"suspect\" or subject to strict scrutiny.\nPickett, 462 U.S. at 8, 103 S.Ct. 2199; Trimble, 430 U.S. at 767, 97 S.Ct. 1459; Mathews, 427 U.S. at 506, 96\nS.Ct. 2755; Labine, 401 U.S. at 532, 91 S.Ct. 1017.\nThe Court has, however, consistently applied heightened scrutiny to legislative classifications based on\nillegitimacy. See, e.g., Clark, 486 U.S. at 456, 108 S.Ct. 1910; Pickett, 462 U.S. at 1, 103 S.Ct. 2199; Mills, 456\n178 U.S. at 91, 102 S.Ct. 1549; Trimble, 430 U.S. at 762, 97 S.Ct. 1459; Jimenez, 417 U.S. at 628, 94 S.Ct. 2496; \n*178New Jersey Welfare Rights Org., 411 U.S. at 619, 93 S.Ct. 1700; Gomez, 409 U.S. at 535, 93 S.Ct. 872; \nWeber, 406 U.S. at 164, 92 S.Ct. 1400; see also Trimble, 430 U.S. at 781, 97 S.Ct. 1459 (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting) (citing majority opinions that include language suggesting that illegitimacy classifications \"will receive\na more far-reaching scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause than will other laws regulating economic and\n[49]\nsocial conditions\").  In more recent cases, the Court has explicitly stated that illegitimacy classifications are\nsubject to an intermediate level of scrutiny. See, e.g., Clark, 486 U.S. at 461, 108 S.Ct. 1910; Pickett, 462 U.S. at\n8, 103 S.Ct. 2199; Mills, 456 U.S. at 99, 102 S.Ct. 1549; Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. 259, 265, 99 S.Ct. 518, 58 L.Ed.2d\n503 (1978) (plurality opinion); see also Trimble, 430 U.S. at 767, 97 S.Ct. 1459.\nIn finding heightened scrutiny appropriate, the Court has repeatedly emphasized Justice Powell's observation in \nWeber that imposing disabilities on the illegitimate child on the basis of the sins of the parent \"is illogical and\nunjust\" and \"contrary to the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to\n\nindividual responsibility or wrongdoing.\" Weber, 406 U.S. at 175, 92 S.Ct. 1400; see, e.g., Clark, 486 U.S. at 461,\n108 S.Ct. 1910 (\"[W]e have invalidated classifications that burden illegitimate children for the sake of punishing\nthe illicit relations of their parents, because `visiting this condemnation on the head of an infant is illogical and\nunjust.'\"); Pickett, 462 U.S. at 7-8, 103 S.Ct. 2199 (noting that the Court's consideration of the constitutional\nvalidity of statutory classifications based on illegitimacy \"has been animated by a special concern for\ndiscrimination against illegitimate children,\" and quoting Weber); Mills, 456 U.S. at 101 n. 8, 102 S.Ct. 1549\n(\"[W]e have repeatedly held that `imposing disabilities on the illegitimate child is contrary to the basic concept of\nour system that burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility or wrong-doing.'\"); Parham,\n441 U.S. at 352, 99 S.Ct. 1742 (\"The basic rationale of these decisions is that it is unjust and ineffective for\nsociety to express its condemnation of procreating outside the marital relationship by punishing the illegitimate\nchild who is in no way responsible for his situation and is unable to change it.\"); Lalli, 439 U.S. at 265, 99 S.Ct.\n518; Trimble, 430 U.S. at 769-70, 97 S.Ct. 1459; Mathews, 427 U.S. at 505, 96 S.Ct. 2755.\nAs one commentator has persuasively argued, this notion that children should not be penalized for the sins of\ntheir parents, commonly referred to as \"blood taint,\" is \"deeply embedded\" in the Constitution, most notably in the\n[50]\nFramers' hostility to the archaic common law penalty of \"corruption of the blood,\" a form of a bill of attainder.\nMax Stier, Note, Corruption of the Blood and Equal Protection: Why the Sins of the Parent Should Not Matter, 44\nStan.L.Rev. 727, 729-39 (1992). This hostility to the corruption of the blood penalty finds its textual foundations in\nArticle III, Section 3, Clause 2 of the Constitution, which provides: \"The Congress shall have Power to declare the\n179 Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or *179 Forfeiture except\nduring the Life of the Person attained.\" U.S. Const. art. III, § 3, cl. 2. This provision has been interpreted by the\nFramers, the Supreme Court, and commentators as \"`a declaration that the children should not bear the iniquity\nof the fathers.'\" Stier, Note, supra, at 730-31 (quoting Wallach v. Van Riswick, 92 U.S. 202, 210, 23 L.Ed. 473\n(1875)).\nIn addition, members of the Court have repeatedly acknowledged this principle. See Korematsu v. United States,\n323 U.S. 214, 243, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (\"[I]f any fundamental assumption\nunderlies our system, it is that guilt is personal and not inheritable. Even if all of one's antecedents had been\nconvicted of treason, the Constitution forbids its penalties to be visited upon him, for it provides that `no Attainder\nof Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attained.'\"). Justice\nDouglas, in the context of arguing that the denial of AFDC benefits to children on the basis of the alleged\nimmorality of the mother violated the Equal Protection Clause, observed in his concurring opinion in King v.\nSmith, 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968), that \"[t]his penalizing the children for the sins of\ntheir mother is reminiscent of the archaic corruption of the blood, a form of bill of attainder.\" Id. at 336 n. 5, 88\nS.Ct. 2128 (Douglas, J., concurring).\nIn this case, the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act to deny Medicaid benefits for\nroutine prenatal care to unqualified pregnant aliens imposes a discriminatory burden on a class of innocent\ncitizen children solely on the basis of the immigration status of their mothers. As a result of the Secretary's denial\nof such prenatal care, the citizen child of an unqualified alien mother is denied automatic eligibility for Medicaid,\nwhile the similarly situated citizen child of an otherwise qualified citizen mother is deemed automatically eligible\nfor Medicaid. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(e)(4); 42 C.F.R. § 435.117. Moreover, the Secretary's denial of such\nprenatal care will result not only in the denial of automatic eligibility to these newborn citizen children but also in\nthe imposition of severe and potentially lifelong birth defects on a significant number of these citizen children on\naccount of the alienage of their mothers. Such discrimination against the citizen child on the basis of the alienage\nstatus of the mother \"is reminiscent of the archaic corruption of the blood,\" King, 392 U.S. at 336 n. 5, 88 S.Ct.\n2128 (Douglas, J., concurring), and \"does not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice,\" Plyler, 457 U.S.\nat 219, 102 S.Ct. 2382.\nAccordingly, I find it appropriate to apply a heightened or intermediate standard of scrutiny to the equal protection\n180 claims of the citizen children of the members of the plaintiff class.[51] Nor may the rationale *180 of Plyler be\navoided here on the ground that this case, unlike Plyler, involves a challenge to a federal, rather than a state,\nalienage classification. To be sure, in considering the equal protection challenges brought by qualified aliens\ndeemed ineligible for certain federal programs under Section 402 of the Welfare Reform Act, some lower federal\n\ncourts have rejected arguments that Plyler requires the application of a heightened standard of review to those\nchallenges. These courts have found Plyler distinguishable on the ground that it involved a state, rather than a\nfederal, alienage classification and, thus, did not implicate Congress' plenary power over immigration. See \nRodriguez, 983 F.Supp. at 1457; Abreu, 971 F.Supp. at 813.\nThe instant case, however, presents a situation very different from those presented by previous equal protection\nchallenges to the constitutionality of Section 402 of the Welfare Reform Act. In this case, unlike the cases cited by\nthe federal defendant, the class directly affected by the Secretary's application of the alienage classification in\nSection 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act is not a class of aliens, but rather a class of otherwise eligible citizen\nchildren. Cf. Doe v. Reivitz, No. 85-C-793, slip. op. at 13-19 (E.D.Wis. July 22, 1986) (\"The class directly affected\nby the classification is not a class of illegal aliens, but a class of otherwise eligible citizens.\"), aff'd on other\ngrounds,830 F.2d 1441 (7th Cir.1987).\nThe Supreme Court has seldom considered the constitutionality of a federal alienage classification that results\nprimarily in harm to United States citizens. In Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977),\nthe Court considered a constitutional challenge to a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that\npermitted the illegitimate alien child of a United States citizen to seek a special preference immigration status by\nvirtue of his relationship with his natural mother but not by virtue of his relationship with his natural father. The\nCourt in Fiallo rejected the argument made by the plaintiffs and by Justices Marshall and Brennan in dissent that\n\"more searching judicial scrutiny\" should apply because the provision infringed upon the due process rights of\nUnited States citizens or implicated the fundamental constitutional interests of United States citizens in a familial\nrelationship. See id. at 794-95, 97 S.Ct. 1473. The majority of the Court found such an argument unpersuasive\nbecause it rested upon the incorrect assumption that the Act granted to American citizens a \"fundamental right\" in\nthe admission of certain aliens. See id. at 795 n. 6, 97 S.Ct. 1473. The Court went on to state that\nthe fallacy of the assumption is rooted deeply in fundamental principles of sovereignty.\nWe are dealing here with an exercise of the Nation's sovereign power to admit or exclude\nforeigners in accordance with perceived national interests....\nAs Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote years ago, the formulation of these \"[p]olicies pertaining to the\nentry of aliens ... is entrusted exclusively to Congress.\" Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. at 531, 74 S.Ct.\n737.... That is not to say ... that the Government's power in this area is never subject to judicial\nreview. But our cases do make clear that despite the impact of these classifications on the\n181 interests of those already within our borders, congressional determinations *181 such as this one\nare subject only to limited judicial review.\nId. (citations omitted). Similarly, in Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 92 S.Ct. 2576, 33 L.Ed.2d 683 (1972), the\nCourt rejected the argument that it should apply a heightened standard of review to a challenge brought by\nUnited States citizens to the Attorney General's discretionary power under the Immigration and Nationality Act to\ndeny a visa to Ernest E. Mandel, a Belgian journalist and Marxist theoretician who had been invited by American\nscholars and students to attend academic conferences in the United States. Mandel, as an alien who was a\nproponent of \"the economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism,\" was ineligible to\nreceive a visa under the Act absent a waiver by the Attorney General. The Court rejected the arguments of the\ncitizen-appellees, the American scholars and students who had invited Mandel, that the Attorney General's denial\nof Mandel's request for a visa violated their First Amendment rights, recognizing that \"plenary congressional\npower to make policies and rules for the exclusion of aliens has long been firmly established.\" Id. at 769-70, 92\nS.Ct. 2576. The Court went on to hold that, \"when the Executive exercises this power [to deny a waiver] on the\nbasis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason, the courts will neither look behind the exercise of that\ndiscretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against the First Amendment interests of those who seek\npersonal communication with the applicant.\" Id. at 770, 92 S.Ct. 2576.\nThe instant case, however, is distinguishable from Fiallo and Kleindienst because, unlike those cases, the\nstatutory provision at issue here does not directly relate to Congress' \"broad power to determine which classes of\n[52]\naliens may lawfully enter the country.\" Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 794, 97 S.Ct. 1473.  Rather, the provision concerns\nthe provision of welfare benefits to aliens and results in the denial of welfare benefits to United States citizens\n\nbased upon the alienage status of their mothers. Moreover, the Secretary's application of the legislative\nclassification at issue results in the disparate treatment of a class of citizens, rather than a class of aliens.\nAccordingly, the plenary federal power over immigration and naturalization does not require this Court to apply a\ndeferential standard of review to the equal protection claims raised by the citizen children of the members of the\n[53]\nplaintiff class.\nIn evaluating the equal protection claims raised by the members of the plaintiff class on their own behalf,\nhowever, it is clear that this Court may apply only a rational basis standard of review. Unlike their citizen children,\n182 the members of the plaintiff class present no claim that they are being discriminated against on the basis *182 of\nanother's status or conduct. The members of the plaintiff class, unlike their citizen children, are responsible for\ntheir own immigration status. Cf. Parham, 441 U.S. at 353, 99 S.Ct. 1742 (\"Unlike the illegitimate child for whom\nthe status of illegitimacy is involuntary and immutable, the appellant here was responsible for fostering an\nillegitimate child and for failing to change its status.\"). Moreover, unlike their citizen children, the members of the\nplaintiff class, whether they entered this country lawfully or unlawfully, cannot \"advance even a colorable\nconstitutional claim to a share in\" federal public welfare benefits. Mathews, 426 U.S. at 80, 96 S.Ct. 1883. Here,\nas in Mathews, the members of the plaintiff class claim that the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) of the\nWelfare Reform Act denies them the equal protection of the laws by discriminating among classes of aliens\neligible for Medicaid benefits. Because restrictions upon the eligibility of aliens for federal welfare benefits fall\nwithin the plenary power doctrine, see Mathews, 426 U.S. at 81-83, 96 S.Ct. 1883, this Court must apply a\ndeferential standard of review when considering the particular line that Congress has chosen to draw among\ncategories of aliens eligible for those benefits, see id. at 83-84, 96 S.Ct. 1883. Accordingly, I must reject the\nclaims that plaintiffs make on their own behalf because I cannot find that Congress' denial of prenatal care nor\nthe distinctions drawn among classes of aliens lacks a rational basis.\nEqual Protection Claims of Citizen Children\nI now turn to the merits of the claim raised by plaintiffs on behalf of their citizen children that the Secretary's\napplication of the alienage classification in Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act to deny their alien mothers\nMedicaid coverage for routine prenatal care violates their Fifth Amendment equal protection rights. To withstand\nintermediate or heightened scrutiny, the Secretary's application of the alienage classification in Section 401(a)\nmust be substantially related to a legitimate congressional objective. See Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461, 108\nS.Ct. 1910, 100 L.Ed.2d 465 (1988); Pickett v. Brown, 462 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 2199, 76 L.Ed.2d 372, (1983); Plyler,\n457 U.S. at 223-24, 102 S.Ct. 2382; Mills v. Habluetzel, 456 U.S. 91, 99, 102 S.Ct. 1549, 71 L.Ed.2d 770 (1982).\nIn evaluating the constitutionality of the Secretary's application of the alienage classification in Section 401(a) to\ndeny Medicaid coverage for prenatal care under the standard of intermediate scrutiny, this Court may\n\"appropriately take into account its costs to the Nation and to the innocent children who are its victims.\" Plyler,\n457 U.S. at 223-24, 102 S.Ct. 2382. Here, as with the legislative classification at issue in Plyler, the Secretary's\ndenial of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care for unqualified pregnant aliens \"imposes a lifetime hardship\non a discrete class of children not accountable for their disabling status.\" Id. The Secretary's denial of routine\nprenatal care will result in the imposition of severe and potentially lifelong mental and physical disabilities on a\nsubstantial number of the citizen children of the members of the plaintiff class. These physical and mental\ndisabilities will handicap these innocent children for some substantial portion if not all of their lives and will pose\nsignificant obstacles to their abilities to accomplish their individual goals, as well as their abilities to \"be self-\nreliant and self-sufficient participants in society.\" Id. at 221-22, 102 S.Ct. 2382 (citing Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406\nU.S. 205, 221, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972)). Not only will these citizen children suffer for themselves, but\nthe burden of caring for these children will impose significant social and economic costs on their families and our\nNation. Accordingly, the Secretary's denial of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care must not only be\n183 substantially related to a legitimate congressional objective, but it must further \"some substantial *183 goal\" in\n[54]\ncomparison to its costs to the Nation and to the innocent citizen children it burdens with a lifetime of hardship.\nPlyler, 457 U.S. at 224, 102 S.Ct. 2382.\nThe Secretary's denial of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care to unqualified pregnant aliens pursuant to\nthe alienage restriction in Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act is unconstitutional under this standard.\n\nThe federal defendant argues that the Secretary's denial of Medicaid for routine prenatal care is substantially\nrelated to the legitimate congressional objectives set forth in Section 400 of the Welfare Reform Act. Section 400,\ncodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1601, reads, in pertinent part:\nThe Congress makes the following statements concerning national policy with respect to welfare\nand immigration:\n(1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law since this country's\nearliest immigration statutes.\n(2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United States that 00\n97\n184 *184 (A) aliens within the Nation's borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs,\nbut rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and\nprivate organizations, and\n(B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the United\nStates.\n(3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have been applying for and receiving public\nbenefits from Federal, State, and local governments at increasing rates.\n(4) Current eligibility rates for public assistance and unenforceable financial support agreements\nhave proved wholly incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the public benefits\nsystem.\n(5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new rules for eligibility and sponsorship\nagreements in order to assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration\npolicy.\n(6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided\nby the availability of public benefits....\nWelfare Reform Act § 400, 110 Stat. 2105, 2260 (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1601).\nThe federal defendant first argues that the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) to deny Medicaid for routine\nprenatal care to unqualified pregnant aliens furthers \"the compelling government interest [in] remov[ing] the\nincentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public welfare benefits.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1601(6). It\nargues that the Secretary's denial of Medicaid for routine prenatal care encourages a pregnant alien to leave this\ncountry while pregnant, if she is already here, or to not enter this country in the first place.\nWhile the removal of incentives for illegal immigration may be a legitimate congressional objective, this Court is\nunable to find that the denial of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care is \"substantially related\" to that\nobjective. The federal defendant's argument that the availability of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care or\nlack thereof is a substantial factor in controlling illegal immigration is, to be generous, \"highly speculative.\" Cf. \nLewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1214. The proposition that there exists any substantial number of alien women who are\nsimultaneously pregnant or contemplating pregnancy and, at the same time, deciding whether or not to enter or\nremain in this country illegally is one capable of being established or refuted by proof; yet, no evidence on this\nsubject has been forthcoming during the long history of this litigation. But even assuming the existence of some\nsubstantial number of such individuals, there is no evidence or even plausible argument that, in the mixture of\nfactors that presumably play a part in the decision-making process, the availability of prenatal care plays any\nsignificant role in deciding whether any given individual will decide to enter or remain in this country illegally. As\nthe Supreme Court observed in Plyler, the dominant incentive for illegal entry in most states is the availability of\nemployment. See Plyler, 457 U.S. at 228 & n. 24, 102 S.Ct. 2382.\nOn the other hand, weighed against the slight possibility that there may exist some alien women who are\npregnant or contemplating pregnancy who will in fact take into account and be encouraged or deterred from\n\nillegal immigration by the availability or lack of prenatal care benefits is the devastating impact on very substantial\nnumbers of U.S. citizen children as a result of the much more plausible scenario that large numbers of illegal\nalien women will find themselves pregnant in this country and unable or unwilling to leave despite the\nunavailability of prenatal care.\nThe federal defendant also argues that the Secretary's application of the alienage classification in Section 401(a)\n185 to deny Medicaid for routine prenatal care furthers *185 the \"compelling government interest\" in assuring that\naliens are self-sufficient and do not depend on the public benefits system to meet their needs. 8 U.S.C. § 1601\n(1), (2)(A), (5). Again, ensuring the self-sufficiency of aliens in this Country is a legitimate congressional purpose.\nIt is clear, however, that the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) to deny Medicaid benefits for routine\nprenatal care is not substantially related to that objective. The majority of the pregnant aliens who would be\ndenied Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care pursuant to Section 401(a) are categorically needy individuals\n\"`who earn no more than that necessary to cover the necessities of life.'\" Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1208 (quoting \nLewis III, 663 F.Supp. at 1174). By definition, the majority of these pregnant aliens are unable to afford the costs\nof privately sponsored routine prenatal care. Moreover, it is not disputed that a substantial number of the children\nof these unqualified alien women will suffer from low-birth weight or severe and potentially lifelong birth defects.\nEven if these children, as citizens, were able to apply for and eventually receive Medicaid assistance in their own\nnames, the social, economic, and psychological burdens of caring for these disabled children will \"demand such\ntime and resources from [these alien women] as to prevent them from leading economically productive lives.\" \n[55]\nLewis IV, 794 F.Supp. at 1202.  Accordingly, the denial of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care is not\nsubstantially related to the objective of encouraging unqualified pregnant aliens to be self-sufficient.\nFinally, the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) to deny Medicaid for routine prenatal care to unqualified\naliens is not substantially related to the legitimate congressional objective of curbing expenditures. It is again\nundisputed that routine prenatal care is more cost-effective than treating preventable birth defects and low birth\nweight after a child's birth. As discussed above, recent studies have shown that between $2 and $10 can be\nsaved in medical care costs for every dollar spent in providing routine prenatal care. (Minkoff Aff. ¶ 42.) Moreover,\nNew York State estimates that the expenditure of $15.5 million on prenatal care for undocumented alien women\nsaves an estimated $14.7 million in the costs of providing initial hospitalization for low-birth weight babies, not\neven including the substantial costs of providing lifelong medical care and special education for children born with\nsevere birth defects. (Minkoff Aff. ¶¶ 39 & 40.)\nThe substantial and known costs to the individual citizen children of the members of the plaintiff class, to New\nYork State, and to this nation of the Secretary's denial of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care to unqualified\npregnant aliens thus far outweigh the speculative benefits on which the federal defendant relies. When weighed\nagainst these costs, the purposes purportedly served by the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) to deny\nsuch prenatal care are \"wholly insubstantial.\" Accordingly, I find that the Secretary's application of the alienage\nclassification in Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act to deny Medicaid for routine prenatal care to\n186 unqualified aliens denies the citizen children *186 of the members of the plaintiff class the equal protection of the\nlaws and, thus, violates the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\nSeverability\nSection 433(c) of the Welfare Reform Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1643(c), provides that, \"[i]f any provision of this title or the\napplication of such provision to any person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this\ntitle and the applications of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\"\nAccordingly, this Court's decision affects only the Secretary's application of Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform\nAct to the provision of Medicaid benefits for non-emergency prenatal care to unqualified aliens.\nBecause the Secretary's application of the alien eligibility restriction in Section 401(a) of the Welfare Reform Act\nto deny Medicaid coverage for routine prenatal care to unqualified pregnant aliens violates the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment, the federal defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings vacating the\npermanent injunction issued by this Court on March 14, 1991, is denied.\n\nThe Clerk is directed to furnish a filed copy of the within to all parties.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] New York State joined the Medicaid program in 1966, authorizing the New York State Department of Social\nServices to establish a Medicaid plan covering both the categorically and the medically needy. See 1966\nN.Y.Laws, ch. 256 (codified as amended at N.Y.Soc.Serv. Law §§ 363 et seq.); see also DeJesus, 770 F.2d at\n319.\n[2] Section 103(a)(1) of the Welfare Reform Act repealed the AFDC program previously set forth in Part A of Title\nIV to the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 601 et seq., and replaced it with a series of block grants to the states. \nSee Welfare Reform Act § 103(a), 110 Stat. at 2112-13 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 601 et seq.). The\nWelfare Reform Act, however, preserved the link between Medicaid eligibility and the eligibility standards that had\nexisted under the old AFDC program as in effect as of July 16, 1996. See Welfare Reform Act § 114(a)(2), 110\nStat. at 2177 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-1).\n[3] Women in this category receive coverage only for services related to pregnancy (including prenatal, delivery,\npostpartum, and family planning services) and \"other conditions which may complicate pregnancy.\" 42 U.S.C. §\n1396a(a)(10) (concluding paragraph, exception (VII)).\n[4] The Second Circuit's decision in Lewis IV-A includes an extensive history of federal sponsorship of prenatal\ncare. See Lewis v. Grinker, 965 F.2d 1206, 1209-12 (2d Cir.1992).\n[5] As set forth in greater detail in Lewis IV-A, federal sponsorship of prenatal care before the enactment of the\nMedicaid statute in 1965 fell largely under the AFDC program. Beginning in the 1940's, the federal government\nreimbursed those states that chose to provide AFDC benefits to fetuses as \"dependent child[ren]\" under 42\nU.S.C. § 606(a). In Burns v. Alcala, 420 U.S. 575, 584, 95 S.Ct. 1180, 43 L.Ed.2d 469 (1975), the Supreme Court\nheld that fetuses were not dependent children within the meaning of the AFDC statute, and, thus, the states were\nnot required to provide AFDC benefits to pregnant women. Between 1975 and 1981, however, the Secretary\ncontinued to give states the option of treating fetuses as dependent children in order to provide AFDC benefits to\npregnant women. This informal practice, like the Secretary's informal practice of allowing states to provide\nMedicaid to fetuses as optional categorically needy individuals, was never adopted by formal regulation. See \nLewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1209.\n[6] Categorical requirements for AFDC included the presence in the household of a \"dependent child\" who was\n\"deprived of parental support\" in a prescribed manner. 42 U.S.C. § 606(a) (repealed).\n[7] This action was originally brought by plaintiffs Lydia Lewis and eight other named class representatives, all of\nwhom were non-legal permanent resident aliens residing in New York State. On January 16, 1989, then-Chief\nJudge Jack B. Weinstein certified a plaintiff class in this action, defined as \"all aliens residing in the State of New\nYork who have been denied Medicaid on the basis of their alienage.\" By order dated October 15, 1981, the class\ndefinition was modified to add the requirement that the aliens qualifying for membership in the class be living in\nNew York \"under color of law\"; the plaintiff class was thus redefined to include \"all aliens residing in New York\nState under color of law who have applied or attempted to apply for Medicaid benefits.\" By memorandum and\norder dated July 14, 1986, this Court denied the federal defendant's motion to decertify the class and granted the\nplaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint by modifying the class definition to delete the \"under color of law\"\nrequirement. By the same decision, this Court also granted the motions of five individuals to intervene as\nadditional named class representatives. Thus, the plaintiff class, as currently defined, includes \"all aliens residing\nin New York State who have applied or attempted to apply for Medicaid but have been or would be denied on the\nbasis of their alienage.\" Lewis v. Gross, 663 F.Supp. 1164, 1170-71 (E.D.N.Y.1986).\n[8] The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-509, 100 Stat. 1874, 2050.

No. 99-603, 100 Stat. 3359.\n\n[9] The House Report accompanying OBRA '86 cited this Court's decision in Lewis I and stated: \"In response to\nthe [Lewis] Court's invitation to clarify Congressional intent, the Committee bill amends the Medicaid statute to\nmake it explicit that Federal financial participation is not available for State expenditures for aliens who are not\nlawfully admitted for permanent residence or permanently residing in the U.S. under color of law.\" 1986 House\nReport, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3701.\n[10] Section 501 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"), Pub.L.\nNo. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, amended the definition of \"qualified alien\" to include certain battered alien spouses\nand children, regardless of their immigration status. See 8 U.S.C. § 1641(c)(7) (West Supp. 1999).\n[11] Newly excluded classes of aliens include, for example, immigrants who are in fact residing in the United\nStates with the knowledge and permission of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") whose departure\nthe INS does not contemplate enforcing and who do not fall within the definition of \"qualified alien\"; spouses and\nother immediate relatives of United States citizens for whom the citizen has filed an immediate relative petition\nand who has a pending application for adjustment of status; immigrants granted suspension of deportation due to\nextreme hardship other than domestic violence who are awaiting admission as a lawful permanent resident;\nimmigrants who have entered and continuously resided in the United States since before January 1, 1972; and\nimmigrants granted voluntary departure for humanitarian reasons whose departure the INS does not contemplate\nenforcing.\n[12] Other exceptions in Section 401(b)(1) include federal public benefits for short-term, non-cash, in-kind\nemergency disaster relief, § 401(b)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1611(b)(1)(B); certain community service programs\nspecified by the Attorney General, § 401(b)(1)(D), 8 U.S.C. § 1611(b)(1)(D); and certain programs for housing or\ncommunity development or financial assistance administered by the Secretary of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment or provided under section 306C of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, § 401(b)(1)\n(E), 8 U.S.C. § 1611(b)(1)(E).\n[13] The Second Circuit reiterated these findings in Lewis IV-A, noting that \"the Secretary does not dispute that\nprenatal care is cost effective or that a significant number of children will suffer birth defects as a direct result of\nthe denial of prenatal care to their non-PRUCOL mothers.\" Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1214. It found that \"[s]tudies\nhave shown that every dollar spent on prenatal care saves between two and ten dollars in future medical costs.\" \nId. at 1219. Recognizing that the unborn children of the members of the plaintiff class will become United States\ncitizens at the moment of their birth, the Second Circuit found that, \"[a]s Congress was aware, at that point the\nmedical neglect that these children suffered during their mothers' pregnancies will come home to roost in the\nhealth care system, at exponentially higher costs.\" Id.\n[14] In New York City, infant mortality has decreased from 16.1 per thousand in 1980 to 10.2 per thousand in\n1993. During the same period, the number of women in New York City who received only late prenatal care or\nnone at all dropped from 18.5% in 1980 to 10.7% in 1993. (Minkoff Aff. ¶¶ 15, 34.)\n[15] In New York City in 1985, the infant mortality rate per thousand for non-white babies was 15.6; in 1993,\ndespite the dramatic decrease in infant mortality among whites, the infant mortality rate for the non-white\npopulation was 13.2 per thousand live births. (Minkoff Aff. ¶ 16.)\n[16] The federal defendant also notes that the category of \"qualified aliens\" eligible for Medicaid under the\nWelfare Reform Act is much narrower and far more restrictive than the category of PRUCOL aliens eligible for\nMedicaid under OBRA '86. Accordingly, the federal defendant argues that, because the plain language of the\nWelfare Reform Act is the same in structure but far more sweeping in its prohibition than the plain language of\nOBRA '86, which the Second Circuit has already analyzed in Lewis IV-A, it follows that the equivalently structured\nbut far more restrictive plain language of the Welfare Reform Act also prohibits undocumented pregnant aliens\nfrom receiving Medicaid for routine prenatal care. Because plaintiffs and this Court acknowledge that the plain\nlanguage of the Section 401 precludes Medicaid coverage for routine prenatal care, however, it is unnecessary to\naddress the federal defendant's argument.\n\n[17] The bill that ultimately became the Welfare Reform Act, H.R.3734, was reported by the House in June 1996\nand by the Conference Committee in July 1996. See H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 104-725, at 1 (1996), reprinted in 1996\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 2649, 2649; H.R.Rep. No. 104-651, at 1 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2183, 2183.\n[18] Pursuant to Section 201(a)(1) of S.1664, certain excludable, deportable, and nonimmigrant aliens would\nhave been ineligible for federal public assistance and benefits: \n(1) IN GENERAL. 00 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an ineligible alien (as defined in subsection (f)(2))\n97\nshall not be eligible to receive 00\n97\n(A) any benefits under a public assistance program (as defined in subsection (f)(3)), except 00\n97\n(i) emergency medical services under title XIX of the Social Security Act,\n(ii) subject to paragraph (4), prenatal and postpartum services under title XIX of the Social Security Act,\n(iii) short-term emergency disaster relief,\n(iv) assistance or benefits under the National School Lunch Act,\n(v) assistance or benefits under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966,\n(vi) public health assistance for immunizations and, if the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines\nthat it is necessary to prevent the spread of a serious communicable disease, for testing and treatment for such\ndiseases, and\n(vii) such other service or assistance (such as soup kitchens, crisis counseling, intervention (including\nintervention for domestic violence), and short-term shelter) as the Attorney General specifies....\n[19] Section 201(a)(4) of S. 1664 further provided that no more than $120,000,000 could be expended under Title\nXIX of the Social Security Act for reimbursement of prenatal and postpartum services to such ineligible aliens.\nFurther, that subsection would have required states that had provided such services for a period of three years\nbefore the date of enactment, such as New York pursuant to this Court's permanent injunction in Lewis, to\ncontinue to provide such prenatal care and would have permitted other states to elect to provide such care.\n[20] While S. 1664 included its own version of a broad restriction on aliens' eligibility for federal welfare benefits,\nIIRIRA, as it was enacted, did not include such a restriction. In fact, the Welfare Reform Act was the only statute\nadopted by the 104th Congress to include such an alienage restriction.\n[21]See Karl N. Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons About How\nStatutes Are to Be Construed, 3 Vand.L.Rev. 395 (1950).\n[22] Plaintiffs also contend that the cases cited by the federal defendant are distinguishable because the courts in\nthose cases were responding to proposals to create new legislation or to change existing law. Plaintiffs argue\nthat, because the background law in this case included the Second Circuit's decision in Lewis IV-A, no specific\nchange was necessary to preserve Medicaid coverage for non-emergency prenatal care for unqualified aliens.\nThe Second Circuit's decision in Lewis IV-A, however, is controlling only in this Circuit.\n[23] Plaintiffs argue, inter alia, that the Conference Committee's statement is not entitled to authoritative weight\nbecause it purports to \"define a statutory term enacted by a prior Congress.\" (Pls.' Opp. at 33 n. 14.) They note\nthat the term \"emergency medical condition\" has been used without relevant amendment since 1986, 42 U.S.C. §\n1396b(v)(3), and the old statutory definition was explicitly incorporated by reference into the alien eligibility\nexception by the Welfare Reform Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1601(b)(1)(A). As the federal defendant observes, however, the\nConference Committee was commenting not only on the definition of \"emergency medical condition\" as that term\nis used in the Medicaid statute, but also on the scope of the emergency medical care exception created by a new\nstatute, the Welfare Reform Act. Accordingly, the Conference Committee's statement is entitled to substantial\nweight in ascertaining Congress' intent in enacting the new statute.\n\n[24] The federal defendant contends that the Second Circuit rejected this Court's reliance in Lewis IV on the\nmethodology of the constructively born child when it found that the plain language of OBRA '86 precluded\nMedicaid benefits for routine prenatal care for non-PRUCOL aliens. The federal defendant, however,\nmisconceives the nature of plaintiffs' reliance on the continued validity of that methodology. Plaintiffs cite its\ncontinuing validity only to show that Congress did not intend to limit its continued expansion of access to prenatal\ncare, not to show that the plain language of the Welfare Reform Act explicitly authorizes the provision of routine\nprenatal care to unqualified aliens or to their fetuses.\n[25] Citing the Second Circuit's reasoning in Lewis IV-A, plaintiffs argue that this Circuit has previously rejected\nthe argument that Congress' explicit solicitude for the health of children in one part of a statute can be used as a\ntool to limit benefits for children in another part of the statute where there is no explicit language imposing such\nlimits. Plaintiffs specifically note the Second Circuit's finding in Lewis IV-A that the inclusion of an explicit\nexception for Medicaid-sponsored prenatal care in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (\"IRCA\") did\nnot demonstrate Congress' intent to restrict eligibility for prenatal care in OBRA '86. See Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at\n1218. Plaintiffs also cite the Second Circuit's rejection of the Secretary's argument that Congress' inclusion of an\nexpress exception for emergency labor and delivery in OBRA '86 meant that labor and delivery were the only\ntype of prenatal care that Congress wished to extend to aliens. The Second Circuit instead found that any\npossible redundancy in the coverage was \"consistent with Congress's desire to insure that children do not slip\nthrough the cracks of prenatal care.\" Id.\n[26]Douglas did not expressly address the issue of alien eligibility for prenatal care under OBRA '86. Instead, the\nSixth Circuit in Douglas considered whether the district court had erred in finding that the plaintiff was ineligible\nfor Medicaid prenatal and postpartum medical benefits on the ground that she failed to cooperate, without good\ncause, in establishing the paternity of her oldest child and assigning his rights to support, as required by § 1396k\nof the Medicaid statute. The Sixth Circuit and the district court both found that the plain language of § 1396k\nprecluded Douglas from receiving Medicaid prenatal and postpartum benefits. Douglas, however, argued that,\neven if the plain language of the statute rendered her ineligible for those benefits, she should nevertheless\nreceive the benefits because such a reading would frustrate Congress' intent to provide comprehensive Medicaid\nprenatal care benefits for low-income women. Relying in part on the Second Circuit's decision in Lewis IV-A,\nDouglas urged the Sixth Circuit to focus on the \"fundamental congressional goal of promoting prenatal care for\nlow-income women.\" Douglas, 990 F.2d at 877-78. The Sixth Circuit rejected this argument, noting its\n\"fundamental concerns with the reasoning in Lewis.\" Id. at 881.\n[28] The plaintiff class in this action, as it is currently defined, includes \"all aliens residing in New York State who\nhave applied or attempted to apply for Medicaid benefits but have been or would be denied on the basis of their\nalienage.\" Lewis I, 663 F.Supp. at 1170-71. The plaintiff class, thus, is not limited to alien women who are\npregnant, and this Court may, accordingly, assume that a substantial number of these women have given birth to\ntheir children in the United States.\n[29] Section 1396a(e)(4) provides, in pertinent part: \nA child born to a woman eligible for and receiving medical assistance under a State plan on the date of the child's\nbirth shall be deemed to have applied for medical assistance and to have been found eligible for such assistance\nunder such plan on the date of such birth and to remain eligible for such assistance for a period of one year so\nlong as the child is a member of the woman's household and the woman remains (or would remain if pregnant)\neligible for such assistance.\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(e)(4); see also 42 C.F.R. § 435.117 (\"The agency must provide categorically needy Medicaid\neligibility to a child born to a woman who is eligible as categorically needy and is receiving Medicaid on the date\nof the child's birth. The child is deemed to have applied and been found eligible for Medicaid on the date of birth\nand remains eligible as categorically needy for one year so long as the woman remains eligible as categorically\nneedy and the child is a member of the woman's household.\").\n[30] This \"anomaly\" in the Medicaid statutory scheme was noted by the Second Circuit in Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at\n1217-18 (\"Further, construing OBRA '86 to terminate prenatal care for non-PRUCOL pregnant women creates an\n\nanomaly in another section of the statute.\"). The statutory and regulatory provisions regarding automatic eligibility\nfor newborn children remain essentially unchanged since the date of the Second Circuit's decision in Lewis IV-A.\n[31] In Lewis IV-A, the Second Circuit also noted the possibility that the citizen children of the plaintiff class could\nassert such an equal protection claim. See Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1217 (\"Such discrimination against the citizen\nchild on the basis of the alien status of the parent would raise serious equal protection questions.\").\n[32] Despite the recent legislative shift from a fetal-centered to a maternal-centered approach in the provision of\nprenatal care, see Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1208-11, it is clear that prenatal care is principally designed to ensure\nthe health of the child at its birth and thereafter. Cf. Lewis IV-A, 965 F.2d at 1218 (\"[P]renatal care principally\nbenefits the fetus.\").\n[33] A possibility made cruelly and ironically more likely if the mother is denied prenatal care.\n[34] A complex but ultimately unnecessary argument may be made that the citizen children may not only assert\nclaims based on the fact that they will be denied Medicaid coverage at birth for no reason except their mother's\nalienage but that they may also assert claims based on the disparate treatment of their mothers prior to their birth\nwhich resulted in birth defects and other disabilities to them, the children. In Crumpton v. Gates, 947 F.2d 1418,\n1422-23 (9th Cir.1991), the Ninth Circuit held that a child could maintain an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for\nunwarranted interference with his rights to familial companionship and society based upon the Los Angeles\nPolice Department's allegedly unlawful killing of his father when he was a two-month-old fetus en ventre sa mere.\nSee id. at 1423. But see Ruiz Romero v. Gonzalez Caraballo, 681 F.Supp. 123, 125-26 (D.P.R.1988) (fetus is not\na \"person\" for § 1983 purposes and, thus, may not maintain § 1983 suit for injuries sustained en ventre sa mere\nas a result of police brutality against mother); Harman v. Daniels, 525 F.Supp. 798, 800-01 (W.D.Va. 1981)\n(same). The Ninth Circuit reasoned that, because Crumpton was a fetus at the time his father was killed, the\nunwarranted state interference with his right to familial relationships, and his cause of action for that injury arose\nat his birth. See Crumpton, 947 F.2d at 1422.\n[35] There may be some question as to whether the third-party rights of the born citizen children of the members\nof the plaintiff class were sufficiently pleaded in the complaint to justify this Court's attention. Plaintiffs'\nsubmissions in connection with the federal defendant's motion, however, expressly ask this Court to consider the\nharm inflicted upon their citizen children at their birth when determining whether the Secretary's denial of prenatal\ncare violates the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Moreover, the third-party argument follows from\nplaintiffs' reliance on the reasoning of Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982). Since\nboth sides have now recognized that the issue is now in litigation and have fully addressed the merits, it is,\naccordingly, appropriate to consider the third-party rights of the citizen children of the members of the plaintiff\nclass. Cf. Irving v. Clark, 758 F.2d 1260, 1267 n. 11 (1985),aff'd sub nom. Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 107\nS.Ct. 2076, 95 L.Ed.2d 668 (1987).\n[36] Both Amendments essentially require that persons similarly situated be treated alike. See, e.g., F.S. Royster\nGuano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415, 40 S.Ct. 560, 64 L.Ed. 989 (1920).\n[37] Because it is well established that no individual, whether citizen or alien, has a fundamental right to federal\npublic welfare benefits, plaintiffs do not suggest 00 nor could they successfully 00 that strict scrutiny of the\n97 97\nlegislative classification is warranted because the statute interferes with a fundamental right. See Weinberger v.\nSalfi, 422 U.S. 749, 768-70, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975); Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct.\n1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970).\n[38] Judge Kaplan's opinion in Abreu v. Callahan, 971 F.Supp. 799, 808-12 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), provides an excellent\nsummary of the plenary immigration power and judicial treatment of alienage classifications.\n[39] The Supreme Court has acknowledged that federal authority to regulate the status of aliens derives from\nvarious sources, including the federal government's power \"[t]o establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization,\" U.S.\nConst. Art. I, § 8, cl. 4, its power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,\" id. cl. 3, and its broad authority\nover foreign affairs, see Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 588-89, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952)\n(\"[A]ny policy toward aliens is vitally and intricately interwoven with contemporaneous policies in regard to the\n\nconduct of foreign relations, the war power, and the maintenance of a republican form of government.\"). See\ngenerally Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 10, 102 S.Ct. 2977, 73 L.Ed.2d 563 (1982).\n[40] While the Court on occasion has evidenced discomfort with its sweeping terms, the Court has continued to\nascribe undiminished validity to the plenary power doctrine. Writing for the Court in Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S.\n522, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911 (1954), Justice Frankfurter noted that \"much could be said for the view, were we\nwriting on a clean slate,\" that the Due Process Clause places some limitations on congressional power in the\nimmigration area. Id. at 530-31, 74 S.Ct. 737. Nevertheless, he went on to state: \nBut the slate is not clean. As to the extent of the power of Congress under review, there is not merely `a page of\nhistory,' ... but a whole volume. Policies pertaining to the entry of aliens and their right to remain here are\npeculiarly concerned with the political conduct of government. In the enforcement of these policies, the Executive\nBranch of the Government must respect the procedural safeguards of due process.... But that the formulation of\nthese policies is entrusted exclusively to Congress has become about as firmly embedded in the legislative and\njudicial tissues of our body politic as any aspect of our government....\nWe are not prepared to deem ourselves wiser or more sensitive to human rights than our predecessors,\nespecially those who have been most zealous in protecting civil liberties under the Constitution and must\ntherefore under our constitutional system recognize congressional power in dealing with aliens....\nId. at 531-32, 74 S.Ct. 737; see also Fiallo, 430 U.S. at 792 n. 4, 97 S.Ct. 1473 (\"We are no more inclined to\nreconsider this line of cases today than we were five years ago when we decided Kleindienst v.

See Mathews, 426 U.S. at 70 n. 1, 96 S.Ct. 1883 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1395k (1970 ed. & Supp. IV)).\nThe program supplements the Medicare Part A hospital insurance plan, §§ 1811 et seq. of the Social Security Act\nof 1935, 49 Stat. 620, as added 79 Stat. 291, and as amended 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395c et seq. (1970 ed. & Supp. IV).\nSee Mathews, 426 U.S. at 70 n. 1, 96 S.Ct. 1883.\n[43] Section 402 provides that an alien who is a \"qualified alien,\" as defined in 8 U.S.C. § 1641, is not eligible for\nthe following federal programs, with certain limited exceptions: (1) the Supplemental Security Income program\n(\"SSI\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1381 et seq. (providing income assistance for individuals who are 65 years or older or are\nblind or disabled); (2) the Food Stamp Program, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2011 et seq. (providing coupons to purchase food to\neligible households in order to help establish and maintain adequate levels of nutrition); (3) the Temporary\nAssistance for Needy Families program (\"TANF\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 601 et seq. (permitting, as successor to the\nAFDC program, the states to provide time-limited assistance to qualifying families); (4) the Medicaid program, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq.; and (5) the Social Services Block Grant program (\"SSBG\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1397 et seq.\n(providing consolidated funds to the states to forward their policy goals, such as the prevention of dependency,\nneglect, abuse, and exploitation of children and adults, and inappropriate institutional care). See Welfare Reform\nAct § 402(a)(1), (3); 8 U.S.C. § 1612(a)(1), (3). Section 402(a)(2) provides that certain qualified aliens remain\neligible for these federal programs, including the following groups: (i) refugees; (ii) asylees; (iii) certain aliens who\nhave had their deportation withheld; (iv) aliens who were granted status as Cuban or Haitian entrants; (v) certain\nAmerasians; (vi) lawful permanent resident aliens who have worked 40 qualifying quarters; and (vii) legal aliens\nwho were honorably discharged or are on active duty with the Armed Forces. See Welfare Reform Act § 402(a)\n(2); 8 U.S.C. § 1612(a)(2). In addition, through recent amendments to the Welfare Reform Act, Congress\nprovided that certain qualified aliens remain eligible for Social Security benefits alone, including the following\ngroups: (1) legal aliens receiving SSI benefits on August 22, 1996; (2) blind or disabled aliens lawfully residing in\nthe United States on August 22, 1996; (3) certain American Indians; (4) certain SSI beneficiaries who are\nreceiving benefits pursuant to applications that were filed before January 1, 1979; (5) aliens who on August 22,\n\n1996, were lawfully residing in the United States and were sixty-five years or older; (6) aliens who are minor\nchildren and who were lawfully residing in the United States on August 22, 1996; and (7) certain Hmong and\nHighland Laotians.

Plyler, 457 U.S. at 220, 102 S.Ct. 2382 (\"At the least, those who elect to enter our territory by stealth and\nin violation of our law should be prepared to bear the consequences, including, but not limited to, deportation.

July 22, 1986), aff'd on other grounds,830 F.2d\n1441 (7th Cir.1987), the district court considered whether the State of Wisconsin, pursuant to a policy\npromulgated by the Secretary, could deny AFDC benefits to otherwise eligible citizen children because the\nfamily's primary wage earner was an illegal alien. When considering the claims of the members of the plaintiff\nclass of citizen children that the denial of AFDC benefits violated their Fifth Amendment equal protection rights,\nthe district court in Reivitz applied a heightened or intermediate level of scrutiny under the rationale of Plyler. The\ndistrict court reasoned that classification drawn by the Secretary's policy discriminated against a class of innocent\n\ncitizen children on the sole basis of the unlawful immigration status of their parents and, thus, under the standard\nset forth in Plyler could not be considered rational unless it furthers some substantial goal of the state. Applying\nsuch a heightened standard of review, the district court in Reivitz found that the federal and state defendants had\nfailed to articulate such a substantial governmental objective which the classification was intended to further and\nrejected the proposed justifications of discouraging illegal immigration, discouraging the employment of illegal\naliens, and discouraging welfare dependency. The district court noted the federal plenary power over\nimmigration, but found it inapplicable because the legislation at issue was \"social welfare legislation, not an\nimmigration law\" and because the \"class directly affected by the classification is not a class of illegal aliens, but a\nclass of otherwise eligible citizens.\" Reivitz, slip. op. at 12. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district\ncourt's decision on statutory grounds and declined to address the portion of the district court's decision which\nheld that the denial of AFDC benefits to otherwise eligible citizen children on the basis of their parents'\nimmigration status violated the children's equal protection rights. See Doe v. Reivitz, 830 F.2d 1441, 1442 (7th\nCir.1987),as amended, 842 F.2d 194 (7th Cir. 1988).\n[52] Unlike the plaintiffs in Fiallo, the citizen children of the members of the plaintiff class do not argue that the\nfederal immigration statutes grant them any fundamental rights. Instead, they seek to assert their clearly\nestablished right to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court's decision in Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 96 S.Ct. 1895, 48 L.Ed.2d\n495 (1976), suggests that there are some limits on the federal plenary power over immigration. See id. at 103, 96\nS.Ct. 1895 (because Civil Service Commission regulation deprived aliens of a liberty interest, \"some judicial\nscrutiny of the deprivation is mandated by the Constitution.\").\n[53]But see Doe v. Wilson, No. C-97-2427, 1997 WL 811788, at *2 (N.D.Cal. Dec. 16, 1997) (noting, in the\ncontext of a challenge by a plaintiff class of immigrant women deemed ineligible for state-funded non-emergency\nprenatal care pursuant to Section 411(a) of the Welfare Reform Act to the constitutionality of Section 411(d) of\nthe Welfare Reform Act, which allows states to override the alienage restriction in Section 411(a), that \"plaintiffs\ndo not challenge the constitutionality of section 411(a) [and] indeed, ... concede that under Congress' plenary\npower to regulate immigration, Congress could have chosen to prohibit the states entirely from providing benefits\nto undocumented immigrants,\" including state-sponsored non-emergency prenatal care).\n[54]\nThe federal defendant argues that plaintiffs may not base their constitutional challenge to the Welfare Reform Act\non harm that is caused to another. As discussed above, however, the equal protection claims raised by plaintiffs\non their own behalf and on behalf of their born citizen children are based upon the concrete injuries suffered by\nthe members of the plaintiff class and by their born citizen children. Because plaintiffs have standing to bring an\nequal protection claim on their own behalf and have third-party standing to bring an equal protection claim on\nbehalf of their born citizen children, this Court may consider the wider impact of the harm caused by the\nSecretary's denial of Medicaid benefits for routine prenatal care. \nThe Supreme Court has considered the harm inflicted upon parties not before the court when considering equal\nprotection challenges. In Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 651-52, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975),\nthe Court considered a father's claim that a provision of the Social Security Act that allowed mothers, but not\nfathers, with dependent children to recover social security survivors benefits violated his Fifth Amendment right to\nequal protection. The Court first found that Congress' purpose in providing survivorship benefits was to permit the\nsurviving parent to remain at home to care for any minor children. Given that purpose, the Court found that\ngender-based distinction of the statutory provision was \"entirely irrational\" because the \"classification\ndiscriminates among surviving children solely on the basis of the sex of the surviving parent.\" Id. at 650, 95 S.Ct.\n1225. The Court went on to find that \"[i]t is no less important for a child to be cared for by its sole surviving parent\nwhen that parent is male rather than female.\" Id. Thus, in considering the provision's rationality, the Court\nconsidered the interests of individuals who were not before the court but who were the intended beneficiaries of\nthe statute. Similarly, in Plyler, the Court considered the costs to the nation when determining the rationality of the\nTexas statute at issue. Plyler, 457 U.S. at 223-24, 102 S.Ct. 2382. The Court first found that in addition to\nbenefitting the individual student, public education \"has a fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our\nsociety\" and \"our basic institutions.\" Id. at 221, 102 S.Ct. 2382. (\"We have recognized `the public schools as a\n\nmost vital civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of government'\"). Because of \"the pivotal\nrole of education\" in our society, the Court stated \"[w]e cannot ignore the significant social costs borne by our\nNation when select groups are denied the means to absorb the values and skills upon which our social order\nrests.\" Id.\nHere, the provision of routine prenatal care is vital to ensuring the health of children in this country. Although\nprenatal care is provided through the mother, it is clear that prenatal care is provided principally for the benefit of\nthe fetus. It is beyond dispute that the denial of routine prenatal care will result in increased rates of infant\nmortality and low birth weight, as well as increased likelihood of other severe birth defects. The nation will be\nforced to bear the significant medical costs of caring for these citizen children after their birth. (Minkoff Aff. ¶ 38.)\nMoreover, of those children who survive, many will be denied the opportunity to lead productive or fulfilling lives in\nthis country as a result of handicaps related to the birth defects they will sustain and, as a result, will be forced to\ndepend upon a variety of social welfare programs. The cost to the nation of denying Medicaid benefits for routine\nprenatal care, thus, are substantial and beyond dispute. Accordingly, following the reasoning of Weinberger and \nPlyler, this Court may take those costs into account when considering plaintiffs' constitutional challenges.\n[55] In Lewis IV, I cited the findings of sociologist William Julius Wilson in support of this point. See Lewis IV, 794\nF.Supp. at 1202-03. Wilson has noted: \nFor the overwhelmingly female-headed ghetto underclass families, access to quality child care becomes a critical\nissue if steps are taken to move single mothers into education and training programs and/or full- or part-time\nemployment.\nW.J. Wilson, The Truly Disadvantaged, 153-54 (1987). If the care of healthy children can create such obstacles to\nemployment for these women, care of children handicapped as a result of birth defects will only compound the\nproblem:\n[A]s long as some poor families are unable to work because of physical or other disabilities, public assistance\nwould be needed even if the government adopted a program of welfare reform that included child support\nenforcement and family allowance provisions.\nId. at 154.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The matter is\nbefore the Court on the federal defendants' motion for reconsideration of this Court's decision in Lewis v. Gross,\n[1]\n663 F.Supp. 1164 (E.D.N.Y. 1986), granting summary judgment on behalf of the plaintiff class.\nThe facts in this case have been recently recited by the Court in its decision dated March 5, 1987, covering\nplaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. See Lewis v. Grinker, No. 79-1740 (E.D.N.Y. March 5, 1987)\n[Available on WESTLAW, DCT data-base]. Therefore, only the following brief restatement is necessary for\npurposes of the present motion.\nOn July 14, 1986, this Court issued a Memorandum and Order which, among other things, determined that a\n1973 regulation of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the \"Secretary\"), 42 C.F.R. § 435.402(b),\nestablishing alienage requirements for medical eligibility, was not authorized under the Medicaid statute, 42\n[2]\nU.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq.  Before final judgment was entered on that decision, however, Congress passed the\nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (\"OBRA\"), Pub.L. No. 99-509, reprinted in U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.\nNews (100 Stat. 1874) (Dec. 1986), which contained new provisions concerning the eligibility of aliens for\n[3]\nMedicaid benefits.  Section 9406 of OBRA has a direct impact on the Court's earlier decision since it provides\nstatutory authority for imposing alienage restrictions on Medicaid eligibility for non-emergency medical care.\nUnder the new law, eligibility for Medicaid is restricted to aliens who are either lawful permanent residents or\notherwise permanently residing in this country under color of law, except where the alien is otherwise qualified for\nMedicaid and has an emergency medical condition.\nFollowing the Court's invitation to brief the effects of this new legislation on the resolution of this case, the\nSecretary brought the present motion to vacate this Court's July 14 decision. First, the Secretary argues that no\ninjunctive or other prospective relief should be granted because the OBRA amendments explicitly authorize the\nstandard contained in the Secretary's challenged regulation. Second, the Secretary seeks to be relieved from any\npotential retroactive damage award on the ground that the legislation ratified the Secretary's prior use of alienage\nrequirements. For the reasons set forth below, the Secretary's first request is granted and the second request is\ndenied.\n\n171 Relying on the doctrine that a court is bound to apply the law in effect at the *171 time of rendering its decision, \nsee, e.g., Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 711-16, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016-18, 40\nL.Ed.2d 476 (1974), the Secretary argues that the Court should refrain from entering any final judgment enjoining\nenforcement of 42 C.F.R. § 435.402(b), since the regulation's language now appears verbatim in § 9406(a) of\nOBRA. In response, plaintiffs concede that § 9406(a) applies prospectively as of its effective date of January 1,\n1987. Since the language of § 435.402(b) does not preclude the coverage for emergency care provided in § 9406\nand since the Secretary's new Medicaid manual explicitly provides for such care, see Lewis v. Grinker, supra, slip\nop. at 5-7, 28-32 (March 5, 1987), it is clear that a final judgment ought not enjoin future enforcement of 42 C.F.R.\n[4]\n§ 435.402(b).\nThe question remains, however, what effect the OBRA amendments have on Medicaid eligibility prior to January\n1, 1987. The Secretary argues that no relief should be awarded for any period before January 1, 1987, on the\nground that Congress ratified the Secretary's prior use of alien restrictions when it passed the OBRA\namendments. In essence, the Secretary's position is that, when Congress passed OBRA, it only intended to\nexpand Medicaid coverage by providing coverage for emergency care and assumed that alienage restrictions\nwere already in place by virtue of 42 C.F.R. § 435.402(b). In response, plaintiffs characterize the OBRA\namendments as explicitly rejecting any alienage requirements for emergency care while for the first time\nauthorizing restrictions based on alienage for non-emergency care. Plaintiffs contend that the Secretary is\nseeking retroactive application of OBRA since the amendment did not go into effect until January 1, 1987.\nAlthough the Secretary contends that he does not seek retroactive application of OBRA, it may be useful to\ndiscuss the Secretary's argument in the context of the case law on retroactivity. In Bennett v. New Jersey, 470\nU.S. 632, 105 S.Ct. 1555, 84 L.Ed.2d 572 (1985), a case cited by none of the parties, the Supreme Court made\nclear that, when, as here, legislation affects substantive rights, Bradley does not impose a presumption in favor of\nretroactive application of the statute. Bennett involved the question of whether substantive provisions of the 1978\namendments to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act should apply retroactively in determining\nwhether Title I funds were misused during the years 1970-1972. New Jersey sought retroactive application of the\nmore liberal eligibility criteria contained in the 1978 amendments, and the Third Circuit, relying on Bradley,\ngranted such relief. State of New Jersey Dept. of Ed. v. Hufstedler, 724 F.2d 34 (3d Cir.1984). In reversing the\nCourt of Appeals, the Supreme Court looked to both the substantive nature of the obligations involved and the\n\"manifest injustice\" exception contained in Bradley itself. The Court explained:\n\"[T]he presumption announced in Bradley does not apply here. Bradley held that a statutory\nprovision for attorneys fees applied retroactively to a fee request that was pending when that\nstatute was enacted. This holding rested on the general principle that a court must apply the law in\neffect at the time of the decision ... which Bradley concluded holds true even if the intervening law\ndoes not expressly state that it applied to pending cases.... Bradley, however, expressly\nacknowledged limits to this principle. `The Court has refused to apply an intervening change to a\npending action where it has concluded that to do so would infringe upon or deprive a person of a\nright that has matured or become unconditional.' .... This limitation comports with another\nvenerable rule of statutory interpretation, i.e, that statutes affecting substantive rights and liabilities\nare presumed to have prospective effect.\"\n172 105 S.Ct. 1560,quoting Bradley, 416 U.S. at 720, 94 S.Ct. at 2020. The Court then *172 concluded that, absent a\nclear indication to the contrary in the relevant statutes or legislative history, changes affecting substantive rights\nand liabilities under federal grant programs are presumed to have only prospective effect. Id.105 S.Ct. at 1561.\nIn the present case, the Secretary does not suggest that Congress expressed an intent to apply OBRA\nretroactively, but rather argues that Congress intended the January 1, 1987 effective date to apply only to those\nprovisions providing emergency medical care for otherwise eligible persons. As for the other provisions restricting\neligibility of aliens, the Secretary contends that Congress intended to ratify the regulations struck down by this\nCourt in its July 14 decision. To support this claim, the Secretary relies on the following language in § 9406(c)(1):\n\n\"Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amendments made by this section shall apply to\nmedical assistance furnished to aliens on or after January 1, 1987, without regard to whether or\nnot final regulations to carry out such amendments have been promulgated by such date.\"\nAccording to the Secretary, use of the phrase \"without regard to whether or not final regulations ... have been\npromulgated\" indicates Congress' concern that there might not be regulations in place implementing those\nportions of the amendments that \"expand\" Medicaid to cover emergency medical conditions by the time such\ncoverage became effective. With respect to the alienage restrictions, however, the Secretary argues that there\nwas no need for such concern since 42 C.F.R. § 435.402(b) was already promulgated when § 9406 was passed.\nThe Secretary's argument cannot be sustained for several reasons. First, the language upon which the Secretary\nrelies expressly states that the \"amendments made by this section\" shall go into effect on January 1, 1987.\nCongress' use of the plural strongly suggests that it intended the entire section to go into effect on January 1,\n1987. But more importantly, the Conference Committee report clearly indicates that, when Congress passed the\nOBRA amendment, it was acting in direct response to the decision of this Court striking down 42 C.F.R. §\n435.402(b). See H.R. Conf.Rep. No. 1012, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 399, reprinted in U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.\nNews 1986, pp. 3607, 4044 (Dec. 1986).\nThus, notwithstanding the fact that this Court's order has not yet been reduced to judgment, Congress clearly\nassumed that 42 C.F.R. § 435.402(b) was no longer in effect when it passed the OBRA amendments.\nAccordingly, the only plausible explanation for the language in § 9406(c)(1) is Congress' concern that all of the\nnew statutory provisions, those relating to both emergency and non-emergency care, would go into effect\nwhether or not implementing regulations had been promulgated. Since it is clear that Congress intended all of §\n9406 to go into effect on January 1, 1987, and there being no indication that Congress intended any of the\n[5]\nprovisions to have retroactive application , the Bennett presumption in favor of prospective application applies.\nThe Secretary, however, further argues that the OBRA amendments reflect Congress' attempt to \"clarify\" existing\nlaw and thereby serve to ratify his prior use of alienage restrictions. See, e.g., Barnes v. Cohen, 749 F.2d 1009,\n1015 (3d Cir.1984); Brown v. Marquett Savings & Loan Ass'n, 686 F.2d 608, 615 (7th Cir.1982); United States v.\nTapert, 625 F.2d 111, 121 (6th Cir.1980). To support this claim, the Secretary relies on the language of the\nConference Committee cited above as well as statements in the House Budget Committee report on H.R. 5300,\nwhich, except for the provisions for emergency care, provide the basis for the OBRA amendments. Following a\n173 discussion of this Court's July 14 decision identical to the one cited above *173 from the Conference Committee\nreport, the Budget Committee report states:\n\"In response to the Court's invitation to clarify Congressional intent, the Committee bill amends the\nMedicaid statute to make it explicit that Federal financial participation is not available for State\nexpenditures for aliens who are not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or permanently\nresiding in the U.S. under color of law. The bill also provides that nothing in the Medicaid title\nshould be construed to require a State plan to offer coverage to aliens who are not lawfully\nadmitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the U.S. under color of\nlaw. The Committee intends that the Secretary and the States broadly interpret the phrase `under\ncolor of law' to include all of the categories recognized by immigration law, policy and practice in\neffect at the time, including Cuban-Haitian entrants (as defined in paragraph 1 or 2A of section\n591(e) of Public Law 96-422, as in effect on April 1, 1983).\"\nH.R.Rep. No. 727, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 110-11, reprinted in U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1986, pp. 3607,\n3700-01 (Dec. 1986).\nIt is clear that Congress passed the OBRA amendments in response to this Court's ruling that the Secretary's\nregulation had no statutory basis. It is equally clear, however, that, when Congress made explicit its intent, it\nproduced a statute that provides significantly greater coverage than had been provided to the plaintiff class\nmembers by the Secretary's regulation. Indeed, the provision for emergency medical care, in this Court's view,\nindicates that not only did Congress fail to ratify the Secretary's prior position but, to a large degree, repudiated\nthe regulation.\n\nThe view is supported by the bill's evolution through the House and Senate. As noted above, the House version\nof the bill restricted Medicaid eligibility to those aliens who are legal permanent residents or otherwise\npermanently residing in this country under color of law (\"PRUCL\"). The Committee Report also specifically stated\nthat it intended the Secretary to interpret \"under color of law\" broadly to include all of the categories recognized\nby immigration law, policy and practice. H.Rep. No. 727, supra at 111, U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1986, p.\n3701. The Senate version of the bill contained no provision restricting alien eligibility for Medicaid. The\nConference Committee retained the House version but added the substantial modification providing for Medicaid\nreimbursement for emergency services, regardless of alien status. Thus, the final bill represents a compromise\nbetween what was in essence the Secretary's prior position and no alienage requirements at all. Thus, contrary to\nthe Secretary's position, the legislative history cannot properly be read as a ratification of his prior position.\nMoreover, the cases cited by the Secretary are inapposite to the present circumstances. In each of those cases,\nthe court held that, when an existing statute is ambiguous or has been subject to conflicting interpretations, it is\ngenerally fair to assume that Congress intended to clarify the existing law, as opposed to creating new law (and\n[6]\nby implication rejecting prior law). See Barnes, supra, 749 F.2d at 1015; Tapert, supra, 625 F.2d at 120-21.\nHere, however, there was no pre-existing statute which even arguably authorized the Secretary's disputed\nregulation. To ratify such unauthorized administrative action, the \"ratifying legislation must recognize that the\nactions involved were unauthorized when taken and must also expressly ratify those actions in clear and\nunequivocal language.\" EEOC v. CBS, 743 F.2d 969, 974 (2d Cir.1984). While Congress has done the former,\n174 the legislation's substantive provisions and prospective application make clear that it has not done the latter. *174\nAccordingly, the Secretary's motion to vacate this Court's earlier decision with respect to the availability to\n[7]\nplaintiffs of retroactive relief for actions taken by the Secretary prior to January 1, 1987, is denied.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Since no final judgment has been entered in this case, the decision whether or not to reconsider a non-final\norder is within the plenary power of this Court. See Campos v. Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co., 536 F.2d 970, 972 n. 6\n(1st Cir. 1976); 7 J. Moore, Federal Practice ¶ 60.20.\n[2] The decision also partially invalidated the companion New York State regulation, 18 NYCRR § 349.3.\n[3] New provisions concerning Medicaid eligibility of aliens were also included in the Immigration Control and\nReform Act of 1986 (\"ICRA\"), Pub.L. No. 99-603, reprinted in U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News (100 Stat. 3359)\n(Dec. 1986). The ICRA amendments, however, do not have an immediate impact on the Court's prior decision\nand do not form the basis for the Secretary's present motion.\n[4] Of course at sometime in the future, the Secretary will have to promulgate new regulations implementing its\nobligation to provide emergency medical care to all eligible persons regardless of their alien status.\n[5]\nAn additional indication that Congress did not intend to apply the amendments retroactively can be drawn from\nthe fact that Congress delayed the effective date of the legislation by several months. See Yakima Valley\nCablevision, Inc. v. FCC, 794 F.2d 737, 747 (D.C. Cir.1986); Fitzgerald v. Century Park, Inc., 642 F.2d 356,\n358-59 (9th Cir.1981); Buccino v. Continental Assurance Co., 578 F.Supp. 1518, 1527 (S.D.N.Y. 1983).\n[6] The theory behind the latter presumption is that Congress only acts with a purpose. See 2A C. Sands, \nSutherland Statutory Construction ¶ 49.11, at 265-66. The fact that both interpretations can be argued has led\ncourts to recognize that \"the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent on\nan earlier one.\" Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 26, 104 S.Ct. 296, 302, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983).\n[7] In reaching this decision, the Court expresses no opinion on plaintiffs' entitlement to retroactive monetary\nrelief. This question, which raises substantial eleventh amendment issues, has yet to be fully briefed by the\nparties.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Maloney, U.S. Atty., E.D.N.Y. by Charles Kleinberg, Brooklyn, N.Y., for Federal defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nSIFTON, District Judge.\nThis class action is brought by Lydia Lewis and eight other named class representatives against the defendants,\nseeking a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment authorizing the payment of Medicaid benefits to \"non-\nlegal permanent resident\" (\"non-LPR\") aliens in New York State. The matter is before the Court on the following\nmotions: (1) the federal government's motion to decertify the class under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, (2) plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint and modify the class definition, and (3) the motion of five\naliens to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2) and be designated additional class representatives.\nClass Decertification and Modification Motions\nThe plaintiff class in this case is drawn from a pool of individuals who live in New York State and who are\ncolloquially referred to as \"illegal aliens.\" More accurately, these individuals are those who have not been granted\nlegal permanent resident status, i.e., they have no \"green card,\" granted according to the standards of the\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\"), although they have, for all practical purposes, established\npermanent residence in this country. According to the 1980 census, the number of such non-LPR aliens in New\nYork State is estimated at 234,000. Although the majority of non-LPR aliens nationwide are said to have originally\ncome from Mexico, those living in New York State are said to come from many different parts of the world.\nAccording to plaintiffs, most of them now live in New York City. Plaintiffs offer an astounding general description\nof the group's immigration statuses. Over 77% of the New York State non-LPR aliens counted in the 1980 census\nhad been in the country for more than five years and over 44% had been here for more than ten years. In\naddition, unlike those in the southern or western parts of the country, the non-LPR aliens in New York State are\nsaid to be more likely to be persons who entered with visas and were therefore inspected by INS before entering\nthe United States. Many non-LPR aliens are said to be employed as food processors, dishwashers, hospital aids\nand in other occupations involved in delivery or handling of food. The non-LPR alien population is generally\ncomprised of young adults under 35 years old. Many non-LPR aliens in New York have close U.S. citizen or legal\npermanent resident relatives including spouses, children, siblings, and parents and many are in the process of\napplying for legal permanent resident status.\n\nNine New York non-LPR aliens supposedly in need of medical care and Medicaid assistance brought the instant\naction. They were originally certified by the court as a plaintiff class on January 16, 1981, (Weinstein, Ch.J.) as\n\"all aliens residing in the State of New York who have been denied Medicaid on the basis of their alienage.\" By\norder of October 15, 1981, the class definition was modified to add the requirement that the aliens qualifying for\nthe class be living in New York \"under color of law.\" The class was thus redefined to include \"all aliens residing in\nNew York State under color of law who have applied or attempted to apply for Medicaid benefits.\" Presumably,\nthis definition also carried over from the previous class definition the requirement that plaintiffs \"have been denied\nMedicaid on the basis of their alienage.\" This requirement, however, should be coordinated with the expansion of\nthe definition to include not only actual Medicaid applicants but also those who \"have attempted to apply\" and\nwho \"have been or would be denied Medicaid on the basis of their alienage.\" Thus, the full class definition would\ninclude \"all aliens residing in New York State under color of law who have applied or attempted to apply for\n1167 Medicaid but have been or would be *1167 denied Medicaid on the basis of their alienage.\"\nPlaintiffs claim that they consented to the 1981 modification of the class definition to include the \"under color of\nlaw\" requirement because of their \"initial misreading\" of the new amendments to the Medicaid statute enacted in\nthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, Pub.L. No. 87-35. They now seek to amend the class definition to delete\nthis under color of law requirement. None of the defendants has opposed the motion, but the federal defendant\nhas instead filed the instant motion to narrow the class definition or decertify the class altogether pursuant to Rule\n23(c)(1).\nThe Secretary first argues for decertification because the minimum requirements for the maintenance of the suit\nas a class action have not been satisfied, as set forth in Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The\nSecretary appears to be arguing that the first three of these requirements, numerosity of class members,\ncommonality, and typicality of claims, have not been satisfied. An examination of the claims of the named\nplaintiffs and those of the named class, however, suggests otherwise.\nAccording to the Secretary, the claims of the named plaintiffs are not typical of and do not raise issues of law or\nfact common to the class because there are numerous types of immigration status that are not represented\namong the named plaintiffs. Specifically, no named plaintiff has filed for an application for permanent resident\nstatus at a U.S. consular office abroad, had approved an application for permanent resident status at a U.S.\nconsular office abroad, applied for an adjustment of status, been granted an adjustment of status, is eligible for\n\"registry\" status because of continuous residence in the United States since before June 30, 1948, received\ndeferred action status, resided in the United States under an INS order of supervision, resided in the United\nStates under an INS grant of voluntary departure, had a visa extended for medical reasons, had a private bill\nintroduced on his behalf in Congress, had a private bill passed on his or her behalf in Congress, been paroled\ninto the United States, been admitted as a \"conditional entrant\" into the United States, been granted refugee\nstatus, applied for asylum, been granted asylum, applied for withholding of deportation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §\n1253(h), been granted withholding of deportation pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1253(h), been allowed to remain in the\nUnited States as a \"Cuban/Haitian entrant (status pending),\" or is a child. Therefore, the argument continues, the\nnamed plaintiffs' claims are neither typical of nor common to those of non-LPR aliens in these categories of\nstatus under our immigration laws.\n[1]\nEven assuming the accuracy of the Secretary's list of unrepresented categories of immigration status,  the\nSecretary's arguments fail because none of the Rule 23(a)(2) prerequisites has been interpreted with the\nnarrowness suggested by the Secretary's argument. The commonality requirement, for example, merely states\nthat there must be \"questions of law or fact common to the class,\" Rule 23(a)(2), and a single issue common to\nall class members is sufficient to satisfy the requirement. In McCoy v. Ithaca Housing Authority, 559 F.Supp.\n1351, 1355 (N.D.N.Y.1983), the court stated that \"it is clear that not all questions of law and fact among the\nputative class must be identical. According to Newburg, `[t]he (a)(2) prerequisite requires only a single issue\ncommon to the class.' 1 H. Newburg, § 1110f at 184.\" The named plaintiffs in the instant case clearly raise more\nthan one significant issue of law common to the whole class: for example (1) whether the Medicaid statute\nauthorizes the alienage restriction imposed by the Secretary's regulation, (2) whether the alienage restriction\n1168 violates the U.S. Constitution, and (3) what is the proper interpretation of the alienage requirement \"permanently \n*1168 residing under color of law.\" Thus, the commonality requirement is satisfied.\n\nThe Rule 23(a)(3) prerequisite of typicality assures that the named representatives' claim raises these common\nquestions on behalf of the class. Zeffiro v. First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, 96 F.R.D. 567, 569\n(E.D.Pa. 1983). A named plaintiff's claim is \"typical\" within the meaning of the rule if it arises from the same\ncourse of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and is based on the same legal theory and\nif his interests are not antagonistic to those of the class. In re Alcoholic Beverages Litigation, 95 F.R.D. 321, 324\n(E.D.N.Y.1982). Most importantly, the Court there noted:\n\"There has been general agreement that the existence of varying fact patterns to support the\nclaims of individual class members does not mandate a finding of a lack of typicality, as long as\nthe claims arise out of the same legal or remedial theory. Since the claims here are based on what\nappears to be the identical theory and since there are no demonstrated antagonistic interests\nbetween the representative parties and the class members, the typicality requirement is satisfied.\"\nId. at 324 (citations omitted), see Calkins v. Blum, 511 F.Supp. 1073 (N.D.N.Y.1981),aff'd, remanded,675 F.2d\n44 (2d Cir.1982).\nThe claims of the named plaintiffs and the class in the present case both rest on identical legal theories. All nine\nnamed plaintiffs and class members were at some time non-LPR aliens unable to pay for necessary medical care\nbut ineligible for Medicaid under the Secretary's regulation. They all base their claim for benefits on the three\nlegal arguments listed above, which supposedly demonstrate the invalidity of the Secretary's alienage restriction.\nFor purposes of the typicality requirement, it is not significant that the named plaintiffs and some class members\nmay have differing immigration status, since all plaintiffs allege that their INS designation improperly prevented\ntheir receiving Medicaid. Under the plaintiffs' first two arguments against the alienage restriction, that it violates\nthe Medicaid statute and the federal constitution, their immigration statuses are irrelevant because they argue\nthat alienage can never ban Medicaid coverage. Under plaintiffs' third argument, that the Secretary's\ninterpretation of the \"permanently residing under color of law\" requirement is arbitrary and capricious, their\ndiffering immigration status is also unimportant because plaintiffs all claim that under established precedents the\nmeaning of the phrase is expansive and elastic enough to include them all. Plaintiffs will not face disagreements\non which immigration designations fit within the meaning of \"under color of law.\" Rather, they all claim that case\nlaw has established that aliens residing under color of law are those residing in New York on a continuing basis\nwith the knowledge and acquiescence of INS.\nFurthermore, plaintiffs argue convincingly that \"the fact that aliens are eligible for multiple alien statuses but apply\nfor those statuses serially gives all aliens an interest in having many alien statuses established as examples of\npermanently residing under color of law for Medicaid eligibility.\" Plaintiffs illustrate the argument with the example\nof Lydia Lewis:\n\"Lydia Lewis' total situation makes her eligible for multiple immigration statuses. She entered the\nU.S. as a child sixteen years ago. She is the wife of a U.S. citizen, the mother of three U.S.\ncitizens, and the daughter of a U.S. citizen. She is eligible for preferential relative status as her\nhusband's wife and her mother's daughter. Her relative petition has been approved and she is\neligible for and an applicant for adjustment of status. As such, she is eligible for voluntary\ndeparture. As an alien living in the U.S. for more than seven years with dependent citizen children,\na citizen spouse and mother, she is a prime candidate for suspension of deportation. She has\nbeen granted employment authorization. Her length of residence and close relationship with U.S.\ncitizens makes her a candidate for deferred action or a lengthy stay of deportation, which can be\n1169 transferred *1169 into an order of supervision. Her eligibility for these statuses gives her a direct\ninterest in having them established as examples of statuses which satisfy Medicaid eligibility\nrequirements. Clearly, her interests are not antagonistic to having these and other statuses\nestablished as examples of permanently residing in the U.S. under color of law.\"\nThus, because the named plaintiffs and the class members all rely on \"identical theor[ies]\" and \"there are no\ndemonstrated antagonistic interests\" between them, In re Alcoholic Beverages Litigation, supra, 95 F.R.D. at 324,\nthe typicality requirement is satisfied.\n\nThe federal defendant also argues that the numerosity requirement has not been satisfied. It argues primarily that\nthe census report upon which plaintiffs rely addresses only the question of how many non-LPR aliens without\ncurrent visas presently live in New York. But it does not show anything, defendant argues, with respect to the\nclass, i.e., aliens permanently residing in New York under color of law who have applied or have attempted to\napply for Medicaid. Thus, the report fails to show, as Rule 23(a)(3) requires, that plaintiffs are so numerous that\njoinder is impractical.\nAgain the federal defendant cites no cases supporting its strict view of the numerosity requirement. It has been\nlong recognized that there is no specific number of class members necessary to sustain a class action, Cypress\nv. Newport News General and Nonsectarian Hospital Ass'n, 375 F.2d 648 (4th Cir.1967); Stoner v. Miller, 377\nF.Supp. 177 (E.D.N.Y.1974), and no precise count of the number of class members is required. In determining\nwhether the numerosity requirement is met, the Court may consider reasonable inferences drawn from the facts. \nSenter v. General Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, 523 (6th Cir.),cert. denied,429 U.S. 870, 97 S.Ct. 182, 60\nL.Ed.2d 150 (1976). Reliance upon such inferences is particularly appropriate when the information about the\nexact numbers is within the defendant's control. Folsam v. Blum, 87 F.R.D. 443 (S.D. N.Y.1980).\nIn the present case plaintiffs allege that they attempted through discovery to get from defendant the number of\nNew York aliens denied Medicaid on the basis of their alien status, but their efforts were unsuccessful. Because\nsuch information is within the control of some of the government defendants and not readily accessible to\nplaintiffs, resort to inferential reasoning is particularly appropriate here.\nPlaintiffs computed their estimate of the size of the class by looking first at the number of New York State\nresidents already receiving Medicaid. According to the 1979-80 report of the New York State Department of\nSocial Services, 1,322,352 people, or 7% of the 17,558,072 residents of the State of New York, already receive\nMedicaid. If this 7% figure is applied to the estimated 234,000 total number of non-LPR aliens in New York, then\nthe class would number approximately 16,380. Even if a more conservative percentage, such as 1% were used\nas an estimate of the proportion of non-LPR aliens who have been or would be denied Medicaid solely on the\nbasis of their alienage, the class would number in the thousands, i.e., 2,340 individuals. These reasonable\nestimates clearly indicate that the plaintiff class is so large that joinder would be impractical.\nIn addition, it should be noted that, by seeking prospective injunctive relief, plaintiffs' action will also involve future\nclass members. Other cases have found that in such situations persons who might be injured in the future are\nincludable in the class. Dixon v. Heckler, 589 F.Supp. 1494, 1511 (S.D.N.Y.1984); Brun v. Bd. of Ed., 84 F.R.D.\n383 (D.Kan.1979). Thus, non-LPR aliens in New York who suffer in the future from their alleged ineligibility for\nMedicaid will be added to the ranks of the plaintiff class. On these facts, then, it can be inferred that the number\nof potential plaintiffs is great enough to make joinder impractical, and the numerosity requirement, like the other\nprerequisites of Rule 23(a), is satisfied.\n1170 *1170 Because all of the Secretary's other arguments pertain to an alleged need to narrow the class definition,\nrather than a need to decertify the class altogether, these other arguments will be considered with plaintiffs'\narguments for amending the class definition. The present class satisfies the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), and the\n[2]\nSecretary's motion to decertify is denied.\nBoth the Secretary and the plaintiffs seek to modify the class definition. As an alternative to an order decertifying\nthe class, the Secretary proposes that its definition be narrowed significantly. Plaintiffs on the other hand have\nmoved pursuant to Rule 15 to amend the complaint so as to broaden the class definition by deleting the \"under\ncolor of law\" requirement that it now includes.\nThe plaintiffs' proposed amended complaint would make two modifications: first, it would add the proposed\nintervenors as named class representatives, and second, it would delete from the class definition the \"under color\nof law\" requirement so that the proposed new class would include \"all aliens residing in New York State who have\nbeen or will be denied Medicaid because of defendant's restrictions on alien eligibility.\"\nThe Supreme Court has established that amendment of the complaint pursuant to Rule 15 is to be liberally\ngranted and that \"this mandate is to be heeded.\" Fonian v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 231, 9\n\nL.Ed.2d 222 (1962); see S.S. Silberblatt Inc. v. East Harlem Pilot Block Building Housing Development Fund Co.,\nInc., 608 F.2d 28 (2d Cir.1979). In this case, this policy comports with Rule 23(c) which provides for the altering or\namending of the class definition before a decision on the merits.\nPlaintiffs correctly assert that amendment is particularly appropriate here so as to make the complaint and the\nclass definition comport with the proof presented and the claims alleged. Under the current class definition, only\nthose aliens residing in New York \"under color of law\" would be included; obviously, non-LPR aliens not residing\nin the state under color of law, i.e., \"illegal aliens,\" would not fit within this description.\nIn the instant litigation, however, plaintiffs seek to challenge not only the Secretary's interpretation of the \"under\ncolor of law\" requirement now included in its Medicaid regulation, but also the inclusion of any alienage\nrestrictions whatsoever. In fact, two of the theories advanced by plaintiffs, both their statutory and constitutional\narguments, assert that it is impermissible for the Secretary to consider alien status at all in determining aliens\nwho would be entitled to benefits if plaintiffs prevail with respect to these latter two arguments \"under color of law\"\nrequirement. In order to open the class to non-LPR or \"illegal\" aliens who are the intended beneficiaries of the\nplaintiffs' statutory and constitutional arguments against the inclusion of any alienage restriction at all, the \"under\ncolor of law\" requirement must be dropped from the class definition. Because leave to amend the complaint is\nappropriate to make it comport with the claims that plaintiffs seek to advance, plaintiffs' motion is granted so as to\ndelete the \"under color of law\" requirement from the class definition.\nIt should be noted that, apart from the under color of law requirement, plaintiffs' proposed definition differs from\nthe current definition in one other respect. Most importantly, plaintiffs' definition excludes the requirement that\nplaintiffs \"have applied or attempted to apply for Medicaid.\" However, plaintiffs have failed to make any\nconvincing showing why this deletion and the other deviations should be incorporated into the class definition.\nAccordingly, it is appropriate to maintain the current definition deleting only the \"under color of law\" requirement\n1171 so that the class will include \"all aliens residing in New York State who have applied or attempted to *1171 apply\nfor Medicaid but have been or would be denied on the basis of their alienage.\"\nThe federal defendant opposes such a definition as overly broad and, as an alternative to decertification, seeks to\nhave the definition narrowed. More specifically, the defendant seeks to have the class definition amended to\ninclude \"only perrons who otherwise reside in New York State and applied or attempted to apply for Medicaid,\nsince the date Lydia Lewis first applied, and would qualify for Medicaid in New York State on the same statutory\nbases as plaintiffs allegedly qualify, but for alleged statutory, regulatory, and policy prohibitions against Medicaid\nbenefits to those: (1) who are the beneficiaries of approved immediate relative petitions; (2) on whose behalf\nimmediate relative petitions have been filed with INS; (3) who are the beneficiaries of approved relative petitions;\n(4) whose applications for stays of deportation have been accepted by INS; (5) who are the beneficiaries of stays\nof deportation; and (6) who have contacted INS by letter seeking deferred action status.\"\nIn support of this proposed definition, the federal defendant relies upon dicta in Smith v. Schweiker, 709 F.2d 777\n(2d Cir. 1983), criticizing the district court's certification of a broadly defined class. The court there stated:\n\"We affirm for lack of jurisdiction. While this disposes of the case, we again `add a word on the\nclass certification.' Mercer v. Birchman, 700 F.2d 828 at 835. Although the complaint attacks\ntermination decisions reached in the absence of evidence of medical improvement, the class\nincludes all recipients who received a notice of termination after June 1979, including persons for\nwhom there was evidence of medical improvement, persons who were terminated on other\ngrounds irrelevant to this case and persons who have since been reinstated. For all we can tell,\nthe vast preponderance of the class certified is simply not affected by the legal issue plaintiffs\nseek to raise. As in Mercer, id., therefore, `[w]e do not see how the court could have found that a\nclass so ... defined met the requirements of F.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2), (3) and (4).' We again express our\nconfusion as to `what effect a judgment could have on entirely different claims of other persons ...\nor what benefit a successful defendant could draw from it.'\"\nId.709 F.2d at 781.\n\nDefendant's reliance on Smith, however, is misplaced since, unlike that case, the present case involves a class\ndefined precisely in terms of the primary issue in the case, i.e., denial of Medicaid benefits on the basis of alien\nstatus. The vast preponderance of the class in the present case, therefore, will be directly affected by the\ndetermination of the propriety of excluding aliens from the Medicaid program.\nPlaintiffs correctly point out that classes similar to the plaintiff class here have been certified in other cases\nchallenging restrictions on alien eligibility for public benefits:\n\"In a case challenging a statute which restricted certain non-legal permanent resident aliens'\ntuition free admission to public schools, the class was defined as `all children who are over five\nand not over twenty-one years of age at the beginning of the scholastic year and have been or will\nbe denied admission to the public schools in the State of Texas on a tuition-free basis because of\nthe alienage provisions of section 21.031 of the Texas Education Code.' In re Alien Children\nEducation Litigation, 501 F.Supp. 544, 553 (S.D.Tex.1980),aff'd sub nom. Plyer v. Doe, 457 U.S.\n202 [102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786] (1982). In a case challenging the interpretation of the term\npermanently residing in the U.S. under color of law as it related to claims for unemployment\ncompensation benefits, the class was defined as `all past, present, and future alien claimants of\nunemployment insurance benefits in the State of Texas who have had or will have their claims\ndenied on the basis of their alienage.' Ibarra v. Texas Employment Commission, 598 F.Supp. 104,\n105 (E.D.Tex. 1984).\"\nIn light of these precedents, the present class definition is sufficiently well tailored to the issues and proof to be\n1172 offered in this *1172 litigation, and defendant's motion to narrow the class definition is denied.\nMotions to Intervene\nFive individuals, Carlos Gonzalez, Ada Williams, Lech Ciesluk, Hutton Griffith, and Alexander Bernshtein, seek to\n[3]\nintervene in the lawsuit generally and be designated additional class representatives  pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2).\nBecause their claims raise the identical legal issues raised on behalf of the class and the status of their INS\npetitions make them particularly well suited to act as class representatives, their motion is granted.\nRule 24(b)(2) authorizes intervention in the court's discretion \"when an applicant's claim or defense and the main\naction have a question of law in common.\" This rule is satisfied here where, despite factual differences between\nthe plaintiffs and the proposed intervenors, a common question of law has been raised. See, e.g., Boone v.\nWyman, 295 F.Supp. 1143, 1148 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd,412 F.2d 857 (2d Cir.1969),cert. denied,396 U.S. 1024, 90\nS.Ct. 600, 24 L.Ed.2d 518 (1970).\nLike the named plaintiffs and the plaintiff class, the proposed intervenors seek declaratory and injunctive relief\nagainst federal defendant's denial of Medicaid to them on the basis of its alienage requirements. The proposed\nintervenors share with the other named plaintiffs and plaintiff class members a common position on the three\nmain legal questions of this case, namely (1) whether the Medicaid statute authorizes any alienage requirement\nat all, (2) whether such requirement is constitutional within the meaning of the fourteenth and fifth amendments,\nand (3) what the phrase \"residing ... under color of law\" means. These shared issues bring the proposed\nintervenors within the scope of Rule 24(b) and justify granting their motion to intervene.\nDesignation of at least some of these individuals to act as additional class representatives is also appropriate in\nlight of the fact that two of the class representatives have died. The first of these, Emiline Forbes, was a 94 year\nold woman who suffered from arteriosclerotic heart disease, a stroke, and diabetes. At the time of her death her\napplication for \"deferred action\" status with the INS was still pending. Such status has been described as the\nresult of the exercise of administrative discretion when an alien is found to be entitled to law enforcement priority. \nSee INS Deportation Officer's Handbook, p. 372. The second deceased representative, Wilson Flores, was a 5\nyear old child suffering from leukemia. Having been in the United States for three years, he had applied for an\nimmigration status known as \"extended voluntary departure,\" and his application was granted before his death.\nExtended voluntary departure involves a determination by the INS that the petitioner should be allowed to remain\n\nphysically in the United States for a period of time because of a variety of factors including age, physical health,\nneed for medical treatment or qualification for upgraded immigration status in the near future. See 8 C.F.R. §\n242.5(a)(2).\nThe situation of two of the proposed intervenors bears a striking resemblance to that of Emiline Forbes and\nWilson Flores and thus would be appropriate additional representatives capable of providing an array of up-to-\ndate factual circumstances that the deceased representatives can no longer supply. Ms. Forbes' situation\nresembles that of 78-year-old Ada Williams, who suffers from contratures, depression, and an inability to walk,\nand who had already been granted deferred alien status by the INS. Similarly, Wilson Flores' situation resembles\n1173 that of 16-year-old Carlos *1173 Gonzalez, who suffers from cerebral palsy, and who like Wilson Flores has been\ngranted extended voluntary departure status. Both Ms. Williams and Carlos Gonzalez thus should be designated\nadditional class representatives.\nThe remaining three proposed intervenors, Messrs. Ciesluk, Griffith and Bernshtein, present a variety of medical\ncircumstances and immigration postures. Mr. Ciesluk's situation is unique. A quadraplegic in need of rehabilitative\ncare, he originally came from Poland approximately 13 years ago. Currently, he has been granted extended\nvoluntary departure status like Flores and Gonzalez, but he received this designation according to an INS policy\nthat awards such status to Polish nationals who entered this country before July 22, 1984.\nMr. Bernshtein, an 87 year old man suffering from arteriosclerotic heart disease with coronary insufficiency and\ncardiac arrhythmia, emigrated to this country from Israel but originally came from the Soviet Union, where he\nfaced persecution. His nationality alone does not entitle him extended voluntary departure status, as is the case\nwith Mr. Ciesluk. Rather, his immigration status resembles that of Mr. Griffith and those of two current class\nrepresentatives, Lydia Lewis and Andre Francis, since they are all intended beneficiaries of \"relative visa\npetitions,\" which are petitions filed on their behalf by certain relatives who are themselves either U.S. citizens or\nlegal permanent residents. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1151(b), 1153(a). These individuals differ only in the degree to which\ntheir immigration status has been up-graded by INS. At the lower end is Mr. Griffith, a 35 year old quadraplegic\nfrom Guyana whose relative visa petition has yet to be acted upon by the INS. Current class representatives\nLewis and Francis have proceeded to the next step, i.e., their petitions have been \"approved.\" Such approval\nentitles them to apply for the adjustment of their status. See 8 C.F.R. § 204.3. Finally, Mr. Bernshtein's\nimmigration posture has moved a step further toward legal permanent resident status. On March 3, 1986, his\napplication for adjustment of status was accepted as properly filed by INS, and he had an interview scheduled for\nadjustment of status May 7, 1986.\nDesignation of Messrs. Ciesluk, Griffith, and Bernshtein as additional class representatives adds diversity to the\ngroup of class representatives and enhances the likelihood that many different aspects of the class identity will be\nreflected among its representatives. It has enabled the Court to have before it information with respect to various\nstages in the process of moving toward legal permanent resident status and various degrees of medical need.\nBecause increased complexity in the circumstances represented by the named plaintiffs should enhance the\n[3a]\ncomplete development of the issues, the applications of all of the proposed intervenors is granted.\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nPlaintiffs' substantive motions seek preliminary injunctive relief on behalf of the plaintiff class and summary\njudgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Plaintiffs argue that the policy of the\nfederal and state defendants of excluding non-LPR aliens from Medicaid coverage is invalid. More specifically,\nplaintiffs challenge the lawfulness of the Secretary's regulation establishing the alienage requirement, 42 C.F.R. §\n1174 435.402(b), and the companion New York state requirement, 18 NYCRR § 349.3, on three *1174 grounds: first,\nthat they violate the Medicaid statute itself; second, that they offend constitutional principles of due process; and\nfinally, that the federal defendant's interpretation of the \"under color of law\" requirement is improperly narrow. The\nCourt need not reach these last two arguments, however, since it finds that the disputed regulations are not\nauthorized under the Medicaid statute. According, plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is granted, thereby\nrendering moot their motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nMedicaid was originally enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq. The\nSecond Circuit has described the program as \"a cooperative federal/state cost-sharing program designed to\nenable participating states to furnish medical assistance to persons whose income and resources are insufficient\nto meet the costs of necessary medical care and services.\" DeJesus v. Perales, 770 F.2d 316, 318 (1985).\nAn examination of the language of the Medicaid statute, as all parties agree, reveals that it includes neither an\nexpress alienage restriction nor any residency requirement similar to that set forth in the HHS regulation under\nattack. Nor does the Act set forth anywhere a single statement of criteria establishing eligibility for Medicaid.\nRather, separate eligibility standards are set forth for each type of program authorized by the statute. Thus,\nconsideration of whether a single criterion applies to all these programs requires an examination of the separate\nprograms and their accompanying eligibility standards.\nThere are generally two sets of persons eligible for Medicaid: the \"categorically needy\" and the \"medically\nneedy.\" DeJesus v. Perales, supra at 318. Roughly speaking, the categorically needy are those who earn no\nmore than that necessary to cover the necessities of life; the medically needy differ in that it is only the expense\nof necessary medical care that strains their ability to pay for basic necessities. See id. at 321.\nThe above description provides about the only simple statement that may be made about the persons that a state\nMedicaid plan may cover. The complex set of standards for state Medicaid programs is set out largely in 42\n[4]\nU.S.C. § 1396a  Section 1396a(a)(10)(A) describes the categorically needy as divisible into two subgroups. The\nfirst subgroup is defined in § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i) (\"Subsection (i)\") as a mandatory group, that is, all states\nparticipating in the Medicaid program must provide Medicaid coverage to these individuals. This subgroup will be\nreferred to as the \"mandatory categorically needy.\" The second subgroup is defined in § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)\n(\"Subsection (ii)\") as an optional group, that is, participating states have the option to determine whether they will\nextend Medicaid to this subgroup. This subgroup will be referred to as the \"optionally categorically needy\" or the\n\"optional categories\" program. Finally, § 1396a(a)(10)(C) authorizes states to include another optional group in\ntheir Medicaid programs, the medically needy.\nNew York joined the Medicaid program in 1966. The New York State Department of Social Services was\nauthorized to establish a Medicaid plan covering all the categories of eligible individuals under the federal\nMedicaid statute. DeJesus, supra at 319. Thus, the New York plan includes the mandatory categorically needy,\nthe optionally categorically needy, and the medically needy.\nThe mandatory categorically needy are described in Subsection (i) as follows:\n\"A state plan for medical assistance must00\n97\n(10) provide00\n97\n(A) for making medical assistance available, including at least the care and services listed in\nparagraphs (1) through (5) and (17) of section 1396d(a) of this title, to00\n97\n(i) all individuals00\n97\n(I) who are receiving aid or assistance under any plan of the State approved under subchapter I,\n1175 X, XIV, or *1175 XVI[5] of this chapter, or part A or part E of subchapter IV of this chapter\n(including individuals eligible under this subchapter by reason of section 602(a)(37) or 606(h) of\nthis title, or considered by the State to be receiving such aid as authorized under section 614(g) of\nthis title),\n(II) with respect to whom supplemental security income benefits are being paid under subchapter\nXVI of this chapter, or\n(III) who are qualified pregnant women or children as defined in section 1396d(n) of this title.\"\nSubsection (i)(I) refers to individuals who are actually receiving benefits under the other cooperative federal/state\nassistance programs, such as aid to the blind or to the permanently disabled. The most notable of these\n\ncooperative programs for our purposes is Aid to Families with Dependent Children (\"AFDC\"). Subsection (i)(II)\n[6]\ndescribes recipients of Supplemental Security Income Benefits (\"SSI\").  Subsection (i)(III) describes two\nsubgroups: (1) children under 5 who meet the income and resources requirement of the state's AFDC plan, 42\nU.S.C. § 1396d(n)(2), and (2) pregnant women whose pregnancies are medically verified and who would be\neligible for AFDC if the child had been born already and was living with the mother, 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(n)(1).\nThese two subgroups will be referred to as \"AFDC-related children under 5\" and \"AFDC-related pregnant\nwomen.\" Finally, plaintiffs correctly point out that another subsection of the Medicaid statute, § 1396a(a), (e)(4),\nrequires the inclusion of another group in all participating state plans, i.e., babies born to women who are\nrecipients of Medicaid at the time of the child's birth. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(e)(4). The Medicaid statute thus requires\nall state programs to cover five groups: (1) recipients under other cooperative federal/state programs (primarily\nAFDC), (2) SSI recipients, (3) AFDC-related children under 5, (4) AFDC-related pregnant women, and (5) babies\nborn to recipients of Medicaid as of their birth.\nThe optionally categorically needy are defined in Subsection (ii) as follows:\n\"A state plan for medical assistance must00\n97\n(10) provide00\n97\n(A) for making medical assistance available, including at least the care and services listed in\nparagraphs (1) through (5) and (17) of section 1396d(a) of this title, to00\n97\n(ii) at the option of the State, to any group or groups of individuals described in section 1396d(a) of\nthis title (or, in the case of individuals described in section 1396d(a)(i) of this title, to any\nreasonable categories of such individuals) who are not individuals described in clause (i) of this\nsubparagraph but00\n97\n(I) who meet the income and resources requirements of the appropriate State plan described in\nclause (i) or the supplemental security income program (as the case may be),\n(II) who would meet the income and resources requirements of the appropriate State plan\ndescribed in clause (i) if their work-related child care costs were paid from their earnings rather\nthan by a State agency as a service expenditure,\n1176 *1176 (III) who would be eligible to receive aid under the appropriate State plan described in\nclause (i) if coverage under such plan was as broad as allowed under Federal law,\n(IV) with respect to whom there is being paid, or who are eligible, or would be eligible if they were\nnot in a medical institution, to have paid with respect to them, aid or assistance under the\nappropriate State plan described in clause (i), supplemental security income benefits under\nsubchapter XVI of this chapter, or a State supplementary payment,\n(V) who are in a medical institution, who meet the resource requirements of the appropriate State\nplan described in clause (i) or the supplemental security income program, and whose income\ndoes not exceed a separate income standard established by the State which is consistent with the\nlimit established under 1396b(f)(4)(C) of this title, or\n(VI) who would be eligible under the State plan under this title if they were in a medical institution,\nwith respect to whom there has been a determination that but for the provision of home or\ncommunity based services described in section 1396n(c) of this title they would require the level of\ncare provided in a hospital, skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility the cost of which\ncould be reimbursed under the State plan, and who will received home or community based\nservices pursuant to a waiver granted by the Secretary under section 1396n(c) of this title.\"\nThis subsection allows states to cover individuals who do not qualify under Subsection (i). More precisely, this\n[7]\nsubsection authorizes Medicaid in seven categories of individuals  who are listed in section 1396d(a) as\nindividuals who are:\n\n(i) Under the age of 21 or, at the option of the State, under the age of 20, 19, or 18 as the State\nmay choose. § 1396d(a)(i);\n(ii) caretaker relatives living with a child who \"is (or would, if needy, be) a dependent child\" under\nAFDC. § 1396d(a)(ii) (\"AFDC-related caretaker relatives\");\n(iii) 65 years of age or older. § 1396d(a)(iii);\n(iv) blind. § 1396d(a)(iv);\n(v) 18 years of age or older and permanently and totally disabled. § 1396d(a)(v);\n(vi) an \"essential\" person, defined as spouses living with the recipients of benefits under title I, X,\nIX, or XVI. § 1396d(a)(vi);\n(vii) pregnant women. § 1396d(a)(viii).\nThese seven categories of individuals are eligible under the optional categories program, however, only if they\nalso fit within one of the six categories of need listed in Subsection (ii) because they are individuals:\n(I) who meet the income and resources requirements of the appropriate State plan described in\nclause (i) or the supplemental security income program, or\n(II) who would meet the income and resources requirements of the appropriate State plan\ndescribed in clause (i) if their work-related child care costs were paid from their earnings rather\nthan by a State agency as a service expenditure, or\n(III) who would be eligible to receive aid under the appropriate State plan described in clause (i) if\ncoverage under such plan was as broad as allowed under Federal law, or\n(IV) who are receiving, are eligible for, or would be eligible for SSI, AFDC, or other federal/state\nbenefits program if they were not in a medical institution, or\n(V) who are in a medical institution, who meet the resource requirements of SSI or AFDC, and\nwhose income meets a standard set by the State, or\n(VI) who would be eligible for Medicaid if they were in a medical institution, but who instead\nreceive home or community based services.\n1177 *1177 Generally speaking, then, the optionally needy subgroup includes minors, the elderly, the blind, the\ndisabled, pregnant women, the spouses of SSI recipients or AFDC-related caretaker relatives, if they are \"needy\"\naccording to the income and resource requirements of the AFDC and SSI cash benefit programs. These seven\ncategories of needy people, then, are permissible categories for which participating states may provide Medicaid,\nif they so choose.\nThe third group of Medicaid eligible individuals, the medically needy, is authorized under § 1396a(a)(10)(C). Like\nthe optional categories program, the medically needy program includes the seven categories of individuals listed\nin § 1396d(a), i.e., minors, the elderly, the blind, the disabled, pregnant women, spouses of SSI recipients or\nAFDC-related caretaker relatives. But a broader range of these individuals may be eligible under the medically\nneedy category, since it applies less stringent income and resource requirements than those applied to the\noptionally categorically needy. Although states generally have flexibility to determine eligibility under the medically\nneedy category, see § 1396a(a)(10)(C), once they choose to cover the medically needy, they are required to\ncover two groups of individuals: (I) individuals under the age of 18 who, but for income and resources, would be\neligible for medical assistance as an AFDC or SSI recipient covered under Subsection (i) (the mandatory\ncategorically needy), and (II) pregnant women, during the course of their pregnancy, who, but for income and\nresources, would be eligible for medical assistance as an AFDC or SSI under Subsection (i) (the mandatory\ncategorically needy). Thus, all states choosing to extend Medicaid to the medically needy must extend it to\n\nchildren under 18 and pregnant women who meet the non-financial eligibility requirements of SSI and AFDC.\nThese two groups will be referred to as the \"mandatory medically needy.\"\nDISCUSSION\nThe question presented here is whether the Secretary's alienage requirement set forth in regulations\npromulgated to carry out the Medicaid program was either originally authorized in the Medicaid statute or\nsubsequently ratified by Congress. Defendants do not dispute that, if the requirement was neither mandated or\nsubsequently ratified by Congress, the Secretary's regulation must be void as beyond the limits of his statutory\nauthority. The regulation at issue provides in pertinent part:\n\"The agency must provide Medicaid to otherwise eligible residents of the United States who are 00\n97\n\"(b) Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence of permanently residing in the United States\nunder color of law, including any alien who is lawfully present in the United States under section\n203(a)(7) or section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.\"\n42 C.F.R. § 435.402(b). The language of the companion state regulation closely tracks this provision. See 18\n[8]\nNYCRR § 349.3.  It is undisputed that the regulation is currently being applied to exclude from Medicaid\ncoverage all resident aliens who do not fit the categories described in the regulation.\nThe Secretary attempts to demonstrate that this regulation was within the scope of his statutory authority as of\nthe time it was originally adopted by the Secretary in 1973 by arguing first that the Medicaid statute incorporates\nby reference the alienage requirements explicitly set forth in both the AFDC and SSI statutes. Such incorporation\n1178 is clear with respect to the mandatory categorically needy, who are *1178 those actually receiving AFDC and SSI\nbenefits. The Secretary argues that in order to be presently receiving AFDC or SSI benefits (together referred to\nas the \"cash assistance programs\"), these individuals must have satisfied the alienage requirement included in\nboth programs, that they are \"permanently residing in the United States under color of law.\" See 42 U.S.C. § 602\n(a)(33) (the AFDC statute); 42 U.S.C. § 1382c(a)(1)(B) (the SSI statute). Thus, because the plain language of this\nsubsection conditions Medicaid eligibility upon receipt of cash benefits, this provision, the Secretary argues,\nincorporates the under color law requirement into the Medicaid statute.\nThis argument, however, only applies to one of the three groups that may be part of a state Medicaid program. As\nthe Secretary acknowledges, however, this mandatory categorically needy section is the least relevant to the\npresent discussion, since as non-LPR aliens none of the plaintiffs is presently receiving AFDC and SSI benefits\nprecisely because of the alienage requirements included in these programs. Plaintiffs thus do not rely on the\nmandatory categorically needy section of the Medicaid statute to establish their Medicaid eligibility. Rather, they\nseek to qualify as members of the other two Medicaid groups, the optionally categorically needy and the\nmedically needy, sections 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii) and 1396a(a)(10)(C). With regard to these provisions, the Secretary\nargues that the legislative history of the most recent amendments to the Medicaid statute establishes that\nCongress intended to tie Medicaid eligibility to eligibility for the cash assistance programs just as it did for the\nmandatory categorically needy group described above.\nThe current form of the optional categories program was established by Section 137 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal\nResponsibility Act of 1982, Pub.L. 97-248 (\"TEFRA\"). The House Conference Report accompanying this\nprovision noted that its purpose was to \"make explicit current law related to coverage of the optional categorically\nneedy, as reflected in current regulation at 42 C.F.R. §§ 435.210 et seq.\" House Conference Report No. 97-760\nat 441, reprinted in 1982, USCCAN 1190, 1221. The Secretary argues that such current law would include the\nregulation at issue in this case. Even more importantly, the Secretary argues, the Conference Report explicitly\nadopts his understanding of the eligibility requirements for the optional categories program: namely, individuals\nwill qualify for inclusion in this group only if they satisfy the non-financial eligibility requirements of the cash\nbenefits programs including the alienage requirement. The report provides in pertinent part:\n\"[T]he states continue to have the authority to provide coverage, at their option, to any or all of the\nfollowing optional categorically needy groups: individuals who would be eligible for AFDC if child\n\ncare costs were paid from earnings; individuals under age 21 who would be eligible for AFDC but\ndo not qualify as dependent children; individuals who would be eligible for AFDC if coverage under\nthe state's AFDC plan were as broad as allowed under title IV-A; individuals receiving only\noptional state supplements; and individuals in institutions who are eligible under a special income\nlevel.\"\nH.Rep. No. 757, Pt. 1, 97 Cong.2d Sess. 12-33. According to the Secretary, such constant references to\n\"individuals who [otherwise] would be eligible for AFDC\" demonstrates that Congress intended to define the\noptionally categorically needy as those who would satisfy the non-financial eligibility criteria of AFDC but are not\n[9]\nnow receiving benefits for a variety of reasons.\nWith regard to the medically needy, the Secretary makes a similar argument for an alienage requirement based\n1179 completely upon legislative history. The original authorizing section, then § 1396a(a)(10), provided *1179 in\npertinent part that the medically needy included \"all individuals who would, if needy, be eligible for aid or\nassistance under ... State [cash assistance] plan and who have insufficient ... income and resources to meet the\ncosts of necessary medical or remedial care and services....\" Such language, the Secretary argues,\ndemonstrates that, when Congress first enacted the Medicaid program, it intended to include within the medically\nneedy group only those satisfying the non-financial eligibility requirements of the cash assistance programs,\nincluding their alienage requirement. See also the original Senate and House Reports accompanying the 1965\nlegislation, S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong. 1st Sess. 1965, reprinted in USCCAN 1943, 1950; H.Rep. No. 213, 89th\nCong. 1st Sess. 66-67 (1965), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin. News 1965, p. 1943. The original wording of this\nprovision, however, was eliminated with the passage of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981 (\"OBRA\"), P.L.\n98-35, which enacted the present form of § 1396a(a)(10)(C). This new provision contains no description of the\nmedically needy at all but rather merely requires states to \"include a description of (I) the criteria for determining\neligibility of individuals in the [medically needy] group....\" 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(C). Nevertheless, again citing\nportions of the House and Senate reports accompanying the provisions, the Secretary argues that this change in\nlanguage was not intended to expand the substantive definition of the medically needy but only to provide the\nstates with greater flexibility regarding another factor that this provision deals with, namely, the types of medical\nservices that must be provided under the medically needy program. See, e.g., H.Rep. No. 97-208 1st Sess. at\n971 (1981), reprinted in 1981 USCCAN 396, 1010, 1333. Therefore, the Secretary concludes, the incorporation\nof the alienage requirement of the AFDC state into the eligibility criteria for Medicaid's medically needy program\ncontinued even after OBRA.\nAll of the Secretary's arguments referred to so far have supported its position that, at the time of the promulgation\nof the alienage requirement in 1973, the Secretary was acting in a manner consistent with the congressional\nintent underlying the Medicaid statute. Additionally, the Secretary argues in the alternative that, regardless of its\noriginal intent, in the period following 1973 Congress acquiesced in and ratified the Secretary's regulation. As\nevidence of such congressional acquiescence, the Secretary relies on statements in the legislative history of\nother legislation: namely, the Food Stamp amendments of 1977 and two proposed immigration reform bills. The\nHouse Report accompanying the 1977 amendments to the Food Stamp program, the Secretary argues, evinces\nCongress' specific knowledge of the existence of the Secretary's alienage requirement. It notes that \"[i]n 1973,\nHEW issued rules that banned participation by aliens in SSI and two other welfare programs, AFDC and\nMedicaid,\" but the report in no way expressed disapproval of these rules promulgated by the Secretary. More\nrecently, several reports accompanying immigration reform bills which were never enacted into law explicitly\nexpress the belief that aliens are ineligible for Medicaid. The Report of the House Committee on Energy and\nCommerce accompanying proposed H.R. 1510, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1983, states that\n\"nor00as undocumented or illegal aliens00are they covered by publicly financed health programs.\" H.Rep. 98-115,\n97 97\nPart 3 at 3. Similarly, the cost estimate of the proposed bill prepared by the Congressional Budget office stated\nthat \"Medicaid ... now require[s] recipients to be citizens or have resident status.\" Id. Pt. 1 at 103. Finally, the\nSenate Report accompanying the current immigration reform bill, S. 1200 (1985), also explains that Medicaid is\ncurrently unavailable to aliens: \"legalization of unauthorized aliens would entitle the aliens to receive benefits\nfrom a number of Federal assistance programs for which they are currently ineligible.\" S.Rep. No. 99-132, 99th\nCong. 1st Sess., 62 (Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate). Legislative history such as this, the Secretary\nconcludes, demonstrates that Congress was aware of and acquiesced in the current federal policy limiting alien\n\n1180 eligibility for Medicaid, and *1180 awareness and acquiescence can establish congressional ratification. See,\ne.g., Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 300-02, 101 S.Ct. 2766, 2778-79, 69 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981); Bob Jones University\nv. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983).\nUpon examination, the Secretary's arguments based on legislative history are not very convincing because of the\nfragmentary nature of the legislative history they rely on, some of it having no relationship to the Medicaid statute\nwhatsoever and none dealing directly with the specific provisions of the Medicaid statute supposedly being\ninterpreted. Perhaps this is so because a close look at the plain language, structure, and purpose of the statute,\nin addition to its legislative history, establishes that Congress never intended to prescribe an alienage\nrequirement and that the Secretary's regulation, accordingly, is invalid as beyond the statutory scope of the\nSecretary's authority.\nFirst, the plain language of the statute, as noted above, contains no express restrictions on alien eligibility\nwhatsoever. Perhaps, even more important in terms of the Secretary's arguments, the statute contains no\nprovision expressly adopting for all purposes the non-financial eligibility requirements applicable to SSI and\nAFDC. This is illustrated by the optional categories program which contains several references to AFDC and SSI.\nAmong the six categories of need listed as comprising the optionally categorically needy, three describe\nindividuals explicitly in terms of the financial criteria of AFDC and SSI. Subsection I includes those who \"meet the\nincome and resource requirements\" of these programs; Subsection II includes those who would meet those\nfinancial requirements if they paid for their own child care costs; and Subsection V includes those who actually\nmeet the financial requirements of AFDC and SSI but are in a medical institution. The explicit reference to the\n\"income and resource requirements\" of AFDC and SSI clearly suggests that other prerequisites for obtaining\nbenefits under those programs, for example, those relating to the applicant's status under our immigration laws,\nare not incorporated into the Medicaid program.\nTo be sure, two of the three remaining categories of the optional categories program, those set forth in\n[10]\nsubsections III and IV, speak in terms of individuals who \"are [or] would be eligible\" for AFDC or SSI.\nHowever, it is clear from the context in which the expression eligibility is used that eligibility in terms of the cash\nand resource requirements of AFDC and SSI is being spoken of. Finally, it bears noting that the medically needy\nprogram does not speak in terms of eligibility for AFDC or SSI at all, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(C); and thus, it\ncannot be said that the non-financial eligibility requirements of these programs were incorporated into this third\nMedicaid program either.\nThe language of the statute thus does not support the Secretary's argument that the legislative history of TEFRA,\nwhich enacted the current form of the optional categories program, suggests that Congress intended to\nincorporate the non-financial eligibility requirements of AFDC and SSI into the Medicaid program across the\nboard. The Secretary's assertion that the congressional reports' use of the phrase \"would be eligible for AFDC\"\nwas intended to refer to a single set of eligibility requirements for all categories of claimants in fact suggests that\nonly the financial requirements were meant to be incorporated into Medicaid since those are the only type of\neligibility requirements explicitly mentioned.\nOther aspects of the Medicaid program also reveal the unsoundness of the Secretary's position. The alienage\nrequirement of the cash assistance programs is only one of several non-financial prerequisites of these programs\n1181 that are not expressly incorporated into the Medicaid statute. Thus, as a prerequisite to obtaining AFDC, *1181\nfor example, an individual must participate in the WIN training and employment program unless he or she falls\nwithin one of the few exceptions of the programs, 42 U.S.C. § 602(a)(18), engage in a job search, 42 U.S.C. §\n602(a)(35), and not be a striker, 42 U.S.C. § 602(a)(21)(B), and children must be living with one of several\nspecified relatives in order to qualify, 42 U.S.C. § 606(a). None of these requirements is expressly incorporated\ninto either the optional categories or medically needy programs. See § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii), (C). Similarly, to\nqualify for SSI, an individual cannot be a blind or disabled individual over 15 and under 65 who refuses vocational\nand rehabilitation services without good cause, 42 U.S.C. § 1382d(c), but no Medicaid provision expressly\napplies this requirement to the optional categories or medically needy programs. Thus, if the Secretary is correct\nin his argument that the alienage requirement of the cash assistance programs applies to Medicaid because all of\nthe non-financial eligibility requirements of AFDC and SSI are impliedly incorporated into the Medicaid statute,\nthen a plethora of eligibility requirements would be tacked onto an already labyrinthian statute. Nothing in the\n\nlegislative history or in the Secretary's administrative practice suggests that such an interpretation is proper. \nCompare Quern v. Mandley, 436 U.S. 725, 98 S.Ct. 2068, 56 L.Ed.2d 658 (1978).\nAnother aspect of the Medicaid statute also shows the weakness of the Secretary's position. As already\nsuggested, each category of eligibility, the mandatory categorically needy, the optionally categorically needy, and\nthe medically needy, explicitly authorizes Medicaid for some groups of individuals who meet only the general\nfinancial eligibility requirements of AFDC and SSI. The inclusion of such groups by Congress contradicts the\nSecretary's argument that Congress intended that the non-financial criteria of these programs be incorporated\nacross the board into Medicaid. This decision has already pointed out that the optional categories program\nauthorizes states to cover three groups of individuals that satisfy only the financial requirements of AFDC and\nSSI. In a similar fashion, both the mandatory categorically needy and the medically needy programs also\nauthorize states to cover individuals satisfying only the financial requirements of AFDC and SSI. For example,\nunder the mandatory categorically needy program, all states are not only authorized but are required to provide\nMedicaid to, inter alia, children under five \"who meet the income and resource requirements\" of AFDC. § 1396a\n(a)(10)(A) (i)(III). In the absence of any mention of a need to meet the non-financial requirements of AFDC,\nincluding the alienage requirement, this section makes clear that states must extend Medicaid eligibility to all\nchildren who are as poor as those receiving AFDC, regardless of whether they meet the specific requirements of\nthe AFDC \"dependent child\" designation or whether they are American citizens, permanent residents, or non-LPR\naliens. Similarly, the medically needy include those individuals who are under age 21, pregnant, 65 or over, blind\n[11]\nor disabled without any mention of the AFDC or SSI statutes whatsoever, see also § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii).\nEstablished rules of statutory interpretation hold that, when a statute is plain on its face, it is not necessary to\nresort to legislative history as a guide to the statute's meaning. Connecticut v. U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency, 656 F.2d 902, 909 (2d Cir.1981); Meade Township v. Andrus, 695 F.2d 1006 (6th Cir.1983). Examination\nof the statute to this point suggests that it is plain on its face with regard to the argument that the alienage\nrequirement and other non-financial prerequisites of AFDC and SSI were incorporated into Medicaid. However, if\nonly because of the complexity of the statute, a brief review of the legislative and administrative history of\nMedicaid is appropriate.\n1182 From Medicaid's inception in 1965 until the promulgation of the Secretary's alienage *1182 requirement in 1973,\nNew York State provided federally participating Medicaid benefits to all otherwise eligible aliens. Originally, the\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare (\"HEW\"), HHS' predecessor, routinely approved state plans,\nincluding New York's, without regard to alien eligibility restrictions. Indeed, prior to 1971, there were no federal\nregulations whatsoever addressing alien eligibility. Then, in 1971 HEW promulgated regulations markedly\ndifferent from that under review today. They provided for federal participation in state Medicaid programs\nincluding resident aliens, and, in some circumstances, required Medicaid coverage for all otherwise eligible\naliens. 45 C.F.R. § 248.50; 36 Fed.Reg. 3872 (1971); HEW Handbook on Public Assistance Administration (1966)\n[12]\n New York was among those required by HEW to provide coverage for all otherwise eligible aliens. Thus, for\nthe first eight years of the program's existence, the Secretary interpreted the statute to require the provision of\nfederal financing for Medicaid services extended to resident aliens. In fact, on June 16, 1972, the Secretary\nproposed a regulation that would require rejection of any state Medicaid plan that would \"exclude an otherwise\neligible individual on the basis ... of his alien status,\" 37 Fed.Reg. 1977 (1972) (intended for codification at 42\nC.F.R. § 248.50), and would thus have effectively mandated that all states provide Medicaid coverage to all\notherwise eligible aliens. The proposed regulation never became final, however, and in the following year an\nalienage requirement was adopted by the Secretary, although no relevant Congressional amendment of the\nstatute signaled that such a change was appropriate.\nRather, shortly before this, Congress created the SSI program, and the Secretary candidly acknowledges that the\nlanguage of its alienage requirement was copied from such a requirement in the new SSI program. 38 Fed.Reg.\n30, 259 (1973); see Social Security Act Amendments of 1972, § 1614, Pub.L. No. 92-603, Title III, § 301, 86 Stat.\n1329, 1471 (1972). The Secretary incorporated the SSI alienage requirement even though Congress had\namended the Medicaid statute at the same time in the same Act and did not provide any such restriction for\nMedicaid. See Social Security Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-603, 86 Stat. 1329 (1972); H.Rep. 92-231, 92\nCong. 2d Sess., reprinted in 1972 USCCAN 4989, 5052-5107. It was not until nine years later that a similar\n\nalienage requirement was incorporated into AFDC by Congress in the 1981 OBRA statute. As the Secretary\nhimself acknowledges, OBRA simultaneously amended the Medicaid statute; again, it did not provide any similar\nalienage requirement in Medicaid.\nIn OBRA, as discussed above, Congress changed the definition of the medically needy to allow the states more\nflexibility to determine the sorts of services that must be provided. The Secretary argues, moreover, that\nstatements in the accompanying House Report demonstrate that, in so amending the medically needy provision,\nCongress had no intention of allowing states to cover individuals \"not covered under current laws.\" H.Rep. No.\n97-208 1st Sess. at 971 (1981), reprinted in 1981 USCCAN 1010, 1333. As of the time OBRA was enacted,\nhowever, i.e., 1981, Congress had adopted an alienage requirement only for SSI. As already discussed, it was\nOBRA itself that inserted a similar requirement into AFDC; and, as the Secretary himself acknowledged, until\n1973 the Medicaid statute had never included any such requirement.\n1183 At the time of Medicaid's enactment in 1965, the nation's other health care program, *1183 Medicare, was also\nadopted. Social Security Amendments of 1965, Pub.L. No. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286 (1965). Medicare provides\nmedical assistance to the aged and disabled without regard to financial status and is linked to the Social Security\nprogram, while Medicaid provides medical assistance to high-risk indigent populations. As defined in 42 U.S.C. §\n1396, the purpose of Medicaid is to permit each state, as far as fiscally practicable, to provide federally\nparticipating \"medical assistance on behalf of aged, blind and disabled individuals whose income and resources\nare insufficient to meet the cost of necessary medical services,\" and \"to help such individuals attain or retain the\ncapacity for independence.\" In 1965 Congress considered and imposed restrictions on alien eligibility for\nMedicare. Part B, See Pub.L. 89-97 § 1836, 79 Stat. 286, 304 (1965); Conf.Rep. No. 682, 89th Cong. 1st Sess., \nreprinted in 1965 USCCAN 1943, 2233-34, but, as occurred later on other occasions, omitted such restrictions\nfrom Medicaid (and also from Medicare Part A). Where Congress has demonstrated on several occasions that it\nknows how to include an alienage requirement when it intends to, and it has omitted the requirement in one\nprogram while simultaneously incorporating it into another, such omissions should be viewed as intentional. Such\nwas the view of the Second Circuit in State of New York v. Heckler, 719 F.2d 1191, 1197 (1983), when it refused\nto find that the parental notification requirements of Title XX had been implicitly incorporated into Title X. The\ncourt stated flatly:\n\"Title XX and the 1981 amendment to Title X were enacted at the same time, yet the former\nspecifically included a requirement for parental notification and consent while the latter did not.\nObviously, Congress knew how to require parental notice and consent when that was its\nintention.\"\nId. at 1197. See also FTC v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U.S. 505, 514-15, 83 S.Ct. 358, 364, 9 L.Ed.2d 466 (1963).\nCongress similarly knew how to impose alienage requirements on social welfare programs when it intended, and\nits refusal to impose such a requirement on Medicaid should be respected.\nUnable to support his argument for the incorporation of an alienage requirement in Medicaid simply on the basis\nof the legislative history of that statute, the Secretary points to fragmentary legislative history of unrelated and\nsometimes unenacted legislation in an effort to demonstrate that Congress ratified or acquiesced in the\nSecretary's regulations. The Second Circuit, however, has cautioned that \"[m]ere `acquiescence or nonaction' is\nnot enough for ratification `because explicit action, especially in areas of doubtful constitutionality, requires\ncareful and purposeful consideration by those responsible for enacting and implementing our laws.'\" EEOC v.\nCBS, Inc., 743 F.2d 969 (2d Cir.1984),quoting Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377\n(1959). See also Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 694 n. 11, 100 S.Ct. 1945, 1954 n. 11, 64 L.Ed.2d 611 (1980); \nSEC v. Sloan, 436 U.S. 103, 98 S.Ct. 1702, 56 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978). Such purposeful consideration of the\nSecretary's alienage requirement has not been demonstrated here.\nThe Secretary relies primarily on the House Report accompanying the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977, which\namended the Food Stamp program, Pub.L. 95-113, and had no direct effect on the Medicaid program. Of the 569\npages of the agriculture committee's report regarding the bill, one sentence refers to Medicaid: \"In 1973, HEW\nissued rules that banned participation by aliens in SSI and two other welfare programs, AFDC and Medicaid.\"\nH.Rep. No. 464, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1977 USCCAN 1704, 2115. The report clearly fails to show\nthat Congress carefully and purposefully considered the appropriateness of the Secretary's alienage restriction\n\nfor Medicaid. An examination of the only other proffered evidence of Congressional ratification, i.e., the\nunenacted bills attempting to effect immigration reform, demonstrates a similar lack of any careful and purposeful\nconsideration of an alienage restriction for Medicaid. The discussion focuses upon eligibility requirements for\n1184 classification as a legal permanent *1184 resident, and the issue of whether those individuals newly designated\nas legal permanent aliens should be eligible for Medicaid soon after they achieved that status. It does not,\nhowever, address the precise question here, i.e., whether an alienage requirement for Medicaid is authorized\nunder current immigration law and policy. As a result, it also fails to establish congressional ratification.\nBecause the Secretary's regulation falls outside the scope of the authority delegated under the Medicaid statute,\nit is invalid. See Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 237, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1075, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). Therefore,\nplaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is granted. Plaintiffs are directed within thirty days to settle a form of\njudgment on ten days notice as necessary to afford relief to plaintiffs and members of the plaintiff class, including\nnotice to class members of the relief to which they are or may be entitled.\nIn sum, plaintiffs' applications to amend the complaint, to modify the definition of the class, and for summary\njudgment are granted. The federal defendant's motion to decertify the class is denied. Proposed plaintiff 00\n97\nintervenors' motion to intervene and to become additional class representatives is granted.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] The Secretary's list, however, appears somewhat inaccurate. One of the named plaintiffs, Wilson Flores, now\ndeceased, was a child, and another, Yoshi Nakanishi, received three visa extensions. In addition, some of the\nproposed intervenors fit into other INS designations listed by the Secretary.\n[2] In its present motion to decertify, the Secretary did not argue that the class failed to meet the further\nrequirements of Rule 23(b). Satisfaction of these requirements having been previously established upon initial\ncertification, the Court need not re-evaluate the question now.\n[3] It should be noted that all five individuals have already had some connection to the case. Pursuant to orders\nof this Court dated November 26, 1985, March 7, 1986, and March 21, 1986, Messrs. Ciesluk, Griffith, and\nBernshtein and Ms. Williams prevailed on motions for preliminary injunctions against the federal defendant's\napplication of its alienage requirement so as to deny them benefits, and thus they all are now receiving Medicaid\npending the final determination of the case. Mr. Gonzalez is also now receiving Medicaid pursuant to the parties'\nagreement to such benefits during pendency of this action. Their applications to intervene were conditionally\ngranted in connection with these applications.\n[3a] The most recent applications of Celia Teran and Patricia Arias to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2) and be\ndesignated additional class representatives are also granted for similar reasons. Both intervenors raise the same\nlegal issues discussed above that are raised by the other intervenors and the class as a whole. Thus, they also\nsatisfy the requirement of Rule 24(b)(2) that the intervenor's action and the main action share a common\nquestion of law. Additionally, they should be designated as class representatives because they would further\ndiversify the interests and character of the class representatives. Ms. Teran is the only intervenor granted a visa\nextension by the INS, and she also has a pending application for deferred action status. Ms. Arias, like Mr.\nGriffith, has a pending relative visa petition, but she has been in this country for a much longer period of time, i.e.,\neight years rather than three years.\n[4] Unless otherwise stated, all section references will be to 42 U.S.C. (1982).\n[5] The cross references in this section are as follows: \nSubchapter I: Old Age Assistance for Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands\nSubchapter X: Aid to the Blind\nSubchapter XIV: Aid to Permanently and Totally Disabled\nSubchapter XVI: Supplemental Security Income\n\nSubchapter IV: Aid for Dependent Children (\"AFDC\")\n[6] SSI may be either a cooperative federal/state program, thus its mention in Subsection (I), or a pure federal\nprogram, thus a second mention in Subsection (II). Where states do not participate in an SSI program, which is\nnot the case in New York, they have the option to have some more flexibility in their eligibility standards for\nMedicaid. They can extend Medicaid to SSI recipients as discussed above under Subsection (i)(II), or under\nsection 1396(a)(10)(A)(i) can cover aged, blind, and disabled persons who meet eligibility criteria no more\nrestrictive than those in effect on January 1, 1972.\n[7] Section 1396d(a) actually contains eight listings, but two of these subsections (iv) and (vii) both refer to the\nblind. The subsections differ merely in that (iv) applies to states eligible to participate in SSI and (vii) applies to\nthose that are ineligible.\n[8] Thus, a finding that the federal regulation exceeds the Secretary's authority under the Medicaid Act\nnecessarily implies that the state regulation is invalid also. There is no dispute that a state participating in\nprograms under the Social Security Act may not create eligibility standards unless Congress has clearly indicated\nthat it may do so. See, e.g., Miller v. Youakim, 440 U.S. 125, 133-34, 99 S.Ct. 957, 963, 59 L.Ed.2d 194 (1979); \nCarleson v. Remillard, 406 U.S. 598, 600, 92 S.Ct. 1932, 1934, 32 L.Ed.2d 352 (1972); Townsend v. Swank, 404\nU.S. 282, 286, 92 S.Ct. 502, 505, 30 L.Ed.2d 448 (1971); King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 333, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 2141,\n20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968).\n[9] The Secretary lists these possible reasons for why such individuals may not be receiving AFDC: They choose\nnot to receive benefits; they are institutionalized; the state pays their child care costs; or their state's AFDC plan\nis not as broad as allowed. See Secretary's Brief in Opposition, p. 20 n. 7.\n[10] Subsection VI speaks in terms of eligibility \"under the State plan under this title,\" i.e., Medicaid, rather than in\nterms of AFDC or SSI.\n[11] One subgroup that does refer to these statutes authorizes Medicaid for \"essential\" persons defined spouses\nof SSI recipients, without any regard for whether the essential person would also qualify for SSI.\n[12] The regulation reads as follows: \n\"(a) A State plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act may not exclude an otherwise eligible citizen of the\nUnited States, regardless of how (by birth or by naturalization), or when, citizenship was obtained.\n(b) A State plan which includes the medically needy must include all otherwise eligible individuals, regardless of\ncitizenship status, unless all of the State's approved financial assistance plans require citizenship as a condition\nof eligibility.\n(c) A State plan may include persons without regard to citizenship status, even though all of the State's approved\nfinancial assistance plans contain such a requirement.\"\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
