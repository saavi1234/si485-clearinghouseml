Plaintiffs and defendants are to simultaneously address this issue by 12/31/03. Plaintiffs request prejudgment interest on their state law claims, but do not calculate such interest. Plaintiffs are to withdraw their claim for prejudgment interest or supply reasonable interest calculations for each plaintiff by 12/31/03. Unless Mr. Courtney has \"found\" his lost client, or in any event intends to oppose the plaintiffs' motion for an inquest/summary judgment, the Court is inclined to allow Mr. Courtney to withdraw and have a default judgment entered against the Wimmie Chen defendants as well as the already in default Clavin Chen defendants. Mr. Courtney is to advise the Court of his position by 12/22/03. The Court intends to issue its report and recommendation on the inquest in early January 2004. (Signed by Judge Andrew J.

    "summary": "<p>On June 7, 2000, a group of Chinese immigrant garment workers filed a lawsuit against their employers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) and the New York Minimum Wage Act, N.Y. Lab. Law § 650 et seq. Plaintiffs, who were represented by attorneys for the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, alleged that they worked 80 hour, were paid below minimum wage and were not paid overtime. They sought damages in the form of back pay and liquidated damages.  The complaint was amended to seek class action status.</p><p>Donna Karan International Incorporated, one of the defendants, moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim, asserting that it was not the employer of the plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs maintained that while they were technically employed by the garment factory defendants, as all garments were made for Donna Karan, it should be liable as a joint employer.  Donna Karan's motion was denied by District Judge Whitman Knapp on January 2, 2001.  Liu v. Donna Karan International Incorporated, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18847, *1 (S.D. NY 2001).</p><p>Discovery ensued and Donna Karan sought to discover the immigration status of the plaintiff workers. On June 20, 2002, Judge Knapp denied Donna Karan's request on relevancy grounds. Liu v. Donna Karan International Incorporated, 207 F. Supp. 2d 191 (S.D. NY 2002).</p><p>Settlement conferences and negotiations followed, which ultimately produced a settlement between plaintiff and the Donna Karan International, Inc.   Formal settlement papers were filed with the Court on July 30, 2003.</p><p>Following the settlement with Donna Karan, plaintiffs moved for a default judgment against the owners of the garment factories.  On January 7, 2004, Magistrate Judge Andrew J. Peck issued a report recommending entry of judgment for plaintiffs against the factory owners, jointly and severally, for damages (including prejudgment interest) of $ 556,577.07, plus $ 20,355.00 in attorneys' fees and $90 in costs.  Liu v. Donna Karan International Incorporated, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35 (S.D. NY January 7, 2004).</p><p>On March 1, 2004, the District Court (Judge Richard J. Howell) accepted and adopted Magistrate Judge Anthony Peck's report and recommendation and entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs.  The judgment was amended on July 13 and July 31 of 2006.</p><p>The PACER docket reflects that post-judgment activity included efforts by plaintiffs to examine the factory owners under oath, in an attempt to collect the default judgment.  It is unclear from the docket whether plaintiffs' default judgment was satisfied.</p><p></p>",

Where  available  the  affidavits  also  included  piecework and other records. The Court accepts plaintiffs' \nsample pages from the plaintiff's piecework or other records,  estimates of hours worked. \nbut since they are, for the most part, in Chinese, including the \ncomplete records would not have assisted the Court.  Consistent  with  the  approach  previously  used  by  Mr. \nKimerling and approved by the Court in Chen v. Jenna Lane, \nIt should be noted that \"plaintiffs were unable to obtain any  Inc., 30 F.

John Courtney, Flushing, NY, for All Other Defendants. \nMEMORANDUM & ORDER \nWHITMAN KNAPP, Senior District Judge. \nWe are in receipt of defendant Donna Karan International, Inc.'s (\"Donna Karan\") letter \ndated May 24, 2002 requesting discovery relating to plaintiffs' immigration status and \nplaintiffs' letter dated May 30, 2002 in opposition. After considering these letters in \nconjunction with the applicable case law we deny Donna Karan's request for such discovery \nat this time. \nIt is not clear to us that the new Supreme Court case, Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. \nNLRB (2002) ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1275, 152 L.Ed.2d 271, holding that an award of back \npay to an illegal alien for years of work \"not performed\" would be contrary to the policies \nunderlying the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, upon which Donna Karan relies \nin making this discovery request, applies to the case currently before us. Courts have \ndistinguished between awards of post-termination back pay for work not actually performed \nand awards of unpaid wages pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"). See Del \nRey Tortilleria, Inc. v. NLRB (7th Cir.1992) 976 F.2d 1115, 1122 n. 7 (distinguishing its \ndecision that undocumented workers could not receive back pay for unperformed labor with \nthe holding in Patel v. Quality Inn South (11th Cir.1988) 846 F.2d 700 that undocumented \nworkers were entitled to maintain an action for unpaid wages and damages under the \n\nFLSA). In fact, courts addressing the issue of whether defendants should be allowed to \ndiscover plaintiff-workers' immigration status in cases seeking unpaid wages brought under \nthe FLSA have found such information to be undiscoverable. See In re Reyes (5th Cir.1987) \n814 F.2d 168 (granting mandamus overturning district court decision which allowed inquiry \ninto documentation of alien petitioners for purposes of determining coverage under the \nFLSA); Flores v. Albertsons, Inc., No. CV 01-00515 AHM (SHX), 2002 WL 1163623 \n(C.D.Cal. April 9, 2002) (examining Hoffman Plastics and finding its holding does not \nsupport discovery of plaintiffs' immigration status); Ansoumana v. Gristede's Oper. Corp., \n201 F.R.D. 81 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (unpub. order; hearing tr.) (granting plaintiffs' motion \ndisallowing deposition questions as to plaintiffs' immigration status). \nFurthermore, even if such discovery were relevant, and at this juncture it appears 193*193 \nnot to be, the risk of injury to the plaintiffs if such information were disclosed outweighs the \nneed for its disclosure.[1] Flores, 2002 WL 1163623 at *6 (citing Flynn v. Goldman, Sachs & \nCo., No. 91 Civ. 0035(KMW), 1993 WL 362380 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, 1993)). Even if the \nparties were to enter into a confidentiality agreement restricting the disclosure of such \ndiscovery, as Donna Karan suggests, there would still remain \"the danger of intimidation, \nthe danger of destroying the cause of action\" and would inhibit plaintiffs in pursuing their \nrights. Ansoumana v. Gristede's Oper. Corp., No. 00 Civ. 0253(AKH) (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 8, \n2000) (hearing tr. at 12); see also In re Reyes, 814 F.2d at 170. \nFor the aforementioned reasons we deny Donna Karan's request to discover plaintiffs' \nimmigration status at this time. If it appears at some later juncture that such discovery would \nbe relevant, and more relevant than harmful, Donna Karan may seek leave to renew this \nrequest. \n[1] This includes Donna Karan's desire to \"preserve a factual record on this issue\" in order to \"permit appellate \nreview.\" \n ",
