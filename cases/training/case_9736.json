    "summary": "<p>On October 9, 2001, a group of pre-trial detainees represented by private counsel filed a class action civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, challenging the naked confinement policy of the Saginaw County Jail.  Plaintiffs alleged that, under the policy, the County Sheriff and deputies placed detainees they found to be uncooperative or disruptive in administrative segregation cells, after being stripped naked.  Plaintiffs further alleged that they were viewed while naked by jail personnel and inmates of the opposite gender.  This policy, plaintiffs maintained, was unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, monetary damages and class certification.  Over the course of the litigation, the complaint was amended six times. </p><p>Following years of extensive discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  Plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction.  The District Court (District Judge David M. Lawson) held that the County's policy violated due process and was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  The judge ruled that the sheriff and individual officers, however, were entitled to qualified immunity on the federal claims and absolute immunity on the state claims.  The Court declined to enter a preliminary injunction.  Rose v. Saginaw County, 353 F.Supp.2d 900 (E.D.Mich. 2005).</p><p>Plaintiffs then moved for class certification or to add new individual plaintiffs to the case.  Defendants opposed certification and sought leave to add a defense that plaintiffs' claims were barred by exhaustion requirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).  Judge Lawson denied these motions, found that certification was inappropriate and that the PLRA did not apply to the case, as the plaintiffs were not confined when the suit was filed.  Rose v. Saginaw County, 232 F.R.D. 267 (E.D. Mich. 2005).</p><p>In an attempt to broker a settlement, Judge Lawson referred the case to Magistrate Judge Patrick J. Duggan for a settlement conference and appointed former Wayne County, Michigan Circuit Judge Pamela Harwood as a facilitator to conduct a mediation session.  Negotiations were broadened and the parties discussed a global settlement of four related cases - Rose v. Saginaw County,  Brabant v. Saginaw County, Abner v. Saginaw County, and Whittum v. Saginaw County - in which there were approximately 94 plaintiffs.  Settlement negotiations stalled and the defendants moved for sanctions and to dismiss the case, alleging that the individual plaintiffs failed to appear at settlement conferences and mediation. Plaintiffs maintained defendants' motion was without merrit, as plaintiffs' attorneys attended the various conferences with full authority to settle the case.  Judge Lawson denied the defense motion by an unpublished order dated July 19, 2007.</p><p>The parties reached an agreement to resolve the individual plaintiffs' damage claims in Rose v. Saginaw County (case no. 01-10337) and two similar cases, Abner v. Saginaw County (case no. 05-10323), and Brabant v. Saginaw County (case no. 05-10030).  Under the agreement, approved by Judge Lawson on January 11, 2008, a special case evaluation process was established to determine the monetary value of individual claims.  Each plaintiff's claim would be evaluated by a three-attorney panel, consisting of a plaintiff specialist chosen by plaintiffs' counsel, a defense specialist chosen by defense counsel and the chairperson, retired state judge Harwood.  The panel would recommend a settlement value for each claim, which would either be accepted or rejected by the parties.  If the recommendation was rejected, the claim would be set for trial.  The County agreed to pay plaintiffs' counsel a fee equal to thirty-percent (30%) of the amount of each case settled or tried to a conclusion, subject to a cap in the amount of $400,000 on the total amount of attorney's fees and costs claimed by the plaintiffs.</p><p>On March 10 and 12, 2008, several Plaintiffs accepted the court recommended settlement payouts, and their claims were dismissed with prejudice. Four plaintiffs rejected the settlement recommendations, went to trial and were awarded between $25,000 and $50,000 each by a jury on March 18, 2008. Judgment was entered on these jury verdicts on March 20, 2008. Due to the great amount of time between the initial complaint and the judgment, Plaintiffs moved for, and were granted interest on their damages dating back to the original complaints.</p><p>The remaining three Plaintiffs' claims were consolidated on March 20, 2008 to be included with James Abner, III v. Saginaw County, docket no. 05-10323, which was dismissed on February 17, 2010 for want of prosecution. </p><p></p>",

The Court has entered\nsubsequent orders scheduling a trial on damages for a group of plaintiffs, and in the meanwhile the\nparties have scheduled sessions with a facilitative mediator in an effort to resolve their differences.\n\nCase 2:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 217      Filed 02/02/2006     Page 2 of 5\nIn preparation for mediation and the damages trial, the parties apparently have agreed to\nallow counsel for the plaintiffs to inspect the jail facilities, particularly the segregation cells, which\nform the subject matter of this dispute.  Otherwise, discovery closed several months ago according\nto this Court’s Case Management and Scheduling Order.\nThe plaintiffs allege in their motion that the defendants seek to limit the inspection and\nphotographing of the jail facilities as follows: (1) only two of the plaintiffs’ lawyers will be\npermitted to attend; (2) only still photographs will be permitted and videotaping will not be allowed;\nand (3) the tour will last only one and one-half hours.  The plaintiffs seek an order permitting\nvideotaping of all of the jail facilities “in order for the members of the jury to fully comprehend the\nnature and extent of the harm caused to the plaintiffs as a result of the violation of their\nconstitutional rights [and to allow] the jury [to] be able to visualize the alleged adverse jail\nconditions.”  Plaintiffs’ motion at 2.\nThe defendants oppose the motion on the basis of administrative inconvenience and security\nconcerns.  Although the defendants do not oppose still photography, they believe that videotaping\nwill disrupt the operation of the jail by encouraging inmates to act out and become disruptive.  They\nare also concerned that locations including the booking area where inmates are processed are too\nbusy to allow disruption by videotaping.  The defendants, in addition, assert that videotaping would\nallow dissemination of the layout of jail facilities and compromise security, particularly if the\nindividual plaintiffs are allowed to view the tape.\nThe discovery rules are intended to allow the parties “to prepare for trial in a manner that\nwill promote the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of the action.”  Wright & Miller,\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 2001.  These rules may require parties “to disclose fully the nature\n-2-\n\nCase 2:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 217      Filed 02/02/2006     Page 3 of 5\nand scope of the controversy, to narrow, simplify, and frame the issues involved, and . . . to obtain\nthe information needed to prepare for trial.”  Ibid.  On occasion, discovery may encompass matters\nthat are otherwise thouoght to be confidential and not available to public view.\nHowever, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) allows a court to make orders protecting\nparties and witnesses during the discovery process.  An important purpose of a pretrial protective\norder is to preserve the confidentiality of materials which are revealed in discovery but not made\npublic by trial.  National Polymer Products, Inc. v. Borg-Warner Corp., 641 F.2d 418, 424 (6th Cir.\n1981).  Courts have great latitude in deciding whether to issue protective orders, and security is one\nof the factors to be considered.  See Hines v. Wilkinson, 163 F.R.D. 262, 267 (S.D. Ohio 1995).  The\nburden of establishing the propriety of a protective order is on the party seeking the order. Damiano\nv. Sony Music Entertainment, Inc., 168 F.R.D. 485, 490 (D.N.J. 1996).\nThe Court has considered the respective interests of the parties and finds no basis to permit\nvideotaping or photography except the administrative segregation cells.  Those, after all, are the only\nsubjects of this dispute.  Neither this action nor the Court’s order granting summary judgment\naddressed issues of general jail conditions or other prisoner hardships than confinement, naked, in\nthe administrative segregation cells.\nOn the other hand, it is possible to fashion an order that would permit the plaintiffs to\nvideotape the administration segregation cells and still preserve the security and administrative\nconvenience interests articulated by the defendants.\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the plaintiffs’ emergency motion to compel videotaping\nof jail facilities [dkt # 214] is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.\n-3-\n\nCase 2:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 217      Filed 02/02/2006     Page 4 of 5\nIt is further ORDERED that the defendants shall permit two of plaintiffs’ counsel access to\nthe Saginaw County Jail on February 2, 2006 for the purpose of inspection, photographing, and\nvideotaping the facilities as limited herein.\nIt is further ORDERED that the tour of the jail facilities shall be completed by noon.\nIt is further ORDERED that photographing and videotaping the jail facilities shall be limited\nto the administrative segregation cells and the area immediately adjacent to them.\nIt is further ORDERED that no photographs, videotape, or digital images shall be taken of\njail personnel, inmates, or detainees.  If the administrative segregation cells are occupied, then the\nCourt directs the defendants to cause them to be temporarily vacated until the photographing session\nis concluded.\nIt is further ORDERED that upon completion of the session, the videotape, photographic\nfilm, and electronic media of any digital recording shall be turned over to counsel for the defendant,\nwho may examine the photographic record and file any motions for a protective order necessary to\naddress security concerns of jail personnel.  Said motion shall be filed on or before February 9,\n2006.  However, the photographic record shall be made available to Judge Duggan, if necessary, to\nassist him in conducting a settlement conference.  If no motions are filed by the deadline established\nherein, the materials shall be immediately returned to counsel for the plaintiffs.\nIf motions are filed, the materials shall be turned over to the Court for an inspection in\ncamera.\nDated: February 2, 2006 s/David M.

Saginaw County,  \n353 F.Supp.2d 900 (E.D.Mich. 2005).........................................................................................1 \n \n- ii - \n\nCLASS DEFINITION \n  For reasons explained at oral argument, Plaintiffs seek certification of the following \nclass: \nAll  detainees  who  were  placed  in  administrative  segregation  in  the \nSaginaw County Jail from October 19, 19981 and were stripped of their \nclothing  before  being  placed  in  administrative  segregation  pursuant  to \nDefendants’ policy. \n  Plaintiffs contend that the class should include all persons, whether pre-trial detainees or \npost-trial inmates, because the County’s policy applied to all persons confined at the jail.  See \nRose v. Saginaw County, 353 F.Supp.2d 900, 906 (E.D.Mich. 2005) (“Whenever a person is \nplaced in administrative segregation, it is the policy and practice of the Saginaw County jail \npersonnel to remove the person's clothing and put the detainee in the segregation cell naked.  A \ndetainee's clothes are forcefully removed if he or she does not voluntarily comply with jail \npersonnel orders to remove the clothes prior to entering the administrative segregation cell.”). \n  Plaintiffs do not believe that there is any basis for distinguishing between pre-trial and \npost-trial detainees based on the authorities upon which this court relied in Rose, 353 F.Supp.2d \nat 920, citing, inter alia, Cornwell v. Dahlberg, 963 F.2d 912 (6th Cir.1992), and Kent v. \nJohnson, 821 F.2d 1220 (6th Cir.1987); and Everson v. Michigan Dept. of Corrections, 391 F.3d \n737 (6th Cir.2004). \n  The court should first decide whether the term ”detainees” as used in this proposed class \ndefinition includes detained persons in a post trial status. \n  Once the court defines “detainees”, the court should then form two subclasses: \n1)  Detainees placed in administrative segregation without gowns-the vast majority of the \nmembers of the proposed class, and, \n                                                 \n1   The First Amended Complaint was filed on October 18, 2001.  The statute of limitations is three years.  \nThus, any person who had been placed in segregation of  \n \n\n \n2)  Detainees placed in administrative segregation with gowns. \n  Plaintiffs also do not believe that there is any basis for excluding from the class persons \nwho may have received some sort of paper gown because, under the admitted conditions at the \njail, the constitutional violation occurred when the person was stripped and, thus, at most, the \ngown would act as a mitigating factor with regard to the detainees invasion of privacy claim.  \nFurther, the County’s use of the gown under the admitted circumstances at the jail was not \nadequate to protect the privacy concerns protected by the Fourth Amendment. \n \n \n/s/ Stephen Wasinger          \n \nChristopher J.

On or about\nSeptember 3, 2002, through the filing of Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint, Plaintiff Donna\nLynn Quarles joined the action as a named Plaintiff.  Because neither the complaint nor amended\ncomplaints provided a factual basis for the Plaintiffs’ claims, on October 25, 2002, Ms. Quarles was\ndeposed by Defendants to determine the basis for her claims as well as to establish any damages she\nmay have suffered as a result of the allegations against the Defendants.  (Exh. A - Quarles Dep.\nTrsc.). \nDuring her deposition, Ms. Quarles was able to provide a limited description of the events\nthat give rise to allegations against the Defendants and provided minimal, if any, testimony to\nsupport a claim for damages.  (See Exh. A).  She prepared no notes regarding her detention at the\nSaginaw County Jail and articulated no basis during her deposition upon which damages could be\nbased.  (See Exh. A).  Ms. Quarles neither missed work as a result of her incarceration at the Jail nor\nsought medical or psychological treatment.  (See Exh. A, p. 26).  Specifically, Ms. Quarles testified\nas follows:\nQ. Can you give me the names of any medical health care\nprovider, medical care or mental health care provider you\ntalked to relative to the - - \nMr. Fletcher: Did you talk to a psychiatrist or doctor about\nthis incident, yes or no?\nA. Doctor, there was not a doctor.  It was a counselor.  No\ndoctor.\nMr. Fletcher: About this incident?\nA. About this incident? No.  \n[Exh. A, p. 15].\n2\n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 225-1     Filed 04/11/2006     Page 5 of 8(cid:10)\nMs. Quarles did, however, admit that she was under the influence of alcohol at the time of\nher arrest and had a bodily alcohol level of 0.16.  She further testified that she called the arresting\nofficers names and refusing to obey Jail staff although she could not recall whether she was swearing\nat the corrections officers.  (Exh. A, pp. 18-22).  No additional discovery has been provided by\nPlaintiffs’ counsel to support a claim for damages.  \nDonna Quarles subsequently passed away on September 17, 2003 and Defendants were\nadvised that Ms. Quarles’ claims would be dismissed.  (Exh. B - Correspondence Dated 1/9/06).\nAfter advising that the claim would be dismissed, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Substitution of Party\nalmost 2-1/2 years after Ms. Quarles’ passing.  The motion was denied on the grounds that Plaintiffs\nfailed to establish that the movant was a proper party.1  Having subsequently been appointed personal\nrepresentative of Ms. Quarles estate, Lizzie Quarles, once again moves for substitution.  Defendants\nmaintain that it is within the Court’s discretion to grant the motion, and respectfully request this\nHonorable Court to DENY Plaintiffs’ request for the reasons contained within this response.\nLAW AND ARGUMENT\nIn support of their Motion, Plaintiffs rely exclusively upon Fed. R. Civ. P. 25.  Rule 25\nspecifically provides:\n(A)  Death.\n(1)     If a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the\nCourt may order substitution of the proper parties. The motion for\nsubstitution may be made by any party or by the successors or\nrepresentatives of the deceased party and, together with the Notice of\nHearing, shall be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 and upon\npersons not parties in the manner provided in Rule 4 for the service\nof a summons and may be served in any judicial district.  Unless the\n1 At the time of filing the original motion for substitution, Donna Quarles mother, Lizzie\nQuarles, had not been named a personal representative of her daughter’s estate.  \n3\n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 225-1     Filed 04/11/2006     Page 6 of 8(cid:10)\nmotion for substitution is made not later than 90 days after the death\nis suggested upon the record by service of a statement of the fact of\nthe death as provided herein for the service of the motion, the action\nshall be dismissed as to the deceased party.\n[Fed.R.Civ.P. 25] [Emphasis added].\nThe Court’s discretion to allow substitution pursuant to Rule 25 requires first, that the claim\nnot be extinguished upon death, and second, that the substitution be for a proper party.  Rule 25\nfurther requires that a Motion for Substitution be made not later than 90 days after the death is\nsuggested upon the record.2 \nIn the case at hand, Plaintiffs’ surviving claims were brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983.\nBecause §1983 does not contain a survival provision, the Court must look to the common law and\nthe State of Michigan Survival Statute.  Robertson v. Wegmann, 436 U.S. 584, 588 (1978).  Under\nthe Michigan Survival Statute, M.C.L. § 600.2921, “all actions and claims survive death.”\nConsequently, Ms. Quarles claims were not automatically extinguished upon her death.\nHowever,  the  allowance  for  substitution  of  parties  contained  within  Rule  25  is  not\ncompulsory.3  The advisory committee note to the 1963 amendment states as follows:\n“A  motion  to  substitute  made  within  the  prescribed  time  will\nordinarily be granted, but under the permissive language of the first\nsentence of the amended rule (“the court may order”) it may be\ndenied by the court in the exercise of a sound discretion if made long\nafter the death– as can occur if the suggestion of death is not made or\nis delayed - and circumstances have arisen rendering it unfair to allow\nsubstitution.  Cf.   Anderson v. Yungkau, [329 U. S. 482, 486, 67 S.\nCt. 428, 430, 431, 91 L.Ed. 436 (1947)], where it was noted under the\npresent rule that settlement and distribution of the estate of a deceased\n2 Based upon a review of the Court’s docket, the death of Plaintiff, Donna Quarles was not\nsuggested upon the Court as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a)(1) prior to the filing of Plaintiffs’\noriginal motion for substitution.\n3 A prior version of Rule 25 required the substitution of parties to be made within two (2)\nyears of the parties death.\n4\n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 225-1     Filed 04/11/2006     Page 7 of 8(cid:10)\ndefendant might be so far advanced as to warrant denial of a motion\nfor substitution even through made within the time limit prescribed\nby the rule.  Accordingly, a party interested in securing substitution\nunder  the  amended  rule  should  not  assume  that  he  can  rest\nindefinitely awaiting the suggestion of death before he makes his\nmotion to substitute.”\nIn the present case, both the substance of the claims brought by Ms. Quarles as well as\nPlaintiffs’ delay in filing a motion to substitute party merit this court exercising its discretion to deny\nthe motion.  \nIt is undisputed that Donna Quarles passed away on or about September 17, 2003.  It is\npresumed that Plaintiffs’ counsel was advised of Ms. Quarles passing shortly thereafter.  Although\nPlaintiffs’ counsel did not indicate the specific date they were advised of Ms. Quarles’ passing, the\ninformation was likely relayed in 2003.  It is further undisputed that more than two (2) years passed\nwithout an attempt to substitute a party for Ms. Quarles or to establish an estate on her behalf. \nFollowing the denial of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Action status on November 21, 2005,\nPlaintiffs were aware or should have been aware of the need to proceed with resolving the only\nremaining issues in the case, damages.  Despite several conferences with the Court and between the\nparties, Plaintiffs’ made no attempt to move for substitution of party with respect to Ms. Quarles\nuntil the filing of the initial motion on or about February 9, 2006.  In fact, the motion came after the\nparties participated in a Court-ordered Settlement Conference on February 6, 2006, and after\nPlaintiffs advised that Ms. Quarles would be dismissed as a Plaintiff.  (See Exh. B).  Having failed\nto present any justification for the more than two (2) year delay in either opening an Estate or\nproceeding with a Motion for Substitution of Party, Plaintiffs’ Motion should be considered untimely\nand denied.\n5\n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 225-1     Filed 04/11/2006     Page 8 of 8(cid:10)\nFinally, the nature of Ms. Quarles’ claim for damages merits the Court exercising its\ndiscretion to deny Plaintiffs’ motion.  Based upon previous rulings, Plaintiffs are not entitled to\npunitive damages.  Therefore, any award must be based on actual damages.  Although her discovery\ndeposition was taken, it provides little if no basis for an award of money damages.  (See Exh. A).\nConsequently, because Plaintiffs have made no claims for economic losses and have no evidence of\nactual damages, any attempt to quantify the damages suffered by Ms. Quarles as a result of her brief\ndetention in administrative segregation would be purely speculative without her presence.4 \nWherefore, Defendants respectfully request this Honorable Court DENY Plaintiffs’ Motion,\nand dismiss the claims brought by Plaintiff Donna Quarles.  \nRespectfully submitted,\n         O’CONNOR, DeGRAZIA, TAMM & O’CONNOR, P.C.\n                                                  By: /S/ JAMES E.

Additionally, the law applicable to the facts established \ndo not show that a constitutional violation occurred.  Applicable precedent provides that it is \nnot a violation of a Plaintiffs'  rights  to require them to disrobe prior to being placed in \nadministrative segregation for their own safety, for the safety other detainees, for the safety \nof jail employees, and for the internal security and the orderly operation of the jail. \nFACTS \nA.  Background \nSaginaw County Jail  is a detention facility operated by  Saginaw County to detain \narrestees and sentenced offenders.  The facility holds five hundred twenty-five (525) people \nmaximum.  The jail processes between forty (40) and sixty (60) individuals per day that are \ndelivered to the facility by County, City, Township and State Police personnel.  The Saginaw \nCounty Jail books between twelve thousand (12,000) and fourteen thousand (14,000)  people \nper year.  In the present case, Plaintiffs were processed through the Saginaw County Jail \nbetween the period of May 22, 1999 through December 29, 2001.  During this time, over \nthirty thousand (30,000) persons were processed through the jail.  The twenty-seven (27) \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 8 of 36(cid:10)\n,\"-'''' \nPlaintiffs represent less  than  1I100th of one percent of the total  processed  through the \nSaginaw County Jail during that time period. \nB.  The Policy \nIn  their  brief  in  support  of  their  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment,  Plaintiffs' \nmiscategorized the deposition testimony and other evidence to date which describes the policy \nof the Saginaw County Jail.  The current administrator of the Saginaw County Jail,  Lt. \nWilliam Gutzwiller testified as follows: \nQ:  And that policy was what? \nA:  That if an individual, not just because they're disruptive \nor disorderly, if they violate the security measures of that \njail, or pose harm to themselves or others, the correction \nofficer could  request from  the  Sergeant permission to \nescort the person to segregation administration. \nQ:  And once that-\nA:  It has to be approved by the administrator. \n(Exhibit A, p. 33) \nPlaintiffs attempt to characterize the policy by stating \"the Defendants have a formal policy \nand/or custom  that requires  mostly  shift sergeants,  to  strip  naked  pretrial detainees  for \ninsubordination or other alleged acts of deviance.\"  (Plaintiffs' brief, p. 1).  This allegation \nis at odds with the very testimony referenced in Plaintiffs' brief.  It is especially important to \nnote that a detainees' clothes are forcefully removed only if they do not voluntarily comply \nwith jail personnel orders to remove the clothes prior to entering administrative segregation. \nSgt. Gary Van Riper testified: \n2 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 9 of 36(cid:10)\nClothes would be removed from a person if they did not want \nthem taken off because that's what -the ruling from the command \nor the policy, however you want to look at it, I guess, stated, that \nthey would go in there with no clothes on, yes. \n(Exhibit B, p. 21) \nThe policy of the Saginaw County Jail is to place disruptive, disorderly persons, persons who \nviolate the security measures of the jail, or those who pose harm to themselves or others in \nadministrative segregation.  If the detainee refuses to comply with jail personnel's request to \nremove his clothes prior to entering administrative segregation, the amount of force necessary \nto remove his clothes would be used to accomplish the objective. \nLt. Gutzwiller further clarified the criteria for placing a detainee into administrative \nsegregation. \nThe description,  basically, and it is  in policy,  if anyone that \ndisrupts the security of the jail, anyone that is assaultive, not only \ntowards themselves or towards another or towards  staff, that \nwould disrupt the orderly operation of the jail. \n(Exhibit A, p. 69). \nThe record indicates that only a detainee who disrupts the security of the jail, disrupts the \norderly operation of the jail, or is assaultive towards themselves, towards another detainee, \nor towards staff, is placed in administrative segregation. \nIf a detainee  fails  to  comply  with orders  to  remove his  or her clothing prior to \nplacement in the administrative segregation cell, limited force is administered to remove the \nclothes.  Sgt. Van Riper testified that he would use  \"only the force necessary to do it.\" \n(Exhibit B, p. 21).  Additionally, Sgt. Van Riper testified that the only time a male officer \n3 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 10 of 36(cid:10)\nwould assist in the removal of female detainee's clothes is if the female detainee threatens the \nfemale officer's safety.  Sgt. Van Riper testified: \nThe only time a male would be present when a female was taking \noff her clothes is if she became violent to the point where the \nfemale officer's safety was in danger. \n(Exhibit B, p. 22) \nA male officer only participates in the forceful disrobing of a female detainee when the female \nofficer's safety is in danger. \nA detainee remains in administrative segregation until such time that he no longer poses \na threat to himself, others, jail staff, or the security operations of the jail.  Sheriff Charles \nBrown stated: \nIt's taking away the chance that that person may hurt themselves \nor somebody else, and once they sober up or once they become \ncognizant of what they're doing, you may have saved that person \nfrom tremendous injury. \n(Exhibit C, p. 49). \nThe amount of time in the segregation cell is limited to such time when the detainee shows that \nhe or she is no longer a security threat to the jail, its personnel, other detainees or themselves. \nC.  Basis of Policy \nIn 1996,  the Saginaw County Jail suffered a tragic  incident in  which an inmate, \nLaurence Riha, was placed into administrative segregation with his orange jail uniform.  Mr. \nRiha was able to wedge his jail uniform into the very small space between the cell door and \nthe door frame and to hang himself utilizing this method.  After the suicide, the policy was \n4 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 11 of 36(cid:10)\n\" \n;\"\" \nissued that required any inmate who was placed into the administrative segregation would be \nwithout clothing.  (Exhibit D, No. 16). \nSheriff Brown further testified about the justification for maintaining the policy of \nplacing detainees into administrative segregation without their clothes: \nQ:  How does taking a person's clothing and leaving them \nnude  in  an  administrative  ceIl  prevent,  you  use  the \nwording  hanging  or  prevent  them  from  hurting \nthemselves? \nA:  You serious with this question? \nQ:  I'm serious. \nA:  That's  how  most hangings  occur  in  the  jail  with  the \ninmates clothing. \nQ:  Okay. What other harm can they do to themselves in the \njail if they stiII have their clothes on? \nA:  They could do a lot of things.  They can obviously stuff \nit down their throat, they can obviously hang themselves, \nthey urinate on their clothing and throw it at the deputies, \ndefecate on it and throw it at the deputies, which has been \ndone many times, they could actuaIlY use the clothing to, \nif the guard got close enough, to wrap it around his neck. \nA lot of things you could do with clothing.  You've got to \nremember,  these  are  the  most  disruptive  of alI  the \nprisoners that come in here. \n(Exhibit C, pp. 61-62) \nThe answers to interrogatories and the deposition testimony make clear that the Saginaw \nCounty Sheriffs Department has justification for requiring detainees to remove their clothing \nprior to their placement into administrative segregation. \nThe opinions of the jail practice experts support Defendants' policy.  Jail expert, \nDarreIl Ross, Ph.D. wrote in his 26(a)(2) report: \n5 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 12 of 36(cid:10)\n, \n./ \nThat the procedure of placing detainees  in  the  administrative \nsegregation  who  demonstrated  disruptive,  combativeness, \nagitation,  intoxication,  and/or  violent  behavior,  and/or  who \nthreaten  the  security  of  the  facility,  including  harming \nthemselves, detention personnel, and/or  other prisoners of the \nSaginaw  Detention  Facility,  comports  with  a  legitimate  and \nreasonable detention objective ... \n*  *  * \nThat  placing  a  detainee  for  a  limited  duration  under  close \nsupervision, in the nude, in an administrative segregation cell, is \na  reasonable  alternative  legitimately  related  to  detention  of \nobjectives.  (Exhibit E, p. 3). \nDr. Darrell Ross supports the Saginaw County Jail practice.  (Dr. Ross' CV, Exhibit E). \nAnother expert, Peter R. Wilson, stated in his 26(a)(2) report: \nBy removing their clothing a greater degree of protection was \nprovided to the inmates.  It is clear that the officers intention was \nonly to provide a safe environment for the plaintiffs.  . .. The \nremoval  of the  clothing  prevents  the  pre-trial detainees  from \ndisrupting the operation of the jail. \n(Exhibit F, p. 1). \nFurther, Mr. Wilson stated: \nBased upon my experience in the Wayne County Jail,  inmates \nthat are assigned to a segregation cell are at a higher risk of \ninjuring themselves .... \n*  *  * \nA review of the jail incident reports point out clearly that many \ninmates are very manipulative, abusive toward staff, irrational \nand disruptive.  Inmate behavior is very difficult to deal with and \nvery  unpredictable.  Removing  an  inmate's  clothing  is  an \nextraordinary measure, however necessary, to order to keep the \ninmates safe. \n(Exhibit F, p. 2 and Wilson's CV attached to Exhibit F.). \n6 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 13 of 36(cid:10)\nThe  testimony  and  documentary  evidence  in  the  present  case  indicates  that  there  was \njustification for the policies concerning the administrative segregation. \nD.  Video and observation \nThe administrative segregation cell is constructed in a such a way as to preclude the \nviewing of detainees unless the officer was in the cell with the detainee.  There are two (2) \ndoors to the segregation cell.  The inner door is covered with wired mesh.  This wired mesh \nprecludes viewing of the detainee by the correction officer.  (Exhibit B, p. 25). \nThe only way to obtain an unobstructed view of the detainee is to look through the food \nslot which is approximately waist high.  (Exhibit B, p. 29.).  However, officers do not usually \nwillingly stick their face near the feeding slot because of the fear of getting something thrown \nat them.  (ExhibitB, p. 25).  Officers monitor the administrative segregation cell every fifteen \n(15) minutes in order to check on the detainee's well being.  An officer conducting the fifteen \n(15) minute watch does so verbally and does not look into the feeding slot unless no verbal \nacknowledgment is made.  (Exhibit A, p. 89). \nA video monitoring device was installed in the administrative segregation in December \nof 2000.  (Exhibit A, p.).  Therefore, a majority of Plaintiffs were not video taped during \ntheir detention.  No officer is assigned to monitor the video, (Exhibit A, pp. 86-87).  Trustees \nare not permitted to monitor the cameras.  (Exbibit A, p. 98).  The quality of the tape is such \nthat one cannot see bodily detail.  They are used only to ensure that the inmates are not in \ndistress.  Video tapes are destroyed within thirty (30) days after they are made. \n7 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 14 of 36(cid:10)\nE.  Plaintiffs \nPlaintiffs were all processed through the Saginaw County Jail between the period of \nMay 22, 1999 and December 29, 2001.  Because Plaintiffs move for summary judgment of \nliability as to all Plaintiffs and did not provide how the application of the policy differs to each \nPlaintiff, Defendants will not give details as to each incident which gives rise to Plaintiffs' \nclaim.  Plaintiffs  stated:  \"The  only  issue  present  is  whether  Defendants'  strip  seizure \npolicies/customs is unconstitutional and thereby entitling Plaintiffs to Summary Judgment.\" \n(Plaintiffs' Brief, p. 10). \nHowever, one incident report may be useful to provide background information to the \nCourt in evaluating Plaintiffs' claims. \nJennifer Cradit was brought to the Saginaw County Jail  intake department by the \nSaginaw City Police Department.  The incident report concerning Ms. Cradit's admission \nstates: \nOn July 17, 1999, at 02:30 hours this sIc was in intake when the \nCity  P.O.  brought  in  a  disorderly  female,  named  Cradit, \nJennifer, #115834.  Cradit was placed in observation cell, #2 \nafter stating  \"fuck you\"  to  all  of the  staff present in  intake. \nWhile in this observation cell #2 inmate Cradit pounded and \nkicked the glass window and door.  This rIo and other staff tried \nto calm inmate Cradit to no avail.  Cradit would only state that \nshe wanted to use the phone and then would tell the whole staff \nto \"fuck you\". \nCradit then proceeded to stuff toilet paper in the toilet and flush \nit until it flooded over.  This sIc and Deputies Brown, Kolb and \nThorn entered the cell  to  remove the  paper.  This was done \nwithout incident. \n8 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 15 of 36(cid:10)\n' \n/ \nI \nTwo minutes later inmate Cradit was placing her jean shorts in \nthe  toilet and  flooding  the  cell  again.  Again,  these  officers \nentered the cell to remove the shorts and to place Cradit in an \nadministrative segregation cell as she was taking off her clothing \nand  disrupting  the jail procedures.  Cradit was  given every \nopportunity to calm down.  (Exhibit F, p. 1). \nThe jail incident report indicates that Plaintiff Cradit was not only verbally abusive to staff but \ndisruptive to the jail operations and threatened other inmates by flooding the toilet in the \nholding cell twice, one time by removing her own shorts and placing them in the toilet.  When \nPlaintiff Cradit was removed to administrative segregation, she \"threatened to kill all the \nofficers 'when she sees us in the streets ...'   (Exhibit F, p. 1).  Numerous correction officers \nand  medical  personnel  were  required  to  subdue  Inmate Cradit in  order  to  place  her  in \nadministrative segregation without her clothing.  During this time, Plaintiff Cradit attempted \nto bite several of officers.  (Exhibit F, pp. 1-2) .. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nPlaintiffs have moved for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. of Civil Proc. 56(c). \nThis rule provides that judgment may be entered if a party opposing the motion will not be \nable to produce sufficient evidence at trial to withstand a motion for directed verdict.  Street \nv J.C. Bradford & Co., 886 F.2d. 1472 (6''' Cir. 1989).  The Sixth Circuit utilizes several \nfactors to guide courts in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate in a given \ncase.  Some of these factors, include: \n3.  The movant must meet the initial burden of showing  'the \nabsence  of a  genuine  issue  of material  fact'  as  to  essential \nelement of the non-movant's case. \n9 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 16 of 36(cid:10)\n\" , \n, \n4.  This burden may be met by pointing out to the court that the \nrespondent, having had sufficient opportunity for discovery, has \nno evidence to support an essential element of his or her case. \n*  *  * \n7.  The substantive law governing the case will determine what \nissues of fact are material, ... Id. at 1479. \nTherefore,  in moving for summary judgment, a party must show that the respondent will not \nbe able produce any evidence sufficient to withstand a motion for directed verdict at trial.  The \nmovant must meet the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact \nin the record.  These issues of material fact are governed by the substantive law governing the \ncase. \nIn the present case, summary judgment is inappropriate because Plaintiffs have failed \nto meet their initial burden of showing that there is an absence of a genuine issue of material \nfact.  Defendants have also met their burden by showing that there is sufficient evidence to \nsubmit to a trier of fact in their case.  Moreover, opportunities for further discovery, including \nthe expert discovery, will likely yield evidence favorable to Defendants on the material facts \nof the instant matter. \nLAW AND ARGUMENT \nI.  MUNICIPAL LIABILITY \nAs is made clear by the United States Supreme Court, the failure to train theory is only \nrelevant  to  the  second  element of a  § 1983  action,  and  not  the  threshold  element of a \nconstitutional deprivation.  The failure to train theory is utilized by Plaintiffs who wish to \n10 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 17 of 36(cid:10)\n(  , \nshow that a municipal corporation is responsible for a constitutional deprivation caused by one \nof its employees. Municipal liability in a 1983 action is unique because \"[rjespondeat superior \nor vicarious liability will not attach under §1983.\"  Canton v Harris, 489 US 378, 385; 109 \nS Ct 197; 103 L Ed 2d 412 (1989).  Therefore, because Defendants base this response on \ntheir showing that Plaintiffs have not stated a claim for,  nor can they show by any of the \nundisputed facts, that they suffered a constitutional deprivation, this failure to train element \nof municipal liability is not material to the present motion. \nIn Collins v Harker Heights, 503 US 115; 112 S Ct 1061; 117 L Ed 2d 261 (1992), \nthe United States Supreme Court made clear that the constitutional deprivation element of a \n§ 1983 action is separate and distinct from the issue of whether or not a municipal corporation \nmay be held responsible for such underlying constitutional deprivation.  The Collins Court \nstated held that a section 1983 action against a municipality requires analysis of two distinct \nissues:  \"(1) whether Plaintiffs harm was caused by constitutional violation, and (2) if so, \nwhether the City is responsible for that violation.\" [d. at 120.  Thus, in Collins, the Court \nemphasized the importance of distinguishing between the element of a constitutional violation \nand the element of whether or not the City is responsible for that violation. \nIn Collins, supra, Plaintiff s decedent was an employee in the sanitation department of \nthe City of Harker Heights, Texas.  Mr. Collins died of asphyxia after entering a manhole to \nunstop a sewer line.  [d.  at 117.  Plaintiff claimed that the City had violated Mr. Collins' \nconstitutional right by \"following a custom and policy of not training its employees about the \n11 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 18 of 36(cid:10)\ndangers of working in sewer lines and manholes ... \"  Id.  In reviewing its prior decisions on \nthe issue of municipal liability the court noted: \nIn each of those cases the Court assumed that a constitutional \nviolation had been adequately alleged or proved and focused its \nattention on the separate issue of municipal liability .  Id. at 121. \nThe Collins Court cited Monell v New York City Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. \n658; 98 S Ct. 2018; 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978), Oklahoma City v Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808; 105 \nS. Ct. 2427; 85 L. Ed. 2d 791  (1985) and Canton  v Harris,  supra for  the purposes of \nillustrating that each of those cases addressed only the issue of municipal liability and assumed \nthat  in  fact  a  constitutional  violation  had  been committed by  one  of the  governmental \nemployees.  The Collins Court noted: \n. ..  We concluded that if a City employee violates another's \nconstitutional rights, the City may be liable if it had a policy or \ncustom of failing to train its employees and that failure to train \ncaused  the  constitutional  violation.  Id.  at 123.  (emphasis \nprovided). \nTherefore, a plaintiffs allegations that a municipality failed to train its employees is only \nactionable if a governmental employee in fact caused a constitutional violation.  If there is no \nsuch underlying constitutional violation committed by an employee, whether or not a City \npolicy caused that conduct is simply irrelevant.  As the Supreme Court succinctly stated in an \nearlier decision: \nNeither Monell,  supra nor any other of our cases authorizes the \naward of damages against a municipal corporation based on the \nactions of one of its officers when in fact the jury has concluded that \nthe officer inflicted no constitutional harm.  Los Angeles v Heller, \n475 US 796, 799; 106 S Ct 1571; 89 L Ed 2d 806 (1986). \n12 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 19 of 36(cid:10)\nIf an officer does not deprive a person of his constitutional rights, the issue of whether or not a \nmunicipality can be said to have caused the actions of the officer is irrelevant to a determination \nof a claim under §1983.  In other words, the cases under Monell and Harris, supra answer the \nquestion \"who is liable for a constitutional deprivation\" committed by a government officer, not \nthe question, \"did Plaintiff suffer a constitutional deprivation.\" \nIn Collins, the United States Supreme Court found that dismissal of Plaintiffs claims \nwas proper where Plaintiff did not allege that a violation of the due process clause of the \nconstitution. \nIn the  present case,  a  finding  of municipal  liability  on  Plaintiffs'  motion  is  not \nappropriate because they have failed to show that they suffered a constitutional deprivation. \nAs shown infra, there is at least a genuine issue of material fact that Saginaw County, jail \nregulations are reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives. \nII.  CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION \nPlaintiffs alternately argue that Defendants' practice relating to the administrative \nsegregation cell violates their Fourth Amendment protection to be free from unreasonable . \nseizures, their Fourth Amendment right to privacy, their Fourteenth Amendment right to be \nfree from punishment prior to adjudication of gUilt in violation of the Due Process Clause, and \ntheir  Fourteenth Amendment right  to substantive due process.  Each allegation will  be \ndiscussed in turn. \n13 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 20 of 36(cid:10)\n\" , \nA.  Unreasonable seizure \nPlaintiffs first argue that their placement into administrative segregation violates their \nright to be free from unreasonable seizures pursuant to the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution.  While they cite no authority for their argument (and Defendants have \nfound  none),  they  urge  this  Court to  rule  that  Plaintiffs'  placement  into  administrative \nsegregation in a state of nudity violates the Fourth Amendment. \nPlaintiffs concede that \"Defendants have probable cause to seize Plaintiffs and detain \nthem in their jail.\" (Plaintiff's brief p. 10) Plaintiffs argue that when Plaintiffs' clothes were \nremoved, the seizure became unreasonable. Id.  This novel argument is necessitated by the \nfact that no precedent, binding or advisory, has found that facts similar to those in the instant \ncase amounts to unreasonable search.  Therefore, Plaintiffs look to the seizure provision in the \nFourth Amendment for their argument. \nPlaintiffs' properly cite Turnerv Safely, 482 U.S. 78; 107 S. Ct. 2254; 96 L. Ed. 2d 64 \n(1987) to provide the analytical structure for their claims.  In Turner, United States Supreme \nCourt considered the  constitutionality of regulations  issued  by  the  Missouri Division of \nCorrections relating to inmate marriages and inmate-to-inmate correspondence.  The United \nStates Supreme Court rejected the strict scrutiny analysis utilized by the Court of Appeals, \nholding \"that a lesser standard of scrutiny is appropriate in determining the constitutionality \nof the prison rules.\"  Id. at 81. \nThe Turner Court, noted several principles \"that necessarily frame our analysis of \nprisoners' constitutional claims.\" Id. at 84.  The Supreme Court noted: \n14 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 21 of 36(cid:10)\n, \n/ \n... [C]ourts are ill equipped to deal with increasingly urgent \nproblems  of present  administration  and  reform  .  .  .  [T]he \nproblems of prisons in America are complex and intractable and, \nmore to the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution \nby  decree.  Running  a  prison  is  an  inordinately  difficult \nundertaking  that  requires  expertise,  planning,  and  the \ncommitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the \nprovidence  of  the  legislative  and  executive  branches  of \ngovernment.  Prison administration is, moreover, a task that has \nbeen committed  to  the  responsibility  of those  branches,  and \nseparation  of powers  concerns  counsel  a  policy  of judicial \nrestraint.  Where a state penal system is involved, federal courts \nhave ... additional reason to accord deference to appropriate \nprison authorities. Id. at 84-85. (internal quotations and citations \nomitted). \nOne principle underlying federal jurisprudence or prison and jail practices is to defer to the \nproper branches of government the task of jail and prison administration.  The Turner Court \nthen enunciated the proper standard for analyzing that a prison regulation violates an inmate's \nconstitutional rights. \n[W]hen  a  prison  regulation  impinges  on  inmates' \nconstitutional rights,  the regulation is valid if it is reasonably \nrelated to legitimate penological interests ... Subjecting the day \nto-day jUdgments of prison officials to an inflexible strict scrutiny \nanalysis  would  seriously· hamper  their  ability  to  anticipate \nsecurity  problems  and  to  adopt  innotative  solutions  to  the \nintractable problems of prison administration.  The rule would \nalso distort the decisionmaking process, for every administrative \njudgment would be  subject to  the possibility  that some court \nsomewhere would conclude that it had a less restrictive way of \nsolving the problem at hand.  Courts inevitably would become \nthe primary arbiters of what constitutes the best solution to every \nadministrative problem, thereby unnecessarily perpetuat[ing] the \ninvolvement  of  the  federal  courts  in  affairs  of  prison \nadministration.  Id.  at 89  (internal  quotations  and  citations \nomitted). \n15 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 22 of 36(cid:10)\n.' , \nTherefore, the proper analysis for Plaintiffs' claims of constitutional violations is to determine \nif the regulation at issue, the placement of Plaintiffs who are a threat to themselves, other \ninmates, and jail staff and who threaten the internal security and operations of the jail, without \nclothing is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.  As will be discussed infra, \nthe record in the instant matter demonstrates that the only testimony regarding this issue is by \nDefendants and their expert reports which indicate that Saginaw County's policies satisfy this \nstandard. \nPlaintiffs properly cite the factors  relevant in determining the reasonableness of a \nregulation.  These factors are: (1) whether there is a valid, rational connection between the \nprison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it, (2) whether \nthere are alternatives means of exercising the right that remains open to prison inmates, (3) \nthe impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other \ninmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally, and (4) the absence of ready \nalternatives is evidence of reasonableness of a prison regulation.  Id. at 89-91. \nIt is noteworthy that the Turner court relied on Bell v Wolfish, 441 U.S.520; 99 S.Ct. \n1861; 60 L.Ed. 2d 447 (1979)(attached as EXHIBIT H), in support of their holding in \nTurner. Bell, supra, involves numerous conditions of confinement and practices in a federally \noperated short-term custodial facility which was used to house pretrial detainees.  One of those \npractices  involved  the  requirement of detainees  to  expose their body cavities for  visual \ninspection as part of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from \noutside the institution.  Id. at 558. \n16 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 23 of 36(cid:10)\nThe Supreme Court held: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not \ncapable of precise definition or mechanical application.  In each \ncase it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search \nagainst the  invasion of personal rights that the search entails. \nCourts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the \nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, \nand a place in which it is conducted.  Id. at 559. \nThe Supreme Court found: \n... we deal here with the question whether visual body-cavity \ninspections  as  contemplated  by  the  MCC  rules  can  ever be \nconducted on less than probable cause.  Balancing the significant \nand  legitimate security  interests of the  institution against  the \nprivacy interests of the inmates, we conclude that they can. \nId. at 560 (emphasis and original). \nIn  the  Bell case,  the  United  States Supreme  Court concluded that a visual  body-cavity \ninspection of all inmates after visitations did not violate their Fourth Amendment rights.  The \ncourts considered that the detention facility's interest in maintaining the security of the facility \nwas  properly  balanced  against  the  invasion  of the  privacy  interest  under  the  Fourth \nAmendment of the inmates. \nThe only Court of Appeals decision considered the propriety of placing a detainee in \nsegregation without clothing has found that the practice did not violate the constitutional rights \nof the detainee.  In Hill v McKinley, 311 F.3d. 599 (8'\" Cir. 2002)(attached as EXHIBIT I), \nplaintiff was arrested for public intoxication in Nevada, Iowa.  Id. at 901.  Plaintiff Hill was \nuncooperative during the booking process, \"yelling and cursing at [the correction officers]. \nThe officers placed Hill in a holding cell, where she pounded and kicked at the door of the \n17 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 24 of 36(cid:10)\ncell.\"  Id. These facts are strikingly similar to many of the facts presented by  Plaintiffs' \nclaims.  Noting this behavior, the correction officers in Hill decided to place plaintiff in the \njail's padded cell. Id.  The jail policy provided that prisoners are not allowed to wear normal \nclothing but instead must wear a paper gown or nothing at all.  Id. Plaintiff was placed naked \ninto the padded cell.  Id.  Hill argued, among other allegations, that her constitutional rights \nwere violated when she was required to disrobe in the presence of a male correction officer. \nHowever,  the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeal rejected her argument.  The Circuit Court \nstated: \nEven if it was a male guard, however, we cannot say in light of \nprecedent that it is a violation of a prisoner's Fourth Amendment \nprivacy rights  for a male guard to require a loud and violent \nfemale prisoner to disrobe in his presence before placing her in \na padded cell for her own safety.  Id. at 903. \nThe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found tlmt no constitutional violation occurred when a \nloud, violent and abusive pre-trial detainee was placed in a padded cell without any clothing \nin the presence of male correction officers. \nIn the present case, the policy used to place Plaintiffs into administrative segregation \nWitllOut their clothing satisfies the standard of Turner, supra, Bell, supra, and Hill, supra. \nThe facts and the record show that the regulation utilized by Defendants' in the instant matter \nis reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.  The record illustrates that the policy \nwas implemented following an inmate suicide who utilized his clothing in the administrative \nsegregation cell.  (EXHIBIT D, No. 16). \n18 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 25 of 36(cid:10)\nThe policy was implemented to prevent harm that disruptive inmates may cause to \nthemselves, other inmates, and jail staff.  The policy furthers security interests of the jail and \nfurthers the orderly operations of the jail.  Clothing is removed so that prisoners cannot stuff \nit down their throat, hang themselves, urinate on their clothing, defecate on their clothing, and \nthrow it at the deputies, or to attack a corrections officer.  The expert reports submitted by \n. Defendants' two jail practices experts, show that the inmates placed into the segregation cell \nare at a high risk of injuring themselves.  (EXHIBIT F, p. 2)  Further, expert Dr. Ross \nindicated that the placement of the detainee for limited duration in the nude in the segregation \ncell is a reasonable alternative that is reasonably related to the detention objective of the jail. \n(EXHIBIT E, p. 3). \nPlaintiffs  do  not  put forth  any  proof that  the  regulation  of the Saginaw County \nDetention Facility is not rationally related to a legitimate detention objective.  Plaintiffs rely \non Defendants'  subsequent remedial  measure of issuing a paper gown to  inmates.  This \npractice cannot be used as evidence in the instant action.  F.R.E. 407.  Defendants intend to \noffer evidence of jail practice experts and of Defendants that the paper gown does not further \nthe objectives of the Saginaw County Jail Detention Facility as well as placing an inmate with \nno clothes in administrative segregation.  A paper gown can be used to fashion a rope, flood \nthe toilet, project feces or urine at a corrections officer, or attack jail staff. \nAdditionally, the language of Turner, supra, counsels that the test of reasonableness \nis not a \"least restrictive alternative\" test.  Turner,  supra, at 91. A Court may consider a \nclaimant's alternative which accommodates a prisoner's rights only if there is a \"de minimus \n19 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 26 of 36(cid:10)\n/\"' .... , \ncost to valid penological interests.\"  Id.  As indicated, supra, the issuance of a paper gown \nto a prisoner in the administrative segregation is done at a great cost to the valid interests of \nthe Saginaw County Detention Facility for safeguarding inmates from harming themselves, \nother detainees and the jail staff.  Additionally, the issuance of a paper gown does not fully \naccommodate Plaintiffs' rights claimed in the instant case.  In order to change into a paper \ngown, Plaintiffs would be required to disrobe.  If they refused, Defendants' staff would have \nto use the force necessary to change the detainee into the paper gown.  Plaintiffs would likely \nclaim  that  this  then  would  violate  their  privacy  or  would  convert  the  seizure  into  a \n\"unreasonable seizure.\" \nBecause the record provides at least a genuine issue of fact on the material question of \nwhether the policy is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives, Plaintiffs' motion \nfor judgment on the issue of liability must be denied. \nB.  Right to privacy \nPlaintiffs allege  that their Fourth Amendment rights  to privacy under  the  Fourth \nAmendment were  violated  by  Saginaw County.  (Plaintiffs'  Brief,  pp.  13-15).  These \nallegations are unsupported by the case law. \nIn the case cited by Plaintiffs, Cornwell v Dahlberg, 963 F.2d. 912 (6'\" Cir. 1992), the \nCourt found that the Turner, supra test was applicable to the claim.  Cornwell, supra, at 916-\n917.  Thus, the Sixth Circuit found that the jury should be instructed \"to find some valid, \nrational connection between the prison policy and a legitimate penological interest. ... \"  Id. \nat 917.  Utilizing this standard, the Sixth Circuit found that Cornwell raised a valid privacy \n20 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 27 of 36(cid:10)\n\"\"\"'.\" \nclaim under the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at 916.  The Cornwell panel did not find that a \nconstitutional deprivation occurred.  The Sixth Circuit determined, given the facts of the case, \nthat the issue should be submitted to the jury. \nThe facts in Cornwell differ significantly from the instant matter.  After participating \nin  a  sit-in,  Plaintiff was  detained  outside  and  forced  to  lie  in  a  cold,  muddy  area  in \ntemperatures that were between 40 and 44 degrees.  Id. at 914.  The strip searches were \nconducted before the corrections officers, before other participating inmates, and before any \ncorrections officer who happen to pass through the designated area.  Notably, prisoners were \ntaken inside the prison facility gymnasium prior to being forced to return to the outdoor area \nfor strip search. Id. at 914.  The Cornwell Court did not impose liability, but rather reversed \nthe judgment on the Fourth Amendment privacy claim and ordered for a new trial where the \njury may be instructed properly on the reasonably related standard.  Id. at 918. \nMoreover, since Cornwell, at least one court has held that a pretrial detainees' rights \nare not violated when monitored by a female guard.  In Johnson v Phelan, 69 F.3d 144 (7'\" \nCir. 1995), Judge Easterbrook held that it is not a violation of a prisoner's Fourth Amendment \nrights  to  be  viewed  and  monitored  by  correction  officers  of the  opposite  sex.  Judge \nEasterbrook held that pursuant to Hudson v Palmer, 468 U.S. 517; 104 S.Ct. 3194; L.Ed.2d \n393 (1984), \"privacy is the thing most surely extinguished by a judgment committing someone \nto prison.\"  Johnson, supra, at 146.  Since Cornwell, decisions in Michigan and other states \nhave provided that gender is not a bona fide occupational qualification for correction officers. \nEverson v Michigan Department of Corrections, 222 F.Supp.2d 864 (E.D. Mich. 2002). \n21 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 28 of 36(cid:10)\n' \n/ \nMoreover, as indicated, supra, the Turner, supra and Bell, supra, cases mandate that \nthis Court employ a \"reasonableness\" standard in evaluating the allegations of right to privacy \ninvasions in the instant case.  It is important to note that nothing in the policy provides that \nthe inmates be disrobed in front of other inmates.  Inmates are given an opportunity to disrobe \nvoluntarily in the segregation cell.  (EXHIBIT B).  The justification recited above is equally \napplicable to the invasion of Plaintiffs' privacy rights.  The regulations are reasonably related \nto  the interests  in preventing harm of the prisoners to themselves,  to other prisoners, to \ninmates and the disruption of jail security and internal operations.  These justifications are \nsupported in the record by expert reports and by deposition testimony.  These facts preclude \na summary judgment in Plaintiffs favor in the instant matter. \nC.  Policy as punishment. \nPlaintiffs next allege that Defendants' policy constitutes unconstitutional punishment \nprior to adjudication of gUilt.  (Plaintiffs' Brief, pp. 15-18).  This argument must also fail \nbecause it is not supported by the cases.  Bell v Wolfish, supra, provides the standards by \nwhich a claim of Eighth Amendment violations must be judged.  The Court stated: \nA  court  must  decide  whether  the  disability  is \nimposed for the purpose of punishment or whether \nit  is  but  an  incident  of some  other  legitimate \ngovernmental purpose.  Absent a showing of an \nexpressed intent to punish on the part of detention \nfacility officials, that determination generally will \nturn on \"whether an alternative purpose to which \n[the  restriction]  may  rationally  be connected  is \nassignable for it, and whether it appears excessive \nin relation to the alternative purpose assigned [to \nit].  Thus, if a particular condition or restriction of \n22 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 29 of 36(cid:10)\n/  -, \npretrial  detention  is  reasonably  related  to  a \nlegitimate  governmental  objective,  it  does  not, \nwithout  more,  amount  to  \"punishment. \" \nConversely,  if a  restriction  or condition  is  not \nreasonably  related  to  a  legitimate goal--if it  is \narbitrary or purposeless--a court permissively may \ninfer that the purpose of the governmental action \nis  punishment that  may  not  constitutionally  be \ninflicted  upon detainees  qua  detainees.  Courts \nmust be mindful that these inquiries spring from \nconstitutional  requirements  and  that  judicial \nanswers to them must reflect that fact rather than \na court's idea of how best to operate a detention \nfacility.  Id. 441 U.S. at 538-539. \nThe Bell Court utilizes a reasonable relationship test to determine if a restriction is imposed \nfor punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  As indicated above, the testimony in \nthe instant case shows that the placement of the claimants in administrative segregation without \nclothing did reasonably relate to the legitimate governmental objective of maintaining safety \nof the detainees themselves, the safety of other detainees and staff and the orderly operation \nof the jail. \nPlaintiffs attempt to  argue  that Defendants'  concern of keeping  the  inmates  from \nharming themselves is a mere pretext.  (Plaintiffs' Brief, p. 17).  However, it must be noted \nthat prisoners who are disruptive to staff in and of itself, presents a risk of later harming \nthemselves by attempted suicide.  (EXHIBIT F, pp. 1-2).  Although, Defendants did not \nverbalize any suicidal ideations at intake, their combativeness, intoxication, and other factors \ndemonstrate that they risked harm to themselves.  Notably, the inmate who committed suicide \nin 1996 which gave rise to the instant policy did not express suicidal ideations prior to his \n23 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 30 of 36(cid:10)\nsuccessful suicide attempt.  Defendants justification for their policy is not that they were \nsuicidal, but that they were a threat to themselves as well as others, and to the internal security \nof the facility. \nLiability is  imposed upon government employees and governmental  units  when a \npretrial detainees' mental health needs are shown deliberate indifference by jail staff.  Molton \nv Cleveland, 839 F.2d. 240 (fJl. Cir. 1988); Comstock v McCrary, 273 F.3d. 693 (fJ\" Cir. \n2001).  The United States Supreme Court has made clear that once a person is incarcerated \nby  governmental  entity.  stripping  them  of virtually  every  means  of self-protection and \nforecloses access to outside aid. they are responsible for the well being of their detainees. \nFarmer v Brennan, 511 U.S. 825; 114 S.Ct. 1970; 128 L.Ed.2d 811  (1994).  Therefore, \nwhile not expressing suicidal intent, Plaintiffs by their disruptive behavior showed that they \nwere at a risk of harming themselves, other prisoners and staff.  They also showed that they \nwere capable of disruption of the orderly operation and security of the jail detention facility. \nTherefore, removing their clothing and placing the  inmates  in administrative segregation \nfurthered the legitimate governmental objectives of protecting these inmates, other inmates. \nand the jail detention facility itself. \nD.  Substantive due process. \nLastly. Plaintiffs claim that Defendants' actions violates substantive due process in that \nit shocks the consciousness of the Court pursuant to Rochin v California, 342 U. S. 165; 72 \nS.C!. 205; 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952).  This argument must also be denied because the undisputed \ntestimony of Defendants and the experts' opinions indicate that Defendants' actions were not \n24 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 31 of 36(cid:10)\narbitrary.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have cited no cases which would support their claim that \nDefendants' conduct was \"conscious shocking.\"  As demonstrated supra, the only Circuit \nCourt case addressing a situation similar to the instant matter has found that the practice of \nplacing a disruptive and violent inmate in a segregated cell in a state of nudity does not violate \nthe constitution.  Hill v McKinley,  311 F.3d 899 (8'\"  Cir.  2002).  Moreover, the record \nindicates that Defendants' actions were not arbitrary but rationally related to their legitimate \ninterests in maintaining the safety of inmates and staff and in maintaining the internal security \nand orderly operations of the jail facility.  For these reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for judgment \non the basis of substantive due process must be denied. \nIII.  QUALIFIED IMMUNITY \nIn civil suits for money damages, governmental officials acting in their official capacity \nare  entitled  to  qualified  immunity  for  discretionary  acts  which  do  not  violate  clearly \nestablished law of which a reasonable person would have known.  Anderson v Creighton, 43 \nU.S. 635; 107 S.Ct. 3034; 97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987).  The Supreme Court has recently stated \nthat assessment of whether an official is entitled to immunity involves a two part analysis:  (1) \nwhether the Plaintiff has alleged facts which, taken in light most favorable to him or her, show \nthat the official's conduct violated a constitutionally protected right; (2) if the first part has \nbeen  answered in the affirmative, courts must then determine whether the right was clearly \nestablished such that a reasonable official,  at the time the act was committed, would have \nunderstood that his behavior violated that right.  Saucier v Katz, 533 U.S. 194; 121 S.Ct. \n2151; 150 L.Ed.2d (2001). \n25 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 32 of 36(cid:10)\nFurther, it is important to note that the second part in the analysis must be undertaken \nin light of this specific context of the case, not as a broad, general proposition.\"  Id. at 121 \nS.Ct. at 2156. \nIn the instant case, as demonstrated above, Plaintiffs cannot meet the threshold inquiry \nof whether a constitutional violation occurred at all.  Therefore, Sheriff Brown is entitled to \nsummary judgment on the basis of qualified.immunity. Further, it must be noted that Plaintiffs \nhave failed to cite any case which holds that a reasonable official on May 22, 1999, would \nhave been aware that it was violation of a clearly  established right to place Plaintiffs in \nadministrative segregation without clothing.  As demonstrated in Hill, supra, the only Circuit \nCourt opinion to date addressing the very issue in the instant case has held that it is not a \nviolation of constitutional rights to place a pretrial detainee who is violent in the nude in a \nsecured cell.  Hill, supra, 311 F.3d. 899 (8''' Cir. 2002). \nThe closest case in the Sixth Circuit,  Cornwell v Dahlberg,  supra, is not specific \nenough to the facts in the instant case.  Further, Cornwell only established that Plaintiff stated \na claim given this specific facts of that case to a Fourth Amendment violation.  The panel did \nnot determine it was a violation of rights as such.  The court merely remanded for trial the \nquestion whether the practice was reasonably related to a legitimate penological objective. \nGiven these facts, Defendant, Sheriff Charles Brown respectfully requests Summary \nJudgment in his favor on the issue of qualified immunity. \n26 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 33 of 36(cid:10)\nIV.  ADMISSION OF LIABILITY \nPlaintiffs lastly argue that Defendants are estopped from denying liability. (Plaintiffs'Bricf, \np. 32).  However, this argument ignores the fact that, that issue was presented to the Court and \ndenied in an Order dated Oetober 10, 2002. \nThe very ease cited by Plaintiffs in support of their argument on liability, Dalla Corp. v \nAppeal Board ofMicJtigall EmploymelltSecllrity, 371 Mich 107; 123 NW2d 277 (1963) provides \nthat an admission is only binding once they have been received and approved by the Court.  Ill. at \n110.  Additionally, Michigan courts have held that a stipulation is binding until abandoned or \ndisaffirmed.  Nllriel v YOllllg Womell's Christiall Associatioll ofM  etropolitall Detroit, 186 Mich \nApp 141 (1990).  In the present case, there is no written stipulation submitted and approved by the \nCourt.  Any possible stipulation has disaffirmed shortly aller it was made. \nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, admissions are made in writing in response to \nRequest for Admissions. Fed. R. Civ. Proe. 36. Even under this rule, Courts have the discretion to \npermit the withdrawal of an admission.  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 36(b). The Court's discretion must be \nexercised in light of two (2) factors:  (1)  Whether the withdrawal will aid in the resolution of the \ncase, and (2) whether the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal \nor amendment will prejudice the party in maintaining the action or defense on the merits.  Kerry \nSteel, Illc. v Paragoll Illdustries, IIIC., 106 F.3d. 147 (6\"' Cir. 1997).  In the present case, no \nadmission has been made pursuant to their request for admissions pursuant to Rule 26.  Even if it \nhad been submitted pursuant to this rule, the court still has discretion to allow a withdrawal of \nadmissions. It will aid in the resolution of the case and Plaintiffs have failed to show the court that \nit withdrawal the admission, will prejudice the party. Plaintiffs have submitted no facts to show their \n27 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 34 of 36(cid:10)\nprejudice.  Additionally, allowing Defendants to contest liability will permit ajust and equitable \nresolution of the elaims filed by Plaintiffs. \nV.  IN.JUNCTIVE RELIEF \nWhen considering a motion for preliminary injunction, the Court must balanee four (4) \nfactors:  (I) the  movants'  likelihood of suecess in merits; (2) whether the movant will suffer \nirreparable injury  in the absence of a injunction; (3) whether an injunction will cause substantial \nharm to others; (4) whether the injunction will serve the public interest. G& V LOl/llge v Michigall \nLiqllor COlltrol Commissioll, 23 F.3d. 1071 (6'\" Cir. 1994).  In the instant case, regardless of the \nother factors, there is no showing that the Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of \nan injunction. \nIt is undisputed that the Saginaw County Detention Facility does not place detainees in the \nadministrative segregation cell without clothing.  They are now issued paper gowns.  (EXHIBIT \nA, p. 34).  Therefore, Plaintiffs have not shown they are entitled to injunctivc relief. \nWHEREFORE, for the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs have not shown that they have strong \nlikelihood of success on the merits. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs have failed to show that they are entitled to summary judgment on the issue of \nliability.  First, Plaintiffs have miseharaeterized the record on the contents of the very policy they \ndispute.  The deposition testimony of Defendants' employees indicates that there is a standard for \nplacement into administrative segregation and that the justification for placement lies in the threats \nof harm caused by Plaintiffs and the threats to the internal security and orderly operation of the jail. \n28 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 105     Filed 05/29/2003     Page 35 of 36(cid:10)\n..... \nWhile Plaintiffs were required to disrobe before entering the segregated facility, force was only \napplied if Plaintiffs refused to comply with the orders. \nFurther, the only facts in the record demonstrate that Defendants have shown that the practice \nof Saginaw County is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives.  Defendants should \nat least be able to develop this issue in further discovery of experts. \nFor all the reasons stated herein, Defendants respectfully request that Plaintiffs' Motion for \nSummary Judgment be denied. \nRespectfully· submitted, \nO'CONNOR, DeGRAZIA, TAMM & O'CONNOR, P.C. \nBy  ({VIM.  \"1.  ~ \nJAMES 1.

The parties dispute whether the plaintiffs are entitled to attorney’s\nfees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1988.  The plaintiffs and their counsel agree to waive a claim\nfor court awarded attorney’s fees and costs in exchange for the defendants agreeing to pay the\nplaintiffs’ counsel a fee equal to thirty-percent (30%) of the amount of each case settled or tried to\na conclusion subject to a cap in the amount of $400,000 on the total amount of attorney’s fees and\ncosts claimed by the plaintiffs.  Under no circumstances shall the recovery of attorney’s fees exceed\n$400,000 regardless of the total amount of settlements or judgments entered against the defendants.\nThe case evaluators will be informed that they are not to consider attorney’s fees as part of their\ndeliberation. The case evaluators shall not be advised of the agreement of the parties regarding\n-3-\n\nattorney’s fees. \n11. Equitable Relief.  This order shall not prevent the Court from ruling on any claim\nfor equitable relief raised at trial or by motion.\n12. This Agreement is binding on the parties, their heirs and assigns.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\ns/David M. Lawson                                     \nDAVID M.

Plaintiffs are informed that the \nFBI and the Department of Justice are conducting their own investigation, and Plaintiffs also are \nadvised that the County's own counsel decried Defendants' practices.2  Publicity has generated \ncommunications from numerous persons, and there is substantial likelihood that the County's \nown records will reveal others who have been victimized by the County's practices.3 \nUnder the  circumstances,  only class  certification  can  provide  substantial justice and \ncomplete  relief to  all  of Defendants'  victims  and  ensure  that  Defendants'  unconstitutional \nA  summary of the County's representations to  Plaintiffs and this  Court is  contained in the \nAffidavit of Christopher Pianto, which is being filed in support of this motion (\"Pianto Affidavit\"). \n2 \nIn a March 30,2005 article in the Saginaw News, reporter Joe Snapper wrote:  \"Saginaw County \nleaders had ample warning their jail policy of stripping unruly detainees was fertile ground for a major \nlawsuit, former Sheriff Tom McIntryre says.\"  Mr. Snapper also wrote:  \"But, McIntyre added, lawyer \nPeter C. Jensen's II-page opinion also advised the county to admit mistakes and settle before the number \nof plaintiffs - and damages - mushroomed.  Officials didn't listen.\"  (A copy of Mr. Snapper's article \nis attached as Exhibit A to the Pianto Affidavit.)  Plaintiffs' counsel has made repeated attempts to obtain \nthe Jensen memorandum through FOIA requests.  Those requests have been ignored by Defendants \nfurther demonstrating their callous refusal to provide pertinent evidence which would allow Plaintiffs to \nestablish the full extent of Defendants' unconstitutional practices.  Plaintiffs will now proceed through \nmore formal  discovery to obtain this memorandum and other evidence showing the County willfully \nignored its responsibilities to the victims of its unconstitutional policies.  Pianto Affidavit, ~ 1. \n3 \nPlaintiffs' counsel continues to investigate the extent of Defendants' unconstitutional practices. \nThe investigation to date, however, establishes that Defendants have seriously misrepresented the number \nof victims and the time frame of the unconstitutional practices.  See Pianto Affidavit and the attached \nsummary of evidence which is attached as Exhibit B to the Pianto Affidavit. \n\npractices will finally end.  Class certification is necessary and appropriate because only class \ncertification can overcome the effects of the Defendants' prior misrepresentations to the Court \nand ensure that all victims will have adequate time and resources to pursue their remedies: \nA.  Because there  is  strong  evidence  that  the  conditions  are  on-going,  the  Court \nshould certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2), F.R.Civ.P., so that it enter permanent \nclasswide injunctive relief to ensure that the County's unconstitutional practices \nin fact end. \nB.  Because  the  number  of persons  who  have  been  affected  by  the  County's \nunconstitutional  practices  are  far  greater than  originally suspected,  the  Court \nshould certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), so that the individuals who have been \nvictimized can only adequate monetary relief. \nC.  Class  certification  will  promote  judicial  economy  and  avoid  the  need  for \nnumerous individual actions; \nD.  Class  certification will  ensure that  all  victims receive  adequate representation \nbecause  it  will  protect  not  only  currently  identified  victims  but  will  allow \nadditional time to identify and give notice to remaining class members. \nE.  Denying class certification will not, as may sometimes be true, limit additional \nlitigation.  Plaintiffs now have evidence from more than 80 persons who could, if \nnecessary, file individual claims;4 and, if they did so, judicial economy would \ndictate that those individual claims be consolidated with the current claims. \nF.  None of these individual claims are barred by the statute of limitations: \na)  the commencement of this lawsuit tolled the statute of limitations for all \npersons who were within the original class definition on all claims which \nwere or could have been brought under the original claim until an order \ndenying class certification has been entered.  Crown,  Cork,  &  Seal Co., \nInc.  v.  Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 353-354 (1983) (quoting American Pipe & \nConstr. Co. v.  Utah, 414 U.S. 538,544 (1974)). \nb)  Even if the limitations period had not been tolled because it was filed as a \nclass  action,  the  limitations  period  would  still  be  tolled  because \nDefendants  fraudulently  concealed  facts  which  would  have  caused \nPlaintiffs to move for class certification and Defendants' conduct estops \nthem from asserting the limitations period as a defense to the claims of \nabsent class members.  Jarrett v.  Kassel, 972 F.2d 1415, 1427-1428 (6th \nCir. 1992); Wolin v.  Smith Barney Inc., 83 F.3d 847, 852 (7th Cir. 1996); \n4 \nA summary of these claims is attached as Exhibit B to the Pianto affidavit. \n- 2 -\n\nLothian  v.  Detroit,  414  Mich.  160,  176-177,  324  N.W.2d  9  (1982); \nMCLA 600.5855. \nThe County's unconstitutional actions are not isolated.  They are part of a long-standing \npattern and practice which has victimized more than 100 persons - persons who are least able to \ntake care of themselves.  This case cries out for classwide relief, both equitable and monetary. \nBecause at least the currently identified persons could pursue individual claims, judicial \neconomy mandates class certification as the most superior way to adjudicate the classwide issues \nand ensure that there is a classwide remedy.  Problems of individualized proof of damages has \nrarely been a bar to class certification, and it is not a bar in this case.  See Olden v.  LaFarge \nCorp., 383 F.3d 495 (6th Cir. 2004), affirming 203 F.R.D. 254 (E.D.Mich. 2001) (Lawson, J) (in \naffirming this Court's decision to  certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3) and \nfinding that individual damage determinations did not prevent certification).  If further discovery \ndemonstrates that there may be manageability problems, then Court can modify its rulings and, if \nnecessary, decertify the class.  See Rule 23(c)(l), F.R.Civ.P., and Barney v. Holzer Clinic, Ltd., \n110 F.3d 1207, 1214 (6th Cir.  1997) (as long as the court retains jurisdiction over the case it \nmust continue carefully to  scrutinize whether the requirements  of Rule 23  are satisfied and \nwithdraw or amend certification if such representation is not furnished\"). \nDenying  class  certification  at  this  point would  create the  serious  risk that  currently \nunidentified victims might lose their right to sue because an order denying class certification \nterminates the tolling of the limitations period.  Thus, at a minimum, if the Court should decide \nto  deny class  certification,  it  should enter an order tolling the limitations period until  after \nPlaintiffs  have had  an  adequate  opportunity to  review  all  relevant records  to  identify those \npersons who have been victimized and give them an adequate opportunity to retain counsel and \npursue individual actions. \n- 3 -\n\nI.  FACTS SUPPORTING CLASS CERTIFICATION \nA.  The Conditions At The Jail Are Far Worse Than Those That The Court \nAddressed In Its Summary Judgment Opinion; And They Continue To This \nDay \nFrom the earliest stages of this litigation, the defendants have asserted that the practice of \nforcibly removing inmates' clothing, placing them naked in an isolation cell where they can be \nobserved by members of the opposite sex was curtailed by jail directive in December of 2001. \nAs the summary of evidence supporting the pattern of pervasive constitutional violations clearly \ndemonstrates, the j ail has continued the practice through the present time. \nPlaintiffs have assembled a summary of evidence which demonstrates that Defendants' \npractices  were  far  more  pervasive  than  Defendants  have  represented  and,  worse,  that  they \ncontinue  to  this  time.  A  summary of the  evidence  is  attached  as  Exhibit B to  the Pianto \naffidavit. 5 \nThe policy of providing isolation cell  detainees  with paper gowns  is,  by no  means, \nuniformly followed.  Indeed, the evidence indicates that since December of 2001, inmates have \nbeen routinely stripped of their clothing by force  and placed in segregation cells in a naked \ncondition.  Moreover, the paper gowns, when provided, are inadequate to cover private body \n5 \nThe Summary of Evidence Supporting Pervasive Pattern of Constitutional Violations documents \nthe reports of 91  victims of this policy.  72 of the individuals reporting violations were male, 19 were \nfemale.  The average age of the detainee is 31.S years.  The average length of stay in the isolation cell is \n22.S hours.  Of those filing reports with plaintiffs' counsel, 38 are currently incarcerated in the Saginaw \nCounty Jailor elsewhere.  6S of the victims or 71 % allege that they were observed by members of the \nopposite sex.  The presence of cameras in the cells make it likely that others were as well.  The reports \nspan eight years from 1998 to 200S.  These include one case in 1998; fourteen cases in 1999; eighteen \ncases in 2000; fourteen cases in 2001; fourteen cases in 2002; twelve cases in 2003; fifteen cases in 2004; \nand, three cases in 200S.  There were 44 reports of violations occurring after January, 2002.  Of the 44 \nreports, 23  alleged that they were placed in the isolation cell without a gown or any other type of \ncovering.  The twenty three individuals making these allegations are (3) Ball, (IS) Cage, (16) Carson, (18) \nCastillo, (27) Eudis, (36) Hasse, (42) Jakes, (43) Jekel, (4S) Johnson, (SO) Kennelly, (S4) Labelle, (SS) \nLamphere, (S6) Larkin, (62) Mayfield, (63) Merrow, (67) Newman, (69) O'Connor, (71) Peoples, (7S) \nQuinnan, (77) Riggins, (78) Riggins, W, (8S) Semple, and (88) Wicker.  Of the 91 reported violations, 71 \nindividuals asserted that they were in the segregation cell totally naked.  Only 19 said that they were \nprovided with a paper gown.  On this see the affidavit of Peggy Goldberg Pitt which is filed in support of \nthis motion which explains the methodology used in compiling this information. \n- 4-\n\nparts.  The paper gowns are of such poor quality that they usually tear.  In addition, the gowns \nare often used by the prisoners to remove mace sprayed on them during the clothes stripping \nprocess or utilized as toilet paper, leaving them naked. \nThese unconstitutional isolation cells are monitored 24 hours a day by cameras from \nseveral locations.  The cameras can viewed by a wide variety of personnel within the jail. See \nhttp://www.delta.edulcorrproglscsd;ailtour.html (which proudl7y shows the holding cells and the \nmonitors  which  allow  observation  of the  holding  cells  which  the  constitutional  violations \noccurred.) \nThe jail has used, and currently uses, three areas in the jail as isolation cells.  One cell \nappears to be standard size with a commode and sink but which is often inoperable or kept in an \nunsanitary condition.  There is a concrete slab about a foot off the ground for sitting or sleeping. \nThe other two segregation cells are barred rooms approximately eight feet-by ten feet which have \nneither a commode, nor a sink, nor a slab upon which the inmate can sit.  There is a hole in the \nfloor where inmates can relieve themselves.  It is unclear whether the hole is  attached to  a \nsanitary drain. \nThe overwhelming majority of those reporting conditions in the isolation cell indicate \nthat they were subjected to extremely cold temperatures.  Reports indicate that the temperature \nmay not be habitable for individuals who stay in the cells for more than a short time. \nMore than a third of those reporting described the conditions in the isolation cells as \nunsanitary with offensive odors.  Hygiene items such as toilet paper and tampons were denied to \napproximately 31 % of those reporting. \nIt is also universally reported that there are unsanitary conditions in both cells.  In the one \ncell where a commode is available, it is often plugged up with human feces and other waste \nmaterial.  The water often does not run.  Fecal matter, urine, blood, pus and other human bodily \nfluids cover the walls, floor and the seating slab in the one cell where it is provided. \n- 5 -\n\nMany of the inmates report that sanitary supplies, such as toilet paper and tampons, are \nnot available.  Class counsel has received many reports that, when toilet paper is provided, naked \ninmates wrap themselves in the toilet paper in order to keep warm and are unable to secure \nadditional paper products when the time comes to clean themselves after defecation. \nThese statistics prove that the defendants continue to misrepresent the conditions at the \njail.  The defendants'  insistence that the unconstitutional conditions addressed in the court's \nJanuary 25,2005 opinion have been cured is simply not true. \nB.  Defendants Have Engaged In A Fraudulent Course Of Conduct Designed To \nConceal The Full Extent Of Their Pervasive Patter Of Unconstitutional \nConduct \nPlaintiffs suspected that Defendants' unlawful conduct was pervasive and victimized far \nmore persons than the originally named plaintiffs.  The Defendants have not only denied this -\nin communications to Plaintiffs' counsel and in written and oral representations to the Court \nbut they stonewalled Plaintiffs' efforts to discover the true facts.  These misrepresentations have \nprejudiced Plaintiffs because they did not move early on for class certification, and they affected \nthe Court's own analysis of the class.  These misrepresentations, whether intentional or negligent \nat the time, include the following: \nOn March 14,2002, Mr. Jensen filed \"Defendants' Status and Scheduling \nConference Statement\", wherein he stated, among other things: \n\"[with]  regard  to  whether  this  is  a  'class  action;,  the jail  records  of \nSaginaw County reflect for the past three years there have been 11 females \n(including the plaintiffs in this case) and 19 males who have been placed \nin the  holding  tank. .. assuming  that the  class  of plaintiffs  is  simply \nwomen who  have been strip-searched by male  guards,  the number of \nplaintiffs  is  very  slight,  and  there  are  limited  fact  questions  to  be \nresolved.\"  [Pianto Affidavit, ,-r 4] \nAs the case continued, the misrepresentations continued; and, upon reflection, it is difficult to \nview the misrepresentations as mere negligence.  As the facts established in the Pianto affidavit \ndemonstrate, Defendants (perhaps not their counsel) were engaged in a clear pattern and practice \nof misrepresenting to Plaintiffs and the Court what happened in the Saginaw County Jail. \n- 6 -\n\nC.  Notwithstanding Defendants' Obstruction, Plaintiffs Have Discovered That \nThe Pattern Was Far More Pervasive And Affected Far More Persons Than \nDefendants Have Acknowledged \nIn  early 2003,  Plaintiffs'  began receiving infonnation which strongly suggested  that \nDefendants had misrepresented the extent of unconstitutional practices.  On February 14,2003, a \nlocal television station aired a story on the jail's use of segregation cells.  Plaintiffs' counsel \nbegan receiving calls from fonner inmates at the Saginaw County Jail claiming to have been \nplaced in the segregation cell naked or in a partially-naked condition.  Pianto Affidavit, ~ 15. \nOn March 10, 2003, Plaintiffs' counsel notified the court by letter of his concerns that the \nnumber of persons who were adversely affected by the jail's policies exceeded the 30 or so \nplaintiffs who had been identified by the defendants from their records, and requested an in \nperson pretrial conference.  The court conducted the status conference on March 18, 2003.  At \nthe status conference, Plaintiffs' counsel described to the court the phone calls received from the \nnewly-discovered victims, and he reiterated his concerns regarding the representations made by \ndefense counsel that the number of victims did not exceed 30 individuals.  At the conclusion of \nthe conference, the court infonned counsel that because dispositive motions were forthcoming, \nthe court would revisit the issues of joinder and/or class-action after it decided the dispositive \nmotions. Pianto Affidavit, ~~ 16-18. \nSince that early 2003 status conference, more infonnation has emerged.  Indeed, after the \nCourt issued its summary judgment opinion on January 25, 2005, publicity about the Saginaw \nCounty Jail has increased; and this increased publicity has caused Plaintiffs' counsel to conclude \nthat more than 200 persons have been victims of Defendants' unconstitutional conduct.  See \nPianto Affidavit, ~~ 26-28. \nARGUMENT \nI.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nIt is  well-established that \"any doubts  concerning the propriety of class  certification \nshould be resolved in favor of upholding the class.\"  Gasperoni v. Metabolife International, Inc., \n2000 WL 33365948 at *8 (E.D. Mich. 2000) (Cohn, J.).  See also Eisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d \n-7 -\n\n770,  785  (3d  Cir.  1985);  Little  Caesar  Enterprises,  Inc.  v.  Smith,  172  F.R.D.  236,  241 \n(E.D.Mich. 1997) (Gadola, J.). \nWhen considering a class certification motion, the court may not inquire into the merits \nof the case,  and may look beyond the pleadings solely to  determine whether the plaintiff's \nclaims, if proven, would present principally individual or common issues.  Little Caesar,  172 \nF.R.D. at 241; Eisen v.  Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-178 (1974). \nII.  Because The Statutes Of Limitations Have Been Tolled, Denying Class Certification \nWill Not Promote Judicial Economy Or Substantial Justice; Instead, It Will Require \nThe Filing Of Individual Actions Which Will Only Increase The Cost And Burdens \nOf Litigation For All Parties And The Court \nThe Supreme Court has held that the filing of a class action tolls\" 'the applicable statute \nof limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit \nbeen permitted to continue as a class action.' \" Crown,  Cork,  &  Seal Co.,  Inc.  v.  Parker, 462 \nU.S. 345, 353-354 (1983) (quoting American Pipe &  Constr.  Co.  v.  Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 544 \n(1974)).  Once the statute has been tolled by the filing of the class action, \"it remains tolled for \nall members of the putative class until class certification is denied.\" Crown Cork, 462 U.S. at \n354.  See also see Weston v. AmeriBank, 265 F.3d 366 (6th Cir. 2001) (the statute of limitations \nfor putative class members of the original class is tolled for substantive claims that were raised, \nor could have been raised, in the initial complaint).6 \n6 \nThe same tolling principles apply under Michigan law.  As Warren Consolo  Schools.  V.  W  R. \nGrace & Co., 205 Mich. App. 508,518 N.W.2d 508,511 (1994). observed: \"Where class certification is \nlater denied, the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable period of limitation with respect \nto all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue \nas a class action. Crown, Cork & Seal CO. V. Parker, 462 U.S. 345,353, 103 S.Ct. 2392, 2397, 76 L.Ed.2d \n628 (1983); American Pipe & Construction CO. V.  Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 554, 94 S.Ct. 756, 766, 38 L.Ed.2d \n713 (1974); Lee  Grand Rapids Bd. ofE  d., 148 Mich.App. 364, 369, 384 N.W.2d 165 (1986). To hold \nV. \notherwise would frustrate  the  function  of a class  action,  which is  to  avoid multiplicity of activity. \nAmerican  Pipe,  supra  414  U.S.  at  551,  94  S.Ct.  at  765.  These  principles  are  embodied  in \nMCR 3.501(F)(1), which states:  \"The statute of limitations is tolled as to all persons within the class \ndescribed in the complaint on the commencement of an action asserting a class action.\" \n- 8 -\n\nAnd,  even if the class  action tolling principles did not extend the limitations period, \nDefendants' conduct estops them from invoking the statute of limitations.  When they filed this \naction as a class action, Plaintiffs represented the putative class members.  Thus, Defendants' \nmisrepresentations affected not only Plaintiffs but the other class members as well.  Jarrett v. \nKassel, 972 F.2d 1415, 1427-1428 (6th Cir. 1992).  Had Plaintiffs not been deceived, they would \nhave  moved  for  class  certification  earlier,  and  the  Court  would  likely  have  granted  class \ncertification if it was aware of all the facts.  And, even if the Court had denied class certification, \nthe  Court  would  certainly have  made  provision  for  all  persons  victimized  by Defendants' \nunconstitutional conduct to be identified and either join this action or pursue separate actions. \nSolely because of Defendants' misconduct, that early hearing did not occur.  Thus, Defendants' \nmisconduct  bars  them  from  invoking  the  statute  of limitations  as  a  defense  to  any newly \nidentified victims, under principles of equitable tolling and equitable estoppel. \nWolin, 83 F.3d at 852 (7th Cir. 1996), explains the difference between equitable tolling \nand equitable estoppel: \nEquitable tolling is invoked when the prospective plaintiff simply does not \nhave  and  cannot  with  due  diligence  obtain  infonnation  essential  to \n* * * \nbringing a suit.  Equitable estoppel,  as  we have seen, is invoked \nwhen the prospective defendant does make such a special effort to cover \nup the fraud or does something else to prevent the prospective plaintiff \nfrom  suing  in  time,  such  as  promising  not  to  plead  the  statute  of \n* * * \nlimitations as a defense. \nThis is the domain of equitable tolling and equitable estoppel. They differ \ncritically in scope in the following respect:  when the plea is  equitable \ntolling rather than  equitable estoppel,  the defendant is  innocent of the \ndelay (though not of course of the original wrong), so the plaintiff must \nuse due diligence to be allowed to toll the statute of limitations; if he does \nnot,  he has  no  equitable  claim  to  avoid  the  time  bar.  In the  case  of \nequitable estoppel, which requires active misconduct by the defendant, the \nplaintiff is not required to be diligent. The disagreement, however, may be \napparent rather than real, because the cases often run equitable tolling and \nequitable estoppel together. [Citations omitted.] \nThe same principles apply under Michigan law.  Lothian, 414 Mich. at 176-177. \n- 9 -\n\nThus, whether the Court applies federal law or state law to detennine the appropriate \nlimitations periods, the Court should conclude that the running of the statute of limitations has \nbeen tolled since this lawsuit was commenced and that Defendants are estopped to rely on the \nlimitations period in defense of victims who have been newly identified or who will be identified \nwhen Defendants cease their stonewalling and provide accurate infonnation to Plaintiffs' counsel \nand the Court about what really happened at the Saginaw County Jail. \nIII.  Given The Choice Between Joinder, Filing Independent Actions, Or Class \nCertification At This Time, The Court Should Choose Certification \nDoing justice demands that all victims of Defendants' unconstitutional conduct should \nhave  a  remedy;  and,  now  that  it  is  clear  that  the  victims  exceed  the  County's  earlier \nrepresentations of 30 or so,  the only question is how procedurally to  manage the numerous \nindividual claims.  On first glance, the easiest solution might be to deny class certification, but \nany serious reflection will soon demonstrate that that solution will not only clog the Court's \ndocket but impose huge costs on the all parties and the courts. \nIndividual  actions  would mandate individual discovery and individual trials.  Joinder \nwould mandate individual discovery and perhaps individual trials.  Both individual actions and \njoinder would also create the risk that newly identified persons might not be protected by the \ntolling principles after the court enters an order denying class certification. \nRule 23  exists to prevent the precise problems that would be presented by individual \nactions or joinder.  And, in this case at this time, there is little doubt that Plaintiffs can satisfy the \nrequirements of Rule 23 and that a class action \"is superior to other available methods for the fair \nand efficient adjudication of the controversy.\" \nIV.  This Case Satisfies The Requirements Of Rule 23(A) \nA.  The Class Is So Numerous That Joinder Is Impractible \nThe numerosity requirement requires  that joinder be impracticable, but this  does  not \nmean \"impossible.\"  The requirement is satisfied by showing that joinder would be difficult or \ninconvenient.  Little Caesar, 172 F.R.D. at 241. \n- 10-\n\nAs this court observed in Olden, 203 F.R.D. at 268: \nThere is no strict numerical test to determine when the class is large \nenough or too numerous to join under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nBremiller v.  Cleveland Psychiatric Inst.,  195  F.R.D.  1,  19  (N.D.Ohio \n2000).  The Court may consider many factors, including \"class size, ease \nof identification of members of the proposed class, geographic distribution \nof class  members,  and  the  ability  of the  class  members  to  pursue \nindividual  actions.\"  Krieger  v.  Gast,  197  F.R.D.  310,  314 \n(W.D.Mich.2000). \nSee also Little Caesar, 172 F.R.D. at 241.  Federal courts have routinely found that groups of25 \nto 40 individuals are sufficient to meet the numerosity requirements.  See 5 Moore's Federal \nPractice (3d ed. 1997), § 23.23 at 23-63 ; Harris v. General Development Corp., 127 F.R.D. 655, \n660 (N.D. Ill. 1989). \nWhile  Plaintiffs  meet  the  numerosity  test  on  numbers  alone,  the  limited  time  the \ndetainees and prisoners spend in jail makes class certification especially appropriate when the \nclaims could become moot as the case progresses and the Plaintiffs are released from the jail. \nPenland v.  Warner County Jail, 797 F.2d 332 (6th Cir. 1986) (reversing District Court's denial \nof class certification of case challenging various conditions of confinement at a small county \njail);  Johnson v.  City ojOperowsa, 658 F.2d 1065, 1069-1070 (5th Cir. 1981).  In Penland, the \nSixth Circuit emphasized that potential mootness concerns mandated certification of a 23(b )(2) \nclass seeking declaratory and injunctive relief because, without certification, the short duration of \nconfinement would render it unlikely that any representative could prove his claim while still \nincarcerated in the county jail.  The same factor is obviously true here. \nB.  There Are Questions Of Law And Fact Common To The Class \nCommonality  exists  when  there  is  a  common  issue  among  the  plaintiffs  and  the \nresolution of that issue would advance the litigation.  See Olden, 203 F.R.D. at 269; Garrish v. \nUAW, 149 F. Supp. 2d 326 (B.D. Mich. 2001), citing Sprague v. General Motors Corp., 133 F.3d \n388,397 (6th Cir. 1998); This is not a demanding requirement.  Anderson v. Cornejo, 199 F.R.D. \n228,239 (N.D.Ill.2000). \n- 11 -\n\nA common question is one which \"arises from  'a common nucleus of operative facts' \nregardless of whether the underlying facts change over the class period and vary as to individual \nclaimants.\"  Rosario v.  Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir.  1992) (citations omitted).  As \nthis Court explained in Klender v.  Us., 218 F.R.D. 161, 164-165 (E.D.Mich. 2001) (Lawson, J.): \nA  variance  in  damages  does  not  destroy  commonality  or  typicality \nprovided that \"the same event or practice or course of conduct [ ] gives \nrise  to  the  claims  of  other  class  members,\"  and  if  the  named \nrepresentatives' claims \"are based on the same legal theory.\" Id.  (citing \nAmer. Med.  Sys.,  75 F.3d at 1082). Although the named plaintiffs' claims \nmust fairly encompass the class members' claims, they need not always \ninvolve the same facts or law provided there is a common element of fact \nor law.  Senter v.  General Motors  Corp.  532 F.2d 511,  525  n.  31  (6th \nCir.l976). In addition, the resolution ofthe common issue should advance \nthe litigation. Sprague, 133 F.3d at 398. \nGovernmental action in particular may present a \"common course of conduct\" which \nmakes class certification appropriate, especially where Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive \nrelief.  Kanter v.  Casey,43 F.3d 48 (3rd Cir. 1994) (commonality found in claims of systematic \ndeficiencies in operation of child welfare system although Plaintiffs may have received different \nindividual damages, as differences would not affect the outcome of the central legal issue in the \ncase  and  Defendant's  common  course  of conduct  toward. Plaintiffs  eliminated  a  need  for \nindividualized determination of propriety of injunctive relief.) \nIn this case, the common question of law has already been established by the court in its \nJanuary 25, 2005 Summary Judgment Order which found unconstitutional the Saginaw County \nJail's policy of placing inmates in isolation cells in a naked or partially-naked condition where \nthey can be viewed by members of the opposite sex. \nPlaintiffs seek injunctive relief and damages as a result of this unconsitutional practice. \nWhile  the  particular  factual  circumstances  and  impact  of the  policies  as  applied  to  each \nindividual  detainee  and  prisoner  may  be  different,  the  legal  issues  concerning  the \nconstitutionality of Defendants'  policies,  customs,  and  practices  are  the  same.  VanVels  v. \nPrevier Athletic Center of Plainfield, 182 F.R.D. 500, 507 (W.D. Mich. 1998) (cases involving \n- 12 -\n\nchallenges to a policy or procedure readily meet the commonality requirement as the common \nquestion becomes whether the Defendants acted through an illegal policy or procedure). \nC.  The Claims Of The Representative Parties Are Typical \nIn Olden, 203 F.R.D. at 268, this court observed: \nA claim is typical if \"it arises from the same event or practice or course of \nconduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members, and if his or \nher claims are based on the same legal theory.\"  In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., \n75  F.3d 1069,  1082 (6th Cir.l996).  In addition, the resolution of the \ncommon issue should advance the resolution of the litigation.  Sprague, \n133 F.3d at 397. \nThe typicality requirement is not overly demanding and does not require identicality.  See \nBittinger v. Tecumseh Products Company, 123 F.3d 877 (6th Cir. 1997).  (typicality existed even \nthough some class members had signed releases and would be subject to defenses not faced by \nother class members); Forbush v.  Jc. Penney Co.,  Inc.,  994 F.2d 1101, 1106 (5th Cir.l993); \nDeBoer v.  Mellon Mortgage Co.,  64 F.3d 1171,  1174-1175 (8th Cir.  1995); Retired Chicago \nPolice Ass'n v.  City o/Chicago, 7 F.3d 584,597 (7th Cir. 1993);  Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d \nat 1018 (citing De La Fuente v.  Stokely-Van Camp,  Inc.,  713  F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir.  1983)); \nPaper Systems, Inc. v. Mitsubishi Corp., 193 F.R.D. 601, 605 (E.D. Wis. 2000) \nWhere the focus is upon the Defendants' conduct and the Plaintiffs' legal theories, it is \nnot necessary that all class members suffer the same injury as the named class representative or \nthat the representative and the class have suffered to the same degree.  Kanter v.  Casey, 43 F.3d \n48 (3rd Cir. 1994); Robidoux v.  Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936-937 (32d Cir. 1993); Forbush, 994 \nF.2d at 1106. \nEven a cursory comparison of the claims of class representatives Rose and Fuller with \nthose of the individuals identified in the summary reveals that their claims arise from the same \nconditions, policies, and practices imposed on the class and are based on the same legal theories. \nPlaintiffs easily satisfy the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3). \n- 13 -\n\nD.  The Representative Parties Will Fairly And Adequately Protect The Interests \nof The Class \n\"Adequate representation\" requires  two  inquiries:  (1)  whether the class  counsel  are \n\"qualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the litigation\" and (2) whether the class \nmembers have interests that are antagonistic to the other class members. Olden, 203 F.R.D. at \n270, citing Stout v. Byrider, 228 F.3d 709, 717 (6th Cir.2000). \nThe requirement that the named plaintiffs be adequate representatives does not require \nthat they be the best possible representative for the class,  nor must they occupy a position \nidentical to other members of the class.  In re Playmobil Antitrust Litigation, 35 F.Supp.2d 231, \n242 (E.D.N.Y.  1998); 7 A Wright &  Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure (2d ed.), § 1765. \nThe test, ultimately, is whether the class representatives will promote the interests of the class as \nthey protect their own.  It is generally recognized that this test is met upon a showing that there \nare no  conflicts of interest between the representative plaintiffs and there is  a likelihood of \nvigorous prosecution of the case by competent counsel.  See, e.g., Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, \n403 (1975); In re The Prudential Ins Co of America Sales Practices Litigation, 148 F.3d 283, \n311 (3d Cir. 1998) ; Garrish v.  UAW, 149 F. Supp. 2d 326 (E.D. Mich. 2001). \nAbsent a showing to the contrary, adequacy will be assumed. \nPlaintiffs' counsel, Michael L. Pitt, Stephen Wasinger and Christopher Pianto, are filing \naffidavits in support of this motion which establish a solid team of experienced trial attorneys \nskilled in class-action litigation and fully capable of prosecuting the case through settlement, trial \nand appeal.  The firms involved in this matter and the ACLU of Michigan are fully capable of \nproviding the finances necessary for successful prosecution. \nSimilarly,  Plaintiffs  are  filing  the  affidavits  of class  representatives  Rose  and  Fuller \nwhich demonstrate that they will adequately represent the class.  Class representative Rose has \nbeen involved in the prosecution of this matter since its inception in October of 2001.  Class \nrepresentative  Fuller  has  participated  in  this  matter  since  September,  2002.  Both  have \n- 14 -\n\ndemonstrated a willingness and commitment to prosecute this case through settlement, trial and, \nif necessary, appeal. \nPlaintiffs amply meet the criteria of Rule 23 (a)(4). \nv. \nThe Court Should Certify A Class Under Rule 23(b)(l) and (2) To Order Final \nInjunctive Relief \nRule 23(b)  sets  out the three types  of class-action suits that may be certified,  if the \nrequirements of subdivision (a)  have been met.  See Olden,  383  F.3d at  507  (affirming this \nCourt's certification under Rule 23(b)(2) for injunctive relief and a Rule 23(b)(3) for monetary \nrelief). \nClass actions under Rule 23(b )(2) are often brought in civil-rights cases in which similar \nlegal wrongs against each of the class members are alleged.  See Molski v.  Gleich:1 318 F.3d 937, \n949-950 (9th Cir. 2003) (class properly certified under Rule 23(b)(2) in federal and state civil-\nrights action in which injunction was predominant form of relief sought); Stewart v.  Abraham, \n275 F.3d 220, 228 (3rd Cir. 2001) (class action properly certified under Rule 23(b)(2) based on \nalleged civil-rights violations of persons released and then rearrested in exercise of prosecutorial \ndiscretion. \nThe fact that Plaintiffs also seek monetary relief does not mean that the Court should \nrefuse to certify a case under Rule 23(b)(2).  Indeed, in Olden, the Sixth Circuit affirmed this \nCourt's certification of a class under both Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3),  and specifically \nrejected  Defendants'  argument  that  \"Rule  23(b)(2)  certification  is  inappropriate  because \nindividualized money damages overwhelm the plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief.\"  383 F.3d \nat 510. \nBecause Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and compensation for injuries stemming from \nDefendants' unconstitutional conduct which arise out of policies and practices which impact as a \nwhole and which will continue to do so unless an injunction is issued, they meet the conditions \nfor certification of a Rule 23(b)(2) class.  Olden,  383 F.3d at 510-511.  In addition, Plaintiffs \nsatisfy the requirements for a Rule 23(b)(1) class because individual adjudication would run the \n- 15 -\n\nrisk  of establishing  inconsistent  standards  of conduct  or  would  \"as  a  practical  matter  be \ndispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially \nimpair or impede their ability to protect their interests ....\"   In contrast, class certification will \nconserve judicial resources  and promote substantial justice in a manner which is  fair to  all \nparties, including the absent class members who have not yet been identified. \nBased on these reports and the defendants' efforts to cover-up the actual conditions in the \njail, permanent injunctive relief is required in order to prevent a continuation of the pervasive \npattern of constitutional violations. The court should enjoin the defendants as follows: \nA.  The isolation cell, if utilized, must comply with all state and industry regulations \nas to size, accessibility of water and appropriate sanitation equipment. \nB.  The court should permanently enjoin the defendants from utilizing the segregation \ncell which does not comply with state or industry standards regarding size and \naccessibility of water and sanitation equipment. \nC.  The court must require the defendants to regularly maintain the habitability of the \nsegregation cell through regular monitoring, inspection and cleaning. \nD.  The  court  should  require  the  defendants  to  maintain  the  temperature  in  the \nsegregation  cell  at  standards  established  by the  State  of Michigan or by the \nindustry. \nE.  The  court  should  order  the  defendant  to  establish  an  appropriate  suicide \nprevention protocol for inmates confined to the isolation cell.  The protocol shall \nprovide, at a minimum, that for inmates placed in the isolation cell determined to \nbe low risk,  that the inmate be permitted to  wear standard jail uniforms.  In \nsituations where there is a moderate or substantial risk of suicide, the inmate may \nbe issued suicide-proof gowns of such size and quality as  to provide full  and \ncomplete privacy for  the  inmate  held  in the  isolation  cell  and  provide  some \nwarmth. \nF.  The court should order that each inmate confined to the isolation cell shall be \nprovided a suicide-proof blanket which must be made available throughout the \nindividual's stay in the isolation cell. \nG.  The court should order that forcible stripping of clothing should occur only when \nabsolutely necessary.  Whenever there  is  a  forcible  removal  of clothing,  the \nofficers or jail personnel performing this task must be the same gender as the \ninmate.  In every case where the removal of clothing is deemed to be necessary, \nthe inmate must be provided a clear and unequivocal opportunity to remove his or \nher own clothing in a non-public location.  Under no circumstances, should other \n- 16 -\n\ninmates,  including trusties, be able to  observe an inmate removing his or her \nclothing voluntarily or involuntarily or during the time that the inmate is in the \nisolation cell. \nH.  The court should order that appropriate sanitary items, such as toilet paper and \ntampons, be provided in such quantities as necessary. \n1.  Under no  circumstances  shall  there be more than one person detained in the \nisolation cell at the same time. \n1.  The court shall order that the jail should adopt policies which will eliminate or \nsubstantially restrict jail personnel viewing inmates of the opposite sex in a nude \nor partially nude condition. \nK.  The court should order that the use of mace, physical force or other restraints shall \nbe used only in strict accordance with State of Michigan guidelines or industry \nstandards. \nL.  The  court  should  order the  defendants  to  adopt  a  strictly-enforced policy of \nprohibiting jail personnel from using derogatory language, verbal harassment or \ntaunting in connection with the utilization of the isolation cell. \nM.  The court should order that inmates confined to the isolation cell shall have access \nto the necessary and approved medication and/or medical attention as required by \nstate regulation or industry standard. \nN.  The court should order that the defendants adopt a comprehensive set of policies \nnecessary to comply with the court's order and to provide the necessary training \nto all personnel who are currently employed in the jail.  The training program \nshall be a regular part of the defendants' orientation for new jail personnel. \nO.  The court should appoint an expert in the field of jail administration to serve as a \nmonitor to assist the defendants in developing and implementing the necessary \ninjunctive relief.  The court should appoint a monitor for a term no less than two \nyears.  The monitor shall provide quarterly reports to the court and class counsel. \nThe defendants shall bear all reasonable costs associated with the retention of the \nmonitor during the two-year monitoring period. \nP.  The Court should order that a procedure for reporting violations without fear of \nretaliation be put in place. \nVI.  The Court Should Also Certify A Class Under Rule 23(b)(3) To Remedy Past \nDiscrimination Through Awards Of Damages \nRule 23(b)(3) permits a class action to be brought ifthe court finds \"that the questions of \nlaw or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions effecting only \n- 17 -\n\nindividual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nu.s., \nefficient administration of the controversy.\"  Olden, 383 F.3d at 508-509; Klender v.  218 \nF.R.D.  161  (E.D.Mich. 2003).  In doing so, the court should consider the four non-exclusive \nfactors  listed in Rule 23(b)(3):  (1)  any interest of the class members in pursuing individual \naction;  (2)  the  existence  and  nature  of any  litigation  concerning  the  class  claims  already \nunderway; (3) whether pursuing the claims in the particular forum would be desirable; and, (4) \nany difficulty in administration or management of a potential class action. \nThe complete identity of proof is not required.  Accordingly, if the court can identify \nsome significant advantages to the class-action device, some factual differentiation in the class \nclaims will not preclude certification.  See Olden, 383 F.3d at 507-508; Little Caesar, 172 F.R.D. \nat 265  (the critical question for Rule 23(b)(3) is whether the method of proving [the claim] \ninvolves facts - even if complex and external to the contract - that are predominately common to \nthe class and not individual). \nSince \"[n]o two claims are likely to be exactly similar [and]  [a]lmost all claims will \ninvolve disparate issues of fact and law to some degree,\" the question is whether there is \"more \ncommonality ... than there is disparity.\"  If so, the predominance test is met.  429 Mich. at 415-\n416.  Similarly, 7A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure (2d ed. 1986), § 1778 at \npp. 528-529, explain that under Rule 23: \n[t]he common questions need not be dispositive of the entire action.  In \nother words,  \"predominate\"  should  not  be  automatically  equated with \n\"determinative\" or \"significant.\"  Therefore,  when one or more of the \ncentral issues in the action are common to the class and can be said to \npredominate, the action will be considered proper under Rule 23(b)(3) \neven though other important matters will have to be tried separately. \nHere,  the predominance requirement is  amply satisfied because proof relating to  the \ncommon question of Defendants'  unlawful practices will  dominate  any trial,  whether on an \nindividual or a classwide basis.  Proofs of individual damages do not destroy predominance. \nOlden, 383  F.3d at 508-509; see also Delgozzo v.  Kenny, 628 A.2d 1080 (N.J.  1993) (\"[T]he \noverwhelming weight of authority holds that the need for individual damages calculations does \n- 18 -\n\nnot diminish the appropriateness of class action certification where common questions as  to \nliability predominate.\"); 4 H. Newberg, Newberg On Class Actions (3d ed.), § 3.16 at pp 173-74. \nAs the Sixth Circuit observed in Olden, if individualized damage determinations become \nnecessary, this Court has many choices: \nAs the district court properly noted, it can bifurcate the issue of liability \nfrom the issue of damages, and if liability is found, the issue of damages \ncan be decided by a special master or by another method.  Fed.R.Civ.P. \n23(c)(4)(A);  see  also  Simon  v.  Philip Morris  Inc.,  200  F.R.D.  21,  30 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2001) (\"By bifurcating issues like general liability or general \ncausation and damages, a court can await the outcome of a prior liability \ntrial  before  deciding  how  to  provide  relief  to  the  individual  class \nmembers.\").  [383 F.3d at 509] \nIndeed, if the court does not find a superior method of determining individual issues after the \ntrial of the common liability issues, then the Court could exercise its right under Rule 23(c)(1) to \ndecertify the class.  In this situation, at least the common liability determinations would be the \nlaw of the case and operate as a bar on further,  time-consuming relitigation of the common \nissues.  This  additional  trial  time on individualized issues,  if necessary,  is  far  preferable to \nindividual trials on all aspects of the case. \nA class action is also the superior method of dealing with the claims in this case.  First, \nthis  case has  been pending since October of 2001.  In the three-and-a-half years  that have \nelapsed,  the  only  cases  that  have  been  brought  are  those  originally  pursued  by  attorneys \nChristopher Pianto and  Loyst Fletcher.  Even with the most recent barrage of publicity, it is \nunlikely that any of the individuals who have been subjected to the unconstitutional jail policies \nwill pursue individual cases.  The reason for this should be obvious: many of the claims involve \nisolation-cell incidents lasting only a few  hours  and,  for  the most part,  do  not involve any \nallegations of physical harm or residual impairments or losses.  In today's legal environment, \npursuing an individual case of this type would be cost-prohibitive. \n- 19 -\n\nSecond, the only other litigation concerning the class claims which is already underway is \nthe Brabant case which counsel in the Rose case is also pursuing on behalf of eight plaintiffs. 7 \nThe third factor evaluates whether pursuing the claims in the particular forum would be \ndesirable.  Here there can be no doubt that this forum is most appropriate. \nFinally, the court must consider any difficulty in administration or management of the \npotential class action.  As to this factor, the court is requested to examine its own decisions in \nKlender and Olden, as well as the Sixth Circuit's Olden decision.  In Olden, 203 F.R.D. at 270-\n271, this Court addressed the \"manageability\" factor \nThis \"manageability\" factor \"encompass [e s] the whole range of practical \nproblems  that  may render  the  class  action  format  inappropriate  for  a \nparticular suit.\" Andrews v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 95 F.3d 1014, 1023 (l1th \nCir.1996)(internal quotations omitted).  The problems may include cases \nwhich \"break[ ] down into an unmanageable variety of individual legal \nand  factual  issues.\"  Id.  The  defendant  argues  that  is  the  case here. \nHowever, it appears the legal issues are common to all defendants.  The \nindividual factual questions are how much money, if any, is each plaintiff \nentitled to  assuming liability is  established;  this  will  change with the \nlength of time they lived in Alpena and the damages they suffered during \nthat time.  The Court can bifurcate the issue of liability from the issue of \ndamages.  See Little Caesar Enters., Inc.  v.  Smith, 172 F.R.D. 236, 267 \n(E.D.Mich.1997).  Once liability is found, the issue of damages can be \ndecided by a special master or by another method.  Id. \nIn Klender, retired public school teachers sued the United States alleging that payments \nthey received pursuant to early retirement incentive plans in exchange for their property rights of \ntenure  and  contractual  rights  of just-cause  employment  did  not  constitute  income  and, \naccordingly,  sought  return  of  taxes  which  were  withheld  under  the  Federal  Insurance \nContributions  Act.  This  court held held that  the proposed  class  satisfied requirements  for \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3) and, in addressing manageability, stated: \n7 \nThe Brabant case was filed earlier this year on behalf of the eight-named plaintiffs after the court \nissued its ruling granting plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to the unconstitutional nature of the \nSaginaw Jail policy in question but denied leave to amend the complaint to add additional parties.  If class \ncertification is granted in Rose, the Brabant case will be dismissed and the Brabant plaintiffs will become \neither party plaintiffs in Rose or class members. \n-20-\n\nonce the common legal issue is decided, individual assessments can be \ndetennined by a special master or by other methods.  This case does not \npresent an unmanageable variety of individual legal and factual  issues. \n[218 F.R.D. at 268] \nThus the Court's own prior decisions make clear that problems of individualized proof \ncan be dealt with in a variety of ways either at one trial or after a bifurcated trial of liability.  The \neffect  of the  unconstitutional  practices  on  individual  class  members  can  be the  subject  of \nsummary testimony or the court can use a master to take the individual testimony.  Defendants \ncan  offer  no  rationale  for  compelling  a multiplicity  of trials  addressing  both  liability  and \ndamages. \nThe trial of the damage claims will be easily managed, either by this court or a special \nmaster.  As the Summary ofE  vidence Supporting Pervasive Pattern of Constitutional Violations \n(Pianto Exhibit B) demonstrates, the presentation of evidence for each claimant would follow a \ndefinite repetitive pattern.  If necessary, the court can create a subclass for those claims which \nallege serious physical hann or serious physical consequences.  For all other cases, the factors \nwhich must be considered by the jury in detennining the appropriate level of compensation are \nsimple and straightforward.  These factors would include such things as duration in the isolation \ncell, the condition of the isolation cell at the time in question, whether the individual was placed \nin the cell completely naked or was given an inadequate paper gown, whether the individual was \nviewed by members of the opposite sex, whether the individual had his or her clothing forcibly \nremoved and whether there were some aggravating factors such as verbal taunting, harassment, \nmacing, or other physical contact which did not result in injury or other physical consequences. \nVII.  If The Court Does Not Certify, It Should Permit Joinder Of The Additional Persons \nWho Plaintiffs Have Thus Far Identified And Continue To Toll The Limitations \nPeriod Under Plaintiffs Can Obtain Complete Access To Defendants' Records So \nThat They Can Identify Additional Parties Who Have Suffered From Defendants' \nUnconstitutional Practices \nRule 20, F.R.Civ.P., provides that all persons may join in one action as plaintiffs \"if they \nassert any right or relief jointly, severally or, in the alternative, in respect of or arising out of the \n-21 -\n\nsame transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law \nor fact common to all these persons will arise in the action\". \nCourts have regularly approved joinder of plaintiffs in civil-rights cases.  In Alexander v. \nFulton County, 207 F.3d 1303, 1324 (lIth Cir. 2000), 18 plaintiffs alleged that they were subject \nto systemic employment discrimination which arose from the same transaction or occurrence and \nraised common questions of law and fact, making joinder the plaintiffs proper under Rule 20. \nLikewise, in Puricelli v.  CNA Ins.  Co., 185 F.R.D. 139, 142-143 (N.D.N.Y. 1999), the fact that \nplaintiffs were terminated at  different times,  under different  circumstances, and by different \nsupervisors  do  not  compel  conclusion that the  claims  arose  from  a different transaction  or \noccurrence. \nAs explained above, \"a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication\" of this case.  See Rule 23(b)(3).  The individual victims of Defendants' \nunconstitutional  conduct  deserve  their  day  in  court.  If the  Court  concludes  that  there  are \nobstacles  to  class  certification,  then to  do  substantial justice and preserve the rights  of the \nindividuals who have been recently discovered or will be discovered, the Court should permit \njoinder and continue to toll the limitations period until the conclusion of all discovery in this \ncase. \n-22-\n\nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant class certification under both Rule 23(b )(2) and Rule 23(b )(3). \nRespectfully submitted, \nlsi Stephen Wasinger \nChristopher J.

That  text  is  straightforward  and \nunmistakable, and not prone to ambiguity. It reads: \n(a) Applicability of Administrative Remedies  \nNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under \n§ 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law by a prisoner confined in \nany jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative \nremedies as are available are exhausted.  \n42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). \nA  natural  reading  of  the  statute  suggests  that  its  application  requires \nconsideration  of  three  simple  questions.  First,  is  plaintiff  “a  prisoner \nconfined in [a] jail, prison, or other correctional facility?” If not, the statute \nis inapplicable. * * * [332 F.3d at 425.  Emphasis added.] \nThe Sixth Circuit continued: \nFirst — and most significant — even assuming that the statutory purpose \nmay  be  characterized  as  plaintiff  suggests,  because  the  statute  is \nunambiguous it is inappropriate for us even to consider it. In directing the \ncourt’s  attention  to  legislative  intent,  plaintiff  overlooks  the  well-\nestablished  and  long-recognized  rule  that,  where  a  statute  is  free  of \nambiguity, it is to be applied as written. The Supreme Court has instructed  \nad nauseam: “[I]n interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to \n \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 203     Filed 11/10/2005     Page 5 of 11(cid:10)\n \none, cardinal canon before all others,” which is “that courts must presume \nthat a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what \nit says there.” The Court has made clear that “[w]hen the words of a statute \nare unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: judicial inquiry is \ncomplete.” * * *  \nThe court would note that, while the discrete issue presented by the instant \ncase is one of first impression, its holding today is in keeping with recent \nSupreme  Court  and  circuit  precedent.  Significantly,  both  the  Supreme \nCourt and this court have recently declined to carve out exceptions to the \nplain language of § 1997e(a).  [332 F.3d at 226.  Internal citations omitted.] \n  In Kerr v. Puckett, 138 F.3d 321, 322-323 (7th Cir. 1998), the Seventh Circuit expressly \nconsidered the “physical injury” provision in § 1997e(e) and rejected the position now being \nadvocated by Defendants.  Judge Easterbrook, who wrote the Kerr opinion, explained: \nKerr  brought  the  suit  after  he  had  been  released  on  parole  and  was \ntherefore  no  longer  “confined  in  a  jail,  prison,  or  other  correctional \nfacility”.  Nonetheless  the  district  court  applied  this  statute,  because \n“common sense and the overall purposes of the PLRA favor application of \n§ 1997e(e) to actions brought by former prisoners.” 967 F.Supp. at 362, \nquoting from Zehner v. Trigg, 952 F.Supp. 1318, 1325 (S.D.Ind.), affirmed \non other grounds, 133 F.3d 459 (7th Cir.1997). What sense would it make, \nthe judge wondered, to say that a person may not recover damages for \nmental injuries while he remained in prison, but may seek that remedy the \nday after release? \n“Common sense” is a treacherous guide to statutory interpretation. One \nperson’s “common sense” is another’s bête noire. Statutes are compromises \namong legislators who may hold incompatible conceptions of the public \nweal. Some legislators opposed the PLRA outright; others wanted more \nsweeping restrictions on prisoners’ litigation; the actual statute satisfied \nfew  completely.  Instead  of  relying  on  “common  sense”,  which  is  an \ninvitation to treat the law as if one side or the other had its way, a court \nshould implement the language actually enacted — provided the statute is \nnot  internally  inconsistent  or  otherwise  absurd. E.g., Salinas v. United \nStates, 522 U.S. 52, —, 118 S.Ct. 469, 473-74, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997); \nFelker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996).  \nSection 1997e(e) as enacted is self-consistent and simple to understand. \nA  “prisoner”  cannot  bring  an  action  for  mental  injury  unless  he  has \nsuffered  physical  injury  too.  Just  in  case  anyone  might  be  tempted  to \nequate “prisoner” with “ex-prisoner” — to think that “prisoner” refers to \nthe plaintiff’s status at the time of the injury rather than at the time the \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 203     Filed 11/10/2005     Page 6 of 11(cid:10)\n \nlitigation begins, cf. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 117 S.Ct. \n843,  136  L.Ed.2d  808  (1997)  —  the  statute  says  that  its  object  is  a \n“prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility” (emphasis \nadded).  Then there is an explicit definition in § 1997e(h):  \nAs  used  in  this  section,  the  term  “prisoner”  means  any  person \nincarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, \nsentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law \nor the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or \ndiversionary program.  \nThe statutory language does not leave wriggle room; a convict out on \nparole is not a “person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is \n. . .  adjudicated  delinquent  for,  violations  of  . . .  the  terms  and \nconditions of parole”. Most sections of the PLRA use the term “prisoner,” \nand we held in Robbins v. Switzer, 104 F.3d 895 (7th Cir.1997), that in 28 \nU.S.C. § 1915(b) this term does not comprehend a felon who has been \nreleased.  § 1997e(h) shows that the same reading is right for § 1997e.  So \nby waiting until his release from prison Kerr avoided § 1997e(e).  Cf. \nAbdul-Wadood  v.  Nathan,  91  F.3d  1023  (7th  Cir.1996)  (holding  with \nrespect to another part of the PLRA that the court must determine the \nprisoner’s status on the date the suit or appeal is “brought” rather than at \nsome other time).  [Emphasis added.] \n  Similarly, in Harris v. Garner, 216 F.3d 970, 976-80 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc), the \nEleventh Circuit rejected the position now advocated by Defendants: \nThe legislative history of the PLRA shows that Congress was concerned \nwith the number of prisoner cases being filed, and its intent behind the \nlegislation was to reduce the number cases filed, which is why Congress \nmade confinement status at the time of filing the decisive factor.  [216 F.3d \nat 978] \nSee also Janes v. Hernandez, 215 F.3d 541, 543 (5th Cir. 2000) (specifically approving Kerr); \nDoe v. Washington County, 150 F.3d 920, 924 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that, because plaintiff \nwas not incarcerated or detained when he filed complaint, PLRA did not apply); Kelsey v. \nCounty of Schoharie, 2005 WL 1972557 at *1-3 (N.D.N.Y., Aug. 5, 2005) (discussed below); \nGibson v. Kendrick, 2005 WL 1309161 at *1 (E.D.La., May 19, 2005) (because Gibson was not \na prisoner when he brought this suit, the PLRA and its physical injury requirement do not apply); \nBillingsley v. Shelby County Dept. of Correction, 2004 WL 2757915 at *7 n.4 (W.D.Tenn., Nov. \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 203     Filed 11/10/2005     Page 7 of 11(cid:10)\n \n24, 2004) (“However, as the Plaintiff was not incarcerated at the time the complaint was filed, \nthe PLRA does not apply.”). \n  Defendants rely on Cox v. Malone, 199 F.Supp.2d 135, 140 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), aff’d, 56 \nFed.Appx. 43, 2003 WL 366724 (2d Cir. 2002).  Second Circuit Rules bars use of the opinion \noutside the Cox litigation.  See 2d Cir. R. 0.23, cited in Kelsey, at *3.   \n  In Kelsey, another district judge in the Second Circuit refused to follow Cox on the \ngrounds that (1) the court of appeals’ decision was explicitly non-precedential under governing \nrules and (2) the analysis is incorrect.  The Kelsey court explained:  \nThe issue presented here is whether § 1997e(e) applies where plaintiffs \nwere no longer incarcerated when the action was commenced. The plain \nlanguage of § 1997e(e), the declared purpose of the PLRA, and case law \nsupport the conclusion that the limitation of § 1997e(e) is inapplicable \nwhere  a  plaintiff  is  no  longer  incarcerated.  The  plain  language  of \n§ 1997e(e) limits its applicability to “a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, \nor other correctional facility.” That language clearly limits the provision to \nindividuals who are incarcerated when an action is commenced. There is \nno dispute here that the named plaintiffs and potential class members were \nnot incarcerated when the action was commenced. \nThis interpretation of that language is supported by the purpose of the \nPLRA, which was “to curtail what Congress perceived to be inmate abuses \nof  the  judicial  process.”  Ortiz  v.  McBride,  380  F  .3d  649,  658  (2d \nCir.2004);  see  also  Greig  v.  Goord,  169  F.3d  165,  167  (2d  Cir.1999) \n(finding that the Congressional concern motivating the enactment of the \nPLRA was that lawsuits had become a “recreational activity for long-term \nresidents  of  our  prisons”  and  presented  “a  means  of  gaining  a  short \nsabbatical in the nearest Federal courthouse”). Thus, where, as here, the \nplaintiffs are not inmates when an action is commenced, the purposes of \nthe PLRA would not be served by application of the statute. \nAlthough the Second Circuit has yet to address the issue, it appears that the \ntwo courts of appeals which have considered the issue have drawn the \nsame  conclusion.  See  Harris  v.  Garner,  216  F.3d  970,  976-80  (11th \nCir.2000) (en banc) (“Because section 1997e(e) applies only to claims filed \nwhile an inmate is confined, it does not prevent a former prisoner from \nfiling after release a monetary damages claim for mental and emotional \ninjury  suffered  while  confined,  without  a  prior  showing  of  physical \n- 4 - \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 203     Filed 11/10/2005     Page 8 of 11(cid:10)\n \ninjury.”); Kerr v. Puckett, 138 F.3d 321, 322-23 (7th Cir.1998) (holding \nthat “by waiting until his release from prison Kerr avoided § 1997e(e).”). \nWith two exceptions discussed below, district courts have held the same. \nSee, e.g., Smith v. Franklin County, 227 F.Supp.2d 667, 676 (E.D.Ky.2002) \n(holding that plaintiff who had been released from the county jail before \ncommencing an action concerning the conditions of her incarceration was \nnot bound by the limitations of the PLRA); Doan v. Watson, 168 F.Supp.2d \n932, 935 (S.D.Ind.2001) (holding that where former inmates filed suit to \nrecover  damages  based  on  strip  searches  conducted  by  defendants, \n“[b]ecause Plaintiffs filed their claims following their detention, the PLRA \ndoes not require them to produce evidence of physical injury to pursue \ntheir claims.”); Lee v. State of New York Dep’t of Correctional Servs., No. \n97 Civ. 7112(DAB), 1999 WL 673339, at *4 & n. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, \n1999) (“Moreover, at the time that this suit was filed, Plaintiff’s son was no \nlonger  even  incarcerated,  thereby  removing  him  even  further  from  the \ndefinition of ‘prisoner’ under the PLRA.”) \nDefendants rely on Cox v. Malone, 199 F.Supp.2d 135 (S.D.N.Y.2002), \naff’d, 56 Fed.Appx. 43 (2d Cir.2003). There, a former state prisoner sued \nstate  officials  alleging  the  excessive  use  of  force  during  a  search  in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Defendants moved for summary judgment \non the ground, inter alia, that the physical injury alleged by plaintiff was de \nminimis and, therefore, failed to satisfy the physical injury requirement of \n§ 1997e(e). The district court granted the motion, holding that § 1997e(e) \napplied to plaintiff even though he had been released from custody before \ncommencing the action. The court reasoned that  \nSection 1997e(e) . . . is a substantive limitation on the type of actions \nthat can be brought by prisoners. Its purpose is to weed out frivolous \nclaims  where  only  emotional  injuries  are  alleged.  This  purpose  is \naccomplished whether section 1997e(e) is applied to suits brought by \ninmates  incarcerated  at  the  time  of  filing  or  by  former  inmates \nincarcerated at the time of the alleged injury but subsequently released. \nThe fortuity of release on parole does not affect the kind of damages \nthat must be alleged in order to survive the gate-keeping function of \nsection  1997e(e).  Because  plaintiff’s  suit  alleges  only  emotional \ninjuries, it is barred by the PLRA irrespective of his status as a parolee \nat the time of filing. \nId. at 140. The Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s holding in an \nunpublished opinion “for substantially the reasons stated in the district \ncourt’s thorough and well-reasoned opinion.” 56 Fed.Appx. 43; see also \nLipton  v.  County  of  Orange,  315  F.Supp.2d  434,  456  &  n.  29 \n(S.D.N.Y.2004) (following Cox ). \n- 5 - \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 203     Filed 11/10/2005     Page 9 of 11(cid:10)\n \nCox does not address the contrary authority discussed above and its \nrationale appears founded on an analysis not supported by the plain \nlanguage  of  § 1997e(e)  upon  which  other  courts  have  relied.  Cox \ncorrectly notes that limiting § 1997e(e) to those incarcerated at the time an \naction is commenced leaves to the “fortuity” of a prisoner’s release date \nwhether  he  or  she  will  fall  under  or  escape  § 1997e(e)’s  limitations. \nHowever, if Congress intended § 1997e(e) to apply to prisoners released \nfrom  custody  when  an  action  is  commenced,  statutory  language  to \naccomplish this end was available. The language chosen by Congress in \n§ 1997e(e) plainly limited its applicability to prisoners incarcerated at the \ntime an action is commenced, was consistent with the purposes of the \nPLRA,  and  such  Congressional  determination  and  intent  are  not \nunreasonable. \nThe Cox decision, of course, does not constitute binding precedent for this \nCourt. Were it simply a matter of analyzing the Cox decision in light of the \nKerr line of cases addressing the scope of § 1997e(e), the Kerr line of \ncases holding that the plain meaning of the language in § 1997e(e) limits \nits  applicability  to  prisoners  incarcerated  at  the  time  an  action  is \ncommenced is most persuasive. The Second Circuit’s affirmance described \nthat decision as “thorough and well-reasoned.” That affirmance, however, \nwas unpublished and by Second Circuit rule, may not be cited as authority \noutside the Cox litigation. See 2d Cir. R. 0.23. Thus, the question becomes \nwhether the Second Circuit’s unpublished affirmance of Cox should lead a \ncourt in these circumstances to follow Cox. \nFor at least two reasons, it does not. First, Second Circuit Rule 0.23, \nrestated on the Cox affirmance, explicitly limits the precedential value of \nthe affirmance to the Cox case itself and bars its use in this and other cases. \nThat rule should be followed unless and until the Second Circuit directs \notherwise.  Second,  neither  Cox  nor  the  Second  Circuit  have  directly \nconsidered  or  addressed  the  Kerr  line  of  cases  and  their  compelling \nrationale. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the rationale of the \nKerr line of cases is adopted. Because plaintiffs were not incarcerated at \nthe time this action was commenced, § 1997e(e) is inapplicable and the \ndefense  which  the  County  seeks  to  add  in  its  proposed  amended \nanswer would be futile. Therefore, the County’s motion to file and \nserve an amended answer is denied. \n- 6 - \n\nCase 1:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 203     Filed 11/10/2005     Page 10 of 11(cid:10)\n \nCONCLUSION \n  The plain language of the PLRA compels the conclusion that the PLRA and its physical \ninjury requirement do not bar Plaintiffs’ claims for relief.  Therefore, the Court should reject \nDefendants’ motion to add PLRA affirmative defenses because the amendment would be futile.  \n \n \n/s/ Stephen Wasinger          \n \nChristopher J.

The plaintiffs responded in opposition to the motion, and the Court heard\narguments on the motion in open court on June 30, 2006.  Based on the information presented, the\nCourt believes that all parties are participating and will continue to participate in settlement\n\nCase 2:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 235      Filed 07/19/2007     Page 2 of 5\ndiscussions in god faith.  No sanctions are appropriate at this time, and certainly dismissal is not\ncalled for.\nOn January 18, 2006, the Court ordered the parties to participate in a settlement conference\nwith Judge Patrick Duggan of this court to take place on February 6, 2006.  The Court directed the\nparties “to appear in person with the clients or decision makers with full settlement authority.” \nThe next day, the Court scheduled a facilitative mediation session to take place by March\n15, 2006 if the settlement conference did not resolve the matter.  The parties agreed to amend the\nfacilitation order, and on March 14, 2006 the Court entered an order appointing former Wayne\nCounty, Michigan circuit judge Pamela Harwood as a facilitator to conduct a mediation session\nbefore March 31, 2006.  The Court order provided that “[a]ll parties or individuals with settlement\nauthority are required to attend the facilitative mediation sessions.  All parties are directed to attend\nall scheduled mediation session(s) with their respective counsel of record.  Corporate parties must\nbe represented by an agent with authority to negotiate a binding settlement.”  Docket # 221.\nThe defendants state the plaintiffs failed to appear at settlement conferences on February 6,\n2006 before Judge Duggan and April 24, 2006 with Judge Harwood.  Only the plaintiffs’ attorneys\nappeared, in direct violation of this Court’s orders.  The defendants believe further attempts at\nsettlement would be meaningless unless the plaintiffs attend.  The defendants argue that the plaintiffs\nhave “repeatedly failed to participate in the prosecution of the case and have defied discovery and\npretrial orders.”  The defendants ask for dismissal and/or sanctions.  The defendants’ motion does\nnot state that concurrence was sought, as required by E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(a).\nThe plaintiffs attorneys admit no plaintiffs were present at the February 6, 2006 conference,\nbut prior to that session Mr. Pianto made contact with all but two Rose plaintiffs and obtained\n-2-\n\nCase 2:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 235      Filed 07/19/2007     Page 3 of 5\nsettlement authority.  At the settlement conference, no objection was made to the plaintiffs’ absence\nby Judge Duggan, who was conducting the mediation, or by defense counsel.  The plaintiffs believe\nthey substantially complied with the Court’s order, which required that “[a]ll parties or individuals\nwith settlement authority are required to attend.”\nThe parties subsequently began discussing a global settlement of all four of the related cases\n– Rose, Brabant v. Saginaw County, Abner v. Saginaw County, and  Whittum v. Saginaw County –\nin which there are approximately 94 plaintiffs.  On March 16, 2006, a telephone conference was\nconducted with the parties and Judge Harwood.  The plaintiffs state it was agreed that the plaintiffs\nthemselves did not need to attend conferences involving discussion of a global settlement.\nPlaintiffs’ counsel explains that none of the plaintiffs appeared at the April mediation session for\nthat reason.  At the conference, defendants were upset that the plaintiffs were not present, but the\nplaintiffs’ attorneys apparently were surprised given the previously recited agreement.  The\nplaintiffs’ attorneys offered to produce the plaintiffs the following day, but the defendants rejected\nthe offer.  The plaintiffs state that global settlement discussions have continued with Judge\nHarwood.   They have stalled, however, because the parties have been waiting for this Court’s\ndecision on the summary judgment motions filed in Abner and Brabant. \nThe settlement conferences ordered by the Court are pretrial conferences governed by\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 16.  That rule includes the following provision:\nIf a party or party’s attorney fails to obey a scheduling or pretrial order, or if no\nappearance is made on behalf of a party at a scheduling or pretrial conference, or if\na  party  or  party’s  attorney  is  substantially  unprepared  to  participate  in  the\nconference, or if a party or party’s attorney fails to participate in good faith, the\njudge, upon motion or the judge's own initiative, may make such orders with regard\nthereto as are just, and among others any of the orders provided in Rule 37(b)(2)(B),\n(C), (D).\n-3-\n\nCase 2:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 235      Filed 07/19/2007     Page 4 of 5\nFed. R. Civ. Pro. 16(f).  Rule 37(b)(2) allows the court to impose a variety of sanctions for\ndisobeying a court order, including dismissal and contempt.  However, courts should not impose the\nultimate penalty absent clear abuse of its orders by counsel amounting to contempt.  Freeland v.\nAmigo, 103 F.3d 1271, 1277 (6th Cir. 1997) (holding that “absent a clear record of delay or\ncontumacious conduct, an abuse of discretion occurs if the district court dismisses an action with\nprejudice”) (citing Carter v. City of Memphis, 636 F.2d 159, 161 (6th Cir. 1980)).   The propriety\nof a dismissal as a sanction under Rule 37 generally is assessed in light of four factors identified by\nthe Sixth Circuit in Regional Refuse Sys. v. Inland Reclamation Co., 842 F.2d 150, 154 (6th Cir.\n1988), which were succinctly summarized by the court in United States v. Reyes, 307 F.3d 451 (6th\nCir. 2002), as follows: “(1) whether the party’s failure is due to willfulness, bad faith, or fault; (2)\nwhether the adversary was prejudiced by the dismissed party’s conduct; (3) whether the dismissed\nparty was warned that failure to cooperate could lead to dismissal; and (4) whether less drastic\nsanctions were imposed or considered before dismissal was ordered.”  Id. at 458.\nIn this case, none of the four factors favors dismissal.  The plaintiffs’ counsel attempted to\ncomply with the first order, which directed the parties “to appear in person with the clients or\ndecision makers with full settlement authority.” Docket # 228.  Mr. Pianto had settlement authority\nfrom 20 of the 22 Rose plaintiffs.  Although the Court’s preference in the second order for personal\nappearances by the parties themselves is clear, the order does allow  “[a]ll parties or individuals with\nsettlement authority” to attend.  More importantly, if global settlement talks were underway,\nrequiring all the plaintiffs to attend is impractical until the discussions begin to focus on the\nindividual claims, if they ever do.\n-4-\n\nCase 2:01-cv-10337-DML     Document 235      Filed 07/19/2007     Page 5 of 5\nFinally, the defendants cannot demonstrate that the plaintiffs’ actions were wilful or in bad\nfaith, and the defendants were not prejudiced.  The defendants have not stated that they were ready\nto settle this case but were unable because the plaintiffs were not present.

The Saginaw County sheriff instituted a policy and practice of housing\n906 uncooperative and disruptive detainees in administrative segregation cells; and jail *906 personnel would take all\nof the clothing from such detainees so that they were naked for the time that they spent in administrative\nsegregation. All of the plaintiffs were subjected to this treatment, and some of them allege that they were viewed\nwhile naked by jail personnel and inmates of the opposite gender. The defendants have filed a motion for\njudgment on the pleadings or alternately for summary judgment, and the plaintiffs have filed a cross motion for\npartial summary judgment. The Court heard arguments from counsel in open court on March 16, 2004, and the\nmatter is now ready for decision. The plaintiffs also have filed additional procedural motions.\nThe Court finds that the County's policy of confining detainees without any clothing or covering whatsoever is\nunconstitutional; the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from the federal claims; all\ndefendants are entitled to governmental immunity from the state law claims; the plaintiffs have not established\nfacts sufficient to withstand summary judgment on their claim under the state civil rights act; and the plaintiffs'\nrecently-filed procedural motions and motion for a preliminary injunction lack merit. The Court, therefore, will\ngrant in part and deny in part the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, grant in part and deny in part the\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment, and deny the plaintiffs' procedural motions and motion for a\npreliminary injunction.\n\nI.\nThis case arises from the alleged mistreatment of twenty-seven plaintiffs while they were in custody at the\nSaginaw County Jail. The jail is a detention facility operated by Saginaw County to detain arrestees awaiting trial\nand offenders sentenced to custodial terms of one year or less. The facility holds 525 people at maximum\ncapacity and receives between forty and sixty individuals per day from several law enforcement agencies within\nSaginaw County; it takes in between 12,000 and 14,000 people per year. The defendants estimate that ten\npercent or fewer of the detainees are female.\nThe plaintiffs were processed through the jail between May 22, 1999 and December 29, 2001. During this time\nover 30,000 people were processed through the jail. Each of the plaintiffs was in some way uncooperative or\ndisruptive during the booking process and therefore was subjected to the jail administrator's policy of being\nplaced in administrative segregation. The jail administrator described the policy as follows:\nThat if an individual, not just because they're disruptive or disorderly, if they violate the security measures of that\njail, or pose harm to themselves or others, the correction officer could request from the sergeant permission to\nescort the person to segregation administration.\nDefs.' Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. A, Dep. of William Gutzwiller at 33.\nWhenever a person is placed in administrative segregation, it is the policy and practice of the Saginaw County jail\npersonnel to remove the person's clothing and put the detainee in the segregation cell naked. A detainee's\nclothes are forcefully removed if he or she does not voluntarily comply with jail personnel orders to remove the\nclothes prior to entering the administrative segregation cell. Saginaw County deputy sheriff sergeant Gary Van\nRiper testified: \"Clothes would be removed from a person if they did not want them taken off because that's what-\nthe ruling from the command or the policy, however you want to look at it. I guess, stated, that they would go in\nthere with no clothes on, yes.\" Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. B, Dep. of Gary VanRiper at 21. The record evidence\n907 discloses that only a detainee who disrupts the security of the jail, *907 disrupts the orderly operation of the jail,\nor is assaultive towards themselves, another detainee, or staff, is placed in administrative segregation. However,\nthe policy of removing clothes is applied to those in administrative segregation without regard to the nature of the\noffense for which they are detained and in the absence of any individualized suspicion of drugs, weapons,\ncontraband, or threat of suicide. None of the plaintiffs were placed in the jail's general population or on suicide\nwatch.\nIf a detainee failed to comply with orders to remove his or her clothing prior to placement in the administrative\nsegregation cell, limited force was administered to remove the clothes. \"[O]nly the force necessary to do it\" was\nused. Ibid. Male officers would assist in the removal of a female detainee's clothes if the female detainee\nthreatened the female officer's safety. Id. at 22 (stating that \"[t]he only time a male would be present when a\nfemale was taking off her clothes is if she became violent to the point where the female officer's safety was in\ndanger\").\nAccording to the defendants, the naked confinement policy was formulated in August 1996 following an incident\nthat ended in the suicide of a detainee who had been placed in administrative segregation. Apparently, the\ndetainee, dressed in a standard-issue orange jail jumpsuit, was placed in the administrative segregation cell and\nleft unobserved and unattended for several hours. The defendants report that this detainee wedged his jail\nuniform into the tiny space between the cell door and the door frame and hanged himself. About three months\nlater, another inmate purportedly vandalized one of the direct observation cells and rendered it unusable. The\ndefendants' response to these events was the policy that called for disruptive detainees to be placed in\nadministration cells and mandated that \"any inmate placed into these cells would be placed into them without\nclothes.\" Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. D, Defs' Ans. to Pls.' First Interrog. and Second Request for Prod. of Docs.\nat No. 16 (italics deleted).\nThe defendants' policy required a detainee to remain in administrative segregation until such time that he or she\nno longer posed a threat to himself or herself, others, jail staff, or the secure operations of the jail. See Defs.' Mot.\n\nfor Summ. J., Ex. C, Dep. of Sheriff Brown at 49. (asserting that \"[i]t's taking away the chance that that person\nmay hurt themselves or somebody else, and once they sober up or once they become cognizant of what they're\ndoing, you may have saved that person from tremendous injury\").\nThe parties have submitted incident reports from the jail that recount the circumstances under which jail\npersonnel decided to place the various plaintiffs in administrative segregation:\nLinda Rose:\nAt the above date and time [1/27/01], female listed above was housed in 1IOC2 and began pounding and kicking\nthe door.

This S/C and Deputies\nBrown, Kolb, and Thom entered the cell to remove the paper. This was done without incident.\nTwo minutes later Inmate Cradit was placing her jean shorts in the toilet and flooding the cell again.

Cradit\nthreatened to kill all of the officers \"When she sees us in the streets.\"\nThis S/C, S/O Allen, S/O Miller, S/O Bates, Deputy Kolb, Deputy Thom, Deputy Brown, and Nurse Sharrow were\npresent during the incident ...

Ex. 14 at 40.\nThe plaintiffs filed a complaint in this Court on October 19, 2001 alleging a violation of their constitutional rights\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment via 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as well as\nclaims sounding in gross negligence, invasion of privacy, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress, and gender discrimination under the Michigan Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws §\n37.2101, et seq. The complaint has been amended six times, mostly to add or delete plaintiffs.\nDuring various case management and status conferences, the parties discussed a mechanism for resolving the\ndisputes of the several plaintiffs, and at one point it appeared that the municipal defendant would admit liability\nand arbitrate the issue of damages. It has been represented to this Court that Saginaw County no longer adheres\nto its naked confinement policy, and therefore it has discontinued the conduct that the plaintiffs have found\noffensive. However, new counsel substituted on behalf of the defendants, who now vigorously contest liability.\nThe defendants have filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings or in the alternative for summary judgment.\n915 They argue that the conditions of confinement of the plaintiffs did not violate their constitutional rights because \n*915 the regulations imposed on those detainees placed in administrative segregation were reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests. The County asserts that all state tort claims must be dismissed on the basis of\ngovernmental immunity. Sheriff Charles Brown and the unnamed officers contend that they are entitled to\nqualified immunity on the federal claims and absolute immunity from the plaintiffs' state tort claims.\nThe plaintiffs likewise have moved for summary judgment. They argue that Saginaw County's naked confinement\npolicy was unconstitutional as a matter of law, and therefore they were subjected to unreasonable and illegal\nconditions of confinement.\nII.\nA motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) on the ground that the\ncomplaint does not state a cognizable claim is reviewed under the standards that govern motions brought under\nRule 12(b)(6). See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h); Ziegler v. IBP Hog Market, Inc., 249 F.3d 509, 511 (6th Cir.2001); Morgan\nv. Church's Fried Chicken, 829 F.2d 10, 11 (6th Cir.1987). The purpose of a motion under Rule 12(b) is to test the\nlegal sufficiency of the complaint, not the probability of success on the merits. Ecclesiastical Order of the Ism of\nAm, Inc. v. Chasin, 653 F.Supp. 1200, 1205 (E.D.Mich.1986). In considering a motion to dismiss under\n\nFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the allegations in the complaint are taken as true and are viewed in the light most favorable\nto the non-moving party. Herrada v. City of Detroit, 275 F.3d 553, 556 (6th Cir.2001). The Court may consider\nonly whether the allegations contained in the complaint state a claim for which relief can be granted. Roth Steel\nProds. v. Sharon Steel Corp., 705 F.2d 134, 155 (6th Cir.1983). The motion may be granted only if \"it appears\nbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\" \nBuchanan v. Apfel, 249 F.3d 485, 488 (6th Cir.2001) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99,\n2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). However, \"the complaint is not to be dismissed because the plaintiff has misconceived the\nproper theory of the claim, if he is entitled to any relief under any theory.\" Myers v. United States, 636 F.2d 166,\n169 (6th Cir.1981). If matters outside the pleadings must be considered in ruling on the merits of the claim, as\nhere, the motion more properly should follow the standards and procedures of Rule 56, and reviewing courts\ngenerally will treat the motion as one for summary judgment. Michigan Paytel Joint Venture v. City of Detroit, 287\nF.3d 527, 533 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting Soper v. Hoben, 195 F.3d 845, 850 (6th Cir.1999)). The defendants have\nmade liberal and frequent references in their motion briefs to the evidentiary record assembled through the\ndiscovery process. The Court believes, therefore, that the defendants' motion ought to be adjudicated under their\nalternate theory as a motion for summary judgment.\nSummary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\" Fed.R.Civ.P.\n56(c). The parties have filed cross motions for summary judgment, and neither suggests that there are facts in\ndispute. Nonetheless, the Court must apply the well-recognized standards when deciding cross motions; \"[t]he\nfact that the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment does not mean, of course, that summary\njudgment for one side or the other is necessarily appropriate.\" Parks v. LaFace Records, 329 F.3d 437, 444 (6th\n916 Cir.2003). Thus, *916 when this Court evaluates cross motions for summary judgment, it \"must evaluate each\nmotion on its own merits and view all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" \nWestfield Ins. Co. v. Tech Dry, Inc., 336 F.3d 503, 506-07 (6th Cir.2003).\nA motion for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 presumes the absence of a genuine issue of material fact\nfor trial. The Court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party,\nand determine \"whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or\nwhether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\nU.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \"Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a\nrational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus.\nCo., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (quotation and citation\nomitted).\nThe basic facts, recited above, are not in serious dispute. The practice of stripping naked all jail detainees placed\nin administrative segregation was memorialized in a formal jail policy consistently and regularly applied by\nSaginaw County jail personnel at the direction of the County's chief law enforcement officer. Therefore, if the\npolicy is unconstitutional, the plaintiffs have established a case of municipal liability under Monell v. Department\nof Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 698, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (holding that municipal liability will\nbe found when the alleged unconstitutional act \"implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance,\nregulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by the body's officers\"); see also Berry v. City of Detroit,\n25 F.3d 1342, 1345 (6th Cir.1994) (observing that a municipality also \"may be sued for constitutional deprivations\nvisited pursuant to governmental `custom' even though such custom has not received formal approval through\nthe body's official decision making channels\"). Since the County concedes that the individual officers acted\npursuant to an established policy, it is unnecessary to pursue the plaintiffs' failure-to-train theory because that\nclaim is simply an alternate method of establishing an unconstitutional act that was committed by the municipality\nitself. See City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 390, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989) (holding\nthat \"[t]he issue in a [failure-to-train] case ... is whether that training program is adequate; and if it is not, the\nquestion becomes whether such inadequate training can justifiably be said to represent `city policy'\").\nIn addition, for the purpose of these motions the plaintiffs do not contest that probable cause existed to seize\nthem and detain them in the jail. However, they insist that the otherwise proper seizure of the plaintiffs was\ntransformed into an unreasonable seizure as soon as their clothes were removed pursuant to a policy that\napplied to non-violent misdemeanants and did not require individualized suspicion of possession of drugs,\n\nweapons, contraband, or threat of suicide. They also assert that no legitimate purpose existed for allowing\nmembers of the opposite sex to participate in disrobing detainees, sometimes forcefully. Finally, they contend that\nliability should not be an issue in this case because of an alleged prior stipulation by the defendants.\nA.\nThe question whether the defendants stipulated to liability admits of ready disposition. The plaintiffs claim that a\n917 prior attorney for the defendants agreed *917 to admit liability and then submit the issue of damages for each\nindividual plaintiff to facilitative mediation. Present counsel for the defendants does not subscribe to that\nagreement.\nThe plaintiffs previously filed a motion to establish liability on September 11, 2002, which the Court construed as\na motion for partial summary judgment and denied. The Court found \"that the plaintiffs have failed to make the\nrequired showing for summary judgment.... Plaintiffs' reliance on letters between counsel discussing settlement\nproposal is inappropriate, as such evidence would not be admissible at trial. See Federal Rule of Evidence 408\n(barring introduction of offers to compromise).... At a chambers conference, [previous] defense counsel did\nindicate that he was inclined to admit liability and contest damages only.... On the current record, however, there\nis no basis for concluding that the facts material to a determination [of] liability are undisputed, thus entitling the\nplaintiffs to judgment as a matter of law.\" See October 10, 2002 Order Denying Motion to Exclude Prior Arrests\nand Convictions, Denying Motion to Establish Liability and Granting Motion to Amend Complaint. The plaintiffs\nfiled a second motion to affirm the parties' stipulation to liability on November 7, 2002, which the Court on July 3,\n2003 found to be mooted by the by the plaintiffs' present motion for summary judgment.\nThe plaintiffs now offer numerous letters, Exs. 22 and 23 to Pls.' App., an affidavit by counsel, Ex. 24 to Pls.' App.,\nand the following evidence regarding the issue of a stipulation by the defendants at a deposition admitting\nliability:\nMr. Fletcher [plaintiffs' counsel]: Just so that I understand we have an agreement that you guys are stipulating to\nliability on the 1983 action only?\nMr. Jensen [defense counsel]: Yes.\nMr. Fletcher: Okay. And that you're going to supply that with the Court?\nMr. Jensen: Yes.\nMr. Fletcher: Okay. And I believe that you indicated to me, I think this should be on the record, both you, Mr.\nDeGrazia and also the risk manager who I believe is Ms. Kelly.\nMs. Lenhart: Kelly Lenhart.\nMr. Fletcher: Kelly Lenhart. That you guys all agree that that's a done deal?\nMr. Jensen: Yes.\nMr. Fletcher: Okay. I just want a separate record for that.\nTr. of statement (10/28/2002), Pls.' App. Ex. 26.\nThe primary function of a stipulation is to narrow disputes. Leuhsler v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, 963 F.2d 907,\n911 (6th Cir.1992). Although stipulations waiving an issue or argument that might otherwise be tried will generally\nbe treated as conclusive and binding, ibid., the validity of a stipulation is dependant upon a clear and unequivocal\nexpression either in writing or in open court. See Orsini v. Kugel, 9 F.3d 1042 (2d Cir.1993); but see Oliver v. City\nof Shattuck ex rel. Versluis, 157 F.2d 150, 153 (10th Cir.1946) (observing that \"[i]t is true that ordinarily courts will\nnot recognize or give effect to oral agreements not made in the presence of the court or without the Court's\nknowledge ... But this rule is sufficiently flexible to allow courts to give effect to oral agreements between parties,\nif failure to do so would allow one party to take an unconscientious advantage of his breach.\"). The Sixth Circuit\n\nrecognizes that an oral stipulation can form the basis of an estoppel when an opposite party relies to his\ndetriment on the representation. See United States v. Spikes, 158 F.3d 913, 928 (6th Cir.1998) (stating that\n918 \"[w]here one side's efforts at presenting its theory of the case is actually prejudiced by the other *918 side\nreneging on its obligations under the [informal stipulation], some form of relief is appropriate\"). However, there is\nno evidence in this case that the plaintiffs were prejudiced in the preparation of their case as a result of such\nreliance.\nRecognizing that informal or oral stipulations can cause confusion, this District enacted a local rule to address the\nformal requirements of stipulations:\n(b) Stipulations and Orders; Service of Orders. The party initiating a stipulation and proposing an order shall\nsubmit a self-addressed stamped envelope and shall be responsible for serving copies of an order on all parties\nwithin 10 days of the date of the order, unless otherwise directed by the judge in a particular case.\nE.D. Mich. LR 5.2(b). In this case, despite the deposition transcript offered by the plaintiffs, no clear and\nunequivocal expression of this agreement was expressed in open court; nor did the parties reduce the stipulation\nto a signed writing. The plaintiffs also failed to submit an order regarding the stipulation to the Court as required\nby E.D. Mich. LR 5.2(b). The purported stipulation, therefore, is ineffective unless the plaintiffs demonstrate that\nthey relied upon this agreement to their detriment, which they have failed to do.\nB.\nThe critical question in this case is whether the County's policy of removing the clothing of all detainees placed in\nadministrative segregation violates the Constitution, since the plaintiffs have the burden when asserting a claim\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 of proving that (1) that there was a deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution and\n(2) that the deprivation was caused by a person acting under of color of state law. Wittstock v. Mark A. Van Sile,\nInc. 330 F.3d 899, 902 (6th Cir.2003). Although the defendants do not dispute that the second element has been\nestablished, they vigorously contest the plaintiffs' contention that the challenged practice violated rights under the\nFourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nThe seminal case dealing with the constitutionality of conditions of confinement of pretrial detainees, such as the\nplaintiffs in this case, is Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). There, the Supreme\nCourt evaluated claims that certain confinement conditions (including double bunking, limitations on sources of\nreading material, restrictions on receipt of packages, unannounced room searches, and body cavity searches\nafter contact visits) imposed on pretrial detainees in a federal detention facility were unconstitutional. The Court\nconfirmed that \"[t]here is no iron curtain drawn between the Constitution and the prisons of this country,\" id. at\n545, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (quoting Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555-556, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)),\nand that \"pretrial detainees, who have not been convicted of any crimes, retain at least those constitutional rights\nthat we have held are enjoyed by convicted prisoners.\" Ibid. Constitutional rights concerning conditions of\nconfinement, analyzed for pretrial detainees under the Due Process Clause, id. at n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, however,\nmust be balanced against the \"Government['s] ... legitimate interests that stem from its need to manage the\nfacility in which the individual is detained.\" Id. at 540, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Therefore, courts must strike a balance\n\"between institutional needs and objectives and the provisions of the Constitution that are of general application.\"\nId. at 546, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (quoting Wolff, 418 U.S. at 556, 94 S.Ct. 2963). In striking that balance, courts must\ngive great deference to jail administrators \"in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their\n919 judgment are needed to preserve internal *919 order and discipline and to maintain institutional security,\" id. at\n547, 94 S.Ct. 2963, lest courts become \"enmeshed in the minutiae of prison operations.\" Id. at 562, 94 S.Ct.\n2963.\nThe Court in Wolfish set down some guiding principles to assist courts confronted with such challenges. First, for\ndetention conditions that implicate only a detainee's liberty interests, \"[a] court must decide whether the disability\nis imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other legitimate governmental\npurpose.\" Id. at 538, 99 S.Ct. 1861. \"[P]unitive measures ... may not constitutionally be imposed prior to a\ndetermination of guilt.\" Id. at 537, 99 S.Ct. 1861. If the measure does not constitute punishment and is\nreasonably related to a legitimate penological concern, then deference will be afforded jail officials unless there is\n\n\"substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these\nconsiderations.\" Id. at 548, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Next, where the condition implicates the detainee's privacy interest\nunder the Fourth Amendment, it will be upheld if it is reasonable, which assessment requires balancing the needs\nof the institution against the invasion of personal rights that results. Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Therefore, \"[c]ourts\nmust consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for\ninitiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Ibid.\nSubsequent decisions have expanded upon and refined the factors used to detect constitutional violations\nresulting from conditions of confinement. The Court set forth four factors in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107\nS.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987): \"First, there must be a `valid, rational connection' between the prison\nregulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it.... [T]he second factor... is whether\nthere are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates.... A third consideration is\nthe impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates, and on the\nallocation of prison resources generally.... Finally, the absence of ready alternatives is evidence of the\nreasonableness of a prison regulation.\" Id. at 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254. These factors operate as \"guidelines to be\nweighed in the evaluation of a regulation\" not prongs of a four-part test in which each prong must be met. \nWhitney v. Brown, 882 F.2d 1068, 1071 (6th Cir.1989). The guiding principle, however, is that \"when a prison\nregulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate\npenological interests.\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254.\nAs noted above, the question in this case does not focus on the reasonableness of placing uncooperative and\ndisruptive detainees in administrative segregation. Rather, the issue is whether the regulation requiring removal\nof all of the detainees' clothes violates the Constitution. Courts in this Circuit have recognized that prisoners have\na liberty and privacy interest in shielding their naked bodies from view by others, especially members of the\nopposite gender. For instance, in Cornwell v. Dahlberg, 963 F.2d 912 (6th Cir.1992), the court held that a prison\ninmate had a Fourth Amendment privacy interest that may have been violated when he was strip-searched in\nview of female prison guards and others after a prison uprising. In Kent v. Johnson, 821 F.2d 1220 (6th Cir.1987),\nthe court held that an inmate challenging a Michigan prison's regulation stated a Fourth Amendment claim in light\nof Turner's four factors where he \"alleged that the defendants-appellees' policy and practice of according female\n920 prison guards *920 full and unrestricted access to all areas of the housing unit at the prison allows the female\nguards to view him performing necessary bodily functions in his cell and to view his naked body in the shower\narea.\" Id. at 1222. The court observed that \"[p]erhaps it is merely an abundance of common experience that\nleads inexorably to the conclusion that there must be a fundamental constitutional right to be free from forced\nexposure of one's person to strangers of the opposite sex when not reasonably necessary for some legitimate,\noverriding reason, for the obverse would be repugnant to notions of human decency and personal integrity.\" Id. at\n1226. In Johnson v. City of Kalamazoo, 124 F.Supp.2d 1099 (W.D.Mich.2000), the district court held there was no\nFourth or Fourteenth Amendment violation resulting from the practice of placing detainees who refused to answer\nan inquiry as to whether they were suicidal in a cell clad only in their underwear. However, the same court found\nboth Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations under similar circumstances when the detainees were put in\ncells with no clothes at all. See Wilson v. City of Kalamazoo, 127 F.Supp.2d 855, 862 (W.D.Mich.2000) (observing\nthat \"the Court remains unpersuaded that society is not, as a matter of law, prepared to recognize as legitimate\nan inmate's subjective expectation that he may not be stripped of all clothing and covering, even for a short\nperiod of time, simply because he refuses to answer a question as to whether he is suicidal\"). Most recently, the\ncourt of appeals made the following observations concerning an inmate's privacy rights in Everson v. Michigan\nDept. of Corrections, 391 F.3d 737 (6th Cir.2004), in which the court held that gender was a bona fide\noccupational qualification for Michigan prison guards:\n\"Prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution.\" Turner,\n482 U.S. at 84, 107 S.Ct. 2254. \"Thus, while inmates may lose many of their freedoms at the prison gate, they\nretain `those rights [that are] not fundamentally inconsistent with imprisonment itself or incompatible with the\nobjectives of incarceration.'\" Covino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73, 77 (2d Cir.1992) (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468\nU.S. 517, 523, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984)). Our court has recognized that \"a convicted prisoner\nmaintains some reasonable expectations of privacy while in prison, particularly where those claims are related to\nforced exposure to strangers of the opposite sex, even though those privacy rights may be less than those\nenjoyed by non-prisoners.\" Cornwell v. Dahlberg, 963 F.2d 912, 916 (6th Cir.1992); see also Kent v. Johnson, 821\n\nF.2d 1220, 1227 (6th Cir.1987) (assuming that \"there is some vestige of the right to privacy retained by state\nprisoners and that this right protects them from being forced unnecessarily to expose their bodies to guards of the\nopposite sex\"). As one of our sister circuits has explained, most people \"have a special sense of privacy in their\ngenitals, and involuntary exposure of them in the presence of people of the other sex may be especially\ndemeaning and humiliating. When not reasonably necessary, that sort of degradation is not to be visited upon\nthose confined in our prisons.\" Lee v. Downs, 641 F.2d 1117, 1119 (4th Cir.1981); see also York v. Story, 324\nF.2d 450, 455 (9th Cir.1963) (\"We cannot conceive of a more basic subject of privacy than the naked body. The\ndesire to shield one's unclothed figure from view of strangers, and particularly strangers of the opposite sex, is\nimpelled by elementary self-respect and personal dignity.\").\nId. at 756-57.\n921 These well-established interests must be balanced against the defendants' asserted *921 penological interests in\nevaluating the claims under both the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\nTo assess a due process violation, the Court must accept the defendants' articulated purpose for the regulation\nand consider whether the regulation is an exaggerated response to the problem by applying the four factors\nidentified in Turner, that is, a valid, rational connection between the regulation and the County's asserted interest\nput forward to justify it; whether the plaintiffs had alternative means of exercising their rights 00 which in this case\n97\nis the right to privacy; the impact accommodation of their privacy right would have on the allocation of jail\nresources; and the existence of ready alternatives. See Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861; Turner, 482 U.S.\nat 89-90107 S.Ct. 2254. Under the Fourth Amendment, the Court determines whether the practice is reasonable\nby considering the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for\ninitiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. See Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861.\nThe main justification for removing the clothes of those detainees placed in administrative segregation is the\nprevention of suicide, although defendant Charles Brown, the county sheriff, gave additional reasons at his\ndeposition when he said that inmates \"can obviously stuff [their clothes] down their throat, they can obviously\nhang themselves, they urinate on their clothing and throw it at the deputies, defecate on it and throw it at the\ndeputies, which has been done many times, they could actually use the clothing to, if the guard got close enough,\nto wrap it around his neck.\" Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J., Ex. C, Dep. of Sheriff Brown at 62. The defendants also\nhave offered the reports of two expert witnesses who believe that \"placing a detainee for a limited duration under\nclose supervision, in the nude, in an administrative segregation cell, is a reasonable alternative legitimately\nrelated to detention objectives.\" Defs.' Mot. Summ. J., Ex. E, Expert Report of Darrell Ross at ¶ 11. See also\nDefs.' Mot. Summ. J., Ex. E, Expert Report of Peter Wilson at ¶ 1 (stating that \"[b]y removing their clothing, a\ngreater degree of protection was provided to the inmates\").\nThe Court finds, however, that confining such detainees with no clothing whatsoever is an exaggerated response\nto the articulated security and safety concerns of the defendants in light of the importance of the right described\nin this Circuit's precedents and the availability of reasonable alternatives. First, there is a rational connection\nbetween the interest of jail security and confining unruly prisoners in segregation, but that alone does not justify\nremoving all their clothes. One of the defendants' experts states that the practice amounts to \"behavior\nmodification,\" Defs.' Mot. Summ. J., Ex. E, Expert Report of Darrell Ross at ¶ 11, but that purpose suggests a\npunitive rationale that is not permissible under the Due Process Clause. The defendants also argue that\nobstreperous detainees could use their clothes to assault guards, but once the detainee is in the segregation cell,\nthat concern dissipates. Finally, the defendants offer suicide prevention as a rationale, but none of these plaintiffs\nwere screened for suicidal tendencies, and the intake papers indicate that they were not suicide risks. Moreover,\naccording to the defendants' expert, the \"operational system\" in place included both voice and visual \"officer\nmonitoring ... documenting security checks every 15 minutes, [and] monitoring by medical personnel.\" Ibid. There\nis no indication that these measures were in place in 1996 when an inmate committed suicide, and they appear\n922 to be quite adequate to ensure that a detainee is not using clothing to harm him-or herself. *922 Further, the\nSaginaw County jail has a \"suicide cell\" available for those prisoners who truly are suicide risks. The defendants'\nother expert noted that \"[r]emoving an inmates [sic] clothing is an extraordinary measure.\" Defs.' Mot. Summ. J.,\nEx. E, Expert Report of Peter Wilson at ¶ 5.\n\nSecond, the plaintiffs had no alternative means of exercising their right to privacy. Once their clothes were\nremoved, they were exposed to all who could view them in the segregation cell by video monitoring device or\nthrough the slot in the door. The record indicates that some of the plaintiffs were observed naked by members of\nthe opposite gender. They had no way to protect that \"special sense of privacy in their genitals\" or avoid the\n\"especially demeaning and humiliating\" experience and \"degradation\" resulting from the \"involuntary exposure of\nthem in the presence of people of the other sex.\" Lee, 641 F.2d at 1119.\nThird, the defendants argue that allowing the detainees in the segregation cells to maintain some vestige of their\nmodesty will result in substantially increased administrative costs. They contend that keeping disruptive and\nviolent detainees in cells with other detainees would impact guards and other detainees; other detainees would\nbe subject to the disruptive and violent conduct of one detainee; jail staff would be forced to focus their attention\non one detainee who is violating the security and orderly operation of the jail to the necessary detriment of other\ndetainees and to their other responsibilities; and posting one officer outside the segregation cell while one\ndetainee is housed in the cell with his or her clothing on would place a serious strain on the resources of the jail.\nMost of these arguments, however, address the practice of placing disruptive prisoners in isolation to begin with,\na practice not challenged here. The plaintiffs do not contend that they should not have been taken to an isolation\ncell or that they should have been able to act out in the observation cell with other inmates. Nor would the\npractice of providing some form of bodily covering require a guard to maintain a vigil outside the isolation cell\ndoor. Rather, video monitoring, that is in use in at least some parts of the jail, likely would suffice.\nThe alternatives to naked confinement include those discussed in the cases cited above, such as allowing\ndetainees to wear underwear, Johnson, 124 F.Supp.2d at 1104, 1106; providing paper suicide gowns, Wilson,\n127 F.Supp.2d at 858; and restricting access by jail personnel of the other gender, Kent v. Johnson, 821 F.2d at\n1222; Everson, 391 F.3d at 756. As mentioned above, the guards also could make use of the jail's suicide\nobservation cell. Given the magnitude of the right to privacy in one's own body described by the cases, these\nrather rudimentary alternatives demonstrate the unreasonableness of the defendants' regulation and a violation\nof the Due Process Clause.\nThe policy requiring confinement in the nude also is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The scope of\nthe intrusion is substantial. The manner in which clothes are removed depends on the degree of vehemence\nexhibited by the detainee, but at times will include the forced removal of clothes by guards of the other gender.\nThe justification for the extraordinary measure does not withstand scrutiny for reasons stated earlier. And the\nremoval of clothing at times occurred in view of other jail personnel. Although the record demonstrates that\nisolating many of these plaintiffs was justified as a legitimate security measure because of their outrageous\nconduct, the Court is persuaded that society recognizes as legitimate an inmate's subjective expectation that he\n923 or *923 she may not be required to forfeit all clothing and covering, even for a brief time, when he or she has\nbeen detained for relatively minor violations, there is no individualized suspicion of drug, weapon, contraband\npossession, and there is no indication that he or she is suicidal.\nThe Court finds, therefore, that the plaintiffs have shown that the defendants' policy of taking all the clothing from\ndetainees confined in administrative segregation violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the\nConstitution based on the undisputed facts. They are entitled to partial summary judgment on their Section 1983\nclaim against the County of Saginaw.\nC.\nSheriff Charles Brown and the unnamed officers also argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on the\nclaim filed against them in their individual capacities. Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense that protects\ngovernment actors performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages when their conduct does \"not\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" \nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The purpose of this defense is\nto strike a balance that \"accommodates the tension between permitting litigants to recover damages, which is\noften the only realistic avenue for vindication of constitutional guarantees, and the social costs of such suits,\nincluding the expenses of litigation, the diversion of official energy from pressing public issues, and the\n\ndeterrence of able citizens from acceptance of public office.\" Champion v. Outlook Nashville, Inc., 380 F.3d 893,\n900 (6th Cir.2004) (internal quotes and citation omitted).\nThe Supreme Court has held that a claim of qualified immunity must be examined in two stages, see Saucier v.\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001): \"[f]irst, a court must consider whether the\nfacts, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, `show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right,'\"\nand then \"the court must then decide `whether the right was clearly established.'\" Solomon v. Auburn Hills Police\nDept., 389 F.3d 167, 172 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201-02, 121 S.Ct. 2151). The Sixth Circuit\nhas expanded that inquiry into a three-step sequential analysis when the qualified immunity defense is raised in a\nsummary judgment motion brought after discovery has been conducted, as here. \"The first inquiry is whether the\nplaintiff has shown a violation of a constitutionally protected right; the second inquiry is whether that right was\nclearly established at the time such that a reasonable official would have understood that his behavior violated\nthat right; and the third inquiry is `whether the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts, and supported the allegations\nby sufficient evidence, to indicate that what the official allegedly did was objectively unreasonable in light of the\nclearly established rights.'\" Tucker v. City of Richmond, 388 F.3d 216, 220 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting Higgason v.\nStephens, 288 F.3d 868, 876 (6th Cir.2002)); Champion, 380 F.3d at 901 (citing Feathers v. Aey, 319 F.3d 843,\n848 (6th Cir.2003)).\nOnce the defense is raised, the plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating a violation of a constitutional right and\nshowing that the right was clearly established. Barrett v. Steubenville City Schools, 388 F.3d 967, 970 (6th\nCir.2004). Ordinarily, these questions can be answered by the court as a matter of law. See Dickerson v.\nMcClellan, 101 F.3d 1151, 1157 (6th Cir.1996).\n924 *924 The Court has determined that the plaintiffs have established a violation of constitutional rights. However,\nthe plaintiffs must also prove that the right was clearly established. The critical inquiry is \"whether it would be\nclear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation confronted.\" Solomon, 389 F.3d at 173\n(quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151) (internal quotations omitted). The plaintiff need not prove that\n\"the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,\" but rather \"in the light of pre-existing law the\nunlawfulness must be apparent.\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523\n(1987). In other words, \"[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would\nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right.\" Ibid.\nIn this case, the right to be free from unreasonable seizures is clearly established. But the qualified immunity\ndefense requires the Court to look beyond the right in the abstract. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that\n\"[i]t is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine ... will apply to the factual\nsituation the officer confronts.\" Saucier, 533 U.S. at 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151. Qualified immunity protects police\npersonnel who must operate along the \"hazy borders\" that divide acceptable from unreasonable conduct. Id. at\n206, 121 S.Ct. 2151.\nThe Court finds that the contours of the right to reasonable seizures pertaining to pretrial detainees was not\nsufficiently clear to impose liability on individual actors following the County's policy in effect during the period at\nissue in this case. Issues relating to strip and body cavity searches, viewing of naked inmates by guards of the\nother gender, and removal of clothing from unruly detainees have troubled courts over the past several years and\nhave not yielded a uniform set of decisions on the subject. For example, in Hill v. McKinley, 311 F.3d 899 (8th\nCir.2002), the court held that placing a violent female inmate in a padded cell without clothes was proper\n(although the defendant claimed it offered her a paper gown and she refused), but leaving her naked after she\nwas strapped to a restraining board violated the Fourth Amendment. The court in Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police\nDept., 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir.1989), held unconstitutional the practice of performing a body cavity search on a\nplaintiff arrested for grand theft; but the court held the same practice constitutional in Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d\n1084 (6th Cir.1983). At the time of the detentions in this case, there was no clear precedent that would have\nprovided guidance to the individual defendants, who were attempting to walk the line between protecting\ndetainees from harming themselves and violating their rights to personal privacy. That they transgressed that\n\"hazy border\" here will not forfeit their qualified immunity from suit.\n\nD.\nThe plaintiffs also have alleged state law claims against Sheriff Brown and other unnamed officers to which the\ndefendants claim absolute immunity under the state governmental immunity statutes. Michigan Compiled Laws\nSection 691.1407(5) states: \"A judge, a legislator, and the elective or highest appointive executive official of all\nlevels of government are immune from tort liability for injuries to persons or damages to property if he or she is\nacting within the scope of his or her judicial, legislative, or executive authority.\" That statute creates absolute\nimmunity from state tort claims for the highest elected official in local government. See Am. Transmissions, Inc. v.\n925 Attorney General, 454 Mich. 135, 139, 560 N.W.2d 50, 52 *925 (1997). Charles Brown, the elected sheriff of\nSaginaw County, falls within the ambit of Section 691.1407(5) and is therefore immune from the plaintiffs' claims\nunder state law.\nMichigan law also states that employees of a governmental unit are immune from state tort claims if \"(a) [t]he\nofficer, employee, member, or volunteer is acting or reasonably believes he or she is acting within the scope of\nhis or her authority; (b) [t]he governmental agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental\nfunction; [and] (c) [t]he officer's, employee's, member's, or volunteer's conduct does not amount to gross\nnegligence that is the proximate cause of the injury or damage.\" Mich. Comp. Laws § 691.1407(2). The plaintiffs\nhave named several \"John Doe\" defendants but they have not identified any of them. Nonetheless, there is no\nevidence that these individuals were acting other than in accordance with established policy and were not grossly\nnegligent. The individual officers, therefore, are immune from the state tort claims.\nE.\nIn count six of their sixth amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege a claim for gender discrimination under\nMichigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.2101 et seq., contending that Saginaw\nCounty's detention policy is applied differently to women than to men. The defendants argue in their motion for\nsummary judgment that there is no evidence in the record to support that claim.\nThe Michigan Civil Rights Act states:\nThe opportunity to obtain employment, housing and other real estate, and the full and equal utilization of public\naccommodations, public service, and educational facilities without discrimination because of religion, race, color,\nnational origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status as prohibited by this act, is recognized\nand declared to be a civil right.\nMich. Comp. Laws § 37.2102(1). The Michigan courts have held that this legislation applies to inmates in state\ncorrectional facilities. See Neal v. Dept. of Corr., 232 Mich.App. 730, 741, 592 N.W.2d 370, 376 (1998)\n(observing, however, that the department of corrections may \"treat prisoners differently on the basis of gender\nwithout violating subsection 302(a), as long as the gender-based treatment serves important penological interests\nand is substantially related to the achievement of those interests\"), aff'd by special panel sub nom Doe v. Dept. of\nCorr., 240 Mich.App. 199, 611 N.W.2d 1 (2000),remanded463 Mich. 982, 625 N.W.2d 750 (2001),aff'd249\nMich.App. 49, 641 N.W.2d 269 (2001). However, in 1999 the Michigan legislature amended the applicable statute\nto state:\n\"Public service\" means a public facility, department, agency, board, or commission, owned, operated, or\nmanaged by or on behalf of the state, a political subdivision, or an agency thereof or a tax exempt private agency\nestablished to provide service to the public, except that public service does not include a state or county\ncorrectional facility with respect to actions and decisions regarding an individual serving a sentence of\nimprisonment.\nMich. Comp. Laws § 37.2301(b) (emphasis added). The plaintiffs in this case were not serving \"a sentence of\nimprisonment.\" Nonetheless, there is a serious question as to whether the legislation applies to the plaintiffs'\nclaims.\n\nThe Court need not decide that question, however, because the defendants have alleged that the plaintiffs have\nnot come forward with any evidence of discriminatory treatment, and the plaintiffs have not responded to that\n926 argument. *926 Once the defendants have pointed out the deficiencies in the plaintiffs' case, it is incumbent upon\nthe plaintiffs to come forward with evidence establishing a material fact on the issue. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252,\n106 S.Ct. 2505. The Court is not obliged to \"comb through the record to ascertain whether a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact exists.\" Cacevic v. City of Hazel Park, 226 F.3d 483, 492 (6th Cir.2000) (citing Guarino v. Brookfield\nTwp. Trustees, 980 F.2d 399, 407, 410 (6th Cir.1992)). The plaintiffs have not met their burden on their state civil\nrights claim, and the defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\nIII.\nThe plaintiffs have recently filed three additional motions in this case: a motion to join additional parties as\nplaintiffs; a motion for an order to add a damage expert to its list of witnesses; and a motion for a preliminary\ninjunction. The defendants have filed answers in opposition to these motions. The Court has reviewed the parties'\nsubmissions and finds that the relevant law and facts have been set forth in the motion papers and that oral\nargument will not aid in the disposition of the motion. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the motions be decided on\nthe papers submitted. See E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(e)(2).\nA.\nThe plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint to add additional parties as plaintiffs was filed December 27, 2004.\nThey allege that in May 2003, a television report of this case resulted in contacts by other citizens to the plaintiffs'\nattorneys' offices, and the defendants subsequently identified one hundred other individuals who were subjected\nto the naked confinement policy. The plaintiffs identify eight additional individuals who wish to join this action, and\nthey cite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 as their authority to amend their complaint a seventh time for that\npurpose. The defendants respond that the request to add new plaintiffs comes long after the close of discovery,\nand that many of the prospective new plaintiffs will not be able to overcome the statute of limitations bar.\nUnder Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), a party may amend a complaint at this stage of the proceedings only after obtaining\nleave of court. Although the Rule provides that \"leave of court shall be freely granted when justice so requires,\"\nleave may be denied on the basis of undue delay, bad faith by the moving party, repeated failure to cure defects\nby previously-allowed amendments, futility of the proposed new claim, or undue prejudice to the opposite party. \nFoman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); Duggins v. Steak `N Shake, Inc., 195\nF.3d 828, 834 (6th Cir.1999); Fisher v. Roberts, 125 F.3d 974, 977 (6th Cir.1997).\nThe request to amend here comes too late. The parties have engaged in extensive discovery, including deposing\neach of the available plaintiffs, and they have litigated summary judgment motions. Adding new parties as\nplaintiffs would serve to further complicate the litigation. Moreover, if the prospective new plaintiffs cannot\nwithstand a statute of limitations defense, allowance of the amendment would be futile. Finally, there is no reason\nthat these new claimants cannot file a separate action of their own. The Court, therefore, will deny the motion to\nadd new parties as plaintiffs.\nB.\nThe plaintiffs' motion to add a damage expert to its list of witnesses effectively requires an amendment to the\nCase Management and Scheduling Order. The Court initially entered a scheduling order following the initial\n927 conference held pursuant *927 to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16. The parties thereafter suspended their\ndiscovery activity and engaged in efforts to reach a settlement of the several claims. After the parties failed\nsettlement efforts, the Court entered an amended scheduling order on January 28, 2003 that required the\nplaintiffs to file expert disclosures under Rule 26(a)(2) by February 20, 2003. The plaintiffs named three experts\nwho were deposed by the defendants in June 2003. This request to add a new expert witness was filed on\nDecember 22, 2004. They cite no federal authority in support of their request.\n\nThe Amended Case Management and Scheduling Order in this case was entered pursuant to Rule 16(b) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires the court to \"enter a scheduling order that limits the time ... to\nfile motions[ ] and ... to complete discovery.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(2), (3). Once entered, \"[a] schedule shall not be\nmodified except upon a showing of good cause and by leave of the district judge.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b); see also \nLeary v. Daeschner, 349 F.3d 888, 906 (6th Cir.2003). Moreover, a court may change a schedule \"only `if it\ncannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.'\" Ibid. (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P.\n16, 1983 advisory committee's notes). Stated another way, \"the primary measure of Rule 16's `good cause'\nstandard is the moving party's diligence in attempting to meet the case management order's requirements.\" Inge\nv. Rock Fin. Corp., 281 F.3d 613, 625 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting Bradford v. DANA Corp., 249 F.3d 807, 809 (8th\nCir.2001); see also Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 340 (2d Cir.2000) (joining the Eighth, Ninth,\nand Eleventh Circuits)), cited in Leary, 349 F.3d at 906.\nThe plaintiffs have offered no reason in support of their request from which the Court could find good cause.\nThere is no suggestion that the information recently became known to the plaintiffs or that their other experts are\nnot up to the task. The disclosure and discovery periods have closed some time ago. There is no evidence that\nthe plaintiffs could not meet the deadlines despite their exercise of diligence. The motion, therefore, will be\ndenied.\nC.\nFinally, the plaintiffs have asked the Court to issue a preliminary injunction to prohibit the defendants from\nenforcing their policy of removing all clothes from detainees placed in administrative segregation. Although the\nplaintiffs seek permanent injunctive relief in their sixth amended complaint, they have not asked for a preliminary\ninjunction until this motion was filed on December 22, 2004. The plaintiffs have offered no facts or affidavits to\nsupport their claim, but they contend that plaintiffs' counsel has heard a report that the practice continues. They\ncite no authority in support of their request.\nThe grant of a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy. Leary v. Daeschner, 228 F.3d 729, 739 (6th\nCir.2000). When a party seeks injunctive relief, the Court should consider the following four factors: (1) the\nlikelihood of the party's success on the merits of the claim; (2) whether the injunction will save the party from\nirreparable injury; (3) the probability that granting the injunction will substantially harm others; and (4) whether the\npublic interest will be served by the injunction. See Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc. v. Gentile\nProds., 134 F.3d 749, 753 (6th Cir.1998),Six Clinics Holding Corp. v. Cafcomp Sys., Inc., 119 F.3d 393, 399 (6th\nCir.1997); Frisch's Rest., Inc. v. Shoney's, Inc., 759 F.2d 1261, 1263 (6th Cir.1985). The district court must make\n928 specific findings regarding *928 each of the four factors, unless fewer factors are dispositive of the issue. See Six\nClinics Holding Corp., 119 F.3d at 399.\nIn this case, the plaintiffs' request must fail because they have not demonstrated that a preliminary injunction will\nsave them from irreparable harm. Although the Court determines today that the defendants' policy is\nunconstitutional, none of the plaintiffs are confined any longer, and there is no evidence that any of them\nanticipate engaging in conduct that would subject them to arrest in Saginaw County. Because there is virtually no\nprospect on this record of the plaintiffs being subjected to placement in administrative segregation in the Saginaw\nCounty jail, they cannot, and do not, claim with any credibility that they are in danger of suffering irreparable harm\neven if the policy continues to be enforced. Moreover, the defendants have asserted that they no longer confine\ndetainees in administrative segregation without offering them paper \"suicide\" gowns, and except for the rumor\nmentioned by the plaintiffs in their motion, which has no factual support, there is nothing to contradict the\ndefendants' assertions. The motion for a preliminary injunction, therefore, will be denied.\nIV.\nThe Court finds that there are no material facts in dispute with respect to the official policy and practice of\nconfining Saginaw County jail detainees in administrative segregation without clothing or covering of any kind.\nThe Court determines that this policy is unconstitutional, and the municipality is liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nThe individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for the federal claims and governmental immunity for\nthe state law claims. The plaintiffs have not come forward with evidence to establish a material fact issue on their\nclaims under the state civil rights act. The plaintiffs have not demonstrated a right to relief on any of their recently\nfiled motions.\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment [dkt # 90] is GRANTED IN PART\nand DENIED IN PART.\nIt is further ORDERED that the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings or for summary judgment [dkt #\n113] is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.\nIt is further ORDERED that the plaintiffs' sixth amended complaint is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE with\nrespect to defendants Charles Brown and all other individual defendants.\nIt is further ORDERED that Counts two through six of the plaintiffs' sixth amended complaint are DISMISSED\nWITH PREJUDICE in their entirety.\nIt is further ORDERED that the plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint to add additional parties as plaintiffs\n[dkt # 151] is DENIED.\nIt is further ORDERED that the plaintiffs' motion for an order to add an expert witness [dkt # 153] is DENIED.\nIt is further ORDERED that the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction [dkt # 155] is DENIED.\nIt is further ORDERED that counsel for the parties appear before the Court for a status conference on February\n24, 2005 at 3:30 p.m. to discuss a schedule for resolution of the remaining issues in this case.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Honorable David M. Lawson\nSAGINAW COUNTY,\nDefendant.\n______________________________________ /\nORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR INTEREST\nThe matter is before the Court on the plaintiffs’ motion for interest.  After a jury verdict, the\nCourt entered judgment for the plaintiffs on March 20, 2008.  The plaintiffs’ motion for interest was\nfiled on May 5, 2008.  The Court has reviewed the parties’ submissions and heard oral argument in\nopen court  on June 18, 2008.  At the conclusion ofo ral argument, the Court announced its decision\nfrom the bench and granted the plaintiffs’ motion.  The Court finds that the plaintiffs are entitled to\nprejudgment interest, to be calculated in a manner derived from 28 U.S.C. § 1961.  The interest shall\nbegin to accrue from the filing of the earliest complaint that brought the relevant plaintiff into the\ncase.  For each year after the complaint, the interest rate to be used is the weekly average of the\n1-year constant maturity Treasury yield during that year.  The rate should be computed daily and\ncompounded annually.  The Court further finds that  the plaintiffs are entitled to post-judgm ent\ninterest to be calculated as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1961(a).\nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that plaintiffs’ motion for interest [dkt. #264] isG  RANTED\n\n2:01-cv-10337-DML   Doc # 269    Filed 06/19/08   Pg 2 of 2    Pg ID 1691\nfor the reasons stated on the record.\ns/David M.
