Plaintiff alleged that the jail's blanket policy of strip searching all arrestees regardless of whether there existed any reasonable suspicion that the arrestee was in possession of contraband or weapons violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and class certification.  The Hampshire County Sheriff answered Plaintiff's complaint by generally denying the allegations.</p><p>On July 14, 2006, the District Court (Judge Michael A. Ponsor) certified the case as a class action.  Shortly thereafter, settlement negotiations resulted in a resolution of the case.  After a June 22, 2007 fairness hearing, the Court approved the class action settlement.  Under the settlement, the County agreed to pay up to $205,000 to settle the class claims.  Of that amount, Howard Friedman, the lawyer that brought the suit, was to receive attorney fees of 33%.  It was estimated that the class included some 90 people, each of which would be eligible to receive compensation of at least $1,500.  The settlement also provided that named plaintiff, Charles V. Ryan IV, would receive $10,000.</p><p>At the time of this summary, the claims administration process was still ongoing.</p><p></p>",

Visit www.HampshireSheriffClassAction.com.\n\nBASIC INFORMATION\nWhat is this case about?\nPlaintiff Charles V. Ryan IV claimed that it was illegal for the Hampshire Sheriff to routinely strip search people when \nthey were admitted into the Hampshire County Jail. He brought this case on behalf of himself and others similarly situated \nseeking money damages for every person who was strip searched.\nAre all strip searches in a jail illegal?\nThere are times when jail ofﬁ cers can legally strip search a prisoner. This case does not claim that all strip searches at the \nJail were illegal. Plaintiffs claim that the intake searches of people who were held before a ﬁ rst court appearance and those \nwho were held after a ﬁ nding of civil contempt by a court were illegal. This case does not concern strip searches for cause,\nafter contact visits, or on return from work release or court. The case does not challenge any strip searches of convicted \nprisoners.\nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS\n– WHAT YOU GET AND HOW TO GET IT –\nHow much will my payment be?\nWe do not know the amount of the payments yet. The defendants agreed to pay $205,000 to settle this lawsuit. If you are\neligible, you will get a payment for only one strip search. The amount will depend on how many people submit claim \nforms.\nThe amount per person will decrease as the number of forms submitted increases. We estimate that each participating class\nmember will receive $1,500 or more.\nThe settlement money will be distributed after payment of attorneys’ fees, expenses and an incentive payment. The attorneys \nwho represented the plaintiffs, also called class counsel, will request an attorney’s fee of no more than 33% of the settlement \nfund. Class counsel requests payment of an incentive payment to the class representative Charles V. Ryan IV who brought \nthis case on behalf of all class members in order to compensate him for the time he spent helping to bring about this \nsettlement and for his loss of privacy. The requested incentive payment is $10,000.\nHow can I get a payment?\nYou must ﬁ ll out the Settlement Claim Form completely and mail it to the Claims Administrator. A Claim Form is included \nwith this notice. You can also obtain a Claim Form from www.HampshireSheriffClassAction.com. The envelope must be \npostmarked no later than June 22, 2007; if it is not, your claim will be denied.\nThe settlement check will be written in your name with your social security number. Your check will be sent to your mailing \naddress. If you move, you must notify the Claims Administrator in writing of your new address or the check will be sent to \nyour old address.\nWhen will I get my payment?\nYou cannot be paid until the settlement is approved by the Court and any appeals are over. The Court will hold a hearing on \nJune 22, 2007 to decide whether to approve the settlement. Settlement checks will be issued after the Court approves the \nsettlement and all appeals are completed. You may visit the website or contact the Claims Administrator for updates.\nIf I owe past child support or tax obligations, will I have to pay them?\nYes. Any amounts for outstanding child support obligations and IRS/DOR tax liens may be deducted from your share of the \nsettlement before a payment is made to you.\nQuestions? Visit www.HampshireSheriffClassAction.com.\n\nWill I have to pay taxes on my payment?\nYou may have to pay taxes on your payment. You should consult your tax preparer when you ﬁ le your tax returns. The \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts will send you a 1099 Form. (If you have questions about backup withholding, Form W-9 \nor Form 1099, call your tax preparer or the IRS Information Reporting Program Customer Service Section, toll free at (866) \n455-7438, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.)\nWhat claims will be released by this Settlement?\nThis settlement resolves all claims for illegal strip searches. This means that people who could have been a part of this \nlawsuit cannot ever again sue Hampshire Sheriff Robert J. Garvey or Superintendent Patrick J. Cahillane over the issue of \nillegal strip searches, unless you chose to opt-out of this lawsuit.\nWHO IS IN THE SETTLEMENT\nWhat is a Class Action and who are Class Members?\nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case, Charles V. Ryan IV), sue on behalf of all \npeople who have similar claims. All of the people who were similarly treated are known as a Class or Class Members. One \ncourt resolves the issues for all Class Members.\nHow do I know if I am a Class Member and part of the settlement?\nThe Court has ruled that you are a Class Member if you meet all four factors below:\n1.  You were held at the Hampshire County Jail at any time between January 18, 2002 and November 7, 2002.\n2.  You were held at Hampshire County Jail after an arrest but before a bail hearing or ﬁ rst court appearance (this includes \narrests on default and other warrants) or after a ﬁ nding of civil contempt of court for failure to pay a judgment, a ﬁ ne, \nor child or spousal support.\n3.  You were not charged with a crime involving drugs or weapons or a violent felony.\n4.  You were strip searched on admission into the Jail.\nNOTE: You are not a class member if you were either (1) strip searched while you were serving a sentence or being held \nfor trial, (2) you were strip searched because a correctional ofﬁ cer had an individualized reason to think that you were in \npossession of contraband, drugs or weapons, or (3) you were arrested for and/or charged with a crime involving drugs, \nweapons or a violent felony.\nWhat crimes are considered to be violent felonies?\nThe following crimes are examples of violent felonies: arson, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, assault with \nintent to rob or murder, extortion by threat of injury, home invasion, indecent assault and battery, intimidation of witness, \nkidnaping, manslaughter, mayhem, murder, rape, and robbery. This is not a complete list; other felony level crimes may be \ndetermined to be “violent”.\nWhat if I was arrested for more than one crime?\nThe most serious charge for an arrest will determine your class membership. If any one of the charges was a crime involving \nweapons or drugs or was a violent felony, you are not a class member for that arrest. You might be eligible for another arrest \nthat took place on a different date.\nQuestions? Visit www.HampshireSheriffClassAction.com.\n\nWhat if I was found not guilty of the crime for which I was arrested?\nYou are entitled to the same settlement amount whether you were found guilty or not guilty of the crime.\nWhat if I was arrested on a default warrant for violation of probation or parole?\nYou are a class member if you were arrested on a default warrant or for violating the terms of probation or parole so long \nas the crime for which you were on probation or which you were arrested did not involve weapons, or drugs, or a violent \nfelony.\nI was not arrested. I was held on a ﬁ nding of civil contempt. Am I a Class Member?\nYes, if you also meet all of the other requirements.\nWhat if I was strip searched more than once at the Jail. Can I still participate?\nYes. If you were arrested and brought to the Jail more than once during the class period you are a member of the class and\ncan recover money. You can only recover one payment, however, and will not be provided with extra payments for being \nstrip searched at the jail more than one time.\nWhat if I was at the Jail before January 18, 2002 or after November 7, 2002?\nThe time period for being a class member is based on the legal requirement that a case must be ﬁ led within a certain time\nperiod; this is called the statute of limitations. The law in Massachusetts only allows a person to bring a claim within three\nyears after his or her rights were violated. Because this case was ﬁ led by Charles V. Ryan IV on January 18, 2005, class \nmembers include anyone strip searched in the three years before that date. If you were strip searched before January 18, \n2002, it may be too late to bring a lawsuit. The time period for the class ends on November 7, 2002, the date when Hampshire \nCounty changed its written search policy. If you were strip searched after this date, that search is not a part of this lawsuit; \nyou must ﬁ le your own lawsuit.\nWhat if I am still unsure about whether I am part of the Settlement?\nIf you are still unsure as to whether you are a member of the class, you may ﬁ ll out and return the Settlement Claim Form.\nIf the settlement is approved, you will be notiﬁ ed if you do not qualify. If you qualify, you will receive a check. You may also \nvisit the settlement website on the Internet at www.HampshireSheriffClassAction.com to answer your questions.\nWhat if I am currently incarcerated? Where will you send my payment to?\nThe Claims Administrator will send your payment to the address you indicate on your claim form, including jails and \nprisons.  However, we recommend that you provide an outside address if possible.\nWho makes the ﬁ nal decision about who qualiﬁ es as a Class Member?\nThe Class Administrator makes the ﬁ nal decision about who qualiﬁ es as a Class Member and the Judge will review that \ndecision. The computerized booking records kept by the Hampshire County Jail will determine if you are a class member. \nYou can help by listing the date or dates when you feel you met the class deﬁ nition. If the records do not show that you \nﬁ t the class deﬁ nition, your claim will be denied. You can appeal your denial to the Claims Administrator by sending \ndocumentation and information regarding the dates you believe you were held and strip searched. A decision of the Claims \nAdministrator can be appealed to the judge. (If you are not a class member, you are not bound by this settlement. You can \ntake action as an individual if you wish.)\nQuestions? Visit www.HampshireSheriffClassAction.com.\n\nHow did the lawyers in this case ﬁ nd me and how can I protect my privacy?\nOn admission into the Jail, you gave your name and address during booking. This information was given to the lawyers for \nthe plaintiffs by Hampshire County. The lawyers for the plaintiffs will do everything they can to protect your privacy. Only \nthe lawyers in the case and the court-appointed Claims Administrator will know your name and, in most cases, only the \nClaims Administrator will see your Claim Form.\nWhat should I do if I do not want to participate in the Class Action?\nIf you do not wish to participate in the class action, you can either exclude yourself or do nothing. If you do not send in a \nclaim form, you will not be a participating Class Member and you will not receive a payment. You will also be barred from \nﬁ ling a case on these claims in the future.\nEXCLUDING YOURSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT\nIf I exclude myself, can I get money from this settlement?\nNo, you will not get a payment from this settlement. You will not be legally bound by the settlement. You can bring your \nown lawsuit. Class counsel will not represent you in pursuing your claims. If you exclude yourself, do not send in a Claim \nForm. Because you will no longer be part of the case, you cannot object to the settlement if you ask to be excluded. A request \nto be excluded means you have opted out of this case.\nHow do I get out of this settlement?\nTo exclude yourself from the settlement, you must send a letter by mail saying that you want to be excluded from Ryan v.\nGarvey, et al. Be sure to include your name, address, telephone number and sign the letter. You must mail your exclusion \nrequest postmarked no later than May 25, 2007, to the Claims Administrator at Ryan Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 2004, \nChanhassen, MN 55317-2004. The Claims Administrator will ﬁ le your notice with the court and counsel. You cannot \nexclude yourself by phone or by e-mail.\nIf I do not exclude myself, can I sue the Hampshire County Sheriff for the same thing later?\nNo. Unless you exclude yourself, you give up the right to sue the Hampshire County Sheriff or his employees for the claims \nthat this settlement resolves. Remember, the exclusion deadline is May 25, 2007.\nOBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT\nWhat if I think the proposed settlement is not fair? What can I do?\nIf you wish to object to the proposed settlement, you or a lawyer on your behalf must either state your objections to the \nCourt in a letter sent to the Claims Administrator, received no later than May 25, 2007, or appear in the U.S. District Court \nof Massachusetts, 1550 Main Street, Springﬁ eld, MA on June 22, 2007 to present your objections. If you write, the Claims\nAdministrator will forward your objection to the Court and to the lawyers.\nYou may object to the proposed settlement and still be eligible to receive a payment. You must submit a valid Settlement \nClaim Form by the June 22, 2007 deadline even if you object to the settlement, if you wish to claim money should the \nsettlement be approved.\nQuestions? Visit www.HampshireSheriffClassAction.com.\n\nTHE COURT’S FAIRNESS HEARING\nWhat is a Fairness Hearing?\nThe Court will hold a hearing to decide whether to approve the settlement. The Court will consider whether the settlement \nis fair, reasonable and adequate. The Court will also decide whether to approve the request for attorney’s fees, costs, \nexpenses and the bonuses to class representatives and class members who were deposed. If the Court approves the proposed \nsettlement, it will affect all class members.\nWhen and where is the hearing?\nThe Hearing will be at 2:00 p.m. on Friday, June 22, 2007 in Courtroom 1 at the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, 1550 \nMain Street, Springﬁ eld, MA.\nDo I have to come to the hearing? May I or my lawyer speak at the hearing?\nNo, you are not required to attend the hearing. Class counsel will answer any questions the Court may have. You are \nwelcome to come at your own expense. If you object to the settlement and you want to explain the objection to the Court, \nyou can attend the hearing or hire your own lawyer to attend for you.\nTHE LAWYERS IN THIS CASE\nWho are the lawyers in this case?\nThe lawyers for the Plaintiff Charles V. Ryan IV and the class are Howard Friedman and Myong J. Joun, Law Ofﬁ ces of\nHoward Friedman P.C., 90 Canal Street, 5th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02114.\nDefendants Hampshire Sheriff Robert J.

      "text": " \n \n \n \nHampshire County jail to pay people strip-searched at \nfacility \n \nJanuary 11, 2007 \n \nNORTHAMPTON, Mass. --Nearly 100 people who were illegally strip-searched on arrival at the \nHampshire County jail will be eligible for payments of at least $1,500 each under the settlement of \na class-action lawsuit. \n \nThose eligible for payments were strip-searched at the jail after being arrested between Jan. 18, \n2002 and Nov. 7, 2002, for crimes that did not involve drugs, weapons or violent felonies, the \nDaily Hampshire Gazette reported, quoting the plaintiffs' lawyer. \n \nCharles V. Ryan IV, a Worthington lawyer who brought the lawsuit, will receive at least $10,000 of \nthe  $205,000  settlement  that  received  preliminary  approval  from  U.S.  District  Court  Judge \nMichael A. Ponsor. The deal was disclosed on Tuesday, the newspaper reported. \n \nFinal approval will likely be in June. Class action members must submint a claim form by June 22 \nto receive a share of the compensation, the newspaper reported. \n \nRyan, 52, was arrested during a Martin Luther King weekend in 2002 on a charge of violating a \nrestraining order obtained by his now-ex-wife. He was brought to the jail, strip-searched and held \nfor four nights until court opened on Tuesday. The case was eventually dismissed. \n \n\"It was probably the worst experience of my life. My father, the mayor of Springfield, came to see \nme in jail. I had to be strip-searched after I met him, which is apparently legal,\" Ryan told The \nRepublican newspaper of Springfield. \n \nIn January 2005 he filed a lawsuit alleging unconstitutional strip searches at the Hampshire Jail \nand House of Corrections. The lawsuit was filed against the Hampshire Sheriff Robert Garvey \nand Patrick J. Callihane, the Deputy Superintendent responsible for operation of the facility. \n \nThe jail policy was changed when the Hampshire County lockup, which only holds people who \nwere arrested and not yet arraigned, was opened in November 2002. Prior to its opening, those \nwho were arrested were held with the rest of the jail population. \n \nAuthorities now \"don't strip-search people prior to appearance in court unless there is significant \nprobability they have something that could hurt themselves or others,\" Garvey told the Daily \nHampshire Gazette on Wednesday. \n \n \n ",

INTRODUCTION\nThe parties have reached a settlement whereby the defendants will maintain a policy\nprotecting the privacy of pre-trial detainees at the Hampshire County Jail and will pay $205,000 to\nan estimated class of 90 people to resolve all of the plaintiffs’ claims.1 The settlement is the product\nof intensive negotiations during the months from June through December 2006. Counsel for the\nparties believe that the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate, and should be approved by the\nCourt.2 Plaintiffs request that this Court grant the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of the\nsettlement, approve the notice forms and the notice plan, appoint Analytics, Inc. as the claims\nadministrator, set a date for the final fairness hearing and a date for filing motions to approve the\nsettlement and for attorney’s fees and costs.\n1 The defendants’ consent to this motion does not encompass an endorsement of all statements in the\nincorporated supporting memorandum, but the defendants do join fully with plaintiffs in requesting that the Court\napprove the written settlement agreement of the parties attached as Exhibit 1 and the other relief requested in the motion.\n2 Ex. 2 at ¶22 (Affidavit of Howard Friedman).\n\nCase 3:05-cv-30017-MAP     Document 33-1     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 2 of 14(cid:10)\nII.  CASE BACKGROUND\nPlaintiff Charles V. Ryan IV alleged that the Hampshire Jail and House of Correction\nunconstitutionally required every person who was admitted into the jail to be strip searched without\nindividualized suspicion. On July 14, 2006, the Court certified this case as a class action under\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). The class was defined as follows: \nAll persons who were illegally strip searched at the Hampshire Jail and\nHouse of Correction from January 18, 2002 to November 7, 2002, under a\npolicy of conducting strip searches without evaluating for individualized\nreasonable suspicion: \n(1)  while waiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after\nbeing arrested on charges that did not involve a weapon or drugs or\ncontraband or a violent felony; or \n(2)  while waiting for a first court appearance after being arrested on a\ndefault or other warrant (for example, those issued by the State Parole\nBoard)  on  charges  that  did  not  involve  a  weapon  or  drugs  or\ncontraband or a violent felony; or \n(3)  while held after a finding of civil contempt of court for failure to pay\nchild or spousal support, a judgment, or a fine.\nThe parties began negotiating a settlement in June 2006. After the Court certified the case\nas a class action, and the parties agreed that the class consisted of approximately 90 people, plaintiffs\nmade a detailed settlement proposal on August 2, 2006. The parties, through counsel, signed the\nSettlement Agreement, attached to this motion as Exhibit 1, on December 27, 2006.\nIII.  SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT\nThe Defendants have agreed to pay $205,000 to settle all claims brought by the plaintiff in\nthis action, including attorney’s fees and costs. The agreement provides for a cash payment to every\nperson who meets the class definition. The parties estimate that there are approximately 90 class\nmembers. Only one payment will be made no matter how many times a person was admitted into the\n2\n\nCase 3:05-cv-30017-MAP     Document 33-1     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 3 of 14(cid:10)\njail during the class period and strip searched. Class counsel recommends an incentive payment of\n$10,000 to the named plaintiff Charles V. Ryan IV to compensate him for his loss of privacy as a\nresult of bringing this case and for the time he spent in responding to discovery and working with\ncounsel to bring about the favorable result for the class. While the parties have no agreement with\nregard to attorney’s fees, counsel will request that the Court award a fee of 33.3% of the gross\nsettlement amount. Fees and expenses, including the cost of administering the settlement, will be\ndeducted from the settlement amount before calculating the distribution amounts to class members.\nIV.  THE COURT SHOULD PRELIMINARILY APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT AND\nNOTICE PLAN AND SET A DATE FOR A FAIRNESS HEARING\nIn deciding whether to approve a proposed settlement of a class action, the Court must hold\na hearing and determine if the settlement is “fair, reasonable and adequate.”3 Before the final fairness\nhearing, this Court should conduct a review of the settlement and make a “preliminary determination\nof the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the settlement terms.”4 This Court should be satisfied\nthat the settlement is in the range of possible approval before the settlement proceeds. \nAt this stage, the Court should also review the proposed notices, attached to the Settlement\nAgreement as Exhibits A, C and D, before permitting counsel to send notice to potential class\nmembers. This provisional approval is subject to a more searching inquiry at the fairness hearing.\nA.  Benefit to Class Members\nClass members who submit a qualifying claim form will receive a check. The proposed claim\nform is attached to the Settlement Agreement as Exhibit B. The precise amount will depend on the\ntotal number of claims submitted. It is difficult to predict the participation rate in this case because\n3 Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(e); See Durrett v. Housing Authority of Providence, 896 F.2d 600, 604 (1st Cir. 1990). \n4 Fed. R.Civ.P. 23 Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth, (Federal Judicial Center 2004) §21.632.\n3\n\nCase 3:05-cv-30017-MAP     Document 33-1     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 4 of 14(cid:10)\nof the very small size of the class. However, it is clear that each class member would receive a\nsignificant amount.5 If 30% of the potential class of 90 members were to submit claim forms,\npayments would be $3,666. Should 50% of the potential class members submit claims, each would\nreceive $2,444.\nBy any measure, this is more than a token recovery. Participating class members will receive\na significant cash payment for filling out a short form, affixing a $.39 cent stamp to an envelope and\nmailing it to the claims administrator. These class members will obtain money without having to find\nand hire their own lawyers, pay litigation expenses, endure the anxiety of litigation, respond to\ninterrogatories or requests for documents, testify at depositions, and prepare for trials. Instead of\ngiving up their privacy by filing suit, they will benefit from the anonymity provided by their\nmembership in the class.\nB.  Courts Favor Settlements Particularly in Class Actions\nCourts consistently favor the settlement of disputed claims.6 In the class action context, “there\nis an overriding public interest in favor of settlement.”7 Settlement of this class action will prevent\nsubstantial litigation expenses, delayed payment to the plaintiffs and the strain on court resources\nthat would result from nearly a hundred individual damages trials.8 Furthermore, settlement will\nincrease the number of class members who are able to participate in this case, class members whose\nrights would otherwise not be vindicated. \n5 Support for this statement and the rest of this paragraph is found in Ex. 2 at ¶27 (Affidavit of Howard\nFriedman).\n6 See Durrett, 896 F.2d at 604. \n7 Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1331 (5th Cir. 1977). \n8 Id. at 1331. \n4\n\nCase 3:05-cv-30017-MAP     Document 33-1     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 5 of 14(cid:10)\nBy reaching a compromise, both sides avoid the risks they faced by proceeding to trial. If\ndamages claims were decided individually, some class members may have received only one dollar.9\nOf course, the defendant also faced the risk that many plaintiffs would obtain larger damages awards\nranging from $5,000 to $40,000, and that some might recover more than $40,000.10 The wide range\nof verdicts in strip search cases shows that, absent a settlement, both the plaintiffs and the defendants\nfaced significant uncertainty. \nEven if plaintiffs were able to win large verdicts, collecting the amounts from the defendants\nwould have presented additional problems. First, the defendants would have been likely to appeal,\nfurther delaying payment. Then, plaintiffs would have had to pursue collection against the individual\ndefendants who may not have had the means to pay, again delaying payment. The defendants also\nhad compelling reasons to settle. They could have lost the trial on liability based on their admitted\npolicy of requiring strip searching class members without individualized suspicion. The defendants\nwould then have been facing close to a hundred damages trials. Even if the damages in individual\ncases were not large, the defendants would be liable for reasonable attorney’s fees to the plaintiffs\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. The costs of pursuing this litigation could have been large. Thus, both\nsides had good reasons to settle. \n9 Nominal damage verdicts have been awarded in individual strip search cases. See Foote v. Spiegel, 118 F.3d\n1416 (10th Cir. 2001) (after two appeals, plaintiff awarded $1 for an admittedly illegal strip search); Stewart v. Lubbock\nCounty 767 F.2d 153, 154, n.2. (5th Cir. 1985)(one plaintiff awarded $1 and the other awarded $15,000); Sorenson v.\nCity of New York, 2000 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 15090 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)(two plaintiffs awarded $1each); Polk v. Montgomery\nCounty, 689 F.Supp. 556 (D. Md. 1988) (plaintiff awarded $1after rejecting a settlement offer of $31,000).\n10 Verdicts in Massachusetts courts for women alleging an illegal strip search have ranged from $45,000 to\n$177,000. Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556 (lst Cir. 1985)(award of $177,040); Denkv. Santos, 98-11963-NG (jury\naward of $135,000); Rodriguez v. Silva and City of New Bedford, June 17,1996, (award of $45,000 for plaintiff who\nwas deceased at time of trial and $150,000 for another); Adams v. Town of Wareham, 94-11446-DPW (award of\n$50,000). In Joan W. v. City of Chicago, 771 F.2d 1020 (7th Cir. 1985), the Seventh Circuit addressed the question\nwhether a verdict of $112,000 was excessive. In ordering that the case be remanded for a new trial unless the plaintiff\naccepted a reduction of the award to $75,000, the Court looked to verdicts in nine other strip search suits against the City\nof Chicago in which the juries returned awards of $3,300, $15,000, $15,000, $25,000, $25,000, $30,000, $45,000,\n$50,000 (reduced as excessive to $25,000), and $60,000. See id. at 1023–24. \n5\n\nCase 3:05-cv-30017-MAP     Document 33-1     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 6 of 14(cid:10)\nC.  Procedural Considerations Support Approval of the Settlement\n“When sufficient discovery has been provided and the parties have bargained at arms-length,\nthere is a presumption in favor of the settlement.”11 In assessing a proposed settlement, a court is\nentitled to rely upon the views of experienced trial counsel.12\n  1.  Stage of proceedings and discovery\n“The stage of the proceedings at which settlement is reached is important because it indicates\nhow fully the district court and counsel are able to evaluate the merits of plaintiffs’ claims.”13\nThe defendants admitted that the County had a written policy requiring strip searches of class\nmembers without individualized suspicion. Therefore, counsel for the parties recognized very early\nin the case that the critical issue would be the size of the class.14 Plaintiff served a set of\ninterrogatories and requests for documents in June 2005. In response, defendants produced multiple\nsets of electronic booking information relating to more than 900 bookings. The data was analyzed\nto determine the size and composition of the class. Because the Jail did not record in its booking\ncomputer system why or how a prisoner was brought to the Jail, a determination whether the\nindividuals were pre-arraignment or pretrial detainees could not be made from examining the\nbooking data alone. Class counsel visited the Jail to personally review 266 inmate booking files to\ndetermine class membership. It took a full year to determine class size. A class had been certified.\nThe parties entered settlement negotiations with a full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses\nof their positions on liability and potential damage awards.\n11 City Partnership Co. v. Atlantic Acquisition Ltd. Partnership, 100 F.3d 1041, 1043 (1st Cir. 1996). \n12 See Cotton, 559 F.2d at 1330.\n13 Duhaime, 177 F.R.D. at 67 (quoting Armstrong v. Bd. of School Directors of Milwaukee, 616 F.2d 305, 325\n(7th Cir. 1980)). \n14 Ex. 2 at ¶23 (Affidavit of Howard Friedman).\n6\n\nCase 3:05-cv-30017-MAP     Document 33-1     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 7 of 14(cid:10)\n2.  Arm’s length negotiations\nThe case settled after months of negotiations by counsel.15 The parties began negotiating a\nsettlement in June 2006. After the Court certified the case as a class action, plaintiffs made a detailed\nsettlement proposal on August 2, 2006. In late August, the parties reached agreement in principle on\nthe terms of the settlement. It took another four months to agree on the details contained in the\nSettlement Agreement. This settlement is the result of very vigorous negotiations. \nD.  The Amount of the Settlement is Fair, Reasonable and Adequate\nThe Court should examine the amount of recovery as well as the plan for distributing the\nrecovery to class members in order to determine whether the proposed monetary settlement is fair,\nreasonable and adequate. “[I]n any case, there is a range of reasonableness with respect to a\nsettlement . . . .”16 The settlement in this case is well within that range. \nIn the two prior Massachusetts strip search class action cases, Judge Nancy Gertner approved\na $10 million settlement for approximately 5,400 women in Mack v. Suffolk County and Magistrate\nJudge Robert Collings approved a $1.35 million settlement for approximately 700 women in Connor\nv. Plymouth County. In Mack, 1,500 women filed claims while 113 did in Connor.17\nDistrict courts in other jurisdictions have approved comparable lump-sum settlements in\nsimilar strip search class actions.18 In Eddleman v. Jefferson County, the court approved a settlement\nof $11.5 million for a class of about 50,000 class members - more than 4,000 made claims. In Tyson\n15 Support for this statement and the rest of this paragraph is found in Ex. 2 at ¶22 (Affidavit of Howard\nFriedman).\n16 Newman, 464 F.2d at 693. \n17 Ex. 2 at ¶¶14-15 (Affidavit of Howard Friedman).\n18 Support for this statement and the rest of this paragraph is found in Ex. 2 at ¶¶18, 17 and 16 (Affidavit of\nHoward Friedman).\n7\n\nCase 3:05-cv-30017-MAP     Document 33-1     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 8 of 14(cid:10)\nv. City of New York, the court approved a $50 million settlement for a class of over 50,000 -\napproximately 6,000 made claims. In Nilsen, the court approved a $3.3 million settlement for more\nthan 7,000 people - approximately 1,400 made claims. The settlement in this case of $205,000 to a\npotential class of 90 people falls comfortably within the “range of reasonableness” established by\nprior settlements approved by courts here in Massachusetts and elsewhere.\nE.  The Distribution Formula is Fair, Reasonable and Adequate\nPlaintiffs’ counsel approached settlement with the helpful experience of having settled, with\ncourt approval, two similar strip search class action case in Massachusetts, Mack v. Suffolk County\nand Connor v. Plymouth County, and one in Maine, Nilsen v. York County.19 Plaintiffs’ counsel had\nthe additional benefit of advice from lawyers who had settled similar strip search class actions in\nother states. Some of those settlements required individualized determinations of each class\nmember’s subjective experience to determine his or her share of the settlement. This method proved\nto be so time consuming and expensive that it harmed the class as a whole. For example, in the\nTyson case the claims administrator was paid an amount that nearly equaled the amount distributed\nto the class. In that case, a claimant could only obtain a payment of $250 without providing answers\nto a detailed claim form and releases for medical, employment, social security and educational\nrecords. A settlement that attempted to decide damages individually would require spending much\nmore money to administer the fact finding process. Counsel felt that given the limited funds available\nto settle this case, a proposal that limited administrative expenses in favor of payments to class\nmembers would be more beneficial to the class.\n19 Support for this statement and the rest of this paragraph is found in Ex. 2 at ¶¶13 and 21 (Affidavit of Howard\nFriedman).\n8\n\nCase 3:05-cv-30017-MAP     Document 33-1     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 9 of 14(cid:10)\nTherefore, plaintiffs’ counsel agreed to a settlement that provides one payment to every\nperson who was subjected to the defendants’ policy. Those people who were arrested more than once\nduring the class period do not receive additional payments because it is unlikely that a jury would\nreward a person for being arrested several times. Rather, it is more likely that a jury would feel the\nstrip search was much less traumatic when the detainee had been through the search previously and\nwould not be surprised by it the second or third time. Similarly, in administering the 9/11 Victim\nCompensation Fund, Kenneth Fineberg decided to award every family the same amount for non-\neconomic damages, recognizing how difficult it would be for him to attempt to make fine\ndistinctions between the pain and suffering of the families.20\nF. The Attorney’s Fees and Expenses are Reasonable\nClass counsel will request an attorney’s fee of 33.3% of the common fund plus litigation and\nclaims administration expenses as provided for in the fee agreement between class counsel and the\nclass representative.21 This is consistent with the fees awarded to counsel in other similar strip search\nclass action cases. In Mack, class counsel was awarded fees of 30% of a $10 million settlement fund.\nIn Connor, class counsel was awarded a fee of 33% of a $1.35 million settlement fund. In Eddleman\nv. Jefferson County, class counsel was awarded 33.3% of a $11.5 million settlement fund. In Moser\nv. Anderson, class counsel was awarded 33.3% of the $3 million settlement fund.\nThe fee is justified by the amount of work, skill, and expertise needed to settle this case with\nthe results achieved. Counsel will file a motion for attorney’s fees and expenses under Fed. R.Civ.P.\n23(h) to be heard at the time of the fairness hearing. Counsel will provide the Court with a lodestar\nfigure for attorney’s fees as a method to verify the reasonableness of the percent of fund method. \n20 http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/11/07/60minutes/main582529.shtml.\n21 Ex. 2 at ¶25 (Affidavit of Howard Friedman).\n9\n\nCase 3:05-cv-30017-MAP     Document 33-1     Filed 12/29/2006     Page 10 of 14(cid:10)\nG.  Bonus Should Be Paid to Compensate the Named Class Representative\nClass counsel requests an incentive payment of $10,000 for named class representative\nCharles V. Ryan IV.22 The purpose of the bonus is to compensate him for his loss of privacy as a\nresult of bringing this case and for the time he spent in responding to discovery and working with\ncounsel to benefit the entire class. Mr. Ryan spent significant time on this case: not only was he\ndeposed, he also answered individual discovery requests, and he consulted with counsel throughout\nthe litigation. Mr. Ryan endured a loss of his personal privacy by revealing his name to bring this\nlawsuit on behalf of the class.\n“Courts routinely approve incentive awards to compensate named plaintiffs for the services\nthey provided and the risks they incurred during the course of the class action litigation.”23 In\nEddleman, the court approved bonuses of $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000 to the class representatives\nand other class members who assisted class counsel in litigating the case.24 In Mack, the court\napproved bonuses in the amount of $15,000 for acting as a class representative and $5,000 for being\nthe subject of a deposition. In Brecher v. St. Croix County, the two named plaintiffs shared an\nincentive award of $35,000.\nBonuses are particularly proper for the named class representative here because he agreed\nto sacrifice his privacy in the embarrassing context of admitting that he was arrested and forced to\nstrip naked as part of his detention in jail. It would be unfair not to compensate him for efforts that\nhelped achieve a benefit for the entire class.\n22 Support for this statement and the rest of this paragraph is found in Ex.2 at ¶24 (Affidavit of Howard Friedman).\n23 In re Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, 175 F.R.D. 270, 272-273 (S.D.Ohio 1997)(citing 10 other courts\nwhere incentive awards were approved); Spicer v.

The Notice to Class Members Satisfies Due Process Requirements and the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 23 \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) requires that notice of the proposed settlement be sent to all members of\nthe class “in such manner as the court directs.”\n“An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to\nbe accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested\nparties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.”25\n“Where the name and last known address of a class member or individual party is known or is\ncapable of being readily identified,” individual notice must be given.26 Plaintiffs propose sending\nindividual notice to each class member based on the mailing addresses provided at booking unless\nupdated by the class member.\nThe Notice of Class Action and Proposed Settlement is attached to the Settlement Agreement\nas Exhibit A. The Notice summarizes the terms of the settlement, describes the options of each class\nmember, discloses the bonus to the class representative, discloses the proposed amount of attorney’s\nfees and expenses and that this issue will be decided by the Court at the fairness hearing, gives the\ndate, time and place of the fairness hearing, and provides contact information for any questions about\nthe settlement.27 The notice is drafted in plain English. This notice will be sent by first class mail,\npostage-prepaid, to all potential class members at their last known addresses within three weeks of\nthe court’s order granting preliminary approval of the settlement.\n25 Mullane v.

First, because some class members may have moved without leaving a forwarding\naddress, and to account for any errors in the class list, the notice plan also includes publication of\na settlement notice in three local newspapers. A notice, attached to the Settlement Agreement as\nExhibit C, will be published in the Springfield Republican, the Daily Hampshire Gazette and the\nGreenfield Recorder. Second, the press will be notified of the settlement, through a release which\nis attached as Exhibit E, which is likely to result in news coverage of the settlement. Class members\nare more likely to learn of this settlement through news coverage than through paid notices in a\nnewspaper. Third, the defendants have agreed to post a notice, attached as Exhibit D, in the Booking\nRoom of the Hampshire Jail. Finally, a website will be established to provide additional information.\nThe notices, forms and other information on the case will be posted to the website. The notice plan\nis designed to reach as many class members as possible, not to simply meet minimum due process\nrequirements.\nV.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE SETTLEMENT\nClass counsel recommend that this Court appoint Analytics, Inc. as the claims administrator.\nDocuments regarding Analytics are attached to the Settlement Agreement as Exhibit F. Analytics\nis the oldest class action consulting firm in the country.28 They have experience in processing\nsettlements in strip search class actions, having handled the administration of the Bilovde case in\nWisconsin, the Nilsen case in Maine and distribution of the settlement proceeds of the Connor case\nin Massachusetts. Class members will be able to fill out a simple claim form, a copy of which is\nattached to the Settlement Agreement as Exhibit B.\n28 Support for this statement and the rest of this paragraph is found in Ex. 2 at ¶26 (Affidavit of Howard\nFriedman) and Exhibit F to the Settlement Agreement (Affidavit of Richard W.

This is a civil rights class action for declaratory and injunctive relief and \nmoney damages against Hampshire Sheriff Robert]. Garvey in his individual capacity \nfor routine unconstitutional strip searches on intake of pre-arraignment detainees, \n2.  The named plaintiff Charles V, Ryan IV, seeks to represent a class of all \npeople strip searched on or after January 18, 2002, without individualized reasonable \nsuspicion at the Hampshire Jail and House of Correction due to the policies or practices \nof the defendant Hampshire Sheriff: \nwhile waiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being arrested \non charges that did not involve a weapon or drugs or contraband or a violent \nfelony,  including arrests on a default or other warrant on charges that did not \ninvolve a weapon or drugs or contraband or a violent felony, \n\n3.  \"Strip search\" is used in this Complaint to refer to the inspection by a law \nenforcement officer of a person's bare breasts, buttocks, or genitals. \n4.  On information and belief, over a hundred people have been subjected to \nunconstitutional  strip  searches  upon  admission  to  the  Hampshire  Jail/House  of \nCorrection. \nJURISDICTION \n5.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.s.c. §§ 1983 and 1988 and the \nFourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \nJurisdiction is founded upon 28 U.s.c. §§1331 and 1343. \nPARTIES \n6.  Named plaintiff Charles V.  Ryan  IV  was  at all  times  relevant to this \ncomplaint a resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  He is an attorney and \nformer Hampshire County Commissioner. He was arrested at his home law office at \napproximately 4:45 p.m. on the Friday before a long weekend (Martin Luther King, Jf. \nholiday). \n7.  The defendant Robert J. Garvey was a resident of the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts  and  the  Hampshire  Sheriff during the time  period  relevant to this \ncomplaint. He is sued in his individual capacity for actions he took under color of law. \n8.  The defendant Patrick J. Cahillane was a resident of the Commonwealth \nof Massachusetts and the Deputy Superintendent responsible for  operation of the \n-2-\n\nHampshire  Jail  and  House  of Correction  during the  time  period  relevant  to  this \ncomplaint. He is sued in his individual capacity for actions he took under color of law. \nFACTS \n9.  At 4:45 p.m. on Friday,  January 18, 2002, plaintiff Charles V. Ryan IV \nwas arrested in Worthington, Massachusetts for allegedly violating a protective order \ntwo days earlier. The alleged violation consisted of driving by his ex-wife's home. \n10.  There was no allegation that the violation of the protective order involved \nviolence or a threat of violence. \n11.  Mr. Ryan was taken by state police officers to the Russell State Police \nBarracks for booking. \n12.  State police officers then took Mr. Ryan to the Hampshire Jail and House \nof Correction to be held for his first court appearance on the following Tuesday morning, \nsince Monday was a holiday. \n13.  On information and belief, it was the practice of State Police officers and \nother police officers in Hampshire County to bring pre-arraignment detainees to the \nHampshire J ail and House of Correction to be held before a first court appearance when \nthe person could not make bail. \n14.  On admission to the Jail and House of Correction, a correctional officer \nordered Mr. Ryan to remove all of his clothing and submit to a strip search. \n15.  Because  he  had no  choice,  Mr.  Ryan  complied with the  request.  He \nremoved his clothing and followed orders of the correctional officer to bend over. \n-3-\n\n16.  The  correctional  officer  visually  inspected  the  plaintiff's  nude  body \nincluding his genitals. \n17.  The correctional officer had no reason to suspect that Mr. Ryan had any \nweapons or contraband hidden on his person. \n18.  After the strip search, the correctional officer told Mr. Ryan to change into \na jail uniform. \n19.  Because the following Monday was a holiday, Mr. Ryan did not appear in \ncourt until Tuesday, January 22,2002.  On that day Sheriff's officers took Mr. Ryan to \ncourt.  He was arraigned by the judge and released from custody. \n20.  The criminal charge against Mr. Ryan was dismissed a few months later in \nMay 2002, when the Commonwealth filed a nolle prosequi. \n21.  Mr. Ryan suffered emotional distress as a result of the strip search. He was \nshocked by the incident.  He felt humiliated, degraded, and violated. \n22.  The policy or practice established and/or maintained by Sheriff Garvey and \nimplemented by defendant Cahillane was  to  require Hampshire Jail  and House of \nCorrection officers to view, without evaluating for individualized reasonable suspicion, \nthe naked body of every person at the time of admission to the Hampshire Jail and \nHouse of Correction. This policy or practice applied regardless of the person's charges \nor anticipated duration of detention. The policy or practice directed employees of the \nSheriff's Department to conduct illegal strip searches of the plaintiff and members of the \nplaintiff class. \n-4-\n\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n23.  This action is brought pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b) (1)  and (3) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure by the named plaintiff as a class action on behalf of all \npeople strip searched on or after January 18, 2002, without individualized reasonable \nsuspicion at the Hampshire Jail and House of Correction due to a policy or practice of \nSheriff Garvey: \nwhile waiting for bail to be set or for a first court appearance after being arrested \non charges that did not involve a weapon or drugs or contraband or a violent \nfelony,  including arrests on a default or other warrant on charges that did not \ninvolve a weapon or drugs or contraband or a violent felony. \n24.  The named plaintiff, Charles V. Ryan IV, is a  member of the class. The \nclass represented by the plaintiff is  so  numerous that joinder of all such persons is \nimpractical. On information and belief, the policy or practice described above has existed \nfor several years, affecting hundreds of potential class members.  It continued to exist for \napproximately  one  year  after  this  incident  until  a  policy  that  comports  with \nconstitutional standards was implemented. \n25.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class of plaintiffs. \nCentral to all the claims is the nature and constitutionality of the policy or practice of \nSheriff  Garvey  regarding  intake  strip  searches  without  individualized  reasonable \nsuspicion of pre-arraignment detainees. \n26.  The  named  plaintiff's  claims  or defenses  are  typical  of the  claims  or \ndefenses of the class of plaintiffs. \n-5-\n\n27.  The named plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent and protect the \ninterests of the members of the class. Counsel for the plaintiff is experienced and capable \nin civil rights litigation. Class counsel has successfully represented plaintiffs in other class \nactions alleging unlawful strip searches.  Counsel has the resources and expertise to \nprosecute this action. \n28.  This  action  is  properly  maintainable  as  a  class  action  because  the \nprosecutions of separate actions by the individual members of the class would create a \nrisk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \nclass, which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the defendant. \n29.  This  action  is  properly  maintainable  as  a  class  action  because  the \nprosecutions of separate actions would create a risk of adjudications with respect to \nindividual members of the class that would, as a practical matter, be dispositive of the \ninterests of the other members who are not parties or would substantially impair or \nimpede their ability to protect their interests. \n30.  As a direct result of policy or practice, class members have been subjected \nto  unlawful  strip searches,  which has  caused  each  member of the class  to endure \nemotional distress, humiliation, and degradation. \nCLAIM: 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n31.  The above paragraphs are incorporated herein. \n32.  Sheriff Garvey was the chief executive officer of the Hampshire Sheriffs \nDepartment. In this position he was responsible for establishing policies for correctional \n-6-\n\nofficers and for supervising correctional offICers at the Hampshire Jail and House of \nCorrection. \n33.  At the time of this incident, the Sheriff's formal written policies for the Jail \nand House of Correction did not make any distinction in the level of cause needed to \nconduct a strip search of pre-arraignment detainees from the cause needed to strip search \npre-trial  detainees  or convicted  prisoners.  The  policy  affirmatively permitted  strip \nsearches on a detainee's entrance into the facility without any reason to suspect the \nperson had hidden contraband. \n34.  On information and belief every person who was required to put on a jail \nuniform during the class period was subjected to a strip search without regard for cause. \n35.  Sheriff Garvey implemented, knew, or should have known that there was \na policy or practice of conducting strip searches, without individualized reasonable \nsuspicion,  at intake of pre-arraignment  prisoners  in violation of the United States \nConstitution. He had an obligation to correct this practice so that it would conform to \nthe Constitution but instead he allowed it to continue. \n36.  Deputy Superintendent Cahillanewas responsible for supervision and daily \noperations of the Hampshire Jail and House of Correction. \n37.  Deputy Superintendent Cahillane implemented,  knew,  or should have \nknown  that  there  was  a  policy  or  practice  of conducting  strip  searches,  without \nindividualized reasonable suspicion, at intake of pre-arraignment prisoners in violation \n-7-\n\nof the United States Constitution. He had an obligation to correct this practice so that \nit would conform to the Constitution but instead he allowed it to continue. \n3S.  By January IS, 2002, the law was clearly established that routine intake \nstrip searches of pre-arraignment detainees like the plaintiff and members of the plaintiff \nclass without evaluating for cause were unconstitutional.  A decision granting summary \njudgment to plaintiffs for a similar policy implemented by the Sheriff of Suffolk County, \nMassachusetts was issued on July 31,2001. Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F.Supp.2d 131 \n(D.Mass. 200 I) holding the law was clearly established in 1997. \n39.  By  the  actions  described  above,  the  defendants  deprived  the  named \nplaintiff and members of the plaintiff class of their clearly established right, guaranteed \nby the Constitution of the United States, to be free from unreasonable searches. \n40.  As a direct and proximate result of this conduct, the plaintiffs have suffered \ninjuries as described above. \nWHEREFORE the plaintiffs request that this Court: \nI.  Award compensatory damages and punitive damages to the named plaintiff \nand to members of the plaintiff class; \n2.  Award the plaintiffs the costs ofthis action including reasonable attorney's \nfees; and \n3.  Award  whatever  additional  relief  this  Court  deems  necessary and \nappropriate. \n-S-\n\nJURY DEMAND \nA jury trial is hereby demanded. \nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, \nJennifer Bills \nMyong J.
