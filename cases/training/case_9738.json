The named plaintiff, represented by private attorney Mark E. Merin, alleged that she was forced to strip naked, submit to a body cavity search, and display her genitalia to male officers.  She further alleged that the practice was pursuant to official Placer County Jail policy, under which officers routinely subjected custodial detainees to strip and visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment and in the absence of any reasonable suspicion that the detainees possessed contraband or weapons.  Plaintiff alleged that such policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as California state law.  To remedy the alleged violations, Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.</p><p>On October 27, 2006, the parties filed a stipulation for voluntary dismissal of the suit, advising the Court that they had reached a mutual resolution of the case.  The terms of the settlement were not made part of the Court record.</p><p></p>",

PLACER COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\n1 COUNTY’S and the SHERIFF’S policies, practices, and customs concerning the use of strip searches\n2 and visual body cavity searches in Placer County Jails.  Plaintiff seeks an order declaring illegal\n3 defendants’ policy of subjecting detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches\n4 before they are arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the searches will be\n5 productive of contraband. \n6 Defendants’ strip search and visual body cavity search policies, practices, and customs violate\n7 those rights of plaintiff, and all those she represents, that are secured by the Fourth and Fourteenth\n8 Amendments to the United States Constitution and entitle plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, to\n9 recover damages under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1983).  \n10 JURISDICTION\n11 1. This action is brought pursuant to 42 USC §§ 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth and\n12 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 USC §§\n13 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.  \n14 PARTIES\n15 2. Plaintiff ANGELIC SANCHEZ, and all those similarly situated, are, and at all material\n16 times herein, were citizens of the United States and residents of the state of California who were\n17 arrested within the period beginning two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing\n18 to this date, and who were subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches at a Placer County Jail\n19 (hereinafter referred to as the “Placer County Jail”), prior to being arraigned and/or without the\n20 defendants first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be\n21 productive of contraband or weapons.\n22 3. Defendant PLACER COUNTY SHERIFF EDWARD N. BONNER is, and at all\n23 material times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of PLACER COUNTY, responsible for\n24 administering the Jail facilities and for making, overseeing, and implementing the policies, practices,\n25 and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of the Placer County Jail.  He is sued in his\n26 individual and official capacities.\nPage 2 of 12\nANGELIC SANCHEZ, et al. v. PLACER COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\n1 4. Defendants PLACER COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES sued herein by their fictitious\n2 names (DOES 1 through 50) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the Placer County Jail,\n3 subjected plaintiff, and all those she represents, to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity\n4 searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be\n5 productive of contraband or weapons. \n6 5. At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n7 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages of\n8 the state of California, PLACER COUNTY and/or the PLACER COUNTY SHERIFF’S\n9 DEPARTMENT. \n10 6. Defendants whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names\n11 of ROES 1 through 20, are all agents and/or employees of one or another of the other named\n12 defendants who ordered, condoned, authorized, covered up, or were otherwise associated with the\n13 implementation of the illegal policy and practices relating to strip searches complained of herein.  \n14 7. Defendant PLACER COUNTY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was a\n15 division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or practice\n16 causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs\n17 damaged plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.  Plaintiff’s allegations against the\n18 COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF and his DEPUTIES and on acts and\n19 omissions of persons who are COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTY’s breach of its duty to\n20 protect plaintiff, and all those she represents, from the wrongful conduct of said persons and\n21 employees.\n22 8. Defendants PLACER COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT and PLACER\n23 COUNTY SHERIFF EDWARD N. BONNER,  in his Individual and Official Capacity, also\n24 maintained or permitted an official policy or custom of causing or permitting the occurrence of the\n25 types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged plaintiff, and all those similarly\n26 situated, as herein alleged.  \nPage 3 of 12\nANGELIC SANCHEZ, et al. v. PLACER COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\n1 9. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period beginning two\n2 (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, were subjected by defendants\n3 to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, and recording\n4 in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.  \n5 FACTS\n6 10. In or about January 2004, plaintiff ANGELIC SANCHEZ (hereinafter referred to as\n7 “plaintiff”) was arrested for a minor crime not involving violence, drugs or weapons.  Plaintiff was\n8 taken first to the Roseville City Jail and the next day transported to Placer County Jail in Auburn,\n9 California, where, prior to her arraignment, she was coerced, forced, and compelled to strip naked by\n10 Asian Female Deputy DOE 1, to bend over and repeatedly to spread the lips of her vagina so that the\n11 Deputy DOE 1 could inspect her vaginal canal.  She was repeatedly told to “spread your lips further,\n12 wider”; then DOE 1 made gagging sounds which alerted plaintiff to the presence of males standing at\n13 the open door watching the plaintiff display her genitalia to male officers, DOES 2 through 5.  \n14 11. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that she, like all those she\n15 represents, was videotaped during the complained of search, and that the videotaping of those\n16 subjected to the complained of searches is a component of the defendants’ strip/visual body cavity\n17 search policy, custom, and practice.\n18 12. Prior to being strip searched and being humiliated as described in the preceding\n19 paragraph, plaintiff witnessed and was traumatized by the physical strip search of another Caucasian\n20 woman in custody who was strip searched in her presence in part because the officers DOES 6 through\n21 8, as discussed in her presence, desired to determine if the woman’s “boobs were real or not.”  That\n22 woman who was forcibly strip searched in plaintiff’s clear view, had her head slammed against the\n23 wall and sustained a cut to her face which plaintiff had an opportunity to inspect in the holding cell in\n24 which she was placed with the forcible strip search victim.  \n25 13. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that defendants routinely\n26 follow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including plaintiff,\nPage 4 of 12\nANGELIC SANCHEZ, et al. v. PLACER COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\n1 and all those she represents, to strip and visual body cavity searches without first having, and recording\n2 in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search will be productive of contraband or weapons. \n3 Plaintiff is further informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that defendants routinely follow their\n4 policy, practice, and custom of videotaping the complained of searches.\n5 14. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants have the ability\n6 to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants’ custody, at\n7 the Placer County Jail within two (2) years prior to the filing of this Complaint, were subjected to strip\n8 searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment without defendants having first, and\n9 recording, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n10 15. Defendant PLACER COUNTY SHERIFF EDWARD N. BONNER is personally\n11 responsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom\n12 pursuant to which plaintiff, and those she represents, were subjected. \n13 16. As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, plaintiff, and\n14 each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of\n15 privacy, and violation of due process of law and state and federal statutory and constitutional rights,\n16 and is entitled to recover damages according to proof but, at a minimum, $1,000 as specified in\n17 California Penal Code § 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b).\n18 CLASS CLAIMS\n19 17. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiff, and all those similarly\n20 situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants\n21 PLACER COUNTY SHERIFF EDWARD N. BONNER, PLACER COUNTY SHERIFF’S\n22 DEPARTMENT, PLACER COUNTY, the individual SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES sued herein by the\n23 fictitious names DOES 1 through 50, and the individuals whose names are not now known and who\n24 are sued by the fictitious names of ROES 1 through 20.  The searches complained of herein were\n25 performed without regard to the nature of the alleged offense for which plaintiff, and all those similarly\n26 situated, had been arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiff, or those she represents, was\nPage 5 of 12\nANGELIC SANCHEZ, et al. v. PLACER COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\n1 eligible for cite and release under Penal Code § 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiff, and\n2 each of those similarly situated, was eligible for and/or was released on his or her own recognizance. \n3 Furthermore, the searches complained of herein were performed without defendants having a\n4 reasonable belief that the plaintiff, or any of those similarly situated, so searched possessed weapons or\n5 contraband, and those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.  And\n6 the searches complained of herein were performed without defendants taking reasonable precautions to\n7 make certain that plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, was not observed by others not\n8 involved in the search and/or of the opposite sex.  Additionally, plaintiff is informed and believes, and\n9 thereon alleges, that a component of the searches complained of herein was defendants’ videotaping of\n10 the plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated.\n11 18. Plaintiff brings this action on her own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n12 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n13 19. The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including two (2)\n14 years prior to the filing of this Complaint, and continuing until this matter is adjudicated and the\n15 practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment strip and/or\n16 visual body cavity search at the Placer County Jail without defendants first having, and recording in\n17 writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.\n18 20. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the\n19 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiff does not know the exact\n20 number of class members.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are\n21 more than 10 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of defendants and\n22 are subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and\n23 custom relating to said searches.  \n24 21. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is informed\n25 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact common to the class\n26 including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to visual\nPage 6 of 12\nANGELIC SANCHEZ, et al. v. PLACER COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\n1 body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be housed in the Placer County\n2 Jail; (2) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment\n3 without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on specific or articulable facts, to believe any\n4 particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or contraband in bodily cavities which could be\n5 detected by means of a strip and/or visual body cavity search; (3) whether the strip and/or visual body\n6 cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons\n7 not participating in the searches; (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are\n8 videotaped and whether and under what circumstances said videotapes are subsequently viewed; and,\n9 (5) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are reasonably related to defendants’\n10 penological interest to maintain the security of the jail and whether or not there are less intrusive\n11 methods for protecting any such interest. \n12 22. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is informed\n13 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of law common to the class\n14 including, but are not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity\n15 searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or\n16 articulable facts, to believe any particular prearraignment detainee has concealed drugs, weapons\n17 and/or contraband which would likely be discovered by a strip and/or visual body cavity search; (2)\n18 whether defendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity searches on persons without first\n19 reasonably relating the use of the subject search to defendants’ penological interest to maintain the\n20 security of the jail and determining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that interest; (3)\n21 whether strip and/or visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the search can be\n22 observed by people not participating in the search without violating plaintiffs’ State and Federal\n23 constitutional rights and plaintiffs’ State statutory rights; (4) whether or not defendants’ strip search\n24 policy and procedure is in accordance with the State and/or Federal Constitution; and (5) whether or\n25 not defendants’ policy and procedure of videotaping those subjected to the complained of searches\n26 violates plaintiffs’ State and/or Federal Constitutional rights to privacy.  \nPage 7 of 12\nANGELIC SANCHEZ, et al. v. PLACER COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\n1 23. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n2 representative plaintiff is typical of the class.  Plaintiff was searched, prior to arraignment, without\n3 reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons or\n4 contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in a supervisor-\n5 approved writing).  Representative plaintiff has the same interests and suffered the same type of\n6 injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiff’s claims arose because of defendants’ policy, practice,\n7 and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches before arraignment\n8 without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of\n9 contraband or weapons.  Each class member suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a\n10 strip and/or visual body cavity search.  The actual damages suffered by the representative plaintiff is\n11 similar in type and amount to the actual damages suffered by each class member.  \n12 24. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n13 plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiff’s interests are consistent with\n14 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n15 25. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosecutions of\n16 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying\n17 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards\n18 of conduct for the parties opposing the complaint.  \n19 26. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of\n20 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications\n21 with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a practical matter, substantially impair\n22 or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.\n23 27. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiff is\n24 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\n25 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n26 respect to the class as a whole.  \nPage 8 of 12\nANGELIC SANCHEZ, et al. v. PLACER COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\n1 28. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action is\n2 superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between\n3 the parties.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the interests of members of\n4 the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in that most class\n5 members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiff also is informed and\n6 believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that separate\n7 suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that most\n8 members of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiff is informed and\n9 believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all\n10 of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., the Placer County Jail.  It will promote judicial efficiency\n11 to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.  \n12 29. Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff is informed\n13 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the identities of the class members may be ascertained from\n14 records maintained by PLACER COUNTY and defendant PLACER COUNTY SHERIFF EDWARD\n15 N. BONNER and defendant PLACER COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT.  Plaintiff is informed\n16 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants’ records reflect the identities, including addresses\n17 and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody in the Placer County Jails. \n18 Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that records of, and maintained by defendants\n19 reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search occurred, where\n20 the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and was recorded in a\n21 supervisor-approved writing, whether the search was videotaped, when persons searched were\n22 arraigned, and the charges on which such persons were arrested.  Plaintiff is informed and believes,\n23 and thereupon alleges, that all of the foregoing information is contained in defendants’ computer\n24 system and that the information necessary to identify the class members, by last known addresses, and\n25 the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from custody, is readily available from said\n26 computer system.  \nPage 9 of 12\nANGELIC SANCHEZ, et al. v. PLACER COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\n1 30. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(c)(2)(b), class members\n2 must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice\n3 to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and\n4 thereupon alleges, that defendants’ computer records contain a last known address for class members. \n5 Plaintiff contemplates that individual notice will be given to class members at such last known address\n6 by first class mail.  Plaintiff contemplates that the notice will inform class members of the following:\n7 i. The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class;\n8 ii. The nature of the action;\n9 iii. Their right to “opt out” of the action within a given time, in which event they\n10 will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n11 iv. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to be represented by their own counsel and\n12 to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be represented by the\n13 named class plaintiff(s) and the named class plaintiff(s)’s counsel; and \n14 v. Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to share in any recovery in favor of the\n15 class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues\n16 adverse to the class.  \n17 COUNT ONE\n(Violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n18 on behalf of Plaintiff and all persons similarly situated)\n19 31. Plaintiff hereby re-alleges and incorporates herein as if fully set forth each of the\n20 preceding paragraphs to the extent relevant.\n21 32. Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual body cavity\n22 searches complained of herein violated plaintiff’s, and all those similarly situated’s,  rights under the\n23 Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, violated plaintiff’s, and all\n24 those similarly situated’s, rights to due process and privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment, and\n25 directly and proximately damaged plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged, entitling\n26\nPage 10 of 12\nANGELIC SANCHEZ, et al. v. PLACER COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\n1 plaintiff, and all class members, to recover damages for said constitutional violations pursuant to 42\n2 U.S.C. § 1983. \n3 WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays for relief, for herself and for all persons similarly situated, as\n4 hereunder appears.\n5 PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n6 WHEREFORE, plaintiff, on behalf of herself and all those similarly situated, seeks judgment\n7 as follows:\n8 1. For declaratory and injunctive relief declaring illegal and enjoining, preliminarily and\n9 permanently, defendants’ policies, practices, and customs of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees to\n10 strip and visual body cavity searches without having a reasonable suspicion that such searches would\n11 be productive of contraband or weapons;\n12 2. Certification as a class action of plaintiff’s complaints concerning defendants’ policies,\n13 practice, and customs of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees to strip and visual body cavity searches\n14 without having a reasonable suspicion that such searches would be productive of contraband or\n15 weapons;\n16 3. For compensatory, general, and special damages for each representative and for each\n17 member of the class of plaintiffs, as against all defendants;\n18 4. Exemplary damages as against each of the individual defendants in an amount sufficient\n19 to deter and to make an example of those defendants;\n20 5. Attorneys’ fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and \n21 6.
