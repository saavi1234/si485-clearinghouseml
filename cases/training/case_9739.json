Specifically, Plaintiff alleged that he was subjected to a group strip search prior to arraignment and in the absence of any reasonable suspicion of contraband or weapons.  Plaintiff alleged that such a practice violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution as well as California state law.  To remedy the alleged violations, Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.</p><p>The District Court (Judge Maxine M. Chesney) held an initial scheduling conference and submitted the case to the Court's alternative dispute resolution program.  Mediation was held on November 28, 2006, but did not produce a settlement.  Through subsequent negotiations, the parties eventually settled.</p><p>Following a November 16, 2007 fairness hearing, the District Court  approved the class action settlement.  Under the settlement, two separate classes of claimants were created: (1) those booked into the Santa Rita Jail from 1/17/04 to 12/31/06 who were strip searched in groups; and (2) those booked into Santa Rita Jail or Glenn Dyer Jail from 1/17/04 to 12/31/06 on charges not involving violence, drugs, or weapons who were strip searched, except for those who were required to submit to such searches as a condition of parole or probation.  Defendants agreed to pay a maximum of $6.15 million to settle all claims of both classes.  Of that sum, $1.175 million went to class counsel Mark Merin for attorneys' fees.  Up to $275,000 was allocated for the costs of claims administration.  Finally, a total of $4.7 million would be used to pay individual claims, based on an agreed distribution formula.</p><p></p>",

The named plaintiff, a citizen arrested for an outstanding traffic warrant, alleged that he was subjected to a strip search with a group of several others.  He further alleged that his treatment was the result of the official Alameda County Jail policy, under which officers routinely subjected custodial detainees to strip and visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment and in the absence of any reasonable suspicion of contraband or weapons.  Plaintiff alleged that such a policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution as well as California state law.  The case was eventually settled in November 2007; Defendants agreed to pay a maximum of $6.15 million to settle all claims of both classes.",

Dist. #C06-0310 MMC \n\nCase 3:06-cv-00310-MMC     Document 73      Filed 11/26/2007     Page 2 of 5\n1 After  considering  the  submissions  of  the  parties,  including  the  Stipulated  Motion  for \n2 Preliminary Approval of Provisional Settlement Class and Settlement of Class Action, together \n3 with  the  extensive  exhibits  attached  thereto;  the  unopposed  Application  of  Plaintiff’s  Class \n4 Counsel for Award of Attorneys= Fees and Costs; the Joint Submission of the Parties in Support of \n5 Final  Approval  of  the  Amended  Stipulation  of  Settlement;  the  arguments  of  counsel;  the \n6 submission from the Class Claims Administrator, and the objections to the settlement filed with \n7 the Court, \n8 IT IS NOW ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED AS FOLLOWS: \n9 1. On June 20, 2007, this Court entered its order preliminarily approving settlement of \n10 the above-captioned class action.  Since the entry of the Court=s Preliminary Order, in accordance \n11 with the Amended Stipulation of Settlement as proved to the satisfaction of the Court, the requisite \n12 notice of the Settlement, with opt-out and objection information, was published in the East Bay \n13 Express on July 18, 25 and August 1, 2007, and in the Daily Review, the Oakland Tribune, and the \n14 Tri-Valley Herald on July 19, 25, and 31, 2007.  The notice of the Settlement and approved claim \n15 forms, were posted by First Class Mail to the last-known address of each person in the Settlement \nClass.  Both the published notice and the mailed notice specified that Claim Forms had to be \n16\ndelivered to the Claims Administrator, postmarked no later than October 11, 2007.  \n17\n2. Both the published and mailed notices specified that any person who chooses to \n18\nobject to the Settlement, either personally or through counsel, and desired to appear at the Fairness \n19\nHearing, was required to submit a Notice of Intention to appear, together with written arguments in \n20\nsupport of any objection, by October 11, 2007.  Five written objections were received by counsel \n21\nand filed with the Court.\n22\n3. The Court finds that the Class should be and hereby is certified under Rule 23(a) \n23\nand Rule 23(b)(3) because it satisfies all of the requirements for certification as recited by the \n24\nCourt in the hearing on the fairness of the settlement on November 16, 2007. \n25\n4. The Court is satisfied from all of the memoranda of law, declarations, and exhibits \n26\nsubmitted to the Court that the Amended Stipulation of Settlement is fair, and the Court now finds \n27\nfor the reasons stated on the record at the hearing on November 16, 2007, that the Amended \n28\n -2- \nAMENDED [PROPOSED] ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nDaniel Schaffer vs. County of Alameda, et al.; USDC-Nor. Dist. #C06-0310 MMC \n\nCase 3:06-cv-00310-MMC     Document 73      Filed 11/26/2007     Page 3 of 5\n1 Stipulation of Settlement is fair and finally approves it as such.  The Amended Stipulation of \n2 Settlement is incorporated herein by this reference as if set out in full. \n3 5. The  “Settlement  Class”  means  all  of  those  persons  who  are  members  of  the \n4 following defined classes who, during the class periods identified below, were booked at Alameda \n5 County Santa Rita or Glenn Dyer Jails, assigned to a housing unit and strip searched at said \n6 facilities prior to arraignment on the charges for which they were booked: \n7 a.  The following persons shall be referred to as the “Group Search Class”:  (1) \n8 All  arrestees  booked  into  Santa  Rita  Jail  during  Class  Period  1  on  a  Felony \n9 involving  violence,  drugs  or  weapons  (“VDW”),  or  on  a  VDW  Misdemeanor \n10 Offense,  who  were  assigned  to  a  housing  unit  and  who  underwent  a  GROUP \n11 SEARCH prior to arraignment on the charges on which they were booked during \n12 Class Period 1 (January 17, 2004, through December 31, 2006);  (2) All arrestees \n13 booked into Santa Rita Jail during Class Period 1 on a non-VDW Offense, but who, \n14 during the Five (5) years prior to such Class Period 1 booking, had been arrested in \n15 ALAMEDA COUNTY on a VDW Felony or Misdemeanor Offense, or who, at the \n16 time of such Class Period 1 booking, were required to submit to a search of their \n17 person as a condition of parole or probation, who were assigned to a housing unit \n18 and who underwent a GROUP SEARCH prior to arraignment on the charges on \n19 which they were booked during Class Period 1. \n20 b.  The following persons shall be referred to as the “Illegal Search Class”:  All \n21 arrestees booked into Santa Rita or Glenn Dyer Jails during Class Period 2 (January \n22 17,  2004,  through  August  31,  2006)  on  a  non-VDW  Felony  or  Misdemeanor \n23 Offense, except those who, at the time of such Class Period 2 booking, had been \n24 arrested in ALAMEDA COUNTY in the Five (5) years prior to such Class Period 2 \n25 booking on a VDW Felony or Misdemeanor Offense, or who, at the time of such \n26 Class Period 2 booking, were required to submit to a search of their person as a \n27 condition of parole or probation, who were assigned to a housing unit and who \n28 underwent an ILLEGAL SEARCH prior to arraignment on the charges on which \n -3- \nAMENDED [PROPOSED] ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nDaniel Schaffer vs. County of Alameda, et al.; USDC-Nor. Dist. #C06-0310 MMC \n\nCase 3:06-cv-00310-MMC     Document 73      Filed 11/26/2007     Page 4 of 5\n1 they were booked during Class Period 2.\n2 6. Persons who previously commenced civil litigation challenging the legality of any \n3 strip search at the Alameda County jails during the class period and have prevailed, settled or had \n4 their complaints denied on their merits, and persons who have given timely notice of their election \n5 to be excluded from the Settlement Class are not included in the Settlement Class. \n6 7. With the exception of the five individuals identified on Exhibit A hereto, who \n7 submitted timely requests to the Claims Administrator to opt out of the Amended Stipulation of \n8 Settlement, all claims and complaints of the named Representative Plaintiff, together with all \n9 persons in the Settlement Class, are now dismissed with prejudice as to all of the Released \n10 Persons, defined to include all Defendants, their predecessors, successors, and/or assigns, together \n11 with past, present and future officials, employees, representatives, attorneys and/or agents of the \n12 County of Alameda.  Claims and complaints of such persons are now forever barred, and all \n13 Settlement Class Members are enjoined from asserting against any Released Persons any and all \n14 claims which the Settlement Class Members had, have, or may have in the future arising out of the \n15 facts alleged in the complaint. \n16 8. Each Released Person is released from the claims which any Settlement Class \nMember has had or may in the future have against any such Released Persons arising out of the \n17\nfacts in the complaint.   \n18\n9. This Court explicitly finds that the Amended Stipulation of Settlement, which is \n19\nnow made final by this Judgment, was entered into in good faith, is fair and reasonable, and \n20\nadequate, and is in the best interest of the Class.  The Court expressly finds the amount of \n21\nattorney’s fees and costs sought to be fair and reasonable and expressly approves payment to class \n22\ncounsel, Mark E. Merin of the Law Office of Mark E. Merin, in the amount of One Million, One \n23\nHundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($1,175,000.00), as and for attorney fees and costs, for \n24\nthe representation of Settlement Class Members herein, to be paid as provided in the Amended \n25\nStipulation of Settlement. \n26\n10. The Court further explicitly approves payment from the payment fund of a total of  \n27\nSeventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00) to be distributed to the Representative Plaintiff, \n28\n -4- \nAMENDED [PROPOSED] ORDER AND JUDGMENT OF DISMISSAL \nDaniel Schaffer vs. County of Alameda, et al.; USDC-Nor. Dist. #C06-0310 MMC \n\nCase 3:06-cv-00310-MMC     Document 73      Filed 11/26/2007     Page 5 of 5\n1 Daniel Schaffer, as specified in the Amended Stipulation of Settlement; however, if the amount \n2 allocated for the payment of approved claims of Settlement Class Members is not adequate to pay \n3 all claims without pro-rata reduction, the payment to the Representative Plaintiff shall be reduced \n4 by up to Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) or the amount necessary fully to satisfy all \n5 claims, whichever is less.  The Court finds the amount is fair and adequate in view of the damages \n6 suffered by the Representative Plaintiff and the efforts he expended in litigating this case in the \n7 more than two years from the time the original claim was filed.   \n8 11. Claims  have  been  submitted  and,  in  accordance  with  the  claims  processing \n9 procedure specified in the Amended Stipulation of Settlement, will be reviewed, valued, and paid \n10 by  the  Claims  Administrator  from  funds  provided  by  the  Defendants  as  soon  as  practicable \n11 following the effective date of this Judgment, meaning the date it is entered and becomes final.  \n12 Such Judgment will be deemed final only upon the expiration of the time to appeal or, if a notice \n13 of appeal is filed in this matter, upon exhaustion of all appeals and petitions for writ of certiorari. \n14 12. The Court reserves continuing and exclusive jurisdiction over the parties in this \n15 action, including Defendants and all Settlement Class Members, to administer, supervise, construe \nand enforce the Settlement in accordance with the terms for the mutual benefit of all of the parties. \n16\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the complaint in this \n17\naction be dismissed with prejudice and that judgment be and the same hereby is entered pursuant \n18\nto the terms of this Order. \n19\nDated: November 26, 2007 \n20\n______________________________________                  \n21\nHON.

Your Options as a Class Member.\n1.  Be Bound by, and Participate in the Settlement.\nTo qualify for a payment, you must send in a completed Claim Form to the Claims Administrator. A Claim Form is included in this\nnotice package. You can also get a Claim Form by: (1) calling this toll free number: (877) 446-2122; (2) visiting the website, \nwww.schaffervalamedaco.com; (3) requesting a Claim Form from the offices of Class Counsel at: The Law Office of Mark E. \nMerin, 2001 P Street #100, Sacramento, CA 95814, telephone (916) 443-6911; or (4) writing the Claims Administrator at: \nSchaffer v. County of Alameda Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA \n94976-1110.\nYou have until October 11, 2007, to submit a Claim Form. \nMail your completed Claim Form to: Schaffer v. County of Alameda Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. \nBox 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110.\nIf you need assistance in completing the claim form, feel free to contact class counsel, Mark E. Merin at the Law Office of Mark E. \nMerin, 2001 P Street, Suite 100, Sacramento, CA 95814, (916) 443-6911. \nRemember, if you do not send a Claim Form, you cannot get a payment. Also, please note that Class Members who have already \nsettled their claims with the County of Alameda or gone to trial with the County of Alameda cannot receive a payment under this\nsettlement.  If you submit a Claim Form, you will be bound by the Settlement and receive money (if you are a class member).  If you \ndo not submit a Claim form but did not exclude yourself from the class, you will be bound by the terms of the Settlement and \ndismissal entered in this case, but you will not receive any money. \nBy participating in the Settlement you will be waiving all your rights to all claims up to December 31, 2006, related to strip searches\nby the Alameda County Jails, even those of which you are not aware at present.  This waiver will include a waiver of the provisions of \nCalifornia Civil Code §1542, which provides that “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or\nsuspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement \nwith the debtor.”  By participating, you will be giving up unsuspected claims in the areas covered by the litigation. \n2.  Exclude Yourself From the Class.\nYou do not have to take part in the Settlement or be a member of the class. This is called “excluding” yourself. If you exclude\nyourself, you cannot get a payment and you cannot object to the Settlement.  Any Court orders will not apply to you.  To exclude\nyourself, you must sign a request for exclusion letter that states that you want to be excluded from Schaffer, et al. v. County of \nAlameda, et al., Case No. C 06-0310.  Your exclusion letter must be mailed and postmarked before October 11, 2007 to: Schaffer v. \nCounty of Alameda Strip Search Class Action, c/o Claims Administrator, P.O. Box 1110, Corte Madera, CA 94976-1110. \nIf you do not follow these instructions properly, you will lose your right to exclude yourself.  If you exclude yourself, you cannot get \nany money from the Settlement and you cannot tell the Court you do not like the Settlement (which is called “objecting”).  If you\nexclude yourself, you are no longer part of the class or the Settlement, but you can sue the County of Alameda on your own. \nD.  Fairness Hearing and Process for Objections.\nA fairness hearing will be held on November 16, 2007 at 9:00 a.m., at the United States District Court, Northern District of \nCalifornia, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, Courtroom 7, San Francisco, CA 94102.  If you are a class member and do not exclude \nyourself, you can tell the Court you do not like the Settlement or some part of it at this hearing.  This is called objecting to the \nSettlement.  For example, you can say you do not think the Settlement is fair or adequate.  The Court will consider your views.\nTo object, you must send a letter to the court that contains all of the following: (1) The name and title of the lawsuit, Schaffer, et al. v. \nCounty of Alameda, et al., Case No. C 06-0310 MMC; (2) A statement of each objection you have and the facts that support the \nobjections; (3) A description of any law or case supporting  the objections; (4) A statement on whether or not you or your lawyer will\n                      NOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION STRIP SEARCH CASE         PAGE 3 OF 4 \n\nCase 3:06-cv-00310-MMC     Document 44-2      Filed 06/20/2007     Page 4 of 4\nask to appear at the Fairness Hearing to talk about your objections, and, if so, how long you will need to present your objections; and \n(5) Copies of any documents you or your lawyer will present at the Fairness Hearing. \nIndividually, or through counsel, any class member has the right to object to the proposed Settlement as a whole, to the amount of \nattorneys’ fees and costs of Class Counsel, or to any portion of either.  ANY SUCH OBJECTIONS MUST BE FILED IN WRITING \nON  OR  BEFORE  OCTOBER  11,  2007,  IN  THE  UNITED  STATES  DISTRICT  COURT,  NORTHERN  DISTRICT  OF \nCALIFORNIA LOCATED AT 450 Golden Gate Avenue, 16th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94102, ATTN: CLERK, RE: SCHAFFER V. \nCOUNTY OF ALAMEDA SETTLEMENT, CASE NO.

Said complaint alleged that the COUNTY’s practices related to strip searching pre-\n5 arraignment arrestees at its jail facilities violated said arrestees’ rights guaranteed by the Fourth \n6 Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  and  Article  I,  Section  1  of  the  California \n7 Constitution and were in violation of certain California statutes, including Penal Code section \n8 4030, in two respects: said searches were being performed on arrestees for whom there was no \n9 reasonable  suspicion  that  they  may  be  attempting  to  conceal  contraband  (“ILLEGAL \n10 SEARCHES”), and said searches were being performed on more than one person at the same time \n11 and in the same room (“GROUP SEARCHES”). \n12 The parties entered into discovery which included exchange of documents, preparation of \n13 and responses to request for production of documents, interrogatories and depositions. \n14 Beginning in June 2006 and continuing thereafter through December 31, 2006, COUNTY \n15 issued written and verbal directives and training to employees operating its jail facilities in order to \n16 eliminate  the  challenged  practices  of  conducting  either  ILLEGAL  SEARCHES  and  GROUP \n17 SEARCHES of pre-arraignment arrestees.  \n18 On February 14 and 15, 2007, the Parties participated in mediation sessions presided over \n19 by the Honorable Raul A.

In the event that the total amount owed for claims made by SCMs eligible to receive \n21 payments from the Illegal Search Claim Fund exceeds the amount of that Fund, Administrator will \n22 reduce the amount which each SCM, except those described in Paragraph 46, will receive for each \n23 eligible booking and pre-arraignment ILLEGAL SEARCH, so that the total of all payments does \n24 not exceed the amount of the Illegal Search Claim Fund.  Such reductions shall be made in \n25 accordance with the following formula: (1) The amounts owed to persons eligible for payments \n26 described in Paragraph 46 shall be deducted from the Illegal Search Claim Fund, and the resulting \n27 amount shall be referred to as the “Net Illegal Search Fund;” (2) All persons entitled to a payment \n28 as described in Paragraphs 42 and 44, except those entitled to payments described in Paragraph 46, \n -13- \nAMENDED STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT \nDaniel Schaffer vs. County of Alameda, et al.; USDC-Nor.

All awards to SCMs paid from the Illegal Search Fund shall be subject to deduction \n24 for any Debts Owed as described in Paragraph 10, up to a maximum of Fifty Percent (50%) of the \n25 net recovery after any reduction as provided in Paragraph 58.

Defendant ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF CHARLES C. PLUMMER, in his \n6  Individual and Official Capacity, also maintained or pennitted an official policy or custom of \n7  causing or permitting the OCClUl'enCe of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs \n8  damaged plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged. \n9  8.  Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during lheperiod beginning \n10  two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, an.d continuing to this date, were subjected by \n11  defendants to pre-arraignment strip andl or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, \n12  and recording in writing,  a reasonable  suspicion that the  searches would be productive of \n13  contraband ot weapons, andlor who were strip searched prior to arraigmnent in an area that was \n14  observable by persons not participating in the search. \n15  FACTS \n16  9.  On or about August 13,2005, plaintiff DANIEL SCHAFFER (hereinafter referred \n17  to as \"plaintiff') was arrested allegedly on a traffic warrant and transported to an ALAMEDA \n18  COUNT:!\" Jail where, prior to posting bail, he was dressed-in and taken to an area where he was \n19  forced to submit to a strip search in a group with several other people who were not participating \n20  in the search. \n21  10.  Within six  (6)  months  of the  aforesaid  strip  search,  plaintiff filed  a  group \n22  Government Ton Claim for himself an.d fot all persons similarly situated (a copy of said claim is \n23  attached hereto as Exhibit \"A\", and incorpotated herein to the extent relevant by this reference). \n24  Plaintiffs group claim was rejected on or about September 27,2005, allowing the filing of this \n25  class action complaint on state statute and constitutional violations. \n26  11.  Plaintiff is infonned and believes, and therefore alleges, that defelldants routinely \n27  follow  their policy, practice,  and custom of slibjecting pre-arraignment detajnees, including \n28  plaintiff, and all those he represents, to strip and visual body cavity searches without first having, \nCLASS ACTION COMl'WNT \n\nCase 3:06-cv-00310-MMC     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 5 of 20(cid:10)\n1  and recording in writing, a reasonable suspidon that the search will be productive of contraband \n2  or weapons.  Plaintiff is further informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that defendants \n3  routinely follow their policy, practice, and custom of conducting the complained of searches in the \n4  presence of persons not participating in the searches. \n5  12.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants have the \n6  ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants' \n7  custody, at the ALAMEDA Coumy Jail within two (2) years prior to the filing of this Complaint, \n8  were subjected to strip searches andior visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment without \n9  defendants fITst having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would \n10  be productive of contraband or weapons. \n11  13.  Defendant  ALAMEDA  COUNTY  SHERIFF  CHARLES  C.  PLlJl\\.1:MER  is \n12  personally responsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search polity, practice, \n13  and custom pursuant to which plaintiff, and those he represents, were subjected to strip searches. \n14  14.  As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, plaintiff, \n15  and each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, \n16  invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and state and federal statutory and \n17  constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages according to proof but, at a minimum, \n18  $1,000 as specified in California Penal Code § 4030(P) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil \n19  Code § 52 and § 52.l(b). \n20  CLASS CLAlMS \n21  15,  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiff, and all those similarly \n22  situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants \n23  ALAMEDA  COUNTY SHERIFF  CHARLES  C.  PLUMMER, AL~MEDA COUNTY,  the \n24  individual SHERlFF'S DEPUTlES sued herei.n by the fictitious names 1 through 50, and the \n25  indivi.duals whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names of ROES \n26  1 through 20.  The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of \n27  the alleged offenses for which plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, had been arrested, without \n28  regard to whether or not plaintiff, or those he represents, was eligible for cite and release under \nDANIEL SC:HA.Ff5F~ ;€I  aL v. :truMBOLDT COCNIY, ~t al. \n\nCase 3:06-cv-00310-MMC     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 6 of 20(cid:10)\n1  Penal Code § 853.6, without regard to whether ornotplaintiJf, and each ofthose similarly situated, \n2  was eligible for and/or was released on his or her 0\\\\'11 recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches \n3  complained of herein were performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the \n4  plaintiff, or any of those similarly situated, so searched possessed weapons or contraband, and \n5  those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.  Finally, the \n6  searches complained of herein were performed without defendants taking reasonable precautions \n7  to insure that plaintiff, and each of those similarly si.tuated, was searched in an area affording \n8  privacy and was not observed by others not participating in the search. \n9  16.  Plaintiff brings this action on his 0\\\\'11 behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly \n10  situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n11  17.  The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including \n12  two (2) years prior to the filing ofthis Complaint, and continuing until this matter is adjudicated \n13  and the practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and subj ected to a pre-arraignment \n14  strip and/or visual body cavity search at the ALAMEDA County Jail without defendants first \n15  having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of \n16  contraband or weapons. The class also includes all those persons who were subjected to pre \n17  arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches in the presence of persons who were not \n18  participating in said searches. \n19  18.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of \n20  the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiff does not know the \n21  exact number of class members.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that \n22  there are more than 40 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of \n23  defendants and are subjected to the searches complained ofh erein as a result of defendants' policy, \n24  practice, and custom relating to said searches_ \n25  19.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is \n26  informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact common to the \n27  class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to \n28  visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment whether or not they intend such persons to be \nDANIEL SCHABFER. ~. ~J. . \".

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is \n14  informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions oflaw common to the \n15  class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform strip and/or visual body \n16  cavity searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on \n17  specifi.c or articulable facts, to believe any particular prearraignment detainee has concealed dlUgS, \n18  weapons and/or contraband which would likely be discovered by a strip and/or visual body cavity \n19  search; (2) whether defendants may perfolm strip and/or visual body cavity searches on persons \n20  without first reasonably relating the use of the subject search to defendants' penological interest \n21  to mainta:n the security oft he jail and determining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that \n22  interest; (3) whether strip and/or visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the \n23  search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating plaintiffs' State \n24  and Federal  constitutional rights  and  plaintiffs'  State  statutory rights;  (4)  whether or not \n25  defendants'  strip search policy and procedure is in accordance with the State and/or Federal \n26  ConstitutlOn; (5) whether or not defendants' policy and procedure of conducting pre~arraignment \n27  strip searches in groups violates plaintiffs' State and/or Federal Constitutional rights to privacy; \n28  (6) whether or not plaintiffs' claims under Penal Code § 4030 are barred by the provisions of \nP:;so' of14 \nlJS))C, Nol'1\\)~ .1)iot,('\\ct, C\\\\S¢ No. \ncuss Amo~ COMl\"1A.t:NT \n\nCase 3:06-cv-00310-MMC     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 8 of 20(cid:10)\n1  Government Code § 844.6; and, (7) whether or not defendants have an immunity defense to \n2  plaintiffs' claims under Civil Code §§  52 and 52.1, and whether or not those claims are actionable \n3  in a class action. \n4  21.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the \n5  representative plaintiffis typical of the class. Plaintiff was searched, prior to arraignment, without \n6  reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs, weapons o[ \n7  contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in a superviso[\" \n8  approved writing).  Representative plaintiff has the same interests and suffered the same type of \n9  injuries as  all of the class members.  Plaintiffs claims arose because of defendants' policy, \n10  practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity searches before \n11  3naignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion tbat the search would \n12  be productive of contraband or weapons.  Each class member suffered actual damages as a result \n13  ofbeing subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search. The actual damages suffered by the \n14  representative plaintiff is similar in type and amount to tbe actual damages suffered by each class \n15  member. \n16  In accordan.eewith Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative \n17  plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffs interests are consistent \n18  with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class. \n19  23.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(1)(A), \n20  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that \n21  inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would \n22  establish incompatible standards of con.duct for the parties opposing the complaint. \n23  24.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(I)(B), \n24  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of \n25  inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a \n26  practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to \n27  protect their interests. \n28  \\\\\\ \n\nCase 3:06-cv-00310-MMC     Document 1     Filed 01/17/2006     Page 9 of 20(cid:10)\n25.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiff is \n2  infonned and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants have acted on grounds generally \n3  applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the tinal injunctive or declaratory relief with \n4  respect to the class as a whole. \n5  26.  In accordance with Federal Rules ofC  ivil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action \n6  is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy \n7  between the parties.  Plaintiff is infoillIed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the interests \n8  of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in \n9  that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all. Plaintiff also \n10  is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so \n11  small that separate suits would be impracticable. Plaintiffis informed and believes, and thereupon \n12  alleges, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to representthem. Plaintiff \n13  is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in \n14  one forum because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., the iu,MfEDA County Jail. \n15  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions oflaw and fact in one forum, \n16  rather than in multiple courts. \n17  27.  Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff is \n18  informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the identities of the class members may be \n19  ascertained from records maintained by the ALAMEDA COUNTY and defeudant SHERIFF \n20  CHARLES C. PLUMMER and the defendants' Sheriff's Department.  Plaint)tI is informed and \nbelieves, and thereupon alleges, that defendants' records reflect the identities, including addresses \n21 \n22  and telephone numbers, oftile persons who have been held in custody in the ALAMEDA County \n23  Jails. Plaintiffis informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that records of, and maintained by \n24  defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visua1 body cavity search, when the search \n25  OCCUlTed, where the search occuned, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and \n26  was recorded in a supervisor-approved writing, whether the search was conducted in a group, when \npersons searched were arraigned, and the charges on which such persons were an-ested.  Plaintiff \n27 \nis informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that all of the foregoing information is contained \n28 \nDA.~1BL SCHA.\"'FEF.., ot 41. v.

In accordance with Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(c)(2)(b), class \n5  members must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including \n6  individual notice to all members who can be identified tlrrough reasonable effort.  Plaintiff is \n7  informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants' computer records contain a last \n8  known address for class members.  Plaintiff contemplates that individual notice will be given to \n9  class members at such last known address by first class mail. Plaintiff contemplates that the notice \n10  will inform class members ofthe following: \n11  i.  The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class; \n12  Ii  The nature of the action; \n13  iii  Their right to \"opt out\" of the action within a given time, in which event \n14  they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \n15  iv.
