    "summary": "<p>On February 8, 2005, private attorney Mark E. Merin filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the  U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenging the policies, practices, and customs concerning the use of strip searches and visual body cavity searches in the Humboldt County Jail.  The named plaintiff, who was a female citizen arrested for a DWI, alleged that she was forced to strip naked, such that she was nude from the waist up in the presence of male officers not involved in her search.  The search was videotaped.  Plaintiff alleged that her treatment was the result of the official Humboldt County Jail policy, in which officers routinely subjected detainees in their custody to strip and visual body cavity searches before they were arraigned and without having any reasonable suspicion that the detainees possessed contraband or weapons, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and California state law.  Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages and class certification.</p><p>After the parties engaged in discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment.  The District Court (Saundra Brown Armstrong) found that plaintiff failed to present any evidence of similar complaints, which negated that a custom or practice of improper searches existed at the Jail.  As such, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the County of Humboldt and its Sheriff on plaintiff's municipal liability claim.  Spellman v. Humboldt County, 2006 WL 1626922 (N.D.Cal. Jun 09, 2006) Plaintiff appealed.  </p><p>While the case was on appeal, plaintiff refiled the case, individually naming the deputy sheriff that conducted the strip search as a defendant.  That new case, which was filed on June 27, 2006, had the new case number 3:06-cv-03956-MHP and was assigned to District Judge Marilyn H. Patel.  </p><p>About three months later, the parties settled the matter.  They filed a joint memorandum of voluntarily dismissal dated October 16, 2006, advising the Court that the parties mutually resolved their differences.  Plaintiff also voluntarily dismissed the appeal of the 2005 case.  The terms of the settlement were not made part of the Court record.</p><p></p>",

Plaintiff seeks an award of general and\n25 punitive damages to compensate her for the unreasonable search.  \n26 Defendant’s search violated those rights of plaintiff that are secured by the Fourth and\n27 Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and entitle plaintiff to recover damages\n28 under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 1983).  \nPage 1 of 7\nELIN SPELLMAN. v.

Jurisdiction is founded upon 28 USC\n12 §§ 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.  \n13 1. Under 28 USC § 1367(a) the Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state\n14 claims alleged herein.\n15 2. The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs.\n16 PARTIES\n17 3. Plaintiff ELIN SPELLMAN is, and at all material times herein, was a citizen of the\n18 United States and a resident of the state of California who was arrested on or about September 23,\n19 2005, taken to the Humboldt County Jail and required by defendant GOLDSMITH to remove her\n20 clothes so as to expose her breasts in an area which was observed by male law enforcement\n21 personnel.  Plaintiff was required to expose her breasts prior to being arraigned and without the\n22 defendant first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be\n23 productive of contraband or weapons.\n24 4. Defendant HUMBOLDT COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTY ANNE GOLDSMITH is,\n25\nand at all material times referred to herein, was a deputy for the Humboldt County Sheriff’s\n26\nDepartment, who, as part of her duties at the Humboldt County Jail, subjected plaintiff to the\n27\ncomplained of pre-arraignment strip search in an area which was observed by male officers and\n28\n\\\\\\\nPage 2 of 7\nELIN SPELLMAN. v.

Defendant HUMBOLDT COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT together with\n4 defendant COUNTY OF HUMBOLDT were the employers of defendant GOLDSMITH.\n5 6. At all material times mentioned herein, defendant was acting under the color of law,\n6 to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages of the state\n7 of California, Humboldt County, and/or the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Department.\n8 FACTS\n9 7. On or about September 23, 2004, plaintiff ELIN SPELLMAN (hereinafter referred\n10 to as “plaintiff”) was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol.  Plaintiff was\n11 taken to the Humboldt County Jail in Eureka, California, where defendant GOLDSMITH coerced,\n12 forced, and compelled her to disrobe so that she was naked from the waist up in the presence of\n13 persons who were not participating in the search and who were of the opposite sex.\n14 8. Within six (6) months of the aforesaid strip search, plaintiff filed a group\n15 Government Tort Claim for herself and for all persons similarly situated (a copy of said claim is\n16 attached hereto as Exhibit “A”, and incorporated herein to the extent relevant by this reference).\n17 Plaintiff’s group claim was denied on or about January 10, 2005, and she thereafter filed a class\n18 action complaint against defendant’s employer and various unnamed Sheriff Deputy defendants\n19 (Spellman et al v. County of Humboldt et al. United States District Court for the Northern District\n20 of California Case No. 05-00568-SBA).  Plaintiff learned of the identity of the deputy who\n21 performed the complained of strip search in January, 2006, and sought to amend her class\n22 complaint to include said deputy (defendant GOLDSMITH) in her class action.  Plaintiff’s motion\n23 to amend was denied and she now brings this individual action against defendant GOLDSMITH\n24 and her employer at the relevant time the HUMBOLDT COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT\n25\nand HUMBOLDT COUNTY.\n26\n9. As a result of being subjected to the search complained of herein, plaintiff suffered\n27\nphysical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law\n28\nand state and federal statutory and constitutional rights, and is entitled to recover damages\nPage 3 of 7\nELIN SPELLMAN. v.

Furthermore, the search complained of herein was performed without defendant\n8 having a reasonable belief that the plaintiff possessed weapons or contraband and without first\n9 articulating and recording in a supervisor-approved document any individualized reasonable\n10 suspicion  that  the  search  would  reveal  weapons  or  contraband.    Additionally,  the  search\n11 complained of herein was performed without defendant taking reasonable precautions to make\n12 certain that plaintiff was not observed by others not involved in the search and/or by members of\n13 the opposite sex\n14 COUNT ONE\n(Violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution )\n15\n16 11.

Class action plaintiffs axe those similarly situated who, during the period begi~.ing two\n(2) years befor¢ th¢ filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this dat~, were subjected by defendmats\n16 to pre-arraignment s~p and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, and recording\n17 in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of contraband or weapor~.\n18\n19 FACTS\n20 l 1. On or about September 23, 2004, plaintiffEI~ SPELLMAN (hereinafter referred to as\n\"plaintiff’) was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol. Plaintiff was taken to the\n22 HUMBOLDT County Jail in Eureka, Califomia, where she was coom~¢~, forty’i, anal compelled to\n23 disrobe so that she was naked from the waist up in the presence of persons who were not participathlg\nin the search and who were of the opposite sex.\n12. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that she, like all those she\n26 represents, was videotaped during the complained of search, and that the videotaping of those\nACTION COM~L~.\n\n1 subjected to the complained of searehos is a component of the defend.ant~’ strip/visual body cavity\nsearch policy, e~tom, and practice.\n3 13. Within six (6) months of the aforesaid strip search, plaintiff filed a group Goverm’nent\n4 Tort Claim for herself and for all persons similarly ~ituated (a copy of said claim is attached hereto as\nExhibit \"A\", and incorporated, herein to the extent relevant by this reference). Plaintiff s group claim\nwas denied on or about January 10, 2005, ~llowing the filing oft_his class action ccrmplaint on state\n? statute ~d constitutional violations.\n8 14. PIainfiffis informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that defendants routinely\n9 follow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraigrmaent detainees, including plalr~fiff,\n10 ~d nil those she represents, to strip and visual body cavity searches without first having, aud recordix~g\n1t in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search will be productive of coztrabmad or weapons.\n12 Plair~tiff is further informed and believes, a~d therefore alleges, that defendants routinely follow their\n13 policy, practice, mud custom of videotaping the complained of searches.\n14 15. Plair~tiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants have the abilitY\nto identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendants’ custody, at\n16 the HUMBOLDTCounty Jail within two (2) years prior to the filing of this Complaint, were subjected\nto strip se~rehe~ and/or visual body cavity searehe~ prior to arraignment without defenda,n, ts having.\n18 first, and recordilag, a reasor~able s~spicion tl~t the searches would be productive of contraband or\n19 weapons.\n2O 16. Defendant HIrMBOLDT COUNTY SHEI~F GARY PNTILP is personally responsible\nfor the pr0mulg~tion and continuation of the strip ~earch policy, pr~tice, ~d custom p~trsuan~ to\n22 which plaintiff, and tlaose she represents, were subjected.\n23 17. As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, plaintiff, and\n24 each oft_he persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental~ and emotional d~stres~, invasion of\n25 privacy, and violation of due proces~ of law and ~tate and federal ~tatutory and constitutional fights,\n215\n\n1 . and is entitled to recover damages according to proof but, at a minimum, $1,000 as specified in\n2 California Penal Code § 4030(p) and $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code § 52 and § 52.1(b),\n3 ~CLA$S CLAIMS\n4 18.

The zearehe~ complained of herein were performed\n10 without regard to the nature of the alleged offense for which piaintiff, and all those similarly si.tuated,\nI1 had been arrested, without regard to whether or not plaintiff, or those she represents, was eligible for\n12 cite and release under PenaI Code § 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiff, and eae2a oftho~e\n13 similarly situated, was eligible for and/or was released on his or her own recognizance. Furthermore,\n14 the searches complained of herein were perforr~ed without defendants having a reasonable belief that\n15 the plaintiff, or any of those similarly situated, so searched possessed weapons or contraband, anal\n16 those facts being articulated and recorded in .a sapervi~or:approved document. And the\nI7 complained of herein were performed without defendants taking reasonable precautions to make\n18 certain that plaintiff, and each of those similarIy situated, was not observed by others not involved in\n19 the search and/or of the opposite ~ex, Additionally, plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon\n20 alleges, that a conaponent of the searches complained of herein was defendants’ videotaping of the\n21 plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated.\n22 19. Plaintiff brings this action on her own behalf and on behalf of all persons simil~-ly\n23 situated pursuant ~o Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n20.    The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including two (2)\n25 years prior to the filing of this Complaint, and continuing uatil thi~ matter i$ adjudicated and the\n26 practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and ~tlbjected to a pre-arraigtmaent strip and/or\nEIA’N ~i~’l~ka’vlAN, ~ ~1, v, I-U.rb~OLDT COI.TIY’I’Y, (cid:128)1 USIPC, Ne~l~-n Dlg~ C~(cid:128) ~.\n\nvisual body cavity search a~ the HLrMBOLDT County lail without defer~dants first having, and\n.recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the ~eareh would be prodnetive of contrab~d or\n3 weapons.\n4 21. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of the\n5 class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical. Plaintiff does not know the exact\n6 number of class members. Plaintiffis informed and believes, and thereuport alleges, that there’are\n7 morn than 10 persons per day who are ~gted by defmdant~ ~m~or in ~e cu.~to~y ofdefendar~t, and\n8 are subjected to the ~earches complained of herein as a result of defendants’ policy, practice, and\n9 custom relating to said searches.\n10,\n22.    N accordance with Federal Rule~ of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is ir~forraed\nii and believes, and thereupon allege~, that there are many questions of fact common to the class\n12 including, but ~aot limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to visual\n13 body ~avity searches prior to arraignment if they irtt~d such persons to be housed in tah_¢ HUMBOLDT\n14 County lail; (2) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual body cavity searches prior to\n15 arraignment without there being any reasonable Suspicion, based on specific or arficulable facts, to\n16 believe any particular arre~tee has conceNed dNgs, weapor~, and/or contraband i~ b0d~ly cavities\n17 which could be detected by means of a strip and/or visual body cavity search; (3) whether the strip\n18 and/or visual body cavity searches arc conducted in an area of privacy so that the $earche~ cannot be\n19 observecl by persons r~ot participating i~ the searches; (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity\n20 ¯ searclae~ are videotaped and whether and under what circum~tance~ said videotapes are ~ub~equen~iy\n21 viewed; and, (5) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searche~ are rea.*onably related to\ndefendants’ penological interest to maintain the security of the jaiI and whether or r~ot there are less\n23 intrusive methods for protecting any such interegt.\n24 23.    In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plainti.ffis informed\n25 and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are m~y questions of law common to the cla~s\n26 including, but are not Iimitcd to: (1) whether defendants may perform strip a~d/or visual body cavity\nF..LIN $1~F.2.J_/~I~. e~ al, v, I41./M~OLDT CO~rrg~ ~t N,\n\nsearches on persons prior to their ~’r~ignment without reasonable suspicion, based on specific or\n2 a~dculable f~ts, to believe my particul~ prearraig~ment d~nee h~ ¢o~oealed ~gs, weapo~\n~or eon~ab~d which would likely be ~scov~ed by a s~p ~ffor ~su~ body caviW se~eh; (2)\nwhe~ defen~ts may perfo~ s~p ~or visu~ body oavi~ sc~h~s on p~sons wi~out ~s~\nmaso~bly relating ~e use of~¢ subject se~ch to d~f~s’ penological int~es~ to m~t~ ~e\nsec~ of~e j~l ~d dct~i~ng if~e is a less ~n~ive me~od to protect ~at ~t~e~t; (3)\nwh¢~ s~p an~or visuA body cavity ~e~hes may be conducted m ~¢as where ~e se~ch cm be\nobse~ed by people not,p~icipafing in the sc~ch without viola~g pl~Nffs’ Stat~ md FM~al\n9 consfimtion~ rights ~d pl~fiffs’ State statum~ fi~ts; (4) whe~er or not defenders’ s~p ~e~ch\npolioy ~d proscribe i~ ~n accordm¢~ wi~ ~h¢ State m~or Fed~ Constitution; (5) whe~er or not\n11 defending’ policy md proced~e of videotap~g ~osc subjected to ~e compla~ed of se~ches ~olates\n12 pin,tiffs’ State ~ot Federal Co~fitufional fi~t~ to p~v~y; (6) whe~ or ~ot pl~utiff~’ clams\n13 ~d~ Penal Code ~ 4030 ~c bm~d by ~(cid:128) pro~sions of Gov~en~ Code ~ 8~.6; rod, (7) wke~\nor not defendmts have ~ i~W defense to pI~ntiffs’ cIhm~ ~d~ Civil Code ~ 52 md 52.1, md\nwhe~er or not ~ose c!~ms ~e actionabl~ [u a cl~s action.\n16 2~. ~ accord~ce wi~ Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), th~ claims of the\nr~se~tative pl~ntiffis t~ical of the clas~.

In ac¢ord0mce with Federal Rule~ of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n2 plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests. Plaintiff s interests are consistent with\n3 and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.\n4 26. in accordance Mth Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), prosccutiom of\n5 separate actio~as by individual members of the class would create a risk that inconsistent or varying\n6 adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would establish incompatible standards\n7 of conduct for the pm’t’tes opposing the compl~nt.\n8 27. N accordance with Federal Rules of CiviI Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), prosecutions of\n9 separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk ofinconsi,~tent adjudications\n10 with respcc~ to individual members of the class which would, a~ a p~actical matter, substantially irapair\nII or impede the interests of the other members of the class to protect their interests.\n12 28. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiff is\n13 kuformed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants have acted on grotmds.generally\n14 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injtm.ctive or declaratoryrelief with\n15 respect to the class as a whole.\n16 29. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule\" 23Co)(3), this class action is.\n17 superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy between\n18 the parties. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the interests of members of\n19 the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in. that most class\n20 members would be unable individually to prosecute arty action at all. Plaintiff also is informed ~d .\n21 believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small that separate\n22 suits would be impracticable. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges; that most\n23 members of the class will not be abIe to find cotmsel to represent them. Plaintiff is infor~aed and\n24 believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in one forum because all\n25 of the claims m’ise in the same location; i.e., theHUMBOLDT County Jail. It will prornote judicial\n26\n\n1 efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather th~ in multiple\n2 co~s,\n3 30.. Plaintiff does not know the ider~tities 0fall of the class members. Plaintiffis.~formed\nand beIieves, and thereupon alleges, tb_at the identities of the cla~s members may be ascertained from\n5 records maintai~aed by the HUMBOLDT COUNTY and defendartt SHERIFF GARY PI-I]LP and\n6 defendant HUMBOLDT COUNTY SFIER_WF’S DEPARTMENT. Plaintiffis informed and believes,\n7 and thereupor~ alleges, that defendants’ records reflect ~e identities, inctud~g addresses and tel~hone\n8 nmnbers, of the persons who have been held in custody in the HLrMBOLDT Cotmty Jails. Plaintiff is\n9 reformed and believes, add thereupon alleges, that records of, and maintained by defendants reflect\n10 who wa~ subject to a strip and/or vi$ual body cavity search, when ~e search occurred, where the\n11 search occam’ed, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and was recorded in a\n12 supervisor-approved writing, whet~er the search was videotaped, when persons searched were\n13 arraigned, and the charges on wb.i~h ~a,h persons were arrested. Plaintiff is iafo~ed and believes,\n14 and tlaereapon alleges, that all of~e foregoing information is contained in defendants’ computer\n15 system and that the information necessary to identify the class members, by last known addresses, and\n16 the dates and reasor~s for their arrests and/or release from custody, is readily available from said\n17 computer System.\n18 3 I. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(e)(2)(b), class members\n19 mu~t be Nmished with the best notice practicable artder the circt~.m~t~ces, includizg individual notice\n20 to all memb~ who can be idetatified through re~o~a~ble effort.
