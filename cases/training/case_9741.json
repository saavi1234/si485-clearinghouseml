    "summary": "<p>In 2001, private attorneys representing individual plaintiffs filed several civil rights lawsuits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.  The cases challenged allegedly improper strip searches and unsanitary and inhumane conditions of confinement at the Brooklyn Central Booking facility.  Plaintiffs alleged that police had a blanket policy of strip searching all individuals who entered the Brooklyn Central Booking facility, regardless of the crime for which they were charged and without reasonable suspicion to believe that the individuals were concealing weapons or contraband.  After being strip searched, detainees were allegedly placed in filthy, disease-ridden, and overcrowded jail cells.  Plaintiffs asserted that the policy and conditions violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, and class certification for the thousands of individuals that suffered the same alleged indignities.  Defendants answered by generally denying the allegations.</p><p>The lawsuits, which involved over 20 plaintiffs, were consolidated under the lead case, Spinner v. City of New York.</p><p>On October 6, 2003, the District Court (Senior District Judge Charles P. Sifton) certified the case as a class action, with the class defined as all persons since 1998 who (1) were charged with misdemeanor or non-criminal offenses in Kings County, (2) then were detained at the Brooklyn Central Booking, and (3) while detained, were subjected to strip searches without regard to the existence of probable cause or reasonable suspicion that the detainees possessed weapons or contraband.  Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction was denied.  Plaintiffs subsequently withdrew their claims for injunctive relief and the Court issued an order decertifying the class on the injunctive relief claims.</p><p>Discovery and motion practice ensued, until the parties eventually reached a settlement of the case.  Under the settlement, the City agreed to pay approximately $654,000 to settle claims of the 20 remaining plaintiffs.   Approximately $323,000 of the total amount would be divided among the 20 plaintiffs (in varying amounts, ranging from approximately $12,250 to $21,500) and the remaining $331,000 would be award to plaintiffs' attorneys as fees.  The District Court (Magistrate Judge Cheryl L. Pollak) approved the settlement on June 4, 2004.</p><p>We have no information showing post-settlement activity in the case.</p><p></p>",

Currentl.y before  this Court \nis defendant's  objection  to  the  January  28,  2003  order  (\"January \n28th  Order\")  of Magistrate  Judge  Pol.l.ak  that denied defendants \nmotion  to  disqual.ify pl.aintiffs'  counsel.  Richard Cardinal.e \n(\"Cardinal.e\")  and Michael.  Hueston  (\"Hueston\")  (col.l.ectivel.y, \n\"pl.aintiffs'  counsel.\"). \nBACKGROUND \nThe  fol.l.owing  facts  are drawn  from  the  submissions  of \nthe parties and are  undisputed unl.ess  otherwise  noted.  I  recite \nonl.y  those  facts  necessary  to  decide  the present motion. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 2 of 25\n- 2  -\nPlaintiffs'  counsel  were  formerly  employed by  defendant \nas Assistant Corporation  Counsels  (\"ACC\"'s)  in  the  Special \nFederal  Litigation Division  (\"SFLD\")  of  the New  York  City Law \nDepartment.  The  SFLD  represents  defendant  and  its officials in \ncivil rights  cases brought  in federal  court involving  allegations \nof police,  District Attorney,  or correction officer misconduct. \nBetween  June  1999  and until  the  case  was  settled on  February  9, \n2001,  Hueston  represented defendant  in Kellner v.  City or New \nYork,  an  individual  action brought by  a  felony  arrestee who \nalleged that he  was  unconstitutionally  strip searched at \nManhattan  Central Booking by DOC  officers on  January  3,  1997,  in \naccordance  with  a  written Department of Corrections  (\"DOC\") \npolicy.  During  the  time  that Kellner was  pending,  Norma  Kerlin \n(\"Kerlin\")  an ACC  in  the  SFLD  also was  representing defendant  in \nTyson  v.  City or New  York,  a  class  action brought on  behalf  of \nall persons  who  had been  or would be  arrested for misdemeanor  or \nnon-criminal  offenses  in New  York  and Queens  Counties  and  then \nwere  or would be  strip searched pursuant  to City,  DOC,  and New \nYork  City Police Department  (\"NYPD\")  policy,  practice,  or  custom. \nHueston  did not represent defendant  or participate  substantially \nin  Tyson. \nOn  May  2,  2001,  plaintiffs filed a  complaint  in  this \nCourt  challenging  the  constitutionality of  the NYPD's  unwritten \npolicy of strip searching misdemeanor  arrestees  at BCB.  The  case \nwas  subsequently referred to Magistrate  Judge  Pollak  for pretrial \npreparation. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 3 of 25\n- 3  -\nOn  February  8,  2002,  defendants  moved  to disqualify \nplaintiffs'  counsel because  of  a  conflict of  interest stemming \nfrom  Hueston's  alleged exposure  to privileged and  confidential \ninformation  regarding  strip-search practices while  employed by \nthe  SFLD.!/  Specifically,  defendant alleged that Hueston  had \nobtained confidential  and privileged information  gathered in \npreparation for  its defense  in  TYson because  Hueston  initially \nbelieved that plaintiff in  was  an  \"opt-out\" member  of  the \nKe~~ner \nTYson  class.  Hueston,  through  an  unsworn  declaration,  initially \ndenied these  allegations  and maintained that he  never  spoke  to \nany  DOC  or NYPD  officials regarding  the  strip-search policy for \nmisdemeanor  arrestees because  such policies were  irrelevant to \nhis  defense  in Ke~~ne~/,  that he  never  received any  privileged \nmaterials  or  information  relating to  strip searches,  and  that he \nnever  spoke  to  Kerlin  regarding  either  TYson  or  Based \nKe~~ner. \non  Hueston's  declaration and defendant's  failure  to present any \nevidence beyond  its conjecture  that Hueston  was  probably exposed \nto privileged and  confidential materials  related to  TYson, \nMagistrate  Judge  Pollak denied defendant's motion  for \ndisqualification in an  order dated May  20,  2002  (\"May  20th \nOrder\") . \n11  Defendants  concede  that Cardinale did not personally or  substantially \nparticipate in either the Manhattan  or Queens  strip-search cases  and,  thus,  seek \nto disqualify Cardinale on  the basis of his partnership with Hueston. \ny \nIt is undisputed that strip searches  of persons  charged with felony \noffenses are governed by different considerations  than  those  that govern  strip \nsearches  following a  misdemeanor  arrest. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 4 of 25\n- 4  -\nThereafter,  in a  subsequent notice of motion  dated  June \n10,  2002,  defendants  filed objections  to  the May  20ili  Order  with \nthis  Court.  On  June  28,  2002,  while  these motions  were  pending \nbefore  this  Court,  defendants,  following  a  telephone  conference \nwith Magistrate  Judge  Pollak,  agreed to  withdraw  their objections \nand  sought  reconsideration by Magistrate  Judge  Pollak pursuant  to \nRule  60(b)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure  of  the May \n20th  Order  in light of  \"newly discovered evidence.\" \nDefendant's  newly  discovered evidence  consisted of  the \nKellner case  file,  which  had been misplaced following  the  events \nof  September  11,  2001,  after which  the  SFLD  was  abruptly \nrelocated from  its offices  at 100  Church  Street.  Defendants \nalleged  that  the  contents  of  the  case  file  contradicted some  of \nthe  assertions  that Hueston  had made  in his  unsworn \ndeclarations .JI \nFirst,  defendant  alleged that contrary  to Hueston's \nunsworn  assertions,  he  had  in  fact  litigated Kellner as  a \n~son \nopt-out case  from  June  1999  to  February  2000.  To  support  this \nallegation defendant offered two  settlement abstracts prepared by \nHueston  on  January  20  and February  3,  2000.il  In  the  January  20th \nabstract,  Hueston  states  that \"plaintiff's name  is not  a  Tyson \nclass member  ...  [and  that h]e has  opted out of  the  class.\" \nDefendant has  provided Magistrate Judge  Pollak and  this Court with \nunredacted copies  of the Ke~~ner case file for  in camera  review. \nif  The  February 3rd  abstract suggests  that by  this date Hueston  knew  that \nKellner was  not an  opt-out member  of the  ~son class.  In  it he writes  that  the \ncase  should be  settled for  the  \"nuisance value\"  or  $17,500 because  \"plaintiff was \nstrip-searched while still charged with a  felony,  which  is lawful.\" \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 5 of 25\n- 5  -\nHueston  further  states  that,  \"[a]ccording to DOC  arrest records, \nthere  is nothing  to  suggest  that DOC  would have  a  basis  to \nconduct  a  strip search  [on  plaintiff].\"  Hueston  also  surmised \nthat a  claim  that plaintiff was  not  stripped searched would \nlikely be  unsuccessful  at trial because  \"it runs  contrary to  our \nconcession  in  TYson,  and  it seems  to me  that we  would  want  to \nmaintain  consistent positions.\" \nSecond,  defendant challenged Hueston's  assertion  that \nhe  never  spoke  to Kerlin  about  that case  or Kellner.  To \nestablish this  claim defendant  offered e-mails  exchanged between \nKerlin  and Hueston  wherein  Hueston  asked  to discuss  Kellner \nfurther by  telephone  and  inquired into  settlement figures  for \nTyson  claimants.  Defendant also pointed  to  the  above-mentioned \nsettlement abstracts  in which  Hueston  indicated that he  had \nspoken  to Kerlin  regarding an  appropriated settlement  in Kellner, \nas  well  as  supervisors'  notes  on  memoranda  assigning Kellner to \nHueston,  directing him  to  talk  to Kerlin  and  to  attend a  meeting \nshe  led concerning  strip-search cases.Y \nThird,  defendant attempted to discredit Hueston's \nstatement  that  the  only  documents  he  had requested during his \ninvolvement with Kellner were  those pertaining to Kellner's \narrest.  Defendant offered formatted  requests  for materials \nHueston does not now  dispute  that he attended such a  meeting,  but he \nmaintains  that  the meeting was  \"l.ike every Law  Department meeting  in that it \ninvolved a  discussion of substantive law\"  and  that \"at no point during  the \nmeeting were  confidential attorney-client communications  discussed.\"  Defendant \ndoes  not argue  that any attorney-client communications  were discussed at this \nmeeting. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 6 of 25\n- 6  -\naddressed  to  the paralegal unit of the  SFLD,  which  were  signed by \nHueston  and detailed his  requests  for prisoner  rosters,  command \nlogs,  central booking  logs,  patrol guide provisions,  and a  copy \nand all drafts  of DOC  Institutional Order  DD  11.16.0,  a  directive \ndrafted by Manhattan  Central  Booking warden  Alonzo  Davis \n(\"Davis,,).ยงJ  Defendant  alleged  that these  documents  further \nindicated that Hueston  had  treated  as  a  opt-out \nKe~~ner  ~son \ncase. \nFourth,  defendant  offered documents  from  the \nKe~~ner \nfile  indicating  that Hueston  had  scheduled a  \"follow-up\" \nappointment with Davis  on  a  date between  October  4  and October  8, \n1999,  and  that Hueston  had met  with  an  unnamed  client on  October \n7,  1999.  Defendant also offered a  declaration by Davis  stating \nthat he  had visited the Law  Department  in or about  the  fall  or \nspring of  1999  and  that he  had met with  a  \"male black attorney\" \nwhose  name  he  could not  recall.  Defendant alleged  that these \ndocuments  contradicted Hueston's  claim  that his  only  contact with \nDavis  had been  a  \"fifteen second\"  phone  conversation.  Defendant \nalso pointed to documents  reflecting that on  February  2,  2002, \nHueston met with both  Police Officers Bellomo  and Colluso,  the \narresting officers  in  this  contradicted Hueston's \nKe~~ner; \nprevious  claim  that he  had only met  with  Bellomo. \nFifth,  defendant  attempted  to  contradict Hueston's \nstatement  that he  had never  represented New  York  City  Police \nCommissioner  Howard  Safir,  by  offering a  letter written by \nThis  document was  at the center of the  ~son litigation. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 7 of 25\n- 7  -\nHueston  to  the  Honorable  Kirnba  Wood  in which  Hueston  stated that \nhe  represented both  the  City of New  York  and  Commissioner  Safir \nin  Other  documents  showed  that Hueston  had been \nKe~~ner. \nassigned  on  June  8,  1999,  and  that Safir had not been \nKe~~ner \neliminated as  a  defendant  in  the  case until  July  8,  1999. \nFinally,  defendant alleged that Hueston  had \nmisrepresented  the  extent of his  involvement  in  the  settlement of \nDefendant  offered a  letter written by  Stephen Weiner \nKe~~ner. \n(\"Weiner\"),  plaintiff's counsel  in  and  addressed  to \nKe~~ner, \nHueston  regarding  settlement of  that case;  Weiner's  telephone \nrecords  showing  that Weiner  called Hueston  on  December  13,  1999; \nand  a  letter from Weiner  to Muriel  Goode  Trufante,  an  SFLD \nemployee,  expressing his  appreciation  for  her processing \nsettlement papers  to permit payment  of  $10,000  to Kellner. \nDefendant  alleged  that these documents  belied Hueston's  claim \nthat his  involvement  in  the  settlement negotiations  did not \nextend beyond  offering a  $3,001  offer of  judgment. \nIn  response  to  this  newly  discovered evidence, \nMagistrate  Judge  Pollak placed Hueston  under  oath  on  September  6 \nand  20,  2002.  On  both  these  occasions  Hueston was  cross-examined \nby  defense  counsel.  While  under  oath  Hueston  admitted  that \ncertain of his  statements  had been  inaccurate and  that his \nrecollection has  been  refreshed by  the  newly  discovered \nKe~~ner \nfile.  In particular he  stated that his  recollections  of \nsettlement discussions  was  \"faulty\";  that he  could not be  certain \nthat he  had  only  interviewed Police Officer Bellomo  on  February \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 8 of 25\n- 8  -\n2,  2002;  that he  had  in fact  exchanged e-mails  with Kerlin but \nthat he  had  received no  substantive  or  confidential  information \nfrom  her;  and  that between  June  and December  1999  or  January \n2000,  while  he  was  waiting for  information  in response  to \ndiscovery  requests,  there was  a  certain period of  time  where  he \nmay  have  believed that  was  a  TYson  opt-out case. \nKe~~ner \nIn  the  January  28ili  Order,  Magistrate  Judge  Pollak \ncredited Hueston's  representations  to  the  Court  in their entirety \nbased on  her  observation of his  testimony and demeanor  on  direct \nand  cross-examination.  While  the  court noted that  the  newly \ndiscovered evidence  contradicted some  of  Hueston's  previous \nstatements,  it held that Hueston's  representations  were  not \ndeliberately misleading and  that the  newly  discovered evidence \nwas  not  legally sufficient to warrant disqualification  in  this \ninstance. \nOn  February  13,  2003,  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยง  636(b) (1) \nand Rule  72(a)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  defendant \nfiled objections  to  the  January  28th  Order  with  this  Court.  On \nFebruary  18,  2003,  plaintiff's counsel  filed papers  opposing  that \nmotion. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 9 of 25\n- 9  -\nDISCUSSION \nUnder  28  U.S.C.  ยง  636(b) (1)  and Rule  72 (a)ll  of  the \nFederal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  a  district court may  overturn a \nmagistrate's  order on  a  non-dispositive matter when  such  order  is \n\"found  to be  clearly erroneous  or contrary  to  law.\"  See  also \nEuropean  Community v.

In  determining whether  a  matter  is substantially related \nto  one  which  was  previously litigated by  counsel,  the  Second \nCircuit has  held that the most  important  consideration  is  \"not \nwhether  the  two  actions  rely for  their foundation  upon  the  same \nsection  of  law,  but whether  the  facts  necessary  to  support  the \ntwo  claims  are  sufficiently similar.\"  Motors  Corp.  v. \nGenera~ \nCity of New  York,  501.

This  rule  has \nit basis  in policy considerations  noted in United  States  v. \nEscobar,  910  F.

In  interpreting these precedents  and \npolicy considerations  district courts  have,  in general,  only \ngranted disqualification motions  where  the  facts  giving rise to \nan  issue  that is material  in both  the  former  and present \nlitigations are  the  same  and must  necessarily be  considered in \norder  to  reach  a  decision  in  the present  litigation.

Thus,  because  the  factual \ncircumstances  that gave  rise  to  the  constitutional  claims  were \ndifferent,  Magistrate  Judge  Pollak found  that the material  facts \ngiving  rise  to  the Manhattan  and Queens  litigations would  not be \nnecessary  in order  for plaintiffs  to  establish  their claims  in \nthe present  litigation.

Based on  these  assertions,  defendant  argues \nthat both  the  facts  and  issues  required to prove  a  constitutional \nviolation both  in  the past and present cases  are  substantially \nrelated.  (See Def.'s Mem.  in Supp.  at 9.) \nDefendant's  argument  ignores  the  well  settled principle \ndiscussed above  that \"it is  the  congruence  of factual  matters, \nrather  than  areas  of  law which  establishes  a  substantial \nrelationship  for  disqualification purposes.\"  See  United  States \nLeague,  605  F.

In  one  case  cited favorably  by  defendant,  United \nStates  v.  Uzzi,  549  F.  Supp.  979,  982  (S.D.N.Y.  1982),  the  court \nheld that an  investigation conducted by  the United  States \nAttorney was  substantially related to  a  subsequent prosecution \nbased on  this  investigation because  \"the prosecution arose \ndirectly out of  that investigation.\"g/  In  contrast,  here  it is \nundisputed  that the  facts  and circumstances  giving  rise to  the \npresent action while  similar are clearly not  congruent  to  those \nmaterial  to  and Ke22ner. \n~son \nBecause Magistrate  Judge  Pollak  applied the proper \nlegal  standard  to determine  whether  the present litigation was \nsubstantially related to  the Manhattan  and Queens  litigation and \nbecause  it is undisputed that the present litigation concerns \ndifferent city agencies,  personnel,  and policies  than  the prior \nlitigation,  this Court  cannot  state with  a  definite  and  firm \nconviction  that a  mistake  has  been  committed.

County of Lake,  703 \nF.2d 252,  254  (7th Cir.  1983),  where  the court upheld disqualification based on \nthe undisputed fact that an attorney had access  to specific sewer agreements  that \nwould be relevant in  the pending litigation. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 18 of 25\n- 18  -\nsubstantially related within  the meaning  of Disciplinary Rule  9-\n101(B)  is affirmed. \nHueston's  Testimony \nDefendant  next challenges Magistrate  Judge  Pollak's \nfindings  that  (1)  the  strip-search litigations  are  not  the  same \nmatter,  and  (2)  Hueston  did not personally and  substantially \nparticipate in  the Manhattan  and Queens  strip-search litigations, \narguing  that they  are  clearly erroneous  because  they  are based in \npart on  Hueston's  contradictory  statements. \nWhile  defendant  claims  that Magistrate  Judge  Pollak \nbased her finding  that  the Manhattan  and Queens  litigations do \nnot  represent  the  same  matter  as  the present litigation on \nHueston's  testimony,  an  analysis  of  the  January  28th  Order \nreveals  that she  relied on  the  allegations  in  the  complaint  in \nmaking  this  determination.  (See  Pollak Op.  at 18-19.)  Defendant \nclaims  that Magistrate  Judge  Pollak made  this  determination based \nupon  Hueston's  subsequently  contradicted statements  that he  did \nnot  represent Kerik,  treat  as  a  opt-out case, \nKe~~ner  ~son \ncorrespond with Kerlin  regarding  ~son and  the possibility that \nKe~~ner might  represent a  ~son opt-out case,  or meet with  Police \nOfficers  Cosaluzzo  and Bellomo  or Warden  Alonzo  Davis.  With  the \nexception of  the Davis  and Bellomo meetings,  Hueston  does  not \ndispute  the  validity of defendant's  assertions.  Nevertheless, \ndespite  Hueston's misstatements,  it is apparent  that Magistrate \nJudge  Pollak based her  decision  on  the  lack  of  factual  congruence \nbetween  the material  facts  giving rise  to  the present litigation \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 19 of 25\n- 19  -\nand  those  giving  rise  to  the prior litigation.  In  the  January \n28th  Order,  Magistrate  Judge  Pollak explicitly stated: \n\"Nothing  in  the  information presently presented to  the  Court \nalters  the  fact  that Mr.  Hueston  did not represent  the  City \nin  the  class  action litigation.  Even  if the \n~son  Ke~~ner \ncase  had been  a  opt-out and had  raised the  same  issues \n~son \nas  that does  not  change  the  fact  that both  cases  are \n~son, \nvery different from  the  ones  currently pending before  this \nCourt.  Different City agencies  and personnel  were \nresponsible  for  the  strip search policy being challenged in \nQueens  and Manhattan  and now  under  challenge  in Brooklyn. \nThe  DOC,  which  ran  the  Queens  and Manhattan  facilities, \nplayed no  role  in Brooklyn,  nor  did it exert authority over \nthe NYPD,  the  City  agency  alleged now  to be  responsible  for \nstrip-searching misdemeanor  arrestees  in Brooklyn.  Finally \n...  the  claims  raised in  were  focused  on  a  written DOC \n~son \ndirective  that was  promulgated  just to  cover Manhattan  and \nQueens,  while  the  current litigation alleges  an  unwritten \npractice of  routinely conducting  strip-searches  in \nBrooklyn.\" \nTherefore,  it is apparent  that Magistrate  Judge \nPollak's decision  that the  two  matters  were  not  substantially \nrelated was  based on  an  analysis  of  the  congruence  between  the \nmaterial  facts  at issue  in  the past and present litigations  and \nnot  in  any way  on  the  contradicted testimony of Hueston. \nAccordingly,  as  stated above,  this  decision was  not  clearly \nerroneous. \nExposure  to Confidential  & Privileged Information \nDefendant also argues  that Magistrate  Judge  Pollak's \nfinding  that Hueston  was  not exposed  to privileged and \nconfidential  information  concerning  was  clearly erroneous \n~son \nbecause  it was  based in part upon  Hueston's  contradicted \ntestimony.  Such  reliance,  defendant maintains,  thwarts  the \npurpose  of  the  disqualification  rule,  which  is  to preserve  the \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 20 of 25\n- 20  -\npublic  trust in  the  administration of  justice and  the  integrity \nof  the bar by  safeguarding  the  confidences  and  secrets  of \nclients. \nIn  United States v.  Raddatz,  447  U.S.  667,  676  (1980), \nthe  Supreme  Court held that in reviewing objections  to  the  report \nand  recommendation  of a  magistrate  judge  concerning  the \ncredibility of witnesses,  a  court need not undertake  a  de  novo \nreview  of  such  testimony but may,  instead,  afford a  degree  of \ndeference  to  the  credibility determination  of  the magistrate. \nThe  Second Circuit has  similarly held  that district  judge \nreviewing  the  credibility determinations  of a  magistrate may \ndefer  to  the  judgment of  the magistrate because  of  the \nmagistrate's  superior ability as  the primary factfinder  to \nobserve  witnesses  and  their demeanor.

Nevertheless,  a  district court may  choose  to \nreject the  findings  of  the magistrate and  conduct an  evidentiary \nhearing  in order  to  determine  the  credibility of  the witnesses  if \nit is left with  a  definite and  firm  conviction  that  the \ncredibility determinations  of  the magistrate  are  inaccurate.  See \nRaddatz,  447  U.S.  at 676;  Tayl.or,  92  F.3d at 1327;  see al.so  Hil.l. \nv.  Beyer,  62  F.3d  474,  481  (3d Cir.  1995)  (\"[aJ  district court \nmay  either accept  the  recommendation  of a  magistrate  judge  or \nreject the  recommendation  and reach  an  independent  conclusion \nafter hearing  testimony and viewing  witnesses\") . \nHere,  Magistrate  Judge  Pollak placed Hueston  under  oath \nand observed his  demeanor  throughout  two  days  of  testimony.'o/ \nBecause  Hueston  denied receiving any privileged or confidential \ninformation  and because  defendant offered no  conclusive evidence \nlinking Hueston  to  such  information,  Magistrate  Judge  Pollak \ndecided  to  credit Hueston's  testimony  in  its entirety.  In  this \nsituation,  where  Hueston's  credibility has  been  tested and \nMagistrate  Judge  Pollak  considered all of defendant's  \"newly \ndiscovered\"  evidence,  deference  to  the  findings  of the magistrate \nis proper.  This  Court  is not  left with  the  definite  and  firm \n10/  Despite defendant's  contrary arguments,  it is clear from Magistrate \nJudge  Pollak's order  that she based her decision on  her observation of defendant \nat the  September  6th  and 20th  bearings  and not on  his previous  statements.  (See \nPollak Op.  at 17.) \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 22 of 25\n- 22  -\nconviction  that the  original  factfinder has  committed  an  error. \nSee Raddatz,  447  U.S.  at 676;  TayIor,  92  F.3d at 1327;  Griffiths, \n845  F.  Supp.  at 107  Moreover,  deference here  is also  appropriate \nin  light of  the legislative purpose  of ยง  636(b) (1)  and Rule \n72(a),  which  was  to alleviate  the  increasing congestion  of \nlitigation in  the  district courts.  See  Raddatz,  447  U.S.  at 676 \nn.3  (reasoning  that  liberally revisiting credibility determina \ntions  of  the magistrate  judge would defeat  the  legislative \npurpose  of ยง  636 (b) (1) ) . \nConclusive  Proof  of Exposure \nFinally,  defendant  argues  that Magistrate  Judge \nPollak's  ruling is contrary to  law because  it would  require \ndefendant  to produce  \"conclusive proof\"  that Hueston  received \nprivileged and  confidential  information  concerning  the Manhattan \nand Queens  litigations while  he  was  employed by  the  SFLD. \nDefendant maintains  that a  party moving  for  disqualification on \nsuccessive  representation grounds  need not  show  that counsel \nactually obtained privileged and  confidential  information; \nrather,  the moving party need only  show  that the  attorney would \nhave  had  access  to  the  relevant  information by  virtue  of his \ninvolvement  in  the prior case. \nHere  again,  defendant's  argument  ignores  the \nconjunctive  relationship  of  the  applicable  three-prong \ndisqualification  test that has  been  noted both by  this Court  and \nby Magistrate  Judge  Pollak in both her May  20th  and  January  28th \nOrders.  It is well  established in  the  Second  Circuit that \"the \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 23 of 25\n- 23  -\nsubstantial  relationship  test does  not exist for  its own  sake. \nRather  it serves  as  a  substitute for proof  that it is generally \nimproper  for  a  Court  to entertain.\"  U.S.  League,  605  F. \nFootba~~ \nSupp.  at 1461  (citing inter  Cheng,  631  F.2d at 1056; \na~ia  E~e, \n478  F.2d at 571;  T.C.

Thus, \nwhere  the movant  has  established a  substantial  relationship \nbetween  the past and present  litigation,  the  Court must presume \nthat confidences  and privileged information were  disclosed during \nthe prior representation.  See  Peacock  Inc.  v.  Mass. \nHo~dings, \nMut.  Life  Ins.  Co.,  1996 WL  285435,  at *8  (E.D.N.Y.  1996)  (citing \nA2~egaert v.

Having  failed to establish \na  substantial  relationship between  the past and present \nlitigation,  defendant was  not  entitled to a  presumption  that \nHueston  had access  to privileged and  confidential  information. \nSee  id. \nIn  this  Circuit it is well  settled that the presumption \nof access  to privileged information  that arises  after the movant \nhas  established that  the  existence of a  substantial  relationship \nis rebuttable.

The  Second  Circuit has \nrecognized  the  incongruity of making  a  presumption  rebuttable and \nthen making  the  standard of proof  for  rebuttal unattainably high \nand has  held that an  attorney may  rebut  the presumption  through \ntestimony  and/or  affidavits.  See  Si~ver Chrys~er-P~y.mouth,  518 \nF.2d.  at 751;  Laskey,  224  F.2d at 827.  If a  court credits  the \ntestimony  or affidavits  of counsel,  the presumption  is rebutted, \nand  the  court may  deny  the motion  for  disqualification or examine \nother  supporting evidence  offered by  the movant.  See  id.; \nHuntington,  655  F.  Supp.  at 572;  see  Gov't  of India,  569 \na~so \nF.2d at 741  (Mansfield,  J.  concurring). \nIn  this  case Magistrate  Judge  Pollak  credited Hueston's \ntestimony  after thoroughly examining  defendant's  \"newly \ndiscovered\"  evidence  and allowing defendant  to  cross-examine \nHueston.  Not  only  did  she properly grant Hueston  an  opportunity \nto  rebut  defendant's  claims,  she  also allowed  defendant  to \nchallenge  this  rebuttal.  Because Magistrate  Judge  Pollak applied \nthe  appropriate  legal  standard in determining  whether  Hueston \nactually or was  likely to  have  had access  to privileged and \nconfidential  information  and because  this  Court  is not  left with \na  definite and  firm  conviction  that a  mistake has  been made,  it \ncannot be  said that Magistrate  Judge  Pollak's  decision  was \nclearly erroneous  or contrary  to  law.  Accordingly,  defendant's \nmotion  on  this  ground  is denied. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 162      Filed 08/27/2003     Page 25 of 25\n- 25  -\nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  set forth  above,  the  decision  of \nMagistrate  Judge  Pollak  is affirmed. \nThe  Clerk  is directed to  furnish  a  filed copy  of  the \nwithin  to all parties and  to  the magistrate  judge. \nSO  ORDERED. \nDated  Brooklyn,  New  York \nAugust ~~, 2003 \nJudge ",

These  facts  and \ninferences  taken  together  with  the large number  of arrestees who \npass  through  Central  Booking,  they  argue,  satisfy the  numerosity \nrequirement.fl  Defendants  argue  that  the pleadings  and \ndepositions  in  this  case  do  not support  the  existence of a  class, \nsince even  the  named plaintiffs  were  not  all  \"strip searched\" \nunder  the usual  definition of  the  term,ยง!  and  that their \ntestimony establishes  that there was  no  \"pattern\"  of  strip \nsearches  at Central  Booking. \nDefendants'  argument essentially asks  me  to  decide  the \nmerits  of plaintiffs'  claims,  which  is  not  appropriate at this \nstage.  See Eisen,  417  U.S.  at 178.  Plaintiffs have  clearly \nproduced evidence  sufficient to form  the  basis  for  an  inference \nthat a  policy,  practice,  or custom existed with  respect  to strip \nsearches  at Central Booking  similar  to  that which  plaintiffs \ndescribe.

Courts  in this  Circuit have \npreviously held such  an  allegation to  satisfy the  commonality \nrequirement.  See,  e.g.,  Dodge  v.  County of Orange  208  F.R.D.  79, \n88-89  (S.D.N.Y.  2002)  (finding  commonality  in a  putative  class \naction challenging an  alleged blanket  strip-search policy); \nManee2y v.  City of Newburgh,  208  F.R.D.  69,  74-75  (S.D.N.Y.  2002) \n(sarne) .  Defendants'  objections  to commonality hinge  on  their \ncontention  that plaintiffs have  not proven  that a  strip-search \npolicy existed at Central  Booking,  as  illustrated by varying \naccounts  of  searches  given by plaintiffs  themselves.  While  this \ncertainly may be  relevant  to plaintiffs'  ability to prove  their \nclass-wide claims,  it is not  an  appropriate  inquiry at this  stage \nof  the  litigation.  Defendants'  argument  that plaintiffs'  claims \nare  not susceptible  to  class-wide  proof because  they  are \ndependent on  an  inquiry of the  circumstances  of each  search \nsimilarly  ignores  plaintiffs'  allegation,  which  I  accept as  true \nfor purposes  of  this motion,  that a  policy existed at Central \nBooking  of  strip searching misdemeanor detainees.  For  these \nreasons,  I  find  that defendants  have  satisfied the  commonality \nrequirement. \n\"Typicality requires  that the  claims  of  the  class \nrepresentatives  be  typical  of  those  of  the  class,  and  is \nsatisfied when  each  olass member's  claim arises  from  the  sarne \ncourse  of events,  and each  class member  makes  similar legal \ny \n( ... continued) \ncOMi<iered in disposing of  the prQsQnt motion or in the resolution of  the \",laM-\n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 174      Filed 10/10/2003     Page 9 of 16\n- 9  -\narguments  to prove  the  defendant  s  liability.  Robinson,  267 \n1  H \nF.3d at 155  (internal quotation marks  omitted).  The  typicality \nrequirement  \"has  been  found  to be  satisfied when  the claims  of \nthe  representatives  and other class members  are based  on  the  same \nlegal  or  remedial  theory  and  there are  no  antagonistic  interests \nbetween  the  two  groups.\"  In  re  X-Ray  Film Antitrust: \nMedica~ \nLit:igat:ion,  at *3  (internal quotation marks  omitted)  (quoting  In \nre Alcoholic Beverages  Litigat:ion,  95  F.R.D.  321,  324  (E.D.N.Y. \n1982ยป  .  Here,  despite  the  differing oiroumstanoes  of plaintiffs' \narrests,  their class-wide claim  rises and  falls on  their ability \nto  prove  a  polioy of strip searohes  at Central Booking,  in \nviolation of  the  legal  requirements  that a  determination  of \nreasonable  suspicion  be made  prior  to  suoh  a  search.  Defendants \nargue  that a  finding of  liability would  require  fact-specifio \ninquiries  into  the  search  of each  defendant;  however  it is \ndefendants'  alleged policy of indiscriminate  strip searches,  not \nthe  alleged unconstitutionality of eaoh  individual  search,  that \nis at issue  in plaintiffs'  claims.  Accordingly,  I  find \nplaintiffs'  claims  typical of  those  of absent  class members. \nThe  final  requirement  of Rule  23(a)  is adequacy  of \nrepresentation.  This  requirement  oonsists of  two  elements:  (1) \nthe  representative plaintiffs'  attorneys must  be  qualified, \nexperienced,  and generally able  to  conduct  the  litigation,  and \n(2)  the plaintiffs'  interests must  not be  antagonistic  to  those \nof  the  remainder  of  the  class.  In re Drexel Burnham  Lambert: \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 174      Filed 10/10/2003     Page 10 of 16\n10-\nGroup,  Inc.,  960  F.2d  285,  291  (2d Cir.  1992).  Defendants  raise \nobjections  on  both  these  prongs. \nFirst,  defendants  claim  that plaintiffs lack  the \noredibility,  character,  and familiarity with  the  facts  of  the \ncase  to  adequately  represent  the  class.  In  determining whether  a \nplaint.iff  is an  adequate  class  representative,  \"[tJhe  inquiry \ninto  the  representatives'  personal qualities  is not  an \nexamination  into  their moral  righteousness,  but rather an  inquiry \ndirected at improper  or questionable  conduct  arising out of or \ntouching upon  the  very prosecution of the  lawsuit.\"  Jane B.  by \nMartin  v.  New  York  City Dep't  of Soc,  Servs.,  117  F.R.D.  64,  71 \n(S.D.N.Y.  1987).  Since  this  action alleges  claims  on  behalf of \nmisdemeanor  arrestees,  it cannot be  expected that class members \nor  their representatives will be  of  spotless  character. \nDefendants'  attempts  to  attack  the  credibility of  the plaintiffs \nbased on,  for  example,  their tax-filing practices,  reading \nskills,  psychological  disabilities,  immigration  status,  and \ncriminal  history are  not character deficiencies  \"arising out of \nor  touching  upon\"  the  alleged strip-search pclicy at Central \nBooking.  Det'endants  challenge plaintiffs  Yvonne  James  and Angie \nMelicio  on  grounds  that  they were  initially charged with  felonies \nand  may  have  been  so  charged at the  time  of  their  challenged \nsearches;  however,  they have  not adduced evidence  sufficient  to \nlay to rest as  a  matter cf law plaintiffs'  assertion  that they \nwere  charged with misdemeanors  at  that  time.  Defendants' \nobjections  to  certain plaintiffs'  alleged lack of understanding \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 174      Filed 10/10/2003     Page 11 of 16\n- 11  -\nof  the  present action  and  their role in it based on  excerpts  from \ntheir deposition  testimony are contradicted or otherwise  undercut \nby  other portions  of  their depositions  in which  the Same \nplaintiffs evince  at least a  basic layman's  understanding  of  the \nnature of  the  harm  they have  allegedly  suffered and a  desire for \na  remedy.  Defendant's  argument  that Anthony  Micciulli did  not \nfile  a  notice of  claim and may,  thus,  be  subject to a  special \ndefense  on  his  state  law claims  is without merit;  this  issue does \nnot  \"threaten  to become  the  focus  of litigation\"  in a  way  that \nwould make  Micciulli  an  inadequate  representative,  particularly \ngiven  the  viability of his  ยง  1983  claim.  See  Gary Plastic \nPackaging Corp.  v.  MerriLL  Lynch,  903  F.2d 176  (2d Cir.  1990) \nThis  is also  true  of Mohamed  Habrout's  rejection of a  Rule  68 \noffer  of  judgment,  raised by defendants  as  a  basis  for his \ninadequacy  as  a  class representative.  Finally,  plaintiffs \nconcede  that Alexander  Timofeev  and  Federico  Tenorio  are  not \nadequate  representatives,  because  they cannot be  located. \nAccordingly,  they will not be  certified as  class \nrepresentatives.I!  I  find  the  remaining proposed class \nrepresentatives  to be  adequate  under Rule  23{a). \nWith  respect  to plaintiffs'  counsel,  defendants  argue \nthat  they have  committed discovery violations,  have  potential \nconflicts  of interest,  display unfamiliarity with  and poor \nmanagement  of the class  action  device,  and have  otherwise behaved \nThe  proposed consolidated oo,\"plaint lists these two  .indl.v.iduals  as \npla~nhff~, proc. ...d  ing \"individually\" not on behalf of all oth. .r ,.  ~i\",ilarly \nSl.tua.ted. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 174      Filed 10/10/2003     Page 12 of 16\n- 12  -\ninappropriately in  this  litigation.  On May  20,  2002,  Magistrate \nJudge  Pollak denied defendants'  motion  to  disqualify plaintiffs' \ncounsel  on  grounds  of  an  alleged conflict of interest;  a  motion \nfor  reconsideration  was  denied on  January  28,  2002,  and  Judge \nPollak's  ruling  was  affirmed by  this  Court  on August  20,  2003. \nRobert  Isseks  is class  connsel  in two  similar  class actions \nchallenging alleged strip-search policies  in  the  Southern \nDistrict of New  York.  Defendants  do  not  assert that plaintiffs' \noounsel  have been  sanctioned or disciplined for  any  of  their \nallegedly improper  or unethical  conduct,  and  they have  long \nexperience with  this  case  and  similar CaSes.  Accordingly,  I  find \nthem  to be  qualified to Serve  as  class counsel  for  this  action. \nBased  on  the  foregoing  discussion,  I  find  the \nrequirements  of Rule  23(a)  satisfied in this  case. \nRule  23 (b)  Criteria \nPlaintiffs  seek  certification under  Rule  23(b) (2)  or, \nalternatively,  23(b) (3).  The  Second Circuit has  reoently \nprovided guidance  on  the maintainability criteria for putative \nclass  actions  that seek both  damages  and injunctive  relief. \n[Wjhen  presented with  a  motion  for  (b) (2)  class \ncertification of a  claim  seeking both  injunctive  relief \nand non-incidental  monetary damages,  a  district court \nmust  consider  the evidence  presented at a  class \ncertification hearing  and  the  arguments  of counsel,  and \nthen  assess  whether  (b) (2)  certification  is  appropriate \nin light of  the  relative  importance  of  the  remedies \nsought,  given  all of the  facts  and circumstanoes  of  the \ncase.  The  district court may  allow  (b) (2)  certification \nif it finds  in  its informed,  sound  judicial discretion \nthat  (1)  the positive weight  or value  to  the plaintiffs \nof  the injunctive or declaratory  relief sought  is \npredcminant  even  though  compensatory  or punitive \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 174      Filed 10/10/2003     Page 13 of 16\n- 13  -\ndamages  are also claimed,  and  (2)  class  treatment  would \nbe  efficient and manageable,  thereby  achieving  an \nappreciable measure  of  judicial  economy. \nAlthough  the assessment  of whether  injunctive  or \ndeclaratory  relief predominates  will require an  ad hoc \nbalancing  that will vary  from  case  to  case,  before \nallowing  (b) (2)  certification a  district court  should, \nat a  minimum,  satisfy itself of  the  following:  (1)  even \nin the absence  of a  possible monetary  recovery, \nreasonable plaintiffs would bring the suit to obtain \nthe  injunctive or declaratory  relief sought;  and  (2) \nthe  injunctive or declaratory  relief  sought would  be \nboth  reasonably  necessary  and  appropriate  were  the \nplaintiffs to succeed  on  the merits.  Insignificant or \nsham  requests  for  injunctive  relief  should not provide \ncover  for  (b) (2)  certification of claims  that are \nbrought essentially for monetary  recovery. \nRobinson  v.  Metro-North  Commuter RR.  Co.,  267  F. 3d  147,  164  (2d \nCir.  2001).  Plaintiffs  have  produced numerous  sworn  statements \nto the effect that  they  are pursuing  this  litigation so  injuries \nsuch  as  those  they  allegedly suffered will  not be  inflicted on \nothers.  HOWeVer,  they were  apparently unaware  that a  substantial \nportion  of the  injunctive relief they  seek  had  already been \ngranted by  another  court and  rather  nonchalantly dropped  their \nrequest  for  such  injunctive relief when  made  aware  of  that fact. \nThere  is  thus  a  suspioion  that  the  request  for  injunctive  relief \nis merely  an  afterthought  to plaintiffs'  claims  for  damages. \nHowever,  considering  the  two  factors  set forth  in Rabinson,  I \nbelieve  that a  reasonable plaintiff would  still bring this  action \nin  the absenoe  of any  possible monetary  recovery,  particularly \ngiven  the  invasiveness of  the  alleged injuries.  Furthermore \nI \nwere  plaintiffs to  succeed on  the merits  that  is,  were  they  to \nprove  that the  alleged policy does  exist at Central Booking  --\n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 174      Filed 10/10/2003     Page 14 of 16\n- 14  -\nthe injunctive relief  they  request would  be  both  appropriate  and \nnecessary  to  prevent ongoing  or  repeated violation of  the  class' \n(and  any  potential  future  detainees')  rights.  Accordingly,  I \nfind  that analysis  under  Rule  23(b) (2)  is appropriate. \n\"Rule  23 (b) (2)  does  not  require  that all plaintiffs be \nidentically situated.  What  is important  is that the  relief \nsought by  the  named  plaintiffs benefit  the  entire class.\"  In re \nMethy.l  Tertiary Butyl  Ether  (\"MTBE\")  Products  Liability \nLitigation,  209  F.R.D.  323,  342  (S.D.N.Y.  2002)  (internal \nquotation  marks  and citations  omitted).  Plaintiffs allege  that \ndefendants  have  a  policy of strip searching misdemeanor  arrestees \nat Central Booking without  regard  to  the  reasonable  suspicion \nrequirement.  Such  a  polioy,  if it existed,  would  be  generally \napplicable to  the  class,  and  the  requested  injunction  prohibiting \nstrip searches,  barring  such  searches absent  reasonable \nsuspicion,  would  benefit the  entire class. \nDefendants  objeot that  the plaintiffs do  not  have \nstanding  to  seek  such  relief.  They  cite  in  support  of this \nargument  City of Los  Angeles  v.  Lyons,  461  U.S.  95  (1993). \nDefendants  argue  that plaintiffs  cannot  demonstrate  that  they  are \nlikely to  suffer  the  alleged injuries  again  in  the  future  and, \nthus,  lack  standing  to  seek  injunctive relief.  Lyons  is \ndistinguishable,  however,  because  in the  present case plaintiffs \nallege  that they  as  a  class,  rather  than  as  individuals,  are \nlikely  to  suffer future harm  and  because plaintiffs allege a \npolicy of performing  searches  without regard  to  reasonable \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 174      Filed 10/10/2003     Page 15 of 16\n- 15  -\nsuspicion,  rather  than  a  grant of discretion  to perform  such \nsearches.  Cยฃ.,  e.g.,  Deshawn  E.  by Char~ol:l:e E.  v.  Saยฃir,  156 \nF.3d  340,  344-45  (2d Cir.  1998).  In  such  a  case,  plaintiffs have \nstanding  to  seek  injunctive  relief.  Id. \nFinally,  in  a  general objection  to  certification, \ndefendants  argue  that the  proposed class  definition as  set forth \nin  the moving papers  is unworkable  because  it includes  a \nrequirement  that class members  must  have  been  searched without \nreasonable  suspicion.  In making  a  fact-sensitive  element of the \nclaim  a  prerequisite cf class membership,  defendants  argue,  the \nCourt wonld be  required  to  engage  in inquiries  on  the merits  of \neach  potential class member's  claim in order  to determine  their \neligibility for  inclusion  in  the  class.  This  argument  is not \nwithout merit,  but it is an  artifact of plaintiffs'  original \nclass definition  (i.e.,  placing  the  referenoe  to the alleged \nillegal policy,  practice,  or custom  in the  class  definition \nrather  than  as  a  separate  factual  allegation),  not evidence  that \nno  class  exists  (as  defendants  argue).  PlaintiffS have modified \ntheir proposed class  definition at oral  argument  to  eliminate \nabsence  of reasonable  suspicion as  a  prerequisite  to  class \nmembership,  see supra at 2.  Accordingly,  this  objection is now \nmoot. \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the following  class  is \ncertified:  All persons  who  since  1998  (1)  have been  charged with \nmisdemeanors  or non-criminal  offenses  in Kings  County;  (2)  were \nas  a  result detained at Brooklyn  Central  Booking:  and  (3)  were \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 174      Filed 10/10/2003     Page 16 of 16\n- 16  -\nduring  the  detention  strip searched  at Brooklyn  Central Booking \nwithout  regard  for  the  existence of probable  cause  or  reasonable \nsuspicion. \nAs  discussed at oral  arguments  on  this motion,  I  have \nnot  considered plaintiffs'  motion  for  a  preliminary injunction. \nInsofar as  the injunctive relief  sought herein  is sought  on \nbehalf  of the class,  not on  behalf of the  named plaintiffs, \nadjudication of the motion  for  class  certification was  a \ncondition precedent  tc  consideration of  the motion  for  a \npreliminary injunction.  As  I  advised the  parties  at oral \narguments,  plaintiffs may  renew  on  notice  their motion  for  a \npreliminary  injunction on  behalf of the plaintiff c1ass.V \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  leave  to file the propcsed \nconsolidated complaint  is granted on  consent.  Plaintiffs'  motion \nfor  class  certification is granted. \nThe  Clerk  is  directed to furnish  a  filed  copy  of  the \nwithin  to all parties  and  to  the magistrate  judge. \nso \nOIUlEBED. \ny, '. \nDated:  Brooklyn,  New  York \n2003 \noctober \nUnited States Di  trict Judge \nAccordingl.y,  the motion for a  p\"eli\"inary injunotion inoorporated 1nto \npl.al.ntiffsยท  \"otion for olass cerhfioahon is denied without prejud1cQ  to its \nrenewal.

City of New York, CV 021039 \nYour Honor: \nThis office and attorney Robert N, Isseks represent the plaintiffs in the above \nreferenced cases.  I write in response to rlefense counsel's lettor of Deccmb\"f 31,2003, which, \namong other things,  objects  to  ~ome of the language in plaintiffs'  consolidated class action \ncomplaint \nFirst, plaintiffs have always challenged the fact that plaintiffs were strip searched \nin  front  of onlookers  and/or  members  of the  opposite  sex  and  have  always  sought  class \ncertification on this claim.  .see Proposed Consolidated Class Action Complaint, dated January \n30, 2003 (Der. Ex. B) at prelim. strut., ~~ 7,  15, 17.  Plaintiffs wish (0 pursue this claim at the \nupcoming trial. \nSecond, plaintiffs have always challenged the fact that plaintiffs and thousands of \nother detainees were subjected to unconstitutional conditions in Brooklyn Central Booking and \nhave alway\" ROUght class certifioation on this daim,  See Proposed Consolidated Class Action \nComplaint, dated January 30, 2003 (DeE. Ex. B) at prelim. strut., ~~ 7,21-23,25.  Plaintiffs wish \nto reserve their right to class certification on this aspect of their case.  In any event, we intend to \nfile  a  second  action  very  which  challenges  the  conditions  of Brooklyn  Central \nclaGG  S(JUll \nBooking on  behalf of all  detainees,  felony  and  misdemeanor,  irrespective  of whether such \ndetainees were strip searched. \nr \nFinally,  wish  to  point out  that  the  consolidated  class  action  complaint was \ninterposed for convenience and pursuant to request by the Law Department.  These ar.tions are \nalready consolidated and there is no legal requirement that the complaints in consolidated actions \nbe consolidated into a single caption,  Moreover, the Court never ordered plaintiff.~ to file  a \nsingle consolidated pleading, \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 241      Filed 02/03/2004     Page 3 of 3\n\" \nRespectfully, \nRichard 1.

Strip Searches \n15.  The  Fourth  Amendment  to  thc  United  States  Constitution  pl'Ohibits \ngovernment officials from performing stnp searches of arrestccs charged with misdemeanors or \nother lesser offenses unless the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the atTcstee is concealing a \nweapon or other contraband based on the crime charged, the particular characteristics of the \narrestee, or the circumstances ofthc arrest. \n16.  Even where the requisite suspicion exists, the Constitution mandates that \nstrip scarches be conducted in a reasonable manner.  A strip search is unreasonable if it is carried \nout by, or in thc prcsence of, officers of a different sex as the arrested person, or in the presenec \nof onlclOkers or other arrcstecs. \n17.  Defendants  created  and  maintain  a  policy,  practice  and  custom  m \nBrooklyn Central Booking of carrying out baseless and unlawful strip searches. \n18.  These strip searches are perrormed on every individual who is proccssed \nthrough Brooklyn Central Booking.  Under defendants' policy, it is immaterial that the arrestec is \ncharged with a misdemeanor and that there is an absence of reason to believe that the alTestcc is \nconcealing contraband.  Moreover, the  strip  searches  arc  conducted  in  the most humiliating \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 217      Filed 12/22/2003     Page 6 of 13\nmanner possible, in full  view of numerous officers and arrestees,  and often times in from of \nmembers of(he opposite sex. \n19.  Defendants and officials at the highest-levels ofmwlicipaJ government are \naware  that  unlawful  strip  searches  are being  conducted  in Brooklyn  Central  Booking  on  a \nwidespread and persistent basis.  This knowledge is deriyed from defendants' direct participation \nin  the  practice,  their  own  observations,  conversations  with  their  colleagues,  reports  from \nsubordinates,  ami  from  the  numerous  lawsuits,  claims  and  complaints  filed  on  the  practice. \nDefendants and other officials, however, have been deliberately indifferent to the problem, have \nbeen grossly negligent, and/or have failed to take appropriate remedial action. \n20.

Unconstitutional Conditions of Brooklyn Central Booking \n21.  Jail  conditions  are  unconstitutional  where  they  result  III  serious \ndeprivations ofbasie human needs and are imposed with deliberate indifference. \n22.  Each of the named plaintiffs was processed at Brooklyn Central Booking. \nWhile incarcerated at Brooklyn Central Booking, plaintiffs and numerous other arrcstces were \nheld  in filthy,  disease-ridden, overcrowded jail cells.  These jail cells have been infested with \nrodents and roaches for years.  Moreover, there is often human feces and excrement on the floor \nand on the single toilet that the numerous arrestees in a cell are forced to share without privacy. \nThe toilet is clogged and overflov,.s onto the  floor.  Toilet paper and bedding are nonexistent. \nThere is no access to clean drinking water.  Temperatures are in the extremes,  Mlik is stored in a \nrefrigerator that is labeled as containing \"biohazards,\"  There are health officials present in the \nfacility  advising  the arrcstecs  to  be  tested  for tuberculosis  once they are released,  Violent \ncriminals roam without supervision.  The guards assigned to Central Booking look the other way \n\" \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 217      Filed 12/22/2003     Page 8 of 13\nat these dangerous conditions, and either ignore or utter profanities to arrestees who seek (heir \nassistance.  The guards sometimes subject arrcstees to forced labor.  Mohammed Habrout was \nordered to transport a heavy crate of milk.  The typical arrestce spends 24 harrowing hours in \nCentral Booking. \n23.  Defendants and officials at the highest-levels of municipal govemment are \naware  of the  unconstitutional  conditions  of Brooklyn  Central  Booking  and  know  lhat  such \nconditions  exist  on  a  widespread  and  persistent  basis.  This  knowledge  is  derived  from \ndefendants' direct participation in the operation of the facility, the officials' own observations, \nconversations  with  colleagucs,  reports  from  subordinates,  and  from  the  numerous  lawsuits, \nclaims  and  complaints  filed  by arrcstees  and  municipal  cmployees.  Defendants  and  other \nofficials,  however,  have  been  deliberately  indifferent  to  the  problem,  have  been  grossly \nnegligent, and/or have failed to take appropriatc remedial action.  Accordingly, defendants have \ncreated and maintain a policy, practice and custom in Brooklyn Central Booking of confining \ndetainees in Brooklyn Central Booking in lin unconstitutional manner. \n24.  In a January 31, 1999 article appearing in the New York Times, Sunday \nEdition, a journalist rcponed on her experience in Brooklyn Central Booking after being arrested \non a minor offense: \nOur dubious sorority was locked in a grimy, littered \ncell,  which  we  shared  with  free-range  mice  and \ncockroaches.  There  was  one  open,  seatless  toilet \nThe food consisted of desiccated bread sandwiching \nslabs  of something  pink  and  slimy.  (I ended  up \neating mustard  and  mayonnaise sandwiches).  The \nmilk was warm, and  one of the guards told us the \n,,ยทater was contaminated wilh lead.  Another guard \ndecided I was his type, and made sure J knew where \n(0 find him in case my man-iage fell apalt. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 217      Filed 12/22/2003     Page 9 of 13\nAbout !O P.M., after six hours in lockup, my lawyer \nstopped by for the lasl time that day to loll me that it \ntakes  24  to  30  hours  for  the  paperwork  to  go \nr  a \nthrough  Albany.  wouldn't  see  judge until that \nhappened. \nI resigned myself to spending the night. r lay down \non the cold, dirty, linoleum  noor '\"ith the  'girls,\" \nr \nmy sneakers  for  a pillow.  \\~rapped myself in a \nreeking jacket that one of the  women  lent  me.  I \nworried  about  lice,  and  told  myself  that  the \ncongested coughing I heard was probably not a sign \nof tuberculosis. The guard woke us several times to \nmove us en masse from one cell to another. Without \nexplanation,  breakfast  arrived  at  3  A.M.  (Warm \nmilk, boxes of dry cereal, no utcnsils.). \nC.  Class Allegations \n25.  As the C0U11 has already found, the requirements of a class action are met \nin this case. \n26.  First, the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \nMost of the named plaintiffs in this case observed nmncrous individuals other than themselves \nbeing strip searched without regard to individualized suspicion.  Indeed, the officers employed \nin Central Booking plainly laekcd knowledge of what plaintiffs and the other arrestccs were \ncharged with, and conducted strip searches in all assembly\"line manner.  The named plaintiffs \nalso  observed  numerous  of their  fellow  arrestccs  being  subjected  to  the  same  depraved \nconditions  of confinement.  The  named  plaintiffs  Bnd  the  numerons  individnals  who  were \nconfined with (hem provide just a small  sample of (he thousands of individuals processed in \nBrooklyn Central Booking each year. \n27.  Second, there arc questions of law and fact common to the class, and the \nclaims of the class representatives are typical of those of the class.  Indeed, commonality and \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 217      Filed 12/22/2003     Page 10 of 13\ntypicality exist because the injuries complained of by the named plainti CIs resulted from the same \nunconstitutional practice, cnstom and pattem that injured and will injure the class members. \n28.  Third, the named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests \nof the class.  The named plaintiffs are stable residents of Brooklyn, they havc no arrest history, \nand they possess a genuine interest in  remedying the harm that was inflicted upon them and \nothers. \n29.  Fourth, the undersigned attorneys are highly-experienced in federal  civil \nrights litigation and arc able and quahfied to conduct the class wide litigation. \nD.  Claims of False Arrest and Malicious ProsecutiOll by Plaiutiffs Francis Becht and \nCorneilins Philips \n30.  Francis  Becht:  On  October  4,  2000,  Mr,  Becht  was  arrested  for \nmisdemeanor  criminal  mischief (vandalism)  by  Detective  Paul  Denver  of the  62nd  Police \nPrccinct.  The misdemeanor charge against Becht was dismissed on March 15, 200t.  Becht was \narrested  and  prosecuted without probable cause because Detective Denver knew that Becht's \nneighbor, who had accused Becht of damaging her automobile, was emotionally disturbed and \nthat her complaint was objectively implausible.  Moreover, although Becht had paperwork in his \npossession that objectiyely and uneql!ivocally established that he was at work and not anywhere \nnear his neighbor's property when the alleged vandalism occulTed, Detective Denver refused to \nconsider the paperwork or alert prosecutors of its existence. \n31.  Comeilius Philips:  On March 28,  2001, Philips was arrested by Police \nOfficer Edwin Caban and others of Transit District 33, and falsely charged with Obstructing \nGovernmental Administration, a misdemeanor.  Philips nevcr obstructed the  administration of \nthe government.  Philips merely attempted to explain to  Officer Caball that he was not truant \nii-om  school,  but  01)  his  way  to  a  nearby doctor's  office  for  an  examination.

Since this action will proceed on a class basis, \nrhe prospect of relirigarion of Mr. Timofeev's claims is unlikely; presumably Mr. Timo[eev will \nbe entitled to any relief ultimately granted to the class, \nFinnlly, and most important, defendants have not been prejudiced by the absence of Mr. \nTimofeev,  Although the discovery process is nearing completion, defendants have been able to \ntake discovery of the remaining named plaintiffs in this action,  Since plaintiffs have agreed to \ndismiss Mr. Timofeev's claims, defendants will not be forced to defend against those claims \nwithout adequate preparation,  Because Mr. Timofecv has not been produced for a deposition, \nplaintifts are hereby  precluded from calling him as a witness at tr131.

However, plaintiffs' counsel has further indicated that Mr. Tenorio \nwould continue to press those claims that relate to the conditions of his confinement. \nDefendants' counsel had previously proposed a Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal, \nseeking to dismiss with prejudice all of Mr. Tenorio's claims in the Spinner litigation, including \nthe conditions of confinement claim, based on certain representations made during Mr. Tenorio's \ndeposition in another related action, Cence v. City of New York, No. 03 CV 4114 (S.D.N.Y.). \nHaving now clarified plaintiffs' position, which is that Mr. Tenorio only agrees to the \ndismissal of his strip search claims in Spinner, it is respectfully recommended that an order enter: \n(1) dismissing, with prejudice, all claims against all defendants named in the action \nSpinner v. City of New York, 01 CV 2715 (CPS), that relate to Mr. Tenorio's search by NYPD \npersonnel; \n(2) permitting Mr. Tenorio to maintain his \"conditions\" claims in the Spinner action; \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 264      Filed 03/16/2004     Page 2 of 2\n(3) precluding either party from calling Mr. Tenorio as a witness during the first phase of \nthe trial dealing with strip search allegations; and \n(4) permitting defendants to depose Mr. Tenorio on his conditions claim prior to the \ncommencement of that phase of the trial dealing with claims based on conditions of confinement. \nAny objections to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of the \nCourt, with a copy to the undersigned, within ten (10) days of receipt of this Report.  Failure to \nfile objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal the District Court's order.  See \n28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a), 6(e), 72; Small v. Secretary of Health and Human \nServs., 892 F.2d 15, 16 (2d Cir. 1989). \nThe Clerk is directed to mail copies of this Report and Recommendation to the parties. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: Brooklyn, New York \nMarch / 0 , 2004 \nCheryl L. \nUnited S  es Magistrate Judge \nEastern District of New York \n2 ",

CV 012715, CV 021039, CV 018264, \nCV 02 2899 (CPS) (eLl') \nDear Mr. Cardinale: \nIn  an  effort  to  facilitate  discussions  at  tomorrow'5  5ettlement  conference  before \nMagistrate Pollak, please be advised of the following authority which we will raise and believe \nshould be taken into account during settlement negotiations. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C.S. ยง1997e(e) (2004), states: \"Limitation on \nrecovery.  No federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner  confined in a jail, prison. or \nI \nother correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a \nprior showing ofphysicaJ injury.\"  This statute has been held to apply with equal force to both \nplaintiffs who bring suit while confined as well as those who bring stlil after lhey are released. \nSee Cox v. Malone, 199 F. Supp.2d 135, 140 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (where the court stated \"(t)he \nfortuity of release [ ) does not affect the kind of damages that must be alleged in order to SUlVive \nthe gate-keeping fUnction of section I 997e(e).  Because plaintiff's suit alleges only emotional \ninjuries, it is barred by the PLRA inespective orltis status as a parolee at the time of filing.\"), \naffd, 56 Fed. Appx. 43 (2d  Cir.2003).  We also intend to argue that the attorneyยทfee limitation \nu.s.c.s. \nof42  ยง1997e(d) applies with the same force as the 1997e(e) limitation on damages. \nI 42 U.S.C.S. ยง1997e(h) states: \"AS used in this section, the term ''prisoner'' means any person \nincarcerated or detained  in any  facility  who  is  accused  of,  convicted  of,  sentenoed  for,  or \nadjudicated delinquent  for,  violations of criminal  law or the terms lind  conditions of parole, \nprobation. pretrial release, or diversionary program.\" \nJ N1W I >lH..l':lrl  ml_\"  ..\"  .. \n\nCase 1:01-cv-02715-CPS-CLP     Document 306      Filed 06/13/2005     Page 3 of 7\nAs  you  are  aware,  your  clients  only  claim  emotional  damages  (and  not  physical \ninjuries) and thus would be preclUded from recovering compensatory damages pursuant to the \nabove authority from this Circuit. \nWe  look  forward  to  discussing  this  and  other points at  the  settlement conference \ntomorrow. \n2lL \nAlan H.

If we proceed instead with releases signed by the witnesses (as defense \ncounsel dC$.ires),  defense counsel  will not obtain the documents  for weeks or perhaps even \nmonths.  This will provide defense counsel with reason to seek an extension of the February 20, \n2004 discovery deadline. \nAs. soon as the subpoena is singed.
