Plaintiff, who was arrested on minor criminal charges, complained that he was subsequently strip searched in a group with ten other persons pursuant to a policy under which officers routinely subjected custodial detainees to strip and visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment and in the absence of any reasonable suspicion that the detainees possessed contraband or weapons.  </p><p>Plaintiff claimed that such a policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution as well as California state law.  To remedy the alleged violations, Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and class certification.</p><p>On July 29, 2008, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint to add four new plaintiffs.  The hearing and motions regarding class certification were then repeatedly pushed back as the parties continued discovery and settlement negotiations.</p><p>On September 25, 2009, the parties presented their settlement to the court. The settlement was approved 4 days later.  Parties agreed that class certification was inappropriate because defendants had revised their policy on November 20, 2003 and again in 2007 to comply with federal law. To remedy the individual violations that had occurred in spite of the policy revisions, the defendants agreed to pay $12,500 to each plaintiff, $100,000 in attorney fees, and $750-$1000 to each person who contacted plaintiff's attorney alleging that they fell within the allegations in the complaint. The defendants paid a total of $210,000, and on September 29, 2009, the case was dismissed with prejudice.</p><p></p>",

At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the\n8 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages\n9 of the state of California, the COUNTY OF SOLANO, and/or the SOLANO COUNTY Sheriffโs\n10 Department. \n11 5. Defendants whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious\n12 names of ROES 1 through 20, are all agents and/or employees of one or another of the above\n13 named defendants who ordered, condoned, authorized, covered up, or were otherwise associated\n14 with the implementation of the illegal policy and practices relating to the strip searches complained\n15 of herein. \n16 6. Defendant SOLANO COUNTY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was\n17 a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or\n18 practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which\n19 wrongs damaged plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.  Plaintiffโs allegations\n20 against the COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF and his DEPUTIES and\n21 on acts and omissions of persons who are COUNTY employees, and on the COUNTYโs breach\n22 of its duty to protect plaintiff, and all those he represents, from the wrongful conduct of said\n23 persons and employees.\n24 7. Defendant SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF GARY R. STANTON, in his Individual\n25 and Official Capacity, also maintained or permitted an official policy or custom of causing or\n26 permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged\n27 plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.  \n28 \\\\\\\nPage 3 of 12\nMICHAEL TODD, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB     Document 1     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 4 of 12(cid:10)\n1 8. Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period beginning\n2 two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, were subjected by\n3 defendants to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having,\n4 and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be productive of\n5 contraband or weapons, and/or who were strip searched prior to arraignment in an area that was\n6 observable by persons not participating in the search.\n7 FACTS\n8 9. On or about September 1, 2006, plaintiff MICHAEL TODD (hereinafter referred\n9 to as โplaintiffโ) was arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons and transported\n10 to the SOLANO COUNTY Justice Center Detention Facility (a SOLANO COUNTY Jail) where,\n11 prior to arraignment, he was taken to an area where he was forced to submit to a strip search in a\n12 group with at least ten (10) other persons who were not participating in the search.  He, together\n13 with the other persons strip searched, were required to remove all of their clothing and to lift their\n14 genitals for inspection and to bend over and expose their rectal areas for individual inspection.  \n15 10. Plaintiff was again subjected to a strip search, in a group, prior to arraignment, prior\n16 to being transferred to the SOLANO COUNTY Jail on Claybank Road.  \n17 11. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants routinely\n18 follow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including\n19 plaintiff, and all those he represents, to strip and visual body cavity searches without first having,\n20 and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of contraband\n21 or weapons.  Plaintiff is further informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants\n22 routinely follow their policy, practice, and custom of conducting the complained of searches in the\n23 presence of persons not participating in the searches.\n24 12. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants have the\n25 ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendantsโ\n26 custody, at the SOLANO COUNTY Jails within two (2) years prior to the filing of this Complaint,\n27 were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment without\n28 defendants first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would\nPage 4 of 12\nMICHAEL TODD, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB     Document 1     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 5 of 12(cid:10)\n1 be productive of contraband or weapons.\n2 13. Defendant SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF GARY R. STANTON is personally\n3 responsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom\n4 pursuant to which plaintiff, and all those he represents, were subjected to strip searches.\n5 14. As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, plaintiff,\n6 and each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress,\n7 invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law, and is entitled to recover damages\n8 according to proof but, at a minimum, $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code ยงยง 52 and ยง\n9 52.1(b).\n10 CLASS CLAIMS\n11 15. The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiff, and all those similarly\n12 situated, were subjected were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants\n13 COUNTY OF SOLANO, SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF GARY R. STANTON, the individual\n14 SHERIFFโS DEPUTIES sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 100, and the individuals\n15 whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names of ROES 1 through 20.\n16 The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged\n17 offenses for which plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, had been arrested, without regard to\n18 whether or not plaintiff, or those he represents, was eligible for cite and release under Penal Code\n19 ยง 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, was\n20 eligible for and/or was released on his or her own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches\n21 complained of herein were performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the\n22 plaintiff, or any of those similarly situated, so searched possessed weapons or contraband, and\n23 those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.  Finally, the\n24 searches complained of herein were performed without defendants taking reasonable precautions\n25 to insure that plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, was searched in an area affording\n26 privacy and was not observed by others not participating in the search. \n27 16. Plaintiff brings this action on his own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly\n28 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \nPage 5 of 12\nMICHAEL TODD, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB     Document 1     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 6 of 12(cid:10)\n1 17. The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including\n2 two (2) years prior to the filing of this Complaint, and continuing until this matter is adjudicated\n3 and the practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment\n4 strip and/or visual body cavity search at SOLANO COUNTY Jails without defendants first having,\n5 and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband\n6 or weapons. In addition, the class also includes all those persons who were subjected to pre-\n7 arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches in the presence of persons who were not\n8 participating in said searches (Group Strip Searches).\n9 18. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of\n10 the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiff does not know the\n11 exact number of class members.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that\n12 there are more than 20 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of\n13 defendants and are subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendantsโ policy,\n14 practice, and custom relating to said searches.  \n15 19. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is\n16 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of fact common to the\n17 class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to\n18 visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment whether or not they intend such persons to be\n19 housed in the SOLANO COUNTY Jails; (2) whether defendants routinely subject all persons\n20 arrested to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be\n21 housed in SOLANO COUNTY Jails; (3) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual body\n22 cavity searches prior to arraignment without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on\n23 specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or\n24 contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a strip and/or visual body cavity\n25 search; (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are conducted in an area of privacy\n26 so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the searches; (5) whether\n27 the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are conducted in groups; and, (6) whether the strip\n28 and/or visual body cavity searches are reasonably related to defendantsโ penological interest to\nPage 6 of 12\nMICHAEL TODD, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB     Document 1     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 7 of 12(cid:10)\n1 maintain the security of the jail and whether or not there are less intrusive methods for protecting\n2 any such interest. \n3 20. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff is\n4 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many questions of law common to the\n5 class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform strip and/or visual body\n6 cavity searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on\n7 specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular pre-arraignment detainee has concealed drugs,\n8 weapons and/or contraband which would likely be discovered by a strip and/or visual body cavity\n9 search; (2) whether defendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity searches on persons\n10 without first reasonably relating the use of the subject search to defendantsโ penological interest\n11 to maintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a less intrusive method to protect that\n12 interest; (3) whether strip and/or visual body cavity searches may be conducted in areas where the\n13 search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating plaintiffsโ\n14 Federal constitutional rights; (4) whether or not defendantsโ strip search policy and procedure is\n15 in accordance with the Federal Constitution; and (5) whether or not defendantsโ policy and\n16 procedure of conducting pre-arraignment strip searches in groups violates plaintiffsโ Federal\n17 Constitutional rights to privacy.  \n18 21. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the\n19 representative plaintiff are typical of the class.  Plaintiff was searched, prior to arraignment,\n20 without reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce drugs,\n21 weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being articulated in\n22 a supervisor-approved writing).  Representative plaintiff has the same interests and suffered the\n23 same type of injuries as all of the other class members.  Plaintiffโs claims arose because of\n24 defendantsโ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual body cavity\n25 searches before arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that\n26 the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Each class member suffered actual\n27 damages as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search.  The actual\n28 damages suffered by the representative plaintiff is similar in type and amount to the actual damages\nPage 7 of 12\nMICHAEL TODD, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al.  USDC, Eastern District, Case No. ___________\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB     Document 1     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 8 of 12(cid:10)\n1 suffered by each class member.  \n2 22. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative\n3 plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffโs interests are consistent\n4 with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.  \n5 23. In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(1)(A),\n6 prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that\n7 inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would\n8 establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the complaint.  \n9 24. In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(1)(B),\n10 prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of\n11 inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a\n12 practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to\n13 protect their interests.\n14 25. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiff is\n15 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendants have acted on grounds generally\n16 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with\n17 respect to the class as a whole.  \n18 26. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class action\n19 is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the controversy\n20 between the parties.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the interests\n21 of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action is low, in\n22 that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  Plaintiff also\n23 is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so\n24 small that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon\n25 alleges, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to represent them.  Plaintiff\n26 is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is desirable to concentrate all litigation in\n27 one forum because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., the SOLANO COUNTY Jails.\n28 It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum,\nPage 8 of 12\nMICHAEL TODD, et al. v. SOLANO COUNTY, et al.

Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff is\n3 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that the identities of the class members may be\n4 ascertained from records maintained by COUNTY OF SOLANO and by defendant SHERIFF\n5 GARY R. STANTON and the defendantsโ Sheriffโs Department.  Plaintiff is informed and\n6 believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendantsโ records reflect the identities, including addresses\n7 and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody in the SOLANO COUNTY\n8 Jails.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that records of, and maintained by\n9 defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search\n10 occurred, where the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and\n11 was recorded in a supervisor-approved writing, whether the search was conducted in a group, when\n12 persons searched were arraigned, and the charges on which such persons were arrested.  Plaintiff\n13 is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that all of the foregoing information is contained\n14 in defendantsโ computer system and that the information necessary to identify the class members,\n15 by last known addresses, and the dates and reasons for their arrests and/or release from custody,\n16 is readily available from said computer system.  \n17 28. In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(c)(2)(b), class\n18 members must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including\n19 individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiff is\n20 informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that defendantsโ computer records contain a last\n21 known address for class members.  Plaintiff contemplates that individual notice will be given to\n22 class members at such last known address by first class mail.  Plaintiff contemplates that the notice\n23 will inform class members of the following:\n24 i. The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class;\n25 ii. The nature of the action;\n26 iii. Their right to โopt outโ of the action within a given time, in which event\n27 they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action;\n28 \\\\\\\nPage 9 of 12\nMICHAEL TODD, et al. v.

Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to be represented by their own counsel\n2 and to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will be represented\n3 by the named class plaintiff(s) and the named class plaintiff(s)โ counsel;\n4 and \n5 v. Their right, if they do not โopt out,โ to share in any recovery in favor of the\n6 class, and conversely to be bound by any judgment on the common issues\n7 adverse to the class.  \n8 COUNT ONE\n9 (Violation of Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n10 on behalf of Plaintiff and all persons similarly situated)\n11 29. Plaintiff re-alleges and hereby incorporates herein the preceding paragraphs of this\n12 complaint, to the extent relevant, as if fully set forth.\n13 30. Defendantsโ policies, practices, and customs regarding the strip and visual body\n14 cavity searches complained of herein violated the rights of plaintiff, and all those similarly situated,\n15 under the Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures; violated the\n16 rights of plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, to due process and privacy under the Fourteenth\n17 Amendment; and directly and proximately damaged plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, as\n18 herein alleged, entitling plaintiff, and all class members, to recover damages for said constitutional\n19 violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\n20 WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays for relief, for himself and for all persons similarly situated,\n21 as hereunder appears.\n22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n23 WHEREFORE, plaintiff, on behalf of himself and all those similarly situated, seeks\n24 judgment as follows:\n25 1.

Defendant SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF GARY R. STANTON is, and at all \n23 material times referred to herein, was the duly elected Sheriff of SOLANO COUNTY, responsible \n24 for administering the Jail facilities and for making, overseeing, and implementing the policies, \n25 practices, and customs challenged herein relating to the operation of the SOLANO COUNTY \n26 Jails.  He is sued in his individual and official capacities. \n27 3.  Defendants SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFFโS DEPUTIES sued herein by their \n28 fictitious names (Does 1 through 100) are all deputies who, as part of their duties at the SOLANO \n2 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nTodd, et al.  v.

At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under the \n6 color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and usages \n7 of the state of California, the COUNTY OF SOLANO, and/or the SOLANO COUNTY Sheriffโs \n8 Department.  \n9 5.  Defendants whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious \n10 names of ROES 1 through 20, are all agents and/or employees of one or another of the above \n11 named defendants who ordered, condoned, authorized, covered up, or were otherwise associated \n12 with the implementation of the illegal policy and practices relating to the strip searches complained \n13 of herein.  \n14 6.  Defendant SOLANO COUNTY is, and at all material times referred to herein, was \n15 a division of the state of California, that maintained or permitted an official policy or custom or \n16 practice causing or permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which \n17 wrongs damaged plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.  Plaintiffsโ \n18 allegations against the COUNTY are based on acts and omissions of the SHERIFF and his \n19 DEPUTIES and on acts and omissions of persons who are COUNTY employees, and on the \n20 COUNTYโs breach of its duty to protect plaintiffs, and all those they represent, from the wrongful \n21 conduct of said persons and employees. \n22 7.  Defendant SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF GARY R. STANTON, in his Individual \n23 and Official Capacity, also maintained or permitted an official policy or custom of causing or \n24 permitting the occurrence of the types of wrongs complained of herein, which wrongs damaged \n25 plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, as herein alleged.   \n26 8.  Class action plaintiffs are those similarly situated who, during the period beginning \n27 two (2) years before the filing of this Complaint, and continuing to this date, were subjected by \n28 defendants to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without defendants having, \n3 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nTodd, et al.  v.

On or about September 1, 2006, plaintiff MICHAEL TODD (hereinafter referred to \n6 as โTODDโ or collectively as โplaintiffsโ) was arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs \n7 or weapons and transported to the SOLANO COUNTY Justice Center Detention Facility (a \n8 SOLANO COUNTY Jail) where, prior to arraignment, he was taken to an area where he was \n9 forced to submit to a strip search in a group with at least ten (10) other persons who were not \n10 participating in the search.  He, together with the other persons strip searched, were required to \n11 remove all of their clothing and to lift their genitals for inspection and to bend over and expose \n12 their rectal areas for individual inspection.   \n13 10.

On or about November 1, 2005, plaintiff JAMESY K. DAVIS (hereinafter referred \n16 to as โDAVISโ or collectively as โplaintiffsโ) was arrested on charges not involving violence, \n17 drugs or weapons and transported to the SOLANO COUNTY Justice Center Detention Facility (a \n18 SOLANO COUNTY Jail) where, prior to arraignment, he was taken to an area where he was \n19 forced to submit to a strip search in a room with the door open where other persons who were not \n20 participating in the search could see him being strip searched.

On or about November 18, 2005, plaintiff DEANGELA HARRIS (hereinafter \n24 referred to as โHARRISโ or collectively as โplaintiffsโ) was arrested on charges not involving \n25 violence, drugs or weapons and transported to the SOLANO COUNTY Justice Center Detention \n26 Facility (a SOLANO COUNTY Jail) where, prior to arraignment, she was taken to an area where \n27 she was forced to submit to a strip search in a group including at least two (2) other women, who \n28 were not participating in the search and forced to submit to a strip search in a room where she was \n4 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nTodd, et al.  v.

On or about June 2005, plaintiff HARRIS was arrested and transported to the \n4 SOLANO COUNTY Justice Center Detention Facility (a SOLANO COUNTY Jail) where, prior \n5 to arraignment, she was taken to an area where she was forced to submit to a strip search in a \n6 group with at least two (2) other women who were not participating in the search.  She was \n7 required to remove all of her clothing and to lift her breasts for inspection and to bend over and \n8 expose her vaginal and rectal areas for inspection.    \n9 14.  On or about August 23, 2005, plaintiff CARMEN HARRIS ROBINSON \n10 (hereinafter referred to as โROBINSONโ or collectively as โplaintiffsโ) was arrested on charges \n11 not involving violence, drugs or weapons and transported to the SOLANO COUNTY Justice \n12 Center Detention Facility (a SOLANO COUNTY Jail) where, prior to arraignment, she was taken \n13 to an area where she was forced to submit to a strip search in a room where she was required to \n14 remove all of her clothing and to lift her breasts for inspection and to bend over and expose her \n15 vaginal and rectal areas for inspection.   \n16 15.

On or about July 19, 2006, plaintiff BRADELY WOLFE (hereinafter referred to as \n23 โWOLFEโ or collectively as โplaintiffsโ) was arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or \n24 weapons and transported to the SOLANO COUNTY Justice Center Detention Facility (a \n25 SOLANO COUNTY Jail) where, prior to arraignment, he was taken to an area where he was \n26 forced to submit to a strip search in a group with at least two (2) other persons who were not \n27 participating in the search.  He and the other persons strip searched were required to remove all of \n28 their clothing and to lift their genitals for inspection and to bend over and expose their rectal areas \n5 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nTodd, et al.  v.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants routinely \n3 follow their policy, practice, and custom of subjecting pre-arraignment detainees, including \n4 plaintiffs, and all those they represent, to strip and visual body cavity searches without first having, \n5 and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches will be productive of contraband \n6 or weapons.  Plaintiffs are further informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants \n7 routinely follow their policy, practice, and custom of conducting the complained of searches in the \n8 presence of persons not participating in the searches. \n9 18.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have the \n10 ability to identify all such similarly situated plaintiffs, specifically those who, while in defendantsโ \n11 custody, at the SOLANO COUNTY Jails within two (2) years prior to the filing of this Complaint, \n12 were subjected to strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment without \n13 defendants first having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the searches would be \n14 productive of contraband or weapons. \n15 19.  Defendant SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF GARY R. STANTON is personally \n16 responsible for the promulgation and continuation of the strip search policy, practice, and custom \n17 pursuant to which plaintiffs, and all those they represent, were subjected to strip searches. \n18 20.  As a result of being subjected to the strip searches complained of herein, plaintiffs, \n19 and each of the persons similarly situated, suffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, \n20 invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law, and are entitled to recover damages \n21 according to proof but, at a minimum, $4,000 as specified in California Civil Code '' 52 and ' \n22 52.1(b). \n23   CLASS CLAIMS \n24 21.  The strip and visual body cavity searches to which plaintiffs, and all those similarly \n25 situated were subjected, were performed pursuant to policies, practices, and customs of defendants \n26 COUNTY OF SOLANO, SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF GARY R. STANTON, the individual \n27 SHERIFFโS DEPUTIES sued herein by the fictitious names 1 through 100, and the individuals \n28 whose names are not now known and who are sued by the fictitious names of ROES 1 through 20.  \n6 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nTodd, et al.  v. Solano County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 07/29/08   Page 7 of 13\n \n1 The searches complained of herein were performed without regard to the nature of the alleged \n2 offenses for which plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, had been arrested, without regard to \n3 whether or not plaintiffs, or those they represent, were eligible for cite and release under Penal \n4 Code ' 853.6, without regard to whether or not plaintiffs, and each of those similarly situated, \n5 were eligible for and/or were released on their own recognizance.  Furthermore, the searches \n6 complained of herein were performed without defendants having a reasonable belief that the \n7 plaintiffs, or any of those similarly situated, so searched possessed weapons or contraband, and \n8 those facts being articulated and recorded in a supervisor-approved document.  Finally, the \n9 searches complained of herein were performed without defendants taking reasonable precautions \n10 to insure that plaintiffs, and each of those similarly situated, were searched in an area affording \n11 privacy and was not observed by others not participating in the search.  \n12 22.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons similarly \n13 situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n14 23.  The class is defined to include all persons who, in the period from and including \n15 two (2) years prior to the filing of this Complaint, and continuing until this matter is adjudicated \n16 and the practices complained of herein cease, were arrested and subjected to a pre-arraignment \n17 strip and/or visual body cavity search at SOLANO COUNTY Jails without defendants first having, \n18 and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband \n19 or weapons. In addition, the class also includes all those persons who were subjected to pre-\n20 arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches in the presence of persons who were not \n21 participating in said searches (Group Strip Searches). \n22 24.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members of \n23 the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know the \n24 exact number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that \n25 there are more than 20 persons per day who are arrested by defendants and/or in the custody of \n26 defendants and are subjected to the searches complained of herein as a result of defendantsโ policy, \n27 practice, and custom relating to said searches.   \n28 \\\\\\ \n7 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nTodd, et al.  v.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are \n2 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of fact common to the \n3 class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants routinely subject all persons arrested to \n4 visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment whether or not they intend such persons to be \n5 housed in the SOLANO COUNTY Jails; (2) whether defendants routinely subject all persons \n6 arrested to visual body cavity searches prior to arraignment if they intend such persons to be \n7 housed in SOLANO COUNTY Jails; (3) whether persons are subjected to strip and/or visual body \n8 cavity searches prior to arraignment without there being any reasonable suspicion, based on \n9 specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular arrestee has concealed drugs, weapons, and/or \n10 contraband in bodily cavities which could be detected by means of a strip and/or visual body \n11 cavity search; (4) whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are conducted in an area of \n12 privacy so that the searches cannot be observed by persons not participating in the searches; (5) \n13 whether the strip and/or visual body cavity searches are conducted in groups; and, (6) whether the \n14 strip and/or visual body cavity searches are reasonably related to defendantsโ penological interest \n15 to maintain the security of the jail and whether or not there are less intrusive methods for \n16 protecting any such interest.  \n17 26.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are \n18 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to the \n19 class including, but not limited to: (1) whether defendants may perform strip and/or visual body \n20 cavity searches on persons prior to their arraignment without reasonable suspicion, based on \n21 specific or articulable facts, to believe any particular pre-arraignment detainee has concealed \n22 drugs, weapons and/or contraband which would likely be discovered by a strip and/or visual body \n23 cavity search; (2) whether defendants may perform strip and/or visual body cavity searches on \n24 persons without first reasonably relating the use of the subject search to defendantsโ penological \n25 interest to maintain the security of the jail and determining if there is a less intrusive method to \n26 protect that interest; (3) whether strip and/or visual body cavity searches may be conducted in \n27 areas where the search can be observed by people not participating in the search without violating \n28 plaintiffsโ Federal constitutional rights; (4) whether or not defendantsโ strip search policy and \n8 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nTodd, et al.  v. Solano County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 07/29/08   Page 9 of 13\n \n1 procedure is in accordance with the Federal Constitution; and (5) whether or not defendantsโ \n2 policy and procedure of conducting pre-arraignment strip searches in groups violates plaintiffsโ \n3 Federal Constitutional rights to privacy.   \n4 27.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of the \n5 representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Plaintiffs were strip searched, prior to \n6 arraignment, without reasonable suspicion that a strip or visual body cavity search would produce \n7 drugs, weapons or contraband (and without the facts supporting any such suspicion being \n8 articulated in a supervisor-approved writing).  Representative plaintiffs have the same interests and \n9 suffered the same type of injuries as all of the other class members.  Plaintiffsโ claims arose \n10 because of defendantsโ policy, practice, and custom of subjecting arrestees to strip and/or visual \n11 body cavity searches before arraignment without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable \n12 suspicion that the search would be productive of contraband or weapons.  Each class member \n13 suffered actual damages as a result of being subjected to a strip and/or visual body cavity search.  \n14 The actual damages suffered by representative plaintiffs are similar in type and amount to the \n15 actual damages suffered by each class member.   \n16 28.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the representative \n17 plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiffsโ interests are consistent \n18 with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.   \n19 29.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \n20 prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that \n21 inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would \n22 establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the complaint.   \n23 30.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), \n24 prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of \n25 inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a \n26 practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class to \n27 protect their interests. \n28 \\\\\\ \n9 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nTodd, et al.  v.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs are \n2 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants have acted on grounds generally \n3 applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory relief with \n4 respect to the class as a whole.   \n5 32.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class \n6 action is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the \n7 controversy between the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believes and thereupon allege, that \n8 the interests of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution of a separate action \n9 is low, in that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action at all.  \n10 Plaintiffs also are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for \n11 individuals are so small that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n12 believe, and thereupon allege, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \n13 represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is desirable to \n14 concentrate all litigation in one forum because all of the claims arise in the same location; i.e., the \n15 SOLANO COUNTY Jails.  It will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the common questions of \n16 law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.   \n17 33.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are \n18 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be \n19 ascertained from records maintained by COUNTY OF SOLANO and by defendant SHERIFF \n20 GARY R. STANTON and the defendantsโ Sheriffโs Department.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n21 believe, and thereupon allege, that defendantsโ records reflect the identities, including addresses \n22 and telephone numbers, of the persons who have been held in custody in the SOLANO COUNTY \n23 Jails.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that records of, and maintained by \n24 defendants reflect who was subject to a strip and/or visual body cavity search, when the search \n25 occurred, where the search occurred, whether any reasonable suspicion for the search existed and \n26 was recorded in a supervisor-approved writing, whether the search was conducted in a group, \n27 when persons searched were arraigned, and the charges on which such persons were arrested.  \n28 Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that all of the foregoing information is \n10 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT; DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \nTodd, et al.  v.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(c)(2)(b), class \n5 members must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including \n6 individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are \n7 informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendantsโ computer records contain a last \n8 known address for class members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to \n9 class members at such last known address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the notice \n10 will inform class members of the following: \n11 i.  The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the class; \n12 ii.  The nature of the action; \n13 iii.  Their right to  Aopt out@ of the action within a given tim e, in which \nevent they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class action; \n14\niv.

      "text": "1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n9 FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n10 MICHAEL TODD, on behalf of himself\nand all those similarly situated, \n11\nPlaintiffs,      No. CIV S-07-0726 FCD EFB\n12 vs.\n13 COUNTY OF SOLANO, SOLANO\nCOUNTY SHERIFF GARY R. STANTON,\n14 IN HIS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, \nSOLANO COUNTY SHERIFFโS DEPUTIES\n15 DOES 1 through 20, inclusive,\nORDER\n16 Defendants. \n17                                                                            /\n18 This case was before the undersigned on January 30, 2008, for hearing on defendantsโ\n19 motion to compel the California Department of Justiceโs compliance with a subpoena duces\n20 tecum pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(c)(2)(B)(1).  Specifically, defendants seek to compel\n21 information relating to plaintiffโs criminal history from the California Department of Justice\n22 (โDOJโ) on the basis that it is relevant to the claims and defenses in this suit.  \n23 This federal question case concerns claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 1983 and \n24 1988, for alleged constitutional violations by defendants in connection with strip searches at the\n25 Solano County Jails.  On October 17, 2007, defendants served a subpoena duces tecum on the\n26 custodian of records at the California DOJ.  The subpoena sought records โconcerning the\n1\n\n1 criminal history of Michael James Todd,โ the plaintiff in this action.  See Exh. A to Robertson\n2 Decl.  Notice of the subpoena was completed on all parties, including the plaintiff through his\n3 attorney of record.  \n4 Defendants seek the subpoenaed records in order to obtain an accurate and objective\n5 summary of the criminal history records of the plaintiff given the nature of the claims asserted. \n6 More specifically, a primary issue in this case is whether the strip search of plaintiff was\n7 constitutional.  In determining whether a strip search is warranted inside a jail context, officers\n8 must consider several factors, including the nature of the offense and detaineeโs prior arrest\n9 record.  See Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984), overruled on other grounds, \n10 Hodgers-Durgin v. De La Vina, 199 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 1999); Way v. County of Ventura, 445\n11 F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir. 2006).  \n12 Plaintiff has filed no objection to subpoena.  The Department of Justice has objected to\n13 production on the basis of state law.  See Cal. Pen. Code ยงยง 11175, 11076, 11105 and 11141, et\n14 seq., Cal. Civ. Code ยง 1798, et seq.; Cal. Evid. Code ยง 1040.  \n15 For the reasons stated on the record at the hearing, the court finds the DOJโs objections\n16 unavailing.  See Pagano v. Oroville Hosp., 145 F.R.D. 683, 687 (E.D. Cal. 1993); Fed. R. Civ. P.\n17 1 (โThese rules govern the procedure in the United States district courts in all suits of a civil\n18 nature. . . .โ); see also Doubleday v. Ruh, 149 F.R.D. 601, 612 (E.D. Cal. 1993) (holding that\n19 โunder principles of federalism, state legislatures are not free to legislate what a federal court\n20 may order produced in the way of documentationโ and that Cal. Pen. Code ยง 11101, et seq. did\n21 not bar plaintiff from obtaining the requested information).  \n22 ////\n23 ////\n24 ////\n25 ////\n26 ////\n2\n\n1 Accordingly, the court grants defendantsโ motion to compel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n2 45(c)(2)(B).  The DOJ shall produce the documents responsive to defendantsโ October 17, 2007,\n3 subpoena duces tecum within ten days.  \n4 SO ORDERED. \n5 DATED:  February 1, 2008.\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n3",

INTRODUCTION \n26\nOn April 16, 2007, plaintiff MICHAEL TODD f iled an action against the COUNTY OF \n27\nSOLANO, SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF GARY R, STANTON, in his individual and official \n28\ncapacities, and SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFFโS DEPUTIES sued fictitiously as DOES 1 through \n1 \nJOINT MOTION FOR ORDER APPROVING STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nTodd, et al.  v. Solano County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB   Document 37-1    Filed 09/25/09   Page 2 of 10\n \n1 100 and ROES 1 through 20.  Mr. TODD filed the action on behalf  of himself and all those  \n2 similarly situated for damages, injunctive and class relief for all persons who were strip searched at \n3 Solano County Jails, prior to arraignment, without defendants having any reasonable suspicion that \n4 the searches would be productive of contraband.  Plaintiff also alleged that defendants had a policy \n5 of conducting strip searches in ar eas which could be observed by pe rsons not participating in the \n6 searches, in violation of the 4th and 14th Amendments of the United States Constitution.   \n7 The complaint was filed as a result of Mr . TODDโs experience following his arrest on \n8 September 1, 2006, on charges not involving viol ence, drugs or weapons, following which he \n9 alleged he was transported to the Solano County Justice Center Detention Facility (Solano County \n10 Jail), and taken to an area where he submitted to a strip search in a group of several other persons \n11 who were not participating in the search.   \n12 Defendants filed a tim ely denial that plaintiff was st rip searched and/or that they had a \n13 policy or practice of which plaintiff complained. \n14 On or about July 29, 2008, afte r completing initial discovery, plaintiff filed an am ended \n15 complaint  adding f our  additional  plaintiffs,  JAMESY K. DAVIS, DEANGELA HARRIS, \n16 CARMEN HARRIS ROBINSON, and BRADLEY WOLFE who alleged that they, too, had been \n17 arrested on charges not involving violence, drug s or weapons and transported to Solano County \n18 Jail  where,  prior to a rraignment,  they were   strip  searched  in gro ups  in vio lation  of  their \n19 constitutional rights.  During the pendency of this action and, as a result of publicity that the action \n20 had been filed, a group of additional persons contacted plaintiffsโ attorneyโs office and alleged that \n21 they  fell within the allegations alleged in the complaint.   \n22 After extensive discovery, which included the depositions of all of the plaintiffs as well as \n23 depositions of twenty-four (24) officers and employees of defendants, the parties have determined \n24 that while prior to Novem ber 2003, defendants ha d a policy and practice of  strip searching all \n25 persons to be housed in Solano County Jail, often  in groups, prior to arraignm ent, they, they \n26 discovered in 2003 that the policy did not com ply with federal law and revised the policy so as to \n27 bring it into compliance with federal law and a ll custodial staff was trained in the  new policy. \n28 Specifically, Captain Ferrara issued a memorandum on July 7, 2003 to all custody staff infor ming \n2 \nJOINT MOTION FOR ORDER APPROVING STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nTodd, et al.  v. Solano County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB   Document 37-1    Filed 09/25/09   Page 3 of 10\n \n1 them of the modification of the strip search proc edures and training sessions were then conducted \n2 with all correctional officers consistent with that memorandum.  \n3 Although a revised policy was  issued on November 20, 2003,  that revision erroneously \n4 included a provision that specified that all persons going into housing would be strip searched even \n5 though it was the explicit policy of Solano County not to strip search persons merely because they \n6 were to be housed and custodial staf f had been trained not to strip search persons merely because \n7 they were to be housed unless there was reasonable suspicion for a strip search. \n8 A corrected version of the strip search policy was issued in March 2007. \n9 While persons arrested and held at the So lano County Jail may have, on occasion, bee n \n10 strip searched in violation of the defendantsโ st rip search policy, those is olated instances were \n11 unauthorized, in violation of policy, and inadvertent.   \n12 Accordingly, the parties agree that certification of this action as a class action would be \n13 inappropriate as no class, premised on the existence of a policy, practice or custom of defendants, \n14 exists and if a motion were made to certify class, that motion would most likely be denied.  Instead \n15 of further litigating this case, the parties entered into negotiations to settle the claim of the persons \n16 who contacted plaintiffsโ counselโs office and alle ged that they were st rip searched, illegally, \n17 during the period within two years  of the filing of the original TODD com plaint.  As a result o f \n18 these  negotiations the parties  reached  agreement  and now request the Court to approve a \n19 Stipulation of Settlement, a copy of which is att ached to the Declaration of Mark E. Merin  as \n20 Exhibit A, filed herewith.  This stip ulation provides for compensation to each of the individu al \n21 plaintiffs in the amount of $12,500, compensation to each of the persons listed on Exhibit 4 to the \n22 Stipulation of Settlement (attached as Exhibit  A to the Declara tion of Mark E. Merin, f iled \n23 herewith), who contacted plaintiffsโ counselโs office alleging th at they fall within the allegations \n24 alleged in the com plaint in the amount of $750  if they were brought  to Solano County Jail \n25 following arrest for a felony, or  in the amount of $1,000 if they we re arrested on a misdemeanor \n26 that falls within the s tatute of limitations and were not otherwise sub ject to strip search; and a \n27 $100,000 payment to counsel for attorn eyโs fees and costs incurred  in the prosecution of this \n28 litigation.  The settlement check shall be made payable to the Law Office of Mark E. Merin Client \n3 \nJOINT MOTION FOR ORDER APPROVING STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nTodd, et al.  v.

Mr. Merin shall deposit those funds into his Client Trust Account and shall handle \n2 the disbursement of settlement funds to representative plaintiffs and those persons listed on Exhibit \n3 4.   \n4 As  the complaint was f iled  as a class ac tion  complaint,  the parties are spe cifically \n5 requesting that the Court approve the settlement without ordering notice to be given to the persons \n6 who were housed at Solano Count y Jail prior to arraignm ent since there are no ascertainable \n7 members of a โclass.โ   \n8 II.  FACTS \nPlaintiff MICHAEL TODD was  arrested on September 1, 2006 on charges not involving \n9\nviolence, drugs or weapons and transported to Solano County Justice Center Detention Facility, a \n10\nSolano County Jail, where, prior to arraignment, he alleged he was taken to an area where he was \n11\nstrip searched in a group with several other persons  who were not officially  participating in the \n12\nsearch. \n13\nPlaintiff JAMESY K. DAVIS  on November 1, 2005, on charges not involving violence, \n14\ndrugs or weapons, transported to S olano County Jail where, prior to arraignment, he alleged he  \n15\nwas taken to an area and strip searched in a room where other individuals not participating in the \n16\nsearch could see him being strip searched. \n17\nPlaintiff  DEANGELA HARRI S  was arrested Nove mber  18, 2005, on charges not \n18\ninvolving violence, drugs or weapons, transported Solano County Jail where, prior to arraignment, \n19\nshe alleged was strip searched together with two other women who were also strip searched. \n20\nOn August 23, 2005, plaintiff CARMEN HARRI S ROBINSON was arrested on charges \n21\nnot involving violence, drugs or weapons and transported to  Solano County Jail where, prior to \n22\narraignment, she alleged she was required to su bmit to a strip search.  On February 22, 2006, Ms. \n23\nROBINSON was again arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons and alleged \n24\nshe was again strip searched at the Solano County Jail prior to arraignment. \n25\nOn July 19, 2006, BRADLEY WOLFE was arrest on charges not involving violence, drugs \n26\nor weapons, transported to Solano County Jail where, prior to arraignment, he alleged he was strip \n27\nsearched in a group with at least two other persons. \n28\n4 \nJOINT MOTION FOR ORDER APPROVING STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nTodd, et al.  v. Solano County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB   Document 37-1    Filed 09/25/09   Page 5 of 10\n \n1 The strip searches described by plaintiffs proceeded in similar fashion: \n2 They were required to remove all of their clothing and to bend over \nexposing their rectal areas for insp ection and to lift or spread their \n3 genitals for inspection. \n \n4 Defendants adamantly denied having a policy,  practice or custom, following the issuance \n5 of the memorandum by Captain Ferrara dated July 7, 2003, the training sessions and their revised \n6 policy in November 2003, of strip  searching persons going into  housing and/or strip searching \n7 persons in groups.  Defendants acknowledged, however, that prior to the change in their policy in \n8 2003, it was the practice of the ja il to strip search al l persons going into  housing since they \n9 understood that strip search to be permitted by state and federal law.  They also acknowledged that \n10 prior to the change, for convenience of the instit ution, persons were strip searched in groups if \n11 several persons were being transported into housing simultaneously.   \n12 The depositions of twenty-four (24) officers confirmed that defendantsโ representation that \n13 the strip search policy and pract ice was brought into conform ance with state and federal law in \n14 2003 and, with few exceptions, all of the deposed officers stated that they had revised their policies \n15 and practices to conform to the institutionโs requirements by the end of 2003.  Thus, if pers ons \n16 were strip searched at the Solano County Jail within two years prior to the TODD complaint, those \n17 strip searches either were performed on reasonable suspicion or in violation of defendantsโ official \n18 policies.   In any even t,  if strip s earches  occurred,  they were unrec orded,  unauthorized, and \n19 impossible to corroborate or disprove. \n20 III.  HISTORY OF THE LITIGATION \nFollowing the filing of the complaint on April 16, 2007, defendants filed a timely answer.  \n21\nThe  parties then undertook the  initiation  of discove ry  and in July, 2008,  filed  an am ended \n22\ncomplaint adding four addition plaintiffs.   \n23\nAs persons alleging that they had been stri p searched at Solano County Jail came forward \n24\nand  contacted plaintiffsโ counsel,  plaintiffs  directed interrogato ries  and written discovery to \n25\ndefendants in an attempt to corroborate the allegations of such persons.   \n26\nTo  ascertain the policies and practices of  defendants,  plaintiffs noticed and took the \n27\ndepositions of twenty-four (24) officers and agents  of defendants and pres ented named plaintiffs \n28\n5 \nJOINT MOTION FOR ORDER APPROVING STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nTodd, et al.  v. Solano County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB   Document 37-1    Filed 09/25/09   Page 6 of 10\n \n1 for deposition by defendants.  The result of such  extensive discovery was the determination that \n2 although  an erroneous written polic y  had been issued w hich  failed to include the specific  \n3 modifications which were designed to bring the strip search policy into conformance with state and \n4 federal law, custodial staff had  been appropriately trained and th eir practices conformed to state \n5 and federal law. \n6 Claims  of  being str ip  searched in violation   of  constitutional  protections  were both  \n7 exceptional and unsustainable.  In  any event, when the error in existing written policy relating to \n8 strip searches at Solano County Jail was discovered a corrected version was issued in March, 2007, \n9 fully comporting with state and federal law. \n10 IV.  THERE IS NO CLASS \nWhile plaintiffsโ versions of being strip searched at Solano County Jail often in groups are \n11\nsimilar, and suggest a pattern of illegality, va rious circumstances suggest explanations for the \n12\nplaintiffsโ claims: \n13\n1.  Many of the plaintiffs had also been  arrested prior to November, 2003, when the \n14\nSolano  County strip search polices and  practices  were revised and could be \n15\nconfusing  earlier strip   searches-outside  of  the statu te  of  limitations-with  the \n16\ncircumstances they faced when arrested on subsequent occasions.   \n17\n2.  For other plaintiffs, and indeed other pe rsons who contacted plaintiffsโ counselโs \n18\noffice complaining of being strip searched at Solano County Jails, there m ay have \n19\nbeen reasonable suspicion for thos e strip searches based either on a history of  \n20\ncriminal conduct or circumstances apparent to jail officers at the time the plaintiffs \n21\nand others were brought to the facility.   There is no way, at this point, given the \n22\npaucity of available records, either to prove or to disprove the fact of the strip \n23\nsearches or any justification-reasonable suspicion-for them. \n24\n3.  Under these circumstances, it seems highly unlikely that plaintiffs would be able to \n25\nindentify  persons who should receive no tice  of this proposed settlem ent  or \n26\notherwise  participate in ongoing litigation of   the plaintiffsโ claim s.   In short, \n27\nplaintiffs do not have sufficient information or sufficient evidence of which to move \n28\n6 \nJOINT MOTION FOR ORDER APPROVING STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nTodd, et al.  v. Solano County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB   Document 37-1    Filed 09/25/09   Page 7 of 10\n \n1 for  class certification and further disc overy  is unlikely to uncover any such \n2 evidence.  If plaintiffs were requ ired to move for class certification based on the \n3 evidence available to them, they would be unlikely to prevail. \n4 V.  TERMS OF SETLLEMENT \nDefendantsโ present policy which was issued  in March, 2007, purports to express the \n5\npolicy and practice continuously in effect since  November, 2003, and, in all respects, conforms to \n6\napplicable state and federal law.  A copy of the policy revised March 2007, is attached as Exhibit 3 \n7\nto the Stipulation of Settlement (attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Mark E. Merin, filed \n8\nherewith). \n9\nA.  Payment of Named Plaintiffs \n10\nBecause the nature and legality of the searches of plaintiffs, including whether or not they \n11\nwere strip searched and whether or not they were strip searched in areas where the search could be \n12\nseen by others, is highly contested and depends on the resolution of credibility determinations, the \n13\noutcome of a contested proceeding is uncertain.  Accordingly, the parties consider it appropriate to \n14\nresolve the named plaintiffsโ complaint by paying to each of them the sum of $12,500 in return for \n15\na dismissal with prejudice of the within complaint.   \n16\nB.  Payment to Other Persons Who Contact Plaintiffsโ Counselโs Office \n17\nPersons contacted plaintiffsโ counselโs office, upon learning of the pendency of the TODD \n18\naction, complaining that they, too, fell within th e allegations alleged in the com plaint and who \n19\nwere not otherwise subject to st rip search.  Plaintiffs have obt ained records relating to these  \n20\nindividuals, but, aside from undertaking extensive additional discovery which, if prior experience \n21\nis an indication, will not produce definitive evidence that the claimants were strip searched or that \n22\nthere  was no  reasonable suspicion  for those search es,  there  is nothing  further that could b e \n23\naccomplished to prove plaintiffs claims that they were strip searched pursuant to  defendantsโ \n24\npolicy.  Accordingly, weighing the cost of proceeding with further discovery versus compensation \n25\nfor those claimants in line with previous resolution of strip search actions, the parties have agreed \n26\nthat the persons on the list attached as Exhibit 4 to the S tipulation of Settlement (attached as \n27\nExhibit A to the Declaration of Mark E. Merin, filed herewith) will receive $750 each if they were \n28\n7 \nJOINT MOTION FOR ORDER APPROVING STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nTodd, et al.  v. Solano County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB   Document 37-1    Filed 09/25/09   Page 8 of 10\n \n1 arrested on felony charges and $1,000 each if they were arrested on misdemeanor charges.   \n2 C.  Attorneyโs Fees and Costs \n3 Throughout the litigation of this action, plaintiffsโ counsel has expended over 300 hours in \n4 the preparation and litigation of this complaint, its amendment, the discovery of relevant facts, and \n5 negotiation of a settlement and the making of this motion for approval of that settlement.  While \n6 fees at a rate of $450 per hour  would exceed $135,000, and costs to  date, expended by plaintiffsโ \n7 counsel exceed $15,000, defendants have agreed to pa y and plaintiffs have agreed  to accept the \n8 total of $100,000 in payment of attorneyโs fees and all costs associated with this litigation.  \n9 VI.  THE PARTIES REQUEST AN APPROVAL OF THE STIPULATION OF \nSETTLEMENT WHICH PROVIDES THAT NO NOTICE WILL BE GIVEN TO \n10 MEMBERS OF THE CLASS \n \n11\nRule 23(e)(1)(A) requires the Court to โapprove any settlement, voluntary dismissal, or \n12\ncompromise of the claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class period.โ   Subpart(1)(b) requires \n13\nthe Court to โdirect notice in a reas onable manner to all class m embers who will be bound by a \n14\nproposed settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise.โ  Although it m ight appear that Court \n15\napproval and notice are m andatory on dismissal or compromise of a class  suit, the authors of \n16\nNewberg on Class Actions, Fourth Edition, Section 11:66 observe that: \n17\nโOn closer analysis a notice is not mandatory on all instances but โshall be given to \n18 all  members of the class in such a  manner  as the Court directs.โ  Broadly  \ninterpreted, this language is sufficiently flexible to permit the Court to approval a \n19 dismissal or compromise by the names plaintiffs individually, but to determine that \nno class notice at all is required, when the dismissal or compromise will not result \n20\nin any prejudice to the cla ss.  Thus, generally speaki ng, while notice to the class \nwill effectuate the policies behind the rule, judicial discretion is permitted for \n21\nwithholding notice in instances when notice would issue unnecessarily or force the \n22 Court  to employ unneeded alternative  methods  to circumvent the policy when \ndismissal of the class liti gation is otherwise proper.โ  โ Four, Newberg on Class \n23 Actions, Section 11.66. \n \n24\nThis is an appropriate case for the Court to exercise its discretion by not requiring notice to \n25\nbe given of the proposed stipulated settlement for the following reasons: \n26\n1.  No class has been certif ied and, indeed, there is no ascertainable class of persons \n27\nwho were strip searched, prior to arraignment, without reasonable suspicion that \n28\nthey possessed contraband or weapons, fo r whom a class certification could be \n8 \nJOINT MOTION FOR ORDER APPROVING STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nTodd, et al.  v. Solano County, et al.; USDC, No. Dist., Case No. 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB \n\nCase 2:07-cv-00726-FCD-EFB   Document 37-1    Filed 09/25/09   Page 9 of 10\n \n1 made.  In the absence of  identifiable members of a punitive class, the pa rties have \n2 no idea as to whom notice could or should be given. \n3 2.  Settlement of named plaintiffsโ claims with payment to additional persons who \n4 contacted plaintiffsโ counselโs office is not res judicata to any other claim; no one is \n5 foreclosed from bringing an individual  action under this proposed settlem ent.  To \n6 the contrary, if there are other persons who could bring another action as a result of \n7 being illegally strip searched at Solano  County Jails, the running of the statute of  \n8 limitations on any such claim has been and will be tolled u ntil the dismissal of the \n9 TODD complaint.  Since no notices have gone out advising persons of the filing of \n10 TODDโs claim, it is unlikely that there ar e any putative plaintiffs who are relying \n11 on the pendency of the TODD action to litigate a class claim on their behalf.  It is \n12 unlikely that any persons will or could be pr ejudiced by the settlem ent of this \n13 complaint. \n14 If notice were required to be given, it would have to  be given to all persons who were \n15 housed at the Solano County Jail from the period  from April 16, 2005, to date in order to include \n16 any potential punitive plaintiff; even the giving of  such notice would be inordina tely expensive, \n17 would be unnecessary, and would likely cause  confusion among the persons who received the \n18 notice.  For all of these reasons , the parties respectfully request  the Court to exercise its sound \n19 discretion  in this instance and approve the part iesโ  negotiate stipulat ed  settlement  without \n20 imposing on the parties any notice of proposed settlement requirements. \n21 VII.   CONCLUSION \nThe parties believe that the proposed settlement of this action is both fair and reasonable.  \n22\nThe named plaintiffs are not only being compensated for their experiences for their experiences at \n23\nSolano County Jail, but also for having participated  actively in the prosecuti on of this litigation.  \n24\nFurthermore, their actions have resulted in the  clarification of the Solano County policies which \n25\nprohibit strip searches of persons merely because they are going to be housed. \n26\nAttorneyโs fees and costs were negotiated  following a tabulation of the num ber of hours \n27\ndevoted to the litigation and are less than two-thirds of what they would have been had the Court \n28\n9 \nJOINT MOTION FOR ORDER APPROVING STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT AND DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nTodd, et al.  v.
