    "summary": "<p>On May 22, 1997, several individuals who had been arrested for misdemeanors or non-criminal offenses filed a 42 U.S.C ยง 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in order to challenge the blanket strip search policy of the New York City Department of Correction (DOC).  Plaintiffs, represented by Emery Celli, claimed that the DOC's practice of strip searching every arrestee, regardless of the offense alleged and regardless of whether here was any reasonable suspicion that the arrestee was concealing weapons or contraband violated the U.S. Constitution.  To remedy the alleged constitutional violation, Plaintiffs sought compensatory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification on behalf of a class of all misdemeanor or non-criminal offense arrestees who were subjected to pre-arraignment strip searches under the DOC's blanket policy.  </p><p>The DOC answered the complaint by denying Plaintiffs' allegations.  Nevertheless, on May 27, 1997, just days after the suit was filed, the DOC officially discontinued the challenged search policy.  The DOC's new policy permitted strip searches of pre-arraignment arrestees only where there was a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee was concealing a weapon or other contraband, based on the crime charged, the particular characteristics of the detainee, or the circumstances of the arrest.</p><p>On April 13, 1998, the District Court (Judge Kimba M. Wood) certified the case as a class action.  Litigation and discovery continued for the next two years until a settlement was reached in January 2000.</p><p>Under the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, the City agreed to pay between $20 million and $50 million to settle all class claims. It was estimated that there were approximately 50,000 eligible class members.  In order to receive compensation, each class member was required to file a claim, electing one of three alternatives.  Class members who merely filled out a claim form (\"Step 1\" claimants) would be entitled to receive $250.  Class members who further claimed multiple or aggravated searches and provided authorization for an extensive search of their criminal history (\"Step 2\" claimants) would be entitled to receive up to $9,750.  Finally class members who took the further step of providing notarized authorizations for the release of their medical, psychiatric, employment, educational, and social security records and submitted to a deposition and/or psychiatric examination (\"Step 3\" claimants) would be entitled to receive a payment of up to $4250 for moderate emotional distress; up to $8,500 for serious additional emotional distress; and up to $12,500 for severe additional emotional distress.  The Stipulation provided, however, that Awards would be reduced by 50% for class members with a record of criminal conviction.  The Agreement also provided that, class counsel would be allowed to make an attorney fee application to the Court.</p><p>On July 5, 2001 the District Court (Judge John S. Martin) entered final judgment approving the class settlement.  KPMG, LLP was appointed as Class Administrator, and the processing and payment of claims continued through 2006.</p><p>Defendants initially agreed to pay class counsel a total of $800,000 as interim fees, pending the hearing on their fee application.  Though the parties thereafter settled the issue of remaining attorney's fees, the ultimate fee award is unknown as it was not reported on the PACER docket and the Court's order was unavailable.</p><p></p>",

If the total of \nall  valid  claims,  administrative  costs  and  attorneys  fees  exceeds $50,000,000,  the  amount \npayable to SCMs for each claim shall be reduced proportionately. \n24.  No payment shall be made to eligible SCMs before the Effective Date. \nClaims may be processed between the date of initial District Court approval and the Effective \nDate.  Upon the Effective Date any Step 1 processed claims may be paid.  If, upon the Effective \n ate, it appears beyond any reasonable doubt that the entire fund will not be depleted, then either \nparty may make an application to the Court for permission to pay Step 2 or Step 3 claims. \n25.  No payments shall be paid to Class Counsel for fees'and costs before the \nEffective Date except that upon signing of the Stipulation of Settlement, Class Counsel may \nmake application to the Court for interim fees and costs, and defendants are entitled to oppose as \nappropriate.  Payments to SCMs and final payments to Class Counsel for payment of fees and \ncosts  will  be  made  after  calculation  of  the  total  payment  to  SCMs,  Attorneys  Fees  and \nAdministrative  Costs to ensure that such payments, collectively, do not  exceed $50,000,000. \n\nNothing contained in this paragraph shall preclude Class Counsel from making applications for \ninterim fees and costs at any time pursuant to (T[ \"71\" below. \n26.  Each SCM shall have the right to have hisher compensation determined \nindividually by the Court.  Prior to exercising such right, SCM's shall receive a settlement offer \ndetermined by the three-step Alternative Dispute Resolution (\"ADR\")  procedure, as described \nbelow.  SCM's who are dissatisfied with the proposed compensation after the three-step ADR \nprocedure may apply to the Court for a different amount, according to the procedures set forth \nherein.  SCM's must participate in each step of the ADR procedure before exercising their right \nto an individualized determination of compensation by the Court pursuant to (T[\"58\" below \n27.  The parties agree to make an application to the Court to appoint the Expert \nPanel, the Step 3 Examiner and the Administrator as Officers of'the Court for the purposes of \nimplementing the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement.  The Expert Panel, the Step 3 Examiner \nand the Administrator shall be subject to judicial immunity to the fullest extent permitted by law. \nIV \nPROCEDURES FOR RECEIVING PAYMENT OF $250 (\"STEP 1\") \n28.  SCMs, upon timely filing of a completed and executed Form 1 whether or \nnot accompanied by any other documentation or executed authorizations, shall become entitled \nto payment of the sum of $250 in full satisfaction of all claims. \n29.  The Administrator  shall  determine  whether  or not  a person  who  has \nsubmitted Form 1 is a SCM and shall reject claims by persons who are not SCMs. \n30.  Step 1 SCMs who claim by submitting only Form 1 will receive no more \nthan $250 no matter how many times they were arrested and arraigned during the class period. \nThe City of New York will not exercise its right to reduce this amount by exercising its right of \nrecovery of public assistance payments made to claimant, unpaid City taxes including personal \n- 8 -  \n\nincome tax, real estate and real estate related taxes, tax for City employees who are not residents \n5 \npursuant to  1127 of the New York City Charter, unpaid parking tickets, unpaid Environmental \nControl Board (\"ECB\")  fines or unpaid  bills  from the New York City Health and Hospitals \nCorporation andlor delinquent child support payments.  SCMs who submit a Form 1 will do so \nwith the understanding that the City of New York must report all payments made to claimants to \nthe Internal Revenue Service. \n31.  To participate in the distribution of the $250 Step 1 Payment, a SCM shall \nbe provided by mail at histher last known address, Forms 1,2 and 3 (\"Form C\").  The SCM must \nsubmit Form 1 to the Administrator in accordance with the instructions provided therein, and \n' \nexecute the certification contained therein in order to obtain payment. \n32.  Any SCM who fails to submit Form 1 completed in accordance with the \ninstructions contained therein by the Bar Date or any court-mandated extension, shall be forever \nbarred from receiving any payments pursuant to the Stipulation of Settlement. Such SCM shall in \nall other respects be bound by all of the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement, and the Judgment \nentered herein, including but not limited to the release of all Released Persons of all claims \nresolved herein. \nv \nPROCEDURES GOVERNING CLAIMS OF SETTLEMENT \nCLASS MEMBERS WHO SEEK MORE THAN $250 \n(STEPS 2 AND 3) \n33.  SCMs who seek more than $250 shall have their claims determined in \naccordance with the criteria set forth in Steps 2,3 and 4. \nRequirements for Being Considered for Step 2 Payments \n34.  Step 2 payments will range from $0 to $9750.  In order to be considered \nfor a Step 2 award, the  SCM must complete and execute Form  1 and Form 2, including an \n- \n- 9 \n\nexecuted  authorization  for  the  release  of  New  York  City  Police,  Correction  and  Health \nDepartment records and New York State Office of Court Administration records relating to their \narrest(s) and  arraignment(s) during  the  class period;  New  York  City and  New  York  State \nDepartment of Correction records; New York City Department of Juvenile Justice records; New \nYork State Office of Children and Family Services records; and Federal Bureau of Investigation \nrecords.  If the SCM fails to execute the Form 2 authorization in its entirety, hisher Step 2 claim \nwill be denied. The Administrator may communicate with SCMs in order to obtain all required \nauthorizations and records. \n35.  An  SCM may also provide an \"Optional  Narrative Statement\" as part of \nthe Step 2 process.  An \"Optional Narrative Statement\", if submitted, may be used to describe the \nSCM's search.  If an SCM provides an \"Optional Narrative Statement,\" she may be subject to a \ndeposition if a challenge is made to the veracity of any part of such statement. \n36.  The Administrator will determine amount of each Step 2 payment based \nupon a point allocation resulting from the Administrator's review of the Step 2 claimant's Police \nDepartment, Correction Department, Department of Health and New York State Office of Court \nAdministration records;  records of prior incarceration  in New York City, New York State or \nfederal  prisons  andlor  City  and  State  secure  detention  facilities  for juvenile  offenders  as \ndescribed in ?[  \"45\"  below;  the  SCM's responses  to  the  executed Form  1 and the  Optional \nNarrative Statement provided for on Form 2. \n37.  Points as designated below will be awarded if an SCM's records show the \nfollowing: \nMultiple searches (i.e. multiple arrests) (2 or 3)  1  point \nMultiple searches (4 or more)  2  I, \n\nNon-private search \nArrest  solely  for  non  searchable  11 \noffense(s)  8 \nAcquitted of all charges \nMenstruation at time of search \nAbusive  Correction  Officer  Conduct:  11 \nOffer of Deposition Testimony  8 \nAbusive  Correction  Officer  Conduct:  II \nSupported by Narrative Statement only  4 \n38.  \"Multiple  searches\" means that the SCM was arrested on more than one \noccasion  for  misdemeanor(s)  and  non-criminal  offense(s)  and  not  simultaneously  for  any \nfelonies, and strip-searched in Central Booking in Manhattan andlor Queens more than one time \nduring the class period. One point will be awarded if there were two or three strip searches; two \npoints will be awarded if there were four or more searches. \n39.  A  \"Non-private\"  search  is  a pre-arrai,ment  strip-search conducted at \nCentral Booking in a cell, holding pen or comdor where other arrestees were actually present \nduring the search.  Two points will be awarded if at least one search was non-private. All males \n' \narrested in Manhattan will receive two points pursuant to paragraph  36 whether  or not  they \nallege a non-private search.  Any other SCM who alleges a non-private search will receive two \npoints unless the allegation of a non private search is challenged by defendants, in which case the \nSCM will be subject to a deposition. Under such~circumstances,t he issue will be determined by \nthe Special Master. \n40.  \"Menstruating\"  means that the SCM was menstruating as documented by \nDepartment of Health pre-screening medical forms. The SCM may provide independent medical \nevidence of menstruation or other contemporaneous documentation. If defendants challenge the \n\n. . \nSCM's evidence-that she was menstruating during at least one search, she shall be subject to a \ndeposition.  Under such circumstances, the issue will be detennined by the Special Master. Four \npoints will be awarded if an SCM was menstruating during at least one search. \n41.  \"Non-searchable offenses\" mean misdemeanors or non criminal offenses \nother than Administrative Code Sections 10-13  1, 10-133, 10-134, Penal Law Sections 205.20, \n220.03, 220.45, 220.50, 221.05, 221.10, 221.15, 221.35, 221.40, 240.36, 265.01,  265.06 and \nVehicle and Traffic Law section 119 2 (4). The following designations in the Police Department \nOn-Line Booking System data base represent Administrative Code sections 10-13  1 ; 10-13 3 and \n10-134: AC 0101310; AC 010131B; AC 0101330; AC 010133B; AC 0101340; AC 0101341; \nAC  0103300;  AC  1013301; AC  1013306; AC  1013100: AC  101310G; AC  1013161; AC \n1013300; AC 1013302; AC 1013303; AC 101330B; AC 101331B; AC 10133B2; AC 10133CO; \nAC 1013400; AC 1013401; AC 1C  11341E;a nd AC 101343E. In the case of a single search, eight \npoints will be awarded if all charges giving rise to the arrest were for non-searchable offenses. If \nthere were multiple searches, eight points will be awarded notwithstanding subsequent arrest(s) \nfor searchable  offenses if all  charges giving rise to  the  first  arrest were  for non-searchable \noffenses. \n42.  \"Acquittal\" means that the SCM was acquitted of all charges following all \narrai,ments  during the Class Period, andlor all charges for which the SCM was arrested during \nthe  Class  Period  were  dismissed.  Acquittal  does  not  include  or  mean  Adjournment  in \nContemplation  of Dismissal  (\"ACD;').  In  the  case  of a single  search,  eight  points  will be \nawarded  for  Acquittal.  If  there  were  multiple  searches,  eight  points  will  be  awarded \nnotwithstanding subsequent unfavorable disposition(s) if the SCM was acquitted of all charges \ngiving rise to the first arrest. \n\n43.  \"Abusive  Correction  Officer  Conduct\"  means  debasing  conduct  or \nlanguage  by  a  corrections  officer,  directed  to  the  SCM,  which  had  no  reasonable  law \nenforcement or corrections purpose.  Abusive conduct does not include, without more, treating \nI \nthe SCM in a stem manner or in a loud tone of voice.  The SCM complies with the procedure for \ndetermining whether this factor is satisfied as follows: \na.  Identification  of  Claims:  In  order  to  receive  points  for  \"Abusive \nCorrection Officer Conduct,\" the SCM's Optional Narrative Statement must describe the alleged \nabusive  conduct  with  particularity.  The  Administrator  will  review  all  Optional  Narrative \nStatements and determine which statements allege abusive conduct.  The Administrator shall \nmake  no  credibility  determinations,  but  shall  identify  all  statements  making  the  requisite \nallegations.  The Optional Narrative  Statement will  also ask the SCM whether he desires to \nvolunteer for a deposition to verify hislher claim. \nb.  Challenge:  Class Counsel and Defendants will be provided an opportunity \nto review all Optional Narrative Statements identified by the Administrator as having sufficiently \nalleged or not alleged abusive conduct.  Within a time period to be specified by the Court, Class \nCounsel and Defendants shall submit a memorandum setting forth each determination by the \nAdministrator  they believe should be challenged,  and the reasons therefor.  Class Counsel's \nchallenge may be based  on a contention that  abusive  conduct is  sufficiently alleged  in  the \nI \nOptional Narrative Statement.  Defendants'  challenge may be based on a contention that the  I \nI \nconduct did not occur andlor a contention that the conduct, even if it occurred, was not abusive \nas defined herein.  Defendants' memorandum shall also specify whether a deposition of the SCM \n.  before a Special Master is requested.  Class counsel and the SCM shall have an opportunity to \nrespond to the other's  memoranda within  a time period  to be specified by the Court.  Class \n\nCounsel and Defendants shall then meet and confer, and attempt to resolve as many disputed \nclaims as possible. \nc.  Resolution:  The Court shall review all unresolved challenges.  The Court \nmay either accept or reject the claim on the basis of the papers submitted, or may order the SCM \nto appear for deposition before a Special Master to determine the claim.  If the SCM appears for \ndeposition, defendants may produce the correction officer for deposition to rebut the claim.  The \nCourt or Special Master may consider, in  evaluating the  SCM's credibility, criminal history \nadmissible under FRE 609.  The fact that a SCM did not volunteer for a deposition will not be \nconsidered on the issue of credibility, except as to the number of points awarded, as set forth \nbelow; provided, however, that the claim for an  award of points for abusive conduct will be \nrejected if, without good cause shown, the SCM refuses to appear for deposition after previously \nvolunteering to appear or after being ordered to appear.  Defendants reserve the right to submit \nother evidence with respect to the SCM's credibility, and Class Counsel reserves the right to \noppose consideration of such evidence.  The Court's or Special Master's determination may not \nbe appealed, except as provided in Step 4.  The Court or Special Master's determination shall be \nadmissible, but not conclusive, in any Step 4 proceeding. \nd.  Points:  Eight points will be awarded if the SCM appears for deposition \nand, based on all the facts and circumstances, it appears from the record more probable than not \nthat the abusive conduct occurred.  If the SCM volunteered to appear for deposition, and hislher \nstatement is not challenged, the SCM will receive eight points.  If the SCM did not volunteer to \nappear for deposition, but is nonetheIess ordered to appear for deposition, hislher claim will be \nawarded eight points if the claim is found to be substantiated.  Four points will be awarded if \nSCM does not  volunteer  for deposition,  but  the  Optional  Narrative  Statement describes the \n\nabusive conduct with particularity, and based on all the facts and circumstances, it appears from \nthe record more probable than not that the abusive conduct occurred.  If the SCM was arrested on \nmore than one occasion, the SCM will receive \"Abusive Conduct\" points if the SCM complied \nwith the requirements of this subparagraph as to at least one search. \n44.  If a SCM, who is subject to a Step 2 deposition for seeking compensation \nfor \"Non-Private  Search\", \"Menstruating\"  or \"Abusive  Conduct by a Correction Officer\"  also \nseeks compensation  under  Step 3, the  Step 2 deposition will  be  deferred until  other Step 3 \nprocedures have been completed, and the Step 2 and Step 3 deposition will be combined into a \nsingle deposition. \n45.  The total number of Step 2 points will be reduced by half if, within five \nyears prior to hislher first pre-arraignment strip search, the SCM was subjected to a strip search \nfollowing sentencing or remand under circumstances set forth hereafter.  Such a determination \nwill be made by the Administrator if City, State or Federal criminal history or prison records \ndocument that an SCM was imprisoned in any facility after conviction of a crime, or on remand \nafter arraignment to a New York City Department of Correction facility.  Such a determination \nwill also be made if New  York City Department of Juvenile Justice andor New York  State \nOffice of Children and Family Services records identify an SCM as having been an adjudicated \nJuvenile Offender, or document that the SCM, after any arrai,gunent  as a Juvenile Offender, was \nremanded to a secure detention facility. \n46.  Points awarded in Step 2 will have the following values: \nPoints 1-5  $250 per point \nPoints 6-22  $500 per point, starting with point 6 \n47.  There will be no additional Step 2 compensation for more than 22 points. \nNo Step 2 SCM will receive more than $9,750. \n\n48.  Step 2 awards will be added to the basic $250 award. \nRequirements for Obtaining Step 3 Payments \n49.  SCMs participating in Step 3, must complete and execute Form 1, Form 2 \nand Form 3, including Step 3 authorizations for release of all applicable medical, psychiatric, \nschool and  employment records, and social security insurance records, if applicable.  Step 3 \nawards will be determined based upon the Expert Panel's agreed upon criteria for evaluating all \nof the following which are available: (i) the claimant's complete certified or authentic medical, \npsychological,  employment, school  and/or Social Security Insurance  (\"SSI\")  records  for the \n' \nperiod  from  January  1,  1996  through  the  date  of  submission;  (ii)  the  SCM's  deposition \ntranscripts, andlor the results of a psychological examination of the SCM by a court appointed \npsychologist or psychiatrist.  The Step 3 Examiner will review the records, deposition transcript \nand psychological examination results. \n50.  No SCM will be eligible to appear for a Step 3 deposition or psychological \nexamination unless she, reasonably in advance of such deposition or examination, identifies all \nmedical and/or psychological providers and all hisher employers and schools from January 1, \n1996 through the date of submission, known to himlher, states wbether or not she has applied \nfor or received Social Security Insurance (\"SSI\")  benefits during the period from January 1, 1996 \nthrough the date of submission, and authorizes the release of such records to the Administrator, \nClass Counsel and Defendants.  The SCM must state, subject to the penalties of perjury, that slhe \nhas identified all such records to the best of hisher ability.  In addition, the Step 3 Examiner will \nhave available all the Step 3 SCM's police records stemming from hisher arrest(s) prior to the \nexamination and all records of prior incarcerations. \n51.  The  Step  3  Examiner  shall  determine,  based  upon  application of the \nExpert  Panel's  pre-determined  criteria,  whether  the  SCM's  certified  records,  deposition \n- 16 - \n\ntestimony, psychological examination,  available  arrest  and  incarceration  information  and  the \nClaim Administrator's record of the Step 2 determination show that it is more likely than not that \nthe Step 3 claimant suffered emotional distress that was proximately caused by the strip search. \nThe demonstrated  emotional distress must be  greater  or last  longer  than would be normally \n(7 \nexpected for persons exposed to the factors identified in Step 2  \"37\" above). \n52.  If expert analysis of the certified medical, psychological, employment or \nschool records  andlor the deposition  shows that  the  SCM has not  experienced the  requisite \npsychological injury, the SCM will receive no Step 3 payment. Based upon application of the \nExpert Panel's criteria, the Step 3 claimant may receive a payment of up to $4250 for moderate \nemotional distress; up to $8,500 for serious additional emotional distress; and up to $12,500 for \nsevere additional emotional distress. \n53.  A SCM who claims loss of time from work or that the strip search affected \nhislher work performance, but who does not execute an authorization for the release of hislher \nemployment records from 1996 to the present will be deemed not to have missed any days of \nwork due to the effects of the search and it will be found that hisher work performance was not \naffected by the search. If a SCM claims that the strip search affected hislher school performance, \nand does not execute an authorization for the release of any school records, it will be found that \nthe search did not affect the SCM's school performance in any way. \n54.  If records, depositions or interview rebut, by a preponderance of evidence, \nthe presence of any of the Step 2 factors, the total payment may be reduced by the value of the \nStep 2 criteria shown not to be present. \n55.  If the SCM fails without good cause shown to provide all required records \nandlor authorizations, fails to appear for a scheduled deposition or psychological examination, or \n\notherwise fails to comply with orders of the Special Master, she will receive no step 3 payment. \nThe Administrator  on  its  own  initiative  or  upon  the  request  of the  Step  3  Examiner  may \ncom'municate with SCMs to obtain all authorizations and records and to schedule psychological \nexaminations and depositions. \n56.  Step 3 payments will be in addition to any payments awarded pursuant to \nSteps 1 and 2.  In order to be considered for a Step 3 payment, the SCM must complete the \nrequirements for Step 2. \n57.  Step 1-3 awards may be combined for a maximum award of $22,500. \n. \nRequirements for Obtaining Step 4 Payments \n58.  Within 45 days after receiving written notification of the Administrator's \naward, a SCM shall have the right to make a motion to the Court to increase the award.  The \nmotion  shall specify the total  amount claimed by the  SCM and shall attach all evidence in \nsupport of the request for an increased payment.  In the case of the representative plaintiffs, a \nStep 4 appeal may include an application for monetary compensation for a plaintiffs time, effort \nand expense in connection with representing the class. Upon receipt of all such motions, the \nCourt will establish a schedule for defendants to respond.  Defendants shall have the right to take \nthe SCM's deposition if not already taken; to obtain medical, psychological, employment and \nschool records if not already obtained; and to seek an order pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 35 for a \nmental examination of the SCM in order to oppose such a motion.  Defendants shall have both \nthe  right  to  oppose  any  such  motions,  and,  in  addition,  to  cross  move  to  decrease  the \nAdministrator's award. All such motions shall be determined by the Court without a jury.  The \nCourt may determine the motions on papers or, in its discretion, hold such proceedings  as it \ndeems necessary and proper.  The Court may increase or decrease the amount determined by the \n\nAdministrator if the party  seeking to  alter the  award proves  (1) by  a preponderance of the \nevidence, that the Administrator made a mathematical  error, or (2) by a preponderance of the \nevidence, that the Administrator's award is too low or too high in light of the proven damages. \nThe Court  will  determine  all timely  filed motions and  cross motions  for  adjusted payments \nsimultaneously and will assure that, after any adjustments pursuant to this provision, the total \npayments to all SCMs and Administrative Costs and Attorneys' Fees do not exceed $50,000,000. \nAttorneys'  fees incurred  in prosecuting  Step 4 claims shall be governed by 42 U.S.C.  1983; \nhowever, the SCM will be considered the prevailing party only if the amount received by the \nStep 4  claimant  exceeds the  total  amount offered  for Steps  1, 2  and  3. Attorneys  fees for \nfrivolous claims shall be governed by application of the standards set forth in Christiansburg \nGarment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978). \nVI \nGENERAL CLAIM PROCEDURES \n59.  All medical, psychiatric, psychological, school, and employment records, \nrecords protected by CPL 160.60 andlor Executive Law 502(c) obtained or generated in order to \nevaluate SCMs' claims will be confidential and will be used for no purpose other than evaluating \nSCMs' claims for this settlement. \n60.  To  receive  payment,  a  SCM  shall  be  required  to  submit  to  the \nAdministrator,  an executed  Form  1.  In order to receive a  Step 2 payment,  the  SCM must \ncomplete Form 2 including an Optional Narrative Statement if desired, in accordance with the \ninstructions provided.  In order to receive a Step 3 payment, the SCM must complete Form 3 in \naccordance with the instructions provided. All forms must be submitted by the Bar Date unless \nsuch period is extended by order of the Court. \n\n61.  Form  1,  Form  2,  and  Form  3,  accompanying  documentation  and \nauthorizations shall be mailed by first class mail and shall be deemed submitted upon deposit in a \npostpaid properly addressed wrapper, in a post office or official depository under the exclusive \ncare and custody of the United States Post Office or when received by mail or personal delivery \nto the Administrator. \n62.  If a SCM fails to provide authorizations and information  in fie manner \nrequired by the Court, this failure may result in the denial of the corresponding part of the claim. \n63.  The City will exercise its right to reduce the amount of any Step 2, 3, \nandor 4 payment by exercising its right of recovery of public assistance payments made to the \nclaimant, unpaid  City taxes, including personal  income tax, real estate and real estate related \ntaxes, tax for City employees who are not residents pursuant to  1127 of the New York City \nCharter, unpaid parking tickets, unpaid Environmental Control Board (\"ECB\")  fines, unpaid bills \nfrom  the New  York  City Health  and  Hospitals  Corporation  andlor delinquent child  support \npayments. SCMs who submit Step 2, 3, andor 4 claims do so with the understanding that the \n- \nCity of New York must report all payments made to claimants to the Internal Revenue Service. \n64.  Payments will be made to SCMs in accordance with the foregoing criteria \nwhether  or  not  the  claimants  are  subject  to  outstanding warrants.  However,  the  foregoing \nrepresentation in no way affects the validity of any outstanding warrants against SCMs. \n65.  SCMs who submit claims and whose mailed notice was not returned will \nbe paid by mail and will not be required to make a personal appearance in order to verify their \nidentities unless good cause is shown to the Court to require a personal appearance. SCMs for \nwhom there was no address or whose mailed notice was returned must personally appear before \na designee of the Administrator at a time and place to be determined by the Administrator to \n\nverify  their  identities. Those whose identities  are verified  by  the Administrator  will receive \npayment by mail. Payments will not be made to agents for SCMs other than Court appointed \nlegal representatives.  SCMs who prove  that  they  are confined  in prisons, hospitals or other \ninstitutions will not be required to report to the designated location. \n66.  SCMs who make a personal appearance as set forth in 1\" 65\" must present \none of the following forms of identification to establish their identity: (a) driver's  license; (b) \npassport  or  visa;  (c)  green  card  or  other  identification  issued  by  the  Immigration  and \nNaturalization  Service; or  (d) other  photographic' identification  card  not  readily  subject  to \nforgery. Other forms of reliable identification may be considered.  Defendants retain the right to \nrequest additional proof or to dispute any  form of identification where it  appears there  is a \nreasonable basis to believe the form of identification is fraudulent or where the SCM is unable to \nproduce other satisfactory documentation or information. In such event, notice will be provided \nto Plaintiffs' counsel within five (5) business days after discovering the basis to dispute any such \nform of identification.  If the dispute cannot be resolved among counsel, the SCM may make \napplication to the Court. \n67.  In the event an SCM for whom there was no address or whose mailed \nnotice was returned can prove that slhe resides more than 50 miles from the closest border of \nIVew York City or can prove that she is a disabled person unable to appear in person in order to \nverify hisher identity, counsel will attempt to reach an agreement as to an appropriate method \nfor verifying the SCM's identity without a personal .appearance, except that SCMs who have \npreviously been arrested for fingerprintable  offenses as defined in section 110-05 of the New \nYork City Police Department Patrol Guide and whose records are not sealed pursuant to CPL \n160.60 andlor Executive Law 502(c) may be required to provide fingerprints and a photograph in \n\norder to verify hislher identity, in a manner directed by the Administrator. If no agreement is \nreached, the SCM may make application to the Court. \nVII \nEXCLUSION FROM THE SETTLEMENT CLASS \n68.  Any potential SCM who wishes to be excluded from the Settlement Class \nmust file with the Clerk of the Court, by mail received at least forty-five (45) days before the \nFairness Hearing, or as the Court may otherwise direct, in the post office box designated for that \npurpose, a Request for Exclusion.  Originals of all Requests for Exclusion shall be retained by \nClass Counsel unless and until such originals are filed with the Court.  Named plaintiffs will not \nrequest exclusion pursuant to this paragraph. \n69.  Any potential SCM who does not timely file a Request for Exclusion shall \nconclusively  be  deemed  to  have  become  a  SCM  and  to  be  bound  by  this  Stipulation  of \nSettlement and by all subsequent proceedings, orders, and judgments herein. \n70.  The  defendants  may,  in  their  sole  discretion,  withdraw  from  'the \nStipulation of Settlement if the number of Opt-Outs exceeds 150.  Defendants will advise the \nCourt of their election within 30 days after receiving written notice of the final number of Opt- \nOuts.
