These searches, Plaintiffs alleged, were conducted on groups of 15 to 40 women at a time, in plain view of male guards, and in unsanitary and repulsive conditions.  The searches included inspections of body cavities, without regard to whether women were on their menstrual cycle.  Attack dogs were unleashed to sniff the women, while guards admonished them that the dogs would bite if drugs were discovered.  Plaintiffs claimed that such searches and conduct violated their rights under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and sought monetary damages, injunctive relief, and class certification.  On July 5, 2001, an amended complaint was filed adding three additional named plaintiffs to the lawsuit.</p><p>A settlement conference was held by the District Court (Judge John W. Darrah) on April 26, 2001.  According to the PACER docket, numerous status conferences were held thereafter until it appears that a settlement was reached.  The case was dismissed by agreement of the parties on August 22, 2001.  Terms of the settlement are unknown, but it seems to have been reached jointly with Gary v. Sheahan, JC-IL-7.</p><p>We have no further information on this case.</p><p></p>",

Morrissey,  Ltd.,  and  Robert  H.  Farley,Jr.Ltd.,and \ncomplain  of  the  Defendant  as  follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  The  plaintiffs  in  this  case  are  currently  pretrial \ndetainees  at  the  Cook  County  Department  of  Corrections  (\"Jail\"). \nEach  plaintiff  is also  a  member  of  the  class  in Gary  v.  Sheahan, \nNo.  96 C  7294, {Coar J.)  where  the  Court  found  the  Sheriff's policy \nand  practice  of  strip  searching  female  inmates  upon  returning  to \nthe  Jail  from  Court  after there was  a  judicial determination that \nthere was  no  longer  a  basis  for  their detention,  other than to be \nprocessed  for  release was  unconstitutional. \n2.  As  pretrial  detainees  at  the  Jail,  plaintiffs  were \ninitially strip searched upon  admission  to the  Jail,  and  have  been \nand  in  the  future  will  be  strip  searched  after  returning  from \n1 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/200I 1I      Page 2 of 21(cid:10)\ncourt appearances  and during random  strip searches  pursuant  to the \npolicies  and practices  at the  Jail. \n3.  Plaintiffs,  as  representatives  of  a  class  seeking \ninjunctive  relief,  are  not  challenging  the  need  to  conduct  strip \nsearches  at the  Jail  but  rather maintain  that  the  strip  searches \nare  unreasonable  because  the  strip  searches  are  conducted  in  an \nabusive  fashion  by  the  Sheriff,  are  highly  intrusive  due  to  the \nmanner  and  locations  of  the  searches,  and  afford no  privacy to the \nwomen  being  searched. \nJURSIDICTION \n4.  This  is a  Civil Action  for  injunctive  relief  to redress \ndeprivations  under  color  of  law  of  rights,  privileges,  and \nimmunities  secured  under  the  Fourth,  Eighth,  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments  to the  united States Constitution,  and  Title 42  U.S.C. \nSections  1983  and  1988. \nCLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \nS.(a)  Plaintiffs bring this action as a  class action pursuant \nto Rule  23(b)(2)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil Procedure. \n(b)  The  Class  consist of all female  persons who  have  been  and \nin  the  future  will  be  strip searched  upon  admission  to the  Jail, \nafter  returning  from  court  appearances  and  during  random  strip \nsearches  pursuant  to  the  policies  and  practices  at  the  Jail. \nC  The  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  persons  is \nimpracticable.  The  practice  and  policy  at  the  Jail  is  to  strip \nsearch  all  female  inmates  when  admitted  to  the  Jail,  upon  their \nreturn  to  the  Jail  from  Court  and  during  random  strip  searches. \n2 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/2001     Page 3 of 21(cid:10)\nPlaintiffs believe that the class probably  numbers  well  over  1,000 \nfemale  inmates. \n(d)  Plaintiffs will  fairly and  adequately protect the  interest \nof  all  class  members  as  they  are  members  of  the  class  and  their \nclaims  are typical  of  the claims  of  all class members.  Each  of  the \nplaintiffs is incensed at the treatment  accorded  the  class members \nand  will  aggressively  pursue  the  interests  of  the  entire  class. \nPlaintiffs'  interest  in  obtaining  injunctive  relief  for  the \nviolations  of  constitutional  rights  and  privileges  are consistent \nwith  and  not  antagonistic to those  of  any  person within  the  class. \n(e)  The  prosecution of  separate actions by  individual members \nof  the  class  would  create  a  risk  of  inconsistent  or  varying \nadjudications with  respect to individual members  of  the class which \nwould  establish  incompatible  standards  of  conduct  for  the  party \nopposing  the  class. \nFACTS  AND  PARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff Crystal Wilkes  is a  citizen of  the  United States \nand  resident  of  the  State  of  Illinois.  Since  October  17,2000,  Ms. \nWilkes  has  been  an  inmate  at  the  Cook  County  Department  of \nCorrections,  awaiting trial on  a  felony  charge.  Her  next court date \nis  set  for  March  23,2001. \n7.  Plaintiff Sharon  Davis  Hollister is a  citizen of  the United \nStates  and  a  resident  of  the  State  of  Illinois.  Since  October \n19,2000,  Ms.  Hollister  has  been  an  inmate  at  the  Cook  County \nDepartment  of  Corrections,  awaiting  trial on  a  felony  charge.  Her \nnext  court  date  is March  20,2001. \n3 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/2001     Page 4 of 21(cid:10)\n8.  Plaintiff Tonya  Townsend  is a  citizen of  the  United  States \nand  a  resident  of  the  State  of  Illinois.  Since  February  15,2001, \nMs.Townsend  has  been  an  inmate  at  the  Cook  County  Department  of \nCorrections,  awaiting  trial on  a  felony  charge.  Her  next court date \nis March  15,2001. \n9.  Defendant MICHAEL  SHEAHAN  (Sheahan)  is an  elected county \nofficial whose  duties  include  implementing  and  executing  policies \nconcerning the  operation of the Cook County  Jail  (Jail)  pursuant  to \n55  ILCS  5/3-15003.  At  all times  relevant hereto,  Sheahan was  acting \nunder  color  of  law. \n10.  On  February  15,2001,  plaintiff  Townsend  was  taken  into \nยทcustody  of  the Sheriff's Office  at the  Jail and  placed  in a  bullpen \nin  the  Receiving  Area  of  the  Jail  with  approximately  38  other \nwomen. \n11.  During the time  period the  plaintiff was  in this bullpen, \nthe  canine  unit  entered  the  bullpen  and  the  handlers  for  the  dogs \ninformed  the women  that the dogs  would  attack and  bite the women  if \nthey  detected any  contraband.  The  dogs  were  then  unleashed  by  the \nguards  and  proceeded to  sniff and  search  each  female  inmate. \n12.  Plaintiff  and  the  other  women  in  the  bullpen  were  then \nescorted by  three  or  four  female  guards  to a  gymnasium  area where \nthe  strip  search  was  conducted.  The  gym  is  an  open  area  with  a \nbalcony.  It  is  not  uncommon  for  male  guards  to  enter  the  gym \nunannounced  during  strip searches. \n13.  Upon  entering the  gym,  the plaintiff and  the  other women \nwere  ordered to forms  lines and  rows  with  four  inmates  to a  line. \n4 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/2001     Page 5 of 21(cid:10)\nPursuant  to the  standard  policy  and  practice  of  the  Sheriff,  the \nplaintiff was  required to submit  to the  following  strip search: \n(A)  The  plaintiff was  ordered to remove  all her  clothing; \n(B)  After  removing  all  her  clothing,  she  was  required  to \nopen  her mouth,  lift her breast,  and  to run  her  hands  through  her \nhair; \n(e)  While  naked,  the  plaintiff was  required  to  spread  her \nbuttock and  bend  and  squat  three  times  while  coughing.  Due  to the \nfact  that  some  of  the women  were  unable  to \"properlyยท  perform this \ntask,  the plaintiff was  required  to repeat  the  process  nine  times. \n14.  At  the  time  of  the  strip  search,  Ms.  Townsend  was  on \nher menstrual  cycle.  Regardless  of  this  fact,  she was  required to \nremove  her  pad  and  perform  the  above  stated  strip  search with  no \nprotection.  At  least  two  other  women  in  the  group  were  also  on \ntheir  menstrual  cycle,  and  as  a  result  the  plaintiff  saw  blood \nrunning  down  their legs on to the  floor  of  the  gym.  When  the  strip \nsearches  were  completed,  these  women  were  yelled  at  the  by  the \nguards  to clean up  their blood. \n15.  The  strip searches were  conducted under conditions which \nwere  unhealthy  and  unsanitary.  Two  of  the  women  were  sick  and \nvomiting,  presumable  from withdrawal  symptoms.  There  was  a  strong, \nnauseous  odor  in  the  gym  during  the  strip  search  which  was \nextremely unpleasant.  The  guards  made  frequent  derogatory  remarks \nabout  the  lack of  hygiene  of  the women  and  called them whores  and \nbitches. \n16.  Plaintiff saw  one  of the  guards violently kick and pull \n5 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/2001     Page 6 of 21(cid:10)\nup  one  of  the women  who  was  sick and  lying  on  the  floor  of  gym. \n17.  Since  entering  the  Jail,  Plaintiff  Townsend  has  been \nsubjected  to  one  other  strip  search  in  the  day  area  of  the  tier \nunder  circumstances  similar  to  the  situations  described  in \nparagraphs  13-16. \n18.  On  October  17,2000,  Plaintiff Crystal Wilkes  was  taken \ninto  custody  of  the  Sheriff's  Office  at the  Jail  and  placed  in a \nbullpen  in  the  Receiving  Area  of  the  Jail  with  approximately  40 \nother women. \n19.  Subsequently,  Plaintiff Wilkes  was  moved  into another \nbullpen  room  with  other  female  inmates.  One  of  the  walls  in  this \nroom  was  made  of  glass  which  provided  no  privacy.  This  room  is \nsituated in an  area with other similar rooms  and  there  are  cameras \nwhich  are positioned to observe  the inmates.  The  glass  wall  of  the \nroom  looks  out  onto a  hallway.  This  hallway  is frequently  traversed \nby  male  guards  and  male  inmates. \n20.  The  bullpen area used to strip search Plaintiff Wilkes \nwas  filthy.  The  toilet  was  overflowing,  there  was  urine,  human \nexcrement,  food  particles and  paper  on  the  floor.  The  smell  of  the \nbullpen was  so  bad  it made  the  plaintiff nauseous. \n21.  During  the  strip search,  the  guards  called the  women \nderogatory  names  such  as  bitches  and  whores.  Women  who  were \noverweight  or  had  large breast were  singled out  by  the  guards  and \nrequired  to  lift the  folds  of  their stomachs  and  breasts. \n22.  While  the  plaintiff  was  being  strip  searched,  she \nobserved  a  male  guard  enter  the  area  where  the  women  were  being \n6 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/2001     Page 7 of 21(cid:10)\nsearched. \n23.  One  of  the women  being  strip searched was  vomiting during \nthe  strip search process.  Afterwards  she  laid on  the  floor  of  the \nbullpen until a  guard  kicked  her  and  told her to get  her \"ass\"  up. \n24.  During her period of  incarceration,  Plaintiff Wilkes  has \nbeen  strip  searched  approximately  ten  times.  These  searches  have \nbeen  conducted  in  a  manner  similar  to what  has  been  described  in \nparagraphs  21  through  23  when  she  has  returned to the  Jail after a \ncourt  appearance  or during  random  strip searches  on  her  tier.  The \nlocations  of  the  searches  include  the  gym,  clothing  room  and  day \narea of  her tier. \n25.  On  October  19,2000,  Plaintiff Sharon Hollister was  taken \ninto  custody  of  the  Sheriff's  Office  at the  Jail  and  placed  in  a \nbullpen  in the  Receiving Area  of  the  Jail. \n26.  Plaintiff  Hollister  and  the  other  women  in  the  bullpen \nwere  then  escorted  by  three  or  four  female  guards  to  a  gymnasium \narea where  the  strip search was  conducted. \n27.  Ms.  Hollister  was  then  strip  searched  under  the  same \nconditions  as  previously described  in paragraphs  13  through  23. \n28.  During her period of  incarceration,  Plaintiff Hollister \nhas  been  strip  searched  approximately  nine  times.  These  searches \nhave  been conducted  in a  manner  similar to what  has  been described \nin paragraphs  13  through  24  when  she  returned to the  Jail after a \ncourt  appearance  or during  random  strip searches  on  her tier.  The \nlocations  of  the  searches  include  the  gym,  clothing  room  and  day \narea of  her  tier. \n7 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/2001     Page 8 of 21(cid:10)\nCOUNT  ONE \n1-28.  Plaintiffs reallge paragraphs  1-28  above  as  paragraphs \n1-28  of  Count  I. \n29.  At  all times  relevant  to this complaint,  the defendant, \nas Sheriff  of Cook  County  has  the  duty  to establish procedures  and \npolicies  and  to train deputy  sheriffs and  C.C.D.O.C.  employees  to \nprevent  unreasonable  body  searches  of  individuals  and  to  prevent \nstrip searches  of  female  inmates  from being performed  in an  abusive \nfashion,  under  conditions  which  are  unsanitary  and  provide  no \nprotection  of  privacy to the women  during .the  searches. \n30.  Defendant  SHEAHAN  knew  or should  have  known  that  female \ninmates  are  subjected  to  highly  intrusive  strip  searches  which \nafford  no  privacy  to  female  inmates  and  which  are  conduct  under \nunsanitary,  filthy conditions,  and  are  carried out  by  his deputies \nin an  abusive manner. \n31.  Defendant  SHEAHAN  instituted,  sanctioned,  and  approved \nthe  following  policies,  practices,  customs,  and  procedures \nregarding the  strip searching of  female  individuals who  are  in the \ncustody  of  the  Cook  County  Department  of  Corrections; \nA.  Female  inmates  are routinely strip searched upon  entry to \nthe  Jail,  after  returning  from  court  appearances  and \nduring  random  strip searches  in the  housing  divisions. \nB.  The  canine  unit  at the  Jail makes  random  inspections  of \nthe  newly  admitted  inmates  to  the  Jail  prior  to  and  at \n8 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/2001     Page 9 of 21(cid:10)\nthe  time  while  women  are  in  the  process  of  being  strip \nsearched.  The  guard  dogs  enter  the  bullpens  where  the \nfemale  inmates  are  held without  restraints and proceed \nto sniff and  search  female  inmates  for  contraband,  after \nthe Sheriff deputies  inform the women  that the dogs  will \nattack and  bite the women  if drugs  are detected. \nc.  The  strip searches are conducted  in groups  of between  15 \nand  40  inmates  which  affords  no  privacy to the women. \nD.  The  areas in which  the  strip searches  are administered by \nthe  Sheriff  are  dirty,  foul  smelling  and  subject  to \nviewing  by  male  guards  and  male  inmates.  At  times  the \nstrip searches are conducted in bullpens  located  in the \nReceiving  area of  the  Jail.  The  walls  of  these bullpens \nare made  of glass  and provide  no  privacy.  The  glass wall \nof  the  room  looks  out  onto  a  hallway.  The  hallway  is \nfrequently  traversed  by  male  and  female  C.C.D.O.C. \nemployees. (Exhibit A,  p.1S) \nE.  The  foul  smell  and  odor  in the  areas where  the women  are \nstrip  searched  is  so  retched  and  putrid  that  even  the \nguards  conducting the  searches  admit  that it makes  them \nnauseous  and  has  caused one  to almost  vomit.  (Exhibit A. \np.  15;  Exhibit B.  p.17) \nF.  The  physical conditions under which  the women  are  strip \nsearched  are  unclean  and  unsanitary.  In  the  bullpen \nareas,  the  toilets are  frequently  overflowing,  there  is \nurine,  human  excrement,  blood,  food  and  paper  on  the \n9 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/2001     Page 10 of 21(cid:10)\nfloors. \nG.  Pursuant  to  the  standard  policy  and  practice  of  the \nSheriff,  the  plaintiff  was  required  to  submit  to  the \nfollowing  strip search under  the  above  conditions: \n(1)  The women  are order to get  in lines containing  three or \nfour  inmates  arms  length apart; \n(2)  The  women  are  then  ordered  to  remove  all  of  their \nclothing; \n(3)  After removing  all their clothing,  the women  are required \nto  open  their  mouths,  lift their  breasts,  and  to  run \ntheir hands  through  their hair. \nH.  Regardless  of whether women  are on  their menstrual cycle, \nthey are required to remove  their sanitary napkin  and perform \nthe  strip search without  any  protection.  Frequently women  on \ntheir  menstrual  cycle  are  exposed  to  the  embarrassment  of \nhaving  blood  running  down  their  legs  and  onto  the  floor. \n(Exhibit  A.p.16).  In  addition,  the  other women  in the  group \nare  subjected  to  potential  infection  from  these  bodily \nfluids. \nI.  During  the  strip  searches  of  the  female  inmates,  the \nguards  frequently  call the women  derogatory  names  and  single \nout  women  that  are  overweight  or  who  have  large  breasts  to \nlift the  folds  of  their stomachs  and  breasts. \n32.  The  Sheriff  failed  to  establish  appropriate  procedures \nand practices to ensure  that female  inmates  are  not  subjected \nto unreasonable  body  searches. \n10 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/2001     Page 11 of 21(cid:10)\n33.  The  Sheriff  failed to properly train and  supervise  the \ndeputy  sheriffs and  C.C.D.O.C.  employees  responsible  for conducting \nbody  searches  of  inmates  to  prevent  unreasonable  body  searches. \n34.  The  strip search  of  plaintiffs under  the above  describe \nabusive  conditions  constitutes  deliberate  indifference  to  the \nrights  of  the  plaintiffs  in  violation  of  the  Fourth,  Eighth  and \nFourteenth Amendments  to the  u.S.  Constitution. \n36.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  Sheriff's \npolicies,  practices and  procedures,  in his  official capacity,  the \ndefendant  subjected  the  Plaintiffs  and  members  of  the  class  to \nunreasonable  body  searches  which  were  demeaning,  dehumanizing, \nundignified,  humiliating,  terrifying,  unpleasant,  embarrassing, \nrepulsive,  signifying degradation  and  submission. \n37.  Unless  immediately,  preliminarily  and  permanently \nenjoined  from  continuing  to  subject  females  inmates  from  abusive \nstrip  searches  defendant  will  continue  to  engage  in  the  willful, \nwanton  and  deliberate  violation  of  the  constitutional  rights  of \nfemales,  and  plaintiffs and members  of  the  class will  continue  to \nsuffer  gross  violations  of  their constitutional  rights  and  gross \nindignities,  each  of which  constitutes  irreparable injury for  which \nplaintiffs  have  no  adequate  remedy  at law. \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiffs PRAY  that this Court  enter  an  order: \n1.  Finding  that  this  action  should  proceed  as  a  class \naction  pursuant  to  Rule  23(b) (2) ,of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil \nProcedure~ \n2.  Preliminarily and permanently restraining,  enjoining and \n11 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 1     Filed 03/07/2001     Page 12 of 21(cid:10)\nprohibiting defendant  from  undertaking,  enforcing,  maintaining  or \nadopting  any  policies,  procedures,  practices  or acts by which  any \nfemale  inmate  is  subjected  to  an  abusive  strip  search  without \nconsideration  for  the  privacy  interest  of  the  female  and  the \nconditions  under which  the  strip search is conducted. \n3.

The  plaintiffs in this case  are  former  pretrial detainees \nat the Cook  County  Department  of Corrections  (\"Jail\").  As  pretrial \ndetainees  at  the  Jail,  plaintiffs  were  initially  strip  searched \nupon  admission  to  the  Jail,  and  after  returning  from  court \nappearances  and  during  random  strip  searches  pursuant  to  the \npolicies  and  practices  at the  Jail. \n2.  This  is a  Civil Action to redress  deprivations  under  color \nof  law  of  rights,  privileges,  and  immunities  secured  under  the \nFourth,  Eighth,  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  united  States \nConstitution,  and  Title 42  U.S.C.  Sections  1983  and  1988. \n1 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 23     Filed 07/05/2001     Page 3 of 10\n3.  Plaintiff Crystal Wilkes  is a  citizen of  the  United  States \nand  resident of  the  State of  Illinois.  Ms.  Wilkes  was  an  inmate  at \nthe  Cook  County  Department  of  Corrections. \n4.  Plaintiff Sharon Davis  Hollister is a  citizen of  the United \nStates  and  a  resident  of  the  State  of  Illinois.  Ms.  Hollister was \nan  inmate  at the  Cook  County  Department  of  Corrections. \n5.  Plaintiff Tonya  Townsend  is a  citizen of  the  United  States \nand a  resident of the State of  Illinois.  MS.Townsend  was  an  inmate \nat the Cook  County  Department  of  Corrections. \n6.  Plaintiff Sherille Maynie  is a  citizen of the United States \nand resident  of  the State of  Illinois.  She was  admitted  to the  Jail \non  March  19,2001  and  released  on  May  2,2001. \n7.  Plaintiff  Kristine  Ricks  is a  citizen of  the  United  States \nand  a  resident  of  the  State  of  Illinois.  She  was  admitted  to  the \nJail on  May  21,2000  and  released on  May  22,2000 \n8.  Plaintiff Marvella Evertt  is a  citizen of  the United States \nand  a  resident  of  the  State of  Illinois.  She  was  an  inmate  at the \nCook  County  Department  of  Corrections. \n9.  Defendant MICHAEL  SHEAHAN  (Sheahan)  is an  elected county \nofficial whose  duties  include  implementing  and  executing policies \nconcerning the operation of  the Cook  County  Jail  (Jail)  pursuant  to \n55  ILCS  5/3-15003.  At  all times  relevant  hereto,  Sheahan was  acting \nunder  color  of  law. \n10.  On  February  15,2001,  plaintiff  Townsend  was  taken  into \ncustody of  the Sheriff's Office at the Jail and  placed in a  bullpen \nin  the  Receiving  Area  of  the  Jail  with  approximately  38  other \n2 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 23     Filed 07/05/2001     Page 4 of 10\n\". \nwomen. \n11.  During  the time period the  plaintiff was  in this bullpen, \nthe canine  unit  entered the  bullpen  and  the  handlers  for  the  dogs \ninformed the women  that the dogs  would  attack and  bite the women  if \nthey  detected any  contraband.  The  dogs  were  then  unleashed  by  the \nguards  and  proceeded  to  sniff and  search  each  female  inmate. \n12.  Plaintiff  and  the  other  women  in  the  bullpen  were  then \nescorted by  three or  four  female  guards  to a  gymnasium  area where \nthe  strip  search  was  conducted.  The  gym  is  an  open  area  with  a \nbalcony.  It  is  not  uncommon  for  male  guards  to  enter  the  gym \nunannounced  during  strip searches. \n13.  Upon  entering the  gym,  the  plaintiff and  the  other women \nwere  ordered to forms  lines and  rows  with  four  inmates  to a  line. \nPursuant  to  the  standard  policy  and  practice  of  the  Sheriff,  the \nplaintiff was  required to submit  to the  following  strip search: \n(A)  The  plaintiff was  ordered to  remove  all her  clothing; \n(B)  After  removing  all  her  clothing,  she  was  required  to \nopen  her mouth,  lift her  breast,  and  to run  her  hands  through  her \nhair; \n(e)  While  naked,  the  plaintiff was  required  to  spread  her \nbuttock and  bend  and  squat  three  times  while  coughing.  Due  to the \nfact  that  some  of  the women  were  unable  to \"properly\"  perform this \ntask,  the plaintiff was  required to repeat  the  process  nine  times. \n14.  At  the  time  of  the  strip  search,  Ms.  Townsend  was  on \nher menstrual  cycle.  Regardless  of  this  fact,  she  was  required  to \nremove  her  pad  and  perform  the  above  stated  strip  search  with  no \n3 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 23     Filed 07/05/2001     Page 5 of 10\nprotection.  At  least  two  other  women  in  the  group  were  also  on \ntheir  menstrual  cycle,  and  as  a  result  the  plaintiff  saw  blood \nrunning  down  their legs  on  to the  floor  of  the  gym.  When  the  strip \nsearches  were  completed,  these  women  were  yelled  at  the  by  the \nguards  to clean up  their blood. \n15.  The  strip searches were  conducted under conditions which \nwere  unhealthy  and  unsanitary.  Two  of  the  women  were  sick  and \nvomiting,  presumable  from withdrawal  symptoms.  There  was  a  strong, \nnauseous  odor  in  the  gym  during  the  strip  search  which  was \nextremely  unpleasant.  The  guards  made  frequent  derogatory  remarks \nabout  the  lack of  hygiene  of  the women  and  called them whores  and \nbitches. \n16.  Plaintiff  saw  one  of  the guards  violently kick and  pull \nup  one  of  the women  who  was  sick and  lying on  the  floor  of  gym. \n17.  Since  entering the  Jail,  Plaintiff  Townsend  has  been \nsubjected  to  one  other  strip  search  in  the  day  area  of  the  tier \nunder  circumstances  similar  to  the  situations  described  in \nparagraphs  13-16. \n18.  On  October  17,2000,  Plaintiff Crystal Wilkes  was  taken \ninto  custody  of  the  Sheriff's  Office  at the  Jail  and  placed  in  a \nbullpen  in  the  Receiving  Area  of  the  Jail  with  approximately  40 \nother women. \n19.  plaintiff Wilkes  was  strip searched  under  conditions \nwhich  provided no  privacy. \n20.  On  October  19,2000,  Plaintiff Sharon  Hollister was  taken \ninto  custody  of  the  Sheriff's  Office  at  the  Jail  and  placed  in  a \n4 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 23     Filed 07/05/2001     Page 6 of 10\nbullpen  in the Receiving Area  of  the  Jail. \n21.  Plaintiff Hollister was  subsequently  strip searched under \nconditions which  provided  no  privacy. \n22.  Plaintiffs Sherrile Maynie,  Kristine  Ricks,  and  Marvella \nEverett  were  also  strip  searched  while  incarcerated  at  the  Jail \nunder  conditions which  provided  no  privacy. \nCOUNT  ONE \n1-22.  Plaintiffs reallge paragraphs  1-22  above  as  paragraphs \n1-22  of  Count  I. \n23.  At  all times  relevant  to this complaint,  the defendant, \nas  Sheriff  of  Cook  County  has  the  duty  to  establish procedures  and \npolicies  and  to train deputy  sheriffs  and  C.C.D.O.C.  employees  to \nprevent  unreasonable  body  searches  of  individuals  and  to  prevent \nstrip searches  of  female  inmates  from  being performed  in an  abusive \nfashion,  under  conditions  which  are  unsanitary  and  provide  no \nprotection  of  privacy  to the women  during  the  searches. \n24.  Defendant SHEAHAN  knew  or  should  have  known  that  female \ninmates  are  subjected  to  highly  intrusive  strip  searches  which \nafford  no  privacy  to  female  inmates  and  which  are  conduct  under \nunsanitary,  filthy  conditions,  and  are  carried out  by  his  deputies \nin an  abusive manner. \n25.  Defendant  SHEAHAN  instituted,  sanctioned,  and  approved \nthe  following  policies,  practices,  customs,  and  procedures \nregarding the  strip searching of  female  individuals who  are  in  the \ncustody  of  the  Cook  County  Department  of  Corrections1 \n5 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 23     Filed 07/05/2001     Page 7 of 10\nA.  Female  inmates  are routinely strip searched upon  entry to \nthe  Jail,  after  returning  from  court  appearances  and \nduring  random  strip searches  in the  housing  divisions. \nB.  The  canine  unit  at the  Jail makes  random  inspections  of \nthe  newly  admitted  inmates  to  the  Jail  prior  to  and  at \nthe  time  while  women  are  in  the  process  of  being  strip \nsearched.  The  guard  dogs  enter  the  bullpens  where  the \nfemale  inmates  are  held without  restraints  and  proceed \nto sniff and  search  female  inmates  for  contraband,  after \nthe Sheriff deputies  inform the women  that the  dogs  will \nattack and  bite the women  if drugs  are  detected. \nc. \nThe  strip searches are conducted  in groups  of  between  15 \nand  40  inmates  which  affords  no  privacy  to the women. \nD.  The  areas  in which the  strip searches  are  administered by \nthe  Sheriff  are  dirty,  foul  smelling  and  subject  to \nviewing  by male  guards  and  male  inmates. \nE.  The  foul  smell  and  odor  in the  areas where  the women  are \nstrip  searched  is  so  retched  and  putrid  that  even  the \nguards  conducting the  searches  admit  that  it makes  them \nnauseous  and  has  caused  one  to almost  vomit. \nF.  The  physical conditions under  which  the women  are  strip \nsearched  are  unclean  and  unsanitary.  In  the  bullpen \nareas,  the  toilets  are  frequently  overflowing,  there  is \nurine,  human  excrement,  blood,  food  and  paper  on  the \nfloors. \nG.  Pursuant  to  the  standard  policy  and  practice  of  the \n6 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 23     Filed 07/05/2001     Page 8 of 10\nยท -. \nSheriff,  the  plaintiff  was  required  to  submit  to  the \nfollowing  strip search  under  the  above  conditions: \n(1)  The women  are order to get  in lines containing  three or \nfour  inmates  arms  length  apart; \n(2)  The  women  are  then  ordered  to  remove  all  of  their \nclothing; \n(3)  After removing  all their clothing,  the women  are  required \nto  open  their  mouths,  lift their  breasts,  and  to  run \ntheir hands  through  their hair. \nH.  Regardless  of whether women  are  on  their menstrual  cycle, \nthey are  required to remove  their sanitary napkin  and  perform \nthe  strip search without  any  protection.  Frequently women  on \ntheir  menstrual  cycle  are  exposed  to  the  embarrassment  of \nhaving  blood  running  down  their  legs  and  onto  the  floor.  In \naddition,  the  other  women  in  the  group  are  subjected  to \npotential  infection  from  these  bodily  fluids. \nI.  During  the  strip  searches  of  the  female  inmates,  the \nguards  frequently  call the women  derogatory  names  and  single \nout  women  that  are  overweight  or  who  have  large  breasts  to \nlift the  folds  of  their  stomachs  and  breasts. \n26.  The  Sheriff  failed  to  establish  appropriate  procedures \nand  practices  to  ensure  that  female  inmates  are  not  subjected  to \nunreasonable  body  searches. \n27.  The  Sheriff  failed  to properly train and  supervise  the \ndeputy  sheriffs and  C.C.D.O.C.  employees  responsible  for  conducting \nbody  searches  of  inmates  to  prevent  unreasonable  body  searches. \n7 \n\nCase 1:01-cv-01592     Document 23     Filed 07/05/2001     Page 9 of 10\n,  -. \n28.  The  strip search  of  plaintiffs under  the  above  describe \nabusive  conditions  constitutes  deliberate  indifference  to  the \nrights  Qf  the  plaintiffs  in  violation  of  the  Fourth,  Eighth  and \nu.s. \nFourteenth Amendments  to the  Constitution. \n29.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  Sheriff's \npolicies,  practices and  procedures,  in his  official capacity,  the \ndefendant  subjected  the  Plaintiffs  and  members  of  the  class  to \nunreasonable  body  searches  which  were  demeaning,  dehumanizing, \nundignified,  humiliating,  terrifying,  unpleasant,  embarrassing, \nrepulsive,  signifying  degradation  and  submission.  The  plaintiffs \nsuffered great  emotional  pain,  humiliation  and  embarrassment. \nWHEREFORE,  plaintiffs  pray  that  this  Court  enter  an  order \nawarding  monetary  damages  to plaintiffs in  an  amount  in excess  of \nfifty  thousand  dollars.  In  addition,  award  the  plaintiffs  and \nmembers  of  the class their costs and attorney's  fees  under Title  42 \nU.S.C.  Sect.  1988. \nThomas G. Morrissey, Ltd. \nRobert H.
