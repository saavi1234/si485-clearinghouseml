The Court was not aware, at that time, that this case was previously referred to mediation by the District Court and that a mediator had already been appointed.

    "summary": "<p>On May 5, 2006, Plaintiffs, represented by several private law firms, filed a 42 U.S.C. 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York, challenging the constitutionality of the Niagara County Sheriff's blanket strip search policy.  Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that, following their arrests for petty crimes, they were subjected to the Sheriff's blanket policy of strip-searching all individuals who entered the Niagara County Jail, regardless of the crime for which they were charged and despite the absence of reasonable suspicion to believe that they were concealing weapons or contraband.  Plaintiffs claimed that such a policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  To remedy the alleged violation, they requested that the court issue declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary and punitive damages, and class certification.  Defendants answered by generally denying all allegations.</p><p>The case was assigned to District Judge William M. Skretny, who subsequently assigned it to Magistrate Judge Hugh B. Scott for handling of pre-trial proceedings.  Magistrate Judge Scott entered a scheduling order on August 2, 2006, and discovery ensued.</p><p>On July 6, 2007, Plaintiffs moved for class certification and Defendants opposed the motion. At the time of this summary, the certification issue was still pending before the Court.</p>",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT     \nWESTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nDEDRICK WILLIAMS, MARQUESSA PAGE,\nCAMILLE SMITH individually and\non behalf of a Class of others similarly\nsituated,  \nPlaintiffs,\n   DECISION AND ORDER\nv.              06-CV-291A\nTHE COUNTY OF NIAGARA, et al.,\nDefendants.\nBACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs move for class certification in this action, pursuant to Rule 23 of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, alleging federal civil rights violations stemming\nfrom defendant Niagara County's alleged practice and policy of strip searching all\npretrial detainees admitted to the Niagara County Jail (“NCJ”) on charges of\nmisdemeanors or lesser crimes, regardless of whether there was reasonable suspicion\nthat such detainees possessed contraband or weapons.  Plaintiffs rely on Second\nCircuit precedent holding that “persons charged with a misdemeanor and remanded to\na local correctional facility . . . have a right to be free of a strip search absent\nreasonable suspicion that they are carrying contraband or weapons[.]”  Shain v. Ellison,\n273 F.3d 56, 66 (2d Cir.2001).  The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,\nclass certification, compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees.\n\nPlaintiffs seek certification of the following class:\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of he\nNiagara County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations,\nviolations or probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or\nother minor crimes and were or will be strip searched upon their entry into\nthe Niagara County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the\nNiagara County Sheriff’s Department and the County of Niagara. The\nclass period commences on May 5, 2003 and extends to the date on\nwhich the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department and/or the County of\nNiagara are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their\nunconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting strip searches\nabsent reasonable suspicion. Specifically excluded from the class are\nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal\nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.  \nPlaintiffs request that the Court certify this action as a money damages\nclass action under Rule 23(b)(3) and/or an injunctive relief class action under Rule\n23(b)(2).  In the alternative, plaintiff requests partial certification under Rule 23(c)(4). \nThe defendants contend that they have two different policies with regard\nto the search of incoming detainees at the NCJ, depending on the location in Niagara\nCounty from which the detainee is received.  Pursuant to Policy 1109, all detainees\nreceived from the City of Niagara Falls, City of Lockport and City of North Tonawanda\nare stripped searched and subject to a body cavity search, regardless of the crime\ncharged and without reasonable suspicion.  Defendants argue that because such\ndetainees are initially detained in a city facility upon their arrest (e.g., City of Niagara\nFalls Police Department), they are already in the “system” and are therefore subject to\nstrip and body cavity searches pursuant to the Second Circuit’s decision in Covino v.\nPatrissi, 967 F.2d 73 (2d Cir. 1992) (random body cavity searches of prison inmates is\nconstitutional because such searches are related to legitimate penological interests and\ninmates did not show reasonable alternatives would be fully effective).  In other words,\n2\n\nfor the purpose of being subject to strip and body cavity searches, defendants equate\nsuch detainees to prison inmates.\nThe second policy, Policy 1201, applies to all other detainees arrested in\nany other part of Niagara County and brought directly to the NCJ.  For example,\nsomeone arrested in the Town of Lewiston is brought directly to the NCJ.  Under Policy\n1201, such detainees are not automatically subject to being strip searched.  Instead,\nthey are subject to being strip searched only if there is reasonable suspicion that they\npossess contraband or a weapon.  All such detainees are, however, subject to a\n“clothing change-out” procedure, whereby they must change into a jail uniform. \nDefendants argue that such a procedure does not constitute a strip search and is\nconstitutional.  \nWith regard to Policy 1109, plaintiffs reply that detainees are not the\nequivalent of prison inmates and therefore Covino does not apply.  See Iqbal v. Hasty,\n490 F.3d 143, 170-72 (2d Cir. 2007) (distinguishing between Shain and Covino based\non the type of facility involved).   With regard to Policy 1201, plaintiffs argue that the\n“clothing change-out” procedure is the equivalent of a strip search and is therefore\nunconstitutional.  Kelsey v. County of Schoharie, 2007 WL 603406 at *6 (N.D.N.Y. Feb.\n21, 2007) (denying county defendant’s motion for summary judgment that clothing\nexchange procedure was constitutional as there were disputed issues of fact as to\nwhether the detainees were required to disrobe in front of  correctional officers, who\nprobably observed the inmates' bodies) (citing Marriott v. County of Montgomery, 227\nF.R.D. 159, 169 (N.D.N.Y.2005), aff'd, 2005 WL 3117194 (2d Cir. Nov. 22, 2005).\nFor the reasons stated, the Court grants class certification, but not of the\n3\n\nclass proposed by the plaintiffs.  Instead, the Court certifies two separate classes, one\nfor detainees strip searched pursuant to Policy 1109 and one for  detainees subject\nonly to the “clothing change-out” procedure under Policy 1201.  \nDISCUSSION\n A. Applicable Law\nThe certification of class actions is governed by Rule 23, provides in\npertinent part: \n(a) Prerequisites. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as\nrepresentative parties on behalf of all members only if:\n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable;\n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;\n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and\n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class.\n(b) Types of Class Actions. A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a)\nis satisfied and if:\n* * *\n(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act\non grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final\ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is\nappropriate respecting the class as a whole; or\n(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common\nto class members predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members, and that a class action is superior\nto other available methods for fairly and efficiently\n4\n\nadjudicating the controversy. The matters pertinent to these\nfindings include:\n(A) the class members' interests in individually\ncontrolling the prosecution or defense of\nseparate actions;\n(B) the extent and nature of any litigation\nconcerning the controversy already begun by\nor against class members;\n(C) the desirability or undesirability of\nconcentrating the litigation of the claims in the\nparticular forum; and\n(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class\naction.\n(c) Certification Order; Notice to Class Members; Judgment; Issues\nClasses; Subclasses.\n* * *\n(4) Particular Issues. When appropriate, an action may be\nbrought or maintained as a class action with respect to\nparticular issues.\nMost courts that have addressed class certification in the jail strip search\ncontext have proceeded under Rule 23(b)(3).  See, e.g.,  In re Nassau County Strip\nSearch Cases, 461 F.3d 219, 225 (2d Cir. 2006); Mitchell v. County of Clinton, 2007\nWL 1988716 (N.D.N.Y. Jul. 5, 2007).  In order to achieve class certification pursuant to\nRule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs must (1) satisfy the four requirements of Rule 23(a), which are\nnumerosity, typicality, commonality, and adequacy of representation; (2) demonstrate\nthat common “questions of law or fact” predominate over “any questions affecting only\nindividual members”; and (3) establish that the class action mechanism is “superior to\nother available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.”  In re\n5\n\nNassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at 225 (internal quotations and citation\nomitted) (reversing district court’s denial of class certification motion in jail strip search\ncase).\nB. Numerosity\nThe numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1) is satisfied by a showing\nthat, due to the number of potential class members, joinder of individual members as\nnamed plaintiffs would be impracticable.  See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde\nPark, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir.1995).  In the case at bar, the numerosity of plaintiff's\nproposed class is supported by the deposition testimony of Niagara County Sheriff\nThomas Beilen, who testified that the daily capacity of the NCJ is 500 detainees, and\nthat the NCJ processes about 5,500 detainees annually.  As part of discovery,\ndefendants have proffered booking data for over 13,000 misdemeanor detentions. \nPlaintiffs estimate the class size to be over 8,000 individuals.  The numerosity\nrequirement is met.  \nC. Commonality\nUnder Rule 23(a)(2), plaintiff must also show commonality, that is, that the\naction raises an issue of law or fact common to the class.  See Robinson v. Metro-North\nCommuter R.R., 267 F.3d 147, 155 (2d Cir.2001).  The Court finds that the class\nproposed by the plaintiffs fails to meet the commonality requirement as there are\nsignificant factual differences between the Policy 1109 detainees and the Policy 1201\n6\n\ndetainees.  The defendants admit that the Policy 1109 detainees are automatically\nsubjected to a strip and body cavity search.  Whether such a policy is constitutional will\npresumably be a matter of law.  Policy 1201 detainees, on the other hand, are subject\nonly to the “clothing change-out” procedure, and there are disputed issues of fact as to\nexactly what happens during that procedure, e.g., whether or not the jail personnel view\nthe detainees as they are changing.  Because the two different sets of detainees, Policy\n1109 detainees and Policy 1201 detainees, were subject to two different procedures,\nthe Court finds that they should constitute two separate classes.  Dividing the proposed\nclass into two separate classes will enhance the commonality of the factual issues in\neach class.\nD. Typicality\nThe typicality factor, set forth in Rule 23(a)(3), concerns whether the claim\nof the class representative is typical of the claims of the class.  See Robinson, 267 F.3d\nat 155.  Plaintiff must show that each class member's claim “arises from the same\ncourse of events, and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the\ndefendant's liability.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Here, the named plaintiffs claim that they\nwere misdemeanor detainees, that they were strip searched without reasonable\nsuspicion pursuant to defendants' Policy 1109, that Policy 1109 was unconstitutional,\nand that defendants are liable.  Their claims thus arise from the same course of events\nand are based on the same legal arguments as the claims of every other Policy 1109\ndetainee class member.  Therefore, the requirement of typicality is met with regard to\nPolicy 1109 detainees.  \n7\n\nWith regard to Policy 1201, however, there is no named plaintiff who was\n“searched” pursuant to that Policy.  The Court shall allow plaintiffs and their counsel 60\ndays to locate a class representative to represent the Policy 1201 detainees.  \nE. Adequacy of Representation\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the class representative “fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class.”  Adequate representation depends on two factors: (a)\nthe plaintiff’s attorney must be qualified, experienced and generally able to conduct the\nproposed litigation; and (b) the class members, and especially the representative party,\nmust not have interests antagonistic to one another.  In re Joint Eastern and Southern\nDist. Asbestos Litigation, 78 F.3d 764, 778 (2d. Cir. 1996).  Both prerequisites of\nadequacy of representation are met in the instant case.  Plaintiffs’ attorneys have\nextensive experience in this type of litigation, and there is no indication that the class\nmembers would have interests antagonistic to one another.\nF. Predominance and Superior Method\nThe Court finds that the plaintiffs have met the requirements of Rule\n23(b)(3) because they have shown that common questions predominate over questions\naffecting individual plaintiffs, and that a class action is the best method of adjudicating\nthis case.\nThe predominance requirement tests whether proposed classes are\n“sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.”  Amchem Prods. Inc. v.\n8\n\nWindsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623 (1997).  A plaintiff must show that the issues in the class\naction that are subject to generalized proof-and thus applicable to the class as a\nwhole-predominate over those issues that are subject only to individualized proof.  See\nIn re Visa Check/Master Money Antitrust Litig., 280 F.3d 124, 136 (2d Cir. 2001).\nHere, the questions of whether the alleged policies and practice of the\nNCJ existed, whether they were unconstitutional, and whether defendants are liable are\nsubject to generalized proof and are common to all potential class members.  These\nissues predominate over those issues that are subject to individualized proof.  In re\nNassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d at 228.  Moreover, the division of the\nproposed class into two separate classes heightens the predominance of issues\ncommon to the class members in each of the respective classes.\nFurther, a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair\nand efficient adjudication of this controversy. “[W]hen plaintiffs are allegedly aggrieved\nby a single policy of defendants, such as the blanket policy at issue here, the case\npresents precisely the type of situation for which the class action device is suited since\nmany nearly identical litigations can be adjudicated in unison.”  Id. at  228 (internal\nquotations and citation omitted).  Given the size of the class and the predominance of\nissues subject to generalized proof, the class action procedure will increase the\nefficiency of the litigation and the uniformity of the outcome.  In addition, under the\ncircumstances of this case, it is unlikely that many members of the class would have the\nresources or desire to pursue their claims individually in separate actions.  Nor is it likely\nthat separate actions would result in better outcomes for the claimants.  In light of the\nnature of the issues and the flexibility accorded to courts in handling class actions, it is\n9\n\nunlikely that the management of this case as a class action will present inordinate\ndifficulties.  Mitchell, 2007 WL 1988716 at *5.\nG. Rules 23(b)(2) and 23(c)(4)\nHaving determined to certify the class under Rule 23(b)(3), the Court need\nnot consider whether certification under Rule 23(b)(2) or partial certification under Rule\n23(c)(4) would also be appropriate.  In re Nassau County Strip Search Cases, 461 F.3d\nat 230 n. 4.1\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated herein, the Court grants plaintiffs’ motion for class\ncertification, and it is therefore\nORDERED that the following two classes are certified:\nClass One - Policy 1109 Detainees\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of he\nNiagara County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations,\nviolations or probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or\nother minor crimes, and having been committed to the Niagara County\nJail based on criminal charges originating in the cities of Niagara Falls,\nNorth Tonawanda and Lockport, and were or will be strip searched upon\ntheir entry into the Niagara County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom and\npractice of the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department and the County of\nNiagara. The class period commences on May 5, 2003 and extends to the\ndate on which the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department and/or the County\nof Niagara are enjoined from, or otherwise cease, enforcing their\n1 In their memorandum of law in support of the motion for class certification,\nplaintiffs “suggest” that the defendants be required to assist plaintiffs’ counsel in providing\nnotice to the absent class members.  It is the Court’s hope that counsel will be able to work this\nout amongst themselves without Court intervention.  \n10\n\nunconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting strip searches\nabsent reasonable suspicion. Specifically excluded from the class are\nDefendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal\nrepresentatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.  \nClass Two - Policy 1201 Detainees\nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of he\nNiagara County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, violations,\nviolations or probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil commitments or\nother minor crimes, and having been committed to the Niagara County\nJail based on criminal charges originating in jurisdictions outside of the\ncities of Niagara Falls, North Tonawanda and Lockport, and were or will\nbe strip searched upon their entry into the Niagara County Jail pursuant to\nthe policy, custom and practice of the Niagara County Sheriff’s\nDepartment and the County of Niagara. The class period commences on\nMay 5, 2003 and extends to the date on which the Niagara County\nSheriff’s Department and/or the County of Niagara are enjoined from, or\notherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, practice and\ncustom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable suspicion.\nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendants and any and all of\ntheir respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors,\nemployees or assignees; \nand it is further\nORDERED that plaintiffs’ attorneys of record are appointed as class\ncounsel pursuant to Rule 23(g); and it is further \nORDERED that plaintiffs shall have 60 days from the date of this Order to\nidentify and move for the intervention of a class representative for the class\ndenominated “Class Two - Policy 1201 Detainees”; and it is further \nORDERED that this case is referred back to Magistrate Judge Hugh B.\nScott pursuant to the nondispositive referral order filed July 21, 2006.  \n11\n\nSO ORDERED.\ns/ Richard J.

For at least the past several years, the Niagara County Sheriff's Department \nhas had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the Niagara County Jail and are \nplaced in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon which they are charged. Upon information \nand belief, this policy is, in part, derived from the written procedures of the Niagara County \nSheriff's  Department,  and  was  promulgated  by  senior  Department  officials;  specifically, \nDefendants Thomas Beilein, Samuel Muscarella, and John Saxton. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals charged \nwith misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized suspicion that \nthey possess weapons or contraband. In fact, several judges in this Judicial District, as well as the \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 2 of 20(cid:10)\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, have recently held that blanket strip \nsearch policies/practices like those in dispute in this case are unconstitutional. In short, the policy \nof Niagara County and the Niagara County Sheriff's Department forcing those charged with \nminor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Niagara County Jail \nis not only clearly illegal, but is degrading, insensitive and unnecessary.  \nDedrick Williams, Marquessa Page and Camile Smith (together, the “Representative \nPlaintiffs”) bring this action on behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class of thousands of \nothers who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and \nunnecessary violation of their civil rights and those of the class members they propose to \nrepresent. They seek monetary damages for themselves and each member of the proposed class, \na  declaration  that  the  Sheriff's  Department's  policies/practices  are  unconstitutional,  and  an \ninjunction  precluding  Niagara  County  and  the  Niagara  County  Sheriff's  Department  from \ncontinuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody. With this as a background, the \nRepresentative Plaintiffs, through counsel, hereby complain as follows:  \n \nJURISDICTION \n1.   This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 US.C. §§ \n1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive damages, and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 US.C. §§ 1981 & 1983. \nThis Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 US.C. § 2201, as it is \nfiled  to  obtain  declaratory  relief  relative  to  the  Constitutionality  of  the  policies  of  a  local \ngovernment.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 3 of 20(cid:10)\n2.   Venue is proper under 28 US.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to \nPlaintiff's claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district. \n \nPARTIES \n3.   Plaintiff Dedrick Williams (\"Williams\") resides in Niagara County, New York. \nOn March 5, 2005, Williams had his bail illegally revoked by Niagara City Court Judge Robert \nRestaino regarding pending charges for assault in the third degree and endangering the welfare \nof a child, both misdemeanors.  \n4.   Plaintiff Marquessa Page (“Page”) resides in Niagara County, New York.  In May \nand December of 2005, Page was arrested on misdemeanor charges of failure to pay parking \ntickets and failure to appear in court, respectively. \n5.  Plaintiff Camile Smith (“Smith”) resides in Niagara County, New York.  In June \n2006, Smith was arrested on misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct. \n7.  Defendant County of Niagara (the \"County\") is a county government organized \nand existing under the laws of the State of New York. At all times relevant hereto, the County, \nacting through its Sheriff's Department, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, \nimplementation  and  conduct  of  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  Niagara  County  Jail  and  was \nresponsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriff's Department \npersonnel, including those working in the Niagara County Jail. In addition, at all relevant times, \nthe County was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Niagara County Jail, and for ensuring \nthat Sheriff's Department personnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States and of the State of New York.  \n8.   The  Niagara  County  Sheriff's  Department  (the  \"Sheriff's  Department\")  is  a \n3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 4 of 20(cid:10)\nCounty Sheriff's Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York. \nAlthough not a legal entity for the purposes of litigation, the Department is listed as a party for \nthe  purposes  of  identification.  At  all  times  relevant  hereto,  the  Sheriff's  Department  was \nresponsible for operating, organizing, overseeing and administering the Niagara County Jail \n(\"NCJ\"). At all times relevant hereto, Defendant Sheriff's Department, together with the County \nof Niagara, was responsible for the polices, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct \nof  all  matters  pertaining  to  the  NCJ,  and  was  responsible  for  the  appointment,  training, \nsupervision and conduct of all Sheriff's Department personnel, including those working in the \nNCJ.  In addition, at all times relevant hereto, Defendant Sheriff's Department, together with the \nCounty of Niagara, was responsible for enforcing the rules of the Niagara County Jail, and for \nensuring that Sheriff's Department personnel employed in the NCJ obeyed the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States and of the State of New York. \n9.  Defendant  Thomas  Beilein  (\"Sheriff  Beilein\")  is  the  duly  elected  Sheriff  of \nNiagara County, and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-trial and \nother  detainees  over  which  the  NCJ  exercises  custodial  or  other  control.  Sheriff  Beilein's \nprincipal place of business is 5526 Niagara Street Extension, Lockport, NY 14095. Sheriff \nBeilein is made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official capacities.  \n10.  Defendant Samuel Muscarella (\"Undersheriff Muscarella\") is the duly appointed \nUndersheriff of Niagara County and, as such, is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of \npre-trial  and  other  detainees  over  which  the  NCJ  exercises  custodial  or  other  control. \nUndersheriff  Muscarella's  principal  place  of  business  is  5526  Niagara  Street  Extension, \nLockport, NY 14095. Undersheriff Muscarella is made a Defendant in this action in both his \nindividual and official capacities.  \n4 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 5 of 20(cid:10)\n11.  Defendant John Saxton (\"Major Saxton\") is the duly appointed Major of the \nNiagara County Sheriff's Department and is the officer in charge of the operation of the Niagara \nCounty Jail. As such, Major Saxton is a policy maker with respect to the treatment of pre-trial \nand other detainees over which the NCJ exercises custodial or other control. Major Saxton's \nprincipal place of business is 5526 Niagara Street Extension, Lockport, NY 14095. Major Saxton \nis made a Defendant in this action in both his individual and official capacities.  \n12.  Collectively, Sheriff Beilein, Undersheriff Muscarella, and Major Saxton will be \nreferred to as the \"Policy Making Defendants.\"  \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n13.  The  Representative  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  pursuant  to  Rules  23(b)(1), \n23(b)(2) and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a \nclass of similarly situated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and \nwere strip searched upon their entry into the Niagara County Jail.  \n14.  The class that the Representative Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows:  \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of \nthe Niagara County Jail after being charged with misdemeanors, \nviolations,  violations  of  probation  or  parole,  traffic  infractions, \ncivil commitments or other minor crimes and were or will be strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Niagara County Jail pursuant to \nthe policy, custom and practice of the Niagara County Sheriff's \nDepartment  and  the  County  of  Niagara.  The  class  period \ncommences on May 5, 2003 and extends to the date on which the \nNiagara County Sheriff's Department and/or the County of Niagara \nare  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise  cease,  enforcing  their \nunconstitutional policy, practice and custom of conducting strip \nsearches absent reasonable suspicion. Specifically excluded from \nthe  class  are  Defendants  and  any  and  all  of  their  respective \naffiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,  employees  or \nassignees.  \n5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 6 of 20(cid:10)\n \n15.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder  Federal  law  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and  adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \n16.  The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon  information  and  belief,  there  are  hundreds  of  people  arrested  for  misdemeanors  and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Niagara County Jail every month - all of whom \nare members of the proposed class. Upon information and belief, the size of the proposed class \ntotals at least 4,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on multiple \noccasions.  \n17.  Upon information and belief, joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable \nbecause of the large number of class members and the fact that class members are likely \ndispersed over a large geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of \nNiagara County and this Judicial District. Furthermore, upon information and belief, many \nmembers of the class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have \ngreat difficulty in pursuing their rights individually.  \n18.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants' conducting \nstrip searches absent particularized suspicion. All members of the class were charged with \nmisdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Niagara County Jail, and all \nwere illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established law in this judicial circuit.  \n19.  The Representative Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of \nthe Class.  The Representative Plaintiffs and all members of the class sustained damages arising \n6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 7 of 20(cid:10)\nout of Defendants' course of conduct. The harms suffered by the Representative Plaintiffs are \ntypical of the harms suffered by the class members.  \n20.  The Representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  The Representative \nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class.  \n21.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in the \nprosecution of class action and civil rights litigation. The Representative Plaintiffs are being \nrepresented  by  Elmer  Robert  Keach,  III;  Bruce  Menken  and  Jason  Rozger  of  Berenbaum \nMenken & Ben-Asher, LLP; Gary E. Mason, Alexander E. Barnett and Nicholas Migliaccio of \nThe Mason Law Firm, PLLC; David Gerald Jay of Buffalo, New York, and Jonathan Cuneo and \nCharles LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP.  Proposed class counsel has successfully \nprosecuted several strip search class actions identical to that detailed in this action, and have \nbeen found to be adequate class counsel on several occasions by other courts. \n26.  In  short,  Plaintiffs’  counsel  has  the  resources,  expertise  and  experience  to \nsuccessfully  prosecute  this  action  against  Niagara  County,  the  Niagara  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants. Counsel for Plaintiffs knows of no conflicts \namong members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class.  \n27.  This  action,  in  part,  seeks  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief.  As  such,  the \nRepresentative Plaintiffs seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b )(2), in that all class \nmembers were subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals \ncharged with misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Niagara County \nJail. In short, the County of Niagara, the Niagara County Sheriffs Department, the Policy Making \n7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 8 of 20(cid:10)\nDefendants and Niagara County Corrections Officers acted on grounds generally applicable to all \nclass members.  \n28.  In  addition  to  certification  under  Rule  23(b)(2),  and  in  the  alternative,  the \nRepresentative Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).  \n29.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class. These common \nquestions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and predominate question of \nwhether the Defendants' written and/or de facto policy/practice of strip searching all individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to the Niagara County Jail is a \nviolation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and \nwhether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the class period.  \n30.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the class is \nimpracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are dispersed over a \nlarge geographical area. Furthermore, the expense and burden of individual litigation would \nmake it difficult or impossible for individual members of the class to redress the wrongs done to \nthem. The cost to the federal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would be \nenormous. Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and \nthe court system. By contrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents \nfar fewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, \nand protects the rights of each member of the Class.  \n8 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 9 of 20(cid:10)\n31.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though the \nDefendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for the past several years.  \n32.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), the Representative \nPlaintiffs also seeks partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n33.   The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, \nsuch as the Policy Making Defendants in this action and the Corrections Officers they supervise, \nfrom performing strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other \nminor crimes unless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing \na weapon or contraband.  \n34.  Upon information and belief, the County of Niagara, the Niagara County Sheriff's \nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, \ncustom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Niagara County \nJail (by forcing them to remove their clothing for a visual inspection of their bodies and/or \nforcing them to submit to a visual inspection of their body cavities) and are placed into jail \nclothing, regardless of the nature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband. For purposes of \nthis Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively referred to as \"strip searches.\"  \n35.  The County of Niagara, the Niagara County Sheriff's Department, and the Policy \nMaking Defendants know that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy \n9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 10 of 20(cid:10)\nor  practice  of  conducting  strip  searches  without  particularized,  reasonable  suspicion.  This \njudicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may not strip search individuals charged \nwith misdemeanors or violations absent particularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle \nbeing clearly established in 1986 by Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986) and recently \naffirmed by Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001), cert. denied sub. nom, Nassau Co. v. \nShain, 537 U.S. 1083 (2002).  \n36.  The Defendants' written and/or de facto policy, practice and custom mandating \nwholesale  strip  searches  of  all  misdemeanor  and  violation  arrestees  has  been  promulgated, \neffectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established law.  \n37.  Reasonable  suspicion  to  conduct  a  strip  search  may  only  emanate  from  the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, the \nparticular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.  \n38.  Upon information and belief, the County of Niagara, the Niagara County Sheriff's \nDepartment and Policy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or \nfailed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all \nindividuals placed into the custody of the Niagara County Jail and placed into jail clothing \nwithout any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed suspicion of any sort. This written \nand/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pretrial detainees routine; neither the nature of \nthe offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest \nwere relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches.  \n39.  Pursuant  to  this  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  each  member  of  the  Class, \nincluding the Representative Plaintiffs, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto  the  Niagara  County  Jail.  These  searches  were  conducted  without  inquiry  into  or \n10 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 11 of 20(cid:10)\nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion. \nStrip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other  innocuous  offenses, \nDriving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing.  \n40.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant \nto this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches each member of \nthe class, including the Representative Plaintiffs - have suffered or will suffer psychological \npain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.  \n \nFacts Applicable to Dedrick Williams \n41.   Dedrick Williams' experience is representative of the class at large. On March 5, \n2005, Mr. Williams had his bail revoked on misdemeanor charges of Assault in the Third Degree \nand Endangering the Welfare of a Child by Niagara City Court Judge Robert Restaino. Mr. \nWilliams was then arrested and placed in the Niagara County Jail until being ordered released a \nfew hours later. The circumstances of Mr. Williams' criminal charges are related to a domestic \ndispute, and the circumstances of his revocation of bail are that he was one of several individuals \nordered illegally jailed by Judge Restaino after a wrist watch (believed to be a cell phone) went \noff in Judge Restaino's courtroom. In an effort to identify the individual with the cell phone, \nJudge  Restaino  proceeded  to  illegally  revoke  the  bail  of  several  individuals  present  in  his \ncourtroom that day.  \n42.   At  approximately  5:00  PM  on  or  about  March  5,  2005,  Ms.  Williams  was \ntransported to the Niagara County Jail. A short time later, Mr. Williams was moved into a \nshower area in the Niagara County Jail and ordered to disrobe. As a Corrections Officer watched, \nMr. Williams removed all of his clothing, including his underpants.  \n11 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 12 of 20(cid:10)\n43.   A Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. Williams lift his testicles, turn around, \nbend at the waist, spread the lobes of his buttocks and squat while coughing, with the Corrections \nOfficer conducting a visual inspection of Mr. Williams' genitals and rectal cavity. Williams was \nthen provided with a j ail uniform after taking a shower.  \n44.   On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that Mr. \nWilliams was concealing a weapon or other contraband. Indeed, no inquiry was made of Mr. \nWilliams that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  \n45.   On several other occasions during the class period, Williams was taken to the \nNiagara County Jail on minor criminal charges (for example, driving without a license) and \nsubject to a strip search identical or nearly identical to that detailed above.  \n46.   As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant \nto County and Sheriff's Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Williams has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n  \nFacts Applicable to Marquessa Page \n47.  In May 2005, Marquessa Page was arrested at the Niagara Falls Police Station on \nmisdemeanor charges of failing to pay parking tickets.  Bail was set at $500, the amount of the \nparking tickets, and Ms. Page was taken to the Niagara County Jail.   \n48.  After being placed in a holding cell, a female Corrections Officer took Ms. Page \nto a shower room where she was strip searched.  As part of the search, Ms. Page was required to \nlift her breasts and “bend over and spread” to allow the Corrections Officer to inspect her genital \narea.   \n12 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 13 of 20(cid:10)\n49.  Ms. Page was then required to change into the Jail jumpsuit, also under the \nsupervision of the Corrections Officer.   \n50.  Two days later, her bail was posted and Ms. Page was released from the facility.   \n51.  On or about December 26, 2005, Ms. Page was arrested at the Niagara County \nJail while visiting a detainee on misdemeanor charges of failing to appear in court.  Ms. Page \nwas transported to the court located in the Niagara Police Department, and after bail was set she \nwas taken back to the County Jail.   \n52.  Ms.  Page  was  strip  searched  for  a  second  time  and  in  the  same  manner  as \nfollowed her May 2005 arrest.   \n53.  Nine days later, Ms. Page was released after paying a fine. \n \nFacts Applicable to Camile Smith \n54.  In June 2006, Camile Smith was arrested at the Niagara Falls Police Station on \nmisdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct.  Ms. Smith was seven months pregnant at the time.  \n55.  From the Police Station, officers transported Ms. Smith to the Niagara County \nJail.  As part of the admission process, Ms. Smith was taken to a shower room and required to \nundress completely so that she could be searched.   \n56.  A Corrections Officer checked Ms. Smith’s mouth, ears, and hair.  Ms. Smith then \nhad to lift her breasts for inspection and was then ordered to “bend over and spread” so that the \nCorrections Officer could inspect her genital area.  She was then required to change into the Jail \njumpsuit in front of a Corrections Officer.   \n57.  Ms. Smith was released several hours later, and the misdemeanor charges were \neventually dismissed.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 14 of 20(cid:10)\n \nCAUSES OF ACTION  \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS  \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law  \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law— \n \n58.  The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in the preceding paragraphs. \n59.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens from \nunreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from conducting strip \nsearches  of  individuals  arrested  for  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent  some  particularized \nsuspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or weapons.  \n60.  The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nUnited States Constitution. Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Niagara County \nCorrections Officers to strip search Plaintiffs and class members based on their arrests for \nmisdemeanor/violation charges. It was also not objectively reasonable for the Policy Making \nDefendants to order/direct Niagara County Corrections Officers to conduct such searches. These \nstrip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice of the County of \nNiagara and the Niagara County Sheriff's Department. As such, the County of Niagara is directly \nliable for the damages of the Representative Plaintiffs and members of the Class.  \n66.   Upon information and belief, Sheriff Beilein, Undersheriff Muscarella and Major \nSaxton are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the operation \nof the Niagara County Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of the strip search policy \n14 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 15 of 20(cid:10)\nquestioned  in  this  lawsuit.  As  such,  Beilein,  Muscarella  and  Saxton  are  each  individually \nresponsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members of the Class.  \n67.   Sheriff Beilein, Undersheriff Muscarella and Major Saxton knew or should have \nknown that Niagara County’s strip search policy was illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and \nwith specific intent to deprive Plaintiffs and members of the Class of their Constitutional rights.  \n68.   This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. § \n1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law.  \n69.   As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, the \nRepresentative Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured.  \n \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -- \n70.   Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nthe preceding paragraphs.  \n71.   The policy, custom and practice of the Niagara County Sheriffs Department, the \nCounty of Niagara and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that these \nentities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into \nthe Niagara County Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have \neither contraband or weapons.  \n73.   The Representative Plaintiffs and members of the Class request that this Court \nissue a declaratory judgment and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Niagara \nand the Niagara County Sheriff s Department to be unconstitutional.  \n \n15 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 16 of 20(cid:10)\nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS  \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction – \n \n74.   Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in \nthe preceding paragraphs.  \n75.   The policy, custom and practice of the Niagara County Sheriffs Department, the \nCounty of Niagara and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in that these \nentities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip searches of all individuals placed into \nthe Niagara County Jail without any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question \nhave either contraband or weapons.  \n \n76.   Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Niagara \nCounty Jail, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the harms that \nhave already been inflicted upon the Representative Plaintiffs.  \n77.   The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor crimes \nwill cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, an adequate \nremedy for which does not exist at law.  \n78.   Plaintiffs  demand  that  the  County  of  Niagara,  the  Niagara  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment,  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  and  Niagara  County  Corrections  Officers \nimmediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of the Niagara \nCounty Jail absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either \ncontraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent injunction from this Court \nordering as much.  \n \n16 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 17 of 20(cid:10)\nDEMAND FOR PUNTIVE DAMAGES \n79.   The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in that \nthey continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a fact that \ntheir actions are unconstitutional.  \n80.   It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Niagara and the \nNiagara County Sheriff’s Department have no respect for the civil rights of individual citizens or \nfor the rule of law. Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary to punish the Policy \nMaking Defendants, and to send a message to them that the requirements of the United States \nConstitution also apply to government officials in Niagara County.  \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n81.  The Representative Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 18 of 20(cid:10)\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiffs  Dedrick  Williams,  Camile  Smith  and  Marquessa  Page,  on \nbehalf of themselves and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated, request that this \nHonorable Court grant them the following relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23. \nB.  A  judgment  against  all  Defendants,  jointly  and  severally,  on  Plaintiff’s  First \nCause of Action detailed herein, awarding compensatory damages to each Named Plaintiffs and \neach member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a Jury and/or the Court on \nboth an individual and a class wide basis. \nC.  A  judgment  against  Defendant  Thomas  Beilein  on  Plaintiff’s  First  Cause  of \nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nD.  A judgment against Defendant Samuel Muscarella on Plaintiff’s First Cause of \nAction for $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nE.  A judgment against Defendant John Saxton on Plaintiff’s First Cause of Action \nfor $1,000,000.00 in punitive damages. \nF.  A declaratory judgment against all Defendants declaring the County of Niagara \nand the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department’s policy, practice and custom of strip and visual \ncavity searching all detainees entering the Niagara County Jail, regardless of the crime charged \nor suspicion of contraband, to be unconstitutional and improper. \nG.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from continuing to \nstrip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes absent \nparticularized,  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  arrestee  subjected  to  the  search  is  concealing \nweapons or other contraband. \n18 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS-HBS     Document 23     Filed 04/16/2007     Page 19 of 20(cid:10)\nH.  A monetary award for attorney’s fees and the costs of this action, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. §1988 and Fed.R.Civ.P. 23; \nI.

For at least the past several years, the Niagara \nCounty Sheriff’s Department has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter \nthe Niagara County Jail and are placed in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon \nwhich they are charged.  Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from \nthe written procedures of the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department, and was promulgated \nby  senior  Department  officials;  specifically,  Defendants  Thomas  Beilein,  Samuel \nMuscarella, and John Saxton.   \n  1\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 2 of 23(cid:10)\nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In fact, several judges in this Judicial \nDistrict, as well as the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, have \nrecently held that blanket strip search policies/practices like those in dispute in this case \nare unconstitutional.  In short, the policy of Niagara County and the Niagara County \nSheriff’s  Department  to  forcing  those  charged  with  minor  crimes  to  undergo  the \nindignities of a strip search upon entry into the Niagara County Jail is not only clearly \nillegal, but is degrading, insensitive and unnecessary.  \n  Dedrick Williams brings this action on behalf of himself, and on behalf of a class \nof thousands of others who were strip searched after being charged with petty crimes, to \nvindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of his civil rights and those of the class \nmembers she proposes to represent.  Mr. Williams had his bail revoked on Assault in the \nThird Degree and Endangering the Welfare of a Child charges (both misdemeanors) after \nNiagara City Court Judge Robert Restaino accused Mr. Williams (and several dozen \nothers) of having a cell phone in court and illegally revoked his bail.  The cell phone Mr. \nWilliams (and several dozen others) was alleged to possess was actually a beeping wrist \nwatch, and Mr. Williams was released by the New York Supreme Court several hours \nlater.  In the interim, Mr. Williams was transported to the Niagara County Jail and was \nsubjected to a strip search, in violation of his right against unreasonable searches under \nthe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  He seeks monetary damages \nfor himself and each member of the proposed class, a declaration that the Sheriff’s \nDepartment’s  policies/practices  are  unconstitutional,  and  an  injunction  precluding \n  2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 3 of 23(cid:10)\nNiagara County and the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department from continuing to violate \nthe rights of those placed into their custody.  With this as a background, Plaintiff Dedrick \nWilliams, through counsel, hereby complains as follows: \n \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise \nto  Plaintiff’s  claims  and  those  of  proposed  class  members  occurred  in  this  judicial \ndistrict. \n \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff  Dedrick  Williams  (“Williams”)  resides  in  Niagara  County,  New \nYork.  On March 5, 2005, Williams had his bail illegally revoked by Niagara City Court \nJudge Robert Restaino regarding pending charges for assault in the third degree and \nendangering the welfare of a child, both misdemeanors.   \n4.

In addition, at all relevant times, the County was responsible for \nenforcing the rules of the Niagara County Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriff’s Department \npersonnel employed in the Jail obey the Constitution and laws of the United States and of \nthe State of New York. \n5.  The Niagara County Sheriff’s Department (the “Sheriff’s Department”) is a \nCounty Sheriff’s Department organized and existing under the laws of the State of New \nYork.  Although not a legal entity for the purposes of litigation, the Department is listed \nas a party for the purposes of identification.

Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Niagara County Jail. \n11. The class that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nNiagara  County  Jail  after  being  charged  with  misdemeanors, \nviolations, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil \ncommitments  or  other  minor  crimes  and  were  or  will  be  strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Niagara County Jail pursuant to \nthe policy, custom and practice of the Niagara County Sheriff’s \nDepartment  and  the  County  of  Niagara.    The  class  period \ncommences on May 5, 2003 and extends to the date on which the \nNiagara County Sheriff’s Department and/or the County of Niagara \nare  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise  cease,  enforcing  their \nunconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of  conducting  strip \nsearches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from \nthe class are Defendants and any and all of their respective affiliates, \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.   \n \n12. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n13. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable.  \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Niagara County Jail every month – all \nof whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of the \nproposed class totals at least 4,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil rights \nviolated on multiple occasions. \n  6\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 7 of 23(cid:10)\n14. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the large number of class members and the fact that class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of Niagara County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may \nnot  speak  English,  and  likely  would  have  great  difficulty  in  pursuing  their  rights \nindividually. \n15. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants’ \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Niagara \nCounty Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the clearly established \nlaw in this judicial circuit. \n16. Plaintiff’s  claims  are  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  members  of  the  Class.  \nPlaintiff and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’ \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n17. The representative Plaintiff has the requisite personal interest in the outcome \nof this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  Plaintiff \nhas no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n18. Plaintiff has retained counsel who has substantial experience and success in \nthe prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiff is being \nrepresented by Elmer Robert Keach, III; Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger of Berenbaum \n  7\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 8 of 23(cid:10)\nMenken  &  Ben-Asher,  LLP;  Gary  E.  Mason,  Alexander  E.  Barnett  and  Nicholas \nMigliaccio of The Mason Law Firm, PLLC; David Gerald Jay of Buffalo, New York, and \nJonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP.  Mr. Keach is an \nexperienced civil rights and class action attorney who has litigated a wide variety of civil \nrights actions before federal courts, and has litigated class action lawsuits in state and \nfederal courts in five states.  Mr. Keach has successfully litigated a series of strip search \nclass actions before federal courts, including cases against Rensselaer, Schenectady, and \nMontgomery County, and serves as lead counsel in similar class actions pending against \nClinton, Schoharie and Erie County, New York, Camden, Cumberland and Gloucester, \nNew Jersey, and the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \n19. Bruce Menken and Jason Rozger are both experienced civil rights attorneys \nfrom New York City, having litigated scores of civil rights cases against a number of \nDefendants, including one prison brutality case presently pending in this District.  Mr. \nMenken and Mr. Rozger have successfully represented many victims of illegal strip \nsearches, including several who opted out of the recent class action litigation against the \nCity of New York.  Mr. Menken and Mr. Rozger were also co-counsel in the Rensselaer, \nSchenectady, Montgomery, Schoharie, Clinton and Erie County class actions. \n20. Gary E. Mason is one of this country’s premier class action attorneys, with \noffices in Washington, DC.  Mr. Mason has successfully litigated class actions against \nFortune 500 companies in both state and federal court in over a dozen jurisdictions, \nincluding gaining a settlement for a class of purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of \n$ 950 million dollars.  Mr. Mason has served as lead or co-counsel in numerous high \nprofile class actions, including In Re The Exxon Valdez, In Re Diet Drugs Product \n  8\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 9 of 23(cid:10)\nLiability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation.    Mr. \nMason  and  Mr.  Migliaccio  were  also  co-counsel  in  the  Rensselaer,  Schenectady, \nMontgomery, Clinton and Erie County class actions. \n21. Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of Cuneo Waldman & Gilbert, have \nextensive  experience  in  state  and  federal  trial  and  appellate  courts,  before  law \nenforcement authorities and in proceedings before the United States Congress.  Cuneo \nand LaDuca have successfully prosecuted several complex class actions, including cases \ninvolving securities fraud, antitrust violations, consumer protection and products liability \nin state and federal courts throughout the United States.  Mr. Cuneo and Mr. LaDuca \nwere also co-counsel in the Schenectady, Clinton and Erie County class actions. \n22. David Gerald Jay is Buffalo’s most distinguished civil rights lawyer, having \npracticed with distinction before the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New \nYork for nearly forty years.  Mr. Jay also serves as co-counsel in the Erie County class \naction. \n23. In short, Plaintiff’s counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against Niagara County, the Niagara County Sheriff’s \nDepartment and the Policy Making Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiff knows of no \nconflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class. \n24. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the \nPlaintiff seeks class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Niagara County \nJail.  In short, the County of Niagara, the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department, the \n  9\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 10 of 23(cid:10)\nPolicy Making Defendants and Niagara County Corrections Officers acted on grounds \ngenerally applicable to all class members. \n25. In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, Plaintiff \nseeks certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n26. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of  law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy/practice \nof  strip  searching  all  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  minor  crimes  and \ncommitted  to  the  Niagara  County  Jail  is  a  violation  of  the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de \nfacto policy existed during the class period. \n27. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area.    Furthermore,  the  expense  and  burden  of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n  10\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 11 of 23(cid:10)\n28. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants’ flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for the past several \nyears. \n29. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiff also \nseeks partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n \n  11\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 12 of 23(cid:10)\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n30. The  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers  they  supervise,  from  performing  strip  searches  of  arrestees  who  have  been \ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes unless the officer has reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n31. Upon information and belief, the County of Niagara, the Niagara County \nSheriff’s Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or \nde  facto  policy,  custom  or  practice  of  strip  searching  all  individuals  who  enter  the \ncustody of the Niagara County Jail (by forcing them to remove their clothing for a visual \ninspection of their bodies and/or forcing them to submit to a visual inspection of their \nbody cavities) and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their charged \ncrime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was \nconcealing a weapon or contraband. For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual \ncavity searches are collectively referred to as “strip searches.” \n32. The County of Niagara, the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department, and the \nPolicy  Making  Defendants  know  that  they  may  not  institute,  enforce  or  permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, \nreasonable suspicion.  This judicial circuit has stated repeatedly that state officials may \nnot  strip  search  individuals  charged  with  misdemeanors  or  violations  absent \nparticularized, reasonable suspicion, with this principle being clearly established in 1986 \nby Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986) and recently affirmed by Shain v. Ellison, \n  12\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 13 of 23(cid:10)\n273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2001), cert. denied sub. nom, Nassau Co. v. Shain, 537 U.S. 1083 \n(2002).   \n33. The  Defendants’  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n34. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n35. Upon information and belief, the County of Niagara, the Niagara County \nSheriff’s Department and Policy Making Defendants have promulgated, implemented, \nenforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of \nstrip searching all individuals placed into the custody of the Niagara County Jail and \nplaced into jail clothing without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or indeed \nsuspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre-\ntrial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the \narrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of \nthe policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches.   \n36. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Niagara County Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of reasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable \n  13\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 14 of 23(cid:10)\nsuspicion.    Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n37. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches – \neach member of the class, including the named Plaintiff – has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff  \n38. Dedrick Williams’ experience is representative of the class at large.  On \nMarch 5, 2005, Mr. Williams had his bail revoked on misdemeanor charges of Assault in \nthe Third Degree and Endangering the Welfare of a Child by Niagara City Court Judge \nRobert Restaino.  Mr. Williams was then arrested and placed in the Niagara County Jail \nuntil being ordered released a few hours later.  The circumstances of Mr. Williams’ \ncriminal  charges  are  related  to  a  domestic  dispute,  and  the  circumstances  of  his \nrevocation of bail are that he was one of several individuals ordered illegally jailed by \nJudge Restaino after a wrist watch (believed to be a cell phone) went off in Judge \nRestaino’s courtroom.  In an effort to identify the individual with the cell phone, Judge \nRestaino proceeded to illegally revoke the bail of several individuals present in his \ncourtroom that day.   \n39. At approximately 5:00 PM on or about March 5, 2005, Ms. Williams was \ntransported to the Niagara County Jail.  A short time later, Mr. Williams was moved into \na shower area in the Niagara County Jail and ordered to disrobe.  As a Corrections \nOfficer watched, Mr. Williams removed all of his clothing, including his underpants.   \n  14\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 15 of 23(cid:10)\n40.  A Corrections Officer then instructed Mr. Williams lift his testicles, turn \naround, bend at the waist, spread the lobes of his buttocks and squat while coughing, with \nthe Corrections Officer conducting a visual inspection of Mr. Williams’ genitals and \nrectal cavity.  Williams was then provided with a jail uniform after taking a shower.  \n41. On this particular occasion, there was no reasonable suspicion to believe that \nMr. Williams was concealing a weapon or other contraband.  Indeed, no inquiry was \nmade of Mr. Williams that could have given rise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.   \n42. On several other occasions during the class period, Williams was taken to the \nNiagara County Jail on minor criminal charges (for example, driving without a license) \nand subject to a strip search identical or nearly identical to that detailed above.  \n43. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Mr. Williams \nhas suffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n \n \n  15\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 16 of 23(cid:10)\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under of Color of State Law -- \n \n44. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 43. \n45. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n46. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiff’s rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Niagara \nCounty Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiff and class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the \nPolicy  Making  Defendants  to  order/direct  Niagara  County  Corrections  Officers  to \nconduct such searches.   \n47. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the County of Niagara and the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department.  As such, the \nCounty of Niagara is directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiff and members \nof the Class. \n48. Upon information and belief, Sheriff Beilein, Undersheriff Muscarella and \nMajor Saxton are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in \n  16\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 17 of 23(cid:10)\nthe operation of the Niagara County Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of \nthe strip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Beilein, Muscarella and \nSaxton are each individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiff and \nmembers of the Class.    \n49. Sheriff Beilein, Undersheriff Muscarella and Major Saxton knew that the \nNeck’s strip search policy was illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific \nintent to deprive Plaintiff and members of the Class of their Constitutional rights. \n50. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n51. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiff and members of the proposed class have been irreparably injured. \n \n  17\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 18 of 23(cid:10)\nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment -- \n \n52. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 51. \n53. The policy, custom and practice of the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department, \nthe County of Niagara and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in \nthat  these  entities  and  individuals  are  directing/conducting  the  strip  searches  of  all \nindividuals placed into the Niagara County Jail without any particularized suspicion that \nthe individuals in question have either contraband or weapons. \n54. Plaintiff and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Niagara and the \nNiagara County Sheriff’s Department to be unconstitutional. \n \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n55. Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 54. \n56. The policy, custom and practice of the Niagara County Sheriff’s Department, \nthe County of Niagara and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly unconstitutional, in \nthat  these  entities  and  individuals  are  directing/conducting  the  strip  searches  of  all \nindividuals placed into the Niagara County Jail without any particularized suspicion that \nthe individuals in question have either contraband or weapons. \n  18\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 19 of 23(cid:10)\n57. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Niagara \nCounty Jail, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiff.   \n58. The  continuing  pattern  of  strip  searching  individuals  charged  with  minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n59. Plaintiff demands that the County of Niagara, the Niagara County Sheriff’s \nDepartment, the Policy Making Defendants and Niagara County Corrections Officers \nimmediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of the Niagara \nCounty Jail absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in question have \neither contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent injunction \nfrom this Court ordering as much. \n \n \n \n  19\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 20 of 23(cid:10)\nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n60.  The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, in \nthat they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for a \nfact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n61. It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Niagara and the \nNiagara County Sheriff’s Department have no respect for the civil rights of individual \ncitizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is necessary \nto  punish  the  Policy  Making  Defendants,  and  to  send  a  message  to  them  that  the \nrequirements of the United States Constitution also apply to government officials in \nNiagara County. \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n62. The Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Dedrick Williams, on behalf of himself and on behalf of \na class of others similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant him the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  An order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nB.  A judgment against all Defendants, jointly and severally on Plaintiff’s First \nCause  of  Action  detailed  herein,  awarding  Compensatory  Damages  to  each  named \nPlaintiff and each member of the proposed class in an amount to be determined by a Jury \nand/or the Court on both an individual and a class wide basis.  \n  20\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00291-WMS     Document 1     Filed 05/05/2006     Page 21 of 23(cid:10)\nC.

A  preliminary  and  permanent  injunction  enjoining  Defendants  from \ncontinuing to strip and visual cavity search individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nminor crimes absent particularized, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee subjected to the \nsearch is concealing weapons or other contraband. \nH.
