    "summary": "<p>On December 21, 2004, three indigent criminal defendants with felony cases pending in the Grant County, Washington Superior Court, along with an individual taxpaying resident of Grant County, filed a class action lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the Superior Court of Kittitas County, challenging the constitutionality of the public defense system in Grant County.  Plaintiffs claimed that Grant County: (1) failed to establish a public defense system that provided effective assistance of counsel to all indigent persons charged with felonies, (2) failed to assure that all public defenders met professional qualifications,  (3) failed to monitor or oversee the public defense system, (4) failed to provide adequate funds to pay necessary costs of defense, (5) failed to provide representation at all critical stages of prosecution, and (6) undermined the independence of public defenders.  The plaintiffs asserted violations of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Sections 3, 12, and 22 of Article I of the Washington State Constitution. Plaintiffs were represented by attorneys with the ACLU of Washington, Columbia Legal Services and private firms. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief.  </p><p>On August 26, 2004, the Superior Court of Washington for Kittitas County (Judge Michael Cooper) granted the plaintiffs' motion to certify the case as a class action and certified a class consisting of \"all indigent persons who have or will have criminal felony cases pending in Grant County Superior Court, who are appointed an attorney, and who have not entered into a plea agreement or been convicted.\" In October of 2005, Judge Cooper issued a pre-trial ruling in which he found that the County's public defender system overworked its lawyers, failed to provide effective supervision, and allowed the Prosecutor's Office to interfere with funding for expert witnesses and investigators.  Shortly thereafter, the parties resolved the case by settlement.</p><p>In November of 2005, the parties entered into a six-year court-enforceable Settlement Agreement which called for Grant County to reduce excessive public defender caseloads, guarantee that public defense lawyers were qualified to handle serious felony cases, provide adequate funding for investigators and expert witnesses, and comply with public defender standards endorsed by the Washington State Bar Association and authorized by the Washington Legislature.  The settlement also provided that a court-appointed monitor would oversee and direct compliance with the settlement agreement during the six-year term.  <a href=\"http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PD-WA-0001-0017.pdf\">Settlement Agreement</a>.</p><p>Over the six-year term of the settlement agreement, the monitor provided quarterly reports on the state's compliance.  The monitor found that the state on occasion violated the settlement agreement, but noted that most violations were resolved through mediation with the monitor.  In March 2009, the ACLU filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement over the county's decision to shift from using contract attorneys to a partly in-house defense system without first obtaining the monitor's approval as required by the settlement agreement.  In response, the county agreed to pay $10,000 associated with enforcing the agreement.</p><p>The docket indicates the parties agreed to dismiss the action with prejudice in April 2013.  On April 26, 2013, the court approved this dismissal and closed the case.</p>",

      "title": "Monitor's Report, Third Quarter 2009",
      "text": "Best, et al. v. Grant County \n \nMonitor’s Report \n \nThird Quarter, 2009 \n \nOctober 23, 2009 \n \nSubmitted by Francisco Rodriguez, Settlement Monitor \n \n \nMonitor’s Activities \n \nDuring the second quarter, I travelled to Grant County on three separate occasions:   \n \n  July 13, 2009 \n  August 17-18 , 2009 \n  September 14-15, 2009 \n \nWhile in Ephrata, I observed court proceedings, reviewed court files, and met with public \ndefenders.  Between site visits, I maintain regular contact with the Supervising Attorney \nand have periodic contact with individual defenders, investigators, and counsel for both \nparties.  \n \nIn addition to my usual activities, I also met with two investigator candidates during the \nthird quarter, one in Seattle and one in Ephrata. \n \n \nAccess to Information \n \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Monitor is entitled to broad access to \ninformation concerning the Grant County public defense system.  I did not encounter any \ndifficulty in obtaining information from Grant County during the third quarter.  Gail \nSundean, Office Manager for the Grant County Department of Public Defense, is my \nmain point of contact when requesting data and documents relating to the public defense \nprogram, and she continues to be very cooperative and helpful. \n \n \nCompliance Issues \n \nWhile the parties continue to discuss case credits, case counts, and a few other issues, no \nformal disputes arose during the third quarter.  Based upon preliminary discussions, it \nappears that the parties will be able to resolve the current issues informally. \n \n \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 1 of 21 \n\nAttorney Staffing \n \nGrant County added two new defenders during the third quarter.  Robert Kentner began \nwork as a contract defender on July 7, taking over Karen Lindholdt’s remaining cases.  \nMr. Kentner is an experienced criminal defense attorney from Indiana where he was \nChief Deputy Public Defender for Tippecanoe County from 2006-2008.  In addition to \nadding Mr. Kentner as a contract defender, Grant County hired Susan Oglebay to fill the \nin-house position left vacant with the departure of Frank Grigaliunas in mid-June.  Ms. \nOglebay is also an experienced criminal attorney, having maintained a private criminal \npractice for many years in Virginia where she also worked as a part-time prosecutor early \nin her career.  She started work on September 14.  Because there was a three month gap \nbetween Mr. Grigaliunas’ departure and Ms. Oglebay’s start date, she did not inherit his \ncaseload.  Both Mr. Kentner and Ms. Oglebay promise to bring much needed experience \nto the Grant County public defense system, though they will undoubtedly face some \nperiod of adjustment as they familiarize themselves with Washington’s laws and \nprocedures. \n \nThese two new hires allow Grant County to approach full staffing.  The one remaining \ngap is John Doherty’s limited availability due to the wind-down of his private practice.  \nMr. Doherty was hired for an in-house position in May.  Although hired as a full-time \ndefender, Mr. Doherty was not immediately available on a full-time basis because he had \nan active private practice in Pierce County.   At Grant County’s request, I approved a \ntransition plan under which Mr. Doherty would have a limited caseload, essentially \nworking as a part-time attorney, until he could extract himself from his private cases.  \nGrant County initially anticipated the wind down would take two months.  Unfortunately, \nthe process has taken longer than expected, and the earliest Mr. Doherty will be available \nfull-time is November 1. \n \nGrant County recently made offers to its defenders for 2010.1  With felony filings \nsubstantially lower in 2009 than in prior years, Grant County plans to reduce staffing.  I \nunderstand that Grant County will seek to retain Brett Billingsley, Julie St. Marie, and \nRobert Kentner as contract defenders next year but does not intend to offer Janelle \nPeterson a contract for 2010.  Ms. Peterson is the longest tenured defender in Grant \nCounty and has been a valuable contributor to the program.  Grant County’s decision not \nto renew her contract is not surprising in light of a confrontation in June involving Ms. \nPeterson and a Grant County prosecutor that caused Ms. Peterson to retain counsel and \nseek early release from her contract.  I had anticipated that Grant County would terminate \nher contract early after her attorney advised that she was no longer able to zealously \nrepresent her clients, but Grant County instead chose to simply let the current contract \nexpire at year’s end.  I am concerned about the impact of this decision on Ms. Peterson’s \nclients but have not observed any lack of zealousness in her representation.   \n \nWith Ms. Peterson leaving Grant County at the end of the year, Supervising Attorney Ray \nGonzales should establish a transition plan well in advance of her departure.  If possible, \n                                                 \n1 While Grant County sent out offer letters on October 16, formal contract proposals have not yet been \ndistributed. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 2 of 21 \n\nMr. Gonzales should avoid assigning her new cases for the remainder of the year unless \nhe expects those cases can be resolved quickly.  To avoid losing Ms. Peterson’s caseload \ncapacity, Mr. Gonzales should consider assigning Ms. Peterson to cover the probation \nviolation calendar as those cases are often resolved at the initial hearing.  For cases that \nwill need to be transferred, Mr. Gonzales should assign new counsel prior to Ms. \nPeterson’s departure so that the new attorneys will have an opportunity to consult with \nher about the cases.  Mr. Gonzales should also make clear his expectations about \ntransferred cases in terms of transfer memos and case preparations prior to transfer (e.g.,  \ninvestigation, briefing, etc.).  \n \nStaff turnover continues to be worrisome in Grant County.  With the impending departure \nof Ms. Peterson, Julie St. Marie is the only defender that has been with Grant County for \nas long as two years.  Five of the eight remaining defenders expected back in 2010 joined \nGrant County after March 1st of this year.  While these new defenders may prove to be \nquite capable, the constant churning of attorneys in and out of the system is extremely \ndisruptive.  To be successful in the long run, Grant County must find a way to retain \nquality defenders.  Perhaps the creation of an in-house defender office will prove helpful \nin this regard.   For the contract defenders, however, Grant County must demonstrate its \ncommitment to these individuals if it expects a commitment in return.  Grant County’s \nfailure to offer new contracts until so late in the year is disappointing.  This practice \nleaves the contract defenders with no sense of job security, and more than one has talked \nof exploring other employment options.  In future years, I hope that Grant County will \nrecognize the importance of initiating contract negotiations earlier in the year to avoid the \nrisk of unexpected departures and to foster a more positive working environment for its \ncontract defenders.    \n \n \nCaseloads \n \nThe Settlement Agreement caps annual caseloads at 150 case equivalents for each \nattorney.   With three quarters of the year complete, none of the Grant County defenders \nappears at risk of exceeding the annual caseload limit.  Indeed, most defenders have \nreceived less than half of their yearly caseloads at this point.  Julie St. Marie had the \nhighest caseload at the end of the third quarter with approximately 77 case equivalents.   \n \nFor 2009, new felony filings continue to be lower than in prior years.  Probation \nassignments and awards of extraordinary credit have been lower as well resulting in a \nsubstantial surplus in capacity.    A year to year comparison through September is \nincluded in the table below: \n \n  Felonies  Probation  Extraordinary  Total Credits2 \n2008  616  299  53  916 \n2009  478  172  3  740 \n \n                                                 \n2 The total includes credits for contempt cases and others not listed in this table. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 3 of 21 \n\nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales estimates that Grant County currently has a surplus \ncapacity of 142 cases for the year.  While I estimate that the actual surplus is substantially \nlower, I agree that Grant County appears to have adequate caseload capacity for the \nremainder of 2009. \n \nThe figures provided by Grant County underestimate total case credits in two ways.  \nFirst, some extraordinary credits earned during the last several months have not yet been \ncounted.  I understand that these were omitted because Grant County has not received a \nreport of the hours worked on those cases from the assigned attorney, Brett Billingsley.3   \nSecond, a significant number of probation violation cases have not been counted.  I have \nbeen discussing this issue with Mr. Gonzales since April as there seems to be uncertainty \nabout when a credit should be awarded for probation cases.  He has agreed to provide a \nclear standard for how to count these cases but has not yet done so.  The parties discussed \nprobation case counts at a recent meeting, and I hope this issue will be resolved during \nthe fourth quarter.  In the meantime, Grant County should take care in assigning cases to \nDean Terrillion who has been handling the majority of the probation violation cases.  \nShould case counts be revised upward, Mr. Terrillion may actually be much closer to his \nannual caseload limit than current figures suggest. \n \nIn addition to annual caseload limits, Grant County has also adopted monthly and \nquarterly limits to ensure that case assignments are spread relatively evenly throughout \nthe year.  During the third quarter, all defenders remained below both the monthly and \nquarterly limits.  This was a marked improvement over last quarter when a flood of case \nreassignments causes caseload problems in June.  With far fewer case reassignments this \nquarter, most defenders received less than ten case equivalents per month.  Cases were \nalso distributed fairly evenly among the defenders.   \n \nWhile the overall case assignment totals are reassuring, I remain concerned about the \ndistribution of class A felonies among the public defenders.   The addition of Robert \nKentner provided some relief this quarter, but the class A assignments continue to be \nunbalanced, with John Perry in particular receiving a disproportionate share: \n \nAttorney  2Q  3Q  Total  6mo %  \nPerry  10  6  16  40% \nBillingsley  6  3  9  22.5% \nKentner  N/A  6  6  15% \nSt. Marie  5  0  5  12.5% \nTerrillion  0  2  2  5% \nPeterson  1  0  1  2.5% \nDoherty  0  1  1  2.5% \n                                                 \n3 Delayed reporting of credits earned has been a chronic problem for Grant County.  These credits are \nsupposed to be reported by the 5th of the following month.  Yet Grant County is still awaiting information \nregarding credits earned in May.  Such delays cause caseloads to appear lower than they actually are and \nput Grant County at risk of unwittingly exceeding annual caseload limits.  Although this risk is minimal for \n2009 as Mr. Billingsley is well below his pro-rated annual caseload, Grant County should nonetheless make \nclear that it is serious about prompt reporting of extraordinary case credits. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 4 of 21 \n\n \nDuring the third quarter, Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales did assign a few class A \ncases to Dean Terrillion and John Doherty, but Mr. Perry continued to lead the way with \n6 new assignments in addition to the 10 he had received the previous quarter.  For the last \nsix months, he has personally received 40% of the class A case assignments.  This \nassignment pattern is not sustainable.  In the future, Mr. Gonzales must work toward a \nmore equitable distribution of class A case assignments. \n \n \nTraining \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires Grant County to ensure its defenders receive \nadequate training.  For the first time this year, Grant County organized a local training for \nits defenders in September.  Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales worked with the \nWashington State Office of Public Defense to organize a full-day free CLE in Moses \nLake on September 18.  The CLE included speakers from Seattle and Spokane, and topics \nincluded ethics, making a record for appeal, search and seizure issues, and motions \npractice.  All of the in-house defenders attended the training, but unfortunately, none of \nthe contract defenders participated.  Nonetheless, the availability of such training is \ncertainly a welcome development. \n \nWhile half-day and full-day CLEs are an important component of public defender \ntraining, they take such time and effort to organize that they tend to occur infrequently.  \nFor that reason, public defender offices often rely on shorter but more regular training \nsessions that occur over lunch, in the morning before court, or in the late afternoon after \ncourt.  Grant County should not wait another year to organize a day-long CLE.  Grant \nCounty should strive to provide its defenders with training opportunities each quarter.  \nThe County need not recruit speakers from outside the area but could instead evaluate \nlocal resources to identify potential candidates including those within its own program.  \nIndeed, Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales was one of the speakers at the recent CLE in \nMoses Lake.  It is unclear to me why he could not have given the same presentation over \nlunch with the Grant County defenders months ago.   \n \n \nFirst Appearances \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that Grant County provide representation at initial \nappearances for all indigent defendants.  Grant County assigns first appearance duty to its \ndefenders on a rotating weekly basis.  Defenders, however, frequently trade weeks or \nindividual days to better suit their personal schedules.  In practice, attorneys rarely cover \nfive consecutive days of first appearances.  During the last week of July, for example, a \ndifferent attorney handled first appearances each day. \n \nBased upon my review of court files and intake sheets, Grant County appears to be \nproviding representation to all defendants at first appearance.  Although Grant County no \nlonger requires its public defenders to visit defendants in jail prior to their first \n2009 Quarterly Report - 5 of 21 \n\nappearance, they continue to do on a fairly consistent basis.  I found records of 184 such \nvisits during the third quarter: \n \nAttorney  # Visits  Days \nTerrillion  49  17 \nKentner  46  7 \nPeterson  25  6 \nPerry  24  7 \nBillingsley  15  3 \nMaggard  12  N/A4 \nDoherty  10  5 \nSt. Marie  3  1 \nTotal  184   \n \n \nMr. Terrillion and Mr. Kentner were particularly diligent in visiting first appearance \nclients.  They routinely visited all clients scheduled for first appearance on the days to \nwhich they were assigned coverage, even when the first appearance dockets were quite \nheavy.  On August 31, for example, Mr. Kentner visited 15 defendants scheduled for first \nappearance that day.  Similarly, on both July 10 and July 13, Mr. Terrillion visited 9 \ndefendants set for first appearance.  Other public defenders also managed busy first \nappearance days well with Ms. Peterson visiting all 12 defendants on September 8, and \nMr. Billingsley making 9 visits on August 10. \n \nWhile the general practice of Grant County’s defenders is clearly to visit these clients in \njail prior to first appearance, I did find 7 days on which first appearances were scheduled \nbut no visits occurred, including 1 day on which at least 11 first appearances were \nscheduled.  On each of these days except one, my review of the client intake sheets \nsuggests that though there was no jail visit, the assigned defender did meet with the \ndefendants in advance of the hearing.   \n \n \nJail Visits  \n \nGrant County public defenders are required to contact all new clients prior to \narraignment.  If contact prior to arraignment is not “practicable” for some reason, \ndefenders must nonetheless contact the client within seven days from the date of \nassignment.  For in-custody clients, an in person jail visit is required.   \n \nTo assess the timeliness of jail visits during the third quarter, I reviewed 85 in-custody \nfelony cases assigned during the quarter, cross-referencing the case assignments with jail \nvisitation logs and inmate lists from the Grant County Jail.  Overall, I found that the \nGrant County defenders visited their clients on or before the day of arraignment \n                                                 \n4 Kacie Maggard covers first appearances for contempt cases, but she is not assigned to general coverage \nduties. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 6 of 21 \n\napproximately 58% of the time and within seven days approximately 81% of the time.  \nThese figures are down only slightly from last quarter.

Setting aside the \nperformance of those three attorneys, the remaining defenders visited 94% of their in \ncustody clients within 7 days. \n \nMr. Billingsley’s jail visits were of particular concern.  Four of his in-custody clients did \nnot receive a visit at all.  As of October 10, he had clients who had been in jail for 85 \ndays, 52 days, and 43 days without receiving a visit.  Two of those clients are being held \non class A felonies.  In addition to the four who received no visit at all, two other in-\ncustody clients waited more than a month before receiving a visit from Mr. Billingsley, \nwith one waiting 70 days (class A) and the other 56 days.  Two more clients had to wait \nmore than two weeks.  This is not a new problem for Mr. Billingsley as both former \n                                                 \n5 Mike Felice was assigned two conflict cases. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 7 of 21 \n\nSupervising Attorney Alan White and current Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales have \nmet with Mr. Billingsley to counsel him about the importance of timely jail visits.   \n \nWhile most defenders did visit clients within seven days of assignment, they were not as \ndiligent about visiting clients prior to arraignment.   The individual rates varied widely, \nbut only newly hired Susan Oglebay managed to visit all of her jailed clients prior to \narraignment: \n \nVISITS  TOTAL  % B4 \nATTORNEY  B4 ARR  VISITS  ARR \nOglebay  3  3  100% \nKentner  11  13  85% \nTerrillion  11  15  73% \nPerry  12  17  71% \nPeterson  5  9  56% \nSt. Marie  3  9  33% \nBillingsley  1  10  10% \nDoherty  0  2  0% \nFelice  0  2  0% \nTotal  46  80  58% \n \n \nEven subtracting the four defenders with the lowest percentage of visits before \narraignment only improves the overall rate to 74%.   \n \nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales has set a higher standard for in-house defenders, \nrequiring them to visit in-custody clients within three days of assignment.  I continue to \nsupport his efforts to expedite client contact, though I question differentiating between in-\nhouse defenders and contract defenders.  During the third quarter, the in-house defenders \nmet the three day standard 67% of the time, an improvement over last quarter’s 52%.  \nWhile both these figures are less than ideal, setting the bar higher appears to have had a \npositive impact as the rate of visits within three days by contract defenders, who are not \nsubject to the higher standard, was only 24%, more than 40% lower than the in-house \ndefenders. \n \nDespite the requirement that jail visits take place prior to arraignment if at all possible, \nmany of Grant County’s defenders seem to pay more attention to the outside limit of \nseven days.  A jail visit prior to arraignment is viewed more as an aspirational standard \nthan a requirement.  Yet arraignment may be the client’s last, best opportunity to secure \nrelease pending trial.  In some cases, the defendant may choose to plead guilty at \narraignment.   Meaningful consultation with the client is essential if the attorney is to be \nprepared to address either of these issues.  Given the importance of meeting with clients \nprior to arraignment and the propensity of current defenders to default to the seven day \n2009 Quarterly Report - 8 of 21 \n\ndeadline, Grant County should consider revising its client contact policy to simply \nrequire contact prior to arraignment.6   \n \nOverall, Grant County public defenders have been better about making timely jail visits \nduring the first three quarters of 2009 than they were during the same period last year.  \nThe creation of an in-house defender has likely helped in this regard as a majority of the \ndefenders are now in Ephrata at least 5 days a week, making jail visits more convenient.  \nPersonnel changes have probably also played a significant role.  Going forward, Grant \nCounty should continue to emphasize the importance of timely jail visits.  In addition to \nrevising its client contact policy, Grant County should consider weekly monitoring of \nvisits for in-custody clients.  At a minimum, defenders who have a history of problems in \nthis area should be subject to closer scrutiny by Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales.   It \nshould go without saying that all jailed clients deserve at least one visit from the attorney \nassigned to represent them.  While the lawyer may feel he or she is able to get by without \none, the case is about the client not the lawyer.   \n \n \nClient Complaints \n \nThe Grant County Department of Public Defense maintains a dedicated phone line for \ncomplaints.  The line is toll-free, and instructions regarding how to make a complaint are \nposted in several locations at the jail in both English and Spanish.   For out-of-custody \ndefendants, the assigned public defender is expected to provide each client with a flyer at \narraignment that directs him or her to contact the Supervising Attorney with complaints.  \nIn practice, this does not always occur as attorneys frequently forget to set the forms out \nat the start of the morning’s calendar.   \n \nComplaint calls appear to be lower overall in 2009.  Calls regarding attorney-client \ncommunication issues are noticeably down.  There seem to be slightly more substantive \ncomplaints regarding the quality of representation, but I attribute that to more accurate \nand complete record-keeping by the new office rather than any real increase in client \ndissatisfaction with the defenders.  In terms of content, the complaints are fairly typical of \npublic defense clients.  The challenge for Mr. Gonzales is to discern whether callers are \nmerely blaming their public defenders for the situation in which they find themselves or \nif instead, there is merit to their concerns.  I was very pleased to see that on several \noccasions during the third quarter Mr. Gonzales visited clients in the jail to follow-up on \ncomplaints.   \n \nIn reviewing the calls from this quarter, I noticed two recurring themes.  First, Julie St. \nMarie’s clients have difficulty reaching her by phone.  Interestingly, despite these issues, \nwhen asked if they’d like to make a complaint, every single client declined to do so.  \nSecond, several of John Perry’s clients are frustrated because he has apparently promised \nto visit, file a motion, or provide an update but has not yet done so because he says he’s \nbeen too busy.  Mr. Gonzales correctly observes that Mr. Perry has a bad habit of making \n                                                 \n6 If arraignment has already occurred prior to assignment, the policy should specify a time period for \ncontact. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 9 of 21 \n\nwell-intentioned promises that later come back to haunt him, and the two are working on \nthat issue.  I am also concerned that the high concentration of serious cases may be taking \na toll on Mr. Perry but have not discussed that possibility with him. \n \n \nInvestigator Staffing \n \nGrant County currently has five approved public defense investigators:  Ellyn Berg, Marv \nScott, Jim Patterson, Mario Torres, and Karl Calhoun.  Unfortunately, Kathleen Kennedy \nresigned in mid-September for personal reasons.  She had consistently received very \npositive reviews from the Grant County public defenders, and her departure is a \nsignificant loss.  Due to her resignation, approximately ten cases had to be reassigned to \nnew investigators.   \n \nKarl Calhoun was approved during the third quarter and began receiving cases October 1.  \nHe is an experienced investigator with 20+ years in law enforcement followed by several \nyears of defense investigation in Pierce County.  Grant County had requested approval of \na second new investigator, but after some concerns arose during the approval process, \nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales asked me to put the request on hold. \n \nI continue to receive troublesome reports regarding the work of Mario Torres.  While \nsome defenders felt he was more responsive during the third quarter, others reported a \nlack of follow-through, failure to follow directions, and lack of thoroughness.  Both of \nGrant County’s juvenile court defenders now refuse to work with Mr. Torres.  Also of \nconcern is Mr. Torres’ billing.  He is now almost 5 months behind in billing Grant \nCounty for his services, and the bills he has submitted are problematic.  Examples of \nbilling entries include: \n \nDESCRIPTION  TIME \nExamp le #1  Case review, 3 background checks, msg to \nattorney \n9.7 hours \nExample #2  2 additional background checks on both victims, \nnew information on person possible involved, \nattempted to contact co-defendant, msg to \nattorney \n6.0 hours \n \nWhile it is important that investigator billing be redacted to protect client confidentiality, \nthe bills must nevertheless contain sufficient detail to justify the amount billed.  \nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales should insist that bills be submitted in a timely \nfashion and that those bills contain adequate documentation of the work performed.  I \nunderstand that Grant County has already paid the invoices submitted to date but that \nGail Sundean recently asked that future bills from Mr. Torres contain more detail to \nallow for verification of the work performed. \n \nWith the departure of Ms. Kennedy and the juvenile attorneys no longer willing to work \nwith Mr. Torres, Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales increased assignments of adult \n2009 Quarterly Report - 10 of 21 \n\nfelony cases to Jim Patterson and, to a lesser extent, Mario Torres.7  Mr. Patterson’s \nworkload is worrisome as his assignments more than doubled during the third quarter.  \nHe was assigned 1 case in the first quarter, 12 cases in the second quarter, and 31 cases in \nthe third quarter.  The continued use of Mario Torres on adult felony cases is also \ntroubling.  While the loss of Ms. Kennedy may have necessitated the continued use of \nMr. Torres during the third quarter, I do not understand the decision to use him on adult \nfelony cases rather than juvenile matters.  In any event, Grant County should continue to \nexplore its options for expanding its pool of investigators.   \n \n \nInvestigation Rates \n \nThe overall rate of investigation for the second quarter was 31%, up slightly from the past \nquarters.  The investigation rate has been fairly consistent in 2009 ranging from \napproximately 28% to 31%.  Investigation rates have been higher in prior years at 36% in \n2008 and 35% in 2007.  The rates for individual attorneys during the third quarter ranged \nfrom 4% to 55%: \n3Q \nINVESTIGATION  \nATTORNEY  RATE \nKentner  55% \nSt. Marie  53% \nPerry  45% \nPeterson  43% \nOglebay  17% \nDoherty  16% \nTerrillion  14% \nBillingsley  4% \n  \nWhile many defenders appear to be making appropriate use of investigators, others are \nnot.   \n \nMr. Billingsley’s rate of investigation is strikingly low.  Over the last two quarters, he has \nreceived 46 felony case assignments, including 9 class A felonies, and requested \ninvestigation in only 3 cases.  His failure to use the investigation resources available to \nhim is simply unacceptable.  Mr. Doherty and Mr. Terrillion also had surprisingly low \nrates of investigation this quarter.  Over the last two quarters, Mr. Doherty has received \n32 felony case assignments and requested investigation in only 4 cases.  Mr. Terrillion’s \ninvestigation rate was somewhat higher last quarter, but I had expected it to go up rather \nthan down this quarter.  Both he and Mr. Doherty need to improve in this area. \n \nDefenders Kenter, St. Marie, Peterson and Perry all appear to be making good use of \ninvestigation on their cases.  Ms. Overbay did not start until September 14, so although \n                                                 \n7 Mr. Gonzales could not compensate by increasing assignments to Ms. Berg as she works exclusively with \nthe in-house defenders.  Mr. Scott accepts a limited number of cases and was assigned only three cases \nduring the third quarter, two of which were juvenile matters. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 11 of 21 \n\nher investigation rate appears low, the fact that she has already requested investigation on \none of her six felony cases is a good sign.   \n \nDuring the fourth quarter, Grant County should take steps to ensure that all of its \nattorneys are utilizing investigators when appropriate.  Supervising Attorney Ray \nGonzales should meet individually with the defenders with low rates of investigation to \ndiscuss the importance of investigation in case preparation, emphasizing the value of \ninvestigation not just for trial but for plea negotiations as well.  Mr. Gonzales should also \nconsider setting up a training session on this topic. \n \n \nExperts \n \nThe Settlement Agreement anticipates that the use of experts will be essential to effective \nrepresentation in some cases and requires that expert requests be made ex parte and \nsealed in the court file.   \n \nFor the third quarter, I found six cases in which Grant County public defenders requested \nexperts.  Robert Kentner, John Perry, and Janelle Peterson each made two requests for \nexperts.  All of the requests appear to have been made ex parte.  Both of Ms. Peterson’s \nrequests were sealed, while Mr. Kentner and Mr. Perry each had one of their two requests \nsealed.  Procedural issues continue to be an obstacle to proper sealing and thus protection \nof client confidences.  In one case, a motion to seal was filed, but the documents were not \nsealed, and there was no record of a ruling on the motion to seal.  In another case, the \nexpert motion and declaration were sealed, but the motion to seal itself contained \nconfidential information regarding the expert, and that motion was not sealed.  \n \nProcedures relating to sealing have been a persistent problem in Grant County.  In past \nreports, I have urged the Supervising Attorney (past and present) to address this issue \nwith little success.  I hope that during the fourth quarter, Mr. Gonzales will devote some \ntime and attention to this issue.   \n \n \nMotions Practice \n \nEach quarter, I evaluate motions practice by identifying cases in which motions have \nbeen filed and reviewing the relevant court files.  I also inquire of the defenders whether \nthey are aware of any additional motions I may have missed.   \n \nDuring the third quarter, I found 13 cases in which Grant County defenders had filed \nsubstantive legal motions.8  Dean Terrillion filed motions in 5 of his cases this quarter, \nwhile John Perry filed motions in 4 cases.  Robert Kentner (2), Janelle Peterson (1), and \nKacie Maggard (1) also filed substantive motions this quarter.   \n                                                 \n8 For purposes of this analysis, I define substantive motions as any written motion to suppress pursuant to \nCrR 3.5 or CrR 3.6, any written Knapstad motion, and any written brief that contained substantive legal \nanalysis tailored to a particular case.   \n2009 Quarterly Report - 12 of 21 \n\n \nAt least two defenders achieved favorable results for their clients during the third quarter \nas a result of their motions practice.  Mr. Terrillion won the exclusion of evidence in one \ncase and suppression of his client’s statements in another.  Also in the third quarter, \nthough it is quite rare for written motions to be filed in contempt cases, I learned that Ms. \nMaggard had not only filed a substantive brief in a contempt matter but won dismissal of \nthe action.  Her briefing was extensive and well-reasoned on what appears to have been a \ncomplex issue relating to whether the petitioner could pursue Social Security death \nbenefits through a contempt action in the absence of an existing child support obligation . \n \nThree defenders did not file any substantive motions during the third quarter:  John \nDoherty, Brett Billingsley, and Julie St. Marie.  I have no concerns about Ms. St. Marie’s \nmotions practice as she routinely files suppression briefs and other motions.  Mr. \nBillingsley, however, has filed substantive briefs in only two cases this year and did not \nfile any substantive motions at all in 2008.  While natural variation in case assignments \nmay result in Mr. Billingsley being assigned fewer cases with good legal issues than his \ncolleagues, it is very unlikely for this pattern to persist over such a long period of time.  \nAs described in my last report, Mr. Billingsley is quite capable of briefing and litigating \nlegal issues, but for some reason, he does so only rarely.  Mr. Billingsley should be \nencouraged to brief legal issues more frequently in the future.  Finally, Mr. Doherty has \nnot yet filed any motions since joining Grant County’s Department of Public Defense in \nMay.  He has been on a reduced caseload, however, and did not inherit an existing \ncaseload when he arrived.  As his caseload builds over time, I would expect to see him \nfiling more motions. \n \nIn addition to the more substantive legal motions discussed above, I found that Grant \nCounty defenders had filed discovery motions and supplemental discovery requests in 31 \ncases during the third quarter.  Mr. Kentner and Ms. Peterson were responsible for the \nalmost all of this discovery litigation with Mr. Kentner filing motions for supplemental \ndiscovery in 22 cases and Ms. Peterson filing supplemental discovery requests in 8 \ncases.9   These defenders should be commended for carefully reviewing discovery early \nin their cases and promptly notifying the State that addition discovery is needed.   This \npractice facilitates investigation, plea negotiations, and trial preparation, and as a result, \nexpedites case resolutions.  Prompt requests for missing or additional discovery should be \na matter of routine.  All of Grant County’s defenders should follow the lead of Mr. \nKentner and Ms. Peterson in this regard.  Moreover, if necessary, the defenders should \nnote a motion to compel rather than wait until the omnibus hearing to address outstanding \ndiscovery issues.  Given the recent emphasis on expeditious case processing in Grant \nCounty, defenders who do not actively pursue needed discovery in a timely fashion risk \nbeing forced to go forward without it. \n \n \n                                                 \n9 Mr. Perry also filed a motion for additional discovery in one of his cases. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 13 of 21 \n\nTrials \n \nJulie St. Marie continued to dominate the trial calendar during the third quarter, taking \nthree different cases to verdict.  She tried a controlled substances homicide case, a child \nrape/communication with a minor for immoral purposes (CMIP) case, and a \nrobbery/witness tampering case this quarter.  She won a complete acquittal in the \nrobbery/witness tampering case as well as a not guilty verdict on the CMIP charge.  Ms. \nSt. Marie has already tried 8 cases this year.  She has personally tried more cases in 2009 \nthan all of Grant County’s defenders combined in 2007 and has more than double the \nnumber of jury trials for the year of any Grant County defender in many years.  I continue \nto be very impressed with her trial work. \n \nBrett Billingsley also had multiple jury trials during the third quarter.  He tried two cases, \na perjury case and a high-profile Assault 1 case in with the alleged victim was a police \nofficer.  The assault trial lasted two weeks and ended with a guilty verdict on the lesser \ncharge of Assault 2.  Trial is certainly one of Mr. Billingsley’s strengths.  He has already \ntried four cases this year, and until very recently was the only remaining defender other \nthan Ms. St. Marie who had had a jury trial in 2009.   \n \nThe trial work of both Ms. St. Marie and Mr. Billingsley this year has been refreshing.  \nMoreover, I understand that several other defenders have tried cases in October.  While \nclients, prosecutors, and the court often have more control over whether cases proceed to \ntrial than public defenders, a robust trial practice is nonetheless usually a good indicator \nof a strong public defense program.   \n \n \nOverall Quality of Representation \n   \nThe turnover rate in Grant County makes it very difficult to evaluate the overall quality \nof representation as it takes time to develop a fair picture of the work being done by \nindividual defenders.  Grant County has lost a number of strong defenders over the last \nyear, but in time, their replacements may prove to be as capable or better.   \n \nIn reporting on the quality of representation, I frequently refer to objective criteria such \nas timely jail visits, investigation rates, and motions filed.  Some defenders have \nexpressed frustration with this approach, suggesting that it does not offer a complete \npicture of the representation they provide.  While I recognize that a defender might, in \nsome cases, be able provide a good defense without ever visiting his or client in jail, \ninvestigating the case, or filing a written motion, these are all basic aspects of criminal \ndefense practice that should be part of the minimum standards required by any public \ndefense program.  At the same time, I understand that lawyers have different styles and \nphilosophies and may achieve success in different ways.  Aside from jail visits, which \nshould happen in every case, there is a wide range of acceptable practice.  For that \nreason, I generally try to give Grant County’s defenders the benefit of the doubt unless \nthey fall below basic standards of practice.   \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 14 of 21 \n\nIn general, I am guardedly optimistic about the quality of public defense in Grant County.  \nAside from caseload limits, the key to good public defense is hiring and retaining the \nright personnel.  The public defenders with the longest tenures in Grant County, Ms. \nPeterson and Ms. St. Marie have certainly proven to be assets to the program, though \nunfortunately, Ms. Peterson will be leaving in a few months.  While more time is needed \nto observe and evaluate some of Grant County’s newer hires, my preliminary impressions \nhave been, for the most part, positive.  The challenge for Grant County going forward \nwill be to evaluate its current public defenders to ensure that they are willing and able to \nmeet Grant County’s standards for quality representation.  Assuming Grant County is \npleased with the results of this process, Grant County must then take care to ensure it \nretains those defenders for the long term. \n \n \nInterpreters \n \nGrant County’s public defenders have a large number of Spanish-speaking clients and \nthus frequently rely on Spanish interpreters.  The defenders have consistently praised \ninterpreters Saul Castillo and Jeremy Chambers not just for the quality of their work but \nalso for their professionalism and availability. For their part, the interpreters report that \nmany of Grant County’s defenders make regular use of interpreters outside of court.  In \nparticular, they identified Janelle Peterson, Robert Kentner, Dean Terrillion, and John \nPerry as regularly scheduling interpreter sessions with their clients.   \n \nOn my most recent visit to Grant County, both the defenders and interpreters expressed \nconcern regarding a change in the system for scheduling Spanish interpreters for client \nvisits, witness interviews, and the like.  Apparently, there is a plan under consideration \nthat would require the defenders to schedule interpreter visits through the court rather \nthan by contacting the interpreters directly.   \n \nDefenders have concerns as to how this new system will impact interpreter availability \nfor short notice meetings before or after normal business hours and on weekends.  \nFrequently, the attorneys do not know whether an inmate or witness needs an interpreter \nuntil the last minute.  Similarly, the attorneys sometimes may not be aware of the need \nfor a meeting until receiving an urgent call from a client, client family member, \ninvestigator, or even a prosecutor with a last minute plea offer.  These situations have not \nbeen a significant problem in prior years because Grant County’s Spanish interpreters \nhave been very accommodating in making themselves available for such emergency \nmeetings.   \n \nFor their part, the Spanish interpreters expressed concern not just about these last minute \nmeetings but also the financial viability of continuing to provide interpreter services for \nGrant County at all, particularly in light of prior cuts to interpreter services this year.  \nEarlier this year, Grant County cut its Spanish interpreter time significantly.  Prior \npractice had been for Grant County to have two Spanish interpreters available for both \nthe Monday and Tuesday docket days.  Both interpreters were based in the courtroom and \navailable to translate documents, assist attorneys in conferring with clients, and provide \n2009 Quarterly Report - 15 of 21 \n\nin-court interpretation if the court’s interpreter was unavailable.  One interpreter \nremained in the courtroom at all times, but the other was available to the defenders to go \nto the jail or the work release facility for client meetings or to provide other assistance to \ndefenders outside the courtroom.  For 2009, however, Grant County cut the scheduled \ninterpreter time on docket days in half.  Currently, only one Spanish interpreter is \navailable in court on those days.  As a result, attorneys no longer have the option of \nvisiting clients or otherwise utilizing an interpreter outside of court during that time \nunless specific arrangements have been made in advance.  Attorneys also previously had \na block of interpreter time reserved on Wednesday mornings, but that too has been \neliminated.  Interpreters do remain available on an on call basis, however. \n \nAs a result of these cutbacks, the interpreters have apparently had to pursue other work \nand are no longer as available as they once were.  Both the defenders and the interpreters \nhave expressed fear that this new system will further cut back on interpreter time and \nmake it even more difficult to arrange to communicate with Spanish-speaking clients or \nwitnesses, particularly if the interpreters are forced to pursue other employment \nopportunities that further reduce their availability. \n \nThe details of this new system remain unclear to me, and I do not believe any changes \nhave yet been implemented, so it may be that the concerns detailed above prove \nunfounded.  I plan to monitor this issue closely in the fourth quarter and will apprise the \ncourt and the parties of any issues that arise. \n \n \nConflicts \n \nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales was definitely more attentive to conflict issues \nduring the third quarter, and this was a positive development.  On two occasions when \nconflicts were discovered mid-case, he addressed them promptly and appropriately.  In \naddition, Mr. Gonzales addressed procedural issues relating to investigator conflicts, \nthough I have not yet had a chance to review those changes. \n \nWith respect to the basic conflict check procedures, however, I have concerns about some \nadjustments that were made during the third quarter.  Rather than simply checking past \ncase assignments for prior representation of a victim or witness, Grant County now \nchecks those past assignments for any involvement of a victim or witness in any capacity.  \nThis practice dramatically expands the scope of the Department’s policy, leading to the \nidentification of far more potential conflicts, though virtually none of these potential \nconflicts are actual conflicts.  For example, if a Wal-Mart security guard is a listed \nwitness, Grant County’s new conflict check procedure will identify a conflict for every \nlawyer who had a prior case that occurred at Wal-Mart involving that security guard.  For \none defendant recently picked up on a warrant, the Department’s new conflict check \nprocedure identified Janelle Peterson as having a conflict due to prior representation \ninvolving the same witnesses.  Upon further review, I discovered that the prior \nrepresentation was actually of the same defendant on the same case as she had been the \nassigned attorney when warrant was issued.  Because the new procedure flagged a \n2009 Quarterly Report - 16 of 21 \n\nconflict, however, the case was assigned to new counsel rather than returned to Ms. \nPeterson. \n \nIf Grant County used this procedure solely as an initial screening mechanism and then \nlooked more closely at each potential conflict, the system would be labor intensive but \nworkable.  Unfortunately, Grant County seldom reviews the conflicts further.  In most \ncases, the preliminary results are the final results, and all the false positives are presumed \nto be conflicts.  This is problematic for a two reasons.  First, this system will \nunnecessarily increase the use of conflict counsel.  When false positives make it appear \nthat an all-defender conflict exists, Grant County will end up hiring outside counsel even \nthough its defenders do not have a real conflict.  Second, repeat offenders will be less \nlikely to be represented by the same public defender when a new charge is filed.  \nConsistency of representation is beneficial in that both attorney and client already have a \nrelationship, a familiarity with each other that gives the defense a head start.  Consistency \nalso benefits the County as it reduces the number of attorneys who will be conflicted out \nof future representation.  If defendants are assigned to a different public defender each \ntime they come through the system, the number of conflicts, and thus the expense of \nconflict counsel, will increase substantially over time. \n \nI will continue discuss conflict check policy with Mr. Gonzales during the fourth quarter \nand hope that Grant County will have an approved policy in place by the end of the \nquarter.  Meanwhile, Grant County has purchased case management software and expects \nto begin implementation in the near future.  Gail Sundean, who has worked with this \nparticular software in the past, advises that it will make conflict checks easier.  It remains \nunclear whether the Department of Public Defense will be able to import case assignment \ndata from its existing database into the new software system.  If not, Grant County will \neither have to enter the data manually or maintain a dual system for the foreseeable \nfuture.   \n \n \nSupervising Attorney \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that the Monitor “oversee and assess the Supervising \nAttorney’s performance.”  In August, I contacted counsel for Grant County to discuss Mr. \nGonzales’ performance as Supervising Attorney and to advise the County more fully \nregarding my reservations about his work to date.  I offered to meet with the Grant \nCounty Commissioners to further discuss the issue if they wished.  Unfortunately, \nanother of Grant County’s attorneys, who had not been involved in prior discussions of \nthis matter, apparently took umbrage at my assessment and wrote emphatically of his \nongoing support for Mr. Gonzales.  As I have tried to stress from the outset, my role with \nrespect to Grant County’s Supervising Attorney is purely advisory.  The Settlement \nAgreement compels me to provide a candid assessment of his performance, but Grant \nCounty is free to disregard that assessment.   \n \nThough Grant County is apparently satisfied with Mr. Gonzales’ performance at this \ntime, I continue to have concerns.  Mr. Gonzales has a great deal of experience as a \n2009 Quarterly Report - 17 of 21 \n\npublic defender and a reputation as a skilled trial lawyer, but the traits that allow one to \nexcel as a front line defender do not necessarily make one a good supervisor.  While the \nthird quarter was not as chaotic as the second, I nonetheless continued to find significant \nproblems with supervision. \n \nIn reviewing case assignments for July, for example, I found a case in which Mr. \nGonzales delayed assigning counsel to an in-custody defendant for a month.  Upon \nfurther review, I discovered that the problems with the case went far deeper than the \ndelay in assigning a lawyer.  H. V. was charged with Assault 2, but at his first appearance \non June 8, the court found no probable cause to detain the defendant.  There was some \ndiscussion of an I.C.E. hold, however, and the court noted that the defendant would \nremain in custody until that hold was cleared.  This was treated by the jail as a no bail \nhold on the criminal matter.   \n \nThough the court appointed counsel on June 8 at first appearance, Supervising Attorney \nRay Gonzales did not assign counsel as directed.  He apparently believed counsel was \nunnecessary because he anticipated that the defendant would quickly be taken into the \ncustody of immigration officials.  In fact, the no bail hold in the criminal case prevented \nthat from happening. \n \nOn June 15, H. V. was brought before the court for arraignment.  When the matter was \ncalled late that afternoon, Brett Billingsley volunteered to stand in for arraignment as \ncounsel had not yet been assigned.  Mr. Billingsley, apparently unaware of circumstances \nof the case, did not make a motion for release or object to the continued detention of H.V. \nwithout probable cause.  The matter was set for omnibus hearing on July 7.  Although   \nH. V. continued to be held in custody on the criminal matter and had an omnibus hearing \nscheduled, Mr. Gonzales still did not assign counsel. \n \nOn July 7, in-house defender John Doherty had finished in court for the day and was \npreparing to leave when he noticed that an inmate remained in the jury box but no other \ndefenders were present.  To his credit, though he had not been assigned the case, Mr. \nDoherty looked into the matter and stood in to represent the client at that hearing.  Mr. \nDoherty correctly objected to the continued detention of the defendant in the absence of \nprobable cause.  A second judge reviewed the case at that time, and he too found no \nprobable cause to detain.  The defendant had been held on the case for 31 days at that \npoint.  Nonetheless, the court agreed to give the State additional time to argue probable \ncause and continued the matter to July 14. \n \nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales finally assigned the case to John Doherty after the \nomnibus hearing on July 7, approximately a month after he had been ordered to so by the \ncourt.  During that month’s delay, no one visited the client in jail.  No one worked on his \ncase.  No one did anything to seek his release from custody. \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 18 of 21 \n\nOn July 14, a colleague covered for Mr. Doherty10 at the omnibus hearing and agreed to \ncontinue the matter to July 21.  H. V. had been in custody for 38 days at that point \nwithout any finding of probable cause to detain; yet the matter was simply continued with \nthe apparent consent of defense counsel.   \n \nOn July 21, Mr. Doherty appeared for the second time and again objected to the \ncontinued detention of H. V. without probable cause.  The court declined to address the \nmatter and directed the defense to either argue the issue in front of the original judge or \nappeal to a higher court.  An omnibus order was entered, and the matter was scheduled \nfor a CrR 3.5 hearing. \n \nOn August 3, counsel visited H. V. in jail for the first time. H. V. had been held in \ncustody without probable cause for 58 days at that point.  On August 4, 2009, the day his \ntrial was scheduled to begin, H. V. pled guilty to Assault 3 and was sentenced to one \nmonth in jail with credit for time served.  He had already served twice his recommended \nsentence at that point.  Although the defendant was known to have immigration issues, \nthe plea was not executed with those concerns in mind.  By incorrectly listing the mens \nrea as intent rather than negligence and adopting the probable cause statement rather than \nhaving the defendant write his own, H. V.’s public defender may have created an entirely \nnew basis for deportation, a problem that could easily have been avoided.11 \n \nH. V.’s case was completely mishandled from the start.  An indigent defendant being \nheld without probable cause on a no bail hold should have been treated with the utmost \nurgency by the Grant County Department of Public Defense.  Supervising Attorney Ray \nGonzales should have immediately appointed counsel as directed by the court.  \nMoreover, he should have closely monitored the progress of the case to ensure that \nassigned counsel was treating the matter with the appropriate seriousness and sense of \nurgency as well as to provide guidance as to how to proceed in this very unusual \ncircumstance.   \n \nHad counsel been assigned, he or she could have sought the defendant’s release at \narraignment, if not sooner.  Indeed, the original judge’s intentions in this matter are not at \nall clear, and it is entirely possible that he never meant for the defendant to be held on the \ncriminal matter.  That same judge was on the bench a week later for H. V.’s arraignment, \nand had the question been brought before him then, the situation might have been \nresolved that day.  If not, the issue should have been briefed and promptly brought before \nthe court again in order to either persuade the court to reconsider or to make a record for \nappeal.  If all efforts in the trial court failed, the assigned attorney, with the assistance of \nMr. Gonzales, should have filed an emergency writ with the Court of Appeals seeking the \n                                                 \n10 Mr. Doherty was apparently in Pierce County addressing another matter as part of the wind down of his \nprivate practice. \n11 Assault 3 is one of the few felonies that does not automatically result in deportation.  In evaluating \nwhether an offense warrants deportation, federal courts look to the “record of conviction.”  In this case, the \nrecord of conviction in problematic in two ways: (1) the listed elements are inaccurate; and (2) the probable \ncause statement likely reflects conduct that constitutes a deportable offense under federal law. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 19 of 21 \n\nimmediate release of the defendant.  Indeed, this type of situation is precisely why the \nwrit process exists. \n \nUnfortunately, none of these steps ever occurred.  No one ever brought the matter back \nbefore the original judge.  No one filed a formal motion for release with authority for the \ncourt to review.  No one filed or even considered filing a writ with the Court of Appeals.  \nNo one visited this Spanish-speaking client in jail until the day before his trial date.  No \none investigated the underlying facts of a case in which two judges found no probable \ncause.  Instead, Mr. Gonzales first delayed appointing counsel for a month, and after \nfinally rectifying that mistake, he then failed to ensure that the case was properly handled \nfor another month after that.  The case just bumped along on the court’s docket until         \nH. V.’s trial date arrived.  Mr. Gonzales acknowledges that the Department’s handling of \nH. V.’s case was “not our finest hour” but even now does not seem to comprehend his \nown failings in this matter.  For some reason, though he espouses an aggressive approach \nto casework, Mr. Gonzales takes a very passive approach to supervision.   \n \nAs Supervising Attorney, Mr. Gonzales is charged with overseeing all of Grant County’s \npublic defenders.  Among other tasks, he is expected to provide a measure of quality \ncontrol.  Yet, I find this aspect of supervision to be lacking in Grant County.  As Mr. \nGonzales himself frequently notes, he presumes competence.  While this philosophy is \nappealingly optimistic, it is in many ways antithetical to management.  If one could truly \npresume competence, there would be little need for a supervisor.  The position would be \nlargely ministerial in nature, and Grant County could simply hire an administrator for the \nprogram.  An effective manager presumes neither competence nor incompetence; he \noversees his employees in such a way as to know whether employees are competent or \nnot.   Over time, Mr. Gonzales will learn the strengths and weaknesses of the various \ndefenders, and some will prove to require less supervision than others, but to embrace a \nsort of blind trust from the outset is an abdication of managerial responsibility.  A \npresumption of competence may be warranted if it is has been earned, but during his \ntenure with Grant County, Mr. Gonzales has presumed competence without any basis for \ndoing so.  To avoid this problem in the future, Mr. Gonzales needs to be more proactive \nin monitoring his staff.  Rather than presume Grant County’s defenders are visiting their \nclients in jail, requesting investigation, and filing motions, for example, he should know \nwhether they are or not.  Taking this approach will allow Mr. Gonzales to address issues \nearly on, before problems become chronic or a crisis develops.   \n \nI have had extensive discussions with Mr. Gonzales in recent months regarding my hope \nthat he will hold Grant County’s defenders to the same high standard he would expect of \nhimself in representing Grant County’s indigent defendants.  I have also emphasized to \nhim that he should take the lead in defining practice standards for the defenders.  In our \ndiscussions, Mr. Gonzales and I frequently agree about legal issues and strategies, but \nthere seems to be a disconnect when it comes to Mr. Gonzales imparting his views to the \ndefenders.  For example, Mr. Gonzales and I agree that whenever possible, the attorneys \nshould avoid checking the box on the standard guilty plea form indicating that the \n2009 Quarterly Report - 20 of 21 \n\ndefendant adopts the probable cause statement as his own.12  Yet I recently pointed out to \nMr. Gonzales that most of the Grant County defenders were doing so as a matter of \nroutine.  To his credit, after our discussion, Mr. Gonzales addressed this issue with the \ndefenders and explained his views regarding best practices in completing plea forms.  Mr. \nGonzales must do more of this.  His knowledge and experience is only helpful to the \ndefenders if he actively engages them on issues and cases.  In the future, Mr. Gonzales \nneeds to be attentive when opportunities to teach arise whether those opportunities relate \nto the practice of an individual defender or the group as a whole.  I was pleased to learn \nfrom his September report that Mr. Gonzales is scheduling performance evaluations for \nthe in-house defenders.13  Perhaps the structure of the evaluation process will provide Mr. \nGonzales just the opportunity he needs to mentor his staff and work to raise the overall \nlevel of practice in Grant County.    \n \n \nConclusion \n \nGrant County public defense remains in a state of transition.  The in-house office is just \nover six months old, and a majority of the defenders are new to the program this year.     \nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales and these new defenders will define the direction of \nGrant County public defense over the coming months.  I look forward to observing the \ngrowth process of this new program.  Hopefully, Mr. Gonzales will set high standards \nand the defenders will exceed them.   \n \n \n                                                 \n12 Adopting the probable cause statement can cause a host of problems in future proceedings in immigration \ncourt, federal court, and/or court of other states. \n13 Mr. Gonzales should also evaluate the contract defenders as he is responsible for supervising them as \nwell. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 21 of 21 ",

The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and \n43 \n44 \nSections 3 (due process), 12 (equal protection), and 22 (right to counsel) of Article I of the \n45 \n46 \nWashington State Constitution guarantee indigent persons charged with felony crimes the \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 1  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \nright to effective assistance of counsel.  This right is fundamental and is essential to a fair \n1 \n2 \ntrial.  See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963). \n3 \n4 \n2.  Defendant Grant County has a constitutional duty to operate a public defense \n5 \n6 \nsystem that provides indigent persons charged with felony crimes with the effective \n7 \n8 \nassistance of counsel.  The Grant County Board of Commissioners (the \"Board\") is the \n9 \n10 \nexecutive authority of defendant Grant County.  The members of the Board are LeRoy C. \n11 \n12 \nAllison, Deborah Kay Moore, and Tim Snead.  The Board is responsible for establishing, \n13 \n14 \nimplementing, and maintaining the Grant County public defense system. \n15 \n16 \n3.  Defendant Grant County, under the direction of the Board, has breached its \n17 \n18 \nconstitutional duties by operating a public defense system that regularly and systematically \n19 \n20 \ndeprives indigent persons of the effective assistance of counsel.  Among other things, \n21 \n22 \ndefendant Grant County, acting at the direction and under the control of the Board, has \n23 \n24 \nfailed to ensure that public defenders are qualified, has failed to impose reasonable caseload \n25 \n26 \nlimits on public defenders, has failed to monitor and oversee the public defense system, has \n27 \n28 \nfailed to provide adequate funds for public defense, has failed to provide representation at all \n29 \n30 \ncritical stages of prosecutions, and has failed to protect the independence of public \n31 \n32 \ndefenders. \n33 \n34 \n4.  The Board and other employees of defendant Grant County have known of \n35 \n36 \nthe constitutional deficiencies in the Grant County public defense system for many years.  \n37 \n38 \nBetween 1996 and the present, at least four courts have overturned felony convictions \n39 \n40 \nbecause Grant County public defenders failed to provide effective assistance of counsel.  \n41 \n42 \nThe Washington State Bar Association, moreover, has recommended that two Grant County \n43 \n44 \npublic defenders be disbarred.  This includes Tom Earl, until recently the exclusive holder of \n45 \n46 \nthe 2000-2005 Grant County public defense contract.  In each case, the WSBA found that \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 2  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \nthe public defender engaged in misconduct in connection with representing indigent \n1 \n2 \ndefendants in Grant County. \n3 \n4 \n5.  Despite knowing of the deficiencies in the Grant County public defense \n5 \n6 \nsystem, defendant Grant County has failed to take reasonable steps to protect the \n7 \n8 \nconstitutional rights of indigent persons.  Indeed, even after the WSBA recommended in \n9 \n10 \nJune 2003 that Tom Earl be disbarred for misconduct as a public defender, defendant Grant \n11 \n12 \nCounty refused to terminate Earl as the public defender and refused to terminate his \n13 \n14 \nexclusive public defense contract with Grant County.  Defendant Grant County allowed Earl \n15 \n16 \nto remain in this position until finally, in February 2004, the Washington Supreme Court \n17 \n18 \nsuspended Earl from the practice of law pending the determination of the appeal of his \n19 \n20 \ndisbarment. \n21 \n22 \n6.  Even then, defendant Grant County failed to take reasonable action to protect \n23 \n24 \nthe rights of indigent persons.  Although Earl's suspension had long been a possibility, \n25 \n26 \ndefendant Grant County failed to make reasonable preparations for the suspension.  The \n27 \n28 \nBoard has, instead, allowed the public defense system to descend into chaos.  Things have \n29 \n30 \nbecome so bad that the judges of the Grant County Superior Court recently had to issue a \n31 \n32 \nplan that calls for the conscription of attorneys, some with no criminal defense experience, \n33 \n34 \nto represent indigent persons charged with felonies. \n35 \n36 \n7.  Indigent persons have suffered and continue to suffer harm as a result of \n37 \n38 \nthese violations by defendant Grant County.  Among other things, indigent persons are \n39 \n40 \ndeprived of adequate consultation and communication with their attorneys; indigent persons \n41 \n42 \nmust make decisions about their rights or contest issues without adequate factual or legal \n43 \n44 \ninvestigation by their attorneys; indigent persons are deprived of meaningful opportunities to \n45 \n46 \npresent defenses; the rights of indigent persons are waived without proper consultation and \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 3  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \nadvice; indigent persons are deprived of the services of investigators and expert witnesses; \n1 \n2 \nindigent persons' cases are not properly prepared for trial; and indigent persons do not \n3 \n4 \nreceive meaningful benefits in exchange for guilty pleas. \n5 \n6 \n8.

THE PARTIES \n2 \n3  13.  Plaintiff Jeffrey Best is an indigent person who has been charged with felony \n4 \n5  crimes in Grant County Superior Court.  Best was assigned an attorney.  Best's case is \n6 \n7  currently pending. \n8 \n9  14.  Plaintiff Daniel Campos is an indigent person who has been charged with \n10 \n11  felony crimes in Grant County Superior Court.  Campos was assigned an attorney.  Campos' \n12 \n13  case is currently pending. \n14 \n15  15.  Plaintiff Gary Dale Hutt is an indigent person who has been charged with \n16 \n17  felony crimes in Grant County Superior Court.  Hutt was assigned an attorney.  Hutt's case is \n18 \n19  currently pending. \n20 \n21  16.  Plaintiff Greg Hansen (the \"Taxpayer Plaintiff\") is a taxpaying resident of \n22 \n23  Grant County.  Hansen is interested in ensuring that constitutionally adequate public defense \n24 \n25  is provided to indigent persons in Grant County and that public defense funds are properly \n26 \n27  expended. \n28 \n29  17.  Defendant Grant County is a county of the State of Washington established \n30 \n31  pursuant to RCW 36.04.130. \n32 \n33  IV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n34 \n35  18.  Plaintiffs Best, Campos, and Hutt (collectively, the \"Class Plaintiffs\") bring \n36 \n37  this action pursuant to Civil Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) on behalf of themselves and all others \n38 \n39  similarly situated (collectively the \"Class Members\") as members of the following proposed \n40 \n41  plaintiff class (the \"Class\"): \n42 \n43  All indigent persons who have or will have criminal felony cases \n44  pending in Grant County Superior Court, who are appointed an \n45 \nattorney, and who have not entered into a plea agreement or been \n46 \nconvicted. \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 5  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \n19.  The Class is so numerous that the individual joinder of all members is \n1 \n2 \nimpracticable.  At any point in time, several hundred indigent persons with felony criminal \n3 \n4 \ncases pending in the Grant County Superior Court rely on appointed counsel for legal \n5 \n6 \nrepresentation. \n7 \n8 \n20.  There are questions of law and fact common to the Class. \n9 \n10 \n21.  The questions of law and fact common to all members of the Class include \n11 \n12 \nbut are not limited to: (a) whether defendant Grant County has a duty to provide indigent \n13 \n14 \npersons charged with felony crimes with the effective assistance of counsel; and (b) whether \n15 \n16 \ndefendant Grant County has breached those duties. \n17 \n18 \n22.  The Class Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of the Class.   \n19 \n20 \n23.  The Class Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \n21 \n22 \nClass.  There are no conflicts of interest between the Class Plaintiffs and other Class \n23 \n24 \nMembers.  The Class Plaintiffs will vigorously prosecute this action on behalf of the Class.  \n25 \n26 \nThe Class Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel.  Those counsel collectively have \n27 \n28 \nexperience in civil rights, indigent defendants' rights, criminal procedure, and civil litigation.  \n29 \n30 \nThey will vigorously prosecute the case on behalf of the Class. \n31 \n32 \n24.

FACTS ENTITLING PLAINTIFFS TO RELIEF \n8 \n9  A.  Grant County's Duty to Provide Effective Assistance of Counsel for \n10  Indigent Persons Charged with Felony Crimes \n11 \n12  27.  The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and \n13 \n14  Sections 3, 12, and 22 of Article I of the Washington State Constitution guarantee to every \n15 \n16  indigent person charged with a felony crime the right to effective assistance of counsel. \n17 \n18  28.  Defendant Grant County has a constitutional duty to provide every indigent \n19 \n20  person charged with a felony crime in Grant County Superior Court with effective assistance \n21 \n22  of counsel. \n23 \n24  29.  The Washington State Legislature has specifically found that effective legal \n25 \n26  representation should be provided for all indigent persons where the right to counsel \n27 \n28  attaches.  RCW 10.101.005 (\"The legislature finds that effective legal representation should \n29 \n30  be provided for indigent persons and persons who are indigent and able to contribute, \n31 \n32  consistent with the constitutional requirements of fairness, equal protection, and due process \n33 \n34  in all cases where the right to counsel attaches.\"). \n35 \n36  30.  Washington law requires counties to adopt specific standards for the delivery \n37 \n38  of public defense services and provides that \"the standards endorsed by the Washington \n39 \n40  State Bar Association for the provision of public defense services may serve as guidelines to \n41 \n42  contracting authorities.\"  RCW 10.101.030.  A copy of the standards endorsed by the \n43 \n44  Washington State Bar Association for the provision of public defense services (the \"WSBA \n45 \n46  Standards\") is attached hereto as Exhibit A.   \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 7  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \n31.  Defendant Grant County has failed to comply with RCW 10.101.030.  \n1 \n2 \nInstead, Grant County, by and through the Board, has adopted a resolution that falls short of \n3 \n4 \nthe requirements of RCW 10.101.030 and deviates in important respects from the WSBA \n5 \n6 \nStandards.  A copy of the Grant County Resolution is attached hereto as Exhibit B. \n7 \n8 \n9  B.  Overview of the Grant County Public Defense System  \n10 \n11  32.  At all relevant times prior to February 12, 2004, defendant Grant County, by \n12 \n13  and through the Board, maintained a contract system of providing for the defense of indigent \n14 \n15  persons charged with felony crimes in Grant County Superior Court.   \n16 \n17  33.  Under that system, defendant Grant County, by and through the Board, \n18 \n19  contracted with one attorney or law firm to provide all indigent defense services in Grant \n20 \n21  County Superior Court.  This included representation in connection with pre-charging \n22 \n23  activities, pre-trial hearings, plea negotiations, trial, post-trial motions, filing notices of \n24 \n25  appeal, probation revocation hearings, certain civil proceedings, and material witness \n26 \n27  proceedings. \n28 \n29  34.  The contracting attorney or firm was permitted to delegate cases to other \n30 \n31  attorneys. \n32 \n33  35.  Between January 1996 and December 31, 2000, the Board caused defendant \n34 \n35  Grant County to contract with Earl & Earl, P.S. to provide all public defense services to \n36 \n37  indigent persons charged with felony crimes in Grant County.   \n38 \n39  36.  Earl & Earl delegated many of those cases to Thomas Earl and Guillermo \n40 \n41  Romero, as well as other attorneys. \n42 \n43  37.  In December 2000, the Board caused defendant Grant County to enter into an \n44 \n45  exclusive five-year contract with Thomas Earl to provide all public defense services to \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 8  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \nindigent persons charged with felony crimes in Grant County (the \"2000-2005 Public \n1 \n2 \nDefense Contract\").   \n3 \n4 \n38.  Under the 2000-2005 Public Defense Contract, defendant Grant County \n5 \n6 \nagreed to pay Earl a flat fee for the representation of all indigent persons in connection with \n7 \n8 \nfelony criminal matters in Grant County, regardless of the number of cases, the complexity \n9 \n10 \nof the cases, or the actual costs incurred in the defense of the cases.   \n11 \n12 \n39.  The flat fee paid to Earl had to cover attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, \n13 \n14 \nprivate investigator fees, and all other costs of mounting an effective defense in cases \n15 \n16 \nhandled by all assigned counsel (with the exception of a very limited number of \n17 \n18 \n\"extraordinary cases\"). \n19 \n20 \n40.  Earl had virtually unfettered discretion over the administration of the Grant \n21 \n22 \nCounty public defense system, including the assignment of cases. \n23 \n24 \n41.  Earl delegated some of the cases assigned under the 2000-2005 Public \n25 \n26 \nDefense Contract to other attorneys, including Guillermo Romero. \n27 \n28 \n29  C.  The Judicial Findings of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel, and the \n30  Disbarment Recommendations for Earl and Romero \n31 \n32  42.  At least four state and federal courts have found that Earl (two cases) or \n33 \n34  Romero (two cases) failed to provide indigent persons charged with felonies with effective \n35 \n36  assistance of counsel.  Copies of these decisions are attached hereto as Exhibits C-F.   \n37 \n38  43.  Although the Board and other Grant County employees were aware of these \n39 \n40  judicial findings of serious constitutional violations by Grant County public defenders, \n41 \n42  defendant Grant County failed to take reasonable steps to protect indigent persons and \n43 \n44  secure their constitutional rights.  Among other things, defendant Grant County did not \n45 \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 9  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \nterminate the 2000-2005 Public Defense Contract and permitted Earl to continue to serve as \n1 \n2 \npublic defender. \n3 \n4 \n44.  On or about June 28, 2001, the Washington State Bar Association charged \n5 \n6 \nGuillermo Romero with violating the Rules of Professional Conduct in connection, in part, \n7 \n8 \nwith his conduct as a Grant County public defender.   \n9 \n10 \n45.  On or about July 13, 2001, the Washington State Bar Association charged \n11 \n12 \nThomas Earl, the exclusive holder of the 2000-2005 Public Defense Contract, with violating \n13 \n14 \nthe Rules of Professional Conduct in connection with his conduct as a Grant County public \n15 \n16 \ndefender.   \n17 \n18 \n46.  On or about November 15, 2002, a Washington State Bar Association hearing \n19 \n20 \nofficer found that Romero had committed multiple violations of the Rules of Professional \n21 \n22 \nConduct and recommended that Romero be disbarred.  Washington State Bar Association v. \n23 \n24 \nGuillermo Romero, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Hearing Officer's \n25 \n26 \nRecommendation (November 15, 2002), attached hereto as Exhibit G.  The Washington \n27 \n28 \nState Bar Association Disciplinary Board affirmed, and the recommendation is now on \n29 \n30 \nappeal to the Washington Supreme Court. \n31 \n32 \n47.  On June 17, 2003, a Washington State Bar Association hearing officer found \n33 \n34 \nthat Earl had committed multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct and \n35 \n36 \nrecommended that Earl be disbarred.  The officer found that Earl engaged in conduct \n37 \n38 \ninvolving dishonesty, fraud and deceit causing serious injury to indigent clients in the Grant \n39 \n40 \nCounty public defense system.  See Washington State Bar Association v. Thomas Earl, \n41 \n42 \nFindings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Hearing Officer's Recommendation ¶¶ 6.4-6.7 \n43 \n44 \n(June 17, 2003), attached hereto as Exhibit H.  The Washington State Bar Association \n45 \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 10  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \nDisciplinary Board affirmed the disbarment recommendation on about November 24, 2003.  \n1 \n2 \nThat recommendation is now on appeal to the Washington Supreme Court. \n3 \n4 \n48.  The Hearing Officer in the Earl disciplinary proceedings expressly found that \n5 \n6 \nthe Grant County public defense system was deficient in several respects.  Among other \n7 \n8 \nthings, the Hearing Officer found that the Grant County system \"created an environment in \n9 \n10 \nwhich the potential for conflicts of interest and abuse were exacerbated,\" and that the \n11 \n12 \ndelivery of public defense services in Grant County fell short of the WSBA standards with \n13 \n14 \nrespect to compensation, caseload limits, and inadequate limits on private practice.  Id. \n15 \n16 \n§§ 3.18-3.19. \n17 \n18 \n49.  Although the Board and other Grant County employees were aware of these \n19 \n20 \nfindings that Earl and Romero had committed numerous violations in connection with their \n21 \n22 \nwork as public defenders, defendant Grant County failed to take reasonable steps to protect \n23 \n24 \nindigent persons and secure their constitutional rights.  Among other things, defendant Grant \n25 \n26 \nCounty did not terminate the 2000-2005 Public Defense Contract and permitted Earl to \n27 \n28 \ncontinue to serve as a public defender. \n29 \n30 \n31  D.  The Public Defense System Is In Chaos \n32 \n33  50.  Earl continued to hold the exclusive public defense contract with Grant \n34 \n35  County and to serve as a public defender at all times between the disbarment \n36 \n37  recommendation on June 17, 2003 and February 12, 2004.  On that date, the Washington \n38 \n39  Supreme Court ordered that Earl be immediately suspended pending the determination of his \n40 \n41  appeal of the WSBA disbarment recommendation.   \n42 \n43  51.  Despite the suspension order, Earl continued to appear in Grant County \n44 \n45  Superior Court as late as February 17, 2004. \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 11  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \n52.  Although the disciplinary proceedings against Earl had been pending for \n1 \n2 \nmore than 2½ years, defendant Grant County failed to make reasonable provision for \n3 \n4 \nindigent defense services in the event of Earl's suspension. \n5 \n6 \n53.  As a result of defendant Grant County's acts and omissions, the Grant County \n7 \n8 \nindigent defense system has been thrown into chaos.   \n9 \n10 \n54.  Defendant Grant County has not implemented any effective system for \n11 \n12 \nhiring, retaining, supervising or paying attorneys to represent indigent persons charged with \n13 \n14 \nfelonies, and attorneys with public defense experience are being compelled to handle far \n15 \n16 \nmore cases than they can defend effectively. \n17 \n18 \n55.  Matters have gotten so bad that judges on the Grant County Superior Court \n19 \n20 \nhave issued a plan to conscript attorneys—including trusts and estates attorneys, business \n21 \n22 \nattorneys, and others with no criminal defense experience—to represent indigent persons in \n23 \n24 \nfelony matters.  The only \"qualification\" for this compulsory service is that the attorney's \n25 \n26 \nplace of work not be located too far from the courthouse.  See Memorandum from the \n27 \n28 \nHonorable Evan E. Sperline, dated March 12, 2004, attached hereto as Exhibit I.   \n29 \n30 \n56.  Most recently, the Board has proposed to enter into separate contracts with a \n31 \n32 \nnumber of individual attorneys to provide public defense services.  The separate contract \n33 \n34 \nsystem proposed by the Board, however, is at least as flawed as the prior system and fails to \n35 \n36 \nsecure the constitutional rights of indigent persons.  See Proposed Contract, attached hereto \n37 \n38 \nas Exhibit J.  Among other things, the proposed contracts fail to implement effective \n39 \n40 \nmonitoring and supervision, fail to ensure that public defenders are fully qualified, and \n41 \n42 \ncontinue to underfund public defense. \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 12  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \n1  E.  Defendant Grant County, By and Through the Board, Has Failed to \n2  Establish a Public Defense System that Provides Effective Assistance of \n3  Counsel to All Indigent Persons Charged With Felony Crimes \n4 \n5  57.  Throughout the relevant time, defendant Grant County, by and through the \n6 \n7  Board, has breached its constitutional duties by establishing and perpetuating a public \n8 \n9  defense system that routinely deprives indigent persons of their constitutional rights to the \n10 \n11  effective assistance of counsel.   \n12 \n13 \n(i)  Defendant Grant County Has Failed To Ensure That All Public \n14 \nDefenders Meet Professional Qualifications \n15 \n16 \n58.  Defendant Grant County has failed to ensure that all public defenders meet \n17 \n18 \nminimum professional qualifications. \n19 \n20 \n59.  Prior to February 2004, the Board knowingly caused Grant County to enter \n21 \n22 \ninto and maintain a contract with a public defender, Tom Earl, who failed to meet minimum \n23 \n24 \nprofessional qualifications and who demonstrated that he did not provide effective assistance \n25 \n26 \nof counsel to indigent persons. \n27 \n28 \n60.  Defendant Grant County, moreover, permitted Earl to delegate cases to other \n29 \n30 \npublic defenders without demonstrating that they met accepted professional standards for the \n31 \n32 \nprovision of public defense services. \n33 \n34 \n61.  Since February 2004, defendant Grant County has failed to ensure that public \n35 \n36 \ndefenders meet professional qualifications.   \n37 \n38 \n62.  The current plan to conscript all members of the bar to defend indigent \n39 \n40 \npersons charged with felony crimes – regardless of their experience in criminal law – \n41 \n42 \nvirtually assures that indigent persons will be represented by unqualified attorneys and will \n43 \n44 \nbe deprived of effective assistance of counsel.   \n45 \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 13  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \n1  (ii)  Defendant Grant County Has Failed to Impose Reasonable \n2  Caseload Limits \n3 \n4  63.  Defendant Grant County has failed to impose reasonable caseload limits on \n5 \n6  public defenders and others providing public defense services. \n7 \n8  64.  Prior to February 2004, defendant Grant County regularly permitted \n9 \n10  caseloads to exceed the Washington State Bar Association's recommended ceiling of 150 \n11 \n12  felony cases per year for defense attorneys who devote 100% of their time to public defense.   \n13 \n14  65.  Tom Earl, the primary public defender, during some periods handled more \n15 \n16  than 300 new public defense cases per year, plus private cases. \n17 \n18  66.  Judges in the Grant County Superior Court have recognized that this system \n19 \n20  resulted in some lawyers having an excessive caseload.   \n21 \n22  67.  Although the judges of the Grant County Superior Court imposed some \n23 \n24  caseload limits in 2003, those limits did not comply with the Washington State Bar \n25 \n26  Association standards, and the chief judge of the Grant County Superior Court has candidly \n27 \n28  acknowledged that caseloads remained \"too high under applicable standards.\" \n29 \n30  68.  Under the current chaos, there are no caseload limits, and, according to the \n31 \n32  chief judge of the Grant County Superior Court, some attorneys have been receiving new \n33 \n34  cases at a rate of 28 cases per month (336 per year), double the maximum recommended by \n35 \n36  the WSBA. \n37 \n38  69.  Although the single attorney contracts proposed by defendant Grant County \n39 \n40  purport to limit caseloads to 150 felonies per year, those limits are illusory.  They do not \n41 \n42  prohibit attorneys from taking private cases – a major element of the Washington State Bar \n43 \n44  Association guidelines.  Moreover, they do not limit many types of matters that contracting \n45 \n46  attorneys would be required to handle. \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 14  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \n1  (iii)  Defendant Grant County Has Failed to Monitor or Oversee the \n2  Public Defense System \n3 \n4  70.  Defendant Grant County has failed properly to monitor or oversee the public \n5 \n6  defense system.   \n7 \n8  71.  Defendant Grant County has failed to implement effective mechanisms for \n9 \n10  monitoring the performance of public defenders. \n11 \n12  72.  Defendant Grant County has failed to adopt meaningful publicized criteria \n13 \n14  for evaluating public defenders.   \n15 \n16  73.  Defendant Grant County has failed to obtain even rudimentary information \n17 \n18  about the administration and operation of the public defense system, much less the robust \n19 \n20  and meaningful information essential to fulfilling its constitutional duties. \n21 \n22  74.  Defendant Grant County has failed to establish any system for monitoring \n23 \n24  and overseeing the assignment or reassignment of cases.  As a result, cases have often been \n25 \n26  assigned late, assigned to attorneys without adequate experience or time, or reassigned to the \n27 \n28  detriment of the indigent client. \n29 \n30  75.  Defendant Grant County has not established any system for ensuring that \n31 \n32  public defenders investigate cases, prepare for trial, and communicate timely and adequately \n33 \n34  with clients. \n35 \n36  76.  Defendant Grant County has failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the \n37 \n38  private practices of attorneys providing public defense does not impair the public defense \n39 \n40  system. \n41 \n42  77.  Defendant Grant County has failed to establish an effective system for \n43 \n44  preventing conflicts of interest. \n45 \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 15  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \n1  (iv)  Defendant Grant County Has Failed to Provide Adequate Funds \n2  for Public Defense \n3 \n4  78.  Defendant Grant County, by and through the Board, is responsible for \n5 \n6  providing funding for the Grant County public defense system. \n7 \n8  79.  Defendant Grant County has consistently failed to fund indigent defense at a \n9 \n10  level that is sufficient to ensure constitutionally adequate representation. \n11 \n12  80.  Under the 2000-2005 Public Defense Contract, the total amount of funds \n13 \n14  available to pay for all aspects of indigent defense in Grant County Superior Court was fixed \n15 \n16  at $500,000 per year.   \n17 \n18  81.  This amount was required to cover attorneys' fees, investigation costs, expert \n19 \n20  witness fees, and all other costs for virtually all felony prosecutions, pre-charging \n21 \n22  representation, the representation of material witnesses, fugitive proceedings, extradition \n23 \n24  proceedings, probation violation hearings, reference hearings, and civil matters in which \n25 \n26  indigent persons were entitled to court-appointed counsel.   \n27 \n28  82.  That amount was not sufficient to ensure constitutionally adequate \n29 \n30  representation in the system then in place.   \n31 \n32  83.  Currently, defendant Grant County has failed to make adequate provision for \n33 \n34  the defense of indigent persons charged with felony crimes.  The Superior Court judges in \n35 \n36  Grant County have been forced to conscript attorneys to provide indigent defense services \n37 \n38  without telling them how they will be compensated. \n39 \n40  84.  The draft contracts proposed by defendant Grant County would not remedy \n41 \n42  this deficiency in that they do not provide enough funding to secure effective assistance of \n43 \n44  counsel to all indigent defendants. \n45 \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 16  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \n1  (v)  Defendant Grant County Has Failed to Provide Adequate Funds \n2  to Pay Necessary Costs of Defense \n3 \n4  85.  Defendant Grant County has failed to provide funds to hire investigators and \n5 \n6  expert witnesses, or to provide other essential services. \n7 \n8  86.  For many years prior to February 2004, costs for expert witnesses, \n9 \n10  investigators and similar expenses were required to be paid out of the same limited funds \n11 \n12  available to pay attorneys, rather than by Grant County in response to a separate request.  \n13 \n14  (The sole exception was for \"extraordinary cases.\")  This created a conflict of interest for \n15 \n16  attorneys required to choose between their own income and retaining an expert or \n17 \n18  investigator for a client, and often deprived indigent persons of essential services, such as \n19 \n20  investigators and experts. \n21 \n22  87.  Currently, defendant Grant County has failed to make reasonable provision \n23 \n24  for funding necessary costs of indigent defense, such as hiring investigators and expert \n25 \n26  witnesses.  Investigators, experts, and others have no assurance that their fees and other \n27 \n28  expenses will be paid.  Attorneys who advance fees and other expenses have no assurance \n29 \n30  that they will be reimbursed. \n31 \n32  88.  The draft contracts proposed by defendant Grant County do not fix these \n33 \n34  flaws.  The only way to obtain funding for necessary defense costs under the proposed \n35 \n36  contracts is through a court order, available only after notice to the prosecution.  Not only is \n37 \n38  this method uncertain, it requires the defense to disclose its strategy to the court and the \n39 \n40  prosecution, permits the prosecution to interfere with the defense, and would erect \n41 \n42  inappropriate barriers to obtaining necessary defense services. \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 17  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \n1  (vi)  Defendant Grant County Has Failed to Provide Representation \n2  At All Critical Stages of Prosecution \n3 \n4  89.  Defendant Grant County has a constitutional duty to provide indigent persons \n5 \n6  with effective representation of counsel at all critical stages of a prosecution.   \n7 \n8  90.  Defendant Grant County has routinely failed to provide any representation at \n9 \n10  initial appearances.   \n11 \n12  91.  In many instances, indigent persons must face the court and the prosecution \n13 \n14  in their first appearances without any counsel.   \n15 \n16  92.  As a result, indigent persons often make statements that are used against them \n17 \n18  in subsequent proceedings, and indigent persons are required to post excessive bail, \n19 \n20  requiring them to spend time in jail unnecessarily.   \n21 \n22  (vii)  Defendant Grant County Has Undermined the Independence of \n23 \nPublic Defenders \n24 \n25  93.  Defendant Grant County has failed to protect the independence of public \n26 \n27  defenders and the public defense system, and, in fact, has undermined that independence. \n28 \n29  94.  Defendant Grant County has allowed the Grant County Prosecuting Attorney \n30 \n31  to assist in negotiating contracts for public defense and to advise the Board regarding the \n32 \n33  public defense system.  This creates a conflict of interest and serves as a deterrent to \n34 \n35  vigorous representation by public defenders who are directly or indirectly dependent on \n36 \n37  contracts with Grant County. \n38 \n39 \nF.  Defendant Grant County, By and Through the Board, has Failed to \n40 \nProvide Effective Assistance of Counsel to Class Plaintiffs \n41 \n42 \n(i)  Jeffrey Gregg Best \n43 \n44 \n95.  On January 29, 2004, Jeffrey Gregg Best was charged with Burglary in the \n45 \n46 \nSecond Degree, Theft of Anhydrous Ammonia, Unlawful Storage of Anhydrous Ammonia, \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 18  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \nand Theft in the Second Degree, under information number 04-1-00101-6.  On February 10, \n1 \n2 \n2004, Best was charged with Burglary in the Second Degree and Theft of Anhydrous \n3 \n4 \nAmmonia, under information number 04-1-00142-3.  Best was assigned an attorney to \n5 \n6 \nrepresent him on these charges. \n7 \n8 \n96.  Best has been deprived of his rights to the effective assistance of counsel in \n9 \n10 \nthe following ways, among others:  \n11 \n12 \n  a.  Best was not represented by counsel at his initial appearances.  \n13 \n14 \n  b.  Best has only met with his attorney on three occasions.  None of these \n15 \n16 \nmeetings lasted longer than 10 minutes, and one of the meetings was not planned, but \n17 \n18 \noccurred when Best saw his attorney in the jail as he was returning to his cell.  During the \n19 \n20 \ncourse of these meetings, Best has not had sufficient opportunity to discuss the facts relating \n21 \n22 \nto the charges against him, substantive legal issues, or important litigation strategy. \n23 \n24 \n  c.  Best has been unable to contact his attorney.  Best made several \n25 \n26 \nattempts to contact his attorney, including filing kites (requests to speak with an attorney \n27 \n28 \nfiled with the Grant County Jail and forwarded to defense counsel) and writing letters.  His \n29 \n30 \nattorney acknowledged receiving the kites and letters, but did not respond in substance to \n31 \n32 \nthem. \n33 \n34 \n  d.  Best's attorney has not advised Best of his rights with respect to \n35 \n36 \nimportant pre-trial hearings, including suppression hearings under Criminal Rules 3.5 and \n37 \n38 \n3.6.  These hearings were stricken in one of Best's cases.  Best’s attorney, however, has \n39 \n40 \nnever explained the rationale for not proceeding with the hearings.   \n41 \n42 \n  e.  Best's attorney has not adequately explained the sentencing range \n43 \n44 \napplicable to his case if he is convicted. \n45 \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 19  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \n  f.  Best's attorney has an excessive caseload.  His attorney has informed \n1 \n2 \nBest that his caseload has “doubled” since Thomas Earl was suspended and that he had \n3 \n4 \nrecently been assigned a juvenile defendant charged in Superior Court with first degree \n5 \n6 \nmurder.  As a result of the increased workload, Best's attorney candidly admitted that he has \n7 \n8 \nnot been able to “do the things that should be done” with regard to Best’s case. \n9 \n10 \n11  (ii)  Daniel Rene Campos \n12 \n13  97.  On August 22, 2003, Daniel Rene Campos was charged with two counts of \n14 \n15  Stalking and two counts of Driving With Suspended License, under information number \n16 \n17  03-1-00750-4 (the “2003 Charge”).  On February 9, 2004, Campos was charged with \n18 \n19  Malicious Mischief in the Second Degree, under information number 04-1-00134-2.  On \n20 \n21  March 29, 2004, the information was amended to include a second count of Malicious \n22 \n23  Mischief in the Second Degree and Harassment (the “2004 Charge”).  Campos was assigned \n24 \n25  an attorney. \n26 \n27  98.  Campos has been deprived of his rights to the effective assistance of counsel \n28 \n29  in the following ways, among others:  \n30 \n31    a.  Campos was not represented by counsel at his initial appearance on \n32 \n33  the 2003 Charge. \n34 \n35    b.  During his representation of Campos on the 2003 Charge, Campos's \n36 \n37  attorney only met with him immediately before court dates.  At these meetings, Campos had \n38 \n39  an inadequate opportunity to discuss defending the charges against him. \n40 \n41    c.  After having been represented by the assigned attorney on the 2003 \n42 \n43  Charge for approximately five months, Campos was assigned to a new attorney.  When he \n44 \n45  asked for an explanation, Campos was told that he was provided a new lawyer because of an \n46 \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 20  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \nunidentified conflict of interest.  His new attorney assumed responsibility for Campos’s \n1 \n2 \ndefense under both the 2003 and 2004 Charges. \n3 \n4 \n  d.  At a pre-trial hearing regarding the 2003 Charge, Campos's previous \n5 \n6 \nattorney indicated that there were several witnesses that had not been identified or developed \n7 \n8 \nby the State.  Although his previous attorney indicated that these witnesses would need to be \n9 \n10 \ninterviewed, no interviews took place.   \n11 \n12 \n  e.  Although Campos provided his new attorney with contact information \n13 \n14 \nfor potentially exculpatory witnesses regarding the 2003 Charge, his attorney has failed to \n15 \n16 \nadvise Campos that the witnesses have been interviewed.  Prior to receiving the names of \n17 \n18 \npotentially exculpatory witnesses from Campos, his attorney had already filed a list of \n19 \n20 \nwitnesses for the 2003 Charge.  That list only reserved the right to call Campos and the \n21 \n22 \nwitnesses reserved by the State (two police officers). \n23 \n24 \n  f.  Campos's new attorney had Campos sign a Stipulation to the \n25 \n26 \nAdmissibility of Defendant’s Statements made regarding the 2003 Charge without fully \n27 \n28 \nadvising Campos concerning the contents of those statements, the circumstances under \n29 \n30 \nwhich the statements were made, or the impact of the Stipulation on his defense.   \n31 \n32 \n  g.  Campos's new attorney has not met with Campos for a sufficient \n33 \n34 \namount of time to discuss the facts relating to the charges against him, substantive legal \n35 \n36 \nissues, and important litigation strategy. \n37 \n38 \n39  (iii)  Gary Dale Hutt \n40 \n41  99.  On January 12, 2004, Gary Dale Hutt was charged with Conspiracy to \n42 \n43  Deliver Methamphetamine and Attempted Introducing Contraband in the Second Degree, \n44 \n45  under information number 04-1-00022-2.  On February 24, 2004, the information was \n46 \n47  amended to include charges of Possession of Methamphetamine with Intent to Deliver, \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 21  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \nPossession of Cocaine with Intent to Deliver, Possession of Marijuana with Intent to \n1 \n2 \nDeliver, Conspiracy to Deliver Cocaine, Conspiracy to Delivery Marijuana, and Assault in \n3 \n4 \nthe Second Degree.  Hutt was assigned an attorney.   \n5 \n6 \n100.  Hutt has been deprived of his rights to the effective assistance of counsel in \n7 \n8 \nthe following ways, among others: \n9 \n10 \n  a.  Hutt was not represented by counsel at his initial appearance on the \n11 \n12 \nabove charges. \n13 \n14 \n  b.  Hutt has been detained during the pendency of the proceedings \n15 \n16 \nagainst him.  Hutt has met with his attorney on only three occasions.  None of these \n17 \n18 \nmeetings lasted longer than 15 minutes.   \n19 \n20 \n  c.  Hutt's attorney has not adequately discussed the facts relating to the \n21 \n22 \ncharges against Hutt, substantive legal issues, or important litigation strategy.  Hutt's \n23 \n24 \nattorney's caseload is excessive. \n25 \n26 \n  d.  Hutt's attorney has not adequately reviewed the discovery with him. \n27 \n28 \n  e.  Hutt's attorney has not interviewed important witnesses in the case.  \n29 \n30 \n31  G.  The Plaintiffs Face a Continuing Risk that their Constitutional Rights \n32  Will Be Violated \n33 \n34  101.  As a result of defendant Grant County's acts and omissions, including the \n35 \n36  policies, practices and procedures maintained and countenanced by defendant Grant County \n37 \n38  and the Board, indigent persons charged with felony crimes in Grant County have suffered \n39 \n40  or are at imminent and serious risk of suffering harm.  Among other things, indigent persons \n41 \n42  are deprived of adequate consultation and communication with their attorneys.  Indigent \n43 \n44  persons must make decisions about their rights or contest issues without adequate factual or \n45 \n46  legal investigation by their attorneys.  Indigent persons are deprived of meaningful \n47 \n \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nCOMPLAINT - 22  Seattle, Washington  98101-3099 \nPhone:  (206) 359-8000 \n[/2004-04-05 --Complaint (3).DOC] \n  Fax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\n   \n \n \nopportunities to present defenses.  The rights of indigent persons are waived without proper \n1 \n2 \nconsultation and advice.  Indigent persons are deprived of the services of investigators and \n3 \n4 \nexpert witnesses.  Indigent persons' cases are not properly prepared for trial.  Indigent \n5 \n6 \npersons do not receive meaningful benefits in exchange for guilty pleas. \n7 \n8 \n102.  There is a substantial risk that defendant Grant County's violations will \n9 \n10 \ncontinue and will deprive the Class Plaintiffs and other Class Members of their rights.  \n11 \n12 \nAmong other things: \n13 \n14 \n  a.  Defendant Grant County has persisted in its wrongful course of \n15 \n16 \nconduct for many years. \n17 \n18 \n  b.  Defendant Grant County has persisted in its wrongful course of \n19 \n20 \nconduct despite the fact that it knew or should have known that indigent persons were being \n21 \n22 \ndeprived of their rights. \n23 \n24 \n  c.  Defendant Grant County has failed to take prompt action to fix the \n25 \n26 \npublic defense system.   \n27 \n28 \n  d.  Defendant Grant County has allowed the Grant County public defense \n29 \n30 \nsystem to descend into chaos. \n31 \n32 \n  e.  Defendant Grant County has refused to discuss the foregoing \n33 \n34 \nviolations with counsel for the Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs' counsel have written twice to the Board \n35 \n36 \nseeking such a meeting.  See Exhibits K and L.  The Board refused to meet with Plaintiffs' \n37 \n38 \ncounsel.

      "title": "Monitor's Report, Fourth Quarter 2007",
      "text": "Best, et al. v. Grant County \n \nMonitor’s Report \n \nFourth Quarter, 2007 \n \nJanuary 17, 2008 \n \nSubmitted by Francisco Rodriguez, Settlement Monitor \n \n \nMonitor’s Activities \n \nDuring the fourth quarter, I traveled to Ephrata on two occasions, October 9, 2007, and \nNovember 13, 2007.  My goal is to be on site in Grant County at least once per month.  \nUnfortunately, I was not able to visit during the month of December due to scheduling \nconflicts.  While in Ephrata, I observed court proceedings, reviewed court files, and met \nwith various participants in the Grant County criminal justice system. \n \nIn addition to site visits, I maintain regular contact with supervisor Alan White via email \nand telephone.  I also have periodic contact with individual defenders, investigators, and \ncounsel for both parties.  \n \n \nAccess to Information \n \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Monitor shall have broad access to \ninformation concerning the Grant County public defense system.  Pursuant to this \nauthority, I routinely request information from Supervising Attorney Alan White, and \nboth he and his assistant Aracely Yanez have been very cooperative in responding to my \nrequests.  I also occasionally request information from June Strickler, Administrative \nAssistant to the Board of County Commissioners.  She too has been responsive to my \nrequests.  Finally, the Grant County Superior Court Clerk’s Office has always been very \naccommodating in my review of court files. \n \nAlthough the County has generally been forthcoming in responding to my requests for \ninformation, I continue to encounter occasional resistance.  During the fourth quarter, for \nexample, the County refused to provide me with a letter written by Supervising Attorney \nAlan White relating to private practice by the Grant County public defenders.  I learned \nof the letter when its existence was inadvertently disclosed in one of Mr. White’s \nmonthly reports.  I subsequently requested a copy of the letter from both Mr. White and \ncounsel for the County.  Two months later, I still have not received a copy of the letter or \na formal response to my request.1 \n \n                                                 \n1 On January 14, 2008, counsel for the County, Francis Floyd, indicated in a telephone conversation that he \nmay provide a copy of Mr. White’s letter to the Monitor and to plaintiffs’ counsel shortly. \n2007 Quarterly Report - 1 of 11 \n\nThe County’s refusal to provide information relating to private practice by its defenders \nis troubling.  The County has offered no explanation for withholding relevant documents \non this issue, and I see no legitimate basis for doing so.  The Settlement Agreement sets \nspecific limits on private practice by Grant County public defenders and requires reduced \ncaseloads for defenders who accept private cases.  Furthermore, private practice is \ncompletely prohibited unless approved in advance by both the Supervising Attorney and \nthe Monitor.   Under the circumstances, it appears that the County is attempting to \ncircumvent these limitations on private practice by concealing evidence from both the \nMonitor and plaintiffs’ counsel. \n \n \n2006 Compliance \n \nThe question of compliance in 2006 has been resolved.  In July 2007, I submitted my \n2006 Compliance Report to the parties.  In that report, I found that the County breached \nthe Settlement Agreement in 2006 in various ways, most significantly by failing to \nprovide counsel in a timely fashion to a large number of indigent defendants, many of \nwhom were in custody.   I also made recommendations to the parties regarding the \ncorrective action necessary to “cure” the breach.  \n \nIn November 2007, a dispute arose between the parties as to whether the County had \nadopted several of the “cure” recommendations contained in my 2006 Compliance \nReport.  In resolving the dispute, I found that the County had failed to follow my \nrecommendations and thus had not cured the breach as required by the Settlement \nAgreement. \n \nI am hopeful that all concerned can now finally close the book on 2006.  At the County’s \nrequest and with the acquiescence of plaintiffs’ counsel, I have not filed my reports \nregarding 2006 with the court.  Both the 2006 Compliance Report and 2006 Cure \nCompliance Report are, however, available to the court upon request. \n \n \nSupervising Attorney \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Monitor to oversee and evaluate the performance \nof the Supervising Attorney.  In Grant County, the Supervising Attorney fills a multitude \nof roles.  He is expected to be a combination of administrator, compliance officer, \nmentor, and public defense advocate.  Moreover, he answers to several different \nconstituencies, each with its own set of priorities.  Balancing these competing roles and \nconstituencies is a herculean task, one that Alan White is still struggling to master.  \nDespite some reservations, overall, I continue to believe that Mr. White does a \ncommendable job in a very challenging environment.   \n \nMr. White is very well-liked on a personal level by the public defenders he supervises.2  \nWhen asked about his performance as supervisor, the defenders are generally positive \n                                                 \n2 Although he has a few vocal critics, they are very much the exception rather than the rule. \n2007 Quarterly Report - 2 of 11 \n\nand supportive.  Their main concerns seem to be structural rather than personal and relate \nto the supervisor’s lack of independence and the resulting inability to zealously advocate \nfor the public defense system and its clients.  I frequently hear complaints from defenders \nregarding the ambiguity of Mr. White’s role and the tension between being a county \nadministrator and being a public defense advocate.  Mr. White shares these frustrations \nand seems to struggle with his competing obligations on a regular basis.  In a recent \nexchange with me, he described his predicament this way:  “My role is, as everyone \nknows, limited, expanded, convoluted, and splintered.”   \n \nWhile Mr. White cannot change the conflicts inherent in his position, he seems to be \nmaking some progress in trying to reconcile his competing responsibilities.   In the past, \nMr. White has attempted, without success, to chart a course that pleases everyone.  Much \nto his dismay, the result has often been that he pleased no one.  I believe that Mr. White is \nstarting to realize the futility of trying to be all things to all people.  He and I have had a \nnumber of discussions about his role, and he has expressed a desire to engage \nrepresentatives of the County in a similar dialogue.  With a new defender group now in \nplace, I hope he will raise this topic with them as well.  If nothing else, these discussions \nmay help others to better appreciate Mr. White’s predicament. \n \nAside from confusion about his role, Mr. White has had difficulties over the past year \nwith rebellious defenders refusing to recognize his authority or follow his directions.  Mr. \nWhite’s management style is cooperative rather than autocratic and was not well-suited to \nthe personnel in place in 2007.  The situation was aggravated by the County’s failure to \ngive Mr. White sufficient authority and independence to manage the program effectively. \nOver time, I hope that the County will increase Mr. White’s authority and demonstrate \ngreater deference to him in public defense matters.  In any event, the 2008 staff seems \nmuch more receptive to Mr. White’s leadership style, and I do not expect the discipline \nproblems experienced in 2007 to reoccur. \n \nAs I have noted in prior reports, supervising a public defense program is no easy task \nunder any circumstance.  In Grant County, Mr. White’s task is made all the more difficult \nby the fact that in addition to his regular workload, the County requires him to supervise \ndistrict court and to handle some administrative responsibilities for juvenile court.  \nDistrict Court defenders alone handled over 4000 case equivalents in 2007.  Using \nWSBA-endorsed standards for public defense, Mr. White supervises the equivalent of \napproximately 13.5 attorney caseloads in District Court.  While I understand that the \nCounty benefits from economies of scale in structuring its public defense program in this \nway, Mr. White already has more than a full-time workload supervising the adult felony \ndefenders.  The administrative convenience to the County of having Mr. White supervise \nother courts comes at the expense of the adult felony program.  Moreover, assigning Mr. \nWhite these responsibilities appears to violate the Settlement Agreement’s requirement \nthat the County hire a “full-time” supervising attorney for the adult felony public defense \nsystem.  Accordingly, I continue to recommend that the County either hire an assistant \nsupervisor or designate someone other than Mr. White to supervise district and juvenile \ncourt. \n \n2007 Quarterly Report - 3 of 11 \n\nTo its credit, the County has simplified Mr. White’s work somewhat in 2008 by reducing \nthe number of part-time defenders employed.  In 2007, the County utilized as many as six \npart-time defenders.  For 2008, the County has committed to using no more than two.  \nWhile the number of case assignments will not change, it will be easier for Mr. White to \nsupervise fewer attorneys.   \n \nThe fourth quarter was particularly difficult for Mr. White as he had to deal with the \ndeparture of numerous defenders who had contracts expiring at year’s end.  In addition to \nhis normal responsibilities, Mr. White had to re-assign a large number of cases, including \nseveral that were quite serious and complex, train three new full-time defenders, and \nmanage case assignments to ensure that caseload limits were observed.  Moreover, the \nimpending departure of certain defenders resulted in substantial tension and discord with \nand among the defenders, and Mr. White spent a great deal of time addressing these \npersonnel issues.  Although some residual issues remain, the most difficult part of the \nstaffing transition is now complete.   \n \nAlan White has a mostly thankless job.  He is rarely credited for his successes while he is \nblamed for every problem that arises with the public defense system.  His job \nresponsibilities are overwhelming.  In spite of all this, he seems to remain positive and \nkeeps striving to improve as a supervisor.  I have been impressed with his openness to \nadvice and to change, and it is this quality that makes me most optimistic for 2008.   \n \n \nStaffing/Caseloads \n \nDespite significant staffing challenges, Grant County met annual caseload limits and \nended 2007 with excess caseload capacity.  The County faced a number of significant \nobstacles in achieving this goal.  First, three full-time defenders resigned, effectively \nrendering them unavailable for case assignments during the last six weeks of the year.  \nSecond, the County lost one of its full-time defenders for more than three months due to \nhis poor health.  Third, the caseload limits for each of the full-time defenders had to be \nreduced late in the year when it became apparent that they were engaging in private \npractice.  The County was able to overcome these problems by convincing its new full-\ntime defenders for 2008 to start early.  By doing so, the County added approximately 86 \ncase equivalents worth of capacity starting in September.  The County should be \ncongratulated for responding quickly and decisively to avoid a staffing crisis at the end of \nthe year. \n \nSignificantly, the County was also able to comply with the monthly and quarterly limits it \nimposed in July.  This was no small feat given the rather tumultuous staffing situation \nduring the last quarter.  Moreover, Alan White was successful in spreading the case \nassignments among the defenders much more evenly in 2007 than in 2006. \n \nIn assessing 2007 caseload data, however, it is important to note several factors that \naffected the County’s ability to meet the required caseload limits.  First, in order meet \ncaseload demands, the County employed as many as six part-time defenders in 2007.  \n2007 Quarterly Report - 4 of 11 \n\nThe Settlement Agreement limits the County to no more than two.  Second, the 2007 case \nassignment totals are artificially low due to the failure of several defenders to report their \nwork on extraordinary cases.  One defender has not reported his time since June.  Third, \nthe County benefited from three consecutive months of unusually low case assignments \nfrom September through November. \n \nAs mentioned above, Grant County has undergone significant personnel turnover during \nthe last three months.  Seven of its defenders, three full-time and four part-time, are not \nreturning in 2008.   While the transition has been difficult, I am hopeful that the infusion \nof new personnel will bring improved collegiality and coordination among the defenders.  \nI have already met with the three new full-time defenders, and my initial impression is \nvery positive.  Moreover, while it is much too early to reach any firm conclusions, the \ngroup dynamic already seems noticeably improved.  \n   \n \nTraining \n \nBecause many of the defenders commute from other jurisdictions, scheduling training \nsessions is sometimes difficult.  Typically, the Supervising Attorney will arrange a lunch-\ntime training on a Monday or Tuesday when the defenders are most likely to be in \nEphrata for court.  During the fourth quarter, Mr. White arranged one such training, an \ninformational session on MRSA, an antibiotic resistant staph infection that is a concern in \nsome jail populations.   \n \nOn average, the County seems to provide about an hour of training each quarter.  I would \nlike to see more training offered in 2008.  In the past, Grant County has been very \nsupportive of its defenders attending intensive trial training courses.  The County sent \nseveral defenders to the National Criminal Defense College in 2006, and those defenders \nbenefited greatly from the experience.  Some of the new defenders have expressed \ninterest in receiving such training this summer, and I hope the County will continue to \nsupport its defenders in this area.  I understand that the County has earmarked funds it \nreceived from the State Office of Public Defense for this purpose.    \n \n \nFirst Appearances \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that the County provide representation at initial \nappearances for all indigent defendants.  In addition, Supervising Attorney Alan White \nhas adopted a written policy requiring the public defenders to visit in-custody defendants \nprior to their first appearance in court.  Each of the defenders is assigned to cover first \nappearances for a week at a time on a rotating basis throughout the year.  The coverage \nattorney is required to visit in-custody defendants prior to court in order to obtain the \ninformation necessary to make a bail reduction and/or release motion.   \n   \nThe defenders on staff for 2008 appear to make these required jail visits on a fairly \nregular basis.  During the fourth quarter, this was true for both the new hires and the \n2007 Quarterly Report - 5 of 11 \n\nreturning defenders.  The defenders without contracts for 2008, however, frequently \nfailed to visit in-custody defendants prior to their first appearances.  Their “lame duck” \nstatus seems to have led some defenders to become quite lax about their professional \nresponsibilities.  In cross-referencing first appearance dockets with jail visit logs, I found \nat least a dozen days during the fourth quarter on which these defenders were assigned to \ncover first appearances but there was no record of any jail visits.   \n \nIn analyzing first appearance data, I noticed that even the most diligent defenders \noccasionally failed to make the required first appearance visits.  Upon further \ninvestigation, I learned that scheduling issues often make it difficult to visit defendants as \nrequired.  First appearance hearings are held at 1:30 PM.  The assigned defender \ngenerally receives a copy of the first appearance docket the morning of the hearing.  The \nheaviest calendars tend to occur on Mondays and Tuesdays, the same days that defenders \nare in court all day on their assigned cases.   Because they are busy handling their own \ncases on these mornings, the defenders may not be available to make first appearance \nvisits until the lunch recess.  The jail does not allow visits from 11:30 to 12:30, however, \nso the coverage attorney is left with perhaps an hour from 12:30 to 1:30 to visit clients.  \nWith large calendars, there simply isn’t enough time to visit all the defendants on the \ndocket during the lunch hour.  As a result, defenders are sometimes left with little choice \nbut to meet with the client in court.  At least one attorney has elected to visit first \nappearance clients in jail the night before the hearing.  While this practice certainly \nbenefits the defendants, I am not sure it is reasonable to expect defenders with a full-time \nfelony caseload to spend an extra hour or two at the jail several nights a week. \n \nWith respect to out-of-custody defendants, I recently learned that the County does not \ngenerally provide representation at first appearances.  The coverage attorney does not \nreceive any notice of these hearings and is not required to provide representation.  \nDefenders may volunteer to stand in on behalf of such defendants, but there is no formal \nsystem to ensure that they have representation.  When a defendant fails to appear in \nresponse to a summons, there is no attorney to evaluate whether the summons was \nproperly served, to attempt to contact the defendant and determine the reason for his/her \nabsence, or to argue against probable cause.  \n \n \nJail Visits  \n \nIndigent defendants in Grant County are assigned counsel on a provisional basis at first \nappearance.  If the client is in-custody, the assigned attorney is expected to visit him or \nher prior to arraignment which usually occurs the following week. \n \nAs with first appearance visits, the defenders on staff for 2008 appear to visit their clients \nwithin a reasonable period of time after the assignment.  Again, however, the departing \ndefenders were much less likely to visit clients promptly as required.3  Even defenders \nwho had previously been quite diligent in visiting clients seemed to wait an extra week or \n                                                 \n3 One caller to the complaint line, expressing his frustration at his attorney’s failure to visit him, explained \nthat he wanted to speak with his attorney “not in the hallway.” \n2007 Quarterly Report - 6 of 11 \n\nso before getting around to a visit.  In one case, I found that a defendant charged with a \nclass A sex offense waited 28 days for a visit from his assigned attorney.  In the future, \nGrant County will need to be more vigilant in monitoring the work of defenders leaving \nits employ. \n \nDelays in jail visits also continue to be a problem with the part-time defenders as a group.  \nBecause these defenders have obligations in other jurisdictions and may not be present in \nGrant County each week, they often fail to visit clients in a timely fashion.  This may be \nless of a problem in 2008 as at least one of the new part-time defenders resides in Grant \nCounty. \n \n \nInvestigation \n \nGrant County currently has four approved investigators.  It is my understanding that the \ndefenders are generally quite pleased with their work.  There were some concerns about \nthe availability of one of the investigators for a period of time during the fourth quarter, \nbut I am told that problem has now been resolved.   \n \nMost of the public defenders continue to make regular use of investigators on their cases.  \nAs in previous quarters, investigation rates varied substantially among the defenders.  \nOverall, the defenders requested investigation in approximately 32% percent of their \ncases in the fourth quarter.   This figure is down somewhat from last quarter.  For the \nyear, Grant County defenders requested investigation in approximately 35% of their \ncases.  Four of the full-time defenders and one of the part-time defenders investigated at \nleast 40% of their cases in 2007. \n \nOn an individual level, I am concerned that some defenders did not investigate enough of \ntheir cases in 2007.  Two full-time defenders requested investigation in less than 20% of \ntheir cases for the year.  Their investigation rates in the fourth quarter were only slightly \nabove this yearly average.  In addition, three of the County’s part-time defenders had \ninvestigation rates below 20% for the fourth quarter.  Two had annual rates below 20%.   \n \nAlthough the County’s new full-time defenders have only been on staff for a short time, \nthe data so far indicates that they are requesting investigation at an acceptable rate.  In the \nfirst quarter of 2008, the County should pay particular attention to investigation rates by \nboth the new full-time and part-time defenders to ensure that they are using investigation \nresources appropriately.   \n \n \nClient Complaints \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Supervising Attorney to establish a system to \ntrack and investigate complaints from indigent defendants regarding their assigned \nattorneys.   To satisfy this requirement, Alan White has a dedicated telephone line for \nclient complaints.  Notices regarding the complaint line are posted throughout the jail in \n2007 Quarterly Report - 7 of 11 \n\nboth Spanish and English.  These notices were updated during the fourth quarter to reflect \nthe best times to call in.  Calls to the complaint line are logged, and if any follow-up is \nnecessary, a message is conveyed to the handling attorney. \n \nThe complaint system seems to work relatively well when someone is in the office to \nanswer the calls.  Mr. White’s part-time assistant is available to accept calls in the \nmornings on most days.  In the afternoons and after regular business hours, calls to the \ncomplaint line go to voicemail.  During the fourth quarter, some mornings calls were not \nanswered when Mr. White’s assistant had a day off, attended a training seminar, or was \nout of the office on work-related tasks.  \n \nMissed calls are not a problem so long as the inmate can leave a message.  Unfortunately, \nin-custody defendants in Grant County do not currently have that option.  The jail phone \nsystem requires the person receiving the call to accept it by pushing a specified button.  \nAs a result, calls to voicemail are not put through, and the inmate cannot leave a message.  \nThis is a significant problem.  In the fourth quarter, Mr. White’s office received 140 calls \nfrom the jail in which inmates were unable to leave a message.4  Approximately three out \nof every four callers were unable to register their complaints.  Mr. White has no way to \nidentify such callers or determine the reason for their calls.  I noted this problem in my \nlast quarterly report, but to the best of my knowledge, the County has taken no action to \ncorrect the problem.  The Settlement Agreement specifically requires the County to \nprovide a “message system” for the complaint line.  Accordingly, I strongly recommend \nthat the County take immediate action to address this problem. \n \nIn my last report, I noted that the County’s complaint system did not provide out-of-\ncustody inmates with notice of how to make a complaint.  This oversight has now been \ncorrected.  During the fourth quarter, Supervising Attorney Alan White developed an \ninformational flyer that includes instructions on how to make a complaint.  This flyer is \nnow distributed to defendants at arraignment.  Based upon the depleted supply of flyers, \nit appears that the public defenders are distributing this information to defendants as \nrequired. \n \nAs far as substance, the complaint logs for the fourth quarter reveal that once again more \nthan half of client calls relate to a need for contact with the assigned attorney.  The jail \nphone system continues to be a problem in this regard.  In an attempt to address the cost \nof collect calls, the County has required most of the defenders to set up toll free lines.  As \nI have repeatedly informed the County, however, a toll free line, standing alone, will not \nsolve this problem.  Two additional steps are necessary.  First, the toll free numbers must \nbe assigned a two-digit code so that inmates can access them from the jail.  Second, the \nphone system must be configured so that calls to those numbers bypass the recorded \nscreening process that prevents the inmate from leaving a message.   \n \nI understand that in the last several days, the County has finally assigned several of its \ndefenders the “speed dial” codes necessary to access toll free numbers.  Although I am \n                                                 \n4 The calls can be identified as jail calls because the voicemail system captures a portion of the jail’s \nrecorded message. \n2007 Quarterly Report - 8 of 11 \n\npleased that the County has finally made progress in this area, I am disappointed that it \nhas taken so long for the County to respond.  Moreover, these codes will be of limited \nutility unless the County also ensures that the jail phone system has been configured to \nallow inmates to leave messages.5 \n \n \nOverall Quality of Representation \n   \nThe quality of representation in Grant County remains uneven.  While some defenders \nare quite diligent in visiting clients, investigating cases, and filing motions, others are not.  \nThe quality of representation definitely suffered in the fourth quarter as some of the \ndeparting defenders seemed to prematurely disengage from their professional obligations \nto their remaining Grant County clients.  At the same time, I was impressed with what I \nobserved of the representation provided by the new defenders that the County brought in \nlate in the year. \n \nOn my most recent visit to Grant County, I was particularly impressed with the \ndevelopment of one of the returning defenders.  I observed this defender aggressively \narguing discovery motions as well as successfully navigating a difficult sentencing \nhearing.  In reviewing court files, I found that this defender had filed a potentially \nwinning Knapstad motion in one case, made efforts to obtain a sentencing alternative in \nanother, and was routinely submitting detailed discovery demands.  The same defender \nhad retained an expert on yet another case and participated in a contested CrR 3.5 hearing \nlater that same week. \n \nAlthough I see signs of progress, each quarter there seems to be at least one case that \ngives me pause with respect to the overall quality of Grant County public defense.  \nDuring the fourth quarter, I learned that two defenders had been handling a third strike \ncase for over a year without ever investigating the defendant’s prior strikes.  When a \nsubstitution of counsel occurred, the new attorney quickly recognized this oversight and \nupon pulling the court files, discovered that one of the alleged strikes was legally \ndefective and not likely to count as a strike at all.  Obtaining all records relating to prior \nstrike convictions is one of the first steps a defense attorney should take in a third strike \ncase.  Ironically, the defenders involved are among the most diligent the County has.  \nTheir error in this case was simply a matter of inexperience in handling complex cases.  \nIn order to avoid such mistakes in the future, I have urged Alan White to either assign his \nmore experienced defenders to such cases or become more closely involved in the \nrepresentation in order to ensure that less experienced defenders avoid critical mistakes. \n \nThere were two jury trials during the fourth quarter.  In both cases, the defendants were \nrepresented by part-time defenders who are not returning in 2008.  The trial rate for the \nfourth quarter was approximately 1%.  The trial rate for the year was also approximately \n1%.  The number of trials in Grant County is surprisingly low, and I have yet to find a \n                                                 \n5 The Settlement Agreement expressly requires that each of the County’s public defenders “maintain a \nbilingual (English-Spanish) telephone and message system or other comparable system that allows \nincarcerated clients and other clients to leave messages.”   \n2007 Quarterly Report - 9 of 11 \n\nsatisfying explanation for this lack of trials.  Moreover, the situation may very well \nworsen in the coming year given that the defenders responsible for 9 of the 10 trials held \nin 2007 are not returning in 2008.  The 2007 trial rate for the returning full-time \ndefenders was an abysmally low 0.2%.   \n \n \nExperts \n \nIn my review of court files, I was pleased to discover several instances in which Grant \nCounty public defenders had obtained funding for defense experts.  The use of experts is \noften critical to an effective defense.  The fact that at least some defenders have made the \neffort to consult with experts is a very positive sign in terms of the quality of \nrepresentation being provided. \n \nI feel compelled to point out, however, that I should not have been able to learn about \ndefense experts by reviewing a court file.  Requests for funding should be made ex parte, \nand all pleadings relating to defense experts should generally be filed under seal.  Based \nupon my review, most expert requests by Grant County defenders are made ex parte, \nthough I did find one that was not labeled as such.  It appears, however, that some \ndefenders are not obtaining an order to seal the pleadings relating to their expert requests.  \nAs a result, all of the details regarding their ex parte expert requests are publicly \naccessible in the court file.  In addition, I found at least one file in which materials \nrelating to the request for expert funding were filed under seal, but subsequent pleadings \nrelating to the expert’s billing were not.  I have discussed these problems with the \nSupervising Attorney, and he has assured me that he will review the importance of \nobtaining orders to seal with the defenders. \n \n \nConflicts of Interest \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires both the Supervising Attorney and each defender to \nhave a conflicts-check system.  These procedures must be approved by the Monitor.  To \ndate, I have not been asked to approve any policy or procedure for conflicts checks.   \n \nUntil recently, the Supervising Attorney had not been using a formal or systematic \nprocedure for checking conflicts.  Mr. White has always been careful not to assign \nmultiple co-defendants to the same defender or firm.  In addition, it was his practice to \nresearch potential conflicts whenever he recognized the name of a witness or alleged \nvictim. \n \nDuring the fourth quarter, Mr. White adopted a much more systematic approach to \nconflicts.  For each case, Mr. White personally reviews the police report and compiles a \nlist of witnesses and alleged victims.  He provides this list to his assistant who also \nreviews the police reports and double checks the list. She then runs the names against \ntheir case assignment database which dates back to 2005 and notes any potential \n2007 Quarterly Report - 10 of 11 \n\nconflicts.  The list of witnesses and alleged victims is then passed on to the assigned \nattorney who is expected to run his or her own conflicts check. \n \nThe Settlement Agreement also requires the County to maintain a list of attorneys \navailable to handle conflicts cases.  These attorneys must meet WSBA-Endorsed \nStandards and must be approved by the Monitor.  As reported last quarter, the only \nattorneys submitted for approval as conflicts counsel did not meet WSBA-Endorsed \nStandards.  The County has not submitted any additional names for approval and \ncurrently has no one approved to handle conflicts cases. \n \n \nAdministrative Support \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires each defender to maintain a minimum of ¼-time \nsecretary or paralegal.  The Monitor may waive this requirement if a given defender does \nnot need such support.  It is my understanding that very few defenders employ any \nsupport staff.  There are at least three reasons for this.  First, it is difficult to hire a \nqualified secretary or paralegal to work just 10 hours a week.  Second, the individual \ndefenders are expected to pay the salary for any support staff they employ, thus reducing \ntheir own compensation.  Third, some of the defenders have no office and/or commute \nfrom other jurisdictions, making the use of support staff impractical.  The use of \nsecretarial or paralegal support is much easier when staff can be shared by multiple \ndefenders.  In Grant County, however, the potential for conflicts makes sharing staff very \ndifficult. \n \nAlan White is in the process of assessing the administrative support for each of the \ncurrent defenders.  I have not yet received his report on this topic.  I anticipate addressing \nthis issue in the first quarter to determine whether the requirement for administrative \nsupport is being met and whether any waivers of the requirement are appropriate. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI believe that Grant County has the potential to make great strides in 2008 toward \nimproving the quality of its public defense system.  The staffing changes engineered by \nthe County promise to bring more cohesion and cooperation to a defender group that had \nbecome increasingly fractured and dysfunctional.  The changes in personnel will also \noffer the Supervising Attorney the opportunity for a fresh start with a staff more receptive \nto his leadership.  For its part, I hope that in the coming months the County will address \nsome of the nagging issues that have tended to overshadow its progress overall.  In \nparticular, the County needs to confront the problem of private practice by its defenders, \nensure that the jail phone system is configured to allow inmates to call their attorneys and \nleave messages, and obtain all of the approvals required by the Settlement Agreement.   \n \n \n \n2007 Quarterly Report - 11 of 11 ",

      "text": "ACLU of Washington | Content Detail http://www.aclu-wa.org/inthecourts/detail.cfm?id=47\nLawsuit Challenging Grant County’s\nInadequate Public Defense System\nGranted Class-Action Status\nDecember 21, 2004\nKittitas Superior Court Judge Michael Cooper today granted\nclass-action status to a lawsuit seeking to reform Grant\nCounty’s woefully inadequate public defense system. The\nlawsuit seeks a court order mandating that the County operate\na constitutionally adequate system of public defense. The\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union and Columbia Legal Services filed\nthe suit in April on behalf of three individuals who were\nprovided public defenders and allege they received ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The lawsuit also includes a Grant County\ntaxpayer plaintiff.\n“We are very pleased that the court has granted class\ncertification for the lawsuit. Today’s ruling means that any\nfuture remedies ordered by the court will affect all indigent\npersons with felony cases in Grant County Superior Court who\nare represented by an appointed lawyer,” said Julya Hampton,\nACLU Legal Program Director.\nThe lawsuit charges that Grant County has violated the federal\nand state Constitution by operating a public defense system\nthat regularly and systematically deprives indigent persons of\nthe effective assistance of counsel. In the last two years, the\nWashington State Bar Association has recommended that two\nGrant County public defenders be disbarred because of\nmisconduct in representing indigent defendants. At least four\ncourts in recent years have overturned felony convictions\nbecause Grant County public defenders failed to provide\neffective assistance of counsel.\nSystemic inadequacies in the County’s public defense system\ninclude the following:\nAttorneys have failed to communicate with clients. Some\ndefendants have met with their attorneys only briefly\nprior to trial.\nAttorneys have had excessive caseloads, significantly in\nexcess of the standards of the Washington State Bar\nAssociation.\nAttorneys have overlooked important evidence that may\nhave proven clients were innocent. \nAttorneys have failed to interview witnesses.\nAttorneys have waived important rights for their clients\nand have not properly advised clients of their rights.\nAttorneys have failed to file critical legal motions.\nIn March the ACLU issued a report detailing flaws in indigent\ndefense systems around the state.

Cooper has\nruled that indigent defendants in Grant County have a\nwell-grounded fear of not receiving effective legal counsel from\nGrant County's public defense system. Among other things, the\njudge found that Grant County’s system overworked its\nlawyers, failed to provide effective supervision, and allowed the\nGrant County Prosecutor's Office to interfere with funding for\nexpert witnesses and investigators.\nThe ruling came in a lawsuit challenging the Grant County\npublic defense system filed by the American Civil Liberties\nUnion and Columbia Legal Services. The case is set to go to trial\non Nov. 8, with the trial focused on devising a public defense\nsystem that meets the County's constitutional obligation to\nprovide effective assistance of counsel.\n“We are pleased with the decision. It resolved many of the\ncritical issues in favor of the plaintiffs and shows there’s a clear\nneed for an injunction to protect the rights of people who\ncannot afford an attorney,” said David Taylor, an ACLU\ncooperating attorney in the case.\n“With this ruling, the Court has properly focused the trial on\nexactly the right issue: how to eliminate the serious deficiencies\nin Grant County’s public defense system so that in the future,\npeople accused of felonies who can’t afford an attorney will\nhave a committed, qualified, and effective lawyer at their side,”\nsaid Don Scaramastra, an attorney with Garvey Schubert Barer.\n“The right of a person accused of a crime to be assisted by a\ncompetent attorney is fundamental to a criminal justice system\nthat is fair to all. Unfortunately, deficient public defense\nsystems exist in many counties in the state. The ACLU will be\nlooking for other counties to address problems with their own\nindigent defense systems,” said Julya Hampton, Legal Program\nDirector for the ACLU.\nIn 2005 the Washington Legislature enacted legislation to\nprovide limited state funding for public defense. The ACLU will\ncontinue to work in the 2006 session to gain full funding of\npublic defense statewide and enforcement of the practice\nstandards. Currently it is up to counties to fund public\ndefenders for felony defendants who can’t afford their own\nattorney.\nThe ACLU and Columbia Legal Services filed suit in April 2004\non behalf of Jeffrey Best, Daniel Campos and Gary Dale Hutt.\nThe three were charged with felony offenses and alleged that\nGrant County didn’t provide them with effective assistance of\ncounsel. The lawsuit also includes a taxpayer plaintiff, Greg\nHansen, who wants the county to provide constitutionally\nadequate defense to indigent persons and to use public funds\nwisely. The court granted the plaintiffs class-action status in\nAugust 2004.\nIn his ruling, Judge Cooper pointed out that “[A] right to\neffective assistance of counsel is inherent in the guarantee of\ncounsel and is essential to a fair trial.” Judge Cooper said it was\n“virtually uncontested” that the Grant County public defense\nsystem in place before April 2004 “suffered from systemic\ndeficiencies, ” such as public defenders with excessive case\nloads or little meaningful supervision. The system also allowed\ncounty prosecutors to interfere with the selection of defense\n1 of 2 6/18/2007 3:28 PM\n\nACLU of Washington | Content Detail http://www.aclu-wa.org/inthecourts/detail.cfm?id=295\nyp\nattorneys and with the funds for defense experts and\ninvestigators.\nThese deficiencies “created an atmosphere in which the class\nplaintiffs developed a well-grounded fear of immediate invasion\nof their respective right to effective assistance of counsel and is\nevidence of an ongoing concern,” Judge Cooper wrote.\nJudge Cooper noted that although some improvements have\nbeen made with the 2005 public defense contract, problems in\nthe current system continue. The trial will focus on devising a\npublic defense system that meets constitutional standards. The\nCourt will rely on the Washington Defender Association\nStandards for Public Defense Services and the principles\nestablished by the American Bar Association.\nIn addition to the deficiencies listed by Judge Cooper, the\nlawsuit also argued that Grant County’s public defenders:\n• Failed to communicate with clients \n• Did not interview potential witnesses \n• Failed to use investigators or experts \n• Failed to properly advise clients before entering guilty pleas \n• Did not file critical legal motions\nEvidence presented to the Court included testimony from the\nCounty's own expert in public defense systems that prior to the\nfiling of the lawsuit, Grant County's public defense system was\n\"terrible\" and that \"intolerable caseloads\" prevented public\ndefenders from providing effective assistance of counsel.\nThe lawsuit is being handled by attorneys at the Perkins Coie\nand Garvey Schubert Barer law firms. The litigation team\nincludes ACLU cooperating attorneys David Taylor, Breena Roos\nand Beth Colgan from Perkins Coie and ACLU staff attorney\nNancy Talner. Garvey Schubert Barer attorneys include Don\nScaramastra, Justin Dolan and Charles Cottrell and Lori\nSalzarulo. Columbia Legal Services attorneys are Pat Arthur,\nJoachim Morrison and Chris Kerkering.\nThe ACLU is reviewing practices in other counties to ensure that\ntheir indigent defense systems are constitutionally adequate.\nThe 2004 ACLU report, “The Unfulfilled Promise of Gideon”\nshows that a majority of Washington counties lack\ncomprehensive standards for the delivery of public defense\nservices. Many counties do not have adequate oversight\nsystems in place to sufficiently ensure these publicly funded\nlegal services meet basic fiscal and constitutional standards of\naccountability. “The Unfulfilled Promise of Gideon” is available\nonline here.\n2 of 2 6/18/2007 3:28 PM",

The three named defendants Best, Campos and Hutt, were all charged with felonies in \nGrant County SuperiQr Court and assigned attorneys to represent them.  Each named defendant \ncontends Grant County, through its Board of County Commissioners, has violated the \nconstitutional fights of indigent persons accused offelonies in Grant County arising from the \nSixth and Fourteenth Amendments oithe United States Constitution and Artiele I, Sections 3, 12 \nand 22 of the Washington State Constitution. \nThe proposed representative plaintiffs (Best, Campos and Hutt) seek judicial enforcement \nof their right to effective assistance of counsel, due prncess and equal protection of the laws. \nThey, together with Grant County taxpayer Gregg Hansen, seek injunctive and declaratory relief \nMEMORANDUM DECISION\" 1 \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington;  509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  12:56PM;  Page  2 \nin order to protect the constitutional rights of all present and future indigent criminal defendants. \nBy their request for class certification under CR 23(b)(2) the representative plaintiffs seek to \nrepresent a class consisting of all indigent persons who have or will have criminal felony cases \npending in Grant County Superior Court, who are appointed an attorney, and who have not \nentered into a plea agreement or been convicted. \nThe defendant opposes the representative plaintiffs' motion for class certification, \ncontending class certification is not appropriate because the plaintiffs cannot establish a \njusticable controversy, the plaintiffs cannot establish actual harm and/or the imminent threat of \nfuture harm, because the plaintiffs cannot establish the necessary requirements under CR 23 and \nbecause the plaintiffs fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \nPlaintiffs have also moved the court to compel Grant County to produce documents \nresponsive to plaintiffs' first request for production, to produce a witness in response to the \nplaintiffs' CR 30(b)(6) deposition who will be prepared to testify knowledgeably and completely \nregarding the matter set forth in the deposition notice, to answer questions concerning the \nqualifications of new public defenders contracted with the county and to provide the identity and \nresponsibility of all persons who have participated on behalf of Grant County in the decision to \nseek reassignment of cases from one attorney to another since February 15, 2004. \nOral argument on the motions· was heard by the court on Wednesday, August 4, 2004. \nThe court thereafter took the matter under advisement to review the extensive briefings by the \nparties and to consult the numerous cases cited by each side.~ The court has now had the \nopportunity to review the positions of the parties. \nDISCUSSION \n1.  Background.  The plaintiffs' complaint contains numerous allegations pertinent to \ntheir motion for class certification.  Paragraphs 27 through 31 outline Grant County's duty to \nI The defendant also moved to strike plaintiffs' references to unpublished decisions in their reply in support of \nplaintiffs' motion for class certification and unauthenticated hearsay documents attached to the declarations of \nNancy Talntir and Don Scaramastra.  While the parties did not argue the motion to strike olally, the court indicated it \nwould consider the motion to strike and the opposition thereto in illl decision-making process. \nl The court also indicated to the partie. th.t it was about to embark on a IO-day vacation which the COllrt did take \nfrom August 5 to August 15.  The court returned back on August 16 to preside over a 5Y , day trial, Northwest \nPipeline v. the State ofW.shington and 29 counlies in which Northwest Pipeline protested its tax evalu.ation~ in the \nState ,,[Washington. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION -2 \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington;  509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  12:56PM;  Page  3 \nprovide effective assistance of counsel for indigent persons charged with felony crimes. \nParagraphs 32 through 41 provide an overview ofOrant County's public defense system_ \nParagraphs 42 through 49 provide reference to judicial findings of ineffective assistance of \ncounsel and the disbarment recommendations for the public defenders Tom Earl and Guillermo \nRomero!  Paragraphs 50 through 56 outline the chaos created in the Grant County public \ndefense system by suspension of Tom Earl.  Paragraphs 57 through 94 outline how Grant County \nhas failed to establish a public defense system that provides effective assistance of counsel to all \nindigent persons charged with felony crimes in that it has failed to assure that all public \ndefenders meet professional qualifications, that defendant Grant County has failed to impose \nreasonable case load limits, has failed to monitor or oversee the public defense system, has failed \nto provide adequate funds for public defense, has failed to provide adequate funds to pay \nnecessary costs of defense, has failed to provide representation at all critical stages of \nprosecution, and has undermined the independence of public defenders. \nIn paragraphs 95 through 100 of their complaint the plaintiffs outline how Orant County \nhas failed to provide effective assistance of counsel for the class plaintiffs.  Specifically, on \nJanuary 29,2004 Jeffrey Gregg Best was charged with burglary in the second degree, theft of \nanhydrous ammonia, unlawful storage of anhydrous ammonia, and theft in the second degree \nunder cause number 04-1-00101-6.  On February 10, 2004 Mr. Best was charged with burglary \nin the second degree and theft of anhydrous ammonia under cause number 04-1-00142-3.  Mr. \nBest was assigned an attorney to represent him on the charges.  Best contends and argues he was \ndeprived of his rights of effective assistance of counsel because he wasn't represented at his \ninitial appearance; he only met with his attorney on three occasions, none ofthe meetings of \nwhich lasted more than 10 minutes and one of which was by happenstance; and that Best did not \nhave sufficient opportunity to discuss the facts relating to the charges against him or dismiss \nsubstantive legal issues or important litigation strategy.  Moreover, Best asserts he was unable to \ncontact his attorney even though htl made several attempts to contact the attorney including filing \nkites with the jail and writing letters to his attorney.  His court appointed counsel acknowledged \nreceiving the kites and letters but did not respond in substance to them.  Mr. Best further \ncontends he was not advised of his rights with respect to important pretrial hearings, including \nsuppression hearing under erR 3.5 and erR 3.6, nor was he fully advised of his sentencing range \n'Both of whom have since been in fact disbarred by the Washington State Supreme Court. \nMEMORANDUM DECISION - 3 \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington;  509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  12:57PM;  Page  4 \nif convicted.  He asserts his attorney had an excessive case load because it had doubled since \nTom Earl was suspended and because the attorney was also assigned a juvenile defendant. \ncharged in superior court with first degree murder.  In fact, Best's attorney candidly admitted \nthat he had not been able to do the things that should be done with regard to Best's case. \nDaniel Campos was charged on August 22, 2003 with two counts of stalking and two \ncounts of driving on suspended license under cause number 03-1-00750A.  On February 9, 2004 \nMr. Campos was charged with malicious mischief second degree under cause number 04-1-\n00134-2.  On March 29,2004 the 2004 infonnation was amended to include a second count of \nmalicious mischief.  Mr. Campos was appointed an attorney.  Mr. Campos asserts he has been \ndeprived of his rights to effective assistanct': of counsel because he was not represented by \ncounsel at his initial appearance on the 2003 charge, that during representation of Campos on \n2003 charge Campos' attorney only met with him immediately before court dates and that at \nthese meetings Campos had an inadequate opportunity to discuss defending the charges against \nhim.  Mr. Campos further asserts that after having been represented by the assigned attorney on \nthe 2003 charge for approximately five months he was given a newly aSSigned attorney, that \nwhen he asked for an explanation Campos was told he was provided a new lawyer because of an \nunidentified connict of interest, and that his new attorney assumed responsibility of Campos' \ndefense for both the 2003 and 2004 charges.  Campos alleges that at the pretrial hearing \nregarding the 2003 charge Campos' previous attorney indicated that there were several witnesses \nthat had not been identified or developed by the State and that although his previous attorney had \nindicated these witnesses would be needed to be interviewed no interviews took place.  Campos \nadditionally claims that although he provided his new attorney with contact information for \npotential eXCUlpatory witnesses regarding the 2003 charge his attorney failed to advise Campos \nthat the witnesses had been interviewed, that prior to receiving the names of potentially \nexculpatory witnesses from Campos, his attorney had already filed a list of witnesses for the \n2003 charge and that the list only reserved the right to call Campos and two witnesses reserved \nby the State.  Campos also contends his new attorney had him sign a stipulation to admissibility \nof defendant's statements made regarding the 2003 charge without fully advising Campos \nconcerning the contents of those statements, the circumstances under which the statements were \nmade, or the impact of the stipulation on his defense.  Finally, Campos asserts his attorney did \nMEMORANDUM: DECISION -4 \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington;  509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  12:57PM;  Page  5 \nnot meet with him for a sufficient amount of time to discuss the fuets relating to the charges \nagainst him, substantive legal issues and important litigation strategy. \nGary Dale Hutt was charged with conspiracy to deliver methamphetamine and attempted \nintroduction of contraband in the second degree under cause number 04-1-00022-2 on January \n12,2004.  On Febntary 24,2004 the infonnation was amended to include charges of possession \nof methamphetamine with intent to deliver, possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, \npossession of marijuana with intent to deliver, conspiracy to deliver cocaine, conspiracy to \ndeliver marijuana, and assault in the second degree.  Mr. Hutt was assigned an attorney.  He \nalleges his rights to effective assistance of counsel were violated because he wasn't represented \nby counsel at his initial appearance on the charges set forth above, that while detained during the \npendency of the proceeding against him he had the opportunity to meet with his attorney only \nthree times, none of which meetings lasted longer than 15 minutes, and that his attorney did not \nadequately discuss the facts relating to the charges against him or discuss substantivc legal issues \nor important litigation strategy.  He alleges his attorney did not accurately review the discovery \nwith him or interview important witnesses in the case. \nFinally, the plaintiffs allege that as a result of Grant County's acts and omissions \nincluding policies, practices and procedures maintained in countenance by Grant County, the \nindigent persons charged with felony crimes in Grant County have suffered or afe at imminent \nand serious risk of suffering harm.  The plaintiffs contend among other things that indigent \npersons are deprived of adequate consultation and communication with attorneys, that they must \nmake decisions about their rights or contest issues without adequate factual or legal investigation \nby their attorneys, that they are deprived of meaningful opportunities to present defenses, that the \nrights of indigent persons are waived without proper consultation advice, that indigent persons \nare deprived of services ofinvestigators and expert witnesses, that indigent pers()ns' cases are \nnot properly prepared for trial and that indigent persons do not receive meaningful benefits in \nexchange for guilty pleas. \nOn March 5, 2004 the Grant County Board of County Commissioners established a new \ncontract to public defender program pursuant to Chapter 10.101 RCW which is evidently \npatterned after a similar system in Benton County.  Grant County contends the new system \ncomports to recommendations made by the ACLU in its March 2004 report entitled \"The \nUnfulfilled Promise of Gideon-Washington's Flawed System of Defense for the Poor\". \nMEMORANDUM DECISION - 5 \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington;  509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  12:58PM;  Page  6/12 \nOn April 20, 2004 Jeffrey Best entered a Statement of Defendant on Plea of Guilty to two \ncounts of burglary in the second degree and theft in the second degree.  Mr. Hutt's cases have all \nbeen resolved, he has been sentenced and is serving his time in Shelton Correctional Facility. \nMr. Campos' cases are pending. \n2.  Law Regarding Cl~~~.f.cction Certification.  A primary function of a class action \nlawsuit is to provide a procedure for vindicating claims which. taken individually, are too small \nto justifY individual legal action but which are of significant size and importance if taken as a \ngroup.  Smith v. Behr Process Com., 113 Wn.App. 306, 319 quoting Brown v. Brown, 6 \nWn.App. 249, 253 (1971).  Washington courts favor a liberal interpretation ofCR 23 as the rule \navoids multiplicity of litigation, saves members of the class the cost and trouble of filing \nindividual suits, and also frees the defendant from the harassment of identical future litigation. \nSmith, supra at 318.  Interests of justice require that in a doubtful case any error, ifthere is to be \nany, should be committed in favor of allowing the class action.  Smith, supra at 319 quoting \nEsplin v. Hirschi, 402 F.2d 94,101 (lOth Cir. 1968). \nIn a proposed action such as this one where the plaintiffs seek sweeping injunctive relief, \nquestions relating to the named plaintiffs' standing and entitlement to equitable relief, the \npropriety of class certification, and the availability of system wide relief will often overlap. \nStevens v, Hamer, 213 F.R.D. 358, 366 (2002).  Standing and entitlement to equitable relief are \nthreshold jurisdictional requirements that must be satisfied prior to class certification.  Any \nanalysis of class certification must begin with the issue of standing.  Only after the court \ndetermines the issue for which the named plaintiffs have standing should it address the question \nof whether the named plaintiffs have representative capacity.  Stevens, SURra.  On a motion to \ndismiss for lack of standing, the trial court must accept as true all material allegations of the \ncomplaint and construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.  Stevens, supra at 370. \nWhen standing has been dctem1ined, plaintiffs moving for class certification bear the \nburden of demonstrating they meet the requirements ofCR 23.  Miller  Fanner Brothers \nY. \nCompany. 115 Wn.App. 815, 820 (2003).  Where class certification is sought at the early stages \nof litigation, courts generally assume that the allegations in the pleadings are true and will not \nattempt to resolve material factual disputes or make any inquiry into the merits of the claim. \nMi.!.kr. supra; Smith, supra at 320.  Courts may, however. go beyond the pleadings and examine \nthe parties' evidence to the extent necessary to determine whether the requirements of CR 23 \nMEMORANDUM DECISION -6 \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington;  509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  12:58PM;  Page  7/12 \nhave been met.  Millet, supra: Oda v. State, III Wn.App. 79, 94, review denied, 147 Wn.2d \n1018 (2002).  Because class actions are a specialized proceeding available in limited \ncircumstances, the trial court must conduct a \"rigorous analysis\" of the CR 23 requirements to \ndetermine whether a class action is appropriate in a particular case.  Mjller. &WIll; .Qga, &!lID!. at \n93. \nTo certify a class action tbe court must detennine four elements of CR 23(a) are present, \ntbat is (I) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical; (2) that there are \nquestions of law in fact common to the class; (3) that the claims of the representative parties are \ntypical oftbe claims of the class; and (4) tbat the representative parties will fairly and adequately \nprotect tbe interests of tbe class.  In addition to satisfying tbe four requirements of CR 23( a), the \nclass action suit must fall within one of three categories of actions set forth in CR 23(b).  Here, \nthe representative plaintiffs contend CR 23(b)(2) applies because Grant County, it is contended, \nhas acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to tbe class, thereby making \nappropriate final injunctive or a corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a \nwhole.  See Sitton v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Company, 116 Wn.App. 245, 251 \n(2003). \n3.  Decision. \na.  Standing.  To establish standing, a plaintiff must allege he has suffered an injury \nin fact, that the injury was causally connected to the defendant's actions, and that it is likely tbat \nthe injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555,561,112 S.Ct. 2130,119 L.Ed. 2d 351 (1992).  Here, each of the three plaintiffs, Best, \nCampos and Hutt, is or was represented by a public defender.  They each allege they were denied \neffective assistance of counsel because the county failed to provide adequate indigent public \ndefense services to them.  Each has alleged specific facts related to the manner in which tbe \ncounty has provided and continues to provide indigent defender services and alleges specific \nfacts which detail the manner in which each of the named plaintiffs has been deprived of those \nservices. \nYet, Grant County contends Campos' claim is not ripe yet because his action is still \npending and that Best's and Hutt's claims are moot because tbeiT cases have been resolved. \nCampos' allegation that he is facing criminal prosecution without an effective lawyer at his side \ncertainly raises the prospect of serious and immediate injury or threatened injury.  The right to \nMEMORANDUM DECISION - 7 \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington;  509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  12:58PM;  Page  8/12 \neffective assistance of counsel extends to all persons accused of felonies not just those who are \ninnocent.  Harm is not limited to locking up innocent people.  The accused is prejudiced if he or \nshe is forced to plead guilty rather than run the risk of going to trial without competent counsel \nOr if counsel doesn't bother to call witnesses who can support the accused, or when the accused \nmust evaluate the pros and cons of a plea offer without competent counsel to explain the plea and \nits consequences or when counsel doesn't bother to move to suppress inadmissible evidence. \nCampos' claim is ripe. \nThe fact Best's and Hutt's claims have been resolved after this case was filed do not \nrender their claims moot.  As indicated by the United States Supreme Court in Sosna v. Iowa, \n419 U.S. 393, 402 note 11, 95 S.Ct. 553,42 L.Ed. 2d 532 (1975); \n''There may be cases in which the controversy involving the named plaintiffs is such that \nit becomes moot as to them before the district court can reasonably be expected to rule on \na certification motion.  In such instances, whether the certification can be said to 'relate \nback' to the filing of the complaint may depend on the circumstances of the particular \ncase and especially the reality of the claim that otherwise the issue would evade review.\" \nTwo classes of cases in which certification should \"relate back\" to the date of filing the \ncomplaint, preventing the case from being mooted by subsequent events involve cases where the \nallegedly illegal acts complained of are \"capable of repetition yet evading review,,4 and cases \n5 \nincluding classes that are \"inherently transitory\".  As pointed out by the plaintiffs, Best's and \nHutt's claims survive the moomess argument because their cases fall within both the classes \nallowing their cases to relate back to the date of filing even though their individual claims might \nbe otherwise moot. See Burman v. State, 50 Wn.App. 433, 439 (1988).  It is noted criminal \nproceedings are short in duration and inevitably terminate before a civil proceeding like this one \nis fully litigated.  For this reason the length of any preadjudication status is unknown and no \nmember of the class is likely to have a live claim throughout the litigation.  As such the duration \nof the challenged action is short enough to evade review.  Gerstein, supra.  Moreover, that Best \nand Hutt have led guilty does not mean they may not act as class representatives.  Putative c.1ass \nrepresentatives are not required to forego or delay legal opportwlities in order to avoid a \nmoomess challenge.  Perez-Funex v. District Director.  INS. 611 F.Supp. 990, 1000, C.D. Cal. \n• See Qerstein v. Pugq, 420 U.S. 103, Ill, note 11,95 S.C!. 854, 4S3 LEd. 2d 54 (1975). \nl See Wade v, Kirkland, 118 Fed. 3d 667, 670 (9'\" Cir. 1997). \nMEMORANDUM DECISION - 8 \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington;  509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  12:59PM;  Page  9/12 \n(1984),  Additionally, the changes in the plaintiffs' status do not moot their claims on behalf of \nthe class because the class is inherently transitory.  A class is inherently transitory when it \nconsists of a \"fluid population\", such as pretrial detainees, prisoners or indigent persons, or \nwhere there is a constant, though revolving, class of persons suffering from the same deprivation, \nCounty of Riverside v, McLaughlin, 500 U.S, 44, 52, 114 L.Ed. 2d 49, 111 S.Ct. 1661 (1991). \nThe class the plaintiffs seek to represent is fluid in that its membership shifts frequently. \nBased on the foregoing, the court concludes the plaintiffs Best, Campos and Hutt have \nstanding and that the court should proceed to its analysis under CR 23. \nb,  CR 23,  CR 23(a)(1) requires the class to be so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impractical.  A proposed class of at least 40 members creates a rebuttable \npresumption that joinder is impracticable,  Miller, supra at 821.  Here, while the numbers of the \nproposed class are by no means precise it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court \nthat the class consists of hundreds of persons with felony criminal cases currently pending in the \nGrant CQunty Superior Court and several hundred if not thousands of whom will have criminal \n6 \ncases in the future. And as has been pointed out above, the membership is inherently transitory \nso it is in a constant state oft1ux, making identification and joinder of members especially \nv' \ndifficult and therefore impracticable.  See Robinson  Peterson, 87 Wn.2d 665, 667 (1976); see \nJohnson v, MOQre, 80 Wn.2d 531, 533 (1972).  These factors and others weigh in favor of \ncertification. \nCR 23(a)(2)  requires that the proponents ofthe class demonstrate there are questions of \nlaw Of fact common to the class.  This threshold of \"commonality\" is low in the sense that it is \nqualitative rather than quantitative, that is, there need be only a single issue common to all \nmembers of the class.  Smith v. Behr, supra at 320.  Here, the plaintiffs' complaint sets forth in \nsome detail the prOblems indigent defendants have experienced.  They lack response from their \nattorneys, their attorneys failed to follow up with witnesses, their attorneys failed to assist with \ncase strategy in evaluation of plea offers, their attorneys failed to file key motions and their \nattorneys failed to even appear on behalf of them in open court.  The complaint also links the \nharmful practices it describes, contending the root causes of those practices are inadequate \n• See declaration of J. Michael Spencer, paragraph 2, in which records from Grant County Superior Court indicate as \nofJuly 19, 2004 455 criminal cases had been filed, \nMEMORANDUM DECISION -9 \n...... \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington;  509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  12:59PM;  Page  10/12 \nfunding of defense services, excessive case loads and prosecutorial interference with defense \nsystem.  The plaintiffs have satisfied the requirement of commonality. \nNext, the plaintiffs must establish under CR 23(a)(3) that the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.  \"Typicality\" is present if \nthe representative plaintiffs' claims arise \"from the same event or course of conduct which gives \nrise to claims of other class members and is based on the same legal theory.\"  Rodriguez v. \nCarlson, 166 F.R.D. 465,472 (1996).  The representative plaintiffs' claims need not be identical \nto those of other class members.  Hanlon Y. Chrysler Co[poration, 150 FJd 1011,1019 (9th Cir. \n1998).  Here, plaintiffs' claims are typical of those of other class members because their claims \narise from the same course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members, that \nis, all claims arise from Grant County's systematic deprivation of the constitutional right of \neffective assistance of counsel in its public defense system.  All the claims are based on the same \nlegal theory.  All the claims arise from appointed counsels' failure to form such basic tasks as \nreturning phone calls, appearing in court, giving legal advice, interviewing witnesses, filing \nmotions, and preparing for trial.  While the claims may vary in their precise details, they all arise \nfrom the same event or course of conduct.  Plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality requirement. \nFinally, CR 23(a)( 4) requires the representative parties ofthe class to fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.  To be adequate class representatives, plaintiffs must \nnot be involved in a collusive suit and they must not have interests antagonistic to those of the \nremainder of the class.  Lerwill v. Inflight Motion Pictures. Inc., 582 F.2d 507, S1 2 (9th eir. \n1978).  The defendant Grant County does not contest this prong of the rule head on.  Rather, it \ninsists Best and Hut! are not adequate representatives because their cases are resolved and they \ndo not belong to the class and that Campos' representation is inadequate because his case is not \nresolved.  This court rejects those arguments as outlined above.7  Here, the representative \nplaintiffs have the same interest as the class as a whole.  They seek effective assistance of legal \ncounsel for themselves and for all other indigent persons accused of felonies in Grant County. \nMoreover, each of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs is qualified, experienced and able to \nconduct the proposed litigation.  They have the resources and expertise to handle this type of \nlitigation. \n7 Under the discussion of standing, moomess and ripeness. \nMEMORANDUM DECISrON ·10 \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington; \n509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  1 :01PM;  Page  11/12 \nBased upon the foregoing the court concludes the requirements ofCR 23(a) have been \nmet. \nFinally, in addition to satisfying the four requirements of CR 23(a), this action must fall \ninto one of the three categories outlined in CR23(b).  The action does fall within the parameters \nof CR 23(b) (2) which provides that the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or a \ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class a whole.  Here, the case arises from \nGrant County's creation and maintenance of a public defense system that acts Qr fails to act in \nways applicable to all class members.  The case satisfied the \"grounds generally applicable \nwmm \nstandard outlined in CR 23(b) (2).\" Sitton,  at 25 L \nBased on the foregoing, the court concludes from its analysis that the plaintiffs have met \ntheir burden under CR 23 and that the court should certify this a class action for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief. \nS.  Motion to Compel.  The court, as indicated above, also heard oral argument on \nthe plaintiff's motion to compel.  At oral argument there appeared to be some agreement with \nrespect to two of the tbur areas of concern.  The parties indicated that Grant County had finally \ncomplied with the request for production.  To the extent that Grant County has not complied, it \nshould be ordered to do so.  Secondly, plaintiffs complained the Board of Commissioner Allison \nwas not prepared for his CR 30(b)( 6) deposition and they therefore have moved to compel that \nGrant County prepare the designee to respond to the questions outlined in the depOSition notice. \nGrant County should be ordered to prepare the designee for the 30(b)(6 ) deposition so he can \nadequately respond to questions propounded, including responding to questions concerning \nidentity and responsibility of all persons who have participated, on behalf of Grant County, in the \ndecision to seek reassignment of cases from one attorney to another since February 15, 2004. \n6.  Motion to Strike.  After reviewing the defendant's motion to strike references to \nunpublished opinions, exhibits appended to Nancy Talner's declaration and the newspaper article \nappended to Don Scaramastra' s declaration, the court respectfully should deny Grant County's \nmotion. \nCONCLUSION \nMEMORANDUM DECISION - 11 \n\nSent  By:  Kittitas County  Washington;  509  962  7094;  Aug-26-04  1 :01PM;  Page  12/12 \nBased on the foregoing analysis, the court grants the plaintiffs' motion to certify the \nclass, grants the plaintiffs' motion to compel and denies the defendant's motion to strike.

      "text": "ACLU of Washington | Content Detail http://www.aclu-wa.org/inthecourts/detail.cfm?id=302\nGrant County to Overhaul Defense\nSystem\nNovember 7, 2005\nSettling a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil\nLiberties Union of Washington and Columbia Legal Services,\nGrant County officials have agreed to overhaul the county’s\nsystem for providing legal defense to people charged with\nfelonies who cannot afford an attorney. Under the settlement,\nthe county will reduce excessive caseloads, guarantee that\npublic defense lawyers are qualified to handle serious felony\ncases, and provide adequate funding for investigators and\nexpert witnesses.\nThe parties will select a monitor to ensure compliance by the\ncounty during the six-year term of the agreement – the first\ntime a county public defense system in Washington will be\nsubject to comprehensive monitoring.\n “The right of a person accused of a crime to be assisted by a\ncompetent attorney is fundamental to a criminal justice system\nthat is fair to all. This settlement sends a strong message to\ncounties that they need to provide public defense systems that\nare fair and effective,” said Julya Hampton, legal program\ndirector for the ACLU.\nThe County agreed that its public defense system will comply\nwith standards endorsed by the Washington State Bar\nAssociation and authorized by the Washington Legislature. In\n1989 the Washington Legislature passed legislation requiring\nlocal governments to adopt standards for the delivery of\nindigent defense services. Yet a majority of counties in the state\nhave not adopted these standards.\nIn 2005 the Washington Legislature enacted House Bill 1542\nthat would have established, for the first time, limited state\nfunding for public defense programs that complied with the\nstandards. Currently it is up to counties to fund public\ndefenders for felony defendants who can’t afford their own\nattorney. However, the Legislature failed to approve the\nfunding, leaving the counties on their own in funding public\ndefense and deciding whether to comply with, or even adopt,\nthe standards. The ACLU will continue to work in the 2006\nsession to gain full state funding of House Bill 1542 to provide\npublic defense money to counties throughout the state that\npledge to comply with the Washington State Bar Association’s\nstandards.  \n“It is a miscarriage of justice when people in Washington who\nare indigent and accused of a crime are deprived of effective\nrepresentation. The lack of standards and accountability means\nthat accused people in some counties may not receive a fair\ntrial. Poor people in our justice system should not have to fear\nthat their constitutional rights may be violated,” said Joachim\nMorrison, staff attorney at Columbia Legal Services.\nThe ACLU and Columbia Legal Services filed suit in April 2004\non behalf of Jeffrey Best, Daniel Campos and Gary Dale Hutt.\nThe three were charged with felony offenses and alleged that\nGrant County’s public defense system didn’t provide indigent\nfelony defendants with effective assistance of counsel. The\nlawsuit also includes a taxpayer plaintiff, Greg Hansen, who\nwants the county to provide constitutionally adequate defense\nto indigent persons and to use public funds wisely. The court\ngranted the plaintiffs class-action status in August 2004.\nThe settlement came after Kittitas County Superior Court Judge\n1 of 2 6/18/2007 3:25 PM\n\nACLU of Washington | Content Detail http://www.aclu-wa.org/inthecourts/detail.cfm?id=302\ny p g\nMichael E. Cooper ruled in October that indigent defendants in\nGrant County have a well-grounded fear of not receiving\neffective legal counsel from the County's public defense system.\nThe judge found that Grant County’s system overworked its\nlawyers, failed to provide effective supervision, and allowed the\nGrant County Prosecutor's Office to interfere with funding for\nexpert witnesses and investigators.\nIn his ruling, Judge Cooper found it was “virtually uncontested”\nthat the Grant County public defense system in place before\nApril 2004 “suffered from systemic deficiencies, ” such as public\ndefenders with grossly excessive case loads or little meaningful\nsupervision. Judge Cooper noted that although some\nimprovements have been made with the 2005 public defense\ncontract, serious problems persist in the current system – that\n“… it still creates a well-grounded fear of immediate invasion of\nthe right to effective assistance of counsel.”\nIn addition to the deficiencies listed by Judge Cooper, the\nlawsuit also argued that Grant County’s public defenders:\n• Failed to communicate with clients\n• Did not interview potential witnesses\n• Failed to use investigators or experts\n• Failed to properly advise clients before entering guilty pleas\n• Did not file critical legal motions\n“We are very pleased with the settlement, which requires the\nCounty to comply with state and national standards, provides\nfor a monitor and implements strong enforcement\nmechanisms,” said David Taylor, an ACLU attorney in the case.\n“Nobody should face felony charges without the assistance of\nan effective and qualified attorney. This settlement should\nensure that poor people in Grant County receive that\nassistance.”\n\"We have a process to determine if a person accused of a crime\nshould be deprived of life or liberty,\" added Don Scaramastra,\nco-counsel for the plaintiffs. \"A qualified, committed, and\neffective lawyer is an absolutely essential part of that process.\nThis settlement will help ensure that people in Grant County\nwho can't afford such a lawyer get one.”\n  \nThe lawsuit has been handled by attorneys at the Perkins Coie\nand Garvey Schubert Barer law firms. The litigation team\nincludes ACLU cooperating attorneys David Taylor, Breena Roos\nand Beth Colgan from Perkins Coie and ACLU staff attorney\nNancy Talner. Garvey Schubert Barer attorneys include Don\nScaramastra, Justin Dolan and Charles Cottrell and Lori\nSalzarulo. Attorneys who have handled the case for Columbia\nLegal Services are Pat Arthur, Joachim Morrison and Chris\nKerkering.\nThe ACLU will continue to review practices in other counties to\nensure that their indigent defense systems are constitutionally\nadequate. “The Unfulfilled Promise of Gideon,” a 2004 ACLU\nreport, showed that a majority of Washington counties lacked\ncomprehensive standards for the delivery of public defense\nservices, and recommended improved state assistance to\nensure these publicly funded legal services meet basic fiscal\nand constitutional standards of accountability. \n2 of 2 6/18/2007 3:25 PM",

      "text": "Best, et al v. Grant County \nMonitor's Report \nSecond Quarter, 2007 \nJuly 16, 2007 \nSubmitted by Francisco Rodriguez, Settlement Monitor \nMonitor's Activities \nI formally assumed the role of Monitor on May 31,2007.  In order to minimize any \ntransition issues, I attempted to familiarize myself with the Grant County public defense \nsystem and its various participants as quickly as possible. \nIt is my understanding that both the parties and the prior Monitor felt that more \ninvolvement by the Monitor was needed.  Accordingly, I expect to be on site more often \nin the coming months.  During the second quarter, I traveled to Ephrata on three separate \noccaSIOns: \n•  June 5-6, 2007 \n•  June 11, 2007 \n•  June 19,2007 \nWhile in Ephrata, I observed court proceedings, reviewed court files, and met with \nvarious participants in the Grant County criminal justice system. \nIn preparation for my duties as Monitor, I reviewed the following documents, records, \nand files: \n•  Settlement Agreement \n•  Plaintiffs' summary judgment pleadings \n•  Defendant's summary judgment pleadings \n•  Court's Memorandum Decision on summary judgment \n•  Hundreds of pages of correspondence (email and letters) \n•  Attorney and Supervising Attorney employment contracts \n•  Case assignment spreadsheets \n•  Jail visit logs and sign-in sheets \n•  Complaint logs \n•  Court files in 22 cases \n•  Electronic court dockets in 33 cases \n•  Supervising Attorney Alan White's Monthly Reports \n•  Monitor's Quarterly Reports \n2007 Quarterly Report - 1 of 10 \n\nI had in person meetings with: \n•  Plaintiffs' counsel David Taylor, Beth Colgan, Nancy Talner, and Breena Roos \n•  Defense counsel Jerry Moberg and Francis Floyd \n•  Grant County Board of County Commissioners \n•  Former Monitor Jeff Robinson \n•  Grant County Superior Court Judge Evan Sperline \n•  Supervising Attorney Alan White \n•  Various Grant County public defenders \n•  June Strickler, Administrative Services Coordinator, Board of County \nCommissioners \nI had telephone conferences with: \n•  Defense counsel Francis Floyd \n•  Plaintiffs' counsel Beth Colgan \n•  Supervising Attorney Alan White \n•  Various Grant County public defenders \n•  June Strickler, Administrative Services Coordinator, Board of County \nCommissioners \nIn addition, I had extensive email contacts with Supervising Attorney Alan White and the \nGrant County public defenders. \nAccess to Information \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Monitor shall have broad access to \ninformation concerning the Grant County public defense system.  I have made extensive \nuse of this authority during the second quarter.  The County, Supervising Attorney Alan \nWhite, and the individual public defenders have all been very cooperative with my many \nrequests for information and documents.  Alan White has dealt with the bulk of my \nrequests and has been particularly helpful in tracking down needed information. \n2006 Compliance \nThe question of compliance in 2006 was unresolved when I assumed the role of Monitor. \nOn June 26, 2007, the parties and I participated in an informal conference to attempt to \nresolve this lingering dispute.  Although no agreement was reached at that time, the \nparties engaged in a fruitful dialogue that may lead a resolution of this issue in the near \nfuture.  I recently submitted my formal findings and recommendations to the parties \nregarding the dispute.  It is my hope that the parties will use these recommendations as a \nguide for amicably resolving their differences. \n2007 Quarterly Report -2 of 10 \n\nSupervising Attorney \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Monitor to assess the performance of the \nSupervising Attorney.  Although I have only served as Monitor for a short time, I have \nalready had extensive contact with Alan White.  My initial impression ofMr. White as \nSupervising Attorney is very positive. \nManaging a felony public defense unit is a difficult job under any circumstances.  In \nGrant County, the position is even more challenging because Mr. White must oversee the \nimplementation of an entirely new public defense system and simultaneously deal with \nthe administrative burden of being closely monitored by outsiders.  His wide-ranging \nadministrative responsibilities make it very difficult for him to devote sufficient time to \nthe day-to-day work of supervising, training, and mentoring the public defenders. \nMr. White does a commendable job managing his many competing responsibilities.  He \nrecognizes, however, that he has much to learn as a supervisor and seems genuine in his \ndesire to improve in that role.  His openness to change and to constructive criticism will \nserve him well in that regard.  At this point, I have every reason to expect that Mr. White \nwill continue to grow into the position and serve Grant County well for the foreseeable \nfuture. \nAlthough I am more than satisfied with Alan White's performance as Supervising \nAttorney, I do have some concerns about how the position is structured.  Currently, Mr. \nWhite is simply asked to do too much.  He supervises twelve adult felony public \ndefenders in Grant County Superior Court and four misdemeanor public defenders in \nGrant County District Court.  In addition, he has some limited administrative \nresponsibilities over juvenile court.  The administrative burden of supervising three \ndifferent courts and such a large number of lawyers makes it very difficult for Mr. White \nto find time to train and mentor the individual public defenders.  WSBA Endorsed \nStandards recommend a ratio of one full-time supervisor for every ten public defenders. \nThis is considered the minimum level needed for effective supervision. \nI am also concerned that the Supervising Attorney does not have sufficient independence \nand authority to do his job effectively.  Participants in the Grant County criminal justice \nsystem seem to routinely bring complaints about public defenders or the public defense \nsystem directly to the Board of County Commissioners.  The Commissioners \nundoubtedly have more important business to attend to than attempting to resolve petty \ndisputes between public defenders, prosecutors, and investigators.  Alan White should \nhave the responsibility and authority to handle such matters, and the Board should expect \nhim to do so.  I have discussed this issue with Mr. White and believe he is prepared to \naccept more responsibility in this regard. \nThe public defense system would have greater stability and a stronger leader if the \nCounty made a clear commitment to its Supervising Attorney.  Currently, the Supervising \nAttorney has a one-year contract.  With such little job security, it is very difficult for the \nSupervising Attorney to be an effective leader.  Moreover, the public defense program is \n2007 Quarterly Report - 3 of 10 \n\nin yearly jeopardy oflosing its head, as almost happened at the start of2007.  I \nunderstand that the County plans to open 2008 contract negotiations soon and is \nconsidering offering multi-year contracts.  At this point, I am hopeful that the 2008 \ncontracts will provide greater long-term stability to the program. \nStaffing/Caseloads \nThe County has gone to great lengths to increase staffing for 2007.  Currently, the County \nhas seven full-time public defenders and five part-time public defenders.  Based upon the \nfirst two quarters of2007, the County expects to assign approximately 1250 case \nequivalents for the year.  The capacity of existing staff is approximately 1300 case \nequivalents.  This fifty case \"cushion\" should provide sufficient flexibility to \naccommodate fluctuations in case assignments through the end of the year.  Nonetheless, \nthe County will need to be vigilant in monitoring staff caseloads and may need to add \ncapacity if monthly caseload numbers increase significantly in the second half of the \nyear.  A single \"extraordinary\" case can drastically alter staffing needs.  For example, \nGrant County Superior Court recently declined juvenile jurisdiction in a complex murder \ncase.  This case alone may absorb much of the current \"cushion.\" \nIn order to better control caseloads, the County has agreed to implement monthly and \nquarterly caseload limits.  Full-time defenders will be assigned no more than 16 cases per \nmonth and 40 cases per quarter. 1  These limits will spread each defender's workload \nmore evenly throughout the year while also ensuring that the County reserves some \ncapacity to make case assignments late in the year.  Alan White used these limits as a \ntarget in June and was able to keep all of the full-time defenders at 16 cases or less for the \nmonth and all but one under the quarterly limit of 40. \nDistribution of case assignments appears to be fairly even at the half-way point in the \nyear.  The annual caseload limit is 150 case equivalents.  Five of the seven full-time \ndefenders are on pace for a caseload of 159 credits or less for the year.  Two defenders \nare off-track but not by so much that the problem can't be corrected within a month or \ntwo.  The part-time defenders all appear to be receiving cases at an appropriate pace, with \napproximately half their yearly caseload capacity available for use in the second half of \nthe year.  Alan White has worked diligently to even out the caseload distributions and \nshould be commended for his success thus far.  Although it would be preferable to have \nthe full-time defenders at slightly lower caseloads at this point in the year, the current \nfigures are within an acceptable range.  The County recently added a fifth part-time \nattorney which should relieve some of the caseload pressure on the other defenders. \nThe number of part-time public defenders is a matter of some concern as it relates to the \nsystem's total caseload capacity for the year.  The Settlement Agreement allows Grant \nCounty to hire no more than two part-time defenders.  Yet the County currently employs \nfive.  Without these additional part-time defenders, the County does not have sufficient \nattorney capacity to cover its anticipated needs.  I understand that the parties are working \n1 In the fourth quarter, a higher limit of 44 cases will be used. \n2007 Quarterly Report -4 of 10 \n\ntogether to resolve this issue.  Absent some agreement permitting more than two part \ntime defenders, the County will have an immediate need to hire additional full-time \ndefenders in order to avoid staffing shortfalls at the end of 2007. \nSupervising Attorney Alan White has already recommended reducing the number of part \ntime attorneys and hiring at least one additional full-time defender.  I concur in that \nrecommendation.  It is my understanding that the County is exploring its options in this \narea, and I am hopeful that at least one additional full-time defender will be on staff \nbefore year's end. \nGiven the County's past difficulties in recruiting qualified full-time defenders, I am also \nconcerned about the potential for attorney turnover.  All of the full-time defenders are \nworking under one year contracts and could walk away at the end of2007.  Needless to \nsay, that would be a disaster.  In 2006, the County did not begin contract negotiations for \n2007 until very late in the year.  This created morale problems and forced many of the \ndefenders to consider other options.  To avoid such problems this year, the County has \nexpressed its intention to begin 2008 contract negotiations very soon.  I strongly support \nthat decision.  I also understand that the County is considering offering multi-year \ncontracts this year.  Multi-year contracts make sense for at least some of the defenders \nwho now have an established track record of providing quality representation.  Such \ncontracts also demonstrate the County's commitment to public defense and give the \nprogram greater stability.  I am encouraged that the County is willing to consider such a \ncommitment. \nTraining \nGrant County public defenders seem to have adequate training opportunities available.  It \nis my understanding that one of the more experienced public defenders, Robert Schiffner, \nhas been elected the group's unofficial training director.  He conducted two trainings this \nquarter, one on recent appellate decisions and another on search and seizure issues.  Alan \nWhite also arranged a presentation on work release options. \nIn addition to in-house trainings, the County has been supportive of defenders interested \nin comprehensive trial training programs such as the National Criminal Defense College \nin Macon, Georgia.  Several defenders attended that program last year and benefited \ngreatly from the experience.  Although the County encouraged additional defenders to \nattend the program this year, none of the defenders was able to attend. \nIn coming months, I plan to assist Alan White in organizing additional in-house trainings \nfor the defenders.  I also hope that some of the defenders will attend an intensive trial \ntraining program being offered by the Washington Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers this fall. \n2007 Quarterly Report - 5 of 10 \n\nJail Visits \nSupervising Attorney Alan White expects the public defenders to visit in-custody \ndefendants prior to their first appearance in court.  Each of the full-time public defenders \nis assigned to cover first appearances for a week at a time on a rotating basis throughout \nthe year.  The coverage attorney is required to visit in-custody defendants prior to court in \norder to obtain the information necessary to make a bail reduction and/or release motion. \nArraignment is scheduled approximately a week after the first appearance.  Prior to \narraignment, Alan White assigns each case to a specific defender who handles the case \nfrom that point forward.  The assigned attorney is expected to visit the defendant in jail \nprior to arraignment. \nIn reviewing 2006 compliance issues, I discovered that many defenders failed to visit \ntheir clients as required by their Supervising Attorney.  In December 2006 and January \n2007, visits by the coverage attorney prior to first appearance occurred only sporadically, \nand visits by the assigned attorney rarely occurred prior to arraignment.  Indigent \ndefendants often sat in jail for a month or more before being visited by their assigned \ndefender for the first time.  On a few occasions, there was no visit at all.  In light of the \nprior problems with jail visits, I plan to pay particular attention to this issue in the future. \nDuring the second quarter, available records suggest that some of the defenders were still \nnot regularly visiting in-custody defendants prior to the first appearance.  I cross \nreferenced jail visit logs with case assignment information and determined that only a \nfew defenders consistently made the required visits.  Some defenders made visits during \none coverage week but not in another. Others made no visits at all. \nI observed a similar pattern with respect to jail visits by defenders after being assigned as \npermanent counsel.  Some regularly visited clients in a timely fashion.  Others waited \nweeks to visit their clients in jailor failed to visit at all. \nMany of the defenders seem to consider client contact in and around the courtroom to be \nan acceptable alternative to jail visits.  When asked about contact with in-custody clients, \nthe attorneys often point to last-minute meetings in a \"secure corridor\" near the \ncourtroom.  Such meetings are not an adequate substitute for a more private and less \nhurried consultation with each client at the jail.  Indigent defendants should have the \nopportunity to meet with their lawyers in a private setting that encourages candor, allows \nfor a thorough exploration of relevant issues, and provides the client with sufficient time \nto consider available options in advance of court. \nSome of the defenders complain that timely jail visits are not particularly productive due \nto delays in receiving discovery from the Grant County Prosecutor's Office.  The \nProsecutor's Office apparently refuses to provide defenders with criminal history and is \nslow to produce police reports.  The failure of prosecutors to provide this crucial \ninformation in a timely fashion undoubtedly makes it more difficult for defenders to \nproperly advise their clients, but it does not relieve the defenders of their obligation to \n2007 Quarterly Report - 6 of 10 \n\nvisit in-custody clients as required.  The defendant may have valuable exculpatory \ninformation, pressing legal questions, or some other need to promptly consult with \ncounsel.  Moreover, the appropriate response to the prosecutors' recalcitrance is not to \nforego jail visits but to ask the court to require that the prosecutors comply with their \ndiscovery obligations. \nInvestigation \nThe County currently has contracts with four different investigators, three individuals and \none agency.  The number of investigators appears to be sufficient to meet existing needs \nexcept in cases with a large number of co-defendants.  I assume that such cases are rare \nand that the County would seek out additional investigators if needed on a case-by-case \nbasis. \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Monitor to approve all public defense \ninvestigators.  To date, none of the current investigators has been approved. \nAccordingly, I am in the process of evaluating the qualifications and experience of each \ninvestigator currently under contract.  In addition to reviewing their credentials, I intend \nto meet with the investigators individually and to solicit input from the public defenders \nwho have worked with them.  I have received a number of serious complaints about one \nof the investigators, and I will take those complaints into account in determining whether \nthe investigator should be approved. \nMost of the public defenders appear to make regular use of investigators on their cases. \nIn Grant County, the prosecutor's office provides little to no opportunity for early \nresolution of criminal cases.  This practice necessitates far more defense investigation \nthan would otherwise be necessary, because the defenders must prepare virtually every \ncase for trial.  Under the circumstances, it would be reasonable for the defenders to \ninvestigate every case.  At least one part-time defender has adopted that approach.  Most \ndefenders, however, appear to exercise some discretion in determining when \ninvestigation is appropriate.  Overall, the defenders are requesting investigators in \napproximately 34% of their criminal cases in 2007. \nWhile the general rate of investigation is adequate, the individual rates for a few \ndefenders are worrisome.  One full-time defender requests an investigator in only 7% of \nhis cases.  The rate for another is only 9%.  One part-time defender requests investigation \nin only 6% of his cases.  Another uses an investigator only 12% of the time.  These rates \nare unacceptably low.  It is clear that at least some of the defenders would benefit from \nmore training and mentoring regarding the importance of investigation. \nClient Complaints \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Supervising Attorney to establish a system to \ntrack and investigate complaints from indigent defendants regarding their assigned \n2007 Quarterly Report - 7 of 10 \n\nattorneys.  In order to meet this obligation, Alan White has established a toll-free \ntelephone line for complaints.  Notices in both Spanish and English are posted throughout \nthe jail with information on how to make a complaint.  Calls are answered by Mr. White \nor his bilingual assistant when they are in the office and by an answering machine after \nhours or when no one is in.  All complaints are logged and dealt with as appropriate. \nPreviously, the Monitor relied on the Supervising Attorney's Monthly Reports for \ncomplaint information.  After reviewing the actual complaint logs for December 2006 \nand January 2007, I became concerned that some relevant information was not being \nreported.  Accordingly, in the future, I intend to review copies of the original complaint \nlogs to ensure my review is as thorough as possible.  Alan White has also changed the \nway he reports complaints to be more all-inclusive.  For this report, I reviewed the actual \ncomplaint logs for June but otherwise relied on the Supervising Attorney's Monthly \nReports. \nMy review of the complaint logs suggests that the root of most complaints is a lack of \ncontact with the assigned attorney.  This is not surprising given the apparent problems \nwith jail visits.  Moreover, I recently learned that most of the defenders do not accept \ntelephone calls from in-custody clients.  The refusal to accept calls from jailed clients is \ncompletely unacceptable.  I have discussed the issue with Alan White, and he has agreed \nto take steps to remedy the situation.  Currently, most complaints regarding lack of \nattorney contact are simply forwarded to the assigned attorney.  The scope and ongoing \nnature of this problem, however, suggest that more follow-up may be needed. \nAside from contact issues, clients made very few substantive complaints during the \nsecond quarter.  When such complaints are made, the Supervising Attorney seems to be \ntaking appropriate steps to investigate and resolve the complaint. \nOverall Quality of Representation \nThe Settlement Agreement requires Grant County to maintain a public defense system \nthat provides effective assistance of counsel to all indigent defendants charged with \nfelonies.  Although I have not had sufficient time to fully evaluate the quality of \nrepresentation being provided, the current Grant County public defense system appears to \nbe a substantial improvement over that which allegedly existed prior to the Settlement. \nAfter observing court proceedings, reviewing court files, and meeting with public \ndefenders, it is my impression that the quality of representation provided by Grant \nCounty remains somewhat uneven.  Most of the defenders are quite capable and \ndedicated.  In my review of court files, for example, I found several instances in which \ndefenders filed appropriate motions and obtained favorable results.  I also observed \ndefenders ably representing clients in court. \nAt the same time, however, I reviewed a number of court files in which I concluded that \nthe quality of representation was unacceptable.  In at least three cases, I found that the \n2007 Quarterly Report - 8 of 10 \n\nassigned defenders had failed to litigate what appeared to be winning legal issues.  In \neach case, the client ended up with a felony conviction rather than a dismissal or at least a \nmisdemeanor because the assigned attorney did not bother to file the necessary motions. \nThe problem was particularly glaring in two of the three cases because the co-defendants \nin those cases had defenders who did litigate the identical issues and obtained \nsubstantially better outcomes.  Alan White has reviewed each of these cases with the \nassigned defender, and I am optimistic that such problems can be avoided in the future \nwith further training and mentoring. \nI am concerned with the overall number of trials by defenders in Grant County.  During \nthe second quarter, the defenders had one jury trial and one bench trial.  For the year, \nthere have been a total of three jury trials and two bench trials.  That represents a trial rate \nof approximately 1%   of felony cases assigned this year.  The dearth of trials in Grant \nCounty is not new.  Only one of the full-time defenders has had more than one trial since \nthe start of2006.  Three full-time defenders have not had a single trial during that time. \nFor any individual defender, there may be a valid explanation for the lack of trials, but \nthe total number of trials by the Grant County public defenders as a group seems \nunusually low. \nLaw Library \nOne area of great concern to the defenders has been the change in location of the law \nlibrary.  The new location has meant the loss of after-hours access to legal research \nmaterials.  In addition, the defenders no longer have a convenient private location to meet \nwith out of custody clients.  To its credit, the County has agreed to create two attorney \nclient meeting rooms near the former location of the library.  I understand that substantial \nprogress has been made in re-designing the space, and I hope that construction will be \ncompleted in the near future.  I also plan to discuss with the County the possibility of \nmoving one of the law library's Westlaw terminals into this new area so that the attorneys \ncan again have after-hours access to online legal research. \nOther Issues \nI do not have sufficient information at this time to evaluate several areas covered by the \nSettlement Agreement such as the use and availability of interpreters, the conflicts check \nsystem, the administrative support for individual defenders, and the use of expert \nservices.  I plan to address these issues during the upcoming quarter. \nConclusion \nThe second quarter of 2007 has been an eventful one for the Grant County public defense \nsystem.  In addition to adjusting to a new Settlement Monitor, the parties spent a great \ndeal of time and effort addressing unfinished business from 2006.  Despite dealing with \n2007 Quarterly Report - 9 of 10 \n\nsome contentious issues, all involved seem committed to being constructive and working \ntogether to ensure that indigent defendants in Grant County receive quality \nrepresentation.  At this point, the most pressing issues for the parties are the 2008 \ncontracts and achieving some resolution as to the number of part-time defenders that may \nbe used for the remainder of 2007.  The parties are well aware of the importance of these \nissues, and I expect to be able to report significant progress in addressing them in my \nnext report. \n2007 Quarterly Report - 10 of 10 ",

      "text": "Best, et al. v. Grant County \n \nMonitor’s Report \n \nThird Quarter, 2007 \n \nOctober 25, 2007 \n \nSubmitted by Francisco Rodriguez, Settlement Monitor \n \nMonitor’s Activities \n \nMy goal is to be on site in Grant County at least once per month.  During the third \nquarter, I traveled to Ephrata on three separate occasions:   \n \n•  August 1, 2007 \n•  August 21, 2007 \n•  September 18-19, 2007 \n \nWhile in Ephrata, I observed court proceedings, reviewed court files, and met with \nvarious participants in the Grant County criminal justice system. \n \nIn addition to monthly visits, I maintain regular contact with supervisor Alan White via \nemail and telephone.  I also have periodic contact with individual defenders, \ninvestigators, and counsel for both parties.  \n \nAccess to Information \n \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Monitor shall have broad access to \ninformation concerning the Grant County public defense system.  I routinely request \ninformation from Supervising Attorney Alan White, and both he and his assistant Aracely \nYanez have been very cooperative in responding to my requests.   \n \nOn one occasion, however, Alan White declined to provide me with information \nregarding new applicants for attorney positions, including those that had been offered \ncontracts for 2008.  Mr. White informed me that he was directed by counsel for the \nCounty not to provide this information.  I am troubled that the County would \nintentionally withhold information from me and am left to wonder what other information \nmay have been withheld.  In this case, I ultimately obtained the requested information \nfrom June Strickler, Administrative Assistant to the Board of County Commissioners.   \n \n2006 Compliance \n \nThe question of compliance in 2006 remains unresolved.  I submitted my findings and \nrecommendations to the parties in July.  The County appears to have adopted some but \n2007 Quarterly Report - 1 of 11 \n\nnot all of my recommendations.   I expect that the parties will seek to revisit this issue in \nthe near future.   \n \nSupervising Attorney \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Monitor to assess the performance of the \nSupervising Attorney.  In my last report, I noted that my initial impression of Alan \nWhite’s performance was quite positive.  While I remain convinced that Mr. White is \nwell-intentioned and does an admirable job juggling an overwhelming workload, I have \nsome reservations about his ability to effectively lead the Grant County public defense \nprogram as currently structured. \n \nMr. White continues to have too many responsibilities.  The Settlement Agreement \nrequires the County to hire a “full-time” supervising attorney for the adult felony public \ndefense system.  Yet Alan White is asked to supervise not only adult felony defense but \nalso district and juvenile court matters.  His obligations as supervisor of district and \njuvenile court interfere with his ability to devote sufficient time to felony public defense.   \n \nIn addition to supervising public defense in too many different courts, Mr. White \nsupervises too many attorneys.  WSBA Endorsed Standards recommend a ratio of one \nfull-time supervisor for every ten public defenders.   This is considered the minimum \nlevel needed for effective supervision.  Mr. White currently supervises nine full-time \nfelony defenders and four part-time felony defenders.  In addition, he supervises at least 6 \nother defenders in district and juvenile courts.  His workload thus far exceeds that \nrecommended by WSBA Endorsed Standards for public defense.  He simply cannot be an \neffective supervisor under the current management structure.   \n \nFurthermore, the demands of being monitored pursuant to the Settlement Agreement only \nadd to Mr. White’s already unmanageable workload.  In addition to writing detailed \nmonthly reports, Mr. White must routinely compile, organize and track an enormous \namount of data.  This administrative burden far exceeds that borne by most similarly \nsituated public defense supervisors.   \n \nIt is my recommendation that the County reduce Mr. White’s workload by hiring an \nassistant supervisor or separate district and juvenile court supervisor.  The County should \nalso reduce the number of part-time attorneys used so that Mr. White supervises no more \nthan ten attorneys. \n \nApart from his workload, I have concerns about whether Mr. White can effectively \nmanage the program unless the County gives him more authority and independence.  He \ncurrently lacks the power to hire, fire, or even discipline staff in any meaningful way.  As \na result, few of the defenders view him as their boss in anything but a technical sense.  \nBoth defenders and investigators assume (correctly) that they may openly defy him with \nlittle or no negative consequences.  When dealing with a group of strong-minded, \nrebellious individuals, as defenders tend to be, stripping their leader of any real authority \nis a recipe for chaos. \n2007 Quarterly Report - 2 of 11 \n\n \nThese structural issues are magnified by the County’s relationship with and management \nof Mr. White.  Rather than treating him as on par with other professionals in the criminal \njustice system such as the prosecutor and the sheriff, the County treats Mr. White as \nthough he is merely an administrator who needs to be kept on a short leash.  While I \nunderstand that Mr. White does not hold elected office, the County must give him a \nmeasure of independence if the system is to function properly.  Instead, it seems that \nwhenever he does something that displeases County officials, he is scolded and instructed \nto stop the offending conduct immediately.  This practice undermines whatever authority \nMr. White does have and reinforces the perception that he is a relatively powerless \nbureaucrat.   \n \nMr. White faces an extraordinarily difficult task.  He must manage a defender group \ncomprised of strong, often conflicting personalities.  He must do so while having little \nreal authority over them and while dealing with a tremendous administrative burden.  I \nquestion whether anyone could be successful under these circumstances.  Mr. White is \nsimply pulled in too many different directions.  He has too much to do and answers to too \nmany people (clients, defenders, judges, Commissioners, counsel for the County, and the \nMonitor). \n \nAlan White is smart, diligent, and dedicated.  He has struggled to make the best of a very \ndifficult situation.  Absent sufficient authority to force compliance with his instructions, \nhe trades on his personal likeability to get things done.  Despite his best efforts, however, \nthe public defense program continues to be somewhat dysfunctional.  The defenders as a \ngroup lack cohesion and enjoy little of the comradery that is typically found in defender \norganizations.  There is no accountability for failure to follow established procedures, and \nthe defenders sometimes treat each other and their supervisor with disrespect.  Some of \nthese problems relate to personality clashes within the group.  Some relate to the \nCounty’s failure to give Alan White any real authority over the defenders.  All of the \nproblems are worsened by the fact that Mr. White is overwhelmed by administrative \nresponsibilities and has little time left to focus on broader issues. \n \nWhile he faces many impediments to running a successful program that are beyond his \ncontrol, there are areas in which Mr. White could improve.  In my opinion, Mr. White \nshould make mentoring a higher priority.  He needs to be more assertive in advocating for \nthe defenders and their clients, even in the face of opposition from the County.  He needs \nto find a way to enforce discipline amongst the defenders when necessary.  Finally, he \nshould exercise more independence of judgment.  Seeking out advice and input when \nmaking decisions is always a good idea, but Mr. White needs to have more confidence in \nhis own judgment when resolving problems rather than deferring to others for direction. \n \nStaffing/Caseloads \n   \nThe Grant County public defense program experienced significant upheaval in the third \nquarter.  In early August, Mike Aiken, one of the full-time defenders, suffered serious \ninjuries in a fall and as a result, he has been out of commission for the last few months.  \n2007 Quarterly Report - 3 of 11 \n\nHis loss reduced caseload capacity for the quarter, and his existing cases had to be re-\nassigned.   His earliest anticipated return date is sometime in November.  To its credit, \nthe County quickly responded to the loss by hiring a new full-time defender for 2008 and \nconvincing her to start early.  She began work on September 1, 2007, minimizing the \ndisruption caused by Mr. Aiken’s accident. \n \nIn September, the County announced its decisions regarding staffing for 2008.  Some of \nthe current defenders were not invited to return and that has created some tension in the \ngroup.  Moreover, two of the most experienced attorneys are leaving, and I am concerned \nabout whether the County will have sufficient capacity to handle the most serious cases.  \nNonetheless I applaud the County for initiating contract negotiations much earlier this \nyear and for offering most of the defenders two year contracts, giving the program more \nstability.   \n \nThe departure of several current defenders for 2008 has ramifications for 2007 as well.  \nThree of the departing defenders have invoked contract provisions that prohibit the \nCounty from assigning them cases for the last 45 days of the year.  This effectively \nreduces their fourth quarter caseload capacity to a maximum of 32 case equivalents.  The \nnet loss to the County’s caseload capacity from these departures is approximately 15 case \nequivalents.  Moreover, the loss of these defenders will create additional pressure in \nDecember when the County will not be able to assign the affected defenders any cases at \nall. \n \nOver the last three months, Alan White has maintained a fairly even distribution of case \nassignments while observing both monthly and quarterly caseload limits.  The \nunpredictability of child support credits and credits for extraordinary cases continues to \nbe a challenge.  I have been working with Mr. White to develop policies to address these \nissues. \n \nBased upon the first three quarters of 2007, the County expects to assign approximately \n1224 case equivalents for the year.  The County projects the capacity of existing staff to \nbe approximately 1264 case equivalents.  This projected forty case “cushion” is below the \nminimum I believe is necessary to ensure the County has sufficient attorney capacity \nthrough the end of the year.  I understand, however, that the County has hired two new \nfull-time defenders for 2008 and anticipates that each may be able to accept some case \nassignments in 2007.   \n \nThere are a number of unresolved issues lurking that could dramatically affect the \nCounty’s caseload capacity in the fourth quarter.  First, the County assumes that Mike \nAiken will return and carry a full caseload in November.  Even if he returns, I question \nthe whether it is reasonable to assume he can immediately manage a full-time caseload.   \n \nSecond, one of the full-time defenders has not accounted for his time on extraordinary \ncases for almost four months.  I understand that he may have hundreds of unreported \nhours.  These credits alone could potentially absorb much of the County’s current \ncushion.   \n2007 Quarterly Report - 4 of 11 \n\n \nThird, the County continues to use more part-time attorneys than permitted by the \nSettlement Agreement.  If the County limits itself to only two for the remainder of the \nyear as provided in the Settlement Agreement, caseload capacity will be further reduced.  \n \nFinally, it appears that almost all of the full-time defenders are maintaining some level of \nprivate practice.  A recent search on the Washington Courts website revealed that all but \none of the full-time public defenders currently engage in some degree of private practice.   \nThe Settlement Agreement permits full-time defenders to have a limited private practice, \nbut for those who do, the annual caseload limit must be reduced to 140 cases.  Both the \ndefenders and the County have been repeatedly reminded of this requirement.  \nAccordingly, I assume that the County will assign those defenders no more than 140 \ncases in 2007.  This will obviously have a significant impact on the system’s overall \ncapacity. \n \nIn light of all of these issues, it is my opinion that unless the County adds caseload \ncapacity, there is a significant risk of that there will be another staffing shortfall at the \nend of 2007.  Accordingly, it is absolutely critical that the County proceed with plans to \nhave its 2008 hires start early and/or make other arrangements to ensure that indigent \ndefendants are not left without counsel at the end of the year. \n \nTraining \n \nGrant County public defenders seem to have adequate training opportunities available.  \nDuring this quarter, Alan White organized a training relating to substance abuse \ntreatment alternatives.  In addition, I conducted a 2 hour CLE on communicating with in-\ncustody clients, the attorney-investigator relationship, and motions practice. \n \nJail Visits \n \nSupervising Attorney Alan White has adopted a written policy requiring the public \ndefenders to visit in-custody defendants prior to their first appearance in court.  Each of \nthe full-time public defenders is assigned to cover first appearances for a week at a time \non a rotating basis throughout the year.  The coverage attorney is required to visit in-\ncustody defendants prior to court in order to obtain the information necessary to make a \nbail reduction and/or release motion.   \n   \nArraignment is scheduled approximately a week after the first appearance.  Prior to \narraignment, Alan White assigns each case to a specific defender who handles the case \nfrom that point forward.  The assigned attorney is expected to visit the defendant in jail \nprior to arraignment. \n \nIn my last report, I noted that some defenders were not making the required jail visits.  \nSince then, I have endeavored to emphasize to the public defenders the importance of \nthese visits.  I spoke at length on the issue at an August CLE in Ephrata and also \naddressed the topic in correspondence with the defenders.   \n2007 Quarterly Report - 5 of 11 \n\n \nIn cross-referencing jail visitation logs with first appearance dockets for the third quarter, \nI noticed a marked improvement in the number of jail visits by the attorneys covering \nfirst appearances.  Brian Gwinn and Janelle Peterson in particular were extremely diligent \nin making these visits.  Some of the defenders still seem somewhat erratic about visiting \nfirst appearance clients, however.  For two different weeks, I could not find any record of \njail visits by the coverage attorney.  In a few other weeks, it appeared as though the \nattorneys only made sporadic or token efforts to visit inmates scheduled for first \nappearances. \n \nWith respect to jail visits for assigned clients, I compared case assignment records with \njail visitation logs and concluded that most of the full-time defenders were visiting their \nnew clients in a timely fashion.1  The part-time defenders, however, do not appear to visit \nclients promptly as required.  I plan to ask Alan White to speak with them about this \nproblem and monitor their jail visits more closely. \n \nInvestigation \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Monitor to approve all public defense \ninvestigators.  Upon assuming the role of monitor, I learned that the County’s \ninvestigators had never been approved.  Accordingly, I initiated a review of the \ninvestigators employed by the County in order to determine whether each was \nappropriate for felony defense investigations.   \n \nAfter completing my review, I approved Jim Patterson, Mike Lewton, and Ellyn Berg to \nwork on felony public defense investigations.  I did not approve Basin Investigations. \nThe County subsequently asked that I approve Marv Scott, and I approved him early last \nmonth.  \n \nDuring the third quarter, there were two troubling incidents involving investigators from \nBasin Investigations.  In one case, an investigator contacted a represented co-defendant in \nthe jail without his attorney’s permission and interviewed the inmate regarding the case \non which he was represented by counsel.  The investigator’s conduct was a clear \nviolation of the Rules of Professional Conduct and not sanctioned by the attorney for \nwhom he was working.  In another case, the defense investigator conducted a tape-\nrecorded interview of a key witness and then withheld information regarding the \ninterview from the assigned attorney.  The investigator apparently decided that because it \nwas damaging to the defendant, the attorney wouldn’t want to know about it.  When the \nprosecutor learned of the interview months later, the defendant’s plea deal fell apart and \nthe defense attorney was left to explain why he had not complied with a court order to \nproduce such information.  Needless to say, the conduct of these investigators cast the \npublic defense program in a very bad light. \n \n                                                 \n1 The available case assignment records do not indicate whether a given defendant is in or out of custody.  \nThis limits my ability to accurately assess the promptness of visits for all clients.  For example, if the \nattorney never visits the client, that fact will not be apparent from the records I reviewed.   \n2007 Quarterly Report - 6 of 11 \n\nMost of the public defenders continue to make regular use of investigators on their cases.  \nInvestigation rates for this quarter varied between 17% and 83%.  Overall, the defenders \nrequested investigation in 41% percent of their cases in the third quarter.  I consider this \nto be an adequate rate of investigation.  On an individual level, there was some \nimprovement from last quarter.  Two of the more experienced full-time attorneys and one \nof the part-time attorneys increased their investigation requests this quarter to a more \nacceptable level.  For these defenders, it is possible that the unusually low rates last \nquarter were simply an aberration.   \n \nTwo of the part-time defenders, however, continued to demonstrate a lack of \nunderstanding regarding the appropriate use of investigation.  One attorney requests \ninvestigation in virtually every case but provides no guidance of any kind to the \ninvestigator.  His requests seem to be more a reflex than a reasoned assessment of the \nneed for investigation in a particular case.   \n \nThe other problematic attorney requests investigation in very few cases.  Upon learning \nthat his use of investigators had been questioned, the attorney asked “Does an \ninvestigator need to be obtained for a crime arising out of a traffic stop, an assault with no \nwitnesses, a case where there are witnesses, corroborating evidence, statements, and there \nis a properly obtained confession?  Generally, I think not.”  This statement demonstrates \na startling lack of skepticism as to the government’s evidence.  The role of the public \ndefender is to question the State’s evidence not blindly accept what is written in a police \nreport.  Obviously, one cannot know whether a traffic stop was legal, a confession was \nproperly obtained, or witnesses are reliable without some level of investigation.   \n \nClient Complaints \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Supervising Attorney to establish a system to \ntrack and investigate complaints from indigent defendants regarding their assigned \nattorneys.  In order to meet this obligation, Alan White has established a telephone line \nfor complaints.  Notices in both Spanish and English are posted throughout the jail with \ninformation on how to make a complaint.  Calls are answered by Mr. White or his \nbilingual assistant when they are in the office and by an answering machine after hours or \nwhen no one is in.  All complaints are supposed to be logged and dealt with as \nappropriate. \n \nDuring the third quarter, I learned of two significant problems with the County’s \ncomplaint system.  First, the County currently has no system for informing out-of-\ncustody inmates how to make a complaint.  I understand that Alan White is working with \nthe defenders to develop a solution to this problem.  Second, inmates who reach the \nanswering machine are generally cut off and unable to record a message.  As a result, \ninmates who call at a time when neither Mr. White nor his assistant are in the office have \nno means of communicating their complaints.  \n \nThe complaint logs for the third quarter reveal that once again the vast majority of client \ncalls relate to a need for contact with the assigned attorney.   I found 47 calls that either \n2007 Quarterly Report - 7 of 11 \n\nrequested a jail visit or asked that a message be passed on to the assigned attorney.  There \nare two main reasons for these calls.  First, some attorneys are not visiting their clients as \noften as they should.  Second, the inmates cannot reach their attorneys by phone.  The \nlack of telephone access and resulting lack of regular communication between attorneys \nand their clients is the primary cause of client complaints in Grant County.   \n \nIn-custody defendants generally cannot make outgoing calls from the jail except via a \ncollect call.  While other jurisdictions make exceptions for calls to public defenders, \nGrant County has declined to do so.  This system creates an unnecessary impediment to \nattorney-client communication.  Clients are unable to leave a simple voicemail message \nfor their attorneys to request a case update or ask for help with an emergency situation.  \nMoreover, some attorneys refuse to accept collect calls at all leaving their clients with no \ndirect means of requesting information or assistance from the attorney.  Some of the calls \nto the complaint line in the third quarter illustrate the problem with this approach.  In \nJuly, for example, an inmate called because the police had come by to question him at the \njail, and he wanted someone to let his attorney know.  In August, another inmate called to \nask someone to contact his attorney because he needed an emergency furlough to attend \nthe birth of his child.  There can be no question that a private attorney would accept such \ncalls from a paying client.  There is no excuse for treating indigent defendants as second \nclass citizens by denying them telephone access to their attorneys. \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that each defender “maintain a bilingual (English-\nSpanish) telephone and message system or other comparable system that allows \nincarcerated clients and other clients to leave messages.”  No such system is currently in \nplace.  I have asked the County to arrange for inmates to have telephone access to \ncounsel without having to make a toll call, but I have encountered significant resistance \nfrom both the County and the individual defenders.  Frankly, I am baffled at the response \nI have received.  The County seems unwilling to confront the funding, political and \nlogistical issues involved in requiring the jail to change its policies.  Some of the \ndefenders seem to fear a barrage of client calls or are unwilling to deal with the hassle \nassociated with obtaining reimbursement for collect calls.  Rather than continue to \nreimburse attorneys for collect calls, the County is now requiring each defender to obtain \na toll free number.  I do not believe this is a workable solution.  The County’s plan \neffectively shifts the cost of the calls to the individual defenders and amounts to a pay \ncut.  Furthermore, it is my understanding that even with a toll free line, the attorneys will \nbe required to pay a per minute charge for each call thus creating a disincentive to accept \nclient calls.  Finally, based upon the information I have received, having a toll free \nnumber, by itself, will not allow inmates to bypass the jail’s collect call system.   \n \nI consider inmate telephone access to attorneys to be a critical issue for Grant County \npublic defense.  In-custody defendants must have a means of communicating with their \nattorneys by phone.  This is particularly important when so many of the defenders live \noutside of Grant County and may not be able to visit as frequently as a local attorney.   \nThe complaint logs demonstrate that attorneys who accept calls from in-custody clients \nreceive far fewer complaints than those who do not.  Defendants who are able \n2007 Quarterly Report - 8 of 11 \n\ncommunicate with their clients have more faith in their attorneys and the system as a \nwhole.    \n \n \nOverall Quality of Representation \n   \nThe Settlement Agreement requires Grant County to maintain a public defense system \nthat provides effective assistance of counsel to all indigent defendants charged with \nfelonies.  The quality of representation in individual cases is difficult to evaluate without \na careful review of the attorney’s case file and access to the defendant.  To date, I have \nnot been able to devote sufficient time to conduct such a comprehensive review of \nindividual cases.   \n \nMy general impression is that the quality of representation provided by Grant County \npublic defenders has improved but is not yet what it should be.  For example, I recently \nlearned that one of the defenders who had been assigned as co-counsel in a murder case \nfor almost a year had never met his client.  A month before the scheduled trial date, the \ndefender had done nothing on the case except read the discovery and planned to simply \nshow up for trial without further preparations.  When lead counsel asked him to actually \nwork on the case, he balked and moved to withdraw.  After his motion to withdraw was \ndenied, he informed me that he still had no intention of working on the case, and while he \nwould attend the trial, he would not conduct direct or cross-examination of any witness, \ngive opening or closing, or participate in voir dire.  Needless to say, I found his position \nshockingly unprofessional and completely unethical.  So long as examples like this \npersist, I have difficulty concluding that Grant County has successfully overhauled its \npublic defense system. \n \nI also remain concerned with rate of trials by defenders in Grant County.  During the \nsecond quarter, the defenders had one jury trial and two bench trials.  For the first three \nquarters of the year, there have been a total of four jury trials and four bench trials.  The \ntrial rate for the year continues to hover around 1% of felony cases assigned.  In my \nopinion, there should be more trials in Grant County.  Attempting to determine the \nreasons for the unusually low trial rate will be one of my priorities for the fourth quarter. \n \nConflicts of Interest \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the County and each defender to have a conflicts-\ncheck system and procedure.  Although the supervising attorney notes co-defendants for \neach case to ensure that each defendant has separate counsel, the County has no formal \nprocedure for checking conflicts.  When a witness or victim name seems familiar to him, \nAlan White checks for public defender representation in the years 2005-2007. This \nprocess occurs 2-3 times per month.  In all other cases, Mr. White relies on the individual \ndefenders to notify him whenever a conflict arises.  He estimates that a defender notifies \nhim of a conflict on an average of less than one case per month.  \n \n2007 Quarterly Report - 9 of 11 \n\nThe Settlement Agreement also requires the County to maintain a list of attorneys \navailable to handle conflicts cases.  These attorneys must meet WSBA-Endorsed \nStandards and must be approved by Monitor.  The County does not currently maintain \nsuch a list.  At the end of August, the Grant County prosecutor filed charges against 12 \nco-defendants in a complex drug case (known as the “Mattawa 12”).  The County did not \nhave a sufficient number of public defenders available to represent all of the defendants \nand was forced to hire outside counsel.   \n \nWhen I reminded the Supervising Attorney that the Settlement Agreement requires me \nconflicts counsel, he submitted for my approval the three private attorneys assigned to \nrepresent Mattawa 12 co-defendants.  Unfortunately, I was not able to approve any of the \nattorneys submitted.  Two had district court caseloads that far exceeded WSBA-Endorsed \nStandards.  The third may ultimately be approved, but the County has not yet provided \nsufficient information for me to properly evaluate him.  At present, the County has no \nattorneys approved as conflicts counsel. \n \nIn a related vein, the County currently has only 4 approved investigators.  Attorneys \nrepresenting two of the Mattawa 12 co-defendants have already requested investigators.  \nIf three or more of the remaining 10 co-defendants request an investigator, the County \nwill be left scrambling to find qualified candidates.  Planning ahead for such a possibility \nwould be in the best interests of indigent defendants and would likely save the County \nmoney in the long run as emergency hiring is almost always more expensive that \ncontingency hiring. \n \nWhile not common, cases with more than four co-defendants do arise from time to time, \nand the County should have some contingency plan for obtaining additional investigators \nif needed.  Accordingly, I recommend that the County compile a list of conflicts \ninvestigators to be used in cases with a large number of co-defendants. \n \nOther Issues \n \nThere continue to be requirements of the Settlement Agreement that I have not yet \naddressed including interpreters, experts, and administrative support for defenders.  I will \nendeavor to evaluate those areas in more detail in the coming months. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe Grant County public defense system remains a work in progress.  The County \nexperienced a tumultuous third quarter.  Over the last several months, we learned that \nthree of the seven full-time defenders would not return for 2008.  Meanwhile two new \nfull-time defenders have joined the ranks, and two more new hires are expected to start \nwork in November and December.  While the County has lost a great deal of experience \nin the departing defenders, I am hopeful that the changes in personnel will help improve \nthe group dynamic, infuse the program with some energy, and bring a fresh approach to \nsome of the problems facing the County’s public defenders.  The most pressing issue \nfacing the County in the fourth quarter is ensuring that it has sufficient attorney capacity \n2007 Quarterly Report - 10 of 11 \n\nfor the remainder of the year.  Toward that end, the County must work with the plaintiffs \nto resolve lingering issues regarding the use of part-time defenders and the private \npractices of the County’s full-time defenders.   \n2007 Quarterly Report - 11 of 11 ",

      "text": "Best, et al. v. Grant County \n \nMonitor’s Report \n \nFirst Quarter, 2008 \n \nApril 20, 2008 \n \nSubmitted by Francisco Rodriguez, Settlement Monitor \n \n \nMonitor’s Activities \n \nMy goal is to visit Grant County at least once per month.  During the first quarter of this \nyear, I travelled to Ephrata on three separate occasions:   \n \n  January 7-9, 2008 \n  February 4-5, 2008 \n  March 3-5, 2008 \n \nWhile in Ephrata, I observed court proceedings, reviewed court files, and met with public \ndefenders.   \n \nIn addition to site visits, I maintain regular contact with supervisor Alan White via email \nand telephone.  I also have periodic contact with individual defenders, investigators, and \ncounsel for both parties.  \n \n \nAccess to Information \n \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Monitor shall have broad access to \ninformation concerning the Grant County public defense system.  Supervising Attorney \nAlan White and his assistant Aracely Yanez, have always been very cooperative in \nresponding to my requests.   The Grant County Superior Court Clerk’s Office also \ncontinues to be very accommodating in my requests for access to court files.  Finally, \nJune Strickler, Administrative Assistant to the Board of County Commissioners, has been \nhelpful whenever I have requested her assistance with records requests. \n \nMy only difficulties in obtaining access to information have been due to objections raised \nby counsel for the County.  In my last report, I noted that the County had declined to \nproduce a copy of correspondence relating to a potential violation of the Settlement \nAgreement involving private practice by its defenders.  I formally requested the \ninformation on November 16, 2007 and asked that it be provided as soon as possible.  I \ndid not receive a copy of the letter until February 15, 2008.   \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 1 of 13 \n\nDuring the first quarter, I again experienced some resistance to providing me with the \ninformation necessary to carry out my duties.  Shortly after my last report was released, \nSupervising Attorney Alan White informed me that he had been instructed to limit my \naccess to information by requiring me to make a public disclosure request for anything \nbeyond the information that typically accompanies his monthly reports.  Mr. White \nfurther informed me that I would not be permitted to attend public defender staff \nmeetings unless specifically invited.  I subsequently discussed my concerns regarding \nthese new polices with counsel for the County and was assured that there had been a \nmisunderstanding.  As far as I have been able to discern, I have continued to receive the \nsame level of cooperation from Alan White as before. \n \n \n2007 Compliance \n \nThe parties dispute whether the County complied with the Settlement Agreement in 2007.  \nThat dispute has now been submitted to me for findings and recommendations.  Plaintiffs \nhave asserted violations relating to first appearance coverage, the Supervising Attorney’s \nresponsibilities, conflicts counsel, part-time defenders, investigators, and several other \nissues.  The County had denied these alleged violations. \n \n \nSupervising Attorney \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Monitor to oversee and evaluate the performance \nof the Supervising Attorney.  In past reports, I have identified several areas of concern \nrelating to the Supervising Attorney in Grant County.  My concerns generally fall into the \nfollowing categories:  \n \n  (1)  Lack of independence/authority; \n  (2)  Conflicting roles; \n(3)  Excessive workload; and \n(4)  Ineffective leadership/management style. \n \nThese issues continued to be problematic during the first quarter to varying degrees. \n \nIt is my impression that the County was less involved in the day-to-day operation of the \npublic defense program during the first quarter than it had been in the past.  Both the \nCounty Commissioners and counsel for the County made themselves available to provide \nguidance to Mr. White as requested, but by and large, the County was more responsive \nand less interventionist than in the past.  I consider this a very positive development. \n \nThe County also seemed to involve Mr. White more directly in some recent hiring \ndecisions.  Mr. White interviewed and recommended that the County hire Tom Stotts as \nan investigator.  He was also asked to recruit attorneys for the County’s conflicts panel.   \nIn the past, Mr. White’s involvement in the hiring process has been either non-existent or \nan afterthought.  With both Mr. Stotts and the conflicts panel, however, Mr. White seems \n2008 Quarterly Report - 2 of 13 \n\nto have taken the lead.  I consider this to be a more appropriate role for the Supervising \nAttorney.   Yet despite giving him a greater role in minor hiring decisions, the County \ncontinues to bypass Mr. White when making major hiring decisions.  For example, I \nrecently learned that the County has apparently interviewed and offered a contract to a \nnew defender that Mr. White has never even spoken to. \n \nIn terms of workload, despite my recommendations to the contrary, the County continues \nto require Mr. White to supervise both district and juvenile court.  By his own admission, \nMr. White has no time to actually supervise the attorneys assigned to those courts.  He \nessentially functions solely as an administrator.  While his administrative responsibilities \nare not as burdensome as true supervision would be, that work still requires a substantial \ninvestment of time and effort by both Mr. White and his assistant.  Administering these \nother courts clearly detracts from the time available to felony defenders and seems \ncontrary to the requirement that the County employ a “full-time” felony supervisor. \n \nUltimately, Mr. White must work within the constraints he has been given as Supervising \nAttorney.  In 2007, he struggled with those constraints in attempting to manage a \nrebellious and insubordinate staff without sufficient authority to enforce discipline.  To \nmake matters worse, his leadership style was ill-suited to the situation.  In 2008, the staff \nis much more receptive to Mr. White’s leadership.  The defenders seem to respect him \npersonally and professionally and to accept his authority over them.  The working \nenvironment in general seems much more cooperative and collegial.   \n \nMr. White showed good judgment in several managerial decisions during the first \nquarter.  When one of the new defenders was involved in a multi-week trial, for example, \nMr. White was careful to ensure that none of that defender’s new clients were in custody.  \nWhen he learned that prosecutors intended to seek restitution for the costs of defense \ninvestigation, he took steps to ensure that confidential information relating to \ninvestigation would be protected.  When one of the defenders suddenly became \nunavailable due to a medical emergency, he responded quickly and appropriately by re-\nassigning his cases to new counsel.    \n \nHandling crises and managing attorney workloads are essential skills for an effective \nsupervisor, but Mr. White’s core responsibility remains ensuring that indigent defendants \nin Grant County receive quality representation.  Toward that end, I challenged Mr. White \nto improve attorney performance in 2008 by focusing on some of the persistent problem \nareas from last year.  More specifically, I asked Mr. White to focus on jail visits, \ninvestigation, motions, and case coverage.   \n \nI was disappointed last year to discover that Mr. White was unaware of problems with jail \nvisits and investigation rates until I pointed them out to him.  Accordingly, I asked Mr. \nWhite to monitor those areas more closely in 2008 and to take prompt corrective action if \nnecessary.  In particular, I urged him to pay close attention to the practices of the newly \nhired defenders who lacked any track record with the County.  Unfortunately, as \ndiscussed in more detail below, I observed many of the same problems with jail visits and \ninvestigation this year that I noted in my reports last year.  Moreover, Mr. White was \n2008 Quarterly Report - 3 of 13 \n\nagain surprised to learn about these problems.  He indicated that due to his other \nresponsibilities, he simply did not have sufficient time to scrutinize the attorneys’ jail \nvisits and investigation requests as he had planned.1  Mr. White and I recently engaged in \na productive dialogue about these issues, and he has already taken steps to address them \nwith the defenders, both individually and as a group. \n \nWith respect to motions practice, at the beginning of the year, Mr. White and I discussed \nthe oft repeated assurances in his reports that the defenders are filing appropriate motions.  \nWhat emerged from our discussion was that Mr. White’s assurances were based not on \nany hard facts but rather on his general impressions of defender practice.  In 2008, I \nasked Mr. White to takes steps to verify the accuracy of his impressions.  In response, \nMr. White has developed a system whereby he identifies potential motions prior to \nattorney assignment and later checks in with the attorney to determine whether the \nsuggested motion was actually filed.  This approach offers not only a way to evaluate \ndefender motion practice but also a mentoring opportunity.  The system has not yet been \nin place long enough to produce any usable data, but I have reviewed numerous case \nassignments that contain notes from Mr. White to defenders about potential motions.  Mr. \nWhite needs to be diligent in following up with the defenders as to whether motions have \nbeen pursued, but overall, I am please with his efforts in this area. \n \nThe last area I asked Mr. White to focus on was limiting his coverage of cases to \nemergency situations.  In the past, Mr. White had spent far too much time in court as the \nprimary coverage option for defenders.  Given his heavy workload, Mr. White and I \nagreed that his time was better spent on other work and that he should only provide \ncoverage as a last resort.  In reviewing case files this quarter, I found that Mr. White was \nstill handling some hearings, but his court appearances did seem to be less frequent.  \nMoreover, when he did provide coverage, his explanations for doing so suggest that it \nwas limited to appropriate situations.   \n \nOverall, Mr. White did not make as much progress in the first quarter as I had hoped.  He \nhandled the unexpected challenges with which he was presented quite well, but he did not \naccord sufficient importance to the more basic aspects of supervision.  Mr. White \nunderstands and agrees that he must give issues such as client contact and investigation \nmore attention in the future.  Accordingly, I fully expect to report substantial \nimprovement in these areas next quarter.   \n \n \nStaffing/Caseloads \n \nThe County began 2008 with a substantially different defender staff than in 2007.  Five of \nits nine defenders joined the program late last year or early this year.  Moreover, one of \n                                                 \n1 I have no doubts about Mr. White’s work ethic.  As I have noted before, his workload and the County’s \nexpectations of him are excessive.  There is simply not enough time available for him to do all that he \nshould, and he sometimes struggles to prioritize his many competing responsibilities.  Moreover, in \naddition to spending time handling a variety of crises during the first quarter, Mr. White was away for a \nweek attending a management training seminar in Kentucky and for another week on a family vacation. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 4 of 13 \n\nthe returning full-time defenders, Mike Aiken, recently suffered a major stroke and will \nbe out indefinitely.  It is my understanding that the County intends to convert its two part-\ntime defenders to full-time and to hire a new defender as well.  Two-thirds of its defender \nstaff will then have been hired in the last six months or so. \n \nAlthough it is difficult for any defender program to handle such a high level of turnover, \nthe overall effect of the staffing changes in Grant County seems to have been positive.  \nMy initial impression of the quality of the new lawyers has been favorable.  There is \ndefinitely much more collegiality among the defender corps.   \n \nThe use of part-time defenders continues to be an issue.  The Settlement Agreement \nrequires the use of full-time defenders except that the County may employ no more than \ntwo part-time defenders with the prior approval of the Monitor. The County hired two \nnew part-time defenders this year without my approval.  Last fall, when I learned that the \nCounty intended to hire part-time defenders for 2008, I urged the County to seek \napproval before moving forward.  The County elected not to seek approval and signed \ncontracts with two part-time defenders.   \n \nSeveral months later, the County changed course and sought approval for the part-time \ndefenders it had already hired.  I requested additional information regarding the \ncandidates, met with the proposed part-time defenders, and sought input from the County \nregarding the need for part-time defenders as opposed to full-time defenders.  As I neared \na decision, the County chose to withdraw one candidate and convert him to full-time and \nasked that I take no action on the other while the County assessed its staffing needs.  Both \nattorneys have received significant case assignments this year as part-time defenders \ndespite not being approved. \n \nIn terms of caseloads, the Settlement Agreement establishes a yearly limit of 150 case \nequivalents per year.  To ensure that case assignments are distributed somewhat evenly \nthroughout the year, the County has adopted additional monthly and quarterly caseload \nlimits.  During the first quarter, the County adhered to its monthly caseload limits with \nrespect to every defender.  In two instances, the County slightly exceeded quarterly \nlimits.  One attorney exceeded his quarterly limit because he was unexpectedly assigned \nto handle child support cases for Mike Aiken.  The second defender exceeded her limit by \nonly a partial case equivalent.   \n \nAt present, four of the six full time defenders are on a pace to exceed annual caseload \nlimits.  It is difficult to assess the significance of this fact so early in the year.   If current \ntrends continue, Supervising Attorney Alan White is projecting a staffing shortfall of 83 \ncase equivalents.  Some but not all of that shortfall can be absorbed by converting \nexisting part-time defenders to full-time.  To handle the remaining cases and provide a \nreasonable caseload cushion, the County will need to hire an additional defender.   \n \nCaseload fluctuations during the year may alter staffing needs up or down, but there are \nat least two reasons to believe that Mr. White’s current caseload projections may be low.  \nFirst, the County’s first quarter figures for contempt cases underestimate the actual \n2008 Quarterly Report - 5 of 13 \n\nnumber of case equivalents worked due to a change in the definition of a contempt case.  \nThis change was instituted unilaterally by the County this year.  Second, most of the \ndefenders did not report their extraordinary hours in time to be included in Alan White’s \nmost recent monthly report.  As a result, the current caseload numbers do not include all \ncredits earned in the first quarter.  \n   \n \nTraining \n \nLocal training opportunities for Grant County defenders are rather limited.  The \nSupervising Attorney occasionally organizes lunch-time trainings on Mondays or \nTuesdays when the defenders are most likely to be in Ephrata for court.  During the first \nquarter, Mr. White arranged one such training, an informational session on Grant County \nMental Health.  The director of that agency gave a presentation regarding the services \navailable and how defenders could help clients gain access to those services.   \n \nMr. White also arranged for the State Office of Public Defense (OPD) to offer a two-hour \ntraining session in Ephrata on misdemeanor appeals.  He solicited the training because \nmost of the felony defenders had been recently assigned to handle RALJ appeals and had \nno appellate experience.  \n \nThe County has also continued to financially support defenders who attend relevant \ntrainings outside of Grant County.  Two defenders recently attended an intensive three \nand a half day workshop on cross-examination in Leavenworth, Washington, conducted \nby Jerry Spence’s Trial Lawyers College.  They report that the seminar was excellent.  In \naddition, the County agreed to send Supervising Attorney Alan White to Kentucky to \nattend a National Legal Aid and Defenders Association training entitled “Nuts and Bolts \nof Supervision and Management.”  Finally, it is my understanding that three of the \nCounty’s defenders have applied to attend the National Criminal Defense College in \nMacon, Georgia this summer.  I am hopeful that one or more of them will have the \nopportunity to attend. \n \nIn the future, I hope that Grant County will also take greater advantage of its own training \nresources.  One of the defenders has suggested that each defender give a lunch-time \ntraining to the group on a topic of his or her choosing.  Such trainings would provide an \nopportunity for the County’s defenders to share their particular knowledge, experiences, \nand expertise with the rest of the group.  \n \n \nFirst Appearances \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that the County provide representation at initial \nappearances for all indigent defendants.  In addition, Supervising Attorney Alan White \nhas adopted a written policy requiring the public defenders to visit in-custody defendants \nprior to their first appearance in court.  Each of the defenders is assigned to cover first \nappearances for a week at a time on a rotating basis throughout the year.  The coverage \n2008 Quarterly Report - 6 of 13 \n\nattorney is required to visit in-custody defendants prior to court in order to obtain the \ninformation necessary to make a bail reduction and/or release motion.   \n   \nDuring the first quarter of 2008, the Grant County defenders consistently made the \nrequired jail visits for the first time during my tenure.  In the past, some defenders have \nbeen quite diligent while others have not.  This quarter, seven different defenders covered \nfirst appearances and each consistently made the required visits.  The number of visits per \nweek ranged from 10 to 25 visits with an average of more than 16 per week. \n \nDefenders have expressed increasing frustration with the burden of handling first \nappearances in addition to their caseloads.   First appearance calendars are heaviest on \nMondays and Tuesdays, the same days defenders have extremely busy schedules \nhandling arraignments and pre-trial hearings for their assigned clients.  It is not \nuncommon to have 10 or more first appearances on a given day.  Defenders are expected \nto visit these defendants in jail, represent them at the initial appearance, and handle all of \ntheir other cases at the same time.  One defender deemed first appearance coverage a \n“nightmare” and described the impact on his other clients as follows: \n \nI want to let everyone know how much this is costing OUR clients.  I have not been \nable to return all of my phone calls.  I have not been able to discuss offers with my \nclients.  I have not been able to work on my cases.  I have not been able to do client \ninterviews.  With the exception of meeting with my own clients on Wednesday, and \nmy own cases from Monday and Tuesday, I have done nothing to help my existing \nclients AT ALL. \n \n \nJail Visits  \n \nGrant County has adopted a written policy on client contact and jail visitation.  The \npolicy requires defenders to make contact with all new clients within five business days \nof receiving the assignment.  For in-custody clients, a jail visit is required.  Meeting with \nthe client in the courtroom or in hallway outside the courtroom is not sufficient.  \nMoreover, the jail visit must take place prior to arraignment “if at all practicable.”  \n \nGrant County’s jail visit policy is not particularly strict or burdensome.  Five business \ndays is ample time to arrange to visit a new client in the jail.  By way of comparison, all \nKing County public defense contracts require a jail visit within one business day of \nassignment.  In terms of logistics, the Grant County jail is located within the same \nbuilding as the court.  An attorney could walk from the courtroom to the jail in less than \n30 seconds.  In most cases, defenders could be meeting with their clients within five \nminutes of leaving the courtroom.   \n \nUnfortunately, in cross-referencing case assignment logs and jail visit records, I found \nthat Grant County defenders were rarely making jail visits as required.  In the cases I \nreviewed, defenders visited their in-custody clients prior to arraignment only 25% of the \ntime.  With the time frame expanded to the full five business days, performance improved \n2008 Quarterly Report - 7 of 13 \n\nsomewhat but still only reached 39% compliance.  Moreover, the percentage of clients \nwho receive prompt visits has steadily decreased over time during the first quarter: \n \n  January 2008  February 2008  March 2008 \nVisit before arraignment  36%  26%  11% \nVisit within 5 business days  56%  37%  21% \n \n \nIt was fairly common during the first quarter for jailed clients to wait two to almost three \nweeks for an attorney visit.  A few cases were particularly egregious.  For example, two \ndifferent defendants had to wait 49 days before receiving a visit from their assigned \nattorney.  In both cases, the initial visit occurred on or after the date originally scheduled \nfor trial.  In a third case involving multiple class A sex offenses, the defendant waited 27 \ndays for a visit.   \n \nSuch delays are completely unacceptable, and the County should not tolerate such \nbehavior.  I have repeatedly urged greater vigilance in ensuring that defenders visit in-\ncustody clients in a timely fashion.  To the best of my knowledge, the County has not \nadopted additional safeguards, monitored jail visits more closely, or taken any action \nagainst defenders who violate the jail visit policy.  Defenders are unlikely to make jail \nvisits a priority unless the County clearly and unequivocally requires them to do so. \n \n \nInvestigation \n \nGrant County currently has four approved public defense investigators.  One investigator \nhas asked to reduce his workload significantly in 2008, and it is my understanding that \nthe County has agreed to accommodate his request.  During the first quarter, several \ndefenders complained that at least two of the County’s investigators seemed overworked \nand were not as prompt as they should be in completing case assignments. Although the \ninvestigators have been instructed to request caseload relief whenever necessary, they \nseem reluctant to do so. \n \nThe Grant County Commissioners recently expressed concern that the County did not \nhave a sufficient number of approved investigators for its public defense program and \nasked that I approve two additional investigators.  I concur in their assessment that more \ninvestigators are needed.  Unfortunately, I was not able to approve the candidates \nsubmitted by the County.  One did not have a private investigator’s license and posed \nconflict of interest issues.  The other was not licensed except through a previously \ndisapproved investigator and indicated he was no longer interested in a position as a \npublic defense investigator.  I have encouraged the County to publicly advertise for \ninvestigators in the future so as to ensure access to a broad pool of qualified applicants. \n \nThe County submitted an additional investigator for approval just last week.  After \nmeeting with him, checking references, and reviewing samples of his work product, I \n2008 Quarterly Report - 8 of 13 \n\napproved Tom Stotts as appropriate for felony defense investigations.  I anticipate that \nthe County will finalize contract terms with him shortly. \n \nDuring the first quarter of 2008, the overall rate of investigation for Grant County felony \ndefenders was 38%.  That figure represents an increase over the rate for both last quarter \nand last year.  Most of the public defenders continue to make regular use of investigators \non their cases.  A few, however, are not requesting investigation very often at all.  As has \nconsistently been the case in prior quarters, the part-time defenders had the lowest rates \nof investigation.  Because these attorneys must balance their public defense work with \nprivate cases, often in other jurisdictions, I suspect that they are not able to devote as \nmuch time to their indigent clients in Grant County as the full-time defenders. \n \nThe rates of investigation by attorney were as follows: \n \n  62%  Full-time defender \n  58%   Full-time defender \n  54%   Full-time defender \n  52%   Full-time defender \n  38%   Full-time defender \n  19%   Full-time defender \n    9%  Part-time defender \n   5%  Part-time defender \n \nThe three attorneys with the lowest investigation rates requested investigation in only 8 \nout of 74 cases.  These rates are particularly troubling in a system such as Grant County’s \nwhere most cases are not resolved until shortly before trial.   In such a back-loaded \nsystem, one would expect relatively higher rates of investigation because of the difficulty \nin determining which cases will go to trial until very late in the process.   \n \nInvestigation is essential to prepare for trial, to allow the client to make informed \ndecisions about plea offers, and to negotiate from a position of strength.  Defenders who \nfail to investigate their cases are gambling that the case will not proceed to trial.  When \nthe hoped for resolution does not materialize, they must either go to trial unprepared, \naccept whatever plea offer is available, or beg for more time to do the investigation that \nshould have already been completed.  Such a practice makes no sense when investigators \nare readily available.   \n \nI have asked Supervising Attorney Alan White to monitor investigation requests more \nclosely and to stress to all defenders the importance of investigation.  At the start of the \nyear, Mr. White met with one of the returning defenders to discuss his investigation rate \nof less than 20% last year.  No doubt as a direct result of that discussion, that defender’s \nrate of investigation increased to 38% this quarter.  I am hopeful that Mr. White will have \nsimilar success with the defenders who had unusually low rates of investigation this \nquarter. \n \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 9 of 13 \n\nClient Complaints \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Supervising Attorney to establish a system to \ntrack and investigate complaints from indigent defendants regarding their assigned \nattorneys.   To satisfy this requirement, Alan White maintains a dedicated telephone line \nfor client complaints.  Calls to the complaint line are logged and dealt with as \nappropriate. \n \nUntil recently, inmates had been unable to leave messages on the complaint line.  As a \nresult, Mr. White’s office received a large number of calls to the complaint line from in-\ncustody defendants whom he was unable to identify and who were unable to report their \ncomplaints.  Sometime in mid-February, however, the County was finally able to \nconfigure the jail phone system to allow inmates to leave messages on the complaint \nline.2  In January and February, prior to this configuration change, Mr. White received 47 \ncalls from inmates who we unable to leave their names or complaints.  Since the jail \nphone system has been adjusted, there have been no further calls of this kind.   \n  \nThe most significant remaining problem with the complaint line is limited voicemail \nspace.  Apparently, a single mentally ill inmate calls repeatedly each month and \nfrequently fills up the answering system’s voicemail capacity.  Once the system reaches \ncapacity, callers are unable to leave a message and instead receive a generic automated \nmessage.  The inmate in question is a district court defendant who has been in custody for \nquite some time and is not expected to be released anytime soon. \n \nAs far as substance, most of the calls to the complaint line this quarter were similar to \nthose in prior quarters and consisted of requests for attorney contact or attempts by \ninmates to get messages to individual defenders.  These calls were not particularly \nremarkable or concerning.  Moreover, I suspect that the volume of calls will decrease \nonce the last few glitches with the jail phone system are resolved and all inmates have \ndirect telephone access to their assigned lawyers.  The complaint line logs should be \nmonitored regularly, however, to determine whether clients of certain defenders are \nresponsible for a disproportionate share of the calls.  Such a pattern could be an early \nindicator of problems.   \n \n \nOverall Quality of Representation \n   \nThe quality of representation in Grant County has improved somewhat but continues to \nbe inconsistent.  In some instances, I have observed work of a very high caliber.  In \nothers, I have reservations about whether basic constitutional standards are being met.  \nOverall, I observed more positive than negative during the first quarter.  Basic issues such \nas investigation and jail visits continue to be an issue, but there has been improvement \n                                                 \n2 It should be noted that one of the Grant County Commissioners personally tested the jail phone system in \nFebruary in order to determine whether it was now possible to leave a message on the complaint line from \nthe jail.  Alan White tested the jail phone system again in March to confirm that inmates could leave \nmessages using both the English and Spanish access codes. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 10 of 13 \n\neven in those areas.  At the same time, some of the defenders seem to be litigating \nmotions and even going to trial more frequently than was the case last year.   These are \nvery positive developments for the program as a whole. \n \nIn reviewing court files this quarter, I found written motions filed by a variety of \ndefenders.  Defenders had filed basic suppression motions, Knapstad motions, and \nmotions to compel discovery.  I found three separate motions filed in a single case.  The \nmotions that I reviewed seemed to raise valid legal issues and the briefs in support were \nreasonably well-written.  My one major concern with respect to motions is the fact that \njust a few defenders seem to be responsible for the vast majority of the motions. \n \nSeveral defenders have also been raising more complex legal issues in preparation for \nupcoming trials in a number of serious cases.  In one three strikes case, defenders \nchallenged whether a prior conviction should count as a strike when the defendant had \nbeen misadvised by prior counsel.  The defenders convinced the court that the challenge \nwas not time barred, but the motion was eventually transferred to the Court of Appeals as \na PRP.  In that same case, counsel have consulted with experts and are preparing to \npresent a diminished capacity defense.  In another case with an imminent trial date, \ndefenders are preparing an insanity defense to rape charges.  In yet another, defenders are \nexploring the legal implications of the police using a Spanish interpreter to elicit \nstatements from a murder defendant whose primary language is actually Mixteco.    \n \nSome of the defenders also took on the recurring problem of obtaining criminal history \ninformation from prosecutors and police.  Access to criminal history has been a point of \ncontention since long before I became Monitor.   Recently one of the defenders began \nmaking a concerted effort to litigate the issue in her cases, filing motions to compel and \nobtaining subpoenas from the court in a large number of cases.  The court eventually \nscheduled a consolidated hearing on the issue, but the parties reached an agreed \nresolution before the matter was heard.   \n \nThe defenders’ zealous advocacy on this issue is an example of what has been missing in \nGrant County.  This was information to which the defenders were obviously entitled but \nwere consistently being denied.  Defenders frequently grumbled about the problem but \ndid little to change the practice.  Finally, through the persistent efforts of one defender, it \nappears some progress has been made on what had been a chronic problem.  The only \ndisappointing aspect of this effort was the fact that so few defenders participated.  All of \nthe defenders and their clients stood to benefit, but most failed to step up and join the \nfight.  As a result, one defender took the brunt of the criticism for the entire group \nincluding a frivolous motion for sanctions filed against her by the prosecutor’s office.   In \nthe future, I hope that the defenders will develop more of a sense of common cause and \nlearn to work together to address such systemic problems. \n  \nIn addition to improved motions practice, the number of trials was also dramatically \nhigher in the first quarter.  There were six trials involving Grant County public defenders, \nfour jury trials and two bench trials.  There were only ten trials all of 2007, so the current \ndefenders are well ahead of last year’s pace.  Two of the jury trials in January were \n2008 Quarterly Report - 11 of 13 \n\nhandled by defenders who have now left the program, but the other four trials involved \ncurrent defenders.  In fact, two of the new defenders have already had jury trials in felony \nassault cases, and both won not guilty verdicts.  A third defender returning from last year \nhad two bench trials this quarter, and she too earned a not guilty verdict in one of them.   \nThe increased number of trials is certainly very promising, and I hope that the current \ngroup will sustain its more aggressive approach.  I also hope that some of the returning \ndefenders will reflect upon their own trial practices as some have not been to trial in over \na year. \n \nWhile there was much to applaud about the quality of representation in the first quarter, \nthere were cases that caused concern as well.  In one case, for example, a Grant County \npublic defender pled a client guilty to his first felony just six days after receiving the \nassignment.  The defendant pled guilty as charged even though he had no prior felony \nhistory, and the statement of probable cause revealed a strong suppression motion.  The \nassigned attorney did not visit the client in jail until the day of the guilty plea.  To be fair, \nthe client was released immediately from custody with credit for time served, so one \ncould argue that this case should be viewed as a success.  Nonetheless, I question whether \nthe defendant could make a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent decision as to relinquish \nhis trial rights and plead guilty when he had only spent perhaps 12 minutes meeting with \nhis attorney on day of the plea.3  \n \nIn another case, a defender signed an agreed order for a competency evaluation without \never having visited the client.  The agreed order allowed the State’s expert to evaluate the \ndefendant not just for competency but also sanity and capacity even though those \ndefenses were not yet at issue in the case.   After the evaluation was completed, the \ndefense stipulated to a 90 day commitment to Eastern State Hospital with advance \nauthorization for the use of forced medications.  Jail records reflect a single jail visit \nbetween the date of the evaluation and the agreed order allowing forced medication; the \nvisit lasted five minutes.    \n \nFinally, I reviewed a forgery case in which the statement of probable cause revealed both \na strong suppression motion and several good trial issues.  The assigned attorney never \npursued a motion to suppress.   Instead, a week before trial, the defendant pled guilty to a \nsingle count of forgery.  His only additional exposure at trial would have been to a \nsecond count, which likely would have been deemed “same criminal conduct” for \nsentencing purposes and should not have affected the sentencing range.  Under the \ncircumstances, there was very little reason not to pursue the suppression motion and if \ndenied, proceed to trial. \n \nIn the first quarter, Grant County public defenders made significant progress in motions \npractice and the number of trials held.  As the above cases illustrate, however, there \nremains room for improvement.  In the future, I hope to see the quality of representation \nbecome more consistent, with all of the defenders making jail visits in a timely fashion, \ninvestigating a reasonable percentage of their cases, litigating motions, and if appropriate, \ngoing to trial.      \n                                                 \n3 The attorney involved visited two clients that morning for a total of 24 minutes.   \n2008 Quarterly Report - 12 of 13 \n\n \n \nConclusion \n \nGrant County public defenders appear to have raised their standard of practice in the first \nquarter.  I am seeing more investigation, more motions, and more trials.  There is now a \ncollegiality among the defenders and a sense of mutual respect between the defenders and \ntheir supervisor which had been missing last year.  \n \nIn the next quarter, I hope to see substantial improvement with respect to jail visits, \ngreater use of investigation by some defenders, and more defenders bringing motions and \ngoing to trial. \n \n \n \n \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 13 of 13 ",

      "text": "Best, et al. v. Grant County \n \nMonitor’s Report \n \nThird Quarter, 2008 \n \nOctober 22, 2008 \n \nSubmitted by Francisco Rodriguez, Settlement Monitor \n \n \nMonitor’s Activities \n \nMy practice as Monitor has been to visit Grant County about once a month.  During the \nthird quarter of this year, I travelled to Ephrata on three separate occasions:   \n \n  July 28, 2008 \n  August 18, 2008 \n  September 2-3, 2008 \n \nWhile in Ephrata, I observed court proceedings, reviewed court files, and met with public \ndefenders.  I also met with investigator candidates in Ephrata, Ellensburg, and Seattle \nduring the third quarter.  Between site visits, I maintain regular contact with supervisor \nAlan White and have periodic contact with individual defenders, investigators, and \ncounsel for both parties.  \n \nIn addition to my regular activities, during the third quarter, I conducted an in depth \nreview of case dockets and court files in order to evaluate defender motions practice, use \nof experts, and case outcomes. \n \n \nAccess to Information \n \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Monitor shall have broad access to \ninformation concerning the Grant County public defense system.  Supervising Attorney \nAlan White and his assistant Aracely Yanez continue to be very cooperative in \nresponding to my requests for information.   The Grant County Superior Court Clerk’s \nOffice is also exceedingly accommodating in providing access to court files.   \n \n \n2007-08 Compliance \n \nI understand that the County has appealed some of my cure recommendations to the court \nbut that the parties are discussing a stipulated resolution of those issues. \n \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 1 of 13 \n\nAttorney Staffing/Caseloads \n \nThe County made one change in its attorney staff during the third quarter.  Defender \nRyan Earl resigned on July 10, creating an opening for a full-time defender.  Because \nCounty employment contracts require three months notice, the County has been able to \ncontinue assigning new cases to Mr. Earl for the entire quarter.  I understand that the \nCounty has agreed not to assign Mr. Earl any cases in the fourth quarter.   \n \nIn order to compensate for the loss of Mr. Earl, the County hired Melissa MacDougall.  \nMs. MacDougall started work in mid-September, allowing her to overlap with Mr. Earl \nfor the month.  This overlap provided the County with an extra month of caseload \ncapacity overall and helped relieve pressure on the system. \n \nThe Settlement Agreement establishes an annual caseload limit of 150 case equivalents.   \nIn addition, the County has adopted monthly and quarterly limits to ensure that case \nassignments are spread relatively evenly throughout the year.  During the third quarter, \nthe County observed both its monthly and quarterly limits for all of its defenders.  \nMoreover, Supervising Attorney Alan White succeeded in distributing case assignments \nin such a way as to put all but one of the County’s defenders back on track to meet annual \ncaseload limits.   \n \nAt this point, only Brian Gwinn is on pace to exceed 150 case equivalents for the year.  \nHis caseload is significantly higher than that of his colleagues because he has handled all \nchild support case assignments for the last six months or so.  He took over the child \nsupport calendar when Mike Aiken became ill and has been the sole attorney covering \nthat calendar ever since.  With Mr. Gwinn fast approaching his annual limit, however, the \nCounty needs to train another defender to cover these calendars for the remainder of the \nyear or risk exceeding caseload limits.  I understand that Supervising Attorney Alan \nWhite is aware of this problem and plans to assign Brett Billingsley to handle the child \nsupport calendar during the fourth quarter.   \n \nCase assignments overall have been lower than average for each of the last four months.  \nThe reduction in assignments has provided a measure of relief to the County’s public \ndefense system.  With the addition of Melissa MacDougall, the County may now have \nsufficient capacity to handle anticipated case assignments through the end of the year, but \nthe County has again left itself little margin for error.   \n \nI estimate that the County has approximately 340 case equivalents available for the \nremainder of 2008.   If the County has three average months (102 case equivalents) this \nquarter, the County would need only 306 case equivalents, leaving a cushion of \napproximately 34 “extra” case equivalents.  I have previously recommended that the \nCounty maintain a minimum cushion of 50 case credits at the start of the 4th quarter.  \nWhile a 34 case cushion is certainly better than none, it does not give the County \nadequate insurance against caseload fluctuations. \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 2 of 13 \n\nThe County must be vigilant in monitoring case assignments as the end of the year \napproaches.  In May, the County assigned its defenders 143 case equivalents.  If case \nassignments increase to anywhere near that level for the last three months of the year, the \nCounty will again face a significant staffing shortfall.  Similarly, increased work on \nextraordinary cases could sap the system of capacity.  For example, I understand that two \ndefenders are currently in trial on a complex attempted murder case with multiple co-\ndefendants.  That case alone could cut significantly into the County’s caseload cushion.  \nAt least one other extraordinary case is expected to go to trial before year’s end.  Because \nof contingencies such as these, the prudent course would be to hire additional staff now to \navoid a desperate scramble in December.   \n \nAfter reviewing caseload numbers and evaluating anticipated case assignments for the \nrest of the year, Supervising Attorney Alan White has recommended temporarily hiring \nan additional attorney to address the potential year-end shortfall.  I support this request.  I \nunderstand, however, that the County is reluctant to hire another attorney at this time.  At \na minimum, the County should be prepared to act quickly if forced to use its caseload \ncapacity more rapidly than anticipated. \n \n \nTraining \n \nTraining opportunities in Grant County are limited.  The County has been supportive of \ndefenders who wish to pursue training outside the County.  In addition, Supervising \nAttorney Alan White has been diligent in obtaining assistance organizing CLE sessions \nfrom the Washington Defender Association and the Washington State Office of Public \nDefense.  Most recently, Mr. White coordinated with me and the Office Public Defense \nto arrange a training session taught by Jeff Ellis, a highly respected private criminal \ndefense attorney from Seattle.  Mr. Ellis addressed both mental health issues and \nsentencing practice in a three hour session.  Alan White should be commended for taking \nthe initiative to arrange this exceptional free training opportunity for the County’s \ndefenders. \n \nAs I have mentioned in past reports, the County should do more “in-house” trainings.  \nDefender offices frequently use lunch meetings as an opportunity to discuss the latest \ncase law, for example.  Similarly, the County is overlooking one of its best resources by \nnot calling upon its defenders to train each other.  Supervising Attorney Alan White \nshould consider asking each defender to lead a training session every month or two.  Such \ntrainings would cost the County nothing and would encourage the defenders to share their \nknowledge and experiences as well as strategize together about common problems and \nissues. \n \n \nFirst Appearances \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that the County provide representation at initial \nappearances for all indigent defendants.  To fulfill this obligation, the County assigns \n2008 Quarterly Report - 3 of 13 \n\neach of its defenders to cover first appearances for a week at a time on a rotating basis \nthroughout the year.   \n \nThe defenders generally loathe first appearance duty.  Some even pay colleagues to take \ntheir coverage weeks.  There are several reasons for their aversion to this assignment.  \nFirst, the defenders feel that they are required to invest a significant amount of time and \neffort into an assignment for which they are not separately compensated.  Second, \nwithout a meaningful opportunity to review police reports, without access to criminal and \nFTA history, and without sufficient time to verify client addresses, employment, etc., \nrepresenting clients at first appearance is extraordinarily frustrating.  This is particularly \ntrue when defenders know that if they make a bail argument at first appearance based on \nthe scant information available to them, the arraignment judge will not allow them to \naddress bail again, regardless of whether they have new information or there has been a \nchange in circumstances.  Finally, defenders are frequently overwhelmed on Mondays \nand Tuesdays, the days that consistently have the largest number of first appearances, \nbecause in addition to covering those hearings, the defenders typically have a full load of \ntheir own cases on the calendar. \n \nDespite their disdain for the assignment, the Grant County defenders generally do a good \njob representing defendants at first appearance.  They seem to have met with their clients \nin advance, prepared for a bail argument, and reviewed the probable cause statement in \nadvance of the hearing when available.   \n \nPast problems with providing representation to out-of-custody defendants and child \nsupport defendants appear to have been resolved.  I did not observe any defendants go \nunrepresented during the third quarter.  To the contrary, on at least a couple of occasions, \nI have seen public defenders jump in to assist defendants whose cases the prosecutor has \ncalled despite the absence of counsel.  Although Alan White has written to both the \njudges and the prosecutors, I continue to see prosecutors attempting to proceed with cases \nin the absence of counsel.  In one instance, when a defender intervened to assist the \ndefendant, the prosecutor openly complained about the pubic defenders providing \nrepresentation to out-of-custody defendants, apparently upset that such representation \nslows the calendar down. \n \nIn addition to representing defendants in court, the coverage attorney is expected to meet \nwith in-custody defendants prior to court in order to obtain the information necessary to \nmake a bail reduction and/or release motion.  County policy used to require a visit in the \njail prior to first appearance.  In May, Supervising Attorney Alan White revised the \npolicy to require a meeting with the client rather than a jail visit.  Accordingly, I did not \nconduct a detailed analysis of first appearance visits during the third quarter.  A brief \nreview of the jail visitation logs suggests that despite the change in policy, most \ndefenders continue to meet with defendants in the jail prior to first appearance.  \n \n \n \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 4 of 13 \n\nJail Visits  \n \nGrant County requires its defenders to make contact with all new clients within a week of \nassignment.  For in-custody clients, a jail visit is required.  The County’s written policy \non client contact makes clear that meeting with the client in the courtroom or in hallway \noutside the courtroom is not sufficient.  Moreover, the jail visit must take place prior to \narraignment “if at all practicable.”  \n \nTimely jail visits have been an ongoing problem in Grant County.  Despite the County’s \nclear policy and repeated efforts by both Alan White and myself to emphasize the \nimportance of the initial jail visit, some defenders have simply not made visiting their in-\ncustody clients a priority.  As in previous quarters, I found numerous cases in which \ninmates had to wait lengthy periods of time before receiving a visit from their assigned \nattorneys.  Some never received a visit at all. \n \nI reviewed 68 in-custody cases assigned from July through September of this year and \nfound that the Grant County defenders visited their clients on or before the day of \narraignment only about 38% of the time.  Approximately 50% of those visits occurred on \nthe day of arraignment.1  Within a week of assignment, the defenders as a group had \nvisited about 65% of their in-custody clients.  Though these figures represent an \nimprovement over last quarter, they remain too low.  In particular, all defenders need to \nimprove their efforts to meet with clients prior to arraignment.   \n \nMost defenders did visit their clients within a week of assignment during the third \nquarter.  John Perry, Janelle Peterson, Mike Prince, Mike Haas, and Melissa MacDougall \nall visited 100% of their clients within a week of receiving the assignment.2  Others \nvisited most but not all of their clients within a week.   \n \nTwo defenders, Brett Billingsley and Ryan Earl, were particularly unlikely to make \ntimely jail visits.3  Of his 7 in-custody clients, Mr. Billingsley did not visit any of them \nprior to arraignment.  He visited only 1 within a week.  Of his 12 in-custody clients, Mr. \nEarl visited only 1 prior to arraignment and none of his other 10 in-custody clients \nreceived a visit within a week of assignment.  Removing these two attorneys from the \ncalculation, the remaining defenders combined visited 88% of their clients within a week \nof assignment. \n \nWith respect to the untimely visits, the length of the delay varied, but there were 11 \ninstances in which in-custody defendants waited approximately two weeks or more \nbefore receiving a visit from their assigned attorneys.  One waited 27 days to meet with \n                                                \n1 For the visits which occur on the day of arraignment, it is difficult to determine whether the visit actually \noccurred prior to arraignment as required by County policy, but for purposes of this analysis, I have \nassumed all such visits occurred before arraignment. \n2 On cases assigned around the Labor Day holiday, I treated visits within 8 days as within a week. \n3 In past reports, I have generally not identified defenders by name.  Although my intent was to avoid \nsingling out individual defenders for criticism, the defenders apparently felt that the ambiguity ended up \nunfairly directing criticism at the whole group.  Accordingly, at the request of the defenders, I have \nidentified the relevant defenders when discussing attorney performance in this report. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 5 of 13 \n\nhis attorney.  Four inmates had not received a visit at all as of the end of the third quarter.  \nIn addition to those 11 inmates, I found an additional three in-custody defendants who \npled guilty without ever having received a visit from their assigned attorneys.  In one \ncase, the client pled guilty at arraignment, but even when arraignment was set over one \nday, presumably because the client had expressed a desire to plead guilty, his attorney did \nnot visit him in jail.  With a client contemplating pleading guilty to a felony at \narraignment, the failure to visit him for a meaningful, private, attorney-client consultation \nis inexcusable.  Effective assistance of counsel requires more than the opportunity for a \nwhispered exchange with your attorney while sitting in the jury box or a brief \nconversation standing around in a hallway while your attorney is between court \nappearances.  This type of hallway justice is not the standard I presume the County is \nstriving for. \n \nThe County must make timely jail visits a priority.  The County should expect its \ndefenders to visit their clients immediately upon assignment.  The vast majority of visits \nshould occur before arraignment, and visits should never occur more than 7 days after \nassignment.  Grant County already has a policy in place that clearly addresses this issue.  \nUnless that policy is enforced, however, it represents little more than an empty gesture.  \nThe County should adopt a disciplinary structure of some kind with formal warnings, \nreprimands, probation and the like.  Such measures would help convey to the defenders \nhow seriously the County takes its policies. \n \n \nInvestigator Staffing \n \nGrant County again experienced turnover in its investigation staff.  Longtime investigator \nMike Lewton unexpectedly passed away in mid-September.  He had been working \nvirtually full-time on Grant County public defense cases and was one of the County’s two \nprimary investigators, so his departure left quite a vacuum.   Fortunately, the County had \nalready been in the process of securing additional investigators.  At the County’s request, \nI approved Kathleen Kennedy, Allison Taylor, Win Taylor, and Mario Torres during the \nthird quarter.  I understand that Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Torres have agreed to contract \nterms with the County and are already receiving cases.  I hope that the County is also able \nto secure the services Allison Taylor and Win Taylor in the near future as they seemed \nhighly qualified. \n \nThe defenders seem very pleased with the quality of the work from existing investigators \nMarv Scott, Ellyn Berg, and Jim Patterson.  Assuming the new investigators are able to \nlive up to expectations, it appears that the County has an excellent group of investigators \navailable to its defenders.  The only concern I have regarding investigation is that good \ninvestigators are in high demand and sometimes end up taking on too much work, \nresulting in delays on individual cases.  During the third quarter, some defenders \nexpressed concerns about the timeliness of work performed by one of the investigators.  \nSupervising Attorney Alan White is aware of the issue and has discussed the matter with \nthe investigator in question.  \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 6 of 13 \n\nLast quarter’s controversy over investigator billing has apparently been resolved.  After \nreviewing the issue more carefully, Supervising Attorney Alan White reconsidered his \nposition and agreed to submit un-redacted investigator billing to the County.  Although I \nagree with Mr. White’s original position rather than his current one, there is certainly \nroom for debate on this issue.  In practical terms, Mr. White’s change of course has \nallowed the investigators to continue working and getting paid and thus averted what had \nbeen developing into a serious crisis. \n \n \nInvestigation Rates \n \nFor 2008, the overall rate of investigation has been 37%.  The rate of investigation is now \nup slightly from last year.  The rate for the third quarter was higher than in previous \nquarters.  As in the past, most defenders appear to make appropriate use of investigators \non their cases.   \n \nLast quarter, I noted that two of the current defenders had investigation rates that were \nwell below the norm.  One of those defenders improved his rate of investigation \nsignificantly in the third quarter.  The other, Ryan Earl, continues to investigate very few \ncases.  His investigation rate for the year is about half of the average for the other \ndefenders.  His low rate of investigation this quarter is particularly concerning in light of \nthe fact that Supervising Attorney Alan White met with him and urged him to increase \nhis use of investigators.  Mr. Earl appears to be maintaining an active private practice, \nincluding numerous cases in King County.4  Given his failure to visit in-custody clients \nand his low rate of investigation, it is possible that his private cases are interfering with \nhis public defense work in Grant County. \n \n \nExperts \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that public defenders request experts via ex parte \nmotion and that the records relating to experts be sealed.  The Settlement Agreement \nfurther specifically provides that “[u]nder no circumstances may members of the Grant \nCounty Prosecuting Attorney’s Office be given access to motions for the appointment of \nexperts or to invoices submitted by experts to the County for payment.” \n \nDuring the third quarter, I reviewed dockets for every felony case assigned to Grant \nCounty public defenders during 2008.5  Among the issues I examined was the use of \nexperts.  A request for the appointment of an expert at public defense will be reflected on \nthe docket even if made ex parte and even if the actual motion papers are sealed in the \ncourt file.  GR 15(c)(5)(A).  Based upon my review of over 550 felony case assignments, \nonly four attorneys have requested experts on cases assigned this year:  Karen Lindholdt, \n                                                \n4 Mr. Earl has refused to submit reports detailing his work on private cases.  As a result, information \nregarding his private cases comes from the Washington Courts website. \n5 For most cases in which the docket reflected the use of an expert or filing of a written motion, I also \nreviewed the court file.   \n2008 Quarterly Report - 7 of 13 \n\nJanelle Peterson, John Perry, and Julie St. Marie.  Those attorneys have requested experts \nin a total of 10 cases, with the bulk of the requests made by Ms. Lindholdt and Ms. \nPeterson.6    \n \nAlthough the actual use of experts may be indicative of good defense practice, the \nconverse is not necessarily true.  It is certainly possible that some defenders simply did \nnot receive a case assignment in which an expert was needed.  My hesitation in giving the \ndefenders the benefit of the doubt in this area is the number of cases I found involving \nmental health issues in which the assigned attorneys did not seek appointment of a \ndefense expert.  In my review of felony cases assigned in 2008, I found at least 7 cases in \nwhich five different defenders raised mental health issues but failed to seek appointment \nof a defense expert.  It appears to be routine practice for some defenders to simply ask \nthat their clients be sent to Eastern State Hospital whenever mental health concerns arise.  \nThe defenders then rely on the conclusion of the State’s expert as to competency and as \nto whether a valid mental defense exists.  While it is certainly possible that a defense \nexpert would reach the same conclusion as the state’s expert(s) in these cases, the failure \nto at least consult with a defense expert is troubling.  I am hopeful that the recent training \non mental health issues will improve the overall practice in this area. \n \nI am concerned that several expert requests made during the third quarter were not sealed, \nand at least one request was not made ex parte.  I understand that one or more of the \nGrant County Superior Court judges has questioned the propriety of hearing such \nrequests ex parte and placing the supporting documents under seal.  It is not clear from \nthe court files, however, whether defense motions to proceed ex parte and motions to seal \nare being denied or are simply not being made.  Accordingly, I recommend that the \nCounty develop standard forms for its defenders to use in order to ensure that when \nappropriate, expert requests are properly sealed in the court file. \n \n \nMotions Practice \n \nMotions practice was another issue on which I focused in my review of dockets and court \nfiles for 2008.  Overall, I found 38 cases in which Grant County defenders had filed \nsubstantive motions.7  In several cases, defenders had filed more than one brief.  It \nappears that there has been a substantial improvement in motions practice since last \nquarter.  Briefs in 21 of the 38 cases had been filed since July 1.  \n \nJust three attorneys have accounted for a disproportionate share of the motions filed.   \nKaren Lindholdt, Janelle Peterson, and Julie St. Marie have filed motions in 26 cases and \nare responsible for 68% of the motions filed.  Both John Perry and Melissa MacDougall \n                                                \n6 This total only reflects expert requests in cases assigned this year.  In addition, I found two expert requests \nsubmitted by Janelle Peterson in 2008 for cases assigned last year. \n7 For purposes of this analysis, I defined substantive motions as any written motion to suppress pursuant to \nCrR 3.5 or CrR 3.6, any written Knapstad motion, and any written brief that contained substantive legal \nanalysis tailored to a particular case.  I did not include motions for discovery, motions for depositions, \nmotions for release, or motions in limine as those were typically either stock briefs or not particularly \nsubstantive. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 8 of 13 \n\nhave already filed multiple substantive motions even though they have only recently \njoined the program.  The remaining defenders8 have each filed a few substantive motions, \nexcept for Brett Billingsley, who has filed none.  While it is certainly possible that some \nattorneys happen to have cases with more legal issues than others, I think it more likely \nthat the attorneys who file more motions tend to take a more aggressive approach to their \ncases generally and are more creative in finding issues to litigate. \n \nIn addition to briefs on more substantive legal issues, I found numerous other examples \nof motions practice including written motions to compel discovery, motions to depose \nwitnesses, motions for furlough, and motions for release/bail reduction.  Although these \nmotions typically involve less substantive legal analysis than the motions identified \nabove, such motions are nonetheless an essential part of criminal practice.  Many of the \ndefenders filed motions that would fall into this category, but Janelle Peterson and Julie \nSt. Marie did so most often.  Ms. Peterson has been particularly aggressive in litigating \ndiscovery issues, and Ms. St. Marie frequently files written release motions.    \n \nOverall, I was impressed by the motions practice of Ms. Lindholdt, Ms. Peterson, and \nMs. St. Marie.  I was also impressed by the work of Mr. Perry and Ms. MacDougall given \nthat they have been practicing in Grant County a relatively short time.  At the same time, \nI have concerns about whether the remaining defenders are always filing motions when \nappropriate.  I feel that I need more data, however, to reach any firm conclusions.  \nAccordingly, I plan to continue to closely monitor motions practice to determine whether \nexisting patterns continue over time.  In addition, I plan to ask the Supervising Attorney \nto work with these defenders to help them develop a more robust motions practice. \n \n \nOverall Quality of Representation \n   \nOver the past year, Grant County has taken a number of positive steps toward improving \nthe quality of its public defense program.  The County no longer employs part-time \ndefenders, for example, and has made a number of good hiring decisions.  As a result, the \nCounty now has a core group of defenders who are more than capable of providing \neffective assistance of counsel.   Outside of that core group, however, defenders are not \nmaking timely jail visits and do not appear to be filing motions or requesting experts as \noften as they should.   \n \nThe Grant County defenders can be roughly divided into two groups, those who \naggressively litigate their cases and those who prefer to focus almost exclusively on plea \nnegotiations and maintaining good relationships with the prosecutors.9  What the \ndefenders in this second group do not seem to appreciate, however, is that the two \nphilosophies are not mutually exclusive.  An aggressive motions practice, consultation \nwith experts, and thorough investigation do not necessarily undermine plea negotiations \n                                                \n8 None of my comments apply to Brian Gwinn.  For most of the year, his practice has been focused \nexclusively on child support cases which were not the subject of this analysis. \n9 This is admittedly an oversimplification.  The differences among the defenders are far from categorical.  \nThe “negotiators” do occasionally file motions, and the “litigators” end up negotiating most of their cases.   \n2008 Quarterly Report - 9 of 13 \n\nor alienate prosecutors.    To the contrary, these practices often facilitate plea negotiations \non terms more favorable to the defendant than would otherwise be offered.  \n \nData on case outcomes in Grant County bears this out.  In the cases in which Grant \nCounty defenders filed motions, they obtained a favorable outcome (misdemeanor or \ndismissal)10 58% of the time compared to only 34% for cases overall.11  Similarly, \nlooking at all case outcomes regardless of whether motions were filed, the likelihood of a \nfelony conviction was higher for clients of the defenders who were less litigious.  I \nreviewed 311 cases assigned in 2008 that had been resolved by early October.  \nComparing outcomes, I found that the clients of the defenders who tended to file motions, \nrequest experts, and investigate cases more frequently were convicted of a felony only \n56% of the time.  Clients of the remaining defenders were convicted of a felony 72% of \nthe time.  \n \nPublic defenders benefit their clients when they raise legal issues, explore factual and \nlegal defenses, and zealously advocate on behalf of their clients.   Grant County has \ndefenders on staff who appreciate this fundamental notion and whose practices reflect \nthat.  Going forward, the County’s goal should be to convince all of its defenders to \nembrace this approach. \n \n \nSupervising Attorney \n \nThe County recently decided to bring the supervisor position “in house,” making the \nSupervising Attorney a County employee rather than a contractor.   The position has \nalready been formally posted, and I understand that the County anticipates having outside \napplicants.  After filling the supervisor position, the County plans to further restructure its \npublic defense program by bringing approximately half of its defenders in house.  The \nSupervising Attorney will assist in designing the new hybrid system.  The County will \nthen submit the resulting plan to the Monitor for approval prior to implementation. \n \nAlthough I understand that the County will be considering other applicants for the \nposition, I continue to support Alan White as Supervising Attorney at this time.  I know \nof no other attorney locally who is better suited to the position than Alan White.  \nAlthough applicants from outside the County may or may not be more qualified, I \nquestion whether the County can rely on such candidates to stay long term.  Alan White \nis clearly committed to the success of the Grant County public defense program and has \nhelped to build a more organized, structured defender over the last year.   \n                                                \n10 Obviously, focusing purely on felony conviction versus non-felony outcomes does not tell the full story.  \nA felony conviction may very well be a good outcome for a defendant who had been facing more serious \nfelony charges or who obtains a favorable sentencing recommendation.  Assessing felony outcomes, \nhowever, is not possible based solely on dockets.  For that reason, I have used the felony versus non-felony \ndistinction as a rough measure of success. \n11 The higher rate of favorable outcomes may be the result of substantive problems with the cases \nthemselves rather than the filing of a motion detailing those problems.  In other words, the plea offer or \ndismissal may be based on proof problems that had already been or would have been identified by the \nprosecutor regardless of whether a motion was ever filed. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 10 of 13 \n\n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Monitor to oversee and evaluate the performance \nof the Supervising Attorney.   Approximately a year ago, I asked the defenders to \ncomplete a written evaluation of Alan White.  I also asked Mr. White to evaluate his own \nperformance using the same evaluation form as the defenders.  Assuming he is selected \nfor the in-house position, I plan to repeat the evaluation process during the fourth quarter \nof this year.  Comparing this year’s results to last year’s should provide a good measure \nof Mr. White’s development as a supervisor while also helping identify areas for \nimprovement in the future.  I expect the defenders to give Mr. White positive reviews \noverall.   \n \nMy own impression is that Mr. White has become a better supervisor over the last year.  \nHe has always been very supportive of and loyal to the defenders he supervises, \nsometimes to a fault.  In recent months, however, he has become much more willing to \nassert his authority over the defenders when necessary.  While enforcing discipline \nclearly does not come naturally to Mr. White, he seems to have recognized that it is an \nimportant part of his role.  He has also demonstrated greater independence from the \nCounty, voicing his concerns regarding staffing needs and hiring authority even when he \nknew his views were not likely to be well received by his employers. \n \nUnfortunately, Mr. White has not made as much progress in monitoring attorney \nperformance as he has in other areas.  Although I have repeatedly stressed the need for \ngreater scrutiny of defender jail visits, investigation rates, and motions practice, Mr. \nWhite has not made these issues a priority.  He has occasionally initiated efforts to \nevaluate attorney performance in these areas, but he seems to quickly lose steam.  The \nthird quarter was no exception.  To his credit, Mr. White analyzed jail visits and \ninvestigation rates for the month of July and counseled defenders who needed \nimprovement.  He did not, however, repeat the process for August or September.  As a \nresult, he was unaware of the ongoing problems with some defenders detailed above.  \nSimilarly, after many months, Mr. White still has not followed through on his plans to \nmonitor motions practice.  In all of these areas, Mr. White has been forced to rely on my \nfindings in order to learn about issues and potential problems within his own program.   \n \nMr. White reports that due to the time he spent this quarter interviewing attorney and \ninvestigator applicants, dealing with case re-assignments resulting from the death of Mike \nLewton, handling tasks related to the Best litigation, and attending to his own health \nconcerns, he was not able to devote sufficient time to monitoring attorney performance.  \nAlthough Mr. White’s failure to attend to these problems is extremely frustrating, it is not \nuncommon for both public defenders and their supervisors to be so overwhelmed with \ntheir day-to-day responsibilities that they are unable to focus on larger issues.  Because \nsystemic issues rarely seem to need immediate attention, they are easily postponed and \nforgotten.   \n \nMr. White simply needs to give issues such as jail visits and investigation rates more \nattention.  He needs to monitor attorney performance monthly and counsel attorneys who \nare not complying with County policy.  For attorneys who demonstrate a problematic \n2008 Quarterly Report - 11 of 13 \n\npattern over time, Mr. White should consider disciplinary action.  In order to ensure that \nMr. White gives these issues the requisite attention, I suggest that the County ask him to \nspecifically address them in his monthly reports to the Board of County Commissioners.  \nAt some point, however, the County should be able to rely on its Supervising Attorney to \nidentify and address problems within the public defender program on his own initiative.  \nMy continued support of Mr. White is contingent on his demonstrating the capacity to do \njust that during the fourth quarter. \n \n \nClient Complaints \n \nAlan White maintains a toll-free telephone line for client complaints.  Instructions on \nhow to contact Mr. White to make a complaint are posted in several locations at the jail \nand included in a flyer distributed to out-of-custody defendants at arraignment.12  Calls to \nthe complaint line are logged by Mr. White’s assistant and referred to Mr. White or the \nassigned defender for follow-up.  Many calls to the complaint line are not complaints at \nall.  Defendants often call with requests for information or messages for their assigned \nattorneys.   When complaints are more substantive, Mr. White investigates the matter, \nincluding visiting the defendant at the jail if necessary, and occasionally writes formal \nreports to the County detailing the results of his investigation.   \n \nMost calls to the complaint line relate to attorney-client contact.  In the third quarter, the \nCounty appears to have again experienced problems relating to the jail phone system as a \nlarge number of inmates called to complain that they could not reach their assigned \nattorneys.  In his August report, Mr. White noted that two attorneys, Mike Haas and Julie \nSt. Marie, had their phone lines disconnected for some period of time.13  Calls to the \ncomplaint line, however, suggest that there may have been problems reaching other \nattorneys as well.14   \n \nI understand that several of the attorneys have experienced a substantial increase in the \ncost per call to their toll-free lines, leading some to switch carriers and at least one to \ndisconnect his service.  As I have indicated previously, it is essential that inmates be able \nto reach their assigned attorneys by phone.  Moreover, the Settlement Agreement \nspecifically requires that each defender maintain a phone system that allows inmates to \nleave messages.  The County should investigate any reports of problems with the jail \nphone system or the defenders’ toll free lines immediately and if the problem is \nconfirmed, the County should take corrective action as soon as possible. \n \n \n \n                                                \n12 Based upon my observations during site visits, actual distribution of the flyers seems to be inconsistent.   \n13 As of October 20, 2008, Mr. Haas line had still not been re-connected.  Mr. White’s monthly report \nerroneously reported that all defender lines were working in September. \n14 Mr. White’s test on October 21, 2008 indicated that Ryan Earl’s toll free line was no longer working.  It \nis unclear how long it has been out of service. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 12 of 13 \n\nDuring the third quarter, calls to the complaint line generally fell into the following \ncategories: \n   \n# Calls  Nature of call \n29  Request for attorney contact/visit \n24  Problems reaching assigned attorney \n17  Trying to contact attorney/request for attorney contact information \n11  Request to speak or meet with Alan White/Alan White took call \n10  Question about case \n9  Message for assigned attorney \n6  Request for name of assigned attorney \n6  Substantive Complaint \n3  Request for a new attorney \n \nSome of the calls fell into more than one category.  In addition, many clients called more \nthan once with the same or similar complaints.   \n \nAs I mentioned in my last report, the current system does not allow me to effectively \nmonitor the more substantive complaints.  Those are typically handled directly by Alan \nWhite, and the complaint line log does not always reflect the substance of his phone calls \nor meetings with inmates.  I have requested copies of any written reports he has \ncompleted this year as well as any other written records he maintains regarding these \ncomplaints.  If none currently exist, I plan to ask Mr. White to keep a personal log to \ntrack his own calls and jail visits relating to client complaints. \n \n \nConflicts of Interest \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires both the Supervising Attorney and each defender to \nhave a conflicts-check system.  These procedures must be approved by the Monitor.  \nDuring the third quarter, I reviewed and approved conflicts check procedures for Alan \nWhite as well as defenders Brian Gwinn, Mike Haas, Karen Lindholdt, John Perry, and \nJulie St. Marie.  Mr. White recently submitted the procedures of Mike Prince and Janelle \nPeterson for approval.  I have not received conflicts check procedures for Brett \nBillingsley, Ryan Earl, or Melissa MacDougall.  \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThe County’s decision to restructure its public defense program will undoubtedly bring \nmany challenges in the coming months.  Chief among them will be retaining the \nCounty’s best defenders who are already apprehensive about what this transition means \nfor them.  I have urged the County to involve the defenders themselves in the process as \nmuch as possible to avoid any misunderstandings and unnecessary anxiety.  It is my hope \nthat the County will treat the defenders as partners in this endeavor. \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 13 of 13 ",

This access expressly includes “the \nright to interview all persons with knowledge about the public defense system.” To \nfacilitate access to information, Grant County must “require the Supervising Attorney and \npublic defenders to cooperate fully with the Monitor and promptly to provide all \ninformation (excluding privileged communications and work product) requested by the \nMonitor.” \n \nWhile Grant County freely provides basic data regarding its public defense program, I \nfrequently encounter resistance when I attempt to probe more deeply.  During the second \nquarter, for example, Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales directed public defender \nJanelle Peterson not to speak to me regarding her complaint against a prosecutor that had \nled to re-assignment of 10-15 of her cases.  When I pointed out to Mr. Gonzales that \nprohibiting Ms. Peterson from speaking with me was a violation of the Settlement \nAgreement, he immediately changed course and agreed to allow her to speak with me.   \n \nPrior problems with application of public disclosure standards to information provided \nunder the Settlement Agreement recurred during the second quarter.  After receiving \nGrant County’s monthly report information for May, I was advised that the Grant \n2009 Quarterly Report - 1 of 19 \n\nCounty’s public records officer had raised objections about some of the information sent \nto me.  While I have no need for the particular information in question, I continue to be \nconcerned generally about Grant County restricting the flow of information based upon \npublic disclosure principles that have no application in this context.  Counsel for Grant \nCounty Francis Floyd has repeatedly assured me in the past that he had resolved this \nproblem, but that does not appear to be the case. \n \n \nApproval of In-House Program \n \nGrant County opened an in-house public defense office on March 2, 2009, prior to the \nexpiration of the required 90-day waiting period and prior to receiving Monitor approval \nof its plans.  On April 3, 2009, I disapproved Grant County’s proposed in-house public \ndefense program due to, among other issues, salary disparities with Grant County \nprosecutors, conflict of interest concerns, and the lack of a proven ability to administer \nthe system.  On April 17, 2009, the parties reached an agreement under which Grant \nCounty was to obtain Monitor approval of its in-house public defense program by May \n28, 2009.   \n \nOver the next six weeks, Grant County made substantial progress in addressing the \nconcerns I had identified in my April 3rd letter.  While I continued to have concerns \nabout the management of the in-house program, I did not feel the remaining issues \nwarranted withholding approval.  Accordingly, on May 28, 2009, I approved the \nfollowing changes in the form of the Grant County public defense system: \n \n1.  The Supervising Attorney is now a Grant County employee; \n2.  Five public defenders are now Grant County employees; and \n3.  One investigator is now a Grant County employee. \n \nCounsel Francis Floyd and the Grant County Board of County Commissioners devoted \nconsiderable effort to obtaining approval, and it was their commitment to the process that \nultimately made the difference.  I would be remiss if I did not also specifically note the \nsubstantial contributions of June Strickler, Administrative Services Coordinator to the \nBoard of County Commissioners, who was instrumental to Grant County’s efforts to \nobtain approval.   \n \n \nAttorney Staffing \n \nGrant County continues to experience a very high rate of turnover among its public \ndefenders.  One of its newly hired in-house public defenders, Frank Grigaliunas, has \nalready resigned after only three months with Grant County.  His last day was June 12.  \nIn addition, Karen Lindholdt, who had resigned at the end of last quarter, negotiated an \nearly release from her contract and has now completed her work with Grant County. \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 2 of 19 \n\nSeveral new defenders started with Grant County this quarter.  Kacie Maggard joined the \nGrant County Department of Public Defense on April 1.  Because she has limited \ncriminal experience, she has been assigned to handle the child support docket full-time.  \nIn May, Grant County hired John Doherty, an experienced criminal attorney from \nTacoma, to join the in-house program.  Because Mr. Doherty is still winding down his \nprivate practice, I approved a transition plan placing him on a reduced caseload for the \nfirst several months.  Grant County also recently retained a new contract attorney, Robert \nKentner, to take over Ms. Lindholdt’s contract for the balance of the year.  Grant County \nhas attempted to fill Mr. Grigaliunas’ in-house position but has been unsuccessful thus \nfar.   \n \nGrant County is likely to lose yet another defender in the near future as Janelle Peterson \nmay be seeking an early release from her contract. Ms. Peterson has filed a complaint \nover an incident in which she felt physically threatened by a Grant County prosecutor and \nhas engaged an attorney to represent her.  Her attorney recently wrote to Grant County \nthat Ms. Peterson’s fear of this prosecutor is such that she is “not able to zealously \nadvocate on behalf of her clients.”  Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales has responded \ninsisting that Ms. Peterson comply with the terms of her contract or be involuntarily \nterminated.   \n \nThe current situation is an untenable one for Ms. Peterson’s clients.  For the last several \nweeks, Ms. Peterson has asked other attorneys to cover and continue many of her \nhearings so as to avoid having to be present in court with the prosecutor in question.  Her \nfear seems genuine, and her attorney has made clear that the quality of her representation \nis suffering.  While Mr. Gonzales’ suggestion that Ms. Peterson simply honor her \ncontract may make sense from a staffing perspective, it ignores the consequences to her \nclients whose representation may now be compromised.  If Ms. Peterson cannot provide \neffective representation, for any reason, Grant County has an obligation to provide her \nclients with new counsel.  No doubt Grant County and Ms. Peterson will continue to \ndiscuss the terms of her departure, but regardless of how those issues are resolved, it \nseems clear at this point that her departure is imminent, and Grant County should prepare \naccordingly.   \n \nThe high level of staff turnover in Grant County is not conducive to establishing a quality \npublic defense system.  Recruiting and retaining skilled personnel is essential to long \nterm success and stability.  Ms. Peterson is currently the longest tenured public defender \nin Grant County.  With her departure, five of the eight defenders will have started work \nthis year.  Moreover, Ms. Peterson has consistently been among the most diligent \ndefenders in visiting her clients in jail, investigating her cases, and litigating motions.  \nHer work on behalf of her clients has reflected very well on Grant County, and her \ndeparture will be yet another serious blow to public defense there.  \n \nI continue to strongly recommend that Grant County negotiate contract extensions with \nthe remaining contract defenders so as to avoid further turnover.  While my prior \nadmonitions have been ignored, I remain hopeful that Grant County will recognize the \n2009 Quarterly Report - 3 of 19 \n\nimportance of retaining quality defenders and act to extend their contracts before it is too \nlate. \n \n \nCaseloads \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires Grant County to limit annual caseloads to 150 case \nequivalents for each attorney.   Grant County has also adopted monthly and quarterly \nlimits to protect against excessive short-term workloads and to ensure its defenders do \nnot reach annual caseload limits too early in the year.  While each attorney should receive \napproximately 12.5 cases per month and 37.5 cases per quarter, the monthly and quarterly \nlimits adopted by Grant County are somewhat higher than that at 16 case equivalents per \nmonth and 40 per quarter.  These higher limits allow Grant County flexibility in handling \nfluctuations in assignments from the court. \n \nOverall, the caseload outlook in Grant County is positive.  During the second quarter, \nfelony case assignments continued to come in at a lower rate than last year, so most \ndefenders were well below monthly and quarterly limits.  There were, however, \nsignificant administrative problems with case assignments and reassignments in June that \nresulted in cases not being accurately tracked and/or counted.   Sorting out the \ndiscrepancies in assignment records and correcting the errors was quite a challenge.   \n \nAfter reconciling all the case assignment data, I found that two defenders exceeded their \nmonthly caseload limits for June.  Dean Terrillion’s monthly caseload for June was 18.66 \ncase equivalents.  Mr. Terrillion’s caseload was even higher before several cases were \ntransferred to other attorneys late in the month.  Similarly John Doherty had exceeded his \napproved monthly caseload for June until a number of his cases were transferred to other \nattorneys in late June and early July.   \n \nThe high caseloads in June were due in part to a large number of cases that had to be re-\nassigned from other defenders.  Almost 40 cases were reassigned as a result of the \nresignation of Frank Grigaliunas and Janelle Peterson’s conflict with one of the \nprosecutors.   Because the re-assigned cases were not tracked in any systematic way, they \nwere not properly credited to the newly assigned attorneys.  Moreover, with Mr. \nGrigaliunas gone and Ms. Lindholdt winding down, Grant County was essentially down \ntwo attorneys for most of June.   \n \nManaging the large number of reassignments was challenging, but Supervising Attorney \nRay Gonzales should have monitored case assignments and reassignments more closely \nand recognized that several attorneys were approaching their June caseload limits before \nthose limits had been exceeded.  Brett Billingsley, John Perry, and Julie St. Marie all had \nroom under their monthly limits at the end of June and could have absorbed the extra \ncases.  Moreover, while I agree with the decision to avoid assigning cases to Ms. \nLindholdt during her last month, she could easily have handled one or more of the \n2009 Quarterly Report - 4 of 19 \n\nprobation violation calendars instead of Mr. Terrillion, thereby reducing his June \ncaseload to within monthly limits.1  \n \nIn addition to some of the monthly totals, I am also concerned about the distribution of \ndifferent types of cases among the public defenders.  During the second quarter, almost \nall of the class A felony cases were assigned to just three attorneys: \n \nAttorney  Total \nPerry  10 \nBillingsley  6 \nSt. Marie  5 \nPeterson  1 \nDoherty  0 \nGrigaliunas  0 \nLindholdt  0 \nMaggard  0 \nTerrillion  0 \nTotal  22 \n \nFor Mr. Perry especially,2 but also Mr. Billingsley and Ms. St. Marie, the high number of \nclass A case assignments tends to makes their caseloads much more challenging than \nthose of other defenders.  Similarly, dedicating certain defenders to handle probation \nviolation cases (Terrillion) and child support cases (Maggard)3 removes those less \ndemanding cases from the mix of assignments available to other defenders.  In the future, \nGrant County should strive to balance workloads more evenly among the defenders.  \nAside from better distribution of the class A assignments, Grant County should also \nconsider rotating coverage of the probation violation calendars and hiring additional \nattorneys qualified to handle class A felonies.  To some extent, this problem may be \nalleviated with Mr. Doherty and Mr. Kentner available to share the class A work in the \ncoming months. \n \nOn a more general level, I am concerned that the case counts provided by Grant County \ndo not always accurately reflect all of the cases actually handled by its public defenders.  \nIn addition to the problems with tracking reassigned cases noted above, Grant County’s \n                                                 \n1 Mr. Grigaliunas could also have covered the probation violations during the first two weeks of June.  He \nwas assigned no cases for the month even though he worked until June 15. \n2 At the current rate, Mr. Perry would receive 40 class A felonies in a year in addition to his 100 or so other \nfelony cases.  It would be extraordinarily difficult to provide effective assistance of counsel to all of one’s \nclients while carrying such a caseload. \n3 Grant County has created a difficult situation for itself with respect to Ms. Maggard as she does not yet \nmeet minimum standards for handling felony cases.  As a result, she will be limited to child support cases \nfor the foreseeable future.  This is problematic in that it prevents other defenders from handling a portion of \nthe child support cases as a means of relief from felonies.  In addition, Ms. Maggard will never become \nqualified to handle felony cases if she continues to work on child supports full-time.  Ms. Maggard is \ninterested in criminal practice, and I have encouraged Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales to explore \noptions for giving her some criminal experience in district court (subject to approval by the parties).  \n2009 Quarterly Report - 5 of 19 \n\ncurrent method of counting probation violation, child support, and some felony cases \ndoes not appear to comply with the Settlement Agreement.  With respect to probation \nviolations, it is my understanding that a large number of cases are not being credited to \nthe attorney handling them.  Although I have repeatedly asked Supervising Attorney Ray \nGonzales for some policy or rationale that would explain the failure to count these cases, \nhe has offered no theory under which these cases should not be credited to the handling \nattorney.  I recently reviewed the probation calendar from just one week and found \napproximately 15 uncounted cases.   \n \nSimilarly, I recently discovered that Grant County has adopted a formula that awards \nreduced credit for some child support cases.  The Settlement Agreement provides simply \nthat each case is to be counted as one case equivalent.  Grant County, however, awards \n1/3 of a credit for some hearings.  In some instances, this may result in the attorney \nreceiving more credit than required by the Settlement Agreement; in other instances, they \nwill receive less.  I do not know whether correcting the child support credit formula to \ncomply with the Agreement will ultimately result in more or less credits being awarded to \nthe attorney covering child support matters.  I have discussed this matter with Mr. \nGonzales, and it is my understanding that he anticipates revising the Department’s \nmethod of counting child support cases to comply with the Settlement Agreement. \n \nFinally, some felony cases during the second quarter were counted as 1/3 of a credit. \nMost of these reduced credit cases were cases assigned for sentencing only.  While I do \nnot necessarily disagree with the notion that cases assigned post-plea warrant less credit \nthan cases pending trial, the Settlement Agreement does not offer a reduced credit option.  \nIt simply requires that all felony cases, aside from probation violations, be counted as one \ncase equivalent.  After discussing the matter with Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales, I \nexpect that Grant County will be submitting a proposal to Plaintiffs to allow for reduced \ncredit in certain circumstances. \n \n \nTraining \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires Grant County to satisfy NLADA Standards for \ndefender training.  The preface to those standards recognizes that “[c]ontinuous \nimprovement and training are critical to competence [and] crucial to the delivery of \neffective services to the clients served by defender organizations.”   \n \nIn April, Grant County supported its in-house defenders in attending the annual \nconference of the Washington Defender Association which provides about 10 hours of \nrelevant training.4  This was a very positive development, and I hope that Grant County \ncontinues to support its defenders in attending this conference in the future.  I understand \nthat Grant County also offered some financial support to its contract defenders but did so \nat the last minute, too late for any of the contract defenders to attend the conference.   \n                                                 \n4 Grant County’s Department of Public Defense recently became a member of the Washington Defender \nAssociation, allowing in-house defenders to attend CLEs without paying tuition.  Grant County agreed to \nreimburse its defenders who attended the out of town conference up to $300 toward expenses. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 6 of 19 \n\n \nGrant County has also been flexible in allowing Julie St. Marie to attend the Gerry \nSpence Trial Lawyers College in Wyoming for three weeks this month (at her own \nexpense).  Furthermore, Mr. Gonzales has indicated because Ms. St. Marie did not attend \nthe WDA conference, he will ask Grant County to authorize her to apply the funds made \navailable for that conference to the Trial Lawyers College. \n \nI have been disappointed, however, by the lack of local training opportunities for Grant \nCounty’s defenders this year.  Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales has not organized any \ntrainings for Grant County’s defenders in 2009.  His predecessor regularly organized \nlocal trainings and was quite creative in doing so.  With Mr. Gonzales’ experience with \nthe Washington State Office Public Defense and his work in other counties, I had hoped \nthat he would improve the training available to local defenders.  To date, however, \ntraining has not seemed to be a priority for Mr. Gonzales. \n \nMr. Gonzales should organize local trainings on a regular basis.  Lunchtime trainings are \na staple of institutional public defenders.  Such trainings are not difficult to organize, \ntypically cost nothing, and can be extraordinarily helpful.  Potential speakers include not \njust local criminal defense attorneys, but also judges, prosecutors, jail personnel, or \nrepresentatives from the clerk’s office.  It can be incredibly helpful on many levels to \ninteract with other participants in the criminal justice system outside of a courtroom \nsetting.  Attorneys in other practice areas such as immigration, disability, and family law \ncan also provide valuable insights to the criminal practitioner.  Lastly, the public \ndefenders themselves are a valuable untapped resource for trainings.  Every public \ndefender in Grant County has practiced in another jurisdiction and likely has unique \nknowledge and insights to share with his or her colleagues.  Mr. Gonzales himself \npresumably has a wealth of experience to share from his many years of practice.   All of \nthese resources are readily available to Grant County if only Mr. Gonzales would take \nadvantage of them. \n \n \nFirst Appearances \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that Grant County provide representation at initial \nappearances for all indigent defendants.  Grant County assigns first appearance duty to its \ndefenders on a rotating weekly basis.  Based upon my review of court files and intake \nsheets, Grant County appears to be providing representation to all defendants at first \nappearance.   \n \nAlthough Grant County no longer requires its public defenders to visit defendants in jail \nprior to their first appearance, they continue to do so on a fairly consistent basis.  I found \nrecords of 121 such visits during the second quarter.  Mr. Terrillion (33) and Mr. Perry \n(25) had the most first appearance visits during the second quarter.5  Visits seem to \naverage about 10 minutes long.   \n                                                 \n5 It appears that the in-house defenders are covering most of the Wednesday through Friday hearings so that \nthe contract defenders are not forced to travel to Ephrata solely to handle a few first appearances.   \n2009 Quarterly Report - 7 of 19 \n\nJail Visits  \n \nGrant County public defenders are required to make contact with all new clients prior to \narraignment if practicable but in no event later than seven days from the date of \nassignment.  For in-custody clients, an in person visit at the jail is required.  Grant \nCounty’s written policy on initial client contact makes clear that a meeting in the \ncourtroom or in the hallway outside the courtroom is not sufficient.   \n \nIn the past, some of Grant County’s public defenders have not made timely jail visits a \npriority.  In 2008, the defenders as a group showed steady improvement, and by the \nfourth quarter, were visiting 90% of their in-custody clients within 7 days.   While the \ndefenders have not maintained that pace in 2009, the percentage of timely visits in 2009 \nremains higher than in the first three quarters of 2008. \n \nTo assess the timeliness of jail visits during the second quarter, I reviewed 70 in-custody \nfelony cases assigned during the quarter, cross-referencing the case assignments with jail \nvisitation logs and inmate lists from the Grant County Jail.  Overall, I found that the \nGrant County defenders visited their clients on or before the day of arraignment \napproximately 59% of the time and within seven days approximately 83% of the time.  \nThese figures are up from last quarter and represent the second best overall performance \nsince the start of 2008.  The table below reflects the timeliness of jail visits over the past \nsix quarters: \n \n  1Q 2008  2Q 2008  3Q 2008  4Q 2008  1Q 2009  2Q 2009 \nVisit before  25%  34%  38%  70%  41%  59% \narraignment \n \nVisit within  39%  46%  65%  90%  76%  83% \n7 days \n \nAs in prior quarters, some defenders were quite diligent in visiting in-custody clients \nwithin seven days.  Three attorneys received the bulk of the in-custody assignments \nduring the second quarter:  John Perry (18), Janelle Peterson (14), and Julie St. Marie \n(13).  All were well above average in making timely visits to their in-custody clients.  \nMs. Peterson visited 100% of her in-custody clients within seven days and 67% before \narraignment.  Mr. Perry visited 94% of his clients within seven days and 88% before \narraignment.  Finally, Ms. St. Marie visited 85% of her clients within seven days and \n62% prior to arraignment. 6  \n \nAside from Dean Terrillion, who visited all four of his jailed clients within seven days, \nthe remaining defenders were all below average in making timely jail visits.  Brett \nBillingsley had the highest rate of timely visits in this group at 75%, but the two clients \n                                                 \n6 Ms. St. Marie did have long delays in visiting two clients assigned in June.  I suspect these delays were \ndue to the fact that she was in trial three times in the space of about 5 weeks during this time, just before \nleaving for her three week training in Wyoming.  Still, Ms. St. Marie should have visited these clients in a \ntimely fashion or asked that they be reassigned. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 8 of 19 \n\nhe was late in visiting were both charged with class A felonies.  Both Ms. Lindholdt and \nMr. Grigaliunas were scheduled to leave the employment of Grant County at or near the \nend of the quarter, and that status appears to have affected their jail visits.  Ms. Lindholdt \nvisited only 50% of her clients within seven days.  Neither of her in-custody clients from \nJune had received a jail visit as of July 10, having already waited approximately a month.  \nMr. Grigaliunas had the lowest rate of timely jail visits at 33%.  Two defendants assigned \nto him shortly before he resigned never received a visit from him.  The first opportunity \nfor these clients to sit down and meet with their attorneys occurred when the cases were \nreassigned to new counsel, approximately a month after counsel was originally \nappointed.  In the future, it would seem prudent to avoid assigning in-custody defendants \nto departing defenders if at all possible.   \n \nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales has indicated that he expects the in-house defenders \nto visit jailed clients within three days of assignment.  I strongly support his effort to \nencourage his staff to make initial contact with their clients as soon as possible.  During \nthe second quarter, however, the in-house defenders made the initial jail visit within three \ndays only 52% of the time.   \n \nOverall, Grant County public defenders are much better in making timely jail visits than \nthey were a year ago at this time, but there remains substantial room for improvement.  \nCurrently, even though Grant County policy requires a jail visit prior to arraignment, it \nappears that in the minds of most Grant County public defenders, the real deadline for jail \nvisits is seven days from assignment.   While a week’s delay is certainly an improvement \nover past practice, Grant County should hold its defenders to a higher standard.  Grant \nCounty policy requires a visit prior to arraignment “if practicable.”  It seems unlikely that \nsuch visits are not practicable 41% of the time. \n \n \nInvestigator Staffing \n \nGrant County currently has five approved public defense investigators:  Ellyn Berg, Marv \nScott, Kathleen Kennedy, Jim Patterson, and Mario Torres.  Ms. Berg recently accepted \nan in-house position and is now a full-time employee of the Grant County Department of \nPublic Defense.  In addition, Grant County recently submitted two additional \ninvestigators for approval.    \n \nBoth Ellyn Berg and Marv Scott consistently receive exceptionally positive reviews.  \nKathleen Kennedy has not been with Grant County as long as Ms. Berg and Mr. Scott, \nbut she too seems to be highly regarded.  According to one attorney, Ms. Berg is a \n“genius” who ought to be making more than the attorneys.  Marv Scott is “fantastic, \nsmart, timely, great attitude . . . .”  Kathleen Kennedy is “well-trained . . . very smart and \nhas helped me explore case theories I wouldn’t have otherwise.”   \n \nThough Jim Patterson has only recently resumed work for Grant County, the quality of \nhis investigation has always been excellent.  So long as he can devote sufficient time to \nhis Grant County cases, Mr. Patterson’s return is a very encouraging development.   \n2009 Quarterly Report - 9 of 19 \n\n \nIn my last report, I noted that both the defenders and Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales \nhad expressed concern regarding the work of investigator Mario Torres.  During the first \nquarter, former Supervising Attorney Alan White had stopped assigning cases to Mr. \nTorres, and Mr. Gonzales had approached me regarding withdrawing my approval of \nhim.  Under the circumstances, I assumed that Mr. Gonzales would simply stop assigning \ncases to Mr. Torres.  I later learned, however, that Grant County had actually resumed \nassigning cases to Mr. Torres during the second quarter.   \n \nFeedback on Mr. Torres work this quarter has been mixed with one attorney pleased with \nhis work but another wondering whether he’s done any work at all and reporting an \nalmost total lack of communication from Mr. Torres.  A third attorney was unaware Mr. \nTorres had been assigned to investigate one of his cases because Mr. Torres had never \ncontacted him in the six weeks he’d had the case.  In one case assigned to Mr. Torres, the \nonly contact the attorney had with him was a request from his office for discovery two \nweeks after the case had been assigned to him.  Although the attorney specifically \nrequested progress reports, Mr. Torres did not provide any.  Although the attorney \nspecifically instructed the investigator not to contact the client directly, Mr. Torres went \nto the jail and had a lengthy meeting with the client.  This meeting was apparently Mr. \nTorres’ first work on the case and occurred two days before the investigation was due to \nbe completed.   \n \nUnder the circumstances, I have serious reservations about Grant County’s continued use \nof Mr. Torres for felony investigations.  If Mr. Gonzales elects to continue assigning \ncases to Mr. Torres, he should closely monitor those cases to ensure that Mr. Torres’ \nwork is timely and the quality of his interviews and reports is appropriate for felony \ncases. \n \nOverall, the investigation staff continues to be a strength of Grant County’s public \ndefense system.  During the second quarter, the investigation work of Mr. Patterson and \nMs. Berg convinced prosecutors that they had charged the wrong men in a co-defendant \nrobbery case and resulted in outright dismissal.  Defender Julie St. Marie also reported \nthat Mr. Scott’s investigation was critical to defense efforts in her drug trial in April that \nended in a hung jury. \n \n \nInvestigation Rates \n \nThe overall rate of investigation for the second quarter was 27.6% down slightly from \n29.1% in the first quarter.  Investigation rates have been higher in prior years at 36% in \n2008 and 35% in 2007.  The rates for individual attorneys during the second quarter \nranged from 0% to 59%: \n2009 Quarterly Report - 10 of 19 \n\n \n2Q \nINVESTIGATION \nATTORNEY  RATE \nPeterson  62% \nPerry  36% \nLindholdt  33% \nTerrillion  25% \nSt. Marie  17% \nBillingsley  10% \nDoherty  8% \nGrigaliunas  0% \n \n \nAs in the past, most but not all defenders appear to be making appropriate use of \ninvestigators on their cases.   \n \nThe investigation rates for defenders Peterson, Perry, Lindholdt, and Terrillion all appear \nreasonable.  Mr. Terrillion’s rate of investigation appears lower than it actually is because \na number of cases re-assigned to him in June were already pending sentencing when he \nreceived them.  Ms. St. Marie’s rate is somewhat low, but it is likely that her busy trial \nschedule during the latter half of the second quarter delayed submission of new \ninvestigation requests.  Mr. Doherty just started with Grant County and received most of \nhis cases during the last 6 weeks of the quarter.  I expect his investigation rate will \nincrease during the next quarter.  Mr. Billingsley’s rate of investigation is too low, but he \nreceived almost half of his case assignments for the quarter during the last two weeks of \nJune and will likely be requesting investigation on those during the next quarter.   \n \nWhile it makes sense to give some defenders the benefit of the doubt and expect their \nrates to improve next quarter, Frank Grigaliunas’ investigation rate of 0% cannot be so \neasily explained away.  During his tenure with Grant County, Mr. Grigaliunas never \nrequested investigation on any of his cases.  His wholesale failure to conduct \ninvestigation falls well below the minimum standards required for effective assistance of \ncounsel.  In speaking with Mr. Grigaliunas after his departure, he agreed that he should \nhave utilized investigators on his cases but indicated that he did not know how to get an \ninvestigator assigned and said that when he asked, he was referred to a form on the office \ncomputers.  He found the process cumbersome and did not pursue it further. \n \nI first met Mr. Grigaliunas in March, and based upon my meeting with him as well as my \nobservations of him in court, I immediately expressed concerns to Supervising Attorney \nRay Gonzales about the quality of his representation.  I urged Mr. Gonzales to supervise \nhim very closely so as to recognize and address any problems before they negatively \nimpacted his clients.  Mr. Gonzales does not seem to have heeded this warning.  As \nSupervising Attorney, Mr. Gonzales is expected to work with the defenders on their \ncases, offering strategic guidance and ensuring that indigent defendants in Grant County \nare well represented.  Moreover, he personally assigns the investigators.  At some point, \n2009 Quarterly Report - 11 of 19 \n\nMr. Gonzales should have recognized that Mr. Grigaliunas was not investigating his \ncases and should have immediately taken steps to rectify this problem.   \n \n \nExperts \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that public defenders make expert requests ex parte \nand that records relating to experts be sealed.  During the second quarter, I found three \ncases in which Grant County public defenders requested experts.  Two requests were \nmade by John Perry, and the other by Brett Billingsley.  The requests appear to have been \nmade ex parte but were not sealed.  As was the case last quarter, in one case, Mr. Perry \nplanned to have his own psychological expert observe the defendant’s evaluation by \npersonnel from Eastern State Hospital, and his application did not contain any \nconfidential information other than the identity of the expert.  Sealing was not necessary \nin that case.  In Mr. Perry’s second case, he did ask that his pleadings be sealed but that \nrequest was denied by the court.  On Mr. Billingsley’s expert request, he explained that \nhe did not make a motion to seal because he anticipated the court would deny it. \n \nSealing of expert requests continues to be a problem in Grant County.  As I indicated last \nquarter, Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales should take the lead in developing \nstandardized forms, procedures, and policies to guide the use of defense experts.  He \nshould draft a motion to seal with authority and argument in order to persuade local \njudges that such documents should be sealed or if unsuccessful with the trial court, to \nmake a record for appeal in an appropriate case.   \n \n \nMotions Practice \n \nEach quarter, I evaluate motions practice by reviewing electronic court dockets to \nidentify cases in which motions are filed and then review the court files in those matters.  \nDuring the second quarter, I reviewed both new felony assignments and ongoing cases \nfrom 2008 and found 10 cases in which current Grant County defenders had filed \nsubstantive motions.7  Five different defenders filed motions.  Julie St. Marie filed \nmotions in six of her cases this quarter.  Brett Billingsley, Frank Grigaliunas, John Perry, \nand Janelle Peterson each filed motions in one case.   \n \nJulie St. Marie’s motions practice this quarter was particularly impressive.  She \nchallenged the warrantless entry and search of a home, the warrantless arrest of an \nuninvolved bystander during service of a search warrant, and the detention and search of \na vehicle’s passenger in connection with the arrest of the driver.  She filed motions \npursuant to CrR 3.5, CrR 3.6, and State v. Knapstad. \n \n                                                 \n7 For purposes of this analysis, I defined substantive motions as any written motion to suppress pursuant to \nCrR 3.5 or CrR 3.6, any written Knapstad motion, and any written brief that contained substantive legal \nanalysis tailored to a particular case.   \n2009 Quarterly Report - 12 of 19 \n\nBrett Billingsley’s work was also noteworthy.  He filed a series of motions in a child \nmolestation case that went to trial this quarter.  He raised a Franks issue questioning the \nvalidity of an order authorizing a wiretap, moved to dismiss for prosecutorial \nmismanagement under CrR 8.3 based on repeated discovery violations, and filed detailed \ncase-specific motions in limine prior to trial.  His motions practice in this particular case \nwas very thorough. \n \nThree defenders did not file any substantive motions during the second quarter:  John \nDoherty, Karen Lindholdt, and Dean Terrillion.  Mr. Doherty and Ms. Lindholdt received \nthe fewest new case assignments during the quarter.  As noted above, Mr. Doherty didn’t \nstart work with Grant County until May and received the bulk of his cases relatively \nrecently.  I am not concerned with Ms. Lindholdt’s lack of motions as she has always \nbeen diligent in raising legal issues and filing motions.  Mr. Terrillion received a large \nnumber of his new assignments for the quarter at the end of June, too late to file any \nappropriate motions before the end of the quarter.  He has been primarily covering the \nprobation violation calendar. \n \nThis quarter I also attempted to track motions that are less substantive in that they involve \nlittle or no legal research and writing but are nonetheless a very important part of \ncriminal practice.  Basic discovery requests and motions to compel are classic examples.  \nDuring the second quarter, I found eight cases in which Janelle Peterson had filed \ndetailed request for additional or missing discovery.  In reviewing court files, I have also \nobserved that Ms. Peterson makes good use of the omnibus hearing to obtain orders that \nspecific items of discovery be provided by a date certain.  In addition to discovery \nrequests, I found that Frank Grigaliunas and Dean Terrillion both filed written release \nmotions.  Karen Lindholdt and Dean Terrillion obtained orders for DOSA evaluations.    \nBrett Billingsley filed a written declaration in support of a motion to continue the trial \ndate, and John Perry filed a motion to depose the State’s expert witness in a murder case. \n \n \nOverall Quality of Representation \n   \nGrant County continues to have a solid core of defenders who provide quality \nrepresentation.  With the loss of some very good defenders in the last six months and \npotentially more going forward, the core group is not as strong as it once was, but Grant \nCounty still has a solid foundation upon which to build.  Hopefully, Grant County already \nhas the pieces in place to do so.  Only time will tell if the defenders hired in the last \nseveral months will prove to be worthy replacements for those who have moved on.   \n \nAmong the current defenders, Julie St. Marie clearly stands out.  She has a strong \nmotions practice and a consistently aggressive approach to her work.  She took cases to \ntrial four times in the second quarter alone and has already had another trial in early July.  \nShe has completed twice as many jury trials in 2009 as any defender had in all of 2008.  \nAlthough I have not personally had the opportunity to observe her in trial, Ms. St. Marie \nis reportedly quite a skilled trial attorney.  During the second quarter, she won a not \nguilty verdict on a burglary charge in one trial and a hung jury on a drug charge in \n2009 Quarterly Report - 13 of 19 \n\nanother.  In the drug case, she had to overcome a large quantity of drugs found in her \nclient’s purse as well as a confession.    \n \nBrett Billingsley and Karen Lindholdt also had jury trials during the second quarter.  Mr. \nBillingsley tried a class A sex case, and as described above, was exceptionally thorough \nin litigating the relevant legal issues in the case.  Ms. Lindholdt tried a case involving two \ncounts of Assault 3° on a police officer, Resisting Arrest, and Criminal Trespass.  She \nwas able to win an acquittal on one count of Assault 3° and on the charge of Resisting \nArrest. \n \n \nSupervising Attorney \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that the Monitor “oversee and assess the Supervising \nAttorney’s performance.”  Unfortunately, I continued to be disappointed with the \nperformance of Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales during the second quarter.  As \nSupervision Attorney, Mr. Gonzales has two primary job responsibilities, administration \nand supervision.  He did neither well during the second quarter. \n \nThe administrative problems experienced by the Grant County Department of Public \nDefense during the second quarter were significant.  Neither monthly caseloads nor \nconflicts of interest were monitored appropriately.  Case assignments and reassignments \nwere done haphazardly and not in a timely fashion.   Cases were frequently assigned to \none attorney and then later taken back to be reassigned to a different attorney because Mr. \nGonzales had realized that the original attorney was over his caseload limit or had a \nconflict or wasn’t available for some reason. \n \nThe departure of Frank Grigaliunas was particularly poorly handled.  Mr. Grigaliunas \nfirst notified Mr. Gonzales of his decision to resign on May 26, 2009.  Yet Mr. Gonzales \ndid not take any meaningful steps to transfer Mr. Grigaliunas’ cases until approximately \nJune 19, a week after Mr. Grigaliunas had left Grant County.  At least six cases assigned \nto Mr. Grigaliunas had scheduled hearings the week of June 15; one was scheduled for \ntrial that week.   It appears that the in-house defenders simply stood in on those cases \nuntil new counsel could be assigned.  Two more of Mr. Grigaliunas’ cases were \nscheduled for trial the following week.  One was transferred on June 23, the day of trial; \nthe other was transferred five days prior to trial.  In the interim, all of these defendants \nwere essentially unrepresented.  Moreover, Mr. Grigaliunas had not requested \ninvestigation on any of his cases and prepared transfer memos in only a few.  Some cases \nwere apparently handed directly to other attorneys with no transfer process at all.  Others \nwere discovered in Mr. Grigaliunas’ desk drawers after he left. \n \nMr. Gonzales’ complete failure to prepare for Mr. Grigaliunas’ departure did a disservice \nto the remaining defenders, the court, and most importantly, the Department’s clients.  \nUpon learning that Mr. Grigaliunas intended to resign, Mr. Gonzales should have \nprepared a list of cases assigned to Mr. Grigaliunas and reviewed the status of each case \nwith him in preparation for transfer.  For cases pending trial, particularly in-custody \n2009 Quarterly Report - 14 of 19 \n\ncases, Mr. Gonzales should have immediately identified the attorney to whom the case \nwould be transferred.   He should have directed Mr. Grigaliunas to request any missing \ndiscovery, file briefs and request investigation where appropriate, and prepare a transfer \nmemo for the new attorney.  To the extent possible, the cases should have been \ntransferred while Mr. Grigaliunas was still employed by Grant County to allow Mr. \nGrigaliunas to introduce his clients to their new attorneys and otherwise ensure a smooth \ntransition.  Mr. Gonzales should have been monitoring the transfer process throughout. \n \nSimilar problems occurred with the transfer of Janelle Peterson’s cases.8  On June 10, \nMs. Peterson delivered approximately 13 cases to the Grant County Department of Public \nDefense for reassignment.  Although several of the cases had hearings scheduled on June \n15, Mr. Gonzales did not begin reassigning the cases for more than a week.  Some cases \nwere not reassigned until June 22 and June 23.  During the week of June 15, when the \ncourt or prosecutors called the cases waiting to be transferred, no one communicated to \nthe court that the cases were being transferred.  Instead, it appeared that Ms. Peterson was \nsimply neglecting her duties.  Defenders volunteered to stand in for her and requested \ncontinuances, but they did not have files or any explanation to provide the court.  Mr. \nGonzales’ delay in reassigning these cases and his failure to advise the court of his plan \nto reassign them reflected poorly on both Ms. Peterson and the public defense system as a \nwhole. \n \nConflicts of interest were also problematic in the second quarter.  In mid-May, Mr. \nGonzales advised me that two co-defendants had both been assigned to attorneys with the \nGrant County Department of Public Defense.  He explained the one of the defendants had \nbeen represented by John Perry for several months while the other had only recently been \nreassigned to Frank Grigaliunas.  He advised me that the second case had been in-house \nfor only a few days and that he intended to reassign that case to a contract defender.  In \ndiscussing the situation with Mr. Gonzales, I noted that ethics rules arguably required \nwithdrawal from both cases but that since it had only been a few days, Mr. Perry might \nbe able to keep his case if Mr. Gonzales set up a formal conflict screen.  I subsequently \nlearned that Mr. Grigaliunas had actually been assigned to the second co-defendant for \nmore than a month, that the conflict had not been discovered until the day before trial, \nand that Mr. Gonzales never established a formal conflict screen. \n \nUpon learning of the above conflict, I began reviewing conflicts more closely and \ndiscovered a host of other problems.  In June, numerous cases were assigned to defenders \nwho had apparent conflicts of interest based on prior representation of witnesses and/or \nco-defendants.   In one instance, Brett Billingsley was assigned to two different co-\ndefendants charged in the same incident for which he already represented the third co-\ndefendant.  Most of these conflicts were identified by office staff at the time of \nassignment but inexplicably overlooked by Mr. Gonzales in making case assignments.  \nAt least six conflicts were not discovered until I reviewed the case assignments for \n                                                 \n8 In response to Ms. Peterson’s expressed fear of a particular prosecutor, Grant County agreed to \n“accommodate” Ms. Peterson by reassigning cases in which that prosecutor was directly involved. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 15 of 19 \n\nconflicts and notified the Grant County Department of Public Defense.9  One case had \nalready been completed by the attorney with the apparent conflict.   \n \nI also discovered conflicts of interest issues relating to the complaint line and to the \nhiring of an in-house investigator.  After denying Grant County’s initial request for \napproval of its in-house program due in part to concerns relating to conflicts of interest, \nGrant County provided specific assurances that the issues I had raised would be \naddressed in the new Department’s policies and procedures.  In explaining my concerns \nregarding complaints, I wrote: \n \nPerhaps the most difficult conflicts problem created by the move in-house is \noversight of co-defendant cases.  Whenever the Grant County Department of \nPublic Defense is assigned to represent one co-defendant, the Department and its \nSupervising Attorney will be presumptively disqualified from involvement in the \ncases of the other co-defendants.  In such cases, the Supervising Attorney would \nnot be available to supervise the co-defendants’ cases nor would he be available \nto receive and investigate complaints regarding the representation of the co-\ndefendants.   \n \nTo address these issues, on May 8, 2009, Grant County adopted a complaint response \npolicy that requires any complaints on cases in which the Grant County Department of \nPublic Defense had a conflict to be “forwarded to a neutral third party for disposition . . . \n.”  In July, however, when I inquired as to how complaint calls were screened for \nconflicts, I was informed that calls were not reviewed for conflicts at all.   \n \nSimilarly, regarding investigators, I wrote: \n \nAt present, the County does not appear to have done sufficient planning to address \nthe issues associated with employing in-house investigators.  In particular, \nconflicts issues have not been adequately addressed.  Each approved investigator \nhas been actively working for indigent criminal defendants in Grant County for \nsome time.  For any of these investigators who are hired in-house, their former \nclients must be tracked and included in any conflicts check procedure.  As with \nthe defenders, an investigator’s prior work on behalf of a witness, victim, or co-\ndefendant in a current case may result in imputed disqualification of the entire \nDepartment of Public Defense. \n \nIn response, Grant County adopted a conflict of interest policy which provides that \ninvestigators are subject to the same conflicts standards and policies as attorneys.  I \nrecently discovered, however, that the conflicts procedure for investigators that has been \nimplemented is woefully inadequate and does not comply with the Rules of Professional \nConduct.  The only conflict that the current procedure is designed to detect is two co-\ndefendants being assigned to the same investigator.   The procedure does not recognize \n                                                 \n9 Two listed conflicts were later deemed to be clerical errors rather than conflicts.   Nonetheless, the failure \nto recognize the apparent conflict and resolve the issue prior to assignment remains problematic. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 16 of 19 \n\nthat the investigator’s work on behalf of co-defendants or witnesses may itself create a \nconflict for the entire Department.   \n \nThis potential problem has become a reality with the hiring of Ellyn Berg as an in-house \ninvestigator.  Prior to being hired in-house, Ms. Berg was a contract investigator with \nGrant County.  As a result, she had an existing caseload on which she continues to work \nnow that she is an employee of the Grant County Department of Public Defense.  Among \nthe cases Ms. Berg brought with her in-house are cases in which the Department has a \nclear conflict of interest based upon representation of the co-defendant.  In other words, a \nDepartment attorney is working on behalf of one co-defendant while Ms. Berg, a \nDepartment investigator is working on behalf of a different co-defendant.  In a brief \nreview of recent investigation assignments, I found two cases in which this had occurred, \nincluding a first degree murder case.  In addition to obvious conflicts such as Department \nemployees working on behalf of different co-defendants, conflicts may arise based upon \nMs. Berg’s previous investigation work on behalf of a witness or victim.  As with an \nattorney, that prior relationship may create a conflict of interest.  The current Grant \nCounty procedures are simply not designed to detect such conflicts. \n \nWhile the administrative issues are a serious concern, perhaps the most troubling aspect \nof Mr. Gonzales’ performance in the second quarter was his inadequate supervision of \nMr. Grigaliunas.  As discussed above, I had serious concerns about Mr. Grigaliunas from \nthe start and shared those concerns with Mr. Gonzales.  I urged Mr. Gonzales to closely \nsupervise Mr. Grigaliunas so that he could either dispel my concerns or promptly \nrecognize and address any issues that arose.  In March, Mr. Grigaliunas waited almost a \nmonth to visit one of the first in-custody clients he was assigned in Grant County at a \ntime when he had very few cases.   He had similar issues in April and May.  Mr. \nGrigaliunas never requested investigation on any case, and  I found only 4 cases that were \nresolved by Mr. Grigaliunas during his employment by Grant County.   At this point, \nthere is little dispute that the quality of Mr. Grigaliunas’ work in Grant County was poor.  \nYet when Mr. Grigaliunas first submitted his resignation, Mr. Gonzales declined to \naccept it and asked that he take a few days to reconsider.  Mr. Gonzales’ response \nsuggests that he was either unaware of, or unconcerned with, the quality of Mr. \nGrigaliunas’ work.    \n \nIn speaking with Mr. Grigaliunas after his departure, I found him to be very candid and \nself-critical in his assessment of his work in Grant County.  He seemed well-intentioned, \nbut acknowledged that he did not do as much as he should have on his cases.  He \nexplained that defense practice is very different from being a prosecutor and that he had \ndifficulty with the adjustment.  He felt largely unsupervised and unsupported in Grant \nCounty and lacked guidance on local procedures and practices.  While he likes Mr. \nGonzales very much personally, Mr. Grigaliunas felt that Mr. Gonzales was not proactive \nin discussing cases with him, and there were no regular staff meetings to discuss cases \nand/or legal issues.  Mr. Grigaliunas was quick to add that he did not seek out assistance \nor direction either.  Mr. Grigaliunas noted that in setting up his private practice, he was \nspending “a lot of time designing forms and checklists for opening, developing, and \n2009 Quarterly Report - 17 of 19 \n\nclosing cases, as well as making a database of relevant information. It hadn’t occurred to \nme before that at Grant, we really had nothing of the kind.”   \n \nAt one point in April, Mr. Grigaliunas reported that Mr. Gonzales discussed the \nMonitor’s concerns about is performance with him and suggested they would have \nweekly meetings to make sure Mr. Grigaliunas succeeded in Grant County.  \nUnfortunately, those meetings never occurred.  Mr. Grigaliunas recently wrote to me that \nhis wife summed up his experience in Grant County by saying “it was a horrendous \ndisaster of a failure—nobody was in charge and everybody was in trouble.” \n \nMr. Gonzales could have and should have recognized the problems with Mr. Grigaliunas’ \nwork much sooner than he did.  Mr. Grigaliunas’ account regarding the lack of \nsupervision and support from Mr. Gonzales is extremely troubling.  I detailed for Mr. \nGonzales in March what I thought were fairly significant concerns about Mr. Grigaliunas.  \nThat Mr. Gonzales subsequently left Mr. Grigaliunas essentially unmonitored is \ndisappointing to say the least.  While I have not surveyed all of the defenders regarding \nthe level of supervision provided by Mr. Gonzales, Mr. Grigaliunas’ description echoes \nthe reports I’ve received from others.   It is my impression that Mr. Gonzales is not \nproactive in supervising the defenders and is not sought out by them because he is not \nseen as a helpful resource.  He delegates many of his responsibilities to others, \nparticularly to defender John Perry.  Mr. Perry, however, has a full caseload of his own \nand has no official supervisory role in Grant County. \n \nThe second quarter was definitely unusually challenging, but Mr. Gonzales must be able \nto successfully overcome such challenges.  Administratively, he must take steps to \ncorrect the systemic problems that became apparent during the second quarter.  In \nsupervising his staff, Mr. Gonzales must be more proactive in both his oversight and his \nmentoring of the defenders.   \n \n \nClient Complaints \n \nGrant County continues to maintain a toll-free telephone line for client complaints.  \nInstructions regarding how to make a complaint are posted in several locations at the jail \nin both English and Spanish.  Responsibility for handling the toll-free complaint line was \ntransferred to the Grant County Department of Public Defense in early May.  For out-of-\ncustody defendants, the assigned public defender provides each client with a flyer at \narraignment that directs him or her to contact the Supervising Attorney with complaints \nand includes his contact information.  The flyer has now been updated to reflect the fact \nthat Mr. Gonzales is the Supervising Attorney, but I recently discovered that the local \nnumber listed for Mr. Gonzales on the flyer is incorrect.   \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 18 of 19 \n\nDuring the second quarter, it appears that the overall number of complaint calls was \ndown.10  Most calls continue to relate to attorney-client communication, with inmates \nrequesting visits from or trying to reach their assigned attorneys.  I suspect that the \navailability of a full-time receptionist at the Grant County Department of Public Defense \nis at least partially responsible for the apparent reduction in calls to the complaint line.  \nThe ability of clients to reach a live person who can connect them directly to their \nassigned attorneys or promise to relay a message to the attorney or let them know the \nattorney is in court, at jail, etc. no doubt reduces client frustration and prevents \ncommunication issues from escalating into complaints.  \n \nAfter reviewing the complaints logs for the second quarter, it appears that most \ncomplaints were handled appropriately.  I remain concerned, however, that Supervising \nAttorney Ray Gonzales sometimes seems too ready to dismiss client complaints without a \nthorough investigation.  For example, repeated complaints from two clients of Frank \nGrigaliunas should have raised red flags for Mr. Gonzales.  Had he investigated these \ncomplaints more thoroughly, he might have learned much earlier of serious problems \nwith the quality of representation being provided by Mr. Grigaliunas.   While it is \nimportant for a supervising attorney to be supportive of his staff, the first priority must \nalways be the clients.  I agree with Mr. Gonzales’ inclination to trust that the defenders he \nsupervises are handling their cases appropriately and to reassure the clients when needed, \nbut he must take care to verify, rather than assume, that his trust is warranted.   \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThe keys to providing high quality public defense are caseload limits and hiring the right \npersonnel.  Grant County has the necessary caseload limits in place to allow its defenders \nto provide effective representation.  Grant County continues to face serious challenges, \nhowever, in recruiting and retaining the personnel needed to ensure that the system works \nas it should.    \n \n \n                                                 \n10 I do not have actual data on the number of complaint calls during the second quarter because there was \nsome confusion in transferring responsibility for the complaint line in-house regarding the format for \nrecording complaints.  As a result, no spreadsheet was prepared for May. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 19 of 19 ",

Grant County \n \nMonitor’s Report \n \nFirst Quarter, 2009 \n \nApril 27, 2009 \n \nSubmitted by Francisco Rodriguez, Settlement Monitor \n \n \nMonitor’s Activities \n \nDuring the first quarter, I travelled Grant County on three separate occasions:   \n \n  January 12-13, 2009 \n  February 9-10, 2009 \n  March 23-24, 2009 \n \nWhile in Ephrata, I observed court proceedings, reviewed court files, and met with public \ndefenders.  Between site visits, I maintain regular contact with the Supervising Attorney \nand have periodic contact with individual defenders, investigators, and counsel for both \nparties.  \n \nIn addition to my regular activities, on February 19, 2009, I met with counsel for Grant \nCounty and for Plaintiffs, Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales, and one of the Grant \nCounty Commissioners to discuss Grant County’s plans for an in-house public defense \nsystem.   \n \nDue to past problems with jail visits, I now review case assignments and jail visitation \nlogs each quarter to determine whether the Grant County public defenders are visiting \ntheir in-custody clients in a timely fashion.   In addition, I systematically review \nelectronic court dockets for cases assigned to Grant County’s public defenders in order to \nevaluate defender motions practice, use of experts, and case outcomes.   \n \n \nAccess to Information \n \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Monitor shall have broad access to \ninformation concerning the Grant County public defense system.  Plaintiffs are granted \nsimilarly broad access with the additional requirement that all requested documents must \nbe provided within ten days.   \n \nSince Grant County began implementing its in-house public defense system, information \nrelating to the public defense system has been much more difficult to obtain.  Despite \nrepeated promises to address the problem, formal requests for information have been \n2009 Quarterly Report - 1 of 21 \n\ntreated as public disclosure requests, resulting in long delays in the production of \ndocuments and inappropriate redaction of the documents produced.    \n \nGrant County has been more forthcoming with documents and other information in recent \nweeks due to the intervention of counsel.  Counsel for Grant County has also offered \nfresh assurances that requests from the Plaintiffs and the Monitor will no longer be \nsubject to the public disclosure process. \n \n \n2007-09 Compliance \n \nThe parties recently reached an agreement with respect to compliance issues for 2007-\n2009.  As part of that agreement, Grant County is to obtain Monitor approval of its in-\nhouse public defense program by May 28, 2009.  At present, Grant County is actively \nworking toward approval. \n \n \nDeparture of Okanogan Defenders \n \nAs noted in my last report, four full-time Grant County public defenders, Mike Haas, \nMelissa MacDougall, Mike Prince, and Brian Gwinn, submitted their resignations in \nDecember after winning the public defense contract for Okanogan County.  The newly \nformed law firm, Haas, MacDougall, and Prince took over Okanogan County public \ndefense as of January 1, 2009.  Grant County was aware that the start date for the \nOkanogan County contract was January 1 and that continuing to employ these attorneys \nas public defenders in Grant County while they simultaneously worked in Okanogan \nCounty would violate the Settlement Agreement.  Nonetheless, Grant County continued \nto assign new cases to all four defenders in January and February.  Brian Gwinn \ncontinued to receive new cases through March.   \n \nEach of the four defenders worked in Okanogan County during the first quarter.  In \naddition to receiving new case assignments in Okanogan County, they took over several \nhundred pending cases from the prior public defenders.  As a group, these defenders have \nbeen practicing in both Okanogan Superior Court and Okanogan District Court, handling \nfelonies, misdemeanors, juvenile cases and dependencies.  The Okanogan cases appear to \nhave been handled primarily by Mike Haas, Melissa MacDougall, and to a lesser extent \nBrian Gwinn.1  Mr. Prince has spent far less time than his colleagues in Okanogan \nCounty as he has been serving as the primary Grant County coverage attorney for the \ngroup.   \n \nWhen I visited Grant County in mid-January, I specifically expressed concern about the \ndeparting defenders maintaining two full-time public defender positions at the same time.  \nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales indicated that he shared my concerns about Mr. Haas \n                                                 \n1 Haas, MacDougall, and Prince did hire other attorneys to assist with the workload in Okanogan County, \nbut Mr. Haas and Ms. MacDougall have both been working there full-time, and Mr. Gwinn is the primary \nconflicts counsel for felonies, dependencies, and district court cases. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 2 of 21 \n\nand Ms. MacDougall but assured me that Mr. Prince and Mr. Gwinn were not yet \npracticing in Okanogan County.  I urged him to investigate the matter further because I \nhad received reports to the contrary.  I also suggested that Grant County avoid assigning \nnew cases to these defenders unless absolutely necessary.  Grant County chose instead to \ncontinue assigning new cases to the Okanogan defenders.   \n \nGrant County eventually negotiated an early termination agreement with three of the four \ndefenders but continued to assign them new cases in both January and February.  The \nCounty made these assignments even though the remaining defenders had sufficient \ncapacity to absorb the cases.  Moreover, even after acknowledging that these defenders \nwere actively practicing in Okanogan County, Grant County did very little to ensure that \ntheir existing clients in Grant County were being represented appropriately.   \n \nThe impact on indigent defendants in Grant County of continued representation by these \ndefenders has varied.  The greatest impact has been on the clients of Mr. Haas because at \nthe time of his departure, he had been carrying a full felony caseload for years, and due to \nhis experience level, he had some of the most serious and complex cases in Grant \nCounty.  The impact of Ms. MacDougall’s absence has been less because she had far \nfewer open felony cases than Mr. Haas.  Ms. MacDougall had been sharing responsibility \nfor the probation violation docket which reduced significantly the number of new case \nassignments she received.  In addition, she had only been working in Grant County since \nmid-September and so did not have time to build up a large backlog of felony cases.  Mr. \nPrince also had a reduced felony caseload due to his assignment to the probation violation \ncalendar.  Moreover, Mr. Prince has actually been present in Grant County far more than \nMr. Haas or Ms. MacDougall.  Finally, Mr. Gwinn had very few felony cases left in 2009 \nbecause he has been handling child support cases almost exclusively for about a year.   \n \nEarly in the first quarter, it became clear that Mr. Haas and Ms. MacDougall were no \nlonger spending much time in Grant County and that Mr. Prince was covering most of \ntheir hearings.  At first, Mr. Prince was simply standing in for them in court while they \nattempted to continue working their own cases.  Eventually, however, it became clear to \nall of the lawyers involved that Mr. Haas and Ms. MacDougall had become counsel in \nname only, and Mr. Prince assumed full responsibility for their remaining clients.  This \ntransition seems to have occurred in late February and early March.  Mr. Prince was thus \nhandling not only his own caseload but that of two other full-time public defenders (plus \nhis limited work in Okanogan County).   \n \nCaseload limits are intended to ensure that the strain of public defender workloads does \nnot create undue pressure to settle cases or take other shortcuts that may not be in the best \ninterest of the client.   In a criminal case, legal issues and strategic decisions are often not \nclear cut.  The attorney can easily rationalize recommending a plea or a trial, a bench trial \nor jury trial, stipulating or refusing to stipulate, etc.  The fact that a plea or bench trial or \nstipulation saves the attorney time and effort should not be a factor in the attorney’s \ndecision-making.  Unfortunately, as workloads increase, the path of least resistance \nbecomes more tempting.   \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 3 of 21 \n\nIn this instance, I have no doubt that Mr. Prince, Mr. Haas, and Ms. MacDougall had, and \ncontinue to have the best intentions with respect to the quality of representation provided \nto their clients.  Nevertheless, I am concerned about whether the workload of these \ndefenders may have influenced their decision-making.  For example, in reviewing case \nfiles and dockets, I noticed a surprising number of CrR 3.5 stipulations submitted by Mr. \nPrince2 during the first quarter.  To confirm my observations, I compared the stipulation \nrates for Mr. Haas, Ms. MacDougall, and Mr. Prince to the other defenders and found that \nthe Okanogan defenders had submitted stipulations in 37% of their cases while the other \ndefenders had submitted stipulations in only 11% of theirs.3  Stipulations may have been \nin the client’s interest in every one of these cases, but the surrounding circumstances \ncertainly raise questions about whether workload may have affected the attorneys’ \ndecision-making. \n \nAccessibility has also been an issue.  Both Mr. Haas and Ms. MacDougall have been \nlargely absent from Grant County since the start of the year.  Apparently, they have been \nquite busy with their new practice in Okanogan County, leaving little time to \ncommunicate with and/or visit Grant County clients.  Client complaint records and jail \nvisitation logs confirm that their availability has been problematic throughout the quarter.   \n \nAs far as case dispositions, the risks inherent in this situation are obvious.  A lack of \ncommunication prevents the development of a healthy attorney-client relationship.  \nAbsent such a relationship, defendants tend to lack confidence in the advice offered by \ntheir attorneys.  Some may plead guilty because they have no faith in their attorney’s \nability to represent them well at trial while others may insist on going to trial because \nthey do not trust their attorney’s recommendation to accept a plea offer.  For the attorney \nwho is newly substituted in, trial preparation may be less than optimal due to having too \nmany cases to juggle and less familiarity with the case to be tried than the assigned \nattorney. \n \nDuring my March visit, for example, Mr. Prince requested a trial continuance on behalf \nof C.T., a client assigned to Mike Haas.  When the request for continuance was denied, \nMr. Prince was faced with going to trial the very next day, unprepared, with a client \nwhom he was never assigned to represent.  Ultimately, the case was continued the next \nmorning when Mr. Prince informed the court that he was too ill to try the case.  \n \nI later learned that Mr. Prince had already tried another of Mr. Haas’ cases early last \nmonth.  Mr. Haas had represented client J.L. since May of 2008, but Mr. Prince \nrepresented him at trial after having been in court with him only once in 2009 to cover an \nomnibus hearing for Mr. Haas.  Mr. Prince filed a “notice of association” on March 9.  \nTrial started March 11, and J.L. was found guilty the same day.   J.L. has a second case \n                                                 \n2 I looked at 420 cases that were pending at some point during the first quarter of 2009.   The Okanogan \ndefenders submitted stipulations in 34 of 93 cases while the other defenders submitted stipulations in only \n37 of 327 cases. \n3 It is unclear which attorney actually made the decision to stipulate.  Mr. Prince submitted the stipulations \nin most cases, but I do not know whether he was acting on directions from Mr. Haas or Ms. MacDougall \nwhen he entered stipulations on their cases. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 4 of 21 \n\ncurrently awaiting trial in which the prosecutor is threatening to amend to attempted \nmurder.  Although Mr. Haas has represented the client on that case since April 2008, Mr. \nPrince plans to handle that trial as well.  \n \nI am not able to determine whether the representation provided to any of the affected \ndefendants has actually been compromised, but the situation is certainly troubling.  In late \nMarch, I wrote to Grant County to formally express my concern that the Okanogan \ndefenders were (1) exceeding caseload limits; (2) engaging in private practice without \napproval; and (3) engaging in private practice in excess of the amount permitted by the \nSettlement Agreement.  To address these problems, I recommended that Grant County \nimmediately transfer all pending cases assigned to Mike Haas and Melissa MacDougall.   \n \nAt present, a few cases have been transferred; the rest have not.  The court, \nunderstandably frustrated by the absence of Mr. Haas in particular, has reportedly \nexpressed reluctance to relieve Mr. Haas of his obligations on a few of his cases.  Mr. \nGonzales has advised me that he expects the issue of substitution of counsel on many of \nthese cases to be resolved in this week.  At this point, Grant County’s overriding concern \nmust be to take whatever steps are necessary to protect the interests of the affected \nclients. \n \nTo avoid a recurrence of this situation in the future, I have recommended that Grant \nCounty revise its defender contracts.  Current contracts require 120 days notice of \ntermination and contain no wind-down provision.4  These contracts are unrealistic and \nunworkable unless the resigning defender is planning to simply go into private practice \nwithin Grant County.  Very few employers are likely to wait 4 months for a new attorney \nto start work much less allow him or her return to Grant County month after month in \norder to completely resolve a full public defender caseload.  Indeed, past experience in \nGrant County demonstrates that when its public defenders resign, they start other work \nprior to the end of the notice period and ultimately withdraw from many of their \nremaining cases.  There is a simple solution to this problem.  The contractual notice \nperiod should be shortened and a wind down period added so that departing defenders are \nnot in lame duck status for four months and the County is not saddled with absentee \npublic defenders for months on end.  Contracts for incoming defenders should require \nthem to assume an existing caseload so that there is no additional cost to the County in \ntransferring the cases.  New defenders could then immediately take over cases from those \nwho are leaving, ensuring that indigent defendants in Grant County aren’t left effectively \nunrepresented when their attorneys take other jobs and move away.   \n \n                                                 \n4 Grant County has generally elected not to assign cases during the last 30 days of an attorney’s tenure, but \nto the best of my knowledge, this informal practice is not required under the current contracts.  Grant \nCounty’s defender contracts for 2007 required only 90 days notice and contained a 45 day wind down \nprovision which prohibited new cases assignments for the last 45 days of the contract. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 5 of 21 \n\nAttorney Staffing \n \nTo replace the attorneys leaving for Okanogan County, Grant County hired three new \nfull-time defenders.  Frank Grigaliunas and Dean Terrillion started on March 2, and \nKacie Maggard started April 1.  All were hired as Grant County employees with the \nnewly created Grant County Department of Public Defense.  Mr. Grigaliunas comes to \nGrant County from the Spokane County Prosecutor’s Office while Mr. Terrillion comes \nfrom the Pacific County Prosecutor’s Office.  Ms. Maggard was just admitted to the bar \nlast year.  Because she lacks the requisite experience to handle felonies under WSBA-\nendorsed standards, Ms. Maggard will be assigned to the child support calendar full-time.   \n \nGrant County lost yet another defender at the end of March with the resignation of Karen \nLindholdt.  The departure of Ms. Lindholdt is another serious blow to Grant County \npublic defense.  She is one of the most experienced attorneys on staff and has \ndemonstrated herself to be a strong advocate for her clients.  She routinely negotiates \nvery favorable resolutions for her clients but also consistently recognizes and litigates \nlegal issues. She also goes to trial when appropriate.  Ms. Lindholdt has been invaluable \nto the program as an attorney capable of handling very serious and/or complex cases \nwithout the need for close supervision. \n \nThe level of staff turnover in Grant County causes me great concern.  The County has \nlost more than half of its defenders in the last several months.  At this point, only one \ndefender has been with Grant County for as long as two years.  The newly hired attorneys \ndo not have nearly as much criminal defense experience as those who have resigned, and \nI worry that Grant County may not have a sufficiently experience staff to handle all of its \nserious cases.   \n \nI have repeatedly urged Grant County to negotiate contract extensions with the remaining \ncontract defenders so as to avoid further turnover.  Indeed, I had strongly advocated that \nGrant County extend Ms. Lindholdt’s contract in particular because I viewed retaining \nher as critical to the long term success of the program.  Despite the obvious negative \nconsequences for its public defense system of these departures, Grant County has so far \ndeclined to offer any measure of job security to its defenders.   \n \nThe remaining contract defenders have expressed apprehension about the number of \nserious felony cases they are now receiving.  Given the lack of commitment by Grant \nCounty and what they perceive to be increasingly hostile working conditions, they are \nexploring other employment options.   \n \n \nCaseloads \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires Grant County to observe an annual caseload limit of \n150 case equivalents for each attorney.   In addition, Grant County has adopted monthly \nand quarterly limits to protect against excessive short-term workloads and to ensure its \ndefenders do not reach annual caseload limits too early in the year.  The annual caseload \n2009 Quarterly Report - 6 of 21 \n\nlimit of 150 would translate to a pro-rated monthly limit of 12.5 cases and a quarterly \nlimit of 37.5 cases.  The monthly and quarterly limits adopted by Grant County are \nsomewhat higher than that at 16 case equivalents per month and 40 per quarter.  These \nhigher limits allow Grant County flexibility in handling fluctuations in assignments from \nthe court. \n \nDuring the first quarter, there were fewer felony case assignments than expected, so most \ndefenders were well below monthly and quarterly limits.  The reduction in felony filings \nwas particularly well-timed in that it allowed Grant County to reduce case assignments \nsomewhat for the defenders who had resigned and were already actively working in \nOkanogan County.  During the first quarter, the departing defenders (other than Brian \nGwinn) received about half as many case assignments as those who remained. \n \nAlthough caseloads were generally well below limits, one defender, Brian Gwinn, was \nassigned far too many cases.  Mr. Gwinn’s monthly caseload for January was 21.66, well \nabove the monthly limit of 16.  His quarterly total was 52.66, again well above the \nquarterly limit of 40.  Most importantly, Mr. Gwinn exceeded his pro-rated annual \ncaseload limit.  Mr. Gwinn has resigned and the County agreed not to assign him cases in \nApril.  His pro-rated annual caseload limit for the three months he was eligible for case \nassignments in 2009 was 37.5.5  Thus, he exceeded his annual caseload limit by more \nthan 15 cases. \n \nMr. Gwinn’s high caseload resulted from the fact that he was the sole attorney assigned \nto the child support calendars during the first quarter.  Child support assignments have \nhistorically been high in the first quarter of the year and can fluctuate dramatically from \nmonth to month.  For that reason, I have previously recommended to Grant County that \nchild support cases be assigned to more than one attorney to avoid exceeding caseload \nlimits.  In this instance, it was evident in January and February that Mr. Gwinn’s caseload \nwas too high.  Indeed, Mr. Gwinn had already reached his caseload limit by the end of \nFebruary.  Nonetheless, he remained the sole defender assigned to handle child supports \nduring March and was assigned 14.33 additional cases.  Grant County clearly could have \nand should have handled this situation better. \n \nIn terms of impact on his clients, I do not believe Mr. Gwinn’s high caseload is likely to \nhave affected the quality of his representation, though I cannot be sure.  My main \nhesitation in this regard is the fact that over the last few months, in addition to completing \nhis contract with Grant County, Mr. Gwinn has also been working in Okanogan County \nas a public defender and accepting private cases.   Because Mr. Gwinn has not provided \nthe required disclosures regarding this work, I am unable to determine his outside \nworkload or evaluate its impact on his work in Grant County. \n \n                                                 \n5 Grant County’s contract with Mr. Gwinn provides for a 30 day wind-down period during which he is not \nto receive any new case assignments.  Because he is not eligible for new case assignments during this time, \nI did not include the month of April when calculating his pro-rated annual caseload limit.  Even adding that \nmonth, however, Mr. Gwinn still exceeded his annual caseload limit albeit by a much smaller margin. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 7 of 21 \n\nIn the future, Grant County needs to take steps to address the problems involved in \nassigning a single defender to cover all child support cases.6  This issue is particularly \npressing in that Grant County’s newest full-time defender is not permitted to handle any \nother type of case.  It may be that monitoring assignments more closely and rotating \nanother defender in to cover occasional child support calendars would solve this problem.  \nIn addition, I understand that Grant County has again approached Plaintiffs about the \npossibility of reducing case credits for child support cases.  Such an agreement could also \nhelp alleviate this problem.  In the meantime, Grant County is considering adopting a \nseparate set of monthly and quarterly caseload limits for child support cases with higher \nlimits than for felony cases.     \n \n \nTraining \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires Grant County to satisfy NLADA Standards for \ndefender training.  The preface to those standards recognizes that “[c]ontinuous \nimprovement and training are critical to competence [and] crucial to the delivery of \neffective services to the clients served by defender organizations.”  To the best of my \nknowledge, neither bar associations nor private organizations nor any other groups \nregularly provide training on criminal defense topics in Grant County.  Accordingly, in \nthe past, Grant County has satisfied its obligations under the Settlement Agreement by \norganizing its own trainings and by subsidizing defenders who attend relevant trainings \nelsewhere. \n \nIn 2009, Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales has not organized any formal training for \nGrant County’s defenders.  Former supervisor Alan White was very creative in finding \nlocal resources for in-house trainings and also organized more formal trainings in Grant \nCounty with the assistance of the Washington Defender Association and the Washington \nState Office Public Defense.  I hope that in the future Mr. Gonzales is able to arrange for \nsimilar training opportunities. \n \nIn addition to the lack of any organized training during the first quarter, Mr. Gonzales has \ninformed me that Grant County no longer intends to provide support to its contract \ndefenders for trainings.  This change in policy is extremely disappointing.  Training has \nalways been an area of strength for Grant County.  In past years, in addition to the local \ntrainings set up by Mr. White, Grant County has sent defenders to the National Criminal \nDefense College in Macon, GA, for two weeks of intensive trial training and supported \nother defenders in attending intensive 3-day trainings through Jerry Spence’s Trial \nLawyers College.  Under the new policy announced by Mr. Gonzales, it is unclear to me \nhow Grant County intends to meet its training obligations. \n \nOn a positive note, Grant County’s Department of Public Defense recently joined the \nWashington Defender Association and offered financial support to its in-house defenders \nto attend the annual conference in Winthrop, Washington.   In the future, I hope that \n                                                 \n6 Similar problems arise with probation violation calendars, and Grant County should attend to that issue as \nwell.   \n2009 Quarterly Report - 8 of 21 \n\nGrant County will return to its prior practice of supporting its contract defenders in \nattending such trainings. \n \n \nFirst Appearances \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that Grant County provide representation at initial \nappearances for all indigent defendants.  Grant County satisfies this obligation by \nassigning each of its full-time defenders first appearances duty for a week at a time on a \nrotating basis throughout the year.   At present, Grant County appears to be providing \nrepresentation to all in-custody defendants.  I have not evaluated representation of out-of-\ncustody defendants recently but plan to do so next quarter.   \n \nAlthough Grant County no longer requires its public defenders to visit first appearance \nclients in jail prior to their hearings, most defenders continue to do so.  I found a record \nof many such client visits during the first quarter.  For each month, I found a few days on \nwhich the first appearance attorney did not visit any clients in the jail, but those days \nwere clearly the exception rather than the rule.   \n \n \nJail Visits  \n \nGrant County requires its public defenders to make contact with all new clients within \nseven days.  Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales has established a higher standard for in-\nhouse defenders, indicating that defenders from his office are expected to visit jailed \nclients within three days of assignment.  For all defenders, Grant County’s written policy \non client contact makes clear that a meeting with the client in the courtroom or in the \nhallway outside the courtroom is not sufficient.   \n \nTimely jail visits have been a persistent problem in Grant County.   In past years, delays \nof several weeks or longer were not uncommon.  Some inmates pled guilty and were \nsentenced without ever having received a visit from the assigned attorney.  Despite clear \nrules requiring prompt jail visits and close scrutiny of performance in this area, some of \nGrant County’s defenders continue to have difficulty consistently visiting their in-custody \nclients in a timely fashion. \n \nI reviewed 70 in-custody cases assigned during the first quarter and found that the Grant \nCounty defenders visited their clients on or before the day of arraignment approximately \n41% of the time.  Within a week, the defenders as a group had visited 76% of their in-\ncustody clients.  These figures are down from last quarter when the defenders visited \n90% of jailed clients within seven days and 70% prior to arraignment.  Nonetheless, the \nfirst quarter visitation rates did remain higher than those from the first three quarters of \n2008.  The table below reflects the timeliness of jail visits over the past five quarters: \n2009 Quarterly Report - 9 of 21 \n\n \n  1Q 2008  2Q 2008  3Q 2008  4Q 2008  1Q 2009 \nVisit before  25%  34%  38%  70%  41% \narraignment \n \nVisit within 7  39%  46%  65%  90%  76% \ndays \n \nDuring the first quarter, some defenders were quite diligent in visiting clients within \nseven days.  Janelle Peterson and Julie St. Marie both received 10 in-custody assignments \nduring the first quarter and visited 100% of them within seven days.  John Perry and \nKaren Lindholdt each received 13 assignments.  Mr. Perry visited all but one within \nseven days, a rate of 92%, and Ms. Lindholdt was close behind at 85%.  Although they \nreceived very few in-custody case assignments, Dean Terrillion and Mike Prince visited \nall of their clients within seven days.  \n \nOnly four defenders, John Perry, Janelle Peterson, Julie St. Marie, and Dean Terrillion \nvisited more than 50% of their clients prior to arraignment.  Ms. St. Marie had the highest \nrate of visits before arraignment at 70%.   \n \nAmong defenders receiving a significant number of in-custody case assignments, only \nBrett Billingsley had a particularly low rate of timely visits.  He received 15 in-custody \ncases and visited less than half within seven days.  His jail visits were timely in only 47% \nof his cases.  Several other defenders also performed poorly in this area during the first \nquarter.  Mike Haas, Melissa MacDougall, and Frank Grigaliunas were assigned a total of \nsix in-custody cases between them and did not manage to visit any of them within seven \ndays.   \n \nWhile some defendants only had to wait a few extra days for a visit, others had to endure \nmuch longer delays.  I found 8 inmates who had to wait 26 days or more for an attorney \nvisit.  Mr. Haas and Ms. MacDougall were most problematic in this regard as they did not \nvisit any of their five newly assigned in-custody clients during the first quarter.   Ms. \nMacDougall has not visited any client at the Grant County Jail in 2009.  Mr. Haas has not \nvisited any of his clients at the jail since January 26.  Although fellow defender Mike \nPrince eventually visited four of the five clients for Mr. Haas and Ms. MacDougall, the \nclients had already waited 19 days, 31 days, 37 days, and 68 days respectively before Mr. \nPrince went to see them.  Two of the clients pled guilty on the day Mr. Prince finally \nvisited them.  A third pled guilty a week before he finally received a visit, not from his \nassigned attorney but from Mr. Prince.  The last of the in-custody clients assigned to Mr. \nHaas had yet to receive a visit from anyone by the end of the third quarter, having already \nwaited 34 days in jail. \n \nBrett Billingsley, Frank Grigaliunas, and John Perry also had long delays in visiting some \nclients.  Mr. Billingsley waited 26 days to visit one client while another client had waited \nin jail 48 days by the end of the quarter without ever having received a visit.  Mr. \nGrigaliunas did not visit his lone in-custody client for 28 days, apparently due to a \nmisunderstanding regarding the jail visit policy.  While Mr. Perry visited 11 of his 12 in-\n2009 Quarterly Report - 10 of 21 \n\ncustody clients within seven days, he had one client who waited 35 days and had not yet \nreceived a visit by the end of the quarter.  Mr. Perry explained that he had been in contact \nwith client and actively working on the case and that the lack of a jail visit was an \noversight on his part. \n \n \nClient Complaints \n \nGrant County maintains a toll-free telephone line for client complaints.  Instructions \nregarding how to make a complaint are posted in several locations at the jail in both \nEnglish and Spanish.  For out-of-custody defendants, the assigned public defender \nprovides each client with a flyer at arraignment that directs him or her to contact the \nSupervising Attorney with complaints and includes his contact information.  I understand \nthat the flyer may still identify Alan White as the Supervising Attorney.  If so, this \ndocument should be updated to include Mr. Gonzales’ name and contact information. \n \nDespite the change in Supervising Attorney at the end of 2008, Grant County has \ncontinued to rely on former Supervising Attorney Alan White to process client \ncomplaints.  As before, calls to the toll-free complaint line go to Mr. White’s office, and \nhis assistant, Aracely Yanez, logs all incoming calls.  She then forwards messages to the \nassigned defender or refers the matter to the Supervising Attorney for follow-up.   \n \nThe split responsibility for complaints between Alan White and Ray Gonzales has caused \nsome problems in complaint reporting.  Alan White has continued to provide detailed \nmonthly reports on the complaint calls his office receives, but Mr. Gonzales has not been \nregularly tracking or reporting on the complaints he receives.  As a result, records relating \nto client complaints for the first quarter are incomplete.  Mr. Gonzales has now forwarded \nto me what records he has, and his assistant Gail Sundean has created a form for \ndocumenting such complaints in the future to avoid a recurrence of this problem. \n \nDuring the fourth quarter, there were 148 calls to the complaint line.  Many inmates call \nthe line repeatedly for the same or similar reasons.  Although there were a total of 148 \ncalls, there were only 73 unique callers.  Both the number of calls and the number of \nunique callers are higher than in the previous quarter.  In addition to calls to the \ncomplaint line, Mr. Gonzales received some complaints directly.  Many of the complaints \nreceived by Mr. White were referred to Mr. Gonzales for follow-up.  Yet according to \nMr. Gonzales, he assumed Mr. White was responsible for handling complaints.  As a \nresult of this confusion, no one followed up on some complaints. \n \nAs has consistently been the case, most complaint calls related to attorney-client \ncommunication and were similar in content to those received in prior quarters.   Many \ncallers expressed frustration over their lack of contact with Mike Haas.  Grant County \nreceived complaints regarding Mr. Haas throughout the first quarter, starting in early \nJanuary. \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 11 of 21 \n\nOn January 7, defendant T.W. called to request that Mr. Haas visit him in jail as soon as \npossible.  Mr. White’s office notified Mr. Haas and Mr. Gonzales regarding the call.  Mr. \nHaas never visited T.W. in jail, and T.W. finally pled guilty on February 18, \napproximately 42 days after requesting that his attorney visit him as soon as possible.    \nMr. Gonzales does not recall what may have been done to follow up on this complaint. \n \nOn January 8, defendant M.S. called to complain that Mr. Haas telephone line was not \nable to receive messages.  Mr. Gonzales emailed Mr. Haas asking him to get in touch \nwith the client.  I have no record of any other follow-up. \n \nAlso on January 8, defendant R.B. reported that he was unable to reach Mr. Haas.  Mr. \nHaas did visit the client on January 13, but on January 22, defendant R.B. called again to \nreport that he could not reach Mr. Haas.   The client called back repeatedly over the next \nseveral days regarding Mr. Haas’ availability.  On February 10, R.B. called again to \nrequest that Mr. Haas visit him.  On February 22, R.B. called to ask if Mr. Haas was still \nhis attorney since Mike Prince had helped him.  He was told that Mr. Haas was still his \nattorney.  On February 26, R.B. called to request that Mr. Haas visit before his next court \ndate.  Mr. Haas did not visit R.B. again after the January 13 visit.  Mike Prince finally \nvisited the client on March 4.  The case was ultimately resolved by way of a plea and \nprison sentence on March 30 at which time the defendant had not received a visit from \nhis assigned attorney for 76 days.  R.B. made a total of 19 calls to the complaint line \nduring the first quarter.  Although the client’s calls were relayed to Mr. Haas, I have no \nrecord of any investigation or meaningful follow-up on the client’s complaints regarding \nthe ongoing lack of contact with Mr. Haas. \n \nOn February 4, defendant I.I. called to request a visit from Mr. Haas.  This client had \nwaited 24 days for the initial visit from Mr. Haas.  On February 9, defendant I.I. called \nthe complaint line again requesting to see his attorney.  He reported that Mr. Haas had \nonly visited him once in all the time he’d been in jail, that he had lots of questions, and \nthat he wanted a good lawyer or for Mr. Haas to visit him.  The message was forwarded \nto Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Haas.  I have received no record of any investigation or follow-\nup on this complaint.  Defendant I.I. finally pled guilty on March 24 having never \nreceived another visit from his assigned attorney.  In fact, Mr. Haas only appeared at one \nof the six hearings on the case from arraignment through sentencing.   \n \nOn February 24, defendant C.B. called to complain that Mr. Haas wouldn’t return calls \nand postpones everything.  Her case had been pending since September.  Alan White \nwrote a letter to Mr. Gonzales detailing the client’s complaint and submitting it to him for \nreview.  I have no record of any follow-up or investigation of this complaint.  Mr. \nGonzales reports that he did have a brief telephone conversation with C.B. but did not \nspeak with Mr. Haas regarding this matter. \n \nOn March 16, defendant D.H. called to report that he had called Mr. Haas several times \nwithout any response.  He asked whether Mr. Haas was still his attorney and requested \nthat someone reply as he would like to review his discovery.  Mr. Haas had been assigned \nthe case approximately a month earlier. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 12 of 21 \n\n \nOn March 17, defendant B.S. called because he had been unable to reach Mr. Haas.  He \nreported that Mr. Haas’ voicemail was full.  He was calling because he was running a \nhigh fever and wanted Mr. Haas to request a continuance. \n \nMr. Haas was not alone among the departing defenders in receiving complaints.  On \nFebruary 24, defendant R.R. called the complaint line to request a new attorney who was \n“not so busy.”  The client had been assigned to Melissa MacDougall about a week before \nshe and her partners took over the Okanogan County public defense contract.  Ms. \nMacDougall is exceptionally dedicated to her clients, so for her to receive this type of \ncomplaint suggests to me that her workload must have been very heavy at that time.  \nDefendant R.R.’s case is still pending trial and has been covered by Mike Prince for at \nleast the last couple of months.  Mr. Prince filed a “notice of association” on March 3. \n \nIn general, I am concerned as to whether Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales is giving \nclient complaints appropriate attention.  His standard response seems to be to convey the \ncomplaint to the handling attorney.  It should come as no surprise that he then receives \nassurances that the matter has been taken care of.  Depending on the nature of the \ncomplaint, a message to the assigned attorney may be sufficient to address the client’s \nconcerns, but some complaints require more follow-up, particularly if there is a pattern of \nsimilar complaints.  Aside from an inquiry to the assigned defender, I see little evidence \nof any actual investigation of most complaints.  Mr. Gonzales often did not even have \ndirect contact with the individual making the complaint as the messages were forwarded \nfrom Mr. White’s office.  While former Supervising Attorney Alan White frequently \nvisited clients in jail to investigate complaints, jail records do not reflect a single jail visit \nby Mr. Gonzales during the first quarter even though at least one caller expressly \nrequested a visit.   \n \nWhile criminal defendants frequently make frivolous complaints against their public \ndefenders, not all such complaints are unfounded.  In the future, Mr. Gonzales should \nprobe more deeply to determine whether clients who call to complaint may have valid \nconcerns.  In one case, for example, a client wrote to Mr. Gonzales that his defender told \nhim he was “was withdrawing as my counsel because I wouldn’t waive my right to \nspeedy again for the 8th time, so I felt that contacting you might be appropriate as you \nwill be needing to assign me new counsel.”  Mr. Gonzales responded by writing \n“[s]hould it become necessary to assign new counsel based on a decision by the court, our \noffice certainly will abide by the court’s order.”  Rather than dismiss the complaint and \nrefer the client to the court, a more appropriate response would have been to call the \nclient for further explanation, review the docket and perhaps the court file, and discuss \nthe matter with the attorney involved to determine whether the client’s complaint had any \nvalidity. \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 13 of 21 \n\nInvestigator Staffing \n \nGrant County currently has five approved public defense investigators:  Ellyn Berg, Marv \nScott, Kathleen Kennedy, Jim Patterson, and Mario Torres.  The feedback I have received \non Ellyn Berg and Marv Scott has always been excellent.  One defender recently \ndescribed them as “top-notch.”  Another called them “absolutely outstanding.”  \nAccording to the defenders, they are thorough, thoughtful, and always professional.  \nKathleen Kennedy has only been with Grant County since last quarter, but I’ve also \nreceived favorable reviews regarding her work. \n \nMr. Patterson has not been available for case assignments for most of the last six months. \nAlthough he has previously done good work for Grant County’s public defenders, he \nalways seems to have a heavy workload.  In the past, defenders have complained about \nhis communication and the timeliness of his work.  He recently informed Grant County \nthat he was again available for new assignments and received one new Grant County case \nat the end of March.  I hope that Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales will be vigilant in \nmonitoring Mr. Patterson’s work in the coming months to ensure he has sufficient time to \ndevote to Grant County cases. \n \nAs reported last quarter, I have received nothing but negative reviews regarding the work \nof Mario Torres.  He has failed to complete assigned tasks and been unresponsive to \nattorney requests.  In light of the consistently negative feedback, Alan White has stopped \nassigning cases to Mr. Torres.  Mr. Torres did not receive a single new adult felony case \nassignment during the first quarter.   \n \nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales recently approached me regarding a potential request \nto disapprove Mr. Torres.  I explained that while my approval allows Grant County to \nassign cases to Mr. Torres, Grant County is not required to assign Mr. Torres any cases at \nall.  I hope that Grant County will resolve this matter internally so that there will be no \nneed for me to determine whether to formally withdraw my approval.  If, however, I \ncontinue to receive complaints regarding his work, I will contemplate doing so.7 \n \nGiven Mr. Gonzales’ awareness of the problems with Mr. Torres, I was surprised to learn \nthat he had declined to re-assign one of Ms. MacDougall’s cases when she complained \nabout Mr. Torres.  Ms. MacDougall reports that she wrote to Mr. Gonzales twice to \ncomplain and requested re-assignment of the case, but Mr. Gonzales was unwilling to re-\nassign the case.  Mr. Gonzales reports that he referred the matter to Alan White as he did \nnot want to interfere with Mr. White’s assignment of investigators. \n \n                                                 \n7 I had significant reservations when I originally approved Mr. Torres and advised Grant County in writing \nthat I had struggled with the decision.  Regarding my reservations, I wrote to the County that “I spoke with \nthree different criminal defense attorneys who recommended that he not be approved.  Their primary \nconcerns were the thoroughness and timeliness of his work.  Even some of the attorneys who supported Mr. \nTorres expressed concern about him not completing work on time due to being understaffed and \noverextended.”  I ultimately approved Mr. Torres because of his fluency in Spanish and strong support \nfrom Alan White.   \n2009 Quarterly Report - 14 of 21 \n\nInvestigation Rates \n \nThe overall rate of investigation for the first quarter was 29.1%, compared with 36% in \n2008 and 35% in 2007.  The rate for individual attorneys ranged from 7% to 63%.  \nIndividual rates are listed in the table below: \n \n1st QUARTER \nINVESTIGATION \nATTORNEY  RATE \nPeterson  63% \nMacDougall  40% \nLindholdt  32% \nSt.Marie  26% \nPrince  25% \nBillingsley  24% \nPerry  10% \nHaas  7% \n \n \nAs in the past, most defenders appear to be making appropriate use of investigators on \ntheir cases.   \n \nMike Haas and John Perry had very low rates of investigation during the first quarter \nrelative to their colleagues.  To ensure that below average case assignments had not \nskewed the numbers, I compared individual investigation rates for the first quarter to \nrates for the last 6 months and for all of 2008.  The rates for most attorneys were fairly \nconsistent, but the rates for Mr. Haas and Mr. Perry were substantially lower in recent \nmonths than they had been previously: \n \n1ST \n2008  6 MONTH  QUARTER \nATTORNEY  RATE  RATE  RATE \nHaas  41.2%  6.3%  6.7% \nPerry  33.3%  21.7%  10.3% \n \n \nMr. Haas has submitted a total of two investigation requests in the last six months.  Mr. \nPerry has received more case assignments over the last six months and made substantially \nmore investigation requests than Mr. Haas, but his steadily declining rate of investigation \nis worrisome, particularly since he only joined Grant County last June.  I hope that this \ndecline proves to be a temporary aberration as Mr. Perry does seem to understand the \nimportance of investigation. \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 15 of 21 \n\nExperts \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that public defenders request experts via ex parte \nmotion and that the records relating to experts be sealed.  During the first quarter, I found \ntwo cases in which Grant County public defenders requested experts.  Both requests were \nmade by John Perry.  The requests appear to have been made ex parte but were not \nsealed.  In one case, Mr. Perry planned to have his own psychological expert observe the \ndefendant’s evaluation at Eastern State Hospital and his application did not contain any \nconfidential information other than the identity of the expert.  In the other case, however, \nMr. Perry’s declaration in support of his request for an expert clearly contained \nconfidential mental health information and should have been sealed.  Nonetheless, Mr. \nPerry is to be applauded for his use of experts on behalf of his clients. \n \nIn the coming months, I hope that new Supervising Attorney Ray Gonzales will make the \nissue of defense experts a priority and formalize the procedures to be used by Grant \nCounty’s public defenders.  Standardized forms, procedures, and policies would be very \nhelpful in ensuring that experts are employed when appropriate and that client \nconfidentiality is protected. \n \n \nMotions Practice \n \nI continue to evaluate motions practice by reviewing electronic court dockets to identify \ncases in which motions are filed.  During the first quarter, I reviewed both new felony \nassignments and ongoing cases from 2008 and found 13 cases in which Grant County \ndefenders had filed substantive motions.8  Six different defenders filed motions.  The \ntotals for all of the defenders who filed motions during the first quarter are listed below: \n         \nATTORNEY    MOTIONS \nPeterson  6 \nPerry  2 \nSt. Marie  2 \nBillingsley  1 \nLindholdt  1 \nTerrillion  1 \n \nJanelle Peterson and Julie St. Marie actually filed more motions than reflected above \nbecause they sometimes filed more than one motion in a given case.9  Ms. Peterson and \nMs. St. Marie both maintain an active motions practice as does Ms. Lindholdt.  I have \nbeen impressed with their level of practice in this area.  Although Mr. Perry has not been \npracticing in Grant County as long as the others, he too has consistently filed motions \n                                                 \n8 For purposes of this analysis, I defined substantive motions as any written motion to suppress pursuant to \nCrR 3.5 or CrR 3.6, any written Knapstad motion, and any written brief that contained substantive legal \nanalysis tailored to a particular case.   \n9 Ms. Peterson and Ms. St. Marie also raised CrR 3.5 issues this quarter and contested admission of their \nclients’ statements in lengthy evidentiary hearings.  Others may have had such hearings as well. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 16 of 21 \n\nwhen appropriate.  Mr. Terrillion only joined Grant County for the last month of the \nquarter but has already filed a substantive motion.  \n \nFour felony defenders did not file any motions in the first quarter.  Frank Grigaliunas just \nstarted in March, so he has not yet had a real opportunity to develop a motions practice.  \nMr. Haas, Ms. MacDougall, and Mr. Prince did not file any motions, but it is difficult to \ndetermine whether any meaningful conclusion can be drawn from this as they have been \nassigned fewer cases than the other defenders and may simply not have receive any cases \nin which motions were warranted.   \n \nIn terms of how I assess motions practice, some defenders have suggested that I have not \ngiven appropriate attention to release motions, furlough motions, motions to compel, \nDOSA evaluations, and other similar motions that may not involve legal research but are \nnonetheless a very important measure of the quality of the representation being provided.  \nAs one defender pointed out, these issues often matter more to the client and take more \ntime than suppression motions.  I agree and will endeavor to evaluate these areas in more \ndetail in future reports.     \n \n \nOverall Quality of Representation \n   \nGiven the amount of turnover in Grant County during the first quarter, it is difficult to \nevaluate the overall quality of representation.  Grant County has three new public \ndefenders who have not been on staff long enough to evaluate.  Clearly, the departure of \nalmost half of Grant County’s public defenders for Okanogan County has resulted in \nsome turmoil within the public defense program and raised questions about the quality of \nrepresentation being provided.  At the same time, the County still has several defenders \nwho consistently visit their clients in jail, file motions, investigate cases, and go to trial \nwhen necessary.  Retaining these attorneys should be Grant County’s top priority.  \n \nDisposition data for felony cases resolved during the first quarter indicates that Grant \nCounty’s public defenders continue to obtain favorable results for their clients in many \ncases.  Overall, the defenders had a felony conviction rate of 61%.  The individual rate of \nfelony convictions for most defenders ranged between 55% and 64%.  John Perry had an \nimpressively low rate of 46% while Mike Haas and Brett Billingsley had higher rates at \n73% and 80% respectively.  These figures of limited value, however, because they \ninclude only cases resolve during the first quarter, ranging from 15 to 33 cases per \nattorney. \n \nI also found 14 dismissals obtained by Grant County’s public defenders during the first \nquarter.  Ms. St. Marie had the most dismissals with four.  In one case, she obtained a \nsworn declaration from the alleged victim that persuaded the prosecutor to dismiss.  In \nanother, she won a dismissal by pushing a weak case to trial.  These are precisely the type \nof victories that one would expect to see from a strong public defense program. \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 17 of 21 \n\nGrant County public defenders had three felony trials during the first quarter, two jury \ntrials and one bench trial.  Ms. St. Marie won a not guilty jury verdict on a drug \npossession charge.  She had filed four separate briefs in the case, arguing unsuccessfully \nfor suppression and dismissal.  Mr. Prince also tried a drug possession case originally \nassigned to Mr. Haas.  As noted above, that case resulted in a guilty verdict.  Finally, \nBrett Billingsley took a felony eluding case to bench trial.  That case also resulted in a \nguilty verdict but not before Mr. Billingsley persuaded the court to conduct a scene visit.  \nIn addition to the trials that went to verdict, Ms. Lindholdt and Mr. Perry both resolved \ncases on favorable problems on the day of trial when the State discovered unexpected \nproblems with each case. \n \n \nSupervising Attorney \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that the Monitor “oversee and assess the Supervising \nAttorney’s performance.”  To date, I have been disappointed with the performance of \nSupervising Attorney Ray Gonzales.  The change in tone under Mr. Gonzales has been \ndramatic and negative.  His adversarial approach to supervision, poor communication, \nand reluctance to take on administrative responsibilities threatens to erase the progress \nmade by Grant County over the last year. \n \nMr. Gonzales seems to have adopted something of a siege mentality.  He takes an \nadversarial approach to Plaintiffs, the Monitor, and even the defenders he supervises.  In \nwritten communications with me, Mr. Gonzales frequently acts as though he is a member \nof Grant County’s legal team.  He has often been vague, evasive, and noncommittal in his \nanswers to my inquiries, particularly in his written responses regarding the County’s \nproposed in-house public defense program.  He now copies Grant County’s lawyers on \nroutine email correspondence with me.10  Overall, I have found counsel for Grant County \nto be far more candid and straightforward than Mr. Gonzales.   \n \nWith respect to the public defenders, Mr. Gonzales has created a working environment \ndefined by fear and dysfunction.  He has repeatedly cast doubt on the contract defender’s \njob security, making clear that he views them as an easily replaceable commodity.  \nMoreover, he has refused to consider extending any of the current defenders’ contracts \nwhile also suggesting that he intends to cut the salaries of those who remain next year.11  \nMr. Gonzales appears to care very much about his public image and intentionally or not, \nhas left the defenders with the impression that communication with the Monitor will be \nviewed as a personal betrayal.  As a result, the defenders are now extremely reluctant to \nshare their views with me as they fear retaliation.  Mr. Gonzales disputes the notion that \nthe defenders are fearful and suggests that they have no reason to be concerned about \nretaliation.  Perhaps this impression is simply a result of poor communication between \nMr. Gonzales and the defenders.  Regardless, it is not a healthy dynamic. \n \n                                                 \n10 Mr. Gonzales explains that he was instructed to do so by counsel.   \n11 Mr. Gonzales disputes that he has suggested reducing salaries.   \n2009 Quarterly Report - 18 of 21 \n\nIt should come as no surprise that morale among the remaining public defenders is still \nquite low.  I met with each of the current defenders individually during the first quarter.  \nWhile the contract defenders were less open with me than in the past, it was nonetheless \nevident that their opinions regarding Mr. Gonzales have changed very little.  With only \nfour contractors remaining, however, there is no longer any safety in anonymity.  As a \nresult, they are unwilling to be openly critical of Mr. Gonzales or share specific \ncomplaints that might identify them.  The lone exception has been Karen Lindholdt who \nresigned last month.  When asked about her reasons for leaving, she cited “irreconcilable \ndifferences with new management” and expressed great frustration with Mr. Gonzales.   \n \nOn a practical level, I am concerned about whether Mr. Gonzales has the administrative \nskills necessary to run the program.  Although he has been employed by Grant County for \nmore than four months and now has two support staff, Mr. Gonzales has still not assumed \nresponsibility for the administration of Grant County’s public defense program.  For \nsome reason, Grant County continues to outsource those tasks to its former Supervising \nAttorney, Alan White.  Mr. Gonzales does not yet assign cases, assign investigators, \nperform conflicts checks, monitor caseloads, track jail visits, or write any of the required \nreports.  Even the client complaint line is still routed to Alan White’s office.   \n \nI am perplexed at Mr. Gonzales’ willingness to abdicate one of the central functions of \nhis position for so long.  It is my understanding that at present, Mr. Gonzales is unable to \ndetermine which defender represents a particular client because he doesn’t have a list of \ncase assignments.  I find it troubling that Grant County clients could obtain the name of \ntheir attorneys by calling my office more easily than by calling the Grant County \nDepartment of Public Defense.  Retaining Mr. White for a period of time to assist with \nthe transition made sense, but after more than four months, that transition has not yet \nbegun.  Until recently, Mr. Gonzales had not planned to start taking over most \nadministrative tasks until June and was already contemplating an extension of Mr. \nWhite’s contract beyond the original 6 months.   \n \nI understand that counsel for Grant County has now directed Mr. Gonzales to accelerate \nhis timetable.  To his credit, Mr. Gonzales and his staff seem to have embraced the \nchallenge.  The County currently anticipates that Mr. Gonzales’ office will be able to take \nover administrative responsibilities within about a month.  In addition, over the last week \nor so, Mr. Gonzales and his staff have been proactive in working with me to understand \nand identify the information I need and have generously offered to provide information to \nme on a more frequent basis than before.     \n \nAnother major issue with Mr. Gonzales is that he fundamentally disagrees with the \nrequirements of the Settlement Agreement.  Although he is charged with enforcing the \nAgreement, he has shown little understanding of its terms.  During the first quarter, Mr. \nGonzales has: \n \n  Assigned himself to a vehicular homicide case even though the Settlement \nAgreement prohibits the Supervising Attorney from having a caseload.  See S.A. \n§ II(B)(1); \n2009 Quarterly Report - 19 of 21 \n\n \n  Insisted that he have “general oversight, monitoring, and budget responsibilities” \nfor District and Juvenile Court despite the Settlement Agreement’s express \nrequirement that he work full-time in Superior Court.  See S.A. § II(B)(1); \n \n  Failed to advocate for defender salary parity with prosecutors even though the \nSettlement Agreement requires it.  See. S.A. § II(B)(3) & § II(E)(1) \n \n  Suggested that he intends to alter the case credit formula for extraordinary cases \nset forth in the Settlement Agreement.  See S.A. § II(D)(3); \n \n  Assigned a conflict case without immediately notifying the Monitor of the \nassignment or seeking approval of the assignment.  See S.A. § II(F)(3); \n \n  Informed the contract defenders that he anticipates substantially reducing their \nsalaries in 2010 despite the fact that the Settlement Agreement specifies the \nsalaries for these defenders.12  See S.A. § II(E)(1); and \n \n  Suggested to me that in-house investigators did not need Monitor approval even \nthough the Settlement Agreement requires approval before Grant County hires \n“any investigator.”  S.A. § II(E)(2). \n \nAfter consultation with counsel for Grant County, Mr. Gonzales has retreated from most \nof the above positions.  His apparent disregard for the terms of the Settlement Agreement \nis particularly troubling in light of the fact that I expressed concerns regarding his \nwillingness to adhere to the Settlement Agreement before approving Mr. Gonzales as \nsupervisor.  At that time, I was assured by Grant County that he understood the \nAgreement and would abide by its terms.  Mr. Gonzales acknowledges some past errors \nin interpreting the Settlement Agreement but notes that such mistakes were early in his \ntenure and insists that he is committed to full compliance with the Agreement.   \n \nTo succeed as Supervising Attorney, Mr. Gonzales needs to fundamentally change his \napproach.  He must stop viewing himself as counsel for Grant County in this litigation \nand start thinking of himself as an advocate for indigent defendants and the public \ndefenders who represent them.  He must embrace a more cooperative, team approach and \nsomehow persuade the defenders that they share a common mission.   \n \n \nConclusion \n \nGrant County public defense experienced tremendous turmoil during the first quarter.  \nThe loss of four public defenders to Okanogan County has been difficult to say the least, \nand the transition to a new Supervising Attorney has been not been smooth.  Grant \nCounty had made great progress by the end of 2008, but with yet another talented \n                                                 \n12 Again, Mr. Gonzales disputes making such statements. \n2009 Quarterly Report - 20 of 21 \n\ndefender resigning in March and others looking for alternate employment, Grant County \nnow seems on the verge of starting over.   \n \n \n2009 Quarterly Report - 21 of 21 ",

      "text": "Best, et al. v. Grant County \n \nMonitor’s Report \n \nSecond Quarter, 2008 \n \nJuly 21, 2008 \n \nSubmitted by Francisco Rodriguez, Settlement Monitor \n \n \nMonitor’s Activities \n \nMy goal is to visit Grant County at least once per month.  During the second quarter of \nthis year, I travelled to Ephrata on three separate occasions:   \n \n  April 7-8, 2008 \n  May 19-20, 2008 \n  June  23-24, 2008 \n \nWhile in Ephrata, I observed court proceedings, reviewed court files, and met with public \ndefenders.   \n \nIn addition to site visits, I maintain regular contact with supervisor Alan White.  I also \nhave periodic contact with individual defenders, investigators, and counsel for both \nparties.  \n \n \nAccess to Information \n \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Monitor shall have broad access to \ninformation concerning the Grant County public defense system.  Supervising Attorney \nAlan White and his assistant Aracely Yanez continue to be very cooperative in \nresponding to my requests for information.   The Grant County Superior Court Clerk’s \nOffice is always very accommodating in my requests for access to court files.   \n \n \n2007-08 Compliance \n \nDuring the second quarter, I resolved disputes regarding the County’s compliance during \n2007 and 2008.  With respect to 2007, I found that the County violated the Settlement \nAgreement in numerous areas including: \n \n  Private practice by several full-time defenders \n \n  Use of part-time defenders without approval \n2008 Quarterly Report - 1 of 14 \n\n \n  Excessive use of part-time defenders \n \n  Use of unapproved investigators \n \n  Failure to hire a “full-time” Supervising Attorney \n \n  Failure to provide representation to all indigent defendants at first appearance \n \nI provided the County with recommendations to cure each of the violations.   \n \nWith respect to 2008, I found that the County was again in violation the Settlement \nAgreement because several full-time defenders continued to engage in private practice \nand because the County failed to properly account for its defenders’ work on contempt \ncases.  I provided the County with recommendations to cure these violations as well. \n \nThe County has implemented at least some of my recommendations.  I understand that \nthe County has objections to others and may still be working to implement the remainder.  \n \n \nAttorney Staffing/Caseloads \n \nThe County made several staffing changes in the second quarter.  Case assignments this \nyear have been running higher than the County expected.  The County also lost one of its \nfull-time defenders to health issues at the end of the first quarter.  To address the shortfall \ncaused by his absence as well as the increased case assignments, Supervising Attorney \nAlan White recommended that the County convert its two part-time defenders to full-time \nand hire an additional full-time defender.  The County responded by converting Ryan \nEarl to full-time effective April 1 and Brett Billingsley to full-time effective May 1.  In \naddition, the County hired a new defender, John Perry, and he began working full-time \non June 1.    \n \nUnfortunately, it appears that the third quarter will bring more staffing changes.  Ryan \nEarl recently resigned his position, and case assignments continue to exceed the County’s \nexpectations.  In addition, several full-time defenders have been engaging in private \npractice which will result in a reduction of their caseload limits by ten cases each.  Based \non these recent developments, the Supervising Attorney has recommended that the \nCounty add two more full-time defenders for the remainder of the year.  The County has \nrecently posted an advertisement for a full-time defender position and has already \nreceived several applications. \n \nWith Mr. Earl and Mr. Billingsley converted to full-time, the County is finally in \ncompliance with the Settlement Agreement’s requirement that it hire only full-time \ndefenders except as approved by the Monitor.  I hope that the County will find a suitable \ncandidate for its latest full-time opening.   Full-time defenders tend to be more engaged in \nthe defender program, visit clients more promptly and more frequently, and invest more \n2008 Quarterly Report - 2 of 14 \n\ntime in their Grant County cases.  Nonetheless, if the County is truly unable to find \nqualified candidates willing to work full-time, I will consider approving the use of part-\ntime defenders if necessary to avoid sacrificing the quality of represention.  \n \nThe Settlement Agreement establishes an annual caseload limit of 150 case equivalents.   \nThe purpose of caseload limits is to ensure that defenders have a manageable workload \nand are able to provide effective assistance of counsel to each client.  In order for annual \nlimits to be meaningful, case assignments must be spread somewhat evenly throughout \nthe year.  Accordingly, the County has adopted additional monthly and quarterly caseload \nlimits.  During the second quarter, the County failed to comply with its monthly caseload \nlimits with respect to four different defenders.  The County also exceeded its quarterly \nlimits for three defenders.  At the midpoint of the year, almost half of the County’s \ndefenders are on pace to exceed their annual caseload limit of 150. \n \nThe County’s failure to adhere to its monthly and quarterly limits had several causes.  \nFirst, the County did not hire a sufficient number of defenders at the start of the year.  I \nhad previously recommended that the County hire enough public defenders to provide at \nleast a 50 case cushion over projected needs.  This cushion is necessary to accommodate \nnormal increases in case assignments from year to year, caseload fluctuations during the \nyear, and unanticipated developments such as staff turnover.  For 2008, the County gave \nitself very little margin for error.  The decision to maintain minimal staffing levels was \nparticularly surprising in light of the myriad reasons to believe that 2007 case assignment \nstatistics significantly underestimated the actual number of cases handled by the \ndefenders.  I have detailed those reasons in prior reports and will not repeat them here. \n \nA second reason that the County was forced to overload its defenders is that the Court \nassigned an unusually large number of cases to the public defenders in May.  Case \nassignments for May were almost 30 case equivalents higher than in any other month this \nyear.  The surge in case assignments was due in part to a large number of arrests during a \nMemorial Day music festival at The Gorge.   \n \nFinally, the sudden loss of one of the full-time defenders due to poor health left the \nCounty understaffed.  Although the County was able to increase caseload capacity by \nconverting its part-time defenders to full-time and hiring a new full-time defender, those \nadjustments came too late to prevent the existing defenders from exceeding monthly and \nquarterly limits.   \n \nIn his most recent monthly report, Supervising Attorney Alan White projects that the \nCounty currently has the bare minimum staffing levels to cover anticipated case \nassignments for the remainder of the year.  He notes, however, that his projections do not \ntake into account the recent resignation of one of the full-time defenders or the reduced \ncaseload limits for defenders who engaged in private practice.  After adjusting the \nprojections to incorporate these factors, the County could lose as many as 75 additional \ncase equivalents in capacity.  Hiring a new full-time defender to start August 1 would add \nonly 62.5 case equivalents worth of capacity, and it seems unlikely that the County will \nbe able to get a new full-time defender on board that quickly.  Accordingly, the prudent \n2008 Quarterly Report - 3 of 14 \n\ncourse would be to follow Alan White’s recommendation to hire two additional full-time \ndefenders for the remainder of the year.   \n \nBy failing to protect against contingencies at the start of the year, the County has put \nitself in a difficult position in terms of hiring, however.  Projected case assignments for \n2009 based on assignments so far this year suggest that the County should have 9 full-\ntime defenders on staff for 2009.   Hiring two additional full-time defenders now would \ngive the County ten full-time defenders on staff.  Unless the County is able to hire one of \nthese full-time defenders on a temporary basis for the remainder of the year, it may start \n2009 significantly overstaffed.  \n \n \nTraining \n \nTraining opportunities in Grant County are limited due to the relatively small number of \nlocal criminal defense attorneys and the difficulty in convincing speakers to travel long \ndistances to speak at CLE sessions.  Despite these challenges, Supervising Attorney Alan \nWhite has been successful in arranging CLE presentations on a fairly regular basis.  He \nhas been particularly diligent this year in seeking trainings from the Washington \nDefender Association (WDA) and the Washington State Office of Public Defense.  \nDuring the second quarter, he arranged for WDA to offer a half-day CLE in Grant \nCounty covering such topics as search and seizure, working with investigators, and the \nimmigration consequences of criminal cases. \n \nGrant County has also been generous in its financial support for defenders interested in \ntravelling outside the County to attend trainings.  During the second quarter, the County \nsent one of its new full-time defenders to attend the two-week National Criminal Defense \nCollege (NCDC) in Macon, Georgia.  NCDC provides intensive trial training and is \nrecognized nationally as among the best training available for criminal defense attorneys. \n \nAlthough the County has been successful in obtaining training for its defenders from \noutside sources, I continue to believe that the County should do more “in-house” \ntrainings.  The majority of the County’s defenders have experience in other jurisdictions, \nand each is more than capable of providing training sessions for his or her colleagues.   It \nwould take little effort to organize presentations by the County’s own defenders every \nmonth or two. \n \n \nFirst Appearances \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that the County provide representation at initial \nappearances for all indigent defendants.  To fulfill this obligation, the County assigns \neach of its defenders to cover first appearances for a week at a time on a rotating basis \nthroughout the year.  Over time, the defenders have become far more consistent in \nproviding representation at first appearances.   \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 4 of 14 \n\nIn the past, the County has not consistently provided representation at first appearance for \nchild support defendants and out-of-custody defendants.  This problem resulted in part \nfrom the court’s practice of proceeding with hearings regardless of whether counsel was \npresent or not and in part from confusion among the defenders as to which hearings they \nwere expected to cover.  During the second quarter, the County remedied this problem by \nmaking clear to its defenders that they were to represent all defendants at first \nappearance, including those appearing on child support matters and in response to a \nsummons.  I have also observed more teamwork by the defenders who now jump in to \nassist defendants who have been called before the court without counsel.    \n \nIn addition to representing defendants in court, the coverage attorney is expected to visit \nin-custody defendants prior to court in order to obtain the information necessary to make \na bail reduction and/or release motion.  These visits tend to be short, averaging 5 to 10 \nminutes for most defenders.  During the second quarter of 2008, the Grant County \ndefenders were generally diligent in making jail visits prior to first appearances.  Indeed, \ndefenders made 20 or more first appearance jail visits during 7 different weeks.    \n \nAlthough it was definitely the exception rather than the rule, some defenders seem to \noccasionally take a day off from the required jail visits.  I found 5 days on which the \nassigned defender made no visits at all.  I have notified the Supervising Attorney of my \nfindings in this area and asked him to look into the matter further.  It should be noted, \nhowever, that even when the attorneys do not visit defendants in jail, they do typically \nmeet with the inmates prior to their hearings, either in the courtroom or in the secure \nhallway adjacent to the courtroom.   \n \n \nJail Visits  \n \nGrant County requires its defenders to make contact with all new clients within a week of \nassignment.  For in-custody clients, a jail visit is required.  The County’s written policy \non client contact makes clear that meeting with the client in the courtroom or in hallway \noutside the courtroom is not sufficient.  Moreover, the jail visit must take place prior to \narraignment “if at all practicable.”  \n \nTimely jail visits have been a persistent problem for the Grant County public defenders, \nand the second quarter was no exception.  I reviewed more than 75 in-custody cases \nassigned from April through June of this year and found that the Grant County defenders \nvisited their clients prior to arraignment only about a third of the time.  Approximately \n44% of those visits occurred on the day of arraignment.  Within a week of assignment, \ndefenders had visited about 46% of their in-custody clients.  Thus, during the second \nquarter, defenders complied with the County’s jail visit policy less than half the time. \n \n  April 2008  May 2008  June 2008  Average \nVisit before arraignment  37%  28%  40%  34% \nVisit within 1 week  48%  39%  56%  46% \n2008 Quarterly Report - 5 of 14 \n\n \nAlthough most in-custody defendants in Grant County eventually receive a visit from \ntheir attorneys, a surprising number do not.  In reviewing cases from April and May \n2008, I found 11 cases in which the Grant County defenders had not visited their in-\ncustody clients at all.  In 8 of these cases, the defendants pled guilty without ever \nreceiving a jail visit from the assigned attorney.  I found another 5 cases in which \ndefendants had to wait more than three weeks for an attorney visit.   Unfortunately, this is \nnot an isolated problem.  The 11 indigent defendants who never received a jail visit were \nrepresented by 5 different public defenders.   \n \nPart of the problem may be the County’s reliance on attorneys who reside outside of \nGrant County.1  Attorneys who commute 2-4 hours to Ephrata are unlikely to make a \nspecial trip just to visit a new client.  Moreover, when these attorneys are in Grant \nCounty, their schedules are typically packed, and I suspect that when their other \nobligations take longer than expected, jail visits end up postponed until the next trip.  \nAlthough I am convinced that commuting is a contributing factor to delays in jail visits, I \ndo not believe that it is the primary cause of this problem.  Indeed, one of the defenders \nwith a lengthy commute has actually been the most diligent in making timely jail visits \nwhile another defender who resides in Grant County almost never manages to visit his \nclients prior to arraignment. \n \nSeveral of the Grant County defenders simply do not appreciate the importance of \nvisiting their in-custody clients.  Some defenders note that they typically have a great \ndeal of “dead time” in court and that it is more efficient to meet with their in-custody \nclients in and around the courtroom.  They apparently view such meetings as a reasonable \nsubstitute for visiting clients at the jail.  I strongly disagree.  A system in which indigent \ndefendants are expected to see their attorneys only in the hallways outside of court on the \nday of their hearing is not one that values the rights of those defendants.  Indeed, such \nmeetings are one of the hallmarks of substandard public defense.   \n \nWhile this practice of meeting with clients in the corridor may save the attorneys time, it \ndoes so at the expense of their clients. A criminal defendant is entitled to sit down with \nhis attorney in a private setting to discuss his case at length, to ask questions about the \nevidence against him, his chances at trial, the punishment he faces, and how the process \nworks.  Each defendant should have at least one meeting with his attorney in which he \nneed not be concerned about whether others can overhear the conversation or whether the \nattorney will be called away at any moment to handle another case.  The average client \nwho speaks with his attorney while sitting in the jury box or standing in the hallway \noutside the courtroom has no idea that will be his only opportunity to consult with \ncounsel.  He may not share critical information with his attorney because he assumes, \nquite reasonably, that his attorney will visit him at the jail for a more confidential \nmeeting.   Visiting in-custody clients early in the representation helps the attorney to earn \nthe clients’ trust, identify potential defenses and issues that need investigation, and even \nrecognize subtle mental health issues that might not be apparent in brief hallway \nmeetings.    \n                                                 \n1 I recognize that the County has little choice but to rely on attorneys from other jurisdictions. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 6 of 14 \n\n \nI have urged the County to make timely jail visits a priority.  While the County has had a \nwritten policy in place for the last year, that policy has not been followed.  Moreover, to \nthe best of my knowledge, the County has not established any system for enforcing the \npolicy or monitoring compliance.  Unless and until the County takes this issue seriously, \nthese problems are likely to continue. \n \n \nInvestigator Staffing \n \nGrant County recently lost two of its five investigators.  I suspended approval of one \ninvestigator after learning he was facing criminal charges in another jurisdiction.  A \nsecond investigator suspended work because the County would not pay his bills. \n \nIn mid-June, I learned that the investigator I had approved approximately two months \nearlier was now being prosecuted in another County for:  1) Making a False Statement to a \nPublic Servant; 2) Criminal Trespass - 2nd Degree; and 3) Stalking.  After consulting with \nthe parties and carefully considering the matter, I decided to temporarily suspend my \napproval of the investigator.  Grant County strenuously objected to my decision and urged \nme to allow the investigator to keep working until the criminal charges against him were \nresolved.  I ultimately concluded, however, that it would be inappropriate to put indigent \ndefendants at risk by continuing to utilize the investigator in question. \n \nShortly afterward, a controversy over investigator invoicing that had been brewing for \nseveral months erupted into a full-blown crisis when the County refused to pay its \ninvestigators.  The crux of the dispute is the conflict between the ethical rules requiring \nattorneys to protect confidential information and the County’s need to fully account for \nthe expenditure of public funds.  Investigators in Grant County work under the direction \nof individual public defenders but submit their bills to the County through Supervising \nAttorney Alan White.  Mr. White reviews each investigator’s invoice to ensure that all \ncharges are necessary and appropriate, approves the invoices for payment, and then \nforwards the information to the County.  When submitting invoices to the County, \nhowever, Mr. White redacts client identifying information in order to avoid disclosure of \nconfidential information.  For each billing entry, the County is provided with the date, \ndescription of work performed, and the amount of time involved.  Only information \nwhich would identify the client is redacted.   Mr. White has concluded that redaction of \nconfidential information is required by RPC 1.6 as well as WSBA Formal Opinion 183, \nFormal Opinion 195, and Informal Opinion 2185.   I concur in Mr. White’s assessment. \n \nUntil about March of this year, Mr. White had submitted investigator billing to the \nCounty without redactions.  He changed this practice when representatives of the Grant \nCounty Prosecutor’s office indicated that they would begin seeking restitution from \nindigent defendants for the costs of investigating their cases.  Upon learning of this plan, \nMr. White became concerned that in forwarding the unredacted investigator invoices to \nthe County, he had been unintentionally revealing confidential information.  He was \nparticularly concerned that prosecutors could gain access to whatever he submitted to the \n2008 Quarterly Report - 7 of 14 \n\nCounty.  These fears appear to be well-founded in that the County insists that investigator \nbilling information is subject to public disclosure, and the Grant County Prosecutor has \ndemonstrated a propensity for gathering information about public defense using public \ndisclosure laws.  Accordingly, Mr. White concluded that he could not comply with the \nCounty’s invoicing requirements without providing evidence against the very indigent \ndefendants his staff represent. \n \nThe County has steadfastly maintained that it cannot pay invoices unless those invoices \ninclude not just the date, description of the work performed, and time spent on each \nactivity, but also the client name, case number, and attorney.  Although Mr. White has \nexplained that he cannot compromise when it comes to the ethical rules, the County has \nrepeatedly attempted to pressure him to comply with its invoicing requirements.  The \nCounty’s communications in this regard have been inappropriate.  On more than one \noccasion, the County has contacted the defense investigators directly and indicated that \nMr. White is to blame for the fact that they are not being paid.  The first time this \noccurred, Mr. White specifically requested that the County “stop communicating directly \nwith the investigators and telling them that I am holding up their compensation.”  Yet \nearlier this month, the County again wrote directly to the investigators that Mr. White \n“would rather you not get paid for your services – and have you stop working – than \nprovide the BOCC with invoices that clearly show where public monies are going.”  The \nCounty then urged the defenders and investigators to “bypass Alan” and submit \nunredacted invoices.  It is completely inappropriate for the County to undermine its \nSupervising Attorney in this way.  The County does not seem to understand that Mr. \nWhite’s position is a principled one and that he cannot violate the ethical rules even if it \nwould be the expedient thing to do. \n \nThe investigator situation is now somewhat desperate.  One investigator has already \nstopped work on Grant County cases until his invoices for past work are paid.  Another \nhas indicated that he plans to give priority to his other cases until the billing dispute is \nresolved.  Even if the other two investigators continue to work, the County has lost 40-\n50% of its capacity.  Only one of the remaining investigators is available to Grant County \non anything approaching a full-time basis.  The County recently asked that I approve \nthree additional investigators, but even if approved, the new investigators will face the \nsame problems getting paid as the current group.   \n \nIt is essential that all involved work expeditiously to resolve this matter.  I have proposed \ntwo potential compromises that I hope the County will consider.  My recommendation is \nto ask investigators to submit aggregate billing.  The investigators could detail the date, \nwork performed, and time spent but combine the information for multiple cases.  The \ncase names and numbers could be listed at the top of the invoice, and so long as \nindividual activities are not tied to a particular case, client confidentiality would be \nprotected.  The other alternative I have proposed is to submit investigator billing to the \ncourt for approval.  The court could then enter an order to seal the invoices in the court \nfile.  This would protect confidential information so long as the invoices and payment \nprocess were carefully designed to avoid inadvertently revealing client confidences.  \nIndeed I suspect that the reason confidentiality issues don’t create similar problems in \n2008 Quarterly Report - 8 of 14 \n\nother jurisdictions is that investigator payment is handled through the court or a quasi-\njudicial public defense administrator or agency. \n \n \nInvestigation Rates \n \nFor 2008, the overall rate of investigation has been 30%.  The rate of investigation is \ndown approximately 5% from last year.  Despite the overall decrease, most defenders \nappear to make appropriate use of investigators on their cases.   \n \nTwo defenders, however, rarely employ investigators, requesting investigation in only 11 \nout of 112 cases assigned to them.  They investigate 8% and 11% of their cases \nrespectively.  This level of investigation is unacceptable and raises serious questions \nabout the quality of the representation these defenders provide.  A third defender has \nrequested investigation in only 19% of cases which I also consider low.  By comparison, \nthe range for the remaining five defenders was 31% to 57%.  I have asked Supervising \nAttorney Alan White to again meet with the defenders with low rates of investigation to \nascertain the reasons for their failure to investigate more cases and to stress the \nimportance of investigation.    \n \n \nExperts \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that public defenders request experts via ex parte \nmotion and that the records relating to experts be sealed.  The Settlement Agreement \nfurther specifically provides that “[u]nder no circumstances may members of the Grant \nCounty Prosecuting Attorney’s Office be given access to motions for the appointment of \nexperts or to invoices submitted by experts to the County for payment.” \n \nIn reviewing court files during the second quarter, I found three cases in which Grant \nCounty public defenders sought experts.  In one case, the documents relating to the expert \nwere appropriately sealed in the court file, and as a result, I was unable to learn anything \nabout the expert in that case.  In the two other cases, however, defenders did not properly \nseal their expert pleadings. \n \nIn the first instance, the defender did request that the expert papers be sealed in the court \nfile.  The problem appears to have been a procedural one.  The defender submitted a \nmotion and order to seal but failed to identify the documents to be sealed with sufficient \nspecificity.  As a result, although the court signed the order to seal, it was not clear to the \nclerk’s office which documents were to be sealed.  An order to seal must contain the \nexact title of the document(s) to be sealed and must be clearly be marked in the caption \nwith the phrase “[CLERK’S ACTION REQUIRED].”  Because the order to seal in this \ncase was carelessly drafted, confidential information about the client’s defense is \navailable to anyone who reviews the public court file. \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 9 of 14 \n\nIn the second instance, the defense filed what was termed an “Ex Parte Motion for \nFormal Examination of Defendant’s Mental Condition.”   Neither the motion nor the \nresulting order was sealed.  It appears that no motion to seal was ever filed.  The request \nitself is confusing because it appears that rather than appointment of an expert, the \ndefense was actually requesting that the defendant be evaluated by Eastern State \nHospital.  Although the motion is identified as ex parte, the prosecutor seems to have had \nnotice of the motion as he signed the resulting order.  The declaration in support of the \nmotion indicates that the defendant was having hallucinations, identifies the medication \nhe had been taking, and relates that the defendant had previously been diagnosed as a \n“borderline sociopath.”  The declaration itself states that the attorney had permission to \ndisclose these facts, but presumably the client’s authorization was limited to only those \ndisclosures necessary for his defense.  The defense attorney should have sought to submit \nthis declaration under seal or make oral representations in camera.  Moreover, I cannot \nimagine a scenario in which a diagnosis of “borderline sociopath” could possibly be \nhelpful to the defense.  Because no effort was made to protect the client’s private medical \ninformation, the details of his mental health issues are now part of the public record. \n \n \nMotions Practice \n \nIn reviewing court files, I again found several written motions filed by the defenders, \nthough not as many as I found last quarter.  I reviewed two suppression motions, a \nmotion to compel discovery, and a motion to reduce bond.  The suppression motions \ncould have been better tailored to the individual cases.  The motion to compel discovery \nwas very basic, but the issues involved did not call for anything more.  Finally, I was \npleasantly surprised to find a written bond motion as that is fairly unusual to see in a \npublic defense case.  \n \nTo improve their motions practice, the defenders need to file motions more often and do \nso earlier in the case.  I routinely see legal issues that could form the basis for strong \nsuppression or Knapstad motions but are never formally raised.  Perhaps the defenders \nsimply aren’t recognizing the issues, but the problem is more likely one of approach.  \nWith a motions hearing typically set shortly before trial, the defenders rarely file written \nbriefs early in the case and almost never prior to the pre-trial hearing at which most cases \nare resolved.  As a result, many defendants plead guilty before their motions can be \nlitigated, particularly defendants who have the opportunity to be released from custody.  \nThe defenders may not be able to persuade many clients to stay in jail an extra week or \ntwo to argue a potentially winning motion, but they can improve their negotiating posture \nby simply filing a brief.  Filing a brief, a substantive brief tailored to the case, not a \ngeneric throw-away brief, tells the prosecutor that the defense is serious about the \nmotion.  Even if the defense attorney knows he or she will never have the opportunity to \nargue the motion, the prosecutor does not.  As a result, the prosecutor must at least \nconsider the possibility that the defendant actually intends to pursue the motion, could \nwin it, and in any case will cost the prosecutor valuable time and effort that could be \nbetter spent on other cases.   \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 10 of 14 \n\n \nOverall Quality of Representation \n   \nThe quality of representation provided to indigent defendants in Grant County remains \ninconsistent.   Overall quality has improved but there are still vast differences in the \nrepresentation provided from defender to defender and from case to case.   \n \nFirst and foremost, some of the Grant County defenders need to focus on the basics.  \nVisit clients.  Investigate cases.  File motions.  Some defenders do seem to appreciate the \nimportance of these tasks.  Others seem stuck in a mindset more appropriate to \nmisdemeanor level practice where overwhelming caseloads often force public defenders \nto deal with cases on the fly.   \n \nThere are, however, signs of progress.  The most promising indicator of improved \nrepresentation in Grant County is the trial rate.  The Grant County public defenders had 5 \njury trials in the second quarter.  For the year, the defenders have already had 11 trials, \nsurpassing the total for all of 2007.  Five of the current defenders have gone to trial so far \nthis year, two defenders who returned from last year and three who are new to the \nprogram.  I am extremely pleased that the defenders are going to trial more frequently \nthan in the past and hope that the trend continues.  More than anything else, a willingness \nto fight for clients by going to trial when appropriate tends to raise the defender’s level of \npractice, helps to compensate for any inadequacies that may exist in other areas, and \neventually improves outcomes for all clients. \n \nAs in previous quarters, I had concerns about the quality of representation provided in a \nnumber of specific cases I reviewed.  In one such case, a 51 year old man with no felony \nhistory was charged with Forgery, based on his possession of a forged Permanent \nResident Card, and two misdemeanors.  The court file in this matter revealed a host of \nproblems.  The statement of probable cause contained several potential suppression issues \nthat were never raised.  The defendant, who had no formal education and needed an \ninterpreter to understand the proceedings against him, ultimately pled guilty as charged to \nhis first felony.  During his 32 days in custody, his attorney had never bothered to visit \nhim in jail, never requested an investigator.  Indeed, court records suggest that the \nassigned attorney paid little attention to the case.  The attorney not only pled him guilty \nto the felony but also to both misdemeanors, including one that was actually dismissed at \nsentencing.  The plea form contained no recommendation at all from the prosecutor.  The \nspace for the prosecutor’s recommendation was blank.  At the time he pled guilty, the \ndefendant’s motions hearing was only ten days away.  The defendant had an immigration \nhold and was thus unlikely to be released upon pleading guilty regardless of the sentence \nimposed.  This defendant had very little to lose by going to trial.2  Filing a suppression \n                                                 \n2 If the defendant had wanted to simply get the criminal case over with so that he could deal with his \nimmigration issues, the defense attorney should have noted a motion for change of plea much earlier in the \ncase.  Perhaps if he had visited the client at some point, that is precisely what would have occurred.  \nRegardless of whether this should have been an early guilty plea or a trial, this client was not well served \nby his public defender’s decision to do little to nothing on the case except show up for court. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 11 of 14 \n\nmotion and/or threatening trial may very well have resulted in a misdemeanor offer.  If \nnot, this case should have gone to trial. \n \nIn addition, I found several other cases in which defendants pled guilty to felony charges \neven though the cases against them were weak or overcharged, and they had nothing to \nlose by going to trial or at least threatening to do so.  In one case, the defendant entered a \nguilty plea to a felony six days after being assigned counsel.  His sentencing range was 2-\n5 months, and he was sentenced to 3.5 months.  The case was weak, and had he waited, it \nseems very likely that the defendant would have received a misdemeanor offer.  If not, \nthe case should have gone to trial.  In another case, the facts presented in the statement of \nprobable cause to support a drug possession charge were likely insufficient to survive a \nKnapstad motion.  The defendant pled guilty to the felony and received a 7 month \nsentence.  No motion was ever filed.  The case should have been dismissed, resolved as a \nmisdemeanor, or taken to trial.   \n \nDespite my misgivings about the cases described above, the improved trial rate for Grant \nCounty defenders is a very positive sign.  I hope that the defenders will continue to \nembrace a more aggressive style of representation, including both frequent trials and an \nactive motions practice.   \n \n \nSupervising Attorney \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires the Monitor to oversee and evaluate the performance \nof the Supervising Attorney.  While I still have reservations about Mr. White’s \nmanagerial skills, overall, I continue to be satisfied with his performance as Supervising \nAttorney.  He is very well-liked, a good administrator, and is generally available to and \nsupportive of the defenders he supervises.  Moreover, he is always receptive to \nconstructive criticism and seems eager to improve as a supervisor. \n \nMr. White’s primary weaknesses relate to monitoring attorney performance and \nenforcing discipline.  At the start of the year and again after the first quarter, I identified \nseveral recurring problems in the defender program and asked Mr. White to make \naddressing these issues a priority.  More specifically, I asked Mr. White to monitor \nattorney performance on jail visits, investigation, and motions practice, and to take steps \nto correct any deficiencies he discovered.  My goal was to give Mr. White clear notice as \nto the criteria I would be using to evaluate him. \n \nOver the last two quarters, I have been disappointed in Mr. White’s efforts to address \nthese persistent problems.  He has good intentions, but so far, his follow through has been \nlacking.  He has not monitored attorney performance in any systematic way and does not \nhave a good sense of which attorneys are visiting clients, investigating cases, and filing \nmotions and which are not.  This must change.  The Supervising Attorney should know \nthe quality of representation being provided by his defenders.  He should know their \nstrengths and weaknesses and work to help them improve their practices.   \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 12 of 14 \n\nIn the future, I hope that Mr. White will take a more proactive and systematic approach to \nevaluating attorney performance.  I have discussed with him a number of specific ideas \nabout how this can be accomplished, and I am optimistic that he will devote more \nattention to these issues in the third quarter.  The County recently hired a separate \nsupervisor for juvenile and district court, allowing Mr. White to focus his efforts \nexclusively on the Superior Court defender program.  This change in responsibilities is a \nvery positive development and should allow Mr. White more time to mentor defenders as \nwell as monitor the problem areas described above.    \n \n \nClient Complaints \n \nAlan White maintains a toll-free telephone line for client complaints.  Instructions on \nhow to contact Mr. White to make a complaint are posted in several locations at the jail \nand included in a flyer distributed to out-of-custody defendants at arraignment.  Calls to \nthe complaint line are logged by Mr. White’s assistant and referred to Mr. White or the \nassigned defender for follow-up.  Many calls to the complaint line are not complaints at \nall.  Defendants often call with requests for information or messages for their assigned \nattorneys.   When complaints are more substantive, Mr. White investigates the matter, \nincluding visiting the defendant at the jail if necessary, and occasionally writes formal \nreports to the County detailing the results of his investigation.   \n \nThe County has had ongoing problems with the complaint line due to the configuration of \nthe jail phone system.  Those issues now appear to have been resolved.  In the fourth \nquarter of 2007, there were 143 calls to County complaint line in which inmates were \nunable to leave a message or even their names.  In the first quarter of this year, the \nnumber of such calls was down to 47 as the County made adjustments to the jail phone \nsystem mid-quarter.  This quarter, these calls were eliminated completely.  \n \nDuring the second quarter, calls to the complaint line generally fell into the following \ncategories: \n   \n# Calls  Nature of call \n19  Trying to contact attorney/request for attorney contact information \n14  Request to speak with Alan White/Alan White took call \n9  Request for name of assigned attorney \n9  Substantive Complaint \n8  Request for attorney contact/visit \n5  Request for a new attorney \n5  Message for assigned attorney \n5  Question about case \n \nSome of the calls fell into more than one category.  For example, 4 of the callers with \nsubstantive complaints also requested a new attorney.  In addition, many clients called \nmore than once with the same or similar complaints.  As a result, the figures above \nshould be used only to understand the types of calls received and not as a measure of \n2008 Quarterly Report - 13 of 14 \n\nclient satisfaction.  Overall, the number of dissatisfied clients appears to have been \nrelatively small in the second quarter. \n \nThe one caveat to this assessment is that when clients do complain about their \nrepresentation, the current system does not adequately track the precise nature of the \ncomplaint or how it was resolved.  For calls to Alan White, the complaint log rarely \nreflects the substance of the client’s concern.  Mr. White usually speaks to the client \ndirectly either by phone or in person at the jail.  It would be helpful to have more details \nabout these calls.  Similarly, the calls raising substantive complaints about the \nrepresentation as well as calls with requests for a new attorney are often recorded as \nvague statements like “[Attorney X] is not doing what he can” or “[Attorney Y] lied to \nhim.”  Again, it would be helpful if some more detailed record were kept of the nature of \nthe complaint. \n \n \nConflicts of Interest \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires both the Supervising Attorney and each defender to \nhave a conflicts-check system.  These procedures must be approved by the Monitor.  \nAlan White recently submitted his conflicts check system along with that of several of the \ndefenders for my approval.  I have not yet had the opportunity to review those conflicts \ncheck procedures. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn my last report, I concluded by writing: \n \nIn the next quarter, I hope to see substantial improvement with respect to jail \nvisits, greater use of investigation by some defenders, and more defenders \nbringing motions and going to trial. \n \nThe progress I had hoped for simply did not materialize this quarter.  Nonetheless, I \nremain optimistic that performance will improve in the coming months. \n \n \n \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 14 of 14 ",

Plaintiffs Best, Campos, Hutt and Hansen filed a complaint on Apri14, 2004 \n4 \n5  seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to remedy alleged deficiencies in Grant County's \n6 \n7  public defense system. \n8 \n9  2.  Grant County denied and continues to deny that there were any deficiencies \n10 \n11  in its public defense system. \n12 \n13  3.  The Court entered an order on September 13,2004 certifying a plaintiff class \n]4 \n15  consisting of \"[a]l1 indigent persons who have or will have criminal felony cases pending in \n16 \n17  Grant County Superior Court, who are appointed an attorney, and who have not entered into \n18 \n19  a plea agreement or been convicted. f! \n20 \n21  4.  The Court issued a Memorandum Decision on October 14,2005, in which the \n22 \n23  Court denied the County's motion for summary judgment, granted in part the plaintiffs' two \n24 \n25  motions for partial summary judgment, found that class members have a well-grounded fear \n26 \n27  of immediate invasion of their rights to effective assistance of counsel, did not rule on \n28 \n29  whether the Grant County public defense system actually deprives class members of \n30 \n31  effective assistance of counsel, and ruled that the trial should focus on devising a public \n32 \n33  defense system that protects class members' rights.  A copy of the Memorandum Decision is \n34 \n35  attached hereto as Appendix A. \n36 \n37  5.  The Parties believe that settlement of this lawsuit is in the best interests of all \n38 \n39  parties. \n40 \n41  AGREEMENT \n42 \n43  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual obligations and agreements \n44 \n45  contained herein, and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby \n46 \n47  acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows: \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT -2  Seattle, Washington 98101-3099 \n[2561O-0031-000000lSettlement Agreement 110205 Signed Final (2)J  Phone: (206) 359-8000 \nFax: (206) 359-9000 \n\n1  I.

The \"Monitor\" is the individual selected under Section ill of this Agreement. \n26 \n27  E.  The \"Effective Date\" of this Agreement shall be the date on which the Court \n28 \n29  enters an order approving the settlement pursuant to CR 23. \n30 \n31  II.  THE PUBLIC DEFENSE SYSTEM \n32 \n33  A.  Commitment to Provide Effective Assistance of Counsel \n34 \n35  Grant County agrees to maintain and operate a public defense system that provides \n36 \n37  effective assistance of counsel to all indigent persons charged with felony crimes in Grant \n38 \n39  County. \n40 \n41  B.  Supervising Attorney \n42 \n43 \n1.  Grant County shall contract with or hire a full-time Supervising Attorney. \n44 \n45 \nThe Supervising Attorney shall supervise the public defense system on behalf of Grant \n46 \n47 \nCounty.  The Supervising Attorney's duties shall include but not be limited to: selecting \nPerkins Coie UP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT -3  Seattle, Washington 98101-3099 \n[256 10·003 l'()OOOOO/Settlement Agreement 110205 Signed Final (2)]  Phone:  (206) 359-8000 \nFax: (206) 359-9000 \n\npublic defenders; drafting and negotiating contracts with public defenders; establishing \n1 \n2 \npolicies and procedures for public defense; assigning felony cases to public defenders in \n3 \n4 \naccordance with this Agreement; supervising, training and mentoring public defenders; \n5 \n6 \npreparing reports concerning the public defense system; reviewing and tracking caseloads; \n7 \n8 \nestablishing perfonnance guidelines; responding to client complaints; ensuring that public \n9 \n10 \ndefenders provide effective assistance of counsel; and providing information to the Monitor, \nII \n12 \nto the Board of County Commissioners and (if needed) to the Grant County Superior Court. \n13 \n14 \nThe Supervising Attorney shall not maintain his or her own case load, except to act as co-\n15 \n16 \ncounsel to other pnblic defenders in accordance with this Agreement.  The Supervising \n17 \n18 \nAttorney shall not engage in any private practice. \n19 \n20 \n2.  The Supervising Attorney shall have experience in public defense, shall be \n21 \n22 \nqualified to handle Class A felonies within the meaning of the WSBA-Endorsed Standards \n23 \n24 \nand shall be qualified to fulfill the duties set forth herein.  Grant County shall contract with \n25 \n26 \nor hire Alan White as the Supervising Attorney in 2006, with the understanding that he may \n27 \n28 \nrequire training and will require supervision and mentoring by the Monitor, in order to \n29 \n30 \nadequately carry out his supervisory duties.  The compensation paid to the Supervising \n31 \n32 \nAttorney shall be not less than the compensation paid to Alan White in 2005, adjusted for \n33 \n34 \ncost of living increases as approved by the Board of County Commissioners equally for all \n35 \n36 \nrepresented and unrepresented employees.  If in the future Grant County opts for an in-house \n37 \n38 \npublic defense system, the compensation and benefits paid to the Supervising Attorney shall \n39 \n40 \nbe comparable to those of the Grant County Prosecuting Attorney. \n41 \n42 \n3.  The Monitor will oversee and assess the Supervising Attorney's performance \n43 \n44 \nand may conduct or recommend training on supervising a public defense system.  The \n45 \n46 \n47  Monitor may recommend the Supervising Attorney's termination if the Monitor determines \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT -4  Seattle, Washington 98101-3099 \n[25610-0031-000000lSettIement Agreement 110205 Signed Final (2)]  Phone:  (206) 359-8000 \nFax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\nthat the Supervising Attorney lacks the skills, ability or other attributes necessary to \n2 \nsupervise the public defense system.  If for any reason Alan White's role as Supervising \n3 \n4 \nAttorney ceases, the County shall promptly contract with or hire a replacement Supervising \n5 \n6 \nAttorney.  The Monitor must approve any such replacement in writing. \n7 \n8 \n4.  The Supervising Attorney must establish a complaint system that affords and \n9 \n10 \ninforms all indigent criminal defendants of the right to make complaints regarding the \n11 \n12 \nquality of their public defense.  This system must include a toll-free telephone line with a \n13 \n14 \nmessage system in English and Spanish. All complaints shall be promptly logged and \n15 \n16 \ninvestigated and be provided to the Monitor for review.  Priority complaints shall include, \n17 \n18 \nbut not be limited to: \n19 \n20 \na.  failure to meet and interview defendants promptly; \n21 \n22 \nb.  failure to fully inform clients at all stages of the defense; and \n23 \n24 \nc.  failure to investigate cases. \n25 \n26 \n27  C.  Training and Qualifications of Public Defenders \n28 \n29  1.  Grant County shall hire or contract with enough full-time public defenders to \n30 \n31  handle all felony case assignments in accordance with the caseload limitations set forth in \n32 \n33  the following Section D of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grant County \n34 \n35  may contract with or hire up to two (2) part-time public defenders with prior approval of the \n36 \n37  Monitor. \n38 \n39  2.  All public defenders must satisfy the NLADA Performance Guidelines for \n40 \n41  Criminal Defense Representation, attached as Appendix C to this Agreement. \n42 \n43  3.  No public defender may be assigned to handle a case that he or she is not \n44 \n45  qualified to handle according to the WSBA-Endorsed Standards. Notwithstanding the \n46 \n47  foregoing, with the approval of both the Supervising Attorney and the Monitor, a public \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT - 5  Seattle, Washington 98101-3099 \n[2561 O-OO3I-000000/Settiement Agreement 1l 0205 Signed Final (2)]  Phone: (206) 359-8000 \nFax:  (206) 359-9000 \n\ndefender may be assigned up to five (5) cases each year for which he or she lacks the \n1 \n2 \nrequisite qualifications under the WSBA-Endorsed Standards, provided that: (a) no lawyer \n3 \n4 \nwith less than two (2) years of felony prosecution or defense experience may be assigned a \n5 \n6 \nClass A felony or persistent offender case under any circumstance; (b) the Supervising \n7 \n8 \nAttorney must co-counsel with the public defender on all aspects of the case; and (c) the \n9 \n10 \nassignment of such a case must receive advance written approval from the Monitor.  Under \nII \n12 \nno circumstances will a public defender be assigned a death penalty case unless the public \n13 \n14 \ndefender meets the minimum professional qualification standards of the WSBA-Endorsed \n15 \n16 \nStandards. \n17 \n18 \n4.  Until qualified under the WSBA-Endorsed Standards, Jeffrey Goldstein and \n19 \n20 \nElizabeth Vasiliades may only be assigned up to 130 Class C felony case equivalents each, \n21 \n22 \nprovided that the Monitor approves the case assignments or the assignments conform to \n23 \n24 \nguidelines established by the Monitor.  Under no circumstances may Mr. Goldstein or Ms. \n25 \n26 \nVasiliades be assigned a Class B, Class A or persistent offender felony unless qualified to \n27 \n28 \nhandle the case according to the WSBA-Endorsed Standards. \n29 \n30 \n5.  The County shall in no event hire or otherwise contract with the persons \n31 \n32 \nlisted on Exhibit A (which is to be filed under seal) to provide indigent defense services. \n33 \n34 \nThe County agrees to prohibit all public defenders from hiring the persons listed on Exhibit \n35 \n36 \nA or to in any way employ them in connection with any matter related to the public defense \n37 \n38 \nsystem. \n39 \n40 \n6.  The public defense system and each public defender shall satisfy the NLADA \n41 \n42 \nDefender Training and Development Standards, attached to this Agreement as Appendix D, \n43 \n44 \nexcept where inconsistent with this Agreement or determined to be not applicable by the \n45 \n46 \n47 \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT - 6  Seattle, Washington 98101-3099 \n[256 JO-O031-000000/Settlement Agreement 11 0205 Signed Final (2)]  Phone: (206) 359-8000 \nFax: (206)359-9000 \n\nSupervising Attorney and the Monitor.  The Supervising Attorney shall be responsible for \nI \n2 \nensuring that training requirements are satisfied. \n3 \n4 \n5  D.  Caseloads of Public Defenders \n6 \n7  1.  Each public defender's caseload shall in no event exceed 150 case equivalents \n8 \n9  per year.  The County shall prohibit full-time public defenders from engaging in private \n10 \n1I  practice, provided however, that a full-time public defender may maintain a limited private \n12 \n13  practice not to exceed 120 hours per year, provided that (i) the private practice does not \n14 \n15  interfere with the performance of his or her duties, (ii) there is a reduction of 10 case \n16 \n17  equiValents in the public defender's maximum caseload limit, and (iii) the private practice is \n18 \n19  approved in advance by both the Supervising Attorney and the Monitor. \n20 \n21  2.  Case equivalents shall be calculated as follows: \n22 \n23 \n24  Type of Case  Case equivalent \n25  Material witness  113 case equivalent \n26 \nProbation violation  113 case equivalent \n27 \n28  Contempt  1 case equivalent \n29 \n30  First or second degree murder  2 case equivalents \n31  Extraordinary cases  1 case equivalent for each 15 hours \n32  spent on case \n33 \nAll felony cases not  1 case equivalent \n34 \nenumerated above \n35 \n36 \n3.  The following cases will be considered \"extraordinary cases\" for the purposes \n37 \n38 \nof determining case equivalents: \n39 \n40 \na.  Persistent offender cases; \n41 \n42 \nb.  Fraud cases that have over five (5) counts or where the total alleged \n43 \n44 \nloss exceeds $250,000; \n45 \n46 \nc.  Aggravated murder cases with or without a death notice; and \n47 \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT -7  Seattle, Washington 98101-3099 \n[2561 O-OO31-OOOOOOISettlement Agreement 110205 Signed Final (2)]  Phone: (206) 359·8000 \nFax: (206) 359·9000 \n\nd.  Any other case determined by the Supervising Attorney, subject to \nI \n2 \n3  review by the Monitor, to be extraordinary in light of the amount and complexity of \n4 \nthe evidence, complexity of the legal issues, number of defendants, length of trial, or \n5 \n6 \nsimilar factors. \n7 \n8 \n9  E.  Compensation and Payment for Services Other than an Attorney \nIO \n11  1.  Compensation. Each full-time public defender's yearly compensation may \n12 \n13  vary according to his or her experience and qualifications, as long as the average yearly \n14 \n15  compensation for all public defenders is at least $97,500 in 2006.  The Supervising \n16 \n17  Attorney's compensation shall not be included in calculating the average yearly \n18 \n19  compensation for public defenders.  Part-time public defenders will receive no less than \n20 \n21  $650 per case equivalent in compensation.  In addition to the yearly compensation, Grant \n22 \n23  County shall pay each public defender $350 per diem for each day (or portion thereof) in \n24 \n25  trial.  The yearly compensation and per diem amount will be adjusted for cost of living \n26 \n27  increases as approved by the Board of County Commissioners equally for all represented \n28 \n29  and unrepresented employees during the period of the Agreement.  If at any time during the \n30 \n31  term of this Agreement Grant County creates an in-house public defense system, public \n32 \n33  defenders under that system must receive compensation and benefits comparable to their \n34 \n35  counterparts at the Grant County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. \n36 \n37  2.  Investigators:  Grant County shall provide funds for one (1) full-time \n38 \n39  investigator for every four (4) full-time public defenders.  Investigators shall be paid by the \n40 \n41  County from funds separate from those that pay public defender compensation.  The County \n42 \n43  shall pay for additional investigators as needed to:  (a) avoid conflicts of interest on the part \n44 \n45  of any full-time investigator contracted with or hired by the County; and (b) ensure that a \n46 \n47  ratio of one (1) full-time investigator for every four (4) full-time public defenders is \nPerkins Coie LLP \n1201 Third Avenue, Suite 4800 \nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT -8  Seattle, Washington 98101-3099 \n[2561 O-OO31-OOOO00/SeUlement Agreement 110205 Signed Final (2)]  Phone:  (206) 359-8000 \nFax: (206) 359-9000 \n\nmaintained.  (Thus, for example, if the County contracts with or hires six (6) full-time public \n1 \n2 \n3  defenders, then the County must provide the services of one full-time investigator plus \n4 \nanother 20 hours per week, on average, of investigative services from other sources.) Each \n5 \n6 \npublic defender shall have the authority to retain an investigator with approval of the \n7 \n8 \n9  Supervising Attorney and shall not be required to seek court approval of the retention of an \n10 \ninvestigator.  Before the County or a public defender may contract with or hire any \n11 \n12 \n13  investigator, the Monitor shall review the investigator's experience and qualifications and \n14 \ndetermine that the contracting or hiring of the investigator for felony defense investigations \n15 \n16 \nis appropriate.  In determining the qualifications of the investigator, the Monitor shall take \n17 \n18 \ninto consideration his or her ability to speak Spanish. \n19 \n20 \n3.  Experts.  Grant County shall pay reasonable compensation for expert \n21 \n22 \nwitnesses necessary for the defense of indigent defendants, including investigation, \n23 \n24 \n25  preparation and trial of a case.  Expert witness fees shall be allocated from funds separate \n26 \n27  from those provided for public defender compensation and the County will not limit such \n28 \nfunds in any way.  The budget for expert witness fees shall have no impact on selection or \n29 \n30 \ncontracting or hiring of experts.  Public defenders shall obtain funds for expert witness fees \n31 \n32 \nby ex parte motion to the Grant County Superior Court.

      "title": "Monitor's Report, Fourth Quarter 2008",
      "text": "Best, et al. v. Grant County \n \nMonitor’s Report \n \nFourth Quarter, 2008 \n \nJanuary 26, 2009 \n \nSubmitted by Francisco Rodriguez, Settlement Monitor \n \n \nMonitor’s Activities \n \nI continue to visit Grant County about once a month.  During the fourth quarter, I \ntravelled to Ephrata on three separate occasions:   \n \n•\n  October 6-7, 2008 \n•\n  November 3-4, 2008 \n•\n  December 1-2, 2008 \n \nWhile in Ephrata, I observed court proceedings, reviewed court files, and met with public \ndefenders.  Between site visits, I maintain regular contact with the Supervising Attorney \nand have periodic contact with individual defenders, investigators, and counsel for both \nparties.  \n \nIn addition to my regular activities, during the fourth quarter, I had several meetings in \nSeattle relating to approvals required by the Settlement Agreement.  On October 14, \n2008, I met with counsel for both parties, Supervising Attorney Alan White, and one of \nthe Grant County Commissioners to discuss Grant County’s proposal for an in-house \npublic defense system.  On November 5, 2008, I met with attorney Jeff Goldman \nregarding Grant County’s request that Mr. Goldman be approved as a part-time public \ndefender.  Finally, on November 21, 2008, I met at length with attorney Ray Gonzales \nregarding Grant County’s request that he be approved as the new Supervising Attorney. \n \nDue to past problems with jail visits, I now review case assignments and jail visitation \nlogs each quarter to determine whether the Grant County public defenders are visiting \ntheir in-custody clients in a timely fashion.  During the second half of 2008, I began \nsystematically reviewing electronic court dockets for cases assigned to Grant County’s \npublic defenders in order to evaluate defender motions practice, use of experts, and case \noutcomes.  I continued this practice in the fourth quarter, gathering data for both the \nquarter and the year. \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 1 of 16 \n\n \nAccess to Information \n \nThe Settlement Agreement provides that the Monitor shall have broad access to \ninformation concerning the Grant County public defense system.  Supervising Attorney \nAlan White and his assistant Aracely Yanez have always been very cooperative in \nproviding whatever information I request of them.  The Grant County Superior Court \nClerk’s Office also continues to be exceptionally helpful in locating and proving access \nto court files.   \n \n \n2007-08 Compliance \n \nI understand that the parties continue to work toward a stipulated resolution regarding \nGrant County’s compliance with the Settlement Agreement in 2007.  I do not believe the \nparties have begun discussions regarding compliance in 2008.  In June, I submitted a \n2008 Compliance Report detailing my findings and recommendations relating to two \nviolations that occurred earlier this year.  The violations related to proper accounting for \ncase credits on contempt cases and private practice by several of Grant County’s public \ndefenders.   Now that we have reached year’s end, I expect that the parties will attempt to \nreach agreement as to Grant County’s compliance in 2008 and whether the violations \nfound in June have been cured.   \n \n \nAttorney Staffing \n \nGrant County’s defender staffing underwent only minor changes in the fourth quarter.  \nRyan Earl, who had resigned in July, finished his contract during the fourth quarter.  \nAlthough he was technically still on contract for the month of October, he was assigned \nno new cases during his last month and had already been replaced by Melissa \nMacDougall in September.  The departure of Mr. Earl and arrival of Ms. MacDougall \nseems to have gone smoothly. \n \nThe only other staffing change during the quarter was the addition of Jeff Goldman as a \ntemporary part-time defender.  Grant County hired Mr. Goldman on a temporary basis for \nNovember and December in order to provide additional caseload flexibility in the event \nits other defenders approached their annual caseload limits.  Mr. Goldman ended up \nreceiving relatively few case assignments during his two month tenure. \n \nWhile staffing in the fourth quarter was relatively stable, Grant County faces substantial \nstaff turnover during the next few months.  Four full-time defenders submitted their \nresignations in December, making staffing for 2009 a serious concern.  Brian Gwinn, \nMike Haas, Melissa MacDougall, and Mike Prince are all leaving Grant County to do \npublic defense work in Okanogan County.  The impact of these departures will be \nsignificant.  All were assigned class A felonies in 2008.  Brian Gwinn was the longest \ntenured public defender in Grant County and served as acting supervisor whenever Alan \n2008 Quarterly Report - 2 of 16 \n\nWhite was on vacation or away for training.  Mike Haas is a very talented defender who \nhad more jury trials than any other defender in 2008.  Mike Prince and Melissa \nMacDougall were both highly regarded as well.  With these resignations, Grant County is \nlosing almost half of its defenders at once and the only three defenders who actually \nresided in Grant County.   Grant County faces a daunting challenge in finding qualified \nreplacements for the departing defenders in a very short period of time.1   \n \n \nCaseloads \n \nConsistent with Washington State Bar standards, the Settlement Agreement sets an \nannual caseload limit of 150 case equivalents.   In addition, the County has adopted \nmonthly and quarterly limits to ensure that case assignments are distributed relatively \nevenly throughout the year.  During the fourth quarter, the County observed its quarterly \nlimit for all of its defenders.  The County also observed its monthly limit with two \nexceptions.  In October, Melisssa MacDougall (19 credits) and Mike Prince (18.66 \ncredits) both exceeded the monthly limit of 16 case credits.  Ms. MacDougall’s high \nOctober caseload was due to her involvement in a lengthy trial which entitled her to \nextraordinary credits.  Mr. Prince’s October caseload was higher than normal due in part \nto the fact that probation violation assignments were well above average for the month, \nand he was assigned to cover those calendars.  Mr. Prince also received the second \nhighest number of felony assignments for the month, however, so his caseload could have \nbeen better managed. \n \nGrant County also appears to have met annual caseload limits.2  When reconciling the \nDecember case assignments, Supervising Attorney Alan White found that both Ms. \nMacDougall and Mr. Prince had slightly exceeded their annual caseload limits for 2008.  \nUpon discovering the error, Mr. White immediately reassigned a total of three cases to \nbring both attorneys within the specified limits.  I do not believe the quality of \nrepresentation provided by these attorneys suffered due to the error.  Nonetheless, the \nSupervising Attorney should be careful in monitoring caseloads at year’s end, particularly \nwhen several other attorneys had substantial caseload capacity remaining. \n \nDistributing cases evenly among the defenders proved to be a challenge in 2008.  While \nfour defenders reached their annual caseload limits, the other five finished the year with \nanywhere from 9 to 21 case credits remaining.  An average month’s caseload is 12.5 \ncredits.  Three defenders had more than 18 unused credits at the end of the year.  An \n                                                 \n1 The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the departing defenders took over the Okanogan County \npublic defense contract on January 1, 2009, forcing at least some of them to carry two caseloads for a \nperiod of time.  I have urged the parties to discuss how best to handle this situation as private practice is \nprohibited by the Settlement Agreement.   \n \n2 I understand that whether Grant County complied with the annual caseload limits and other issues \ndiscussed in this report may be the subject of future disputes between the parties.  I have not fully \ninvestigated these matters.  My conclusions here reflect my preliminary impressions based upon the \ninformation currently available to me and are not intended to finally resolve the matter.  I will resolve any \ndisputes if and when they are submitted to me by the parties.   \n2008 Quarterly Report - 3 of 16 \n\nadequately staffed public defender system will often have excess capacity at the end of \nthe year because of the need to protect against caseload fluctuations.  The problem here \nwas not excess staffing.  The problem was the significant variation in case assignments \namong the defenders.  One defender should not be assigned 20 more case credits than \nanother.   \n \nBalancing case assignments has been difficult in Grant County for several reasons.  First, \nSupervising Attorney Alan White had to assign cases to attorneys with five different \nannual caseload limits.  Some had the default of 150.  Others were reduced to 140 \nbecause they engaged in private practice.  Still others started mid-way through the year \nand had pro-rated caseload limits.  Tracking assignments and progress toward caseload \nlimits in this environment was challenging to say the least.  A second problem relates to \nGrant County’s practice of assigning child support and probation violation calendars to \njust a few defenders rather than rotating them among the entire group.  The credits \nawarded from these calendars are somewhat unpredictable, and concentrating these \nassignments among a small group of defenders makes it more likely that they will skew \ncaseloads.  Similarly, extraordinary case credits are earned rather than assigned.  Because \nwork on extraordinary cases is not reported until the end of the month, an unexpected \nincrease in hours worked on these cases can also skew caseload numbers.   \n \nFor 2008, Grant County assigned 1205 case equivalents to its public defenders, an \naverage of around 100 cases per month.  Although October case assignments were high, \nthe last two months of the year were below average.  In fact, five of the last seven months \nhave been well below average.  The Grant County Commissioners recently appointed a \nnew prosecutor to complete the term of John Knodell who won election to Superior Court \nin the fall.  It is unclear whether the new Grant County Prosecuting Attorney will have \nany effect on the number of criminal filings.  Based upon 2008 case assignments, Grant \nCounty needs slightly more than 8 full-time defenders for 2009.  As always, I recommend \nthat the County include a healthy cushion in its staffing plans.   \n \n \nTraining \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires Grant County to satisfy the NLADA Defender \nTraining and Development Standards.  The preface to those standards recognizes that \n“[c]ontinuous improvement and training are critical to competence [and] crucial to the \ndelivery of effective services to the clients served by defender organizations.”  Because \nfew criminal defense trainings are typically held locally, Grant County has provided \ntraining to its defenders by organizing its own trainings and by subsidizing defenders \nwho attend relevant trainings elsewhere. \n \nIn 2008, Supervising Attorney Alan White worked with statewide defender organizations \nto obtain high quality local trainings for the Grant County public defenders.  At Mr. \nWhite’s request, the Washington State Office of Public Defense sponsored a two-hour \ntraining on misdemeanor appeals.  Mr. White also arranged for the Washington Defender \nAssociation (WDA) to sponsor a half-day CLE covering search and seizure issues, \n2008 Quarterly Report - 4 of 16 \n\nworking with investigators, and the immigration consequences of criminal cases.  During \nthe fourth quarter, with the assistance of WDA, Mr. White organized another half-day \ntraining session on mental health issues and sentencing practice.    All of these trainings \nwere held in Ephrata with speakers from outside the county. \n \nIn addition to formal CLE sessions, Mr. White occasionally arranges for informal \nlunchtime trainings with local presenters.  During the fourth quarter, for example, Mr. \nWhite invited jurors who had served on recent defender trials to attend the defender lunch \nmeeting and discuss their experiences as jurors as well as their views on the cases and \nissues that arose in the trials in which they participated.  I was very impressed by Mr. \nWhite’s initiative in securing this unique training opportunity for the defenders. \n \nThe County has also been willing to provide financial assistance to defenders in order to \nallow them to attend trainings outside of Grant County.  During 2008, Grant County \nsupported Mike Prince in attending the National Criminal Defense College in Macon, \nGeorgia, and Karen Lindholdt and Julie St. Marie in attending an intensive three-day \ntraining on cross-examination put on by Jerry Spence’s Trial Lawyers College in \nLeavenworth, Washington.   \n \nMs. Lindholdt and Ms. St. Marie found the cross-examination training so valuable that \nthey have subsequently attended additional sessions conducted by the Trial Lawyers \nCollege at their own expense.  Both attended an intensive voir dire training in Wyoming \nin September as well as a three-day workshop on “Psychodrama Skills for Trial Lawyers” \nin Lummi Island, Washington earlier this month.  In addition, Ms. Lindholdt travelled to \nNew York to attend another three-day training on opening statements.  The commitment \nof these defenders to improving their trial skills is admirable, and I hope that Grant \nCounty will continue to support them in their efforts. \n \nI continue to believe Grant County should do more “in-house” trainings.  Three of its \ndefenders have attended nationally recognized training sessions this year.  Those \ndefenders undoubtedly gained valuable knowledge and insights that could and should be \nshared with their peers.  To date, however, Grant County has not taken advantage of such \nopportunities in any organized way.  In 2009, I hope that Grant County will make an \neffort to tap the knowledge base of its own defenders to provide more “in-house” training \nopportunities. \n \n \nFirst Appearances \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that Grant County provide representation at initial \nappearances for all indigent defendants.  To fulfill this obligation, the County assigns \neach of its full-time defenders to cover first appearances for a week at a time on a rotating \nbasis throughout the year.  During the fourth quarter, Grant County’s public defenders \nappear to have represented all indigent defendants at first appearance.  In reviewing court \nfiles and observing court, I did not find a single defendant who went unrepresented.  \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 5 of 16 \n\nGrant County used to require its defenders to visit first appearance clients in jail prior to \ntheir hearings.  In May, Supervising Attorney Alan White changed the policy to require a \nmeeting of some kind with the client and not necessarily a jail visit.  Despite this change \nin policy, most defenders continue to meet with first appearance defendants in jail rather \nthan the courtroom.  In reviewing jail sign-in logs for the fourth quarter, I found a record \nof first appearance jail visits on most court days.  Three defenders had a particularly large \nnumber of such visits:  Brian Gwinn (40), Mike Prince (31), and Brett Billingsley (25).  \nBased upon my courtroom observations and a review of “Intake Sheets,” it appears that \nthe Grant County defenders are having meaningful meetings with their first appearance \nclients and representing them effectively at their hearings.  \n \n \nJail Visits  \n \nGrant County requires its defenders to make contact with all new clients within a week of \nreceiving the assignment.  For in-custody clients, a jail visit is required.  Grant County’s \nwritten policy on client contact makes clear that a meeting with the client in the \ncourtroom or in the hallway outside the courtroom is not sufficient.  The County policy \nfurther provides that the jail visit must take place prior to arraignment “if at all \npracticable.”  \n \nTimely jail visits have long been an area of concern in Grant County.  Problems with jail \nvisits date back to at least December 2006 and have persisted into 2008.  As noted in \nprior reports, in-custody clients have sometimes had to wait weeks for a visit from their \nassigned attorneys; some never received visits at all.  Because of the serious and \npersistent nature of this problem, I closely scrutinize defender jail visits each quarter. \n \nI reviewed 88 in-custody cases assigned during the fourth quarter and found that the \nGrant County defenders visited their clients on or before the day of arraignment \napproximately 70% of the time.  Within a week, the defenders as a group had visited 90% \nof their in-custody clients.  Both figures represent a substantial improvement over past \nquarters.  Though not perfect, Grant County’s public defenders were very good about \nmaking timely jail visits in the fourth quarter.   \n \nOver the course of 2008, the defenders have steadily improved in this area.  Visits prior \nto arraignment increased from 25% of in-custody cases in the first quarter to 70% in the \nfourth quarter.  Visits within a week of assignment now occur in 90% of cases as \ncompared with 39% in the first quarter.  The table below shows the progression over the \ncourse of the year: \n \n  1st Quarter  2nd Quarter  3rd Quarter  4th Quarter \nVisit before arraignment  25%  34%  38%  70% \nVisit within 7 days  39%  46%  65%  90% \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 6 of 16 \n\nBrett Billingsley, Karen Lindholdt, Melissa MacDougall, John Perry, and Janelle \nPeterson all visited 100% of their in-custody clients within a week of receiving the \nassignment.  Mike Prince visited all but one of his clients within a week.3 \n \nTwo defenders, Mike Haas and Julie St. Marie, did not visit all of their clients in a timely \nfashion.  Although Mr. Haas visited a majority of his clients within 7 days, three clients \ndid not receive timely visits.  One waited 13 days, another 19 days, and a third waited 24 \ndays for a visit before finally pleading guilty having never received a jail visit from Mr. \nHaas.  Mr. Haas indicates that he did meet with these clients at length in the hallway \noutside the courtroom.  Ms. St. Marie visited 74% of her clients within a week, but I did \nfind 4 cases in which her clients had to wait from 9 to 11 days for a visit.  A fifth client \nwaited 13 days.  The delays in Ms. St. Marie’s visits may be due, in part, to the fact that \nshe was assigned more in-custody clients than any other defender during the fourth \nquarter.  She also had transportation problems due to the heavy snowfall in December.  \nRemoving these two attorneys from the calculation, the remaining defenders combined \nvisited 87% of their in-custody clients prior to arraignment and 99% within a week of \nassignment. \n \n \nClient Complaints \n \nGrant County maintains a toll-free telephone line for client complaints.  Instructions \nregarding how to contact the Supervising Attorney are posted in several locations at the \njail in both English and Spanish.  At arraignment, the public defenders provide out-of-\ncustody defendants with a flyer that directs them to contact Mr. White with complaints \nand includes his contact information.  Aracely Yanez logs all calls to the complaint line \nand forwards messages to the assigned defender or refers the matter to Mr. White for \nfollow-up.   \n \nDuring the fourth quarter, there were 210 calls to the complaint line.  One mentally ill \ninmate was responsible for 81 of those calls.  Excluding his calls, there were 129 calls to \nthe complaint line.  Many inmates call the line repeatedly for the same or similar reasons.  \nAlthough there were 129 calls to the complaint line, there were only 56 unique callers. \n \nAs in previous quarters, almost all of the calls to the complaint line related to attorney-\nclient communication.  Few callers reported substantive complaints.  Most wanted to \nspeak with their attorneys or asked that their assigned attorneys visit them in jail.  Calls to \nthe complaint line generally fell into the following categories: \n                                                 \n3 In the one case in which Mr. Prince did not make the required visit, he received the case just three days \nprior to arraignment, and the client pled guilty and was sentenced at that hearing.  Mr. Prince already had \nan open case with the client, and the client pled guilty to take advantage of a package deal on both cases. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 7 of 16 \n\n \n# Calls  Nature of call \n50  Request to speak with attorney/request for visit \n26  Request to speak or meet with Alan White/Alan White took call \n18  Question about case \n15  Substantive Complaint (9 different callers) \n6  Request for name of assigned attorney \n4  Message for assigned attorney \n3  Problems reaching assigned attorney \n3  Trying to contact attorney/request for attorney contact information \n   \n \nSome of the calls fell into more than one category.   \n \nTelephone access to public defenders from the jail seems to have improved clients’ \noverall satisfaction with their representation.  A year ago, callers frequently complained \nabout their attorneys not visiting them and expressed frustration at a lack of attorney-\nclient contact.  Now, most callers to the complaint line seem to view it as just another \nway to leave a message for their attorneys.  The typical caller is simply impatient about \nnot being able to instantly reach his or her assigned attorney by phone rather than \nunhappy with the level of contact overall.    \n \nIn the fourth quarter, Grant County again experienced some problems providing inmates \nwith telephone access to their defenders.  Ryan Earl discontinued his toll-free telephone \nservice in October even though he was still providing public defense services to Grant \nCounty.  Mike Haas terminated his toll-free telephone service in August and did not \nreconnect it until October 27.  As of November 6, Mr. Haas’ phone line was still not \nworking.  It is unclear when his phone line was finally reactivated, but it was working on \nDecember 12 when Alan White conducted his monthly test.  Although both Mr. Earl and \nMr. Haas disconnected their telephone services in violation of both their contracts and the \nSettlement Agreement,4 to the best of my knowledge, Grant County took no disciplinary \naction against either attorney. \n \nFor substantive complaints, Mr. White investigates the matter, including visiting the \ndefendant at the jail if necessary, and occasionally writes formal reports to the County \ndetailing the results of his investigation.  Mr. White is quite diligent about talking with \ndefendants who have complaints about their public defenders by phone and/or visiting \nthem in the jail.  When it comes to documenting the process, however, his investigations \noften seem to stall.  At present, Mr. White has quite a large backlog of pending \ninvestigations.  Mr. White’s December report lists at least 10 complaints dating back to \nJune in which his investigation is still pending.  Part of the problem may be that Mr. \nWhite appears to have a very high standard for such investigations.  The two written \n                                                 \n4 The Settlement Agreement specifically requires that each defender maintain a telephone system that \nallows clients to leave messages.   \n2008 Quarterly Report - 8 of 16 \n\ncomplaint reports that I have reviewed were quite comprehensive and lengthy.  Such \nextensive investigation and documentation is not necessary in most cases.   \n \nAs noted in prior quarterly reports, the current complaint system does not allow me to \neffectively monitor substantive complaints.  Those are typically handled directly by Alan \nWhite, and the complaint line records often do not reflect the substance of his phone calls \nor meetings with inmates.  Although Mr. White intends to draft reports regarding both the \ncomplaints and the findings from his investigation, I have only received two such reports \nto date.  I have discussed this issue with Alan White and provided him with a sample \npublic defender complaint log.  I believe he has now adopted his own form based on this \nmodel.  While Grant County should keep a written record regarding any substantive \ncomplaints against its public defenders, the records kept need not be overly detailed.  The \ngeneral nature of the complaint should be recorded along with the County’s response, if \nany.  If Grant County wishes to require a more detailed report, perhaps Mr. White could \ncomplete the basic report relatively quickly and defer the more detailed version to a later \ndate when he has more time. \n \n \nInvestigator Staffing \n \nGrant County currently has five approved investigators:  Ellyn Berg, Marv Scott, \nKathleen Kennedy, Jim Patterson, and Mario Torres.  I have consistently received \npositive reviews of the work of Ellyn Berg and Marv Scott who have been working with \nthe Grant County defenders for some time.  Mr. Patterson is also a skilled investigator, \nbut he seems to be very busy and did not receive any case assignments in the fourth \nquarter.  Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Torres are both new to Grant County this quarter.  Initial \nreviews of Ms. Kennedy’s work have been glowing.  The feedback I have received \nregarding Mr. Torres has been negative, with several defenders expressing concern about \nhis failure to perform assigned tasks in a timely fashion or at all.  I have also approved \ntwo other investigators, Allison Taylor and Win Taylor, but I understand that Grant \nCounty was unable to agree to contract terms with them. \n \n \nInvestigation Rates \n \nFor 2008, the overall rate of investigation was 36%, up slightly from 35% last year.  The \nrate for individual attorneys ranges from 19% to 63%.  As in the past, most defenders \nappear to be making appropriate use of investigators on their cases.  The 2008 \ninvestigation rates for Ryan Earl, who has now left the program, and Brett Billingsley are \nlow at 19% and 20% respectively.  Even so, these rates are higher than some of the single \ndigit rates I have found in the past.  Excluding Mr. Earl and Mr. Billingsley, the 2008 \ninvestigation rate for the remaining attorneys was 41%.  To his credit, Mr. Billingsley \nincreased his rate of investigation in the second half of the year, and his overall rate of \ninvestigation would likely be higher had he not been assigned to cover child support \ncalendars for much of the fourth quarter. \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 9 of 16 \n\n \nExperts \n \nDuring the fourth quarter, I continued the practice I instituted last quarter of reviewing \nelectronic court dockets on all new felony case assignments as well as pending cases \nfrom prior quarters.  In my review of dockets and related court files, I found that Grant \nCounty public defenders requested experts in six cases during the fourth quarter.  Janelle \nPeterson requested experts in two cases, and John Perry, Karen Lindholdt, Melissa \nMacDougall, and Julie St. Marie each requested an expert in one of their cases.   \n \nFor the year, I found 17 requests for experts by Grant County’s public defenders.  All the \nrequests came from the same five attorneys who made requests in the fourth quarter.  \nJanelle Peterson and Karen Lindholdt were, by far, the most aggressive in requesting the \nappointment of experts.  Ms. Peterson made eight requests, while Ms. Lindholdt made \nfive.   \n \nEvaluating the use of experts is difficult.  Without knowing all the facts and \ncircumstances of a particular case, it is difficult to determine with any certainty whether \nan expert should have been requested.  The one area in which I continue to have concerns \nabout the use of experts in Grant County is on cases involving mental health issues.  Most \nof Grant County’s defenders seem to appreciate the need for a defense expert when a \ndefendant has competency issues or potential mental defenses.  For a few defenders, \nhowever, the routine practice in such cases has been to simply request that the defendant \nbe sent to the state hospital for evaluation and then put the case on hold while awaiting \nthe results.  A zealous advocate for the defendant should be seeking an independent \nevaluation of the client by a defense expert, not relying on the State’s experts to \ndetermine whether a valid mental defense exists.  In my experience, such experts are far \nless likely to support a mental defense than an independent expert appointed by the court.  \nSimilarly, experts from the state hospitals are far more likely to find a defendant \ncompetent to stand trial than private experts who do not seem to set quite such a low bar \nfor competence.   While commitment to the state hospital for evaluation may be \ninevitable in many of these cases, the opinions of the State’s experts should not be both \nthe first and last word on these issues.   \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that public defenders request experts via ex parte \nmotion and that the records relating to experts be sealed.  For the most part, Grant County \ndefenders are requesting expert funds via ex parte application to the court and asking that \nthe records be sealed.5  I have found some expert requests that are not properly sealed, \nbut this appears to be the result of technical issues with the pleadings in most cases rather \nthan a lack of effort on the part of the defenders involved.  As mentioned in my last \nreport, Grant County defenders should work with the clerk’s office to develop standard \nsealing forms in order to ensure that expert requests and supporting documentation are \nproperly sealed in the court file in every case. \n \n                                                 \n5 In at least one case, the defenders report that the judge declined to hear an expert request ex parte.  I \nunderstand that in most cases, however, the defenders are permitted to make their motions ex parte. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 10 of 16 \n\n \nMotions Practice \n \nDuring the third quarter, I began conducting a systematic analysis of motions practice in \norder to ascertain whether the Grant County defenders were filing motions in appropriate \ncases.  I continued this effort in the fourth quarter, reviewing both new felony \nassignments and ongoing cases assigned earlier in the year.   \n \nDefender motions practice was quite robust in the fourth quarter.  I found 27 cases in \nwhich Grant County defenders had filed substantive motions.6  In several cases, \ndefenders had filed more than one motion.  Seven different defenders filed written \nmotions this quarter.7  Janelle Peterson had the most, with briefs filed in seven cases.  \nThe totals for the other defenders are listed below: \n         \nAttorney    Motions \nPeterson  7 \nLindholdt  5 \nMacDougall  4 \nSt. Marie  4 \nPerry  4 \nPrince  2 \nHaas  1 \n \n \nOverall, Grant County public defenders filed motions in 59 cases in 2008.  Defender \nmotions practice improved substantially in the second half of the year; the number of \nmotions filed more than tripled after July 1.  Three attorneys were responsible for a \ndisproportionate share of the motions filed.   Karen Lindholdt (12), Janelle Peterson (14), \nand Julie St. Marie (13) filed motions in 39 cases in 2008 and were responsible for 66% \nof the motions filed.  Ms. Lindholdt’s total is particularly impressive in that she filed \nalmost as many motions as Ms. Peterson and Ms. St. Marie even though she was assigned \nabout half as many cases.  Melissa MacDougall has only been in Grant County a few \nmonths, but she has already demonstrated herself to be quite aggressive in her motions \npractice, filing briefs in 15% of her felony case assignments, a rate second only to Ms. \nLindholdt (20%). \n \nGrant County should be proud of the overall level of motions practice by its defenders, \nparticularly over the last six months.  While a few defenders could be more aggressive in \nfiling motions, virtually all are filing some motions, and a majority of the defenders are \nengaging in an active motions practice.   \n                                                 \n6 For purposes of this analysis, I defined substantive motions as any written motion to suppress pursuant to \nCrR 3.5 or CrR 3.6, any written Knapstad motion, and any written brief that contained substantive legal \nanalysis tailored to a particular case.   \n7 The two defenders who did not file motions during the fourth quarter were assigned almost exclusively to \ncover child support calendars.  Brett Billingsley received only 4 felony case assignments during the fourth \nquarter, and Brian Gwinn received none. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 11 of 16 \n\nOverall Quality of Representation \n   \nOver the past year, Grant County’s public defender program has improved substantially.  \nGrant County has moved away from using part-time defenders and eliminated the \ndysfunctional group dynamic that plagued its defenders in 2007.  Grant County now has a \nmuch more cohesive, collegial defender program.  More importantly, Grant County’s \npublic defenders are currently providing their clients with better representation than at \nany other time during my tenure as Monitor.  Most defenders are visiting their in-custody \nclients promptly, investigating their cases, and filing motions when appropriate.  Grant \nCounty has a core group of defenders who have been doing excellent work for some time \nnow, and several other defenders have raised their practice level in recent months.  While \nthere is always room for improvement, the overall quality of representation in Grant \nCounty is now quite good.   \n \nDisposition data for 2008 felony cases suggests that Grant County’s public defenders \nfrequently obtain favorable results for their clients.  Of the 435 case dispositions I \nreviewed, approximately 94% of the cases assigned to Grant County public defenders \nresulted in criminal conviction, but only 66% of the cases resulted in a felony conviction.  \nThe most aggressive defenders saw only 57% of their cases end in a felony conviction.   \nAlmost all of the remaining cases resulted in a misdemeanor conviction.  Although \nacquittal or dismissal is always the goal, a misdemeanor conviction is generally viewed \nas a favorable outcome for the defense in a felony case.   \n \nIn the cases I reviewed, I found twenty-five 2008 cases that ended in dismissal.  Julie St. \nMarie had the most cases dismissed with nine.  In other jurisdictions, I would have \nassumed that most of these dismissals were simply cases dismissed pursuant to plea \nbargains or due to problems locating witnesses.  As one defender pointed out, however, \nGrant County prosecutors “definitely don’t give dismissals away.”   Indeed, upon further \ninquiry, I found that the defenders had, in fact, earned many of the dismissals.  Through \ninvestigation, legal research, and/or zealous advocacy, five different Grant County \ndefenders reported that they had successfully persuaded the assigned prosecutors that \ntheir clients had factual or legal defenses to the crimes charged. \n \nGrant County public defenders had four felony trials during the fourth quarter, three jury \ntrials and one juvenile bench trial.  Mike Haas and Melissa McDougall were in trial for \nalmost two weeks on a case involving numerous very serious felony charges including \nAttempted Murder 1°.  The other two jury trials were forgery cases handled by Janelle \nPeterson and Karen Lindholdt.  Though the defenders reportedly represented their clients \nwell, each of the jury trials resulted in conviction.  In the bench trial, however, Julie St. \nMarie and Janelle Peterson won a not guilty verdict for their juvenile client who had been \ncharged with Child Molestation 1°.   \n \nFor the year, Grant County public defenders had 13 jury trials and 3 bench trials.8    Mike \nHaas was lead counsel in three jury trials in 2008.  Brett Billingsley, Karen Lindholdt, \n                                                 \n8 Two of the jury trials were handled by part-time defenders who left the program at the end of 2007, but \nthe cases were part of their public defense caseload. \n2008 Quarterly Report - 12 of 16 \n\nand Janelle Peterson each acted as lead counsel in two jury trials.  Julie St. Marie served \nas lead counsel in one jury trial and one bench trial.  In addition to her jury trials, Ms. \nPeterson was sole counsel in two bench trials.  Karen Lindholdt and Brett Billingsley \nboth won jury acquittals in 2008, and in addition to the juvenile case described above, \nMs. Peterson won another acquittal from the bench. \n \nThe overall trial rate was approximately 1.6%, a slight increase over last year.  I continue \nto believe the trial rate should be higher and hope that it will increase next year.  I still \nstruggle to understand the reasons there are not more trials in Grant County.  Most of the \ncurrent defenders do not seem at all hesitant about going to trial.  To some extent, their \nsuccess in plea negotiations may have reduced the trial rate.  I also know that in some \ncases, the defenders have been ready for trial but unable to proceed due to court \ncongestion or court scheduling issues.  Unfortunately, in more than one such case, the \ndefendant has ultimately elected to plead guilty in order to secure his release from \ncustody rather than wait for a trial.  \n \n \nSupervising Attorney \n \nAlan White has been the Supervising Attorney for the Grant County public defense \nprogram since 2005, prior to the adoption of the Settlement Agreement.  In November, \nhowever, Grant County decided to hire Ray Gonzales to replace Alan White as \nSupervising Attorney.   I approved Mr. Gonzales as the new Supervising Attorney as he \nappeared well qualified for the position.   \n \nMr. White continued to act as Supervising Attorney through the end of 2008.  Although \nMr. Gonzales started work in late November, he has been focusing on budget and \nplanning issues rather than the day-to-day operation of the program.  Grant County has \ncontracted with Alan White to continue his administrative responsibilities for 3 to 6 \nmonths.  During the transition, Mr. White will continue to be responsible for case \nassignments, monitoring caseloads, investigator assignments, maintaining the complaint \nline, and preparing all necessary reports.   \n \nThe Settlement Agreement requires that I “oversee and assess the Supervising Attorney’s \nperformance.”  During his tenure as Supervising Attorney, Alan White earned the \nrespect, loyalty, and trust of the Grant County public defenders.  Although I have been \ncritical of some aspects of Mr. White’s performance in the past, he has always been an \neffective administrator as well as a dedicated advocate for and mentor to the Grant \nCounty public defenders.  His commitment to Grant County and its defenders has never \nbeen in question.  Moreover, to his credit, he has always been very open to guidance and \neager to improve as a supervisor.  As a result, he has become a much more effective \nsupervisor over the last year.   \n \nAt the outset of 2008, I identified several areas of emphasis for Mr. White this year: (1) \nmotions practice; (2) jail visits; (3) investigation rates; and (4) limiting his own court \nappearances to increase the time available for other tasks.  Mr. White has been much \n2008 Quarterly Report - 13 of 16 \n\nbetter this year about limiting himself to emergencies in covering hearings for the \ndefenders.  With respect to the other areas, as should be evident from my comments \nabove, the performance of the Grant County defenders on motions, investigation, and jail \nvisits has improved markedly over the course of the year.  Mr. White highlighted these \nissues in his meetings with defenders and counseled defenders individually when \nappropriate.   \n \nIn the first three quarters, Mr. White’s monitoring of attorney performance in these areas \nwas spotty, which allowed problems to go unaddressed for too long.  In the fourth \nquarter, however, Mr. White regularly tracked jail visits and investigation rates and \nincluded his findings in his monthly reports.  Because jail visits have been such a \npersistent problem, Mr. White also provided individualized reports to defenders regarding \ntheir visits and sought explanations when he found that some were untimely.  I was quite \npleased with Mr. White’s handling of these issues in the fourth quarter.    \n \n \nNew Supervising Attorney \n \nAs noted above, Ray Gonzales began work as Grant County’s new Supervising Attorney \nin late November.  Mr. Gonzales is charged with developing, implementing, and \noverseeing an in-house public defense program in Grant County.   He is also responsible \nfor supervising Grant County’s contract public defenders.   \n \nAlthough Mr. Gonzales has only been working in Grant County a short time, he has \nalready made a very poor impression on the public defenders he is assigned to supervise.  \nDuring his first month in Grant County, I received several complaints about Mr. \nGonzales as well as reports that defender morale was low.  The apparent dissatisfaction \nwith Mr. Gonzales was particularly concerning in light of the four resignations the \nCounty had already received.  In order to assess the situation, I asked the defenders to \ncomplete a survey regarding the transition to an in-house system, the new supervising \nattorney, and defender morale.   All nine public defenders completed the survey. \n \nThe survey results were disquieting to say the least.  All of the public defenders described \nmorale as low (3) or very low (6).  All agreed that morale has deteriorated recently with \nvirtually every defender listing Mr. Gonzales as a primary cause.  Asked specifically \nabout Mr. Gonzales, no one felt he had made a positive impression.  Eight of the nine \ndefenders indicated that he had made a very negative (5) or negative (3) impression.  One \ndefender who had already resigned said his impression was neutral.   \n \nI was struck by both the consistency and the intensity of the defenders’ responses \nregarding Mr. Gonzales.  The defenders were very critical of his interpersonal skills, \ndescribing him as “rude,” “offensive,” and “condescending.”  They noted that his “social \nskills are severely lacking” and that he “seems to lack any positive personality at all.” \n \nThe defenders do not see Mr. Gonzales as an advocate for the public defense system.  \nOne defender observed that “he has not made a single comment that indicates he cares at \n2008 Quarterly Report - 14 of 16 \n\nall about public defense.  He is not mission driven.”  Another defender wrote that he \n“belittles attorney concerns” and “seems to express disdain for clients.”  The defenders \nview his leadership style as autocratic with little room for input from anyone else.  As \none defender put it, it’s “his way or the highway.”  Mr. Gonzales has a difficult task in \nwinning over the defenders as he seems to be viewed by most of the defenders as “more \nan enemy than a friend.”  \n \nI have had several discussions with Mr. Gonzales regarding the feedback I have received \nfrom the defenders.  His response to date has been disappointing.   Mr. Gonzales has been \nvery defensive and not particularly open to reflecting upon his own performance.  In \napproving Mr. Gonzales as Supervising Attorney, I felt that his experience and aggressive \napproach to defense practice would make him a valuable mentor for the Grant County \npublic defenders.  Unfortunately, his poor relationship with the defenders undermines his \neffectiveness as a mentor.  Many defenders are now actively avoiding him.  Unless Mr. \nGonzales is able to establish some sort of rapport with the Grant County defenders, he \nwill be relegated to serving as little more than an administrator. \n \nMr. Gonzales has stepped into a very difficult position.  He is replacing a very popular \nsupervisor at a time of significant change in the Grant County defender program.  To \nsome extent, he likely bears the brunt of defender unhappiness over the departure of Alan \nWhite and the implementation of an in-house defender program.  It would be a mistake, \nhowever, to view the criticisms of Mr. Gonzales as solely the result of misdirected \nfrustrations.  Mr. Gonzales can and should do a better job of communicating with the \ndefenders.   He needs to find a way to earn their respect.   \n \n \nProposed Transition to an In-house Defender Program  \n \nGrant County continues to move forward with its plans for an in-house defender program.  \nMr. Gonzales has been hired as a Grant County employee and department head.  I \nunderstand that he recently completed the budget process with the Board of County \nCommissioners and now has an approved budget.  Mr. Gonzales is in the process of \ndrafting a comprehensive plan for the new defender program.  He presented the broad \noutlines of that plan to the Board of County Commissioners last week.  The County has \nalready leased office space approximately one block from the courthouse, and Mr. \nGonzales has been involved in planning the remodeling of that space to accommodate the \nneeds of a defender office.    \n \nThe unexpected departure of four defenders has caused Grant County to accelerate its \ntimetable for the in-house program.  The County has posted job announcements for in-\nhouse defender positions and is apparently hoping to open the new office in March.  I \nbelieve this timeframe is unrealistic.  To date, Grant County has not provided a detailed \nplan for the new in-house program.  The proposals that I have reviewed seem preliminary \nand incomplete.   \n \n2008 Quarterly Report - 15 of 16 \n\nThere is much work to be done and many questions to be answered before Grant County \nwill be ready to institute an in-house public defender office.  At present, the office space \nis little more than an empty shell with no interior office walls.  The space needs a great \ndeal of remodeling work before it will be a suitable workspace.  In terms of staffing, \nalthough Grant County has listed salaries in its position announcements, I have not \nreceived documentation that those salaries are comparable to the salaries offered by the \nGrant County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office as required by the Settlement Agreement.  \nThe current defenders have made clear to the County that they are unwilling to go in-\nhouse, and those that haven’t already resigned are either actively looking for other work \n(3) or considering doing so (2).  In response to the recent job postings, Grant County \nreceived only three applicants who meet the minimum qualifications for felony work.  \nMeanwhile, the Supervising Attorney has no support staff and as a result, is currently \nunable to perform the administrative functions of his job.   \n \nIn my last report, I urged Grant County to work with the defenders in planning for the \nnew defender office.  Unfortunately, the County did not heed my advice.  Grant County \nhas not involved its defenders in the planning process or even sought their input.  Instead \nof being transparent, Grant County has been vague, guarded, and evasive about its \nintentions.  This approach has caused great uncertainty and resentment among the \ndefenders.   Four defenders have already resigned at least in part due to Grant County’s \nhandling of this transition.  As a result, Grant County has now lost its only three \ndefenders who actually resided in the County.  These defenders had made a commitment \nto Grant County, a commitment they did not feel was reciprocated.   \n \nGoing forward, Grant County needs to develop a more concrete plan for its defender \noffice along with a more realistic timeframe.  In addition, Grant County and its \nSupervising Attorney need to immediately take steps to repair their relationships with the \ndefenders before additional resignations further undermine the program. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nBased solely on the quality of representation being provided to indigent defendants in \nGrant County, my conclusion would be that Grant County public defense is headed in the \nright direction.  Unfortunately, just as the defender program had finally gotten on track, \nGrant County decided to make a number of changes that have the potential to set the \nprogram back significantly.  The decisions to change supervising attorneys and to move \nthe program in-house have been extremely disruptive.  Only time will tell whether Grant \nCounty is able to overcome the turmoil that currently plagues its defender program. \n \nDespite the impending departure of four of its defenders, Grant County still has a solid \nnucleus of defenders who consistently provide quality representation to their clients.  The \nchallenge for Grant County in the coming months will be to retain the quality defenders it \nstill has while also recruiting talented new attorneys to build upon that nucleus.  \n2008 Quarterly Report - 16 of 16 ",
