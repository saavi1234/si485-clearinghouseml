    "summary": "<p>On August 9, 2002, two plaintiffs represented by private attorneys from Minnesota and Wisconsin filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.  The plaintiffs challenged the policies, practices, and customs concerning the blanket strip and visual body cavity searches at Wisconsin's St. Croix County Jail.  Plaintiffs alleged that, pursuant to a policy adopted by the St. Croix County Sheriff's Department on May 5, 1996, all persons entering the jail were strip searched, whether or not reasonable suspicion existed that the searches would produce contraband or weapons.  This policy, plaintiffs alleged, violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and class certification.  The Sheriff and County denied all allegations.</p><p>On February 13, 2003, the District Court (Judge Barbara Crabb) certified the case as a class action, defining the class as: \"All United States citizens arrested for misdemeanors or ordinance offenses unrelated to weapons or illegal drugs who were required by officers of the St. Croix County jail to remove their clothing for visual inspection of their genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or breasts between August 6, 1996, and February 27, 2001.\"  Blihovde v. St. Croix County, Wis., 219 F.R.D. 607 (W.D. Wis. Feb 13, 2003).  See Blihovde v. St. Croix County, Wis., 2003 WL 23095561 (W.D. Wis. Mar. 05, 2003) (regarding notice to class members). The Court approved two proposed class notices: one for adult class members and one for minor class members.  Blihovde v. St. Croix County, Wis., 2003 WL 23200374 (W.D. Wis. Apr. 25, 2003).</p><p>Following notification of some 2,917 potential class members, the parties settled the case and submitted the proposal to the District Court for preliminary approval.  Following a fairness hearing, Judge Crabb issued an order of final approval on February 2, 2004.  Under the settlement, the Sheriff and County agreed to pay a total of $6.965 Million to resolve all class claims.  Of that amount, over $1.3 Million were awarded to class counsel as attorneys' fees and costs.  The named plaintiffs each would receive $35,000.  The remaining $5.5 Million were divided among the 1,983 identified and responding class members per an agreed distribution scheme, with each getting just under $2800.</p><p>After the claims were paid, several individuals who had not received class notices filed letters with the court, which deemed them motions to reopen the case.  The Court denied the motions, noting that although the individuals were not able to participate in the settlement, they were still free to file their own lawsuits.  Brecher v. St. Croix County, Wis., 2004 WL 1196982 (W.D. Wis. May 26, 2004).</p><p>We have no information indicating other post-settlement activity in the case.</p><p></p>",

Hillstead, individually, and in his official capacity as the St. Croix County Sheriff; \nKaren Humphrey, individually, and in her official capacity as Jail Administrator of the St. \nCroix County Jail; Kristen Anderson, individually and in her official capacity as a St. Croix \nCounty Deputy Sheriff; Terry Larson, individually and in his official capacity as a St. Croix \nCounty Deputy Sheriff; Lisa Opel, individually and in her official capacity as a St. Croix \nCounty Deputy Sheriff; Shelby Lane, individually and in her official capacity as a St. Croix \nCounty Deputy Sheriff; and Wisconsin Municipal Mutual Insurance Company, (hereinafter \ncollectively \"Defendants and Insurer\") and Named Plaintiffs Travis Brecher and Renee \nHouser (formerly Renee Jensen) (hereinafter collectively \"Named Plaintiffs\"), individually \nand as representatives of others similarly situated, which constitutes the Plaintiff Class as \ndefined below, acting by and through their undersigned counsel, Robins, Kaplan, Miller & \nCiresi, L.L.P.,  who is Class Counsel. As used herein, \"The Parties\" shall refer collectively \nto the Defendants and Insurer and The Named Plaintiffs. \nRECITALS \n1.  The  Named Plaintiffs brought a cause of  action against the  Defendants \nalleging that they were illegally strip searched at the St. Croix County Jail and seeking \ndamages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of their rights secured by the Fourth and \nFourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States. The cause was filed in \nthe Federal District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, as Case Number 02-C- \n0405-C (\"the Subject Lawsuit\"). \n\n, \n2.  The Defendants have not admitted liability. \n3.  The Named Plaintiffs, the Plaintiff Class, and the Defendants desire to settle \nthe Subject Lawsuit to avoid the uncertainties and risks of trial, to avoid further expenses, \ninconvenience, and the distraction of burdensome and protracted litigation, and to obtain \nthe  covenants,  releases,  orders  and  judgments  contemplated  by  this  Settlement \nAgreement so as to settle and put to rest totally and finally the matters raised by the \nSubject Lawsuit. \n4.  Counsel for  the  Named Plaintiffs and the  Plaintiff Class  in the  subject \nLawsuit  has  conducted  substantial  discovery,  investigations  and  negotiations  and, \nconsidering the benefits of the settlement and the risks of litigation, has concluded that it is \nin the  best interest of the  Named Plaintiffs and the  Plaintiff Class to enter  into this \nSettlement Agreement. The Named Plaintiffs and Class Counsel agree that this settlement \nis fair, reasonable and adequate with respect to the interests of the Named Plaintiffs and \nthe Plaintiff Class, and should be approved by the Trial Court pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23 (e). \nCOVENANTS AND RELEASES \nIn consideration of the premises and mutual promises, covenants and warranties \ncontained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency  of \nwhich the Parties now acknowledge, the Parties agree as follows: \n1. CLASS CERTIFICATION \n1.1 That the settlement is by and for the benefit of the class as defined and certified in the \nCourt's order dated February 13,2003, to wit: \n\"All  United  States  citizens  arrested  for  misdemeanors  or  ordinance \noffenses unrelated to weapons or illegal drugs who were  required by \n2 \n\nt \nofficers of the St.  Croix County jail to remove their clothing for visual \ninspection of  their genitals,  pubic area,  buttocks, or  breasts between \nAugust 6,1996, and February 27,2001.\" \n2.  PRELIMINARY APPROVAL \nUpon execution  of  this  Settlement  Agreement,  the  Named  Plaintiffs and  the \nDefendants shall jointly petition the Court for  Preliminary Approval of this Settlement \nAgreement, and agree to use their best efforts to obtain such Preliminary Approval. \n3.  NOTICE OF PROPOSED CLASS SETTLEMENT \n3.1  Upon preliminary Approval by the Court, Class Counsel agrees to provide notice \nof the proposed settlement to the Final Plaintiff Class Members as defined in Section V. of \nthe Joint Petition For Preliminary Approval Of The Settlement Between The Defendants \nAnd The Plaintiff Class, in a form approved by the Court, as required by Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23 (e). In petitioning the Court for Preliminary Approval, the Parties will \nrecommend to the Court that Notice of the proposed settlement will be sent by first class \nmail, postage prepaid, to all Final Class Members. \n3.2  The Plaintiffs will mail this notice, and/or any other notice required by the Trial \nCourt, within  15 days of the Court's  order of preliminary approval of this Settlement \nAgreement. \n4.  FINAL COURT APPROVAL \n4.1 After notice is given to the Final Plaintiff Class as described above, the Named \nPlaintiffs and the  Defendants shall jointly move for the  Court's final approval of this \nsettlement, and agree to use their best efforts to obtain such approval.  If any party or \nperson legally entitled to object objects to this proposed settlement, the Parties will use \ntheir best efforts to meet such objection. If any party or person legally entitled to object \n3 \n\nappeals the Court's order of final approval of the settlement, the Parties will use their best \nefforts to defeat the appeal. \n4.2  The terms of this Settlement Agreement are subject to the Court's final approval \nand,  in the event the settlement is appealed, the approval of all applicable appellate \ncourts.  If  the  Court or  any  appellate court  enters an  order  altering  this  Settlement \nAgreement in a way that materially and adversely affects a Party, that Party may void the \nSettlement Agreement within three (3) business days from the date the Court or appellate \ncourt enters such an order by giving written notice of intent to void the settlement to the \nopposing party's counsel. \n5.  DISMISSAL OF THE LAWSUIT \nIf no Party gives notice of intent to void the settlement as described in paragraph 3 \nabove, the Named Plaintiffs, individually and as representatives of the Final Plaintiff Class \nMembers, shall execute and cause to be filed with the Trial Court in the Subject Lawsuit \nan  agreed order of dismissal with  prejudice on the  merits of  all claims against the \nDefendants. The agreed order of dismissal with prejudice on the merits shall be filed by \nNamed Plaintiffs within seven (7) business days after The Date of Final Approval, but not \nbefore the three-day period described in paragraph 4 above has lapsed. \n6.  RELEASES, COVENANTS AND PROTECTION FROM FUTURE \nLITIGATION \n6.1  The Named Plaintiffs and all members of the Final Plaintiff Class agree fully and \nfinally to ACQUIT, RELEASE, WAIVE and DISCHARGE the Defendants and Insurer of \nand from any and all claims, demands, cross-actions and causes of action at law or in \nequity, whether statutory, contractual, in tort, or otherwise, as well as any other kind of \nlegal, equitable or administrative action, claimed or possessed by any member of the Final \n4 \n\nPlaintiff Class, whether known or unknown, in whole or in part, for or on account of, or \narising or growing out of, or based upon, relating to or concerning, whether directly or \nindirectly, any and all matters and dealings relating to the allegations forming the basis for \nthis  lawsuit (“The  Released Claims”). This  Release fully extinguishes all  claims and \ncauses  of  action,  including but  not  limited to  those  for:  subrogation,  compensatory \ndamages; loss of society, companionship and consortium; punitive damages; costs and \nfees; attorneys’ fees; and statutory damage awards. In making this Release, all rights to \nbring any other claims against anyone are fully extinguished since full compensation for all \ninjuries and damages has been paid.  It is understood that  the  money  paid for  this \nunqualified Release is received not only as a full satisfaction for all known and unknown \ninjuries and damages, but also is received for future injuries and damages. The extent of \nany future injuries and damages is unknown, but it is understood that it may result in a \ncondition substantially different than it is today. It is understood in making this Release, \nthat the Named Plaintiffs and all members of the Final Plaintiff Class will have no right to \nmake a claim against anyone, including the parties released, for more money even if later \ndissatisfied with this settlement for any reason whatsoever. \nThis  release  also fully  extinguishes  any  claims  or  causes  action  against the \nreleased  parties  under the  Wisconsin Uniform Marital Property Act.  In making  this \nrepresentation, the Named Plaintiffs and all members of the Final Plaintiff Class agree to \nindemnify the released parties for any money they may have to pay to any other person or \nentity asserting any claim arising out of or related to any injuries or damages to which this \nrelease relates based upon subrogation, derivation or assignment. \n5 \n\nUpon the date that the Court gives Final Approval of this Settlement Agreement, \neach member of the Final Plaintiff Class who has not timely and properly excluded him or \nherself by opting out of the Final Plaintiff Class shall be deemed to have given this \nrelease. St Croix County specifically denies any liability arising out of the events forming \nthe basis of plaintiffs’ Complaint. \n6.2  The Named Plaintiffs and all members of the Final Plaintiff Class agree that this \nSettlement Agreement  shall be construed to be,  and  is,  a covenant by the  Named \nPlaintiffs and all members of the Final Plaintiff Class, for  themselves, their affiliates, \nagents, successors and assigns, not to sue, institute, or instigate any legal, equitable or \nadministrative proceedings against the Defendants for any Released Claim. The Named \nPlaintiffs and all members of the Final Plaintiff Class agree and acknowledge that the \ncovenants not to sue in this Settlement Agreement are made to inure to the benefit of, and \nare  specifically  enforceable  by,  the  Defendants  and  their  agents,  employees, \nrepresentatives,  directors,  officers,  parent  companies,  subsidiaries,  affiliates,  heirs, \nexecutors, predecessors, successors, and assigns. Upon the date that the Court gives \nFinal Approval of this Settlement Agreement each member of the Plaintiff Class who has \nnot timely and properly excluded him or herself by opting out of the Plaintiff Class shall be \ndeemed to have made these covenants. \n6.3  The Named Plaintiffs and the Final Plaintiff Class represent and warrant that they \nare the current legal and beneficial owners of the Released Claims and that they have not \nassigned, pledged or contracted to assign or pledge any such Released Claim to any \nperson. \n6.4  The Named Plaintiffs and the Final Plaintiff Class warrant and represent that they \n6 \n\nhave asserted no claim in the Subject Lawsuit except those that they own, that they can \nprovide a complete resolution of their claims in the Subject Lawsuit, and that no part of the \nNamed Plaintiffs’ or  Final Plaintiff Class’ claims in the  Subject Lawsuits against the \nDefendants and Insurer will remain viable after the dismissal of the Subject Lawsuit. \n6.5  The terms of the release and covenants provided and effectuated by this \nSettlement Agreement are to be very broadly construed in favor of the Defendants and in \nfavor of the complete resolution of all claims that were actually raised in, or could have \nbeen raised in, the Subject Lawsuit. \n7.  SETTLEMENT TERMS \nAs a Compromise Settlement of  the Subject Lawsuit, and in exchange for the \nreleases and covenants above described, Defendants agree as follows: \n7.1  To pay a total of Six Million and Nine Hundred and Sixty Five Thousand Dollars \n($6,965,000.00w)h,i ch will paid as follows: \nA.  Thirty Five Thousand Dollars ($35,000.00) to named plaintiff Travis Brecher; \nB.  Thirty Five Thousand Dollars ($35,000.00)  to named plaintiff Renee Houser \n(formerly Renee Jensen); \nC.  Five Million and  Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,500,000.00)  to  be \ndivided equally, on a per search basis, among all Final Class Members who come forward \nand make a claim for compensation (see process described below); and \nD.  One  Million  and  Three  Hundred  and  Ninety  Five  Thousand  Dollars \n($1,395,000.00) to Class Counsel as combined fees and costs. From this amount Class \nCounsel will be reimbursed for all costs, including the costs previously incurred in sending \nnotice of this lawsuit to all potential class members. A portion of this amount will also be \n7 \n\n- .\n- 1  \n. I  \nused by Class Counsel to provide the notice of proposed settlement described in this \nSettlement Agreement, to provide the Claim forms and to disburse the settlement \nproceeds to all persons making a claim. \n7.2  Upon  Final Approval of  the  Settlement,  each  Final  Class Member,  i.e.  Class \nmembers to whom Notice of Class action was previously successfully sent and who did \nnot opt out of participation in the subject litigation, will be sent by first class mail, postage \nprepaid, a Claim Form, stating the number of qualifying strip searches that the class \nmember may claim compensation for and instructing him or her on how to make a claim \nfor compensation. Upon receipt of all returned Claim Forms, the total number of searches \nfor which a claim has been made will be calculated. In this regard, each search for which a \nclaim is made by a person who was a juvenile at the time of the strip search will be \ncounted as 1.5 searches for the purposes of determining the Total Number of Claimed \nSearches. Defendants have identified 29 juveniles whom they have notified of this lawsuit. \n7.3  The Five Million and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,500,000.00) will then \nbe divided by the Total Number of Claimed Searches. The resulting figure will constitute \nthe  Per Search Compensation Amount.  A  Check will then  be mailed to  each  Class \nMember who returned a Claim Form in an amount equal to the Per Search Compensation \nAmount times that person’s number of qualifying searches. Juveniles making a claim will \nreceive a check for one and one half(150%) of the Per Search Compensation Amount \ntimes that juvenile’s number of qualifying searches. \n7.4  Thirty days after the court‘s Final Approval of the settlement, or by February 10, \n2004, whichever is later,  Defendants will make payment of the Six  Million and Nine \nHundred and Sixty Five Thousand Dollars ($6,965,000.00).  Payment will be made by \n8 \n\ntransfer of this amount to Class Counsel’s trust account. Class Counsel will then make \npayment directly to the Named Plaintiffs and all Final Class Members making a claim for \ncompensation out of this trust account, or in Class Counsel’s discretion, hire a third-party \nadministrator to make these payments. \n7.5  Payment to Class Members submitting a Claim Form will be made within 20 days \nof the court approved deadline for submitting a Claim Form or with 20 days of the receipt \nby Class Counsel of the payment of the Six Million and Nine Hundred and Sixty Five \nThousand Dollars ($6,965,000.00)w,h ichever is later. \nPursuant to the Court’s order dated March 5,2003, plaintiffs have not been made \naware of the identities of these juveniles. \n7.6  Within 14 days of the disbursement of all proceeds, Class Counsel will provide an \naccounting to the Court and to counsel for the  Defendants showing the names and \naddresses of all persons receiving compensation and the amount of that compensation, \nand certifying that all funds have been disbursed. In the event that any mailed checks are \nnot cashed within 6 months of the date of mailing, or are returned as undeliverable and \nthe intended recipient cannot be located, the total funds unclaimed will be returned to the \ndefendants. \n7.7  It will be Class Counsel’s responsibility to make payments as necessary to any \nother affiliated or co-counsel who have been involved in the Subject Lawsuit.

Hillstead, Karen \nHumphrey, Mark Voltz, Kristen Anderson, Terry Larson and Deputy Sheriffs John and Jane Doe \n1 through 30, state and allege as follows: \n\n*- \nINTRODUCTION \nThis class action for damages is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5 1983 and the Fourth and \nFourteenth  Amendments to  the  Constitution of  the United  States, alleging violation  of  the \nconstitutional rights  of  the plaintiffs,  and  the members  of  the  class they  represent,  by  all \ndefendants. \nOn or about December 28,  1998, plaintiff David Blihovde was taken into custody by \ndefendant Voltz for driving under the influence of alcohol.  He was brought to the St. Croix \nCounty Jail where defendant Voltz and members of the St. Croix County Sheriffs Department \nforced him to remove his clothing in a semi-public hallway and in the presence of at least one \nfemale Deputy Sheriff. The strip search was conducted without probable cause, reasonable belief, \nreasonable suspicion or any individualized reason to believe or suspect that he was in possession \nof, or concealing contraband or weaponry.  The defendants deprived plaintiff Blihovde of his \nfederal constitutional rights while acting under color of state law. \nOn or about April 13, 1999, plaintiff Travis Brecher was stopped for having a taillight out \non his truck.  He produced a revoked drivers license and was taken to the St. Croix County Jail. \nAfter sitting in a holding cell for several hours, he was booked and strip searched without \nprobable cause, reasonable belief, reasonable suspicion or any individualized reason to believe or \nsuspect that he was in possession of or concealing contraband or weaponry.  The defendants \ndeprived plaintiff Brecher of his federal constitutional rights while acting unde color of state law. \nOn information and belief, the plaintiffs were strip searched pursuant to a blanket policy \nand/or custom of St. Croix County and the St. Croix County Sheriffs Department of searching \narrestees booked into the St. Croix County Jail, regardless of offense, reason for detention or \n- 2 -  \nI501 4068.1 \n\ncause. On information and belief, the County’s blanket custom and policy and/or custom of strip \nsearching arrestees booked into the St. Croix County Jail was used to illegally strip search \nthousands of individuals with no probable cause, reasonable belief, reasonable suspicion or any \nindividualized reason to believe or suspect that they might be concealing contraband or weaponry. \nIn fact, because of the existence of the illegal and unconstitutional policy and/or custom, the \nofficers and jailers involved never even made an assessment of the need for these searches -- they \nsimply performed the unconstitutional searches as a matter of course, custom and/or policy. \nJURISDICTION \n1. \nThis action arises under the United States Constitution, particularly under the provisions \nof the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and under \nfederal law, particularly the Civil Rights Act, 42 U. S.C   . $ 1983. \n2. \nThis Court has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 6 1331, which gives this \ncourt original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the federal laws and federal constitution \nand pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 6 1343(a)(3)-(4), which gives this Court original jurisdiction over civil \nactions to redress the deprivation under color of state law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom \nor usage of any federal constitutional right or any right secured by federal statutes including 42 \nU.S.C. $ 1983. \n3. \nVenue is proper in the Western District of Wisconsin since the acts and transactions \ncomplained of herein all occurred within the District. \n15014 068. I  - 3 -  \n\nPARTIES \n4. \nPlaintiff David Blihovde is an individual currently residing in the City of North Hudson, \nCounty of St. Croix, Wisconsin. \n5. \nPlaintiff Travis Brecher is an individual currently residing in the City of Wilson, County \nof St. Croix, Wisconsin. \n6. \nDefendant St. Croix County is, and at all relevant times was, a political entity charged with \nthe control and supervision of all law enforcement personnel in the Saint Croix County Sheriffs \nDepartment, including defendants Dennis H. Hillstead, Karen Humphrey, Terry Larson and John \nand Jane Doe 1 through 30.  Defendant St. Croix County is subject to suit in the State of \nWisconsin. \n7. \nDefendant Dennis H. Hillstead (\"Hillstead\")  is, and at all relevant times was, the duly \nappointed and acting Sheriff of Saint Croix County.

All causes of action brought against defendant Hillstead are brought both \nindividually and in his capacity as the St. Croix County Sheriff.  Defendant Hillstead is subject \nto suit in the State of Wisconsin. \n150 14068.1  - 4 -  \n\ni \n8. \nOn information and belief,  defendant Karen Humphrey (“Humphrey”) is, and at all \nrelevant times was, the duly appointed and acting “Jail Captain” of the St. Croix County Jail and \nwas a duly appointed and acting Deputy Sheriff of  St. Croix County.

As such, defendant Voltz was \na duly appointed agent authorized to enforce the law, and was acting under the color of the law \nat all times herein material.  All causes of action brought against defendant Voltz are brought \nagainst him individually only.  Defendant Voltz is subject to suit in the State of Wisconsin. \n10. \nDefendant Kristen Anderson  (“Anderson”) is, and at all relevant times was,  a duly \nappointed and acting Deputy  Sheriff employed by  St. Croix County.  As  such,  defendant \nAnderson was a duly appointed agent authorized to enforce the law, and was acting under the \ncolor of the law at all times herein material.  All causes of action brought against defendant \nAnderson are brought both individually and in her capacity as a St. Croix County Deputy Sheriff. \nDefendant Anderson is subject to suit in the State of Wisconsin. \n15014 068.1  - 5 -  \n\n11. \nDefendant Terry Larson (“Larson”) is, and at all relevant times was, a duly appointed and \nacting Deputy Sheriff employed by St. Croix County.  As such, defendant Larson was a duly \nappointed agent authorized to enforce the law, and was acting under the color of the law at all \ntimes herein material.  All causes of action brought against defendant Larson are brought both \nindividually and in his capacity as a St. Croix County Deputy Sheriff.  Defendant Larson is \nsubject to suit in the State of Wisconsin. \n12. \nDefendants Deputy Sheriffs John and Jane Doe 1 through 30 (“the Doe defendants”) are \nunidentified St. Croix County Deputy Sheriffs who conducted, participated in, observed and/or \nvideotaped the strip searches of plaintiffs David Blihovde and Travis Brecher and/or conducted, \nparticipated in, observed and/or videotaped the strip searches of other class members performed \nat the St. Croix County Jail between May 1, 1996, and February 27, 2001. At all relevant times, \nthe Doe defendants were duly appointed and acting Deputy Sheriffs employed by  St. Croix \nCounty. As such, the Doe defendants were duly appointed agents authorized to enforce the law, \nand were acting under the color of the law at all times herein material.  All causes of action \nbrought against the Doe defendants are brought both individually and in their capacity as St. Croix \nCounty Deputy Sheriffs.  The Doe defendants are subject to suit in the State of Wisconsin. \nPlaintiffs believe that appropriate discovery will reveal the identities of all Deputy Sheriffs that \nparticipated in the unconstitutional strip searches conducted of plaintiffs and the class members. \nI50 14068.1  - 6 -  \n\nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS \n13. \nOn or about December 28 , 1998, plaintiff David Blihovde was detained by defendant Voltz \nfor suspected operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated.  He was transported to the St. Croix \nCounty Jail. At the Jail, David Blihovde was given a breath test and brought to the booking desk \nwhere he was made to remove all his clothing in the hallway and in plain view of at least one \nfemale Deputy Sheriff.  He was made to stand naked in the hallway while persons of both sexes \nwalked through the hallway and around him.  When he asked why he was being made to stand \nnaked in the hallway, his jailers responded, “to show you what we can do to you if you don’t \ncooperate.”  He was then given a jail uniform, escorted to a holding cell and told to call his wife \nto come and pick him up. \n14. \nOn or about April 11,  1999, plaintiff Travis Brecher was stopped in Hudson, Wisconsin, \nfor having a taillight out on his truck.  He produced a revoked drivers license and was taken to \nthe St. Croix County Jail.  He was kept in a holding cell for several hours while he tried to reach \nsomeone to come and pick him up from the Jail. His jailers became increasingly agitated with his \ninability to find someone to bail him out of Jail and finally told him that they would have to book \nhim.  After he was booked, he was escorted to a small room where he was made to remove all \nhis cloths.  He was then made to bend over and touch his toes so that a visual rectal search could \nbe performed. \n- 7 -  \n15014068.1 \n\n15. \nThe strip searches of David Blihovde and Travis Brecher were performed pursuant to the \ncustom and/or policy of the St. Croix County Sheriffs Department of strip searching arrestees \nbooked into the Jail.  This custom and/or policy was in furtherance of, and/or an interpretation \nof, a written Strip Search Policy of the St. Croix County Sheriff, entitled: “St. Croix County \nSheriffs  Department - Jail Division Policy and Procedure - Title: Strip Searches” effective May \n5, 1996 (“the Strip Search Policy”).  The Strip Search Policy stated: \nIn order  to ensure the highest level of security, the  St. Croix \nCounty Jail staff willperform strip searches on all persons entering \nthe jail.  (Emphasis added). \nIt defined a Strip Search as: \nA  search in which an inmate or arrested persons  (sic) genitals, \npubic area, buttocks or anus, or females breasts is uncovered and \neither is exposed to view or is touched by the person conducting the \nsearch. \n16. \nOn information and belief, it was the custom and/or policy of St. Croix County, acting \nthrough the St. Croix County Sheriffs Department, to interpret this written policy to mean that \narrestees booked into the St. Croix County Jail should be strip searched.  Thus, on information \nand belief, pursuant to this written policy and/or the County’s custom and/or policy and/or the \nDeputy Sheriff‘s interpretation, the County strip searched , without individual cause or suspicion, \n- 8 -  \n15014 068.1 \n\narrestees booked into the Jail.  It was the position of the St. Croix County and the St. Croix \nCounty Sheriffs Department that no cause was needed for these searches. \n17. \nOn information and belief, St. Croix County trained and told its Deputy Sheriffs that \narrestees booked into the Jail should be striped searched.  As a basis for these beliefs, plaintiffs \nstate that defendant Anderson gave an interview on June 6, 2001, in conjunction with an internal \ninvestigation of the County’s custom andor policy regarding strip searches and the Sheriffs Strip \nSearch Policy (“Anderson interview”). In that interview Deputy Anderson stated that she had been \n“trained and told and the policy reflected that everyone that comes in and stays and that changes in \nto a uniform, shall be strip searched before being placed in to a housing unit.” \n18. \nThe Strip Search Policy was in effect from May 1, 1996 to February 27, 2001, and, on \ninformation and belief, it was the custom and/or policy of St. Croix County to strip search \narrestees booked into the Jail between May 1,  1996 and February 27, 2001.  As a basis for these \nbeliefs, plaintiffs state that in the Anderson interview, defendant Anderson, when asked to estimate \nhow many strip searches she had performed since becoming a jailer in December of 1995, stated \n“thousands, every person that comes through here.”  Further, in an interview with defendant \nLarson performed during the same internal investigation, defendant Larson confirmed that he \nwould strip search every person that he booked in and gave a uniform to prior to placing that \nindividual in the Jail Block area.  Further, plaintiffs are aware of at least four other arrestees that \nwere strip searched during the relevant period of time, including two teenage girls that have \nalready settled claims against the County stemming from their illegal strip searches. \n15014068.1  - 9 -  \n\n. \n. \nI. \n’. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n19. \nThis action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to the \nprovisions of Rules 23(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiffs bring this \naction on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, as the representative members of \nthe following class, subject to the six year statute of limitations: \nAll arrestees strip searched at the St. Croix County Jail between \nMay  5,  1996, and  February  27,  2001,  pursuant  to  St.  Croix \nCounty’s custom and/or policy of strip searching arrestees booked \ninto the St. Croix County Jail and/or pursuant  to the St. Croix \nCounty Sheriffs written Strip Search Policy. \nNumerosity, \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(l) \n20. \nThe class is so numerous that joinder of the individual members of the proposed class is \nimpracticable. The class, upon information and belief, includes thousands ofmembers. As the basis \nfor this belief, plaintiffs state that in the Anderson interview, defendant Anderson stated that she had \nbeen ajailer at the St. Croix County Jail since December of 1995 and that during those five and one \nhalf years she had conducted “thousands” of strip searches on “every person that comes through \nhere.”  While the exact number and identities of class members are unknown at this time and can \nonly be ascertained through appropriate investigation and discovery, plaintiffs believe that the \nmembers of the class are readily identifiable from records of defendant St. Croix County. \nI501 4068.1  -  10 - \n\nExistence and predominance of Common Questions of Law and Fact, \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) and 23(3) \n21. \nQuestions of law and fact arising out of the strip searches conducted on thousands of \nindividuals at the St. Croix County Jail are common to all members of the class and predominate \nover any questions affecting only individual members of the class. \n22. \nThe members of the class seek to remedy a common legal grievance. They were all similarly \nvictimized by the St. Croix County’s custom andor policy of strip searching arrestees booked into \nthe St. Croix County Jail. All members of the class were strip searched regardless of their individual \ncircumstances or the circumstances of their arrests. All the searches were preformed as a matter of \ncourse, policy andor custom, without cause, and with no analysis of the chances that any class \nmember was concealing contraband or weaponry. There were no material variations in the nature \nof the strip searches performed, although, on information and belief, some of the strip searches may \nhave been conducted by, or observed by, officers of the opposite sex and/or videotaped. \nTypicality of Claims, \nFed. R Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n23. \nPlaintiffs’ claims are typical of the members of the class. Plaintiffs and all members of the \nclass sustained damages directly caused by the defendants’ wrongful, illegal and unconstitutional \nconduct. That conduct was similar, if not exactly the same, toward each of the class members, in \nthat each class member was illegally stnp searched pursuant to the County’s unconstitutional policy \nand/or custom of strip searching arrestees booked into the St. Croix County Jail.  The Fourth and \n15014 068.1  -  11 - \n\nFourteenth Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and of each class member were violated in the same \nmanner and through the same conduct. \nAdequate Representation, \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n24. \nPlaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the class. \nPlaintiffs have no interests adverse to the interests of absent class members. Plaintiffs, like all class \nmembers, were illegally strip searched pursuant to the County’s unconstitutional custom and/or \npolicy of strip searching arrestees booked into the St. Croix County Jail, and seek damages because \nof it.  Plaintiffs have retained counsel with significant experience in the prosecution of large, \ncomplex, multi-plaintiffs litigation as well as counsel with significant experience in the criminal \njustice system in St. Croix County, Wisconsin.  Plaintiffs’ counsel will vigorously prosecute this \naction. \nAppropriateness and Superiority, \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) \n25. \nA class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication \nof this litigation, since individual joinder of all members of the class is impracticable. Even if class \nmembers could afford individual litigation, the number of such individual actions would prove \nunduly burdensome to the courts. Individual litigation magnifies the delay and expense to all parties. \nBy contrast, the class action device presents far fewer management difficulties and provides the \nbenefits of unitary adjudication, economies of scale, and comprehensive supervision by a single \ncourt. Concentrating this litigation in one forum will promote judicial economy and efficiency and \n15014068.1  -  12 - \n\npromote parity among the claims of individual class members as well as judicial consistency. The \nconduct of this action as a class action presents fewer management difficulties, conserves the \nresources of the parties and the court system, and protects the rights of each class member. Notice \nof the pendency and of any resolution of this action can be provided to the class members by mailing \nandor by publication. \nCOUNT ONE \nDirected to defendants St. Croix County, Hillstead and Humphrey \n(Violation of  the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nConstitution of the United States and of 42 U.S . C. $19 83) \n26. \nPlaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, repeat, reallege and \nincorporate by reference, as if set forth here in their entirety, Paragraphs 1 through 25 above. \n27. \nWhen brought to the St. Croix County Jail, plaintiffs, and all class members, were strip \nsearched. \n28. \nThe strip searches conducted of plaintiffs and all class members were conducted pursuant \nto the County's blanket custom and custom and/or policy of strip searching arrestees entering the \nSt. Croix County Jail and/or pursuant to the St, Croix County Sheriffs written Strip Search Policy \ndescribed above.  The written Strip Search Policy and/or the custom and/or policy of St. Croix \nCounty  did  not  require  probable  cause,  reasonable  belief,  reasonable  suspicion  or  any \nindividualized reason to believe  or  suspect that  the plaintiffs or any class member  was  in \npossession of, or concealing, contraband or weaponry.  The strip searches were performed on \n15014 068. i  -  13 - \n\narrestees regardless of offense, reason for detention, or cause, and with no analysis of cause or \nnecessity.  As such, each search constituted an illegal and unconstitutional search in violation of \nthe Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches. \n29. \nDefendants  St.  Croix  County,  Humphrey  and  Hillstead  drafted,  established and/or \nfollowed the written Strip Search Policy and the custom and/or policy of strip searching arrestees \nbooked into the St. Croix County Jail.  Defendants St. Croix County, Humphrey and Hillstead \nknew, should have known, or were deliberately indifferent to the fact that arrestees booked into \nthe Jail were being strip searched, regardless of offense, reason for detention or cause, and failed \nto alter either the written strip search policy or the custom and/or policy of strip searching \narrestees. \n30. \nAs  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  defendants  St.  Croix  County,  Hillstead  and \nHumphrey’s acts and/or omissions, as described herein, defendants St. Croix County,  Hillstead \nand Humphrey, while acting under color of state law, deprived plaintiffs, and all the class \nmembers, of their federal rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, in violation \nof the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and 42 U.S.C. \n5 1983. \n31. \nAs  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  defendants  St.  Croix  County,  Hillstead  and \nHumphrey’s acts, as described herein, plaintiffs, and the class members, suffered violations of \ntheir rights, privileges and immunities under the Constitution of the United States and suffered \nI50 14068. I  -  14 - \n\nhumiliation, pain, distress, anguish, anxiety, injury and pain and suffering and emotional distress, \nall to the plaintiffs’ and class members’ damage in an amount to be determined. \nCOUNT TWO \nDirected to defendant Voltz, Anderson, \nLarson and the Doe defendants \n(Violation of  the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the \nConstitution of the United States and of 42 U.S . C. $19 83) \n32. \nPlaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, repeat, reallege and \nincorporate by reference, as if set forth here in their entirety, Paragraphs 1 through 31 above. \n33. \nWhen brought to the St. Croix County Jail, plaintiffs, and all class members, were \nvariously strip searched by defendants Voltz, Anderson, Larson and/or one or more of the Doe \n~ \ndefendants. \n34. \nThe strip searches conducted of plaintiffs and all class members were conducted pursuant \nto the County’s blanket custom and/or policy of strip searching arrestees booked into the St. Croix \nCounty Jail  and/or pursuant  to the St.  Croix County Sheriffs written Strip Search Policy \ndescribed above.  The written Strip Search Policy and/or the custom and/or policy of St. Croix \nCounty  did  not  require  probable  cause,  reasonable  belief,  reasonable  suspicion  or  any \nindividualized reason to believe or  suspect that the plaintiffs or any  class member  was  in \npossession of, or concealing, contraband or weaponry.  The strip searches were performed on \n15014068.1  -  15 - \n\narrestees regardless of offense, reason for detention or cause and with no analysis of cause or \nnecessity. \n35. \nDefendant Voltz participated in the strip search of plaintiff Blihovde.  On information and \nbelief formed from the above-cited statements of defendants Anderson and Larson, defendants \nAnderson and Larson conducted and/or participated in the searches of numerous class members \nat the St. Croix County Jail.  The identities of the other Deputy Sheriffs involved in the Blihovde \nsearch, the Deputy Sheriffs involved in the Brecher search and the Deputy Sheriffs involved in \nthe searches of other class members are presently unknown, but include the doe defendants and \nmay include defendants Voltz, Anderson, and Larson. \n36. \nAs a matter of law, the involved officers and Deputy Sheriffs knew or should have known \nthat the strip searches were illegal and unconstitutional. Further, on information and belief, these \nsearches were conducted despite the involved officers and Deputy Sheriffs knowing as a matter \nof fact that they were illegal searches.  As a basis for this belief, plaintiffs state that defendant \nAnderson in the Anderson interview stated that she was told at “Jail School”  a training facility \n-- \napparently not run by  St. Croix County -- that such searches were illegal and that she had \ndiscussed her concerns about the illegal nature of the searches with one of her St. Croix County \nsupervisors.  Defendant Anderson also stated that five other St. Croix County Deputy Sheriffs \nattended the same “Jail School” with her and were told that such searches were illegal. \n15014068.1  -  16 - \n\nI  ~L..
