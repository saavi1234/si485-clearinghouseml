    "summary": "<p>Pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") conducted an investigation of conditions at the Mercer County Geriatric Center (\"MCGC\"), a public nursing home facility in New Jersey, evidently operated by Mercer County.  The investigation resulted in an October 9, 2002, findings letter being sent to the County Executive.  The letter stated that in December 2001, DOJ advised county officials of its intent to conduct an investigation of the facility pursuant to CRIPA authority, but the county and its counsel wholly declined to cooperate in the investigation.  The investigation occurred nonetheless, even though the county's attorney interfered with the investigators' access to the MCGC's residents.  The letter stated that non-cooperation is one factor considered adversely when drawing conclusions about a facility, but the DOJ explained it also relied upon federal and state survey information, news articles, medical records, family interviews, private attorney and advocate interviews, and publicly available data.</p><p>The letter advised that the DOJ's investigation led it to find that certain conditions at MCGC violated residents' federal rights, in that (1) Mercer County did not maintain sanitary and safe living conditions at MCGC; (2) MCGC residents did not receive adequate medical and mental health care; (3) MCGC residents were denied rehabilitation, restorative care, and freedom from unreasonable restraints; (4) MCGC mealtime assistance, nutrition, and hydration practices were not adequate; (5) MCGC residents were not treated in the most integrated setting appropriate to individual resident needs; and (6) staffing, administration, and policy deficiencies contributed to inadequate care at MCGC.  Among the policy deficiencies listed was the county's denial of MCGC residents' First Amendment right to communicate with federal officials who were conducting the CRIPA investigation.</p><p>The DOJ findings letter proposed remedial actions to remedy the deficiencies, invited the county to address the issues, and alerted the county to the possibility of a CRIPA lawsuit brought by the United States to compel remedial action.</p><p>Negotiations evidently followed, because the county and the DOJ eventually entered into a settlement agreement obligating the county to improve a wide range of policies and practices at MCGC.  The settlement contained substantive provisions addressing (A) assessment and care planning, (B) restraints and medication usage, (C) mealtime assistance, resident nutrition, and hydration practices, (D) therapeutic activities, rehabilitation, and restorative care, (E) mental health care, (F) treatment in the most integrated setting appropriate to individualized needs, and (G) management, oversight, and training.  The settlement allowed for DOJ and its' consultants to retain access privileges to MCGC, its residents, and documents and records, for monitoring and technical assistance purposes, as well as to have access privileges to alternative placement settings.  Further, the agreement called for the county to fund a jointly agreed-upon monitor.  The county had 180 days to implement the changes called for in the settlement document which, by its terms, expired in three years. Attorneys for the county signed the agreement on December 28, 2004, followed by relevant DOJ officials' signatures being added on February 18, 2005, when the document and its attached monitoring protocol were received by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.  The same date, the United States filed its complaint against the county and its subdivision and officials responsible for the operation of the MCGC.  The CRIPA-based complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, citing the deficiencies at MCGC and alleging that the defendants' conduct violated residents' federal constitutional, statutory, and regulatory rights, including those provided by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., the nursing home reform provisions of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3 and 1396r, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (and implementing regulations).</p><p>District Judge Garrett E. Brown, Jr., signed the settlement as the order and judgment of the court October 14, 2005.  The judge's unpublished order of November 29, 2005, appointed Marie Boltz as monitor in the case.  Her subsequent reports were attached as part of the United States' status reports to the court on the case.</p><p>On Nov. 24, 2008, the parties jointly moved to conditionally dismiss the case with one year of oversight in response to the defendants' progress implementing the settlement agreement. The court granted the motion on Jan. 9, 2009. The defendants moved to dismiss the case on Aug. 6, 2010, which the court granted later that month.</p><p>The case is closed.</p>",

      "text": "Findings Letter for Mercer County Geriatric Center Page 1of 9\nRobert D. Prunetti \nCounty Executive \n640 South Broad Street \nP.O. Box 8068 \nTrenton, NJ 08650-0068 \nRe: CRIPA Investigation of Mercer County Geriatric Center \nDear Mr. Prunetti: \nOn December 10, 2001, we notified you that we were investigating the Mercer County Geriatric Center \n(MCGC) pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997. \nConsistent with statutory requirements, we are now writing to advise you of our findings, supporting \nfacts, and recommended remedial measures, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997b(a)(1). \nUnfortunately, Mercer County officials declined to cooperate with this investigation. They refused to \nturn over any documents, allow access to the facility, or permit any on-site witness interviews. Mercer \nCounty's conduct is unusual in this regard. Most government officials cooperate with CRIPA \ninvestigations because they recognize that protecting the rights of institutionalized citizens warrants a \nthorough and impartial review.  \nWe met promptly with County officials to explain the reasons for our investigation and its procedures. \nWe then also communicated repeatedly with County officials in an effort to convince them that \ncooperation was in the public interest and could only improve the fact-finding process. If the County had \nagreed to our proposed investigation procedures, County officials would have had an early opportunity \nto work directly with our experts and staff. They also would have had an opportunity to address any \nidentified problems on a voluntary basis at an early stage of this investigation. County officials declined, \nhowever, to provide even the most basic policies and procedures, access to staff, or even exculpatory \ndocuments. Most recently, County officials, through their attorney, Harry G. Parkin, interfered with our \naccess to the residents themselves. These residents are all independent witnesses, and your counsel \noffered no legal basis for such an unusual act. \nAs we repeatedly advised you and your counsel, however, our investigations proceed regardless of \nwhether officials choose to cooperate. Indeed, when CRIPA was enacted, lawmakers considered the \npossibility that local officials might not assist a federal investigation. Such non-cooperation is a factor \nthat may be considered adversely when drawing conclusions about a facility. We now draw such an \nadverse conclusion. The County's non-cooperation is, however, only one factor that we have considered \nin preparing our statutory findings and recommendations. We have also considered federal and state \nsurvey information, news articles, medical records, family interviews, private attorney and advocate \ninterviews, and publicly available data. \nAccording to our information, MCGC houses approximately 200 residents and has a 240-bed capacity. \nMCGC participates in both Medicare and Medicaid and provides nursing home services for an elderly \npopulation with significant medical problems. Approximately 57% of the residents are incontinent, 26% \nhave restricted joint motion, 38% need help in eating, and 35% have behavioral symptoms. (1)  \nUnder the United States Constitution and federal law, nursing home residents have a right to reasonably \nsafe living conditions, adequate health care, restorative and rehabilitative care services, freedom from \nunreasonable restraints, and a treatment setting that is the most integrated and appropriate based on \nindividual resident needs. See United States Constitution Amendments I, XIV; Youngberg v. Romeo, \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/mercercounty.htm 8/3/2007\n\nFindings Letter for Mercer County Geriatric Center Page 2of 9\n457 U.S. 307 (1982); Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 582 (1999). Federal statutes governing the operation of \nnursing homes and their implementing regulations create similar rights. See, e.g., Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (ADA); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 \nU.S.C.A. § 794 (Section 504); Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs (Medicaid) 42 U.S.C. §\n1396r; Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled (Medicare) 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3; 42 C.F.R. § 483 \nSubpart B. \nBased upon our investigation, we find that Mercer County has violated the federal rights of MCGC \nresidents. \nI. MCGC residents are exposed to unsafe living conditions.  \nMercer County does not maintain sanitary and safe living conditions at MCGC.  \nFirst, the facility does not maintain sanitary living conditions. Family members report finding feces on \nthe fingernails of their relatives, unchanged diapers, a stench in living areas, and dirty sheets. On more \nthan one occasion, state surveyors cited MCGC for failing to serve food at temperatures that are safe \nfrom food-borne pathogens. Surveyors have also noted concerns with staff hand-washing practices, \ndisinfection techniques, tuberculosis prevention, and infection control investigations. For instance, \nsurveyors observed improper cleaning of an incontinent resident. The surveyors noted that the resident's \nsacrum and buttocks were covered with feces. Staff changed a wound dressing and rinsed the area with \nsome saline solution. They did not, however, use soap and water to disinfect. This resident had only \nrecently been hospitalized for septic shock and dehydration. These types of problems have appeared in a \nnumber of surveys and been identified by a number of sources. \nSecond, the facility fails to ensure residents' personal safety. Staff have left residents, including those \nwith mobility and mental impairments, completely unattended for long periods of time. Staff inattention \nin general results in serious accidents, falls and unexplained injuries. For example, one visiting family \nmember repeatedly found her relative lying on the floor of the facility. On at least one occasion, the \nresident wandered out of the facility itself. From the time another resident entered the facility to the time \nof her discharge, she suffered from numerous falls, bone fractures, and unexplained injuries. One time, \nthe resident was dropped on her head while being moved. How this could happen if staff had been \nattentive was never explained satisfactorily to the resident's relatives. In a third example, a family \nmember used to visit at odd hours, only to find her unattended relative lying in urine, with parts of her \nnaked body exposed. This family member also noted unexplained skin bruises.  \nThese types of personal safety problems extend beyond mere resident neglect. MCGC also has problems \nwith staff verbal abuse and the unexplained disappearance of residents' personal belongings. Residents' \nglasses, dentures, bedding, and other personal possessions reportedly disappear, and then the facility \nstaff fail to investigate adequately or remedy the situation. Visitors have observed that staff \ninappropriately berate residents who rely on those staff for their daily care. \nII. MCGC residents do not receive adequate medical and mental health care. \nMCGC medical staff fail to assess and treat residents properly for potentially serious medical and mental \nhealth problems. When basic medical care is not provided, fragile geriatric residents often face increased \nrisk of harm from their medical conditions and inappropriate medication practices.  \nFor instance, during a recent inspection, surveyors reported that MCGC staff did not obtain information \nrequired to develop individualized, comprehensive treatment plans to address resident weight loss and \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/mercercounty.htm 8/3/2007\n\nFindings Letter for Mercer County Geriatric Center Page 3of 9\ndehydration. Another survey found problems with treatment and prevention of bedsores. A number of \nsources report residents with deep, bleeding bedsores, infections, and other potentially life-threatening \nconditions. In a nursing home, it is essential that staff take vigorous action to prevent and treat such \nconditions. \nMCGC's weakness in assessing and treating serious medical conditions also includes the treatment of \nmental health problems. Many nursing home residents have dementia, schizophrenia, and other \npsychiatric diagnoses. Where warranted, appropriate mental health care and review should be closely \nintegrated into the resident's general care plan. We noted deficiencies at MCGC in the documentation \nand drug practices associated with treating such mental illnesses. For instance, a resident was kept on the \nsame drug regimen for an extended period of time without adequate justification in the resident record. \nA state survey suggests that the facility staff fail to appreciate how resident mental health issues may act \nas a contributing factor to other medical problems. In one case, a resident with possible depression lost \napproximately 22% percent of her body weight. MCGC social services recommended a psychiatric \nevaluation, but the facility staff failed to respond in a timely manner. In a second case, a resident also \nexhibited symptoms of weight loss and depression. Yet, in both cases, MCGC staff apparently failed to \nfollow-up on the symptoms of depression by conducting prompt, comprehensive causal assessments and \nappropriate professional intervention.  \nInadequate medication practices contribute to problems with medical and mental health care. MCGC \nstaff have failed to provide adequate pain medication to some residents; provided medications without \nadequate monitoring of their effects; and prescribed or terminated medications to residents for reasons \nthat are not supported by resident medical data. A number of examples illustrate this problem. For \ninstance, staff prescribed Zyprexa to one resident for restlessness, delusions, and self-injury. Yet, when \nasked by surveyors, staff could not explain what delusions the resident actually experienced, nor could \nthey identify any examples of resident self-injury. If the medication was for restlessness only, that would \nbe an inappropriate reason in this case for prescribing an anti-psychotic medication. In another example, \na resident had to take medications through a gastrostomy tube. Inspectors noticed however that the \nmedication nurse administered medications and food to this resident without properly checking that the \ntube was actually in place. This failure was cited as a departure from basic standards of practice. In a \nthird example, surveyors discovered medical staff were giving a resident two different medications on a \ndaily basis, despite a physician's order to the contrary.  \nIII. MCGC residents are denied rehabilitation, restorative care, and freedom from unreasonable \nrestraints. \nWhen a facility lacks comprehensive assessment, rehabilitation, and restorative treatment programs, \nresidents are more likely to lose their living skills. When treatment options are limited and as a resident's \ncondition deteriorates, nursing home staff sometimes rely on inappropriate restraints as a substitute for \ntreatment. MCGC denies residents rehabilitation and restorative care, and instead relies on inappropriate \nrestraints. \nWhile MCGC residents may have access to some recreational programs, the facility does not always \ndevelop the individualized restorative care and rehabilitation programs needed to maintain or improve \nresident functioning. For example, a resident entered the facility able to walk, eat, and use the bathroom \nwith little or no staff assistance. Within a few days of his admission, however, MCGC staff obtained a \nphysician's order to keep the resident in bed with side rails and a bed alarm. No assessment was made to \njustify the use of these measures. Even as the resident's physical condition declined, the treatment team \nfailed to develop a plan to try to help the resident regain his former functional level. In the month after \nhis arrival, the resident lost seventeen pounds and developed pressure sores. Shortly afterwards, the \nresident had to be hospitalized. \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/mercercounty.htm 8/3/2007\n\nFindings Letter for Mercer County Geriatric Center Page 4of 9\nSecond, staff sometimes rely on inappropriate restraints instead of providing appropriate, individualized, \ninterdisciplinary care. Data reported by MCGC itself suggests restraint usage rates at least two times the \nState average. Staff routinely restrain residents while the staff engage in various tasks. For instance, one \nresident was frequently tied to his chair. He apparently beat on the arms of the chair so often that his \narms were constantly bloodied. In addition to physical restraints, some reports indicate the inappropriate \nuse of medication as restraints. Both physical and chemical restraints are inappropriate when they are \nused for the convenience of staff. \nIV. MCGC mealtime assistance, nutrition, and hydration practices are not adequate. \nMCGC's own data suggests that some 38% of MCGC residents are very dependent on staff for mealtime \nassistance. A breakdown in the facility's system for feeding residents therefore exposes large numbers of \nresidents to serious risk of harm. While feeding issues are often complicated in a geriatric population, \nMCGC has failed to develop consistent and appropriate nutrition and hydration plans.  \nThus, we have reports of residents losing ten percent or more of their body weight after just a month's \nstay in MCGC. Even as they lost such large amounts of weight, staff failed to develop appropriate \nintervention and feeding assistance plans. We have reports of residents who could not get a drink of \nwater because staff failed to assist with their hydration. \nMCGC administrators and staff have long been aware of deficiencies with the facility's nutrition and \nhydration practices. State surveyors have repeatedly advised Mercer County officials of a number of \nincidents. For example, there have been at least two hospitalizations identified in recent state survey \nreports regarding residents who suffered from dehydration and other problems. Our own review of \nresident deaths found signs of improper nutrition and malnourishment in some cases. Separately, one of \nour sources reported the case of a resident with an improperly positioned feeding tube. This resident \nslowly starved without adequate MCGC staff intervention. \nIn one particularly serious incident, staff fed a resident so quickly, she aspirated and died. Emergency \nroom hospital physicians pumped a significant volume of food from the resident's lungs. If staff are \nproperly trained in feeding practices and sensitive to residents' mealtime assistance needs, it is difficult \nto explain how such an incident could occur. This incident took place in January 2002, just weeks after \nwe met with County officials to request their cooperation in our CRIPA investigation. County officials \nhave continued to ignore all of our requests for information pertaining to such resident deaths. \nV. MCGC residents are not treated in the most integrated setting appropriate to individual \nresident needs. \nUnder federal law, MCGC residents have the right to be treated in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their individual needs. At MCGC, however, staff make little effort to identify options for \nproviding more integrated treatment settings. When combined with a failure to develop restorative \ntreatment programs, MCGC's failure to address the integration issue may result in the unnecessary \ninstitutionalization of some residents. Alternatively, it may result in excessively segregated treatment \nwithin a nursing home setting. \nOur sources report little discussion by treatment teams regarding resident discharge issues, and the \ntreatment meetings themselves do not include family members on a regular basis. Treatment plans also \nreflect the lack of an interdisciplinary approach.  \nWhen discharge and hospitalization decisions take place without adequate planning, inappropriate and \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/mercercounty.htm 8/3/2007\n\nFindings Letter for Mercer County Geriatric Center Page 5of 9\npotentially dangerous situations may arise. For instance, in one case, lack of thorough discharge \nplanning may have resulted in the premature discharge of a resident whose medical condition was still \nvery fragile. After this resident was sent home, a visiting nurse complained that the resident needed \nemergency hospitalization. In another example, MCGC delayed providing a highly-functional resident \nwho was deaf with interpreter services for nearly a year. If that resident was a candidate for services at \nhome or in another community setting, this failure to accommodate a disability effectively resulted in \nthe lengthy and improper segregation of the resident from society. \nVI. Staffing, administration, and policy deficiencies contribute to inadequate care. \nOur concerns about deficiencies with respect to resident care are heightened by a number of other \nsystemic issues. \nFirst, MCGC has staffing issues that contribute to deficiencies in care. Nurse staffing is a particular \nweakness at this facility. Our data indicates that MCGC registered nurse staffing levels fall well below \nthe state average. Complaints about inadequate nurse response times, gaps in physician and psychiatrist \noversight, and the County's unwillingness to share staffing data all evidence significant staffing \nproblems. \nSecond, the County's policy towards residents' civil rights also causes us concern. While we recognize \nthat jurisdictions may have legitimate reasons to monitor access to their facilities, Mercer County has \ngone one step further. They recently have denied us access to the residents themselves. As we have \nexplained to the County in separate correspondence, interfering with communications between residents \nand federal officials is a violation of both federal law and state policy. See United States Constitution \nAmendments I, XIV; In re Quarles 158 U.S. 532, 535-36 (1895) (discussing right of citizens to \ncommunicate with federal law enforcement officials regarding violations of federal law); Lutz v. City of \nrd\nYork, 899 F.2d 255, 263-266 (3  Cir. 1990) (noting strict limits on State's ability to interfere with \ntransactions between United States government and its citizens); see, e.g., Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. \n483, 485 (1969) (institutionalized persons retain freedom to petition government for redress of \ngrievances); see, also, New Jersey Rules of Professional Conduct Rules 3.4, 4.4. Residents do not lose \ntheir civil rights simply because they rely on the County for care. The County's approach towards the \nresidents and their families is problematic. Such an approach can reflect or result in an institutional \nenvironment that places institutional interests over resident rights. \nMINIMUM REMEDIAL MEASURES \nIn order to remedy the identified deficiencies and to protect the constitutional and federal rights of \nMCGC residents, MCGC should implement, at minimum, the following measures:  \nI. Resident safety and living conditions. \nA. Regularly provide pre-service and in-service training for staff on resident care \nprocedures. Such training must address general resident supervision, wound treatment, \nresident hygiene, and infection control. Facility management and medical administrators \nmust begin direct and vigorous monitoring of the direct care staff's actual resident care \npractices and policy compliance. More particularly, training and procedures must address \nimplementation of individualized resident care plans, cleaning and prevention of bedsores, \ncommunicable disease prevention, catheter use, hand-washing, facility maintenance, \nresident grooming, and prevention of injuries.\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/mercercounty.htm 8/3/2007\n\nFindings Letter for Mercer County Geriatric Center Page 6of 9\nB. Ensure that individual staff are specifically trained on the needs and treatment of \nresidents in their care. Staff must be evaluated in part on their compliance with care plans, \nand competency-based training must be incorporated into facility policies. \nC. Ensure that staff routinely assist residents with their personal hygiene needs as necessary \nunder their treatment and care plans. Where professionally indicated, such services must \ninclude assistance with toileting, dressing, and bathing. \nD. Develop and implement meaningful incident review, peer review, and quality \nimprovement procedures to allow investigation and follow-up of significant nursing home \nincidents. Issues to be targeted specifically, but not exclusively, include resident deaths, \nabuse, neglect, falls, unexplained injuries, property loss, medication errors, infectious \ndisease transmission, and training failures. Injury, abuse, death, and infection trends must be \nfully investigated, and emerging issues must be identified and addressed. While individual \nstaff accountability is a component of any staff oversight and quality improvement process, \nany such process must also identify systemic deficiencies and facility-wide remedies to \naddress such deficiencies. \nII. Medical and mental health care. \nA. Provide nursing home residents with comprehensive, clinically defensible, and \nindividualized treatment for their medical and mental health conditions.  \n1. Base medication prescriptions, behavioral interventions, and other treatment \non thorough resident assessments, valid and reliable data, clearly established \ngoals, and professionally justified diagnoses. \n2. Develop comprehensive treatment plans that are individualized for each \nresident. Such plans must address residents' medical, mental health, nursing, \ndisability, communication, discharge planning, and daily activity issues. Plans \nmust be developed by an interdisciplinary team that has representatives from all \nappropriate disciplines, including physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, \nnurses, therapists, direct care aides, nurses, and social workers. This treatment \nplanning process must be an ongoing one for each resident. Staff must monitor \nthe effectiveness of treatment and update treatment plans regularly.  \n3. Document treatment plans, behavioral programs, progress notes, medical \norders, and other information in resident medical records as required by \nprofessional standards. Reliable, valid data must underlie treatment and \nbehavioral planning decisions, and staff must be trained on proper \ndocumentation and data collection. \nB. Conduct mortality reviews on all deaths that have occurred at MCGC in the last three \nyears. Mortality reviews must be conducted by qualified, independent medical \nprofessionals. Mortality reviews must also be conducted regularly as part of any staff \noversight and quality improvement program. MCGC must take appropriate corrective action \nbased upon those reviews. \nC. Conduct regular, comprehensive audits of medication use at MCGC. Qualified, \nindependent medical professionals must be retained to target specifically any inappropriate \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/mercercounty.htm 8/3/2007\n\nFindings Letter for Mercer County Geriatric Center Page 7of 9\npoly-pharmacy, clinically indefensible prescriptions, or problems with medication \ndistribution and monitoring. \nIII. Rehabilitation, restorative care, and freedom from excessive restraints. \nA. Develop rehabilitation and restorative care programs to help residents improve or \nmaintain levels of functioning, ensure resident safety, and protect against excessive \nrestraints. These programs must be part of an integrated, individualized treatment process, \nand must reflect interdisciplinary planning. \n1. Develop rehabilitation and restorative care planning, policies, and protocols \nthrough structured procedures that allow facility-wide adoption and \nparticipation.  \n2. Tailor treatment plans to a resident's individual treatment goals, desires, \ninterests, and lifestyle preferences. \n3. As with resident treatment in general, monitor rehabilitation and restorative \ncare plans for effectiveness and update regularly. \nB. Implement policies to prevent inappropriate restraints. These policies must include \nsafeguards against clinically indefensible restraint orders, prohibition and deterrence of \nunauthorized restraint use, development of behavioral support programs, and improved \nmonitoring of individual and system-wide restraint use. \n1. Consistent with professional standards, make every reasonable effort to \nreduce the use of restraints at MCGC. Restraints must never be used for the \nconvenience of staff. \n2. At a minimum, limit restraints only to emergency situations as permitted by \nprofessional standards. If restraints are required, staff must promptly obtain \nnecessary physician authorization. Physicians and nursing managers must also \npersonally and frequently review such orders during the period a resident is \nrestrained.  \n3. Document properly all restraint usage at MCGC. Such documentation must \ninclude records on how often a resident was checked and the reasons for \nplacing the resident in restraints. The documentation must also include clear \ncriteria establishing when a resident should be released from restraints. \nAggregate and trend data must be collected and incorporated into facility staff \noversight and quality improvement processes. \n4. Require treatment teams to review and address causal factors, including \nbehavioral issues, that result in the restraint of a resident.  \n5. Develop policies and procedures to prevent the inappropriate use of \nmedications as restraints. Oversight of inappropriate staff restraint usage must \ninclude review of physicians who prescribe psychotropic and sedative \nmedications without professional justification.\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/mercercounty.htm 8/3/2007\n\nFindings Letter for Mercer County Geriatric Center Page 8of 9\n6. Prohibit use of any restraint methods that do not meet professional standards \nand have not been approved in advance by qualified medical management staff. \nIV. Mealtime assistance, resident nutrition, and hydration practices. \nA. Regularly assess residents for dehydration, weight loss, and swallowing difficulties. \nAppropriate mealtime assistance, nutrition, and hydration plans must be developed and \nimplemented. Necessary therapeutic positioning and functional seating programs must be \ndeveloped for residents to facilitate feeding. \nB. Carefully train and supervise staff in the implementation of nutrition and hydration plans. \nTraining must include competency-based training on mealtime procedures, supplemented \nwith quality monitoring of mealtimes. Only staff who have demonstrated competency with \nan individual's mealtime plan may provide assistance to that individual. \nC. Ensure that the kitchen prepares and serves meals in a safe manner.  \nV. Community integration and ADA. \nA. Assess residents to determine whether placement in the facility constitutes placement in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to individual needs. These assessments must be \nconducted in a manner consistent with a facility-wide policy and professional standards. \nAssessments must occur at admission and periodically during any resident's stay. If a more \nintegrated setting would appropriately meet an individual's needs, MCGC must develop \npromptly a transition plan that includes clear target dates, measurable goals and outcomes, \ntraining and transition strategies, and responsible staff. Discharge and transition planning \nmust be closely integrated into individual treatment plans. MCGC must identify barriers to \ndischarge, make reasonable efforts to address such barriers, and follow-up on discharged \nresidents in order to improve the quality of the discharge process. \nB. Make a greater effort to include re \nsidents and family members in the treatment and discharge planning process. \nC. Provide reasonable accommodations for disabilities to ensure meaningful participation in \ntreatment and activities by residents with disabilities. \nVI. Staffing, administration, and policy. \nA. Retain sufficient numbers of qualified registered nurses, aides, licensed practical nurses, \ntherapists, nutritionists, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and physicians to \nprovide adequate care.  \nB. Develop and implement accurate and reliable systems for identifying problems with \nindividual resident care, problems with facility-wide practices, and root causes for serious \nincidents. Incidents must be reported accurately to all appropriate federal, state, and local \nofficials. \nC. Maintain accurate, current, complete, and organized records on resident care. The quality \nassurance procedures must address the quality and accuracy of records.\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/mercercounty.htm 8/3/2007\n\nFindings Letter for Mercer County Geriatric Center Page 9of 9\nD. Fully protect residents' legal rights, including their First Amendment right to \ncommunications with government officials. Mercer County must allow residents to meet \nwith governmental and legal representatives. \nWe invite the County to discuss with us these remedial recommendations, with the goal of remedying \nthe identified constitutional and statutory violations without resort to litigation. In the event we are \nunable to reach a resolution regarding our concerns, we are obligated to advise you that the Attorney \nGeneral may initiate a lawsuit pursuant to CRIPA, to correct deficiencies or otherwise protect the rights \nof MCGC residents, 49 days after the receipt of this letter.  \n42 U.S.C. § 1997b (a)(1). Accordingly, we will soon contact County officials to discuss in more detail \nthe measures that the County must take to address the deficiencies identified in this letter.

While we presume these figures are correct, they are based principally on self-reported data.
