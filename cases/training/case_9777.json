    "summary": "<p>On April 24, 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division (\"DOJ\") sent a findings letter to Arkansas's governor, advising him of the results of the Spring 2003, DOJ investigation of conditions and practices at the Conway Human Development Center (\"CHDC\"), a facility housing developmentally disabled persons, including those with intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and/or autism.  The investigation occurred under the authority of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (\"CRIPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  DOJ and expert consultants visited the facility, reviewed a wide array of documents there, and conducted interviews with personnel and residents.  The letter commended CHDC staff for providing a high level of cooperation during the investigation, as well as the dedication many showed for resident well-being.  Nevertheless, the investigation found deficiencies in resident care at CHDC, in that conditions and services at CDHC substantially departed from generally accepted standards of care. Constitutional and federal statutory rights of residents at CHDC were violated in several respects, according to the DOJ.</p><p>DOJ concluded that deficiencies in conditions of resident care and treatment at CHDC existed as to multiple topic areas, including CDHC's causing residents significant harm or risk of harm through inadequate: (1) health care (termed \"grossly deficient,\" with particular problems in \"terribly inadequate\" medical and neurological care, physical and nutritional management and therapy services, and infection control and medication administration practices); (2) habilitative treatment services (e.g., \"grossly deficient\" and unreviewed restraint practices; \"critically inadequate\" activity programming and psychiatric services; inadequately trained and supervised staff;  ineffective behavior programs; invalid data collection and recording practices;  poor medication management); and (3) protection from harm policies (e.g., failure to conduct mortality reviews after resident deaths, meager investigation of abuse or neglect incidents, inadequacies in residents' rights and consent policies); as well as CHDC's (4) failure to provide required special education and related services pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1401; and (5) failure to provide services to individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to individual residents' needs, pursuant to statutory obligations imposed by Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  The letter provided details of deficiencies for all five of these categories.  </p><p>Minimally-acceptable remedial measures for each of the five categories were outlined in the letter, which concluded by inviting continued further collaboration in implementing the remediation. The letter also provided notice that, absent a resolution of federal concerns, the DOJ would file a CRIPA lawsuit to compel correction of the identified deficiencies at CHDC.</p><p>On January 16, 2009, the DOJ filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  The complaint mirrored the findings letter.  The State filed an answer on February 17, 2009.</p><p>Over a year later, the U.S. filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction on March 9, 2010.  Arkansas opposed the motion, and on April 7, 2010, the court (Judge J. Leon Holmes) denied the motion.  Both parties then filed Motions for Partial Summary Judgment, which were denied by the court on July 30, 2010.</p><p>On August 27, 2010, a group of parents and guardians of residents of CHDC filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the state.  </p><p>A six-week bench trial was held in September 2010.  The court allowed the parties to extend the filing period for post-trial briefs to provide time for the transcripts to be prepared.  The court issued its findings on June 8, 2011.  The court found that the U.S. had not met its burden under the first claim for relief, that the practices at CHDC departed from generally accepted professional standards.  The court also found the U.S. failed to meet its burden for the second claim for relief, that CHDC was not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  On the U.S.'s third claim for relief, the court found that DOJ had shown that CHDC was not providing free appropriate public education for resident children.  However, because CHDC had submitted a proposal for changing their education policy to the appropriate state agency (Arkansas Department of Education) at the time of trial, the court did not find it necessary to take any action.  Accordingly, the court dismissed the action with prejudice.  The court denied, however, the state's later request for attorneys' fees and only awarded costs in the amount of $150,580.  Although the U.S. did not prove its case during the bench trial, the court found that CHDC had made certain changes in policies and practices, most likely as a result of the DOJ investigation.  Apparently, the court did not want to find the DOJ's claims frivolous or groundless and have to grant attorney's fees to the defendants.  The case is now closed.  </p><p></p>",

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nEASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS\nWESTERN DIVISION\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA PLAINTIFF\nv.  No. 4:09CV00033 JLH\nSTATE OF ARKANSAS; MIKE BEEBE, \nGovernor of the State of Arkansas, in his official \ncapacity only; JOHN M. SELIG, Director of the\nArkansas Department of Human Services, in his official\ncapacity only; JAMES C. GREEN, Ph.D., Director\nof the Arkansas Division of Developmental\nDisabilities Services, in his official capacity only;\nand CALVIN PRICE, Superintendent of the\nConway Human Development Center, in his\nofficial capacity only DEFENDANTS\nOPINION AND ORDER\nThe  United  States  of  America  brought this   action pursuant to the C ivil  Rights  of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (2006), et seq., alleging in Count I that conditions\nat Conway Human Development Center are so deplorable as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment\nto the Constitution of the United States; in C ount II that Conway Human Development Center\nviolates the integration mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (2006);\nand in Count III that Conway Human Development Center violates the rights of children guaranteed\nby the Individuals with Disabilities Education Actb y failing to provide them with a free appropriate\npublic education in the least restrictive environment, 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a) (2006).  After a six-week\ntrial, the Court found that Conway Hum an Development Center was in compliance with the\nFourteenth Amendment; that the plaintiff failed to prove that Conway Human Development Center\nwas in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act; that Conway Human Development Center\neducated children in the least restrictive environment but failed to provide a free appropriate public\neducation; and that no injunction was needed b ecause the agency charged wi th enforcing the\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Arkansas Department of Education, would ensure\nthat Conway Human Development Center would come into compliance.  The defendants have now\nmoved for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs.\nI.\nGenerally, successful litigants must pay their own attorneys’ f ees unless a statute or\ncontractual agreement provides otherwise.  See, e.g., Borntrager v. Cent. States Se. & Sw. Areas\nPension Fund, 577 F.3d 913, 924 (8th Cir. 2009) (citing Travelers Cas. & Sur. Co. of Am. v. Pac.\nGas & Elec. Co., 549 U.S. 443, 448, 127 S. Ct. 1199, 1203, 167 L. Ed. 2d 178 (2007)).  In support\nof their motion for attorneys’ fees, the de fendants invoke a provision of the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act that provides: “Ina ny action commenced under this section, the court\nmay allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee against the\nUnited States as part of the costs.”  42 U.S.C. § 1997a(b) (2006)1.  That provision, by use of the word\nmay, grants the Court discretion to award a reasonable fee to the prevailing party, other than the\nUnited States, but does not explain the factors to be considered or the standards that should inform\nthe Court’s exercise of discretion.  Cf. Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 417,\n98 S. Ct. 694, 698, 54 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1978) (interpretinag s imilarly-worded attorney’s fees provision\nand noting that the “question in the case before us is what standard should inform a district court’s\ndiscretion in deciding whether to award attorney’s fees to a successfuld efendant[.]”).  In a decision\nresolving a case similar to the present one, the Eleventh Circuit observed, “there must be standards\n1 The defendants also cite Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, bu tthey admittedly have not complied with the\nprocedure mandated by Rule 11(c)(2), so the Court will not address this rule.\n2\n\nto guide the district court’s exercise of discretion.”  Johnson v. Florida, 348 F.3d 1334, 1350 (11th\nCir. 2003).\nNo controlling precedent specifies the standards taht should inform a district court’s exercise\nof discretion in determining whether to award attorneys’ fees to a prevailing defendant pursuant to\nsubsection 1997a(b).  The defendants contend thata  prevailing defendant is presumptively entitled\nto attorneys’ fees in the abse nce of special circum stances, whereas the plaintiff contends that\nattorneys’ fees should be a warded to a prevailing defendant only if the action was frivolous,\nunreasonable, or without foundation. \nIn Christiansburg, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission unsuccessfully pursued\na Title VII action against a private em ployer.  434 U.S. at 413-15, 98 S.  Ct. at 696-97.  After a\nsuccessful summary judgment motion, the employer sought attorneys’ fees under Title VII’s\nattorneys’ fees provision, which provided,\nIn any action or proceeding under this title the court, in its discretion, may allow the\nprevailing party, other than the Com mission or the United States, a reasonable\nattorney’s fee as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be\nliable for costs the same as a private person. \nId.  The Supreme Court recognized that it hasa lready settled upon the rule that a prevailingp laintiff\nin a civil rights case “should ordinarily recover anat torney’s fee unless special circumstances would\nrender such an award unjust.”  Id. at 416-17.  The question in Christiansburg, however, was “what\nstandard should inform a district court’s discretion in deciding whether to award attorneys’ fees to\na successful defendant in a Title VII action.”  Id.\nBecause the attorney’s fees section provided “no indication whatever of the circumstances\nunder which either a plaintiff or a defendant should be entitled to attorney’s fees[,]” the Court did\nnot rely simply on the “plain meaning of the statute” to resolve the question before it.  Id. at 418. \n3\n\nInstead, the Court pointed to “twos trong equitable considerations counseling an attorney’s fee award\nto a prevailing T itle VII plaintiff that are w holly absent in the case of  a prevailing Title VII\ndefendant.”  Id.  “First . . . the plaintiff is the choseni nstrument of Congress to vindicate “ ‘a policy\nthat Congress considered of the highest priority.’ ” I d. (citing Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., 390\nU.S. 400, 402, 88 S. Ct. 964, 966, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1263 (196)8).  “Second, when a district court awards\ncounsel fees to a prevailing plaintiff, it is awadring them against a violator of federal law.” I d.  The\nCourt also sifted through the sparse legislative history of the attorney’s fees provision and found\nevidence that Congress intended “to m ake it easier for a plaintiff of lim ited means to bring a\nmeritorious suit” and to “ ‘deter the bringing of lawsuits without foundation’ by providing that the\n‘prevailing party’—be it plaintiff or defendant—could obtain legal fees.’ ” I d. at 420 (citingG  rubbs\nv. Butz, 548 F.2d 973, 975 (D.C. Cir. 1976)).  In light of these considerations, the Supreme Court\nheld that “a district court may in its discretion award attorney’s fees to a prevailing defendant in a\nTitle VII case upon a finding that the plaintiff’s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without\nfoundation[.]”  Id. at 421.\nIn Johnson, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the Supreme Court’s Christiansburg standard\napplies “to a claim for attorneys’ fees under [the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act].” \n348 F.3d at 1354.  The Eleventh Circuit interpreted 42 U.S.C. § 1997c(d) (2006), which provides:\n“In any action in which the United States joins as an intervenor under this section, the court may\nallow the prevailing party, other than the United Staets, a reasonable attorney’s fee against the United\nStates as part of the cos ts.”  Subsection 1997c(d), which controlled in  Johnson, differs from\nsubsection 1997a(b), which controls here, in that section 1997c authorizes the Attorney General to\nintervene in actions seeking relief for institutionalized persons, whereas section 1997a authorizes\n4\n\nthe Attorney General to institute civil actions to obtain relief for such persons.  Subsection 1997c(d)\nalso contains an additional sentence: “Nothing in this subsection precludes the award of attorney’s\nfees available under any other provisions of the United States Code.”  Otherwise, the two subsections\nare identical.  The parties her e do not argue, nor is there any apparent reason to conclude, that\nCongress intended different standards to apply to the effectively identical language of subsection\n1997a(b) and subsection 1997c(d).\nIn support of their argument that the Court should not adopt the Christiansburg standard in\napplying subsection 1997a(b), the defendants first ponit out that the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\nPersons Act, unlike other civil rights statutes, only exists for the purpose of providing the United\nStates with standing; it does not create any subs tantive rights.  In addition, subsection 1997a(b)\nspecifically disallows an award of attorney’s fees to the United States when it prevails.  It follows\nthat there can never be an attorney’s fees award to a prevailing plaintiff under the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act.  Therefore, the defendants urge, the Court should not interpret its\nprovisions in the same manner as traditional civil rights statutes.\nSecond, the defendants contend that the legis lative history supports the conclusion that\nattorney’s fees may be awarded pursuant to subsection 1997a(b) simply if a defendant prevails.  The\ndefendants rely on the House conference report on the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act\nwhich states, in pertinent part, \nIn both the initiation and intervention section,s the Act makes clear the liability of the\nUnited States to opposing parties for attorneys’ fees whenever it loses.  The award\nis discretionary with the court, and it is intended that the present standards used by\nthe courts under the civil rights laws will apply.\nH. Conf. Rep. No. 96-897, at 12 (1980), reprinted at 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 832, 837.  According to\nthe defendants, the “present standards” language refers to the standard set forward in Piggie Park,\n5\n\nnamely, that fees should ordinarily be awarded to the prevailing party in the absence of spec ial\ncircumstances.  The defendants also point out that  Christiansburg was decided only a few years\nbefore the Civil Rights of  Institutionalized Persons Act was enacted 2 and argue that because a\nnumber of district court and circuit court decisions post-dating  Christiansburg did not apply its\nstandard, Christiansburg was not “the present standards used by the courts under the civil rights\nlaws.”3 \nThird, the defendants contend that the rationale of Christiansburg is based on policies that\nprotect private plaintiffs who bring civil rights suits but do not apply to the Department of Justice,\nas, for example, the concern that the high cost of  attorneys’ fees might chill a private plaintiff’s\nassertion of his civil rights.  Priva te plaintiffs do not bring suit pursuant to the Civil Rights of\nInstitutionalized Persons Act, so, the def endants argue, the rationale behind the  Christiansburg\nstandard does not apply to subsection 1997a(b).\nFinally, the defendants contend that Geier v. Richardson, 871 F.2d 1310 (6th Cir. 1989),\nsupports imposition of the lower standard.  In  Geier, the United States intervened in a Title IX\ndesegregation case.  After lengthy and contentious litigation, all parties except for the United States\n2 However, the Senate report explicitly cites  Christiansburg when stating that the Ci vil\nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act attorneys’ fees provisions are “similar to that found in Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”  S. Rep. No. 96-416, at 68 n.86 (1979),  reprinted at 1980\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 787, 832.\n3 The plaintiff notes that most of these cases were reversed on appeal for failing to use the\ncorrect standard, namely, the one laid down in  Christiansburg.  Furthermore, a decision handed\ndown by the Supreme Court becomes the law of the land, regardless of the prior state of the law or\nwhether the decision has had time to percolate through the lower courts.  Cf. Holmberg v. Parratt,\n548 F.2d 745, 749 (8th Cir. 1977) (“[T]he Supreme Court has the right to enunciate a single supreme\nlaw of the land[.]”).  Therefore, by the time the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act was\nenacted, Christiansburg was the law of the land regarding thes tandards for a defendant’s motion for\nattorney’s fees in the civil rights context.\n6\n\nagreed to a consent decree.  The district court denied the United States’ challenges, and awarded\nattorneys’ fees to the private plaintiffs as prevailing parties.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed the district\ncourt’s award of attorneys’ fees.\nThese arguments are thoroughly and persuasively answered by the Johnson opinion.  348\nF.3d at 1351-54.  The Court need not reiterate Johnson’s reasoning here but will restate the most\ncompelling argument for the proposition that the Christiansburg standard applies.\nIt is a well-settled precept of statutory cons truction that statutory provisions t hat are\nsubstantially the same should be interpreted similarly.  See In re Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 592 F.3d 907,\n912 (8th Cir. 2010) (citing Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 129 S. Ct. 2294, 2301, 174 L. Ed. 2d\n22 (2009) (“Where, as here, Congress uses similar statutory language and similar statutory structure\nin two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar interpretations.”)); see also Indep. Fed’n of\nFlight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754, 758 n.2, 109 S. Ct. 2732, 2735 n.2, 105 L. Ed. 2d 639\n(1989) (“We have stated in the past that fee-shtiifng statutes’ similar language is ‘a strong indication’\nthat they are to be interpreted alike.”) (quoting Northcross v. Memphis Bd. of Educ., 412 U.S. 427,\n428, 93 S. Ct. 2201, 2202, 37 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1973)).  Titl eVII’s attorney’s fee provision, interpreted\nin Christiansburg, is substantially identical to subsection 1997a(b). C  ompare Christiansburg, 434\nU.S. at 414, n.1, 98 S. Ct. at 696, n.1 (“In any action or proceeding under this title the court, in its\ndiscretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the Com mission or the United States, a\nreasonable attorney’s fee as  part of the costs[.]”),  with 42 U.S.C. § 1997a(b) (“In any a ction\ncommenced under this section, the court may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States,\na reasonable attorney’s fee against the United States as part of the costs.”).\n7\n\nIn  accord with that basic rule of statut ory  construction, courts have applied t he\nChristiansburg standard to numerous attorney’s fees provisions outside of the Title VII context. S ee,\ne.g., Fox v. Vice, --- U.S. ---, 131 S. C t. 2205, 2215, 180 L. Ed. 2d 45 (2011) ( Christiansburg\nstandard applies to attorney’s fees provision of section 1988 of Title 42 of the United States Code\nwhich states: “In any action or proceeding to enf orce a provision of sections . . . of this title [or\ncertain other titles] . . . the court, in its discretion, m ay allow the prevailing party, other than the\nUnited States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs . . . .”); No Barriers, Inc. v. Brinker\nChili’s Tex., Inc., 262 F.3d 496, 498 (5th Cir. 2001) (Christiansburg standard applies to attorney’s\nfees provision of the Americans with Disabilities Act which states: “In any action or administrative\nproceeding commenced pursuant to this chapter, thec ourt or agency, in its discretion, may allow the\nprevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee . . . .” B);rooks v. Ctr. Park\nAssocs., 33 F.3d 585, 587 (6th Cir. 1994) ( Christiansburg standard applies to attorney’s f ees\nprovision of the Fair housing Act which states: “Ina  civil action under subsection (a) of this section,\nthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable\nattorney’s fee and costs.”); Homeward Bound, Inc. v. Hissom Mem’l Ctr., 963 F.2d 1352, 1354 n.1\n(10th Cir. 1992) (Section 1988 standards apply to tatorney’s fees provision of the Rehabilitation Act\nwhich states: “In any action or proceeding to enfo rce or charge a violation of a provision of this\nsubchapter, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States,\na reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs . . . .”).\nEven if some of the policy considerations re levant to the issue of  whether a prevailing\ndefendant should recover attorneys’ fees under theses tatutes are not relevant to subsection 1997a(b),\nthe language of that subsection is substantially similar to the language of those statutes.  Hence, they\n8\n\nshould  be interpreted sim ilarly.   Therefor e, this Court will interpret 42 U.S.C. § 1997a(b)\nconsistently with these statutes that are sim ilarly worded, which means that the Christiansburg\nstandard will guide the exercise of the Court’s discretion in deciding whether to award attorneys’\nfees to the defendants.\nII.\nThe Eighth Circuit has summarized the Christiansburg standard as follows:\nA prevailing defendant . . . is entitled to attorney’s f ees only in very narrow\ncircumstances.  A plaintiff should not be assessed his opponent’s attorney’s fees\nunless  the district   court  finds that  his  claim  was frivolous, unreasonable, or\ngroundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.  Even\nallegations that, upon careful examination, prove legally insufficient to require a trial\nare not, for that reason alone, groundless,  or without foundation as required by\nChristiansburg.  Rather, so long as the plaintiff has som e basis for his claim , a\nprevailing defendant may not recover attorneys’ fees.  Finally, we are mindful of the\nSupreme Court’s admonition to avoid post hoc reasoning by concluding that, because\na plaintiff did not ultimately prevail, his action m ust have been unreasonable or\nwithout foundation.  \nWilliams v. City of Carl Junction, Mo., 523 F.3d 841, 843 (8th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks\nand citations omitted).  Applying the Christiansburg standard, as interpreted by the Eighth Circuit,\nthe Court exercises its discretion not to award attorneys’ fees to the prevailing defendants in t his\ncase.\nBeginning the analysis with Count III, the claim that Conway Human Development Center\nwas in violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Court found that that claim\nhad merit.  Although the Court elected not to enter injunctive relief based upon testimony that the\nArkansas Department of Education would ensure that Conway Human Development Center came\ninto compliance with the act, by no means was the claim frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.  In\nfact, it appeared from the evidence that the Arkansas Department of Education initiated its review\n9\n\nof the program at Conway Human Development Center in response to the action brought by the\nplaintiff in this case.  The monitors from the Arkansas Department of Education obtained a copy of\nthe report prepared by the plaintiff’s expert,  Susan Thibadeau, Ph.D., before beginning thei r\ninvestigation at the Center and used that report to guide their investigation.  As the Court found in\nits findings of fact following the trial, the monitors from the Arkansas Department of Education\nconfirmed many, though not all, of Dr. Thibadeau’s criticisms of the Center.  Thus, not only did the\nUnited States meet its burden of proof on the merits of this claim, but the corrective action mandated\nby the Arkansas Department of Education is also a direct result of the work from the United States\nin this action.\nAlthough the Court found that the plaintiff failedto  meet its burden ofp roof on the claim that\nthe Conway Human Development Center violates the integration mandate of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, neither was that claim  frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.  The pl aintiff\ncontended that the Center was not the least restrictive, most integrated setting appropriate for the\ndisabled persons who are served there; that the Cenetr failed to give adequate information to parents\nand guardians about less restrictive alternatives; and that the Center failed to exercise professional\njudgment in making its determinations as to whether the Center was the least restrictive setting for\nits residents.  The greater weight of evidence did not support those contentions, but they were not\nfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.  The plai ntiff’s expert, Antoinette Richardson, and four\nofficers of organizations that provide waiver  services  reviewed forty-six r andomly  selected\nindividual program plans of residents of the Center and concluded that many, if not all of them,\ncould be served through the waiver program.  Furthermore, Calvin Price, the superintendent of the\nCenter, testified that perhaps every individual residing at the Center “could live in the community\n10\n\nif they had the appropriate resources.”  The plaitniff’s evidence was convincing to that point, but the\nplaintiff failed to take the next step and present evidence that aw  aiver provider was the appropriate\nplacement for a specific resident or that a specific rseident would have a greater degree of interaction\nwith nondisabled persons in the waiver program.  That the plaintiff failed to make that showing does\nnot, however, establish that the claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.  The defendants\nhave not proven that the plaintiff could not have made that showing had the next step been taken in\nthe interrogation of witnesses.  Cf. Marquart v. Lodge 837, 26 F.3d 842, 852 (8th Cir. 1994) (“a\nprevailing defendant must prove that a plaintiff’s case is frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.”).\nAs to whether the staff at Conway Human Development Center were providing adequate\ninformation to parents and guardians regarding waiver services, and whether the staff at Conway\nHuman Development Center were exercising professional judgment in deciding whether the Center\nis the least restrictive alternative for its residents, the evidence was in conflict.  The United States\npresented evidence to show that staff members at Conway Human Development Center were not\nadequately informed regarding waiver services in the State of Arkansas and that they were failing\nto exercise professional judgment in making determinations regarding the least restrictive but,\ninstead, were relying simply on the wishes of the parents and guardians of the residents.  Again,\nwhile the Court found that the greaetr weight of the evidence was in favor of the defendants on these\nissues, the claims of the United States were supported by evidence and had some basis.\nIt should be noted that some of the evidence offered in defense of the allegations in Count\nII resulted from changes instituted at Conway Human Development Center shortly before trial.  For\nexample, in the spring of 2010 (some five or six months before trial), Conway Human Development\nCenter for the first time invited all of the waiver providers in the State of Arkansas to the campus\n11\n\nso they could provide information about their services to parents and guardians.  That evidence was\nrelevant and admissible; and it was considered byt he Court in weighing the evidence.  Nevertheless,\nit would seem unfair to consider improvements made by Conway Human Development Center in\nresponse to this litigation and then find that  the allegations by the plaintiff was frivolous,\nunreasonable, or groundless.\nThe more troubling issue relates to Count I, in which the plaintiff alleged that the conditions\nat Conway Human Development Center were so deplorable as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThat claim included a broad based attack on many facets of the Center.  On the merits, it was the\nweakest of the three claims, which, in turn, means that it is the claim that presents the strongest case\nfor an award of attorneys’ fees under the Christiansburg standard.  Having carefully considered the\nevidence, weak though it was, the claim of the United States under the Fourteenth Amendment had\nsome basis, so the Court will not award attorney s’ fees.  The plaintiff presented two qualified\nexperts, Johnny Lee Matson, Ph.D., and Ram asamy Manikam, Ph.D., who testified that the\npsychological services offered at the Center depart substantially from generally accepted standards\nin numerous respects.  See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323, 102 S. Ct. 2452, 2462, 73 L.\nEd. 2d 28 (1982).  The plaintiff also presented the testimony of two highly qualified experts, Jodie\nHolloway, M.D., and Edwin J. Mikkelsen, M.D.., whot estified that the medical services offered by\nConway Human Development Center departed from generally accepted standards in num erous\nrespects.  The Court discussed the relevant evidencea t length in its findings of fact entered after the\ntrial, so that evidence need not be recited here.  Suffice it to say that, while the claim of the United\nStates, as noted, was weak, it was not without some basis.\n12\n\nMoreover, as with Count II, in weighing the evidence the Court considered conditions at\nConway Human Development Center as they werea t the time of trial, which included improvements\nmade at the Center in response to or in preparaotin for this litigation. For example, in response to the\ninvestigation by the Departm ent of Justice, Conway Hum an Development Center engaged a\nconsultant, Kevin Walsh, Ph.D., to assist in improving the Center’s psychology department.  Some\nof the evidence upon which the Court relied in finding for the defendants  included improvements\nin the psychology department instituted at the behest of Dr. Walsh.  As noted in the findings of fact,\nthe use of mechanical restraints at Conway Human Development Center was troubling.  Due at least\nin part to changes made at the Center in response to the Depa rtment of Justice investigation, the\nCenter instituted changes in its practices that resulted in a marked decline in the use of mechanical\nrestraints.  Again, it would be unfair to rely on the evidence that the lives of residents at the Center\nhad improved in response to allegations by the Department of Justice and then find that the claims\nof the Department of Justice were frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\nFor the reasons stated, the Court will not award attorneys’ fees to the defendants.\nIII.\nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, “[u]nelss a federal statute, these rules, or a court\norder provides otherwise, costs—other than attorney’s fees—should be allowed to the prevailing\nparty.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1).  The Eighth Circuit has held that Rule 54(d) codifies a rebuttable\npresumption that the prevailing party is entitled to costs.   Leonard v. Sw. Bell Corp. Disability\nIncome Plan, 408 F.3d 528, 533 (8th Cir. 2005) (citingM  artin v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 251 F.3d\n691, 696 (8th Cir. 2001)).  The costs available under the rule are stated in 28 U.S.C. § 1920:\nA judge or clerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the following:\n13\n\n(1) Fees of the clerk and marshal;\n(2) Fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for\nuse in the case;\n(3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses;\n(4) Fees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any materials where\nthe copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case;\n(5) Docket fees under section 1923 of this title;\n(6) Compensations of court appointed experts, com pensation of interpreters, and\nsalaries, fees, expenses, and costs of s pecial interpretation services under section\n1828 of this title.\nA bill of costs shall be f iled in the case and, upon allowance, included in the\njudgment or decree.\n28 U.S.C. § 1920 (2006), amended by Pub. L. No. 110-406, § 6, 122 Stat. 4291, 4292 (2008).  Not\nall expenses of litigation are costs taxable against the losing party, and within the statutory\nframework of costs eligible to be taxed, the distrcit court has discretion in determining and awarding\ncosts in a given case.  Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437, 441-42, 107 S. Ct.\n2494, 2497, 96 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1987);P  ershern v. Fiatallis N. Am., Inc., 834 F.2d 136, 140 (8th Cir.\n1987).  The district courts may not tax costs beyond those expressly authorized in section 1920. \nCrawford, 482 U.S. at 445, 107 S. Ct. at 2499.  “Section 1920 im poses ‘rigid controls on cost-\nshifting in federal courts . . . .’”  Brisco-Wade v. Carnahan, 297 F.3d 781, 782 (8th Cir. 2002) (per\ncuriam) (citing Crawford, 482 U.S. at 444, 107 S. Ct. at 2499).\nThe parties have no material dispute regarding the amount of costs taxable under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1920.  The defendants calculated the taxable costs as $149,545.01, whereas, accordi ng to the\nplaintiff’s tally, the recoverable costs come to $150,585.01.  The difference of $1,040 related to the\ncosts for service of process, which, upon reflection, the defendants concede are properly taxable as\ncosts.  Thus, there is no dispute that the taxable costs come to $150,585.01. \n14\n\nThe plaintiff contends that the defendants are not entitled to any costs, however, f or two\nreasons.  First, the plaintiff contends that it prevailed on Count III, which was the count that alleged\nviolations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  The plaintiff therefore argues that the\nCourt should decline to award costs inasmuch as both parties prevailed on some aspect of the claims. \nThat argument fails.  The Supreme Court has held that to be a prevailing party, “the plaintiff must\nbe able to point to a resolution of the dispute wihch changes the legal relationship between itsel fand\nthe defendant.”  Tex. State Teachers’ Ass’n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 792, 109 S.\nCt. 1486, 1493, 103 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1989).  “The touchsotne of the prevailing party inquiry must be\nthe material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties[.]”  Id. at 792-93, 109 S. Ct. at 1494. \n“Therefore, to qualify as a prevailing party, a civirl ights plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on\nthe merits of his claim.”  Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111, 113 S. Ct. 566, 573, 121 L. Ed. 2d 494\n(1992).  Moreover, “the change in the relationship must be ‘judicially sanctioned’[.]”  Sierra Club\nv. City of Little Rock, 351 F.3d 840, 845 (8th Cir. 2003).  By this test, the plaintiff did not prevail\non any count because the plaintiff obtained no judciially sanctioned relief.  Although the Court may\nhave discretion to deny an award of costs or reduce an award of costs for a party that prevailed on\nonly a portion of the claims, here, the Court does not believe that it would be appropriate to reduce\ncosts awarded to the defendants pursuant to section 1920.\nSecond, the plaintiff contends that the declaration s ubmitted by defense counsel did not\ncomply with 28 U.S.C. § 1924 (2006), inasmuch as it did not expressly say that each cost “is correct\nand has been necessarily incurred in the case and taht the services for which fees were charged were\nactually and necessarily performed.”  The plaintif f is correct that the declaration subm itted by\ndefense counsel does not use the precise language required by section 1924.  Defense counsel did,\n15\n\nas noted, submit a declaration in support of the  motion for attorneys’ fees and costs; and the\ndefendants filed with the declaration appendices in which costs are itemized in detail, along with\nattachments that include each invoice for each expenditure sought to be recovered as a taxable cost. \nThe supporting documentation is sufficiently detailed that the plaintiff could not only verify the\namount of costs taxable under section 1920 but, asn oted above, find an additional $1,040 in taxable\ncosts that the defendants had overlooked.\nIn their reply, the defendants cite The Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Dynamic Dev. Grp., LLC, 336\nF. Supp. 2d 552 (M.D.N.C. 2004), wheer the court noted that sectoin 1924 only requires an affidavit\n“before any bill of costs is taxed.” I d. at 572 (quoting Piraino v. Int’l Orientation Res., No. 94C493,\n1997 WL 222948, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 30, 1997)).  Thec ourt therefore granted the prevailing party\nleave to amend the bill of costs by supplying an fafidavit that complied with section 1924.  Adopting\nthe reasoning from those decisions, without deciding whether the declaration already submitted by\ndefense counsel is insufficient, the Court grants the defendants leave to amend the bill of costs within\nseven days from the entry of this Opinion and Order by filing an affidavit that uses the precise\nlanguage of 28 U.S.C. § 1924.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated, the defendants’ motion for award of attorneys’ fees and costs is\nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.   Documents #232 and #238.  The motion for an\naward of attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses is denied.  The defendants are given leave to amend\ntheir motion for an award of costs by subm itting an affidavit that uses the precise language of\n16\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1924 within seven days from the entry of this Opinion and Order4.  If the defendants file\nsuch an affidavit within seven days from the entry of this Opinion and Order, the Court will enter\nan award of costs pursuant to Rule 54(d) of th e Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1920 in the amount of $150,585.00.\nIT IS SO ORDERED this 6th day of February, 2012.\n                                                                      \nJ.

      "text": "Case 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 1 of 57\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS \nWESTERN DIVISION \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \nPlaintiffs, \nv.  Case No. 4:09CV00033 WRW \nSTATE OF ARKANSAS, et aI., \nDefendants. \n----------------------~/ \nBRIEF IN SUPPORT OF \"DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO STRIKE \nPLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OR, IN THE \nALTERNATIVE, DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR AN ENLARGEMENT OF \nTIME TO RESPOND TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION\" \nAND \nDEFENDANTS INITIAL RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nThe Defendants file this brief in support of \"Defendants' Motion To Strike Plaintiffs \nMotion For Preliminary Injunction Or, In The Alternative, Defendants' Motion for an \nEnlargement Of Time To Respond To Plaintiffs' Motion For Preliminary Injunction\" \n(hereinafter referred to as \"Defendants' Motion\").  Since the Court has not yet had an \nopportunity to rule on Defendants' Motion, and since a response to Plaintiffs Motion For \nPreliminary Injunction (hereinafter referred to as \"Plaintiff s Motion\") is due without a favorable \nruling on Defendants' Motion, the Defendants also include herein an initial response to \nPlaintiff s Motion. \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 2 of 57\nI.  THE COURT SHOULD STRIKE THE BELATED AND INAPPROPRIATE \nPLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nPlaintiffs Motion For Preliminary Injunction is a transparent attempt to disrupt \nDefendants trial preparation, to present allegations without opportunity for a fair rebuttal, and to \nobtain relief that it would not otherwise receive in a full and fair trial on the merits.  In an \nattempt by Plaintiff to avoid the reliable and compelling opinions of the Defendants' experts \nwhose reports are forthcoming in a few weeks (they are due on April 27, 2010 in accordance \nwith the parties' discovery plan), and to possibly even distract or disrupt the preparation of those \nreports in the very limited time allowed by the schedule negotiated by the parties, the Plaintiff \nhas chosen to try to ambush the Defendants before their defense can be completed.  The \nevidence,however, reveals the lack of urgency and the lack of merit to this request for \npreliminary injunction, and, therefore, the lack of justification for filing this Motion at this \ncrucial time in preparation of the defense. \nA.  THE CONWAY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT CENTER IS FULLY \nREGULATED AND ACCREDITED WHICH CONTRADICTS ANY \nCLAIM OF URGENCY OR IRREPARABLE HARM \nThe Plaintiff does not license or regulate the operation of Conway Human Development \nCenter (\"CHDC\") or any other Intermediate Care Facilities for People with Mental Retardation \n(\"ICF/MR\").  The federal agency responsible for licensing and regulating CHDC, and \napproximately 7,500 other ICF/MR facilities, is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(\"CMS\").  The ICF/MR Program was established in 1971, when legislation was enacted that \nprovided for federal financial participation (FFP) for ICF/MRs as an optional Medicaid service. \nTo qualify for Medicaid reimbursement, ICF/MRs must be certified by CMS and comply with \nstringent federal standards in eight areas, including: management, client protections, facility \nstaffing, active treatment services, client behavior and facility practices, health care services, \n2 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 3 of 57\nphysical environment, and dietetic services.  42 CFR Part 483, Subpart I, Sections 483.400-\n483 .480 (emphasis added). \nCHDC always has been certified by CMS and there has never been a period when \nCHDC's certification has lapsed.l  CHDC is also accredited by the Commission on Accreditation \nof Rehabilitation Facilities (\"CARP\"). 2  CHDC has been accredited by CARP since 1998. \nCARP conducted its most recent survey ofCHDC from December 7, 2009 to December 9, 2009, \nwhich was more recently than any of the Plaintiffs consultants visited CHDC.  In January 2010, \nCARP granted CHDC another three year accreditation, through January 2013.3  Defendants \nExhibit A.  CARP did not raise any of the alleged concerns addressed by the Plaintiff s Motion. \nThe fully accredited status of CHDC clearly belies any claim of harm or urgency in \nPlaintiffs Motion. \nB.  THE SIGNIFICANT DELAY OF THE PLAINTIFF IN SEEKING A \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION BELIES ANY CLAIM OF \nIRREPARABLE HARM \nThe Plaintiff opened its investigation in 2002.  The Plaintiff had more than six (6) years \nto review in great detail all of the services provided at Conway Human Development Center \n(\"CHDC\").  Before filing suit in January of2009, the Plaintiff used multiple experts to conduct \ntours and reviewed thousands of documents.  The Plaintiff had the full cooperation of the State \nof Arkansas and had reasonable access to all records and personnel. \n1  Plaintiff even relies on the standards set forth by CMS to make its claims.  Plaintiffs Memorandum at 37-38, 41-\n42.  CMS is specifically tasked with regulating rCF/MRs and is obviously in a much better position to conduct \nsurveys and determine whether professional standards are being met than the Plaintiff.  To make its claims, \nhowever, Plaintiff ignores the conclusions reached by CMS, that CHDC is meeting all standards, including \nprofessional judgment standards, and has decided to do its own review of CHDC and apply different requirements. \n2 \"CARF is a well-respected, international, independent, nonprofit accreditor of human service providers and \nnetworks in the areas of aging services, behavioral health, child and youth services, employment and community \nservices, and medical rehabilitation.\" www.carf.org/providers.aspx?content=contentiaboutitoc.htm \n3 A three-year accreditation is awarded to programs providing the highest quality of services under the CARF \nstandards.  CHDC has been awarded three year accreditations by CARF every three years since 1998. \n3 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 4 of 57\nWhen the Plaintiff issued its \"findings letter\" on April 21, 2004, it specifically alleged \nissues as to \"significant harm or risk of harm from shortcomings in the facilities' health care, \nhabilitative treatment services, restraint practices, and protection from harm policies.\" The \nPlaintiff also alleged \"that the State does not provide services to individuals with disabilities in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to individual residents' needs.\"  The Plaintiff noted that \nCHDC housed residents \"aged 11 to 66\".  Relevant to the present inquiry, the Plaintiff alleged: \n(a)  \"Conway's psychotropic medication management \nsubstantially departs from generally accepted professional \nstandards.\"  Plaintiffs exhibit 1 at 25 . \n. (b)  \"Conway's use of restraints substantially departs from \naccepted professional standards of care and exposes residents to \nexcessive and unnecessary restrictive interventions.\" Plaintiff s \nexhibit 1 at 27. \n(c)  \"Conway fails to provide basic oversight of resident care \nand treatment that is critical to ensuring the reasonable safety of its \nresidents.\"  Plaintiffs exhibit 1 at 30. \n(d)  \"Conway's provision of special education services does not \ncomport with federal law because it fails to provide individualized \neducational programs that are reasonably calculated to enable \nstudents to receive an appropriate education.\"  Plaintiffs exhibit 1 \nat 35.  \"Federal law and regulations require that, to the maximum \nextent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in \ninstitutions at Conway, receive educational services in the least \nrestrictive setting.\"  Plaintiffs exhibit 1 at 40.  \" ... these students \ndid not experience school in an appropriate setting with \nappropriate instructional materials.\" Plaintiff s exhibit 1 at 41. \n(e)  \"Arkansas is failing to serve some residents of Conway in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their individualized \nneeds.\"  Plaintiffs exhibit 1 at 41. \nDespite these alleged findings, the Plaintiff did not file a lawsuit or seek a preliminary injunction \n4 \nin 2004 or in any of the next five (5) years. Apparently, no irreparable harm was occurring \nduring the period of 2002 to 2009, during which time the DO] voiced the same concerns as they \ncurrently are voicing in their preliminary injunction motion. \n4  To clarity, the Defendants seriously dispute the DOl's allegations of unconstitutional or unlawful conditions.  But \nif the DOJ seriously believed their allegations to be true, those conditions (by the DOJ's own admission) have been \nin place for many years. \n4 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 5 of 57\nOn June 20, 2008, a DOJ consultant, Ramasamy Manikam, Ph.D., submitted to the DOJ a \nwritten report based on a June 19 to June 21, 2007, site visit to CHDC, which included the \nreading of case records and reports, and interviews with professional and direct care staff.  In \nManikam's 2008 report, Manikam cited issues of restraint usage at CHDC, as well as issues \nregarding services for children and young adults.  With respect to restraint, Manikam alleged: \na.  \"[T]he behavioral and psychopharmacological treatments \nfor the residents at CHDC are not very effective and staff has to \nresort to emergency use of restraints to keep residents' behavior \nunder control. .. \" \nb.  \"[T]he Papoose board has become an instrument of threat \nand punishment with some staff. .. [it] was used when situations \ndid not warrant it ... \"; \nc.  \"[O]n some occasions, staff actions or inactions injure \nresidents when they are placed in restraints ...\" ; \nd.  \"[I]n other cases, residents were placed in available \npositions and exposed to attack by other residents ...\" ; \ne.  \"[A]n important area of programming, neglected at CHDC, \nis the integrating of the resident to the milieu subjecting the \nresident to restrictive procedures .. \"; and \nf.  \"[T]he sum of my reviews, interviews, and observations at \nCHDC, suggest that the inefficient psychological assessments and \nineffective psychological interventions contribute to the number of \nrestraints and overreliance on reactive behavioral procedures used \nin its residents.\" \nManikam, June 20, 2008, Consultant's Report on Site Visit, Conway Developmental Health \nCenter, Conway, Arkansas at 13-15,22.  With respect to services for children and young adults, \nManikam alleged: \"CHDC cannot be considered to be the Least Restrictive Environment for a \nnumber of students (for example, MC and SH).\" Manikam, June 20, 2008, at 19.  Manikam \nmade recommendations to debrief residents (where appropriate) and staff \"involved in \naddressing incidents/accidents/restraints etc\" and to make a \"primary\" goal to \"eliminate/reduce \nrestraints.\"  Manikam, June 20, 2008, at 23,24. Thus, the DOJ knew of alleged issues as to \nrestraint and least restrictive environment for school age children, similar to those raised in this \n5 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 6 of 57\nMotion for Preliminary Injunction, since at least June of2008.5  Yet, the Plaintiff did not seek an \ninjunction in June 2008, or any reasonable time thereafter, after learning of these issues. \nThe Plaintiff filed the present lawsuit in January of 2009.  The Plaintiff chose not to seek \na preliminary injunction at that time. \nFollowing the filing of the present lawsuit, tours ofCHDC by Plaintiffs experts spanned \nfour (4) weeks from July 2009 through September 2009.  Most of Plaintiffs touring experts \nspent nine (9) days at CHDC and sometimes as many as seven (7) experts were onsite at the \nsame time.  Plaintiff s counsel was present for all of these tours and had unlimited opportunity to \ncommunicate with these experts.  Plaintiffs counsel and experts requested thousands of pages of \ndocuments.  CHDC staff produced may documents the same day or within a few days.  The \ndisruption, burden, and stress to the staff at CHDC was tremendous. \nThe Plaintiffs counsel had the opportunity to observe, and to discuss with Plaintiffs \nexperts, the children living at CHDC and the services provided to those children.  The Plaintiff, \nhowever, chose not to seek a preliminary injunction in September of 2009 at the conclusion of its \nexperts tours, or at any reasonable time thereafter.  Apparently, there was no irreparable harm to \nthe residents at CHDC at that time. \nLate in September 2009, during the last week of tours by its experts, the Plaintiff sought \nDefendants' agreement to extend the trial date and to extend the time to which the parties had \nagreed for Plaintiffs to complete its expert reports.  Absolutely no mention was made of any need \nfor immediate relief or for a preliminary injunction.  The Plaintiff, instead, chose to seek even \nmore time than originally agreed to complete its expert reports, which further contradicts any \n5  Please note, despite the alleged urgency, the report ofManikam was not provided to the Defendants until \nDecember of2009, shortly before the Complaint was filed.  Apparently, there was no urgency in revealing the \nfindings ofManikam. \n6 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 7 of 57\nclaimed urgency to have this matter heard.6  As a result of this extension oftime, and due to the \nunderstandable limited availability ofthe Honorable J. Leon Holmes, Chief Judge, the case was \ndelayed from April of 2010 to September 2010, a delay of approximately five (5) months.  The \nPlaintiff requested the delay of this allegedly \"urgent\" case so that its experts could have the \nadditional months to complete their reports, but now seeks to deny the Defendants their agreed to \n·period of time to complete their expert reports. \nOn December 23,2009, the Plaintiffs experts completed their reports which are cited \nextensively in Plaintiffs Motion and which form the alleged basis for a preliminary injunction.7 \nHowever, despite the alleged urgency in Plaintiffs Motion, no preliminary injunction was sought \nby the Plaintiff until over two (2) months later.  Even if the Plaintiff claims it needed over two \n(2) months to complete its Motion, the Defendants should receive at least a similar period to \nprepare a response.  If the matter was not so urgent as to allow the Plaintiff to casually complete \nits Motion, then Defendants should receive a fair period to respond to this voluminous Motion. \nOn February 15,2010, the Defendants timely disclosed their experts' identity as required \nby the agreement ofthe parties.  The Defendants' experts only have until March 25,2010, to \ncomplete any visits to CHDC, and only until Apri127, 2010, to complete their reports. At this \ncrucial time, Defendants' experts must be able to focus on their expert reports and must have full \naccess to the staff at CHDC and to Defendants' legal counsel.  Not coincidently, the Plaintiff \nfiled its Motion on March 9 in the middle of the very crucial period for Defendants' experts, and \n6  At a minimum, this demonstrates the unfairness of Plaintiff's position in taking the full opportunity of the time \navailable to complete its expert reports, but now seeking to disrupt the completion of the reports of Defendants' \nexperts. \n7  The Plaintiff now seeks to file declarations of their experts that expand upon or alter the opinions in their reports \nwhich is a violation of the Scheduling Order.  The reports of Plaintiff's experts were due December 23,2009, and all \nefforts to belatedly supplement their reports should be denied.  Defendants also reserve the right to move to exclude \nall or portions ofthe Plaintiff's consultants' declarations and reports as well as the testimony of any or all of \nPlaintiff's consultants pursuant to Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786 \n(1993) and the Court's Amended Scheduling Order. \n7 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 8 of 57\nDefendants' Counsel, to complete their expert reports.  Responding to a motion for preliminary \ninjunction at this inappropriate and unfair time will be highly prejudicial to the Defendants. \nThe suspect timing of Plaintiff's Motion is made apparent by Plaintiff's allegations in this \nMotion.  The Plaintiff has had all ofthe information that forms the basis for its allegations since \nat least December 2009, and in many regards much sooner.  The Plaintiff was given detailed \ninformation through their initial investigation in 2003, and many of the instances that the \nPlaintiff cites were evident during their initial investigation.  The same is true of the DOl's \nreturn visit in June of 2007.  All of the information relied on by Plaintiff in its Motion has been \navailable to Plaintiff for months and, in many instances, years.  If Plaintiff believed a preliminary \ninjunction was warranted on the basis of these facts, then it would have been negligent or derelict \nin protecting the residents at CHDC to delay its request until March of this year. \nThe Plaintiff has not alleged any new facts that would justify the tremendous burden that \nwould be put on the Defendants to respond to Plaintiff's Motion and simultaneously complete \nexpert reports and prepare for trial.  Plaintiff has taken full advantage of the discovery schedule \nto prepare its case, including expanded time for its consultants' reports, and now seeks to \nambush the Defendants.  Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction is a transparent attempt to \nsabotage the Defendants' preparation of their case.  The timing of Plaintiff's Motion is otherwise \ninexplicable. \nPlaintiff's delay in seeking a Preliminary Injunction \"belies any claim of irreparable \ninjury pending trial.\"  Hubbard Feeds v. Animal Feed Supplement, 182 F.3d 598 (8th Cir. 1999); \nSee also Tough Traveler, Ltd. v. Outbound Products, 60 F.3d 964, 968 (2d Cir. 1995) (Plaintiff's \ndelay \"undercuts the sense of urgency that ordinarily accompanies a motion for preliminary \nrelief and suggests that there is, in fact, no irreparable injury.\" Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 \n8 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 9 of 57\nF.3d 891,903 (7th Cir. 2001) (\"Delay in pursuing a preliminary injunction may raise questions \nregarding the plaintiff s claim that he or she will face irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction \nis not entered.\"); Palm Beach County Environmental. Coalition v. Florida, 587 F. Supp. 2d. \n1254, 1257 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (stating that delay in both seeking injunctive relief when the \nsubstantial issues were known to the plaintiffs and failure to timely serve defendants \"belie[] \nplaintiffs' argument that there will be immediate injury absent injunctive relief'); Golden Bear \nInt'!, Inc. v. Bear U.S.A., Inc., 969 F. Supp. 742, 748 (N.D. Ga. 1996) (Camp, J.) (\"Preliminary \ninjunctions are issued to prevent imminent and inevitable injury to the movant, and undue delay \n'speaks volumes about whether a plaintiff is being irreparably injured.\"') (citation omitted). \nClearly, there is no reasonable allegation of irreparable harm as evidenced by the \nPlaintiffs lack of urgency in bringing this Motion. \nC.  THE PLAINTIFF UNFAIRLY SEEKS TO DEPRIVE THE DEFENDANTS \nOF THE BENEFIT OF THEIR NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT \nALLOWING REBUTTAL OF THE PLAINTIFF'S CONSULTANTS \nIn the Spring of2009, the parties negotiated, with some difficulty and disagreement, a \ndiscovery schedule that would fit into the time frame suggested by the Court. The Court had set a \ntrial date in April of 20 10, so the parties unequally divided the available time. The State was not \npleased with the limited time it received in the negotiations, but accepted the due dates in \nexchange for other aspects of the negotiated schedule.  For example, the State placed great \nweight in and relied heavily on the fact that the Plaintiff would designate its experts early on in \nthe process (July 1,2009) and would submit its reports first (October 21,2009) which would \nallow the State sufficient time to plan its expert strategy, to locate experts, to retain experts, and \nto have its experts available and able to complete their reports in the very short time allowed. \nThe State accepted a very limited time for completing its expert reports, and significantly less \n9 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 10 of 57\ntime than provided to Plaintiffs experts, because the schedule allowed them the benefit of being \nable to respond fairly and fully to the issues to be revealed by Plaintiff s experts. \nIn complete disregard of its obligations under the negotiated agreement, the Plaintiff now \nseeks a ruling from the Court before the Defendants have been provided the negotiated period to \nrespond.  The Plaintiff seeks to ambush the Defendants before they receive the full benefit of \ntheir agreed upon schedule for rebuttal. \nThe State was focused upon the extremely important comparison of the time allowed to \nPlaintiffs experts to complete their reviews and reports versus the time allowed to the State's \nexperts to complete their reviews and reports. Because the State's experts must review everything \nreviewed by the Plaintiffs experts, and must usually review even more information than \nPlaintiffs experts to place the issues in proper context and to cover information often overlooked \nby Plaintiffs experts, the State's experts should receive as much time, if not more, than Plaintiffs \nexperts.  Under the original agreement on the schedule, the following was the allotment of the \nlimited time available: \nPlaintiffs expert -NINE (9) MONTHS, from filing of Complaint \nto the due date of their expert report. \nState's experts - THREE (3) MONTHS from receipt of Plaintiffs \nexperts' reports to the due date of their reports. \nThis discrepancy was tolerable only because the Plaintiff was required to present the opinions of \ntheir experts first and to thereby allow the Defendants to have a full and fair opportunity to \nrespond thereto before any trial or decision on the merits.  If there had been no promise to allow \na full and fair response, there would have been no agreement to allow the Plaintiff to conduct \ndiscovery and to complete expert reports. \n10 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 11 of 57\nAfter two (2) negotiated extensions of time, both requested by the Plaintiff and both \nresulting in more time being given to the Plaintiffs experts than to the State's experts, the early \npromise to allow rebuttal by Defendants remained crucial and perhaps became even more \nimportant.  The new allotment of time became: \nPlaintiffs experts - ELEVEN (11) MONTHS from filing the \nComplaint to the due date of their reports. \nState's experts - FOUR (4) MONTHS from receipt of the \nPlaintiffs experts' reports to the due date oftheir reports. \nThis discrepancy continued to be tolerable only if the Plaintiff honored its commitment to allow \na full and fair opportunity to Defendants to complete their discovery, their expert reviews, and \ntheir expert reports. \nThe relevant consideration is the unfair comparative advantage in time that Plaintiffs \nexperts have over the State's experts. The State is clearly and undeniably prejudiced if it is \ndenied its negotiated benefit of a full and fair opportunity to rebut the allegations of Plaintiffs \nexperts.  The State was willing to live with this unequal allotment of time ifi t had the benefit of \nearly disclosure of expert opinions and a reasonable period for rebuttal, but it is not willing to \naccept this schedule if it is denied the benefit of their negotiation. \nThe State will be comparatively harmed by the loss of the benefit of the bargain as to the \nagreed upon schedule.  Although this prejudice is hard to quantify or demonstrate, it is obvious \nthat the State's experts will have less time to complete their reports if the Defendants are \ndistracted by a response to the Plaintiff s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  The prejudice to \nthe State will result in less effective and less thorough rebuttal reports than would have been \nobtained if the negotiated schedule had been honored.  The Plaintiff should be forced to \ndemonstrate respect for the schedule it negotiated and the State should receive the full benefit of \n11 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 12 of 57\nthe schedule it negotiated.  When one considers the comparative time allowed to both the \nPlaintiff's experts and the State's experts, the State is prejudiced by the Plaintiff's delayed filing \nof its Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  Changes to that schedule now will severely harm the \ndefense and will result in a need to set a longer schedule that may delay the September 2010 trial \ndate.  The delay is not acceptable to the State. \nThe Plaintiff has not honored the agreement of counsel.  The Plaintiff should be bound by \nits agreement and denied any belated request for preliminary injunction.  The Court should not \nreward the manipulations by the Plaintiff to obtain a ruling on a preliminary injunction especially \nwhere there is no demonstrated urgency. \nThe State will be severely prejudiced by the belated filing of a motion for preliminary \ninjunction as it disrupts its well-planned and efficient defense.  The defense of the State will be \nsignificantly compromised by the need to divert the attention of its administrators, employees, \nexperts, and attorneys to responding to the request for preliminary injunction rather than \ncompleting their important expert reports and otherwise preparing for trial, which is set for \nSeptember of2010.8  This trial date was set following an October 21, 2009 telephone conference \nbetween this Court and the parties.  Although Plaintiff s experts already had finished their tours \nof the Center as of this conference date, Plaintiff stated no objection to a trial date sometime in \nthe Fall of 20 1O . \nTo the limited extent the Defendants can prepare a response to the request for preliminary \ninjunction in such a short time allowed, after the Plaintiff took months or years to prepare its \nMotion, the Defendants should not be forced to rush their experts' opinions or to divulge those \n8  In fact, the Plaintiff has now served their Eighth Request for Production of Documents that seeks an extensive \nnumber of documents (eighty numbered paragraphs of requested documents and subparts) which further interferes \nwith the preparation of Defendants' case.  The Plaintiff has also noticed the depositions of twenty (20) more state \nofficials/employees for the weeks of April 19 and April 26 which also interferes with the completion of Defendants' \nexpert reports. \n12 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 13 of 57\nopinions before the agreed upon deadline of April 27, 2010.  The Plaintiffs experts did not have \nto divulge their thoughts or initial findings before their reports were due on December 23,2009. \nMagistrate Judge Jones recognized the importance of the mutually-negotiated deadlines \nset forth in the Amended Scheduling Order in his December 7, 2009 Order denying Plaintiff s \nrequest to add additional experts beyond these deadlines provided in the Amended Scheduling \nOrder.  Judge Jones noted, that the deadline in the Amended Scheduling Order \"was more than a \ncourtesy, it was a negotiated deadline relied upon by the Defendants.\" December 7,2009 Order \nat 7.  Similarly, Defendants have relied upon the due date for their experts' reports. \nThe Plaintiff seeks to avoid its agreement that Defendants need not complete their expert \nreports until April 27, 2010.  The Plaintiff seeks to disrupt or interfere with the completion of \nthese reports in the very limited time allowed by agreement of the parties. \nD.  THE PLAINTIFF CANNOT PREVAIL ON ITS CLAIMS IF THE \nDEFENDANTS ARE GIVEN FULL AND FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO \nCOMPLETE THEIR DISCOVERY AND EXPERT REPORTS \nIn Youngberg, the U.S. Supreme Court cautioned that \"interference by the federal \njudiciary with the internal operations of these institutions should be minimized.\" Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307,322 (1982).  Where a Plaintiff seeks to enjoin a government agency, the \nparties and the Court must respect the \"well-established rule\" that the government is granted the \n\"widest latitude\" in the dispatch of its affairs. Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362,378-79 (1976). \n\"Federal courts operate according to institutional rules and procedures that are poorly suited to \nthe management of state agencies.\" Angela R. v. Clinton, 999 F.2d 320,326 (8th Cir. 1993). \nAccordingly, courts \"should refrain from micromanaging the state and its agencies.\" United \nStates v. Missouri, 535 F.3d. 844,851 (8th Cir. 2008). \n13 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 14 of 57\nThe type of preliminary injunction that Plaintiff seeks in this motion - a preliminary \ninjunction that (l) disturbs the status quo, (2) is mandatory as opposed to prohibitory,9 and (3) \naffords Plaintiff substantially all of the relief it seeks to recover at the conclusion of a full trial on \nthe merits - is disfavored and requires Plaintiff to show that four factors weigh heavily and \ncompellingly in its favor. \nA preliminary injunction that alters the status quo goes beyond the \ntraditional purpose for preliminary injunctions, which is only to preserve \nthe status quo until a trial on the merits may be had ....  Mandatory \ninjunctions are more burdensome than prohibitory injunctions because \nthey affirmatively require the nonmovant to act in a particular way, and as \na result they place the issuing court in a position where it may have to \nprovide ongoing supervision to assure that the nonmovant is abiding by \nthe injunction....  Finally, a preliminary injunction that awards the movant \nsubstantially all the relief he may be entitled to if he succeeds on the \nmerits is similar to the \"Sentence first-Verdict Afterwards\" type of \nprocedure parodied in Alice in Wonderland, which is an anathema to our \nsystem ofj urisprudence. \nSCFC ILC, Inc. v. VISA USA, Inc., 936 F.2d 1096, 1098-99 (lOth Cir. 1991); See also \nAnderson v. United States, 612 F.2d 1112, 1114 (9th Cir. 1979) (noting that because a \npreliminary injunction that alters the status quo is \"particularly disfavored\" the movant must \nmake a strong showing of entitlement); Harris v. Wilters, 596 F.2d 678,680 (5th Cir. 1979) \n(\"Only in rare instances is the issuance of a mandatory preliminary injunction proper.\"). \nPlaintiff seeks a mandatory injunction granting much of the relief sought in its Complaint \nwithout providing Defendants the full benefit of discovery, expert rebuttal, or a trial on the \nmerits.  Plaintiffs Motion seeks to preemptively adjudicate this matter by depriving Defendants \nof their due process.  Plaintiffs Motion does not allege facts that weigh heavily or compellingly \nin its favor.  Plaintiff has merely relayed its consultants' opinions in a motion that only serves to \n9 Mandatory injunctions compel action, while prohibitory injunctions forbid action. Meghrig v. KFC W., Inc., 516 \nU.S. 479,484 (1996) (stating that a mandatory injunction orders a party to \"take action\" and a prohibitory injunction \n\"restrains\" a party from further action). \n14 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 15 of 57\ndisrupt Defendants' preparation for trial.  As discussed below, many or all of those consultants' \nopinions will be proven false. \nAlthough Defendants' experts are deeply immersed in conducting their review of CHDC, \nthey have reported verbally numerous misrepresentations and errors made by Plaintiffs experts. \nThe Defendants' experts have verbally advised that the information digested to date does not \nsupport the conclusions reached by Plaintiffs experts.  Given a full and fair opportunity to \ncomplete these reviews, the Defendants are reasonably optimistic that the reports of Plaintiff s \nexperts will be fully and convincingly discredited at trial.  The Plaintiff has made many factual \nmisrepresentations and a response to all of those misrepresentations will require Defendants to \ndedicate substantial resources away from its report preparation and trial preparation. \nAs an example of the type of misrepresentations and the type of response that Defendants \nwould be required to prepare, the Plaintiff inaccurately claims that \nCHDC residents die at the strikingly young age of 46.5 years. \nExhibit 7 (Declaration of Edwin Mikkelson) at 8.  According to \ncomparative studies, 72 years of age is the approximate normal life \nspan for individuals with developmental disabilities who live in an \ninstitution, a quarter of a century longer than residents of CHDC. \nId. \nPlaintiffs Memorandum of Points and Authorities at 5. 10 This allegation is unsupported by the \ndata and is outrageously false.  It was obviously intended to create sensational newspaper \nheadlines and to bias the Court, but it is baseless. \nPlaintiffs citation is to its consultant, Dr. Edwin Mikkelsen's declaration, which is \nattached Plaintiffs Memorandum.  Dr. Mikkelsen is a psychiatrist.  His declaration states: \nAfter reviewing summaries of mortalities that occurred at CHDC \nover a two-year period, I calculated the average age of death for \nCHDC residents to be 46.4 years.  According to comparative \n10  The Defendants object to having to reveal any oftheir experts' opinions prior to the date agreed upon by the \nPlaintiff.  However, Defendants want to demonstrate the frivolous nature of Plaintiffs Motion. \n15 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 16 of 57\nstudies, rates of approximately 72 years of age are the normal life \nspan for individuals with developmental disabilities who live in an \ninstitution, a quarter of a century longer than residents of CHDC. \nPlaintiff s Memorandum of Points and Authorities, Exhibit 7 at 8. I I Dr. Mikkelsen's declaration \nappears to be based in part upon a section of his report, which was also attached to Plaintiffs \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities as Exhibit 7.A.1.  Dr. Mikkelsen's report states, in part, \nTwo states (CT and MA) publish Mortality Reviews that are \navailable to the public, and which provide sufficient detail to make \ndirect comparisons with the CHDC data that I have compiled.  I \nalso have enough direct experience with the state-operated \nfacilities in CT and MA to determine that the physical and \nintellectual characteristics of the residents in these facilities are \ncomparable to the population that resides at the CHDC.  These \nstates also, specifically, report on the average age of death of those \nindividuals who reside in their facilities, separate from the \npopulation that reside in other residential settings. \nThe average age of death of individuals who reside in the large \nresidential facilities in MA is 71.7 years.  CT continues to operate \none large state residential facility, which is the Southbury Training \nSchool.  This facility is larger than those in MA and has a census \nof over 500 individuals, which is comparable to the CHDC \npopulation.  The average age of death at this large state-operated \nfacility is 72.8 years.  Thus, the residents of these state-operated \nfacilities enjoy life spans that are approximately 25 years longer \nthan those 0 f the CHDC residents. \nPlaintiffs Memorandum of Points and Authorities, Exhibit 7.A.l at Ch.2, p. 8.  The two \ndocuments cited by Dr. Mikkelsen are attached as Defendants' Exhibits B and C.  The \nconclusions of Dr. Mikkelsen are seriously flawed. \nDr. Mikkelsen admitted during his deposition that he did not have data regarding the age \nof the residents of the Southbury Training School or Massachusetts facilities. Exhibit F at 218. \nWithout knowing the distribution of the ages of the residents, this type of analysis has no value. \nObviously, a facility with an older population would have an older average age of death than a \n11  The Defendants object to this belated attempt to supplement his expert report beyond the agreed upon deadline. \n16 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 17 of 57\nfacility with a younger population.12  Furthermore, CHDC has an extremely high concentration \nof persons who are medically fragile which is not accounted for in any calculation by Dr. \nMikkelsen.  The conclusions by Dr. Mikkelsen are not statistically or scientifically sound. \nDefendants engaged a nationally-recognized expert to specifically respond to this and \nother allegations.  A draft section ofthe report of this Defendants' expert is attached as \nDefendants' Exhibit D.  As described by that expert, based on Dr. Mikkelsen's flawed reasoning, \nwhich Plaintiff has inappropriately endorsed and incorrectly represented to the Court as a \nscientific fact, the most dangerous place for an individual with developmental disabilities to live \nin Connecticut or Massachusetts is in their own horne. Exhibit D at 9.  It is unlikely that Dr. \nMikkelsen would agree with this reasonable interpretation of his flawed analysis as he is a \nstaunch opponent of institutional settings.  Actually, when a statistically valid analysis of Dr. \nMikkelsen's data is done, it becomes dear - CHDC has lower mortality rates than the \n\"comparable\" facilities identified by Dr. Mikkelsen.  Exhibit D at 13.  The Plaintiff has \ndisgracefully and falsely criticized the services at CHDC. \nPlaintiff's Motion is replete with this type of misleading information.  As another \nexample,  Plaintiff misleadingly alleges that \"CHDC utilizes 41 different forms of mechanical \nrestraint, including straitjackets, 'restraint chairs,' and 'papoose boards.' Exhibit 26 at 4; Exhibit \n27 at 4.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities at 14.  Plaintiff, and its consultant, \nDr. Matson, deliberately inflated this number for its sensational impact.  In an apparent effort to \nshock the Court with his statistic, Dr. Matson counted the same type of restraint multiple times \nand included items such as wheelchairs in his tally. Exhibit E at 2. \n12  For example, unlike CHDC, the Connecticut and Massachusetts facilities did not have any children.  Also, for \nexample, the average age of residents at the Connecticut facility is much higher than the average at CHDC. \n17 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 18 of 57\nTo further demonstrate the depth of response required to expose the inaccuracies of \nPlaintiffs Motion, Defendants engaged a consultant to specifically respond to Plaintiffs \nallegations about the use of restraints at CHDC.  A draft portion of Defendants' consultant's \nreport on this issue is attached as Exhibit E.  As noted in that report: \nSince the initiation ofDOJ's interest in the facility \nmechanical restraints at CHDC have been steadily \ndeclining, a fact that was not included in the DOJ experts' \nreports. .. By 2009 the facility had cut this figure nearly in \nhalf. ... \" \nExhibit Eat 3.  This observation is further evidence that Plaintiffs Motion is disingenuous.  The \nPlaintiff initiated  its  investigation  of CHDC  in  2003.  In  2005,  Plaintiff knew that  certain \nrestraints were being used at CHDC, in accordance with CMS regulations, at even a higher level \nthan today, but Plaintiff did not seek to enjoin Defendants then.  Since 2005, the use of restraints \nhas dropped nearly in half.  Again, the Plaintiff seeks to unfairly shock the Court, and the press, \nto inappropriately obtain some advantage in this litigation. \n13 \nTo properly respond to all of the allegations in Plaintiffs baseless motion, Defendants \nwould have to marshal significant resources, direct resources away from their expert report \npreparation and trial preparation, and prematurely disclose its trial defense. \nII.  AS A LESS ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE, THAN STRIKING PLAINTIFF'S \nMOTION, THE DEFENDANTS REQUEST THAT ANY RESPONSE TO \nPLAINTIFF'S MOTION BE DELAYED UNTIL AFTER THE REPORTS OF \nDEFENDANTS' EXPERTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED \nGiven the great scope of the injunctive relief requested by the DOJ and the severe \nadverse impact that such relief would have on Defendants, residents at CHDC, and \n13  In fact, the Plaintiff focuses on the children at CHDC in order to further the emotional appeal of its Motion. \nHowever, the Plaintiff has known of the services being provided to these children for years but strategically chose to \nwait until a period of time to file its Motion to cause the most harm to Defendants' case.  The Defendants hope that \nthe Court rejects this inaccurate and exaggerated emotional appeal and allows the Defendants sufficient time to \ncomplete their valid rebuttal of Plaintiff's claims. \n18 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 19 of 57\ndevelopmentally disabled individuals served by Defendants,14 Defendants need sufficient time to \nconduct discovery and prepare a response to Plaintiff s Motion. \nThe reports of the Defendants' experts are already due on April 27, 2010.  A response to \nPlaintiffs' Motion could be completed within two (2) weeks of those reports being disclosed, or \nby May 11,2010.  This is not a lengthy period to wait to ensure a full and fair adjudication ofthe \nissues raised by the Plaintiff, especially in light of the self-serving delay of Plaintiff in bringing \nthis Motion.  The Court should prefer an accurate and complete presentation of the evidence by \nboth parties over a unilateral, biased, and inaccurate presentation by the Plaintiff. \nThe Defendants respectfully request that, as a less adequate alternative, that the Court \nenlarge the time for Defendants to respond to Plaintiff s Motion until May 1, 2001.  If the Court \nforces the Defendants to respond to the Plaintiff s Motion before that time, the Defendants \nrequest that the deadline for their expert reports be extended until forty-five (45) days after the \nCourt rules on Plaintiff s Motion, and possibly will request that the trial be delayed. \nIII.  THE PLAINTIFF CANNOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY FOR \nTHE COURT TO GRANT A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nIt is well-settled in the Eighth Circuit that motions for preliminary injunctions are \ngenerally measured against the factors set forth in the seminal decision in Dataphase Systems, \nInc. v. C L Systems, Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th Cir.1981). See Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d \n496,503 (8th Cir. 2006) (same factors); Interbake Foods, L.L.C. v. Tomasiello, 461 F.Supp.2d \n943, 954-55 (N.D. Iowa 2006); Doctor John's, Inc. v. City of Sioux City, Iowa, 305 F.Supp.2d \n1022, 1033-34 (N.D. Iowa 2004); Uncle B's Bakery, Inc. v. O'Rourke, 920 F.Supp. 1405, 1411 \n(N.D. Iowa 1996); Straights and Gays for Equality v. Osseo Area Schools-District, 471 F.3d 908, \n14  For example, CHDC provides extremely valuable respite services for some children that are experiencing severe \nbehavioral problems and cannot be accommodated in the community. The only alternative would be admission to a \npsychiatric facility that is not as well suited to address their needs.  After these individuals are stabilized at CHDC, \nthey are returned to the community.  The injunctive relief requested by Plaintiff would harm these children. \n19 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 20 of 57\n911 (8th Cir.2006) (same factors); Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496,503 (8th Cir.2006) (same \nfactors).  These so-called\" Dataphase factors\" include the following: (1) the movant's probability \nor likelihood of success on the merits, (2) the threat of irreparable harm or injury to the movant \nabsent the injunction, (3) the balance between the harm to the Plaintiff and the harm that the \ninjunction's issuance would inflict on other interested parties, and (4) the public interest. \nDataphase, 640 F.2d at 114. \nWhen applying the Dataphase factors, the burden is on the movant to establish that a \npreliminary injunction is appropriate. Lankford, 451 F.3d at 503; Baker Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. \nChaske, 28 F.3d 1466, 1472 (8th Cir.1994); Modem Computer Sys., Inc., v. Modem Banking \nSys., Inc., 871 F.2d 734, 737 (8th Cir.1989). \"'No single Dataphase factor in itself is dispositive; \nin each case all of the factors must be considered to determine whether on balance they weigh \ntowards granting the injunction.' \" Baker Elec. Co-op., 28 F.3d at 1472 (quoting Calvin Klein \nCosmetics Corp. v. Lenox Labs., Inc., 815 F.2d 500,503 (8th Cir.1987) (citing Dataphase )). \n\"The primary function of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo until, upon \nfinal hearing, a court may grant full, effective relief.\" Kansas City Southern Transport Co., Inc. \nv. Teamsters Local Union #41, 126 F.3d 1059, 1066 -1067 (8th Cir. 1997) (citing Ferry-Morse \nSeed Co. v. Food Com, Inc., 729 F.2d 589,593 (8th Cir.1984)).  \"The burden of establishing the \npropriety of a preliminary injunction is on the movant.\" Iowa Protection and Advocacy Services, \nInc. v. Gerard Treatment Programs, L.L.C. ,152 F.Supp.2d 1150, 1156 (1~.D. Iowa, \n2001)(quoting Baker Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. Chaske, 28 F.3d 1466, 1472 (8th Cir.1994)). \nA.  PLAINTIFF CANNOT DEMONSTRATE A SUBSTANTIAL \nLIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS OF ITS CLAIMS \nAGAINST DEFENDANTS \n20 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 21 of 57\nThe first factor that the Court must consider when ruling on a motion for preliminary \ninjunction is the likelihood or probability of success on the merits. Dataphase, 640 F.2d at 114. \nLikelihood of success on the merits requires that the movant support its position in governing \nlaw. Baker Elec. Co-op., 28 F.3d at 1473-74; ILQ Inv., Inc. v. City of Rochester, 25 F.3d 1413, \n1416 (8th Cir.1994) (first amendment and prior restraint of expression); City of Timber Lake v. \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe, 10 F.3d 554,556-58 (8th Cir.1993) (Indian tribe's regulatory \nauthority and authority of states to regulate activities on tribal lands); Aziz v. Moore, 8 F.3d 13, \n15 (8th Cir.1993) (denial of injunctive relief was proper because federal courts \"must abstain \nfrom imposing injunctions on prison officials [in an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action] 'in the \nabsence of a concrete showing of a valid claim and constitutionally mandated directives for \nrelief,' \") (quoting Rogers v. Scurr, 676 F.2d 1211, 1214 (8th Cir.1982)). \n\"[A]t the early stage of a preliminary injunction motion, the speculative nature of this \nparticular ['likelihood of success'] inquiry militates against any wooden or mathematical \napplication of the test.  Instead, a court should flexibly weigh the case's particular circumstances \nto determine whether the balance of equities so favors the movant that justice requires the court \nto intervene to preserve the status quo until the merits are determined.\" United Indus. Corp. v. \nClorox Co., 140F.3d 1175, 1179 (8th Cir.1998) (internal citations omitted).  In this case, the \nPlaintiff has not provided sufficient support for the claims it has asserted. \n1.  Plaintiff Does not have the Authority to Seek the ReliefR  equested \nEven if Plaintiff could state a claim for relief under the Fourteenth Amendment or the \nADA, CRIP A limits the remedies that Plaintiff can obtain in this case.  The CRIP A statutes \nprovide that the DOJ may initiate an action only for \"such equitable relief as may be appropriate \nto insure the minimum corrective measures necessary to insure the full enjoyment\" of \n21 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 22 of 57\nconstitutional rights, privileges; and immunities. 42 U.S.C. § 1997a(a) (emphasis added); See \nalso Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., 916 F. Supp. 133, 137-38 (D. Conn. 1996) (contrasting \nthe types of relief available to private plaintiffs with the Attorney General's right under CRIPA \nto seek only \"minimum corrective measures\").  \"It is not appropriate for the courts to specify \nwhich of several professionally acceptable choices should have been made.\" Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 321 (1982); See also 42 U.S.C. § 1997i (stating that provisions ofCRIPA \n\"shall not authorize promulgation of regulations defining standards of care\"). \nIn its motion, Plaintiff requests the following relief: \n1.  Cease all admissions of school-aged children to CHDC; \n2.  Direct specific treatment decisions for school-aged children \nand prohibit CHDC's psychiatrist from treating those children in \naccordance with his professional judgment and appoint another \npsychiatrist to second-guess decisions by CHDC's psychiatrist; \n3.  Substitute the Plaintiff s judgment regarding the use of \nrestraints for the judgment of the licensed, qualified professionals \nat CHDC that know the residents at CHDC; \n4.  Defendants retain a child psychiatrist; preclude the use of \nspecific restraints based solely on the Plaintiff s uninformed \nopinions; I 5 \n5.  Hire an independent team of doctoral level behavioral \nclinicians to second-guess the treatment decisions of licensed \nprofessionals who work with the residents of CHDC everyday; \n6.  The appointment of a consultant to second-guess the \ndecisions that parents and guardians of those children have made to \nhave their children at CHDC and placement of those children in \nother settings, regardless of the preferences of the parents or \nguardians; \n7.  Appoint a consultant, at Defendants' expense, to be a \n\"Community Placement Evaluator,\" who must have experience in \nmoving children out of institutions; The \"Community Placement \nEvaluator\" would then have 90 days to access all children at \nCHDC and direct the Defendants which children should be \nremoved from CHDC, then Defendants would have 30 days to \ndevelop a transition plan to implement the unilateral treatment \ndecision of the consultant, which is being substituted for the \ninformed decisions of parents, guardians, and treating professional. \n15 The specific restraints that Plaintiff wants precluded are recognized by eMS regulations as appropriate methods \nof restraint when used as part of a treatment plan. \n22 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 23 of 57\nPlaintiffs Memorandum at 45-48. \nThese requests clearly demonstrate that Plaintiff is not seeking \"minimum corrective \nmeasures,\" but rather to expand Defendants' system of care for the developmentally disabled \nbeyond what is minimally required by the ADA and the Constitution. Plaintiff seeks to impose a \nsystem of care based solely on it policy goals.  Plaintiff would have an injunctive order issue \nfrom this Court that usurps the functions of state officials and reduces them to \"mere \nfunctionaries in carrying out the court's commands.\" Newman v. Alabama, 683 F.2d 1312, 1320 \n(11 th Cir. 1982). Such relief is not authorized by CRIP A.  Plaintiff consequently cannot show a \nlikelihood of success on any of its claims for relief. \n2.  Plaintiff's Substantive Due Process Claim Will Fail Because it Cannot \nProve That Defendants Substantially Departed from Accepted Professional \nJudgment. \nStates are not constitutionally obligated to provide social services to their citizens. \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307,317 (1982).  The State of Arkansas has opted to provide \nsuch service to it citizens who have been diagnosed with a mental illness or developmental \ndisability.  Because the State has chosen to provide those services, the U.S. Supreme Court has \nheld that the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment imposes an \naffirmative duty on the State to protect certain rights of the individuals that it serves. \nSpecifically, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that persons in state custody have \"constitutionally \nprotected interests in conditions of reasonable care and safety, reasonably nomestrictive \nconfinement conditions, and such training as may be required by these interests.\" Youngberg, \n457 U.S. at 324.  Courts have consistently held that \"reasonable care\" does not impose a \nconstitutional standard of optimal treatment and minimal levels of care are sufficient. Id. at 323; \nHanson v. Clarke County, 867 F.2d 1115, 1120 (8th Cir. 1989) (finding no constitutional right to \n23 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 24 of 57\noptimal placement); Canupp v.

Jan. 13,2005) (finding that Illinois' treatment program was not \n\"optimal,\" but did not violate constitutional standards). \nThe State is required only to provide such treatment as an appropriate professional would \nconsider \"reasonable in light of [a person's] liberty interests in safety and freedom from \nunreasonable restraints.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 322; Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 807 F.2d 1243, 1251 \n(5th Cir. 1987); Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d.1239, \n1250 (2d Cir. 1984); Armstead v. Pingree, 629 F. Supp. 273,276 (M.D. Fla. 1986). \nIn determining what constitutes \"reasonable care,\" the Supreme Court in Youngberg \nemphasized that the State \"has considerable discretion in determining the nature and scope of its \nresponsibilities.\" 457 U.S. at 317.  Judicial deference must be afforded to the judgment that a \nqualified professional exercises: \"It is not appropriate for the courts to specify which of several \nprofessionally acceptable choices should have been made.\" Id. at 321. In fact, decisions made by \nsuch professionals are presumptively valid. Id. at 323; P.C. v.

Thompson, 715 F.2d 365, 368 (7th Cir. 1983) \n(rejecting appellants' argument that the state had the affirmative duty under the Rehab Act \"to \ncreate less restrictive community residential settings for them,\" and holding that because \"there \nis no contention that these class members, because of their handicap, are being denied access to \ncommunity residential living that Illinois is affording to others,\" the Rehab Act \"simply has no \napplication to appellants' claim\") (emphasis added). \nIn Porter v. Knickrehm, the plaintiff brought a § 1983 claim alleging that in the State of \nArkansas the human development centers' admission and discharge procedures violated \nconstitutional equal protection and procedural due process rights. Porter v. Knickrehm, 457 F.3d \n794 (8th Cir. 2006). The Court affirmed Judge Wright's District Court decisions, holding that \n\"[p ]rocedures under Arkansas statutes and under the internal policies of state human \ndevelopment center (HDC) for admission of mentally retarded persons to such centers satisfied \nprocedural due process.\" Id. at 799. The Court found that\" [0 ]nly minimal protections were \nneeded to meet procedural due process requirements for admitting mentally retarded individual \nto state human development center (HDC), where admission occurred voluntarily by authority of \nlegal guardian.\" Id. at 798 (citing Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584,606 (1979)). In the instant matter, \nthe Plaintiff seeks to circumvent State laws and regulations by imposing its policy preference for \ndeinstitutionalization on the Defendants. This Court has already found that the procedures for \nadmission and discharge at the State's human development centers meet constitutional due \nprocess standards. \nIn the instant matter, Plaintiff has attempted to substitute its judgment for that of the \nDefendants' professionals and seeks to deprive the Defendants of the opportunity to fully \n25 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 26 of 57\nrespond to Plaintiffs allegations in accordance with the schedule Plaintiff previously agreed \nupon.  Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs allegations are unfounded.  Defendants have \nconferred with their experts that are expected to testify at the trial in this matter, and those \nexperts have confirmed that their preliminary reviews support findings that the professionals at \nCHDC are exercising professional judgment in accordance with professional standards and all of \nPlaintiffs consultants' conclusions will be challenged at trial. \nEven without the Defendants' consultants' investigations completed or their reports \nfinished, the Plaintiff cannot meet its burden.  Conflicting expert testimony will not overcome \nthe presumption that the decisions of the treating professionals were valid.  A plaintiff cannot \nmeet its burden of proof by presenting nothing more than (1) a difference of professional opinion \nas to which practices are appropriate or (2) expert testimony that another course of action would \nhave been better. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 321; Collignon v. Milwaukee County, 163 F.3d 982, \n987 (7th Cir. 1998); Lelsz, 807 F.2d at 1243; Society for Good Will, 737 F.2d at 1248; Doe v. \nGaughan, 617 F.

Supp. at 584 (\"Optimal courses of treatment as determined by some expert, \nwhile laudable, do not establish the minimal constitutional standard.\"). \nPlaintiff cites two cases to support its position that \"a State violates the Due Process \nClause when it provides medical care that substantially departs from professional standards.\" \nPlaintiffs Memorandum at 30 (citing Rennie v. Klein, 720 F.2d 266, 269; Morgan v. Rabun, 128 \nF.3d 694,697-98 (8th Cir. 1997).  Both of those citations are misleading.  In Morgan v. Rabun \n26 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 27 of 57\nand Rennie v. Klein, the plaintiffs were involuntarily committed patients in mental health \nfacilities who were treated with psychotropic medications against their will.  The courts in those \ncases applied the standards identified above. \nIn Morgan v. Rabun, the Eight Circuit considered the substantive due process rights of an \ninvoluntarily committed man who was a threat to others. Morgan v. Rabun, 128 F.3d 694,698 \n(8th Cir. 1997).  The Court found that \"an individual's liberty interest in avoiding forcible \nadministration of psychotropic drugs is not unconditional.  We must balance this liberty interest \nagainst the relevant state interests to determine whether Morgan's constitutional rights were \nviolated.\" Id. at 696-97 (citing Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307,320-21).  That Court did not \nhold, as Plaintiff cited, \"a State violates the Due Process Clause when it provides medical care \nthat substantially departs from professional standard.\" Plaintiffs Memorandum at 30.  The \nMorgan Court reasoned that \"[t]he governmental interests in running a state mental hospital are \nsimilar in material aspects to that of running a prison.  Administrators have a vital interest in \nensuring the safety of their staff, other patients, and of course in ensuring the patients' own \nsafety.\" Id. at 697 (citing Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 227, (1990)).  The Court \nreasoned further that its \"role is not to determine conclusively that Morgan was indeed \ndangerous.  Rather, we must simply make certain that Dr. Rabun exercised professional \njudgment in making the determination that Morgan was dangerous.\" Id. at 697-98 (citing \nYoungberg. 457 U.S. at 321 (adopting the standard that \"the Constitution only requires that the \ncourts make certain that professional judgment in fact was exercised\").  In the instant matter, \nPlaintiff has not alleged that professional judgment was not exercised.  Plaintiff has only alleged \nthat its consultants recommend different treatment. \n27 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 28 of 57\nIn Rennie v. Klein, the Court merely reaffirmed its recognition of the right of an \ninvoluntarily committed, mentally ill patient to refuse the administration of antipsychotic drugs. \nRennie v. Klein, 720 F.2d 266 (3rd Cir. 1983).  The Court held that a mentally ill patient who has \nbeen involuntarily committed \"must have his constitutional right to refuse antipsychotic drugs \nmeasured [against] whether the patient constitutes a danger to himself or to others.\" Id. at 269. \nThe Court held further \"[b]ecause that evaluation must be the product of the medical authorities' \nprofessional judgment, such a judgment and the resulting decision to administer medication will \nbe presumed valid unless it is shown to be a 'substantial departure from accepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.'\"  Id. (citing Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323. \nThe Court's inquiry is limited to deciding \"whether the treatment or residence setting that \nactually was selected was a 'substantial departure' from prevailing standards of practice.\" \nSociety of Good Will, 747 F.2d at 1248-49. \"Liability may be imposed only when [a] decision \nby [a ] professional is such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, \nor standards as to demonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on \nsuch ajudgment.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 323. Liability is not established when experts simply \nopine that \"with appropriate supports, at least half of the over 510 CHDC residents are \nappropriate for a more integrated setting now.\" Plaintiff s Memorandum at 10 (citing Plaintiff s \nConsultant's Declaration, Exhibit 3 at 8-9.). Plaintiff cannot meet the Youngberg standard \nnecessary to overcome the presumption of validity and, consequently, cannot demonstrate a basis \nfor the intrusive relief that it seeks.  The care and safety of individuals at CHDC, at the very \nleast, demonstrate the exercise of professional judgment that is presumptively valid and aligned \nwith contemporary, accepted professional judgment, practice, and standards. \n28 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 29 of 57\nIf the Court determines that a hearing on this matter is necessary, Defendants will offer \ntestimony from treating professionals and nationally-recognized experts to demonstrate that \nprofessional judgment is exercised at CHDC.16 \n3.  Plaintiff Cannot Establish a Violation oft he ADA. \nOlmstead does not require deinstitutionalization or a state to close its institutions. \nDespite Plaintiff s conj ecture that \"at least half of the over 510 CHDC residents are appropriate \nfor a more integrated setting now[,]\" deinstitutionalization of all eligible disabled persons is not \nrequired by the ADA. Plaintiffs Memorandum at 10.  The Court in Conner v. Branstad, held that \n\"if Congress had actually intended to require states to provide community based programs for \nmentally disabled individuals currently residing in institutional settings, it surely would have \nfound a less oblique way of doing so.\" Conner v. Branstad, 839 F. Supp. 1346, 1357 (S.D. Iowa \n1993); See also U.S. v. Oregon, 782 F. Supp. at 514 (\"[P]remature or inappropriate community \nplacements would result in a much higher risk of potential harm than residents are exposed to at \n[the facility].\"). \nL  The ADA Does Not Give Plaintiff The Authority To Second-Guess \nMedical Decisions. \nAll decisions made by a professional are presumptively valid. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 \nU.S. 307,232 (1982).  \"[L]iability may be imposed only when the decision by the professional is \nsuch a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment practice, or standards as to \ndemonstrate that the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.\" \nId.  Plaintiff has not alleged any such substantial deviation from professional judgment.  The \nprofessional judgment standard is met even where experts disagree with care or treatment \n16 Defendants reserve the right to move to exclude all or portions of Plaintiffs consultants' declarations and reports \nas well as the testimony of any or all of Plaintiffs consultants pursuant to Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, \nInc., 509 U.S. 579,113 S.Ct. 2786 (1993) and the Court's Amended Scheduling Order. \n29 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 30 of 57\ndecisions that were actually made or where they think another course of conduct would have \nbeen better. Society for Good Will to Retarded Children v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1248 (2nd \nCir. 1984).  \"[P]rofessional judgment has nothing to do with what course of action would make \npatients safer, happier, and more productive.\" Id.  The issue is \"not whether the optimal course of \ntreatment, as determined by some experts, is being followed.\" Id. \nThe relief requested by Plaintiff necessarily involves a determination of the \nappropriateness of medical services, including psychiatric care.  Treating physicians and other \nprofessionals have concluded that the medical needs of all residents at CHDC are being met. \nSuch medical decisions are not reviewable under ADA or the Rehab Act.  The Eight Circuit has \nspecifically held that \"a lawsuit under the Rehab Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act \n(ADA) cannot be based on medical treatment decisions\" Burger v. Bloomberg, 418 F. 3d 882 \n(8th Cir. 2005) (citing Schiavo v. Schiavo, 403 F. 3d 1289, 1294 (lIth Cir. 2005) (\"[t]he \nRehabilitation Act, like the ADA, was never intended to apply to decisions involving ... medical \ntreatment.\"); Fitzgerald v. Corr. Corp. of Amer., 403 F. 3d 1134, 1144 (lOth Cir. 2005) (inmate'S \nclaims under Rehab Act and ADA were properly dismissed for failure to state claim as they were \nbased on medical treatment decisions)). \nIn Buchanan, et al. v. Maine, the First Circuit noted that \"[T]he [Rehabilitation Act and \nADA] do not guarantee any particular level of medical care for disabled persons.\" Buchanan, et \nal. v. Maine, 469 F. 3d 158, 174 (lst Cir. 2006).  That Court found that \"[t]here [was] no \nevidence that Buchanan was either discriminated against or not provided the additional services \n[he sought] 'by reason of his disability.'\"  Id.  In reaching that conclusion, the Circuit Court noted \nthat there are: \ntwo situations in which a challenge based on a treatment decision \nmight be made: (1) the treatment decision was so unreasonable as \n30 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 31 of 57\nto be arbitrary and capricious, raising an implication of pretext for \nsome discriminatory motive, and (2) if not pretextual, the treatment \ndecision was based on stereotypes of the disabled rather than an \nindividualized inquiry as to the plaintiff's conditions ... There was \nnothing unreasonable about the treatment decisions in this case and \ncertainly no stereotyping, so neither of these arguments is \navailable. \nBuchanan, 469 F. 3d at 176. \nThe holdings in these appellate cases are consistent with Justice Kennedy's concurring \nopinion in Olmstead.  In his opinion, Justice Kennedy noted that \"[I]t is undisputed that the \nState's own treating professionals determined that community-based care was medically \nappropriate for respondents.\" Olmstead v. L.C. ex reI. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581,609, 119 S. Ct. \n2176, 144 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1999).  Not only did Olmstead not address whether medical treatment \ndecisions are subject to review under the ADA and the Rehab Act, it effectively carved out \nmedical decision-making from the scope of the ADA and Rehab Act. \nAt CHDC, Defendants care for over 500 residents with significant medical issues, 24-\nhours a day.  Plaintiff cites to three isolated incidents to support its claim that professional \njudgment is not exercised. Plaintiff's Memorandum at 31.  At trial, Defendants will show that \nPlaintiff should have had a primary care physician or nurse review medical records at CHDC, \nrather than the psychiatrists that it employed.  Nevertheless, this list of isolated incidents, from \nacross a broad spectrum of medical services provided at CHDC, does not show a substantial \ndeparture from accepted professional judgment and consequently does not prove a constitutional \nviolation. See Williams v. Wasserman, 164 F. Supp. 2d 591, 619 (D. Md. 2001) (\"It is true, and \nunfortunate, that the representative plaintiffs suffered injuries while they were hospitalized. \nThose injuries, however, do not necessarily indicate a constitutional violation.\").  Plaintiff's \nconsultants' opinions are also unreliable because they are based on anecdotal stories and isolated \n31 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 32 of 57\nincidents that do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. at \n589 (\"[I]solated examples of problems, while regrettable, do not establish constitutional \nviolations.\") (citing Shaw v. Strackhouse, 920 F.2d at 1143); Society for Good Will, 737 F.2d at \n1245 (\"Isolated instances of inadequate care, or even of malpractice, do not demonstrate a \nconstitutional violation.\") \nAt best, Plaintiffs consultants' conclusions reflect a difference of professional opinion, \nbut they do not establish a prima facie case that Defendants have violated the Youngberg \nstandard. See Johnson v. Murphy, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24013, at *54-55 (M.D. Fla. June 28, \n2001); Williams, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 619; United States v. Oregon, 782 F. Supp. 502, 513 (D. Or. \n1991).  In most instances, Plaintiff s consultants simply disagree with the treatment decisions \nmade by Defendants' treating professionals. It is insufficient for Plaintiff to merely insert \nconclusory language, such as \"[i]n a substantial departure from accepted professional \nstandards .... \"  That does not create grounds for the Court to find a constitutional violation. \nIn some cases, however, Plaintiffs consultants deliberately manipulate information to \nmislead the Court.  For example, the Plaintiff inaccurately claims that: \nCHDC residents die at the strikingly young age of 46.5 years. \nExhibit 7 (Declaration of Edwin Mikkelson) at 8.  According to \ncomparative studies, 72 years of age is the approximate normal life \nspan for individuals with developmental disabilities who live in an \ninstitution, a quarter of a century longer than residents of CHDC. \nId. \nPlaintiffs Memorandum of Points and Authorities at 5.  This allegation is unsupported by the \n17 \ndata and is outrageously false.  It was obviously intended to create sensational newspaper \nheadlines and to bias the Court, but it is baseless.  See Argument 1. D above. \n17  The Defendants object to having to reveal any of their experts' opinions prior to the date agreed upon by the \nPlaintiff.  However, Defendants want to demonstrate the frivolous nature of Plaintiffs Motion. \n32 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 33 of 57\nIf the Court determines that a hearing on this matter is necessary, Defendants will \nintroduce additional evidence to refute every allegation by Plaintiff regarding medical care \nprovided at CHDC. \nIL  The ADA Does Not Give Plaintiff The Authority To Second-Guess \nPublic Education Services. \nPlaintiff cites Monahan v. State of Nebraska, for the proposition that \"[t]he lack of \nappropriate special education services also causes irreparable harm.\" Plaintiffs Memorandum at \n19 (citing Monahan v. State of Nebraska, 645 F.2d 592 (8th Cir. 1981».  Plaintiff claims that the \nCourt held that \"plaintiff had established a threat of irreparable harm sufficient to support a \npreliminary injunction where the plaintiff student had been making 'little progress' in her then-\ncurrent placement, and 'the resulting harm to [plaintiff] was irreparable and ... preliminary relief \nwas appropriate to limit such harm.\" Id.  Plaintiffs citation to this case is an attempt to mislead \nthe Court. \nThat case was originally filed as Monahan v. State of Nebraska, 491 F. Supp. 1074 (D. \nNeb. 1980).  The District Court in that case granted a preliminary injunction to the plaintiff \nsolely on the basis of a Nebraska state statute that allegedly conflicted with a federal statute. Id. \nat 1095.  That Court did not address the plaintiffs Rehab Act claim. See Monahan v. State of \nNebraska, 687 F.2d 1164, 1167 (1982).  The Defendant appealed that case to the Eight Circuit, \nwhich is cited by the Plaintiff in the instant matter. Plaintiffs Memorandum at 19 (citing \nMonahan v. State of Nebraska, 645 F.2d 592 (8th Cir. 1981) for the proposition:  plaintiff had \nestablished a threat of irreparable harm sufficient to support a preliminary injunction where the \nplaintiff student had been making \"little progress\" in her then-current placement, and \"the \nresulting harm to [plaintiff] was irreparable and ... preliminary relief was appropriate to limit \n33 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 34 of 57\nsuch harm.\").  This citation is an attempt to mislead the Court regarding the current standard in \nthe Eighth Circuit. \nIn Monahan v. State of Nebraska, 645 F.2d 592 (8th Cir. 1981), the Eighth Circuit \nremanded to the District Court.  The District Court dismissed the case because the State of \nNebraska had amended the allegedly conflicting state statute, rendering the relief plaintiff sought \nmoot. Rose v. State of Nebraska, 530 F. Supp. 295, 299 (D. Neb 1981).18  That decision was \nappealed by the plaintiff because, like the Plaintiff in the instant matter, she believed she was \nentitled to relief under the Rehabilitation Act.  In Monahan v. State of Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 \n(1982), the Eighth Circuit held '\" [N]either the language, purpose, nor history of § 504 reveals an \nintent to impose an affirmative-action obligation on all recipients of federal funds.\" Monahan v. \nState of Nebraska, 487 F.2d 1164, 1170 (8th Cir. 1982) (citing Southeastern Community College \nv. Davis, 442 U.S. 397,411 (1979). \nThe Court reasoned that it could not \"read § 504 [of the Rehab Act] as creating general \ntort liability for educational malpractice, especially since the Supreme Court, in interpreting the \n[Education for All Handicapped Children Act], has warned against a court's substitution of its \nown judgment for educational decisions made by state officials.\" Id. at 1170-71. \nMonahan v. State of Nebraska is authoritative precedent, relevant for to the instant \nmatter, but not for the reasons cited by Plaintiff.  In Monahan, the Eighth Circuit articulated a \nstandard for the judging the deviation from accepted professional standards.  The Court held that \n\"either bad faith or gross misjudgment should be shown before a § 504 violation can be made \nout, at least in the context of education of handicapped children.\" Monahan v. State of Nebraska, \n687 F.2d 1164, 1171 (1982).  Plaintiff does not, and could not, allege that the provision of \n18 The name change in the caption ofthis case was the result of relief being denied to the originally named plaintiff. \nMarla Rose was the remaining plaintiff. Rose v. State of Nebraska, 530 F. Supp. 295, 297 (D. Neb 1981). \n34 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 35 of 57\neducation services at CHDC is being done in bad faith or is a gross misjudgment.  If the Court \ndeems that a hearing is necessary on this issue, Defendants will offer evidence to show that all \ndecisions surrounding the educational services at CHDC meet and exceed professional judgment. \nIlL  The Plaintiff Does Not Have The Authority To Second-Guess The \nUse ofR  estraints at CHDC. \nThe State is required only to provide such treatment as an appropriate professional would \nconsider \"reasonable in light of [a person's] liberty interests in safety and freedom from \nunreasonable restraints.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 322; Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 807 F.2d 1243, 1251 \n(5th Cir. 1987); Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d.1239, \n1250 (2d Cir. 1984); Armstead v. Pingree, 629 F. Supp. 273,276 (M.D. Fla. 1986). \nIn determining what constitutes \"reasonable care,\" the Supreme Court in Youngberg \nemphasized that the State \"has considerable discretion in determining the nature and scope of its \nresponsibilities.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 317.  Judicial deference must be afforded to the \njudgment that a qualified professional exercises: \"It is not appropriate for the courts to specify \nwhich of several professionally acceptable choices should have been made.\" Id. at 321.  In fact, \ndecisions made by such professionals are presumptively valid. Id. at 323; P.C. v. McLaughlin, \n913 F.2d 1033, 1043 (2d Cir. 1990) (stating that courts should not \"ascertain whether in fact the \nbest course of action was taken\"). \nThe cases cited by Plaintiff in its Memorandum are not dispositive.  In those cases \nrestraints were used as punishments in contravention of federal regulations. See Thomas S. v. \nFlaherty, 902 F.2d 250,252 (4th Cir. 1990); See also Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 807 F.2d 1243, 1251 \n(5th Cir. 1987).  Plaintiff has not, and could not, allege that professionals at CHDC use restraints \nas punishment.  It is improper that Plaintiff would even cite to this type of caselaw, knowing that \nrestraints are used at CHDC in accordance with all federal regulations. \n35 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 36 of 57\nThe only other basis for Plaintiffs claims that the use of restraints at CHDC is improper \nis its reliance on CMS regulations. Plaintiffs Memorandum at 37-38,41-42.  As noted above, \nCMS is the federal agency responsible for developing regulations governing ICPIMR facilities. \nCMS has its own lawyers and administrative court to enforce its regulations and ensure that the \nBy \nfacilities it certifies comply with all relevant professional standards.  its citation and reliance \non CMS regulations, Plaintiff acknowledges that CMS standards reflect the professional \nstandards that it is applying in this case.  As noted above, CMS has certified that CHDC has \ncomplied with all relevant federal regulations, including management, client protections, facility \nstaffing, active treatment services, client behavior and facility practices, health care services, \nphysical environment, and dietetic services. See 42 CPR Part 483, Subpart I, Sections 483.400-\n483.480.  CMS determines compliance with its regulations using a survey process in which its \nsurveyors conduct specific reviews of specific information.  None of Plaintiffs consultants have \nhad any experience as a CMS surveyor and their familiarity with the regulations is limited.  The \nbetter qualified CMS surveyors have already concluded that CHDC's use of restraints meets aU \nprofessional standards incorporated into the CMS regulations. \nIn an effort to support its misleading argument, Plaintiff alleges that \"CHDC utilizes 41 \ndifferent forms of mechanical restraint, including straitjackets, 'restraint chairs,' and 'papoose \nboards.' Exhibit 26 at 4; Exhibit 27 at 4.\" Plaintiffs Memorandum at 14.  Plaintiff, and its \nconsultant, Dr. Matson, deliberately inflated this number for its salacious impact.  See Argument \n1. D. above. \nIf the Court deems that a hearing on these issues necessary, Defendants will offer \nevidence of the context for the use of restraints at CHDC, the applicable professional standards, \nand accurate factual evidence of the use of restraints at CHDC. \n36 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 37 of 57\n4.  The Requested Relief would be a Fundamental Alteration to Defendants' \nPrograms that Serve All Disabled Citizens ofA  rkansas \nTitle II of the ADA, which applies to public services furnished by governmental entities, \nprovides that \"no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of \na public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\" 42 U.S.C. § 12132. An \n\"integration mandate\" contained in the DOJ's regulations implementing the ADA states that \nservices must be provided \"in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the qualified \nindividuals with disabilities.\" 28 c.P.R. § 35. 130(d). \nIn Olmstead, the U.S. Supreme Court held that \"unjustified isolation\" can constitute \ndiscrimination under the ADA only \"when the State's treatment professionals have determined \nthat community placement is appropriate, the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive \nsetting is not opposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be reasonably \naccommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others \nwith mental disabilities.,,19 Olmstead v. L.C. ex reI. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 587.  If a state is \nfound to have discriminated in such a manner, it must make reasonable modifications to resolve \nthe discrimination, but its responsibility to provide community-based treatment options \"is not \nboundless.\" Id. at 603.  A modification is not reasonable (and thus not required) if it will impair a \nstate's ability to (1) maintain a range of facilities for the care and treatment of persons with \ndiverse disabilities and (2) administer services and apportion resources equitably across a broad \nspectrum of need. Id. at 603-06. \n19 Plaintiff ignores this language in Olmstead and argues that the input of treatment professionals is not required. Plaintiff's Memorandum at_. \nThis contention cannot be reconciled with the plain language of Olmstead and further demonstrates the Plaintiff's attempt to mislead the Court \nwith its erroneous repreresentations of the ADA. \n37 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 38 of 57\nMoreover, the ADA does not require a state to implement modifications that entail a \n\"fundamental alteration\" of the state's overall program for administering mental health services. \nId. at 603-04; 28 C.F.R. § 35. 130(b)(7) (\"A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in \npolicies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination \non the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications \nwould fundamentally alter the nature of the services, program, or activity.\"). \"[T]he \nfundamental-alteration component ... allow[ s] the State to show that, in the allocation of \navailable resources, immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable, given the \nresponsibility the State has undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse \npopulation of persons with mental disabilities.\" Olmstead v. L.C. ex reI. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, \n604. \nThus, to rebut primafacie evidence of discrimination under the ADA, a Defendants may \nshow that they are making a reasonable modification through their \"comprehensive, effectively \nworking plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings, and \na waiting list that movers] at a reasonable pace not controlled by the State's endeavors to keep its \ninstitutions fully populated.\" Id. at 605-06.  Alternatively, Defendants may demonstrate that the \nrelief sought amounts to a \"fundamental alteration\" of its program. Id. at 603-04; See also Easley \nex reZ. Easley v. Snider, 36 F.3d 297,305 (3d Cir. 1994); ARC of Washington State, Inc. v. \nBraddock, 427 F.3d 615,618 (9th Cir. 2005); Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., 1999 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 1479, at *36 (D.

Tex. 1994). \n38 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 39 of 57\nAlthough the integration mandate requires states \"to make 'reasonable modification in \npolicies, practices, or procedures' that are 'necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of \ndisability ... \"', ARC of Washington State, Inc. v. Braddock, 427 F.3d 615, 618 (9th Cir. 2005) \n(citing 28 C.F.R. § 35.13 O(b )(7)), such compliance does not include an obligation to make \n\"modifications [that] would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\" \nId.; Olmstead v. L. C. by Zirnring, 527 U.S. at 605; Bryson v. Shumway, 308 F.3d 79,86 (lst \nCir. 2002) (acknowledging that § 1396n(c) contemplates state waiver plans with definite limits \non the number of individuals served, and the right of states to include a limit on the number of \nwaiver slots they request.). \nOlmstead does not require, as Plaintiff argues, deinstitutionalization of all eligible \ndisabled persons. Conner v. Branstad, 839 F. Supp. 1346, 1357 (S.D. Iowa 1993) (\"[I]fCongress \nhad actually intended to require states to provide community based programs for mentally \ndisabled individuals currently residing in institutional settings, it surely would have found a less \noblique way of doing so.\"); United States v. Oregon, 782 F. Supp. 502,514 (D. Or. 1991) \n(\"[P]remature or inappropriate community placements would result in a much higher risk of \npotential harm than residents are exposed to at [the facility].\"). \nIf a hearing is deemed necessary by the Court, Defendants will produce evidence to \ndemonstrate that the relief sought by Plaintiff will constitute a fundamental alteration. \nDefendants programs serve disabled people throughout the State of Arkansas.  The Defendants \ncarefully allocate resources to provide the most services to the most individuals.  Plaintiff s \nrequested relief is so onerous and broad that its effects may not even be able to be calculated. \nFor example, among many other requests for relief, within 90 days, Plaintiff wants Defendants to \nhire \"an independent team of doctoral-level behavioral clinicians with actual training and \n39 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 40 of 57\nexperience in contemporary, evidence-based behavioral management programs.\" Plaintiffs \nMemorandum at 46.  The purpose of that team would be to review treatment decisions by \nlicensed psychologists currently treating CHDC residents. Id.  There is the obvious financial \nburden that this type of requirement would have.  This requirement, like all of the requests made \nby Plaintiff, would take resources away from other programs that Defendants operate.  It may \nalso be a challenge to recruit a sufficient number of professionals to comprise the Plaintiffs \n\"team.\" The Plaintiff appears to have specific ideas for the type of individuals it wants on its \n\"team,\" but it has no suggestion how to recruit them.  That burden will be on the Defendants. \nThe creation of such a team would fundamentally alter the system that exists at CHDC.  As noted \nabove, if the Court deems that a hearing in this matter is necessary, Defendants will offer \nevidence to support its fundamental alteration defense at that hearing. \nB.  NO IRREPRABLE HARM \nThe second Dataphase factor is the threat of irreparable harm to the movant absent the \ninjunction. Dataphase, 640 F.2d at 114.  In the Eighth Circuit, \"a party moving for a preliminary \ninjunction is required to show the threat of irreparable harm.\" Baker Elec. Co-op., 28 FJd at \n1472 (citing Modem Computer Sys., 871 F.2d at 738, and Dataphase).  The lack of irreparable \nharm is sufficient ground for denying or vacating a preliminary injunction. Aswegan v. Henry, \n981 F.2d 313, 314 (8th Cir.1992) (citing Modem Computer Sys., 871 F.2d at 738).  Stated \ndifferently, \"[t]he threshold inquiry is whether the movant has shown the threat of irreparable \ninjury.\" Glenwood Bridge, 940 F.2d at 371 (quoting Gelco Corp. v. Coniston Partners, 811 F.2d \n414,418 (8th Cir.1987)).  More specifically, the Eighth Circuit has held that the movant's failure \nto sustain its burden of proving irreparable harm ends the inquiry \"and the denial of the \ninjunctive request is warranted.\" Gelco Corp. v. Coniston Partners, 811 F.2d 414, 420. Accord \n40 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 41 of 57\nModem Computer Sys., 871 Fold at 738.  The Eighth Circuit has also explained, \"the basis of \ninjunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable harm and inadequacy of legal \nremedies.\" Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 506-07, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Edold \n988 (1959).  Thus, to warrant a preliminary injunction, the moving party must demonstrate a \nsufficient threat of irreparable harm. See Adam-Mellang v. Apartment Search, Inc., 96 F.3d 297, \n299 (8th Cir.1996). \nPlaintiffs delay in seeking a Preliminary Injunction \"belies any claim of irreparable \ninjury pending trial.\"  Hubbard Feeds v. Animal Feed Supplement, 182 F.3d 598 (8th Cir. 1999); \nSee also Tough Traveler, Ltd. v. Outbound Products, 60 F.3d 964, 968 (2d Cir. 1995) (Plaintiffs \ndelay \"undercuts the sense of urgency that ordinarily accompanies a motion for preliminary \nrelief and suggests that there is, in fact, no irreparable injury.\" Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 \nF.3d 891, 903 (7th Cir. 2001) (\"Delay in pursuing a preliminary injunction may raise questions \nregarding the plaintiff s claim that he or she will face irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction \nis not entered.\"); Palm Beach County Environmental. Coalition v. Florida, 587 F. Supp. 2d. \n1254, 1257 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (stating that delay in both seeking injunctive relief when the \nsubstantial issues were known to the plaintiffs and failure to timely serve defendants \"belie[] \nplaintiffs' argument that there will be immediate injury absent injunctive relief'); Golden Bear \nInt'I, Inc. v. Bear U.S.A., Inc., 969 F. Supp. 742, 748 (N.D. Ga. 1996) (Camp, J.) (\"Preliminary \ninjunctions are issued to prevent imminent and inevitable injury to the movant, and undue delay \n'speaks volumes about whether a plaintiff is being irreparably injured.''') (citation omitted). \nThe standard is well-settled, Plaintiff is required to show a \"real and immediate\" threat of \nsubstantial, irreparable harm before the Court should intervene. O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. \n488,494 (1974); Watkins Inc. v. Lewis, 346 F.3d 841 (8th Cir. 2003) (Failure to show \n41 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 42 of 57\nirreparable harm is an independently sufficient ground upon which to deny a preliminary \ninjunction.); Adam-Mellang v. Apartment Search, Inc., 96 F.3d 297 (8th Cir. 1996) (Failure to \nshow irreparable harm is, by itself, a sufficient ground upon which to deny a preliminary \ninjunction.)  In the instant matter, Plaintiff fails to identify any specific individual at risk any \n2o \nactual, imminent harm or danger. If Plaintiff had identified any such individual during its tours \nofCHDC or in its review of documents, the Defendants would certainly have moved on it own \naccord to protect that individual, without requiring the intervention from the Court?1 \nOn the issue of actual harm, Plaintiff simply \"takes us into the area of speculation and \nconjecture,\" O'Shea, 414 U.S. at 497, and does nothing but recite generalities such as, \"[l]ong \nterm, unnecessary segregation causes irreparable harm.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum at 17 (citing \nPlaintiff's consultant's declaration, Exhibit 12 at 22).  In short, Plaintiff has not alleged imminent \nharm to any particular person served by Defendants.  Plaintiff's broad policy initiative to \nencourage more community treatment does not meet the test for irreparable injury.  Issuance of \nan injunction on this basis would be improper because the relief, even as articulated by Plaintiff, \n20 In fact, the proposed re1iefthat Plaintiff seeks to be implemented immediately risks far more harm to the developmentally disabled citizens of \nArkansas than do current practices by the Defendants. \n21  The absence of any alleged specific injury to any particular individual also raises an issue as to ripeness of Plaintiff's request for injunctive \nrelief. A claim is not ripe for adjudication if it depends on contingent future circumstances that may not occur as anticipated, or may not occur at \nall. Texas v. United States, 528 U.S. 296,300 (1998). A ripeness challenge requires a court to assess both the fitness of the issues for \nconsideration and the hardship to the parties of withholding the court's consideration . .!d. at 300-01. The purpose of the ripeness doctrine, among \nother things, is to prevent judicial interference before a proceeding has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the parties. \nAbbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49 (1967). The Eighth Circuit has repeatedly stated that a case is not ripe ifthere is no \nshowing that the injury is \"direct, immediate, or certain to occur.\" Public Water Supply District No. 10 ofCass Countv, Mo. v. Citv of Peculiar, \nMo.,345 F.3d 570, 573 (8th Cir.2003). \"A claim is not ripe for adjudication ifit rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as \nanticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\" KCCP Trust v. Citv of North Kansas Citv, 432 F .3d 897, 899 (8th Cir.2005) (quoting Texas v. \nUnited States, 523 U.S. 296 (1998)). Accordingly, courts examining the ripeness of a particular case must consider \"both the fitness of the issues \nfor judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\" .!d. (internal citations omitted). Finally, \"[t]o be ripe for \ndecision, the harm asserted must have matured enough to warrant judicial intervention. The plaintiffs need not wait until the threatened injury \noccurs, but the injury must be certainly impending.\" Paraguad v. St. Louis Housing Authoritv. 259 F .3d 956,958 (8th Cir.2001). \nIn this case, the Plaintiff presents only anecdotal evidence of isolated injuries that have occurred in the past and vaguely asserts that there is \npotential for harm to occur in the future: The Plaintiffs' claims are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. The Plaintiff cannot \ndemonstrate that it is facing a direct, immediate injury, or an injury that is certain to occur, particularly where the underlying facts in the \nallegations are as flawed as those proffered by Plaintiff and its consultants. For example, the Plaintiff requests an injunction preventing the \nDefendants from admitting any additional children into CHDC, but Plaintiff has not identified any particular individual whose admission it seeks \nto block.  Plaintiff cannot know the implications of potentially blocking an admission to CHDC because it has not even considered representing \nthe interests of any particular individual. Plaintiff has an obligation to show that it is requesting relief that is related to an actual or imminent \ninjury being incurred by someone.  Instead, Plaintiff supports its allegations and request for re1iefby offering platitudes and questionable \nprofessional standards from its consultants. Neither Plaintiff nor its consultants did a complete analysis of medication administration or the use of \nrestraints at CHDC, or the specific impact on any particular individual residing at CHDC. \n42 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 43 of 57\nis amorphous. Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 738 (1974) (quoting Swann v. Charlotte \nMecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 16 (1971) (The power of the federal courts to restructure \nthe operation of local and state governmental entities is not plenary.  It \"may be exercised 'only \non the basis of a constitutional violation. \"'); See also Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 377 (1976) \nIn an effort to support its position, Plaintiff cites several cases, from various jurisdictions, \nbut Plaintiff cannot show the constitutional harm required in Youngberg.  The Plaintiff cites \nHenderson v. Bodine Aluminum, Inc. for the proposition that \"[d]eath and permanent injury \ncause by failure in medical care constitutes irreparable harm.\" Plaintiffs Memorandum at 16 \n(citing Henderson v. Bodine Aluminum, Inc., 70 F.3d 958,961 (8th Cir. 1995)).  The plaintiff in \nHenderson was denied medical coverage by her insurance company sought an injunction to \nallow her to have treatment for breast cancer. Henderson, 70 F.3d 958,961.  In the instant \nmatter, Plaintiff has made no such allegations of a life-threatening illness. \nPlaintiffs citation to Rodde v. Bonta simply does not support its position, but it does \nsupport the Defendants' position.  In Rodde, the Ninth Circuit held the shutting down of \ndefendant's only hospitals designed to serve disabled individuals violated Title II because the \nservices designed for the general population, while available to the disabled, \"would not \nadequately serve the unique needs of the disabled who therefore would be effectively denied \nservices that the non-disabled continued to receive.\" Rodde, 357 F.3d 988,998 (9th Cir. 2004). \nThe relief that Plaintiff seeks through its motion would create the same problems that the Ninth \nCircuit warns against in Rodde. \nPlaintiffs citation to National Ass'n of Psychiatric Health Systems v. Shalala, is equally \nmisleading.  That case did not hold, as Plaintiff cites, \"[t]he inappropriate use of mechanical \nrestraints causes irreparable harm.\" Plaintiffs Memorandum at 16.  Plaintiff has baldly \n43 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 44 of 57\nmisrepresented that case to the Court.  In Shalala, private hospitals brought an action against the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services seeking to enjoin a final rule requiring a practitioner to \nevaluate a patient, face-to-face, within one hour after the patient has been placed in restraints or \nin seclusion. Shalala, 120 F.Supp.2d 33, 44 (D.D.C.2000).  The Court denied the motion for \npreliminary injunction because the plaintiffs \"failed to show what, if any, irreparable harm would \nbefall them should the Court refuse to enter an injunction.\" Id. at 44. \nPlaintiff cites Parham v. J.R. in an attempt to support its claim that children at CHDC are \nbeing isolated. Plaintiffs Memorandum at 17 (citing Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584,627-28 \n(1979).  In Parham the U.S. Supreme Court evaluated Georgia's procedural due process that was \nafforded children prior to their admission to the state mental health facilities.  The Court held \nthat the State's due process procedures were constitutional. Id. at 620.  Plaintiffs citation to the \ndissenting opinion of the Court shows Plaintiffs desperate attempt to manipulate this Court by \nemotionally referring to Justice Brennan's concern that the needs of children be met.  Defendants \nalready provide a broad spectrum of unique services to the children they serves at CHDC and \nthroughout the State of Arkansas. \nPlaintiffs citation to Disability Advocates Inc. v. Patterson, is irrelevant.  That case \naddressed the State of New York's Olmstead plan and its waiver services.  In the 128-page \nopinion from the Eastern District, the Court does not mention \"irreparable harm\" anywhere. See \nDisability Advocates Inc. v. Patterson, 653 F. Supp.2d 184 (E.D.N.Y. 2009). \nPlaintiff has not identified any actual or imminent harm that will incur.  Its specious \nclaims do not establish the constitutional harm required by Youngberg.  If the Court deems that a \nhearing on this matter is necessary, Defendants will offer factual and expert evidence to \ndemonstrate that Plaintiff s argument of irreparable harm has no merit. \n44 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 45 of 57\nC.  THE DAMAGE THAT AN INJUNCTION WILL CAUSE CHDC, DDS, \nDHS, AND THE STATE OF ARKANSAS FAR OUTWEIGHS THE \nTHREATENED INJURY TO PLAINTIFF. \nThe third Dataphase factor requires the Court to balance the harm to the Plaintiff if the \nrequested relief is not granted against the harm to the Defendants and other interested parties if \nthe injunction is issued. Dataphase, 640 F.2d at 114.  The \"balance of harms\" analysis is not \nidentical to the \"irreparable harm\" analysis. Pottgen v. Missouri State High Sch. Activities \nAss'n., 40 F.3d 926,  929 (8th Cir.1994).  Irreparable harm focuses on the harm or potential harm \nto the movant. Dataphase, 640 Fold at 114.  In contrast, the balance of harms analysis examines \nthe harm of granting or denying the injunction upon both of the parties to the dispute and upon \nother interested parties, including the public. Id.; See also Glenwood Bridge, 940 F.2d at 372 \n(considering the effect of granting or denying the injunction on the public's interest in a public \nworks construction project as well as upon the parties in the balance of harm analysis); Modern \nComputer Sys., 871 F.2d at 737-38 (harm to other interested parties also considered). \nIn conducting the \"balance of harms\" analysis required under Dataphase, an illusory \nharm to the movant will not outweigh any actual harm to the rionmovant. Frank B. Hall & Co. v. \nAlexander & Alexander, Inc., 974 F.2d 1020, 1023 (8th Cir. 1992).  To determine what must be \nweighed, courts have looked at the potential economic harm to each of the parties and to \ninterested third parties of either granting or denying the injunction as relevant. Baker Elec. Co-\nQlb 28 F.3d at 1473.  Present harm as the result of past misconduct is not sufficient to justify the \ninjury to the non-movant of granting a preliminary injunction requiring some additional \ncorrective action because such relief \"goes beyond the purpose of a preliminary injunction.\" \nSanborn Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Campbell Hausfeld/Scott Fetzer Co., 997 Fold 484, 489, 490 (8th Cir. \n1993). \n45 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 46 of 57\nPlaintiff has failed to articulate any irreparable harm.  Therefore, it cannot show that its \nhardship outweighs the potential hardship to the Defendants, the individuals served by \nDefendants, the families and friends of the individuals served by Defendants, and the taxpayers \nof the State of Arkansas. Yakus, 321 U.S. 414, 440. (\"The award of an interlocutory [i.e. \npreliminary] injunction by courts of equity has never been regarded as strictly a matter of right, \neven though irreparable injury may otherwise result to the plaintiff.\") \nThe balancing of the equities weighs heavily in favor ofCHDC, DDS, DHS, and the \nState of Arkansas.  The Defendants are operating a statewide system of care for the \ndevelopmentally disabled.  Defendants provide numerous services for many unique individuals. \nThe allocation of resources is carefully planned to provide the most services for the most \nindividuals.  Plaintiff arrogantly indicates in its Memorandum that the relief it seeks will \"cause \nno significant harm to Defendants.\" Plaintiffs Memorandum at 42.  The Plaintiff has not even \nmade not effort to understand the services that the Defendants provide.  In balancing the \nhardships, the Court should consider whether the injunctive relief being sought is prohibitory or \nmandatory, as is the case here. See generally llA Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary \nKay Kane, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE § 2948.2 (2d ed. 1995 & Supp. 2009). \nThe purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final \ndetermination of the lawsuit. Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). See also \nRathmann Group v. Tanenbaum, 889 F.2d 787, 789-90 (8th Cir.1989) (quoting Ferry-Morse \nSeed Co. v.

Mathews, 544 F.2d 1233,1243 (5th Cir.l976). \n\"Mandatory preliminary relief, which goes well beyond simply maintaining the status quo \npendente lite is particularly disfavored, and should not be issued unless the facts and law clearly \nfavor the moving party.\" Martinez, 544 F.2d 1233, 1243. \nIn the instant matter, the Plaintiff seeks substantially all of the same relief that it could \nhope to receive after a full and fair trial.  In cases where, as here, the preliminary injunction \nwould give Plaintiff all or most of the relief to which it would be entitled if it were successful at \ntrial on the merits, preliminary relief may be \"excessively burdensome.\" Wright & Miller, supra, \n§ 2948.2.  The Plaintiff is not seeking to stop the Defendants from engaging in any particular \nactivity, but rather seeks to use the Court's power to impose affirmative requirements on the \nDefendants that reflect Plaintiffs policy preferences for the State of Arkansas's administration of \nprograms for the developmentally disabled.  Plaintiff here seeks what the Eleventh Circuit \nrejected in Newman v. Alabama: to make State officials \"mere functionaries in carrying out the \ncourt's commands.\" 683 F.2d at 1320. \n\"Federal courts operate according to institutional rules and procedures that are poorly \nsuited to the management of state agencies.\" Angela R. v. Clinton, 999 F.2d 320,326 (8th Cir. \n1993). Accordingly, courts \"should refrain from micromanaging the state and its agencies.\" \nUnited States v. Missouri, 535 F.3d 844, 851 (8th Cir. 2008).  In the mental health context, the \nU.S. Supreme Court has warned that \"interference by the federal judiciary with the internal \noperations of these institutions should be minimized.\" Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 322. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned, principles of federalism must be respected: \n47 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 48 of 57\nWhere, as here, the exercise of authority by state officials is \nattacked, federal courts must be constantly mindful of the \"special \ndelicacy of the adjustment to be preserved between federal \nequitable power and State administration of its own law\" .... \nWhen the frame of reference moves ... to a system of federal \ncourts representing the Nation, subsisting side by side with 50 state \njudicial, legislative, and executive branches, appropriate \nconsideration must be given to principles of federalism in \ndetermining the availability and scope of equitable relief \nRizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362,378-79 (1976) (citations omitted).  These principles apply when \n\"injunctive relief is sought against ... those in charge of an executive branch of an agency of \nstate or local governments.\" Id. at 380. \n\"[F]ederal courts should accord deference to state policymakers' programmatic and \npolitical funding decisions regarding mental health funding.\" Frederick L. v.

Even in the Olmstead decision, the Court recognized \n\"the federalism costs inherent in referring state decisions regarding the administration of \ntreatment programs and the allocation of resources to the reviewing authority of the federal \ncourts,\" Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 610 (Kennedy, J. concurring).  Justice Kennedy noted that respect \nshould be granted to states to determine how best to provide appropriate community-based \nmental health programs \"taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of \nothers with mental disabilities.\" Id. at 607 (plurality opinion). \"It is of central importance, then, \nthat courts apply [the Olmstead] decision with great deference to the medical decisions of the \nresponsible, treating physicians and, as the Court makes clear, with appropriate deference to the \nprogram funding decisions of state policymakers.\" Id. at 610 (Kennedy, J., concurring). \n48 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 49 of 57\nPlaintiff contends that the balancing of the equities favors it because if its relief is \ngranted, \"CHDC must simply invest the minimum resources and administrative support \nnecessary to protect the lives and safety of its residents.\" Plaintiffs Memorandum at 43. \nPlaintiff has no idea what type of resources and supports are necessary to protect the lives and \nsafety of the residents at CHDC and the other individuals served by Defendants.  In Olmstead, \nthe United States, the same Plaintiff that now seeks an injunction, filed an amicus curiae to the \nU.S. Supreme Court stating \"a comparison so simple overlooks costs the State cannot avoid; \nmost notably, a 'State ... may experience increased overall expenses by funding community \nplacements without being able to take advantage of the savings associated with the closure of \ninstitutions.'\"  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 604 (quoting Br. for U.S. as Amicus Curiae at 21).  Plaintiff \ndismissive comment, that its reliefwill \"cause no significant harm to Defendants,\" is a clear \nindication that the Plaintiff does not understand the services that Defendants provide or the type \nof relief that it seeks. \nIf the Court deems that a hearing is necessary, the Defendants will offer evidence ofthe \ndepth and breadth of the services that they provide for the disabled and the careful allocation of \nresources by the Defendants.  Defendants will also introduce evidence of the full impact that \nPlaintiffs careless request for relief would actually have on the Defendants and the individuals \nthat Defendants serve. \nD.  THE PUBLIC INTEREST REQUIRES THAT PLAINTIFF'S REQUEST \nFOR INJUNCTION RELIEF BE DENIED \nThe final Dataphase factor requires the Court to consider the public interest. Dataphase, \n640 F.2d at 114; Pottgen v. Missouri State High School Ass'n, 40 F.3d 926,929 (8th Cir. 1994); \nBranstad v. Glickman, 118 F. Supp. 2d 925,943 (N.D. Iowa 2000). The public interest factor \ninvites the court to consider broad observations about conduct that is generally recognizable as \n49 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 50 of 57\ncostly or injurious. Id.  This factor also allows the Court to consider the public's interest in \nminimizing unnecessary costs to be met from public coffers. B & D Land and Livestock Co. v. \nVeneman, 231 F.Supp.2d 895,912 (N.D. Iowa 2002). \nIn this case, the public interest does not weigh in favor of granting a preliminary \ninjunction.  \"Where a Plaintiff seeks an injunction that will adversely affect a public interest for \nwhose impairment, even temporarily, an injunction bond cannot compensate, the court may in \nthe public interest withhold relief until a final determination of the rights of the parties, though \nthe postponement may be burdensome to the plaintiff.\" Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 64 \nS.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834 (1944) (citations omitted).  Even if the Court finds that a violation of the \nlaw has occurred, not every violation of the law entitles a Plaintiff to an injunction. See e.g. TVA \nv. Hill, 437 U.S., at 193,98 S.Ct., at 2301; Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S., at 329,64 S.Ct., at \n591. \nPlaintiff s argument that the public interest favors granting the injunction misses the \npoint.  Plaintiff argues that if its allegations are true, then generally it would be in the public \ninterest to grant the relief it seeks.  Plaintiff does not even attempt to argue that the preliminary \nrelief it seeks is justified.  There is no public interest that is served by granting the preliminary \ninjunction that Plaintiff seeks. \nPlaintiff cites Jaffe v. Redmond for the proposition that \"[t]he mental health of our \ncitizenry, no less than its physical health, is a public good of transcendent importance.\" \nPlaintiffs Memorandum at 44 (citing Jaffe v. Redmond, 518 U.S. 1, 11 (1996)).  Defendants do \nnot dispute this proposition.  The proposition does not support Plaintiff s position though. \nThe Plaintiff is required to show that a preliminary injunction is in the public interest, not \nthat \"the mental health of our citizenry ... is a public good ..... \"  Plaintiff has not even attempted \n50 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 51 of 57\nto put forth an argument that, specifically, granting a preliminary injunction would be in the \npublic good. \nSimilarly, Plaintiff cites Nat'l Ass'n of Psychiatric Health Systems v. Shalala for \"finding \nthat the public interest supported upholding a rule that required medical review of restraints after \none hour because 'restraints and seclusion are dangerous interventions' and 'severe \npsychological and physical injuries' result from the inappropriate use of restraints' [sic]\" \nPlaintiff's Memorandum at 44 (citing Nat'l Ass'n of Psychiatric Health Systems v. Shalala, 120 \nF. Supp. 2d. 33,45 (D.D.C. 2000)).  CHDC has the same policy.  Plaintiff is well aware of that \npolicy and has not even alleged that CHDC administers its policy in any other way.  At a hearing \non this matter, CHDC will introduce evidence to document its policy that if a restraint is \nnecessary it is only administered in accordance with professional judgment and never for more \nthan an hour. \nIn Arkansas Medical Society v. Reynolds, the District Court enjoined the State's plan to \nreduce its reimbursement rates to Medicaid providers.  The plaintiff produced evidence that \nreducing the reimbursement rate for specific providers would impact their ability to receive \nservices.  The Court in Reynolds granted the injunction to \"maintain the status quo with respect \nto those services until plaintiffs' claims [could] be adequately investigated and adjudicated.\" \nArkansas Medical Society v. Reynolds, 834 F. Supp. 1097, 1103 (E.D. Ark. 1992)).  In the \ninstant matter the Defendants are not seeking to alter the status quo.  Instead, it is the Plaintiff \nwho seeks to change the status quo.  Defendants contend that the status quo should be \nmaintained.  The trial in this matter is scheduled for September 2010.  As discussed above, \nPlaintiff's allegations do not allege any irreparable harm. \n51 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 52 of 57\nLike many of the cases cited in Plaintiffs Memorandum, Plaintiff has miscited Reynolds. \nPlaintiff cites Reynolds for holding that '\" [i]n view of the public interest involved, medical care \nto patients, the Court feels that the weight of discretion is on the side of granting the motion [for \npreliminary injunction].' (internal citations omitted).\" Plaintiff s Memorandum at 44 (citing \nArkansas Medical Society v. Reynolds, 834 F. Supp. 1097, 1102, 1103-04 (E.D. Ark. 1992)). \nContrary to Plaintiffs representation, Reynolds did not reach such a conclusion.  The Court in \nReynolds specifically held that \"It cannot at this time be said who the balance of harm and the \npublic interest favors, and the Court makes no findings in that regard.\" Reynolds at 1103. \nPlaintiffs citation appears to be a quote from Arkansas Society of Pathologists v. Harris, \nNo. LR-C-80-02 (E.D. Ark. June 4, 1980).  In that case the Arkansas Society of Pathologists \nsuccessfully enjoined a proposed regulatory change proposed by HCF A that would have required \nthe pathologists to bill hospitals for their services instead of directly billing patients, as their \npractice had been.  Ultimately, Congress amended the Medicare Act to allow its proposed \nregulatory change?2  Plaintiffs misquotation of case law represents the way in which it has \ncarelessly asserted claims against the Defendants.  Plaintiffs reckless accusations undeimine the \nhard work that is done everyday at CHDC, DDS, DHS and the entire state of Arkansas to \nprovide all levels of service to developmentally disabled individuals. \n22 Congress enacted §108 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. Section 108 directed the secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to distinguish between services performed by hospital-based physicians \n(A) which constitute professional medical services, which are personally rendered for an individual patient by a physician and which \ncontribute to the diagnosis or treatment of an individual patient and which may be reimbursed as physician services under Part B of \n[Medicare], and \n(B) which constitute professional services which are rendered for the general benefit to patients in a hospital or skilled nursing facility \nand which may be reimbursed only on a reasonable cost basis .... \nUnder subsection B of this section, pathologists were to look to hospitals for compensation for professional component services to Medicare \npatients from payment to hospitals made under Part A of Medicare. \n52 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 53 of 57\nThe Defendants provide critical services for the developmentally disabled in the State of \nArkansas.  They provide a complete spectrum of services for the developmentally disabled. \nCHDC has been certified by CMS since that federal agency has offered the certification and for \nthe past thirteen (13) years CHDC has sought, and obtained, private accreditation from CARF. \nPlaintiff does not have the skill or expertise to make recommendations to change the care \nprovided to the residents of CHDC or any individual served by Defendants programs.  Yet, \nPlaintiff would have the Court enter an injunction to disrupt the programs operated by \nDefendants without any consideration for the impact that those changes would have on the \nindividuals served by Defendants.  Among other things, Plaintiffs relief would also usurp the \nrights of parents and guardians to make decisions for their loved ones.  Notably, in over fifty (50) \nexhibits attached to Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Memorandum, there is not \na single affidavit from a parent or guardian of a child at CHDC.  If a hearing on this matter is \ndeemed necessary, the Defendants will produce, among other witnesses, parents and guardians \nwho will be impacted by the Plaintiffs wanton request for relief. \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants respectfully move the Court to enter an Order striking Plaintiffs \nbelated and inappropriate Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Plaintiffs Motion has no basis in \nlaw or fact and was not filed in good faith.  Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Injunction is a \ntransparent attempt to disrupt Defendants trial preparation, to present allegations without \nopportunity for a fair rebuttal, and to obtain relief it would not otherwise receive in a full and fair \ntrial on the merits.  In an attempt by Plaintiff to avoid the reliable and compelling opinions of the \nDefendants' experts, pursuant to the agreed upon Scheduling Order, the Plaintiff has chosen to \n53 \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 50   Filed 03/23/10   Page 54 of 57\ntry to ambush the Defendants before their defense can be completed.  The evidence, however, \nreveals the lack of urgency and the lack of merit to this request for Preliminary Injunction. \nIn the alternative, the Defendants request an enlargement of time for the \nDefendants to respond to Plaintiffs Motion to (a) allow the Defendants the full and fair \nopportunity to complete their experts' reports as agreed to by the parties, (b) allow the \nDefendants to complete their expert reports that are expected to directly contradict the findings \nof Plaintiff s experts before ruling on the Plaintiff s Motion, and (c) allow the Defendants \nsufficient time to conduct other discovery and to respond to the factual misrepresentations made \nin the Plaintiff s Motion. \nIn any case, the Plaintiff cannot meet the requirements for obtaining a preliminary \na \ninjunction.  If  hearing is required, Defendants will effectively dispute all of the allegations of \nPlaintiff s Motion.  The request for a preliminary injunction should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted, \nCounsel for Defendants \n/s/ Thomas B. York \nTHOMAS B.

The State of Arkansas (“State”)\nfails to serve residents in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs in\nviolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213,\nand exposes residents to death and injury as a result of unconstitutional medication\nmanagement and restraint practices.  \nIn this Motion, the United States seeks to halt all further admissions of\nchildren to CHDC in order to mitigate the irreparable harm caused by unlawful\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 2 of 51\ninstitutionalization until such time as this matter can be fully resolved at trial and\nseeks to ensure that all children currently institutionalized at CHDC are permitted\nto receive services in the most integrated setting.  The United States also seeks\nimmediate relief for all current residents from CHDC’s most dangerous conditions,\nspecifically, its medication management and restraint practices. \nHundreds of individuals are needlessly institutionalized at CHDC.  The vast\nmajority of these individuals were first admitted to CHDC as children several\ndecades ago.  In fact, there is substantial evidence to show that, from the moment\nan individual enters CHDC, the chances of release to a more integrated setting\nseverely diminish, particularly for those who first enter as children.  \nOnce admitted to CHDC, residents are likely to die at a very young age\ncompared to residents in similar institutions.  In fact, a CHDC resident is more\nlikely to die than be discharged to a more integrated setting.  The evidence also\nshows that CHDC fails to properly administer and monitor powerful psychotropic\nmedications.  There is also substantial evidence that CHDC inappropriately and\nexcessively relies on severely restrictive, outdated types of restraints to control its\nresidents.\nImmediate relief is necessary to stop ongoing, severe, and irreparable harm. \nThat relief must target the conditions at CHDC that place all residents at the most\nimminent risk – conditions that have led to death, organ failure, and exposure to\nlethal side effects of medication and have exposed individuals to needless and\n2\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 3 of 51\nharmful restraints–while requiring that the State ensure that no more of its\nyoungest and most vulnerable citizens are exposed to this unsafe and\ninappropriately segregated institutional environment.\nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nThe United States notified the State of its intent to investigate conditions at\nCHDC pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA),\n42 U.S.C. § 1997, on November 8, 2002.  On April 21, 2004, the United States\nissued a 50-page letter of findings regarding CHDC, which concluded that there\nwere significant and widespread deficiencies in the conditions and care at CHDC, in\nviolation of both the United States Constitution and federal law.  See Exhibit 1\n(Letter dated April 21, 2004, from then-Assistant Attorney General R. Alexander\nAcosta to then-Governor Mike Huckabee) at 2.  For several years the United States\nattempted to resolve the investigation of CHDC outside of litigation.  Those efforts\nwere unsuccessful, and the United States filed this lawsuit on January 16, 2009.\nSince the filing of its Complaint, the United States has conducted extensive\ndiscovery through interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and facility\ntours.  The information collected through discovery to date provides sufficient\nevidence to demonstrate that residents face increasing and grave risk of harm with\neach day that deficiencies are ignored.  Accordingly, the United States files this\nMotion to obtain narrow, preliminary relief aimed at preventing further harm\ncaused by CHDC’s most egregious deficiencies.   \n3\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 4 of 51\nA. Hundreds of Individuals Remain Inappropriately\nInstitutionalized at CHDC.\nCHDC is a large, congregate facility, certified as an “Intermediate Care\nFacility for the Mentally Retarded” (ICF/MR) that houses approximately 510\nindividuals with developmental disabilities.  Exhibit 2 (Roster of CHDC Residents,\nCON-US-59969-59993).1  CHDC has been in operation since 1959, when it opened\nits doors as the Arkansas Children’s Colony.   “About the Conway Human\nDevelopment Center,” available at http://www.chdconline.com (“About Us”) (last\nvisited March 9, 2010).  It is the oldest and largest of Arkansas’s six residential\nfacilities for individuals with developmental disabilities.  Id.  CHDC’s residents\nrange from eight to seventy-three years old.  Exhibit 2.  Residents are grouped into\none of five “teams” based on CHDC’s assessment of their skill level and degree of\nphysical and intellectual disability.  http://www.chdconline.com (“About Us”).  Each\nteam has its own administrative structure and “team leader.” \nThe CHDC complex is a “self-contained community” that offers its more than\n500 residents with disabilities few opportunities to live alongside of, or experience\nlife with, people without disabilities.   Exhibit 3 (Declaration of Toni Richardson) at\n2-3.  The living units at CHDC are communal, and most have dormitory style\nbedrooms, some with as many as ten beds in one room.  Id. at 3.  Food is delivered\n1 All Bates labeled documents used as exhibits to this Motion were produced by\nDefendants in response to the United States’ Requests for Production of Documents\nin this case.\n4\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 5 of 51\nto each unit from a central kitchen and typically plated by the unit staff.  Id.  There\nis a public address system in each residence that announces certain times of day. \nExhibit 4 (Deposition of Angela Green) at 131:23-25, 132:1-10.  Fewer than twenty\npeople leave the CHDC grounds for day programs or employment.  Exhibit 3 at 3.\nCHDC’s residents tend to come in as children and stay for a lifetime.  In fact,\nof the 512 people residing at CHDC as of June 2009, more than 80% were admitted\nto CHDC as children under the age of 18, and more than a third were admitted\nbefore the age of 10.  Exhibit 2.  Of those children admitted before they were 18\nyears old, 68% have been living at CHDC for more than 30 years.  Id.  Of those\nchildren admitted before they were 10 years old, 83% have been at CHDC for more\nthan 30 years.  Id.  \nBetween June 1, 2007, and October 1, 2009, a resident at CHDC was more\nlikely to die at the facility than to be discharged to a more integrated setting.  See\nExhibit 5 (Treatment Records of CHDC Residents Who Have Died, CON-US-\n60013.001-60013.018); Exhibit 6 (List of Discharged CHDC Residents, US-CON-A-\n46190-46193).  Furthermore, CHDC residents die at the strikingly young age of\n46.5 years.  Exhibit 7 (Declaration of Edwin Mikkelson) at 8.  According to\ncomparative studies, 72 years of age is the approximate normal life span for\nindividuals with developmental disabilities who live in an institution, a quarter of a\ncentury longer than residents of CHDC.  Id. \n5\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 6 of 51\nCHDC has an unusually high number of school-aged residents.2  There are\nnow approximately 50 children at CHDC,3 about 10% of CHDC’s total population\nand about 40% more than at the time of DOJ’s CRIPA investigation.  Exhibit 2.  In\ncontrast, of the remaining states operating large, public institutions for persons\nwith intellectual and developmental disabilities as of June 30, 2008, almost 20%\nhad no children or adolescents in residence whatsoever, and over 60% served no\nchildren under age 15 in such institutions.  Exhibit 8 (Declaration of Robert\nGettings) at 2-3.\nDuring the last two years, children have comprised more than half of all new\nadmissions to CHDC.  Exhibit 4 at 84:21-25, 85:1-8.  Approximately 18 of the\nchildren are under the age of 16, and at least one is only eight years old.  Exhibit 2.\nAny special education instruction that CHDC school-aged residents receive is\nprovided in classrooms located on the grounds of the facility, isolated from their\npeers without disabilities.  Exhibit 9 (Declaration of Susan Thibadeau) at 2-3. \nThus, CHDC children have no opportunity to interact either socially or\n2 By “school-aged residents,” the United States is referring to all residents who\nqualify for special education services under the IDEA which, in the State of\nArkansas, includes residents up to the age of 21. A.C.A § 6-41-203. For purposes of\nthis Motion, the United States refers to all such residents as “children.”\n3 This number is based on the most recent roster of CHDC that the State has\nprovided to the United States.  Due to ongoing admissions and discharges at CHDC,\nincluding residents at CHDC temporarily for respite care, it should be considered\napproximate. \n6\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 7 of 51\nacademically with students without disabilities.  Id.; Exhibit 10 (Deposition of\nTamara Hill) at 93:2-20; Exhibit 11 (Deposition of Susan Milum) at 45:13-22. \nFurther, none of the CHDC children receives a full day of special education services\nor adequate transition plans.  Exhibit 9 at 3.\n1. Arkansas Has No Plan For Moving Institutionalized Individuals\nTo The Most Integrated Setting.\n \nIn March 2003, the Governor's Integrated Services Task Force (GIST) issued\nthe State’s “Olmstead Plan.”4  According to its terms, Arkansas’ Olmstead Plan\napplies to all Arkansans with significant long term support needs.  Exhibit 12 at 1-\n3.  In its Olmstead Plan, the State acknowledges that it is not doing enough to\ndivert admissions to institutions, pointing out that “[o]nce a person has made the\nnecessary lifestyle changes to enter an institution, he or she may find that it is\nmore difficult to return home than it would have been to remain in the community\nin the first place.”  Exhibit 12 at 22; Exhibit 8 at 9.  However, the State is not\ntaking any meaningful action to end unnecessary segregation of individuals with\ndisabilities, nor even using its Olmstead Plan as a working document.5  Exhibit 8 at\n4 Exhibit 12 (The Olmstead Plan in Arkansas:   A Catalyst for Collaboration\nand Change; The Governor's Integrated Services Task Force and Arkansas\nDepartment of Human Services:  March 31, 2003, available at\nhttp://www.daas.ar.gov/organizations_olmstead_plan_doc.html (Last visited\nFebruary 4, 2010) (the “Olmstead Plan”).\n5 The State’s lack of current efforts to end unnecessary segregation is\nparticularly puzzling in light of testimony by the Assistant Director of DDS’ Waiver\nUnit.  Ms. Cromer testified that if release was staggered to give providers time to\n7\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 8 of 51\n7; Exhibit 13 (Deposition of Glenda Higgs, DHS Program Administrator for Quality\nAssurance at 18:11-25; Exhibit 14 (Deposition of Carole Cromer, Division of\nDisabilities Services (“DDS”), Assistant Director, Waiver Unit) at 77:2-6; Exhibit 15\n(Deposition of Shelley Lee, DDS Assistant Director, Quality Assurance Unit) at\n27:14-25, 28:1-7; Exhibit 4 at 75:23-25, 76:1-8.  Instead, the State is actively\nincreasing its capacity for institutionalizing children.  The State has an action plan\nfor expanding CHDC's children's program which includes increasing the housing\navailable at CHDC for school-aged children.  Exhibit 16 (Attachment to email from\nShelley Lee to Calvin Price, et al., dated March 6, 2009);  Exhibit 17 (Attachment to\nemail from Traci Harris to Calvin Price, et al., dated July 11, 2008).   At the same\ntime, the State is expanding its state-wide institutional system by building a new\n16-bed facility for children with developmental disabilities and mental illness on\nthe grounds of the Southeast Arkansas Human Developmental Center.  Exhibit 18\n(Email from Brenda Mercer to Susanne Ballard, et al., dated April 21, 2009).\nIn fact, in a report released earlier this year, United Cerebral Palsy, Inc. gave\nArkansas an overall ranking of second to last among the fifty states and the District\nof Columbia for supporting community-inclusive lives for individuals with\nintellectual and developmental disabilities who receive Medicaid-funded services. \nExhibit 8 at 3-4.  Indeed, the number of individuals with developmental disabilities\nhire appropriate staff, then Arkansas community providers could absorb the 1,334\npeople on the waiting list for ACS waiver services.  Exhibit 14 at 68:3-13. \n8\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 9 of 51\nwho are waiting to receive community-based services is on the rise in Arkansas,\nwith over 1,300 currently waiting to receive services through the Centers for\nMedicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) Alternative Community Services waiver\nprogram (“ACS waiver program or services”).6  Exhibit 14 at 49:24-25, 50:1-6.  The\ncurrent wait time in Arkansas for people with developmental disabilities to receive\nACS waiver services is approximately two and a half years.  Exhibit 14 at 49:12-23;\nExhibit 15 at 57:24-25, 58:1-2.  According to the State’s 2008 waiver renewal\nrequest, the State has no plan to increase the number of waiver slots until, at the\nearliest, 2014.  Exhibit 8 at 10.  The current average annual cost for an individual\nto participate in the State’s waiver program is $38,000, while the average annual\ncost of placement at an ICF/MR is roughly $68,000.7  Exhibit 14 at 28:17-25,\n29:1-14.   \n6 This is a third of the total number (3,988) of waiver slots available for\npersons with developmental disabilities in the entire state of Arkansas. Exhibit 8 at\n10.\n7 Nationwide, Arkansas had the lowest weighed average per diem\nexpenditures ($271.27) in its publicly-operated I/DD residential facilities during FY\n2007.  The State’s average weighted per diem was 78 percent below the national\naverage ($484.20) for facilities in all reporting states that year.  Average annual per\nparticipant expenditures on Medicaid home and community-based waiver services\nin Arkansas during FY 2008 ($28,977.83) was 50 percent below the average per\nparticipant expenditure level in all states ($43,464.29).  In FY 2008, the average per\nresident expenditure on home and community based services in Arkansas ($34.01)\nwas less than one-half the median per resident expenditure in all states ($73.37).\nThe state ranked 46th among the states and the District of Columbia in FY 2008 in\nwaiver expenditures per resident.  Exhibit 8 at 3. \n9\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 10 of 51\n2. CHDC’s Treatment Approach Guarantees That Most Residents\nWill Spend Their Entire Lives In A Segregated Institution.  \nThe United States’ expert estimates that with appropriate supports, at least\nhalf of the over 510 CHDC residents are appropriate for a more integrated setting\nnow.  Exhibit 3 at 8-9.  Yet, the State has identified only five current CHDC\nresidents as appropriate for community integration via the ACS waiver program. \nExhibit 19 (List of Residents Recommended for Waiver, CON-US-0059104).  This\ndramatic discrepancy reflects a pervasive institutional bias at CHDC, and this bias\ndrives CHDC’s approach to treatment planning.  In fact, the staff at CHDC know\nlittle to nothing about community-based treatment.  Exhibit 3 at 4-7.  For instance,\nthe CHDC employee identified by the State as the person most knowledgeable about\ncommunity placement testified to her belief that CHDC is an “integrated setting,”\nbecause “[i]t is a place that can meet individuals’ needs, it allows them to have\ntraining, social interaction, allows them to go, do.”  Exhibit 4 at 132:10-14.   \nNot surprisingly, CHDC’s assessments of residents’ appropriateness for a\nmore integrated setting are terribly inaccurate.  This is evident in the plans of care,\nor “Individual Program Plans” (“IPPs”), that CHDC staff develop for residents. \nInstead of focusing on what supports residents require to live meaningful lives in\nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, CHDC’s IPPs identify\narbitrary skills, such as tooth brushing or matching clothing, as prerequisites for\n10\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 11 of 51\nplacement, even though the ability to accomplish these tasks has no bearing on\nwhether an individual is appropriate for community placement.  Exhibit 3 at 6-7.  \nIn fact, typically, the only way that community placement is meaningfully\nconsidered at CHDC is if an individual or guardian proactively expresses an\ninterest in pursuing community-based treatment.  Id. at 4-5; Exhibit 4 at 151:1-12. \nYet, despite that the onus is on residents and their guardians to initiate pursuit of\ncommunity placement, guardians are provided very little meaningful information\nwith which to make this important decision.  See Exhibit 20 (Defendant’s Response\nto United States’ First Request For Production of Documents, No. 36, CON-US-\n0018120); Exhibit 4 at 124:6-9. \nIn the meantime, while residents remain inappropriately placed at CHDC,\nthey are exposed to dangerous and unconstitutional conditions, as set forth below. \nIn fact, in some cases, the environmental conditions inherent in institutional living\nmay lead to residents’ unnecessary exposure to potentially harmful medication side\neffects and physical restraints.  See infra sections III.B.2 and III.B.4.\nB. CHDC’s Medication Management Practices Place All Residents\nAt Risk of Avoidable Harm.\nIn recent years, at least three CHDC residents have died, suffered possible\npermanent organ damage, or been at risk of hemorrhaging to death because of the\npsychotropic medications administered to them at CHDC.   At least two residents\nwere hospitalized for Lithium poisoning, one as recently as October 2009.  Exhibit 7\n11\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 12 of 51\nat 4; Exhibit 21 (Hospital Admissions List dated November 30, 2009 US-CON-A-\n0045650-662) at 5-6.  Many other CHDC residents are at risk of harm from side\neffects, but have not been identified as such by CHDC or its treating clinicians. \nExhibit 7 at 4-5; Exhibit 22 (Declaration of Jodie Holloway) at 3-5.  Medical charts\nand direct observation show indications of involuntary movements, abnormal organ\nfunction tests, and dangerous blood levels associated with side effects of\npsychotropic medication which have gone undetected or untreated by CHDC or its\ntreating clinicians.  Exhibit 22 at 11, 13-14; Exhibit 7 at 4-5.  Currently, CHDC has\nno effective system to detect or treat these serious side effects.  Exhibit 7 at 3-4.\nPsychotropic medication is widely prescribed at CHDC; approximately 55% of\nCHDC residents currently receive one or more psychotropic medications, and over\n80% of the children at CHDC receive psychotropics.  Exhibit 23 (CHDC Residents\non Psychotropic Medications, US-CON-A 17839-17939).  A “significant portion” of\nCHDC’s over 500 residents have received “first-generation” antipsychotics for\nseveral years during their lives.  Exhibit 24 (Deposition of Douglas Callahan) at\n195:10-25, 196:1-10.  \nFirst-generation antipsychotics are an older class of medication associated\nwith a significant risk of serious side effects, including tardive dyskinesia (a\nmovement disorder characterized by frequent, repetitive, involuntary movements of\nthe lips, tongue, jaw, face, trunk, and/or limbs).  Exhibit 22 at 4.  Further, at least\nfifty CHDC residents currently receive other medications that can cause tardive\n12\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 13 of 51\ndyskinesia or other movement disorders.  Id. at 4, 6.  Through medical record\nreview and brief observations of CHDC residents, the United States’ experts\nidentified residents displaying symptoms consistent with tardive dyskinesia.  Id. at\n7.  Yet, in CHDC’s roster of diagnoses and medications, and in the numerous CHDC\nmedical records reviewed by the United States’ experts, only a few residents were\nidentified as having a tardive dyskinesia diagnosis or as warranting further\nassessment to rule out tardive dyskinesia.  Id. at 6-7.\nCHDC employs one consulting psychiatrist, Dr. Douglas Callahan, to treat\nthese residents, including children.  Exhibit 7 at 5-6.   Although he admits that\nchildren at CHDC have complicated diagnoses, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist has\nno specialized training or accreditation in child psychiatry.  Exhibit 24 at 33:16-18;\n34:10-12; 237:1-10.  Moreover, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist is not subject to any\nclinical oversight.  Exhibit 25 (Deposition of Denise Thomas) at 40:18-25, 41:1-2.  \nCHDC’s consulting psychiatrist spends approximately 2.4 hours per year\nwith each of the 278 CHDC residents he follows.  Exhibit 7 at 3, 6.  The vast\nmajority of the consulting psychiatrist’s evaluations take place in CHDC's medical\nbuilding rather than on the resident’s living units and do not include the resident’s\ntreatment teams.  Id. at 6. \nClinical staff receive no side effects training or information other than a\ngeneric description of the effects when a new medication is prescribed.  Id. at 5. \nCHDC’s consulting psychiatrist does not meet with treatment teams to advise or\n13\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 14 of 51\neducate them on a resident’s vulnerability or experience with the side effects of his\nor her medication.  Id. at 6.  Moreover, CHDC’s psychiatric consultation notes\nroutinely fail to identify possible medication side effects, adverse drug reactions, or\nharmful drug interactions.  Id.\nC. CHDC Uses Harmful and Unnecessary Methods of Restraint.\nAt CHDC, the widespread use of mechanical restraints is permitted as part of\na highly restrictive scheme that places citizens with developmental disabilities at\ngrave risk of harm.  See Exhibit 26 (Declaration of Johnny Matson) at 4; Exhibit 27\n(Declaration of Ramasamy Manikam) at 4-5.  When children are subjected to such\nrestraints, the abuses are particularly unconscionable.  Id.\nCHDC utilizes 41 different forms of mechanical restraint, including\nstraitjackets, “restraint chairs,” and “papoose boards.”  Exhibit 26 at 4; Exhibit 27\nat 4.  The use of straitjackets is itself highly troubling, as straitjackets have\ngenerally been eliminated from use in most facilities similar to CHDC for years. \nExhibit 26 at 4.  Similarly, the “restraint chair” and “papoose board” are clinically\nindefensible when used at CHDC.  The “restraint chair” is a chair that allows staff\nto completely immobilize a resident by strapping him in a seat with large padded\nforms.  Id., Exhibit 27 at 4-5.  The “papoose board” is a padded board to which a\nresident is horizontally strapped such that his arms, legs, and torso are\nimmobilized.  Id.  Children are not exempted from even these most restrictive\nmechanical restraints.  See generally, Exhibit 26 at 5, 9-12.\n14\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 15 of 51\nThe frequency of restraint use is exceptionally high at CHDC.  Exhibit 26 at\n5; Exhibit 27 at 5.  In April 2009 alone, CHDC staff utilized mechanical restraints\nmore than 1,300 times.  Id.  CHDC’s Chief of Psychology has indicated that about\n70-80 CHDC residents have treatment programs that include restraint use.  Exhibit\n26 at 5.  As many as six staff at once may be involved in applying restraints to a\nresident.  Id.  The actual rate of restraint use is likely much higher than reported,\nhowever, because CHDC does not track various devices that function as mechanical\nrestraints, such as fixed dining trays on wheelchairs, face guards, helmets, and\n“seat belts” on lounge chairs.  Id. at 5. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD\nIn determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction, the court must\nconsider “(1) the likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the presence or risk of\nirreparable harm; (3) the balancing of the harms of granting or denying an\ninjunction; and (4) the public’s interest.”  CDI Energy Services, Inc. v. West River\nPumps, Inc., 567 F.3d 398, 401-02 (8th Cir. 2009) (citing Dataphase Systems, Inc. v.\nCL Systems, Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981).  No single prong of the\nstandard is determinative of whether a preliminary injunction should be issued. \nDataphase at 113.  Furthermore, this standard applies in cases where, as here,\nsome of the relief sought involves compelling a party to take affirmative action. \nSee, e.g., Ferry-Morse Seed Co. v. Food Corn, Inc., 729 F.2d 589, 593 (8th Cir. 1984)\n(“where the status quo is a condition not of rest, but of action, and the condition of\n15\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 16 of 51\nrest .  .  . will cause irreparable harm, a mandatory preliminary injunction is\nproper.”).   \nIII.  ARGUMENT\nA. RESIDENTS OF CONWAY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT CENTER\nARE SUFFERING IRREPARABLE HARM.\nDeath and permanent injury caused by failure in medical care constitutes\nirreparable harm.  Henderson v. Bodine Aluminum, Inc. 70 F.3d 958, 961 (8th Cir.\n1995) (“[P]reliminary injunctions become easier to obtain as the plaintiff faces\nprogressively graver harm. . . .  It is hard to imagine a greater harm than losing a\nchance for potentially life-saving medical treatment.”); Rodde v. Bonta, 357 F.3d\n988, 993-94 (9th Cir. 2004) (upholding injunction to prevent “‘severe, irreparable\nharm’ as a result of ‘lack of access to preventive care’ and ‘medical complications . . .\nincreased risk of death, infection, organ failure, and loss of functional ability’”). \nThe inappropriate use of mechanical restraints causes irreparable harm. \nSee, e.g., National Ass’n of Psychiatric Health Systems v. Shalala, 120 F. Supp. 2d\n33, 45 (D.D.C. 2000) (“severe psychological and physical injuries . . . can and do\nresult from inappropriate use of restraints”).  Moreover, when “a constitutional\nright is involved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is\nnecessary.”  Charles Alan Wright, et. al. Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1\n(2d ed. 1995) (citing Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74 (1976); see also R.G. v.\nKoller, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1162 (D. Haw. 2006) (“‘[A]n alleged constitutional\n16\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 17 of 51\ninfringement will often alone constitute irreparable harm.’”) (internal citations\nomitted). \nLong term, unnecessary segregation causes irreparable harm.  See Exhibit 12\nat 22 (“Once a person has made the necessary lifestyle changes to enter an\ninstitution, he or she may find that it is more difficult to return home than it would\nhave been to remain in the community in the first place.”); Disability Advocates,\nInc. v. Paterson, 653 F. Supp.2d 184, 265 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (“[O]ne of the harms of\nlong-term institutionalization is that it instills ‘learned helplessness,’ making it\ndifficult for some who have been institutionalized to move to more independent\nsettings.”).     \nFor children who are unnecessarily segregated, the irreparable harm is\nparticularly acute.  See Exhibit 3 at 9 (“Segregating children in mostly adult\npopulations, separating them from public schools and depriving them of regular\ncontact with non-disabled peers, carries the potential for long-term\ninstitutionalization.”); Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 627-28 (1979) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The consequences of an erroneous\ncommitment decision are more tragic where children are involved . . . .  Childhood is\na particularly vulnerable time of life and children erroneously institutionalized\nduring their formative years may bear the scars for the rest of their lives.”). \nFor many children at CHDC, the harmful effects of prolonged, unnecessary\nsegregation are quite blatant.  For example, in numerous CHDC IPPs, treatment\n17\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 18 of 51\nteams justify the residents’ continued placement at CHDC by noting that the\nresident has lived at CHDC for “many years” and now considers CHDC “home.”  In\nfact, some of the current residents who were children in 2002-03, at the time of the\nDOJ’s CRIPA investigation, have current IPPs that contain this language, even\nthough their earlier IPPs did not expressly foreclose the possibility of an eventual\ntransition to a more integrated setting.  Compare 2002 IPP for a then-14-year-old\nresident (“CHDC is the least restrictive placement alternative for [the resident] at\nthis time”) (emphasis added) with 2009 IPP (the resident “has lived at [CHDC] for\nmany years.”);8 and 2002 IPP for a then-15-year-old resident (CHDC “is the least\nrestrictive placement alternative known at this time.”) (emphasis added) with 2009\nIPP (the resident “has lived at [CHDC] for many years.”);9 also compare 2002 IPP\nfor a then-17-year-old resident (“A projected discharge date could not be determined\ndue to [the resident’s] need for supervision, structure, special education and\nvocational training.”) with 2009 IPP (the resident “has lived at [CHDC] for several\nyears and considers this her home.”).10  Thus, for children who are unjustifiably\ninstitutionalized, the risk of irreparable harm begins the moment they step through\n8 See, Exhibit 28 (2002 IPP for then-14-year-old resident); Exhibit 29 (2009\nIPP for the same resident, CON-US-304907-304928).\n9 See Exhibit 30 (2002 IPP for then-15-year-old resident); Exhibit 31 (2009 IPP\nfor the same resident, CON-US-321981-321996).\n10 See Exhibit 32 (2002 IPP for then-17-year-old-resident); Exhibit 33 (2008 IPP\nfor the same resident, CON-US-321318-321337).\n18\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 19 of 51\nCHDC’s doors.  \nThe lack of appropriate special education services also causes irreparable\nharm.  See Monahan v. State of Neb., 645 F.2d 592, 598 (8th Cir. 1981) (plaintiff\nhad established a threat of irreparable harm sufficient to support a preliminary\ninjunction where the plaintiff student had been making “little progress” in her then-\ncurrent placement, and “the resulting harm to [plaintiff] was irreparable and . . .\npreliminary relief was appropriate to limit such harm.”); see also Nieves-Marquez v.\nPuerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 121-22 (1st. Cir. 2003) (finding irreparable harm where\nschool district failed to provide student with sign language interpreter because “‘at\nthe rate at which a child develops and changes, especially one at the onset of\nbiological adolescence . . . a few months can make a world of difference’ in harm to a\nchild’s educational development.”) (internal citation omitted)).    \nB. THE UNITED STATES IS LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON THE\nMERITS.\n1. CHDC Violates the ADA by Failing to Provide Services to\nResidents, Including Children, in the Most Integrated Setting\nAppropriate to Their Needs.\nThere are hundreds of CHDC residents who remain institutionalized in\nviolation of their rights under the ADA.  A disproportionate number of these are\nchildren, who comprised 50 - 80% of new admissions during each of the last five\nyears.  Exhibit 4 at 84: 21-25, 85:1-8; Exhibit 34 (CHDC Psychology Services\nMeeting Minutes, November 14, 2007, CON-US-0006371).  This rate of\n19\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 20 of 51\ninstitutionalization for children with disabilities is out of step not only with other\nstates but also with the State’s recognition of the need to divert children from\ninstitutions by providing more services.  Exhibit 8 at 3, 9; Exhibit 12 at 22.  The\nADA requires that the State provide services to qualified individuals with\ndisabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  42 U.S.C.\n§ 12132 (2008) (“[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any\nsuch entity”) and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (1998); see\nalso Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 607 (1999).   As the Supreme\nCourt explained in Olmstead, inappropriate institutionalization “perpetuates\nunwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of\nparticipating in community life,” and “severely diminishes the everyday life\nactivities of individuals.”  Id. at 600-01.\nIn construing the anti-discrimination provision contained within the ADA,\nthe Supreme Court held that “[u]njustified isolation . . . is properly regarded as \ndiscrimination based on disability.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597.  The Court applied\nthe integration mandate of the regulations implementing Title II of the ADA:  “‘A\npublic entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with\ndisabilities.’  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).”  Id. at 592.\n20\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 21 of 51\nA violation of the integration mandate is established if the institutionalized\nindividual is “qualified” for community placement – that is, that he or she can\n“handle or benefit from community settings” and does not oppose community\nplacement.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 601-603.  The state, however, may interpose a\ndefense that community placement would “entail a ‘fundamenta[l] alter[ation]’ of\n[its] services and programs.”  Id. at 603 (plurality opinion).  The Olmstead plurality\nexplained that a state can show a fundamental alteration by demonstrating that it\nhas “a comprehensive, effectively working plan for placing qualified persons with\nmental disabilities in less restrictive settings, and a waiting list that move[s] at a\nreasonable pace not controlled by the State's endeavors to keep its institutions fully\npopulated.”  Id. at 605-606.\nThe United States has a strong likelihood of succeeding on the merits of its\nADA claim.  First, evidence indicates that hundreds of CHDC residents can “handle\nor benefit from community settings.”  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. 601-602;  see also\nExhibit 3 at 8-9 (expert assessment that “50% or more [of CHDC residents] could\nlive in more integrated community settings.”).  The State itself has acknowledged\nthat it needs to do more to serve children with disabilities in the community.  See\nExhibit 12 at 22 (“More work also remains to serve school-aged children and those\ndesiring services outside the clinic setting.”).   Yet Arkansas does not have a\nworking plan for systematically transitioning institutionalized people to the\ncommunity, nor does it systematically identify or track the number and\n21\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 22 of 51\ncharacteristics of CHDC individuals who might be appropriate for community\nplacement.  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 605-06;  see also Exhibit 8 at 8 (“it is\nimpossible to develop a credible plan for transitioning institutionalized persons to\nthe community without first determining the number and characteristics of\nindividuals who potentially might be impacted.”); Messier v. Southbury Training\nSchool, 562 F. Supp.2d 294, 330 (D.Conn. 2008) (a system of placing\ninstitutionalized individuals into the community only as placements happen to\nbecome available violates the ADA because a State “cannot systematically develop\nresources appropriate to [the institution’s] residents’ placement needs.”).\nIn fact, from June 1, 2007 to September 30, 2009, only eight CHDC residents\nwere discharged to a more integrated setting, or approximately four people a year. \nExhibit 6.11  Of those eight discharged individuals, only three were children. \nExhibit 6; Exhibits 35-37; Exhibit 38 (Discharge Summary, April 16, 1991); Exhibit\n39 (DHHS Incident Report, CON-US-0020257-0020259); Exhibit 40 (Social Work\nSummary, October 23, 2008, CON-US, 0180264).  Furthermore, between fiscal\nyears 2004 and 2008, new admissions and re-admissions to the State’s Human\n11 Other individuals were released from CHDC during this time frame,\nhowever, these individuals were temporary residents, placed at CHDC for respite\ncare only.

Exhibit 8 at 9; Exhibit 4 at 84:21-25, 85:1-8; Exhibit 6.\nMoreover, as set forth above, the evidence demonstrates that hundreds of\nCHDC residents are appropriate for community-based treatment, notwithstanding\nCHDC’s failure to recognize this fact.  Although Olmstead itself involved two\nplaintiffs whose treating professionals had determined community placement was\nappropriate, the integration mandate is not limited to that narrow fact setting.  The\nregulation that creates the integration mandate says nothing about treating\nprofessionals; it simply requires services to be administered “in the most integrated\nsetting appropriate to the needs of” the individual.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).  The\nregulation does not in any way purport to limit the evidence on which a plaintiff\nmay rely in showing that a more integrated setting is appropriate.12  A requirement\nthat Olmstead plaintiffs come to court armed with the recommendation of a state's\n12 As the Supreme Court recognized in Olmstead, “[b]ecause the Department [of\nJustice] is the agency directed by Congress to issue regulations implementing Title\nII . . . its views warrant respect.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 597-98.  The Court\nemphasized that “the well-reasoned views of the agencies implementing a statute\nconstitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants\nmay properly resort for guidance.” Id.  (internal quotations omitted).  In Olmstead,\nthe Court relied on the Department of Justice’s position, as set forth in numerous\nbriefs in other segregation cases, that “undue institutionalization qualifies as\ndiscrimination ‘by reason of . . . disability’” under the ADA.  Id.  at 598 (quoting 42\nU.S.C. § 12132).  As set forth below, it is the Department of Justice’s “well-reasoned\nview[]” based on a “body of experience and informed judgment” about the ADA and\nits implementing regulations that the Defendants’ current community placement\npractices violate both.\n23\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 24 of 51\ntreating professional would “allow States to avoid the integration mandate by\nfailing to require professionals to make recommendations regarding the service\nneeds of institutionalized individuals with mental disabilities.”  Frederick L. v.\nDept. of Public Welfare, 157 F. Supp.2d. 509, 540 (E.D. Pa. 2001); see also\nDisability Advocates, 653 F. Supp.2d at 258 (“The court does not read Olmstead as\ncreating a requirement that a plaintiff alleging discrimination under the ADA must\npresent evidence that he or she has been assessed by a ‘treatment provider’ and\nfound eligible to be served in a more integrated setting.”); Joseph S. v. Hagan,\n561 F. Supp.2d 280, 291 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (“[I]t is not clear whether Olmstead even\nrequires a specific determination by any medical professional that an individual\nwith mental illness may receive services in a less restrictive setting or whether that\njust happened to be what occurred in Olmstead.”); cf. Messier, 562 F. Supp.2d at\n338 (finding that inadequate professional assessments “undermine[] the integration\nmandate of the ADA”). \nThe problem with reading such a requirement into Olmstead is particularly\nevident here:  CHDC staff are terribly ill-informed about what community-based\ntreatment looks like, what skills are required to live in the community, or even\nwhat it means to be living in an integrated setting, yet these same staff are the\n“treating professionals” assessing residents’ appropriateness for community\nplacement.  Indeed, instead of focusing on what supports the resident needs in order\nto live a meaningful life, CHDC’s IPPs focus on “skills such as tooth brushing,\n24\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 25 of 51\nmatching clothing and other routine skills that hold little interest for the person,\nand . . . are not needed for community placement.”  Exhibit 3 at 7.   The facility’s\nIPPs also tend to identify stabilization of behavior as a prerequisite to moving to a\nmore integrated setting, without adequately assessing whether environmental\nfactors related to being in an institutional setting are causing or contributing to\nthose behaviors.  Id.  To read Olmstead as requiring the State to provide treatment\nin a more integrated setting only when CHDC’s ill-informed staff members\nrecognize that it is appropriate to do so would be to ignore the ADA’s integration\nmandate altogether.  Frederick L., 157 F. Supp.2d at 540; see also Disability\nAdvocates, 653 F. Supp.2d at 258. \nThe evidence of CHDC staff’s lack of accurate knowledge about community-\nbased treatment is overwhelming.  The CHDC employee whom the State identified\nas most knowledgeable about community placement testified that she had no\nknowledge regarding what services are available in the community versus CHDC,\nnor did she know whether there are any daily living skills that cannot be taught in\nthe community.  Exhibit 4 at 132:15-19, 156:1-3 (“I’m not familiar with all the\nservices that providers are able to give.”).  Statements by the five team leaders\nlikewise reveal that none have any real understanding of what services are\navailable in the community or when a more integrated placement is appropriate for\nthe residents they serve.  Exhibit 3 at 5-6.  One team leader went so far as to say\n25\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 26 of 51\nthat teams do not recommend community placement because they believe CHDC is\n“the best.”  Id. at 6.\nStatements by other staff underscore the pervasive institutional bias and\nwidespread misinformation about community-based treatment at CHDC.  For\nexample, the United States’ expert found that “CHDC staff are of the opinion that\n“community programs do not provide what CHDC does for people.”  See Exhibit 3 at\n7 (describing a number of misunderstandings CHDC’s treatment teams have\nregarding skill prerequisites for community-based treatment eligibility).  In fact,\ncommunity providers in Arkansas are actually able to offer training on many of the\nskills that CHDC staff believe are prerequisites for being discharged from CHDC. \nId.  (discussing her visits to community providers and describing the variety of daily\nliving skills, such as meal preparation, laundry, taking care of clothing, and tooth\nbrushing, that are taught by these providers). \nUnder the circumstances set forth above, it is impossible to know whether or\nnot any CHDC resident or guardian would oppose moving to a more integrated\nsetting, given that none have been offered a meaningful opportunity to move to an\nappropriate community setting.  See 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A, p. 450 (1998)\n(“[P]ersons with disabilities must be provided the option of declining to accept a\nparticular accommodation.”) (emphasis added); see also Messier, 562 F. Supp.2d  at\n338 (stressing that “[t]he [ADA] regulations do not conceive of a resident’s option to\ndecline community placement as a right that is to be exercised before any\n26\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 27 of 51\nprofessional judgment has been brought to bear.  Rather, the regulations state that\n‘persons with disabilities must be provided the option of declining to accept a\nparticular accommodation.’”). \nFurthermore, CHDC does not routinely provide residents or their guardians\nwith even basic written information, such as brochures or pamphlets, about\ncommunity placement options for CHDC residents.  See Exhibit 20; Exhibit 4 at\n129:2-22.  Nor is there a routine, organized effort by CHDC to provide training\nabout community options to residents and guardians.   See Exhibit 3 at 6-7.  Unless\nthe guardian raises the issue, the topic of community placement is discussed, if at\nall, by an IDT member perfunctorily, even apologetically, informing the resident’s\nguardian that the ACS waiver services exist, without any discussion of what that\nmeans or how it can benefit the individual.  Id. at 4-5.  Thus, given the scant and\ninaccurate information that residents and guardians are provided about\ncommunity-based treatment, it is not surprising that more of them are not actively\npursuing a placement in the community.  Messier, 562 F. Supp.2d at 338 (“[a]n\nopportunity to discuss the possibility of community placement with guardians could\nmake a substantial difference in the number of referrals for placement.”). \nFinally, as other courts have recognized, Defendants cannot reasonably claim\nthat it would be a fundamental alteration of its programs and services if compelled\nto comply with the ADA.  See Pennsylvania Protection and Advocacy, Inc. v.\nPennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 381 (3rd Cir. 2005) (“Any\n27\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 28 of 51\ninterpretation of the fundamental alteration defense that would shield a state from\nliability in a particular case without requiring a commitment generally to comply\nwith the integration mandate would lead to this bizarre result.”); Townsend v.\nQuasim, 328 F.3d 511, 519 (9th Cir. 2003) (“[P]olicy choices that isolate the disabled\ncannot be upheld solely because offering integrated services would change the\nsegregated way in which existing services are provided.”); Long v. Benson, No. 08-\ncv-26 (RH/WCS), 2008 WL 4571904, at *2 (N.D.Fla. Oct. 14, 2008) (noting that the\nState “cannot deny the right [to an integrated setting] simply by refusing to\nacknowledge that the individual could receive appropriate care in the community. \nOtherwise the right would, or at least could, become wholly illusory.”); Messier,\n562 F. Supp.2d at 339 (“[H]aving failed to learn how many class members could or\nshould be placed in the community, the defendants failed to develop resources for\nplacing class members.”).\nAdditionally, Arkansas has no “comprehensive, effectively working plan” for\nplacing CHDC residents in “less restrictive settings.” Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 606;\nExhibit 8 at 4, 7.  Indeed, there is no evidence to suggest that outside of a “series of\nsmall bore initiatives,” Arkansas has made any commitment to complying with the\nTitle II of the ADA.  Id.  See Pennsylvania Protection and Advocacy, 402 F.3d at\n381-82 (a state agency asserting the fundamental alteration defense should “be\nprepared to make a commitment to action in a manner for which it can be held\naccountable by the courts” and should demonstrate that there is “ongoing progress\n28\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 29 of 51\ntoward community placement” under the plan); see also ARC of Washington State\nv. Braddock, 427 F.3d 615, 619 (9th Cir. 2005); Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.2d 1051,\n1067 (9th Cir. 2005) (finding that a state’s commitment to deinstitutionalization\nshould include a plan that is comprehensive, reasonable, and effective).  Instead,\nthe State is actively expanding its capacity to institutionalize children with\ndevelopmental disabilities.  Exhibits 16-18.  In light of the scant evidence of current\nefforts by the State to comply with the ADA’s integration mandate, it cannot claim\nthat the relief requested in the United States’ claim would constitute a fundamental\nalteration of its services and programs.  See Disability Advocates, Inc. v. Paterson,\n598 F. Supp.2d 289, 339 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (“A state’s efforts to comply with the\nintegration mandate . . . are . . . an important consideration in determining the\nextent to which the requested relief would be a permissible ‘reasonable modification’\nor an impermissible ‘fundamental alteration.’”) (citing Martin v. Taft, 222\nF.Supp.2d 940, 985-86 and n.42 (S.D. Ohio 2002)).\nFinally, the State has professed its commitment to integration and\ncompliance with the ADA’s integration mandate.  See Exhibit 12 at 21 (setting as a\npriority the facilitation of “transitions from institutional settings to the\ncommunity.”); Exhibit 41 (DDS Policy 1081: Mission Statement, CON-US-0000609) \n(stating Arkansas’ commitment to “[e]ngaging in statewide planning that ensures\noptimal and innovative growth of the Arkansas service system to meet the needs of\npersons [sic] with developmental disabilities and to assist such persons to achieve\n29\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 30 of 51\nindependence, productivity, and integration into the community.”).  If the State is\ncommitted to integrating individuals with disabilities into the community as\nrequired under the ADA, then it should not be a fundamental alteration of its\nservices and programs to act on that commitment.  See Messier, 562 F. Supp.2d at\n345 (finding the State’s fundamental alteration claim to be “entirely inconsistent\nwith its public commitment to further enhancing a system of community placement\nprogramming, which, it claims, was already robust in early 1999.”).\n2. Residents, Including Children, Are At Imminent Risk of Death and\nOther Grievous Harm Because of CHDC’s Medication Management\nPractices.\n The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the\nconstitutional rights of individuals with developmental disabilities.  Youngberg v.\nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982).  Specifically, “adequate . . . medical care” is one of\nthe “essentials” of care that a State must provide to institutionalized individuals\nwith development disabilities.  Id.; see Rennie v. Klein, 720 F.2d 266, 269 (3d Cir.\n1983).  Accordingly, a State violates the Due Process Clause when it provides\nmedical care that substantially departs from professional standards.  Rennie,\n720 F.2d at 269; see also Morgan v. Rabun, 128 F.3d 694, 697-98 (8th Cir. 1997).  In\npsychotropic medication cases, a factor to be considered when evaluating\nprofessional judgment is “whether and to what extent the patient will suffer\nharmful side effects.”  Rennie, 720 F.2d at 269.    \n30\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 31 of 51\nIn the last three years, CHDC residents have died, suffered possible\npermanent organ damage, or been at risk of hemorrhaging to death because of the\npsychotropic medications administered to them at CHDC.  Exhibit 7 at 4-5.  In each\nof these instances, CHDC clinicians failed to recognize or treat side effects, causing\nfatal and serious harm to the residents under their care.\n• In July 2007, a CHDC resident died after being hospitalized from a\ncommon, preventable side effect of Haldol.13  The Haldol was itself\nwrongly prescribed to mask the side effects of another medication of\nquestionable utility.  No CHDC clinician ever identified or\nappropriately treated the side effect that killed him.  Id. at 4.\n• In April 2008, CHDC clinicians administered toxic levels of Lithium to\nan eight-year-old child and delayed providing him appropriate care,\nrendering him comatose, causing possible permanent kidney damage,\nand nearly killing him.  Id. at 4-5.    \n• CHDC clinicians failed to recognize that a resident on Depakote was\nexperiencing low platelet levels, a common side effect of the\nmedication, such that, in early 2009, he required blood transfusions\nand was at risk of a fatal hemorrhage.  Id. at 5.\nCritically, there has been no systemic response at CHDC to address these\ndeficiencies in care and tragic outcomes.  As a result, the facility’s failure to timely\naddress serious medication side effects continues unabated, a substantial departure\nfrom accepted professional standards.\n13 The side effect, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (“NMS”), is a potentially\nfatal condition that requires removal from Haldol and active treatment to stops its\neffects.  Exhibit 7 at Attachment A, Case Examples, p. 10.  CHDC’s medical director\nadmitted “there [have] been problems in the past” with NMS.  Exhibit 25 at 83:16-\n19. \n31\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 32 of 51\nMany other CHDC residents are currently at risk of serious harm from side\neffects, but have not been identified as such by CHDC.  CHDC’s consulting\npsychiatrist admits that a “significant portion” of CHDC’s over 500 residents have\nreceived typical, or “first-generation,” antipsychotics for several years during their\nlives.  Exhibit 24 at 195:10-17, 196:9-10.  These medications, and other medication\nthat several current residents receive, can lead to tardive dyskinesia when\nadministered for extended periods of time.  Exhibit 22 at 3-4.  Yet, although the\nUnited States’ experts’ noted symptoms consistent with tardive dyskinesia in\nresidents’ records and observed such symptoms in residents themselves, only a few\nof these residents’ records indicated that they had been identified as warranting\nassessment to rule out tardive dyskinesia or had been diagnosed with this disease. \nId. at 6-7.  Moreover, the United States’ experts found indications of abnormal\norgan function tests and dangerous blood levels associated with side effects of\npsychotropic medication that CHDC clinicians do not detect or treat.  Id. at 5, 11,\n13; Exhibit 7 at 4.  Further, when CHDC clinicians do detect the presence of\nmedication side effects, they have responded by adding another – sometimes fatally\ndangerous – medication to suppress the side effects, rather than establishing\nwhether the first medication is even effective in treating the underlying condition or\nassessing whether less harmful alternatives are available.  Exhibit 7 at 5.  This is a\nsubstantial departure from accepted professional standards.  Id.   \n32\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 33 of 51\nDespite the immediate risks of harm from psychotropic medication, CHDC\nsubstantially departs from accepted professional standards by having no formalized\nsystem for the detection of side effects.  Treatment teams receive no side effects\ntraining or information other than a generic description of the side effects when a\nnew medication is prescribed.  Exhibit 42 (Email from Carl Reddig to Kathy Gill, et\nal., dated February 26, 2008).  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist, whose plans of\ntreatment are uniformly implemented by CHDC staff, does not meet with treatment\nteams to advise or educate them about a resident’s vulnerability to, or particular\nexperience with, the side effects of his or her medication.  Exhibit 7 at 5-6. \nMoreover, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist routinely fails to identify adverse drug\nreactions, possible medication side effects, or harmful drug interactions, in his\nconsultation notes.  Exhibit 22 at 6.14  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist himself\nadmitted, “I don’t typically document all the side effects that might happen.” \nExhibit 24 at 161:20-21.\nIn a substantial departure from accepted professional standards, CHDC’s\npsychiatrist sees individual residents so rarely that he is unable to timely detect\nand treat side effects of psychotropic medication.  On average, the psychiatrist\n14 In fact, there is no clinical oversight of the consulting psychiatrist or his\ntreatment decisions.  Further, there is no formal psychiatric peer review at CHDC\nto evaluate or provide feedback on the psychiatrist’s treatment decisions and\ndocumentation.  Exhibit 22 at 10.  When asked “who, in practical terms, supervises\n[his] work,” the psychiatrist stated that “Denise [Thomas] keeps up with what I’m\ndoing as much as anybody.”  Exhibit 24 at 55:22-56:1.  Dr. Thomas stated, however,\nthat she does not supervise any psychiatrists at CHDC.  Exhibit 25 at 19:14-15.\n33\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 34 of 51\nspends approximately 2.4 hours per year with each resident.  Exhibit 7 at 6.  This\nallocation of time is inadequate for those CHDC residents with an acute\ndeterioration in psychiatric status or significant psychiatric illness that has proven\nresistant to trials of psychotropic medication.  Id.  Such individuals require weekly\nor even bi-weekly follow-up consultations in order to manage the resident’s\nmedication regimen.  Id.  Also, because the consulting psychiatrist sees the vast\nmajority of residents in his office rather than on the units, his psychiatric note is\noften the only means of communication between the psychiatrist and the treatment\nteam.  Id.  However, as shown above, CHDC’s psychiatric notes do not include any\ninstructive information to the rest of the medical team about known side effects\nassociated with specific psychotropic medications.  Id. at 5-6. \nCHDC residents are further exposed to medication side effects when they are\nadministered psychotropic medication to control behaviors caused by\n“environmental” or “situational” factors.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist admits\nthat he prescribes psychotropic medications to residents to control their response to\nthe chaotic environment in which they are placed.  See Exhibit 24 at 143:6-25;\n144:1-14; Exhibit 7 at 7-8.  Subjecting individuals to psychotropic medication on an\nongoing basis to control their response to the environment in which they are placed\nis a gross violation of generally accepted professional standards.  Exhibit 7 at 7. \nThis practice also exacerbates the harms associated with CHDC’s failure to comply\nwith its obligation under the ADA.\n34\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 35 of 51\n3. CHDC’s Psychiatric Treatment of Children Violates Generally\nAccepted Professional Standards and Places CHDC Children at\nImminent Risk of Harm and Death\nIn 2008, CHDC administered toxic levels of Lithium to an eight-year-old\nresident, placing him in a near-fatal coma and causing him possible permanent\norgan damage.  Exhibit 7 at 4-5.  Despite this incident, as well as the fact that\nCHDC clinicians consider the children admitted to the facility to have complex\nmental health issues, Exhibit 24 at 38:14-21, and the fact that 80% of these\nchildren receive psychotropic medication, Exhibit 23, their psychiatric care is\nprovided by a person with no formal education or training in child psychiatry. \nExhibit 24 at 33:16-18; 34:10-12.\nThis is a substantial departure from accepted professional standards.  The\nAmerican Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) Policy Statements\nregarding Criteria for Clinical Privileges for Physician Members of Medical Staffs\nspecifically states:\nFor patients under 14 years of age, a qualified psychiatrist is a child\nand adolescent psychiatrist who is board certified in child and\nadolescent psychiatry or a psychiatrist who in addition to general\npsychiatry training has successfully completed a training program in\nchild and adolescent psychiatry accredited by the Accreditation\nCouncil on Graduate Medical Education.\nFor patients 14-17 years of age or older, a qualified psychiatrist is a\nchild and adolescent psychiatrist as noted above or general\npsychiatrist who has documented sufficient, specialized training and\nexperience in working with adolescents and their families on an\ninpatient treatment program, and has demonstrated competence to\nexamine and treat adolescents comprehensively.\n35\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 36 of 51\nExhibit 22 at 7-8.\nThe ongoing treatment of institutionalized children by a psychiatrist who has\nno formal training or accreditation in child and adolescent psychiatry substantially\ndeparts from generally accepted professional standards.  Exhibit 7 at 6-7; Exhibit\n22 at 7.  Psychiatric treatment of children with complex mental health needs that is\nadministered by persons unqualified to render it exposes those children to risk of\nharm (Exhibit 7 at 6), threatening their “liberty interest in safety,” and depriving\nthem of the adequate medical care to which they are entitled.  Youngberg, 457 U.S.\nat 318-324.\n4. CHDC Unreasonably Restrains Residents in Violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment.\nThe right of individuals with developmental disabilities to be free from\nunreasonable restraints has long been recognized under federal law.  Youngberg,\n457 U.S. at 316; see Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 673 F. Supp. 828, 850-851 (N.D. Texas\n1987) (use of mechanical restraints and aversive techniques barred as improper\npunishment); Thomas S. by Brooks v. Flaherty, 699 F.Supp. 1178, 1200-1201 (W.D.\nN.C. 1988), aff'd, 902 F.2d 250 (4th Cir. 1990) (due process protection includes\nfreedom from undue bodily restraint).  “Liberty from bodily restraint always has\nbeen recognized as the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from\n36\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 37 of 51\narbitrary governmental action.”  Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1,\n18 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). \nRestraints should only be used when a patient is a danger to himself or to\nothers.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324 (“[The State] may not restrain residents\nexcept when and to the extent professional judgment deems this necessary to assure\nsuch safety or to provide needed training.”); Society for Good Will to Retarded\nChildren, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1245 (2d Cir. 1984) (holding that patients\nof mental health institutions have a right to freedom from undue bodily restraint);\nThomas S., 699 F. Supp. at 1189 (“It is a substantial departure from professional\nstandards to rely routinely on seclusion and restraint rather than systematic\nbehavior techniques such as social reinforcement to control aggressive behavior.”). \n“Seclusion and restraint should only be used as a last resort.”  Thomas S.,\n699 F. Supp. at 1189. \nCHDC’s psychology and behavioral management program lacks basic\nrequirements to safeguard against the inappropriate use of mechanical restraints\nand thus violates the Constitution and federal regulations.  Notably, federal\nregulations emphasize that restraints should only be used if “necessary,” and in the\ncontext of a comprehensive “active treatment” program.    See, 42 C.F.R.\n§ 483.420(a)(6); 42 C.F.R. § 483.450(b) (3).  Federal regulations expressly prohibit\nthe use of restraints as a substitute for such “active treatment.”   See 42 C.F.R.\n§ 483.450(b) (3).  “Active treatment” requires much more than a modicum of\n37\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 38 of 51\nprofessional review or thought.  Rather, a state must ensure that its treatment for\npeople with developmental disabilities:\n... includes aggressive, consistent implementation of a program of\nspecialized and generic training, treatment, health services and\nrelated services described in this subpart, that is directed toward - (I)\nThe acquisition of the behaviors necessary for the client to function\nwith as much self determination and independence as possible; and (ii)\nThe prevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current optimal\nfunctional status. \n42 C.F.R. § 483.440 (a) (emphasis added).  Yet CHDC’s psychology program does not\ninclude even the basic components of a credible clinical treatment process, let alone\nserve as “active treatment.”  \nAt CHDC, several factors demonstrate how state psychologists substantially\ndepart from generally accepted professional standards in their everyday practice,\nand instead rely on restraints in lieu of appropriate treatment.  First, major\ncomponents of CHDC's treatment program, including specific treatment approaches\nand underlying philosophies, are not based on any type of demonstrably reliable\nmodel.  CHDC’s Chief of Psychology acknowledges that forms, assessment\ninstruments, interventions and other CHDC practices governing treatment and\nrestraint are idiosyncratic to CHDC.  Exhibit 43 (Deposition of Carl Reddig) at\n91:11 - 93:1.  Nor are they founded on any type of evidence-based, clinically\ndefensible methodology.  Exhibit 26 at 6-7; Exhibit 27 at 6-7.  Even basic\ninformation, such as a resident’s level of intellectual functioning, is not properly\n38\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 39 of 51\nassessed.  Exhibit 26 at 7.  For instance, Dr. Matson, the United States’ expert\nconsultant, identified at least 40 individuals whose intellectual levels were\nincorrectly identified based on CHDC’s own documentation.  Id.  Trying to treat\nresidents with complex psychological conditions without utilizing demonstrably\nreliable instruments and techniques is indefensible in terms of professional and\nlegal standards.   \nSecond, the staff's failure to properly track and limit the use of certain types\nof restraint, such as helmets and fixed dining trays on wheelchairs, itself reflects an\nunawareness of basic clinical standards.   Id. at 5.  Using restraints such as the\npapoose board in response to behaviors is problematic enough, but CHDC staff\nfurther depart from generally accepted professional standards by using an array of\nother restraints without even monitoring them as restraints.  Id.\nThird, the ostensible diagnoses or clinical justifications for using restraints in\nindividual cases are frequently specious.  Dr. Matson found nearly thirty cases\nwhere the etiology of mental health conditions could not be clinically justified.  Id.\nat 8.\nFourth, CHDC's ability to evaluate the effectiveness of the weak treatment\nplans currently used at the facility is inherently poor, because written policies and\ntraining programs do not ensure that staff actually implement those plans.  Id. at \n7-9; Exhibit 27 at 5-8.  For instance, CHDC does not have fidelity measures to\nensure that staff implement treatment plans as written; nor does CHDC conduct\n39\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 40 of 51\ncompetency training to ensure that staff understand the plans that they are\nimplementing.  Exhibit 26 at 8-9; Exhibit 27 at 6-7.  Individuals are being\nrestrained because of their behavioral response to the environmental conditions in\nwhich they are placed, even when CHDC staff have identified environmental\nconditions as triggers for those behaviors.  Exhibit 27 at 7.  This results from both\nCHDC’s failure to provide appropriate behavioral interventions and from the\nenvironment in which these individuals are placed.  Id.  \nCHDC’s failure to understand how environmental factors trigger uses of\nrestraints, id., is of particular concern, given that treatment teams inappropriately\nidentify individuals’ need to “stabilize behavior” as a prerequisite for discharge to a\nmore integrated setting.  Exhibit 3 at 7-8.   Thus, in some cases, an individual who\nis inappropriately segregated at CHDC may be subjected to severe forms of\nrestraints, such as papoose boards, to control behaviors that he may not even\nexhibit if in the community.  Id.\nFinally, administrative safeguards to limit the misuse of restraints by staff\nare poorly enforced.  State policies require debriefing after restraint use, release\nfrom restraints to allow positive programming, and staff compliance with restraint\nrelease criteria, but in practice, CHDC does not actually comply with any of these\npolicies.  Exhibit 27 at 5-6.  Further, when our consultants evaluated mechanical\nrestraint use, they found cases where release criteria appeared to be unreasonable\nor applied haphazardly.  Exhibit 26 at 9-12, Exhibit 27 at 6, 13-14.  Utilizing\n40\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 41 of 51\nrestraint without these types of safeguards and procedures is another example of\nhow CHDC staff substantially depart from generally accepted professional\nstandards. \nExamples of how staff misuse restraints have been identified throughout the\ncourse of the United States’ investigation.  Exhibit 26 at 9-12; Exhibit 27 at 2, 4,   \n8-14.  CHDC staff repeatedly write restraint programs where the criteria for use of,\nand release from, restraints are facially vague, arbitrary, or inappropriate.   See\nExhibit 26 at 9-12.  For instance, one 16-year-old boy may be placed in a papoose\nboard “depending on the judgment of the staff regarding the extensity of the\nbehavior and its potential for harm.”   Id. at 10.  In another example, staff may\nplace a 10-year-old boy in a papoose board until he is “relatively quiet and still for 5\nminutes.”  Id. at 9.  In yet another case, staff may use a papoose board on a 14-year-\nold girl until she is apologetic for her behavior.  Id. at 11.  Federal regulations allow\nrestraints only when necessary and when other reasonable treatment measures\nhave failed.  See 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.420 (a)(6), 483.440(a); 483.450(b)(3).   This is not\nthe case at CHDC, and these examples illustrate the deeply flawed judgment of\nCHDC professionals when utilizing restraints. \nThe restraint practices at CHDC violate such basic tenets of clinical practice\nthat the United States is likely to prevail.  Globally, every use of restraints at\nCHDC is problematic because, as set forth above, CHDC staff do not understand, or\nchoose not to implement, the basic components of a behavioral management\n41\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 42 of 51\nprogram.  Without first attempting to manage behaviors in a clinically appropriate\nmanner, the use of restraints cannot be presumed appropriate or necessary.   Cf.,\n42 C.F.R. §§ 483.420 (a)(6), 483.440(a); 483.450(b)(3).  Indeed, the better\npresumption may be that given contemporary standards, widespread use of\nmechanical restraints is inherently unreasonable.  In fact, many other facilities\nacross the country now “use little or no mechanical restraints” at all.  See Exhibit\n26 at 5 (emphasis added), Exhibit 27 at 5.\nCHDC restraint practices substantially depart from generally accepted\nprofessional standards and thus violate the standard set in Youngberg.  A contrary\nconclusion would effectively allow CHDC to utilize some of the most restrictive\ndevices imaginable, even on children, in disregard of federal law and policy that\nstrongly favors treatment of individuals in the most integrated setting and with far\nless restrictive measures whenever possible. \nC. THE BALANCE OF HARMS FAVORS GRANTING THE\nINJUNCTION\nAs set forth in Section III.A above, the harm that CHDC residents face due to\ninappropriate placement, medication mismanagement, and excessive and\ninappropriate use of restraints is grave, irreversible, and, at times, lethal.  In\ncontrast, the narrow measures of relief requested in this Motion cause no significant\nharm to Defendants.  To remedy the harm caused by CHDC’s constitutional\nviolations, CDHC must simply invest the minimum resources and administrative\n42\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 43 of 51\nsupport necessary to protect the lives and safety of its residents.  “While requiring\ndefendants to adopt polices [sic], procedures, and training so as to provide . . . a\nreasonably safe environment . . . may impose some administrative inconvenience,\nany burden on the defendants is minimal when viewed in light of defendants’ legal\nresponsibility to provide a safe environment.”  R.G. v. Koller, 415 F. Supp. 2d\n11129, 1162 (D.Haw. 2006).\nMoreover, the narrow ADA relief requested in this Motion focuses directly on\nchildren – the class of individuals most at risk of irreparable harm from\ninappropriate institutionalization and from the unconstitutional conditions at\nCHDC.  And that relief furthers the State’s professed goal of “ensur[ing] optimal\nand innovative growth of the Arkansas service system to meet the needs of persons\nwith developmental disabilities and to assist such persons to achieve independence,\nproductivity, and integration into the community.”  Exhibit 41.  See also Exhibit 12\nat 21 (setting as a “Priority Recommendation” to “[f]acilitate transitions from \ninstitutional settings to the community”).  It would be unreasonable for the State to\nargue that it will be harmed by complying with its stated goals.\nD. THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS SERVED BY GRANTING THE\nINJUNCTION.\nLastly, this Court must consider whether granting the injunction is in the\ninterests of the public.  Dataphase, 640 F.2d at 114.  This factor unquestionably\nweighs in favor of the preliminary injunction, because “there is the highest public\n43\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 44 of 51\ninterest in the due observance of all the constitutional guarantees.”  United States\nv. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 27 (1960).   \nEnsuring that citizens receive adequate medical and mental health care is in\nthe public interest.  Jaffe v. Redmond, 518 U.S. 1, 11 (1996) (“The mental health of\nour citizenry, no less than its physical health, is a public good of transcendent\nimportance.”); Arkansas Medical Society v. Reynolds, 834 F. Supp. 1097, 1102,\n1103-04 (E.D. Ark. 1992) (“‘[I]n view of the public interest involved, medical care to\npatients, the Court feels that the weight of discretion is on the side of granting the\nmotion [for preliminary injunction].’”) (internal citation omitted).  \nProtecting citizens against undue restraint is likewise in the public interest. \nSee, e.g., National Ass’n of Psychiatric Health Systems v. Shalala, 120 F. Supp. 2d\n33, 45 (D.D.C. 2000) (finding that the public interest supported upholding a rule\nthat required medical review of restraints after one hour because “restraints and\nseclusion are dangerous interventions” and “severe psychological and physical\ninjuries” result from the inappropriate use of restraints”).   \nFinally, there is a strong public interest in eliminating the harm that attends\nunnecessary and inappropriate isolation.  As noted in Olmstead, the unjustified\nsegregation of persons with disabilities perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that\nthey are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.  Olmstead,\n527 U.S. at 600.  Moreover, it severely diminishes individuals’ ability to enjoy\nactivities of daily life, such as family relations, social contacts, work options,\n44\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 45 of 51\neconomic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.  Id. at\n601; see also Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-336,\n1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. (104 Stat. 327) 445, 473. (“[T]he long-range effects of integration\nwill benefit society as a whole.”).  Thus, the public interest strongly supports\ntargeting CHDC’s most immediate life-threatening conditions and providing its\nyoungest and most vulnerable residents with services in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to their needs.\nIV.  RELIEF REQUESTED\nOnce admitted to CHDC, a child’s chances of ever living in the community\nagain immediately - and irreparably - decrease.  Accordingly, the United States\nrequests narrow and immediate relief designed to protect children’s rights to live in\nthe least restrictive setting and to protect all CHDC residents from further exposure\nto risk of death and injury as a result of unconstitutional medication management\nand restraint practices.\nThe United States requests that the Court issue an order providing\nimmediate relief to:  \na) Cease all admissions of school-aged children to CHDC; \nb) Prohibit the treatment of CHDC children with psychotropic\nmedications prescribed by a psychiatrist not accredited in child and\nadolescent psychiatry and appoint an independent psychiatric\nconsultant to perform a medication side effect assessment of each\n45\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 46 of 51\nCHDC resident who is receiving or has received psychotropic\nmedications; and\nc) Prohibit the use at CHDC of the most severe, outdated forms of\nmechanical restraints. \nThis immediate relief is necessary.  The State should be prevented from\nincreasing the number of children currently at risk of the negative effects of\nunnecessary institutionalization, as well as the dangerous conditions at CHDC. \nAdditionally, children at CHDC are exposed to long-term and potentially fatal side\neffects from dangerous treatment with psychotropic medications by a psychiatrist\nwho has no formal training or accreditation in child and adolescent psychiatry. \nTherefore, at a minimum, the State should also be required to retain the services of\na certified child psychiatrist at CHDC, in accordance with generally accepted\nprofessional standards.  Finally, the United States urges that the Court clearly and\nunequivocally prohibit the State from using papoose boards, restraint chairs,\nstraitjackets, and similar outdated, extreme forms of behavioral restraints on\nchildren.  Such restraints are widely disfavored nationwide and not in accordance\nwith generally accepted professional standards.\nSeparately, within 90 days of the Court’s order, all other forms of restraint\nshould be reviewed, and revised as appropriate, by an independent team of doctoral-\nlevel behavioral clinicians with actual training and experience in contemporary,\nevidence-based behavioral management programs.\n46\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 47 of 51\nThe immediate steps described above will stop the most emergent harm.  It\nwould also be appropriate for the Court to go further, however, as additional relief\nwould mitigate the ongoing irreparable harm caused by the inappropriate,\ncontinued institutionalization of children already admitted to CHDC.  Every day\nthat a child spends at CHDC causes irreparable harm to that child’s future ability\nto live successfully in the community and exposes that child to the dangerous\nconditions at CHDC.  The Defendants’ failure to properly assess each individual’s\ncapacity to live in a more integrated setting promotes the assumption - to CHDC\nresidents, their families and the community - that these children are incapable or,\nworse, unworthy, of participating in community life.  The State’s continued\nexpansion of its capacity for institutionalizing children signals clearly that it lacks\nany genuine commitment to avoiding unnecessary institutionalization. \nAccordingly, the United States asks the Court to order a prompt and impartial\nassessment of any children at CHDC by a qualified independent expert, and prompt\nimplementation of procedures to facilitate their placement, as appropriate, in a safe,\ncommunity setting that provides the comprehensive services these children need in\nthe most integrated environment.  \nWhile this relief would not be as streamlined as the other steps described\nabove, it is appropriate even at this preliminary stage.  In order to facilitate proper\nassessment and placement, in accordance with federal law, within 30 days of the\nCourt’s Order, the Parties should jointly choose an individual to be appointed as the\n47\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 48 of 51\nCommunity Placement Evaluator.  The Community Placement Evaluator should be\nan independent professional who has substantial experience in expanding\ncommunity services for children with developmental disabilities and in moving\nchildren with developmental disabilities out of institutional placements.  If the\nParties are unable to agree on the individual, they should petition the Court to\nmake the selection.  The State should bear the costs of the Community Placement\nEvaluator.\nWithin 90 days of the Court’s Order, the Community Placement Evaluator\nshould assess all the school-aged children at CHDC, including children who have\nbeen residing at CHDC for more than 30 days on a “respite” or “emergency” basis,\nwho are not on the community placement list or “Olmstead waiting list.”  This\nassessment should identify whether the child is appropriate for community\nplacement and what, if any, barriers to community placement exist for that\nindividual. \nWithin 30 days of this assessment, the State, under the supervision of the\nCommunity Placement Evaluator, should develop and promptly implement written\ntransition plans for each child that identify both the supports and services\nnecessary to facilitate prompt, safe, and sustainable placement in an appropriate\nsetting and the strategies to overcome placement barriers.\nThe United States respectfully requests that the Court order the foregoing\nrelief measures, along with whatever additional relief the Court deems necessary.\n48\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH     Document 43      Filed 03/09/2010     Page 49 of 51\nV.

CONCLUSION ............................................................................................................. 310 \n \niv \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 6 of 318\nThe Conway Human Development Center (“CHDC”) is an institution geared toward the \nlife-long institutionalization of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  \nDefendants segregate people in CHDC and restrict their ability to fully and independently \nparticipate in life in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 12101-12213.  Moreover, Defendants expose people confined in CHDC to harmful, \ndangerous conditions, including preventable injuries and death, unnecessary and prolonged \nbodily restraint, and substandard care and treatment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \nAdditionally, Defendants deny children in CHDC adequate special education services in \nviolation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1482.  \nAs a result, people in CHDC suffer serious harm and death; children are deprived of the \neducation services to which they are entitled; and individuals are denied any real opportunity to \never leave CHDC. \nDefendants Deny People Confined to CHDC a Meaningful Opportunity \nTo Live in the Community in Violation of the ADA \n \nThe ADA mandates that Defendants offer services to people with disabilities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs.  See generally Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 \n(1999).  It is impossible to determine what type of setting is appropriate without conducting an \nobjective, reasonable assessment.  CHDC fails to even attempt to assess people confined there \nand identify the specific services necessary to meet their needs unless a guardian affirmatively \nrequests or expresses interest in community placement.  Even when CHDC conducts an \nassessment, staff members are too ill-informed about what community services are available in \nArkansas, and what skills an individual needs to be eligible for a community program, to provide \nan independent, reasonable determination about the most integrated setting appropriate for an \n1 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 7 of 318\nindividual.  CHDC treatment plans demonstrate staff members’ lack of knowledge about \ncommunity programs and reveal CHDC’s discriminatory bias in favor of continued \ninstitutionalization. \nBoth people in the facility and their guardians are ill-served by CHDC’s failure to \nprovide objective, reasonable assessments.  Guardians, deprived of the knowledge that a \nplacement tailored to the individual needs and strengths of their loved ones may exist, naturally \nare inclined to maintain the status quo of continued institutionalization.  Defendants’ failure to \nprovide objective, reasonable assessments perpetuates this discriminatory system and dooms \npeople to lifelong confinement at CHDC. \nDefendants Expose People Confined to CHDC to Serious and Preventable  \nHarm in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n \n  Defendants also routinely expose people confined to CHDC to serious, preventable harms \nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  See generally Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982).  At CHDC, there are disturbing patterns of staff abuse/neglect, \npreventable self-injurious behaviors, inappropriate and excessive use of restraints, and serious \ninjuries such as fractures and lacerations from falls and other preventable incidents.   Many of the \nharmful conditions are the by-products of institutionalization and could be prevented with \nadequate information and planning.  Aspiration pneumonias, choking, bone fractures, and skin \npressure ulcers from inadequate physical and nutritional supports, and injuries from unaddressed \nchallenging behaviors, are all highly preventable with timely assessments of individuals that \ndrive appropriate interventions and ongoing monitoring.  CHDC’s failure to engage in \nmeaningful, individualized assessments and monitor their implementation results in serious \ninjuries and other harm.    \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 8 of 318\nCHDC also excessively relies on physical restraints, and uses archaic forms of restraint, \nas the first response to behavior rather than as a last resort, in violation of the Constitution.  Little \nis done to determine the cause of the behaviors that purportedly justify the restraint, nor is an \neffort made to determine what behavioral interventions might be appropriate, whether staff are \nimplementing behavioral interventions correctly, or whether a change in behavioral interventions \nwould render restraint unnecessary.  Once again, Defendants’ failure to properly assess the \npsychological needs of individuals with challenging behaviors, and provide treatment \naccordingly, exposes people to ineffective behavioral interventions and prolonged, harmful, and \nunnecessary bodily restraint in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \nLikewise, CHDC’s failure to properly prescribe and monitor the side effects of \npsychotropic medications causes significant, even fatal, harm.  Although CHDC administers \npowerful psychotropic medications to hundreds of people confined to CHDC, the facility lacks a \ncoherent system for identifying and assessing side effects.   \nCHDC’s assessments of psychiatric illnesses are glaringly deficient.  Far too often, the \nprescription of powerful medications is based solely on the recommendation of unqualified staff \nwithout an appropriate psychiatric diagnosis.  People in CHDC are often needlessly exposed to \nserious harm caused by unmonitored psychotropic medication side effects, deficient assessments \nof medication efficacy, untimely psychiatric assessments and follow up care, and inadequate \noversight of CHDC’s untrained, over-stretched psychiatrist – who inappropriately delegates \ncritical determinations to unqualified, nonmedical, staff.  CHDC also exposes people to serious \nharm from inappropriate use of medication to suppress other medication’s side effects, to \nrespond to non-psychiatric environmental behaviors, and to chemically restrain individuals.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 9 of 318\nCHDC’s general medical services rely on untrained direct care staff to identify health \nproblems.  CHDC’s medical staff is unqualified and poorly supervised.  This substandard \nmedical care system explains why people confined to CHDC die an average of 25 years earlier \nthan residents at comparable state facilities.   \nPeople in CHDC are also exposed to preventable harm and death from Defendants’ \nfailure to adequately manage physical and nutritional needs in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Many people in CHDC die of preventable aspiration pneumonia or other \nrespiratory-related causes.  Staff implementing physical and nutritional management plans, \nnecessary to prevent choking and aspiration, do not monitor or provide support consistent with \nthe level of risk.  Consequently, Defendants needlessly expose individuals who are at high risk of \naspiration and choking to severe harm, including death.  Similarly, CHDC fails to properly \nreassess risk and implement physical management positioning plans.   Far too often, people in \nCHDC suffer from repeated bone fractures or skin pressure sores.  \nDefendants Deny CHDC Children Their Right  \nto Education in Violation of the IDEA \n \n  Children confined to CHDC are entitled, under the IDEA, to an education in the least \nrestrictive environment and to related services that enable them to benefit from that education.  \nCHDC fails to meet this mandate.  Defendants violate the IDEA’s requirement of a free and \nappropriate public education (“FAPE”) by failing to provide special education, related and \ntransition services reasonably calculated to enable students to receive educational benefits.  \nSpecifically, Defendants fail to provide students an education in the least restrictive \nenvironment; fail to provide adequate instructional time, required related services (e.g., \ncommunication, audiology, and psychology services), and adequate transition planning; fail to \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 10 of 318\ntarget skill development to allow progress toward more integrated settings; and employ untrained \nand unsupervised education staff.  Indeed, even Arkansas’s own Department of Education \nconcluded that CHDC’s education services violate the IDEA. \nDefendants also fail to comply with the IDEA’s procedural requirements.  For example, \nDefendants fail to offer CHDC students a full continuum of educational placements in violation \nof the IDEA.  Additionally, neither a Local Education Agency (“LEA”) representative nor a \nregular education teacher routinely attend individualized education plan (“IEP”) meetings; IEPs \ndo not contain mandatory appropriate, measurable goals and objectives; IEP teams fail to \nconsider IDEA-required factors for developing IEPs; CHDC students do not receive regular or \nalternate statewide or districtwide assessments; and CHDC routinely fails to invite agency \nrepresentatives to assist students in transitioning to postsecondary services, all of which are \nrequired under the IDEA.   \n*       *       * \nThe people confined to CHDC range in age from 7 to 70, and have diverse diagnoses, \ninterests, capacities, and needs.  Defendants cannot ensure their safety, nor adequately protect \ntheir rights, without meaningfully assessing how to do so.  Defendants’ failure to conduct \nindividualized, comprehensive, independent assessments, and provide care and services \naccordingly, subjects individuals to unnecessary and serious risk of harm, results in substandard \nmedical care, denies children required education services, and preserves a discriminatory, \ninstitutionally-biased, and unlawful system in violation of the Constitution and federal law.\n5 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 11 of 318\nTABLE OF CONTENTS – AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \nI.

Richardson Tr. \n533:3-15; US Ex. 229 (CHDC Statistical Summary).  The population of the CHDC facility has \nremained static during the last few years.  J.C. Green Tr. 763:21-764:2.  CHDC is licensed to \nserve 539 individuals.  US Ex. 229.   \n2.  CHDC is an institution within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  Answer and Affirmative \nDefenses  # 14 [Dkt. 4]. \n3.  CHDC is the oldest and largest of Arkansas’s six human development centers (“HDCs”).  \nJ.C. Green Tr. 764:3-9.  It is located on 409 acres of land bordering Interstate 40 in Conway, \nArkansas.  Defendants’ Response to Plaintiff’s Statement of Undisputed Facts at 2 [Dkt. 104]. \nCHDC was originally called the Arkansas Children’s Colony, and is the only Arkansas HDC \nhousing children.  J.C. Green Tr. 764:7-765:1.   \n4.  The State, through the Division of Developmental Disabilities (“DDS”) of the Arkansas \nDepartment of Human Services (“DHS”), coordinates services for individuals with intellectual \nand developmental disabilities and provides congregate services for individuals at the HDCs, \nincluding CHDC.

He also oversees the \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 14 of 318\nadministration of Arkansas’s Alternative Community Services (“ACS”) waiver program.  J.C. \nGreen Tr. 749:3-16; Cromer Tr. 1411:22-1412:5. \n6.  Calvin Price is the superintendent of CHDC.  He oversees all administrative operations at \nCHDC, including – but not limited to – staffing decisions, budgetary matters, performance \nreviews, and supervision of team leaders, department heads, and some support staff.  Price Tr. \n1656:3-12, 6864:14-25.  He makes the final decision on all admissions to and discharges from \nCHDC, defines how CHDC reviews clients’ restraint use and incident investigations, serves as \nCHDC’s official representative to state agencies and the community, and administratively \nreviews all safety plans, positive behavior support plans, and incident investigations.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213, requires \nDefendants to offer services to individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to their needs.  See generally Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999).  Defendants are \ndiscriminating against individuals at CHDC by failing to ensure that they are served in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs, in violation of the ADA.  Id. at 602.  \n12.  Specifically, CHDC treatment professionals fail to make objective, reasonable \nassessments based on the individuals’ needs and services necessary to meet those needs, of \nwhether individuals at CHDC could be served in a more integrated setting.  Instead, CHDC \nsimply determines all CHDC residents are not appropriate for placement in a more integrated \nsetting, unless and until the family seeks community placement.  As a result, residents and their \nguardians are deprived of a treating professional’s independent, individualized recommendation \nabout whether the individual could handle or benefit from community placement.  Without the \nbenefit of an independent, reasonable assessment based on the individual’s needs, including the \nopportunity to meaningfully discuss what services and supports the individual would receive in \nthe community, guardians are inclined to maintain the status quo of continued institutionalization \nand segregation even when a more integrated setting may be available and appropriate for the \nindividual.  Moreover, without information about the specific needs of CHDC’s population, \nproviders of community services are unable to develop capacity and tailor the services they \nprovide to the needs of those currently institutionalized.  In this way, CHDC’s failure to provide \nobjective, reasonable assessments preserves CHDC’s archaic and discriminatory system for \nproviding services to individuals with developmental disabilities, and deprives individuals of \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 16 of 318\n“equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency,” \nin violation of the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2). \n13.  The evidence of CHDC’s failure to provide objective, reasonable assessments, and the \nresulting inability of guardians to meaningfully make placement decisions, is substantial.  For \nexample, CHDC treatment teams and guardians of residents testified that teams do not discuss or \npursue specific placement options unless the family first requests such action.  Tellingly, the only \nfour individuals that CHDC treatment teams determined could be served in a more integrated \nsetting were the very four individuals whose guardians had requested community placement.       \n14.  Moreover, CHDC treating professionals do not have the information and knowledge \nnecessary to make objective, reasonable assessments about whether individuals could be served \nin more integrated settings.  CHDC staff members are so lacking in even the most basic \nunderstanding of the services available in the community that they are incapable of conducting \nreasonable assessments.  Treatment team leaders admit they have very little, if any, knowledge \nabout how individuals with developmental disabilities are served in the community or the \nbenefits of community care, and several of the team leaders have never even visited a community \nplacement.  Their lack of knowledge is evidenced in CHDC transition plans that repeatedly list \nthe same barriers to placement in a more integrated setting, such as skills acquisition, behavioral \nimprovement, and medical needs, when, in fact, community programs that currently exist in \nArkansas provide all of these services.  CHDC treatment plans are generic, boilerplate, and \nreveal CHDC’s discriminatory bias toward continued institutionalization.  Few residents are ever \ndischarged from CHDC.  In fact, more people die at CHDC than get discharged. \n15.  The evidence of the impact of CHDC treatment teams’ failure to make objective, \nreasonable assessments of the most integrated setting appropriate based on individuals’ needs is \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 17 of 318\nalso significant.  Guardians are not provided the information necessary to meaningfully consider \na more integrated setting.  Staff and guardians consistently describe the treatment team process \nas little more than inquiring whether guardians are “happy” with CHDC or whether they are \n“interested” in community placement.  In fact, guardians are asked to choose between \ncommunity placement and continued institutionalization before they even meet with their loved \nones’ treatment team.  CHDC treatment teams take no further steps if a guardian states they are \nhappy in CHDC or not interested in community placement.  Not only do CHDC treatment teams \ndeprive families of information by not providing them with an independent recommendation, but \nthey take no steps to ensure that families are informed about community options.  Without \nspecific, accurate information about what exists in the community and the options available to \nmeet the needs of their loved ones, guardians cannot meaningfully make a decision about a more \nintegrated placement, and Defendants preserve their discriminatory and unlawful system. \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213. \nA.  CHDC Is a Segregated, Institutional Setting That Deprives Its Residents of \nthe Opportunity To Fully and Independently Participate in Life. \n16.  CHDC is not an integrated setting but rather a self-contained facility.  Richardson Tr. \n541:10-14, 623:3-19; A. Green Tr. 830:10-831:21.  \n17.  There are very few opportunities for CHDC residents to interact with non-disabled peers \nor develop friendships with non-disabled peers.  Richardson Tr. 541:10-14; US Ex. 230 (Off \nGrounds Outing).  CHDC residents receive most of their services on the facility grounds.  \nRichardson Tr. 535:6-18; A. Green Tr. 831:1-6 (medical care and dental care is provided to \nresidents at CHDC).  \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 18 of 318\n18.  The off-campus outings available at CHDC are mostly large group activities such as \ngoing to the movies, and are offered to only a very small percentage of CHDC residents. \nRichardson Tr. 535:19-537:6; US Ex. 230 (Off Grounds Outing for May 2009).  Such activities \ndo not provide CHDC residents with an opportunity to meaningfully interact with or get to know \nnon-disabled peers on a more personal level.  Richardson Tr. 535:19-537:6 \n19.  Virtually no one spends their day outside of CHDC.  Currently, no CHDC residents \nparticipate in day programs outside of facility grounds.  Richardson Tr. 537:9-16; US Ex. 229.  \nOnly 11 individual CHDC residents work off-campus – a mere two percent of the individuals at \nCHDC.  Richardson Tr. 533:19-534:17; US Ex. 229.   \n20.  The overwhelming majority of the CHDC residents sleep in dormitories that deprive \nindividuals of the privacy, personal space, and security for belongings that adults typically enjoy.  \nRichardson Tr. 537:17-540:14 (“[W]e don’t tend to share our sleeping spaces with multiple \npeople. Even folks who go to a nursing home don’t want to sleep in a more than two-person \nroom, and most don’t want to do that either. So it’s the norm for our society is to have your own \nsleeping space and your own place to have your belongings.”), 543:7-23; US Ex. 235.   \n21.  In some CHDC residences, as many as ten individuals sleep in one room.  Price Tr. \n1679:23-1680:6.  Other residences have four individuals or more to a room or segment.  \nRichardson Tr. 537:17-538:14. \n22.  CHDC residents do not “have a daily opportunity to participate in what’s for most of us a \nfairly normal activity of preparing a meal, and being around a meal when a meal is being \nprepared.”  Richardson Tr. 540:24-541:9.  Instead, food for CHDC residents is “pre-prepared” in \na central kitchen and then is transported out to the units for meals.  Richardson Tr. 540:24-541:9; \nA.

The Arkansas System for Serving Individuals With Developmental \nDisabilities Promotes Institutionalization.  \n1)  CHDC Residents Tend To Enter CHDC As a Child and Stay for a \nLifetime. \n23.  Most current residents of CHDC entered the facility as children or youth.  US Ex. 454.   \nMore than one-third of the current CHDC residents were admitted to the facility when they were \nyounger than 10 years of age, and 82 percent of residents were admitted when they were under \n18 years of age.  US Ex. 454.    \n24.  Of the 419 residents who entered CHDC under the age of 18, 62 percent (more than half \nof CHDC’s population) have been there for 30 years or more.  US Ex. 454 at 2-3.  \n25.  For example, ME was admitted to CHDC in 1968, when he was just 6 years old.  US Ex. \n160.   He spent over 40 years at CHDC – the remainder of his life.  ME died of aspiration \npneumonia in 2009.  Price Tr. 6883:21-6884:5; Weaver Tr. 378:25-379:3. \n26.  JR is now a 46-year-old man, but he was just 6 years old when he was admitted to CHDC \nover 40 years ago, in 1970.  US Ex. 140-1 (Redacted Individual Program Plan (“IPP”)).1 \n Although JR is able to walk, talk, follow directions, dress and feed himself, and operate a \nshredding machine, every indication from his IPP is that JR, who has not seen his guardian in \nover 30 years, will remain at CHDC for the rest of his life.  The long range goal in JR’s IPP \nstates, “[b]y 2012 I will have self-care and daily living skills enabling me to function more \nindependently in my present residence.”  US Ex. 140-1 at CON-US-0322156. \n27.  ZS is still a child, just 12 years old.  US Ex. 206.  He, too, was 8 years old at the time of \nhis admission to CHDC in 2007.  ZS’s admission to CHDC was supposed to be a temporary \n                                                 \n1   US Ex. 466 includes a spreadsheet of names for the redacted IPPs.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 20 of 318\nplacement while waiver services were set up for him.  US Ex. AG-1; A. Green Tr. 6802:21-25.  \nYet, at the time of trial, ZS was still living at CHDC and his IPP reflects no expectation that ZS \nwill ever leave CHDC.  His long range goal states, “By 2012, I will learn appropriate behaviors \nin order to function more independently in his [sic] environment at CHDC and home visits.” US \nEx. 206 at CON-US-0110256. \n28.  Indeed, few admitted individuals are ever discharged from CHDC, and even fewer \nindividuals are discharged to more integrated settings.  Richardson Tr. 541:24-542:16; US Ex. \n271.  Since July 2009, only 6 admitted individuals were discharged from CHDC.  A. Green Tr. \n6768:8-12.  Only 18 individuals were discharged between June 2007 and July 2009.  US Ex. \n271; Richardson Tr. 541:15-542:16.  Seven of those individuals were placed at other Arkansas \nhuman development centers.  US Ex. 271.  Only 11 people during that two year period – slightly \nmore than 2 percent of the population – were discharged into more integrated settings, such as \ntheir family home or placements run by private community-based service providers.  US Ex. \n271. \n29.  In 2006 and 2007 an individual was more likely to die at CHDC than be discharged.  US \nEx. AG-2; A. Green Tr. 6794:4-6795:13. \n30.  In fiscal year 2008/2009, CHDC’s goal was to discharge 4 residents.  US Ex. 235 (CHDC \nBelief-Based Performance Management and Strategic Plan: Outcome 1).  CHDC’s original \ndischarge goal had been eight, but was reduced to four because CHDC had been unsuccessful at \nreducing its population the previous year when admissions exceeded discharges.  G. Miller Tr. \n5041:13-5044:5;  US Ex. GM-2.  \n31.  In the last two years, CHDC has admitted more children than adults.  A. Green Tr. \n846:18-22; C. Price 1690:17-23.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 21 of 318\n32.  There are approximately 50 school-aged individuals (under 21 years of age) living at \nCHDC, making up approximately 10 percent of the population at CHDC.  US Ex. 229; J.C. \nGreen Tr. 764:20-765:1; A. Green Tr. 846:2-5. \n33.  CHDC has expanded its capacity for housing children since 2003.  J.C. Green Tr. 768:3-\n6.  Prior to the announced closing of Alexander HDC in Spring 2010, DDS had planned to \nexpand CHDC’s capacity for school-aged children to approximately 75.  J.C. Green Tr. 765:24-\n768:6; Price Tr. 1690:24-1692:20; US Ex. 1105 at 10.   \n34.  An institutional environment is not a normal environment for any child.  Richardson Tr. \n548:5-17.  It denies the child opportunities to have contact with non-disabled peers and to have \nan ongoing parental relationship with an adult.  Richardson Tr. 548:5-17.  \n35.  Children who are institutionalized run the risk of remaining institutionalized for the rest \nof their lives.  Richardson Tr. 548:18-549:3.  Long term institutionalization makes it very \ndifficult to separate children from that environment later in life.  Richardson Tr. 548:18-549:3. \nAs a result, children grow up without opportunities for more normal lives in which they could \nparticipate in the community or another less restrictive setting.  Richardson Tr. 548:18-549:3. \n36.  In addition, institutionalization has long term consequences for children as they age, such \nas developing “institutional behaviors,” which result when the children observe and model the \nother maladaptive behaviors that occur around them.  Matson Tr. 1179:4-15; see also Matson \n1312:9-1313:4 (children’s development harmed by unsound medication practices). \n37.  Arkansas is exceptionally restrictive in its treatment of children with developmental \ndisabilities.  Matson Tr. 1098:1-7 (psychology expert Matson has never “seen any other \nresidential facility with this many kids [living and] receiving all of their schooling on the \ncampus”), Matson Tr. 1108:1-1109:16 (50 out of 50 students on shortened school day and lack \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 22 of 318\nof integrated behavioral services); US Ex. 1216 (ADE monitoring file citing CHDC for various \ndeficiencies). \n2)  The Arkansas System for Serving Individuals with Developmental \nDisabilities Relies Disproportionally on Institutionalization.   \n38.  Arkansas serves more individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in \ninstitutions than any other state but Mississippi.  US Ex. 212 & 212-2; Richardson Tr. 593:21-\n595:6.   Per 100,000 people in the general state population, Arkansas serves 39 individuals in \ninstitutions.  US Ex. 212-2; Richardson Tr. 593:21-595:6.  The national average is 12.9.  US Ex. \n212-2. \n39.  Arkansas’s system for delivering services to individuals with developmental disabilities \n“makes it easier for a person to enter an institution than receive services in the community.”  J.C. \nGreen Tr. 792:22-793:8; US Ex. 232 at CON-US-0018017.  \n40.  The State’s Governor’s Integrated Services Task Force Report admits that “[t]oo often, \nwhen a person experiences an acute illness, injury, or behavioral episode, entry into the \ninstitution is the initial solution.  Once the person has made the necessary lifestyle changes to \nenter an institution, he or she may find it more difficult to return home than it would have been to \nremain in the community in the first place.  Many supposed “short-term” stays in a nursing home \nor an Intermediary Care Facility for Mental Retardation (“ICF/MR”) become extended stays that \nlast a lifetime.”  US Ex. 232 at CON-US-0018017; J.C. Green Tr. 793:9-19. \n41.  According to data from 2007, many states do not use any large (defined as 16 or more \nbeds) public facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities at all including West \nVirginia, New Mexico, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Alaska, Hawaii, Indiana, and \nMaine.  Richardson Tr. 595:16-19; US Exs. 212, 212-2 & 214 at iii.    \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 23 of 318\n42.  In addition, as of June 30, 2007, at least 7 additional states served 100 or fewer \nindividuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in large state-operated institutions:  \nDelaware, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming.  US Ex. 214 at 21-32.  \nIn 2006, 7 more states served 230 or fewer individuals with intellectual and developmental \ndisabilities in state-operated institutions:  Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, North Dakota, \nSouth Dakota, and Utah.  US Ex. 212-2.    \n43.  From 1990 to 2006, the number of individuals with developmental disabilities residing in \nlarge institutions nationwide declined 55 percent, from 84,818 individuals to 38,299 individuals.  \nUS Exs. 212 & 212-2 at 49.  Since 1980, the average state reduced its use of ICF/MR institutions \nby 71.7 percent, while in this timeframe Arkansas has reduced its use of ICF/MRs by 31.2 \npercent – less than half that amount.  US Ex. 214 at 7; Richardson Tr. 596:11-596:17.   \n44.  Other states, such as Pennsylvania, have acknowledged that all of the individuals in the \nstate’s ICF/MRs can be served outside of institutions with appropriate supports.  Richardson Tr. \n597:20-25.   New Hampshire provides services to individuals with developmental disabilities \nexclusively in community settings.  US Ex. 212-2.  \n45.  Arkansas ranks 44th for allocating resources to those individuals with developmental \ndisabilities in the community, 49th for supporting individuals in community and homelike \nsettings, 50th in keeping families together through family support, and 51st in supporting \nmeaningful work.  Kastner Tr. 4446:16-4449:19 (testimony of Defendants’ consultant Dr. \nTheodore Kastner, conceding Arkansas’s ranking in the United Cerebral Palsy, Inc.’s \nindependent annual report “The Case for Inclusion,” a report Dr. Kastner had cited in his \nprevious work in Connecticut) (report surveys all 50 states and the District of Columbia).   \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 24 of 318\n46.  The Arkansas ACS Waiver program is a part of the federal Home and Community-Based \nServices (“HCBS”) program funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(“CMS”).  US Ex. 254 (Application for a § Arkansas 1915(c) Home and Community-Based \nWaiver Application); see Richardson Tr. 627:16-628:22.  The ACS program provides \ncommunity-based services for individuals with developmental disabilities as an alternative to and \nto prevent institutionalization.  Cromer Tr. 1410:21-1413:5. \n47.  Individuals who are eligible for an institutional level of care, have a developmental \ndisability, and meet the Medicaid income eligibility requirements are eligible for participation in \nthe waiver program.  Cromer Tr. 1414:15-20.  \n48.  The State gives people an incentive to enter the HDC system because people can get \nwaiver services faster by first entering the HDCs and then applying for waiver services as a \npriority HDC resident.  J.C. Green Tr. 780:3-783:18; Black Tr. 6838:6-16 (“The other problem \nwith the Medicaid waiver is, at the time when we were moving him from Easter Seals, they were \nworking on number one, and we were number 2,200 something.”). \nC.  ADA Expert Toni Richardson Provided Credible Expert Testimony.  \n1)  Expert Richardson Is Well-Qualified To Review the Process Used by \nCHDC Interdisciplinary Teams. \n49.  The U.S. Department of Justice asked Toni Richardson to review CHDC’s process for \ndetermining whether residents of CHDC can be served in a more integrated setting.  Richardson \nTr. 515:18-21, 734:22-735:5; US Ex. 210-1. \n50.  Expert Richardson has been working for more than 40 years on behalf of individuals with \nintellectual and developmental disabilities.  Richardson Tr. 516:22-24; US Ex. 210-1 (Resume of \nToni Richardson).  For the last 15 years, she has been a consultant to states such as Pennsylvania, \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 25 of 318\nTennessee, Louisiana, and New Jersey, regarding their services for individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities.  Richardson Tr. 515:22-24; US Ex. 210-1.  She assists states with \ndeveloping their quality assurance plans, developing five-year plans, and improving their \ncommunity services.  Richardson Tr. 516:4-13.  \n51.  In addition, expert Richardson’s recent work includes the review of interdisciplinary team \ndecisions about placement of individuals institutionalized at the Clover Bottom and Greene \nValley Development Centers in Tennessee into more integrated settings.  Richardson Tr. 516:4-\n17.  Ms. Richardson’s independent professional evaluation of the individual plans is then further \nreviewed by a district court’s quality review panel which is comprised of professionals in the \nfield of developmental disabilities.  Richardson Tr. 736:21-737:13. \n52.  Expert Richardson has extensive experience administering and managing state systems \nthat serve individuals with developmental disabilities.  She was the commissioner of the \nConnecticut Department of Mental Retardation for five years and prior to that was the regional \ndirector for the state-operated developmental centers in Connecticut.  Richardson Tr. 518:17-\n519:21.  Richardson also worked for several years as the supervisor of the Connecticut state \noffice that licenses and certifies public and private organizations that serve individuals with \nintellectual and developmental disabilities, including public and private ICF/MRs.  Richardson \nTr. 518:4-11.   \n53.  Richardson has direct experience working in institutions.  Richardson Tr. 516:25-517:21.  \nShe worked as a direct care staff person, a special education teacher and teacher’s supervisor at a \nlarge ICF/MR in Connecticut.  Richardson Tr. 517:10-18.  \n54.  Richardson has a master’s degree in special education and is currently certified, as well \nas a law degree.

As part of her review of the community integration process at CHDC, expert Richardson \ntoured the facility for approximately 2 weeks in July and September of 2009.  Richardson Tr. \n522:19-24.  She visited approximately 20 residential units, as well as day programs and \nemployment workshops on the CHDC grounds.  Richardson Tr. 522:25-523:10.    \n56.  Before and after these tours, expert Richardson reviewed a range of documentation, \nincluding both system-wide and facility policies and procedures, CHDC-related surveys and \ndata, individual records and program plans, and sources of nationwide data regarding services for \nindividuals with developmental disabilities.  Richardson Tr. 526:6-18, 527:6-12.   \n57.  Expert Richardson interviewed key individuals on the CHDC staff including the director \nof social services, the five team leaders, and a representative from the Division of Developmental \nDisabilities Services.  Richardson Tr. 523:7-10, 525:20-526:2.   \n58.  Expert Richardson visited several providers of community-based services for individuals \nwith intellectual and developmental disabilities.  Richardson Tr. 523:17-25.  These included two \nproviders in the Conway area and three providers in the Little Rock area.  Richardson Tr. \n524:19-525:2.  These visits included opportunities to observe apartment settings as well as \nsmaller ICF/MRs that must adhere to the same rules and regulations that apply to CHDC.  \nRichardson Tr. 524:19-525:2, 574:22-576:14.   She was able to speak to the directors and staff \nmembers of these programs.  Richardson Tr. 589:17-590:4, 591:9-15.   \n59.  Expert Richardson picked a sample of 40 CHDC residents, met or observed them, and \nexamined their records, including their IPPs.  Richardson Tr. 526:16-18, 528:1-10, 606:23-25.  \nFor these 40 individuals, Richardson examined the process through which CHDC determined \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 27 of 318\nwhether they could be served in a more integrated setting, as required by the ADA and CHDC’s \nown policies.  Richardson Tr. 526:6-25, 527:23-528:15, 530:16-531:19, 532:3-22.  \n60.  As she looked at each individual’s records, expert Richardson read the summaries of their \nassessments, and looked for any interest in community placement as well as any descriptions of \nthe individuals or program planning that was inconsistent with placement in a restrictive \nenvironment like CHDC, such as a need for quiet, private space, or one-on-one attention in order \nto learn well.  Richardson Tr. 552:6-15, 557:24-558:6. \n61.  Expert  Richardson also considered individuals’ medical and health conditions, stability, \nbehavior, potential for progress, pattern of services, age, and the activities and programs that the \nindividual enjoyed participating in, including whether or not there would be more opportunities \nfor that activity in a more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. 564:7-565:10, 572:10-25.   \n62.  These are the types of factors an interdisciplinary team considers in deciding whether an \nindividual is in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.   Richardson Tr. 572:22-25.  \nThese are also the types of factors expert Richardson uses when she reviews IPPs in her role as \nan evaluator for a district court’s quality review panel.  Richardson Tr. 573:1-4.   \nD.  CHDC Treating Professionals Are Responsible for Assessing Whether \nCHDC Is the Most Integrated Setting Appropriate for a Residents’ Needs. \nSocial work supervisor \n \n63.  Angela Green is a “licensed certified social worker” and “oversee[s] the Social Services \ndepartment at CHDC.”  A. Green Tr. 816:24-817:11.  She has worked at CHDC since 2000.  A. \nGreen Tr. 816:22-23.  As the head of the social services department, Angela Green’s duties \ninclude the “hiring, training, and supervising” of all twelve program specialists, or social services \nworkers, at CHDC.  A. Green Tr. 817:12-17.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 28 of 318\n64.  Green is considered the most knowledgeable person at CHDC about community \nplacement.  A. Green Tr. 819:7-12; Price Tr. 1695:11-16. \n65.  The social service workers that Green supervises are “responsible for providing \ninformation to residents and guardians for residents on their caseload about community \nplacement options.”  They are also responsible for helping residents and guardians transition into \ncommunity placements.  A. Green Tr. 819:23-820:10.   \nTeam Leader \n66.  Each individual at CHDC is part of one of five residential “teams” which coordinate \napproximately with an individual resident’s level of skill, independence and/or disability.  \nRichardson Tr. 554:3-14.  Individuals in the Total Care Team (“TCT”) have the most significant \ndisabilities at CHDC.  Richardson Tr. 554:3-14.  Individuals in the Habilitation and Training \nTeam (“HTT”) are the most independent and high functioning individuals at the facility.  \nRichardson Tr. 554:3-14; R. Brewer Tr. 1474:13-16. \n67.  Each of the five teams has a residential services manager, who is also known as the “team \nleader.”  L. Brewer Tr. 1459:10-20; Richardson Tr. 525:9-19.  Team leaders are responsible for \nsupervising one of the five teams at CHDC.  L. Brewer Tr. 1462:3-1463:18; US Ex. 279.  Their \nduties include “reviewing, monitoring, and approving programs for developmentally disabled \nindividuals.”  L. Brewer Tr. 1462:18:22; R. Brewer Tr. 1474:20-23; US Ex. 279 (“Job \nSummary”).  This specifically includes the duty to “approve or disapprove individual program \nplans.”  L. Brewer Tr. 1462:23-1463:3; US Ex. 279 (“Job Duties and Responsibilities No. 3”).  \nTeam leaders review IPPs and attend annual reviews to ensure that residents’ plans meet their \nneeds.  L.

He is \nthe team leader of the Individual Assistance Team (“IAT”).  L. Brewer Tr. 1459:10-12,  \n1460:10-15.  \n69.  Rebecca Brewer has been a CHDC staff member since 1974 and is the current team \nleader of the HTT.  R. Brewer Tr. 1472:25-1473:7, 1474:7-9.  The majority of CHDC residents \nwho transition to more integrated settings do so from the HTT.  R. Brewer Tr. 1474:17-19. \n70.  Doug Hart has been a CHDC staff member since 2003 and is currently the team leader of \nthe Sheltered Living Team (“SLT”).  Hart Tr. 1925:7-9, 1926:9-14.  Many of the older \nindividuals at CHDC are part of the SLT.  Hart Tr. 1926:22-1927:1.  \nProgram coordinator \n71.  Program coordinators are responsible for coordinating services for a particular caseload \nof residents.  Clendenin Tr. 1565:16-23; Murphy Tr. 435:8-436:1.  They conduct annual reviews, \nhold special staffings, monitor the implementation of program plans, review program plans, and \ndraft the interpretative summary on individuals’ IPPs.  Clendenin Tr. 1565: 19-23; Murphy Tr. \n436:14-19. \n72.  Program coordinators head the annual IPP meetings, compile the different disciplines’ \nreports for the development of IPPs, and monitor progress towards the IPP’s goals.  Weaver Tr. \n302:2-304:7; Hart Tr. 1927:14-16; Murphy Tr. 436:14-437:22. \n73.  Program coordinators should “know the most about a resident’s overall condition.”  L. \nBrewer Tr. 1463:8-11; R. Brewer Tr. 1475:2-9.  This includes the individuals’ IPPs, safety plans, \nstrategies, and positive behavioral support plans.

Defendants Discriminate Against Individuals at CHDC by Depriving Them \nof Objective, Reasonable Assessments Regarding Whether They Are \nAppropriate for a More Integrated Setting. \n74.  CHDC interdisciplinary teams (“IDTs”) fail to conduct objective, reasonable assessments \nof whether CHDC residents can be served in a more integrated setting.  See FOF ## 91-298.  \nInstead, CHDC treatment teams routinely find that CHDC is the most integrated setting unless \nand until a resident’s guardian proactively requests community placement.  See FOF ## 91-114. \n1)  In Determining the Most Integrated Setting Appropriate, \nInterdisciplinary Teams Must Conduct an Independent, Objective \nAssessment of Individuals’ Needs and the Supports Necessary To Meet \nThose Needs. \ni.  HDC Residents Should Be in the Most Integrated Setting \nAppropriate to their Needs.   \n75.  The policy statements of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental \nDisabilities and the President’s Committee on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities state \nthat individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities should be served in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to their needs.  Richardson Tr. 736:5-20, 737:14-17.   \n76.  Similarly, the DDS mission statement commits DDS to “statewide planning that ensures \noptimal innovative growth of the Arkansas services to meet the needs of people with \ndevelopmental disabilities and to assist such persons to achieve independence and integration \ninto the community.”  Richardson Tr. 530:9-531:13; US Ex. 211.   \n77.  The DDS mission also states its commitment to delivering services to individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities in the least restrictive environment appropriate for that individual \nperson.  Richardson Tr. 531:2-13; US Ex. 211.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 31 of 318\n78.  CHDC’s mission statement acknowledges that CHDC is “committed to utiliz[ing] the \nleast restrictive alternatives to meet the developmental needs of individuals and foster a return to \ncommunity living.”  Richardson Tr. 532:3-25; US Ex. 238. \n79.  Each individual admitted to CHDC should have an IPP.  US Ex. 278 (CHDC Individual \nProgram Plan policy).  CHDC’s Individual Program Plan policy states that the IPP is to be “goal-\ndirected and must define the direction in which a person wants their life to go.”  US Ex. 278 at 1; \nRichardson Tr. 584:5-12; L. Brewer Tr. 1464:1-5; R. Brewer Tr. 1475:10-13.  In doing so the \nIPP should “specify long-range goals, behavioral objectives, and service objectives.”  US Ex. \n278 at 1; L. Brewer Tr. 1464:6-8.  \n80.  CHDC interdisciplinary teams discuss the IPP annually at the annual review meeting.  US \nEx. 278 at 1.  “The annual review is driven by the belief that throughout a lifetime, a person \ncontinues to develop increased competence/independence in successively less restrictive settings. \nIt is the foundation for all decisions regarding services for any individual.”  US Ex. 278 at 2; L. \nBrewer Tr. 1464:9-13.  \n81.  According to DDS policy, one of the purposes of the annual review meeting is to \ndetermine that resident’s eligibility to remain at an HDC.  Defs Ex. 912 at 107 (DDS Policy \n1086: Human Development Center Admission and Discharge Rules) (emphasis added); see also \nPorter v. Knickrehm, 457 F.3d 794, 797 (8th Cir. 2005) (Court of Appeals affirmed the District \nCourt’s approval of the new HDC admission/discharge rules).  DDS policy regarding Human \nDevelopmental Center admission states in part that “in order to be eligible for admission the \nindividual must be eligible for developmental disabilities services, be in need of and able to \nbenefit from active treatment, and be unable to access appropriate adequate developmental \ndisabilities services in a less restrictive alternative.  Defs Ex. 912 at 106-07; see also Price Tr. \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 32 of 318\n1692:16-20 (admission process should determine if an individual is “unable to access services in \na less restrictive environment”). \n82.  Consistent with this, CHDC policy states that the concluding step of the annual review \nmeeting is “the review of all goals/objectives to determine the least restrictive alternatives \navailable to enable the individual resident to achieve his/her personal goals.”  US Ex. 278 at 3; \nsee Clendenin Tr. 1583:20-1586:15 (the primary purpose of an individual’s annual review is to \ndevelop a plan for increasing a resident’s independence and transition into less restrictive \nenvironments).  \nii.  To Determine How the Individual Can Be Placed in the Most \nIntegrated Setting Appropriate to Their Needs, Treating \nProfessionals Must Independently Assess the Individual’s Desires, \nNeeds, and Services Necessary To Meet Their Needs. \n83.  In determining the most integrated setting appropriate for an individual, the treatment \nteam must examine the individuals’ needs, services necessary to meet those needs, and the \nindividuals’ desires.  See FOF ## 79, 80, 82 (Requirements of CHDC Individual Program Plan \nPolicy). \n84.  The treatment team must provide an objective, clinically-based recommendation as to the \nappropriateness of community placement in order for residents and guardians to make an \ninformed decision.  Richardson Tr. 617:22-618:6. \n85.  Defendants’ consultant Kastner agrees that the interdisciplinary teams’ decision \nregarding the most integrated setting appropriate for any CHDC resident should be separate from \nthe decision of the resident or guardian about placement outside of the facility.  Kastner Tr. \n4586:20-25. \n27 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 33 of 318\n86.  The availability of services should not be a bar to being recommended for community \nplacement.  Richardson Tr. 629:16-19; Walsh Tr. 6143:8-16. \n87.  Interdisciplinary teams should be collecting information about the individual – their \nabilities, interests, likes, dislikes, challenges – and crafting a program that allows that individual \nto get what they want to out of life.  Richardson Tr. 582:15-583:4, 605:19-606:10.  Such an \nassessment provides information that should be used to determine the most integrated setting \nappropriate for that individual and what sort of specific, specialized services that individual \nwould require in a more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. 580:18-581:5, 585:4-11. \n88.  CHDC assessments should provide a description of what a resident actually needs to live \nin an integrated setting beyond a generic list of services.  Richardson Tr. 529:2-9, 550:5-551:11.  \nThe plan should include specifics such as what type of specialized medical care or behavioral \nhealth intervention the individual would need, what kind of specialist would be required, or what \ntype of transportation might be necessary (or how often).  Richardson Tr. 550:5-551:11. \n89.  Community placement expert Richardson described what an individualized assessment \ncontains as follows: \n[W]hat I was looking for was more of a description beyond the generic; What is it about \nmedical care? Is there something about medical care that the person would need? Would \nhe need to be close to a hospital, for example? Would he need to have a specialist, a \nneuro specialist? Would he need physical therapy? Would it need to be physical therapy \nin his residence or could he go to the physical therapist for service? If he were in the \ncommunity, he’d need transportation, but what kind of transportation would he need? \nWould he need to be near a bus line? Would he need to have a car available at the house \nhe was living? Would he need to have a special wheelchair van, or would he need an \nextra-special wheelchair van? Because some people go out and their wheelchairs are such \nthat they don't fit in a regular wheelchair van. So would he need a special wheelchair \nvan? Those are the kind of elements that I expected to see discussed in the plan so that \nyou'd have a very clear picture of what kind of services this person could possibly get in a \ncommunity setting, or would need to get in a community setting and very specific to him. \nBecause what that does is allow you to really think about his services, but also to, when \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 34 of 318\ntaken together with the plans of other people, to inform providers about the kind of \nservices they might need to develop.   \n \nRichardson Tr. 550:14-551:11.  \n90.  The resulting program plans should apply the information gathered in the plan to assist \nthe team in understanding how the resident can move to an appropriate more integrated setting.  \nRichardson Tr. 580:18-581:5; see FOF # 87. \n2)  CHDC Teams Fail To Find That Any Residents Can Be Served in More \nIntegrated Settings Unless a Guardian Affirmatively Requests or \nExpresses Interest in Community Placement. \n91.  CHDC’s own policies require that the treatment team annually determine an individual’s \neligibility to remain at CHDC, including that the individual is unable to access appropriate \nservices in a less restrictive alternative.  See FOF # 81 (DDS policy 1086); see also Richardson \nTr. 617:22-618:6, US Ex. 278.   \n92.  However, in practice, unless a guardian requests placement in a more integrated setting, \nCHDC interdisciplinary teams overwhelmingly conclude that CHDC is the least restrictive \nsetting appropriate for each individual.  Richardson Tr. 529:10-22; see FOF ## 115-176 (CHDC \nerroneously finds that CHDC is the least restrictive setting appropriate); Kastner Tr. 4586:20-25.   \n93.  At the time of trial, there were only four individuals at CHDC who were recommended \nby their interdisciplinary team for participation in the ACS waiver program.  Richardson Tr. \n546:19-547:3; US Ex. 284-1.  According to CHDC, there were also only four CHDC residents \nseeking participation in the Arkansas ACS waiver program.  Richardson Tr. 547:4-13; US Ex. \n305-1.  The four individuals recommended by their teams for the waiver program are the same \nfour individuals seeking participation in the waiver program.  Richardson Tr. 547:4-13; A. Green \nTr. 836:16-837:9; US Exs. 284-1 & 305-1. \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 35 of 318\n94.  In the discharge/transition section of almost every CHDC individual program plan, the \nIDT concludes that CHDC is the “least restrictive environment” for that person and simply \nclaims the guardian’s assent or lack of interest in a more integrated setting.  See FOF # 97.   \n95.  For example, ZS’s 2008 IPP concludes that CHDC “is the least restrictive placement for \n[ZS],” and notes that “[ZS’s] mother and father are pleased with [ZS’s] placement.”  US Ex. 206.  \nHis IPP further states that ZS would need to “acquire the skills necessary to transition through \nthe Team hierarchy at CHDC before he could successfully function in a community setting,”  US \nEx. 206, even though his 2007 admission to CHDC was supposed to be a temporary placement \nwhile he waited for waiver services to be set up.  US Ex. AG-1; A. Green Tr. 6802:21-25.   \n96.  In another example, ET’s IPP concludes that CHDC is the least restrictive environment \nappropriate for his needs, US Ex. 127 at 10, however, he was discharged from CHDC on July 15, \n2009.  US Ex. 269 at US-CON-B-0034853; Richardson Tr. 559:1-17. \n97.  The overwhelming majority of CHDC IPPs reach the same conclusion – that the guardian \nwants the resident to stay at CHDC (or “is happy with CHDC”) and that CHDC is the least \nrestrictive environment for each resident.  US Exs. 105 at 9 (IPP for AN), 115 at 14 (IPP for CL), \n122 at 10, 12 (IPP for DB), 124 at 11 (IPP for DG), 132 at 15 (IPP for HB), 134 at 12 (IPP for \nJN), 135 at 11 (IPP for JR), 138 at 14 (IPP at JM), 143 at 12 (IPP for JW), 149 at 11-12 (IPP for \nLR), 160 at 14-15 (IPP for ME), 161 at 15 (IPP for MF), 162 at 13 (IPP for MD), 166 at 10 (IPP \nfor NP), 167 at 10-11 (IPP of OM), 173 at 10 (IPP for RC), 176 at 20 (IPP for RN), 178-2 at 10 \n(IPP for RW), 179 at 10 (IPP for RD), 191-2 at 18 (IPP for TC), 193 at 10 (IPP for TR),194 at 17 \n(IPP for TH), 199 at 11 (IPP for WF), 202-2 (IPP for WC), 206 at 15 (IPP for ZS), 561-21 (IPP \nfor SA), 562-3 at 11 (IPP for MB), 563-34 (IPP for GB), 566-21 (IPP for DB), 578-40 at 9 (IPP \nfor MS) & 579-15 at 12 (IPP for CW); see also US Exs. 101-1 at 15, 102-1 at 15, 103-1 at 16, \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 36 of 318\n109-1 at 17, 111-1 at 15, 113-1 at 10-11, 114-1 at 10, 129-1 at 9, 136-1 at 14, 139-1 at 11, 140-1 \nat 9, 146-1 at 9, 152-1 at 9-10, 156-1 at 12-13, 157-1 at 12-13, 163-1 at 16, 165-1 at 12, 171-1 at \n10, 172-1 at 14, 175-1 at 10, 177-1 at 14, 180-1 at 13, 192-1 at 12, 196-1 at 12, 198-1 at 11 & \n200-1 at 11 (redacted IPPs).     \n98.  CHDC staff confirmed, both to expert Richardson during her tour of CHDC and later at \ntrial, that IDT teams generally do not assess or even discuss a resident’s appropriateness for a \nmore integrated placement unless the guardian first expresses an interest in community \nplacement options.  Richardson Tr. 555:3-556:7, 606:23-607:12; US FOF ## 99-105.   \n99.  The head of CHDC social services, Angela Green, told expert Richardson that CHDC \nwaited for parents to initiate the search for a more integrated placement.  Richardson Tr. 555:3-\n12.   According to Ms. Green, CHDC did so in order to avoid raising the hopes of families and \nindividuals, if there is no realistic expectation that that placement could be made available. \nRichardson Tr. 555:3-12.  At trial, Ms. Green denied using the term “false hope” in her \nconversation with expert Richardson.  A. Green Tr. 6763:24-6764:4 (“I did not use that term \nwith her.”). \n100.  Consistent with her remarks to Ms. Richardson, Ms. Green testified at her deposition that \nwhen an IPP sets forth the skills a resident needs to acquire prior to being considered for a more \nintegrated setting, what that really means is that “the individual or guardian has not specifically \nrequested alternate placement.” A. Green Tr. 836:2-15.    \n101.  According to CHDC program coordinator Judy Weaver, at IPP meetings, staff discuss \nspecific community services only after an individual’s guardian expresses interest in community \nplacement.  Weaver Tr. 413:7-413:22. \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 37 of 318\n102.  Similarly, CHDC program coordinator Sarah Murphy agreed that CHDC interdisciplinary \nteams do not identify any particular providers who could meet the needs of a resident until a \nguardian expresses an interest in community placement.  Murphy Tr. 502:22-503:8 (“the team \nalways discusses the least restrictive setting and discusses other placement options generally, like \nthe client going to the parents’ home, like Medicaid waiver services, you know, it’s general. \nWhen you get down to more specific options, then those would be pursued upon the client and/or \nguardian’s desire”), 501:15-502:9. \n103.  Team leader Rebecca Brewer testified that “the process of determining the appropriate \nsetting essentially involves asking the guardian if they’re interesting [sic] in pursuing a \ncommunity placement,” and whether they are “happy with the placement, do they want to pursue \nplacement elsewhere, where do they think their family member is – you know, the most \nappropriate placement for the person they’re responsible for.”  R. Brewer Tr. 1475:24-1476:8.  \n104.  CHDC parent, Alan Fortney, testified that the guardian makes the initial recommendation \nregarding community placement and that typically the other team members accept that the \nguardian knows what is best for the resident and agree with the guardian.  Fortney Tr. 1487:2-20, \n1489:6-1492:6, 1503:6-18. \n105.  CHDC’s superintendent, Calvin Price, can recall only one time in his eight years at \nCHDC when an IDT initiated consideration of transferring an individual to a more integrated \nsetting before a guardian requested community placement.  Price Tr. 1706:14-22. \n106.  When originally questioned at trial, CHDC Director of Social Services, Angela Green, \ncould not recall any instance when team members determined that a resident was appropriate for \na more integrated setting without the guardian first agreeing.  A. Green Tr. 837:14-21; see FOF \n## 63-65 (responsibilities of social worker supervisor).  However, Ms. Green later changed her \n32 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 38 of 318\ntestimony and stated she could recall “about two” times when an IDT recommended a resident \nbe placed in a more integrated setting even though the guardian did not first agree to such a \nrecommendation.  A. Green Tr. 854:17-856:16. \n107.  Larry Brewer is the CHDC team leader of IAT, one of the five teams at CHDC.  L. \nBrewer Tr. 1459:10-15; 1460:10-15, see US FOF # 67 (responsibilities of CHDC team leaders).  \nHe testified that after all of the annual reviews he has attended and IPPs he has reviewed in over \n35 years of working at CHDC, he is not aware of any instances “where CHDC staff have \ndetermined that a resident is appropriate for community placement even though the parent or \nguardian disagrees.”  L. Brewer Tr. 1464:19-1465:1.    \n108.  When called by the United States to testify at trial, Rebecca Brewer, team leader for the \nHTT, confirmed her April 2010 deposition testimony that she could not recall any situation \nwhere an IDT recommended a resident for a more integrated setting in the absence of support for \nor interest in community placement by a guardian.  R. Brewer Tr. 1476:9-1478:15, 6755:19-22.   \n109.  When subsequently called to testify at trial by Defendants, Ms. Brewer changed her \ntestimony to say she now recalled one time when the IDT recommended a resident for \ncommunity placement despite the guardian’s objection to moving the individual to a more \nintegrated setting.  R. Brewer Tr. 6729:3-13, 6755:11-6756:2.  Nevertheless, Ms. Brewer \nacknowledged that it is rare that the team recommends community placement unless the guardian \nfirst agrees.   R. Brewer Tr. 6729:14-16.  \n110.  Doug Hart is the team leader of the SLT, Hart Tr. 1926:9-14, and testified that he has \nnever been to an IPP review meeting where the IDT recommended a more integrated setting \nwithout the guardian’s request or support.  Hart Tr. 1930:8-14. \n33 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 39 of 318\n111.  Judy Weaver is a CHDC program coordinator and has worked at CHDC since 1979. \nWeaver Tr. 301:1-6; see FOF ## 71-73 (responsibilities of CHDC program coordinators).  In her \ntwo years as a program coordinator, Ms. Weaver cannot recall a single incident of the treatment \nteam and a resident’s guardian disagreeing about a community placement decision.  Weaver Tr. \n301:7-11, 402:17-402:24. \n112.  Ms. Weaver recalls only one individual on her caseload who was ever recommended for \ncommunity placement.  Weaver Tr. 401:22-402:10.   \n113.  Sarah Murphy has worked at CHDC since 2001 and was a program coordinator for two \nand a half years.  Murphy Tr. 434:9-19; see FOF ## 71-73 (responsibilities of CHDC program \ncoordinators).  Ms. Murphy cannot not identify any time in her two and a half years as a program \ncoordinator in which an individual’s treatment team concluded that an individual was appropriate \nfor a more integrated setting without a guardian’s support or agreement.  Murphy Tr. 482:20-25. \n114.  Alan Fortney is the former President of the Conway Parent Association, the stepfather of \na CHDC resident, and a frequent participant in his stepdaughter’s annual IPP reviews.  Fortney \nTr. 1485:3-15, 1497:21-1498:5.  He could not recall ever attending an annual review where the \nIDT disagreed about whether CHDC was the most integrated placement appropriate for his \nstepdaughter.  Fortney Tr. 1494:7-23. \n3)  Local Providers of Community Services Are Currently Serving \nIndividuals Who Need the Same Supports and Services as Residents of \nCHDC. \n115.  The testimony of local providers of community services that they can serve individuals \nwith the same needs as those at CHDC further demonstrates that CHDC’s assessments are not \nobjective and reasonable.  See FOF ## 116-140.   \n34 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 40 of 318\n116.  Four community service providers from throughout the State of Arkansas reviewed IPPs \nfor 46 CHDC residents to determine whether they could provide services to CHDC residents in a \nmore integrated setting.  US Exs. 101-1, 102-1, 103-1, 105-1, 109-1, 111-1, 113-1, 114-1, 118-1, \n126-1, 129-1, 131-1, 136-1, 137-1, 138-1, 139-1, 140-1, 143-1, 146-1, 148-1, 152-1, 156-1, 157-\n1, 163-1, 164-1, 165-1, 166-1, 167-1, 171-1, 172-1, 173-1, 175-1, 176-1, 177-1, 179-1, 180-1, \n184-1, 185-1, 187-1, 192-1, 193-1, 196-1, 198-1, 199-1, 200-1 & 202-1 (redacted IPPs); see US \nEx. 466 (Graca Decl. regarding redacted IPPs).  These 46 IPPs represented a random selection of \nhalf the residents reviewed by community placement expert Richardson (21 residents), and half \nthe residents reviewed by Defendants’ consultant Kastner (25 residents).  US Ex. 466 (Graca \nDecl. regarding redacted IPPs). \n117.  All four providers were confident that they could serve the vast majority of the 46 CHDC \nresidents whose IPPs they reviewed.  See FOF ## 119, 124, 134 & 140. \n  First Step \n \n118.  Provider Pamela Bland is the Executive Director of First Step, Inc., a provider of \ncommunity services for approximately 1,600 people with developmental disabilities throughout \nArkansas.  Bland Tr. 860:10-862:1.   \n119.  With the exception of approximately 5 individuals for whom she wanted more \ninformation, First Step could serve all of the individuals described in the 46 IPPs she reviewed in \na more integrated setting than CHDC.  Bland Tr. 896:21-897:17.  Provider Bland reviewed the \nIPP of no individual at CHDC that she affirmatively could not serve in the community.  Bland \nTr. 896:21-897:17. \n120.  For example, First Step could serve KH in a more integrated setting.  Bland Tr. 876:3-\n877:10; US Ex. 146-1 (Redacted IPP).  KH is 30 years old and was admitted to CHDC in June \n35 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 41 of 318\n2001.  US Ex. 146-1.  His IPP lists the discharges services he needs as: “specialized nutritional \nservices, habilitation services, psychological services, 24-hour care and supervision, physical and \noccupational therapy, nursing and medical interventions, dental, specialized recreational \nservices.”  US Ex. 146-1 at 9.  The CHDC team found that his guardians are “pleased” with his \nplacement at CHDC and subsequently, teams made no alternative placement recommendations.  \nUS Ex. 146-1 at 3 & 9.  Nevertheless, First Step can serve KH and currently serves similar \nindividuals with similar needs and disabilities.  Bland Tr. 876:3-877:21.   \n121.  Similarly, First Step could serve MK.  Bland Tr. 877:11-878:12; US Ex. 163-1 (Redacted \nIPP).  He is 19 years old and was admitted to CHDC at the age of 16.  US Ex. 163-1. He has \ncerebral palsy, seizure disorder, and hearing loss.  Bland Tr. 877:11-878:12.  MK’s IDT  \nidentified some of his significant needs to be identifying coins, cooperating with brushing his \nteeth, and improving his behavior.  US Ex. 163-1 at 18.   His long range goals, as listed in his  \nIPP, are to “independently participate in a group activity” by 2011, “obtain 3 daily living skills” \nto help him “function more independently in (his) home,” and to “use the toilet independently.” \nUS Ex. 163-1 at 18.   \n122.  MK’s team concluded that CHDC is the least restrictive placement for him.  US Ex. 163-\n1  at 16.  The team found that MK’s guardians are “pleased” with CHDC and that “the most \nappropriate transition plan for [MK] at this time would be for him . . . to continue to acquire the \nskills necessary to transition through the Team hierarchy at CHDC before he could successfully \nfunction in a community setting.”  US Ex. 163-1 at 16.  However, community providers like First \nStep provide training in independent living skills.  See FOF # 198.   In addition, First Step \n“commonly” provides services in the community for individuals with the same discharge needs \nthat are identified in MK’s IPP.

ICM could serve the CHDC residents described in all 46 IPPs, if funding was not an \nissue.  Alberding Tr. 1397:11-1398:1.  Of the 46, ICM could clearly serve 35 of the individuals \nin a more integrated setting.  Alberding Tr. 1355:2-22, 1379:13-20 (ICM could serve all 46 \nindividuals but 11 individuals required more information about costs of care).   \n125.  For the individuals for which provider Alberding needed more information, her concern \nwas whether she could provide staffing for their behavior needs on the waiver cap of $391/day.  \nAlberding Tr. 1355:23-1356:12.   If waiver funding was not capped, she could provide \ncommunity-based services to all 46 individuals.  Alberding Tr. 1368:4-16.    \n126.  In 2007, Arkansas’s waiver expenditures per resident were $27,286.  US Ex. 214 at 75.  \nThis is 33 percent less than the national average of $41,387.  US Ex. 214 at 75.   Arkansas’s \nfederal match for Medicaid costs is the second highest match rate in the nation – the federal \ngovernment pays 73.37 percent of Arkansas’s waiver expenditures.  US Ex. 214 at 75, 77.  (“As \nin all Medicaid programs, the federal government shares the costs of the ICF-MR and HCBS \nprograms with the states as a function of the state per capita income relative to national per \ncapita income”). \n127.  Provider Alberding did not review any IPP for a resident who she thought definitely \ncould not be served in the community.  Alberding Tr. 1355:2-22. \n37 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 43 of 318\n128.  Like First Step, ICM is also able to provide or secure each of the services that MK’s \nCHDC team stated he must have before discharge is to occur.  Alberding Tr. 1364:8-1366:23 \n(“Direct care supervision and assistance 24 hours, yes.  Assistance for shopping, yes.  Nutrition, \nyes.  Transportation, yes.  Emergency care, yes.  Training/active treatment, yes.  Special \neducation, yes.  Recreation and leisure services, yes.  Behavioral intervention, yes.  Psychiatric \nservices, yes.  Case management, yes.  OT, PT, speech, yes.”).   \n129.  ICM is likewise able to serve JJ, who is 53 years old and was admitted to CHDC at the \nage of 11.  Alberding Tr. 1372:16-1373:7; US Ex. 139-1 at 1 (Redacted IPP).  JJ can “speak in \nshort phrases or repeat most of what is said to him or from the TV.”  US Ex. 139-1 at 12.  He can \nexpress preferences, keep time to music, and initiate interactions with other people.  US Ex. 139-\n1 at 12-13.  JJ’s team identifies his long range goals as identifying items, completing hand usage \nactivities, completing three daily living skills, and identifying work related objects.  US Ex. 139-\n1 at 13.   \n130.  JJ’s CHDC team concluded that the institution is the least restrictive placement for him \nbecause JJ needs to “acquire the daily living (wipe traytop/identify body parts) and self-help \nskills (wipe mouth) necessary to function in a community setting.”  US Ex. 139-1 at 11.  \nHowever, ICM can provide services to meet not only those daily skills-building needs, but also \nthe additional discharge services listed as necessary in JJ’s IPP.  Alberding Tr. 1372:16-1373:23; \nSee FOF ## 197 & 226 (ICM provides for daily living skills, behavioral needs and also \nadditional discharge needs listed above). \n131.  ICM is also able to serve ER in a more integrated setting.  Alberding Tr. 1374:3-1375:18; \nUS Ex. 131-1 (Redacted IPP).  ER is currently 46 years old and was admitted to CHDC when \nshe was 9 years old.  US Ex. 131-1.  ER is ambulatory and likes to go outside.  US Ex. 131-1 at \n38 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 44 of 318\n3.  She can pour herself coffee, climb a fence, and use a treadmill.  US Ex. 131-1 at 13.  Her IDT \nidentifies some of ER’s significant needs as identifying quarters from a variety of coins, \nmatching color cards, and improving her behavior.  US Ex. 131-1 at 14.  ER’s team has \nidentified her long range goals as doubling her work output and improving three self-help skills. \nUS Ex. 131-1 at 14.   \n132.  ER’s team found that CHDC “remains the least restrictive setting” for her and that in \norder for her to transfer to a more independent setting, she “needs to enhance her self-help and \ndaily living-skills and vocational skills.”  US Ex. 131-1 at 11.  However, as already noted above, \nICM provides training in daily living/independent living skills and, in addition, can provide for \nthe discharge services listed as necessary in her IPP.  Alberding Tr. 1374:3-1375:18; US Ex. \n131-1 at 11-12; see FOF # 197.   \nBost \n133.  Provider Jeff Lambert is the Assistant Executive Director of Bost, Inc., a provider of \ncommunity services for approximately 700 people with developmental disabilities in northwest \nArkansas.  Lambert Tr. 1857:25-1858:12, 1859:16-23. \n134.  Of the 46 IPPs he reviewed, Bost could serve the individuals described in all of them if \nfunding were not an issue.  Lambert Tr. 1875:19-1878:1.  Of the 46 individuals, Bost could serve \n31 without any additional information.  Lambert Tr. 1875:19-1878:1.   For 9 with nursing care \nissues and 6 with behavioral health issues, provider Lambert wanted additional information to \ndetermine whether Bost could serve the individual under present waiver funding restrictions.  \nLambert Tr. 1875:19-1878:1.   \n135.  For example, Bost could successfully serve RT, who is 68 years old and was admitted to \nCHDC in 1982.  US Ex. 171-1 (Redacted IPP).  RT “tends to entertain himself and enjoys \n39 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 45 of 318\nspending time on the lawn swing outside his residence or having a cup of coffee on the patio.”  \nUS Ex. 171-1 at 3.  He “gets along very well with other residents but sometimes appears tense or \nupset when other individuals become loud or disruptive in his residence.”  US Ex. 171-1 at 3.  \nRT can communicate his wants and needs, get dressed with assistance, and toilet independently.  \nUS Ex. 171-1 at 11.  His IPP list of significant needs includes “match coins by value,” “select \ncorrect amount of simulated pills from a container,” and “time to relax/rest.”  US Ex. 171-1 at \n11-12.   \n136.  CHDC’s team concluded that CHDC “remains the least restrictive placement alternative” \nfor him and that to be considered for alternate placement, RT “would need to perform his self-\ncare tasks more independently and manage his Bipolar Disorder more independently.”  US Ex. \n171-1 at 10.  RT’s IPP states that he would need the following services if discharged:  “direct \ncare/supervision (24 hour basis), immediate access to emergency care; specialized medical, \ndental, dietary and psychiatric services; work/training sites, day programming; transportation, \nbehavioral intervention and recreation/leisure services.”  US Ex. 171-1 at 10. \n137.  Bost can provide all of the services listed in RT’s discharge/transition plan in a more \nintegrated setting, including the self-care training and behavioral health services raised as a \nbarrier by his team.  Lambert Tr. 1878:2-1880:19, 1871:13-1874:16; US Ex. 171-1; see FOF # \n227. \n138.  Bost has successfully provided community-based services to individuals discharged from \nCHDC including a medically fragile individual from the “Willow” residence at CHDC.  Lambert \nTr. 1864:11-1866:17, 1885:6-19.   \n \n \n40 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 46 of 318\nArkansas Support Network \n139.  Provider Keith Vire is Chief Executive Officer of Arkansas Support Network (“ASN”), a \ncommunity-based services provider serving approximately 800 people with developmental \ndisabilities, primarily in northwest Arkansas.  Vire Tr. 1505:4-1508:5. \n140.  ASN could support and “support well” the individuals described in all 46 IPPs.  Vire Tr. \n1526:23-1527:22, 1540:24-1541:11; see also US Ex. 113-1; Vire Tr. 1528:6-1531:1 (ASN able \nto serve individuals with profound mental retardation); US Ex. 111-1; Vire Tr. 1531:2-18 (ASN \nsuccessfully serves similar individuals with hearing impairments, chronic health problems, \nlanguage delays, aggression and self-injurious behavior); US Ex. 143-1; Vire Tr. 1533:14-\n1536:14 (ASN can serve individual with behavioral issues who needs learn personal care skills); \nUS Ex. 202-1; Vire Tr. 1537:24-1540:23 (ASN can serve individuals who have lived at CHDC \nfor a long time).   \n141.  ASN is able to serve individuals with diagnoses of “profound mental retardation.”  Vire \nTr. 1528:6-1531:1; US Ex. 113-1 (Redacted IPP).  This includes individuals like BM, who is 20 \nyears old and was admitted to CHDC at the age of 7.  US Ex. 113-1 at 1.  BM prefers one-to-one \nattention from family, friends, and staff.  US Ex. 113-1 at 3.  His team concluded that CHDC \n“remains the least restrictive alternative” for him.  US Ex. 113-1 at 10.  However, ASN could \nserve BM in a more integrated setting. Vire Tr. 1526:23-1527:1, 1528:8-14 (“this is a person \nwho could really thrive in a community setting”). \n142.  ASN successfully serves individuals, similar to BB, who have hearing impairments, \nchronic health problems, language delays, aggression, and self-injurious behavior.  Vire Tr. \n1531:2-18; US Ex. 111-1 (Redacted IPP).  BB is 18 years old and was admitted to CHDC at the \nage of 13.  US Ex. 111-1 at 1.  He has many independent and daily living skills including the \n41 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 47 of 318\nability to dress/undress himself, feed himself, and take out the trash.  US Ex. 111-1 at 3.  He can \nidentify coins, brush his teeth, and “operate a coke machine.”  US Ex. 111-1 at 17.  During home \nvisits, BB visits with family, watches TV, plays with toys, and goes shopping.  US Ex. 111-1 at \n3. His treatment team identified his significant needs as stacking paper, pouring medicine from a \nbottle into a cup, and opening a Band-Aid package.  US Ex. 111-1 at 17.   \n143.  The CHDC team concluded that institutionalization “remains the least restrictive \nalternative” for BB because he needs to “continue to learn skills in personal hygiene, \nprevocational skills, money management, and self-administration of medication to assist in \npreparing him with the tools necessary to move up the Team hierarchy and to eventually \nsuccessfully function in the community.”  US Ex. 111-1 at 15.  However, ASN can serve BB and \nindividuals who have disabilities similar to BB in a more integrated setting.  Vire Tr. 1531:2-18, \n1521:8-1522:1 (Acquisition of self-care skills and independent living skills is not a barrier to \ntransition to participation in ASN’s community service programs); US Ex. 111-1; see FOF ## \n197-198. \n144.  ASN can serve JW, who is 22 years old and was admitted to CHDC in October 2006.  \nVire Tr. 1533:14-1536:14; US Ex. 143-1 at 1 (Redacted IPP).  His IPP states that he is “totally \ndependent” on others to provide care for him.  US Ex. 143-1 at 3.  His IPP also finds that in order \nfor JW to be successful in the community, he would need an “attendant for personal care, \ngrooming, hygiene; specialized nutritional/dietary services; transportation services; \ncommunication facilitator; specialized medical services including OT and PT; work skills \ntraining and supervision; and recreational services.”  US Ex. 143-1 at 12.  Even though his team \nconcluded that CHDC remains the least restrictive alternative for him, US Ex. 143-1 at 12, ASN \ncurrently serves individuals who, like JW, have behavioral issues and need to learn personal care \n42 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 48 of 318\nskills.

ASN can also serve individuals like WC, who have lived at CHDC for a long time.  Vire \nTr. 1537:24-1540:23; US Ex. 202-1.  WC is 50 years old and was admitted to CHDC when he \nwas 14.  US Ex. 202-1 (Redacted IPP).  He can eat with utensils, dress/undress himself, make his \nbed, fold laundry, buckle his own seatbelt, clean small appliances, and use a staple puller.  \nUS Ex. 202-1 at 11-12.  WC’s team identified his significant needs as “clean oven with less \nprompts,” arrive on time for work, and improve tooth brushing.  US Ex. 202-1 at 12.   His IPP \nidentifies his discharge service as “direct care/supervision (24 hour basis); immediate access to \nemergency care; specialized medical, dental, dietary and psychiatric services; communication \nfacilitator; day programming; work sites/situations, transportation and recreation/leisure \nservices.”  US Ex. 202-1 at 10. \n146.  WC’s team concluded that CHDC “remains the least restrictive alternative” for him and \nthat to be considered for alternate placement, WC “would need to have his behaviors of \naggression under better control, expand his work skills, and perform self-care/daily living skills \nmore independently.”  US Ex. 202-1 at 10.  However, as noted above, ASN provides training for \nthose individuals who need more personal care skills and services for those with behavioral \nissues.  Vire Tr. 1533:14-1536:14; see FOF ## 198 & 228.  In addition, ASN has successfully \nserved individuals who have lived in institutions for long periods of time.  Vire Tr. 1538:5-\n1539:2.  \n147.  Although funding might be an issue for some medically fragile individuals, ASN could \nserve all 46 individuals represented in the redacted IPPs if there was no cap on waiver services.  \nVire Tr. 1561:22-1562:8.    \n43 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 49 of 318\n4)  CHDC Staff Conceded That Many Individuals at CHDC Can Be Served \nin More Integrated Settings. \n148.  CHDC staff admitted that some residents who are not currently recommended for a more \nintegrated setting could nevertheless have their needs met in the community.  See FOF ##  \n149-157. \n149.  For example, in a discussion of CHDC resident LW, CHDC program coordinator Sarah \nMurphy acknowledged that community providers could provide the “consistency and structure” \nidentified as a key reason that CHDC is an appropriate placement for him.  Murphy Tr. 475:19-\n476:10; US Ex. 153.  Nevertheless, his interdisciplinary team concluded that CHDC is the least \nrestrictive environment for him.  US Ex. 153 at 18.  \n150.  In a discussion of CHDC resident NP, CHDC program coordinator Donna Clendenin \ntestified to her belief that the services necessary to meet NP’s needs are available in the \ncommunity.  Clendenin Tr. 1590:12-1594:4.  Nevertheless, his interdisciplinary team identified \nCHDC as the least restrictive setting for him.  Clendenin Tr. 1590:12-23; US Ex. 166 at 10.  \n151.  Similarly, during a discussion of CHDC resident DB, Ms. Clendenin testified to her \nbelief that the services necessary to meet his needs are available in the community.  Clendenin \nTr. 1609:20-1611:24; US Ex. 122.  His interdisciplinary team identified CHDC as the least \nrestrictive setting for him.  US Ex. 122 at 12.  \n152.  Likewise, during a discussion of CHDC resident JB, Ms. Clendenin testified to her belief \nthat the services JB needs are available in a more integrated setting.  Clendenin Tr. 1628:19-\n1629:10; US Ex. 142.  \n153.  Several CHDC staff admitted that community services providers can provide the training \nidentified in CHDC residents’ IPPs as a prerequisite for consideration for community placement.  \n44 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 50 of 318\nFor example, Ms. Rebecca Brewer, a CHDC team leader, testified that many of the skills taught \nto residents at CHDC, such as “hygiene, self-care skills, baking,” are taught by providers in more \nintegrated settings.  R. Brewer Tr. 6753:3-12.   \n154.  CHDC program coordinator Sarah Murphy testified that CHDC residents should not be \nbarred from placement in a more integrated setting because they need to acquire self-care skills \nand greater independence.  Murphy Tr. 477:22-478:6.   \n155.  In his own community practice, CHDC’s chief psychologist sees residents with the same \ntypes of medical and other issues related to their developmental disabilities that he sees in CHDC \nresidents, and those individuals in the community are being adequately served in the community.  \nReddig Tr. 2020:15-24. \n156.  Similarly, CHDC psychological examiner, Anita Cooper, testified that many of the \nbehavioral services provided at Conway, such as interviewing staff to assess residents or training \nstaff on strategies on managing behaviors, can “probably” be provided in the community as well.  \nCooper Tr. 2421:4-8, 2454:6-2455:12. \n157.  The speech-language services offered at CHDC can be provided in a community setting.  \nJohnson Tr. 5399:17-5401:3. \n5)  CHDC Treatment Teams Lack Sufficient Information or Knowledge \nNecessary To Make Objective, Reasonable Assessments Regarding the \nMost Integrated Setting Appropriate for Individuals at CHDC. \n158.  The CHDC staff who participate in the interdisciplinary teams, including the annual \nreview meetings, and make decisions regarding the most integrated setting appropriate for \nCHDC residents, must have an accurate understanding of what services are available in the \ncommunity and what the benefits are of living in an more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. \n45 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 51 of 318\n607:21-608:8, 611:25-613:3, 616:17-617:13, 628:22-630:5 (CHDC needs a “real education effort \nto help people understand how important community services are and to get to know them, to get \nto know them well.”). \n159.  Treating professionals at CHDC, however, do not have sufficient knowledge and training \nregarding community integration and community options to provide objective, reasonable \nassessments to individuals and their guardians.  Richardson Tr. 611:10-24, 615:7-10.  As a result, \nCHDC residents and guardians do not receive sufficient information from CHDC about the \nsupports and services available, and the possibilities and benefits of a more integrated setting. \nRichardson Tr. 616:17-618:6; US Ex. 264; see FOF ## 299-317.    \n160.  Angela Green, the CHDC director of social services and staff person most knowledgeable \nabout community placement, is not familiar with all of the services available in the community, \nfor example, what daily living skills are necessary or what behavioral skills are required.  A. \nGreen Tr. 826:11-828:25.  \n161.  Ms. Green was not even aware of the existence of a DDS waiver guide until April 2010, \nwhen a community service provider gave her a copy.  A. Green Tr. 6797:17-25 (“Pathfinder had \ncopies of this [the ACS waiver guide].”).  At her deposition Ms. Green was unable to identify \nany benefits of living in settings more integrated than CHDC, other than being able to choose \nwhere one lives.  A. Green Tr. 829:8-830:9.   Only in response to defense counsel’s obviously \nleading questions was Ms. Green able to identify any other benefits of living in more integrated \nsettings.  A. Green Tr. 848:23-849:13. \n162.  The social service workers that Ms. Green supervises receive little to no formal training \nregarding more integrated placements available in Arkansas.  A. Green Tr. 820:25-821:22, \n825:7-14 (testifying that in nine years, DDS has done three trainings for program specialists \n46 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 52 of 318\n/social workers at CHDC).  Nor do they receive any formal training on the ADA.  A. Green Tr. \n824:11-20.  Nevertheless, they are “responsible for providing information to residents and \nguardians for residents on their caseload about community placement options.”  A. Green Tr. \n819:23-820:10.  They are also responsible for helping residents and guardians locate an \nappropriate placement when requested.  A. Green Tr. 819:23-820:10. \n163.  CHDC Superintendent Price is not familiar with what services are offered outside of \nCHDC by Arkansas’s community providers.  Price Tr. 1710:8-21.  Superintendent Price does not \nknow what types of behavioral services are available in the community.  Price Tr. 1711:14-17. \n164.  Superintendent Price does not know what services, if any, CHDC provides that cannot be \nobtained through a community program.  Price. Tr. 1715:10-1716:4 (“I’m not sure.  I don’t \nknow.  It gets back to I’m not quite sure what all those community providers, what type of \nservices that they offer in their individual programs, so I would have a tough time answering that \none . . . .  I'm just not sure what a lot of the programs have to offer as far as those services. Many \nof the programs we’ve heard here today are basically – are nonresidential programs, so I’m really \nnot sure what type of those services that they offer.  I’m really not.”). \n165.  Similarly, CHDC team leaders have little understanding of what supports and services are \ncurrently available in community programs.  Richardson Tr. 615:15-616:3; see FOF # 67 \n(responsibilities of CHDC team leaders).  For example, one team leader informed Ms. \nRichardson that she had not investigated community placements, had not read about them, and \ndid not know much about them.  Richardson Tr. 615:15-23.  Another team leader said that he \nknew community placement was an option, but that CHDC was the best so it was not necessary \nto spend time on the issue.  Richardson Tr. 615:25-616:3.   \n47 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 53 of 318\n166.  The trial testimony of CHDC team leaders underscores their lack of knowledge and \ntraining about community placement options.  For example, Rebecca Brewer testified that she \nhasn’t visited a community placement in “over ten years,” R. Brewer Tr. 1478:16-20, and does \nnot “have a sense of the specific services that are offered in the community.”  R. Brewer Tr. \n1478: 16-25; see FOF ## 67 & 69 (Team leader Rebecca Brewer is the current team leader of the \nHTT, the team from which the majority of CHDC residents transition to more integrated \nsettings).   \n167.  In fact, Ms. Brewer admitted that she does not believe that placements in the community \nprovide the same quality of services that are available at CHDC.  R. Brewer Tr. 1479:1-4.   \n168.  When asked how many residents from one CHDC team, HTT, had been identified as \nappropriate for a more integrated setting and are currently waiting for placement, Ms. Brewer \nestimated that “close to ten” HTT residents were currently on the waiting list for community \nplacement.  R. Brewer Tr. 1479:5-15.  In fact, CHDC identified only four residents in the entire \nfacility as appropriate for a more integrated setting.  A. Green Tr. 836:16-837:9; US Ex. 284-1. \n169.  Team leader of CHDC team SLT, Doug Hart oversees the care of 105 residents and \nsupervises 165 staff members.  Hart Tr. 1926:14-21.  Mr. Hart has never visited a community \nplacement in Arkansas or any other state.  Hart Tr. 1927:23-1928:2.  Mr. Hart does not have any \n“sense what services are available in the community,” or what the significant barriers to \ntransitioning to a more integrated setting are for the residents on his team.  Hart Tr. 1928:3-5, \n1928:11-16.  He has not received any training on community integration or community \nplacement since working at CHDC and, prior to having his deposition taken by the United States \nin April 2010, was not familiar with the term “Olmstead Plan.”  Hart. Tr. 1928:17-1929:12. \n48 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 54 of 318\n170.  Likewise, Larry Brewer supervises approximately 180 staff and 66 residents as the IAT \nteam leader.  L. Brewer Tr. 1460:10-18; 1462:3-5.  As team leader, he is also supposed to \nprovide clinical supervision to the program coordinators.  L. Brewer Tr. 1463:4-7; US Ex. 279; \nR. Brewer Tr. 1474:24-1475:1; Hart Tr. 1927:2-4.  Mr. Brewer erroneously believes that there \nare not more integrated settings than CHDC in Arkansas that could serve a school-aged \nindividual who has “self-help skill needs [and] aggression.”  L. Brewer Tr. 1467:2-6; see FOF ## \n197, 198 & 225-228 (Community providers can serve children who have aggressive behaviors \nand/or need self-help skills.).  \n171.  For more than two years, Judy Weaver served as a CHDC program coordinator without \nany knowledge about what services existed in the community.  Weaver Tr. 403:16-404:11; see \nFOF ## 71-73 (responsibilities of a program coordinator). \n172.  Program coordinator Judy Weaver has not visited a community provider, received \ntraining on the ADA, or received training on the Supreme Court’s decision in Olmstead v. L.C. \nWeaver Tr. 406:5-406:25. \n173.  CHDC program coordinator Sarah Murphy believes CHDC is an “integrated setting.” \nMurphy Tr. 504:2-6. \n174.  Ms. Murphy’s knowledge of what services are available in the community is limited to \nher personal internet research, what CHDC social workers have told her, and informal \nconversations with community providers.  Murphy Tr. 505:11-506:4. \n175.  Program coordinator Murphy has not visited community providers in her role at CHDC. \nMurphy Tr. 4944:8-20 (“I can’t think of any I’ve been to.”). \n49 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 55 of 318\n176.  Ms. Murphy was the program coordinator for CHDC resident TC, but did not know \nwhether all of the services TC needed could be provided in the community.  Murphy Tr. 473:22-\n475:18; US Exs. 191 & 191-2.  \n177.  CHDC’s training curriculum discusses community integration policy but contains no \nsubstantive training about community placement, community services, or the Arkansas ACS \nwaiver program.  Richardson Tr. 611:10-24.  For example, the CHDC new employee \ncertification, US Ex. 226, does not include any documents with information about community \nservices and how they relate to CHDC nor any discussion of the relationship between community \nservices and residents’ opportunities to live and experience a more integrated setting.  \nRichardson Tr. 611:25-612:21.   \n178.  Similarly, the CHDC annual retraining outline, US Ex. 227, contains no information \nindicating that transition to more integrated settings is part of the training.  Richardson Tr. 613:4-\n16; US Ex. 227.   \n179.  One CHDC PowerPoint training contains a few slides touching on least restrictive \nenvironments, waiver, and deinstitutionalization.  Richardson Tr. 613:20-614:9; US Ex. 228.  \nThis is the only substantive information regarding community integration for CHDC employees. \nRichardson Tr. 614:2-9; US Ex. 228.  \n180.  Arkansas community providers, such as Pathfinders, Easter Seals, and United Cerebral \nPalsy, are not invited to provide regular training at CHDC regarding their services, nor does \nCHDC communicate with many community providers about their services.  Richardson Tr. \n590:23-591:15, 614:23-615:6; Bland Tr. 866:2-867:12; Alberding Tr. 1338:17-20; Lambert Tr. \n1866:18-1869:16; Vire Tr. 1523:10-19.   \n50 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 56 of 318\n181.  CHDC teams demonstrated their lack of sufficient training at annual review meetings, by \nfailing to substantively discuss community placement.  Richardson Tr. 616:12-617:21; see \nRichardson Tr. 549:11-550:4. \n182.  Psychology staff receive little or no training on how to assess residents for community \nplacement or how to implement federal statutes requiring treatment in the most integrated or \nleast restrictive setting.  Cooper Tr. 2453:20-2454:5. \n6)  Individual Program Plans Demonstrate CHDC’s Failure To Conduct \nObjective, Reasonable Assessments of Whether Individuals are \nAppropriate for a More Integrated Setting. \n183.  CHDC Individual Program Plans reflect CHDC’s failure to provide objective, reasonable \nassessments.  They are generic, repetitive, and identify non-existent barriers to placement in a \nmore integrated setting.  See FOF ## 79, 80 & 82 (Requirements for CHDC program plans).  \n184.  Thus, of the 40 IPPs that community placement expert Richardson reviewed, she found \nthat the vast majority did not reflect an adequate assessment of whether the individuals described \ncould be served in a more integrated setting, as required by the ADA and CHDC’s own policies.  \nRichardson Tr. 552:22-553:1 (“What I was saying is these people need to be looked at more \ncarefully and a more thorough transition plan needs to be designed so that it can be very clear \nwhat the benefits might be and what kind of services would need to be explored in order to make \nan appropriate community placement for these people.”), 553:11-25, 557:24-558:6.  \n185.  Based on her examination of 40 IPPs, Ms. Richardson concluded that most of the \nindividuals at CHDC did not receive a reasonable assessment and needed a more careful and \nindividualized evaluation to determine how they could benefit from a more integrated placement \nand what specific services would be necessary.  Richardson Tr. 550:5-552:5, 553:18-554:2. \n51 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 57 of 318\n186.  The absence of reasonable assessments at CHDC prevents further development of \ncommunity services.  Richardson Tr. 618:7-23.  Without detailed information about CHDC \nresidents who could live in a more integrated setting, including accurate information about what \nservices they would need, providers of community-based services cannot develop or increase the \navailability of those services so as to create further opportunities for CHDC residents.  \nRichardson Tr. 618:7-23. \n187.  Individual program plans demonstrate CHDC’s failure to provide objective, reasonable \nassessments and reflect CHDC staff’s lack of knowledge and training regarding community \nintegration.  Richardson Tr. 611:2-6. \n188.  CHDC individual program plans are generic and repeatedly identify the same illegitimate \nbarriers to transition to a more integrated setting, such as the need to acquire daily living skills or \nrectify behavioral issues.  Richardson Tr. 529:2-9, 610:27-611:9.  Furthermore, CHDC IPPs fail \nto describe the specific services that are necessary for a resident to successfully transition out of \nCHDC.  Richardson Tr. 529:2-9, 551:21-552:5.   \ni.  CHDC Teams Use the Acquisition of Skills as an Inappropriate \nBarrier to Placement in a More Integrated Setting. \n189.  In 11 of the 40 IPPs that community placement expert Richardson reviewed, the IDT \nrequired the acquisition of skills of some sort before the individual could be placed in a more \nintegrated setting, or included language regarding needing more independence or self-help skills \nin order to secure community placement.  Richardson Tr. 560:24-561:12, 579:21-580:17.  These \nIPPs require that individual residents “earn” their way into a community placement or learn \nsocial skills or basic self-care skills in order to qualify for more integrated setting.  Richardson \nTr. 529:23-530:8, 551:12-20.  \n52 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 58 of 318\n190.  LR is 57 years old and was admitted to CHDC on January 19, 2000.  US Ex. 149 at 1.  \nHis IPP states that in order to move to a less restrictive environment he “would need to acquire \nmore independent self-care skills and be able to follow daily activities with less assistance.”  US \nEx. 149 at 11.   \n191.  KF is 19 years old and was admitted to CHDC on December 11, 2006.  US Ex. 148.  Her \nIPP states that the acquisition of independent living skills is a requirement before discharge is \nappropriate.  US Ex. 148 at 13 (“For discharge to be appropriate, [KF] will need to be more \nindependent in following a daily routine (for basic self-care and daily living).”); Richardson Tr. \n559:23-561:5.    \n192.  WF is 70 years old and was admitted to CHDC on April 22, 1975.  US Ex. 199 at 1.  As \nin KF’s IPP, the transition/discharge plan in WF’s IPP notes that in order to be considered for \ncommunity placement WF must “improve self-care and communications skills, and expand work \nskills.”  US Ex. 199 at 11.   \n193.  JN is 40 years old and was admitted to CHDC on March 7, 1978.  US Ex. 134 at 1.  As \nwith KF and WF, the transition/discharge plan in JN’s IPP states that he “would need to be more \nindependent in self-care and have his aggression under control” to be considered for community \nplacement.  Richardson Tr. 585:12-586:1; US Ex. 134 at 12.  \n194.  Many other CHDC IPPs contain boilerplate, inappropriate skill acquisition requirements \nas part of the discharge/transition plan.  US Exs. 105 at 9 (IPP for AN), 112 at 14 (IPP for BR), \n115 at 14 (IPP for CL), 121 at 12 (IPP for CA), 122 at 12 (IPP for DB), 124 at 11 (IPP for DG), \n126  at 11 (IPP for DN), 127 at 10 (IPP for ET), 132 at 15 (IPP for HB), 135 at 11 (IPP for JR), \n138 at 14 (IPP for JM), 142 at 12 (IPP for JB), 145 at 13 (IPP for KH), 160 at 14-15 (IPP for \nME), 161 at 15 (IPP for MF), 162 at 13 (IPP for MD), 167 at 10-11 (IPP for OM), 176 at 20 (IPP \n53 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 59 of 318\nfor RK), 179 at 10 (IPP for RD), 181-2 at 12 (IPP for RC), 194 at 17 (IPP for TH), 206 at 15 \n(IPP for ZS), 561-21 at 12 (IPP for SA), 562-3 at 11(IPP for MB), 563-34 at 11-12 (IPP for GB) \n& 566-18 at 15 (IPP for DB); see also US Exs. 103-1 at 16, 109-1 at 17, 111-1 at 15, 114-1 at 10, \n131-1 at 11, 136-1 at 14, 139-1 at 11, 140-1 at 9, 152-1 at 9-10, 156-1 at 12-13, 163-1 at 16, 165-\n1 at 12, 171-1 at 10, 172-1 at 14, 175-1 at 10, 180-1 at 13, 185-1 at 11, 187-1 at 11, 196-1 at 12 \n& 198-1 at 11 (redacted IPPs). \n195.  The acquisition of daily living skills, as used by CHDC IDTs, is not a legitimate reason \nfor precluding individuals from a setting more integrated than CHDC.  Richardson Tr. 561:13-\n25.  Such conditional statements inappropriately place the burden on the individual to earn \nplacement outside of CHDC.  Richardson Tr. 562:1-6.  It is, in addition, an outdated concept in \nthe field of developmental disabilities, and as such, the acquisition of such skills is not a \nnecessary ingredient for moving into a more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. 578:25-579:15, \n580:3-17.   \n196.  Community providers can and do train individuals with intellectual and developmental \ndisabilities in basic self-care and social skills so that qualifying for placement by learning or \nacquiring those skills is not necessary.  Richardson Tr. 561:18-25 (“Community providers teach \nthose skills, so you really don’t have to have them to go into a community setting.”), 529:23-\n530:8. \n197.  Providers of community-based services for individuals with developmental disabilities, \nsuch as Independent Living Services, Inc., Easter Seals, Pathfinders, Inc., and United Cerebral \nPalsy, are able to provide or secure the independent living skills training and daily living services \nthat are identified in CHDC IPPs.  Richardson Tr. 591:16-25, 592:11-593:16 (provided services \n54 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 60 of 318\ninclude nursing care, direct supervision/24-hour care, adaptive equipment, occupational therapy \nand physical therapy).    \n198.  In addition, all of the local community providers that testified at trial stated that their \norganization provides training in these areas, including independent self-care skills and daily \nliving skills.  Bland Tr. 892:4-895:5, 896:12-20, 900:17-21; Alberding Tr. 1347:22-1351:12; \nLambert Tr. 1871:13-1874:16; Vire Tr. 1512:19-1516:22, 1521:8-1522:1 (testifying that \nacquisition of self-care skills and independent living skills is not a barrier to transition to a more \nintegrated setting whether that setting is supported with community services provided by ASN or \nany other program in the state). \n199.  It is quite possible that some individuals with developmental disabilities may never gain \nsome basic daily living skills, yet they can effectively be served in a more integrated setting.  \nRichardson Tr. 605:11-15, 561:18-25, 529:25. \n200.  For example, many CHDC IPPs include the need for institutionalized residents to learn \nhow to brush their teeth even though few residents can brush their teeth to the satisfaction of the \ninstitution.  Richardson Tr. 605:11-18.   \n201.  Ms. Richardson testified that she does not know of any states where children are \ninstitutionalized because they cannot brush their teeth, comb their hair, or count money.  \nRichardson Tr. 610:16-19.   \n202.  Nevertheless, CHDC requires that such skills be acquired before some individuals will be \nconsidered for a more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. 610:20-611:1. The use of such barriers \nreflects that the teams at CHDC do not understand what community providers can do in terms of \nteaching residents about skill development.  Richardson Tr. 611:2-6.  Such requirements also \nindicate that such plans are incomplete.  Richardson Tr. 611:7-9. \n55 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 61 of 318\n203.  IPPs as recent as June 2010 contained long-range goals to improve an individual’s skills \nin order to function better at CHDC.  Murphy Tr. 4952:16-4953:17; US Ex. 134-2 at 15 (IPP for \nJN) (“By 2011, I will have self-help, daily living skills, and communication to function more \nindependently in my present residence.”).   \nii.  CHDC Teams Use the Transition of Residents Through the CHDC \nTeam Hierarchy as an Inappropriate Barrier to Placement in a \nMore Integrated Setting. \n \n204.  Many CHDC IPPs state that individual residents must progress through CHDC’s five-\nteam structure in order to be placed in a more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. 578:7-21; see \nUS FOF # 66 (CHDC team structure).  The concept of requiring progress through an institution’s \nteam structure is outdated, unnecessary, and inappropriate.  Richardson Tr. 578:7-579:12.  \nRecommendations regarding placement in more integrated settings should be designed to fit the \nneeds of individuals and not depend on whether individuals have earned a more integrated \nplacement.  Richardson Tr. 579:12-14. \n205.  CHDC staff state that this concept is no longer implemented.  Richardson Tr. 578:7-21.  \nNevertheless, many IPPs contain language demonstrating that CHDC still uses the concept of an \nindividual transitioning through the teams in order to be considered for or placed in a more \nintegrated setting.  Richardson Tr. 578:25-579:5; see US FOF ## 197, 198, 225-228 (Arkansas \ncommunity-based service providers serve individuals who need skills training and have \nbehavioral health issues).   \n206.  For example, RN is 52 years old and was admitted to CHDC on February 8, 2000.  US \nEx. 176.  RN’s IPP contains the following language under the heading “placement issues”:  “The \nmost appropriate transition plan for [RN] at this time would be for him to acquire the skills \n56 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 62 of 318\nnecessary to transition through the Team hierarchy at CHDC before he could successfully \nfunction in a community setting.”  US Ex. 176 at 20.   \n207.  Likewise, RC is 30 years old and was admitted to CHDC on October 26, 2000.  \nRichardson Tr. 577:1-4; US Ex. 173.  Her IDT concluded that in order for her to successfully \nfunction in a community setting, she must acquire the independent and communication skills \nnecessary to “transition through the Team hierarchy at CHDC.”  Richardson Tr. 578:2-6; US Ex. \n173 at 10.   \n208.  JM is 23 years old and was admitted to CHDC on April 16, 2004.  US Ex. 138.  His IPP \nstates, “[t]he Team agreed the most appropriate transition plan for [JM] is for him to move to a \nhigher functioning Team and continue to gain the skills (independence in personal care, daily \nliving, vocational skills, and improved behavior) needed in order to move up the Team hierarchy \nprior to successfully functioning in the community.”  US Ex. 138 at 14.   \n209.  ZS is 12 years old and was admitted to CHDC on August 7, 2007 – for what was \nsupposed to be a temporary placement until waiver services could be set up for him.  US Exs. \n206, AG-1; A. Green Tr. 6802:21-25.  Yet his IPP also concludes that “the most appropriate \ntransition plan for [ZS] at this time would be for him to acquire the skills necessary to transition \nthrough the Team hierarchy at CHDC before he could successfully function in a community \nsetting.”  US Ex. 206 at 15. \n210.  AN’s plan includes the following language:  “The optimal transition plan for [AN] is to \ncontinue training in personal hygiene/grooming skills and training to foster independence with \nthe desired outcome of transition through the team hierarchy at the Center and eventual \ncommunity placement.”  US Ex. 105 at 9.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 63 of 318\n211.  HB is 14 years old and was admitted to CHDC on March 8, 2005.  US Ex. 132.  His IPP \nstates that “the team agreed the most appropriate transition plan for [HB] is continue to learn \nskills in personal hygiene, money management, daily living, and behavior improvement prior to \nmoving up the Team hierarchy and successfully functioning in the community.  US Ex. 132 at \n15.  \n212.  ME is 48 years old and was admitted to CHDC on June 6, 1968.  US Ex. 160.  His IPP \nstates that “the Team agreed the most appropriate transition plan for [ME] is that he continue to \nlearn skills in personal hygiene, daily living, prevocational tasks, and that he improve his \nbehavior.  The above areas are possible barriers to him transitioning up through the Team \nhierarchy prior to successfully functioning in the community.”  US Ex. 160 at 15.   \n213.  CA is 18 years old and was admitted to CHDC on September 21, 2006.  US Ex. 121.  His \nIPP states that “to transition to a less restrictive setting, [CA] needs to acquire the skills \n(vocational, daily living) to move through the Team hierarchy at CHDC.”  US Ex. 121 at 12.  \n214.  MF is 24 years old and was admitted to CHDC on January 16, 2008.  US Ex. 161.  His \nIPP states, “the most appropriate transition plan for [MF] at this time would be for him to acquire \nthe skills necessary to transition through the Team hierarchy at CHDC before he could \nsuccessfully function in a community setting.”  US Ex. 161 at 15; see also US Exs. 109-1 at 17, \n111-1 at 15, 163-1 at 16, 196-1 at 12 (Redacted IPPs with similar or identical “transition through \nthe team hierarchy” language). \n \n \n58 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 64 of 318\niii.  CHDC Teams Use Behavioral Improvements as an Inappropriate \nBarrier to Placement in a More Integrated Setting. \n \n215.  Similarly, CHDC interdisciplinary teams inappropriately raise behavioral health issues or \nthe necessity of improving behavior as a barrier to potential placement in a more integrated \nsetting.  Richardson Tr. 551:12-20.   \n216.  With the right supports, individuals with behavioral health issues can succeed in a setting \nmore integrated than CHDC.  Richardson Tr. 560:15-23, 603:1-8.  In fact, changing an \nindividual resident’s environment by reducing distractions and increasing personal attention can \npotentially improve an individual’s behavior.  Richardson Tr. 603:1-8; see US FOF # 36 (Expert \nMatson testified that children in institutions learn maladaptive behaviors from one another).   \n217.  CHDC’s own Strategic Plan supports this conclusion by calling for a reduction in the \nnumber of individuals at CHDC in order to increase personal space.  Richardson Tr. 603:9-13; \nUS Ex. 235.  \n218.  CHDC Superintendent Calvin Price testified that for some individuals, less personal \nspace can exacerbate violent and other maladaptive behaviors.  Price Tr. 1682:6-15.  \n219.  The IPP for DG is an example of how CHDC uses behavioral improvement as a barrier to \ncommunity placement.  DG’s IDT concludes that one of the things she has to do in order to be \nconsidered for a less restrictive setting is learn to handle frustrating situations better and, \nspecifically, without destroying clothing.  Richardson Tr. 601:24-602:4; US Ex. 124 at 11.  DG’s \nIPP notes that she has some behavior issues, including the fact that she tears clothing and tries to \nflush it down the toilet.  Richardson Tr. 602:7-9; US Ex. 124:4.  Expert Richardson testified that \nher behaviors are a response to frustration and that this frustration may be reduced in a less \ncrowded environment.  Richardson Tr. 602:16-22.  A change in an individual’s environment, \n59 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 65 of 318\nreduction in distraction, and an increase in personal attention can increase an individual’s ability \nto handle such behaviors.  Richardson Tr. 602:16-22.   \n220.  Likewise, the IPP for JR notes that in order to be considered for a less restrictive \nenvironment, he needs to follow his routine without continued staff direction and learn to express \nhis anxiety and frustration without aggression.  US Ex. 135 at 11.  JR’s IPP notes that his \nbehaviors included destruction of property and crying – actions attributed to attempts to get \nattention.  US Ex. at 11;  Richardson Tr. 604:13-18.  JR does not have significant behavioral \nissues when he visits his parents at their home, during off-campus outings, or in the recreation \nroom.  Richardson Tr. 604:19-22, 743:24-744:3; U.S. Ex. 135 at 3, 8, and 9 (JR also works at a \nrestaurant off-campus.).  If JR were to be placed in a more home-like environment and felt \ncomfortable, those behaviors may decrease.  Richardson Tr. 604:24-605:3.    \n221.  JB is 17 years old and was admitted to CHDC on March 18, 2009.  US Ex. 142  His IPP \nstates that “to be considered for alternate placement [JB] would need to be able to perform self-\ncare needs without constant monitoring; express his frustration/agitation in acceptable social \nmannerisms, and show more awareness and concern for his personal safety.”  Id. at 12.  \n222.  The IPP for JN is an example of how CHDC uses behavioral improvement as a barrier to \ncommunity placement.  The IPP notes that he needs to have his aggression under control to be \nconsidered for community placement.  US Ex. 134 at 12; Richardson Tr. 585:19-586:1.  \n223.  Many CHDC IPPs contain the same or similar requirements regarding improvement in \nbehavior as part of the discharge/transition plan.  Richardson Tr. 551:12-20; US Exs. 115 at 14 \n(IPP for CL), 122 at 12 (IPP for DB), 132 at 15 (IPP for HB), 134 at 12 (IPP for JN), 138 at 14 \n(IPP for JM), 145 at 13 (IPP for KH), 148 at 13 (IPP for KF), 160 at 15 (IPP for ME), 191-2 at \n18 (IPP for TC), 562-3 at 11 (IPP for MB), 563-34 at 12 (IPP for GB), 132 at 15 (IPP for HB), \n60 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 66 of 318\n561-21 at 12 (IPP for SA), 566-21 at 15 (IPP for DB), 579-15 at 12 (IPP for CW); see also 103-1 \nat 16, 165-1 at 12, 172-1 at 14, 180-1 at 13, 185-1 at 11 (redacted IPPs).  \n224.  Nevertheless, every Arkansas community provider who testified at trial stated that their \norganizations serve individuals with behavioral issues in settings that are more integrated than \nCHDC.

CHDC Teams Use Residents’ Medical Needs As an Inappropriate \nBarrier to Placement in a More Integrated Setting. \n229.  Similarly, CHDC interdisciplinary teams inappropriately raise residents’ medical \nneeds/physical health issues as barriers to potential placement in a more integrated setting.  \nRichardson Tr. 601:2-8.  Individuals with developmental disabilities and significant health needs \ncan live in the community with appropriate supports.  Richardson Tr. 574:22-25.   \n230.  In her 40 years of work with individuals with developmental disabilities, community \nplacement expert Richardson has met many individuals with developmental disabilities, like \nthose CHDC residents described below, who have significant medical needs but live in more \nintegrated community settings.

Expert Richardson had the opportunity during her tour of more integrated settings outside \nCHDC to meet a woman with developmental disabilities who had considerable physical \nlimitations and needed help with all aspects of her daily living, but was living in an \napartment/group home as part of the ACS waiver program.  Richardson Tr. 575:4-14, 575:22-23.   \nThis individual’s limitations included the need for a special lift to transfer her from a bed to a \nchair, a special arrangement for bathing and assistance from other individuals for eating and \ndressing.

CHDC Individual Program Plans Fail To Provide Specific \nInformation Regarding What an Individual Would Need To \nTransfer out of CHDC. \n \n239.  CHDC IPPs fail to provide a description of what a resident actually needs to live in an \nintegrated setting, beyond a generic list of services.  Richardson Tr. 529:2-9, 550:5-551:11.  \nEven when IPPs have useful information, there is no application of this information that would \n64 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 70 of 318\nassist the team, resident, or guardian with understanding how the resident could move to an \nappropriate, more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. 580:20-581:5.  \n240.  Most CHDC plans do not include, for example, specifically what type of specialized \nmedical care or behavioral health intervention the individual would need, what kind of specialist \nwould be required, or what type of and how often transportation might be necessary.  Richardson \nTr. 550:7-24, 551:1-11 (testifying that one would expect to see these elements in a program \nplan).  \n241.  CHDC staff corroborated this assessment.  CHDC program coordinator Donna Clendenin \ntestified that CHDC IPPs do not identify the specific barriers to a resident’s placement in a more \nintegrated setting and do not provide a plan to overcome those barriers.  Clendenin Tr. 1608:3-\n1609:10.    \n242.  CHDC program coordinator Sarah Murphy also stated that CHDC residents’ IPPs do not \nidentify the extent to which a person needs any given service.  Murphy Tr. 483:16-484:7, \n486:13-487:14. \n243.  Furthermore, program coordinator Donna Clendenin testified that CHDC program \ncoordinators do not contact community providers to determine whether they are able to provide \nservices that meet the specific needs of an individual.  Clendenin Tr. 1608:3-1612:22, 1610:19-\n1612:22; 1614:17-1616:2.   \n244.  CHDC guardian Mr. Barry Landen testified that CHDC has never discussed a specific \nfacility or placement with him.

CHDC Discharge/Transition Plans Fail To Identify the Specific \nSupports and Services an Individual Would Need in the \nCommunity or Describe Community Placement Options. \n245.  IPPs fail to describe the community options available to an individual or identify the \nspecific supports and services the individual would need in the community.  Richardson Tr. \n580:18-581:5, 581:23-582:11. \n246.  Instead, each IPP only contains a generic transition plan that includes a “canned” list of \ngeneral services the individual might need in the community such as medical care, dental \nservices, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and/or speech therapy. Richardson Tr. 550:5-\n15; Bland Tr. 882:8-17 (redacted CHDC IPPs are repetitive); Vire Tr. 1527:2-10 (IPPs “seemed \nto be a template”); Alberding Tr. 1370:4-14 (transition plan sections of IPPs are a “canned” list \nof what teams conclude residents need); see also US FOF ## 79, 80, and 82  (CHDC program \nplans must be individualized).    \n247.  The repetition and lack of individualization in CHDC IPPs are self-evident.  Further \nreview of individual plans demonstrates that they generally repeat the same, often identical, \ndischarge services.  Richardson 529:2-9; US FOF ## 248-263.  Of the 15 discharge/transition \nservice plans described below, all 15 require “direct care/supervision (24-hour basis),” access to \nemergency care, medical services, dietary services, dental services, day programming, \ntransportation, and recreation/leisure services.  US FOF ## 248-262.  Eleven plans require a \ncommunication facilitator. US FOF ## 249-252, 255-261.  Nine require psychiatric services.  US \nFOF ## 249, 250, 253, 254, 257-261.

CHDC Fails To Annually Re-Assess Residents’ \nDischarge/Transition Plans.  \n267.  CHDC policy requires treatment teams to evaluate annually each individual’s eligibility \nfor CHDC, including whether the individual’s needs could be met in a more integrated setting.  \nDefs. Ex. 912 at 170 (DDS Policy 1086); see also Porter v. Knickrehm, 457 F.3d 794, 797 (8th \nCir. 2005). \n268.  CHDC fails to conduct this assessment in some cases and instead simply uses the same \ndischarge/transition plan from year to year.  See US FOF ## 79, 80, and 82 (responsibilities of \nIDT and annual review meeting).  This is further evidence that CHDC program plans are generic \nand formulaic.  Richardson Tr. 529:2-9.  It also demonstrates that CHDC teams fail to find or \nplan for more integrated settings for CHDC residents.  Richardson Tr. 572:1-9; US Exs. 143 and \n143-2.  \n269.  For example, 22 year-old JW’s 2008 transition/discharge plan is identical to his 2009 \ntransition/discharge plan.  Richardson Tr. 571:17-25; US Exs. 143 at 12, 143-2 at 14.  Although \nJW’s guardian expressed some interest in a more integrated setting, US Ex. 272, CHDC has \n71 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 77 of 318\nfailed to make any active effort to find such a setting or create a plan for placement for him.  \nRichardson Tr. 572:1-9; US Exs. 143, 143-2.  \n270.  Similarly, there is no difference between ten year-old T.C.’s 2007 and 2008 \ndischarge/transition plans.  Richardson Tr. 568:21-23; US Exs. 191 at 17, and 191-2 at 17.  This \nis particularly concerning because of the destructive effects of childhood institutionalization and \nthe risks of long term institutionalization.  Richardson Tr. 548:5-17, 568:24-569:3; US Exs. 191 \nat 18, 191-2 at 17; see US FOF ## 34-37 (expert Matson testimony regarding effects of \nchildhood institutionalization).   \n271.  TC’s IPP states that his behavior was improving, and that an improvement in behavior \nwas required for discharge.  US Ex. 191-2 at 3, 18.  It also states that his grandmother is \nconsidering taking care of him.  US Exs. 191 at 17, 191-2 at 17.  Despite these significant \nchanges in TC's circumstances, his IPP was unchanged.  Richardson Tr. 568:21-23; US Exs. 191 \nat 17, 191-2 at 18.  It does not state what is being done to prepare supports for his grandmother \nso that an eventual discharge could be successful.  Richardson Tr. 563: 9-16; US Ex. 191-2 at 3, \n18.    \n272.  RC is a 15-year-old female.  She was admitted to CHDC at the age of 12 and is in the \ncustody of the Division of Child and Family Services.  US Exs. 181, 181-2.  Her 2008 and 2009 \ntransition plans are identical.  US Exs. 181, 181-2; Clendenin Tr. 1633:12-1636:4.  Her IPP lists \nher as having a mild intellectual disability.  US Ex. at 181-2.   \n273.  RW is a 48-year-old male who has resided at CHDC since he was 10 years old.  US Exs. \n178, 178-2.  Despite assertions that IPPs became more detailed between 2009 and 2010, RW’s \ndischarge/transition plan remained identical during those years.  US Exs. 178, 178-2; Clendenin \nTr. 1598:15-1602:11.   \n72 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 78 of 318\nviii.  CHDC Interdisciplinary Teams Identify Long Range Goals and \nSignificant Needs in CHDC Individual Program Plans That Are \nBiased Towards Continued Institutionalization. \n274.  CHDC IPPs also fail to prepare individual residents for discharge by establishing long \nrange goals or significant needs for residents that are not individualized and act as barriers to \nconsideration for a more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. 585:4-11, 610:20-611:1.   \n275.  CHDC IPPs long range goals are not geared toward individuals’ eventual independence \nand/or discharge, despite CHDC’s policy that “increased competence/independence in \nsuccessfully less restrictive settings” is the “foundation for all decisions regarding services” and \n“[t]he annual review is driven by th[is] belief.”  US FOF ## 79, 80, 82 (requirements of CHDC \nIPP policy). \n276.  For example, many CHDC IPPs contain similar long range goals that indicate, both \nexplicitly and implicitly, that the individual resident will remain at CHDC.

Other CHDC individual program plans contain boilerplate goals that are impersonal, not \nindividualized, and are not needs that require continuing institutionalization.

For example, SLA’s IPP lists her long range goals as having three self-help skills by 2013 \nand identifying 6 functional items by 2012.  Id.  In assessing these goals, expert Toni Richardson \nstated: \nWell, for the year 2013, her long-range goal is to have three self-care skills \nindependently. That’s – that certainly might be a goal, but is that the important goal for \nthis person? Are there goals around making friends, having contacts in her community? \nThose are the kind of things I would look for in personal long-range goals, something that \nwas really going to make her life more meaningful, because, in my experience, self-care \nskills, while important and while you want to work on them, I don't think most people \nwant to spend a lifetime on tooth brushing or pulling on their shirt or whatever, combing \ntheir hair. And it’s one of those skills that if you can teach it to the person, teach it; if you \ncan’t, work around it, in my way of thinking.   \n \nRichardson Tr. 582:16-583:4; see also US Exs. 186 at 12 (IPP for SH), 121 at 13 (IPP for CA), \n132 at 17 (IPP for HB), 149 at 14 (IPP for LR), 153 at 21 (IPP for LW), 146-1 at 12, 160 at 17 \n(IPP for ME), 191 at 19 (2007 IPP for TC), 191-2 at 19 (2008 IPP for TC),  562-3 at 13 (IPP for \nMB), 184 at 14 (IPP for SLA),  202-2 at 14 (IPP for WC), 101-1 at 17, 113-1 at 13, 129-1 at 11, \n131-1 at 14, 136-1 at 17, 139-1 at 13, 167-1 at 15, 172-1 at 16, 187-1 at 13 (redacted IPPs). \n290.  The community services providers who reviewed redacted CHDC IPPs noted that CHDC \nIPPs long range goals were not geared toward individuals’ eventual independence and/or \ndischarge.  See US FOF ## 79, 80, 82 (requirements of CHDC IPP policy). \n291.  For example, when discussing US Ex. 163-1 (redacted IPP), community provider Pam \nBland of First Step testified that she was unsure as to what outcome the interdisciplinary team \nsought to achieve through the long range goals.  Bland Tr.  880:6-24 (“If that person acquires \nthose social behaviors that allow them to follow a daily routine, what would the outcome be? \nWould the outcome be that they are back at home, back in the community, back in the public \nschool?”).  Provider Bland testified that “an overall goal for a person with these skills is for them \nto live independently in a group home or in their own apartment and have a job.”  Bland Tr. \n75 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 81 of 318\n881:11-15; US Ex. 148-1 at 14 (skills include naming shapes, cutting with scissors, \nreading/writing the alphabet and ability to print name).  \n292.  Community services provider ICM could serve an individual whose long term goal was \ninappropriately geared toward CHDC, and not toward a more independent community setting.  \nAlberding Tr 1360:7-1362:20; US Ex. 156-1 at 15 (long range goals listed as: “By 2012, I will \nexpand my skills in discrimination/identifying items in order to function more effectively in my \nhome at CHDC.  By 2012, I will expand my self-help skills in order to function more effectively \nin my home at CHDC.”); see also Vire Tr. 1533:14-1536:14 (individual in question has the long \nrange goal of remaining at CHDC); US Ex. 143-1 at 14 (“I will perform activities of daily living \non a level that will allow me to function more independently in my living environment during the \nnext 3-5 years.”). \n293.  When CHDC interdisciplinary teams include objectives such as tooth brushing and \nmoney management in CHDC program plans, they neglect goals that make an individual \nresident’s life “more personal, more normal, less restrictive, more integrated . . . life isn’t all \nabout skill programs.”  Richardson Tr. 698:10-21, 583:8-13 (“reading the plans and looking at \nthe policy, it looks like people generally are asked to find a goal in money management.  I think \nevery single person I read had a goal in money management or around medication \nadministration.  Everybody had some kind of a goal around medication administration, whether \nit looked like they really had some potential to do it or some interest in doing it.”). \n294.  Further examples include the IPP of TN which lists participating in a gardening activity, \nidentifying five colors, and holding money for 60 seconds among his significant needs.  Weaver \nTr. 392:4-392:20; US Ex. 160.   \n76 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 82 of 318\n295.  The interdisciplinary team for CHDC resident ZS, identified organizing his closet, \nmaking his bed, identifying combinations of coins, and matching textures as some of his \nsignificant needs.  Weaver Tr. 393:6-393:11, 396:11-397:2; US Exs. 206, JW-3.   \n296.  The interdisciplinary team for CHDC resident JN identified his significant needs as \nperforming a laundry task more independently, weighing paper on a scale, working for long \nperiods without stopping, returning to work after a distraction, matching coins, and tearing \nperforated paper more independently, among others.  Murphy Tr. 484:11-484:22; US Ex. 134-2.   \n297.  The interdisciplinary team for WC identified some of his significant needs as weighing \npaper on a scale, arriving to work on time, and improving his teeth-brushing skills.  Murphy Tr. \n494:14-23; US Ex. 202-2. \n298.  RD’s IPP lists significant needs such as “wash hands independently” and “match coins.”  \nUS Ex. 179 at 12. \nF.  Defendants’ Failure To Provide Objective, Reasonable Assessments Deprives \nIndividuals and Guardians of Information Sufficient To Make Informed \nChoices About Community Placement. \n299.  Without the benefit of an independent, objective assessment based on the individual’s \nneeds, individuals and their guardians are denied sufficient information about the resources, \npossibilities, and benefits associated with a more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. 555:21-\n556:7; see also US FOF ## 79, 82 (CHDC program plans should be specific to an individuals’ \nlong range goals, behavioral objectives, and service objectives and should address how these \nobjectives can be achieved in the least restrictive environment.).    \n300.  Only with an objective, reasonable assessment, and an opportunity to discuss particular \nalternatives to continued institutionalization based on the individual’s strengths and needs, can \n77 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 83 of 318\nresidents or guardians make an informed choice as to whether they wish to pursue a more \nintegrated setting or not.  Richardson Tr. 618:1-6.   \n301.  When the individuals who work with residents every day are not informed regarding the \nsupports and services available in the community and the potential benefits of a more integrated \nenvironment, then guardians and residents are apt to walk away with an inaccurate impression of \nwhat the life of their loved one would be like in a more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. \n616:23-617:13, 618:1-6.   \n302.  Guardians and residents who have experienced long term residential care are often \nreticent regarding the possibility of placement in a more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. \n608:19-22.  However, they are also positive about placement in a more integrated setting once \nthey have that experience.  Richardson Tr. 608:19-609:5; see Richardson Tr. 609:6-10 (research \nsupports this conclusion).      \n303.  When individuals and their guardians do not have information about what options are \navailable and what is possible, then they are unlikely to state that they would like to try a more \nintegrated setting than CHDC.  Richardson Tr. 608:9-18, 617:22-618:4 (Residents, guardians and \ndecision-makers “need a good, solid objective view.  Even though it might be painful to hear \nbecause they don’t want to think about leaving, it’s important that they know what well-informed \nprofessionals think is possible.”); see also Richardson Tr. 616:23-617:13 (noting that guardians \nrely on staff for information about the day-to-day life of residents).   \n304.  Before ever attending the annual review or receiving any assessment or recommendation \nfrom the IDT regarding whether their loved one is appropriate for a more integrated setting, \nCHDC guardians are required to complete a “choice form,” on which they identify whether they \nare seeking waiver services or HDC services.  Defs Ex. 406 (Choice Form); A. Green Tr. \n78 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 84 of 318\n 6777:24-6778:8, 6800:1-9.  Prior to being asked to designate their choice on this form, the only \ninformation guardians receive is a list of nearby community providers and the services they \nprovide, and a general informational packet about the Waiver process.  Murphy Tr. 501:15-\n502:17.  CHDC social service workers do not discuss with guardians what waiver services are \nuntil after they have made their choice between HDC or waiver services.  Green Tr. 6799:3-\n6800:8. \n305.  Furthermore, CHDC social worker supervisor Angela Green also admitted that “as \nCHDC is notified of vacancies in alternative placements close to family/guardian, they’ll inform \nthe residents, families of the vacancy.  When interest is expressed, the resident, family, or \nguardian are encouraged to tour and talk with staff at the placement.”  A. Green Tr. 838:11-17; \nRichardson Tr. 556:17-21; US Ex. 264.  \n306.  CHDC’s five team leaders confirmed that CHDC does not talk to its residents and \nfamilies about waiver except to let them know that waiver exists.  Richardson Tr. 555:23-556:7.   \n307.  Testimony from CHDC parents and guardians confirms that they are not properly \ninformed regarding community placement and more integrated settings appropriate for CHDC \nresidents.  CHDC guardian Michael Black testified that CHDC teams have mentioned the waiver \noption but did not explain to him specific services like EPSDT and wrap-around services.  M. \nBlack Tr. 6830:21-23 (“Q. Does CHDC speak to you about waiver options at the IPP meeting?  \nA: They mention them, yes.”), 6838:1-11.  As a result, Mr. Black did not know of any alternate \nplacements because it was his understanding that “there aren’t any.” M. Black Tr. 6840:3-14.  \n308.  Mr. Black stated that if an alternate placement was available, he would consider it.  M. \nBlack Tr. 6840:11-14. \n79 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 85 of 318\n309.  CHDC guardian Larry Taylor testified that he would love to see [C] “in a little home in \nHillcrest” but that his belief is that “it’s not going to happen.”  L. Taylor Tr. 5075:11-14; see US \nFOF # 117 (Community providers can provide services for majority of individuals at CHDC). \n310.  CHDC guardian Earline Stoddard testified that CHDC did not tell her that community \nservice providers offered total care.  E. Stoddard Tr.  3254:5-8; see US FOF # 232 (CHDC \nguardian testified that CHDC never discussed specific facility or placement). \n311.  CHDC annual review meetings, which provide an opportunity for team members, \nresidents, and guardians to discuss the assessments memorialized in the IPP, provide little or no \ndiscussion of the most integrated setting unless such discussion is requested by the guardian. \nRichardson Tr. 549:11-18.  The IDT teams, observed by expert Richardson during two annual \nreview meetings, mentioned the waiver program and referenced community life but did not \nactually discuss the barriers to placement in a more integrated setting or how the individual \nresident could benefit from placement in a more integrated setting.  Richardson Tr. 607:1-12; see  \nRichardson Tr. 549:11-18. \n312.  In one annual review, expert Richardson observed that the discussion of community \noptions was brief and almost apologetic.  Richardson Tr. 549:15-550:4 (“I know we have to talk \nabout this again this year, but . . . .”).  In the other meeting, when the CHDC resident was asked \nfor his input, he stated, “I would like to get a home,” but the rest of the meeting focused on why \nhe was going to remain at CHDC.  Richardson Tr. 549:15-550:-4.  The team added that “if you \nbehave and if you learn your skills, then maybe someday we’ll be able to find a home for you.” \nRichardson Tr. 550:1-4; see US FOF ## 225-228 (CHDC’s use of behavioral improvement as a \nbarrier to community placement). \n80 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 86 of 318\n313.  Absent discussion about the possibilities and benefits of placement in a more integrated \nsetting, guardians are not given appropriate information about what may be possible for each \nindividual.  Richardson Tr. 607:15-17 (“I don’t know how else you decide what the least \nrestrictive, most integrated setting would be for somebody unless you talk about what would be \npossible.”). \n314.  Defense psychiatric consultant Andrew Warren sat in on one annual IPP meeting.  He \ndescribed the way the team addressed community placement issues with the guardian as “I think \nit was mentioned that we have to say this to you . . . .”.  Warren Tr.4810:14-4811:8.  He saw no \nindication of an independent professional assessment about community placement.  Warren \nTr.4810:14-4811:8. \n315.  Erline Stoddard is the mother and guardian of a longtime CHDC resident.  Stoddard Tr. \n3230:17-25-3231:1.  Ms. Stoddard testified that at her son’s annual IPP reviews, the IDT does \nnot provide her with information about providers that offer the specific services her son would \nneed to be supported in the community, Stoddard Tr. 3253:5-3254:8, 3259:7-12, nor does the \nIDT make a recommendation regarding the most integrated setting appropriate to her son’s \nneeds, once Ms. Stoddard informs them she is not interested in pursuing community placement. \nStoddard Tr. 3243:8-10. \n316.  Larry Taylor, guardian of a longtime CHDC resident, testified that the discussion of \ncommunity placement options for his sister at her annual reviews consists of the IDT asking him, \n“do you think [C] would be happier somewhere else?  Do you want to explore other options?”   \nL. Taylor Tr. 5075:3-10. \n317.  Barry Landon is the brother and guardian of a longtime CHDC resident.  He testified that \nthe IDT asks him during annual reviews if he would like to discuss waiver options and that when \n81 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 87 of 318\nhe says, “no,” that is the end of the discussion regarding his brother’s appropriateness for a more \nintegrated setting.  Landon Tr. 6857:19-6858:2.  Nevertheless, Mr. Landon’s brother is capable \nof regular home visits in Mr. Landon’s home and has never experienced an emergency or major \nproblem during these visits.  Landon Tr. 6860:3-9.  The IDT does not raise particular placement \noptions with Mr. Landon, Landon Tr. 6858:3-10, even though Mr. Landon testified that such \ninformation would be useful and he would want to have it.

The ADA Requires Defendants to Provide CHDC Residents with Objective, \nReasonable Assessments Regarding Whether They Are Appropriate for a \nMore Integrated Setting. \nDefendants are discriminating against individuals at CHDC by failing to ensure that they \nare serving them in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, in violation of the \nADA.  Congress enacted the ADA “to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for \nthe elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities,” and “to assure equality of \nopportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for [individuals \nwith disabilities].” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(7) and (b)(1).  In doing so, Congress emphasized that \n“historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite \nsome improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue \nto be a serious and pervasive social problem.”  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).   \n  Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination in access to public services by requiring that \n“no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, \nor be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  The ADA \nimplementing regulations include an “integration mandate.”  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) ( “A \npublic entity shall administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting \nappropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.”).  The regulations define the \nmost integrated setting as “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with \nnon-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35 app. A.     \n83 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 89 of 318\n  In Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), the Supreme Court held that unjustified \nsegregation of persons with disabilities in institutions like CHDC constitutes the type of \ndiscrimination Title II of the ADA prohibits.  In doing so, the Court emphasized that when \nCongress enacted the ADA, it explicitly recognized as a form of discrimination the “unjustified \n‘segregation’ of persons with disabilities.”  Id. at 600.  The Court reasoned that this recognition \nreflected two judgments by Congress about the serious harm that unnecessary isolation causes \nindividuals: \nFirst, institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from \ncommunity settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated \nare incapable or unworthy of participating in community life.  Second, \nconfinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of \nindividuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic \nindependence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment. \n  \nId. at 600-01 (citations omitted).  In construing the integration mandate, the Court held that a \nviolation is established if the institutionalized individual is “qualified” for community placement, \nthat is, if he or she can “handle or benefit from community settings” and does not oppose \ncommunity placement.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 601-03.2   \nIn Olmstead, the plaintiffs were two institutionalized individuals who wanted to move to \nthe community and whose treating professionals agreed that community placement was \nappropriate.  Id. at 602-03.  Thus, the fact that the plaintiffs were “qualified” for a more \nintegrated setting was not in dispute.  Id.  In the context of the facts before it, the Court \nacknowledged that a state could generally rely on “the reasonable assessments of its own \n                                                 \n2   The state, however, may assert an affirmative defense that serving a particular individual \nin the most integrated setting would “entail a ‘fundamenta[l] alter[ation]’ of [its] services and \nprograms.”  Id. at 603 (plurality opinion) (first two alterations in original). \n84 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 90 of 318\nprofessionals” to determine “whether an individual ‘meets the essential eligibility requirements’ \nfor habilitation in a community-based program.”  Id. at 602 (emphasis added).    \nSubsequent cases have emphasized, however, that “Olmstead does not allow States to \navoid the integration mandate by failing to require professionals to make recommendations \nregarding the service needs of institutionalized individuals with mental disabilities.”  Frederick \nL. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 157 F. Supp. 2d 509, 540 (E.D. Pa. 2001); Long v. Benson, No. \n08cv26, 2008 WL 4571904, at *2 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 14, 2008) (noting that the State “cannot deny \nthe right [to an integrated setting] simply by refusing to acknowledge that the individual could \nreceive appropriate care in the community”); see also Disability Advocates, Inc. v. Paterson, \n653 F. Supp. 2d 184, 259 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (recognizing that violations of the ADA’s integration \nmandate are not limited to where the State’s own professionals have determined an individual is \nappropriate for a more integrated setting); Joseph S. v. Hogan, 561 F. Supp. 2d 280, 291 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2008) (same).  Such perverse results would render the integration mandate virtually \nmeaningless.  Therefore, for a public entity, such as CHDC, to aver that it is “administer[ing] \nservices, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), it must provide an objective, \nreasonable assessment of whether the individual can “handle or benefit from community \nsettings.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. 601-02.   \nAn assessment is not an objective determination of an individual’s capability of residing \nin a more integrated setting if it is only conducted when an individual or guardian affirmatively \nseeks community services.  Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., 562 F. Supp. 2d 294, 329, 338 \n(D. Conn. 2008) (rejecting the notion that an assessment of individuals’ appropriateness for \ncommunity placements is required only in those cases “in which a class member, a parent, or a \n85 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 91 of 318\nguardian has explicitly asked for community placement” and finding that “[s]uch an attitude is \ninconsistent with the integration mandate of the ADA.”).  Nor should clinical assessments of \nwhether an individual could be supported in a more integrated setting be limited to consideration \nof what is currently available in the community.  Id. at 330 (IDTs should consider community \nplacement for residents “‘without consideration of availability of resources.’”) (quoting \ntestimony of defense consultant Dr. Walsh); see also US FOF ## 85 (Defendants’ consultant \nKastner testifying that a treatment team’s determination regarding the most appropriate setting \nfor a resident should be separate from the guardian’s decision about placement), 86 (Defendants’ \nconsultant Walsh testifying that availability of services should not be a bar to a recommendation \nfor community placement).   \nRather, an objective, reasonable assessment must be based on the individual’s needs and \nconsideration of the services necessary to meet those needs.  An individual must be provided the \noption of a particular alternative to continued institutionalization based on an objective, \nreasonable assessment.  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A (“[P]ersons with disabilities must be provided \nthe option of declining to accept a particular accommodation.”); Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 338 \n(The ADA “regulations do not conceive of a resident’s option to decline community placement \nas a right that is to be exercised before any professional judgment has been brought to bear.  \nRather, the regulations state that ‘persons with disabilities must be provided the option of \ndeclining to accept a particular accommodation.’”).   \n86 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 92 of 318\nB.  Defendants Discriminate Against Individuals at CHDC By Depriving Them \nObjective, Reasonable Assessments Regarding Whether They Are \nAppropriate for a More Integrated Setting. \n CHDC interdisciplinary teams discriminate against individuals at CHDC by failing to \nprovide individuals and their guardians with objective, reasonable assessments of whether they \ncan live in a more integrated setting, in violation of the ADA.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12213; \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 602.  Instead, CHDC treatment teams routinely \nconclude that CHDC is the most integrated setting for individuals, except when a guardian \nproactively – but without the benefit of an independent assessment and recommendation – \nrequests community placement.  In this way, individuals and their guardians are deprived of the \nbenefit of an independent judgment about the resident’s appropriateness for a more integrated \nsetting, including the opportunity to meaningfully discuss what services and supports the \nindividual would receive in the community. \nCHDC’s failure to provide objective, reasonable assessments harms CHDC residents \nboth individually and systemically.  As discussed in Section C below, CHDC deprives individual \nresidents and guardians of the benefit of the treating professionals’ objective, reasonable \nassessment of whether the resident could handle or benefit from community placement, \nincluding the opportunity to meaningfully discuss what services and supports the individual \nwould receive in the community.  See also US FOF # # 91-317.  This encourages individual \nguardians to maintain the status quo of continued institutionalization, the setting in which their \nloved ones already receive services and with which the guardians are most familiar.  See \nMessier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 333; US FOF ## 303-305.   \nAdditionally, so long as CHDC does not assess individuals to determine what supports \nand services they would need to be supported in the community, community providers cannot \n87 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 93 of 318\ndevelop the capacity, and tailor the services they provide, to meet the needs of those currently \ninstitutionalized.  Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 339 (“Having failed to learn how many class \nmembers could or should be placed in the community, the defendants failed to develop resources \nfor placing class members.”); US FOF ## 89, 186.    \nThe harmful, discriminatory effects of CHDC’s failure to conduct objective, reasonable \nassessments of residents are reflected by the extreme length of stay for most individuals at \nCHDC, the increasing number of children being admitted to CHDC, and how few individuals are \never discharged from CHDC.  US FOF ## 23-33.  In fact, more individuals die at CHDC than are \ndischarged.  US FOF # 29.  By failing to conduct objective, reasonable assessments, CHDC \nensures the perpetuation of a discriminatory and unlawful method of delivering services to \nindividuals with developmental disabilities, where institutionalization is the default option, in \nviolation of the ADA.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (the ADA mandates that public entities “administer \nservices, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \nqualified individuals with disabilities”); Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 337 (“The ADA’s \npreference for integrated settings is not consistent with a procedure in which remaining \n[institutionalized] is the default option for residents.”). \n1)  CHDC Teams Fail To Find That Any Residents Can Be Served in More \nIntegrated Settings Unless a Guardian Affirmatively Requests Or \nExpresses Interest in Community Placement. \nCHDC treatment teams fail to conduct independent clinical assessments of individuals \nand, instead, routinely conclude that CHDC is the least restrictive setting appropriate for \nindividuals unless a guardian has affirmatively requested or otherwise expressed an interest in \ncommunity placement.  Indeed, the only four individuals that CHDC identified at the time of the \n88 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 94 of 318\ntrial as having their IDTs determine that they were appropriate for a more integrated setting were \nthe same four individuals that CHDC identified as having expressed an interest in community \nplacement.  US FOF # 93.  In other words, CHDC IDTs did not conclude that a single resident is \nappropriate for a more integrated setting – except for those whose guardians had already \nrequested community placement.  Additionally, longtime CHDC staff testified that they could \nrecall few, if any, instances where an IDT determined that an individual was appropriate for a \nmore integrated setting when a guardian had not explicitly expressed interest in pursuing, or at \nleast affirmatively supported, a more integrated setting.  See US FOF ##105-113.   \nIn stark contrast to CHDC’s identification of only 4 of its over 500 residents – less than 1 \npercent of its total population – as appropriate for a more integrated setting, community service \nproviders from throughout Arkansas confirmed that they can serve the overwhelming majority of \nthe individuals described in the 46 sample IPPs they reviewed.  US FOF ## 115-147.  This is \nconsistent with the testimony of the United States’ expert, and further evidence that CHDC has \nabdicated its duty to conduct objective, reasonable assessments of individuals at CHDC in \nviolation of the ADA.  Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 337-38; Frederick L., 157 F. Supp. 2d at 540; \nLong, 2008 WL 4571904, at *2; see US FOF ## 92-99.   \n2)  Treatment Teams at CHDC Do Not Have Sufficient Knowledge or \nTraining About Community Integration to Make Reasonable \nRecommendations Regarding the Most Integrated Setting Appropriate \nfor Individuals at CHDC. \n  CHDC interdisciplinary teams are composed of individuals who, by their own \nadmissions, do not have sufficient knowledge or training regarding community services, options, \nand benefits.  Therefore, they are incapable of providing objective, reasonable assessments, in \nviolation of the ADA.  CHDC team leaders, program coordinators, psychology staff, and even \n89 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 95 of 318\nthe Superintendent and Director of Social Services, all have a profound lack of understanding \nabout what services are available in the community, what skills an individual needs to be eligible \nfor a community placement, and what benefits there are to community living.  For example, the \nDirector of Social Services is the CHDC staff member considered to be most knowledgeable \nabout community placement services, as well as the person responsible for the training and \nsupervision of the staff members who are directly responsible for providing community \nplacement information to parents and families.  US FOF ## 63-65.  The Director is not familiar \nwith all the services available in the community, was not even aware of the existence of a DDS \nwaiver guide until April 2010 (when a community provider gave her a copy), and is unable to \nidentify independently any benefits to living in settings more integrated than CHDC, other than \nbeing able to choose where one lives.  US FOF ## 160-162.   \nOther staff members in leadership positions likewise have a pervasive lack of knowledge \nabout community placement options for individuals residing at CHDC.  US FOF ## 163-176.  \nMany have never even visited a community placement setting in Arkansas, yet they are the staff \nmembers directly responsible for ensuring that individuals at CHDC are assessed to determine \nwhether they are appropriate for a more integrated setting.  US FOF ## 163-176. \n3)  Individual Program Plans Demonstrate CHDC’s Failure to Conduct \nObjective, Reasonable Assessments of Whether Individuals Are \nAppropriate For A More Integrated Setting. \nCHDC’s individual program plans demonstrate CHDC’s failure to provide objective, \nreasonable assessments to individuals at CHDC, as well as CHDC staff’s lack of knowledge and \ntraining about community placement.  A disturbingly large proportion of CHDC IPPs identify \narbitrary barriers to community placement, such as the need to acquire routine daily living skills \n90 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 96 of 318\nor independent living skills.  See, e.g., US FOF ## 189-203.  Yet community programs that \ncurrently exist in Arkansas provide training in self-care skills and independent living skills.  See \nUS FOF ## 115-147, 153-154 and 196-198.   Therefore, as the community providers’ testimony \nconfirms, a lack of such skills does not disqualify an individual from eligibility for community \nplacement, and should not be identified in an individual’s plan as the reason he or she should \ncontinue to be deprived of the opportunity to live alongside of, and experience life with, non-\ndisabled people.  See US FOF ## 115-147, 153-154 and 196-198.   Indeed, in some cases, an \nindividual may never gain some basic daily living skills and yet could nevertheless be served in a \nmore integrated setting.  See US FOF ## 199-201.   \nSimilarly, many CHDC IPPs contain inappropriate language requiring that individuals \nadvance through the “team hierarchy” at CHDC before they can be considered for placement in a \nmore integrated setting.  US FOF ## 95, 143 and 204-214.  This concept of requiring that \nindividuals “earn” their way out of an institution is inconsistent with the ADA’s mandate that \nindividuals be served “in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \nindividuals with disabilities,” and results in the needless segregation of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); see also US FOF # 204. \nIndividuals’ behavioral and medical issues are also often listed in CHDC plans as a \nbarrier to community placement.  US FOF ## 215-238.  Many plans condition consideration for \na more integrated setting on an improvement in the individual’s behavior.  US FOF ## 215-228.  \nBut for some individuals, maladaptive behaviors are reactions to his or her environment, and \nmay not occur if the person was living in a setting more tailored to his or her individual needs.  \nUS FOF ##215-220.  This is particularly true for institutionalized children, who often observe \nand model the maladaptive behaviors that occur around them.  US FOF ## 34-37 .  In any case, \n91 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 97 of 318\ncommunity programs that currently exist in Arkansas serve individuals with all sorts of \nbehavioral health issues, including individuals who have aggressive behaviors, need 24-hour \ndirect care, and lack good judgment regarding personal safety, and are not valid bases for \ndepriving individuals of the opportunity to live in a more integrated setting.  See, e.g., US \nFOF ## 128, 130, 135, 137, 140, 142, 144, 146, 224-228.    \nLikewise, individuals with significant medical issues, for example, individuals who are \nnon-ambulatory, nonverbal, hearing impaired, blind, and who have brittle bone disease, \ndementia, and seizures, are routinely served in more integrated settings than CHDC, including \nmore integrated settings that currently exist in Arkansas.  See, e.g., US FOF ##138, 140, 142, \n147, 229-238.  The fact that so many IPPs at CHDC identify false barriers to community \nplacement, such as those discussed above, demonstrates CHDC’s failure to conduct reasonable \nassessments of individuals’ appropriateness for more integrated settings as well as CHDC’s staff \nmembers’ inability to do so. \nAdditionally, IPPs are generic and formulaic, and reflect CHDC’s overall discriminatory \nbias toward continued institutionalization and the absence of any meaningful efforts to transition \nindividuals to the community.  IPPs fail to describe what an individual would actually need to \nlive in a more integrated setting, such as what type of specialized medical care or behavioral \nhealth intervention the individual would need, or the type of transportation that would be \nnecessary.  US FOF ## 239-266.  Transition plans for individuals at CHDC are not \nindividualized.  Instead, plans include a “canned” list of general services an individual might \nneed in the community, such as medical care, dental care, and/or 24-hour emergency care -- \nmany of which are services to which everyone needs access, and not at all tailored to identifying \nwhat a specific individual at CHDC with particular disabilities would need to live successfully in \n92 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 98 of 318\na more integrated setting.  US FOF ## 245-266.   Frequently, IDTs use the same discharge plan \nfor an individual year after year, demonstrating that CHDC sets goals for discharge that \nindividuals cannot meet and, indeed, are not expected to meet.  US FOF ## 267-273.   \nLikewise, long term goals for individuals at CHDC reflect the lack of any expectation or \ngoal that individuals move to more integrated settings.  US FOF ##  277 (“By 2015, I will \ncontinue to reside at CHDC.”), 279 (“By 2012, I will have the self-help and daily living skills \nenabling me to function more independently in my present residence.”), and 284 (“I will \nestablish greater independence in daily living and personal hygiene in order to function more \neffectively in my home at CHDC during the next 5 years.”).  Goals such as these reveal \nDefendants’ discriminatory intent to preserve institutionalization as the “default option” for \nindividuals at CHDC, in violation of the ADA.  Messier, 562 F. Supp. 2d at 337; see also \nDisability Advocates, Inc., 653 F. Supp. 2d at 259 (where State considers an institutional setting \nto be individuals’ “permanent placements,” a recommendation by State professionals that \nindividuals are appropriate for community placement is not necessary to establish ADA \nviolation). \nC.  Defendants’ Failure To Provide Objective, Reasonable Assessments Deprives \nIndividuals and Guardians of Information Sufficient To Make Informed \nChoices About Community Placement. \nAs a result of CHDC’s failure to provide objective, reasonable assessments of \nindividuals’ appropriateness for a more integrated setting, individuals and guardians are deprived \nof information that is critical to their ability to make informed decisions regarding whether they \nwish to pursue community placement, or whether they would decline to accept a “particular \naccommodation.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A.  In Messier, the court criticized the state for failing \n93 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 99 of 318\nto conduct community placement assessments of individuals whose guardians responded to a \nsurvey indicating that they wanted their ward to remain in the facility.  562 F. Supp. 2d at 333-\n34.  The court explained that “neither the survey nor the cover letter gave much sense of what \nplacement options were available.  This might have encouraged respondents to ‘play it safe’ by \nindicating that they preferred their wards to remain at [the institution], the option with which \nthey were most familiar.”  Id. at 333.  The court also found that “efforts to educate guardians \nabout community placement are often successful in changing their attitudes,” and that “[a]n \nopportunity to discuss the possibility of community placement with guardians could make a \nsubstantial difference in the number of referrals for placement.”  Id. at 333, 338.  Ultimately, the \ncourt held that, “[b]y concluding from the results of the Family Survey that there is no demand \nfor community placements, the defendants may have prevented guardians and families from \nmaking informed choices.”  Id. at 338.   \nLike Messier, Defendants discriminate against individuals at CHDC by depriving them \nand their guardians of a professional recommendation regarding a particular alternative to \ncontinued institutionalization based on an objective, reasonable assessment of that individual, \nincluding the opportunity to meaningfully discuss that alternative.  CHDC guardians are, at best, \nnotified of the abstract right to pursue community placement, and then asked whether they are \n“happy” at CHDC or whether they are “interested” in further information about community \nplacements.  US FOF ## 305, 307-317.  Indeed, CHDC guardians are asked to declare, in \nwriting, a placement preference before the annual IPP review even occurs.  US FOF # 304.  \nNeither the IDT nor the individual’s social service worker discusses with guardians what a \nwaiver is in even general terms until after they have already made their choice between \ninstitution or waiver services.  US FOF # 304.   \n94 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 100 of 318\nMoreover, treatment teams do not assess or discuss in any particularized way a resident’s \nappropriateness for a more integrated setting unless a guardian explicitly, without the benefit of \nan objective, reasonable assessment of the individual’s appropriateness for a more integrated \nsetting, expresses an interest in community placement.  See US FOF ## 91-114, 305-317.  Not \ncoincidentally, the only residents that CHDC had identified at the time of trial as appropriate for \na more integrated setting are the same four individuals whose guardians explicitly requested \ncommunity placement.  US FOF # 93.   \nThis is not the scenario envisioned in the ADA’s protection of an individual’s right to \ndecline to accept a “particular accommodation.”  28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A.  Although guardians \nof long term institutional residents are often initially hesitant regarding the possibility of a more \nintegrated setting, they react more favorably to community placement once they have been \nprovided with detailed information about community options and an opportunity to speak with \ncommunity providers and visit community placements.  US FOF ## 301-303; see also Messier, \n562 F. Supp. 2d at 333 (describing expert testimony that “guardians of institutionalized wards are \ngenerally more likely to favor community placement when faced with concrete options for \nplacement than when considering the abstract possibility that their ward could live in a more \nintegrated setting”).  By denying CHDC residents and their guardians information that is critical \nto their ability to make informed decisions about whether CHDC is the most integrated setting \nappropriate to residents’ needs, Defendants safeguard a discriminatory system where CHDC \nremains the “default option” for its residents, in violation of the ADA’s integration mandate.

FINDINGS OF FACT – PROTECTION FROM HARM \n318.  CHDC subjects residents to repeated harm, and unreasonable risk of harm, by failing to \nprovide reasonably safe conditions for residents.  Standard protection from harm systems include \nprocesses to identify individuals’ risks of harm, respond to incidents of harm when they occur, \nand provide oversight of incident, injury, and staff abuse/neglect trends at an individual and \nsystemic level, to try to prevent future harm to individuals.  CHDC’s systemic failures cause \nongoing and repeated harm to residents from:  CHDC’s failure to intervene to address and \nprevent repeated injuries; CHDC’s failure to address preventable self-injurious behaviors; \nCHDC’s failure to prevent serious injuries such as fractures and lacerations from falls and other \nevents that are preventable with adequate supervision and appropriate risk and incident \nmanagement procedures; CHDC’s failure to prevent dangerous exposure to bloodborne \npathogens from other residents; staff abuse and neglect; and staff’s inappropriate and excessive \nuse of restraints.  See FOF ## 319-376.  As a result, CHDC’s protection from harm practices \nsubstantially depart from generally accepted professional standards and violate residents’ \nconstitutional rights to reasonably safe conditions.  Osgood Tr. 44:25-45:3, 46:7-47:11, 184:16-\n186:5.   \nA.  Expert Carla Jo Osgood Provided Credible Expert Testimony That CHDC’s \nSubstantial Departure from Generally Accepted Minimum Professional \nStandards of Protection from Harm Results in Harm to CHDC Residents. \n319.  Expert Osgood has approximately 20 years of experience and extensive knowledge \nregarding systems for protecting individuals with developmental disabilities from harm.  Osgood \nTr. 37:3-17, 278:11-24.  Ms. Osgood’s experience includes developing and implementing \nprotection from harm systems, evaluating between 25 and 30 protection from harm systems in at \nleast 15 states, and drafting policies and providing technical assistance for state agencies that \n97 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 103 of 318\nprovide services to individuals with developmental disabilities.  Osgood Tr. 38:13-40:12; US Ex. \n1-1. \n320.  Expert Carla Jo Osgood concluded that CHDC’s protection from harm practices \nsubstantially depart from generally accepted minimum professional standards.  She based this \nconclusion on interviews with CHDC administrative and direct care staff and residents; review \nof thousands of pages of facility documents, including all investigations for an 18-month period, \nincident and injury reports, administrative reviews of resident injuries, restraint reports, clinical \nrecords, and meeting minutes for committees charged with review of resident harm and quality \nassurance practices; observation of daily incident review meetings in all facility areas; and \nobservation of individuals throughout CHDC for approximately 10 days.  Osgood Tr. 51:21-\n54:14.  Because facilities must provide reasonably safe conditions for residents with a wide \nrange of needs, Ms. Osgood also reviewed CHDC’s identification of, response to, and preventive \naction regarding a sample of individuals who had significant and/or recurring injuries, physical \nassistance needs, or behavioral needs.  Osgood Tr. 55:4-19.     \nB.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Protection from Harm in Incident and Quality Management \nCauses Repeated Harm and Risk of Harm to Residents.   \n321.  Generally accepted professional standards require facilities to identify residents’ risks of \nharm and take action to prevent such risks, both individually and systemically.  Facilities do so \nby developing and monitoring adequate risk management plans, which incorporate the results of \na root cause analysis of any incidents of harm, including the circumstances of how incidents \noccurred and how they can be prevented in the future.  Osgood Tr. 97:9-98:22, 113:19-115:7, \n184:16-186:5. \n98 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 104 of 318\n322.  CHDC’s reporting systems and incident management systems substantially depart from \nthese generally accepted professional standards.  CHDC’s incident reporting systems are \nfragmented, and its incident management systems fail to include a root cause analysis to identify \nand respond to repeated types of injuries and repeated injuries to individuals.  Osgood Tr. \n101:14-104:25, 105:1-25, 112:13-113:18, 184:16-186:5, 298:1-15; Walsh Tr. 6020:24-6021:8; \nMiller Tr. 5035:8-5036:16; US Exs. 18, 19, 23-1, 23-2, 24 through 36.  Without accurate, \nconsistently reported data, CHDC cannot begin to address the root causes of incidents and take \naction to try to prevent future similar incidents.1  Osgood Tr. 113:19-114:14.   \n323.  CHDC’s quality management practices substantially depart from generally accepted \nprofessional standards because they inappropriately focus on staff and facility-based concerns \nunrelated to resident rights and protection, such as compliance issues related to maintaining \nfederal funding.  Osgood Tr. 46:7-47:11, 116:14-122:15, 184:16-186:5; Miller Tr. 5023:21-\n5024:11.   \n324.  CHDC’s quality management practices fail to measure resident outcomes in a number of \nimportant areas, such as restraints, abuse and neglect and other serious incidents, resident rights \nrestrictions, and ADA-required community integration. Osgood Tr. 118:25-122:15; Miller Tr. \n5027:2-25, 5028:24-5029:1.   \n325.  CHDC purports to address resident injuries through its incident review committees.  The \nCentral Incident Review Committee meeting minutes reveal, however, that a substantial \nproportion of meetings center on discussions of staff injuries, rather than resident injuries.  Miller \nTr. 5037:9-23.  Central Incident Review Committee meeting minutes reflect qualitative \n                                                 \n1   Defendants’ consultant’s review of incidents also illustrates how CHDC’s various \ndata sources yield different data for the same types of incidents, such as for choking.  Walsh Tr. \n6118:14-6119:20 (showing that one data source reported 1 choking incident and another data \nsource reported between 11 and 24).   \n99 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 105 of 318\ndiscussions of individual staff injuries only, not individual resident injuries.  Miller Tr. 5037:24-\n5038:21.  Individual team incident review committee meeting minutes rarely note follow-up \naction to be taken in response to resident injuries.  Miller Tr. 5040:5-9; US Ex. 37.   \n326.  CHDC incident review committees discuss incidents summarily without addressing either \nthe root cause of the incident or how to prevent future incidents. 2  Osgood Tr. 115:8-116:10; US \nEx. 37.  Accordingly, CHDC does not meaningfully respond to incidents to stop recurring harm \nto CHDC residents.  Osgood 114:15-115:7; US Exs. 18, 19, 23-1, 23-2, 24 through 36 (and \nsubparts), 68-1, 68-2, 68-3, 79, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 373, 374, 375, 377, 378, 379, 380, \n381, 382, 383, 462, 564-2, 564-8, 564-12, 564-14, 577-9.   \n327.  Continued institutionalization of CHDC residents exacerbates harm caused by \n“institutional behaviors,” which result when residents observe and model the other maladaptive \nbehaviors that occur around them.  Matson Tr. 1178:3-1179:18.  A crowded institutional \nenvironment such as CHDC exacerbates violent and maladaptive behaviors, resulting in ongoing \nharm to CHDC residents.   Richardson Tr. 602:16-22; Price Tr. 1682:6-15.  Compounding this \nproblem, CHDC staff do not promptly re-evaluate and update the behavioral plans of individuals \nfor whom plans have been shown ineffective.  Matson Tr. 1084:12-1085:25; Manikam Tr. \n3142:8-3145:3 (detailing how delays result in non-alignment of assessments and treatment); see, \ne.g., US Exs. 564-1, 564-26, 567-1, 578-31, 580-1, 701-1 through 701-6.    \n328.  As a result of systemic deficiencies, CHDC residents suffer ongoing, repeated harm and \nrepeated risk of harm.  CHDC’s own documents show that CHDC has failed and continues to fail \n                                                 \n2   Incident review committee meetings include only cursory reviews of incidents, as \nincident review committees typically run through an average of 20 to 30 incidents per hour \nmeeting, spending only 1.5 to 3 minutes discussing each incident.  Clendenin Tr. 1571:21-\n1574:9; see also Murphy Tr. 460:2-8 (incident review committee meetings typically last roughly \n45 minutes). \n \n100 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 106 of 318\nto protect residents from repeated harm caused by:  staff abuse/neglect (US Exs. 44, 45, 46, 48 \nthrough 52, 54 through 59, 61); staff failure to implement appropriate behavior plans to address \ninjuries from other residents (US Exs. 24, 24-1 through 24-39, 25, 25-1 through 25-125, 26, 26-1 \nthrough 26-52, 27, 27-1 through 27-55, 28, 28-1 through 28-31, 29, 29-1 through 29-19, 32, 32-1 \nthrough 32-16, 35, 35-1 through 35-35, 36, 36-1 through 36-19); dangerous exposure to \nbloodborne pathogens from other residents (US Exs. 23-1, 23-2, 24, 24-1 through 24-39, 26, 26-\n1 through 26-52, 27, 27-1 through 27-55, 28, 28-1 through 28-31, 29, 29-1 through 29-19, 35, \n35-1 through 35-35, 36, 36-1 through 36-19); staff failure to address preventable self-harm (US \nExs. 29, 29-1 through 29-19, 30, 30-1 through 30-29); staff’s inappropriate and excessive use of \nrestraints (US Exs. 27, 27-1 through 27-55, 29, 29-1 through 29-19, 39-1 through 39-8, 49, 2010, \n2016); and serious injuries such as fractures and lacerations from falls and other events that can \nbe prevented by adequate supervision and appropriate risk and incident management procedures. \nUS Exs. 24, 24-1 through 24-39, 25, 25-1 through 25-125, 26, 26-1 through 26-52, 29, 29-1 \nthrough 29-19.3 \n329.  For example,  CHDC documents reveal that resident ME lived at CHDC for 42 years \nbefore dying there at age 48 from respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia.  See Price Tr. \n6883:21-6884:5.  CHDC’s own documents show that ME suffered numerous injuries, assaults, \nand staff neglect over a representative 2-year time period of June 2007 to August 2009.  CHDC \nfailed to intervene with adequate treatment and behavior plan implementation for residents who \nrepeatedly hit, bit, pushed, and scratched ME at least 20 times.  CHDC did not adequately \n                                                 \n3   At trial, in response to Defendants’ objection to the United States’ summary \nExhibits 24 through 36, the Court determined that the United States could use these summary \nexhibits in these post-trial filings, so that Defendants could have additional time to review the \nsummaries and compare them to the underlying documents (the subparts of United States \nExhibits 24 through 36), which the Court admitted at trial.  Osgood Tr. 190:8-197:3. \n101 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 107 of 318\nsupervise ME, and eventually discovered him engaged in dangerous activities on at least ten \noccasions, including one time with his feeding tube removed and seven times ingesting non-\nnutritive items such as feces, paper, and a book.  CHDC’s substandard supervision was \nparticularly dangerous for ME because of his medical orders not to receive anything by mouth \nbecause he could aspirate and develop pneumonia (his cause of his death).  As indicated by \nCHDC neurological checks and other injury documentation, ME also suffered numerous injuries \nfrom known and unknown causes, including two bruises in his genital area and at least a dozen \nknown or suspected head injuries from falls or other incidents, including at least two that resulted \nin head lacerations.  US Exs. 24, 24-1 through 24-39, 553-1. \n330.  Resident TN has resided at CHDC for more than 20 years, since he was a teenager.  \nResident TN has been the victim of at least seven substantiated maltreatment investigations, \nincluding incidents of physical and verbal abuse by staff and four incidents involving inadequate \nstaff supervision.  CHDC documents show that, over the same representative 2-year period, \nCHDC resident TN suffered at least 80 known or suspected head injuries.  These reported head \ninjuries may not represent all his injuries, as staff have failed to supervise TN at various times \ndespite his being designated for enhanced supervision.  At different times, staff have found him \nbuckled naked into a recliner with bruises to his genital area and trunk and wandering alone on \nthe grounds sidewalk when no one knew of his whereabouts while he was supposed to be under \nenhanced supervision.  US Exs. 25, 25-1 through 25-125, 553-1. \n331.  Resident NM has been at CHDC for more than 40 years.  Between July 2007 and July \n2009, CHDC staff failed to intervene with appropriate treatment and behavioral interventions for \nresidents who hit, scratched, and bit NM’s face and body nearly 20 times.  NM has been \nunnecessarily and repeatedly exposed to hepatitis B, a contagious bloodborne disease, by \n102 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 108 of 318\nCHDC’s failure to address biting by a resident known by staff to have hepatitis B.  Instead of \ntaking action to prevent this ongoing harm, CHDC staff merely noted that the individual had a \nplan to address her biting, ignoring that the plan was obviously not working.  NM also has \nsuffered injuries, including possible head injuries, from falling at least 17 times.  In September \n2007, documenting 1 of the earliest falls during this 2-year period, CHDC staff noted that NM \nhad recent falls that weekend and needed hands-on assistance at all times while walking.  \nNevertheless, NM fell at least 16 times after that acknowledgement of her needs and risk of \ninjury.  US Exs. 26, 26-1 through 26-52, 533-1. \n332.  Resident SM was admitted to CHDC at age 6 and has been there for more than 30 years.  \nCHDC documentation shows that, between June 2007 and October 2009, CHDC staff failed to \nintervene with appropriate treatment and behavioral interventions for 2 residents who bit, hit, or \nscratched SM at least 18 times.  CHDC continuously noted that “staff followed [the resident’s] \nprogram and will continue to do so,” but failed to take any action to revise the clearly ineffective \nplan.  US Exs. 32, 32-1 through 32-16, 533-1.  \n333.  CHDC also has subjected children to repeated harm that CHDC has failed to address and \nprevent.  For example, youth ZS has been stomped on while restrained on a papoose board \n(causing a footprint-shaped abrasion on his face) and has suffered bruising and scrapes from staff \nstrapping ZS onto a papoose board, contrary to Defendants’ claim that individuals have not been \ninjured in restraints.  US Exs. 27, 27-1 through 27-55.  According to CHDC documentation, from \nOctober 2007 until May 2009, CHDC staff failed to intervene with appropriate treatment and \nbehavioral interventions for youth who bit, hit, scratched, pushed, or pinched youth ZS no less \nthan 35 times.  Instead of addressing these repeated harms, staff merely noted that those \n103 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 109 of 318\nindividuals had behavior plans and staff would continue to follow them, despite that these plans \nclearly were not working.  US Exs. 27, 27-1 through 27-55. \n334.  CHDC has also allowed another CHDC youth, RD, to suffer repeated injuries from other \nCHDC residents.  CHDC staff took no action to rectify the repeated harm to RD, other than to \ncontinue to follow those individuals’ ineffective behavior plans.  Similar to youth ZS, CHDC \nallowed other residents to bite, push, or hit youth RD at least 20 times, per CHDC \ndocumentation, from June 2007 to August 2009.  Youth RD also has suffered possible head \ninjuries at least eight times, including two separate head lacerations requiring staples to close the \nwounds, as indicated by CHDC neurological checks and other CHDC documentation.  US Exs. \n28, 28-1 through 28-31. \n335.  Similarly, CHDC staff failed to intervene with appropriate treatment and behavioral \ninterventions for other youth who kicked, slapped, hit, scratched, pinched, pushed or bit youth \nHB at least 20 times from June 2007 to April 2009, according to CHDC documentation.  Again, \nCHDC staff merely noted that they were continuing to follow the individuals’ ineffective \nbehavior plans.  CHDC’s use of mechanical restraints has also injured youth HB.  After staff put \nhim in a mitten jacket, youth HB fell off a couch and, unable to break his fall, suffered a possible \nhead injury and bruised eye.  CHDC has failed to prevent other head injuries to HB.  CHDC’s \ninability to address HB’s ongoing headbutting behavior has resulted in possible head injuries at \nleast a dozen times.  US Exs. 29, 29-1 through 29-19. \n336.  CHDC has similarly failed to intervene to implement appropriate resident behavior plans \nto prevent repeated injuries to youth DK, as indicated by CHDC documentation from June 2007 \nto September 2009.  CHDC’s failure to implement appropriate behavioral interventions resulted \nin other youths biting, hitting, slapping, kicking, or scratching DK at least 40 times.  DK suffered \n104 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 110 of 318\npossible head injuries from CHDC’s repeated failures to intervene.  Again, CHDC’s only \napparent response to the continued injuries to DK by the same individuals was to keep following \nthose individuals’ ineffective behavior plans.  US Exs. 35, 35-1 through 35-35. \n337.  Similarly, CHDC documentation shows CHDC has failed to implement appropriate \nbehavioral interventions to address injuries caused by residents repeatedly biting or hitting \nCHDC youth DG at least 20 times between August 2007 and March 2009.  CHDC merely \ncontinued to note that the residents who repeatedly harmed DG had behavioral “strategies” (not \neven a full behavior plan), which staff would continue to follow, despite that these “strategies” \nclearly were failing.  US Exs. 36, 36-1 through 36-19. \n338.  CHDC uses mechanical restraints improperly in lieu of adequate assessment and \nbehavioral treatment.  Manikam Tr. 3162:21-3163:3.  For example, CHDC staff have not \ndeveloped or implemented appropriate behavioral interventions to address individuals’ repeated \nself-injurious behaviors (“SIB”).  Instead, staff have caused more injuries to these individuals by \nusing mechanical restraints instead of effective preventive measures to address individuals’ \nrepeated SIBs.  CHDC documentation shows that, from August 2007 to July 2009, CHDC youth \nTC suffered bruised and swollen eyes and numerous bruises and abrasions to his body from SIB.  \nCHDC’s use of mechanical restraints to address TC’s behaviors have caused additional injuries \nto TC - such as bruises, cuts, and scrapes - and have not addressed the underlying causes of, or \nprevented, TC’s ongoing SIB.  US Exs. 29, 29-1 through 29-19.   \n339.  Similarly, pursuant to CHDC documentation from June 2007 to March 2009, CHDC \nresident DC has repeatedly slapped and hit himself in the face, resulting in possible head injuries \nmore than 10 times.  Instead of developing a plan to address the underlying causes of this \n105 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 111 of 318\nbehavior, CHDC responded inappropriately by strapping him on a papoose board, causing DC \nadditional harm.  US Exs. 30, 30-1 through 30-44.    \n340.  Compounding the ongoing harm and risk of harm from repeated injuries, CHDC fails to \ninvestigate possible sexual abuse, even when a resident suffers suspicious injuries.  For example, \nbruising to a resident’s genital area did not prompt CHDC to investigate whether physical or \nsexual abuse caused the injury, even though the resident resides on a unit that houses residents \nwith histories of aggression and sexually inappropriate behaviors.  R. Brewer Tr. 6750:22-25, \n6752:1-22.  CHDC also failed to investigate other suspicious injuries for possible sexual abuse, \nincluding a scratch to a resident’s buttock, a bruise to a resident’s inner thigh, and a bite mark on \nanother resident’s inner thigh.  Miller Tr. 5029:18-5030:2.  For the resident whose inner thigh \nwas bitten, CHDC concluded the injury investigation by simply stating that the resident tended to \nuntruthfully blame others.  Miller Tr. 5030:3-8.   \n341.  CHDC has not conducted any sexual abuse investigations in the last five years and has \nnever conducted a sexual abuse investigation regarding a non-verbal resident, according to long-\ntime CHDC employee and quality assurance director Gail Miller.  G. Miller Tr. 5029:14-21. \nC.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Protection from Harm Regarding Abuse and Neglect by Staff \nResults in Injury and Risk of Injury to CHDC’s Residents.  \n342.  CHDC fails to take systemic action to address, or attempt to prevent the recurrence of, \nstaff’s ongoing and pervasive abuse and neglect of children and adults, sometimes at the hands of \nrepeat staff offenders.  Osgood Tr. 153:18-156:18, 171:24-172:4, 184:16-186:5, 295:16-297:1; \nUS Exs. 43 through 63.   \n106 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 112 of 318\n343.  Defendants’ own consultant, Dr. Kevin Walsh, found that CHDC’s abuse and neglect rate \nof .054 per person per year greatly exceeded the rates of comparable facilities.  Walsh Tr. \n6121:11-6122:11. \n344.  CHDC ineffectively addresses repeated CHDC staff abuse and neglect by merely \nterminating the individual staff found culpable for resident abuse and neglect, without \nconducting an analysis of frequent alleged perpetrators, frequent resident victims, types of \nincidents, where incidents are occurring, who reports incidents, and the shifts during which abuse \noccurs.  Osgood Tr. 174:13-175:3.  Instead of this analysis required by generally accepted \nprofessional standards, CHDC relies on administrative reviews and incident reviews that \ndocument incidents, but do nothing to determine the root cause of incidents and prevent future \nincidents.  Osgood Tr. 152:12-21 (incident review committee and administrative review each \nindicate that the other will review the incident, resulting in follow-up action being taken by \nneither); Weaver Tr. 311:9-326:2 (illustrating such cyclical paper processes as to resident ME), \n326:13-328:24 (illustrating cyclical paper processes as to resident ZS); Murphy Tr. 437:23-442:3 \n(illustrating cyclical paper processes as to resident HB), 442:25-448:25 (illustrating cyclical \npaper processes as to resident BB), 448:12-450:12 (illustrating cyclical paper processes as to \nresident CA); see also Osgood 174:13-175:3 (CHDC terminating individual staff is insufficient \nto address repeated abuse and neglect).   \n345.  CHDC staff’s ongoing serious acts of abuse and neglect have caused serious harm, and \nrisk of harm, to CHDC adults and children.  Osgood Tr. 50:19-51:20; US Exs. 43 through 63, 27-\n13, 52.  On multiple occasions, CHDC staff continued to work with CHDC residents even \nthough they had abused or neglected CHDC residents, or had previously been investigated for \nabuse or neglect.  US Exs. 45 (staff previously accused of physical abuse of resident and \n107 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 113 of 318\ncontinued to provide direct care to CHDC residents), 47 (staff disciplined on 4 prior occasions \nand continued to work with CHDC residents), 48 (staff repeatedly disciplined, accused of \nphysical and verbal abuse of resident, and continued to work with CHDC residents), 50 (staff \nterminated in 2005 for physical abuse of CHDC resident but subsequently returned to duty).   \n346.  As to children, CHDC staff have forced a resident to assault another child while staff \nrestrained the child victim, causing bruises to the child’s hands, forearms, legs, back, and chest.  \nOsgood Tr. 158:1-6, 159:3-19; US Ex. 43.  Staff have severely beaten several CHDC youth.  \nOne staff was fired, later reinstated, and then found to have banged one youth’s head against a \ndoor, causing a swelled bloody nose.  Osgood Tr. 159:24-162:9; US Ex. 44.  Another staff sat on \nand choked a youth resident, causing serious harm and serious risk of harm from asphyxiation.  \nOsgood Tr. 162:10-25; US Ex. 45.  This staff previously had been investigated for grabbing a \nresident by the neck and forcibly sitting him down, but the investigation was not substantiated \nand the staff member returned to work.  Osgood Tr. 162:10-25; US Ex. 45.  A different staff \nperson scratched a child, twisted his arm, and tried to force the child to go to another residence.  \nOsgood Tr. 163:5-15; US Ex. 46. \n347.  Staff gave another youth footprint-shaped purple abrasions across his face, after the staff \nimmobilized him in a papoose board and stomped on the youth’s face.  Osgood Tr. 163:18-\n166:19; US Exs. 27-13, 47, 48.  The youth had previously reported that the same staff member \nhit him and called him names every day.  Osgood Tr. 164:1-13.  This staff member had two prior \nabuse allegations – one for grabbing a resident by the collar, dragging him outside, and forcing \nhim into a chair (US Ex. 55), and another for grabbing a resident by the neck, putting him in a \nheadlock, and lifting and dragging the resident (US Ex. 62).  Osgood Tr. 165:6-13, 167:16-\n168:23.   This staff member had received multiple forms of discipline for other on-the-job \n108 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 114 of 318\nconduct as well.  Osgood Tr. 164:14-165:6.  Even after the staff member stomped on the youth \nstrapped on a papoose board, the youth’s safety plan still permitted staff to restrain him in a \npapoose board, despite that generally accepted professional standards require evaluation of the \npossible effects of restraint use for individuals who have been abused while restrained.  Osgood \nTr. 166:20-167:15.  CHDC did not even ensure that this youth’s program coordinator became \naware of this significant incident when she received the youth on her caseload.  Weaver Tr. \n339:1-22. \n348.  CHDC staff also have abused and injured adult residents.  One CHDC resident was \nbeaten repeatedly with a broken coat hanger and suffered numerous whelps across her back, \narms, shoulders, chest, and buttocks.  Osgood Tr. 170:5-171:11; US Ex. 50.  The staff member \nwho severely abused this CHDC resident previously had been terminated for abuse but was \npermitted to return to work after she was able to pass a polygraph test.   Osgood Tr. 171:12-23.   \n349.  Another CHDC staff member abused a resident using a belt buckle as a weapon.  Osgood \nTr. 172:13-23; US Ex. 2015.  The staff’s abuse was revealed when the resident was discovered to \nhave a bruise matching the shape of a staff member’s belt buckle.  Osgood Tr. 172:13-23; US \nEx. 2015.  This resident had been the victim of staff abuse or neglect on multiple prior occasions \nas well, including at least two substantiated instances of physical abuse and at least three \nsubstantiated incidents of neglect, one of which involved staff members who strapped the \nresident naked into a recliner and left him unattended, chewing on a blanket.  Osgood Tr. \n172:24-174:12. \n350.  Other incidents in which CHDC residents have suffered physical abuse include an \ninstance where a staff person hit a resident in the chest with a keyboard, and told another \nemployee, “you did not see this.”  Osgood Tr. 175:8-5; US Ex. 51.  Another CHDC staff member \n109 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 115 of 318\npunched a resident who was in a wheelchair.  Osgood Tr. 176:24-177:14; US Ex. 54.  Another \nstaff member became involved in an altercation with a CHDC resident and struck the resident \nrepeatedly in the head.  Osgood Tr. 178:24-180:5; US Ex. 57.  Other staff members:  hit a CHDC \nresident as the staff took a jacket away from him (Osgood Tr. 176:9-21; US Ex. 52); hit a CHDC \nresident in the face with a magazine (Osgood Tr. 177:17-178:4; US Ex. 56); pushed a resident \ndown onto the floor in a living unit day room (Osgood Tr. 181:9-25; US Ex. 59); stepped on a \nresident’s hand when the resident was agitated (Osgood Tr. 183:2-22; US Ex. 61); and grabbed a \nresident by the neck and shoved her into her room, taking the resident’s blanket away “to make \nher behave.”  Osgood Tr. 180:9-181:5; US Ex. 58.   \n351.  In addition, CHDC staff have verbally abused or threatened CHDC adult and children \nresidents.  Osgood Tr. 178:7-20; US Ex. 53 (CHDC staff threatening to hit CHDC resident if he \nhad hit another resident and cursing at the same resident after he soiled himself); Osgood Tr. \n182:4-17; US Ex. 60 (CHDC investigation confirming discourteous conduct for staff member \nwho verbally abused CHDC resident). \n352.  CHDC also perpetuates an environment in which staff do not feel safe reporting alleged \nabuse and neglect.  Discouraging staff from reporting alleged acts of abuse or neglect, CHDC \ndisciplines and even terminates staff who report late, even if the delay in reporting is due to \nintimidation by the alleged perpetrator of the abuse.  Osgood Tr. 156:19-157:18.  In addition, a \nlarge portion of staff who report abuse and neglect are recently hired, indicating that CHDC \nfosters a culture of silence into which staff are eventually inducted.  Osgood Tr. 156:19-157:18, \n158:1-21, 168:10-18; US Ex. 43 (abuse reporting staff did not report immediately because he did \nnot trust the shift coordinator’s relationship with the alleged perpetrator, yet was terminated for \nlate reporting); Osgood Tr. 181:8-23; US Ex. 59 (reporting staff had one month on the job); US \n110 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 116 of 318\nEx. 60 (reporting employee had three months on the job); Osgood Tr. 183:1-19; US Ex. 61 \n(reporting staff had two months on the job); Osgood Tr. 168:10-23; US Ex. 62 (alleged \nperpetrator not disciplined for unsubstantiated allegations but reporting staff member received a \nwritten warning for late reporting).  Consequently, staff likely do not consistently report alleged \nacts of abuse or neglect, and CHDC’s failure to investigate and address alleged acts of abuse and \nneglect of CHDC residents continues to expose residents to harm.   \nD.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Restraint Use Results in the Excessive and Inappropriate Use of \nRestraints and Violates the Rights of Residents.    \n353.  CHDC uses outdated and highly restrictive forms of mechanical restraints on both adults \nand children.  These mechanical restraints include papoose boards, which other states have not \nused for a number of years, and restraint chairs, which most facilities have eliminated in the last \nten years.  Osgood Tr. 47:12-48:7, 145:2-147:2, 277:20-278:4, 293:2-294:15.  Other states have \nbanned or are considering banning the use of all mechanical restraints on children.  Osgood Tr. \n276:4-12. \n354.  Generally accepted professional standards require restraint reviews, which include an \ninquiry into:  the precipitating factors that led to the restraint (including any de-escalation that \nwas conducted before the restraint), how the restraint was employed, whether the restraint was \napplied in accordance with policy, whether the individual was monitored during the restraint to \nprevent injury, whether there are any significant restraint trends, and what actions can be taken to \nprevent future restraints.  Osgood Tr. 48:19-49:11, 130:19-131:9.   \n355.  CHDC fails to ensure that staff restrain residents only in emergency situations necessary \nto prevent harm to the resident or others and only for the length of time necessary for the \nemergency to subside.  CHDC also does not conduct a documented review of each restraint to \n111 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 117 of 318\nexamine these factors or to take steps to prevent future incidents of inappropriate restraints.  \nOsgood Tr. 48:8-49:11, 127:14-130:6, 184:16-186:5; Miller Tr. 5027:6-12; US Ex. 39-1 through \n39-8.  Moreover, CHDC’s restraint data is underinclusive because CHDC does not record the use \nof restrictive garments as restraints.  Osgood Tr. 130:7-18.   \n356.  As a result, CHDC’s restraint use substantially departs from generally accepted standards \nrequiring that staff use restraints only in emergency situations necessary to prevent harm to the \nresident or others and only for the length of time necessary for the emergency to subside.  \nOsgood Tr. 48:8-49:11. \n357.  For example, staff have improperly restrained or threatened to restrain CHDC residents \nfor punitive reasons.  In one incident, CHDC staff retaliated against a resident by pinning down \nthe resident, telling her that she was “going to the board,” and then restraining her on a papoose \nboard.  Osgood Tr. 134:18-136:10; US Ex. 2016.  Another time, a CHDC staff put a resident in a \nchokehold, dragged her across the floor, physically restrained her, and then strapped her on a \npapoose board, in retaliation for the resident biting the staff.  Although the staff abuse was \ninvestigated, CHDC did not investigate the improper use of restraint.  Osgood Tr. 142:24-\n144:13; US Ex. 49.  In yet another incident, a nurse yelled at a resident that if the resident did not \ntake her medication, the resident would be put on a papoose board.  Osgood Tr. 136:14-25, \n141:22-142:2; US Ex. 2010.  A CHDC resident also told Ms. Osgood that, when the resident \nacted up, staff strapped her on the papoose board, which caused injuries to her wrists.  Osgood \nTr. 144:15-145:1. \n358.  CHDC residents are inappropriately restrained so often that they have been accustomed \nto it.  A CHDC resident confirmed with one of Defendants’ consultants that she is restrained for \n112 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 118 of 318\npunishment, but that it is “not a big deal” – a statement that even Defendants’ consultant finds \n“troubling.”  Gale Tr. 5733:17-5734:4. \n359.  CHDC restraint plans reflect inappropriate criteria for release.  E.g., US Ex. 40 (safety \nplan indicating that CHDC resident should be “apologetic” before being released from \nrestraints); Osgood Tr. 131:10-133:11 (safety plan requiring that individual be apologetic before \nbeing released from restraints demonstrates punitive restraint use); Gale Tr. 5734:20-24 (CHDC \nresident stated that she must agree not to engage in undesired behavior again before being \nreleased from restraints).   \n360.  Because CHDC does not track injuries in restraints, CHDC is unaware that residents have \nsuffered such restraint injuries, indicating that restraints may be harming more than protecting \nCHDC residents.  Osgood Tr. 84:7-22, 148:9-153:15, 268:8-20 (CHDC resident placed on \npapoose board while x-rays of her hip were pending, risking further injury of the individual’s \nhip); US Exs. 8 (injuries in restraints included abrasions and bruising), 27-13 (youth ZS stomped \non in papoose board, suffering footprint-shaped abrasion to face), 39-1 (in response to discovery \nrequest, CHDC indicated there had been no injuries resulting from restraint use), 39-2 (resident \nreceived pain medication after being placed on papoose board), 39-3 (resident was put on \npapoose board and hurt his foot), 39-4 (blister from seat belt restraint), 39-5 (red marks from arm \nsplint restraints), 39-6 (scratches from restraint), 39-7 (abrasion from papoose board strap), 39-8 \n(bruise to hip from papoose board). \n113 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 119 of 318\nE.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Protection from Harm in Staffing and Supervision Results in \nHarm to CHDC Residents.  \n361.  CHDC has insufficient staff to adequately supervise residents, to provide adequate care \nand supports to its residents, and to protect residents from ongoing harm and risk of harm.  \nOsgood Tr. 76:14-76:25, 283:14-284:12.   \n362.  For example, CHDC staff’s inadequate supervision caused the death of a CHDC resident, \nknown to be at risk of choking because staff had observed her filling her mouth too full, eating \nfast, and swallowing without chewing on various occasions.  US Ex. 6-3 at CON-US-0009499.  \nCHDC staff were supposed to observe her during mealtime and redirect her to avoid these \nbehaviors.  Left unsupervised one evening, resident AR choked on bologna in a housing unit \nkitchen.  Osgood Tr. 77:1-78:13; US Exs. 6-1, 6-2 & 6-3.  Following AR’s death, CHDC did not \ntake corrective action – until the state agency that monitors CHDC, the Arkansas Office of Long-\nTerm Care (“OLTC”), conducted an investigation.  Osgood Tr. 78:2-7.   \n363.  CHDC also has failed to protect residents who it knew were at risk of pica (ingesting \nnon-nutritive items), as shown by incidents in which residents tore out catheters and feeding \ntubes, or ingested markers, crayons, books, cups, pieces of Attends, a deodorant spray nozzle, \nand feces.  Osgood Tr. 79:3-81:4, 83:8-24, 89:23-90:18, 91:16-24, 92:5-93:4; US Exs. 7-1, 7-2, \n7-3, 8, 13, 15, 16.    \n364.  CHDC also places residents at risk of serious harm by not following through on orders \nfor increased supervision.  For example, CHDC staff has left individuals on suicide watch \nunattended and individuals assigned visual supervision unattended in a parking lot.  Another \nresident suffered injuries after CHDC staff left the resident unattended and the resident jumped \noff a desk.  Osgood Tr. 85:4-89:16, 90:25-91:10; US Exs. 9, 10, 11, 12-1, 12-2, 14.  As the \n114 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 120 of 318\nexamples illustrate, CHDC’s staffing and supervision substantially departs from generally \naccepted professional standards and places CHDC residents at continued risk of harm. \n365.  On-site observations also revealed inadequate staff supervision.  Ms. Osgood observed \nseveral residents at risk of harm from inadequate supervision during her site visits at CHDC.  \nOsgood Tr. 94:16-97:8.  For example, one man had wrapped a plastic apparatus around his neck \n(characterized by CHDC as “chewelry”), another woman whose one eye had been enucleated \nwas seen poking at her remaining eye, and another woman had a bleeding laceration that CHDC \nstaff appeared not to have detected.  Osgood Tr. 95:13-96:5.  Other individuals were sitting idly, \nnot apparently engaged in any activities or active treatment.  This is significant because lack of \nmeaningful activity is associated with increased resident injuries.  Osgood Tr. 95:2-12, 96:15-\n97:7. \n366.  CHDC’s superintendent Price conceded that direct care staffing is a primary issue for \nCHDC.  Mr. Price recalled times that CHDC has had to count secretaries or teachers as direct \ncare staff in order to meet minimum CMS staffing ratio requirements.  Price Tr. 1686:7-25.  \nWhen the United States’ experts were on-site, CHDC artificially improved staffing ratios by \nrefusing to approve any staff leave during those days.  Price Tr. 1686:16-22. \nF.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Protection from Harm in Staff Training Results in Harm to \nCHDC Residents. \n367.  CHDC has inadequate systems and procedures to protect clients and staff from harm.  \nCHDC’s deficiencies include an absence of comprehensive policies and procedures and \ninsufficient competency-based training to guide staff in providing adequate care and supervision \nto residents.  Osgood Tr. 45:15-46:4, 57:25-58:15, 184:16-186:5.  As a result, staff are not \n115 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 121 of 318\nfamiliar with the supports and services that residents in their care need.  This harms individuals \nand places them at risk of harm.  Osgood Tr. 45:15-46:4, 57:25-58:15, 184:16-186:5.   \n368.  Ms. Osgood found that CHDC’s systemic deficiencies resulted in harm and risk of harm \nto residents.  Defendants’ consultant, Dr. Kevin Walsh, conducted no analysis of whether \nharmful outcomes to CHDC residents showed systemic deficiencies.  Walsh Tr. 6118:2-13.  Nor \ndid Dr. Walsh evaluate a single individual to see whether any individual suffered repeated \ninjuries or whether individual rates of injuries improved over time.  Walsh Tr. 6127:15-18. \n369.  As recently as Summer 2010, CMS found that CHDC placed individuals in immediate \njeopardy.  Specifically, CMS found that CHDC violated the “client protection” condition of \nparticipation, an extremely rare and serious adverse finding.4  Osgood Tr. 65:20-68:14, 280:9-19; \nUS Ex. 4.  This finding was precipitated by an incident in which CHDC staff left a resident \nunattended in a locked wheelchair in extreme heat for nearly four hours, soiled and suffering \nfrom heat stroke.  Osgood Tr. 69:1-70:5; US Ex. 4.  The CMS survey, conducted by State OLTC \nstaff, also revealed that CHDC was not timely completing investigative reports in accordance \nwith CMS regulations.  Osgood Tr. 70:6-70:15.   \n370.  CHDC’s inadequate systems and procedures also led to the sexual assault of a CHDC \nresident.  CHDC staff permitted a non-CHDC resident to stay overnight, unsupervised, with the \nCHDC resident.  During this visit, the individual sexually assaulted the CHDC resident.  Osgood \nTr. 58:16-61:5; US Ex. 2.  CHDC had no policy or procedure to instruct staff how to supervise \nresidents during overnight visits, including how to make room assignments or whether and how \nto conduct bed checks.  Osgood Tr. 59:13-19.   In addition, this CHDC resident has a hearing \nimpairment and needed to report the sexual assault to a peer because there apparently was no \n                                                 \n4   See 42 C.F.R. § 4893. \n116 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 122 of 318\nstaff versant in sign language to receive his report of sexual abuse.  Osgood Tr. 59:18-24.  Even \nafter this incident, CHDC failed to implement comprehensive procedures for overnight trips.  \nOsgood Tr. 60:6-17. \n371.  CHDC’s inadequate systems and procedures also caused CHDC staff to leave a non-\nverbal child with autism and seizure disorder alone in a housing unit overnight with no \nsupervision.  Osgood Tr. 61:16-63:20; US Ex. 3.  If this child had suffered a seizure overnight, \nhe would have had no one to help him.  CHDC staff left the child after moving all other residents \nout of a housing unit due to a staffing shortage.  Although this was not the only instance in which \nCHDC staff had to move all individuals out of a housing unit due to a staffing shortage, CHDC \nstill had no procedural guidelines for moving individuals out of their residence overnight.  \nOsgood Tr. 62:20-63:20.  Such procedural guidelines should include how to ensure that all \nindividuals are transported to the correct location and what documentation must accompany the \nindividuals.  Osgood Tr. 63:2-63:20.  Even after creating a protocol following this incident, \nCHDC failed to adequately train staff on procedures for overnight moves:  Ms. Osgood \ninterviewed a number of staff, and they were unable to articulate the protocol.  Osgood Tr. \n63:25-64:16.  \n372.  CHDC staff training substantially departs from generally accepted professional standards \nbecause it is not sufficiently competency-based, i.e., it does not measure whether staff \nunderstand what they are supposed to perform and how they are supposed to perform it.  Osgood \nTr. 71:14-73:16.  As a result, staff do not have the tools they need to provide adequate care and \nsupervision to individual residents and are not familiar with the supports and services that \nresidents in their care need.  Osgood Tr. 49:12-50:18.   \n117 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 123 of 318\n373.  In particular, CHDC relies on “quick reference guides” (“QRGs”) as a replacement for \nadequate staff education.  This is especially problematic for “float staff,” who often are assigned \nto the most high-risk individuals at CHDC without familiarity or training regarding the needs of \nindividuals in their care.  Osgood Tr. 49:23-50:18, 73:20-75:4.   For example, a CHDC resident \nwas injured from a fall after staff relied on a QRG that did not disclose protective equipment \nrequired for the resident.  Osgood Tr. 75:5-76:2; US Ex. 5.  In other investigations as well, \nCHDC’s reliance on QRGs resulted in harm to individuals because staff were found not to have \nread those guides.  Osgood Tr. 76:3-8. \n374.  CHDC also relies on a “read and sign” method of training staff on new or revised policies \nand procedures.  See Price Tr. 6895:12-18.  This substandard method fails to ensure that staff \ngain the competencies needed to implement the policies and procedures.  Osgood Tr. 64:17-65:4. \nG.  CHDC Fails To Protect Resident Rights Adequately.   \n375.  CHDC does not ensure protection of resident rights.  CHDC’s resident rights practices \nfail to address certain types of rights restrictions, including the placement of cameras in resident \nhousing units.  Specifically, CHDC placed cameras in housing units without obtaining prior \nconsent from the facility human rights committee, individuals, or their parents/guardians.  \nOsgood Tr. 123:9-124:16; Price Tr. 6906:5-13.  Only later did CHDC inform parents and \nguardians of the cameras.  Osgood Tr. 124:5-16. \n376.  CHDC fails to ensure that consent for treatment and services is informed and voluntary. \nInstead, CHDC relies on an informed consent policy that permits CHDC to discharge residents if \nthey or their parent or guardian will not consent to any proposed restriction of resident rights that \nrequires informed written consent, i.e., administration of psychotropic medications.  Osgood Tr. \n124:17-127:11; US Ex. 38. \n118 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 124 of 318\nV.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW – PROTECTION FROM HARM \n  Defendants systematic violation of CHDC residents’ constitutional right to protection \nfrom harm causes harm to residents from staff abuse and neglect, inappropriate and excessive \nuse of restraints, and repeated serious injuries such as lacerations, fractures, and harm from other \nindividuals.  The Fourteenth Amendment requires that CHDC provide residents reasonably safe \nconditions of confinement and protection from unreasonable risks of harm.  See Youngberg v. \nRomeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315-16 (1982) (requiring states to take the necessary steps to ensure that \nfacilities provide residents reasonably safe conditions of confinement and reasonable protection \nfrom harm); Andrews v. Neer, 253 F.3d 1052, 1062 n.8 (8th Cir. 2001) (noting that Youngberg \nand its Eighth Circuit progeny require “vulnerable patients [ ] to be protected, through before-\nthe-fact measures, from themselves, other patients, or the deliberate harmful actions of the \ninstitution’s staff members”); see also Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 34-35 (1993) \n(affirming that the Eighth Amendment requires protection from unreasonable risk of future \nharm).  In violation of this constitutional requirement, Defendants harm residents with a \nprotection from harm system that substantially departs from generally accepted minimal \nprofessional standards.  \n  CHDC’s substandard systems and procedures to protect residents from harm, including \npolicies and procedures to guide staff in providing care and supervision to residents and adequate \ncompetency-based staff training,5 fail to provide CHDC residents with constitutionally \nreasonably safe conditions.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16.  CHDC violates residents’ \nconstitutional right to reasonably safe conditions by failing to provide sufficient staff to \n                                                 \n5   Federal Medicaid regulations, and particularly 42 C.F.R. § 483.430(e), require \nthat staff training be competency-based.  See 42 C.F.R. § 483.430(e) (“Staff must be able to \ndemonstrate the skills and techniques necessary to implement the individual program plans for \neach client for whom they are responsible.”). \n \n119 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 125 of 318\nadequately supervise residents, to provide adequate care and supports to its residents, and to \nprotect residents from ongoing harm and risk of harm.  Id.   \n  CHDC also violates residents’ constitutional right to reasonably safe conditions by \nfailing to prevent risk of serious harm through development and monitoring of adequate risk \nmanagement plans and by failing to identify and respond to repeated types of injuries and \nrepeated injuries to individuals.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-16; Helling, 509 U.S. at 34-35.  \nRather than focusing on improving the health and safety of residents, CHDC’s quality \nmanagement practices inappropriately target the facility’s efforts to try to maintain compliance \nwith federal funding and other regulations, as well as other facility-based concerns (such as \nemployee worker’s compensation issues).  Failing to take action to avoid harm and ongoing risk \nof harm to residents following staff abuse and neglect, inappropriate and excessive use of \nrestraints, and repeated serious injuries such as lacerations, fractures, harm from other \nindividuals, and exposures to bloodborne pathogens, exhibits CHDC’s lack of professional \njudgment and, as such, constitutes a substantial departure from minimum professional standards.  \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 323.   \n  CHDC violates residents’ rights to reasonable safety by utilizing outdated and highly \nrestrictive forms of mechanical restraints on both adults and children, and by failing to ensure \nthat such restrictive physical and mechanical restraints of residents are applied only in \nemergency situations necessary to prevent harm to the resident or others and only for the length \nof time necessary for the emergency to subside.  Id. at 316-18; Society for Good Will to Retarded \nChildren, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1245 (2d Cir. 1984) (holding that patients of mental \nhealth institutions have a right to freedom from undue bodily restraint); Thomas S. v. Flaherty, \n699 F. Supp. 1178, 1189 (W.D.N.C. 1988) (“It is a substantial departure from professional \n120 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 126 of 318\nstandards to rely routinely on seclusion and restraint rather than systematic behavior techniques \nsuch as social reinforcement to control aggressive behavior.  Seclusion and restraint should only \nbe used as a last resort.”); see also 42 U.S.C. § 290ii(b) (specifically prohibiting restraining \npractices employed by CHDC, by requiring that restraints on ICF/MR residents only be used to \nensure physical safety and only as ordered by a licensed practitioner who clearly specifies the \nduration and circumstances (except in certain emergency circumstances)).  CHDC violates \nresidents’ rights by applying restraints for punitive reasons, applying restraints that exceed safety \nrequirements, and by conditioning release from restraint on inappropriate factors, such as \napologizing. \n  CHDC fails to provide reasonably safe conditions for CHDC residents by not taking \nsystemic action to address or attempt to prevent recurrence of staff abuse and neglect of children \nand adults.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315-17.  CHDC exacerbates the risk of ongoing serious harm \nby failing to ensure an environment in which staff feel safe in reporting alleged abuse and \nneglect, resulting in inconsistent investigations of alleged acts of abuse and neglect of CHDC \nchildren and adults. \n  Defendants’ own documents provide further evidence of Defendants’ substantial \ndeparture from professional standards in CHDC’s protection from harm practices.  These \ndocuments prove that CHDC is not even complying with regulations for facilities receiving \nfederal Medicaid funding that require specific steps to be taken to protect residents from abuse \nand neglect.  See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. § 483.420(a)(5) (“[T]he facility must. . . [e]nsure that clients are \nnot subjected to physical, verbal, sexual or psychological abuse or punishment”); 42 C.F.R. \n§ 483.420(d)(1) (“The facility must develop and implement written policies and procedures that \nprohibit mistreatment, neglect or abuse of the client.”); 42 C.F.R. § 483.420(d)(3) (“The facility \n121 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 127 of 318\nmust have evidence that all alleged violations are thoroughly investigated and must prevent \nfurther potential abuse while the investigation is in progress.”); 42 C.F.R. § 483.420(d)(4) (“The \nresults of all investigations must be reported to the administrator or designated representative or \nto other officials in accordance with State law within five working days of the incident and, if the \nalleged violation is verified, appropriate corrective action must be taken.”).    \n  CHDC’s resident rights practices also fail to address certain rights restrictions (such as \ncameras) and fail to ensure that consent by residents or residents’ parents and guardians is \ninformed and voluntary.  See 42 C.F.R. § 483.10(a)(2) (“A facility must protect and promote the \nrights of each resident, including . . . the right to be free of interference, coercion, discrimination, \nand reprisal from the facility in exercising his or her rights.”). \n  In sum, CHDC’s many systemic failures and deficiencies in staff supervision and \ntraining, incident reporting, quality management practices, protection of resident rights, staff \nabuse and neglect, and use of mechanical restraints violate residents’ constitutional rights to \nreasonably safe conditions of confinement and protection from unreasonable risks of harm, \nsubjecting residents to repeated, preventable harm. \n122 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 128 of 318\nTABLE OF CONTENTS – PSYCHOLOGY \nVI.

FINDINGS OF FACT – PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL SERVICES \n377.  CHDC’s psychological and behavioral services substantially depart from professional \nstandards, causing harm, and risk of harm, to CHDC residents.  Instead of providing \nindividualized psychological assessments and treatment, CHDC staff respond to residents’ \nbehaviors by restraining them at astronomical rates that vastly exceed norms in other states.  See \ngenerally FOF Part VI.A-G. \n378.  CHDC staff fail to conduct appropriate assessments, though accurate and comprehensive \nassessments make up the building blocks of a treatment plan.  Rather than employing widely \nrecognized, scientifically validated instruments, CHDC staff utilize ad hoc procedures to \nevaluate resident cognition, adaptive function, and behavioral function.  See generally FOF Part \nVI.D-E. \n379.  CHDC also fails to monitor and re-assess residents over time to ensure that treatment \nplans are individualized and respond to changes in residents’ conditions and needs.  Staff take \nmonths to prepare or modify treatment plans, even after agreeing that changes are necessary.   \nWhile they await appropriate treatment, CHDC residents are restrained repeatedly.  See generally \nFOF Part VI.B-D. \n380.  CHDC should use restraints only to address problem behaviors as a last resort when \npsychological treatment fails.  In practice, however, CHDC does not provide the necessary \npsychological services that would promote safety and independence.  Though Defendants fail to \nimplement effective positive behavior interventions, Defendants maintain that the behaviors they \nfail to address justify continued segregation of CHDC residents.  See generally FOF Part VI.A-\nG. \n381.  CHDC’s most commonly used mechanical restraint devices are unusually restrictive.  \nThey include papoose boards, straitjackets, and restraints chairs.  Other institutions across the \n125 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 131 of 318\ncountry rarely, if ever, use such devices even when restraints may be deemed necessary.  Most \nproblematically, CHDC staff regularly use even the most restrictive mechanical devices on \nyoung children, a group that generally is not even institutionalized, let alone subjected to \npapoose boards.  See generally FOF Part VI.B.  Moreover, CHDC uses a host of procedures – \nincluding electro-convulsive shock therapy, chemical restraints, seclusion, and one-to-one \nsupervision – that CHDC does not systematically track.  So, CHDC’s use of restrictive methods \nis likely even higher than CHDC reports.  See generally FOF Part VI.B. \n382.  Staffing and staffing training cause much of CHDC’s substandard psychological services.  \nNearly all of CHDC’s psychology staff are master’s level practitioners who do not have the \nnecessary education, training, or experience to provide the psychological services and \nhabilitation necessary for CHDC residents.  As a result, residents suffer harm from both \nunnecessary restraints and their unaddressed psychological behaviors.  See generally FOF Part \nVI.E-F. \n383.  Several of the unlawful deficiencies identified by the United States in psychological \nservices were also noted by the Arkansas Department of Education, in its report on special \neducation services at CHDC.  Compare US Exs. 1197-1198, 1201, 1203, 1211, 1214, 1216, 1217 \n(lack of:  staff, behavioral interventions in the school setting, integration of services, and \nattention to communication issues), with Matson Tr. 1095:13-1097:25. \nA.  Experts Dr. Johnny Matson and Dr. Ramasamy Manikam Credibly Testified \nThat CHDC’s Psychological and Behavioral Services Substantially Depart \nfrom Generally Accepted Professional Standards, Causing Harm, and Risk \nof Harm, to CHDC Residents. \n384.  Dr. Johnny Matson is a licensed clinical psychologist.  He has practiced for 34 years, and \ncurrently works as a professor, distinguished research master, and director of clinical training in \nthe Department of Psychology, Louisiana State University.  Over the course of his career, he has \n126 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 132 of 318\nconsulted at 39 developmental centers in 18 states.  He serves as editor for 2 professional \njournals and has published approximately 500 articles and 30 books.  Matson Tr. 990:3-1001:9; \nUS Ex. 551.  Dr. Matson received the Frank J. Menolascino Award from the National \nAssociation for the Dually Diagnosed, and his peers have recognized him as one of the leading \nexperts in the fields of developmental disabilities and behavior therapy.  He testified as an expert \non applied behavioral analysis and psychological treatment of people with developmental \ndisabilities.  Matson Tr. 990:3-1001:9; US Ex. 551.  CHDC’s chief psychologist,                      \nDr. Carl Reddig, admits that Dr. Matson is an authority in the field of psychology.  Reddig Tr. \n1978:23-1979:5. \n385.  Dr. Ramasamy Manikam is a licensed clinical psychologist.  His major areas of \nprofessional focus include autism, developmental disabilities, and self-injurious behavior.  He \nhas served as an associate editor for the Journal of Child and Family Studies.  He provided expert \ntestimony on applied behavioral analysis and psychological treatment of people with \ndevelopmental disabilities.  Manikam Tr. 3064:2-3068:22; US Ex. 584. \n386.  Drs. Matson and Manikam concluded that CHDC’s psychological services substantially \ndepart from generally accepted professional standards of care.  See generally FOF Part VI.B-F.  \nIn forming his professional opinion, Dr. Matson completed 2 week-long tours of CHDC, during \nwhich he interviewed psychology staff, reviewed cases with staff, and examined a large volume \nof documents including resident behavioral plans and over 500 census summary data sheets.  \nMatson Tr. 1001:10-1002:19.  Dr. Manikam also completed two week-long tours of CHDC.  \nWhile on-site, Dr. Manikam interviewed psychology staff and examined a large volume of \ndocuments, including treatment plans, restraint procedures, and psychology forms.  Dr. Manikam \nalso previously inspected CHDC in 2007, prior to this litigation.  Manikam Tr. 3068:23-3075:8.    \n127 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 133 of 318\nB.  Instead of Providing Appropriate Psychological Care, CHDC Staff Restrain \nResidents with Excessively Harsh Methods, at Astronomical Rates, in \nSubstantial Departure from Professional Standards. \n387.  Due to CHDC’s failure to provide effective behavioral supports and services, CHDC \nroutinely and needlessly subjects individuals to strikingly high rates of harmful restraints.  \nCHDC does not provide timely and effective behavioral interventions that would help residents \nreplace maladaptive behaviors with safe and appropriate ways of expressing themselves.  See \nFOF Part VI.C-F.  Lacking effective means to change residents’ maladaptive behaviors, CHDC \nsimply suppresses those behaviors through extraordinary rates and forms of harmful restraints.  \nThese include extensive use of various types of antiquated “mechanical” restraints (i.e., restraint \nequipment), physical holds, and chemical restraints.  CHDC employs these highly restrictive \nmeasures regardless of a resident’s age and notwithstanding their obvious traumatic effect.  See \nFOF Part VI.B.  CHDC staff use even the most severe restraints on children, survivors of \ndomestic violence, and in at least one case, on a child who abusive staff had previously \ndeliberately stomped on after strapping the child to a papoose board.  CHDC does not provide \nclinical oversight of its restraint use.  In virtually no instance do CHDC psychology staff \nclinically assess the circumstances that led staff to restrain a resident or assess the impact that the \nrestraint had on the individual or his/her behavior.  Further, although CHDC’s self-reported rates \nof restraint are high, CHDC’s rates unquestionably undercount the actual rates of restraint it uses \non residents.  In summary, CHDC’s harmful restraint practices substantially depart from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care.  See FOF Part VI.B. \n388.  CHDC restrains residents rather than addressing behaviors with adequate assessments \nand behavioral treatment.  Manikam Tr. 3162:21-3163:3; see Matson Tr. 1178:4-1179:18; see \ngenerally Appx.  For example, staff used restraints to address SA’s aggression without \nintervening to address the suspected trigger for the aggression.  Similarly, staff tied resident DB \n128 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 134 of 318\nto a papoose board instead of addressing environmental and communication factors triggering \nthe behaviors.  In yet another case, staff used papoose boards and physical holds on RC because \nthe generic “point system” that Defense witnesses admit has not worked for other residents also \ndid not work for RC.  CHDC’s other misuses of restraint include placing a resident in a jumpsuit \nfor staff convenience, namely, to reduce the frequency with which staff had to redirect the \nresident from engaging in maladaptive behavior, and many more.  See Appx. at 20, 21, 23, 28, 32 \n(Other specific examples include BH and LW.). \n1)  CHDC Routinely Uses Archaic Restraint Types That Substantially Depart \nfrom Professional Standards. \n389.  CHDC extensively uses 41 types of restraints, including antiquated restraint methods that \ndo not comport with contemporary, generally accepted professional standards.  Matson Tr. \n1119:4-1120:18;  Manikam Tr. 3157:5-3162:5; Reddig Tr. 1947:9-23; US Exs. 596 & 623.  In \nparticular, CHDC’s widespread use of the papoose board, camisole jacket (a.k.a. straitjacket), \nand restraint chair, substantially departs from generally accepted contemporary practice.  See \nMatson Tr. 1119:4-1120:22, 1255:7-10; Manikam Tr. 3157:5-3163:3.  Notably, Defendants \nproduced no evidence of any other jurisdiction that uses these outdated types of restraints on \nsuch a wide scale.  See also Cooper Tr. 2425:21-2426:1 (never needed to create a restraint \nprogram at University of Arkansas Medical School), 2427:14-20; Warren Tr. 4721:1-4722:4 (no \npapoose board or CHDC-type restraint chair used in defense consultant’s private practice \nfacilities).     \n390.  CHDC uses the outdated papoose board in behavior programs for approximately 18 \npercent of CHDC residents.  Manikam Tr. 3157:5-3159:5. \n391.  The use of completely restrictive restraints, such as the papoose board, on children as \nyoung as the ones housed at CHDC, is unprecedented.  Matson Tr. 1179:24-1180:1.  Other \n129 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 135 of 318\nsystems do not use such mechanical restraints at all on young children.  See Matson Tr. 1119:16-\n1120:22, 1179:19-1180:10; Manikam Tr. 3160:16-3162:5 (states have gone restraint free and use \nof restraints on children is typically considered unnecessary), 3163:4-12 (other systems do not \neven admit children to residential facilities like CHDC).  In contrast, CHDC uses severely \nrestrictive procedures, including papoose boards, on a wide range on children.  Examples include \nCA (18 years old, papoose board); SA (15 years old, papoose board and chemical restraints); DB \n(17 years old, papoose board); HB (13 years old, prone physical holds); RC (15 years old, \npapoose board and physical holds); TC (9 years old, helmet and papoose board); ZS (12 years \nold, papoose board), LW (10 years old, soft shell helmet used without appropriate safeguards and \ntreatment plan).  See Appx. at 12, 18, 20,21, 23, 24, 28. \n392.  CHDC’s use of restraints in hazardous locations increases the risk of resident injury.  See, \ne.g., Matson Tr. 1180:5-10 (restraint chair located in difficult to supervise location at back of \nhousing unit, with sharp objects in vicinity). \n393.  CHDC has used highly invasive techniques, such as electroconvulsive shock therapy \n(“ECT”), on at least one CHDC resident, BH, without showing that it first attempted appropriate \nbehavioral interventions.  Warren Tr. 4798:3-4799:12.  CHDC’s use of extreme measures \nwithout first attempting less drastic treatment is a substantial departure from generally accepted \nprofessional standards.  See generally FOF Part VI.B-D; see also Manikam Tr. 3109:21-3010:24; \nUS Exs. 30-12, 687.  Similarly, CHDC staff considered pulling a resident’s teeth to address the \nresults of behavior (persistent rubbing of the gums) that CHDC should have assessed and treated \nwith less drastic behavioral interventions.  See Manikam Tr. 3109:21-3010:24; US Exs. 30-12, \n687.   \n130 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 136 of 318\n394.  Defendants are also using inappropriate chemical restraints.  Matson Tr. 1135:18-\n1136:23.  CHDC staff use medications inappropriately to manage behaviors in lieu of \nappropriate diagnoses and behavioral programs.  Matson Tr. 1135:18-1136:23.  At CHDC, \nrepeated mismatches between the actual behavioral symptoms being addressed and the purported \ndiagnoses show that the psychiatrist uses medications to chemically restrain residents.  Rather \nthan targeting symptoms typically associated with the diagnoses CHDC staff cite when justifying \nthe use of medications, they often target and taper treatment based on behaviors unrelated to the \ndiagnoses, such as aggression, self-injury, or pica.  If staff were actually treating the alleged \ndiagnosis, their target and taper criteria would focus more on typical symptoms of such \ndiagnoses.  Matson Tr. 1135:18-1136:23.   \n395.  Even if staff were not using inappropriate chemical restraints per se, CHDC’s high rate of \npsychotropic medication use – at least 50% of the residents – indicates that CHDC’s substandard \nbehavioral interventions result “in overmedication and ineffective treatments.”  Matson Tr. \n1240:8-16; Mikkelsen Tr. 3584:16-19.   \n2)  CHDC’s Frequency of Restraint Use Substantially Departs from \nProfessional Standards. \n396.  CHDC uses mechanical restraints at the “astronomical” frequency of over 1,000 times \nper month.  Matson Tr. 1126:10-18.  In April 2009 alone, CHDC staff used “planned mechanical \nrestraints,” (i.e., restraints implemented as part of a behavioral plan and not as unplanned, \nemergency restraints) 1,388 times.  Manikam Tr. 3158:8-3158:13; see, e.g., Appx. at 33, 36 \n(CHDC restrains individual residents, such as KH and NS, for extensive periods without \nadequate treatment.).  \n397.  CHDC staff mechanically restrain residents with excessive frequency compared to many \nsimilar facilities that use effective behavioral interventions and have reduced or even eliminated \n131 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 137 of 318\nmechanical restraints from individuals’ behavior programs.  See Matson Tr. 1118:4-1120:22, \n1126:7-18; Manikam Tr. 3157:5-3163:3; see also Cooper Tr. 2425:21-2426:1 (CHDC \npsychological examiner never needed to create a restraint program when working at University \nof Arkansas Medical School), 2427:14-20 (never attended professional conference or continuing \neducation class that discussed use of restraints such as the papoose board); Warren Tr. 4721:1-\n4722:4 (papoose board and restraint chairs not used by any mental hospitals where Defense \npsychiatrist practices).     \n398.  CHDC restraint data are unreliable and, while official numbers are extremely high, they \nlikely understate the amount of CHDC’s actual restraint use.  Matson Tr. 1125:17-1127:24 \n(Problems with inconsistent data reporting include separate treatment of high restraint \nindividuals.), 1260:19-1261:6 (conflicting reporting on emergency restraints), 1315:14-1318:21 \n(CHDC restraint data not informative); Manikam Tr.  3159:6-3160:6 (CHDC staff report data \ndepending on various restraint categories that make little difference in terms of restrictiveness.); \nsee also Reddig 2085:21-2086:25 (reporting varies depending on how facility chooses to classify \nrestraint, e.g., one piece jumpsuit used as “preventive restraint”), 2100:3-2103:10 (variety of \ntracking methods and omissions, such as the fact that name and time on behavior reports may not \nindicate person who filled out the behavior report or actual length of restraint use), 2108:18-22 \n(behavior reports used to record restraints and associated behaviors themselves can include all \ntypes of issues besides behaviors); Cooper Tr. 2462:1-2466:11 (CHDC uses a variety of different \nmethods for tracking and reporting different types of restraint), 2473:20-2474:18 (differences \nbetween restraint categories are unclear; restraints can be used on an emergency basis even if \nresident does not have a safety plan governing restraint use); see e.g., US Exs. CR-1, 627 (2007 \n132 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 138 of 318\nCHDC memo directing that individuals with frequent restraint use should no longer have a \nbehavior report for each restraint form). \n399.  CHDC arbitrarily uses restrictive measures that staff do not even count as restraints, such \nas personal holds (i.e., staff physically holding resident’s limbs or other body parts), and \n“separation to allow calming,” with little clinical oversight or monitoring for the appropriateness \nof these restraints or their impact on the individual and his/her behaviors.  See, e.g., Manikam Tr. \n3124:17-3126:14 (personal holds are not carefully tracked and safeguarded based on what can be \nwidely varying levels of restrictiveness for the particular hold used); Manikam Tr. 3217:7-22 \n(staff bar residents from leaving rooms, an unmonitored practice that is functionally similar to \n“seclusion”); Adams Tr. 1842:23-1844:20 (“separation to allow calming” criteria so vague that \nstaff may effectively restrict resident to room);  Matson Tr. 1144:3-1145:6 (inadequate 1 to 1 \nsupervision used rather than adequate behavioral treatment).  Moreover, CHDC's chief \npsychologist was not even familiar with the various types of personal holds that staff can use at \nCHDC.  Reddig Tr. 1983:16-1984:10.  Since CHDC does not track these measures as restraints, \nCHDC’s actual number of restrictive measures each month is even higher than CHDC reports. \n400.  While there are difficulties comparing restraint use across populations or facilities, \nstatistical comparisons reinforce conclusions of experts Dr. Matson and Dr. Manikam that \nCHDC’s restraint use is excessive and inappropriate.  Matson Tr. 1181:20-1182:12 (3-4 residents \nwith restraint programs in a facility housing 300-400 residents in expert’s practice, versus “70 \nand 80” self-reported restraint programs at CHDC, which does not include other restraints \nactually in use at CHDC, such as lap trays, seat belts, or chemical restraints), 1133:20-1134:15 \n(national study recommending minimizing use of restraints); Manikam Tr. 3157:5-3163:16 \n(general discussion of CHDC’s restraint use), 3213:25-3215:4 (comparing far more serious \n133 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 139 of 318\nbehaviors treated in other facilities that do not rely on restraints as much as CHDC does), \n3216:12-19 (discussing restraint-free or nearly restraint-free facilities); US Ex. 691.   \n3)  CHDC Utilizes Restraints Without Safeguards, Oversight, and Clinical \nReview Required by Professional Standards. \n401.  CHDC’s lack of important restraint safeguards further illustrates how CHDC restraint \npractices substantially depart from generally accepted professional standards.  Matson Tr. \n1122:13-1124:12 (poorly defined terms and policies), 1128:17-1131:4 (lack of post-restraint \nreviews); Manikam Tr. 3075:4-3077:13; US Ex. 692; Reddig Tr. 1983:16-1984:10.  CHDC \npolicies and practices do not appropriately define what CHDC considers a “restraint,” or other \nimportant terms associated with the use of restraint.  Matson Tr. 1122:13-1124:12.  Further, \nCHDC’s restraint programs fail to include clear descriptions of behaviors during which staff can \nuse the restraints.  Matson Tr. 1122:13-1124:12 (lack of clear triggers puts staff “in a horrible \nposition”).  In addition, CHDC allows “Qualified Mental Retardation Professionals” (“QMRPs”) \nto authorize the use of restraints, but CHDC’s QMRPs have substantially lower qualifications \nthan those in similar facilities.  Matson Tr. 1063:4-25, 1129:24-1130:12; US Ex. 692 (Behavior \nProcedures policy.).   \n402.  In virtually no instance do CHDC psychology staff clinically assess the circumstances \nthat led staff to use the restraint or assess the impact that the restraint had on the individual or his \nbehavior.  Such clinical, post-restraint reviews are essential because they directly affect care.  \nFor instance, post-restraint reviews should include clinical evaluation of the incident, counseling \nfor individuals traumatized by staff’s restraint, and allow staff to promptly assess and evaluate \nthe resident’s condition.  Matson Tr. 1128:17-1129:23; Manikam Tr. 3075:4-3077:4.   \n134 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 140 of 318\n403.  CHDC’s restraint practices substantially depart from generally accepted professional \nstandards of harm, causing residents harm and unnecessary risk of harm.  See generally Matson \nTr. 1120:15-22; Manikam Tr. 3160:23-3163:16. \nC.  CHDC Subjects Its Residents to Harmfully Inadequate Psychological \nTreatment. \n404.  Even though CHDC uses restraints on an extraordinarily wide scale, staff do not \ncorrespondingly provide treatment programs for a large number of residents with serious \nbehavioral and habilitation needs.  Matson Tr. 1116:11-1118:23; US Exs. 588 through 592, 598 \n& 617.  Instead, unqualified psychological examiners (master’s level practitioners) develop \ntreatment plans that do not meet generally accepted professional standards because – (1) they \ntake too long to be developed and implemented; (2) key components are located in different and \noften contradictory documents; (3) behavioral interventions are generic, with insufficient \ndifferentiation between individuals or across settings (e.g., school versus housing area); and (4) \ncritical components are missing from plans.  See FOF Part VI.C-G; US Exs. 531 through 580, \n603 through 604, 631 through 666, 687 through 690, 701-1 through 701-6.  As a result of such \ndeficiencies, CHDC residents suffer from serious behaviors without effective and timely \ntreatment.  See FOF Part VI.B-D; Matson Tr. 1084:12-1085:25; Manikam Tr. 3142:8-3145:3; \nSee generally Appx. \n1)  CHDC Does Not Develop Treatment Plans for All Residents Who Need \nThem.  \n405.  Nearly every CHDC resident has serious cognitive, communicative, and functional \nlimitations.  Most of CHDC’s residents have a variety of behaviors that require behavioral \nmanagement, such as self-injury, aggression, and pica (i.e., eating inedible objects).  Matson Tr. \n1116:11-1118:23; US Exs. 588 through 592, 598 & 617.      \n135 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 141 of 318\n406.  CHDC’s psychological services fail to meet the needs identified by CHDC staff \nthemselves.  As only 30-40 percent of CHDC residents actually have behavioral programs, either \nCHDC fails to provide services to many residents with serious behavioral problems, or CHDC \nstaff are misclassifying a large number of residents through a substandard assessment process.   \nSee Matson Tr. 1116:11-1118:23. \n2)  CHDC Fails To Modify Residents’ Behavior Plans Promptly in Response to \nChanging Needs. \n407.  Behavioral plans at CHDC are often static, and CHDC staff do not promptly re-evaluate \nand update behavioral plans based on significant changes in residents’ conditions.  Matson Tr. \n1084:12-1085:25; Manikam Tr. 3142:8-3145:3 (detailing how delays result in non-alignment of \nassessments and treatment); see, e.g., US Exs. 564, 567, 578, 580, 701-1 through 701-6.  \nGenerally accepted professional standards require that staff develop, implement, and monitor a \nmodification to the residents’ behavioral plans as soon as there is a change in behavior that \nrequires a new intervention.  See generally Matson Tr. 1084:12-1085:25; Manikam Tr. 3142:8-\n3145:3. \n408.  CHDC’s own internal e-mails admit that the “time frame for safety plan implementation \nis terrible.”  US Ex. 611; see generally Appx.  Staff also admit that residents experience long \ndelays, sometimes “several months” in “getting changes approved for the safety plans.”  Cooper \nTr. 2452:12-2453:7.  CHDC staff almost “universally acknowledge[ ]” this delay problem.  \nCooper Tr. 2452:12-2453:7.  For example, in the case of CA, it took seven months to implement \na safety plan even though CA’s behaviors were severe enough to require use of a papoose board, \nthere were no significant changes in GB’s treatment plan over the years, and staff did not \nimplement TC’s treatment plan for eight months after it was completed.  See Appx. at 12, 21, 30. \n136 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 142 of 318\n409.  Nor do CHDC’s special staffings or incident review committees adequately address \nneeded changes to resident plans, because those processes are not designed to make significant \nclinical changes to treatment based on up-to-date information.  Cooper Tr.  2431:3-2432:6.  A \n“special staffing is more like an addendum to the IPP than a change to the existing IPP.”   \nCooper Tr.  2431:3-2432:6. \n410.  Even when CHDC psychology staff ostensibly assess or reassess residents (e.g., \nidentifying the functions of behaviors), staff do not properly incorporate the assessment results \ninto treatment programs.  Matson Tr. 1069:17-1072:15; Manikam Tr. 3124:7-14.     \n3)  CHDC’s Behavioral Treatment Program Is Too Disorganized and \nConvoluted To Ensure Appropriate Care. \n411.  Expert Dr. Matson concluded that CHDC’s treatment process has some of the most \nsignificant deficiencies he has ever seen compared to the 39 centers that he has visited in 18 \nstates over a period of 30 years.  He found that CHDC’s entire treatment process is disorganized, \nwith different (and often inconsistent or contradictory) components of the behavioral programs \nlocated in multiple documents.  Matson Tr. 1286:7-1289:14.   \n412.  CHDC’s jumbled system requires that direct care staff theoretically reference safety \nplans, Quick Reference Guides (“QRG’s”), individual programs, positive behavior support plans, \nand other treatment documents when determining how to manage a resident’s issues.  This \nprocess is too convoluted to be effective. The psychology examiners themselves had \n“tremendous difficulty being able to explain the difference” between different behavioral \nprogram documents.  Matson Tr. 1287:22-1288:18; see also Adams Tr. 1787:11-1788:17 (direct \ncare staff are supposed to be familiar with multiple documents containing different components \nof the residents’ behavioral programs). \n137 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 143 of 318\n413.  CHDC staff do not implement the behavioral programs consistently across different \nsettings (e.g., in school and the living unit).  Matson Tr. 1093:21-1097:2 (CHDC’s staff overlook \nimportant considerations that affect the successful implementation of assessment and treatment \nprograms across settings), 1106:9-1107:18; US Exs. 1197 through 1198, 1201, 1214, 1216 \nthrough 1217.  \n4)  CHDC’s Generic Behavioral Programs Cannot Meet Residents’ Specific \nBehavioral Needs. \n414.  CHDC staff routinely use generic interventions to address resident behaviors that fail to \naccount for the particular elements of the resident’s behavior.  Manikam Tr. 3139:25-3142:5.  \nProfessionals who understand “behavior principles understand[] that behavior is contextual.”  \nManikam Tr. 3139:25-3142:5.  Yet CHDC often uses generic interventions for residents. Staff do \nnot differentiate between environmental settings (e.g., when a resident is in their living unit \nversus school) when developing treatment.  Similarly, staff use generic “blocking” interventions \nregardless of individual characteristics.  Manikam Tr. 3139:25-3142:5; see also US Exs. 1197 \nthrough 1198, 1201, 1203, 1211, 1214, 1216, 1217 (Arkansas’ Department of Education \nfindings). \n415.  CHDC treatment programs lack critical components necessary for successful \nintervention, such as identification and interruption of precursors to aggressive behavior.  \nManikam Tr. 3138:15-3141:24; see US Ex 621 (policy on restraints, release criteria, and \nprogramming during restraint intervals).  Precursor behavior signals impending, more obvious, \naggressive behavior.  For instance, a person may tense before making an aggressive motion.  \nWhen a person exhibits a precursor to more serious behavior, the generally accepted minimum \npractice requires staff to interrupt the chain before the more serious behavior occurs.  Yet, “nine \n138 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 144 of 318\nout of ten” CHDC plans do not even identify an individual’s precursor behavior, so staff have no \nway “to intervene before the behavior is fully exhibited.”  Manikam Tr. 3138:15-3141:24. \n416.  In many cases, CHDC plans demonstrate staff’s complete inattention to serious \nbehavioral issues.  See generally Appx.  For example, SA’s triggers for alleged self-injurious \nbehaviors were not tracked or addressed; DB’s plan identified no replacement behaviors or \nstrategies for mitigating communication issues; MB had an inadequate psychological assessment \nand treatment planning for managing eating issues, etc.  See Appx. at 21, 23, 26. \n417.  CHDC psychology staff also largely ignore their habilitative role when developing plans \nfor residents (i.e., helping to develop independent living skills).  Matson Tr. 1103:3-1106:1 \n(importance of habilitation training in basic skills, such as toileting); see also Cooper Tr. \n2459:17-2460:1 (examiner has never done habilitation training), 2456:19-20 (no psychosocial \nskills instruction); Adams Tr. 1778:15-17 (no programming for extreme food selectivity and \nrapid eating), 1793:15-1796:16 (psych examiner received no education or training on \nhabilitation); Cooper Tr. 2456:5-12 (no programming for extreme food selectivity and rapid \neating); Manikam Tr. 3101:7-3104:4, US Ex. 562-3 (no functional analysis to determine if \nresident MB may have rapid eating disorder before placement on modified diet). \n418.  The CHDC psychology staff are not even proficient with important behavioral terms of \nart, such as “treatment fidelity,” and behavioral techniques such as “reinforcement,” “shaping,” \nand “chaining.”  See Matson Tr. 1074:11-1084:11; see also Adams Tr. 1781:3-1783:5; Reddig \nTr. 2026:19-2028:19.  Such concepts and techniques serve as the foundations for behavioral \ntreatment and staff should employ them when crafting an individualized treatment plan, but \nCHDC staff have difficulties even describing these concepts and techniques, let alone applying \nthem in practice.  See Matson Tr. 1074:11-1084:11. \n139 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 145 of 318\n5)  CHDC Staff Rely on Unnecessary Restraints Rather Than Effective, \nPositive, Psychological Interventions. \n419.  When staff utilize a resident safety plan that includes “planned restraints,” CHDC has not \nrequired that staff also develop a positive behavioral support plan, which is a treatment document \nthat includes less restrictive elements such as positive reinforcement and other evidence-based \ntechniques to modify behavior.  See Reddig Tr. 1945:21-1946:23, 1947:6-8.   \n420.  CHDC’s psychology treatment programs do not include necessary safeguards to prevent \nabuses of restrictive interventions.  For example:  CHDC taper criteria fail to meet minimum \nstandards.  Matson Tr. 1089:7-14, 1135:21-1137:23, 1150:22-1153:7, 1158:7-1160:9; see e.g., \nUS Exs. 561 (resident SA), 567 (resident TC) & 571-1 (resident RC); see also Adams Tr. \n1801:20-1803:20 (equivocating on the role of taper criteria in decisions on restraint use and \ndischarge).  CHDC staff do not set effective, data-based criteria for when they expect to taper the \nuse of restrictive interventions, and even when residents meet staff’s arbitrary taper criteria, no \nexpectation exists that staff then actually reduce medications or restraints.  Matson Tr. 1089:7-\n14, 1135:21-1137:23, 1150:22-1153:7, 1158:7-1160:9.    \n421.  Psychology staff were not aware of any policy specifying the minimum number of staff \nrequired when using restraints.  See, e.g., Adams Tr. 1846:8-17; Cooper Tr. 2473:1-5. \n6)  CHDC Uses Treatment and Assessment Processes That CHDC Staff \nThemselves Admit Do Not Meet Professional Standards. \n422.  CHDC adopted the current substandard assessment and treatment process after consulting \nwith Dr. Kevin Walsh, a defense witness Defendants also used as a pre-trial psychology \nconsultant.  Dr. Walsh, however, is not a licensed psychologist.  See Reddig Tr. 1962:16- \n1963:7; Walsh Tr. 5783:19-23, 6042:3-8.  \n140 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 146 of 318\n423.  CHDC’s treatment approaches have never been subjected to peer review, formal study, or \neven studies by CHDC staff themselves to determine effectiveness.  Reddig Tr. 2066:3-23. \n424.  Published, well-established, professional standards support Drs. Matson’s and \nManikam’s expert conclusions regarding the deficiencies found at CHDC.  For example, CHDC \npsychology staff admit that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (“DSM \nIV”) represents the standard for conducting diagnosis and some of their assessments.  Matson Tr. \n1038:22-1039:19; Reddig Tr. 1973:2-12; Adams Tr. 1770:2-3 (acknowledging DSM IV is one of \nthe standards in the field); Cooper Tr. 2429:5-7 (DSM IV “considered authoritative”).   \n425.  Defendants’ own psychiatry consultant, Dr. Andrew Warren, cited to the “Expert \nConsensus Guidelines” (“ECG”) as a source of professional standards.  See generally Warren Tr. \n4742:20-4755:2.  These Guidelines, cited by Defense consultants, on their face require better \ncare than found at CDHC.  Those requirements include:  using applied behavioral analysis, \nfunctional analysis, communication and environmental assessments, psychosocial interventions, \n“most specific DSM-IV TR diagnosis possible,” behavior rating scales and psychometric tests, \nrigorous data analysis, re-assessment of diagnoses before medication modifications, and caution \nabout continued use of medications when there is no proven utility.  See generally Warren Tr. \n4742:20-4755:2, 4759:13-22 (citing ECG as a standard). \n426.  The DSM IV, ECG, journal articles, and other standards in the field specifically echo the \ngenerally accepted professional behavioral techniques and assessment approaches outlined by \nexperts Dr. Matson and Dr. Manikam.  CHDC substantially departs from these generally \naccepted practices.  See generally FOF Part VI.A-G; Warren Tr. 4742:20-4755:2, 4759:13-22.   \n427.  Numerous examples illustrate the diagnostic and assessment problems at CHDC such as \nmismatches between diagnoses and interventions, interventions based on unsound assessments, \n141 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 147 of 318\nor continued use of ineffective interventions without reassessment of “rule out diagnoses.”  See \ngenerally Appx.   \n428.  CHDC’s failure to provide adequate behavioral assessment and treatment causes \nresidents harm and unreasonable risk of harm.  Matson Tr. 1178:4-1179:18, 1305:1-1306:24, \n1312:9-1313:4; see generally Appx.  This harm manifests itself in a myriad of ways, ranging \nfrom the loss of communication and independent living skills to the physical and psychological \nharm restraint use causes.  Matson Tr. 1178:4-1179:18, 1305:1-1306:24, 1312:9-1313:4; see \ngenerally Appx.    \nD.  CHDC’s Psychological Assessment and Diagnosis Procedures Substantially \nDepart from Generally Accepted Professional Standards.  \n429.  Psychological assessments serve as the foundation for psychological treatment.  Matson \nTr. 1004:7-1006:5, 1007:1-6, 1052:24-1054:15.  One of the primary roles of a facility \npsychologist is to conduct assessments to determine an individual’s capabilities and to identify \nthe “function” (e.g., motivating factor or trigger) for an individual’s behaviors.  See, e.g., US Ex. \n555 (CHDC psychological examiner job description).  \n430.  Inaccurate psychology assessments prevent psychology staff from accurately identifying \na resident’s strengths and weaknesses or the cause of their behaviors.  As a result, the staff \ncannot develop an appropriate treatment plan.  Matson Tr. 1007:1-6, 1052:24-1054:15.  CHDC's \npsychological assessment process fails to meet professional standards because it does not:  \n(1) use reliable and effective assessment tools; (2) identify the function of maladaptive “target \nbehaviors,” (i.e., a prescribed behavior identified for change); or (3) properly incorporate basic \nassessment information in the development of treatment programs.  See generally FOF VI.D. \n431.  CHDC assessments of individuals’ behavioral needs substantially depart from generally \naccepted minimum professional standards because psychology staff do not use, and in many \n142 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 148 of 318\ncases do not even know about, basic behavioral assessment instruments and techniques.  Matson \nTr. 1006:6-1030:10 (CHDC functional assessment of behaviors do not meet minimum \nstandards), 1032:24-1040:8 (CHDC’s cognitive and adaptive function assessments do not meet \nminimum standards with 42 individuals misclassified as more severely disabled than testing \nshows), 1040:9-1050:22 (poor assessment of psychopathology (i.e., diseases of the mind) \nresulting in poor treatment and use of dubious diagnoses), 1052:24-1054:6 (processes are not \nevidence-based or scientific), 1054:7-1062:4 (data collection that underpins assessment and \ntreatment does not meet professional standards of reliability and fidelity); see also, Reddig Tr. \n1957:2-6 (CHDC Chief Psychologist admitting that he could not recall whether any of his staff \nuse peer-reviewed tests); US Exs. 1197-1198, 1201, 1203, 1211, 1214, 1216, 1217 (Arkansas' \nDepartment of Education findings).   \n1)   CHDC’s Functional Assessment Process Is Completely Inadequate for \nIdentifying the Causes of Resident Behavior. \n432.  CHDC’s functional assessments lack many of the most critical elements of a clinically \nuseful functional assessment.  See generally Matson Tr. 1007:7-1024:24. \n433.  When treating a resident’s behavioral challenge, generally accepted standards require \npsychology staff to define the maladaptive target behavior that is the focus of the behavioral \nintervention, so that staff can consistently identify and respond to the behavior.  Matson Tr. \n1019:3-19, 1024:25-1029:4, 1157:9-22; Manikam Tr. 3223:9-14, 3226:1-8.  CHDC psychology \nstaff do not understand the process for defining target behavior.  Instead of crafting an objective \ndescription of the target behavior so that all staff can consistently identify and respond to it, \nCHDC psychology staff use vague, broad terms that do not allow for faithful implementation of \nbehavior plans.  Matson Tr. 1019:3-19, 1024:25-1029:4, 1157:9-22; Manikam Tr. 3223:8-14, \n3226:1-3226:8.   \n143 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 149 of 318\n434.  After objectively defining the maladaptive target behavior, staff must assess the function \nof the behavior.  Matson Tr. 1006:6-1030:10; see Manikam Tr. 3074:3-8, 3087:23-3138:6, \n3148:11-19 (discussing examples of how failure to assess behavioral function impedes \ntreatment).   \n435.    CHDC’s process, however, actually consists of a short “worksheet” that CHDC's Chief \nPsychologist, Dr. Reddig, admits is not as rigorous as a true “functional analysis.”  Reddig Tr. \n1959:4-1961-8, 1967:6-9, 1968:15-1970:2.  Moreover, this worksheet has never been peer \nreviewed or validated.  Reddig Tr. 1959:4-1961-8, 1967:6-9, 1968:15-1970:2; Matson Tr. \n1006:6-1030:10; Manikam Tr. 3074:3-8, 3087:23-3138:6, 3148:11-19; Adams Tr. 1776:17-25 \n(CHDC does not “use any standardized measure of functional assessment that is referenced in \nthe professional literature.”); Cooper Tr. 2428:7-21 (The functional assessment form used by \nCHDC has not been “validated in any professional journal of publication.”).  Still, CHDC staff \nuse this simple worksheet as the primary means for assessing the function of behaviors across the \nfacility.  Reddig Tr. 1968:15-1970:2.   \n436.  CHDC’s functional assessment form asks staff to postulate what causes a behavior.  This \nviolates generally accepted professional standards, because extensive research demonstrates that \nwhat people “think causes something and what actually causes it when you actually do a \nsystematic [functional] evaluation are often quite different.”   Matson Tr. 1024:15-24. \n437.  This functional assessment form does not require staff to consider factors professionals \ncommonly recognize as contributing to behaviors, such as environmental conditions and histories \nof aggression between specific individuals.  Matson Tr. 1172:12-1173:19; Manikam Tr. 3095:14-\n3097:2; see, e.g., US Exs. 561-9 (NS fights) & 656 (ZS fights); see also Warren Tr. 4726:23-\n4727:1 (admitting that he saw no indication that CHDC’s psychiatrist ever looks at patterns of \n144 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 150 of 318\nrepeat injury by one resident against another).  As a result, staff often do not consider basic \ninterventions, such as separating individuals who do not get along, or moving individuals to \nsmaller settings.  Matson Tr. 1172:12-1173:19; Manikam Tr. 3095:14-3097:2.    \n438.  When staff have identified the maladaptive behavior and determined its function, they \nshould develop an intervention using that information.  CHDC staff cannot implement \ninterventions consistently, however, since target behaviors are often not clearly defined.  This \ninconsistent application makes it difficult to determine which factors “are resulting in changes in \nfrequency of behavior.”  Matson Tr. 1145:7-10, 1019:3-19, 1024:25-1029:4, 1157:9-22; \nManikam Tr. 3223:9-14, 3226:1-3226:8. \n439.  Additionally, CHDC staff conduct a single functional assessment for all target behaviors \ninstead of independently and separately assessing each behavior as required by generally \naccepted professional standards.  Matson Tr. 1095:13-1096:16.  Different behaviors may have \ncompletely different triggering conditions, so a single assessment will likely fail to provide \nadequate information.  Matson Tr. 1095:13-1096:16.  \n440.  The data that CHDC staff does collect when completing a functional assessment is not \ngathered scientifically.  Matson Tr. 1017:21-1020:8 (CHDC does not use recognized scaling \nmethods, scatter plots/graphing, or clear target behaviors), 1021:11-1022:13 (failure to ensure \nreliable data), 1145:7-1147:5 (lack of graphing and data analysis methods to differentiate \nbehavioral factors); Manikam Tr. 3226:18-3227:6.  In fact, “[e]ach individual psychological \nexaminer pretty much designs their own data collection system.”   Matson Tr. 1065:23-1066:18, \n1156:6-1157-2; see e.g., US Ex. 554.  This haphazard approach prevents CHDC from ensuring \n“continuity or standards or consistency” in care.  Matson Tr.1065:23-1066:18.  Without a \nstandard scientific approach to data collection and analysis, CHDC staff assessments about the \n145 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 151 of 318\nfunction of resident behaviors are untrustworthy and clinically unsound.  Matson Tr. 1017:21-\n1020:8, 1021:11-1022:13, 1065:23-1066:18, 1145:7-1147:5; Manikam Tr. 3226:18-3227:6; see \nalso US Ex. 612 (staff reference to trying to generate more “data type” numbers after initiation \nof litigation).     \n441.  The frequency of CHDC’s functional assessments also substantially departs from \ngenerally accepted professional standards of care.  See generally Matson Tr. 1156:9-1157:2. \nInstead of completing a new assessment any time a new maladaptive behavior appears, CHDC \nstaff prepare functional assessments only about once a year when the interdisciplinary team \nmeets.  Reddig Tr. 1971:8-1972:3. \n442.  CHDC staff do not even apply the substandard worksheet functional assessment process \nwhen assessing children unless the child has a “safety plan that includes restraint usage.”  Adams \nTr. 1790:16-1791:19.   \n2)   CHDC Assessments of Cognition, Adaptive Function, and Pain \nSubstantially Depart from Professional Standards. \n443.  CHDC’s assessment of residents’ level of cognitive and adaptive function (i.e., level of \ndevelopmental disability) does not meet generally accepted minimum professional standards in \ngeneral, and also does not even produce results that are consistent with internal CHDC standards.   \nMatson Tr. 1032:24-1040:8 (CHDC’s cognitive and adaptive function assessments do not meet \nminimum standards, and even under CHDC’s methodology, at least 42 individuals were \nmisclassified as more severely disabled than testing shows).  As a result, CHDC staff regularly \nmisclassify residents’ potential for skills training, such that residents may not receive appropriate \nhabilitation activities, which lead to greater independence.  Matson Tr. 1034:10-1035:1.   \n444.  Staff combine cognitive and adaptive test results instead of evaluating cognition based on \nthe standards established by the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV.  This improper \n146 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 152 of 318\ncombination causes CHDC staff to frequently misclassify residents as having more severe \ncognitive deficits than the residents actually have.  Staff then rely on the incorrect results and \nprovide residents with an inappropriate level of care.  Matson Tr.1038:18-1040:5.   \n445.  CHDC psychology staff should conduct assessments of communication issues, separate \nfrom the adaptive function assessment responsibilities of other CHDC departments.  At facilities \nlike CHDC, nearly “everybody has a communication problem,” and many standardized tools \nexist that allow psychology staff to address residents’ communication needs from a behavioral \nperspective.  Matson Tr. 1051:5-1052:23.  Yet, at CHDC, the psychology staff do not play a \nmeaningful role in assessing resident communication needs, even when a resident exhibits \nmaladaptive behaviors to communicate needs they cannot otherwise express.  See Matson Tr. \n1051:5-1052:23, 1079:7-1082:1 (example of failure to teach alternative communication skills \nand address communicative function of behavior for residents who exhibit aggression to \ncommunicate needs); Reddig Tr. 1988:8-21(chief psychologist unable to identify or address \ncommunication assessments because they are outside of his expertise or scope of responsibility).  \n446.  CHDC psychology staff also do not adequately assess pain issues that contribute to \nbehaviors.  Matson Tr. 1005:3-1006:5, 1030:11-15 (CHDC staff not assessing pain); see, e.g., \nAdams Tr. 1778:3-14 (no formal instrument “to track pain or how people are experiencing \npain”), Cooper Tr. 2440:4-5 (does not “use any kind of pain tracking instrument”); see also \nReddig Tr. 1950:21-1951:17 (psychologist accepting no role in pain monitoring). \n447.  CHDC staff do not assess residents’ cognitive and adaptive functioning frequently \nenough to meet residents’ needs.  Matson Tr. 1036:22-1037:15.  CHDC largely stops performing \nassessments of individuals’ cognitive and adaptive functioning once a resident reaches \n147 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 153 of 318\nadulthood, though function continues to change past adolescence and residents’ training and \ntreatment needs may shift.  Matson Tr. 1036:22-1037:15. \n3)   CHDC Staff Fail To Use Assessment Instruments That Meet Professional \nStandards. \n448.  CHDC’s psychology staff should be familiar with, and use, professionally accepted \npsychological instruments to assess individuals with developmental disabilities, because tests \nvalidated for a population are more likely to be accurate or useful.  Matson Tr. 1068:13-1069:6, \n1032:24-1050:23.  Instead, CHDC staff do not use, and indeed are unaware of, peer-reviewed \ndiagnostic instruments professionals use in their field.  See, e.g., Adams Tr. 1777:1-1778:14; \nCooper Tr. 2439:20-2440:5; Reddig Tr. 1957:2-6, 2038:24-2040:6.  CHDC’s Chief Psychologist \nadmitted that he could not recall any of his staff using peer-reviewed tests.  Reddig Tr. 1957:2-6, \n2038:24-2040:6.  The failure to use these trusted instruments is itself a violation of generally \naccepted professional standards, but CHDC’s problem is even worse – there is no consistency or \nstandard for the use of those instruments that are currently available at CHDC.  See generally \nMatson Tr. 1032:24-1050:23.   \n449.  CHDC does not use a standardized instrument for diagnosing mental illnesses that may \nbe comorbid (i.e., co-extensive) with the individual’s developmental disability.  Matson Tr. \n1040:9-1042:17. \n450.  CHDC staff also incorrectly apply the few valid/professionally acceptable tests they \nactually use.  Specifically, CHDC staff wrongly use the same test instruments for various groups \nat CHDC, notwithstanding that these tests have not been scientifically validated or shown to be \n“psychometrically sound” (i.e., normed for the characteristics of the group actually being tested) \nfor the particular group.  Matson Tr. 1035:10-1040:1 (Slosson test inappropriately used as \nclinical assessment of intellectual function across populations with varying levels of function), \n148 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 154 of 318\n1164:19-1165:9 (ICAP inappropriately used for functional assessment), 1099:16-1100:5 \n(inappropriate use of Slosson test on group of residents with deafness); see also Priest Tr. \n6668:21-24 (ICAP used at CHDC only because some State “bureaucrats” thought test would \nprovide a convenient score for determining level of appropriate service).  In fact, the Arkansas \nDepartment of Education specifically cited CHDC for using the “Slosson” brief intelligence test \ninappropriately on individuals who are deaf.  Matson Tr. 1099:13-1100:3; US Ex. 1203. \n4)   CHDC’s Unreliable Assessments Generate Unsupportable Psychiatric \nDiagnoses That Substantially Depart from Professional Standards. \n451.  CHDC does not base many of the “diagnoses” that form the foundation of CHDC’s \npsychiatric disorder treatments on scientific or clinically defensible assessments.  Matson Tr. \n1189:11-19, 1040:9-1050:22 (CHDC does not use validated diagnostic tools, and its substandard \nmethodology for assessing psychopathology results in unsupportable diagnoses and inadequate \ntreatment); US Exs. 553-1 (client census summaries) & 662 (pica list).  \n452.  Rather than using a “rule out diagnosis” that allows a clinician to determine \nsystematically whether a diagnosis is appropriate over time, CHDC uses its own informal \nprocedure, one that often produces ostensibly persistent, but unreliable diagnoses, that then \nbecome the basis for inappropriate treatment.  Matson Tr. 1040:9-1050:20.  Defendants did not \nprovide any example where a diagnosis was clearly identified as “rule out” and then carefully re-\nassessed with further testing and evaluation.  See Warren Tr. 4725:7-22 (Defense psychiatrist \nacknowledging that in field, professionals use the term “rule out” or “provisional diagnosis” but \nnever could not recall seeing these terms used by CHDC’s own staff).      \n453.  Numerous examples of poorly substantiated diagnoses show CHDC’s substandard \ndiagnostic procedures, and raise serious concerns about the appropriateness of CHDC’s \npsychological and psychiatric interventions.  See, e.g., US Exs. 631 (Resident EA – psychotic \n149 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 155 of 318\ndisorder due to microcephaly), 632 (Resident MLA – mental retardation and personality change \ndue to hydrocephalus), 633 (Resident RDA – obsessive compulsiveness in a profoundly retarded \nresident who lacks the level of cognition necessary to have such a disorder), 634 (Resident WLB \n– myopia/personality change due to microcephaly), 640-1 (Resident JS combination of obsessive \ncompulsive disorder with both dementia and schizophrenia, which are in many ways \nincompatible with the former); see also Warren Tr. 4725:4-6 (Defendants’ psychiatric consultant \nhas never himself made a diagnoses of “psychotic disorder due to microcephalus”). \nE.  CHDC’s Substandard Data Collection Is Unreliable. \n454.  CHDC psychology staff fail to properly collect and utilize reliable, objective data for \nassessment, diagnoses, and ultimately treatment.  See generally Matson Tr. 1017:21-1020:8 \n(CHDC does not use recognized scaling methods, scatter plots/graphing, or clear target \nbehaviors), 1021:11-1022:13 (failure to ensure reliable data), 1145:7-1147:5 (lack of graphing \nand data analysis methods to differentiate behavioral factors), 1056:15-1062:4 (no reliability or \ntreatment fidelity measures), 1064:1-1065:19 (staff use of unreliable, after-the-fact, “data type” \nnumbers and ad hoc data collection forms); Manikam Tr. 3226:13-3227:6 (none of the functional \nassessments reviewed included necessary data collection, reliability checks and other data \nanalysis); see also Adams Tr. 1805:9-15 (no statistical tools or normalizing performed on data); \nCooper Tr. 2428:3-6 (examiner has never heard of data observation sheets used by other staff at \nCHDC);  Warren Tr. 4718:9-25 (trend lines and scatter plots are used by community psychology \nprovider that Defendants’ consultant works with in his own practice); Priest Tr. 6629:8-17, \n6630:19-6631:3 (admitting psychology staff limited to essentially a paper review in their \noversight of data collection by direct care staff); US Ex. 612 (psychology department e-mail \ncalling for generation of “data type” behavioral numbers issued only in 2009).   \n150 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 156 of 318\n455.  Behavior plans should be assessed on their effectiveness and this, in turn, is measured by \nreference to behavior data.  Conversely, at CHDC, only about 18 percent of the behavioral \nprograms include graphs of behavioral data.  Manikam Tr. 3152:12-20.  Even when CHDC uses \ngraphs, the graphs are typically just simple bar graphs, without even trend lines or other \nstatistical analysis necessary to identify interventions’ effects on, and change to, behaviors.  \nManikam Tr. 3152:12-3153:12; see also Warren Tr. 4718:9-25 (trend lines and scatter plots used \nby community psychology service provider in Defendants’ consultant’s own practice). \n456.  When they do record some data, CHDC staff  track and focus on the wrong elements.  \nFor example, when assessing the effectiveness of treatment on behaviors, CHDC historically \nemphasizes tracking incidents of restraint, instead of plotting the core behaviors themselves.  \nMatson Tr. 1067:2-1068:12; US Ex. 682.  Restraint use is not an accurate means of tracking \nindividual progress, as restraints can decrease even as behaviors increase.  Matson Tr. 1067:2-\n1068:12; Manikam Tr. 3152:4-3155:12. \nF.  CHDC’s Psychology Services Substantially Depart from Generally Accepted \nProfessional Standards Because CHDC Lacks Sufficient Psychology Staff \nwith the Education, Training, and Experience Required for the Treatment of \nIndividuals with Developmental Disabilities. \n457.  CHDC psychology services fail to meet resident’s needs, because the psychology \ndepartment’s staff lack the critical education, training, and experience required to provide the \ntype of treatment CHDC residents require.  Manikam Tr. 3081:17-3084:10; Matson Tr. 1182:17-\n1187:16; see FOF Part VI.F. \n458.  Generally, the CHDC psychology staff’s education, experience, and training leaves them \nunprepared to assess and treat individuals with developmental disabilities or the types of \nbehavioral issues found at CHDC.  Manikam Tr. 3081:17-3084:10; Matson Tr. 1182:17-1187:16;  \nUS Exs. 556, 557, 607, 614; see also Adams Tr. 1765:4-1769:23 (testimony admitting \n151 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 157 of 318\nexaminer’s limited training, experience, and exposure to professional activities); Cooper Tr. \n2422:19-2427:22 (same); Priest Tr. 6621:23-6626:21, 6667:1-8 (senior examiner with \nindependent practice privileges unfamiliar with basic terms and admitting limits to training and \nexperience).   \n459.  When providing clinical psychological care, CHDC relies almost entirely on poorly \nsupervised, master’s level practitioners, who in many cases are unfamiliar with basic concepts \nand terms used in the field of applied behavioral analysis.  These master’s level practitioners \nconduct assessments and behavioral treatment that should normally be handled by doctorate level \npsychologists, or others with similar, extensive training and experience.  Manikam Tr. 3081:17-\n3084:10; Matson Tr. 1182:17-1187:16.  \n460.  CHDC’s master’s level practitioners (“psychological” or “psych” “examiners”) lack the \neducation, experience, and training needed to assess and treat the individuals with developmental \ndisabilities with the behavioral issues found at CHDC.  Most of the examiners possess a \n“secondary [psychology] license,” a status that most other states do not recognize.  Matson Tr. \n1182:17-1187:16; US Exs. 555 through 557, 607 & 614.     \n461.  CHDC does not employ enough qualified psychology staff with doctorate level training.   \nMatson Tr. 1183:18-1190:25; Manikam Tr. 3084:1-10.  CHDC employs only one doctorate level \npsychologist to provide clinical supervision for its psychology department.  This supervisor, \nChief Psychologist Dr. Carl Reddig, has a doctorate in counseling education.  Dr. Reddig does \nnot have the type of education, experience, and training needed to assess and treat individuals \nwith behavioral issues at CHDC.  Matson Tr. 1183:18-1190:25; Manikam Tr. 3084:1-10. \n152 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 158 of 318\n462.  American Psychological Association policy states that a person must have a doctorate \ndegree to be a licensed psychologist.  Matson Tr. 1184:14-1185:23.  Therefore, CHDC “psych \nexaminers” cannot even hold themselves out to the public as “psychologists.” \n463.  Even under Arkansas’s standards, four of CHDC’s psychological examiners cannot \npractice independently.  Reddig Tr. 2099:9-11, see also Glenn Tr. 6689:11-16 (six CHDC \npsychological examiners practice independently).  \n464.  Notably, psychology staff at CHDC have little exposure to practices outside of Arkansas.   \nSee generally Adams Tr. 1765:4-1769:23; Cooper Tr. 2422:19-2427:22; US Exs. 556, 607 & \n614.  For a number of the psychology staff, their first, and often only, significant work \nexperience was at CHDC.  The Chief Psychologist himself rarely participates in significant \nprofessional activities – such as publishing in professional journals or attending national \nconferences.  Reddig Tr. 1942:22-1943:22, 1977:14-20. \n465.  Residents in a developmental center receive such placement primarily “because of \nproblems in learning.”  Matson Tr. 1002:20-1004:6.  In an ICF/MR, treatment should therefore \nfocus on resident training.  More specifically, treatment for individuals with developmental \ndisabilities should target “issues such as communication training, training in terms of \nindependent living skills,” and training on skills that would help reduce aggression, self-injury, \nand other challenging behaviors.  Professionals generally classify the relevant psychological \ntechniques used to train individuals with developmental disabilities as “operant conditioning” or \n“applied behavior analysis.”  Matson Tr. 1002:23-1004:6.   \n466.  Because of communication and cognitive issues, CHDC residents need to receive training \nwith methods based on applied behavioral analysis.  Most of the psychology staff, however, hold \ndegrees in counseling psychology, education, or another field that does not provide sufficient \n153 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 159 of 318\nbackground in applied behavioral analysis; nor do such degrees typically include training on \ndevelopmental disabilities in general.  Matson Tr. 1186:15-21; see also Adams Tr. 1767:5-12  \n(counseling not done as much in current position because of communication issues); Cooper Tr. \n2422:24-2423:14 (psychological counseling not normally requested or provided at CHDC). \n467.  CHDC psychological staff do not have a solid understanding of basic terms and \ntechniques used in applied behavioral analysis and for the treatment of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities.  Matson Tr. 1072:6-1084:11 (discussing concepts such as \n“reliability,” “treatment fidelity,” “reinforcement,” “shaping,” “chaining,” “replacement \nbehaviors,” and the “ABC[’s]” of behaviorism); Manikam Tr. 3221:11-22 (direct interviews of \npsychology staff showed they do not understand basic terms); see also Adams Tr. 1781:3-1783:5 \n(CHDC staff do not use or even recognize various behavioral techniques); Cooper Tr. 2432:23-\n2433:17 (examiners use no standards to guide identification of reinforcers); Priest Tr. 6621:23-\n6626:21, 6667:1-8 (admissions regarding senior psych examiner training and experience); \nReddig Tr. 2026:4-2030:15, 2037:2-4 (offering definitions of key concepts that differ from his \nown staff’s definitions); see generally Appx. (examples of poor behavioral care include residents \nCA, SA, DB, GB, HB, MB, TB, CC, RLC, RC, TC, JD, KF, BH, KH, PH, JM, BLR, WR, JS, \nNS, ZS, LW, MW).   \n468.  Dr. Reddig himself admits that not one of his psychological examiners is qualified to do a \nfunctional analysis, which, if done in accordance with generally accepted professional standards, \nserves as an essential foundation for treating an individual’s behavioral issues.  Reddig Tr. \n2098:12-2099:1; see also Matson Tr. 1007:1-1014:24.   \n469.  Making sure staff actually implement written programs serves as a basic component of \nany treatment system; yet CHDC does not have these required formal “treatment fidelity” \n154 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 160 of 318\nmeasures.  Matson Tr. 1060:4-1062:4; see also Reddig Tr. 1991:15-1992:1 (admitting no formal \ntreatment fidelity measures). \n470.  CHDC direct care staff do not receive adequate “competency training” to ensure that they \nknow how to accurately implement and track behavioral programs.  Matson Tr. 1131:5-1132:2; \nManikam Tr. 3081:8-16, 3082:4-3083:22; US Exs. 582 & 583.  “Competency training,” where \nstaff perform tasks and show understanding, is an essential component for training staff to \nimplement behavioral programs.  Manikam Tr. 3081:8-16, 3082:4-3083:22.  At CHDC, \nhowever, direct care staff basically receive only two weeks of training, and then take a written \ntest.  Matson Tr. 1131:14-1132:2; US Exs. 582 & 583.  This short, non-competency-based \ntraining, is not nearly sufficient to ensure that direct care staff know how to implement \nbehavioral programs.  Matson Tr. 1131:5-1132:2; Manikam Tr. 3081:8-16, 3082:4-3083:22; see \nalso Cooper Tr. 2471:12-22 (“floaters” do not receive even multiple choice test).   \n471.  CHDC psychology staff repeatedly made facially dubious statements, such as claiming \nthat their data is a “hundred percent reliable,” “no one was injured as a result of restraints in the \nfacility,” and there is no way to manage out-of-bounds behavior with operant conditioning.  \nManikam Tr. 3129:25-3132:7; see also US Ex. 691 (broad study noting dangers of using \nrestraints).  Such statements show serious gaps in training and experience.   \n472.  Despite repeated notice from the United States and other outside auditors, CHDC \npsychology staff have not made necessary efforts to self-correct their substandard practices.  \nThere are a variety of means of ensuring that psychology staff obtain an adequate “background \nin applied behavior analysis” including sending staff to other facilities to do a “practicum” for \nseveral months or bringing qualified behaviorists to provide training.  Manikam Tr. 3220:3-\n155 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 161 of 318\n3221:10.  During the trial, Defendants never introduced evidence indicating that they have even \nattempted such basic remedial measures. \n473.  Psychology staff have not conducted any needs assessment to clearly determine the level \nof staffing necessary to serve individuals of CHDC, where almost 300 residents have dual \ndiagnoses and 171 have significant behavioral issues.  See generally Reddig Tr. 2067:19-2072:8 \n(admitting lack of effort to evaluate or address variety of deficiencies at CHDC).   \nG.  CHDC Does Not Provide Psychology Staff with Adequate Clinical \nSupervision. \n474.  CHDC does not provide the level of professional oversight which could mitigate \nproblems with psychology staff qualifications.  A single, doctorate level psychologist \ntheoretically oversees the psychology department.  In practice, however, the Chief Psychologist \nprovides little clinical oversight.  Moreover, the Chief Psychologist himself does not have the \nlevel of education, training, and experience required to treat many of the residents.  See generally \nMatson Tr. 1183:1-1187:12 (discussing level of training expected for a psychologist working \nwith CHDC’s population, which would include both extensive course work and relevant clinical \nexperience); see FOF Part VI.F-G. \n475.  Since June 2004, Dr. Carl Reddig, CHDC’s Chief Psychologist and only doctorate level \npractitioner, has overseen CHDC’s psychology department.  Matson Tr. 1188:16-1190:25; \nReddig Tr. 1936:20-1937:24; Adams Tr. 1784:3-7.    \n476.   Dr. Reddig received his educational degree from the education department of a \nuniversity, not the psychology department, and his background lacks extensive training on \napplied behavioral analysis or the treatment of individuals with developmental disabilities.  See \nReddig Tr. 1940:13-18 (no coursework on applied behavioral analysis), 1940:19-1941:1 (only \ninternship was at CHDC). \n156 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 162 of 318\n477.  At the time of his deposition, Dr. Reddig could not identify any reference books or \ntreatises for his field.  Reddig Tr. 1977:6-24. \n478.  Dr. Reddig has not attended any professional conference except one, held by CHDC itself \nin the last five years.  Reddig Tr. 1943:18-22. \n479.  No one supervises Dr. Reddig clinically.  Reddig Tr. 1942:19-21. \n480.  Dr. Reddig does not typically carry a clinical caseload, so psychological examiners \nprovide nearly all clinical care.  See Reddig Tr. 1937:9-15. \n481.  Dr. Reddig spends only about two to four hours a week in the living units.  Reddig Tr. \n2015:4-11.  This level of doctorate staffing is completely inadequate given the CHDC residents’ \nneeds.  Matson Tr. 1183:18-22. \n482.  Since the psych examiners do not have doctorate degrees required for licensing, they \ncannot hold themselves out to be psychologists and are instead considered the “primary treating \npsych examiners.”  Reddig Tr. 2018:14-22.  At the same time, Dr. Reddig does not consider \nhimself to be the primary treating psychologist for any CHDC resident.  Reddig Tr. 2018:14-22.  \nIn other words, no CHDC resident has a primary treating psychologist. \n483.  The Chief Psychologist exercises limited oversight over the examiners, with little actual \nsubstantive clinical review of their work.  For example, Dr. Reddig does not generally review the \ncognitive assessments, functional assessment sheets, “strategies,” or behavioral data the psych \nexaminers compile. Reddig Tr. 2014:18-21, 1990:5-16; Adams Tr. 1786:1-18; Cooper Tr. \n2447:24-2448:17.  One psychology examiner could only recall Dr. Reddig making “typo \nchanges” when he reviews her work.  Cooper Tr. 2447:15-23. \n157 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 163 of 318\n484.  Even though every person at CHDC is on his department’s caseload, Dr. Reddig admits \nhe does not actually review every Individual Program Plan - one of the most important treatment \ndocuments generated at CHDC.  Reddig Tr. 2015:1-3, 1937:18-21. \n485.  Dr. Reddig does not participate meaningfully in team treatment planning, including \nIDT’s responsible for reviewing treatment plans, the Human Rights Committee (“HRC”) that \nreviews restraints and restrictive measures, or the Incident Review Committees (“IRCs”) that are \nresponsible for reviewing behavior reports and incidents.  US Ex. 602 (Incident Review \nCommittee membership list); Reddig Tr. 1956:2-3 (no participation in IDTs), 1980:23-1981:9 \n(no participation in HRC team), 2005:12-2006:18 (no participation in IRCs). \n486.  Dr. Reddig left CHDC for a few months in 2010, with staff assuming he had left \npermanently, before returning to his old position.  See Adams Tr. 1784:3-1785:25; Cooper Tr. \n2444:10-2445:20; Reddig Tr. 1937:25-1938:18.    \n487.  During this period when the Chief Psychologist position was apparently vacant, Dr. \nWyrick served as acting clinical supervisor, though he was based at the Booneville Human \nDevelopment Center, and testifying psychology examiners only saw him one to three times \nduring the entire period he was acting as Chief Psychologist.  Adams Tr. 1784:3-1785:25; \nCooper Tr. 2444:10-2445:20.  While he was clinical director, the staff were even more poorly \nsupervised than when Dr. Reddig was serving as Chief Psychologist.  See Adams Tr. 1784:3-\n1785:25; Cooper Tr. 2444:10-2445:20.     \n488.  CHDC does not have important standardized procedures, rendering quality assurance, \nclinical oversight, and data comparisons unreliable.  Numerous examples of this serious \ndeficiency exist, such as a lack of consistency in the use of basic terms and a general absence of \nformal training and quality assurance mechanisms.  Cooper Tr. 2452:4-8 (no standard definition \n158 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 164 of 318\nof “physical injury”); Matson Tr. 1025:10-1027:10 (problematic definition of “aggression”); see \nReddig Tr. 1950:21-1952-23, 1953:5-1955:3 (Chief Psychologist plays little role in overseeing \ncompliance with various CHDC policies), 2000:9-16 (no formal mechanism to ensure staff \ncompliance with written safety plans, i.e., “treatment fidelity”), 1992:2-1994:3, 2002:16-2003:25 \n(data collection process relies largely on discretion of low level staff when filling out behavior \nreports and similar documents), 2008:5-16 (no formal staff training on how to report antecedent \nconditions), 2014:1-10 (Chief Psychologist does not train staff on restraint use), 2009:4-2011:16 \n(no formal quality assurance system to monitor psychology and direct care staff), 2017:11-19 \n(Chief Psychologist not familiar with facility injury tracking process); US Exs. 558 (CHDC \npsychology policies), 594 (behavior emergency procedures form) & 622-1(CHDC restraint \npolicies). \nVII.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW – PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL SERVICES \nDefendants harm CHDC residents with psychology and behavioral services that violate \nresidents’ federal rights to freedom from unreasonable restraints, protection from serious harm, \nand psychological treatment in the most integrated setting appropriate to their individual needs. \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 315-18; see also Part III, supra.  CHDC’s psychology and behavioral \nservices fail to provide psychological services necessary to meet the minimum treatment and \nhabilitation needs of CHDC residents.     \nA.  CHDC’s Psychological and Behavioral Services Violate Residents’ \nConstitutional Right to Habilitation and Treatment. \nDefendants harm residents with substandard psychological and behavioral services that \nunlawfully rely on unqualified staff who fail to professionally assess and treat CHDC residents in \norder to meet their minimum psychological and behavioral needs.  CHDC’s substandard \n159 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 165 of 318\ntreatment of residents so substantially departs from generally accepted professional standards, \nthat the CHDC psychological and behavioral management program violates the Constitution.1  \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 323; see also Part III, supra (discussing federal statutory right to \ntreatment in most integrated setting).   \nFirst, CHDC does not have sufficient professional staff, qualified by training, education, \nor experience, to provide psychological and behavioral services at CDHC.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. \nat 323 n.30.  Instead, CHDC relies heavily on inadequately trained psychology “examiners” and \ndirect care staff to develop, implement, and monitor programs that require a higher level of \nskilled practitioner to meet generally accepted professional standards.  No one disputes that these \nstaff are treating CHDC residents with often complicated conditions requiring specialized care.  \nThe Supreme Court has clearly required, however, that treating professionals must possess the \nqualifications necessary to provide the care for which they are responsible.  Id.  Simply meeting \nstate licensing standards should not be considered automatically sufficient under federal law, \nespecially in a case involving the United States’ direct enforcement of individuals’ federal rights.  \nHere, CHDC psychology examiners lack the education and experience required to utilize \nbehavioral management alternatives to restraints.  Adequate treatment for individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities requires the use of specialized techniques, whose effectiveness is \n                                                 \n1   Professional decisions about a resident’s services must be based upon the \nindividuals’ needs, not available services or administrative convenience.  See Ohlinger v. \nWatson, 652 F.2d 775, 779 (9th Cir. 1981) (“Lack of funds, staff or facilities cannot justify the \nState’s failure to provide appellants with that treatment necessary for rehabilitation.”); see also \nThomas S. v. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178, 1200 (W.D.N.C. 1988) (“Professional judgment \nprobably was not exercised if it was modified to conform to available treatment rather than \nappropriate treatment.”) (internal citation omitted); Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 629 F. Supp. 1487, 1495 \n(N.D. Tex. 1986) (“Evidence that the professional judgment was made to conform to what was \navailable may indicate that the judgment was a substantial departure from accepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.”) (internal quotations omitted).   \n \n160 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 166 of 318\nsupported by bodies of research.  CHDC staff lack training and familiarity with these techniques \nand supporting research.  The implementation of these techniques requires understanding of \nunderlying concepts and terms of art.  Unfortunately, admissions and case examples repeatedly \ndemonstrate that CHDC examiners lack the necessary understanding for many of the terms and \nconcepts that they are supposedly using to manage challenging behaviors.  Additionally, CHDC \nallows some examiners, who cannot practice independently even under state law, to operate with \nno effective clinical supervision.  CHDC employs only one doctorate level practitioner in the \nentire psychology department, and given the number of residents needing treatment, this level of \nclinical oversight is facially problematic.  Moreover, the only doctorate practitioner at CHDC is \nhimself unfamiliar with many of the basic concepts and tools professionals use in the field.  His \nreview of clinical treatment is mostly a paper review, not a clinical one.  Defendants cannot \nclaim to be meeting the Youngberg “professional judgment” standard when they literally do not \nemploy enough qualified professionals to make such judgments.  By themselves, CHDC’s \nstaffing and supervision deficiencies prove that the Defendants cannot be meeting their \nobligation to provide constitutional treatment.   \nSecond, CHDC psychological and behavioral services violate the Constitution because \nstaff regularly fail to conduct appropriate assessments and diagnoses of individuals in their care.  \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 318-23.  The Defendants do not meet constitutional standards just \nbecause a person with a license made a decision.  To satisfy the standard, the decision must \nactually reflect “professional judgment,” a legal term of art.  Id. at 322-23.  At minimum, \nevidence must show that such professional judgment was indeed exercised.  Id.  This standard is \nnot met when a professional’s decision substantially departs from generally accepted standards \nor practice.  Id.; see also Thomas S., 902 F.2d 250, 252-53 (4th Cir. 1990) (treating \n161 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 167 of 318\nprofessional’s decision not conclusive in determining whether professional judgment was indeed \nexercised).   \nThe routine use of idiosyncratic forms and assessment methods, that the Defendants’ own \nstaff admit have no proven scientific validity, is among the ways that CHDC staff’s decision-\nmaking substantially departs from professional standards.  Staff do not use, or are not even aware \nof, a host of scientifically validated instruments utilized by professionals in their field.  When \nCHDC’s idiosyncratic assessments occur, they are completed on a fixed schedule, rather than in \nresponse to observed changes in condition.  The psychology staff take months to reassess and \nadjust treatment.  As a result of CHDC’s seriously flawed assessment process, many CHDC \nassessments of residents’ cognition, adaptive function, psychopathology, pain, behaviors, and \neven physical condition, are seriously flawed.   \nSimilarly, CHDC data collection and analysis, which is a foundation for assessment and \ntreatment, substantially departs from professional standards.  At CHDC, psychology staff do not \nunderstand some of the most basic concepts and techniques used by behaviorists to properly \nmeasure and evaluate target behaviors.  This data issue is particularly problematic, because \npsychology staff serve as a linchpin for CHDC’s facility-wide data collection and analysis \nprocess.  The treatment teams and consulting professionals, such as CHDC’s physicians and \npsychiatrist, use examiner data for making major changes in treatment.   \nIn other words, even if the psychology staff meet minimum professional qualifications, \ntheir failure to establish the foundations for treatment using appropriate assessment instruments, \nforms, and data collection techniques, means that CHDC psychology services substantially \ndepart from generally accepted professional standards.  Without proper assessments, the staff \ncannot exercise “professional judgment” in an adequate, legal sense. \n162 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 168 of 318\nThird, CHDC’s psychological and behavioral services substantially depart from generally \naccepted professional standards, because psychology staff fail to develop, implement, monitor, \nand update appropriate behavioral treatment plans to address the residents’ serious needs.   \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 315-23.  Without effective treatment programs, staff rely on \ninappropriate restraints and other unsafe interventions.  Staff take months to develop and \nimplement treatment plans, which is simply too long given the dynamic environment at CHDC \nand the residents’ changing needs.  Additionally, once a plan is developed, CHDC has no \neffective procedures in place to ensure treatment fidelity, i.e., procedures to ensure that staff are \nactually implementing plans in a consistent, organized fashion.  Different and inconsistent \ninterventions appear in a variety of documents in an individual’s file, and staff training is not \n“competency”-based.  The lack of up-to-date, effective treatment plans, that are implemented \nwith fidelity, leads to unnecessary restraint and means that residents are not learning skills that \npromote independence. \nAs a result of these deficiencies in CHDC’s psychological services, CHDC continues to \nfail to address residents’ conditions, which allows residents to repeatedly harm themselves or \nothers.  CHDC’s deficiencies go well beyond a simple disagreement between qualified \nprofessionals about diagnosis, assessment, or treatment.  CHDC staff literally do not, and cannot, \nprovide the minimum level of psychological treatment the Constitution requires.    \nB.  CHDC Harms Residents with Unlawful Restraints That Violate the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nCHDC’s restraint of residents as a “first option” violates the Constitution, causing \nresidents psychological and physical harm.  Professional standards require that treatment staff \nuse seclusion and restraint as a last resort, only when an individual represents a danger to himself \nor others.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 316-18; Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. \n163 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 169 of 318\nv. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1245 (2d Cir. 1984) (holding that all patients of mental health \ninstitutions have a right to freedom from undue bodily restraint); Thomas S., 699 F. Supp. at \n1189 (“Seclusion and restraint should only be used as a last resort.”).  CHDC’s routine reliance \non inappropriate restrictive measures, rather than on less intrusive and less restrictive applied \nbehavioral techniques – such as teaching alternative communication strategies and developing \neffective reinforcement programs – violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  Youngberg, 457 U.S. at \n315-19; Thomas S., 699 F. Supp. at 1189 (“It is a substantial departure from professional \nstandards to rely routinely on seclusion and restraint rather than systematic behavior techniques \nsuch as social reinforcement to control aggressive behavior.”).   \nCHDC’s overreliance on restraints causes psychological and physical harm, as well as an \nongoing serious risk of harm to the individuals CHDC subjects to these substandard restraints.  \nSee, e.g., Nat’l Ass’n of Psychiatric Health Systems v. Shalala, 120 F. Supp. 2d 33, 45 (D.D.C. \n2000) (“[S]evere psychological and physical injuries . . . can and do result from inappropriate use \nof restraints.”).  Such resident harm includes both the direct harm that residents incur from the \nactual restraint, as well as the harm that results from inadequately treated psychological \nconditions.   \nFederal regulations and statutes provide guidance on contemporary standards in this area.  \nFederal regulations emphasize that restraints should be used only if “necessary,” which means \nused only at a minimum, and expressly prohibit the use of restraints as a substitute for “active \ntreatment.”  See 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.420(a)(6) & 483.450(b)(3).  “Active treatment” requires that \nthe State ensure that its treatment for individuals with developmental disabilities includes \n“aggressive, consistent implementation of a program of specialized and generic training, \ntreatment, health services and related services . . . that is directed toward (i) The acquisition of \n164 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 170 of 318\nthe behaviors necessary for the [individual] to function with as much self determination and \nindependence as possible; and (ii) The prevention or deceleration of regression or loss of current \noptimal functional status.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.440(a).  Yet CHDC’s psychology program lacks \neven the basic components of a standard clinical treatment process, let alone providing anything \nresembling “active treatment.”   \nIn place of adequate habilitation and treatment to protect residents from harm, CHDC \nstaff routinely and illegally utilize unnecessary, unsafe, and inappropriate mechanical and \nchemical restraints.  See Thomas S., 699 F. Supp. at 1189; 42 C.F.R. § 483.450.  Both the types \nof restraints used, and the frequency of their use, violate constitutional limits.  See Thomas S., \n699 F. Supp. at 1189; 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.420(a)(6) & 483.450(b)(3).  CHDC employs a number of \nparticularly egregious practices, including widespread use of the archaic papoose board and \nroutine application of unnecessary restraints on children.  CHDC’s excessive use of mechanical \nrestraints, again especially on children, has little, if any, support in either professional practice or \nthe literature.  Indeed, many states have prohibited their use on children.  Defendants have \nexacerbated this unconstitutional harm by failing to adopt important safeguards on restraint use, \nsuch as conducting thorough, post-incident, clinical reviews.  Some CHDC practices, such as \npersonal holds and “separation to allow calming,” lack even the attention and monitoring given \nto mechanical restraints. \nWithout substantial improvements in CHDC’s unlawfully deficient psychological \nservices, Arkansas will continue to unnecessarily institutionalize, segregate, restrain, and \notherwise harm individuals with developmental disabilities.  Defendants’ continued failure to \nmake even minimal modifications to existing psychological and behavioral treatment programs, \nsuch as providing relevant applied behavioral services, providing more communication \n165 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 171 of 318\nassistance to deaf residents, developing community-based behavioral programs, and developing \npractical habilitation plans, demonstrates Defendants’ unlawful discrimination against \nindividuals with developmental disabilities.

FINDINGS OF FACT – PSYCHIATRY \n489.  CHDC’s psychiatric services systemically and seriously deviate from generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care, with fatal or near fatal consequences.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3573:22-21; \nHolloway Tr. 2620:17-2621:3.  CHDC’s failure to provide routine and emergency psychiatric \nservices substantially departs from generally accepted professional practices.  Holloway Tr. \n2621:10-13; see FOF ## 504-637.   \n490.  CHDC harms residents through subjecting them to psychiatric care that substantially \ndeparts from generally accepted minimum professional standards in several elements of \npsychiatric care.  Specifically, CHDC harms residents by:  needlessly exposing them to \npsychotropic medications with serious and dangerous side effects; using clinically deficient \ndiagnoses to justify the unwarranted use of medications; engaging in unjustified medication \npractices (including prescribing medications to suppress another medication’s side effects, in \nresponse to non-psychiatric environmental behaviors, and as chemical restraints); providing \nclinically deficient assessments of medication efficacy; providing untimely psychiatric \nassessments and follow up care; and failing to provide adequate clinical oversight, training, and \nsupport to CHDC’s psychiatrist.  See FOF ## 504-637. \nA.  Drs. Holloway and Mikkelsen Provided Credible Expert Testimony Detailing \nCHDC’s Substandard Psychiatry Services. \n491.  Dr. Holloway has provided extensive psychiatric treatment to individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities in institutional settings for the last 18 years.  Holloway Tr. 2485:24-\n2486:3; US Ex. 866.  Dr. Holloway currently works as statewide psychiatric consultant to the \nState of Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals Office for Citizens with Developmental \n168 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 174 of 318\n \nDisabilities.  Holloway Tr. 2483:19-2484:3; US Ex. 866.  Working at two developmental centers \nin Louisiana, Dr. Holloway trains psychiatric residents and medical students in the provision of \npsychiatric care to individuals with developmental disabilities.  Holloway Tr. 2486:9-25; US Ex. \n866.   \n492.   Dr. Holloway is triple-board certified in psychiatry, child psychiatry, and forensic \npsychiatry.  Holloway Tr. 2484:24-25; US Ex. 866.  In 2009, Dr. Holloway successfully \nunderwent board recertification in psychiatry in the law.  Holloway Tr. 2488:21-23.  She is an \nactive member of many medical, psychiatric, and developmental disability associations.  \nHolloway Tr. 2485:4-8; US Ex. 866.   \n493.  Dr. Holloway has advised two states, Louisiana and Tennessee, regarding the psychiatric \nstandards of care for individuals with developmental disabilities who live in residential training \nfacilities.  Holloway Tr. 2487:4-9, 2619:6-2620:13; US Ex. 866. \n494.  Dr. Holloway’s review of CHDC consisted of:  looking for policies and procedures \nregarding the provision of psychiatric care and interviewing CHDC staff involved in residents’ \npsychiatric care (including the consulting psychiatrist, pharmacists, and some psychologists).  \nHolloway Tr. 2499:16-2500:9.  Dr. Holloway also selected and reviewed CHDC’s psychiatric \ncare for a reasonable sample of residents with a wide range of psychiatric needs.  Holloway Tr. \n2501:2-2502:2.  In doing so, Dr. Holloway used the same methods of review that she has used in \nevaluating care as a consultant for the States of Louisiana and Tennessee.  Holloway Tr. \n2503:23-25.   \n495.  Dr. Holloway based her assessment of, and conclusions regarding, CHDC’s psychiatric \ncare on the generally accepted professional standards on which she was trained when obtaining \n169 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 175 of 318\n \nthree psychiatric board certifications; her career-long, extensive experience providing psychiatric \ncare and designing care for individuals with developmental disabilities in institutions who are \ncomparable to CHDC residents; and information obtained from medical academies, literature, \npeer-reviewed journals, textbooks, the psychiatry in the law recertification she recently \nunderwent, formal residency rotation guidelines, evidence-based practices, peer review to which \nher clinical work recently has been subjected, and other sources.  Holloway Tr. 2488:7-2489:17. \n496.  Dr. Mikkelsen is an adult and child psychiatrist who has been providing psychiatric \nservices to individuals with developmental disabilities for 32 years.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3562:25, \n3567:18-22; US Ex. 751.  Dr. Mikkelsen’s particular expertise is the treatment of individuals \nwith intellectual disabilities who have co-occurring psychiatric illnesses requiring \npharmacological treatment.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3564:23-3565:2, 3572:15-18. \n497.  Currently, Dr. Mikkelsen provides consultation services to the regional centers for the \nMassachusetts Department of Developmental Services that provide institutional care to \nindividuals with developmental disabilities.  These consultations involve specialized \npsychopharmacological questions for individuals with involved psychiatric problems or \nassessments of dangerousness and forensic assessments.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3563:1-10; US Ex. 751.  \nDr. Mikkelsen also consults for the MENTOR network, a national provider of community \nresidential services for persons with developmental disabilities.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3563:10-16; US \nEx. 751.  Dr. Mikkelsen also offers second opinion consults on difficult psychiatric cases from \nvarious states.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3565:13-17.   \n170 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 176 of 318\n \n498.  After medical school, inter alia, Dr. Mikkelson trained for two years in child psychiatry, \nwhich included a focus on individuals with autism spectrum disorders and pervasive \ndevelopmental disorders.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3565:19-3566:11; US Ex. 751.   \n499.  Dr. Mikkelsen is board certified in adult psychiatry and child psychiatry.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3566:13-15; US Ex. 751.  Since 1980, Dr. Mikkelsen has served as an examiner in either the \nadult or child psychiatry board exams.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3569:4-3570:8. \n500.  Following the completion of Dr. Mikkelsen’s residency at the Yale Child Study Center, \nhe founded an inpatient child psychiatry unit in a hospital in southern New Hampshire, served as \nthe head of Child Psychiatry at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, and helped initiate a \npostgraduate training program for the Harvard Medical School in treating psychiatric illnesses in \npersons with intellectual and other developmental disabilities.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3567:23-3569:3.   \nDr. Mikkelsen has lectured both nationally and internationally, and has written over 100 \nprofessional publications and three books.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3572:8-13; US Ex. 751.  He is a \nmember of the National Association for the Dually Diagnosed, the American College of \nPsychiatrists, and a distinguished fellow in the American Psychiatric Association (“APA”).  He \nwon the APA’s Frank Menolascino Award for making significant contributions to the field of \npsychiatric care of individuals with developmental disabilities.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3570:9-21, \n3571:12-24; US Ex. 751.     \n501.  Dr. Mikkelsen applied the generally accepted professional clinical standards he was \ntaught at the Mayo Clinic, NIMH, Yale, and Harvard; the standards he has taught others; and the \nstandards he has used clinically and that have been subject to outside peer review and evidence-\nbased verification.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3574:22-3575:5.  Dr. Mikkelsen published a book in 2007, \n171 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 177 of 318\n \nThe Rational Use of Psychotropic Medication in Individuals with Developmental Disabilities, \nthat was peer-reviewed and outlines these generally accepted principles of psychiatric treatment.  \nMikkelsen Tr. 3575:8-3577:1. \n502.  In conducting his review of CHDC, Dr. Mikkelsen conducted two week-long tours of the \nfacility approximately four weeks apart in summer 2009.  During these tours, he interviewed, \namong others, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist, Dr. Callahan; CHDC’s medical director; \nCHDC’s director of psychology; a CHDC psychology staff member; and CHDC’s on-call \nphysician, Dr. Garry Stewart.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3577:11-22.  He also reviewed records, on-site and \noff-site, and visited facility living units.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3577:22-3578:3. \n503.  The starting point for Dr. Mikkelsen’s selection for his review of individuals’ records was \na spreadsheet provided by the Defendants identifying:  CHDC residents by name in alphabetical \norder, whether the medications they were receiving are prescribed for behavioral purposes, their \npsychiatric diagnosis, and the individual’s team.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3580:4-3581:9; US Ex. 754-2.  \nDr. Mikkelsen identified and reviewed the records both of individuals who were low-utilizers of \npsychotropic medication and individuals who were receiving more psychotropic medications.  \nDr. Mikkelsen also looked at charts of individuals who had multiple psychiatric diagnoses and \nthose who had psychiatric diagnoses that were unfamiliar to him or did not seem to fit other \naspects of the individual’s presentation.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3581:7-21.  This is a common approach \nto conducting reviews of psychiatric services in a facility such as CHDC.   Mikkelsen Tr. \n3583:9-15.  Dr. Mikkelsen also reviewed records of individuals who died.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3583:5-8.  Dr. Mikkelsen reviewed approximately 75 charts in reaching his conclusions.  \n172 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 178 of 318\n \nMikkelsen Tr. 3596:17-22.  This is approximately 20 percent of the caseload of persons \nreceiving psychiatric care at CHDC.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3597:12-15. \nB.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Psychiatric Care Results in Harm to CHDC Residents from \nNeedless Exposure to Harmful Side Effects of Psychotropic Medications. \n504.  Nearly 300 of CHDC’s approximately 500 residents receive psychotropic medications, \nand approximately half of those receiving psychotropic medications receive multiple \npsychotropic medications.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3584:16-19.   \n505.  CHDC residents have died and nearly died because of CHDC’s systematic failure to \navoid, detect, and mitigate common side effects of psychotropic medications.  CHDC’s failure to \nmaintain an adequate system for detecting, monitoring, reporting, responding to, and \ndocumenting medication side effects, substantially departs from generally accepted minimum \npractices.  Holloway Tr. 2621:19-23; see FOF ## 506-534. \n506.  Psychotropic medications can have serious and extensive harmful side effects, including \ndeath, diabetes mellitus, heart abnormalities, and permanent neurological damage.  Holloway Tr. \n2495:20-2498:3.  Psychotropic medications are “notorious” for their side effects.  Holloway Tr. \n2537:17-2538:3.  Defendants’ consultant Dr. Kastner acknowledged that “all psychotropic \nmedications are harmful.”  Kastner Tr. 4543:11-16.  Further, psychotropic medications pose \nsignificantly heightened risks for individuals with developmental disabilities.  Dr. Eldon Schulz, \nmedical director for the Arkansas Division of Developmental Disabilities, testified that, while the \ntypical child with ADHD may have intolerable side effects in about a range of 3 to 5 percent, an \nindividual with an intellectual status below an IQ of 70 will experience a rate of side effects that \ngoes up to 30 percent, a 10-fold increase.  Schulz Tr. 6191:20-6192:3. \n173 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 179 of 318\n \n507.  CHDC staff fail to identify even the most prevalent side effects from medications.  The \ninability of CHDC’s staff to assess such side effects is an obvious deficiency in care.  Mikkelsen \nTr. 3679:5-9. \n508.  CHDC’s failure to detect side effects or toxic levels of medications has harmed CHDC \nresidents.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3659:5-8.  In particular, CHDC residents, such as CJ, have died, and \nothers, such as CHL, have nearly died, because of CHDC’s failure to properly monitor and \nrespond to psychotropic medication side effects.  Numerous other CHDC residents are \nexperiencing significant side effects of these medications that CHDC either fails to detect or \nmisdiagnoses and improperly addresses.  See FOF ## 509-512, 524-527. \n509.  For example, CHDC gave Resident CJ the psychotropic medication Haldol for the \nexpress purpose of suppressing agitation she was experiencing as a result of a seizure \nmedication, Keppra.  No evidence showed that, before administering the Haldol to CJ, CHDC \nmade any effort to change or reduce her seizure medications, even though numerous medications \ncan effectively control seizures without causing agitation.  Further, CJ did not even have a \ndefinitive diagnosis of seizures.  As a result of CHDC’s prescription of Haldol to CJ, she \ncontracted a preventable disorder, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which CHDC did not detect, \nand caused CJ to die.  Appx. at 2-5.   \n510.  CHL, a small boy, developed lithium toxicity from medications that CHDC administered \nto him.  His level of lithium toxicity was so high at one point that laboratory equipment could not \nmeasure it.  CHDC did not detect CHL’s lithium toxicity until he was staggering and nearly \ncomatose, although he was showing signs of toxicity weeks earlier.  Even when CHL was \nstaggering and nearly comatose, and CHL’s lithium level was immeasurably high, CHDC waited \n174 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 180 of 318\n \na day to hospitalize him.  CHL ultimately had to be airlifted to Arkansas Children’s Hospital and \nsubjected to multiple rounds of dialysis to treat the toxic levels of lithium in his body.  Appx. at \n5-8.  Even Defendants’ consultant, Dr. Kraus, testified that he would have immediately \nhospitalized CHL upon receipt of the high lithium reading and that he had unanswered questions \nabout CHL’s care.  Kraus Tr. 6386:15-18. \n511.  CHDC has not undertaken any measures to prevent similar episodes of medication \noverdoses since CHL was hospitalized for lithium toxicity.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3681:14-17. \n512.  Nor does CHL represent an isolated incident.  Since CHL had to be hospitalized for \nlithium toxicity, another CHDC resident, BH, was hospitalized with lithium toxicity.  Mikkelsen \nTr. 3681:18-3682:15.  According to CHDC records, five CHDC residents have been diagnosed \nwith lithium toxicity.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3688:21-3689:13; US Ex. 587. \n513.  Having individuals reach this level of lithium toxicity is extremely rare.  Defendants’ \nconsultant, Dr. Kraus, admitted that he could not recall any individual whom he had treated in \nhis practice at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago who required hospitalization because \nof lithium toxicity.  Kraus Tr. 6341:22-6342:1.   \n514.  Similarly, Dr. Kraus, admitted he was unaware of any instance in the past two years \namong his fellow practitioners in Chicago, all of whom commonly prescribe lithium, of an \nindividual requiring hospitalization from lithium toxicity.  Kraus Tr. 6342:2-15.  Dr. Kraus \ntestified that he is commonly notified of adverse drug reactions like lithium toxicity occurring in \nthe Chicago area and likely would have been notified if a hospitalization from lithium toxicity \noccurred there.  Kraus Tr. 6342:9-12.   \n175 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 181 of 318\n \n515.  Because of CHDC’s substandard medication practices, numerous other CHDC residents \nare experiencing significant side effects of psychotropic medications.  Holloway Tr. 2601:14-17.  \nFor example, records for ACJ indicate that she is experiencing behaviors consistent with \nmedication side effects.  Dr. Holloway summarized these as “[a]ppearing overly sleepy, \nunresponsive, lethargic, confused and disoriented, appearing unusually unsteady and shaky, \npossible accident, minor injury, falling,” and “swelling on her face, inability to void.”  Holloway \nTr. 2602:3-13; US Ex. 877-2.   \n516.  Psychotropic medications cause abnormal motor movements.  Holloway Tr. 2497:25-\n2498:1.  Consequently, generally accepted minimum professional standards require CHDC to \nmonitor side effects with objective measures normed to its population.  Holloway Tr. 2498:3-8.  \nThese include monitoring for akathesia, which is motor restlessness that psychotropic agents can \ncontribute to, and causes significant distress.  Holloway Tr. 2498:16-24. \n517.  CHDC is not adequately identifying individuals with tardive dyskinesia.  Holloway Tr. \n2607:17-20.  Tardive dyskinesia is a psychotropic medication side effect involving abnormal \nmotor movements.  Tardive dyskinesia can cause swallowing difficulties, and can affect the \nlimbs and feet.  Holloway Tr. 2602:25-2603:4.  Variants of tardive dyskinesia include akathesia \nand tardive dystonia, which is a tightening and twisting of muscle groups.  Holloway Tr. 2603:4-\n8.  Tardive dyskinesia, including these and other subtypes, is usually an irreversible condition.  \nHolloway Tr. 2603:12-13. \n518.  Certain classes of psychotropic medication typically cause tardive dyskinesia.   Holloway \nTr. 2603:16-21.  Studies indicate that approximately 17 to 25 percent of persons exposed to long-\nterm use of psychotropic medications develop tardive dyskinesia.  Holloway Tr. 2603:22-2604:5. \n176 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 182 of 318\n \n519.  CHDC has exposed multiple CHDC residents to numerous years of psychotropic \nmedications, especially to first-generation antipsychotics.  Holloway Tr. 2604:6-20.   \n520.  Reglan, which is used to treat gastrointestinal disturbance, can contribute to tardive \ndyskinesia.  Holloway Tr. 2605:2-5.  CHDC prescribes Reglan to approximately 51 CHDC \nresidents.  Holloway Tr. 2605:7-10. \n521.  Extrapyramidal symptoms (i.e., long-term abnormal motor movements, Holloway Tr. \n2593:4-13) are associated with a disorder of the central nervous system and manifest themselves \nin different ways, including abnormal oral movements, jaw movements, upper extremity \nmovements, drooling, gait change, and finger movements resembling pill rolling.  Holloway Tr. \n2605:22-2606:14. \n522.  CHDC limits its medication side effect monitoring to the use of the Abnormal \nInvoluntary Movement Scale (“AIMS”).  Holloway Tr. 2595:13-15, 2600:12-14; Mikkelsen Tr. \n3657:8-20.  The AIMS only identifies dyskinesia (i.e., medication-induced involuntary motor \nmovement).  Holloway Tr. 2601:2, 2497:24-2498:3.  The AIMS does not capture other serious \nside effects, such as akathisia or tremors.  Holloway Tr. 2595:16-19, 2601:2-4; Mikkelsen Tr. \n3657:23-3658:7.  Other instruments, such as the MOSES, provide a more comprehensive \nassessment of side effects.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3658:13-19.  The AIMS, by itself, is not adequate to \nassess the side effects of psychotropic medications.  Holloway Tr. 2600:21-24.   \n523.  CHDC has identified only eight residents as having either tardive dyskinesia or \nextrapyramidal symptoms.  Holloway Tr. 2605:11-2606:17; US Ex. 874.  This list undercounts \nthe number of CHDC residents with a history of tardive dyskinesia or extrapyramidal symptoms.  \nEight residents is low compared to national statistics regarding rates of tardive dyskinesia or \n177 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 183 of 318\n \nother extrapyramidal symptoms among individuals who have experienced long-term exposure to \npsychotropic medications.  National statistics indicate that at least 25 percent of such individuals \nexperience such symptoms.  Holloway Tr. 2606:18-2607:7.  Further, CHDC residents \nmanifesting signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms were not \nincluded on CHDC’s list of individuals experiencing tardive dyskinesia or extrapyramidal \nsymptoms.  Holloway Tr. 2607:7-16. \n524.  Even when CHDC staff do identify potential medication side effects, they fail to follow-\nup.   For instance, CHDC resident BH’s psychiatric consultation in May 2009 notes that, \naccording to an AIMS screen, BH has experienced “some involuntary movements with regard to \nboth arms and facial muscles and lip/perioral area.  He engages in fairly frequent stereotypical \nmovements of his arms.”  Holloway Tr. 2607:21-2608:24.  These movements are consistent with \nextrapyramidal symptoms.   Holloway Tr. 2609:10-13.  Yet, CHDC has not identified BH as \nhaving extrapyramidal symptoms.  US Ex. 874.  After noting that BH is exhibiting possible \nextrapyramidal symptoms, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist did not advise BH’s treatment team \nto monitor for these movements.  Holloway Tr. 2609:17-24.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist \nalso did not explore whether BH’s agitation and aggression result from akathesia, which is an \nextrapyramidal symptom.  Holloway Tr. 2609:19-23, 2613:24-2614:3.      \n525.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist regularly raises medication dosages even while noting \nthe presence of associated side effects.  Holloway Tr. 2587:12-19.  For instance, although \nCHDC’s consulting psychiatrist noted in May 2009 that BH was experiencing symptoms that are \nconsistent with extrapyramidal symptoms, in July 2009, the psychiatrist concluded that BH was \nhaving “no known side effects” from his medications.  Holloway Tr. 2607:21-2608:24, 2612:14-\n178 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 184 of 318\n \n16; US Ex. 880-2.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist made no apparent effort to account for the \nfact that psychotropic medications prescribed for BH have irreversible side effects and can also \nsuppress symptoms of any side effects.  Holloway Tr. 2612:17-2613:10.  Instead, he raised the \nlevel of BH’s medication.  Holloway Tr. 2613:11-16. \n526.    CHDC increased BH’s psychotropic medications in response to the frequency of BH’s \nbehavior reports.  Holloway Tr. 2613:17-20.  This is especially concerning, because BH has a \nhistory of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome can cause death, \nand is caused by the neuroleptic medication that CHDC was administering to BH.  Holloway Tr. \n2613:17-20.  CHDC increased BH’s psychotropic medications without regard to the potential \nside effects in contrast to generally accepted professional standards.  Holloway Tr. 2613:21-23. \n527.  The consulting psychiatrist’s consultation notes of July 2, 2009 for CHDC resident AMB \nindicate that AMB had “small areas on her forehead, chin, and right side of her face, that she’s \nprobably engaged in some skin-picking behavior.  She had some infrequent tic-type movements \nof her eyebrows.”  Yet, again, the consulting psychiatrist did not carefully assess the possibility \nof medication side effects.  Instead, the consulting psychiatrist’s note uses largely the same \ngeneric language found in other resident examples  -  AMB is “having no known current side \neffects from her psychotropic medication, with the possible exception of some intermittently \npresent abnormal facial movements noted on her AIMS from 2/14/09.”  Holloway Tr. 2616:3-19; \nUS Ex. 882.  Although CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist documented the results from CHDC's \nAIMS screening in his own notes, CHDC failed to identify AMB as having tardive dyskinesia or \nextrapyramidal symptoms.  Holloway Tr. 2616:24-2617:3; US Ex. 874.   CHDC’s March 10, \n2009 problem list for AMB identifies several medical issues consistent with medication side \n179 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 185 of 318\n \neffects, such as duodenal ulcers, constipation, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, esophagitis, \ngastritis, silent aspiration, and cataracts.  Holloway Tr. 2617:4-25; US Ex. 883.  Yet, AMB’s \nrecord contains no indications that CHDC staff assessed any of these conditions as possible \nmedication side effects.  Holloway Tr. 2618:1-15. \n528.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist admitted that he typically does not even identify the side \neffects of the treatments he proposes.  Callahan Tr. 5371:22-5372:12.  Even in the rare instances \nwhere CHDC’s psychiatrist does identify possible side effects, he does not communicate them \nadequately to other treating staff, denying them of information they need to monitor and address \nthe side effects.  A psychiatrist must educate staff about what particular side effects to look for, \nmonitor residents whom he is treating, and instruct staff on how to address such side effects.  \nHolloway Tr. 2523:23-2524:24.  But at CHDC, the consulting psychiatrist does not take these \nsteps necessary to ensure residents’ safety.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3625:7-9.   \n529.  Similarly, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist does not complete Adverse Drug Reaction \nreports or otherwise notify the CHDC Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee or other entities of \npotential adverse drug reactions or medication side effects experienced by the residents for \nwhom he provides psychiatric services.  Holloway Tr. 2523:14-22, 2587:20-2588:5. \n530.  The consulting psychiatrist is not a member of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics \nCommittee or on any committee in regards to monitoring medications, or in any way involved in \nmedication monitoring.  Holloway Tr. 2590:19-2591:11.  The consulting psychiatrist is not \naware of the content of CHDC’s medication monitoring protocols or even where the protocols \nare located.  Holloway Tr. 2591:12-22; Mikkelsen Tr. 3649:21-3650:2. \n180 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 186 of 318\n \n531.  CHDC does not have a facility-wide system of detecting, reporting, and responding to \nharmful medication side effects.  Holloway Tr. 2592:4-13, 2595:9-12, 2600:15-17; Mikkelsen \nTr. 3658:20-25.  CHDC does not have a systemic approach for tracking and trending harmful \noutcomes that result from medication side effects.  Holloway Tr. 2600:18-20.    \n532.  CHDC’s medical director knows little about CHDC’s medication side effect control \nsystem.  She admitted that she:  (1) has no personal knowledge of training provided to staff on \nmedication side effects apart from what staff are told in interdisciplinary team meetings; (2) does \nnot know how many CHDC residents have been identified as having side effects of psychotropic \nmedications; (3) does not know whether CHDC maintains a list of CHDC residents who have \nbeen identified as having side effects of psychotropic medications for referral by CHDC staff; \nand (4) she did not know how or whether CHDC identified trends and side effects experienced \nby CHDC residents.  Thomas Tr. 1737:19-1738:6, 1735:14-19, 1739:2-8, 1743:13-25.    \n533.  CHDC does not adequately train direct care staff to recognize psychiatric side effects.  \nMikkelsen Tr. 3655:2-8.  Staff did not begin receiving detailed training on medication side \neffects until April 2010.  Murphy Tr. 509:10-510:9, 511:22-512:10.  CHDC uses lists of potential \nside effects, but these lists are generic pro forma printouts that are not tailored to the individual \nreceiving the particular medication.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3625:23-3626:7.  As such, they are clinically \ndeficient.  They do not identify pertinent side effects that can be indications of life-threatening \nconditions, including extrapyramidal muscular movements, orthostatic hypertension, \ntachycardia, and temperature changes.  Holloway Tr. 2592:14:-2594:18; US Ex. 898 at CON-\nUS-0127243.  They do not identify the likelihood of one particular side effect versus another.  \n181 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 187 of 318\n \nMikkelsen Tr. 3626:8-12.  They have little utility in informing treatment team members about \nwhat to watch for.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3626:13-16.  \n534.  Defendants’ consultant, Dr. Kraus, agreed that the side effect sheets distributed at \ninterdisciplinary meetings are generic printouts from CHDC’s pharmacy that do not educate staff \nas to which side effects are of particular concern.  Kraus Tr. 6334:9-6335:6.  Dr. Kraus also \nconfirmed that CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist does not actually attend interdisciplinary team \nmeetings.  Kraus Tr. 6335:7-12. \nC.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Psychiatric Care Results in Harm to CHDC Residents from \nClinically Deficient Diagnoses That Are Used To Justify the Administration \nof Psychotropic Medications. \n535.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist uses clinically unsupported diagnoses to justify the \nunwarranted use of psychotropic medications that needlessly expose CHDC residents to harmful \nside effects and often worsen the very behaviors the medications are used to suppress.    In \nparticular, CHDC:  (1) does not eliminate potential non-psychiatric causes of challenging \nbehaviors before assigning psychiatric diagnoses to its residents; (2) improperly relies on broad \ncategories of behavior, such as aggression, to justify psychiatric diagnoses; and (3) saddles its \nresidents with unsubstantiated, clinically unjustified, and even clinically illegitimate psychiatric \ndiagnoses.   See FOF ## 536-554.  \n536.  All relevant witnesses agreed that, prior to prescribing psychotropic medications, \ngenerally accepted practice requires CHDC first to exclude non-psychiatric causes of the \nindividual’s symptoms, such as general medical problems, learned behaviors, and environmental \nconditions.  See Mikkelsen Tr. 3586:12-16; Kraus Tr. 6234:22-6235:1 (Defendants’ consultant); \n182 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 188 of 318\n \nSchulz Tr. 6190:14-6191:15 (medical director for the Arkansas Division of Developmental \nDisabilities).     \n537.  Regardless of the level of an individual’s disability, it is clinically unacceptable to use \npsychotropic medications in response to an individual’s behaviors without having ruled out \nenvironmental or situational causes, and absent indicia of an underlying psychiatric disorder.  \nMikkelsen Tr. 3599:15-3606:9. \n538.  A major reason for this rule-out approach is that large numbers of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities have medical or other problems that precipitate behavioral \npresentations that can be misdiagnosed as psychiatric disorders.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3586:17-22.  As \nDefendants’ consultant Dr. Kastner testified, “I think Dr. Mikkelsen and I would agree that in \ngeneral you don’t want to use psychotropic medication to treat specifically behavioral symptoms.  \nIt happens a lot.  It's not something that I would encourage.”  Kastner Tr. 4141:7-11 \n539.  Once non-psychiatric factors are ruled out, the psychiatrist should begin to form a \nhypothesis about a psychiatric disorder.  In doing so, the psychiatrist should determine whether \nspecific symptoms can explain the disorder.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3587:4-9.   To reach such a \ndiagnosis, a psychiatrist should identify specific indicia of psychiatric distress.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3593:10-17.  This requires informing direct care staff of what specific symptoms to track and \nreport.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3593:18-22. \n540.  Yet, Dr. Callahan, the CHDC consultant psychiatrist who sees virtually every CHDC \nresident receiving psychiatric treatment, Callahan Tr. 5333:14-23, admitted that he plays no role \nin accounting for non-psychiatric factors before diagnosing individuals with a psychiatric \ndisorder.  See Mikkelsen Tr. 3596:12-17.  Dr. Mikkelsen’s review of almost 80 charts confirmed \n183 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 189 of 318\n \nthat Dr. Callahan failed to account for non-psychiatric factors.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3596:17-3597:11.  \nMoreover, CHDC’s consultant psychiatrist admitted that he does not even determine the \nsymptoms of an individual’s purported psychiatric illness.  Callahan Tr. 5365:13-15.  Rather, he \nsimply relies on what psychology examiners tell him the symptoms are, without any input or \nguidance from him.  Holloway Tr. 2529:22-2530:25, 2531:1-13; Mikkelsen Tr. 3596:7-16, \n3598:4-8. \n541.  Further, the information provided by CHDC psychology examiners typically consists of \nunhelpful raw behavioral data that has not been filtered by any diagnostic criteria.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3598:4-14.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist admitted that typically the information he reviews \nregarding an individual’s status consists only of broad categories of maladaptive behaviors \nreflected in rates of aggression and frequency of time in restraints.  Callahan Tr. 5366:12-5368:8; \nUS Ex. 824 at CON-US-0126032.  Yet, even the “Experts’ Consensus Guidelines” that the \nDefendants invoke as a standard require the delineation of “specific index behaviors.”  Kraus Tr. \n6317:7-6318:10.  Data on the frequency of self-injurious behavior, aggression, or restraint use, is \nitself an insufficient basis for reaching a clinically adequate psychiatric diagnosis.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3592:5-9.  Such data is too broad and must be refined in order to be linked to, and justify, a \nparticular diagnosis.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3592:10-3594:8.  CHDC’s information deficiency makes it \n“virtually impossible” for a psychiatrist to reach a professional psychiatric diagnosis.  Mikkelsen \nTr. 3597:16-3598:3, 3598:9-14.   \n542.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist admitted that aggression, by itself, is a nonspecific \nbehavior.  Callahan Tr. 5368:10-12.   Similarly, Defendants’ consultant Dr. Kraus testified that \naggression can have many causes.  Kraus Tr. 6317:4-6.  Without a direct link to symptoms \n184 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 190 of 318\n \ncharacteristic of a psychiatric disorder, aggression is too nonspecific a behavior for CHDC to use \nfor assessments and treatment.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3587:4-3588:4.    \n543.  To make a professional psychiatric diagnosis and assess the efficacy of treatment, the \npsychiatrist must also instruct the individual’s interdisciplinary team as to what data to report \nback to the psychiatrist regarding the individual and his or her symptoms.   Holloway Tr. \n2490:23-2491:14, 2520:23-2521:17, 2523:4-8; Mikkelsen Tr. 3596:1-11.  Conversely at CHDC, \nthe consulting psychiatrist admitted, and individuals’ charts confirmed, that he simply defers to \nthe unqualified psychology examiners as to what information should be tracked.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3596:7-3597:2; see FOF # 540.  \n544.  Moreover, contrary to generally accepted professional standards, CHDC’s consulting \npsychiatrist does not memorialize an explanation as to how identified maladaptive behaviors are \nmanifestations of the psychiatric diagnosis assigned to an individual.  He explained that he keeps \nthat information in his head.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3608:17-23.  This is a clinically deficient practice \nthat does not comport with generally accepted practice.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3608:24-3609:2.  This “in \nhis head” explanation also exacerbates CHDC’s problem with internally inconsistent medical \ncharts documenting residents’ psychiatric diagnoses.  Holloway Tr. 2535:9-21.   \n545.  In addition, psychiatric diagnoses at CHDC contradict other aspects of the individual’s \npresentation.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3609:3-3610:4.  This is evident in the records of CHDC’s residents.   \nExamples include CHDC diagnosing persons with profound or severe intellectual disabilities as \nalso having attention deficit disorder despite the fact that their level of attention is essentially not \nmeasurable.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3738:15-18.  Other examples include diagnoses of personality \nchange associated with congenital conditions occurring while an infant is still in utero, such as \n185 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 191 of 318\n \npersonality change due to cerebral palsy.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3609:13-22, 3610:22-3611:3, 3612:2-\n10.  Similarly, CHDC diagnosed ACJ with “organic mood disorder,” an unrecognized and \nnonexistent diagnosis in the field of psychiatry.  Holloway Tr. 2582:11-18.   \n546.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist’s diagnoses are also inappropriate because he makes \ndiagnoses for reasons based on illegitimate, non-diagnostic criteria.  In particular, CHDC’s \nconsulting psychiatrist admitted that he essentially gives a psychiatric diagnosis to most \nindividuals referred to him at CHDC, even though he admitted that “the primary care physician \nmight well write a referral [to him] just based on” an individual being “aggressive or self-\ninjurious” when the individual is medically assessed upon admission.”  Callahan Tr. 5370:12-\n5371:10.   \n547.  Even Defendants’ consultant Dr. Kraus recognized the consulting psychiatrist’s \nconflicting and clinically unsound diagnoses and raised concerns about the substandard practice \nwith Dr. Callahan.  Dr. Kraus testified, “I spoke with Dr. Callahan about a number of the \ndescriptions of personality change with some type of organic etiology like fetal -- personality \nchange related to fetal alcohol syndrome or personality change related to microcephaly, for \nexample.”  Kraus Tr. 6257:24-6258:3.  “It’s not -- this is not -- I did talk to him.  This is not a \nDSM-IV description.  You don’t have personality change from fetal alcohol syndrome.”  Kraus \nTr. 6258:24-6259:1. \n548.  CHDC also makes unjustified diagnoses that fail to account for behaviors that are \ncommon in individuals with developmental disabilities or in individuals with autism.  For \ninstance, persons with severe and possibly profound intellectual disabilities may engage in \nobsessive behaviors simply as a coping mechanism.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3613:6-9.  Also, persons with \n186 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 192 of 318\n \nautism disorder have inherent obsessive symptoms.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3612:19-23.  Further, \nDefendants’ witness, Dr. Parmley, testified that a diagnosis of autism precludes some other \ndiagnoses, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and possibly obsessive compulsive \ndisorder (“OCD”).  Parmley Tr. 5473:18-25.  Accordingly, in diagnosing OCD for an individual \nwith developmental disabilities, a clinician must determine that obsessive behaviors are distinct \nfrom autism-related behaviors or other behaviors attributable to an individual’s developmental \ndisability.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3612:23-3613:1.   \n549.  Yet, as further evidence of these unjustifiable diagnoses, 27 percent of CHDC residents \nwith a psychiatric diagnosis were also diagnosed as having OCD.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3612:14-16.  \nThis 27 percent is high compared to the general landscape of persons with developmental \ndisabilities who have a psychiatric disorder.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3614:14-20.  This rate is also \npresumptively invalid, given the psychiatric assessments required to make it, Mikkelsen Tr. \n3612:17-3613:1, and especially given that CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist admits that he does \nnot rule out non-psychiatric causes before rendering a diagnoses.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3596:7-17.   \n550.  Diagnoses matter because they determine treatments used.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3588:16-\n3589:6, 3610:10-13, 3615:19-3616:1; Holloway Tr. 2535:24-2536:7.  CHDC’s deficient \npsychiatric diagnoses cause harmful treatment implications for CHDC residents.  For instance, \nalthough CHDC diagnoses many residents with both bipolar and anxiety disorders, common \ntreatments for anxiety disorder will often disrupt a person with bipolar disorder.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3611:5-3612:1.   \n551.  A recognized treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder is the use of a class of \nmedications called “SSRIs.”  These medications can cause a paradoxical reaction of \n187 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 193 of 318\n \ndisinhibition, or excitement, if someone actually has autism, and have the potential to destabilize \nthe individual.   Mikkelsen Tr. 3613:24-3614:13.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist acknowledged \nthat, in general, SSRIs have been less effective in treating persons whom he has diagnosed with \nOCD.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3614:24-3615:5.  This implies that CHDC wrongly diagnosed these \nresidents with OCD.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3615:6-8.   The high rate of persons diagnosed with OCD \nand the lack of efficacy at CHDC of the standard treatment for this disorder are further evidence \nof CHDC’s deficiencies in diagnosing psychiatric disorders.   \n552.  TN’s case illustrates these CHDC deficiencies.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist first \ndiagnosed TN with attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity type, notwithstanding that TN was \nalso diagnosed as having a profound intellectual disability.  Persons having profound intellectual \ndisabilities have impaired attention, making such an attention deficit disorder diagnosis difficult \nto establish.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3738:11-18.  Further, administering antidepressants to someone who \nhas a bipolar disorder risks precipitating a manic episode.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3740:3-6.  Yet, \nCHDC’s consulting psychiatrist subjected TN to two trials of antidepressants.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3739:6-3740:2.  Both trials triggered manic episodes in TN.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3739:6-3740:2.  \nCHDC’s consulting psychiatrist subjected TN to the second trial of antidepressants even after the \nfirst trial made TN manic and after he diagnosed TN with bipolar disorder, a condition well \nknown to trigger a manic reaction to antidepressants.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3739:8-3740:2; Appx. at 9-\n10.     \n553.  Similarly, regarding an adolescent male, TM, the CHDC psychiatric consultant noted \nwhen first seeing TM that “all the aggression seemed to be a response to something going on \naround him as opposed to a strictly internal process.”  US Ex. 875 at CON-US-0274721-723; \n188 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 194 of 318\n \nHolloway Tr. 2549:1-7.  Thereafter, the consulting psychiatrist assigned TM the psychiatric \ndiagnoses of both psychosis and generalized anxiety disorder.  Holloway Tr. 2550:3-2551:2; US \nEx. 875 at CON-US-0274719.  Yet, simultaneously assigning these diagnoses is clinically \nunjustifiable.  The standard psychiatric diagnostics tool, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (“DSM-IV-TR”) instructs that these diagnoses \nare incompatible and cannot be appropriately assigned simultaneously to the same person.  \nHolloway Tr. 2550:14-23.  Additionally, the treatments for psychosis and generalized anxiety \ndisorder are incompatible.  Holloway Tr. 2551:3-5.  Separately, the consulting psychiatrist did \nnot provide any guidance to TM’s treatment team regarding what to track in order to establish or \nrule out his diagnosis.  Holloway Tr. 2551:15-2553:9.   \n554.  TM also illustrates clinically deficient diagnoses that were noted by Defendants’ \nconsultant Dr. Kraus.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist unjustifiably diagnosed TM with \npersonality change due to microcephaly.  Holloway Tr. 2693:15-2694:5, US Ex. 875.  \nMicrocephaly is typically a congenital condition resulting in a small brain at birth.  Absent \nestablishing that TM was experiencing ongoing shrinkage of the brain, which was not established \nfor TM, microcephaly could not ever justify a clinical diagnosis of personality change.  \nHolloway Tr.  2721:9-2722:9; Kraus Tr. 6257:24-6258:3, 6258:24-6259:1.  \nD.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Psychiatric Care Results in Harm to CHDC Residents from \nHarmful Medication Practices. \n555.  CHDC administers medications to its residents that are not justified by their diagnoses.  \nFurther, as with other deficiencies in psychiatric care, CHDC allows non-clinicians to control \ndecisions regarding medication usage.   CHDC engages in this practice in part so that it can \n189 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 195 of 318\n \nadminister psychotropic medications to its residents to suppress behaviors and for other clinically \nunjustified reasons.  See FOF ## 556-581.  \n1)  CHDC’s Clinically Unjustified Selection of Medication \n556.  Once a psychiatric diagnosis is reached, the psychiatrist should select from among those \ntreatments that are evidence-based, meaning treatments that have been clinically substantiated \nthrough research studies and published literature to have demonstrated efficacy and fit for \nparticular psychiatric diagnoses.  In making this selection, the psychiatrist should weigh the \npotential side effects and likely efficacy of the treatment against the harms associated with the \ndiagnosed condition.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3588:16-3589:6, 3615:19-3616:1.  \n557.  The CHDC consulting psychiatrist’s notes should clearly articulate the risks and benefits \nof the chosen treatment, the hypothesis of why he is selecting particular medications, and what \nsymptoms he is targeting.  Holloway Tr. 2525:11-23.  His notes need to show that his treatment \ndecisions are based on clinical information, and he should amalgamate all this relevant \ninformation so that clinicians involved in the individual’s care can readily determine why the \npsychiatrist is using the medication.  Holloway Tr. 2525:11-23, 2568:2-13, 2568:25-2569:9.  \n558.  In comparison, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist admitted that he does not set out the risks \nand benefits of medications in his note.  Further, he does not educate the team about the risks and \nbenefits of medications, nor does he participate in team discussions of risks and benefits of \nmedications.  Callahan Tr. 5371:13-5373:12.  Finally, he does not amalgamate all relevant \ninformation so that clinicians involved in the individual’s care can access it.   Holloway Tr. \n2535:9-21 (noting internally inconsistent documentation of residents’ psychiatric diagnoses).   \n190 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 196 of 318\n \n559.  Further, CHDC does not assess in any confirmable way whether the side effects of those \nmedications outweigh the risks associated with the diagnosed psychiatric condition.  Even worse, \nin response to guardians’ wishes, CHDC engages in a pattern of administering medications to its \nresidents that its consulting psychiatrist believes are unwarranted and possibly harmful.  \nMikkelsen Tr. 3616:21-3618:20.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist has acknowledged engaging in \nthis practice in his psychiatric notes.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3619:22-3620:6. \n560.  Repeated examples confirm that CHDC does not select medications based on any finding \nthat the medications have been clinically shown to fit a resident’s particular diagnosis and that \nthey have a demonstrated efficacy for that diagnosis.  CHDC engages in a pattern of prescribing \nmedications to its residents that are not aligned with the psychiatric diagnoses assigned to those \nresidents.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3616:8-20.  \n561.  These practices constitute an illegitimate use of psychotropic medication, and \nsubstantially depart from generally accepted minimum professional standards.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3616:2-3617:7, 3618:15-20.      \n562.  As Dr. Mikkelsen testified, there are “fundamental problems” in that CHDC’s consulting \npsychiatrist believes that non-clinicians control medications and dosages to such a degree that \nthe psychiatrist sees himself as having to make unethical treatment decisions regarding CHDC \nresidents.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3769:9-16.     \n563.  CHDC’s treatment of SS illustrates this deficiency of prescribing medications determined \nto be unhelpful or even harmful.  Throughout most of the 1990s, SS had experienced great \nstability on the medication Mellaril.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3758:25-3759:2.  CHDC’s consulting \npsychiatrist switched SS from Mellaril to Zyprexa because of SS’s guardian’s wishes, even \n191 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 197 of 318\n \nthough the consulting psychiatrist concluded that the Zyprexa caused SS to experience glucose \nproblems associated with diabetes mellitus and that there had not been in a major change in SS’s \noverall condition on the Mellaril.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3759:18-3760:3.  In fact, CHDC’s data indicate \nthat SS’s acts of aggression had decreased by 80 percent while she was receiving the Mellaril, as \ncompared with when she was receiving Zyprexa.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3760:12-21.  CHDC subjected \nSS to dangerous medication side effects, against the treating professional’s judgment, due to \nSS’s guardian’s wishes, even though the original medication was more effective in treating SS’s \nbehavior.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3757:2-15; US Ex. 816.   \n564.   Separately, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist has treated residents with medications that \nare known to be harmful, without any clinical justification for the risk of harm.  For example, the \nconsulting psychiatrist recommended administering an anti-anxiety medication, lorazepam (also \nknown as Ativan) to CHDC resident BH for behavior suspected to result from a change in BH’s \nassigned staff.  Holloway Tr. 2610:24-2611:5.  Independent of the inappropriate use of a \npsychotropic medication to address environmental factors, Holloway Tr. 2611:6-9, lorazepam is \nnot advised for someone with developmental disabilities unless absolutely necessary because it \naffects cognitive functioning.  Holloway Tr. 2611:12-19.  In addition, lorazepam is highly \naddictive.  Holloway Tr. 2612:1-4.  Professional standards require a risk/benefit analysis before \nCHDC used this medication with an individual with developmental disabilities.  Holloway Tr. \n2611:17-24.  BH’s record, however, shows no evidence that CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist \nundertook such risk/benefit analysis.  Holloway Tr. 2614:8-13. \n565.  In addition, Defendants’ own witnesses admit that CHDC treats children with autism \nwith psychotropic medications that have been clinically shown to be ineffective and harmful to \n192 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 198 of 318\n \nchildren.  Kraus Tr. 6296:14-6300:4.  Defendants’ consultant Dr. Kraus testified that Dr. Fred \nVolkmar is the preeminent expert on autism in the country, if not the world.  Kraus Tr. 6371:7-\n12 (“I would believe anything Dr. Volkmar had to say regarding autism and the treatment related \nto autism.”).  In an article Defendants cited at trial, Dr. Volkmar stated that a medication used at \nCHDC on children with autism, citalopram, “exhibited significant adverse effects without any \nevident therapeutic effects in children.”  Kraus Tr. 6383:2-4. \n2)  Clinically Unjustified Medication Usage  \n566.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist’s notes make clear that he improperly uses psychotropic \nmedications for reasons unrelated to a psychiatric disorder.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3620:13-16.  For \nexample, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist uses psychotropic medications to suppress the effects \nof other medications, in response to environmental factors, and as chemical restraints.  See FOF \n## 567-581.   \ni.  CHDC Improperly Uses Medications To Suppress the Effects of \nOther Medications.  \n567.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist encourages the use at CHDC of psychotropic \nmedications to suppress the side effects of another medication without first attempting to remove \nor replace the offending medication.  This practice pattern is an illegitimate use of psychotropic \nmedication, and substantially departs from generally accepted minimum standards.  Mikkelsen \nTr. 3616:21-24, 3617:7-23, 3618:15-20, 3644:22-3645:13.   \n568.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist has openly advocated the use of the psychotropic \nmedication Haldol to suppress agitation caused by another medication, Keppra, without first \n193 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 199 of 318\n \nattempting to remove or replace the offending medication.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3643:12-3644:6; US \nEx. 767; Appx. at 2-3.   \n569.  Beyond advocating this practice, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist actually has treated a \nCHDC resident with Haldol to suppress agitation suspected to be caused by Keppra, without first \nattempting to remove or replace the Keppra.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3644:8-16.  Haldol can cause a \npotentially fatal disorder called neuroleptic malignant syndrome.  As explained above, CHDC’s \nuse of Haldol on CHDC resident CJ caused CJ to contract neuroleptic malignant syndrome and \ndie.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3644:8-18; Appx. at 2-5; see FOF # 509.      \nii.  CHDC Improperly Uses Medications in Response to \nEnvironmental Factors.  \n570.  Psychotropic medications should not be used to treat environmentally driven situations.  \nHolloway Tr. 2538:2-3; see FOF ## 536-537.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist, however, \nprescribes psychiatric medications, and recommends dosage increases, for causes that he \nexpressly acknowledges are environmental.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3620:7-12; Holloway Tr. 2529:6-8.   \n571.  CHDC’s charts routinely identify environmental factors, such as a change in staff persons \nor a loud roommate, as the cause of a person’s change in behaviors.  These charts note CHDC’s \nclinically deficient response of administering psychotropic medications to treat the \nenvironmentally caused change.  Holloway Tr. 2536:17-2537:11; Mikkelsen Tr. 3768:11-15.     \n572.   As noted above, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist improperly recommended that CHDC \nadminister lorazepam, an addictive anti-anxiety medication that affects cognition, to resident BH \nbecause of BH’s environmental response to a change in staff.  See FOF # 564; Holloway Tr. \n194 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 200 of 318\n \n2610:24-2611:5.  This is another example illustrating CHDC’s inappropriate use of psychotropic \nmedication to address behaviors caused by environmental factors.  Holloway Tr. 2611:6-9. \n573.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist treats environmentally caused behavior problems with \npsychotropic medications because CHDC does not address these problems behaviorally or \nenvironmentally.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3768:16-25, 3769:5-9.   \niii.  CHDC Improperly Uses Medications for Chemical Restraint. \n574.  CHDC subjects hundreds of residents to mind-altering psychotropic medications to \nsuppress maladaptive behaviors without a psychiatrist first ruling out non-psychiatric causes of \nthe behaviors.  These non-psychiatric causes include possible physical health issues, means of \ncoping (i.e. “learned behaviors”), and environmental factors.  Most commonly, CHDC gives \npsychotropic medications to control so-called “aggressive” or “self-injurious” behaviors.   This \nwide-spread practice constitutes professionally prohibited, chemical restraint.  See FOF ## 575-\n581. \n575.  CHDC uses psychotropic medication on its residents predominately for maladaptive \nbehavior unassociated with a clinical diagnosis of mental illness.  Holloway Tr. 2534:21-2535:3, \n2533:19-25.  A psychiatrist cannot legitimately justify the selection of medication based on \naggression by itself.  Yet, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist’s notes present behavioral data in \nterms of numbers of incidents of aggression, and he improperly bases his treatment decisions on \nrates of aggression.  Holloway Tr. 2532:3-16.   \n576.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist admitted that typically the information he reviews \nregarding an individual’s status consists of only generic descriptions of maladaptive behaviors \nand negative outcomes, such as rates of aggression and frequency of time in restraints.  Callahan \n195 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 201 of 318\n \nTr. 5366:12-5368:8; US Ex. 824 at CON-US-0126032.  Having no other justification, CHDC \nregularly uses psychotropic medication solely to sedate its residents.  This constitutes the \nillegitimate use of psychotropic medications as chemical restraint.  Holloway Tr. 2534:1-18; \nMikkelsen Tr. 3616:21-24, 3617:25-3618:1, 3618:15-20.  This illegitimate chemical restraint \noccurs “daily” at CHDC.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3618:21-3619:12.  \n577.  CHDC continues to use psychotropic medications as chemical restraints even when \nDefendants’ own clinicians have identified such use as harmful.  Dr. Eldon Schulz, medical \ndirector of the Arkansas Division of Developmental Disabilities, testified that Depo-Provera has \nbeen used to curb hypersexuality in adult males.  Schulz Tr. 6187:21-22.  Dr. Schulz testified \nthat the State discontinued the use of Depo-Provera in men because the drug posed significant \nside effects, including breast cancer and testicular cancer.  Schulz Tr. 6187:12-6188:5.  \nDefendants’ consultant Dr. Kraus testified that Depo-Provera is a form of chemical castration.  \nKraus Tr. 6257:2-7.  Yet, Dr. Kraus also confirmed that CHDC continues to use Depo-Provera \non adolescent males.  Kraus Tr. 6256:24-6257:20.   \n578.  Other specific examples of CHDC’s use of unjustified chemical restraint include resident \nTC, a young boy admitted to CHDC in August 2007, at the age of 6.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3720:4-9; \nUS Ex. 803.  TC was diagnosed with autism, but no other psychiatric disorders, at admission to \nCHDC.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3720:15-20.  For the next two years, TC’s only psychiatric diagnosis \ncontinued to be autism.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3730:21-24.  Yet, in response to “possible situational” \nfactors, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist recommended increasing TC’s Thorazine dosage, which \nCHDC had been administering to TC since his admission there.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3733:10-14, \n3729:25-3730:5; US Exs. 805 & 806.  Thorazine has sedating effects, and no clinical basis exists \n196 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 202 of 318\n \nfor a psychiatrist to use Thorazine to treat autism, particularly for a child.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3730:11-3731:5.  Tellingly, the consulting psychiatrist did not offer a clinical justification for \nthis use.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3731:3-5.  Even TC’s team admitted that the cause of TC’s behavior was \nnot psychiatric.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3755:1-4, 3734:17-23.  Yet, CHDC administered psychiatric \nmedications for the non-psychiatric purpose of chemically restraining TC.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3736:8-11; Appx. at 12-15.  \n579.  In another example of chemical restraint, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist recommended \nincreasing the dosage of the psychotropic medication Seroquel that CHDC administered to DH \nbecause DH became agitated when receiving redirection from CHDC staff.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3767:2-12; US Ex. 836.  CHDC used this increase in psychotropic medication to chemically \nrestrain DH’s behavioral difficulties, not treat a psychiatric disorder.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3767:13-20. \n580.  Youth LW represents yet another example of CHDC’s unjustified chemical restraint use.  \nLW was admitted to CHDC in 2008 at age 6.  Holloway Tr. 2558:19-2559:4; US Ex. 899 at \nCON-US-0134185.  LW’s individual program plan does not indicate that LW is receiving any \nmedications for psychiatric reasons, apart from a sleeping disorder.  Holloway Tr. 2558:19-\n2559:18.  LW’s annual nursing assessment indicates that he is given the medication trazadone \nfor sleep at noon.  Holloway Tr. 2559:21-2560:2; US Ex. JH-1.  Trazadone is an extreme \nsedative that is inconsistent with normal daily activities for a six-year-old boy, such as school.  \nHolloway Tr. 2560:19-2561:1.   \n581.  LW’s nursing assessment also states that trazadone is administered for behavioral \nreasons.  US Ex. JH-1; Holloway Tr. 2561:19-2562:1.  CHDC physician Dr. Parmley admitted \nthat LW is administered trazadone in the middle of the day for behaviors.  Parmley Tr. 5455:6-\n197 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 203 of 318\n \n24.  Neither LW’s nursing assessment nor his individual program plan provides a clinically \njustifiable purpose for CHDC to give him trazadone for behaviors.  US Exs. 899 & JH-1; \nHolloway Tr. 2562:9-10, 2566:5-13.  LW is receiving trazadone as a chemical restraint.  \nHolloway Tr. 2562:7-10. \nE.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Psychiatric Care Results in Harm to CHDC Residents from \nClinically Deficient Assessments of Medication Efficacy. \n582.  Properly tracking pro-social and negative behaviors forms an essential part of \ndetermining psychiatric treatment.  Appropriate medication and psychiatric diagnosis should \ncause associated symptoms and behaviors to decrease, while pro-social behaviors should \nincrease.  Pro-social behaviors include participating in outings, engaging in appropriate \ninteractions, and other activities that are generally viewed as positive.  A clinician cannot \nappropriately determine treatment efficacy without assessing whether all of an individual’s \nbehaviors, positive and negative, have been affected.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3598:18-3599:6.  Contrary \nto this standard, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist admitted that typically the information he \nreviews regarding an individual’s status consists only of negative considerations  -  rates of \naggression and frequency of time in restraints.  Callahan Tr. 5366:12-5368:8; US Ex. 824 at \nCON-US-0126032.  Relatedly, psychology examiners typically report to the consulting \npsychiatrist only the frequency of problematic behaviors that have been targeted by behavior \nplans, such as occurrences of aggression or self-injurious behavior.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3626:17-\n3627:5.  They typically do not even mention pro-social behaviors.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3627:6-10. \n583.   Further, generally accepted professional standards require a psychiatrist to link the plan \nof treatment to established target symptoms associated with an individual’s psychiatric diagnosis.  \n198 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 204 of 318\n \nYet, CHDC’s consultant psychiatrist does not explain in his treatment plan how the medications \nshould affect the symptoms of the individual’s disorder.  Holloway Tr. 2533:16-18.  Nor does he \notherwise outline the target symptoms that are associated with a specific diagnosis.  Holloway \nTr. 2532:16-17.  He also does not instruct the individual’s treatment team what to assess, or how \nto assess it, to determine whether the medication is actually helping the individual.  Mikkelsen \nTr. 3624:22-3625:7. \n584.  Instead, as in many other aspects of psychiatric care at CHDC, the facility makes \npsychology examiners responsible for establishing the targets to judge a medication’s efficacy.  \nHolloway Tr. 2529:22-2530:25, 2531:1-5; Mikkelsen Tr. 3624:22- 3625:2, 3598:4-8; see also \nCallahan Tr. 5365:13-15 (CHDC’s psychiatrist admitted this fact at trial.).   \n585.  Closely related to determinations of medication efficacy are a psychiatrist’s professional \ndetermination of when to increase or lower, e.g., “taper,” the psychotropic medications that an \nindividual receives, because both determinations depend on assessing the individual’s response \nto the medication.   Taper criteria should be established according to evidence-based practice \nregarding psychiatric disorders and associated medications, and objective data based on the \nindividual’s target symptoms and ability to participate and enjoy daily activities.  Holloway Tr. \n2579:6-2580:3, 2577:14-2578:3.  \n586.  At CHDC, taper criteria for medications substantially depart from generally accepted \nminimum standards.  As in other areas of psychiatric care, CHDC psychology examiners \nestablish the taper criteria for medication adjustments at CHDC without the consulting \npsychiatrist’s participation.  Holloway Tr. 2532:24-2533:2; see also Callahan Tr. 5364:2-10 \n199 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 205 of 318\n \n587.  Contrary to CHDC’s practice, taper criteria should not be based simply on incidents of \naggression.  Holloway Tr. 2581:3-7.  Yet, CHDC psychology examiners use rates of broad \nbehaviors, such as aggression, as the driving force behind assessing medication effects.  \nHolloway Tr. 2533:3-9.  Moreover, CHDC’s focus is on maladaptive behaviors that are not even \nlinked or identified with a diagnostic condition.  Holloway Tr. 2533:19-25.  Beyond CHDC’s \nsubstandard taper practice, this also shows CHDC’s improper use of psychotropic medication as \nchemical restraint to suppress behaviors. \n588.  The improper taper criteria CHDC employed to reduce LW’s psychotropic medication, \ntrazadone, illustrates this deficiency.  The criteria require that LW sleep an average of eight \nhours a night for a year, a standard that would be too high for most individuals to achieve.  \nHolloway Tr. 2561:15-18, 2580:4-15; US Ex. 899 at CON-US-0134 200.  The taper criteria \nfound throughout the individual program plans for CHDC residents have similar critical flaws.  \nHolloway Tr. 2580:16-24. \nF.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Psychiatric Care Results in Harm to CHDC Residents from \nDelayed Psychiatric Assessments.   \n589.  CHDC’s failure to provide timely and comprehensive consultations and assessments \nsubstantially departs from generally accepted practices.  Holloway Tr. 2621:14-18; see FOF ## \n591-595. \n590.  For extended periods of time, CHDC routinely withholds psychiatric care from residents \nwhom CHDC has identified as experiencing psychiatric distress or psychiatric instability.  This \ndelay in psychiatric intervention is a substantial departure from generally accepted professional \nstandards that exposes individuals to harm and risk of harm from prolonged psychiatric distress \n200 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 206 of 318\n \nand instability.  CHDC compounds this delay in psychiatric services by also failing to provide \nsufficient amounts of psychiatric services.  See FOF ## 591-610.    \n1)  CHDC’s Substandard Delays in Seeing Individuals After Admission \n591.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist does not see individuals identified as having possible \npsychiatric issues in a clinically appropriate time after admission.  Holloway Tr. 2517:13-23; \nMikkelsen Tr. 3654:22-3655:1.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist acknowledged that he does not \nknow when he sees individuals following their admission to CHDC.  Holloway Tr. 2517:7-12. \n592.  According to generally accepted professional standards, a qualified child and adolescent \npsychiatrist should perform a consultation within 7 days of admission for patients age 14 and 15 \n(and a follow up every 30 days) and within 21 days for patients 16 to 17 (and a follow up every \n45 days).  US Ex. 870; Holloway Tr. 2548:4-10.  Even Defendants’ consultant Dr. Kastner \nidentified 30 days of admission as an appropriate care standard for psychiatric evaluations after \nadmission.  Kastner Tr. 4085:19-25.   \n593.  As discussed above, CHDC admitted a young boy, CHL, while he was receiving the \npsychotropic medication lithium.  See FOF # 510.  This medication must be carefully managed \nbecause of the narrow range between what is therapeutic and toxic.   A child psychiatrist should \nsee a young boy on lithium soon after admission.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3681:8-13.  In CHL’s case, \nCHDC’s consulting psychiatrist did not see CHL or even involve himself in CHL’s care until \nmore than five weeks after CHL was admitted to CHDC.  Even more dangerously harmful, this \nincluded a week after CHL became comatose from lithium toxicity, had to be airlifted to the \nhospital, was subjected to multiple rounds of dialysis, and nearly died.  US Ex. 897; Appx. at 5-\n8.   \n201 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 207 of 318\n \n594.  Defendants’ own witnesses repeatedly confirmed that CHDC routinely and grossly \nexceeds the clinical standards of care endorsed by Dr. Holloway, and even Defendants’ \nconsultant Dr. Kastner.  See Kraus Tr. 6251:8-25 (CHDC resident MB was admitted to CHDC \nwith a number of medical and psychiatric disorders but was not seen by a psychiatrist until \napproximately three months after her admission.), 6261:15-6262:17 (CHDC resident HB was \nadmitted to CHDC with a number of complex medical, behavioral, and psychiatric disorders but \nwas not seen by a psychiatrist until approximately two months after his admission.), 6304:21-\n6305:9 (CHDC resident JM was admitted to CHDC with a number of medical and psychiatric \ndiagnoses, including seizures, autism, and “stable brain atrophy,” and while receiving multiple \npsychotropic medications, but was not seen by a psychiatrist until approximately two months \nafter his admission.), 6269:11-20 (CHDC resident MM was admitted to CHDC with a number of \nbehavioral and psychiatric disorders but was not seen by a psychiatrist until approximately seven \nweeks after admission.), 6270:22-6271:7 (CHDC resident CJ was admitted to CHDC with a \npsychiatric diagnosis of autism and was receiving multiple psychotropic medications but was not \nseen by a psychiatrist until approximately eight weeks after admission.), 6307:6-15 (CHDC \nresident SW was admitted to CHDC with diagnoses of seizures, autism, and anxiety disorder but \nwas not seen by a psychiatrist until approximately seven weeks after admission.), 6271:8-6272:7 \n(CHDC resident RD was admitted to CHDC with a number of medical disorders and while \nreceiving multiple psychotropic medications, but was not seen by a psychiatrist until \napproximately eight weeks after admission.), 6280:2-18 (CHDC resident HA was admitted to \nCHDC with a history of ADHD but was not seen by a psychiatrist until approximately 12 weeks \nafter admission.); Holloway Tr. 2545:16-2546:16, 2546:22-2547:6; Kraus Tr. 6292:9-20; US Ex. \n875 at CON-US-0274721-723 (CHDC resident TM was admitted to CHDC while receiving the \n202 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 208 of 318\n \npsychotropic medication Risperdal twice a day.  TM also had a history of prior psychiatric \nhospitalizations and a seizure disorder.  Nevertheless, TM was not seen by a psychiatrist until \napproximately five weeks after admission to CHDC.). \n595.  CHDC’s excessive delays in providing psychiatric care to individuals who have been \nidentified with psychiatric needs harms these individuals by leaving them in psychiatric distress \nand instability and exposes them to harm from improperly managed psychotropic medication, as \nevidenced by CHL.  See FOF ## 510, 591 & 592. \n2)  Clinically Inadequate Psychiatric Oversight  \n596.  According to CHDC, many of its residents have highly complex psychiatric needs.  \nKraus Tr. 6232:6-15; Mikkelsen Tr. 3584:5-8.  In fact, nearly 300 of CHDC’s 500 residents \nreceive psychotropic medications, and approximately half of them receive multiple psychotropic \nmedications.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3584:16-19.   \n597.  Although CHDC administers psychotropic medications to most of its residents, CHDC \nfails to provide them with timely psychiatric oversight of those medications, exposing them to \nharm from inadequate medication management and insufficient psychiatric care to meet their \nneeds.  CHDC makes residents with severe psychiatric diagnosis and complex medication \nregimens wait months for necessary follow up and monitoring.  See FOF ## 598-609. \n598.  According to generally accepted professional standards, a psychiatrist should physically \nsee an individual who is not doing well psychiatrically at least once every two weeks to stabilize \nthe individual.  Holloway Tr. 2511:16-19.  The psychiatrist should conduct follow-up visits at \nleast weekly for an unstable individual who is undergoing medication changes, and every three \n203 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 209 of 318\n \nmonths for a person who is extremely stable and receiving psychotropic medications that do not \nhave many side effects.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3621:6-12. \n599.  Contrary to these accepted standards, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist acknowledged that \nhe rarely sees anyone more than once a month.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3631:25-3632:2.  Moreover, the \nmajority of the psychiatrist’s follow-up visits occur below the standard at two-to-three-month \nintervals.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3622:4-6.  The psychiatrist even subjects residents whom he identified \nas experiencing a difficult psychiatric period to this substandard two-to-three-month follow-up \npractice.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3623:23-3624:1.  All these CHDC follow-up practices constitute \nsubstandard psychiatric care.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3624:2-3. \n600.  CHDC’s frequency of psychiatric follow up even fails Defendants’ own purported \nstandards.  Defendants invoke the “Experts’ Consensus Guidelines.”  Kastner Tr. 4149:15-17.  \nThese guidelines state that psychiatrists should “[r]eview regimen regularly (at least every three \nmonths and within one month of drug/dose change) to determine if medication is still necessary \nand if lowest optimal effective dose is being used.”  Kastner Tr. 6318:2-10. \n601.  There are many examples of CHDC substantially departing from generally accepted \nstandards for resident monitoring.  In CHL’s case, after waiting five weeks to see CHL following \nhis admission, and his near death from the side effects of psychotropic medication, the consulting \npsychiatrist scheduled CHL’s next appointment for three months later.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3679:2-4; \nAppx. at 5-8. \n602.  During a May 2009 psychiatric consult, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist identified TM as \nhaving potential psychosis and identified several possible factors affecting TM’s condition.  He \ndid not, however, give any guidance to TM’s treatment team regarding what to track in order to \n204 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 210 of 318\n \nestablish or rule out this diagnosis.  Holloway Tr. 2549:11, 2551:15-2553:9.  Notwithstanding \nthe uncertainty in TM’s psychiatric condition, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist scheduled TM’s \nnext psychiatric appointment for two months later.  Holloway Tr. 2553:2-5. \n603.  Defendants’ consultant Dr. Kraus testified that his review of LW’s psychiatric care \nindicated that LW had gone nine months between psychiatric visits.  Kraus Tr. 6245:22-6247:2.   \n604.  Defendants’ consultant Dr. Kraus testified that his review of MB’s psychiatric care \nindicated that MB had gone six months between psychiatric visits.  Kraus Tr. 6252:1-16.  Dr. \nKraus further testified that MB was scheduled to go another three months between psychiatric \nvisits, even though CHDC was changing her psychotropic dosages.  Kraus Tr. 6253:12-22; see \nalso Kraus Tr. 6255:20-23 (conceding that an earlier follow up was “not a bad idea”). \n605.  Defendants’ consultant Dr. Kraus testified that his review of resident CJ’s records \nindicated that CJ had gone more than three months between psychiatric visits, even though \nCHDC’s consulting psychiatrist had commented during CJ’s last psychiatric visit that CJ had an \nincrease in targeted behavior following a medication change.  Kraus Tr. 6269:21-6270:5. \n606.  Defendants’ consultant Dr. Kraus testified that his review of resident JM’s records \nindicated that JM had gone more than four months since JM’s last psychiatric visit, even though \nJM had diagnoses of autism, seizures, stable brain atrophy, and JM was receiving multiple \npsychiatric medications.  Kraus Tr. 6304:21-6305:12. \n607.  Defendants’ consultant Dr. Kraus testified that he found “a series of kids that had not \nbeen seen in six to nine months, and I brought this up.”  Kraus Tr. 6252:9-11.  Dr. Kraus testified \n205 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 211 of 318\n \nthat CHDC’s delays in seeing youths at CHDC led him to recommend that CHDC obtain \nadditional psychiatric services.  Kraus Tr. 6253:6-11. \n608.  Rather than see residents on a timely basis, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist will \nrecommend several medication changes, including classes of different medications in which the \nindividual’s response is more uncertain, based on rates of broadly categorized behavior \ncategories or uses of restraint.  He routinely makes such dangerous changes without spelling out \na diagnostic formulation, identifying the target symptoms for a particular medication, or \nspecifying the indications for medication changes.  Holloway Tr. 2528:19-2529:5, 2538:4-14, \n2569:10-2571:5; Mikkelsen Tr. 3622:10-15.  As a consequence, CHDC places residents at risk of \nexperiencing harmful reactions to medications or other changes in their condition because of \nsignificant changes in their medications without being seen by a psychiatrist for an extended \nperiod.  This is a substantial departure from generally accepted professional standards of care.  \nSee FOF ## 509, 510 & 598.  The CHDC consulting psychiatrist’s recommendations sometimes \ninvolve making as many as four potential medication changes before the consulting psychiatrist \neven sees the individual again in two to three months.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3622:15-18.   \n609.  The consulting psychiatrist’s July 2009 consulting note for BLH illustrates this \ndangerously substandard practice:  “If we see no improvement in frequency of behavior reports, \ncould consider 25-milligram increase in the thioridazine dosage in the morning as tolerated.”  \nHolloway Tr. 2571:15-2572:11.  As Dr. Holloway testified, “Instead of Dr. Callahan coming in \nand assessing the individual and ruling out potential other variables in this example, such as \nakathisia . . ., the psych examiner comes in and . . . recommended an increase in thioridazine of \n25 milligrams as noted per Dr. Callahan’s last note.  And [the psychology examiner] says: ‘I \n206 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 212 of 318\n \nrecommend an increase and will monitor for any effectiveness, decrease agitation, aggression, \nand any side effects.’”   Holloway Tr. 2572:17-2573:2.  In other words, in the interim between \npsychiatric visits, the psychology examiner, rather than the psychiatrist, initiated a change in \nBLH’s psychotropic medication.  Holloway Tr. 2572:17-2573:2.  BLH represents just an \nexample of this substandard practice at CHDC.  Holloway Tr. 2576:5-7.  \n3)  CHDC’s Insufficient Availability of Psychiatric Services \n610.   CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist does not work for CHDC anywhere near a minimally \nsufficient time to meet the needs of persons on his case load.  Defendants’ contract with him \nprovides approximately a mere 18 hours a week of psychiatric consulting services to \napproximately 500 people diagnosed with co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses across three State \ninstitutions.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3650:3-3651:2; Callahan Tr. 5374:13-21.  This time is not nearly \nsufficient, particularly given the complexity of CHDC’s population.  Holloway Tr. 2511:24-\n2512:5, 2539:11-19. Mikkelsen Tr. 3651:3-10.  CHDC residents’ needs require the equivalent of \na full-time psychiatrist to be on site.  Holloway Tr. 2539:19-24.  Defendant’s consultant Dr. \nLouis Kraus testified that his assessment as to the adequacy of psychiatric services at CHDC was \ndependent upon CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist working full-time at CHDC.  Kraus Tr. \n6361:15-18.  Dr. Kraus wrongly assumed that CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist worked full-time \nat the facility.  Kraus Tr. 6361:15-18, 6368:1-6.  Even based on the incorrect assumption that \nCHDC’s consulting psychiatrist worked full-time at CHDC, Dr. Kraus concluded that “they \ncould benefit from additional psychiatric care and [sic] something they should talk to the \nUniversity about in regard to their contract.”  Kraus Tr. 6213:5-11. \n \n207 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 213 of 318\n \nG.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Psychiatric Care Results in Harm to CHDC Residents from \nCHDC’s Failure To Provide Its Consulting Psychiatrist with Sufficient \nTraining and Oversight.    \n611.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist has no formal training in treating individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities.  Further, he is not board-certified in child and adolescent psychiatry \nand has had no formal training in treating children and adolescents.  Yet, CHDC maintains that \nmany of the children under his care have complex psychiatric histories.  Further, CHDC provides \nno clinical oversight over its consultant psychiatrist or other mechanisms to address his \ndeficiencies in training.  See FOF ## 612-624. \n612.  Dr. Douglas Callahan is the consulting psychiatrist at CHDC.  Callahan Tr. 5333:14-18.   \nDr. Callahan has responsibility for virtually all of CHDC’s residents receiving psychiatric \nconsultation services.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3590:3-4, 3590:14-18; Holloway Tr. 2504:22-2505:10. \n613.  Although the consulting psychiatrist does not sign the actual orders for medication \nadministration, CHDC’s primary care physicians simply adopt his recommendations in virtually \nevery instance.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3590:4-8; Callahan Tr. 5374:9-12; Thomas Tr. 1734:3-22; \nParmley Tr. 5471:10-13.  As a practical matter, CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist treats CHDC’s \nresidents.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3655:9-17. \n614.  Dr. Callahan is not adequately trained or supervised to serve as CHDC’s psychiatrist.  A \npsychiatrist treating individuals at like those at CHDC should either have specialized training in \nserving persons with developmental disabilities or have supervision on the job that would \nconstitute such training because individuals with developmental disabilities and psychiatric \nneeds often have issues of assessment, diagnosis, and care that are distinct from individuals \n208 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 214 of 318\n \nwithout developmental disabilities.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3639:10-19, 3640:6-25.  CHDC’s consulting \npsychiatrist admits that he has had no specialized training in providing psychiatric care to \nindividuals with developmental disabilities.  Callahan Tr. 5352:5-8; Mikkelsen Tr. 3638:13-16; \nUS Ex. 763-1.  Nor has he received on-the-job training in treating individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3640:20-3641:3.  Nor is he supervised by someone \nwho has had such training.  Holloway Tr. 2505:13-14; Mikkelsen Tr. 3641:11-20; Thomas Tr. \n1730:2-6. \n615.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist is even less qualified to provide psychiatric care to \nCHDC children.  The consulting psychiatrist provides psychiatric care to children as young as \nseven, and acknowledged that children admitted to CHDC often have had numerous prior \npsychiatric hospitalizations.  Holloway Tr. 2513:8-9, 2510:2-4.  CHDC currently houses \napproximately 50 children.  A. Green Tr. 846:2-3; US Ex. 229.  Approximately half of them are \nreceiving psychotropic medications.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3589:24-25.  These individuals often are \nexperiencing complex psychiatric disturbance and require specialty services.  Holloway Tr. \n2515:4-8.   \n616.  Notwithstanding the complexity of children and adolescents at CHDC, CHDC’s \nconsulting psychiatrist is not board certified in child psychiatry.  Callahan Tr. 5352:16-19; \nHolloway Tr. 2513:9-22; Mikkelsen Tr. 3638:13-19.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist has never \nparticipated in a child psychiatry residency program.  Callahan Tr. 5353:21-5354:1; Mikkelsen \nTr. 3641:9-10.   \n617.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist has had no formal training in child and adolescent \npsychiatry.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3638:16-24; US Ex. 763-1.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist does not \n209 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 215 of 318\n \nconsult with a child and adolescent psychiatrist to supplement his lack of training.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3641:11-16; Holloway Tr. 2548:15-16. \n618.  The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has issued policy statements \nsetting out the qualifications for psychiatrists treating children and adolescents needing \ninstitutional psychiatric care.  US Ex. 870; Holloway Tr. 2515:25-2516:21.  These policy \nstatements instruct that, for children “under 14 years of age, a qualified psychiatrist is a child and \nadolescent psychiatrist who is board certified in child and adolescent psychiatry or a psychiatrist \nwho, in addition to general psychiatry training, has successfully completed a training program in \nchild and adolescent psychiatry accredited by the accreditation council of graduate medical \neducation,” and for persons “14 to 17 years of age or older, a qualified psychiatrist is a child and \nadolescent psychiatrist . . . or a general psychiatrist who has documented sufficient specialized \ntraining and experience in working with adolescents and their families on an inpatient treatment \nprogram and has demonstrated competence to examine and treat adolescents comprehensively.” \nUS Ex. 870; Holloway Tr. 2515:25-2516:21.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist lacks such \nqualifications.  Holloway Tr. 2516:22-23. \n619.  CHDC’s failure to provide psychiatric treatment to children and adolescents through a \nqualified psychiatrist substantially departs from generally accepted professional standards.  \nHolloway Tr. 2621:4-9. \n620.  CHDC provides no clinical supervision or clinical oversight to the unqualified consulting \npsychiatrist.  Holloway Tr. 2505:13-14; Mikkelsen Tr. 3639:23-3640:5, 3641:17-20.  CHDC’s \nconsulting psychiatrist testified that the closest person to someone who exercised clinical \noversight of him was Dr. Denise Thomas.  Callahan Tr. 5376:7-9.  Tellingly, Dr. Thomas \n210 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 216 of 318\n \ntestified that she does not supervise CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist, nor does anyone provide \nclinical oversight of CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist.  Thomas Tr. 1729:25-1730:6.   \n621.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist is not subject to formal, routine peer review.  Holloway \nTr. 2505:11-12; Mikkelsen Tr. 3641:21-22, 3645:14-3646:18; US Ex. 776. \n622.  CHDC has no policies and procedures governing psychiatric services.  Holloway Tr. \n2504:14-16. \n623.  The medication utilization of CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist is not subject to review.  \nHolloway Tr. 2596:16-21.   \n624.  CHDC’s failure to provide clinical supervision or clinical oversight to the unqualified \nconsulting psychiatrist substantial departs from generally accepted professional standards.  \nHolloway Tr. 2640:10-20, 2705:3-2706:5.   \nH.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Psychiatric Care Results in Harm to CHDC Residents from \nLack of Coordination and Communication Regarding Psychiatric Care. \n625.  The failure of CHDC’s clinicians to coordinate effectively to meet the needs of CHDC \nresidents has contributed to the death of at least one resident and to multiple other breakdowns in \ncare.  CHDC’s system of psychiatric care substantial departs for generally accepted minimum \nprofessional standards by not ensuring clinicians coordinate care resulting in dangerously \nuninformed treatment and medication decisions.  See FOF ## 626-637.    \n626.  CHDC resident CJ’s death from Haldol shows the harmful effects of CHDC’s failure to \ncoordinate clinician services.  Resident CJ died from neuroleptic malignant syndrome caused by \nHaldol, which CHDC inappropriately administered to suppress the side effects of another, \n211 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 217 of 318\n \nunnecessary medication, Keppra.  See FOF # 509; Appx. at 2-5.  There is no evidence that \nclinicians involved in her care communicated and coordinated to determine the necessity of the \nKeppra or the purported necessity of the Haldol which killed her.  Appx. at 2.   \n627.  Similarly, CHDC resident TN required blood transfusions to correct dangerously low \nplatelets.  CHDC clinicians knew that the psychotropic medication Depakote likely was causing \nTN’s drop in blood platelets.  Yet, TN’s chart indicates that CHDC’s clinicians did not know \nwhether a neurologist had determined that TN continued to require the Depakote, which was \nstarted years earlier in response to possible seizures, and there is no evidence that CHDC \nclinicians coordinated to determine whether TN needed to receive the Depakote instead of one of \nseveral alternative medications.  Appx. at 9-10.   \n628.  CHDC clinicians need to work together on a systematic basis because CHDC residents \nreceive numerous medications for varied medical issues.  Holloway Tr. 2493:24-2494:1; \nMikkelsen Tr. 3628:22-3629:10.  The generally accepted systematic treatment process requires \nthe psychiatrist to address the whole medical case, not just the psychiatric case, because of drug \nto drug interactions and side effects that may occur if one is receiving complex medication \nregimens.  Holloway Tr. 2494:7-10.  Changing even one medication can cause changes in the \neffects of other medications.  Holloway Tr. 2494:11-2495:3, 2578:7-2579:5; Mikkelsen Tr. \n3629:5-10.  CHDC’s records, however, indicate that there is no continuity between the medical \nand psychiatric disciplines and no meaningful coordination of care for overlapping medical and \npsychiatric conditions.  Holloway Tr. 2506:20-2507:4.  The cases of CJ and TN illustrate the \nassociated harms.  Appx. at 2-5, 9-10.   \n212 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 218 of 318\n \n629.  Because psychiatric and neurological medicines have overlapping effects on psychiatric \nand neurologic disorders, psychiatric and neurologic care must be closely coordinated.  \nMikkelsen Tr. 3629:11-15.  This coordination needs to be memorialized in writing.  Mikkelsen \nTr. 3630:8-10.  At CHDC, the consulting psychiatrist does not even speak with neurologists who \nprovide care to persons on his case load.  Holloway Tr. 2507:5-8; Mikkelsen Tr. 3630:11-20.  \nCHDC’s consulting psychiatrist admitted that his communication with other specialist clinicians \ntreating individuals on his caseload is limited to reviewing their notes.  Callahan Tr. 5375:1-11.  \nA review of another clinician’s notes is not a substitute for raising issues of overlapping care \nwith another clinician and consulting about how that care will proceed going forward.  \nMikkelsen Tr. 3629:24-3630:10. \n630.   CHDC’s physicians do not involve, or even contact, the consulting psychiatrist when \nemergency psychiatric care is provided to CHDC residents.  Holloway Tr. 2512:6-2513:2.  \nIndeed, the primary physician responsible for prescribing emergency psychiatric medications for \nCHDC residents does not know the consulting psychiatrist and has never even met him.  \nHolloway Tr. 2507:21-2508:6. \n631.  The CHDC consulting psychiatrist is not notified when an individual on his caseload is \ngiven emergency psychiatric medication and does not learn about the emergency psychiatric \nmedication until he next sees the individual for a regularly scheduled appointment.  Holloway Tr. \n2508:7-15. \n632.  The use of emergency psychiatric medication represents a significant clinical event.  This \nemergency use should trigger the prompt involvement of the psychiatrist and the IDT to assess \nthe reasons why the medication was administered and what the psychiatrist and IDT should do to \n213 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 219 of 318\n \navoid having to use emergency psychiatric medication again.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist \nfrequently delays addressing such serious clinical events until the resident’s next clinic \nappointment, an unacceptable practice that substantially departs from generally accepted \nprofessional standards.  Holloway Tr. 2508:16-2509:15.   \n633.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist does not participate in IDT meetings and does not \nconsider himself to be a member of the IDT.  Holloway Tr. 2505:15-18; Mikkelsen Tr. 3590:19-\n23.   \n634.  The consulting psychiatrist’s interactions with the individuals he treats, and staff \nresponsible for their care, consists primarily of briefly meeting with the individual in an office, in \nthe company of a direct care staff person and a psychology examiner.  Holloway Tr. 2507:13-17; \nMikkelsen Tr. 3590:8-11.  \n635.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist sees individuals in an office setting, rather than an \nenvironment more conducive to the individuals, even when doing so is known to be upsetting for \nthe individual, to trigger aggressive behaviors, to be physically harmful to staff, and to likely \nreinforce the individual’s problematic behaviors.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3632:3-3635:5; US Ex. MC-4.  \nThis does not comport with generally accepted professional standards of care.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3636:21-3637:15.   \n636.  The consulting psychiatrist’s lack of interaction with individuals’ interdisciplinary teams \nis a departure from generally accepted professional standards of care.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3627:17-23.   \n637.  CHDC’s consulting psychiatrist does not regularly interact with individuals’ primary care \nproviders to discuss cases in an organized way.

Mikkelsen Tr. 3628:3-6.  This \nlack of structured interaction with medical providers complicates the important issue of ensuring \nthat medical problems are accounted for in assessing the causes of a possible disorder.  \nMikkelsen Tr. 3628:11-21. \nIX.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW– PSYCHIATRY \nDefendants harm CHDC residents in multiple respects through grossly deficient \npsychiatric care, in violation of their constitutional rights.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment’s \nDue Process Clause, “adequate . . . medical care” is one of the care “essentials” that a state must \nprovide to institutionalized individuals with development disabilities.  Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 \nU.S. 307, 324 (1982); see also Rennie v. Klein, 720 F.2d 266, 269 (3d Cir. 1983).  Accordingly, \nDefendants violate the Due Process Clause when they provide care that substantially departs \nfrom professional standards.  Rennie, 720 F.2d at 269; see also Morgan v. Rabun, 128 F.3d 694, \n697-98 (8th Cir. 1997); Heidemann v.Rother, 84 F.3d 1021, 1029 (8th Cir. 1996).   \nWhen evaluating the professional judgment regarding the prescribing of psychotropic \nmedication, courts should consider “whether and to what extent the patient will suffer harmful \nside effects.”  Rennie, 720 F.2d at 269.  CHDC harms its residents, in violation of their \nconstitutional rights, by failing to recognize or treat side effects and toxic levels of psychotropic \nmedication, causing fatal and serious harm or risk of harm to residents, in a substantial departure \nfrom professional standards of psychiatric care.  CHDC’s only psychiatrist does not adequately \nmonitor residents for side effects and medication levels; CHDC’s direct care staff and on-call \nphysician fail to detect side effects and toxic levels; and the facility itself maintains no overall \n215 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 221 of 318\n \nsystem of tracking risk factors that result from unmonitored administration of psychotropic \nmedication.   \nCHDC also unlawfully harms its residents through other deficient psychiatric practices \nthat substantially depart from generally accepted professional standards, namely:  its use of \nclinically deficient diagnoses to justify medications; its unjustified medication practices \n(including to suppress other medication’s side effects, in response to non-psychiatric \nenvironmental behaviors, and as chemical restraints); its clinically deficient assessments of \nmedication efficacy; and its untimely psychiatric assessments and follow up care.  To satisfy \nconstitutional standards, treatment practices must reflect “professional judgment.”  Youngberg, \n457 U.S. at 322-23.  At minimum, evidence must show that such professional judgment was \nindeed exercised.  Id.  This standard is not met when a professional’s decision substantially \ndeparts from generally accepted standards or practice.   Id.; see Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d \n250, 252-254 (4th Cir. 1990) (treating professional’s decision not conclusive in determining \nwhether professional judgment was indeed exercised).  The foregoing evidence compellingly \ndemonstrates such harmful departures. \nFinally, CHDC violates its residents’ constitutional rights to adequate psychiatric care \nthrough its use of a consultant psychiatrist who is not a professional qualified to treat children \nwith developmental disabilities, who has had no training in providing psychiatric care to \nindividuals with developmental disabilities, who is effectively providing treatment without \nclinical oversight, and who lacks sufficient time to meet individuals’ needs.   Professional \ndecisions about the services a resident receives must be based upon the individual’s needs, not \navailable services or administrative convenience.  See Ohlinger v. Watson, 652 F.2d 775, 779 \n(9th Cir. 1981) (“Lack of funds, staff or facilities cannot justify the State’s failure to provide \n216 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 222 of 318\n \nappellants with that treatment necessary for rehabilitation.”); see also Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 699 \nF. Supp. 1178, 1200 (W.D.N.C. 1988) (“Professional judgment probably was not exercised ‘if it \nwas modified to conform to available treatment rather than appropriate treatment.’”) (internal \ncitation omitted); Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 629 F. Supp. 1487, 1495 (N.D. Tex. 1986) (“Evidence that \nthe professional judgment was made to conform to what was available may indicate that the \njudgment was ‘a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice or \nstandards.’”).  Here, the evidence clearly establishes that psychiatric treatment is chronically and \ngrossly delayed and provided by one psychiatrist with insufficient training or availability to meet \nthe needs of the many CHDC residents on his caseload, in violation of their constitutional rights.  \nSee Oregon Advocacy Ctr. v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101, 1120-21 (9th Cir. 2003) (delays in providing \npretrial detainees with access to mental health care violates Due Process Clause).   \nX.  FINDINGS OF FACT – MEDICAL CARE \n638.  CHDC’s medical care significantly and systemically departs from generally accepted \nprofessional standards of care.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3573:22-3574:22.  In particular, CHDC clinicians \nlack oversight and depend excessively on direct care staff to identify changes in health status.  \nAs a consequence, CHDC provides untimely care that has resulted in extraordinarily high rights \nof mortalities from normally nonfatal aspiration pneumonias and a strikingly young average age \nof death.  See FOF ## 639-653. \nA.  CHDC Inappropriately Relies on Untrained Direct Care Staff To Identify \nChanges in Health Status. \n639.  At CHDC, primary care physicians do not make rounds on residential units.  Thomas Tr. \n1746:22-1747:3.  Rather, CHDC gives untrained direct care staff responsibility for identifying \nindividuals who require medical attention.  Thomas Tr. 1747:4-10.  CHDC’s medical director \n217 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 223 of 318\n \ndoes not know whether CHDC provides direct care staff with any reference materials to consult \nto identify medical problems.  Thomas Tr. 1747:11-15. \n640.  At CHDC, direct care staff do not have adequate training to recognize emerging medical \nproblems.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3655:7-8.  At CHDC, primary care physicians typically see individuals \nonly through a sick call process.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3651:18-3653:1.  CHDC’s sick call system is not \nadequate, because the system relies too heavily on untrained direct care staff to make crucial \nmedical observations.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3653:15-24. \nB.  CHDC Exercises Insufficient Clinical Oversight.   \n641.  CHDC’s medical director does not exercise a significant supervisory and quality \nassurance role.  She literally does not know anything about a variety of important issues that \ndirectly affect the quality of medical care.  For instance, CHDC’s medical director could not \nrecall whether she reviews any assessments of hospitalization trends.  Thomas Tr. 1750:1-5. \n642.  CHDC’s medical director has no specialized training in treating individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities.  Thomas Tr. 1724:22-25.  Moreover, only one of CHDC’s four \nprimary care physicians has any specialized training in the provision of medical care to \nindividuals with developmental disabilities.  Thomas Tr. 1725:1-4; Parmley Tr. 5482:6-9. \n643.  CHDC gives the on-call physician, who has no specialized training in treating individuals \nwith developmental disabilities, responsibility for seeing CHDC residents after hours and on \nweekends, and for treating them while hospitalized.  Thomas Tr. 1725:22-24, 1726:11-16.  This \nphysician is effectively working around the clock, raising issues of fatigue and judgment.  \nMikkelsen Tr. 3655:22-3657:3.  CHDC’s medical director supervises the on-call physician.  \nThomas Tr. 1725:11-14.  CHDC’s medical director does not know why the on-call physician \n218 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 224 of 318\n \ndoes not attend CHDC medical peer reviews.  Thomas Tr. 1729:3-10.  She testified that she does \nnot know this information because “[w]e never asked him.”  Thomas Tr. 1729:3-10.  CHDC’s \nmedical director admitted that she did not “have a clue” regarding the accuracy of the on-call \nphysician’s estimate that approximately 70 percent of hospitalizations of CHDC residents relate \nto pneumonia.  Thomas Tr. 1750:11-16. \n644.  CHDC’s medical director testified that she did not know the accuracy of CHDC on-call \nphysician’s estimate that 20 percent of hospitalizations of CHDC residents relate to potentially \nfatal bowel obstructions.  Thomas Tr. 1750:17-1751:4. \n645.  CHDC’s medical director testified that she did not know whether CHDC had undertaken \nany studies regarding the causes of CHDC residents’ deaths.  Thomas Tr. 1751:8-10. \n646.  CHDC’s medical director testified that she did not know what is the leading cause of \ndeath at CHDC.  Thomas Tr. 1751:11-13. \n647.  CHDC’s medical director knows little about CHDC’s medication side effect control \nsystem.  See FOF # 532. \n648.  CHDC’s medical director testified that she was unaware of any instance in which CHDC \nhad reason to even question the care provided by a CHDC doctor or nurse to a CHDC resident.  \nThomas Tr. 1751:14-18. \n649.  At CHDC, physicians as a group meet no more than monthly to discuss patient care.  \nThomas Tr. 1747:16-1749:11.  This is insufficient.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3654:14-18. \n219 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 225 of 318\n \n650.  CHDC’s medical director testified that she does not have responsibility for the overall \ncare of CHDC residents.  Instead, each physician is responsible for their own case load and “they \nhave their malpractice insurance.”  Thomas Tr. 1751:19-1752:9.   \nC.  CHDC’s Bad Clinical Outcomes Confirm Its Deficiencies in Medical Care. \n651.  Based on a two-year period, the average age of death at CHDC is 46.5 years, which is \nshockingly young.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3772:5-16.  This is a significant deviation from the average \nage of death for persons with developmental disabilities residing in similar facilities.  For \ninstance, the average age of death in similar facilities in Massachusetts is approximately 71 years \nold.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3772:16-18.   \n652.  Almost two-thirds of CHDC’s deaths are due to pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.  \nMikkelsen Tr. 3772:18-22.  This rate is unusually high.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3776:11-16.  By \ncomparison, the percentage of individuals with developmental disabilities who died in \nMassachusetts from aspiration pneumonia ranged from approximately 9 to 12 percent for the \nyears 2002-2007.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3774:12-18, 3777:4-24. \n653.  Arkansas community providers, who serve individuals with the same types of disabilities \nand medical concerns as CHDC’s residents, testified that they have not had any clients die of \naspiration pneumonia.  Alberding Tr. 1396:4-7; Bland Tr. 883:8-17; Lambert Tr. 1871:3-8.   \n654.  CHDC’s substandard medical services cause this high death rate from aspiration \npneumonia.  CHDC’s clinicians recommend use of hospice services before the illness appears to \nbe terminal.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3772:23-3773:6.  CHDC’s clinicians recommend use of hospice for \nnon-terminal respiratory illnesses.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3773:7-15.  Dr. Eldon Schulz, medical director \nof the Arkansas Division of Developmental Disabilities, testified that aspiration pneumonia is \n220 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 226 of 318\n \n“absolutely not” normally a terminable condition that would cause someone to seek hospice care.  \nSchulz Tr. 6187:4-7.  CHDC physician, Dr. Parmley, admitted that aspiration pneumonia is a \n“treatable condition” that should not lead to death, unless it was not caught early or treated \nproperly.  Parmley Tr. 5453:10-18.  Dr. Parmley admitted that CHDC residents have died \nfollowing hospitalization, with an admission diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia.  Parmley Tr. \n5453:18-24.   \nXI.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW – MEDICAL CARE \nCHDC residents have a constitutional right to medical services to help maintain or \nimprove functions and to prevent harm from serious medical conditions.  See Youngberg, 457 \nU.S. at 315, 324 (an institutionalized person has a constitutionally protected right to adequate \nmedical care).  A facility for individuals with developmental disabilities must provide these \nmedical services through qualified and trained staff, both at a professional and direct care level. \n Id. at 323 n.30 (even for day-to-day matters, untrained staff should be supervised by a qualified \nprofessional).   \nDefendants’ deficient medical care has harmed CHDC residents, in violation of their \nconstitutional rights, by failing to provide medical services to address their serious medical \nneeds.  Defendants have not provided the minimum level of treatment required to address CHDC \nresidents’ serious medical needs.  Medical care at CHDC is hierarchical, with heavy reliance on \nthe identification of issues by unqualified direct care staff, and inadequate access to care from \nqualified professionals.  The barriers in place mean that many residents with serious needs do not \nreceive necessary treatment until after their conditions have already deteriorated.  Professional \nstaff do not address serious conditions in an interdisciplinary and effective manner.  Instead, a \n221 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 227 of 318\n \ngeneric administrative process substitutes for clinical interventions in response to significant \nhealth risks. \n222 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 228 of 318\nTABLE OF CONTENTS - PHYSICAL AND NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT \nXII.

FINDINGS OF FACT – PHYSICAL AND NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT \n655.  Defendants subject CHDC residents to harm, and unreasonable risk of harm, from \nphysical and nutritional management services that substantially depart from generally accepted \nminimum professional standards.  CHDC residents suffer abnormally high rates of choking, \naspiration pneumonia, bone fractures, and skin pressure sores.  CHDC’s failure to implement and \nmonitor the residents’ physical and nutritional management plans, provide adequate competency-\nbased training, and provide a complete or timely response to incidents, puts CHDC residents at \nan unreasonable risk for choking, aspiration pneumonia, bone fractures, and skin pressure sores.  \nSee FOF ## 656-713. \nA.  Expert Carly Crawford Provided Credible Expert Testimony of CHDC’s \nDeficiencies in Physical and Nutritional Management. \n656.  Expert witness Carly Crawford evaluated CHDC’s provision of physical and nutritional \nmanagement and therapy services, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech-\nlanguage pathology.  Crawford Tr. 2740:9-13. \n657.  Ms. Crawford’s extensive experience in physical and nutritional management qualifies \nher to evaluate CHDC.  US Ex. 952.  She is a licensed occupational therapist, with an \nundergraduate degree in deaf education and a master’s degree in occupational therapy.  Crawford \nTr. 2743:6-23.  Ms. Crawford has education and experience in health systems, anatomy, \nphysiology, and health risks related to physical and nutritional management, speech-language \npathology, and physical therapy.  Crawford Tr. 2742:21-2743:4; US Ex. 952.  She has lectured, \nconducted workshops, and provided clinical instruction in physical and nutritional management.  \nCrawford Tr. 2745:10-13; US Ex. 952.  Ms. Crawford has worked extensively as a consultant \n224 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 230 of 318\n(on behalf of states and the Department of Justice), provided technical assistance, and acted as a \ncourt monitor in the area of physical and nutritional management.  She has provided expert \nconsultation to at least 32 ICF/MR facilities in 19 different states.  Crawford Tr. 2747:9-22.     \n658.  Ms. Crawford toured CHDC initially in 2003, then again in July and September of 2009.  \nCrawford Tr. 2741:18-24.  During her review, Ms. Crawford interviewed CHDC staff, reviewed \nextensive documents, and observed and interacted with CHDC residents.  Crawford Tr. 2752:22-\n2753:7; 2753:22-2754:11; 2755:18-2756:14. \n659.  As a result of her review, Ms. Crawford concluded that CHDC has major deficiencies \ncausing residents to suffer preventable harm from choking incidents, aspiration pneumonia, bone \nfractures, and skin pressure ulcers.  Crawford Tr. 2756:18-2757:1.  CHDC’s deficient practices \nregarding staff implementation of physical and nutritional management plans, training, and \nmonitoring caused these harms.  Crawford Tr. 2756:18-2757:4. \n660.  CHDC’s practices with regard to choking, aspiration pneumonia, bone fractures, and skin \npressure ulcers violate generally accepted minimum professional standards because CHDC staff \nfail to:  (1) properly implement the residents’ physical and nutritional management plans; \n(2) monitor staff implementation and effectiveness of the plans; (3) provide adequate \ncompetency-based training; and (4) provide a complete or timely response to incidents.  \nCrawford Tr. 2757:5-16, 2897:1-17; see also Crawford Tr. 2751:20-2752:1 (defining generally \naccepted minimum professional standards).  These failures resulted in harm, and unnecessary \nrisk of harm to residents, as demonstrated by the high numbers of incidents of choking, \naspiration pneumonia, fractures, and pressure ulcers.  Crawford Tr. 2897:18-22. \n225 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 231 of 318\nB.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Physical and Nutritional Management Results in Harm to \nCHDC Residents from Choking. \n661.  CHDC has a “shocking” number of choking incidents for a facility of its size.  Crawford \nTr. 2768:10-17, 2897:18-22.  In the first 9 months of 2009, at least 13 CHDC residents suffered \nchoking incidents.  Crawford Tr. 2767:15-21.  Previous years also showed shockingly high \nnumbers, with 18 CHDC choking incidents in 2008, and 24 in 2007.  Crawford Tr. 2767:5-14; \nUS Ex. 986.  Other facilities have significantly less choking incidents.  Crawford Tr. 2768:10-24. \n662.  CHDC’s substantial departure from generally accepted professional standards requiring \nthat direct care staff properly implement the residents’ eating plans, that CHDC monitor direct \ncare staff’s implementation of the plans, that CHDC employ competency-based training on \neating plans, that CHDC accurately document eating plans, and that CHDC take timely remedial \nsteps, caused resident harm, and increased risk of harm, from choking and aspiration.  See FOF \n## 663-697. \n663.  CHDC’s high number of choking incidents results from CHDC staff failing to implement \nthe residents’ eating plans as the plans are written by the professional therapist staff.  Crawford \nTr. 2769:5-10.   \n664.  Deficiencies in direct care staff training and lack of direct care staff monitoring cause \nCHDC’s failure to implement the plans consistently.  Crawford Tr. 2769:5-25, 2771:17-18. \n665.  CHDC employs substandard, non-competency-based staff training on mealtime safety \nplans.  Crawford Tr. 2771:19-20.  Competency-based training requires, inter alia, staff to \ndemonstrate that they can actually perform the skill.  Crawford Tr. 2772:22-2773:1. \n226 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 232 of 318\n666.  CHDC speech-language pathologist Cynthia Johnson confirmed that unit supervisors, \nrather than professional staff, are responsible for training direct care staff on mealtime safety \nplans.  C. Johnson Tr. 5398:8-25, 5425:18-5426:12.  Professional staff merely train the unit \nsupervisors, and currently, this training is not competency based.  C. Johnson Tr. 5398:2-7, \n5425:18-5426:10.          \n667.  Staff who assist residents with eating need skill-competency-based training on mealtime \nsafety plans to minimize the individual resident’s risk of choking, aspiration, or death.  Crawford \nTr. 2771:19, 2771:23-2772:4.  Competency-based training ensures that staff can demonstrate \nperformance of the particular skills outlined in the resident’s mealtime safety plan.  Crawford Tr. \n2771:19, 2772:5-12.   \n668.  Professional staff’s monitoring of direct care staff reduces the risk of resident harm by \nensuring that direct care staff are correctly implementing the mealtime safety plans and by \nfacilitating coaching to address plan implementation deficiencies.  Crawford Tr. 2773:14-17, \n2774:16-18, 2847:22-23, 2848:8-22.  This monitoring also enables professional staff to assess \nhow the mealtime system is functioning and identify weaknesses.  Crawford Tr. 2773:14-17, \n2774:18-2775:9. \n669.  Defendants’ occupational therapy consultant agreed that direct care staff should be \ntrained on the specific programs for individuals in their care, which should include some level of \nsupervisor observation to ensure that the staff are complying with treatment plans.  Schmeler Tr. \n3508:7-24. \n227 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 233 of 318\n670.  Due to inadequate training and lack of monitoring, CHDC direct care staff demonstrated \nan inadequate understanding of, and the inability to follow, residents’ mealtime safety plans.  \nCrawford Tr. 2773:2-11.  \n671.  For example, in June 2007, CHDC resident VB choked on pizza rolls in her living unit.  \nCrawford Tr. 2775:22-2776:5; US Ex. 1017.  VB was prescribed a blended diet because she does \nnot chew her food and tends to swallow pieces of food whole.  Crawford Tr. 2776:6-13.  When \nCHDC staff found that VB had stuffed pizza rolls into her mouth, the staff offered VB water \nbefore assessing if VB was choking or taking emergency measures.  Crawford Tr. 2776:14-15, \n2776:21-23.  This incident demonstrated that CHDC staff were not properly supervising VB and \nwere not able to properly implement VB’s mealtime safety plan.  Crawford Tr. 2777:2-11.  \nOffering water to an individual on a blended diet who had food in her mouth is “the last thing” \nthat staff should have done because water could have caused the food to lodge in VB’s trachea.  \nCrawford Tr. 2777:2-3, 2777:7-11, 2777:19-2778:3.  By offering VB water before taking proper \nemergency precautions, CHDC staff violated minimum professional standards and put VB at \ngreat risk of harm.  Crawford Tr. 2778:4-8. \n672.  Similar to the VB incident above, in June 2007, CHDC resident LB choked on a piece of \nmeat at lunch.  Crawford Tr. 2778:14-23; US Ex. 1019.  LB was alone at a table.  When another \nresident sat down, LB grabbed a piece of meat off the other resident’s plate and put it in her \nmouth.  Crawford Tr. 2779:1-8.  Staff gave LB the liquid “Ensure” to wash the meat down and, \nafter the liquid ran back out of LB’s mouth, performed the Heimlich maneuver.  Crawford Tr. \n2779:9-16.  Although LB suffered no permanent harm, the “risk of death was very imminent.”  \nCrawford Tr. 2779:1-2, 2779:19-20.  LB’s mealtime safety plan specifically stated that she \n228 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 234 of 318\nattempts to take food, particularly diced or textured foods, from other people and that she had a \nhistory of choking on these foods.  Crawford Tr. 2779:19-2780: 6.  The mealtime safety plan \nalso stated that LB was on a blended diet, should be carefully monitored at meals, should only be \nseated with other individuals with blended or chopped foods, and should be escorted from the \ndining room.  Crawford Tr. 2780:9-14.  Resident LB’s Quick Reference Guide (“QRG”), \nhowever, contained information only about LB being escorted from the dining room.  Crawford \nTr. 2781:3-5.  This example illustrates CHDC staff’s failure to implement a mealtime safety plan \nas written, staff’s poor supervision of residents, and CHDC’s inconsistent guidance to staff \nregarding a resident’s risks that would allow staff to protect CHDC residents from harm, such as \nchoking.  Crawford Tr. 2781:12-18. \n673.  On August 4, 2009, CHDC resident JR “strangled on rice, coughing with such force that \nhe vomited.”  Crawford Tr. 2784:11-21; US Ex. 988.  The therapist noted that although staff are \nsupposed to sit with JR during his meals due to his tendency to eat rapidly and stuff food into his \nmouth, the therapist could not determine if staff were sitting with JR during the incident.  \nCrawford Tr. 2784:11-12, 2784:11-25-2785: 4.  The CHDC dietician did not notify the speech-\nlanguage pathologist of the incident for 6 days, and the speech-language pathologist did not \nconduct a post-event observation of JR until 7 days after the choking.  Crawford Tr. 2788:5-13.  \nA speech-language pathologist should evaluate a choking victim before his next meal so that \nstaff can implement strategies and changes to protect the resident from another choking episode.  \nCrawford Tr. 2789:2-10.  JR’s interdisciplinary team did not meet for a special staffing regarding \nthe incident until 9 days after JR choked.  The interdisciplinary team should meet within 24 \nhours of a choking event to discuss what occurred, determine if assessments need to be done, and \n229 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 235 of 318\nprovide timely follow-up.  Crawford Tr. 2786:17-2787:5.  Despite the fact that JR had known \ntendencies to eat too fast and stuff food into his mouth, the interdisciplinary team did not discuss \nany strategies or possible interventions to address those tendencies to attempt to reduce JR’s risk \nof choking.  Crawford Tr. 2787:12-2788:4.  This example illustrates CHDC’s staff failure to \nimplement a mealtime safety plan as written, inadequate training on the mealtime safety plan, \nand substandard remedial action.  Crawford Tr. 2789:14-2790:7. \n674.  On October 8, 2008, CHDC resident FJ experienced a choking event.  Crawford Tr. \n2790:18-20; US Ex. 1022.  The speech-language pathologist did not conduct a post-choking \nobservation of FJ for 5 days, and FJ’s interdisciplinary team waited 6 days to hold a special \nstaffing.  Crawford Tr. 2793:10-12.  On October 29, 2008, FJ’s interdisciplinary team wrote that \nFJ should receive a swallow study in the next 45 days.  Crawford Tr. 2791:8-13.  A swallow \nstudy is an important assessment tool to determine problems, which may not be clear during a \nvisual assessment, that an individual is experiencing with swallowing, chewing, potential \naspiration, or difficulty delivering food to the esophagus.  Crawford Tr. 2791:20-25-2792:2.  \nWhen prompted by a choking event, the swallow study should occur quickly—anywhere from \ntwo days to two weeks.  Crawford Tr. 2792:13-20.  By allowing 66 days before a swallow study \nwas required for FJ, CHDC violated generally accepted minimum professional standards.  \nCrawford Tr. 2792:13-20.  This incident also demonstrates substandard, untimely follow-up by \nthe speech-language pathologist and FJ’s interdisciplinary team.  Crawford Tr. 2794:10-12. \n675.  On August 16, 2009, CHDC resident HO coughed and spit up some meat and bread \nduring lunch.  Crawford Tr. 2795:20-24; US Ex. 987.  CHDC staff were supposed to position \nHO appropriately in his wheelchair during meals due to his medical diagnosis of GERD.  \n230 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 236 of 318\nCrawford Tr. 2796:3-22.  During this near choking event, however, CHDC staff had seated HO \nin a recliner while assisting HO to eat.  Crawford Tr. 2795:20-2796: 2.  After staff’s failure to \nfollow HO’s plan, CHDC should have conducted an in-service training to explain why HO is at \nrisk, why eating in the recliner is dangerous for HO, and to emphasize the importance of HO’s \nproper alignment in the wheelchair during meals.  Crawford Tr. 2797:3-17.  Generally accepted \nminimum professional standards require that such training be competency-based to allow staff to \ndemonstrate that they understand and can actually implement HO’s mealtime safety plan.  \nCrawford Tr. 2797:21-23, 2800:9-16.  Instead, CHDC merely asked HO’s staff to read and sign a \nstatement that reminded them that HO should eat while seated in his wheelchair.  Crawford Tr. \n2798:1-4; 2799:10-24.  Moreover, CHDC did not provide this substandard training timely after \nthe choking.  Crawford Tr. 2799:3-9.  CHDC did not implement this substandard training until \nfour days after the choking, and even more unacceptable, some staff did not even sign the \nstatement until almost a month after the incident.  Crawford Tr. 2798:4-9.   \n676.  HO experienced another coughing/choking event at breakfast less than a month later in \nSeptember 2009.  Crawford Tr. 2801:7-10; US Ex. 987.  Although HO had two events in a \nmonth’s time, CHDC kept HO’s choking risk level at “low.”  Crawford Tr. 2802:22-2803:6.  \nCHDC instituted no additional monitoring or different strategies after the first incident, which \ncould have prevented or minimized the second incident.  Crawford Tr. 2802:4-21. \n677.  In January 2008, CHDC resident AR died of respiratory failure following a choking \nincident.  Crawford Tr. 2803:18-2804:13; US Ex. 1023.  CHDC staff left AR in the dayroom \nunsupervised, and then found AR on the kitchen floor with her mouth full of bologna.  Crawford \nTr. 2804:1-9.  AR was prescribed a “diced diet” and had a history of filling her mouth too full, \n231 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 237 of 318\neating fast, and swallowing without chewing.  Crawford Tr. 2805:1-2806:1.  CHDC also knew of \ntwo other incidents in the past year where AR had gone into the kitchen and grabbed food.  \nCrawford Tr. 2806:4-7.  AR died because CHDC staff failed to sufficiently supervise her.  \nCrawford Tr. 2808:22-25.  Beyond the tragic death, this example shows that CHDC failed to \ntrain staff sufficiently to understand AR’s need for ongoing supervision to ensure that she did not \ntake food from the kitchen.  Crawford Tr. 2811:6-13.  Despite the serious and tragic nature of \nAR’s death, the Central Dysphagia Committee’s meeting minutes note only that AR “expired as \na result of choking.”  This quality assurance/improvement committee made no indication of any \nfurther evaluation of the incident or any discussion of systems changes, training, or monitoring \nthat CHDC could institute to avoid future deaths and serious harms.  Crawford Tr. 2808:15-\n2809:7; US Ex. 1052.  CHDC’s failure to take precautions to minimize AR’s risk of harm, and \nthe Dysphagia Committee’s inadequate reaction, mark a significant departure from minimum \nacceptable professional standards.  Crawford Tr. 2809:8-10, 2811:1-5. \n678.  To keep residents safe from risks of choking and aspiration, CHDC must adhere to \ngenerally accepted minimum professional standards, which require competency-based training, \nconsistent monitoring and review, informal spontaneous coaching, staff diligence to follow the \nmealtime safety plans, and consistency in the paperwork that outlines the risks and plan for staff.  \nCrawford Tr. 2848:23-2849:22. \nC.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Physical and Nutritional Management Results in Harm to \nCHDC Residents from Aspiration Pneumonia. \n679.  Many CHDC residents die or are hospitalized for aspiration pneumonia, respiratory \nfailure, or other pneumonia-related or respiratory-related causes.  CHDC’s substantial departure \n232 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 238 of 318\nfrom generally accepted professional standards that require CHDC to timely review pneumonia \nrelated cases, CHDC direct care staff to properly implement residents’ eating plans, CHDC to \nproperly train and monitor direct care staff, and CHDC to keep accurate, consistent \ndocumentation of residents’ safety precautions, puts residents at an increased risk of harm from \naspiration pneumonia.  See FOF ## 680-697 . \n680.  CHDC residents suffer from a significant number of pneumonia cases.  Crawford Tr. \n2819:21-2820:2.  Indeed, almost two-thirds of CHDC’s deaths are due to pneumonia or \naspiration pneumonia.  Mikkelsen Tr. 3772:10-22.  This rate is unusually high.  Mikkelsen Tr. \n3776:11-16, 3774:12-18, 3777:4-24 (comparing to Massachusetts rate of approximately 9-12% \nfor the years 2002-2007).  In a 2-year period, from approximately June 2007 through June 2009, \n17 CHDC residents died of aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, or other pneumonia-related \nor respiratory-related causes.  Crawford Tr. 2814:19-25.  Many of these residents were extremely \nyoung to die from respiratory conditions.  Crawford Tr. 2815:1-4.  By comparison, the \ncommunity providers testified that they could not remember any of their clients ever dying from \naspiration pneumonia.  Bland Tr. 883:8-17; Alberding Tr. 1396:4-7; Lambert Tr. 1871:3-8. \n681.  From June 2007 to July 2009, CHDC hospitalized 60 residents for pneumonia or \naspiration pneumonia.  Crawford Tr. 2817:14-25; US Ex. 1037. \n682.  Beyond the risk of death, CHDC residents suffering repeated episodes of pneumonia are \nat risk of harm because the repeated pneumonias compromise the residents’ ability to exchange \nair and desensitize the residents to incidents of aspiration.  Crawford Tr. 2822:2-17. \n683.  Generally accepted professional standards dictate that a facility’s dysphagia review \ncommittee should thoroughly review any instance of pneumonia to evaluate all of the other \n233 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 239 of 318\nhealth risk indicators that may be complicating the resident’s health, to determine if the facility \nshould implement strategies to either prevent or minimize the risk of future pneumonias, and to \naddress the immediate needs of a resident who is coming back from the hospital who may need \nspecial positioning, supports, or attention at mealtime.  Crawford Tr. 2820:3-19.  The facility \nshould clearly plan how professional staff and direct care staff will collaborate to ensure that the \nresident stays safe and recovers following discharge from the hospital.  Crawford Tr. 2820:12-\n24. \n684.  Contrary to these generally accepted practices, CHDC’s Central Dysphagia Committee \ndid not begin to review individual cases of pneumonia until January 2009.  Crawford Tr. 2820:3-\n8. \n685.  Even now, the Central Dysphagia Committee reviews individuals with chronic \npneumonia only once per year.  Crawford Tr. 2764:20-21, 2765:18-19.  CHDC should review \nresidents at high risk for pneumonia, or with repeated occurrences of pneumonia, frequently \nthroughout the year.  Crawford Tr. 2765:20-2766:3, 2823:11-24.  The Central Dysphagia \nCommittee does not meet frequently enough and does not meet on a timely basis following \nsignificant dysphagia events.  Crawford Tr. 2765:6-15, 2766:3-8. \n686.  CHDC fails to meet generally accepted minimum professional standards for minimizing \naspiration pneumonia risk by failing to adequately train staff to adequately implement mealtime \nsafety plans, recognize aspiration risks, and employ strategies to prevent or minimize residents’ \naspiration.  Crawford Tr. 2823:7-18; see also L. Henderson Tr. 6428:16-18 (CHDC Dysphagia \nCommittee chairwoman’s statement that CHDC nurses do not proactively monitor residents with \nrepeated pneumonia to “catch signs and symptoms before pneumonia.”) \n234 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 240 of 318\n687.  CHDC further fails to meet generally accepted minimum professional standards for \nminimizing aspiration pneumonia risk by failing to have professional staff properly monitor \nwhether treatment plans meet the residents’ needs and whether staff implement the plans \ncorrectly.  Crawford Tr. 2823:11-24. \n688.  Improper positioning puts CHDC residents at risk for gastroesophageal reflux (“GERD”), \ndifficulty swallowing, and aspiration.  Crawford Tr. 2824:16-24.  Customizing wheelchairs and \nproper positioning devices help residents by improving posture alignment, pressure management, \nbody function, comfort, bowel and bladder management, and pain reduction.  Schmeler Tr. \n3485:18-3486:18.  Defendants’ consultant agreed that proper wheelchair fit makes up a “critical \npart” of a treatment plan and proper alignment is important during and outside of meal times.  \nSchmeler Tr. 3501:2-9; L. Hancock Tr. 5277:7-16. \n689.  CHDC’s physical therapy supervisor admitted that CHDC has no policy or formal \nprocess of monitoring residents’ positioning and that the physical therapy department does not \nmonitor residents during meals.  L. Hancock Tr. 5294:15-21, 5303:25-5304:3, 5306:18-23.  The \nphysical therapy department also performs no monitoring of after-meal positioning to ensure \nproper precautions against GERD.  L. Hancock Tr. 5305:22-25.  The only monitoring the \nphysical therapists perform are informal “spot checks.”  L. Hancock Tr. 5294:9-5295:9.  In \naddition, beyond the new employee orientation training, the physical therapy department has not \nprovided any formal training on positioning in recent years.  P. Hackett Tr. 4845:23-25, 4846:8-\n4847:8. \n690.  CHDC often fails to position residents correctly.  Crawford Tr. 2825:3-17.  Ms. Crawford \nobserved staff allow improper positioning of many CHDC residents during and outside of meal \n235 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 241 of 318\ntimes.  Crawford Tr. 2825:13-17.  This improper positioning demonstrates that CHDC direct care \nstaff fail to position residents according to the residents’ positioning plans as prescribed by the \nprofessional staff.  Crawford Tr. 2952:13-2953:3. \n691.  Ms. Crawford testified to several examples of staff allowing residents to eat in dangerous \nimproper positions.  Ms. Crawford observed CHDC resident JS eating in the cafeteria.  Crawford \nTr. 2828:10.  During the entire meal, JS sat slumped way over in her wheelchair with her head \noff to the right side over the armrest.  Crawford Tr. 2828:6-12.  A CHDC staff member assisted \nJS to eat in this improper position without ever attempting to reposition JS to correct her posture \nor alignment.  Crawford Tr. 2828:19-24.  JS was hospitalized for aspiration pneumonia both \nbefore (from November 19-December 3, 2008) and after (from November 29-December 17, \n2009) Ms. Crawford observed JS’s improper positioning.  Crawford Tr. 2827:13-24; US Exs. \n1051-6 & 1051-7.  JS was also showing signs and symptoms of decline, dementia, and \nAlzheimer’s.  Crawford Tr. 2828:25-2829:2.  Because these factors put JS at risk for aspiration, \nthe staff member should have stopped the meal and repositioned JS.  Crawford Tr. 2829:1-7.   \n692.  In July 2009, Ms. Crawford also observed CHDC resident JG improperly positioned \nduring a meal.  Crawford Tr. 2829:16-19, 2830:8-12.  JG was leaning off to the side, with no \nfoot support, and her head turned and back in hyperextension throughout the meal.  Crawford Tr. \n2829:16-19, 2830:8-12.  JG’s mealtime safety plan stated that she was to be upright in her \nwheelchair for meals and identified her as being at high risk for choking and aspiration.  \nCrawford Tr. 2831:15-19.  The staff did not adjust JG’s position, did not modify his own \nposition to make eating easier for JG, and did not direct the spoon in a way that would help JG \nturn her head to be better aligned.  Crawford Tr. 2829:16-19, 2830:12-17.  JG’s example \n236 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 242 of 318\ndemonstrates CHDC’s poor staff training and lack of staff supervision.  Crawford Tr. 3831:13-\n23.   \n693.  In September 2009, Ms. Crawford observed JG again and saw that she was seated with a \nfour-to six-inch gap between her pelvis and the back of the chair.  Crawford Tr. 2829:16-18, \n2830:23-25.  Because of this gap, the wheelchair was not providing JG with adequate postural \nsupport.  Crawford Tr. 2831:3-5.  This poor positioning violates both CHDC’s guidelines and \ngenerally accepted minimum professional standards.  Crawford Tr. 2830:25-2831:3.   \n694.  Ms. Crawford also observed staff improperly position another resident, SB, in September \n2009.  Crawford Tr. 2833:6-17.  Resident SB’s mealtime safety plan states that staff should assist \nher to eat with her head “at midline,” so she does not need to turn or lift her head when eating.  \nCrawford Tr. 2832:1-23.  In July 2009, CHDC staff fed SB while standing on her right and \nholding SB’s forehead so that her head was turned to the right and pushed back into \nhyperextension, which increases SB’s risk of aspiration.  Crawford Tr. 2832:12-18.  Ms. \nCrawford observed SB make an “effortful” swallow during that meal.  Crawford Tr. 2832:7-12.  \nDuring another meal, staff provided SB with liquids that were not thickened to the proper \nconsistency outlined in SB’s mealtime safety plan.  Crawford Tr. 2833:18-2834:1.  CHDC’s \nfailure to ensure that SB is fed in the correct position and provided with liquids at the correct \nconsistency heightened SB’s risk of aspiration.  Crawford Tr. 2834:19-22.  The supervisor in \nSB’s living unit stated that any staff member working with a resident should have read the \nresident’s mealtime safety plan and signed the training record to confirm such review prior to \nassisting the resident with meals.  Crawford Tr. 2834:2-6.  The staff member who was assisting \nSB was not listed on SB’s training sheet, and no other evidence indicated that the staff had read \n237 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 243 of 318\nor received any training regarding SB’s mealtime safety plan.  Crawford Tr. 2834:7-11.  This \nexample demonstrates that CHDC fails to meet generally accepted minimum professional \nstandards because staff are not following the residents’ mealtime safety plans and that the lack of \ncompetency-based training regarding the mealtime safety plans is placing residents at risk of \nharm.  Crawford Tr. 2834:14-2835:8. \n695.  In addition to SB, staff put other CHDC residents at risk for choking and aspiration by \nfailing to properly thicken liquids according to residents’ eating safety plan.  For example, Ms. \nCrawford witnessed CHDC classroom staff preparing a beverage at the wrong consistency for \nresident BC.  Crawford Tr. 2837:19-2838:4.  Although the staff member thickened BC’s \nbeverage to only “nectar” thick, instead of “pudding” thick as BC’s mealtime safety plan \nrequired, no other CHDC staff intervened.  Crawford Tr. 2838:3-6.  Because nectar thick liquids \nare dangerous for BC, Ms. Crawford intervened by asking the staff about the correct consistency; \nthe staff needed to consult the mealtime safety plan to learn that BC required a pudding thick \nconsistency.  Crawford Tr. 2838:8-13.  Even then, the staff still was unable to thicken BC’s \nbeverage correctly.  Crawford Tr. 2838:12-22.  Ms. Crawford also observed CHDC resident VW \ndrinking “thin” liquids even though VW was prescribed “honey” thick liquids, presented a high \nrisk for choking, and had already experienced two choking events that year.  Crawford Tr. \n2843:14-21.  These examples further demonstrate that CHDC fails to meet generally accepted \nminimum professional standards because the lack of competency-based training, poor \nsupervision, and insufficient monitoring of staff implementation of mealtime safety plans result \nin CHDC staff who do not or cannot follow the residents’ mealtime safety plans, which places \nresidents at risk of harm.  Crawford Tr. 2839:17-2840:18, 2843:22-2844:4. \n238 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 244 of 318\n696.  In another example of staff not adhering to mealtime safety plans, Ms. Crawford \nobserved resident DL quickly eating his breakfast in just seven minutes.  Crawford Tr. 2845:19-\n2846:1.  Although CHDC has identified DL as at “high risk” for choking and DL’s mealtime \nsafety plan specifically stated that he should eat at a slow pace, take small bites, and receive \nencouragement to alternate each bit of food with fluids, no CHDC staff intervened to redirect \nhim or encourage a slower pace.  Crawford Tr. 2846:1-6.  This example demonstrates CHDC’s \ndeparture from generally accepted minimum professional standards and the resulting higher risk \nof a dangerous choking or aspiration event for DL.  Staff should have intervened to properly \nimplement DL’s mealtime safety plan and prevent a high risk resident from eating too fast.  \nCrawford Tr. 2846:12-22. \n697.  CHDC also puts residents at risk of harm by inconsistently documenting residents’ eating \nsafety precautions.  Multiple discrepancies existed between residents’ QRGs and their eating \nplans, both of which should provide consistent information to staff on a resident’s eating \nprecautions.  Crawford Tr. 2780:2, 2781:1-9, 2844:5-21.  These discrepancies result in risk of \nharm to residents from staff confusion and incorrect plan implementation.  Crawford Tr. 2781:5-\n9.  Generally accepted minimum professional standards require that CHDC use consistent and \naccurate documentation.  Crawford Tr. 2847:7-9. \nD.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Physical and Nutritional Management Results in Harm to \nCHDC Residents from Fractures. \n698.  CHDC residents identified as at greater risks for bone fractures still suffer an alarming \nnumber of fractures, with many suffering multiple fractures.   CHDC’s substantial departure \nfrom generally accepted professional standards requiring that staff give heightened attention to \n239 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 245 of 318\n“high risk” residents, that CHDC provide accurate, consistent fracture risk information to staff \ncaring for the residents, and that CHDC provide staff with in-depth and comprehensive training \nresults in fractures, and an increased risk of fractures.  See FOF ## 699-706.    \n699.  Many CHDC residents are at an increased risk for bone fractures due to osteoporosis or \nosteopenia, balance problems, or issues with aggressive behavior.  Crawford Tr. 2851:22-2852:6. \n700.  CHDC identified approximately 373 residents as being at “greater risk” for fractures, \ndesignating 191 of those residents at “high risk” and the remaining residents as “increased risk” \nfor fractures.  Crawford Tr. 2852:23-2853:21; US Ex. 953-1.  CHDC residents identified as \ngreater risks still suffer an alarming number of fractures.   \n701.  From June 2007 through September 2009, 24 CHDC residents identified as at “increased \nrisk” for fractures suffered 31 fractured bones.  Crawford Tr. 2855:24-2856:2; US Ex. 997.  Five \nof those individuals suffered multiple fractures during that time.  Crawford Tr. 2855:13-19.   \n702.  Although resident HCT had experienced 17 fractures since March 1993, including 4 from \nJune 2007 through September 2009, CHDC designated her only as being at “increased risk” for \nfractures, rather than “high risk.”  Crawford Tr. 2858:19-2859:20. \n703.  From June 2007 through September 2009, 20 CHDC residents identified as at “high risk” \nfor  fractures experienced 24 fractures, including at least 2 residents with multiple fractures.  \nCrawford Tr. 2860:9-15.  Staff should have a heightened awareness of individuals who have \nbeen designated as being at “high risk” for fractures and should pay particular attention to protect \nthose individuals from risk of injury due to fractures.  Crawford Tr. 2861:1-8. \n704.  From June 2007 through September 2009, 20 CHDC residents who use wheelchairs as \ntheir primary form of mobility experienced fractures.  Crawford Tr. 2863:2-7.  During the same \n240 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 246 of 318\ntime, 13 CHDC residents who use wheelchairs for longer distance transport suffered fractures.  \nCrawford Tr. 2863:8-9.  These residents with limited mobility depend on CHDC staff and \nrequire staff attention and assistance for tasks such as bathing and transferring to and from bed.  \nCrawford Tr. 2863:11-25. \n705.  CHDC fails to provide accurate, consistent fracture risk information to staff.  To provide \nsafe care, generally accepted minimum professional standards require that CHDC provide staff \nwith correct information about the accurate risk levels assigned to each resident.  Crawford Tr. \n2864:1-10.  When comparing the QRGs with the “greater risk” for fractures list, Ms. Crawford \nfound that 88 residents who were identified as being at “increased” or “high” risk for fractures \nhad no fracture risk included in their QRGs, and an additional 39 residents had inconsistencies \nbetween the QRG and the fracture list.  Crawford Tr. 2865:11-21.  Tellingly, despite resident \nHCT’s serious history of 17 fractures, HTC’s QRG contained no information regarding fracture \nrisk.  Crawford Tr. 2865:22-25. \n706.  On October 25, 2007, CHDC resident KB was screaming and crying when CHDC staff \nmoved her and provided her personal care, and KB had been fussy for several days.  Crawford \nTr. 2867:13-20; US Ex. 21-3.  Despite an x-ray revealing KB suffered pain from a fractured \nfemur, the CHDC doctor did not treat the femur fracture as a medical emergency.  CHDC merely \nadmitted KB to the infirmary and scheduled a surgery for nearly a month later, on November 19, \n2007.  Crawford Tr. 2867:23-2868:5.  Although KB had been “hollering continuously and \ncrying,” none of the six staff who worked with her observed any injury to KB.  Crawford Tr. \n2868:6-14.  CHDC found that the exact cause of the injury could not be determined.  Crawford \nTr. 2868:18-21.  Despite the seriousness of KB’s fractured femur, CHDC’s response was only to \n241 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 247 of 318\nprovide 14 CHDC staff members with a 5-minute in-service training on careful handling of \nresidents when providing personal care, bathing, lifting, or positioning.  Crawford Tr. 2868:15-\n2869:8.  Generally accepted minimum professional standards require a much more in-depth and \ncomprehensive training to adequately address the risks to KB and proper techniques for avoiding \nfuture injuries.  Crawford Tr. 2869:9-2870:20. \nE.  CHDC’s Substantial Departure from Generally Accepted Professional \nStandards of Physical and Nutritional Management Results in Harm to \nCHDC Residents from Pressure Ulcers. \n707.  CHDC residents suffer from an unacceptably high rate of skin pressure ulcers/sores.  \nCHDC’s substantial departure from generally accepted professional standards requiring that \ndirect care staff reposition residents in adherence with residents’ prescribed positioning plans, \nthat staff accurately document implementation of the positioning plans, and that CHDC \nprofessional staff adequately monitor and properly train direct care staff to implement the plans \ncorrectly, causes CHDC residents to suffer harm, and increased risk of harm, from pressures \nsores.  See FOF ## 708-713. \n708.  Approximately 200 CHDC residents are at a high risk for pressure ulcers because of their \ndiminished mobility and reliance on staff for repositioning.  Crawford Tr. 2876:16-2877:8, \n2878:15-18.  Forty-six CHDC residents suffered 77 incidents of pressure sores from June 2007 \nthrough September 2009.  Crawford Tr. 2874:23-2875:2; US Ex. 998.  This rate is high \ncompared to other similar facilities.  Crawford Tr. 2875:17-19.  Even a 14-18% rate of pressure \nsores is considered high by professional associations.  Schmeler Tr. 3490:10-3491:3.  \nDefendants’ consultant testified that a facility should be expected to take steps to reduce such a \nhigh rate.  Schmeler Tr. 3491:2-4. \n242 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 248 of 318\n709.  Seventeen CHDC residents had multiple episodes of pressure ulcers during this same \ntwo-year period, each of whom were considered to be non-ambulatory and were seated in a \nwheelchair for their primary means of mobility.  Crawford Tr. 2878:4-14.   \n710.  CHDC staff fail to properly reposition residents to prevent pressure sores.  Generally \naccepted minimum professional standards require staff to reposition non-ambulatory individuals \nwho are dependent upon others for positioning at least every two hours for adequate pressure \nrelief.  Crawford Tr. 2880:5-12; Schmeler Tr. 3510:10-14.  Most CHDC individual positioning \nplans contain identical recommendation for 2 to 3 periods of scheduled positioning per day of 30 \nto 45 minutes.  Crawford Tr. 2884:2-11.  The CHDC logs that document individuals’ \npositioning, however, revealed that CHDC staff fail to reposition many residents in adherence to \nthe residents’ positioning plans and CHDC direct care staff are not implementing the positioning \nplans as written.  Crawford Tr. 2886:19-2887:17.  In addition, although residents’ needs are not \nconfined to weekdays, CHDC staff do not implement the positioning plans on the weekends.  \nCrawford Tr. 2887:4-10.  Defendants’ consultant testified that a staff’s failure to comply with \nrepositioning plans would constitute a violation of generally accepted minimum professional \nstandards.  Schmeler Tr. 3510:21-3511:5. \n711.  For example, even though resident DB’s positioning plan states that she should be in her \nwheelchair for extended periods of time throughout the day and have 2 to 3 periods of scheduled \npositioning per day of 30 to 45 minutes, the log indicated that she was in her wheelchair only 15 \ntimes during a 3 month period.  Crawford Tr. 2891:7-15; US Ex. 994.  DB suffered from \npressure sores in October 2008 and July, August, and September 2009.  Crawford Tr. 2891:24-\n2892:15.  At least six other residents on DB’s unit suffered similar harms from pressure sores.  \n243 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 249 of 318\nCrawford Tr. 2893:10-18.  A CHDC staff member in that unit admitted that staff only position \nthe residents in their wheelchairs when the resident is going to class.   Crawford Tr. 2894:8-14.  \nTo remedy this deficiency, generally accepted minimum professional standards require that \nCHDC properly train staff to ensure that they can implement the plans correctly and that CHDC \nadequate monitor staff so that errors can be caught and corrected.  Crawford Tr. 2894:16-22. \n712.  In another case reviewed by Defendants’ own consultant, discrepancies existed between \ntherapy staff recommendations and the individual’s actual treatment plan and treatment logs.  \nSchmeler Tr. 3498:22-25.  For instance, the therapy staff’s annual report noted treatment \nrecommendations that did not appear in the resident's positioning plan.   Schmeler Tr. 3499:3-7.  \nDefendants’ consultant opined that such inconsistencies would be a substantial departure from \ngenerally accepted minimum professional standards.  Schmeler Tr. 3499:8-11. \n713.  Generally accepted minimum professional standards require accurate documentation to \ndemonstrate that staff are implementing the residents’ positioning plans.  Crawford Tr. 2896:5-8.  \nThe CHDC physical therapy supervisor, however, confirmed that the CHDC physical therapists \ndo not review any of the positioning documentation logs to confirm that staff are implementing \nthe residents’ individual positioning plans.  Crawford Tr. 2894:22-24.  The physical therapy \nsupervisor testified that no one at CHDC specifically confirms that each staff member is trained \non the positioning plans of the residents with whom they work.  L. Hancock Tr. 5299:10-13.   \nXIII.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW – PHYSICAL AND NUTRITIONAL \nMANAGEMENT  \nDefendants violate the Constitution with substandard physical and nutritional \nmanagement services that subject residents to preventable harm from choking, aspiration \n244 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 250 of 318\npneumonia, bone fractures, and skin pressure sores.  The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees \nCHDC residents the right to therapeutic services, to help maintain or improve functions and to \nprevent harm from serious medical conditions.  See Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 315, 324 (holding an \ninstitutionalized person has a constitutionally protected right to reasonable safety, rehabilitation, \nand adequate medical care).  Defendants violate CHDC residents’ right to adequate physical and \nnutritional management services if CHDC’s administration of these services “substantial[ly] \ndepart[s] from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards.”  Id. at 322-23.  CHDC \nmust provide physical and nutritional management services by qualified and trained staff, both at \na professional and direct care level.  See id. at 323 n.30 (finding, even for day-to-day matters, \nthat untrained staff should be supervised by a qualified professional). \nMany CHDC residents have, or are at risk of developing, conditions such as airway \nobstructions, pneumonia, bone fractures, skin pressure sores, and other infections.  CHDC’s \nunlawful physical and nutrition management practices substantially depart from generally \naccepted minimum professional standards that require:  (1) direct care staff to properly \nimplement the residents’ physical and nutritional management plans; (2) professional staff to \nmonitor direct care staff implementation and effectiveness of the plans; (3) adequate, \ncompetency-based training; and (4) complete and timely responses to incidents.  These \nsubstantial departures put CHDC residents at an unconstitutional risk of choking, aspiration \npneumonia, bone fractures, and pressure sores.      \n245 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 251 of 318\nTABLE OF CONTENTS - SPECIAL EDUCATION \nXIV.

FINDINGS OF FACT – SPECIAL EDUCATION \n714.  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., \nrequires that every child with disabilities is provided a free appropriate public education \n(“FAPE”).  To meet this obligation, the state must offer students special education and related \nservices designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, \nemployment, and independent living.1  20 U.S.C. § 1400(d); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.1, 300.17.     \n715.  IDEA was enacted because “[a]lmost 30 years of research and experience ha[d] \ndemonstrated that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by \nhaving high expectations for such children and ensuring their access to the general education \ncurriculum in the regular classroom, to the maximum extent possible.”  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1400(c)(5)(A). \n716.    CHDC’s procedural and substantive violations of the IDEA deprive CHDC students of \nFAPE, as guaranteed by the IDEA.  CHDC’s violations result in:  (1) students’ continued \nisolation in the most restrictive educational environment, with unlawfully reduced instructional \ntime; (2) cookie cutter individualized education programs (“IEPs”), that are not supported by \nadequate educational assessments and are not adequate to address students’ academic and \nfunctional needs; (3) denial of access to communication and audiology services, \npsychological/behavioral services, and other related services students need to access and benefit \n                                                 \n  1Arkansas receives federal funding under Part B of the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., \nand thus is subject to the requirements of the IDEA and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. \npt. 300.  Defs. Reply to Plaintiff’s Proposed Findings of Fact at 1 (declining to contest the United \nStates’ Proposed Finding of Fact ¶ 173); Defs. Reply to Plaintiff’s Statement of Undisputed \nFacts, ¶  67 [Dkt. 104].  Even if any of the Defendants in this case did not receive federal funds, \nArkansas special education regulations apply to any public agency that provides special \neducation and related services to children with disabilities, regardless of whether that agency is \nreceiving funds under Part B of the IDEA.  Ark. Admin. Code § 1.02.2.2. \n \n248 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 254 of 318\nfrom educational services; (4) denial of access to adequate transition planning and services that \nwould allow students to transition from post-secondary education to adult life; (5) exclusion of \nparties necessary at IEP meetings to ensure access to the general education curricula and the least \nrestrictive educational setting; and (6) denial of access to statewide and districtwide assessments \nrequired for students to benefit from statewide academic content and achievement standards.   \n717.  The United States’ educational expert found these deficiencies, and, at the same time, the \nArkansas Department of Education (“ADE”) found IDEA non-compliance at CHDC.  As the \nState’s own investigators found violations in line with the United States’ special education \nexpert’s findings, there is an independent basis for a finding of IDEA violations.  20 U.S.C.        \n§ 1401(9)(B). \nA.  Expert Susan Thibadeau Provided Credible Expert Testimony That CHDC’s \nEducation Program Violates Numerous IDEA Requirements.  \n718.  Dr. Susan Thibadeau, the United States’ special education expert, found numerous \nprocedural and substantive IDEA violations, many of which ADE subsequently confirmed in its \nJanuary 2010 on-site evaluation.  Even the Defendants’ special education consultants, Derek Nye \nand Dr. Bruce Gale, found deficiencies in some of the same areas where Dr. Thibadeau and ADE \nfound IDEA violations.  Gale Tr. 5748:19-5749:1, 5755:20-5756:10; Nye Tr. 5137:17-5138:20. \n719.  Dr. Susan Thibadeau is qualified as an expert witness in special education and \npsychological/behavioral services.  She has a Ph.D. in developmental and child psychology and a \nmaster’s degree in special education.  She is a licensed psychologist in the State of Maine and \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts.  She is a certified special education teacher in the \n249 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 255 of 318\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts and a board certified doctoral level behavior analyst.2  \nThibadeau Tr. 2171:1-19.   \n720.  Dr. Thibadeau also has extensive experience educating children with developmental \ndisabilities, including working as a psychologist, educator, and director of research and training \nat a state institution in Massachusetts for adults and children with disabilities; teaching children \nwith significant disabilities; serving as director of community services and ultimately as program \ndirector in a non-profit program; teaching high school students with behavior disorders; \nproviding educational consulting services to public schools; and teaching undergraduate- and \ngraduate-level courses in special education and psychology.  Thibadeau Tr. 2171:20-2173:8; US \nEx. 1101-1. \n721.  Dr. Thibadeau has broad experience evaluating educational services, including \ncompleting assessments of entire school programs, and providing technical assistance regarding \nindividual students’ functional behavior assessments and behavior support plans.  Thibadeau Tr. \n2173:9-2174:2.   \n722.  Dr. Thibadeau served as an expert witness for educational services in an institutional \nconditions case in federal court in Tennessee and currently serves on the monitoring team for a \nconsent decree involving state institutions for individuals with developmental disabilities in \nTexas.  Thibadeau Tr. 2173:24-2174:10.   \n723.  Dr. Thibadeau’s review of educational services at CHDC included on-site inspections in \nJuly and September 2009.  Thibadeau Tr. 2183:22-2185:10.  Dr. Thibadeau participated in a tour \nof the facility, including resident living units and day activity areas.  She also conducted between \nsix and nine classroom observations in each of the five CHDC classrooms, as well as \n                                                 \n2   Defendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, has no formal training about the \nIDEA.  Nye Tr. 5171:18-20. \n250 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 256 of 318\nobservations of several habilitation training classes and the sheltered workshop.  Thibadeau Tr. \n2183:22-2185:24.   \n724.  Dr. Thibadeau reviewed education-related documents for each of the 45 students who \nwere then admitted as residents of CHDC (as opposing to being placed at CHDC on respite \nstatus).  Among the documents were IEPs,3 individual program plans (“IPPs”), behavior support \nplans, strategies for improving behavior, and safety plans.  Thibadeau Tr. 2185:25-2186:9, \n2171:1-11.  She also interviewed four of the six CHDC classroom teachers, the special education \ndirector, and the two teaching supervisors; participated in interviews of the lead psychological \nexaminer, a second psychological examiner, the psychiatrist, and the director of nursing; and \nattended the depositions of teachers Susan Milum and Throndia Smith and special education \ndirector Tamara Hill.  Thibadeau Tr. 2171:1-11, 2184:15-2185:10. \nB.  Arkansas’s State Educational Agency Issued Numerous Findings of IDEA \nNon-Compliance at CHDC for This Monitoring Period. \n725.  Under the IDEA, FAPE is not provided unless students’ special education and related \nservices “meet the standards of the State educational agency.” 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9)(B).  Arkansas \nstandards for the provision of special education and related services incorporate federal IDEA \nimplementing regulations, as set forth in 34 C.F.R. § 300 et seq., and any additional requirements \nimposed by the State Educational Agency (“SEA”) or state law.  See generally Ark. Admin. \nCode § 005.18.2.   \n726.  ADE is the SEA “responsible for ensuring that the requirements of this subchapter are \nmet.”  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(11)(A)(i); Ark. Admin. Code § 005.18.2-2.03;  Harding Tr. 3000:7-\n                                                 \n3   An IEP is the required written statement for each child with a disability that sets \nforth the comprehensive educational services that are to be provided to the student annually, \nincluding special education services, related services, and transition services.  20 U.S.C. § \n1401(14), 1414(d).      \n251 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 257 of 318\n11; Defs. Reply to Plaintiff’s Proposed Findings of Fact at 1 (declining to contest the United \nStates’ Proposed Finding of Fact ¶ 174).   \n727.  ADE recently cited CHDC for failing to provide students with FAPE in accordance with \nthe IDEA, based on 15 enumerated areas of non-compliance.  Thibadeau Tr. 2203:11-2204:21; \nHarding Tr. 2988:7-2989:5, 3006:23-3007:6, 3008:20-24; US Ex. 1104.  ADE’s findings are \nlargely consistent with Dr. Thibadeau’s findings.4  Thibadeau Tr. 2204:7-21. \n728.  On June 16, 2010, ADE sent CHDC a letter reporting the results of ADE’s January 2010 \nofficial site monitoring visit assessing CHDC’s compliance with federal and state special \neducation laws and regulations (“ADE report”).  This letter detailed 15 areas where CHDC failed \nto comply with state and federal law and regulations.  Thibadeau Tr. 2203:11-2204:21; Harding \nTr. 2988:7-2989:5, 3006:23-3007:6, 3008:20-24; US Ex. 1104.   \n729.  ADE employed a method of review similar to that used by Dr. Thibadeau:  review of a \nsample of student records, interviews with CHDC staff, and classroom observations.   Harding \nTr. 2989:23-2990:4, 3026:19-3032:12. \n730.  ADE issued four findings of non-compliance regarding CHDC’s IEPs, including:  \n(1) CHDC fails to consider special factors impeding students’ learning when developing student \nIEPs; (2) IEP components do not address the unique needs of individual students; (3) CHDC \ntransition plans are not based on age appropriate transition assessments and do not describe \nappropriate measurable post-secondary goals; and (4) CHDC does not inform parents of student \nprogress toward meeting annual goals and short term objectives on a quarterly basis.  Harding \nTr. 3000:3-3006:22; US Ex. 1104.       \n                                                 \n4   ADE’s report addressed substantially the same topics as Dr. Thibadeau’s Rule 26 \nreport in this case.  Thibadeau Tr. 2211:7-22. \n252 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 258 of 318\n731.  ADE also found that CHDC meets neither teacher/pupil ratios nor IDEA-required \ndeadlines for completing comprehensive disability evaluations, reevaluations, written reports, \nand student eligibility conferences.  Harding Tr. 2995:4-24, 2998:16-3000:2, 3008:25-3010:20; \nUS Ex. 1104.  \n732.  ADE found that CHDC educational services fail to address all of students’ identified \nspecial education and related services needs.  Harding Tr. 3000:3-19, 3007:7-3008:19; US Ex. \n1104. \n733.  Participation of outside agencies is essential to facilitate students’ transition to \nappropriate postsecondary settings.  Thibadeau Tr. 2299:20-2300:21.  ADE found that CHDC \nwas not inviting outside agencies to participate in CHDC IEP meetings about transition services, \nin violation of the IDEA.  Harding Tr. 2990:22-2991:12; US Exs. 1104 & 1201.  Moreover, even \nwhen appropriate agencies were identified, they were unable to participate in the IEP meetings \nbecause CHDC failed to notify parents and request parental consent for their participation, as \nrequired by the IDEA.   Thibadeau Tr. 2181:22-2182:13, 2300:22-2301:19; US Exs. 1104 & \n1201. \n734.  ADE cited CHDC for failing to provide clinical justification for the shortened school \ndays provided to all CHDC students.  Harding Tr. 3011:23-3013:10; US Ex. 1104. \n735.  ADE also cited CHDC for inadequate teacher training, including insufficient evidence of \nthe use of promising educational practices in special education instruction.  Harding Tr. 3015:17-\n3018:25; US Ex. 1104. \nC.  CHDC IEP Teams Do Not Include All Members Required by the IDEA. \n736.  The IDEA requires that certain categories of educational staff participate in IEP team \nmeetings.  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B).  CHDC fails to include all of the IDEA-required team \n253 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 259 of 318\nmembers in its IEP meetings.  CHDC routinely fails to ensure that representatives from the local \neducation agency (“LEA”) and regular education teachers from the students’ home schools \nparticipate in IEP meetings.  Thibadeau Tr. 2213:2-2214:15, 2217:11-16, 2220:16-2221:13; Gale \nTr. 5748:19-5749:1; US Ex. 1105; Defs. Response to Plaintiff’s Statement of Undisputed Facts \n¶ 69 [Dkt. 104]. \n737.  IEP teams must determine the least restrictive environment appropriate for students in \norder to maximize their opportunities to interact with their non-disabled peers.  A representative \nfrom the LEA needs to attend CHDC IEP team meetings so that the team can adequately discuss \npossible less restrictive alternatives with representatives of students’ home school districts.5  \nThibadeau Tr. 2213:5-2214:9.   \n738.  Where a less restrictive alternative is appropriate and a student could attend classes with \nhis non-disabled peers at his home school, a regular education teacher must also participate in the \nIEP meeting.  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B); Thibadeau Tr. 2417:14-24; US Ex. 1105.     \n739.  Defendants’ special education consultant Dr. Bruce Gale characterized the lack of LEA \nparticipation at CHDC IEP meetings as “an enormous problem.” Gale Tr. 5748:19-5749:1. \n740.  CHDC education documents provide no indication that parents or guardians have \nconsented to the absence of LEA representatives or regular education teachers, which is required \nby the IDEA for absent team members, as well as prior written input into the development of the \nIEP prior to the meeting.  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(C); Thibadeau Tr. 2220:6-15. \n                                                 \n5   Although CHDC IEPs sometimes list a CHDC staff employee as the LEA \nrepresentative, see Thibadeau Tr. 2219:13-2220:5; US Exs. 1107, 1108, 1201, a CHDC \nemployee cannot fulfill this function, as CHDC is not a school district and, in any event, the staff \nperson does not fulfill the statutory requirements of an LEA representative.  See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1414(d)(1)(B). \n254 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 260 of 318\nD.  CHDC’s Special Education Instructional Time Is Inadequate. \n741.  CHDC is the most restrictive type of educational environment along the IDEA’s \ncontinuum of placements, as it affords CHDC students no regular interaction with their non-\ndisabled peers.  Thibadeau Tr. 2176:10-25. \n742.  CHDC students have significant academic and functional skill needs, including needs for \ndevelopment of communication, socialization, self-care, domestic, and leisure skills.  Thibadeau \nTr. 2177:16-2178:2.  Instructional time must be adequate to meet students’ academic and \nfunctional needs.  Thibadeau Tr. 2176:10-2178:2. \n743.  All CHDC students receive a shortened school day and spend an inadequate amount of \ntime in special education classes. Thibadeau Tr. 2176:10-25, 2205:3-2206:9; US Exs. 1201 & \n1208.  No CHDC student attends school for a full day.  More specifically, 65% of the 45 CHDC \nstudents reviewed by Dr. Thibadeau have spent only 450 minutes per week, or 1.5 hours per day, \nin special education classes, even though the school day is supposed to last from 9 am until 3:30 \npm, or approximately 6.5 hours, as in a typical school.  Thibadeau Tr. 2186:23-2187:21, 2194:6-\n2196:10.  This is entirely inadequate to satisfy CHDC students’ significant academic and \nfunctional skill needs and facilitate their transition to a less restrictive educational placement.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2176:10-25.  \n744.  The United States’ special education expert’s document review revealed that the \nmaximum amount of special education instruction provided by CHDC for a student is 2.5 hours \nper day – and only 1 student spent even this length of time in school.  Thibadeau Tr. 2188:11-21; \nUS Ex. 1102.   \n745.  ADE’s findings regarding the time CHDC students spend in special education were \nconsistent with Dr. Thibadeau’s findings.  Thibadeau Tr. 2210:3-13; US Exs. 1209 & 1210.   \n255 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 261 of 318\n746.  Defendants have admitted that CHDC school-aged youth spend no more than half of their \nschool day in a classroom with special education certified teachers.  Thibadeau Tr. 2221:14-22; \nUS Ex. 1105 at 4. \n747.  CHDC’s special education coordinator, who is not certified in special education, \nseparately admitted to Defendants’ special education consultant that she pre-determines that new \nschool-aged admissions to CHDC do not need (and will not receive) a full-time education \nprogram.  Nye Tr. at 5146:6-5147:9, 5189:16-5193:4; US Ex. DN-1.   \n748.  Even when CHDC attempted in summer 2010 to increase the number of minutes some \nstudents spend in special education classes, CHDC did not increase the number or complexity of \nIEP objectives; accordingly, the special education instruction CHDC provides remains \ninadequate.  Thibadeau Tr. 2194:6-2195:19; US Ex. 2026 at US-CON-E-0031312-414 (IEPs of \nCW, SW, JB, WR, JM, CT, NS, and BR, as modified in summer 2010).   \n749.  Contrary to the practice at CHDC, children with disabilities generally should attend \nclasses for just as long as their peers without disabilities.  Thibadeau Tr. 2195:20-2196:23.  \nSpecial education teachers commonly use strategies to help students attend to tasks and address \nbehaviors so they can learn in the classroom.  Thibadeau Tr. 2196:24-2197:17.  Indeed, the \nIDEA requires that “in the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child’s learning and that \nof others, [the IEP team] consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and \nother strategies, to address that behavior.” 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(i).   \n750.  Shortening students’ school days for supervision, personal care, or behavioral needs is \ninappropriate because these needs call for a more intensive special education services, not a \nshorter school day.  Thibadeau Tr. 2198:17-2199:1.  Shortening class time to address students’ \n256 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 262 of 318\ninappropriate behaviors or problems with focusing on tasks also violates the IDEA.  Thibadeau \nTr. 2195:20-2197:17, 2200:8-2201:5, 2206:10-24. \n751.  ADE also found that CHDC students were not attending class for a full day, and CHDC \nIEPs did not adequately substantiate why students had these shortened school days.  Thibadeau \nTr. 2205:3-2206:24, 2349:8-2350:6; Harding Tr. 3011:163-3013:10; US Exs. 1104, 1201, 1208 \n& 1216.    \n752.  ADE also found IDEA violations based on the absence of documentation of periodic \nevaluations to measure progress and failure to implement behavior support plans to increase \nstudents’ time in the educational setting.  Thibadeau Tr. 2279:9-19; US Ex. 1214.  Further, ADE \nfound that students whose reduced school schedules were reportedly a consequence of their \nbeing unable to focus for long periods of time nonetheless had full day schedules of activities, \nsuggesting that the reported reason for shortened school days was not valid.  Thibadeau Tr. \n2279:20-2280:21. \n753.  In their prior public school placements, CHDC students attended special education \nclasses for exponentially more time than they attend special education classes at CHDC.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2210:15-2211:6; US Exs. 1102, 1103-1 through 1103-9 & 1214.   \n754.  ADE also noted that students such as JB had a much more intensive schedule in prior \nplacements.  For example, JB went from attending 1800 minutes of instruction in social skills, \nself-help, language arts, functional reading and math each week at his prior placement to 450 \nminutes of special education every week at CHDC.  Thibadeau Tr. 2346:8-16; US Ex. 1216. \n755.  CHDC schedules students for an hour and a half of lunch, leisure, and personal \ngrooming, but does not include active programming for the development of communication or \nleisure skills in students’ schedules.  This deficiency is significant because many CHDC students \n257 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 263 of 318\nhave limited communication and social interaction skills, which are not being adequately \ndeveloped during the limited classroom time or outside the classroom at CHDC.  Thibadeau Tr. \n2188:21-2191:15.   \n756.  CHDC educators do not adequately generalize skills so students can apply them outside \nthe classroom setting, as demonstrated by the common method of teaching money management \nthrough fake coins and not applying money management in real-world situations, such as at the \ncanteen.  Thibadeau Tr. 2191:16-2192:24. \n757.  The amount of time CHDC students spend in transition from special education classes to \nother activities also reduces CHDC students’ limited time in class, as it results in students \narriving late or leaving early.  Thibadeau Tr. 2197:19-2198:16, 2413:22-2414:5.  ADE also \nobserved discrepancies between the limited time scheduled for special education classes and the \neven smaller amount of time CHDC students actually spend in class.  Thibadeau Tr. 2211:23-\n2212:21; US Ex. 1214. \n758.  CHDC students spend a significant amount of their day in habilitation classes taught by \ninstructors who have no special education certification or any teaching certification.  Thibadeau \nTr. 2221:23-2222:6; Smith Tr. 2155:3-8; Buck Tr. 6536:17-19; Price 1660:23-1661:4; US Ex. \n1105 at 4.  These habilitation instructors are not supervised by special education certified \nteachers, as they should be if they are to be providing special education instruction.  Thibadeau \nTr. 2192:25-2193:2194:5; Nye Tr. 5177:8-5178:2 (habilitation classes are not part of CHDC’s \nspecial education program).   \n759.  CHDC school-aged students may attend habilitation classes during the school day with \nadults, Smith Tr. 2156:1-3, which is not a normalizing experience for these students.  \n258 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 264 of 318\nDefendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, found that a typical ratio of school-aged \nstudents to adults in CHDC habilitation classes is 1 student to 5 adults.  Nye Tr. 5176:23-5177:7.   \n760.  Relying on non-special education certified individuals to teach habilitation skills deprives \nCHDC students of the benefits of special education instruction.  Teaching students who require \nspecial education instruction requires specific skills, such as the ability to break tasks into small \nsteps, shape skills, chain activities together to form a more complex skill, use prompting \nstrategies (and planning for the effective fading of those prompting strategies), and identify and \napply reinforcers.  Thibadeau Tr. 2192:25-2194:5. \n761.  The IDEA requires that students with disabilities continue to receive FAPE even when \nthey are suspended or placed in an interim setting, where that removal is for longer than ten days.  \n20 U.S.C. § 1415(k).  CHDC, however, further shortens students’ instructional time by \nrestricting students to their residences as punishment for behavior problems, without input from \nthe education program.  Thibadeau Tr. 2199:2-8; Milum Tr. 2122:17-2123:4.  \n762.  CHDC employs a Special Treatment Unit Levels of Reinforcement System, which \ninappropriately conditions attendance in school on students’ behavior by including “going to \nclass” on the Menu of Reinforcers.  This program withholds education from students, including \nin situations where there is no current concern that a student’s behavior would place himself or \nothers at risk of harm.  Thibadeau Tr. 2199:9-2200:7, 2353:6-2354:7 (system continues in 2010 \nIEPs); US Ex. 2026 at US-CON-E-0031249, US-CON-E-0031265 (examples of ongoing use in \nstudents’ IEPs).  Even Defendants’ psychology consultant is concerned with this program.  \nWalsh Tr. 6111:6-13. \n763.  Defendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, testified that it will take a long \ntime for CHDC to hire sufficient numbers of certified staff to provide students with an \n259 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 265 of 318\nappropriate amount of special education instructional time in classes that meet ADE-required \nteacher to student ratios.  Nye Tr. 5167:23-5168:20. \nE.  CHDC IEP Goals and Objectives Fail To Meet IDEA Requirements. \n764.  The IDEA prescribes specific requirements for IEP goals and objectives, including the \nrequirement that they address both academic and functional areas impacted by a student’s \ndisability.  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d).  Students with significant needs should receive training in \nacademic, communication, social, self-care, leisure, vocational, domestic, and community skills.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2177:16-2178:2, 2222:12-2223:5, 2415:21-2416:12.   \n765.  CHDC students’ IEP annual goals and short-term objectives do not provide for \ncomprehensive education to meet the full range of student needs; rather, CHDC student IEPs \nfocus solely on academic skills and exclude functional skills such as communication, social, self-\ncare, leisure, vocational, domestic, and community skills.6  Thibadeau Tr. 2177:16-2178:2; US \nExs. 1109 through 1114 (examples of illustrative inadequate IEP goals and objectives for CHDC \nstudents SA, TF, BH, JM, TS, CT).  \n766.  ADE also criticized CHDC for limiting its IEP development to academic goals.  Harding \nTr. 3022:3-22; US Ex. 1186. \n767.  CHDC IEPs also contain insufficient numbers of goals and objectives.  Though each IEP \nmust include goals “designed to (aa) meet the child’s needs that result from the child’s disability \nto enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum; and \n(bb) meet each of the child’s other educational needs that result from the child’s disability,” 20 \nU.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II), some IEPs only include two objectives for an entire year.  Other \n                                                 \n6   The IDEA requires that each student’s IEP contain “a statement of measurable \nannual goals, including academic and functional goals.”  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II) \n(emphasis added); see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.320(a)(2).   \n260 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 266 of 318\nIEPs include only four objectives, two of which begin to be taught only after the other two are \ncompleted.  Thibadeau Tr. 2177:16-2178:2; Smith Tr. 2161:21-2162:2. \n768.  Where an IEP identifies a skill that a student should master, the IEP’s short term \nobjectives should include:  (1) a statement indicating conditions under which the new skill will \nbe performed; (2) a description of the skill in observable and measurable terms that allow \nteachers to determine whether it has been mastered; and (3) a plan for maintenance and \ngeneralization of the skill.  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d); Thibadeau Tr. 2223:6-14. \n769.  CHDC students’ IEP objectives do not meet these standards because, by failing to \nindicate the number of trials or sessions during which the student must demonstrate a certain \nlevel of performance, the IEPs fail to indicate the mastery criteria for the observable behavior the \nstudent is to exhibit.  CHDC IEPs also lack evidence of planning for skill maintenance and \ngeneralization.  Thibadeau Tr. 2178:3-12, 2223:15-2237:21; US Exs. 1109 through 1114 \n(examples of illustrative inadequate IEP goals and objectives for CHDC students SA, TF, BH, \nJM, TS, CT). \n770.  The IDEA requires that IEPs contain observable and measurable goals so, to the extent \nthis information is contained in other documents outside the IEP, such as in an IPP, this would \nnot satisfy the IDEA.  Thibadeau Tr. 2238:1-9, 2415:3-9.   \n771.  Consistent with Dr. Thibadeau’s opinion, ADE also found that in many cases, CHDC IEP \ngoals and objectives are poorly written, and the objectives often do not relate to the goals or \naddress the specific needs of the student.  Thibadeau Tr. 2239:2-2240:5; US Ex. 1214.  For \nexample, ADE found that student BM’s IEP contained the same objectives two years in a row, \nand those objectives only addressed the use of a wheelchair.  Thibadeau Tr. 2344:17-2345:11; \nUS Ex. 1216.  ADE also found that student CA’s IEP goals and objectives had little connection \n261 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 267 of 318\nto each other and to CA’s needs, as the student had a two year-old functional speech level and \ncould only say a few words but was supposed to be “learning the language of algebra.”  \nThibadeau Tr. 2345:12-2346:3; US Ex. 1216. \n772.  Defendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, concurs with Dr. Thibadeau that at \nleast some CHDC IEP objectives are not clear, particularly with regard to the conditions under \nwhich tasks were to be performed.  Nye Tr. 5159:5-24.  Mr. Nye acknowledges that CHDC \neducation staff would benefit from training regarding the writing of IEP goals and objectives.  \nNye Tr. 5160:3-14. \n773.  Defendants’ other special education consultant, Dr. Bruce Gale, testified that goal writing \nappears to be the biggest problem with CHDC IEPs.  Gale Tr. 5748:5-12. \n774.  Teachers do not consistently use objective measures to assess progress toward even those \ngoals and objectives that are included on the IEPs.  Thibadeau Tr. 2287:5-2289:6.     \n775.  Also consistent with Dr. Thibadeau’s observations, ADE found that some teachers and \naides did not consistently chart student progress, and it was unclear how progress was measured \nother than correct versus incorrect answers.  Thibadeau Tr. 2289:7-19; US Ex. 1214. \nF.  CHDC Fails To Administer IDEA-Required Statewide and Districtwide \nAssessments. \n776.  The IDEA, in addition to the No Child Left Behind Act, requires that students with \ndisabilities participate in statewide assessments to the same extent as their non-disabled peers – \nby participating in:  (1) general statewide assessments without accommodations; (2) general \nstatewide assessments with accommodations; or (3) alternate assessments.  See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1412(a)(16) (requiring that “[a]ll children with disabilities are included in all general state and \ndistrictwide assessment programs, including assessments described under section 6311 of this \n262 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 268 of 318\ntitle, with appropriate accommodations and alternate assessments where necessary and as \nindicated in their respective individualized education programs.”).   \n777.  IDEA-required statewide and districtwide assessments ensure that students with \ndisabilities have access to the State’s challenging academic content standards and that the State \nmeasures the achievement of children with disabilities against those standards.  Id.; Thibadeau \nTr. 2248:23-2250:10.  CHDC IEPs do not indicate a grade level and students do not receive \ngrades as they do in the public schools, see, e.g., US Ex. 2026 (updated CHDC IEPs), so \nstatewide and districtwide assessments are especially important for measuring student progress.  \n778.  CHDC is not exempt from any IDEA or ADE requirements.  Harding Tr. 2990:5-7.  ADE \nhas only advised CHDC that it is exempt from statewide and districtwide assessments under the \nNo Child Left Behind Act; ADE has not provided CHDC with any opinion regarding whether \nthe IDEA also requires statewide and districtwide assessments.  Harding Tr. 3057:5-14. \n779.  Defendants’ special education consultant agrees that both the IDEA and the No Child \nLeft Behind Act require statewide and districtwide assessments, so, even if CHDC were exempt \nunder the No Child Left Behind Act, the IDEA would nevertheless require such assessments.  \nNye Tr. 5195:4-8.   \n780.  CHDC students do not participate in:  (1) general statewide or districtwide assessments \nwithout accommodations; (2) general statewide or districtwide assessments with \naccommodations; or (3) alternative assessments, i.e., the Arkansas Alternative Assessment \nProgram.  Thibadeau Tr. 2248:23-2249:24, 2250:11-22, 2251:6-25; Milum Tr. 2141:7-12; Smith \nTr. 2164:4-9; Defs. Response to Plaintiff’s Statement of Undisputed Facts ¶ 73 [Dkt. 104]; US \nEx.  1214.   \n263 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 269 of 318\nG.  CHDC Fails To Consider IDEA-Required Factors in Developing Students’ \nIEPs. \n781.  The IDEA prescribes certain required factors that IEP teams must consider in developing \nstudents’ IEPs, including students’ academic, developmental, functional, and communication \nneeds.  34 C.F.R. § 300.324(a).   \n782.  CHDC assessment tools do not address all necessary areas of development to enable \naccurate assessment of present levels of performance and appropriate development of goals and \nobjectives.  Thibadeau Tr. 2177:1-15. \n783.  CHDC relies heavily on Brigance assessments, which do not assess functional skill \ndevelopment in areas such as communication, self-help, domestic, leisure, and vocational skills; \nskill development in these areas is particularly important for older students.  CHDC also relies \nheavily on the Brigance Diagnostic Inventory for Early Development, an assessment tool \nintended for use with children from birth to age seven, which does not result in age-appropriate \ngoals and objectives for many CHDC students and fails to address important life skills, goals, \nand objectives.  Thibadeau Tr. 2177:1-15, 2241:4-2243:16; Smith Tr. 2164:1-3 (CHDC tries to \nuse Brigance assessment to measure functional skills).   \n784.  CHDC does not conduct comprehensive teacher-made assessments to address the areas of \nneed omitted by the formal educational assessment inappropriately relied upon by CHDC, the \nBrigance.  Thibadeau Tr. 2243:25-2245:10. \n785.  ADE also criticized CHDC for relying heavily on the Brigance Inventory for Early \nDevelopment and for not using educational assessments that measure functional outcomes.  \nHarding Tr. 3022:3-22; US Ex. 1186.  Accordingly, ADE recommended in 2005 that CHDC \nreplace the Brigance with an updated formative evaluation tool to better assess student strengths \nand needs. US Ex. 1186 at 4. \n264 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 270 of 318\n786.  CHDC does not train its teachers on administering the formal assessments they give to \nCHDC students, including the Brigance and reading-free vocational assessment.  Milum Tr. \n2135:4-8. \n787.  The IDEA also requires that assessments be administered in a manner that meets the \ncommunication style of the individual who is being assessed.  34 C.F.R. § 300.324(a)(2).  CHDC \nhas not met this obligation because it has not offered these assessment accommodations to all \nstudents with disabilities.  For example, a student with a visual impairment did not receive an \nassessment because it was typically offered in pictoral form, and a student with a hearing \nimpairment did not receive a different assessment because a sign language interpreter was not \navailable.  Thibadeau Tr. 2246:14-2248:20; US Exs. 1193 & 1229. \nH.  CHDC Fails To Provide Related Services to All Students Who Require Them \nTo Benefit from Special Education Services. \n788.  FAPE under the IDEA requires provision of all related services required by students’ \nneeds.  20 U.S.C. §§ 1412, 1401(a)(18). “Related services” includes “transportation, and such \ndevelopmental, corrective, and other supportive services (including speech-language pathology \nand audiology services, interpreting services, psychological services, physical and occupational \ntherapy, recreation, including therapeutic recreation, social work services, school nurse services \n. . . counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, \nand medical services . . .) as may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from \nspecial education.”  20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(26).  Related services are essential to ensuring that \nstudents are able to access and benefit from education.  Id.; 34 C.F.R. § 300.34; Thibadeau Tr. \n2252:1-13. \n265 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 271 of 318\n789.  CHDC fails to provide related services, including speech services, communication device \nimplementation, psychological/behavioral services, and sign language interpretative services, to \nall students who require them.  Thibadeau Tr.2252:1-2253:6.   \n790.  ADE also found that CHDC does not provide all of the services needed to meet students’ \nidentified special education and related services needs.  Harding Tr. 3000:3-19; US Ex. 1104. \n791.  Consistent with Dr. Thibadeau’s observations, ADE found numerous examples of CHDC \nstudents whose education files indicated they were not receiving all required related services, \nsuch as communication and behavioral/mental health services, including students BR, BB, KF, \nCW, and MB.  Thibadeau Tr. 2340:24-2344:16, 2346:4-7, 2347:5-2348:24; US Ex. 1216. \n792.  The IDEA requires that, if a student’s behavior or other special factor impacts his or her \nlearning, the student’s IEP address that need.  Harding Tr. 3001:4-3002:10.  Among the steps \nthat the IEP team must take where a child’s behavioral needs are affecting his or her learning are \nthe consideration of positive behavioral supports and interventions.  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1414(d)(3)(B)(i).   \n793.  On their face, CHDC IEPs indicate that students should be receiving related services, \nsuch as behavioral services and communication services, yet the IEPs do not list any such \nservices being provided.  Buck Tr. 6543:21-6544:13, 6545:5-6546:5; US Ex. 2026 at US-CON-\nE-0031229, US-CON-E-0031263, US-CON-E-0031313 (updated IEPs showing that Defendants \ncontinue to fail to remedy related services deficiencies).   \n794.  Though a significant percentage of youth at CHDC were admitted in part because of \nbehavioral problems, CHDC does not offer any counseling or psychotherapy services.  Nye Tr. \n5222:2-5; see also A. Green Tr. 846:9-17 (majority of CHDC children are admitted because they \nhave significant behavioral health needs). \n266 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 272 of 318\n795.  CHDC fails to integrate related services with other CHDC services, resulting in \nadditional gaps in services for students and insufficient information sharing among educational \nstaff regarding the efficacy of the services in place.  Thibadeau Tr. 2179:3-14, 2253:7-2255:6, \n2276:13-17.   \n796.  IDEA requires that the IEP team meet and revise an IEP to respond to, among other \nthings, “any lack of expected progress toward the annual goals and in the general education \ncurriculum, where appropriate.”  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(4)(A)(ii)(I).  However, the team process \nenvisioned by the IDEA is not occurring at CHDC, as CHDC fails to ensure regular interaction \nbetween education and communications, physical therapy, and occupational therapy staff.  \nMilum Tr. 2120:7-16; Smith Tr. 2166:20-2167:24.  Education staff also do not interact regularly \nwith psychology staff; rather, they interact only at annual meetings, upon a new student’s arrival, \nand upon request.  Milum Tr. 2119:18-2120:6.  Psychology staff do not routinely come into \nCHDC classrooms without a teacher’s request.  Milum Tr. 2148:12-14. \n797.  ADE also found that CHDC psychology staff lack knowledge regarding the requirements \nof the IDEA and its implications in the education program.  Harding Tr. 2996:24-2998:15; US \nEx. 1199. \n798.  Consistent with Dr. Thibadeau’s observations, ADE found little to no communication \nbetween education staff, related services staff, and residence staff, which is not surprising given \nthat CHDC education staff schedules do not include time to communicate regarding students’ \nneeds.  Thibadeau Tr. 2275:17-2276:12, 2278:8-18; US Ex. 1214.  Generally, information is \nshared among disciplines only once a year at the IPP and IEP meeting.  Milum Tr. 2119:9-20.  \nThis lack of communication precludes implementation of comprehensive service plans and \nundermines the integrity of plan implementation.  Thibadeau Tr. 2278:19-2279:8. \n267 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 273 of 318\n799.  Even Defendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, testified that one of the \nteachers he interviewed felt that CHDC psychology staff are too busy, are located too far away, \nand are not meeting students’ needs.  Nye Tr. 5127:1-5128:1. \n800.  Defendants’ other special education consultant, Dr. Bruce Gale, commented that the level \nof collaboration between psychological and speech staff could be better than it is.  Gale Tr. \n5742:12-5744:2. \n801.  CHDC related services staff also lack training in special education, and education staff \nlack training in related services.  Thibadeau Tr. 2276:18-2277:6; US Ex. 1214.  When ADE \nprovided training to CHDC psychology staff regarding their IDEA obligations in July 2010, staff \nindicated a lack of understanding regarding their responsibilities and appeared to be under the \nmistaken impression that they were only charged with meeting ICF/MR CMS funding standards.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2281:16-2282:17; US Ex. 1199.  As a result, CHDC students do not receive \ncomprehensive related services.  Thibadeau Tr. 2277:7-13.   \n1.  CHDC Does Not Provide Adequate Communication/Audiology Services to \nStudents. \n802.  All students who require communication skills development are entitled to and should be \nreceiving such related services; otherwise, these students are not receiving FAPE.  20 U.S.C.    \n§§ 1412, 1401(a)(18); Thibadeau Tr. 2259:23-2260:3.  Both Dr. Thibadeau and ADE found a \nnumber of CHDC students who should be receiving communication services but are not.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2178:13-2179:2, 2255:7-23; US Ex. 1216 at US-CON-E-0049596 through 597.    \n803.  CHDC utilizes a direct therapy method of speech language therapy, which results in \nstudents learning communication skills in only one environment, without learning to apply \n268 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 274 of 318\ncommunication skills outside the therapy room.7  Thibadeau Tr. 2259:3-22.  Defendants’ \nconsultant who commented on related services, Dr. Bruce Gale, suggested that CHDC consider \nusing an integrated or consultative model instead of a direct therapy model of communication \nservices.  Gale Tr. 5738:2-10.   \n804.  CHDC only offers its direct therapy model speech services to about half of the CHDC \nstudents who need them.  Thibadeau Tr. 2178:13-2179:2, 2255:7-23.   \n805.  CHDC inappropriately selects students for speech and language services according to the \nstudent’s potential for progress and the student’s interest in developing his/her skills.  Thibadeau \nTr. 2257:17-2258:5, 2259:23-2260:10.   \n806.  Development of communication skills is especially important for children who engage in \nproblem behavior, as it enables them to communicate in a manner other than through the \nproblem behavior.  Given that many children have been placed at CHDC for behavioral reasons, \ncommunication skill development should be paramount.  Thibadeau Tr. 2256:5-2257:16. \n807.  Only 7 of the 21 non-verbal school-aged children at CHDC have augmentative \ncommunication devices.  Johnson Tr. 5389:7-11.  For this small number of CHDC students \nprovided assistive technology, CHDC staff does not encourage the use of these devices and, \nconsequently, students do not consistently use them.  Thibadeau Tr. 2258:6-2259:2. \n808.  ADE also found instances of CHDC students not having access in the classroom to their \nalternative or augmentative communication devices, such as communication books or other \ncommunication devices.  Thibadeau Tr. 2260:11-24, 2261:13-2262:23, 2350:25-2351:8; US Exs. \n1201 & 1206.   \n                                                 \n7   Speech/language therapists do not routinely go into classrooms to observe and \nassist with students’ communication skills, further exacerbating the problem with transferring \ncommunication skills outside the therapy room using a direct therapy model.  Thibadeau Tr. \n2259:3-22.   \n269 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 275 of 318\n809.  The IDEA requires that hearing aids worn in school by students with hearing \nimpairments are functioning properly.  34 C.F.R. § 300.113(a).  ADE found that CHDC had not \nbeen regularly monitoring students’ hearing aids in the classroom to ensure they were \nfunctioning properly.  Thibadeau Tr. 2260:11-2261:12; US Ex. 1201.  As a result, CHDC \nstudents, such as students LW, JB, and BB, have not had their required hearing devices available \nand functioning in the classroom, in violation of the IDEA.  Thibadeau Tr. 2263:3-23, 2264:11-\n2265:14; US Exs. 1214, 1224 & 1225.   \n810.  ADE also found no evidence of follow-up regarding poor vision and hearing and no \nevidence of formal augmentative alternative communication assessments in CHDC education \nfiles.  Thibadeau Tr. 226324-2264:10; US Ex. 1211.   \n2.  CHDC Does Not Provide Adequate Psychology/Behavioral Services to \nStudents. \n811.  The IDEA requires that “in the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child’s \nlearning and that of others, [the IEP team] consider the use of positive behavioral interventions \nand supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior.”  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(i).  In \npractical terms, this means that a functional behavior assessment and behavior support plan must \nbe completed for students whose behavior results in their being placed outside of their regular \neducation classrooms.  Thibadeau Tr. 2271:23-2272:12.       \n812.  According to CHDC IEPs, many CHDC students were placed at CHDC because of their \nbehaviors.  Thibadeau Tr. 2272:13-21; A. Green Tr. 846:9-17.  Yet CHDC does not use \nfunctional behavior assessments with all CHDC students and, to the extent CHDC attempts to \nuse functional behavioral assessments, they are not comprehensive in scope because, for \nexample, they do not involve individuals like teachers who interact on a daily basis with the \nstudents.  Thibadeau Tr. 2269:25-2270:12, 2271:9-22.   \n270 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 276 of 318\n813.  Consistent with Dr. Thibadeau’s observations, ADE also noted that in most cases, \nstudents’ education files do not include behavior plans or goals and objectives to address \nbehavior in the education setting.  Thibadeau Tr. 2277:23-2278:7; US Ex. 1214.  ADE also \nfound that CHDC did not necessarily address problem behaviors in the classroom for students \nwho were on shortened school days reportedly for behavior issues.  Thibadeau Tr. 2279:9-19; \nHarding Tr. 3011:23-3013:10; US Ex. 1214.   \n814.  ADE found in its review of a sample of 15 students that at least 7 students who should \nhave had behavior plans or strategies in their education files did not.  Thibadeau Tr. 2273:9-24; \nUS Ex. 1211.  Accordingly, education staff cannot follow students’ behavior plans, and those \nplans cannot be consistently implemented across students’ environments.  Thibadeau Tr. \n2273:25-2274:8.   \n815.  CHDC also fails to adequately train staff in plans for behavior interventions, as \npsychological examiners infrequently interact with teachers.  Thibadeau Tr. 2266:24-2267:12, \n2270:13-23, 2272:22-2273:8.  ADE also found that some teachers knew little about behavior \nstrategies for specific students, again affecting the consistency of implementation of behavior \nplans and strategies.  Thibadeau 2277:14-22; US Ex. 1214. \n816.  Generally accepted professional standards require collecting and graphing daily measures \nof student performance, i.e., an accurate measure of treatment integrity.  CHDC’s behavior \nreports are inaccurate measures of behavior because they do not define the target behaviors and \noffer ranges of behavior occurrences to assess, and, in any event, are inconsistently completed by \nCHDC staff.  Thibadeau Tr. 2270:24-2271:8, 2286:6-2287:4, 2289:20-2291:14.  \n817.  For example, Dr. Thibadeau witnessed two CHDC students engaged in self-harm that, \nper CHDC policy, should have triggered staff completion of behavior reports.  Yet, upon Dr. \n271 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 277 of 318\nThibadeau’s request to see the behavior reports, the facility responded that for at least one of the \nincidents, no behavior report existed.  Thibadeau Tr. 2179:3-2180:1. \n818.  Similarly, Defendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, could not locate a \nbehavior report for an incident he observed in which a student exhibited behaviors, was escorted \nout of class, and did not return.  Nye Tr. 5224:17-5225:2. \n819.  ADE also criticized CHDC for its inadequate method of tracking behaviors by relying on \nteachers to count and record the numbers of observed behaviors.  Harding Tr. 3025:2-10; US Ex. \n1186 at 7. \n820.  Accurate behavior data is important because potential changes to behavior plans and \nmedication tapers are based on such data.  Thibadeau Tr. 2179:15-2180:13, 2291:15-2292:5.  \n821.  The effects of inadequate behavior management tools also may be seen in CHDC’s use of \nantiquated and inappropriate mechanical restraints on children.  Numerous states, including \nMassachusetts and Maine, have outlawed mechanical restraints for children, yet CHDC \ncontinues to use a highly restrictive papoose board on children.  Thibadeau Tr. 2284:25-2286:5.  \n822.  Use of papoose boards in classrooms is doubly problematic because CHDC education \nstaff admit that the restraints distract the class.  Milum Tr. 2141:13-2142:10, 2147:11-21. \nI.  CHDC’s Transition Planning and Transition Services Do Not Satisfy IDEA \nRequirements. \n823.  The IDEA requires that, once a student with disabilities turns 16 years old, schools \nprovide a coordinated set of services to support the student as he or she moves from secondary \neducation to post-secondary life, including vocational training, independent living skills, and \nsupported employment.  34 C.F.R. § 300.320(b); Thibadeau Tr. 2292:6-18.  Transition services \nfor CHDC students do not address the needs of students who are 16 years or older; as a result, \n272 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 278 of 318\nstudents are not adequately prepared for vocational or post-secondary activities.  Thibadeau Tr. \n2292:6-2293:8.   \n824.  IEPs must contain appropriate, measurable transition goals based upon age appropriate \ntransition assessments related to training, education, employment, and, where appropriate, \nindependent living skills and the transition services needed to reach these goals.  34 C.F.R.         \n§ 300.320(b).  CHDC students’ IEPs do not contain appropriate, measurable goals for transition \nservices because CHDC students’ transition plans do not clearly specify what skills the student is \nlearning or how student performance will be measured.  Thibadeau Tr. 2181:22-2182:7; Buck Tr. \n6542:3-25; US Exs. 1115 through 1118. \n825.  Even Defendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, found that CHDC transition \nplans lack clarity and fail to contain measurable goals, as required by the IDEA.  Nye Tr. \n5137:17-5138:20. \n826.  Several illustrative examples demonstrate how CHDC IEP transition goals are neither \nmeasurable nor appropriate.  Thibadeau Tr. 2294:1-2298:10.  For example, student JB’s \ntransition plan does not contain appropriate individualized, measurable goals but rather states \nthat JB will identify community signs and write his first and last name - skills that may be \nsupplemental to vocational skills but will not enable such skills.  Thibadeau Tr. 2294:1-24; US \nEx. 1115.  Regarding independent living skills, student JB’s IEP indicates only that he will \nidentify health care items, which will not provide adequate training for independent living.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2294:25-2295:12; US Ex. 1115. \n827.  Similarly, CHDC student TH’s transition plan indicates only “communication/language” \nin the employment section and, in the independent living section, only “food items, self-help \nskills, recreation/leisure, daily living, and money” are listed.  None of these is an appropriate, \n273 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 279 of 318\nmeasurable transition objective.  Thibadeau Tr. 2295:13-2296:8; US Ex. 1116.  TH’s plan \nrepeats these vague goals from the prior year.  Thibadeau Tr. 2296:9-15; US Ex. 1116. \n828.  CHDC student BM’s transition plan contains vague references to “recreation/leisure and \nadult enrichment,” repeated from the prior year, without specifying appropriate measurable \ngoals.  Thibadeau Tr. 2296:16-2297:13; US Ex. 1117. \n829.  Finally, CHDC student DN’s IEP transition plan similarly lists only “hand/face washing, \npour liquids, matching textures, and money management,” none of which satisfy the IDEA’s \nrequirement for appropriate, measurable transition goals.  These goals also had been continued \nfrom multiple prior years. Thibadeau Tr. 2297:14-2298:5; US Ex. 1118. \n830.  As demonstrated by these inadequate transition goals, CHDC does not administer \neffective transition plan assessments to develop such goals.  CHDC should be engaging the \nstudent in discussions and/or assessments to identify his or her interests and strengths, using that \nas a platform to discuss potential vocational opportunities with the student and his or her family.  \nInstead, CHDC utilizes the reading-free vocational assessment, which involves students pointing \nto pictures depicting occupations.  This assessment is not likely to result in an accurate \nmeasurement of students’ vocational interests.  Thibadeau Tr. 2242:18-2243:16.  Even CHDC \neducation staff acknowledge that this assessment is not accurate for all students.  Milum Tr. \n2135:9-2136:2.   \n831.  When CHDC does solicit input from students regarding their career interests, \ndocumented instances show that this input is sometimes ignored.  Thibadeau Tr. 2243:17-24, \n2354:8-2355:9; US Ex. 2026 at US-CON-E-0031258 and US-CON-E-0031275 (updated IEP \ntransition plans of students TT and CW not reflecting students’ stated interests). \n274 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 280 of 318\n832.  Further, CHDC makes little attempt to engage outside agencies in planning for students’ \ntransition to adult life.  Representatives of outside agencies needed for transition do not generally \nparticipate in transition planning for CHDC students.  Thibadeau Tr. 2181:22-2182:13, 2299:10-\n24.   \n833.  Without outside agency contact, parents, guardians, and students are not aware of the \nrange of services available in their communities, and service providers do not know about the \nneeds of CHDC students who may need services upon their transition.  Thibadeau Tr. 2299:10-\n19.  Lack of outside agency involvement in transition services risks students’ ability to access \nand benefit from services to transition them from secondary education to adult life.  This is \nparticularly important for students with needs for comprehensive supports and services.  Yet \nCHDC does not educate parents about the function of outside agencies and the importance of \ngranting permission for outside agency attendance at IEP meetings.  Thibadeau Tr. 2299:20-\n2300:21. \n834.  ADE also found that CHDC IEP notices to parents do not consistently identify other \nagency representatives to be invited to participate in IEP meeting transition services discussions.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2301:10-19.  Unless CHDC identifies agency representatives in parental notices, \noutside agency representatives cannot participate in IEP meetings because the IDEA requires \nparental consent for their participation.  34 C.F.R. § 300.321(b)(3); Thibadeau Tr. 2300:13-21, \n2302:1-2303:1; US Exs. 1104 & 1207.   \n835.  As of ADE’s site inspection in January 2010, 28 of 50 students needed appropriate \ntransition services because they were 16 years old or older.  Thibadeau Tr. 2293:21; US Ex. \n1208.   \n275 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 281 of 318\n836.  Consistent with Dr. Thibadeau, ADE also found that CHDC students’ IEP transition \nplans did not include appropriate, measurable post-secondary goals based on an age-appropriate \ntransition assessment related to training, education, employment, and, where appropriate, \nindependent living skills, as required by the IDEA.  Thibadeau Tr. 2298:19-2299:9, 2302:1-\n2303:1; Harding Tr. 3002:13-3003:24; US Exs. 1104, 1201 & 1207.   \nJ.  CHDC Fails To Educate Students in the Least Restrictive Environment, as \nRequired by the IDEA. \n837.  Students with disabilities are entitled to be educated in an environment where they have \nthe maximum possible interaction with their non-disabled peers, both in educational and extra-\ncurricular activities.  Districts are not authorized to choose a more restrictive placement than that \nwhich is appropriate, as the IDEA explicitly requires that “[t]o the maximum extent appropriate, \nchildren with disabilities . . . are educated with children who are not disabled, and special \nclasses, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular \neducational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is \nsuch that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be \nachieved satisfactorily.”  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A); see also 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.114, 300.117. \n838.  Contrary to IDEA requirements, CHDC students are not educated in the least restrictive \nenvironment, as CHDC is one of the most restrictive environments and no student attends any \nclass or extracurricular activity with his or her non-disabled peers.  Thibadeau Tr. 2303:2-\n2305:10; Milum Tr. 2116:15-2117:3; Smith Tr. 2153:15-17. \n839.  ADE also found insufficient evidence that CHDC provides students with an equal \nopportunity for participation in nonacademic and extracurricular activities, including \nparticipation with non-disabled students to the maximum extent possible.  Thibadeau Tr. \n2314:25-2315:11; US Ex. 1201. \n276 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 282 of 318\n840.  Defendants’ special education consultant, Dr. Bruce Gale, acknowledged that the concept \nof least restrictive environment has not been fully implemented as to CHDC students.  Gale Tr. \n5755:20-5756:10.  Dr. Gale also admitted that CHDC staff fail to meet their obligation to raise \npotential alternative placements for students absent a parental request to do so.  Gale Tr. \n5760:20-5764:3. \n841.  CHDC students who attended public schools prior to their admission to CHDC used to be \nable to attend classes and extracurricular activities with their non-disabled peers while in public \nschool.  Milum Tr. 2116:4-7; Nye Tr. 5235:23-5240:15; US Exs. 1103-1 through 1103-9.   \n842.  Over the last several years, CHDC has provided less, not more, opportunities for students \nto participate in mainstreamed activities.  CHDC previously provided a few students the \nopportunity to attend the public schools in Conway under a now-expired agreement with the \nlocal school district.  Thibadeau Tr. 2314:16-24; Smith Tr. 2153:18-20; Harding Tr. 3026:4-11. \n843.   Even when CHDC provided more options to satisfy its LRE obligations by allowing 3 of \nthe then-36 students at CHDC attended public school activities, ADE nonetheless recommended \nin 2005 that CHDC provide additional options by actually enrolling students in the local public \nschools.  Harding Tr. 3025:11-3026:3; US Ex. 1186.   \n844.  Instead, CHDC now tries not to admit students who have received educational services \nwith their non-disabled peers because, contrary to IDEA requirements for a full continuum of \nplacement options, public school placement is not made available to CHDC students.  See \n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5); 34 C.F.R. § 300.115.    \n845.  Though CHDC education staff believe the Conway public school system has the \nresponsibility to accept students from CHDC, Milum Tr. 2133:6-9, no CHDC students are \nallowed to attend any classes with their non-disabled peers.  Nye Tr. at 5146:6-5147:9.   \n277 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 283 of 318\n846.  Some students at CHDC have needs similar to students who attend classes with non-\ndisabled peers in the Conway public school system.  Milum Tr. 2115:25-2116:3.  Yet these \nstudents no longer attend public school, primarily because of reported behavior concerns.  Milum \nTr. 2116:8-14.  Pursuant to their IDEA obligations, special education teachers in public schools \ncommonly address behaviors so students can learn in the classroom.  Thibadeau Tr. 2196:11-\n2197:17, 2200:8-2201:5, 2206:10-24; see 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(i).   \n847.  Even Defendants’ education consultant agrees that once a student’s behavioral concerns \nare addressed, CHDC should be looking for a less restrictive placement for that student.  Nye Tr. \n5241:14-21. \n848.  CHDC education staff and individualized education plan teams have expressed concern \nthat CHDC students are not being educated in the least restrictive environment.  Thibadeau Tr. \n2305:23-2307:14; Milum Tr. 2125:4-9; US Exs. 1191, 1193 & 1196.      \n849.  For example, in at least two special education annual reviews for student LW, CHDC \neducation staff documented their belief that CHDC is not the least restrictive environment for \nLW.  Thibadeau Tr. 2306:4-2307:4; Milum Tr. 2126:3-2128:18; US Exs. 1193 & 1196.  LW has \nnot had access to sign language interpretive services at the CHDC school, as CHDC has no sign \nlanguage interpreters and CHDC education staff are not fluent in sign language.  Thibadeau Tr. \n2307:15-2308:6; Milum Tr. 2125:10-24; Smith Tr. 2165:9-2166:16; US Ex. 1215.  LW would be \nbetter served in an educational environment in which he could communicate with his educators \nand peers.  Thibadeau Tr. 2313:19-2314:7.  Yet CHDC placed the burden of pursuing a more \nappropriate placement on LW’s parents.  Milum Tr. 2148:15-2149:3.  Meanwhile, CHDC \ndocumented LW’s frustration in not being able to communicate via sign language with CHDC \nstaff.  Buck Tr. 6528:12-6529:17; Defs. Ex. 483.  These problems are not limited to LW.  Other \n278 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 284 of 318\nCHDC students have hearing impairments and are therefore similarly deprived of the opportunity \nto communicate using sign language and to develop sign language skills while at the CHDC \nschool.  Milum Tr. 2125:25-2126:2; Smith Tr. 2152:12-14; Buck 6516:9-11. \n850.  CHDC education staff also documented their belief that the CHDC school is not the least \nrestrictive environment for ZS, as he would likely benefit in a learning environment with \nstudents more comparable to his intellectual ability.  Thibadeau Tr. 2307:5-14; Milum Tr. \n2129:1-3; US Ex. 1191.  According to his teacher, ZS is a very attentive student who has mild \ndisabilities, significant academic skills, and enjoys learning, but has not received sufficient \nspecial education instructional time for years at CHDC.  Milum Tr. 2121:2-2122:3, 2128:21-\n2131:14; US Exs. 1190 through 1192; see also FOF # 27 (ZS’s admission to CHDC was \nsupposed to be temporary until waiver services in the community were established for him). \n851.  Dr. Thibadeau concurs with CHDC education staff’s recommendation for a less \nrestrictive educational environment for ZS, as CHDC documentation indicated that ZS’s \nbehavior in the classroom had markedly improved and his reading comprehension was only a \nfew years below average.  Thibadeau Tr. 2311:15-2312:8; US Exs. 1169, 1190 & 1191. \n852.  CHDC student records and classroom performance observations indicate that CHDC is \nnot the least restrictive educational environment for additional students.  Thibadeau Tr. 2181:14-\n21, 2305:11-22.  For example, Dr. Thibadeau observed CHDC student CA throughout her two \nweeks on-site, and he interacted well with other individuals and appeared to be capable of \nfollowing the school routine.  With appropriate supports and services, CHDC student CA could \nbe served in a less restrictive environment.  Thibadeau Tr. 2309:18-2310:12; US Ex. 1123.   \n853.  CHDC student CL also could be served in a less restrictive environment.  CHDC \ndocumentation indicates he can read at or above grade level, tell time, complete some addition \n279 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 285 of 318\nproblems, and write in print.  He is diagnosed with a moderate intellectual disability and autism.  \nDr. Thibadeau observed CL to be receptive to instruction as well.  Thibadeau Tr. 2310:13-\n2311:2; US Ex. 1147. \n854.  Similarly, Dr. Thibadeau observed CHDC student JR to be cooperative with instruction, \nand independently mobile.  He is also a good candidate for education in a less restrictive \nenvironment.  Thibadeau Tr. 2311:3-14; US Ex. 1163. \n855.  CHDC student TS has intellectual and social functioning levels in the mild to borderline \nrange and had only one behavior report in the month he had been at CHDC.  Dr. Thibadeau also \nobserved him interacting appropriately with others, including assisting with lunchtime clean-up.  \nHe also could be served in a less restrictive environment.  Thibadeau Tr. 2312:9-25; US Ex. \n1176. \n856.  CHDC student SW also has a low frequency of behaviors resulting in behavior reports at \nCHDC.  SW functions intellectually and socially at the moderate level.  Dr. Thibadeau observed \nSW to be capable of appropriately communicating his needs and wants.  In sum, SW appeared to \nbe able to benefit from a less restrictive environment.  Thibadeau Tr. 2313:1-18; US Ex. 1182. \n857.  CHDC’s efforts to provide community experiences for CHDC students fall far short of \nthe types of regular interactions with non-disabled peers contemplated by the IDEA’s least \nrestrictive environment requirement.  For example, CHDC responded to ADE’s inquiry \nregarding interactions with non-disabled peers that CHDC students “shop in the community, \nattend the fair, attend parades, go out to eat, and go to movies.”  Thibadeau Tr. 2308:7-2309:1; \nUS Ex. 1215.  CHDC also attempts to construct community interaction with students by having \nschool bands and choirs perform at CHDC and by having student volunteers occasionally \nvolunteer at CHDC outside of school hours.  Thibadeau Tr. 2315:12-2317:21; US Exs. 1226 & \n280 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 286 of 318\n1227.  Such sporadic group community outings and occasional on-campus interactions do not \nenable CHDC students to form social relationships with their non-disabled peers, as would \nregular attendance in classes and extra-curricular activities – opportunities no CHDC student has.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2308:7-2309:1, 2317:5-21. \n858.  Schools are obligated under the IDEA to conduct an independent analysis of whether \neach student is being educated in the least restrictive environment appropriate to the student’s \nneeds.  The fact that a parent has not made a request for a more integrated setting does not \nrelieve a school of this obligation.  Thibadeau Tr. 2304:4-15. \n859.  If CHDC were to comply with the IDEA’s requirement for local education agency \nrepresentatives to participate in IEP meetings, CHDC would be better informed about \ncommunity education options that could enable CHDC students to be served in a less restrictive \nenvironment.  Thibadeau Tr. 2317:22-2318:12.  CHDC’s lack of communication and cessation \nof its relationship with the local school district contribute to the ongoing isolation of students at \nCHDC in an environment that is highly restrictive.  Thibadeau Tr. 2318:13-2319:4. \n860.  CHDC is a highly restrictive environment in which students’ functional skills are not \ndeveloped, which perpetuates the students’ placements in the most restrictive environment on the \ncontinuum of special education services.  Schools are required to teach students the skills to \nbetter prepare them to transition to a less restrictive environment, yet CHDC does not.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2319:6-25.  For example, CHDC students’ toileting skills are not developed in \nCHDC’s educational program, Milum Tr. 2142:25-2143:7, and students continue to use Pull-ups \nor Attends.  Thibadeau Tr. 2320:1-13.  Similarly, residential staff fail to adequately attend to \nstudents’ eating plans, providing students with the wrong diets and making no attempts to \nimprove students’ eating skills.  Thibadeau Tr. 2180:14-2181:1, 2320:14-2321:19.   \n281 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 287 of 318\n861.  Not only does CHDC’s education program fail to address such skills development \nthrough students’ IEPs, but CHDC’s IPPs also fail to encompass all appropriate skill \ndevelopment.  For example, CHDC IPPs inappropriately require that students acquire certain \nskills before learning other unrelated skills, such as teeth brushing before toileting.  Thibadeau \nTr. 2321:20-2322:17.  As another example, CHDC students’ schedules include inordinate \namounts of time for basic skills development that could be incorporated into daily activity, such \nas 45 minutes 3 times a week dedicated to hand washing.  Thibadeau Tr. 2322:16-2323:3.   \nK.  CHDC Does Not Provide Adequate Teacher Training and Supervision. \n862.  Education staff must be appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, and those \npersonnel must have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  34 \nC.F.R. § 300.156(a).   To that end, CHDC must take measurable steps to recruit, hire, train, and \nretain highly qualified personnel to provide special education and related services to children \nwith disabilities.  34 C.F.R. § 300.156(d).   \n863.  CHDC teachers lack adequate training and supervision to appropriately implement \nstudents’ IEPs.  On-site observations revealed that teachers were not able to engage students in \nlearning because they were not familiar with student preferences and interests.  Thibadeau. Tr. \n2182:14-2183:21. \n864.  Teachers should be trained to conduct preference assessments and in task analysis, \ndiscrete trial instruction, prompting strategies, and planning for maintenance and generalization \nof skills, yet CHDC teachers do not have this training.  Thibadeau Tr. 2193:17-24, 2324:19-\n2326:12.  CHDC teacher Throndia Smith confirms that CHDC does not train its teachers on \nconducting preference assessments.  Smith Tr. 2160:24-2161:5.  Rather, as observed by Dr. \nThibadeau, CHDC teachers engage in repeated unsuccessful attempts to provide instruction, \n282 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 288 of 318\nwithout adapting their methods, illustrating how the teachers’ lack of training in these areas \nresults in inadequate instruction.  Thibadeau Tr. 2325:14-2326:12. \n865.  CHDC fails to require teachers to receive training in areas relevant to the needs of the \nstudents they teach.  Smith Tr. 2160:5-7. \n866.  Defendants’ special education consultant, Dr. Gale, agrees that CHDC would benefit \nfrom more in-service training in understanding the requirements of the IDEA.  Gale Tr. 5723:8-\n5724:12. \n867.  The standard in the field of special education requires ongoing teacher supervision by an \nindividual with education and experience in the subjects being taught.  None of the four teachers \ninterviewed by Dr. Thibadeau identified a consistent schedule of supervision or support for \nprovision of education services, implementation of behavior support plans, nor communication \ndevelopment.  Thibadeau Tr. 2328:7-2329:4, 2329:11-22.  Dr. Thibadeau also observed instances \nof ineffective instruction techniques that could have been corrected with adequate teacher \nsupervision.  Thibadeau Tr. 2330:19-2335:4.   \n868.  CHDC supervisory education staff fail to provide substantive oversight or feedback \nregarding IEP goals or objectives or their implementation.  Milum Tr. 2138:25-2139:22.   \n869.  CHDC’s special education supervisor is not certified in special education instruction or \nsupervision and therefore has insufficient knowledge of special education requirements.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2329:5-10.  The lead special education teacher called by Defendants to testify has \nno special education work experience outside of her employment at CHDC.  Buck Tr. 6508:8-10. \n870.  CHDC must adopt effective procedures for acquiring and disseminating to teachers and \nadministrators significant information from educational research, demonstrations, and similar \nprojects, and for adopting, where appropriate, promising educational practices developed through \n283 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 289 of 318\nsuch projects.  20 U.S.C. § 1232e.  ADE found insufficient evidence that CHDC has adopted \nrequired promising educational practices for the provision of special education instruction.  \nThibadeau Tr. 2335:23-2336:12; US Ex. 1104.   \n871.  ADE found that CHDC has no written plan for ongoing staff training or professional \ndevelopment.  Thibadeau Tr. 2336:13-20; US Ex. 1198.  Without such a plan, CHDC violates the \nIDEA and its implementing regulations by failing to train teachers to serve students’ unique \nneeds and teachers are ill-equipped to teach CHDC students, as CHDC teachers acknowledged in \ninterviews with ADE.  Thibadeau Tr. 2336:13-2340:23; US Exs. 1198, 1201 & 1214. \n872.  Defendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, testified that it will be time-\nconsuming for CHDC to develop a more systematized form of staff development.  Nye Tr. \n5167:6-22. \n873.  CHDC also fails to maintain an education policy manual, Smith Tr. 2152:17-19, and \nADE recently directed CHDC to develop one.  Milum Tr. 2136:6-12.  Although CHDC drafted \npolicies in summer 2010, it has not yet implemented them.  Buck Tr. 6520:6-20.  Without special \neducation policies, teachers lack direction and oversight. \nXV.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW - SPECIAL EDUCATION \nA.  CHDC’s Procedural IDEA Violations Deprive Students of Educational \nOpportunities. \n  In Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176 (1982), the Supreme Court established a two-step \ninquiry for evaluating claims that students have not received a free appropriate public education \n(“FAPE”) under the Education for All Handicapped Children’s Act, the predecessor statute to the \nIDEA.  458 U.S. at 206-07.  Under this two-step analysis, a court first evaluates whether a state \nhas complied with statutory procedural requirements.  Id. at 206.  Second, the court determines \nwhether the individualized educational program developed through statutory procedures is \n284 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 290 of 318\n“reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.”  Id. at 206-07.  Both \nrequirements must be met.  See id.  As the Rowley Court emphasized, “the importance Congress \nattached to these procedural requirements cannot be gainsaid.”  Id. at 205.   \n  Courts have continued to apply the Rowley two-part analysis to post-IDEA cases, looking \nfirst to determine whether there were procedural deficiencies before considering whether there \nare substantive violations.  Lathrop R-II Sch. Dist. v. Gray, 611 F.3d 419, 424 (8th Cir. 2010); \nYankton Sch. Dist. v. Scramm, 93 F.3d 1369, 1373 (8th Cir. 1996); Petersen v. Hastings Pub. \nSch., 31 F.3d 705, 707 (8th Cir. 1994).   \n    A procedural violation of the IDEA establishes a denial of FAPE if it compromises a \nstudent’s right to an appropriate education, seriously hampers the parents’ opportunity to \nparticipate in the IEP process, or causes a deprivation of educational benefits.  Lathrop R-II Sch. \nDist., 611 F.3d at 424; Sch. Bd. of Ind. Sch. Dist. No. 11 v. Renollett, 440 F.3d 1007, 1011 (8th \nCir. 2006); Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 283 v. S.D., 88 F.3d 556, 562 (8th Cir. 1996); Kingsmore v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 466 F.3d 118, 119 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (finding a violation of IDEA’s \nprocedural requirements “is viable only if those procedural violations affected the student’s \nsubstantive rights”); Park v. Anaheim Union High Sch. Dist., 464 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. \n2006) (“relief is appropriate if procedural violations deprive [the student] of an educational \nopportunity (prejudice) or seriously infringe his parents’ opportunity to participate in the \nformulation of the individualized education plan.”). \n  Routinely failing to offer a full continuum of educational placements, failing to convene \nIEP teams with all of the IDEA-required members (i.e., the LEA representative and a regular \neducation teacher), failing to develop IEPs that contain appropriate and measurable goals and \n285 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 291 of 318\nobjectives, failing to consider IDEA-required factors in developing IEPs, failing to administer \nstatewide and districtwide assessments, and failing to invite a representative from the agency or \nagencies likely to provide transition services,8 each constitute a denial of FAPE.  Each of these \nprocedural deficiencies deprives CHDC students of the educational benefits to which they are \nentitled under the IDEA, including opportunities to access public school and other agency \nresources, to develop skills through measurable IEP goals and objectives, and to benefit from \nstatewide achievement standards.   \n1.  CHDC Does Not Offer Students a Full Continuum of Educational \nPlacements, as Required by the IDEA. \nThe IDEA requires that each public agency provide students with disabilities, such as \nthose at CHDC, with a full continuum of educational placements, including access to instruction \nin both special education and regular education classes, as well as access to supplementary \nservices such as resource rooms for augmentation of students’ skills in particular subjects.  \n                                                 \n8   Under the IDEA, the term “transition services” means a coordinated set of \nactivities for a child with a disability that--  \n \n(A)  is  designed  to  be  within  a  results-oriented  process,  that  is  focused  on \nimproving the academic and functional achievement of the child with a disability \nto facilitate the child’s movement from school to post-school activities, including \npost-secondary  education,  vocational  education,  integrated  employment \n(including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, \nindependent living, or community participation;  \n \n(B)  is  based  on t he  individual  child’s  needs,  taking  into  account  the  child’s \nstrengths, preferences, and interests; and  \n \n(C)  includes  instruction,  related  services,  community  experiences,  the \ndevelopment of employment and other post-school adult living objectives, and, \nwhen  appropriate,  acquisition  of  daily  living  skills  and  functional  vocational \nevaluation.   \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1401(a)(34). \n \n286 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 292 of 318\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5); 34 C.F.R. § 300.115.  “Courts have held that the placement decision \nmust be based on the IEP produced by the IEP team and cannot be made before the IEP is \nproduced.” James D. v. Bd. of Educ., 642 F. Supp. 2d 804, 821 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (quoting Bd. of \nEduc. of Tp. High Sch. Dist. No. 211 v. Michael R., No. 02-6088, 2005 WL 2008919, at *14 \n(N.D. Ill. Aug. 15, 2005) (citing Spielberg v. Henrico County Pub. Sch., 853 F.2d 256, 258-59 \n(4th Cir. 1988))).  Therefore, a school’s “unilateral decision to change a student’s placement \nbefore the IEP meeting with the student’s parents, referred to as ‘predetermination,’ can \nconstitute a violation of the IDEA.”  Id.  Predetermination of a student’s educational placement \nprior to the development of an appropriate IEP at an IEP meeting constitutes a procedural \nviolation of the IDEA resulting in denial of FAPE.  Deal v. Hamilton County. Bd. of Educ., 392 \nF.3d 840, 855-57 (6th Cir. 2004); Spielberg v. Henrico County. Pub. Sch., 853 F.2d 256, 259 (4th \nCir. 1988). \nThe uncontroverted evidence in this case reveals that students entering CHDC have a pre-\ndetermined educational placement in an institutional setting, only interacting regularly with peers \nwho have disabilities.  There is no opportunity for CHDC students to attend any classes or extra-\ncurricular activities with their non-disabled peers and indeed no plan to facilitate any such \nactivities for any students now that the former agreement between CHDC and the Conway public \nschool district has lapsed.  See FOF ## 838, 839 & 842.  Indeed, as Defendants’ special \neducation consultant Derek Nye testified, CHDC’s practice is to try not to admit students who \nhave received educational services in a general education curriculum because that educational \nplacement option is not available to CHDC students. See FOF # 747.  CHDC’s special education \ncoordinator, who is not certified in special education, decides without an IEP meeting that the \n287 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 293 of 318\nstudents to be admitted to CHDC do not need (and will not receive) a full-time education \nprogram.  See FOF # 747. \nThis unilateral decision to deny CHDC students access to any classes or extra-curricular \nactivities with their non-disabled peers is an unlawful predetermination of CHDC students’ \neducational placements that deprives CHDC students of the full continuum required by the \nIDEA.  Circumventing the IEP team decision through a predetermination is a procedural \nviolation that deprives students of the educational benefits of interaction with their non-disabled \npeers required by the IDEA’s continuum of placements and least restrictive environment \nprovisions.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5); 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.107 & 300.115.   \n2.  CHDC Fails To Satisfy the IDEA’s Requirement That an LEA \nRepresentative and a Regular Education Teacher Attend IEP Meetings for \nCHDC Students. \n  The IDEA prescribes the required members of the team who must meet to evaluate \nspecial education needs for students with disabilities (the “IEP team”).  Specifically, 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1414(d)(1)(B) provides: \nThe term “individualized education program team” or “IEP Team” means a group \nof individuals composed of -- \n(i) the parents of a child with a disability; \n(ii) not less than one regular education teacher of such child (if the child is, or \nmay be, participating in the regular education environment);9 \n                                                 \n9   Regular education teachers play a critical role in developing an IEP: \nVery often, regular education teachers play a central role in the education of \nchildren with disabilities (H. Rep. No. 105-95, p. 103 (1997); S. Rep. No. 105-17, \np. 23 (1997)) and have important expertise regarding the general curriculum and \nthe general education environment.  Further, with the emphasis on involvement \nand progress in the general curriculum added by the IDEA Amendments of 1997, \nregular education teachers have an increasingly critical role (together with special \n288 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 294 of 318\n(iii) not less than one special education teacher, or where appropriate, at least one \nspecial education provider of such child; \n(iv) a representative of the local educational agency who- \n(I) is qualified to provide, or supervise the provision of, specially designed \ninstruction to meet the unique needs of children with disabilities; \n(II) is knowledgeable about the general curriculum; and \n(III)  is  knowledgeable  about  the  availability  of  resources  of  the  local \neducational agency; \n (v) an individual who can interpret the instructional implications of evaluation \nresults, who may be a member of the team described in clauses (ii) through (vi); \n(vi) at the discretion of the parent or the agency, other individuals who have \nknowledge or special expertise regarding the child, including related services \npersonnel as appropriate; and \n(vii) whenever appropriate, the child with a disability. \n20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added);10 see also 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.321(a)(2), \n300.324(a)(3), 300.324(b)(3). \nThe IDEA provides a limited exception under which certain required team members may \nbe exempt from meeting participation – but only if the student’s parents and the local educational \nagency consent in writing, and the missing team member submits, in writing to the parent and \nthe IEP Team, input into the development of the IEP prior to the meeting.  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1414(d)(1)(C).   \n                                                                                                                                                             \neducation and related services personnel) in implementing the program of FAPE \nfor most children with disabilities, as described in their IEPs. \nM.L. v.

Dist., 394 F.3d 634, 643 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing 34 C.F.R. § 300, App. A). \n10   The IDEA also provides that “[t]he regular education teacher of the child, as a \nmember of the IEP Team, shall, consistent with [§ 1414(d)(1)(C)], participate in the review and \nrevision of the IEP of the child.” 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(4)(B). \n289 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 295 of 318\n  The requirement for a regular education teacher to participate in students’ IEP meetings \nis mandatory if the student is or may be participating in the regular educational environment.  \nSee 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.321(a)(2), 300.324(a)(3), 300.324(b)(3); see also M.L., 394 F.3d at 643-44 \n(noting that the “plain meaning” of this provision of the IDEA “compels the conclusion that the \nrequirement that [at] least one regular education teacher be included on an IEP team, if the \nstudent may be participating in a regular classroom, is mandatory – not discretionary”). \n   Similarly, each IEP team meeting must include a local education agency representative \n(“LEA representative”) who is “qualified to provide, or supervise the provision of, specially \ndesigned instruction to meet the unique needs of children with disabilities, is knowledgeable \nabout the general curriculum, and is knowledgeable about the availability of resources of the \nlocal educational agency.”  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B)(iv).  This requirement also is mandatory, \nnot discretionary.  See id. \n  IEP teams for CHDC students routinely do not include an LEA representative.  See FOF \n## 736-737, 739-740.  This deficiency causes harm to CHDC students because there is no IEP \nteam participant that can fulfill the LEA representative’s role of facilitating CHDC student \naccess to the general education curriculum and the resources of the local educational agency.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B)(iv).  As a result, there is no meaningful discussion of less \nrestrictive alternatives for the student available in the public schools.   \n  Nor do IEP teams for CHDC students routinely include a regular education teacher.  See \nFOF ## 736, 738 & 740.  Defendants have contended that regular education teachers are not \nincluded because no CHDC student attends class with his or her non-disabled peers and it is \ntherefore not “likely” that the student would attend general education classes.  This is contrary to \n290 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 296 of 318\nthe statutory language requiring regular education teacher participation if a student “may be” \nparticipating in the regular education environment.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B).  This is also \ncontrary to documented evidence that CHDC is not the least restrictive environment for all \nstudents, and that some should be participating to some extent in the regular education \nenvironment.  See FOF ## 839-857.  The State cannot provide CHDC students with opportunities \nto attend class or extra-curricular activities with their non-disabled peers, see 34 C.F.R. \n§§ 300.107, 300.115, if regular education teachers and an LEA representative do not routinely \nparticipate in CHDC student IEP meetings.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B).   \n3.  CHDC IEPs Do Not Comply with the IDEA’s Requirement for Appropriate, \nMeasurable Goals and Objectives. \nThe IDEA requires that each student’s IEP contain “a statement of measurable annual \ngoals, including academic and functional goals.”  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II); see also 34 \nC.F.R. § 300.320(a)(2).  This requirement is important because IEPs must address all areas \naffecting students’ ability to learn, including both academic and functional deficits, and must \nspecify how goals will be measured, so that it is clear whether educational interventions are \nworking for the student.  IEPs must also contain appropriate, measurable transition goals based \nupon age appropriate transition assessments related to training, education, employment, and, \nwhere appropriate, independent living skills and the transition services needed to reach these \ngoals.  34 C.F.R. § 300.320(b).   \nMost courts have addressed claims regarding an alleged lack of measurable goals as a \nprocedural violation.  See James D., 642 F. Supp. 2d at 817 n.9  (citing Edwin K. v. Jackson, No. \n01-7115, 2002 WL 1433722, at *13 (N.D. Ill. July 02, 2002); Stanley C. v. M.S.D. of Sw. Allen \nCounty. Sch., 628 F.

May 15, 2009) (analyzing alleged deficiencies in IEPs, including \nalleged lack of measurable goals, under the Rowley substantive analysis); Kevin T. v. Elmhurst \nCmty. Sch. Dist. No. 205, No. 01-005, 2002 WL 433061, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 20, 2002) (same). \n  The testimony of the United States’ special education expert, the ADE Special Education \nDirector, and Defendants’ special education consultants demonstrates that CHDC’s IEPs do not \ncontain appropriate, measurable goals and objectives.  See FOF ## 764-773.  Dr. Thibadeau’s \ntestimony illustrates and provides examples of how CHDC’s limited IEP goals and objectives are \nnot sufficient in number or quality and are not measurable, depriving students of educational \nbenefits.  See FOF ## 765, 767-769.  Although each IEP must include goals “designed to (aa) \nmeet the child’s needs that result from the child’s disability to enable the child to be involved in \nand make progress in the general education curriculum; and (bb) meet each of the child’s other \neducational needs that result from the child’s disability,” 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II), some \nIEPs only include two objectives for an entire year.  See FOF # 767.  Other IEPs include only \nfour objectives, two of which begin only after the other two are completed.  See FOF # 767.   \n  ADE also criticized CHDC for limiting its IEP development to academic goals.  See FOF \n# 766.  Consistent with Dr. Thibadeau’s opinion, ADE also found that in many cases, CHDC IEP \ngoals and objectives are poorly written, the objectives often do not relate to the goals, and the \nobjectives do not address the specific needs of the student.  For example, ADE found that student \n292 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 298 of 318\nBM’s IEP contained the same objectives two years in a row, and those objectives only addressed \nthe use of a wheelchair.  See FOF # 771.  ADE also found that student CA’s IEP goals and \nobjectives had little connection to each other and to CA’s needs, as the student had a two-year-\nold functional speech level and could only say a few words but was supposed to be “learning the \nlanguage of algebra.”  See FOF # 771. \n  Defendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, concurs with Dr. Thibadeau that at \nleast some CHDC IEP objectives are not clear, particularly with regard to the conditions under \nwhich tasks were to be performed.  Mr. Nye acknowledges that CHDC education staff would \nbenefit from training regarding the writing of IEP goals and objectives.  See FOF # 772.  \nDefendants’ second special education consultant, Dr. Bruce Gale, testified that goal writing \nappears to be the biggest problem with CHDC IEPs.  See FOF # 773. \n  CHDC IEP transition goals also violate IDEA requirements because they are neither \nappropriate nor measurable.  CHDC students’ transition plans do not clearly specify what skills \nthe student is learning or how student performance will be measured.  See FOF ## 824-829.  \nEven Defendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, found that CHDC transition plans \nlack clarity and fail to contain measurable goals, as required by the IDEA.  See FOF # 825.  \nConsistent with Dr. Thibadeau, ADE also found that CHDC students’ IEP transition plans did \nnot include appropriate, measurable post-secondary goals based on an age-appropriate transition \nassessment related to training, education, employment, and, where appropriate, independent \nliving skills, as required by the IDEA.  See FOF # 836.  \n   All of these deficiencies in IEP goals and objectives violate the IDEA’s procedural \nrequirements and deprive CHDC students of educational benefits because students cannot \n293 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 299 of 318\nreceive comprehensive services if their IEPs do not map out the required level of services to \nmeet their academic, functional, and transition needs and provide the required mechanism for \nmeasuring progress.   \n4.  CHDC IEP Teams Fail To Consider IDEA-Required Factors in Developing \nStudents’ IEPs. \n  The IDEA prescribes certain required factors that IEP teams must consider in developing \nstudents’ IEPs, including students’ academic, developmental, functional, and communication \nneeds.  34 C.F.R. § 300.324(a).  The evidence demonstrates that CHDC IEP teams do not \nconsider all of the IDEA-required factors, resulting in IEPs that do not provide comprehensive \nservices to students.  CHDC assessment tools do not address all necessary areas of development \nto enable accurate assessment of present levels of performance and appropriate development of \ngoals and objectives because these assessment tools fail to assess functional skill development in \nareas such as communication, self-help, domestic, leisure, and vocational skills; skill \ndevelopment in these areas is particularly important for older students.  34 C.F.R. \n§ 300.324(a)(1)(iv); see FOF ## 782-783. \n  The IDEA also requires that assessments be administered in a manner that meets the \ncommunication style of the individual who is being assessed.  34 C.F.R. § 300.304(c)(1)(ii).  \nCHDC has not met this obligation because it has not offered these assessment accommodations \nto all students with disabilities.  For example, a CHDC student with a visual impairment did not \nreceive an assessment because it was typically offered in pictoral form, and a CHDC student \nwith a hearing impairment did not receive a different assessment because a sign language \ninterpreter was not available.  See FOF # 787. \n294 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 300 of 318\n5.  CHDC Fails To Ensure That CHDC Students Receive Regular or Alternate \nStatewide or Districtwide Assessments, as Required by the IDEA. \nThe IDEA, in addition to the No Child Left Behind Act, requires that students with \ndisabilities participate in statewide assessments to the same extent as their non-disabled peers – \nby participating in:  (1) general statewide assessments without accommodations; (2) general \nstatewide assessments with accommodations; or (3) alternate assessments.  See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1412(a)(16) (requiring that “[a]ll children with disabilities are included in all general State and \ndistrictwide assessment programs, including assessments described under [20 U.S.C. § 6311], \nwith appropriate accommodations and alternate assessments where necessary and as indicated in \ntheir respective individualized education programs”).  To the extent that schools deem alternate \nassessments more appropriate for students with disabilities than general assessments, alternate \nassessments must be “aligned with the State’s challenging academic content standards and \nchallenging student academic achievement standards” and “measure the achievement of children \nwith disabilities against those standards.”  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(16).    \n  CHDC students do not receive:  (1) general statewide assessments without \naccommodations; (2) general statewide assessments with accommodations; or (3) alternate \nassessments.  See FOF # 780.  The State’s failure to ensure that each CHDC student participates \nin statewide and districtwide assessment programs violates the IDEA and deprives CHDC \nstudents of the opportunity to access and benefit from the State’s challenging academic content \nstandards and student academic achievement standards.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(16); see also \nLeighty v. Laurel Sch. Dist., 457 F. Supp. 2d 546, 561 (W.D. Pa. 2006) (citing 20 U.S.C. § \n1412(a)(16) and noting that “Congress has made it clear that, to the extent possible, disabled \nchildren are to be educated and assessed in the same manner as their nondisabled peers”).  \nWithout these required statewide and districtwide assessments, there is no indication of whether \n295 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 301 of 318\nCHDC students are accessing and benefitting from the State’s academic standards, and students’ \neducational opportunities suffer. \n6.  CHDC Routinely Fails To Invite a Representative of the Agency or \nAgencies Likely To Provide Transition Services To Assist CHDC Youth in \nTransitioning to Postsecondary Educational Services or to a Less Restrictive \nEnvironment. \nThe IDEA requires that, to the extent appropriate, schools invite a representative of any \npublic agency that is likely to provide transition services to a student’s IEP meeting if transition \nservices are to be discussed, with the student or parent’s consent (when the student has not \nreached the age of majority).  34 C.F.R. § 300.321(b).  Absent outside agency representation, \nthere is no individual at the IEP meetings with the knowledge of and ability to facilitate students’ \ntransition from secondary school to post-secondary adult life, which is particularly harmful for \nstudents such as those at CHDC, who have ongoing needs for comprehensive services and \nsupports. \n  Both the United States’ special education expert and Defendants’ special education \nconsultant Bruce Gale found that outside agency representatives do not participate in IEP \nmeetings for CHDC students, as required by the IDEA.  See FOF ## 831-832.  This deficiency \ndeprives CHDC students of important opportunities to access services that may be provided by \noutside agencies to facilitate postsecondary education or education in a less restrictive \nenvironment.   \nADE also cited CHDC for non-compliance with due process standards because, pursuant \nto ADE’s evaluation, “[t]here was insufficient evidence” that notices to parents identify any \nother agency or agencies that will be invited to send a representative to CHDC student IEP \nmeetings to discuss transition services.  See FOF # 834.  Without notifying parents of the outside \n296 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 302 of 318\nagency or agencies who may be invited to send a representative to participate in IEP meeting \ndiscussions regarding transition services, CHDC cannot obtain the required parental consent for \nthe agency representative’s participation.  As a result, CHDC students are deprived of a key \nvoice in the conversation identifying appropriate transition services.   \nB.  CHDC Students’ IEPs and Services Provided Therein Are Not Reasonably \nCalculated To Enable CHDC Students To Receive Educational Benefits. \n  Under Rowley, even if the State has complied with the procedural requirements of the \nIDEA, FAPE is not met unless “the individualized educational program developed through the \nAct’s procedures [is] reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.”  \n458 U.S. at 206-07; see also Lathrop R-II Sch. Dist., 611 F.3d at 424 (applying two-step Rowley \nanalysis to IDEA case); Gill v. Columbia 93 Sch. Dist., 217 F.3d 1027, 1035 (8th Cir. 2000) \n(“The standard to judge whether an IEP is appropriate under IDEA is whether it offers \ninstruction and supportive services reasonably calculated to provide some educational benefit to \nthe student for whom it is designed.”).    \n  The education offered to CHDC students is not reasonably calculated to provide \neducation benefit in that:  (1) students are not all in the least restrictive environment, see FOF \n## 837-859, and CHDC services do not target skill development to allow progress toward more \nintegrated settings, see FOF # 860-861; (2) related services necessary to allow students to benefit \nfrom instruction are not offered to all students, see FOF ## 788-822; (3) assistive technology \nnecessary for students to benefit from instruction is not always functional, see FOF ## 806-810; \n(4) students are not receiving adequate hours of instruction, see FOF ## 741-763; (5) transition \nplanning does not address student needs and lacks outside agency participation, see FOF ## 823-\n836; and (6) teachers lack adequate training and supervision to appropriately implement \n297 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 303 of 318\nstudents’ IEPs and collect reliable data regarding students’ skill acquisition and behavior \nreduction.  See FOF ## 862-873.   \n1.  CHDC Students Are Not All Receiving Education and Extra-Curricular \nActivities in the Least Restrictive Environments Appropriate to Their Needs. \n  Educating children in the least restrictive environment in which they can receive an \nappropriate education is one of the IDEA’s most important substantive requirements, “reflecting \n[the IDEA’s] ‘strong preference’ that disabled children attend regular classes with non-disabled \nchildren and a presumption in favor of placement in the public schools.”  T.F. v. Special Sch. \nDist. of St. Louis County, 449 F.3d 816, 820 (8th Cir. 2006) (quoting S.D., 88 F.3d at 561).  The \nIDEA explicitly requires that, “[t]o the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities . . \n. are educated with children who are not disabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or \nother removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only \nwhen the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes \nwith the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.”  20 U.S.C. \n§ 1412(a)(5)(A); see also 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.114 & 300.117.   \nIn interpreting this statutory requirement, the Eighth Circuit has stated:  “Children who \ncan be mainstreamed should be mainstreamed, if not for the entire day, then for part of the day; \nsimilarly, children should be provided with an education close to their home, and residential \nplacements should be resorted to only if these attempts fail or are plainly untenable.”  T.F., 449 \nF.3d at 820 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because “the IDEA creates a preference for \nmainstream education,” placement in a segregated setting is appropriate “only if the services that \n298 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 304 of 318\nmake segregated placement superior cannot be feasibly provided in a non-segregated setting.”   \nPachl v. Seagren, 453 F.3d 1064, 1067 (8th Cir. 2006) (internal quotations omitted).11   \n  The IDEA requires that states educate students with disabilities alongside students who \ndo not have disabilities whenever possible.  Rowley, 458 U.S. at 202.  As the Rowley Court \nnoted, “[w]hen that ‘mainstreaming’ preference of the Act has been met and a child is being \neducated in the regular classrooms of a public school system, the system itself monitors the \neducational progress of the child.”  Id. at 202-03.  This is because “[r]egular examinations are \nadministered, grades are awarded, and yearly advancement to higher grade levels is permitted for \nthose children who attain an adequate knowledge of the course material.”  Id. at 203.  \nAccordingly, “[t]he grading and advancement system thus constitutes an important factor in \ndetermining educational benefit.”  Id.  Similarly, the IDEA articulates the purpose of integration \nby explaining that the best outcomes for children with disabilities result from “having high \nexpectations for such children and ensuring their access to the general education curriculum in \nthe regular classroom, to the maximum extent possible.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(5)(A). \n                                                 \n11   Pachl notes that removing a child from the mainstream setting is permissible \nwhen “the handicapped child would not benefit from mainstreaming, when any marginal benefits \nreceived from mainstreaming are far outweighed by the benefits gained from services which \ncould not feasibly be provided in the non-segregated setting, and when the handicapped child is a \ndisruptive force in the non-segregated setting.”  453 F.3d at 1068 (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  To the extent Defendants claim that students are at CHDC for behavioral reasons, the \nEighth Circuit has held that removal of a dangerous child with a disability from her current \neducational placement due to behavioral issues must be supported by evidence “(1) that \nmaintaining the child in that placement is substantially likely to result in injury either to himself \nor herself, or to others, and (2) that the school district has done all that it reasonably can to \nreduce the risk that the child will cause injury.”  Light v. Parkway C-2 Sch. Dist., 41 F.3d 1223, \n1228 (8th Cir. 1994).  The records produced by Defendants do not include evidence supporting \nthese exceptions, particularly considering that CHDC students are not mainstreamed to any \nextent, unlike in Pachl, which involved a dispute between 70% and 100% mainstreaming.  See \nPachl, 453 F.3d at 1068-69. \n \n299 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 305 of 318\n  At CHDC, however, students are not benefitting from instruction alongside non-disabled \npeers.  CHDC IEPs do not indicate a grade level, and students do not receive grades as they do in \npublic schools.  See FOF # 777.  Students also no longer have the opportunity to participate in \nstatewide and districtwide assessments, see FOF # 780; 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(16), and IEPs are \nnot appropriately modified when students exhibit lack of progress.  See FOF ## 774-775; M.M. \nv. Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 512 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir. 2008) (“The IDEA required the District to \nrevise [the student’s] IEP as appropriate to address any lack of expected progress toward the \nannual goals and in the general education curriculum.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The \nundisputed fact that no CHDC student attends a single class or extracurricular activity with his or \nher non-disabled peers establishes that CHDC students are not educated in the least restrictive \nenvironment, in violation of the IDEA.  See FOF # 838.  Nor is there any indication from any of \nCHDC students’ IEPs that IEP teams conducted the required analysis of whether “the services \nthat make segregated placement superior cannot be feasibly provided in a non-segregated \nsetting.”  Pachl, 453 F.3d at 1067-68.   \n  Instead, CHDC teachers have noted that CHDC is not the least restrictive environment \nfor educating all CHDC students, see FOF ## 848-850, and IEP teams routinely and unlawfully \n“check the boxes” justifying the most restrictive placement possible for CHDC students, without \nany explanation of how the Eighth Circuit’s required showing is met.  See Indep. Sch. Dist. No. \n284 v. A.C., 258 F.3d 769, 774 (8th Cir. 2001) (“We have reversed a state decision concerning an \nIEP where no educational reasons were given for placing a disabled child in a separate learning \nenvironment.”) (emphasis added).12  This requirement cannot be overridden for the convenience \n                                                 \n12   Notably, the missing reason must be “educational,” not behavioral, as any \npurported reason for educating CHDC students solely at CHDC appears to be.  See A.C., 258 \nF.3d at 774. \n300 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 306 of 318\nof administrators.  See Pachl, 453 F.3d at 1070 (“As the Pachls note, under the IDEA, state \neducational agencies such as the Department have affirmative responsibilities to ensure that the \nprovisions of the IDEA requiring placement in the least restrictive environment are \nimplemented.”); T.F., 449 F.3d at 821 (“[T]he school district should have had the opportunity, \nand to an extent had the duty, to try these less restrictive alternatives before recommending a \nresidential placement.”) (emphasis added).  \nStudents’ emotional or behavioral issues, or an apparent lack of community mental health \nservices, cannot be an excuse to institutionalize youth and educate those same youth in the most \nrestrictive environment; rather, students must be provided with appropriate supports and services \nin order to benefit from educational services in the least restrictive educational environment.  See \n20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(i) (requiring an IEP team to, “in the case of a child whose behavior \nimpedes the child’s learning and that of others, consider the use of positive behavioral \ninterventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior”).  In addition to the \nIDEA’s requirement for provision of appropriate behavioral supports and services, the IDEA \nspecifically requires that education be provided in the least restrictive environment.  Pachl, 453 \nF.3d at 1067 (noting IDEA incorporates a clear “preference for mainstream education”).   \n  CHDC students also do not participate in extracurricular activities with their non-disabled \npeers on a regular basis.  See FOF # 838.  Federal law requires that, “[i]n providing or arranging \nfor the provision of nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities, including meals, \nrecess periods, and the services and activities set forth in [34 C.F.R.] § 300.107, each public \nagency must ensure that each child with a disability participates with nondisabled children in the \nextracurricular services and activities to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of that \nchild.”  34 C.F.R. § 300.117.  Such nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities \n301 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 307 of 318\ninclude “counseling services, athletics, transportation, health services, recreational activities, \nspecial interest groups or clubs sponsored by the public agency, referrals to agencies that provide \nassistance to individuals with disabilities, and employment of students, including both \nemployment by the public agency and assistance in making outside employment available.”  34 \nC.F.R. § 300.107(b).  CHDC’s predetermined placement of all students at the CHDC school, \nwith only sporadic interaction with their non-disabled peers, falls woefully short of satisfying the \nrequirements of federal law, and CHDC students continue to not receive the IDEA-mandated \neducational benefit of interaction with their non-disabled peers. \n2.  CHDC Does Not Provide Related Services, Including \nCommunication/Audiology and Behavioral/Psychology Services, to All \nStudents Who Require Such Services. \nThe IDEA requires that students receive any related services that are necessary for them \nto access and benefit from education. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400(d)(1)(A), 1401(9), 1401(26)(a).  \nRelated services include “transportation, and such developmental, corrective, and other \nsupportive services [such as] speech-language pathology and audiology services, interpreting \nservices, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, recreation, including \ntherapeutic recreation, social work services, school nurse services . . ., counseling services, \nincluding rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical services.”  \n20 U.S.C. § 1401(26)(a).  Provision of all appropriate related services is a requirement under the \nIDEA for which denial can result in the failure to provide FAPE.  Neosho R-V Sch. Dist. v. \nClark, 315 F.3d 1022, 1026-30 (8th Cir. 2003). \nCHDC does not provide related services to all students who require them, including \nspeech services, communication device implementation, psychological/behavioral services, and \nsign language interpretative services.  See FOF ## 789-794, 802-806, 811-820.  Related services \n302 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 308 of 318\nalso are not integrated with other CHDC services, resulting in additional gaps in services to \nCHDC students and in insufficient information shared among educational staff regarding the \nefficacy of services that are in place.  See FOF ## 795-801.  ADE itself found numerous \nexamples of CHDC students whose education files indicated that they were not receiving all \nrequired related services, such as communication and behavioral/mental health services, \nincluding students BR, BB, KF, CW, and MB.  See FOF ## 790-791, 814. \nThe IDEA requires that, if a student’s behavior or other special factor impacts his or her \nlearning, the student’s IEP must address that need.  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(i) (The IDEA \nrequires an IEP team to, “in the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child’s learning and \nthat of others, consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other \nstrategies, to address that behavior.”).  Schools deprive students of educational benefits, and \nviolate the IDEA, when they fail to develop and implement behavior management plans as \nappropriate.  See, e.g., Neosho R-V Sch. Dist., 315 F.3d at 1029-30.   \nAccording to CHDC IEPs, many CHDC students were placed at CHDC because of their \nbehaviors.  See FOF # 812.  CHDC IEPs also indicate that students have behavioral problems \ncalling for behavioral services, yet these IEPs do not list any such services being considered or \nprovided.  See FOF # 792.  Nor does CHDC use functional behavior assessments with all CHDC \nstudents and, to the extent CHDC uses functional behavioral assessments, they are not \ncomprehensive in scope.  See FOF # 812.  In addition, despite the fact that a significant \npercentage of youth admitted to CHDC were admitted in part because of behavioral problems, \nCHDC does not even offer any counseling or psychotherapy services.  See FOF # 794. \n303 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 309 of 318\n  Consistent with Dr. Thibadeau’s observations, ADE also noted that in most cases, \nstudents’ education files do not include behavior plans or goals and objectives to address \nbehavior in the education setting.  See FOF # 813.  ADE also found that CHDC did not \nnecessarily address problem behaviors in the classroom for students who were on shortened \nschool days reportedly for behavior issues.  See FOF # 813. \n  All students who require communication skills development are entitled to and should be \nreceiving such related services; otherwise, these students are not receiving FAPE.  20 U.S.C. \n§§ 1414(d)(3)(B)(iv), 1401(2), 1401(26)(a).  Both Dr. Thibadeau and ADE found a number of \nCHDC students who should be receiving communication services but are not.  See FOF ## 802-\n810.   Only 7 of the 21 non-verbal school-aged children at CHDC have augmentative \ncommunication devices.  See FOF # 807.  For the small number of CHDC students provided \nassistive technology, CHDC staff does not encourage the use of these devices and, consequently, \nstudents do not consistently use them.  See FOF # 807.  ADE also found instances of CHDC \nstudents not having access in the classroom to their alternative or augmentative communication \ndevices, such as communication books or other communication devices.  See FOF # 808.   \n3.  CHDC Fails To Ensure That Hearing Aids Worn by Students with Hearing \nImpairments Are Functioning Properly, as Required by the IDEA. \n  The IDEA and its implementing regulations require that each public agency ensure that \nhearing aids worn in school by children with hearing impairments are functioning properly. \n34 C.F.R. § 300.113(a); J.W. v. Fresno Unified Sch. Dist., 626 F.3d 431, 433 (9th Cir. 2010).  \nStudents with hearing impairments need consistent access to properly functioning assistive \ntechnology to access and benefit from educational services.  Clearly, if a student cannot hear the \neducational instruction being presented, he or she cannot benefit from it.   \n304 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 310 of 318\n  As demonstrated by ADE’s findings and related testimony, CHDC fails to ensure that \nhearing aids worn by students with hearing impairments are functioning properly.  See FOF # \n809-810.  This violation has deprived CHDC students with hearing impairments of educational \nbenefits, including students LW, JB, and BB.  See FOF # 809. ADE also found no evidence at \nCHDC of follow-up regarding poor vision and hearing and no evidence of formal augmentative \nalternative communication assessments in CHDC education files.  See FOF # 810.  \n4.  CHDC’s Provision of a Shortened School Day for All Students Violates the \nIDEA. \nCHDC’s decision to provide a shortened school day to all students, regardless of their \nindividual needs, violates the IDEA.  CHDC students are entitled to a school day that is just as \nsubstantial as their non-disabled peers.  Ark. Admin. Code § 005.18.2-2.15.3.  Accordingly, \nCHDC students are entitled to a six-hour instructional day.  Ark. Admin. Code § 005.15.14-3.  \nAn instructional day means the amount of time spent engaged in instructional activities and \nexcludes lunch, recess and nonacademic or extracurricular activity periods, unless such activities \nare considered as special education instruction on the individual student’s IEP.  Ark. Admin. \nCode § 005.18.2-2.43.  If CHDC students receive special education and related services that fail \nto meet the “standards of the State educational agency,” they are not receiving a FAPE.  20 \nU.S.C. § 1401(9)(B).  The undisputed evidence shows that no CHDC student receives six hours \nof planned instruction, as defined by Arkansas law.  Rather, CHDC’s planned instructional time \nof 1.5 to 2.5 hours per day falls woefully short of the required 6-hour school day for students \nwith and without disabilities.  See FOF ## 741-763.   Defendants’ failure to provide all CHDC \nstudents with an instructional day that complies with Arkansas state law violates the IDEA.   \n305 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 311 of 318\n  CHDC has determined that no student will receive a full day of educational instruction \nand has instead assigned all students to shortened school days of between 1.5 and 2.5 hours.  See \nFOF ## 744-745.  CHDC’s uncertified special education coordinator separately admitted to \nDefendants’ special education consultant that she pre-determines that new school-aged \nadmissions to CHDC do not need (and will not receive) a full-time education program.  See FOF \n# 747.  This blanket policy violates students’ IDEA rights to an education that meets the State \nEducation Agency’s standards.  As ADE found, CHDC fails to make individualized \ndeterminations of the appropriate length of an instructional day for any of its students, all of \nwhom are placed on shortened school days in violation of the IDEA.  See FOF ## 750-752.   \n5.  CHDC’s Transition Planning and Transition Services Do Not Satisfy IDEA \nRequirements. \nThe IDEA requires that, once a student with disabilities turns 16 years old, schools \nprovide a coordinated set of services to support the student as he or she moves from secondary \neducation to post-secondary life, including vocational training, independent living skills, and \nsupported employment.  34 C.F.R. § 300.320(b).  Transition services for CHDC students do not \naddress the needs of students who are 16 years or older because CHDC students’ IEPs do not \ncontain appropriate, measurable goals for transition services by failing to clearly specify what \nskills the student is learning or how student performance will be measured.  See FOF ## 824-\n829.  Even Defendants’ special education consultant, Derek Nye, found that CHDC transition \nplans lack clarity and fail to contain measurable goals, as required by the IDEA.  See FOF # 825. \n  Further, CHDC makes little attempt to engage outside agencies in planning for students’ \ntransition to adult life, often failing to request parental permission and always failing to advise \nparents of the importance of granting permission for outside agency attendance at IEP meetings.  \n306 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 312 of 318\nSee 34 C.F.R. § 300.321(b); FOF # 832.  As a result, representatives of outside agencies needed \nfor transition do not generally participate in transition planning for CHDC students.  See FOF \n## 832-836.  Without outside agency contact, parents, guardians, and students are not aware of \nthe range of services available in their communities, and service providers do not know about the \nneeds of CHDC students who may need services upon their transition.  See FOF # 833.  Lack of \noutside agency involvement in transition services risks students’ ability to access and benefit \nfrom services to transition them from secondary education to adult life, which is particularly \nimportant for students who need comprehensive supports and services.  See FOF # 833. \n6.  Education Staff Lack Adequate Training and Supervision To Appropriately \nImplement Students’ IEPs. \nEducation staff must be appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, and those \npersonnel must have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.  34 \nC.F.R. § 300.156(a).   To that end, CHDC must take measurable steps to recruit, hire, train, and \nretain “highly qualified” personnel to provide special education and related services to children \nwith disabilities.  34 C.F.R. § 300.156(d).  CHDC teachers lack adequate training and \nsupervision to appropriately implement students’ IEPs and collect reliable data regarding \nstudents’ skill acquisition and behavior reduction.  On-site observations revealed that teachers \nwere not able to engage students in learning because they were not familiar with student \npreferences and interests.  See FOF # 863.  CHDC teacher Throndia Smith confirms that CHDC \ndoes not require teachers to receive training in areas relevant to the needs of the students they \nteach or train teachers on conducting preference assessments.  See FOF ## 864-865.   \nCHDC related services staff lack training in special education, and education staff lack \ntraining in related services.  See FOF # 801.  When ADE provided training to CHDC psychology \n307 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 313 of 318\nstaff regarding their IDEA obligations in July 2010, staff indicated a lack of understanding \nregarding their responsibilities and appeared to be under the mistaken impression that they were \nonly charged with meeting ICF/MR CMS funding standards.  See FOF # 801.  Defendants’ \nspecial education consultant, Dr. Gale, agrees that CHDC would benefit from more in-service \ntraining in understanding the requirements of the IDEA.  See FOF # 866. \nCHDC must adopt effective procedures for acquiring and disseminating to teachers and \nadministrators significant information from educational research, demonstrations, and similar \nprojects, and for adopting, where appropriate, promising educational practices developed through \nsuch projects.  20 U.S.C. § 1232e.  ADE found insufficient evidence that CHDC has adopted the \nrequired promising educational practices for the provision of special education instruction.  See \nFOF # 870.  In sum, CHDC education staff are not appropriately and adequately prepared and \ntrained, with the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities, as required by \nthe IDEA.  See FOF ## 862-873. \nC.  CHDC’s Failure To Meet the Standards of the State Educational Agency \nEstablishes an Independent Basis for Findings of IDEA Violations. \nUnder the IDEA, in order to provide FAPE, a disabled student’s IEP must “meet the \nstandards of the State educational agency.”  20 U.S.C. § 1401(9)(B).  ADE recently cited CHDC \nfor failing to make FAPE available to all students with identified disabilities, as required by \nfederal and state law.  See FOF ## 727-728.  ADE found many of the same IDEA deficiencies as \nthe United States’ special education expert. \nADE based its determination that CHDC fails to provide FAPE on 15 areas of non-\ncompliance with federal and state special education requirements, including four findings of non-\ncompliance regarding IEP requirements.  Regarding IEPs, ADE found that:  (1) CHDC fails to \n308 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 314 of 318\nconsider special factors that impede a student’s learning or that of others when developing the \nstudent’s IEP; (2) IEP components do not address the unique needs of individual students; \n(3) CHDC transition plans are neither based on age appropriate transition assessments nor \ndescribe appropriate measurable post-secondary goals; and (4) parents are not informed of \nCHDC student progress toward meeting annual goals and short term objectives on a quarterly \nbasis.  See FOF # 730.  CHDC’s failure to meet the standards of the State educational agency \nindependently establishes IDEA violations pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9)(B). \nIn sum, Defendants unlawfully deprive CHDC students of educational benefits because:  \n(1) CHDC does not offer students a full continuum of educational placements; (2) neither an \nLEA representative nor a regular education teacher routinely attends CHDC IEP meetings; \n(3) CHDC IEPs do not contain appropriate, measurable goals and objectives; (4) CHDC IEP \nteams fail to consider IDEA-required factors in developing students’ IEPs; (5) CHDC students \ndo not receive regular or alternate statewide or districtwide assessments; and (6) CHDC routinely \nfails to invite agency representatives to assist CHDC youth in transitioning to postsecondary \nservices.  \nThe evidence also proves that CHDC student IEPs and the services provided therein are \nnot reasonably calculated to enable CHDC students to receive educational benefits because:  \n(1) students do not spend adequate time in special education classes; (2) related services are not \nprovided to all students who require them; (3) transition planning does not address student needs \nand lacks outside agency participation; (4) students are not being educated in the least restrictive \nenvironment; (5) CHDC services do not target skill development to allow progress toward more \nintegrated settings; and (6) education staff lack adequate training and supervision to \nappropriately implement students’ IEPs. \n309 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 315 of 318\nFinally, Defendants violate the IDEA because CHDC’s educational services do not meet \nthe standards of the state educational agency - ADE. \nXVI.  CONCLUSION \n  Defendants’ system for delivering care and services to CHDC residents illegally \ncondemns individuals at CHDC to lifelong institutionalization.  The vast majority of people \ncurrently living at CHDC were first admitted as children, many of them not even ten years old.  \nOnce admitted, most CHDC residents spend the rest of their lives within the confines of the \ninstitution, never re-joining the communities and families from which they came, nor given a \nmeaningful opportunity to maximize their capacity for independent, self-directed living.  CHDC \ncurrently admits more children than adults, discharges just a handful of people to more integrated \nsettings each year, and plans for the long-term stay of virtually all of its other residents, even the \nyoungest.   \nDefendants promote this lifelong institutionalization by depriving residents and their \nguardians of information that is critical to their ability to make informed decisions about whether \nCHDC is the most integrated setting appropriate to residents’ needs.  An objective, reasonable \nassessment – one that is based solely on a resident’s specific needs and capabilities and identifies \nthe particular services necessary to meet those needs and maximize those capabilities – is \nessential for families making important, often difficult, placement decisions.  Without \nindependent, reasonable assessments, guardians naturally are inclined to maintain the status quo \nof continued institutionalization, community providers are unable to tailor services to the needs \nof those currently institutionalized, and residents spend their lives confined to CHDC.  This \ndiscriminatory system that Defendants have premised on the lifelong institutionalization of \n310 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 316 of 318\npeople with disabilities cannot be reconciled with the ADA’s mandate that Defendants serve \npeople with disabilities in the most integrated setting. \n  Defendants further seal residents’ fate of lifelong institutionalization through their overall \nfailure to provide adequate care and services at CHDC, which causes serious harm, and even \ndeath, to residents.  Children, the most vulnerable to the debilitating effects of \ninstitutionalization, are denied educational services to which they are entitled and thereby \ndeprived of the opportunity for training and skill-development that would assist them in leading \nmore integrated, productive lives. \n  Defendants likewise fail to provide CHDC adults with supports and services that would \nenable them to live as independently as possible.  Instead, Defendants subject CHDC residents to \nextreme forms of physical restraint for unnecessary and prolonged periods of time, as well as \nharmful and excessive psychiatric medications, in violation of residents’ constitutional rights -\nand in lieu of professional treatment that would maximize residents’ capacities for independent \nliving.  Defendants also deny CHDC residents necessary medical care, including nutritional and \nphysical supports, and fail to protect residents from avoidable injuries and other harm, in \nviolation of the Constitution.  Rather than provide CHDC residents access to treatment that \nwould maximize their capabilities, Defendants expose them to conditions that threaten their lives \nand safety. \nThus, while confining individuals in a harmful, debilitating facility, Defendants deprive \nresidents the opportunity to live in the most integrated setting appropriate for the residents’ \nneeds, thereby ensuring that Defendants’ unlawful, harmful, discriminatory system for providing \nservices to individuals with developmental disabilities will continue. \n311 \n \n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 218   Filed 02/10/11   Page 317 of 318\n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n            THOMAS E.

INTRODUCTION \n  Defendants, the State of Arkansas, The Arkansas Department of Human Services, the \nArkansas Division of Developmental Disabilities Services, and the Conway Human \nDevelopment Center, as well as official-capacity Defendants Mike Beebe, John Selig, James C. \nGreen, and Calvin Price (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Defendants,” “the State,” or \n“State of Arkansas”) set forth the following:   \nAs described more fully herein, Plaintiff bears the burden of proving that Defendants are \nviolating the Fourteenth Amendment rights of CHDC residents, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, and the Individuals with Disabilities Act.  Plaintiff did not meet that evidentiary burden at \ntrial.  Further, Plaintiff failed to request any specific relief from the Court and offered no \nevidence at trial in support of any type of relief.  Defendants submitted evidence at trial that its \nprograms and services may be impacted by any relief sought by Plaintiff, and Defendants reserve \ntheir right to assert a fundamental alteration defense to the extent that Plaintiff attempts to \nrequest specific relief from the Court. \nBased on flawed methodologies, unsubstantiated assumptions, and misrepresentations of \nfact, the Plaintiff’s experts offered unreliable and unfounded opinions, and in some instances \nbald misrepresentations, about the services provided by the State of Arkansas to its \ndevelopmentally disabled citizens at the Conway Human Development Center.  None of \nPlaintiff’s experts conducted a scientifically valid or objective review of services at CHDC.  \nPlaintiff’s experts also could not identify any relevant, accepted professional standards to support \ntheir claims, demonstrating that their opinions were nothing more that personal, idiosyncratic \nopinions.  In contrast, the experts testifying for the State of Arkansas provided reasonable, \nscientifically valid, and factually accurate opinions regarding the services at CHDC.  As \n  3\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 4 of 383\ndescribed more fully below, Defendants’ experts demonstrated that all relevant accepted \nprofessional standards are met or exceeded at CHDC.  \nPlaintiff similarly failed to demonstrate any discrimination by Defendants on the basis of \na disability.  Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that any specific school-aged resident has been \ndenied a free and appropriate public education or is not being served in the least restrictive \nenvironment.  Plaintiff offered no evidence that any guardian of a CHDC resident wants his or \nher ward to be discharged from CHDC.  Plaintiff bore the burden of demonstrating that evidence \nand demonstrating that Defendants failed to provide such accommodation.  Similarly, Plaintiff \noffered no evidence that CHDC’s treating professionals have failed to exercise professional \njudgment about where CHDC’s residents should receive services, or regarding any other \ncomponent of care services provided to Center residents.  The Plaintiff has not specified what \nrelief it seeks, and likewise, the record does not support any argument that Plaintiff is entitled to \nany relief whatsoever.  Defendants submit that this Court should resist Plaintiff’s attempt to force \nit to assume the management of the State of Arkansas’ provision of services to the \ndevelopmentally disabled. \n \nII.  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE CONWAY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT CENTER \nThe Conway Human Development Center (“CHDC”) serves approximately 500 \ndevelopmentally disabled individuals.  Tr. at 763, 764 (J. Green).  Ninety percent of CHDC \nresidents are severely or profoundly intellectually disabled. Tr. at 5805, 5810 (Walsh).  \nApproximately 72% percent of CHDC residents have profound developmental disabilities; 18% \nhave severe developmental disabilities; 8% have moderate developmental disabilities; and 2% \nhave mild developmental disabilities. Tr. at 5810 (Walsh).  Within population of CHDC \n  4\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 5 of 383\nresidents, approximately 140-150 residents have fragile health; approximately 160-170 residents \nhave behavioral issues; approximately 250-275 residents receive psychotropic medications; and \napproximately 190 are not ambulatory. Tr. at 5811 (Walsh).   \nOverall, CHDC serves residents who are low functioning and have extremely significant \nphysical and mental impairments. Tr. at 5811 (Walsh).  The high level of developmental \ndisabilities at CHDC impacts how the facility is operated. Tr. at 5810 (Walsh).  The structure at \nCHDC is, in part, required by CMS regulations and the ICF/MR model. 42 CFR §§ 483.400-\n483.480, Tr. at 5808 (Walsh).   \n  The facility is regularly surveyed by Centers for Medicaid Services (CMS) and the \nArkansas Office of Long Term Care (OLTC) to ensure that they stay in compliance with the \nICF/MR regulations in order to continue to receive federal funding. Tr. at 4998 (Miller).  CHDC \ncomplies with all ICF/MR regulations and is certified by CMS. Tr. at 4998 (Miller).  CHDC has \nalso sought and obtained independent accreditation from CARF.  Tr. at 4998, 4999 (Miller).   \n  Prior to a resident’s admission to CHDC, DDS determines whether an individual is \neligible for ICF/MR services and provides information about ACS waiver services as an \nalternative to admission to an ICF/MR. Tr. at 474, 812, 1692, 1693 (J. Green, C. Price).  Each \nadmission packet submitted to CHDC includes a request signed by the guardian of the individual \nrequesting admission. Tr. at 1692-93 (C. Price).  Many admissions to CHDC are for individuals \nunable to be served in other settings due to maladaptive behavior that cannot be accommodated.  \nTr. at 1721 (C. Price).   \nCHDC also takes individuals on a respite basis where they are not regularly admitted, but \nrather placed at CHDC for an emergency as-needed basis.  Tr. at 1622 (Clendenin).  If an \nindividual is admitted on a respite basis, per ICF/MR regulations, CHDC does not create a new \n  5\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 6 of 383\nIPP for that individual.  Rather, his or her existing IPP is used. Tr. at 1636 (Clendenin).  Respite \nadmissions have the same type of interdisciplinary team as regular admission though, and if an \nissue arises that is not addressed in that individual’s IPP, the team will convene and determine \nwhat interaction is need.  Tr. at 1636-39 (Clendenin). \nEach resident has an interdisciplinary team (“IDT”).  The IDT includes treating \nprofessionals and non-professionals who provide services to the resident as well as a guardians \nand, in some cases, family members, who are charged with making decisions regarding the \ntreatment and care required by the resident.  Tr. at 813, 814 (J. Green).  Among other things, the \nIDT is charged with preparing an Individualized Program Plan (“IPP”) for the resident who they \nserve. Tr. at 6000 (Walsh).  Treating professionals continually make judgments about the \nresidents they serve. Tr. at 6000 (Walsh).  The IPP documents that those professional judgments \nhave occurred. Tr. at 6000 (Walsh).  The annual IPP meeting also ensures interdisciplinary \ncommunication and treatment for CHDC residents. Tr. at 6000 (Walsh). \nUnder and ICF/MR model, the team must reach consensus on what goals and objective \nare set for each resident. Tr. at 5907 (Walsh).  Among other things, the interdisciplinary teams at \nCHDC set treatment  and habilitation goals. Tr. at 5907 (Walsh).  Each discipline participating in \nthe interdisciplinary team brings its updated assessments and the team sets goals specifically for \nthe individual they are serving. Tr. at 5907 (Walsh).  Professional standards permit each \ndiscipline to bring forward suggested goals for CHDC residents, including habilitation goals, \nevaluate those goals as an interdisciplinary team, and, if a goal is adopted, put together a plan for \ntraining. Tr. at 5908 (Walsh).  Non-professional staff, including direct care staff working in \nresidences, may also bring an objective forward to the interdisciplinary team, but goals are set by \nthe team. Tr. at 5907-08 (Walsh).   \n  6\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 7 of 383\nIn advance of every IPP meeting, CHDC sends a booklet to guardians entitled “Arkansas \nACS Waiver Guide.” Tr. at 6778 (A. Green), Def. Ex. 410.  That booklet was developed by DDS \nin conjunction with waiver providers to thoroughly explain Medicaid waiver services in \nArkansas. Tr. at 6778-79 (A. Green).  CHDC also provides that booklet to parents and guardians \nat the time of a resident’s admission. Tr. at 6778-79 (A. Green).  Guardians are also sent a \ndocument entitled, “Individual's Choice of Alternative Community Services Waiver or \nIntermediate Care Facility,” which solicits the guardian’s choice to pursue alternate community \nwaivers or continued services at CHDC. Tr. at 6777-78 (A. Green), Def. Ex. 406.   \nAt the IPP meeting, CHDC’s program specialists and other team members discuss waiver \nservices with guardians, the interdisciplinary team reviews professional assessments, and the \nteam and guardian discuss the individual’s needs, abilities, and where that individual or the \nguardian would like to receive services. Tr. at 849, 6778, 6728, 6729 (A. Green, B. Brewer).  \nThat discussion is documented in the IPP. Tr. at 849 (A. Green).  Individuals are discharged from \nCHDC on a regular basis to either live at home with their families or often times to a group home \nor apartment funded by the State waiver program.  Tr. at 1703-04, 6729 (C. Price, B. Brewer).  \nCHDC is the least restrictive setting for the residents that it serves and all of the residents have \nchosen to reside at CHDC rather than receive services through the waiver. See e.g. Tr. at 3239, \n3277 (Stoddard, Catron).     \nAlthough not required by ICF/MR regulations, CHDC has five teams that are led by \nindividuals who have extensive experience working with developmentally disabled people. Tr. at \n1662-1664 (Price).  The team leaders are responsible for non-clinical supervision of \npsychological examiners, nurses, social services workers, program coordinators, speech language \npathologists, habilitation training teachers, recreation workers, direct care staff, and \n  7\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 8 of 383\nhousekeepers, who all directly interact with CHDC residents. Tr. at 6723 (B. Brewer).  Team \nleaders also conduct administrative reviews, report and respond to reports for behaviors that \nrequire restraints, respond to any reports of injuries, including minor incidents and incidents that \nare reported to the IRIS. Tr. at 6723 (B. Brewer).  The team leader is also responsible for \ninterviewing, hiring and terminating some employees. Tr. at 6723 (B. Brewer). \nThe five teams at CHDC are habilitation and training team, sheltered living team, \nindividual assistance team, intensive training team, and total care team.  The habilitation and \ntraining team provides treatment and services for the individuals who are among CHDC’s \nhighest functioning residents. Tr. at 1662, 1663, 1664 (Price).  Some of these residents have been \ndiagnosed with moderate and mild mental retardation. Tr. at 1662-1664 (Price).  The sheltered \nliving team provides services for profound to mild or moderate range. Tr. at 1662, 1663, 1664 \n(Price).  The individual assistance team provides services for CHDC residents who are \nprofoundly developmentally disabled. Tr. at 1662, 1663, 1664 (Price).  The intensive training \nteam cares for individuals who are in the lowest range of profound developmental disabilities \nand among the lowest functioning residents at CHDC. Tr. at 1662, 1663, 1664 (Price).  The total \ncare team provides treatment and services for the most medically fragile CHDC residents. Tr. at \n1679 (Price).  These individuals are profoundly disabled and have severe medical conditions. Tr. \nat 1662, 1663, 1664 (Price).  The CHDC residences Willow 1 and Willow 2 are part of the total \ncare team. Tr. at 1679 (Price).  Each team also has a shift coordinator who ensures that staffing \nratios are met, conducts meal audits, bathing audits, environmental audits, interaction audits, and \nensures that employees are where they are supposed to be and doing the job they are supposed to \nbe doing, and ensures that CHDC residents receive the right care and services.  Tr. at 6721, 6723 \n(B. Brewer).  \n  8\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 9 of 383\nCHDC personnel have the best interests of the residents at heart. Tr. at 5799 (Walsh).  \nCHDC has a wide range of employees who provide services to its residents. Tr. at 4874 \n(Murphy).  They are energetic and engaged with CHDC residents and cooperative and assistive \nin their work. Tr. at 5799, 5961 (Walsh).   Because of the severe impairments of CHDC \nresidents, staff are specially trained in specific healthcare needs and high level personal care \nneeds. Tr. at 5811 (Walsh).  Most CHDC direct care staff work with the same residents, but \nCHDC also employs float staff who provide direct care services in different units when \nadditional staff is needed. Tr. at 4874 (Murphy).  At no time is a float staff left to work in an area \nwithout the presence of an experienced staff member to supervise.  Tr. at 4874, 4875 (Murphy).   \nAll CHDC employees, including direct care staff, participate in competency-based \ntraining in many areas.  Tr. at 4991, 4992 (Miller).  Staff training is intensive at CHDC, \nconsisting of weeks of classroom instruction covering issues such as detection of medication side \neffects, thickening of liquid, positioning, bathing, risk of fractures, maltreatment and other \nimportant topics for new staff.  Tr. at 3325, 3326 (Sheppard).  There are three phases of staff \ntraining Phase I, for new staff; Phase II, for direct care staff who have worked at CHDC for more \nthan three months as a trainee; and Phase III for supervisory staff. Tr. at 4991 (Miller).  In \naddition to the Phase training, every employee at CHDC also must go through annual retraining.  \nTr. at 4991, 4992 (Miller).   \nCalvin Price is the superintendant of CHDC. Tr. at 1656 (Price).  Mr. Price is responsible \nfor the total operation of CHDC 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Tr. at 1656 (Price).  The \nsuperintendant administratively supervises all CHDC employees and directly supervises \nCHDC’s administrative office and department heads. Tr. at 6863, 6864 (Price).  CHDC’s \ndepartment heads have extensive experience working with individuals with developmental \n  9\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 10 of 383\ndisabilities and are dedicated to providing services to CHDC residents.  Tr. at 6865 (Price).  The \nvarious department at CHDC and its contract with UAMS ensure that its is able to provide all \nservices needed for its residents or have immediate to professionals who can.  Tr. at 6864 (Price).   \nDefendants rely on a large number of policies in the daily operations of CHDC.  Tr. at 6862, \n6863 (Price). Def. Ex. 910,911, 912.  Policies are usually created only after they are put into \npractice in the form of a protocol or guideline which is an effort to ensure that the policy includes \nall necessary practical aspects.  Tr. at 6866, 6867 (Price).  The creation and modification of those \npolicies help CHDC to improve is delivery and oversight of services at the facility. Tr. at 6867 \n(Price).    \nCHDC has five human rights committees, one committee for each team at CHDC, which \nallows the committees to be closer to CHDC residents than similar committees in other facilities. \nDef. Ex. 912, Tr. at 5849, 5932 (Walsh).  The human rights committees were set up by policy \nand their memberships include, nurses, doctoral level practitioners, and members of the larger \ncommunity. Def. Ex. 910, Tr. at 5848 (Walsh).  The CHDC psychological examiners are \nassigned to each of the human rights committees in a consulting, nonvoting role. Def. Ex. 911, \nTr. at 5849 (Walsh).  The role of the nonvoting members is to provide information and \nconsultation to the other committee members.  Tr. at 256, 258 (Osgood).   \nThe human rights committee at CHDC reviews issues of residents’ rights such as the \nright to privacy, medical diagnosis, medications, behavior plans, safety plans and individual \nprogram plans.  Tr. at 5009, 5010 (Miller).  Among other things, the human rights committees \nreview all behavior plans at CHDC before they are implemented. Tr. at 5850 (Walsh).  If a \nCHDC resident has a safety plan and other behavior plans, all of those plans are reviewed by the \nhuman rights committee. Tr. at 5848.  One-to-one staffing ratio is considered a restrictive \n  10\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 11 of 383\nprocedure at CHDC, so it is reviewed by the human rights committee. Tr. at 5901 (Walsh).  \nAlthough one-to-one staffing is considered a restrictive procedure by CHDC, it should not \nnecessarily be considered a restraint when evaluating CHDC’s restraint use. Tr. at 5901 (Walsh). \nPrior to submission to the human rights committee, CHDC behavior plans are developed \nas follows: the interdisciplinary team establishes an objective and a plan; the psych examiner \nformulates and formulizes the behavior intervention plan or plans; the team leader reviews the \nplan; the chief of psychology reviews the plan; the primary care physician reviews the plan; and \nany of the steps could be recursive. Tr. at 5849 (Walsh).  Subsequent to the professionals’ \nrespective reviews and prior to submission of a behavior plan to the human rights committee, \nwritten, informed consent is obtained from the guardian if it has not been previously obtained. \nTr. at 5849 (Walsh).  The CHDC satisfaction survey reveals that 97 percent of guardians are \nsatisfied or very satisfied overall with CHDC. Tr. at 5956 (Walsh).  The survey also reveals that \n77 percent of guardians are very satisfied overall with CHDC. Tr. at 5956 (Walsh).  CHDC’s \nconsumer satisfaction survey is a direct measure of the quality of services at CHDC. Tr. at 6107 \n(Walsh). \nIf the CHDC human rights committee does not approve a behavior plan, the \ninterdisciplinary team must fix whatever problem is identified by the human rights committee. \nTr. at 5850 (Walsh).  If the human rights committee does approve a behavior plan, it is sent to \nthe superintendent for his approval, and then staff and other CHDC personnel are trained on the \nplan. Tr. at 5850 (Walsh).  A behavior plan is only implemented after all staff, residents, and day \nprograms are trained on the plan. Tr. at 5850 (Walsh). \nIn addition to the human rights committees, CHDC has another group of oversight \ncommittees called the incident review committees. Tr. at 5936 (Walsh).  CHDC has unit based \n  11\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 12 of 383\nincident review committees and a central incident review committee. Tr. at 5936 (Walsh).  \nCHDC’s unit based incident review committees meet every weekday, which provides a rapid \nreview of incidents and allows immediate response when necessary. Tr. at 5936 (Walsh).  If the \nIRC reviews an incident and requires more information or feels that the incident warrants further \nreview, the IRC will refer the incident to the Team Leader for an Administrative Review.  Tr. at \n4872 (Murphy).  The Central Incident Review Committee at CHDC does a second review of \nincidents that were reviewed by the unit incident review committees. Tr. at 5936 (Walsh).   \nThe Central Incident Review Committee receives materials in a statistical compendium \nlisting incidents. Tr. at 5936 (Walsh).  The Central Incident Review Committee meets monthly to \nreview the incidents from the past month. Tr. at 5936 (Walsh).  Generally there are two types of \nincidents reviewed by the Central Incident Review Committee: (1) maltreatment and incidents \nthat need to be entered into the state’s IRIS database and (2) property damage and workman’s \ncompensation related issues. Tr. at 5936 (Walsh). \nThe membership of the Central Incident Review Committee is extensive. Tr. at 5937 \n(Walsh).  The Central Incident Review Committee provides oversight review for identifying \ntrends and policy directions and related issues. Tr. at 5937 (Walsh).  The Central Incident \nReview Committee produces a quarterly incident report summary, which is a statistical report \nshowing all the incidents that occurred in the prior quarter. Tr. at 5937 (Walsh). \n \nIII.  PLAINTIFF’S BURDEN OF PROOF \n \nPlaintiff initiated this matter pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 1997-1997j (“CRIPA”).  CRIPA provides that the Department of Justice may \ninitiate an action only for “such equitable relief as may be appropriate to insure the minimum \ncorrective measures necessary to insure the full enjoyment” of federal constitutional or statutory \n  12\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 13 of 383\nrights, privileges, and immunities. 42 U.S.C. § 1997a(a) (emphasis added); See also Messier v. \nSouthbury Training Sch., 916 F. Supp. 133, 137-38 (D. Conn. 1996) (contrasting the types of \nrelief available to private plaintiffs with the Attorney General’s right under CRIPA to seek only \n“minimum corrective measures”).   \nWithout the CRIPA statute the Department of Justice has no standing to enforce a claim \nunder Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§12101-12213 (“ADA”).   \nPrior to the enactment of CRIPA in 1980, controlling precedents \ndictated that the Justice Department had no authority to sue on \nbehalf of institutionalized persons. See, e.g. United States v. \nMattson, 600 F.2d 1295, 1297 (9th Cir.1979).  Under CRIPA, \nhowever, the Attorney General may bring suit for equitable relief \nto ensure the “minimum corrective measures” necessary to \nremediate “egregious or flagrant conditions which deprive \n[institutional residents] of any [federally protected] rights, \nprivileges, or immunities,” provided the Attorney General finds \nthat such deprivations occur “pursuant to a pattern or practice of \nresistance.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997a.  Thus, the Justice Department may \nonly sue on behalf of institutionalized persons if the strict \nrequirements of CRIPA are satisfied, and may only seek \n“minimum corrective measures.” \n \nMessier v. STS, 562 F. Supp 2d 294, 137. \nIn 1979, prior to the enactment of the CRIPA statute, the Department of Justice tried to \nbring an action on behalf of residents of a developmental disability facility, alleging that their \nfederal rights had been violated. U.S. v. Mattson, 600 F.2d 1295 (9th Cir. 1979).  The District \nCourt dismissed the Complaint and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that decision.  The Ninth Circuit \nheld that “the United States may not bring suit to protect the constitutional rights of the mentally \nretarded without express statutory approval.” U.S. v. Mattson, 600 F.2d 1295, 1297. \nIn 1980, the Department of Justice received limited authority from Congress in the \nCRIPA statute.  Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff has standing to enforce the ADA and \nIDEA in this matter, but that enforcement is limited to the statutory authority CRIPA expressly \n  13\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 14 of 383\ngave the Department of Justice. Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131, 148 (1988); Monroe v. Pape, 365 \nU.S. 167, 172 (1961); Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981).  The CRIPA statute did not \ncreate any substantive rights.  It merely gave the Department of Justice the means to enforce \nexisting federal rights.  Although the Department of Justice is the Plaintiff, for evidentiary \npurposes, the Court cannot assume that the Plaintiff represents the interest of any CHDC resident \nor guardian. Id.  \nA.  PLAINTIFF MUST PROVE THAT DEFENDANTS’ TREATING \nPROFESSIONALS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPARTED FROM ACCEPTED \nPROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT. \n \nStates are not constitutionally obligated to provide social services to their citizens. \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 317 (1982).  The State of Arkansas has opted to provide \nsuch service to its citizens who have been diagnosed with a developmental disability and \ntherefore, has an affirmative duty to protect certain rights of the individuals that it serves.  \nSpecifically, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that persons in state custody have “constitutionally \nprotected interests in conditions of reasonable care and safety, reasonably nonrestrictive \nconfinement conditions, and such training as may be required by these interests.” Youngberg, \n457 U.S. at 324.  Courts have consistently held that “reasonable care” does not impose a \nconstitutional standard of optimal treatment: minimal levels of care are sufficient. Id. at 323; \nHanson v. Clarke County, 867 F.2d 1115, 1120 (8th Cir. 1989) (finding no constitutional right to \noptimal placement).  In determining whether individuals’ rights have been protected, “the \nConstitution only requires that the courts make certain that professional judgment was in fact \nexercised.”  United States v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. 565, 582 (W.D. Pa. \n1995), aff’d sub nom., U.S. v. Ridge, 96 F.3d 1436 (3d Cir. 1996).  Professional judgment has \nundeniably been exercised by the Defendants in their provision of all services at CHDC. \n  14\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 15 of 383\nIn determining what constitutes “reasonable care,” the Supreme Court in Youngberg \nemphasized that the State “has considerable discretion in determining the nature and scope of its \nresponsibilities.” 457 U.S. at 317.  Judicial deference must be afforded to the judgment that a \nqualified professional exercises: “It is not appropriate for the courts to specify which of several \nprofessionally acceptable choices should have been made.” Id. at 321.  In fact, decisions made by \nsuch professionals are presumptively valid. Id. at 323; P.C. v. McLaughlin, 913 F.2d 1033, 1043 \n(2d Cir. 1990) (courts should not “ascertain whether in fact the best course of action was taken”).  \nAnecdotal stories and isolated incidents do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. U.S. \nv. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. at 580 (citing Shaw v. Strackhouse, 920 F.2d at \n1143).  Isolated instances of inadequate care, or even of negligence, do not demonstrate a \nconstitutional violation. U.S. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. at 589 citing \nSociety for Good Will, 737 F. 2d at 1245.  Random acts or isolated incidents are insufficient to \nestablish a pattern, practice, custom or policy. Id.; Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332, \n1345 (11th Cir. 1994). \nPlaintiff offered no evidence that treatment decisions at CHDC are arbitrary or \ncapricious, nor does Plaintiff claim that such treatment decisions were based on stereotypes of \nthe disabled rather than an individualized inquiry into the needs of each resident at CHDC. See  \nP.C. v. McLaughlin, 913 F.2d 1033, 1041 (2nd Cir. 1990)  (holding that the Rehab Act “does not \nrequire all handicapped persons to be provided with identical benefits,” and that the Act “did not \nclearly establish an obligation to meet [Plaintiff’s] particular needs vis a vis the needs of other \nhandicapped individuals….”; See also Phillips v. Thompson, 715 F.2d 365, 368 (7th Cir. 1983) \n(rejecting appellants’ argument that the state had the affirmative duty under the Rehab Act “to \ncreate less restrictive community residential settings for them,” and holding that because “there \n  15\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 16 of 383\nis no contention that these class members, because of their handicap, are being denied access to \ncommunity residential living that Illinois is affording to others,” the Rehab Act “simply has no \napplication to appellants’ claim”) (emphasis added).   \nIn Morgan v. Rabun, the Eight Circuit considered the substantive due process rights of an \ninvoluntarily committed man who was a threat to others. Morgan v. Rabun, 128 F.3d 694, 698 \n(8th Cir. 1997).  The Court found that “an individual’s liberty interest in avoiding forcible \nadministration of psychotropic drugs is not unconditional.  We must balance this liberty interest \nagainst the relevant state interests to determine whether Morgan’s constitutional rights were \nviolated.” Id. at 696-97 (citing Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 320-21).  The Morgan Court \nreasoned: \nThe governmental interests in running a state mental hospital are \nsimilar in material aspects to that of running a prison.  \nAdministrators have a vital interest in ensuring the safety of their \nstaff, other patients, and of course in ensuring the patients’ own \nsafety.  \n  \nId. at 697 (citing Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 227, (1990)).  The Court reasoned further \nthat its “role is not to determine conclusively that Morgan was indeed dangerous.  Rather, we \nmust simply make certain that Dr. Rabun exercised professional judgment in making the \ndetermination that Morgan was dangerous.” Id. at 697-98 (citing Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 321 \n(adopting the standard that “the Constitution only requires that the courts make certain that \nprofessional judgment in fact was exercised”).  In the instant matter, the evidence does not show \nthat professionals at CHDC have failed to exercise professional judgment, nor has the Plaintiff  \neven alleged that professional judgment is not exercised at CHDC.  Rather, Plaintiff’s \nconsultants merely recommend different treatment.   \n \n  16\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 17 of 383\nB.  PLAINTIFF’S EXPERTS SHOULD BE ACCORDED LITTLE OR NO \nWEIGHT \n \nIn the seminal case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Supreme Court \nfound that the Federal Rules of Evidence preserve a “gatekeeping” role for the admission of \nexpert scientific testimony. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Phannaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579,589 \n(1993).  Pursuant to this standard, the Court must make a preliminary assessment “of whether the \nreasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and whether that \nreasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.” Id. at 592-93.   The \nSupreme Court has confirmed that this “basic gatekeeping obligation” applies to all expert \ntestimony, whether scientific or otherwise. Kuhmo Tire Co., Ltd.v. Cannichael, 526 U.S. 137 \n(1999); See also People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Ed., 111 F.3d 528, 534 (7th Cir. \n1997) (applying Daubert principles to testimony of social scientists). \nAlthough the focus of the Court’s inquiry must be on principles and methodology, not on \nthe conclusions they generate, “conclusions and methodology are not entirely distinct from each \nother.” Gen. elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 118 S. Ct. 512 (1997). Accordingly, while trained \nexperts commonly extrapolate from existing data, a district court may conclude that “there is \nsimply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.” Id.  Nothing in \neither Daubert or the Federal Ru1es of Evidence requires the Court to admit expert testimony \nthat is connected to the data only by the speculation of the expert. Id. \nWith respect to the reliability inquiry, the Daubert Court recognized a number of factors \nthat courts should consider including: (1) whether the theory or technique can be tested; (2) \nwhether it has been published or subjected to peer-review; (3) potential rate of error; and (4) \nexistence of standards and controls and general acceptance of the methodology. Id. at 593-94; \nAllison v. McGhan Medical Corp., 184 F.3d 1300, 1312 (11th Cir. 1999).  A party seeking to \n  17\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 18 of 383\nadmit expert testimony must “demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that their opinions are \nreliable.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 589.  Even when applied in the context of the social sciences, the \nDaubert test requires that the methods used to derive the expert’s opinion satisfy the standards \nfor scientific methodology that his or her profession would require of out-of-court research. \nPeople Who Care, 111 F.3d at 528, 537 (7th Cir. 1997).  The test is designed to determine \nwhether the methods used to obtain results “are good science or pseudoscience.” Id.  For \nexample, the Court in People Who Care criticized a statistical study that purported to examine \nthe influence of poverty on academic test scores by comparing the scores of poor white students \nin a school district with those of poor minority students.  The Court concluded that the study \nfailed to address variables other than poverty that might affect test scores and, in fact, did not \neven measure poverty; instead, merely identifying students below a poverty line. Id. at 537.  \nAccordingly the Court found, “[a] statistical study that fails to correct for salient explanatory \nvariables, or even to make the most elementary comparisons, has no value as causal explanation \nand is therefore inadmissible in federal court.” Id. at 537-38. \nPlaintiff’s experts have not shown that their methodology is scientifically valid.  Reliance \non anecdotal case studies has been uniformly rejected by courts. See e.g. Blue Dane Simmental \nCorp. v. American Simmental Ass’n., 178 F.3d 1035, 1040 (8th Cir. 1999); Allison v. McGhan, \n184 F.3d at 1312 (11th Cir. 1999) (reliance on anecdotal evidence is a factor that weighs against \nfinding of reliability); Casey v. Ohio Medical Products, 877 F. Supp. 1380, 1385 (N.D. Cal. \n1995) (case reports and anecdotal evidence “are not reliable scientific evidence of causation \nbecause they simply describe the reported phenomena without comparison to the rate at which \nthe phenomena occur in the general population or in a control group”); Bushore v. Dow Corning-\nWright Corp., 1999 WL 1116920 at 5 (M.D. Fla.) (outcome studies based on anecdotal or \n  18\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 19 of 383\nclinical data are not generally accepted in the scientific community as sufficiently reliable to \ndetermine causation).   \nSimply using “buzzwords” without the type of rigorous analysis of applicable \nprofessional standards, as established and followed by the relevant professional community, \nrenders conclusions nothing more than personal opinions and, therefore, are unreliable. Viterbo \nv. Dow Chemical, Inc., 826 F.2d 420, 424 (5th Cir. 1987) (''without more than credentials and a \nsubjective opinion, an expert’s testimony that ‘it is so’ is not admissible”); Navarro v. Fuji \nHeavy Industry, 117 F.3d 1027, 1031 (7th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1015 (1997) (a \nconclusion without support is not one based on expert knowledge and entitled to the dignity of \nevidence).  An expert must “show how his conclusion is grounded in – follows from – an expert \nstudy of the problem.” Id. at 1032; Cartwright v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 936 F. Supp. 900,905 \n(M.D. Fla. 1996) (“even experts must show that they used science and not speculation to come to \ntheir conclusions”). \nDolihite is an instructive case in this regard.  Dolihite v. Maughon by and through \nVideon, 74 F.3d 1027 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 870 (1996).  That matter involved a \nfederal civil rights lawsuit against a state hospital’s personnel on behalf of an adolescent who \nsuffered injuries when he tried to hang himself.  Summary judgment was granted for defendants \non the grounds of qualified immunity.  On appeal, the relevant question was whether defendants \nhad “violated clearly established constitutional law” by being “deliberately indifferent to [the \npatient’s] serious medical needs” so as to provide an exception to the qualified immunity \ndoctrine. Id. at 1041.  The plaintiffs argued that the Court erred in failing to consider the affidavit \nof their expert witness, a certified and practicing psychologist, that defendant’s treatment was “a \ntotal departure from professional judgment, practice or standards” such that it could not be said \n  19\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 20 of 383\nthat treatment was based on accepted professional judgment. Id. at 1046.  The Circuit observed \nthat expert medical testimony could be helpful in establishing a sufficiently great departure from \nthe relevant professional standards if the testimony made reference to “specific deficiencies in \ndefendant’s treatment and specific medically accepted standards.” Id.  However, in applying this \nstandard, the Court found the expert’s affidavit had several flaws that rendered it unhelpful.  \nAlthough plaintiffs’ expert referred to several specific instances which he believed indicated a \nneed for more intensive intervention, he failed to cite any authority for his “conc1usory \nsuggestion” that defendants’ conduct was a departure from accepted professional standards. Id. at \n1047.  The Court continued: \nThis is not to say that Dr. Halpern’s conclusions are wrong.  Rather \nit is to say that his affidavit does not aid us in our … analysis.  His \naffidavit is not the kind of tool which indicates with any specificity \nthe degree to which the doctor here strayed from the realm of \naccepted professional judgment.  The fact that Dr. Halpern used \nthe phrase ‘total departure from professional judgment, practice or \nstandard... ’ does not foreclose summary judgment when qualified \nimmunity has been properly raised.  The affidavit must help the \ncourt to discern whether the purported departure was so egregious \nthat, in light of the reported cases, a reasonable professional would \nhave recognized that his behavior amounted to a constitutional \nviolation. \n \nId.  \nAs the Dolihite Court concluded, “an expert opinion which is merely conclusory, even if \ncouched in the language of the relevant legal standard, will be of little assistance to a Court.” Id. \nat 1046, n.3. \nIn the instant matter, Plaintiff’s experts have not shown that their methodology is \nscientifically valid.  There is too great an analytical gap between the limited data collected and \nthe conclusory opinions of Plaintiff’s experts.  Their haphazard selection of a sample is not a \n  20\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 21 of 383\ntechnique that can be tested.  Their methodologies have not been published or subjected to peer- \nreview.  The rates of error from their flawed samples are much too high.  \nDefendants’ expert, Dr. Walsh, explained the importance of having a randomized \nstratified representative sample of people to establish a subpopulation so that the results of a \nreview are truly representative of the care at the facility. Tr. at 5804, 5806 (Walsh).  Unlike \nPlaintiff’s experts, Defendants’ experts were careful to select random, stratified, representative \nsample for their respective reviews of CHDC.  \nDr. Kastner found that the Plaintiff’s experts did not rely on a random stratified sample.  \nTr. at 4045.  (Kastner).   \nGenerally they chose samples which were based on the outcomes \nthat they wanted to look at. So Dr. Mikkelsen looked at everybody \nwho died. He looked at predominantly people who used more \nmedication, who were sicker, who were older. Dr. Holloway \nlooked at patients who were younger, who took more psychotropic \nmedications, who had more challenging behavior. I didn't see any \nof them characterizing a pattern of care based upon an appropriate \nsample, representative sample, a sample that would allow them to \ngeneralize their opinions from their sample to the entire facility. \n \nTr. at 4045 (Kastner). \nAnd what I found consistently, at least in Dr. Holloway and \nMikkelsen and Ms. Crawford, were they cited care episodes for \nspecific individuals. There was no evidence to support the fact that \nthose citations of a specific care practice were representative of the \ncare at the facility. \n \nTr. at 4047 (Kastner). \nDr. Kastner expressed a concern with Plaintiff’s experts:  \nIt’s not simply an expert walks in, says either you do what I do or \nyou are deficient,  I resent the fact that many of the plaintiff’s \nexperts took that approach in reviewing care processes at CHDC. \n \nTr. 4026 (Kastner). \n  21\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 22 of 383\nFurthermore, the Plaintiff’s experts could only offer about five (5) benchmarks and they \ncould not present them in an appropriate manner.  Tr. at 3981 (Kastner).  If they had \nappropriately used benchmarks, they would have found out that Conway compared very \nfavorable and was superior many aspects to other ICF’s.  Tr. at 3981 (Kastner).   \nAs to Mikkelsen’s sample, Dr. Kastner observed:  \nWell, it’s absolutely false that those cases represent that typical \ncare at the facility.   \n \nTr. at 4003 (Kastner).  As stated by Dr. Kastner: \nDr. Mikkelsen testified about his representative cases and their \ntypicality. His report actually had seven. He only testified \nabout six. And he needed just a couple more to make his point. \nAnd he apparently couldn't find typical cases in the remaining \n72 individuals in his quote, unquote, sample and had to go \noutside of his sample to find two others whose charts he had \nnever seen prior to -- I mean, never seen prior to writing his \nreport or prior to his deposition, to somehow make the case that \ntwo more people needed to be added to a sample to identify \nrepresentative care practices. That's patently absurd. \nIf his sample of 78 were representative and if his point in \npresenting case examples are to represent the typical quality of \ncare, he should have been able to find one or two in the \nremaining 72 cases in his sample. To be forced to go outside \nand find two more because they were more typical than the ones \nin his sample really reflects very poorly on the sampling \nprocedure and its representativeness. \n \nTr. at 4004 (Kastner).   \nDr. Mikkelsen’s sampling methodology was not sufficient to identify a sample that was \nrepresentative of CHDC.  Tr. at 4110 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner further observed: \nSo this was – the whole process was very troubling.  There was no \nstandard produced.  There was no measure that was utilized.  There \nwas no pattern that was described.  There were simply a handful of \ncases that were thrown into the report at the end – seven actually, \nto quote –unquote, illustrate to poor patterns of care.   \n \n  22\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 23 of 383\nTr. at 4112 (Kastner).  Mikkelsen’s sample of seven cases was not representative of the typical \npsychotropic practices at CHDC.  Tr. at 4153, 4155 (Kastner).   \nPlaintiff’s expert, Ms. Osgood repeatedly admitted that she did no randomized sample \nand only reviewed documents that were sent to her by DOJ.  Tr. at 214-20 (Osgood).  Ms. \nOsgood’s ongoing disregard for any methodical process was demonstrated by her willingness to \ntestify that a document that she reviewed only one day before her testimony was somehow \nrepresentative of CHDC facility-wide. Tr. at 99-100 (Osgood).  Plaintiff’s expert, Ms. Osgood \nclearly intended to present biased findings to the Court and failed to use any methodology of \nstatistical extraction of injuries at CHDC.  Tr. at 5964 (Walsh).  Ms. Osgood did no calculations \nof the frequency of injuries at CHDC such as how many injuries occur per person, per day or per \nyear.  Tr. at 248 (Osgood).  She did not objectively assess any discipline or information at \nCHDC. Tr. at 5977 (Walsh).  Ms. Osgood’s, opinions were idiosyncratic, personal opinions with \nno scientific basis. Tr. at 5977 (Walsh).   \nPlaintiff expert, Ms. Crawford, used the same report in this matter that she used in \nprevious investigations of facilities in other states and admitted that at least some of the material, \nincluding another facility’s name, appeared throughout her report that she supposedly prepared \nfor this matter. Tr. at 2904 (Crawford).  Also, Ms. Crawford’s methodology was seriously \nflawed.  She commented on staff training but did not observe staff or interview any staff to \ndetermine what level of training or knowledge they had. Tr. at 2907 (Crawford).  She also failed \nto use any benchmarks in her review. Tr. at 2907-08 (Crawford).  Even more troubling, she \nconducted her reviews by interacting with the residents she claimed she was observing, which \nnecessarily altered the representativeness of her observations.  Tr. at 2931 (Crawford).   \n  23\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 24 of 383\nSimilarly, Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson’s report would not stand up to the scrutiny of his \nown profession.  Tr. at 5893 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson showed no intent to be objective in his review \nof CHDC. Tr. at 5893 (Walsh).  He did not review a random, stratified, representative sample of \nCHDC residents. Tr. at 5894 (Walsh).  He did not even finish reviewing the records that he \nrequested and were provided by CHDC.  Tr. at 5894 (Walsh).  At trial, Dr. Matson admitted that \nhe did not even believe that he drew a representative sample of CHDC residents for his review. \nTr. at 1206-09 (Matson).  Dr. Manikam also admitted that he did not take a randomized stratified \nrepresentative sample.  Tr. at 3172 (Manikam).   \nDr. Matson can not make statements about the entire CHDC population because he did \nnot take any sort of reasonable scientific approach in his work. Tr. at 5902 (Walsh).  Dr. \nMatson’s sample was not representative of CHDC with respect to gender, clinical team \nmembership, level of intellectual disability, ambulation status, fragile health, aggressive, \ndestructive, or self-injurious behaviors in behavior plans. Tr. at 5895 (Walsh).  In some \ninstances, Dr. Matson’s sample was nearly the reverse of the actual CHDC population. Tr. at \n5895 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson oversampled people with severe behavioral problems and severe \ndisabilities, but under sampled residents with profound disabilities. Tr. at 5895 (Walsh).  As \nfurther evidence of his sloppy research, in one of Dr. Matson’s charts he identified one of \nCHDC’s psychological examiners as one of the residents, leading one to lack confidence in Dr. \nMatson’s analysis. Tr. at 5897 (Walsh).  In another of Dr. Matson’s charts he incorrectly \nidentified the first names of at least six or seven CHDC residents, further leading one to lack \nconfidence in Dr. Matson’s analysis. Tr. at 5898 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson claimed to not know \nwhether there were incorrect name transcriptions on his list, although that fact was noted in \n  24\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 25 of 383\nDefendants’ expert report months before trial.  Tr. at 1206-1209 (Matson).  At a minimum, Dr. \nMatson’s, lack of methodology affected his findings. Tr. at 5902 (Walsh). \nDr. Mikkelsen did not conduct a psychiatric assessment of any individual at CHDC.  Tr. \nat 3831 (Mikkelsen).  He admitted that his methodology was not consistent with the CMS \nsurveyors’ methodology.  Tr. at 3789 (Mikkelsen).  He testified that he selected 76 charts review \n“drawn from low utilizes of medications, high utilizes of medications, and then some based on \nthe diagnostic constellation that was listed on the face sheet, probably leading more toward \ncomplex diagnostic formulations.”  Tr. at 3790, 3791 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen’s sample \nended up being a sample of 78 out of 500 individuals from which seven were selected to discuss \nat trial. Tr. at 4003 (Kastner).  Those seven cases are the outliers in the sample of 78, and the 78 \nare the outliers of the population of 509. Tr. at 4003 (Kastner). The examples Dr. Mikkelsen \nended up with were younger residents who took more medication than the average resident at \nCHDC.  Tr. at 3788, 3789 (Mikkelsen).  The sample Dr. Mikkelsen ended up with also included \nindividuals who had more adverse outcomes than the average individual at CHDC.  Tr. at 3789 \n(Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen’s sample was not representative of CHDC. Tr. at 3790 (Mikkelsen). \nDr. Mikkelsen did not observe CHDC residents in any proportions to the overall general \npopulation, such as by disability or intellectual level.  Tr. at 3787 (Mikkelsen).  He was provided \na spreadsheet of individuals on psychotropic drugs at CHDC by the DOJ that he had not \nrequested.  Tr. at 3786 (Mikkelsen).  Prior to his tour of CHDC, Dr. Mikkelsen received \ndocuments from the DOJ, selected by the DOJ.  Tr. at 3786, 3787 (Mikkelsen).  There was at \nleast one individual whom Dr. Mikkelsen reviewed solely because other DOJ consultants asked \nhim to do so.  Tr. at 3788 (Mikkelsen).   \n  25\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 26 of 383\nDr. Holloway only referred to four (4) examples to support her testimony.  Tr. at 4214 \n(Kastner).  The sample referred to by Holloway was not representative of the overall population \nat CHDC.  Tr. at 4215.   \nDr. Kastner further noted: \nAgain, I didn't see that plaintiff's experts articulated a \nstandard of care. Because they didn't articulate a standard of \ncare, I couldn't understand the basis for their allegations that \nthere were any deficiencies related to care process. And as a \nresult, I don't understand the basis for any remediation or \nrelief that would be justified. \nI think it's important that -- you can't start this process \nand reach a conclusion without articulating what the standards \nare at the very beginning. And, again, I don't believe that the \ncare practices are deficient, not just because the DOJ's experts \nwere unable to articulate any standards, but because I believe \nthere is fundamentally a problem with the quality of evidence \nused to justify care practices. And because there is a lack of \nadequate evidence, we have to afford clinical professionals the \nopportunity to use their judgment and operate on good faith to \nprovide the services as best they see fit. \n \nTr. at 4076 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner noted that there cannot be a violation of accepted professional standards \nwithout an established practice.  Tr. at 3991 (Kastner).   \nAgain, as I have looked at the plaintiff’s experts’ reports and \nlistened to their testimony, I keep waiting to hear what is the \nstandard of practice so that we can compare practice at CHDC \nagainst that standard. . . And I just really haven’t heard a clear \narticulation of the quote, unquote, standard of care.   \n \nTr. at 3991 (Kastner). \nPlaintiff’s experts do not cite any standards or controls to demonstrate general acceptance \nof their methodologies.  The Court is presented with personal opinions, not scientific analysis \nfrom Plaintiff’s experts.  As in Dolihite, the DOJ experts have failed to cite any authority for \ntheir conclusory suggestions that professional services at CHDC substantially depart from \n  26\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 27 of 383\naccepted professional standards.  Plaintiff’s experts in many instances acknowledged that the \nICF/MR regulations represent the standard of care.  Dr. Mikkelsen, Ms. Richardson, and Ms. \nOsgood, to an extent, all relied upon elements of the ICF standards to make the case when it was \nconvenient for them to claim that the facility did not meet standards. There is implicit \nacknowledgment in their reports and testimony that the ICF/MR standards are applicable in both \ndefining the model of care and evaluating its quality.  Richardson testified that the DDS mission \nstatement was the standard by which she followed to evaluate CHDC.  Tr. at 675-76 \n(Richardson).  She further admitted that even though a mission statement is only a statement of \nwhat the facility wishes to strive for, she still applied that standard to what she thought were \nconstitutional violations at CHDC.  Tr. at 676 (Richardson).  Likewise, Osgood also lacked any \nstandards by which she evaluated CHDC.  Tr. at 209, 222 (Osgood). Crawford also admitted that \nshe did not apply any standards to her review of CHDC.  Tr. at 2915 (Crawford).   \n“[W]here an expert becomes an advocate for a cause, he therefore departs from the ranks \nof an objective expert witness, and any resulting testimony would be unfairly prejudicial and \nmisleading.” Viterbo v. Dow Chemical Co., 646 F. Supp. 1420 (E.D. Tex. 1986) (toxic tort \nexpert sought employment from plaintiff's attorneys and did not view the condition objectively).  \nA number of Plaintiff’s experts are undeniably advocates for a social or political philosophy.  \nPlaintiff’s advocates could not have objectively evaluated professional services at CHDC.  The \nopinions of those witnesses must be significantly discounted.  “[A] scientist who forms an \nopinion before beginning his research lacks the objectivity needed to produce reliable scientific \nresults.” Id. at 1425 (citing Perry v. United States, 755 F.2d 888 (11th Cir. 1985).  Plaintiff’s \nexpert Ms. Richardson was an advocate for a cause to move individuals from state run facilities \nto waiver-funded programs.  She made idiosyncratic conclusions with absolutely no basis, and \n  27\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 28 of 383\nused absolutely no standards and made no mention of an appropriate clinical process for \nevaluating the risk of harm. Tr. at 4341-45 (Kastner).  Her findings do not withstand scrutiny as \nshe has been discredited by Dr. Walsh and Dr. Kastner.  Tr. at 5984, 4002, 4009 (Walsh, \nKastner).   \nSusan Thibadeau was also clearly an advocate for a cause in that she made \nrecommendations for certain students at CHDC who she thought should be receiving their \neducation in another setting, but made no attempt to observe their IEP meetings or interview \ntheir team members to determine why those students are receiving services at CHDC.  Tr. at \n2380 (Thibadeau).  Thus, she could not definitively say how exactly she thought she could make \nthat determination. She was clearly an advocate of moving children out of the facility with no \nregard to what was in the best interest of the individual children she mentioned.   Tr. at 2369 \n(Thibadeau). \nThe trial evidence reflected that nearly all of the DOJ experts toured CHDC with a \npreconceived notion of what their findings would be even before they conducted their tours.  \nThis bias was evident through testimony by Richardson who admitted that she used no standards \nin reaching her findings.  Tr. at 676 (Richardson).  It is also clear that Osgood and Thibadeau had \nno valid or reliable samples of individuals and admitted that DOJ provided them with the \ndocuments they reviewed.  Tr. at 214 (Osgood).  The evidence shows that Dr. Matson and Dr. \nMikkelsen based their findings on samples which were not scientifically reliable and not \nstratified or representative.  The DOJ experts conducted incomplete reviews, cut and pasted their \nreports, and relied on isolated incidents provided to them by DOJ attorneys rather than creating \ntheir own findings.   Tr. at 1201, 2904, 2361-62 (Matson, Crawford, Thibadeau).  These experts \n  28\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 29 of 383\nlacked the objectivity necessary to assure reliable scientific results and this Court should afford \ntheir opinions little to no weight.     \n \nIV.  THE DOJ HAS FAILED TO PROVE A PATTERN OR PRACTICE OF ABUSE \nAND NEGLECT AT CHDC AND THEREFORE FAILS TO MEET THEIR \nBURDEN OF PROOF UNDER CRIPA \n \n  There is no policy or custom implemented at CHDC which would result in the abuse or \nneglect of a client at CHDC and the DOJ has failed to provide the Court with any proof of any \npattern or practice that would result in abuse.  “Isolated examples of problems, while regrettable, \ndo not establish constitutional violations.”  Shaw v. Stackhouse, 920 F. 2d 1135, 1141-42 (3d \nCir. 1990).  “Although the failure to prevent a pattern of attacks, injuries, or violent behavior is \nactionable, the right to protection is not activated by an isolated mishap, or called into question \nby each bruise that a patient may suffer.”  Id. at 1143.  See also, Society for Good Will to \nRetarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 F.2d 1239, 1245 (C.A.N.Y.,1984)  “[T]he Justice \nDepartment must prove that the government entity's ‘policy or custom’ was a ‘moving force’ \nbehind and ‘played a part in’ the alleged deprivations.”  United States v. Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. 565 (W.D. Pa. 1995).  In U.S. v. Pennsylvania, the court evaluated \nthe case presented by the United States against the Ebensburg Center, an ICF/MR facility, and \nmade specific inquiries into whether any of the instances cited by the United States would prove \na pattern or practice of the facility.  The court found that the incidents cited by the United States \nwere isolated incidents over the course of several years and did not prove that there was any \npattern or practice at the Ebensburg facility that played any role in the alleged deprivation of \ncare.  Like the Ebensburg case, the DOJ in the present case has created an identical argument \nagainst CHDC.  By relying on isolated incidents and by failing to provide the Court with proof \n  29\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 30 of 383\nthat there is a policy at CHDC that is the moving force behind any of the instances cited, the DOJ \nhas failed to meet its burden of proof.  Much to the contrary, CHDC is a well-staffed facility that \nhas systems in place to address client maltreatment, client to client aggression and program \nplanning.   \n  DOJ presented only one expert on this issue, Carla Jo Osgood.  Not counting the DHS \nand DDS policies, there are 425 procedures and policies identified in the CHDC policy manual. \nTr. at 5966 (Walsh).  Ms. Osgood alleged that harm occurs at CHDC as a result of a lack of \nformalized policies and procedures, but such an allegation is completely baseless. The very few \nnumbers of injuries identified by Ms. Osgood over a two and half year period at a facility with \nover 500 residents actually demonstrates that CHDC is a very safe facility. Tr. at 5971(Walsh). \n  In the case at hand, the DOJ has not even attempted to establish that there is a policy or \ncustom that is implemented at CHDC that would result in the abuse or neglect of the residents.   \nThe DOJ’s primary witness with regard to maltreatment and injuries at CHDC was Ms. Osgood.  \nNot only did Ms. Osgood fail to prove any constitutional violations, but the fact that she had to \nsearch a period of two and a half years to find just twelve instances of injuries that she claims are \nassociated with a common theme, that being wheelchairs, in itself demonstrates that there is no \npattern or custom at CHDC that would cause abuse or neglect. Tr. at 5962-63 (Walsh). \n  Ms. Osgood did not objectively assess any discipline or information at CHDC. Tr. at \n5977 (Walsh).  Osgood’s, opinions were idiosyncratic, personal opinions with no scientific basis. \nTr. at 5977 (Walsh).  And she did no calculations of the frequency of injuries at CHDC such as \nhow many injuries occur per person, per day or per year.  Tr. at 248 (Osgood). \n  The ICF/MR guidelines are minimal professional standards that CHDC must meet, and \nCHDC does meet those standards. Tr. at 5977 (Walsh).  The purpose of the ICF/MR standards is \n  30\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 31 of 383\nto ensure client safety.  CHDC makes every possible effort to protect its residents from harm.   \nDr. Kastner testified as to this issue at trial.   \nI will say that the facility does take any negative outcome, \nincluding any injury or accident, extremely seriously. And I know \nthat [DOJ presented] many exhibits that reflected investigation \nreports and things of that type. I think that the effort there was \ndesigned to embarrass the facility by the presence of those \ninvestigations, implying that there were links that could be \nestablished between poor care practices and those outcomes. What \nI would say is that the facility operates in a very transparent \nfashion. Its doors are open. Its books are open. It is very self-\ncritical, and it is very self-analytic, that it collects information, and \nit airs it publicly across the facility with the goal of improving \ncare. There's no one trying to hide anything at that facility. They \ninvestigate almost everything that they can think of, and certainly \nanything that would potentially have been attributed to poor care or \nto abuse or neglect. They have a very high sensitivity for the health \nand safety of the residents. And it would be improper, and I think it \nactually was improper, to represent that that process of openness \nand self-criticism at all represents inferior care or a pattern of \ninferior care.   \n \nTr. at 4299 (Kastner).  \n \n  As noted above, in determining whether a constitutional violation has occurred, courts \nrequire a showing of something that amounts to more than just isolated incidents.  They also \nhave required proof of a custom or practice at a facility that was a moving force behind the \nallegations of abuse or mistreatment of residents.  The DOJ has failed to show a pattern of abuse \nand neglect and has failed to show that there is any custom or practice at CHDC that would have \nbeen a moving force behind any incidents of abuse.  They therefore have failed to meet the \nburdens imposed by the Courts in Shaw, Societies of Good Will and Ebensburg.   \n \n \n \n  31\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 32 of 383\nA.  THE INCIDENT REVIEW COMMITTEE IS ACTIVE AT CHDC AND \nEVALUATES CLIENT TO CLIENT AGGRESSION IN ORDER TO \nIDENTIFY TRENDS AND PATTERNS AND TO APPROPRIATELY \nADDRESS CLIENT-TO-CLIENT AGGRESSION AND INJURY \n \n  The DOJ failed to prove that client-to-client aggression has either individually or in total \nrisen to the level of a constitutional violation, much less that the official policy or custom  \nat CHDC played any role in any alleged deprivation of care.   \n  Many of the incidents which the DOJ presented to this court at trial involved client-to-\nclient aggression.  DOJ attempted to call into question the functionality and effectiveness of the \nIncident Review Committee (IRC) at CHDC.   \n  Each of the five teams has an IRC, and each day the IRC meets, reviews incidents and \nmakes recommendations for a team leader to do an Administrative Review of certain cases.  If a \nrecommendation is made, the team leader will review the incident and see if there is anything \nthey can add to the resolution of the incident or to the prevention of like occurrences.  Tr. at 313-\n14 (Weaver).  Sometimes the team leader will refer it back to the IRC to take a second look at \nthe incident because IRC may identify something that was not flagged during the first review.  \nTr. at 456 (Murphy). \n  When CHDC finds that there are a series of incidents for a particular resident in a \nrelatively short period of time, a special staffing is held to revise the individual’s IPP where \nappropriate.  Tr. at 457, 4866 (Murphy).  CHDC is able to track when a particular resident is \nhaving an increased amount of behaviors through the behavior reporting process and the \nMonthly Behavior Report and Safety Plan Use document that is generated by the psychology \ndepartment.  Tr. at 461 (Murphy).   \n  In addition to the behavior report process, CHDC administrator, Sara Murphy testified \nthat she will review all incidents reviewed by the IRC teams as well and she will plot all \n  32\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 33 of 383\nincidents into a composite table which shows how many incidents any individuals have had.  Tr. \nat 462 (Murphy).  This shows that CHDC has a policy and custom in place to track and trend \nclient-to-client aggression in order to reduce incidents of aggression between clients.  Ms. \nMurphy sends her findings to the team leaders and team IRC’s in order to show them any \npatterns that they may not have realized from their daily reviews.  Tr. at 462 (Murphy).  This is \nevidence that the client-to-client aggression is not due to any policy or custom at CHDC and that \nCHDC is doing everything possible to keep these incidents from occurring.   \n  DOJ attempted to show that the policies at CHDC are deficient by introducing Exhibits \n377, 378, 379, 380 and 382 which were all administrative reviews regarding C.A. and client-to-\nclient aggression in which he was involved.  However, in response, Defendants introduced a \nspecial staffing which was scheduled and held for C.A. in response to these incidents of \nincreased aggression.  Tr. at 4865-66 (Murphy); Def. Ex. SM-1.   Defendants produced proof \nthat systems are in place at CHDC to prevent and reduce client-to-client aggression.  DOJ could \nnot find even one instance where there was a pattern of client aggression which went unnoticed \nor unaddressed at CHDC.  Therefore, it is reasonable for this Court to conclude that the custom \nat CHDC is to track incidents of harm and to address them appropriately through special \nstaffing’s and through changes in programs.  It is further reasonable for this Court to also \nconclude that the customs and practices at CHDC are not a moving force behind client-to-client \naggression and that CHDC appropriately addresses any aggressive conduct and make changes in \nan effort to reduce any inappropriate behavior.   \n \n \n \n  33\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 34 of 383\nB.  CHDC APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSES FRACTURES AND HAS \nNECESSARY PROGRAMS TO PREVENT FALLS AND BONE INJURY \n \n  The average rate of injuries and  fracture at CHDC is low relative to benchmarks from \nother similar facilities.  Tr. at 4065, 4296-4297, 5941 (Kastner, Walsh).  In fact, the rate of \nfractures and other injuries at CHDC is virtually the same or lower than the rate at similar \nfacilities. Tr. at 5955, 5941 (Walsh).   \n  CHDC pays special attention to the risk of fractures for its residents.  To prevent fractures \nfrom occurring, CHDC has a DEXA scan machine on campus which tests the bone density of its \nresidents.  Tr. at 6403 (Henderson).    DEXA stands for dual energy x-ray absorption meter.”  Tr. \nat 6403 (Henderson).  The DEXA scan has a minimum amount of x-ray.  It produces an \nimmediate picture. The computer component of the scan analyzes risk factors.  It analyzes \nlumbar 1 through 4 and bone mineral density and contents in the area.  Tr. at 6403, 6404 \n(Henderson).  The DEXA scan compares the individual’s results with that of what you would \nexpect to see at peak bone age and similarly for the hip and formulates the risk.  The machine \nconsiders age, sex, ethnicity, height, weight, menopause.  The results are categorized by the \nmachine as not at risk, increased risk, or high risk.  Tr. at 6404 (Henderson).  The DEXA scan \nshows much detail, it can show the spaces and gaps in the bone.  Tr. at 6405(Henderson).  The \nDEXA scan even shows subtle changes in bone density over the years.  Tr. at 6405, 6406 \n(Henderson).  Dr. Kemp, CHDC’s endocrinologist, rates the DEXA scan results and makes any \ndeterminations of osteoporosis or osteopenia.  Tr. at 6405 (Henderson).  Dr. Kemp is a \nconsultant endocrinologist from UAMS.  Tr. at 6438 (Henderson).  CHDC has a contract with \nDr. Kemp to provide services at CHDC on a regular basis.  Tr. at 6438 (Henderson).   \n  Residents at CHDC receive DEXA scans every two years. A urine test called N-\ntelopeptide is utilized when the DEXA is unable to read an individual’s bones due to \n  34\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 35 of 383\nabnormalities.  Other testing includes endocrine, Vitamin D, and calcium.  Treatment includes \nVitamin D with calcium; bisphosphonates such as Boniva or Fosa max; bone therapy such as \nEvista for females.  Miacalcin is used for those who may not tolerate bisphosphonates.  Reclast, \na yearly bisphosphonate, and Forteo, a bone builder, are also sometimes used.  Tr. at 6406-6408 \n(Henderson).  The endocrinologist, the primary care physician, and the IDT reviews the DEXA \nresults.  Tr. at 6406 (Henderson).   \n  CHDC started using the DEXA machine in 2006.  They started using the actual risk \nfactors from the machine in 2008.  Tr. at 6406 (Henderson).  The DEXA risk results are \ndocumented on the resident’s Quick Reference Guide.  Tr. at 6406 (Henderson).  Staff is made \naware of an individual’s risk of fracture by looking at the QRGs, attending Phase II training, and \nvisiting the DEXA building.  Tr. at 6410 (Henderson).   \n  Low bone density is identified and treated in a variety of ways.  In 2005-2007, CHDC \nimplemented a comprehensive risk assessment.  Individuals with a DEXA score within the \nnormal limits may nonetheless be indicated as having an increased fracture risk.  Tr. at 6408 \n(Henderson).   \n  If someone is indicated by the DEXA to have a higher risk factor for fractures, their bone \ndensity will routinely be measured every two years by the DEXA and they will be prescribed \nmedication.  The team will also address their staffing in their plans.  If additional fractures occur, \nthe physicians will perform a peer review at a physicians’ meeting.  Tr. at 6411(Henderson). \nThe DEXA scan has many benefits to the residents at CHDC.  1 \n                                                 \n1 For example, resident HCT has a DEXA score within the normal limits.  However, she is indicated as having an \nincreased fracture risk.  CHDC ensures that HCT receives Boniva, Evista, and has had consults with an \nendocrinologist.  Tr. at 6434 (Henderson).       \n \nIn 2008, she had a plus one on her spine, and her risk factor, according to the machine, on her spine would \nnot be increased.  Her hip was minus 2.2, which would be osteopenia, which there was an increased result \nin her - - would cause an increase in her fracture risk.  In 2007, her number was .3.  There was no increase \n  35\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 36 of 383\n  At CHDC, Ms. Henderson is responsible for conducting clinical audits of any individual \nwho develops a fracture.  Ms. Henderson, a nurse, audits their medical records, history of any \nfractures, DEXA results, any interventions, any medications related to osteoporosis, adequacy \ncalcium, adequacy of Vitamin D, any back pain, and any loss of height or kyphosis.  Such \nevaluation is documented in a progress note and sent to the physician.  The physician will make a \ndetermination regarding any additional interventions.  Tr. at 6410 (Henderson).   \n  CHDC tracks injuries in the IRIS database.  The IRIS database, which is the DHS \nIncident Reporting Information System, helps CHDC to keep track of injuries that occur. CHDC \ngenerates a monthly activity report and a quarterly and yearly statistical report from the IRIS \ndatabase that CHDC regularly sends to the Department of Developmental Disabilities. Tr. at \n4982 (Miller).  Defendants’ expert Dr. Walsh analyzed the IRIS database to obtain statistics of \ninjuries at CHDC.  All cuts and lacerations are reported in the IRIS database if they require \nstitches, dermabond, or steri-strips to close.  Tr. at 5938 (Walsh).  All fractures are reported in \nthe IRIS database.  Tr. at 5938 (Walsh).  Swelling, sprains, and bruises are reported in the IRIS \ndatabase if an x-ray was ordered, regardless of whether underlying damage is found, but if a \nfracture is found the injury is recategorized to the fracture category.  Tr. at 5938 (Walsh).  Client-\nto-client bites are reported in the IRIS database if the skin is broken or if antibiotic is applied.  \nTr. at 5938 (Walsh).  Abrasions and burns are reported in the IRIS database if they require the \napplication of medications or ointment.  Tr. at 5938 (Walsh).  Medication errors are reported in \n                                                                                                                                                             \nbecause that would  be within the  normal limit.  And then he r hip was minus 2.1, which would be an \nincrease.   \n \n  Tr. at 6408, 6409 (Henderson).    \n \n \n \n  36\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 37 of 383\nthe IRIS database if they are serious in nature and require some type of medical treatment to \ncorrect.  Tr. at 5939 (Walsh).   \n  Professional standards unequivocally dictate that minor injuries, including bumps and \nbruises (any less than 2 inches), are not to be tracked or recorded because including such injuries \nwould skew data.  Tr. at 5938 (Walsh).  That is not to say that CHDC does not record such \ninjuries.  In fact, parents and guardians are notified of even minor incidents and injuries.  Tr. at \n5034 (Miller), 5059 (Taylor).  Parents and guardians testified that the reason they chose CHDC \nfor their loved ones is because CHDC protects the residents from unnecessary injury. In fact, \nBarry Landen, the brother of K.L. testified that K has lived at CHDC for 40 years with no serious \ninjuries.  Tr. at 6851.2 \n  DOJ experts Ms. Osgood and Ms. Crawford both commented on fractures and other \ninjuries occurring at CHDC.  Neither expert provided the Court with any benchmarks or any \ncomparative data from other facilities with which to compare CHDC.  Tr. at 2923 (Walsh).  \nDefendants’ expert Dr. Walsh, on the other hand, did provide information to that effect.  Kevin \nWalsh analyzed the injuries reviewed by the IRC and contained on the IRIS database at CHDC.  \nTr. at 5937 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh  analyzed six consecutive quarterly reports beginning with the \nfirst quarter of 2008.  Tr. at 5939 (Walsh).  The quarterly injury data analyzed by Dr. Walsh \nincluded information about the time, place, and type of injury.  Tr. at 5939 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh \norganized the injury data by cuts, fractures, bruises, bites, swelling, abrasions, choking, burns \nand other.  Tr. at 5939 (Walsh).  From that data that Dr. Walsh was able to access from the IRIS \ndatabase, he calculated an annualized total and per-person, per-year rate of injury, which is the \n                                                 \n2 “For example, if [K.]were to pick up a knife, a sharp knife, he would cut himself to shreds with it before he \nfigured out that something bad was happening and the knife caused it. He's prone to slam doors, but he doesn't \nunderstand the concept of putting your fingers over the door when you slam will cause you a huge amount of injury. \nSo the fact that nothing serious has happened to K in 40 years of living there [CHDC] is extraordinarily significant \nto me.” Tr. at 6851 (Landen). \n  37\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 38 of 383\nstandardized rate that is used in academic peer-reviewed literature.  Tr. at 5940 (Walsh).  \nAccording to the data collected by Dr. Walsh, there are 0.16 cuts per person per year at CHDC.  \nTr. at 5940 (Walsh).  There are 0.06 fractures per person per year at CHDC.  Tr. at 5942.  There \nare 0.02 bites per person per year at CHDC.  Tr. at 5942 (Walsh).  There are 0.03 abrasions per \nperson per year at CHDC.  Tr. at 5942.  There are 0.00 choking incidents per person per year at \nCHDC.  Tr. at 5942 (Walsh).  There are 0.00 burns per person per year at CHDC.  Tr. at 5942 \n(Walsh).  There are 0.05 other types of injuries per person per year at CHDC.  Tr. at 5942 \n(Walsh).  The per person, per year rate for all injuries at CHDC is 0.41, which is less than the \nrate of injuries of published studies with large samples from multiple states.  Tr. at 5941 (Walsh).  \nThe per-person, per-year rate for all injuries at CHDC is comparable to benchmark rates at other \nfacilities.  Tr. at 5941(Walsh).  Given the population at CHDC the rate of injury is no higher than \none would expect in similar a facility.  Tr. at 5941 (Walsh).   \n  Injuries and Incidents at CHDC are not occurring at a high rate and certainly not \noccurring at a rate which would rise to a constitutional violation on the part of CHDC.  CHDC \nhas systems in place to report injuries and prevent injuries from reoccurring, fractures in \nparticular.  CHDC is meeting and exceeding professional standards by utilizing the DEXA \nmachine and reporting all injuries through the IRIS database; generating reports for review by \nthe Department of Developmental Disabilities and reporting any injuries to parents and guardians \nof the residents.  The DOJ has not met its burden in proving that CHDC is failing to meet \nprofessional standards with regard to fractures or other injuries and has failed to provide any \ncomparative data to show that CHDC is falling below generally acceptable professional \nstandards.  To the contrary, Defendants showed that CHDC has low rates of injury, comparable \n  38\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 39 of 383\nto other similar facilities and guardians are choosing placement at CHDC for their loved ones \nbased on these results.   \n \nC.  INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMING PLANNING IS APPROPRIATE AND \nEFFECTIVE AT CHDC \n \n  In an effort to discredit the programming at CHDC, DOJ selected certain parts of the \nprocess that when taken individually appear not to provide appropriate services, but, when taken \nin their entirety, are actually very reasonable approaches consistent with generally accepted \nprofessional standards.  An example of this disingenuous attempt to cast a shadow on the care \nprovided at CHDC is where the DOJ questioned Judy Weaver, a program coordinator, on \nresident J.M. \nThe DOJ had a monthly plan review that did not list out the number of times he was \nrestrained in that month and it discussed whether he could match numbers.  Judy Weaver \nexplained that monthly plan reports are summaries of how the individual is progressing with his \nservice objectives and not with his behavioral objectives.  Behavioral incidents requiring \nrestraints are dealt with through behavioral objectives and when behavioral objectives need to be \nadjusted, it is handled by another mechanism at CHDC which allows the entire team to be \ninvolved.  Tr. at 349-50 (Weaver).  The number matching had significance with regard to T.M.’s \nservice objectives only.   \n  DOJ elicited testimony from Judy Weaver about resident M.E. who had smearing of \nfeces as a target behavior in his plan.  DOJ pointed to M.E. engaging in this behavior and asked \nJudy Weaver why his toileting objective was not changed. Tr. at 366 (Weaver).  This is \nparticularly telling as to the DOJ’s lack of knowledge, in that it shows that the DOJ was unaware \nthat smearing has nothing to do with toileting skills.  It is absurd to think that an individual, even \n  39\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 40 of 383\nwith significant disabilities, would engage in smearing because their toileting skills were not \nrefined.  Judy Weaver testified that the smearing would be contained in M.E.’s safety plan since \nit is a behavioral concern.  Tr. at 367 (Weaver).   The DOJ went on to pull out other documents \nat CHDC, including a behavioral report for M.E., but quickly redirected the-ir questioning once \nJudy Weaver began to explain to the Court that the behavioral reports are addressed in the Safety \nPlans and Positive Behavior Support Plans at CHDC, not the program director’s monthly \nsummary reports.  Tr. at 372 (Weaver).  The program director only focuses on services \nobjectives, not behavioral objectives.  The DOJ was confused about the inner workings of the \nfacility and inappropriately addressed only isolated portions of the system to imply that M.E.’s \nsmearing went unnoticed and unaddressed when it certainly did not.   \n  DOJ then went on to ask Ms. Weaver to explain why the “significant needs” listed in \nM.E.’s IPP included “matching gardening tools.”  Tr. at 388 (Weaver).  Ms. Weaver explained \nthat M.E. was assessed and his significant needs came from the assessments which determine his \nlikes, dislikes, strengths, needs and preferences.  Tr. at 388 (Weaver).   In this case, matching \ngardening tools could very well be a significant need for M.E.  The DOJ did not introduce \nevidence to the contrary and did not meet its burden of proving that matching gardening tools \nwas not a significant need for M.E. or that M.E.’s IPP was incorrect or inappropriate in any way.  \nIf M.E. enjoys engaging in gardening and gardening keeps him engaged, which may have been a \nway to reduce his behavior of smearing.  Without showing that M.E.’s smearing was not \naddressed anywhere else in his plan, including his safety plan or positive behavior support plan, \nthe DOJ has failed to meet their burden of showing that systems at CHDC lead to client injury or \nrisk of harm.  Likewise, without showing that M.E. does not enjoy gardening and that gardening \n  40\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 41 of 383\ndoes not help to engage M.E. in meaningful activity, DOJ has again failed to show that CHDC is \nnot providing appropriate care to M.E.   \n   DOJ also questioned Ms. Weaver on the long range goals of Z.S.  Z.S.’s long range goals \ncome from his likes, dislikes and preferences, and in his case, they are appropriate.  Tr. at 393 \n(Weaver).  Identifying coins totaling a dollar is a significant need for Z.S. because it has allowed \nhim to go to the canteen by himself and exhibit independence.  Tr. at 396 (Weaver).  Z.S.’s long \nrange goals state: “By 2012 I will learn appropriate behaviors in order to function more \nindependently in my environment at CHDC and home visits.”  Tr. at 399 (Weaver); Pl. Ex. JW-\n3.  Home visits are mentioned in his long range goals because the Center is referencing his home \nvisits with his family.  Clearly, CHDC has the long range goals geared toward Z.S. eventually \nfunctioning more independently at home so that he might move back home to live with his \nfamily.  Z.S. is only eleven (11) years old and if he were to move from CHDC it would most \nlikely be back to his home.  Therefore, it is more than appropriate to mention home visits in \nZ.S.’s long range goal section.   \n  Program planning at CHDC is appropriate and effective, and the DOJ has not proven \notherwise.  It is clear from the evidence that the DOJ did not understand how the facility works \nand mistakenly claimed that there are incidents of adverse behavior that were overlooked and \nplans that were inappropriate.  To the contrary, individual program plans are appropriate and do \nnot result in injury to the residents.  Safety Plans and Positive Behavior Support Plans are also \nappropriate and help in the effort to reduce incidents of injury and risk of harm.3   \n \n \n                                                 \n3 Safety Plans and Positive Behavior Support Plans are discussed in more detail later in Defendants’ Post-Trial Brief \nunder the Psychology section.   \n  41\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 42 of 383\nD.  CHDC HAS AN APPROPRIATE POLICY THAT IS VIGOROUSLY \nFOLLOWED IN RESPONSE TO ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF ABUSE \n \n  The DOJ failed to show how the Center’s action in responding to allegations of abuse \nconstituted a substantial deviation from acceptable professional standards, or that the custom or \npolicy of responding to abuse at CHDC somehow played any role in the occurrence of alleged \nmaltreatment.  U.S. v. Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. 591.  CHDC, however, offered evidence, \nthrough the testimony of Calvin Price, to show that there is a strict policy followed at the Center \nin response to allegations of maltreatment.   \nOnce an allegation is made, reports are made to Child or Adult Protective Services and to \nthe police.  Tr. at 6873 (Price).  The Maltreatment reports include an investigator’s report, which \nincludes notifications made, interviews, records reviewed, relevant facts, and lists of \nattachments. Tr. at 5944-45 (Walsh).  The attachments to the investigator’s report include \nincident reports, correspondence, letters, memos, emails, notification of investigative \nproceedings, witness statements, client documents, and relevant facility documents. Tr. at 5945 \n(Walsh).  CHDC has a designated, independent investigator who conducts all of the \nmaltreatment investigations. Tr. at 5945 (Walsh). Once any claims of maltreatment are made, \nemployees at question are told to leave the Center immediately and they are placed on \nadministrative leave.  Tr. at 6873 (Price).  If the allegation involved physical abuse, the resident \nis sent to the nurse or physician to be evaluated and all of the reports are sent to an investigator.  \nTr. at 6873 (Price).  Five days later, the investigation is turned into the Arkansas Office of Long \nTerm Care.  Tr. at 6873 (Price).  After the investigation is complete, CHDC administrators, \nCalvin Price, Marilyn Junior and Kathy Guffy, conduct an executive review and dissect the \ninvestigation in order to determine if the allegation is substantiated.  Once the Center decides \nwhether to substantiate the allegation, they make administrative conclusions which are reported \n  42\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 43 of 383\nto the team leader and department head to notify them of what action should be taken.  Tr. at \n6874 (Price).  The employee accused of maltreatment is not permitted to return back to work \nunless the investigation is complete and the abuse and neglect is unsubstantiated.  Tr. at 6874, \n5943 (Price, Walsh). \n  Dr. Kastner testified to his findings with regard to maltreatment at CHDC, stating that the \nrates of abuse and neglect are extremely low in comparison to other facilities.     \n“And the rate of abuse and neglect at Conway Human \nDevelopment Center is five per hundred per year.  It was six times \nhigher at that facility in Nebraska. In Nebraska, 90 percent of the \nprofessionals -- of the clients who were evaluated by their \ninterdisciplinary team had a recommendation for community \nplacement. And in Conway, virtually zero. And those are \nbenchmarks. And they are available to anyone who wants to look \nat the Department of Justice's website in the findings letter they \nhave published. So I'm saying, if someone cares about \nbenchmarks, if someone cares about outcomes, there are places to \ngo and places to look and data available and benchmarks that can \nbe considered. And I think it's important. And I look, and I think \nabout it, and I try to use them in my practice.” \n \nTr. at 3978 (Kastner). \n \n  Defense expert Dr. Kevin Walsh also did a detailed analysis of maltreatment \ninvestigations at CHDC for the months of June and July of 2009, which included 13 \ninvestigations. Tr. at 5943 (Walsh).  The 13 investigations analyzed by Dr. Walsh comprised \nover 1,000 pages of documentation. Tr. at 5944 (Walsh).  Among other things, Dr. Walsh found \nthat the turnaround for maltreatment investigations at CHDC is better than most ICF/MR \nfacilities and exceeds any relevant standards. Tr. at 5945-46 (Walsh).  \nOne of the maltreatment investigations reviewed by Dr. Walsh involved an incident \nwhere a resident was inadvertently left behind in a residence after other residents and staff had \nleft. Tr. at 5946 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh noted that in response that event, within a few days, CHDC \n  43\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 44 of 383\ndeveloped a specific protocol to prevent that type of event in the future and trained over 200 staff \non that protocol. Tr. at 5946 (Walsh). \nDr. Walsh extracted statistics from all of the maltreatment reports for six quarters from \nthe beginning of 2008 and found that on an annualized basis, there were 27.33 incidents \nsubstantiated. Tr. at 5947-48 (Walsh).  The per-person, per-year rate of substantiated abuse in \npeer-reviewed published literature ranges from 0.033 to 0.04 and the rate identified by Dr. Walsh \nfor CHDC was 0.054, which is within the acceptable range of benchmarks. Tr. at 5948-49 \n(Walsh).  The slightly higher rate of substantiated abuse at CHDC is likely because CHDC treats \nincidents where there was a lack of enhanced coverage (e.g. lack of 1-to-1 staffing) as “incidents \nof abuse” while other facilities do not. Tr. at 5949 (Walsh).  The fact that Dr. Walsh was able to \naccess data from CHDC easily is a sign that CHDC is tracking data and information better than \nsimilar facilities. Tr. at 5950 (Walsh).  To further this point, the policy at CHDC to terminate \nemployees who have committed abuse or neglect meets applicable professional standards. Tr. at \n5975 (Walsh). \nCHDC takes any maltreatment very seriously.  Many CHDC employees testified at trial \nthat there is a no tolerance policy at CHDC for maltreatment and reporting of maltreatment.  \nFurther, CHDC has low rate of instances in comparison to other facilities.  The DOJ has not met \ntheir burden of proving that the system of reporting or addressing maltreatment is deficient in a \nway that would cause harm to residents of the facility.  The system at CHDC for addressing \nmaltreatment does not violate the constitutional rights of its residents.   \n \n \n \n  44\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 45 of 383\nE.  THERE IS NO CULTURE OF SILENCE AT CHDC \n \n  “There is no culture of silence at CHDC.”  Tr. at 6885 (Price).  At trial, DOJ expert Carla \nJo Osgood testified that she believes that there is a culture of silence at CHDC without any \nsupporting evidence.  Tr. at 51(Osgood).  Calvin Price, the superintendant of CHDC, testified at \ntrial that there is absolutely no culture of silence at CHDC.  In furtherance and in support of his \ntestimony, Mr. Price offered to the court the actual statistics that CHDC keeps track of on \nallegations of maltreatment that are reported each year.  “In 2008, CHDC had roughly 56 \nallegations of maltreatment reported and only 8 of those involved employees that had worked at \nCHDC for 6 months or less.”  Tr. at 6884, 6907 (Price).  Although Osgood testified that she \nremembered that most incidents of alleged maltreatment were reported by new employees, the \nstatistical evidence indicates otherwise.  Tr. at 142 (Osgood). \n  The Court also heard testimony from Barry Landen and Earline Stoddard, guardians of \nlong time residents, K.L. and A.S., who combined, have a total of nearly 80 years of experience \nwith CHDC and other facilities.  These witnesses testified that there is no culture of silence at \nCHDC.  Tr. at 3237 (Stoddard).   Long time employee, Sarah Murphy, also deflated this \naccusation by Osgood:  “The fact that I've been in direct care as an LST for two years, and then I \nworked in the classroom for several years, I think if there was any kind of culture of silence, I \nwould know about it. And I believe it is actually contrary to that. I believe that there's \nencouragement from all sides to be sure and report to protect individuals.”  Tr. at 4874 \n(Murphy).  \n  Osgood’s allegation that CHDC has a culture of silence has no basis in fact or logic. Tr. \nat 5976 (Walsh).   Dr. Walsh testified that generally, the likelihood of staff not reporting abuse or \n  45\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 46 of 383\nneglect that they witness is more likely in a community setting than a modern, publicly operated \ninstitution such as CHDC.  Tr. at 5976 (Walsh). \n \nF.  THE PERSONAL OPINIONS OF CARLA JO OSGOOD WERE \nCOMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE AND SHOULD BE ACCORDED LITTLE \nOR NO WEIGHT BY THE COURT \n \n  DOJ expert, Carla Jo Osgood, offered testimony at trial that exhibited significant \nunfounded bias against institutional care.  Her opinions were also based on the flawed \nmethodology that she employed.  As a result, this Court should reject or severely discount her \nopinions.   \n  Ms. Osgood holds a B.A. in political science. Tr. at 205 (Osgood).  Her graduate studies \nare in health ministries, pastoral family studies; she never completed her health ministries \npastoral family studies degree.  Tr. at 205 (Osgood).   \n  Ms. Osgood’s educational background did not include any advanced scientific method or \nstatistics courses; nor did her formal graduate level casework include statistical mental health nor \nfiled study design nor quality and management nor survey methods or similar courses.  Tr. at 205 \n(Osgood).  Ms. Osgood has not taken any credit courses during her formal education that focus \non healthcare policy or management.  She stated that she did take courses on healthcare services \nand healthcare quality assurance but she could not say roughly the s or subject matters of those \ncourses.  In very general terms she was able to state that the courses related to “providing support \nservices to individuals and families in counseling and/or type pastoral manner”.  Tr. at 209-211 \n(Osgood).   \n  46\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 47 of 383\n  Ms. Osgood does not hold any advanced degree in the field of developmental disabilities.  \nTr. at 204 (Osgood).  Other than prior experience at Muscatuck, working for Liberty Healthcare, \nMs. Osgood does not work in an ICF/MR setting.  Tr. at 206, 207.   \n  Ms. Osgood is not certified by any quality improvement organization such as the \nAmerican Society of Quality.  Tr. at 209 (Osgood).   \n  Dr. Kastner testified that being “shoulder to shoulder” with other professionals is not a \nlegitimate form of training and is not a substitute for formal training.  Tr. at 3954 (Kastner). \n  Ms. Osgood has not published any peer-reviewed articles.  Tr. at 211 (Osgood).  She has \nnot made any presentations at any national conferences.  Tr. at 212 (Osgood).   \n  Prior to this case, Ms. Osgood has never given any expert testimony in a court of law and \nnone of her prior reports in other matters have gone before a court and undergone judicial \nscrutiny.  Tr. at 212, 213 (Osgood).   \n  In Daubert, the Court stated that “the word ‘knowledge’ connotes more than subjective \nbelief of unsupported speculation.”  Osgood repeatedly testified to her subjective belief and \nmade no attempt to do an objective evaluation of CHDC; she based a large portion of her \nopinions on speculation.  This is supported by the evidence in many instances where she makes \ninaccurate statements and giant leaps, time and time again, with regard to the ICF/MR \nregulations, community standards and incidents that she claimed to have “observed” at CHDC.   \n  Osgood, who held herself out to be an expert in ICF/MR regulations, did not have an \nappropriate understanding of the staffing ratio requirements in the ICF/MR regulations. The \nICF/MR regulations require that staff be competent, but there is no regulation or professional \nstandard that requires staff have their competencies defined and measured through any type of \n  47\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 48 of 383\ncompetency-based examination. Tr. at 5967 (Walsh).   Dr. Kastner testified that there was clearly \nno shortage of direct care staff.  Direct care staffing clearly exceeded the ICF/MR standards.  \n“I found it quite troubling that she (Osgood) couldn't recall the \nICF/MR standard for staffing at an ICF/MR. I just didn't \nunderstand how you couldn't know that if you had worked at 15 or \n20 ICFs. I couldn't understand why there was no focus on \noutcomes in her report if she's familiar with the instructions given \nto surveyors to focus on outcomes. I didn't understand the basis for \nher alleged expertise, because it wasn't apparent in her report, \ndeposition, or testimony.”  \nTr. at 4044 (Kastner).  \n \nIt is quite clear that Ms. Osgood did no study of staffing at CHDC.  Tr. at 5968 (Walsh).  \nICF/MR guidelines provide specific ratios for all staffing scenarios at CHDC and CHDC is \ncompliant with those regulations.  Tr. at 5968 (Walsh).  Ms. Osgood’s unscientific method was \nevidenced when she counted staff at each residence but failed to consider that staffing ratios for a \nunit can include staff that are with residents in locations other than the unit itself. Tr. at 5969 \n(Walsh). \n  The more appropriate standard that this Court should consider is the ICF/MR regulations \nand the technique that is utilized by ICF/MR surveyors.  ICF/MR surveyors do not look at \nstaffing numbers alone because the facility is responsible for organizing and evaluating its \nindividual appointments, programming schedules, activities, materials, equipment, grouping \nassignments, and available staff in such a way that it maximizes benefit to the individual. Tr. at \n5969 (Walsh). \n  Another example of the infirmity of Osgood’s opinion is her lack of any statistical \nanalysis of injuries at CHDC. Tr. at 5964 (Walsh).   Ms. Osgood did nothing more than search \nfor injuries that occurred at CHDC and then concluded that CHDC is a dangerous place. Tr. at \n5964 (Walsh).   Dr. Walsh testified that in the appendix of Osgood’s report, she listed out all of \n  48\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 49 of 383\nthe documents she claimed to have reviewed over the course of twelve pages and she claimed \nshe reviewed 13 administrative records and external reviews, 8 policy and procedure documents, \n53 medical charts, and 55 “record folders,” 16 individual program plans out of 510 available to \nher, and two behavior plans. Tr. at 5964 (Walsh).  However, she reviewed 115 investigation-\nrelated documents. Tr. at 5964 (Walsh).  Forty-three percent of the documents Ms. Osgood \nclaimed to have reviewed were investigations where she knew that injuries or unfortunate events \noccurred.  Tr. at 5964 (Walsh).   Ms. Osgood went hunting for problems. Tr. at 5964 (Walsh).  \nOsgood supported this finding in her own direct testimony about the documents that she \nreviewed.  Tr. at 52 (Osgood).  Ms. Osgood’s overwhelmingly disproportionate review of \ninvestigation reports, relative to all other documents she failed to review and were available to \nher, reveals a strong agenda that does not suggest that she did an objective analysis of risk \nmanagement at CHDC. Tr. at 5965 (Walsh).   \n  Unfortunately, every facility in the country that provides healthcare or related services is \nsusceptible to having employees who abuse or neglect the individuals for whom they are \nsupposed to care. Tr. at 5975 (Walsh).  However, when asked about other facility statistics on \nabuse, Ms. Osgood claimed that she was not allowed to submit her findings from other facilities \nbecause of confidentiality rules.  Tr. at 272 (Walsh).  Therefore, she admits that she used no \nbenchmarks to form her opinions and she simply feels that no abuse should be present.  Tr. at \n272 (Walsh).    \n  Ms. Osgood’s also made a great deal of inaccurate statements.  She relied on JACHO \nstandards, which are only applicable to specific hospitals and have no relevance at CHDC.  Tr. at \n5971 (Walsh).  Then she erroneously identified CHDC psych examiners as members of the \nhuman rights committees. Tr. at 5973 (Walsh).  CHDC psych examiners are not members of the \n  49\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 50 of 383\nhuman rights committees, but rather non-voting consultants who serve an important role. Tr. at \n5973 (Walsh).  \n  Another example of Ms. Osgood careless method and unfounded speculation was her \ntestimony that she saw small puzzle pieces lying around on a table in the 19 Maple residence that \ncould be easily ingested by those with pica diagnosis.  However, she admitted that she made no \nattempt to find out whether anyone in 19 Maple has a diagnosis of pica.  Tr. at 256 (Osgood).  \nWhen questioned on whether she knew if this was a real threat of harm to anyone in 19 Maple, \nshe quickly changed her testimony and stated: “Even if there wasn't even anyone with pica \nbehavior, there were multiple opportunities for people to trip and fall on those items that were \nscattered throughout the living unit.”  Tr. at 256 (Osgood).  So at this point in her testimony she \nappears to be absurdly alleging that she found that CHDC was violating the constitutional rights \nof its residents by leaving puzzle pieces on the floor which could cause a resident to trip and fall.  \nLater in her cross-examination, Ms. Osgood finally admitted that she did not know if anyone in \n19 Maple had pica and her testimony was completely baseless.  Tr. at 256 (Osgood). \n  All of the preceding examples are important for the Court to consider, but the most \nglaring example of Osgood’s blatant disregard for the truth is when she knowingly testified about \na gentleman who she observed in the day room with an “apparatus wrapped around his neck with \nno staff intervention”.  Tr. at 95 (Osgood).   Then, when questioned about this testimony on \ncross-examination, Ms. Osgood testified that she said it was “a phone cord looked-like item.”  \nTr. at 240 (Osgood).   However, that is not how she testified on direct, rather, what she said was: \n“There was an incident where a gentleman laid sideways on the couch with some type of \napparatus wrapped around his neck with no staff intervention.”  Tr. at 95 (Osgood).  After \nattempting to mislead the Court on her prior testimony, Osgood then attempted to cover-up her \n  50\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 51 of 383\nlack of knowledge about chewelry by questioning whether the chewelry was appropriate for that \nclient.  Tr. at 239 (Osgood).   \n  The reality of this situation was that the gentleman in the day room was wearing \nchewelry for oral stimulation.  Staff was not required to intervene because this was an approved \ntherapy for this resident as an oral motor stimulating activity.  Osgood did not know about \nchewelry, had never heard of it before she wrote her report, and was actively attempting to \nmislead the Court with her testimony.  In fact, Osgood admitted on cross that she looked it up \nafter her deposition, but claims that at the time of trial, she did not know how it is worn.  Tr. at \n239 (Osgood).  Nevertheless, she failed to qualify her direct testimony when it was clear that at \nthe time of trial that she knew that what she observed during her tour was not a telephone cord \nand was in fact chewelry.  As it was, she was comfortable with characterizing it at the time of \ntrial as an individual who had a telephone cord wrapped around his neck and staff who should \nhave been intervening but were not.  Even if Osgood had corrected herself during her direct \ntestimony or even during cross-examination, it does not negate the fact that she holds herself out \nas an expert on ICF/MR facilities which serve individuals with mental retardation and other \ndevelopmental diagnoses, but does not know about commonly used devices to help disabled \nindividuals with oral motor skills and relaxation therapy.   \nG. CONCLUSION \n \n  There is no policy or custom implemented at CHDC which would result in the abuse or \nneglect of a client at the Center and the DOJ has failed to provide this Court with any proof of \nany pattern or practice that would result in abuse.  The DOJ also failed to prove that client-to-\nclient aggression has either individually or in total risen to the level of a constitutional violation, \nmuch less that the official policy or custom at CHDC played any role in any alleged deprivation \n  51\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 52 of 383\nof care.  To the contrary, Defendants have shown that client-to-client aggression is identified and \naddressed appropriately.   Defendants also presented evidence that program planning at CHDC \nemploys a reasonable approach consistent with generally accepted professional standards.  DOJ \nexpert, Carla Jo Osgood, offered inaccurate testimony at trial and exhibited a significant \nunreasonable bias against institutional care.  Her opinions were also based on flawed \nmethodology that she employed and her opinions should be afforded little or no weight by this \nCourt. \n   \nV.  CONDITIONS AT CHDC \n \nA.  CHDC MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES  \n \n1.  DEFENDANTS’ PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL EXPERTS  \n \nTheodore Kastner, M.D. \n  Dr. Kastner began working with the developmentally disabled in 1976.  Tr. at 3943-3944 \n(Kastner).  After finishing his medical training, he became the Director of the Center for Human \nDevelopment at Morristown Memorial Hospital and was responsible for the programs for people \nwith developmental disabilities.  Tr. at 3946 (Kastner).  The Center for Human Development \naddresses the needs of people with developmental disabilities across their life span.  Tr. at 3946 \n(Kastner).  He expanded that program across three hospitals in the northern part of New Jersey.  \nTr. at 3947 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner has a medical degree.  Tr. at 3949 (Kastner).  He also was awarded a master \nof science in administrative medicine.  Tr. at 3950 (Kastner).  He has completed an internship \nand residency in pediatrics.  Tr. at 3950-3951 (Kastner).  He also completed a fellowship with \ntraining in psychiatry, neurology, rehabilitation and habilitative services, research, and \n  52\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 53 of 383\npsychology for the developmentally disabled. Tr. at 3951 (Kastner).  He is board certified in \npediatrics, neurodevelopment disabilities, developmental and behavioral pediatrics, and medical \nmanagement.  Tr. at 3955-3956 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kastner supervised the operation of a licensed child study team.  Tr. at 3947 \n(Kastner).  He was the Director of a child evaluation center.  Tr. at 3947 (Kastner).  He \npersonally performed the evaluations for the child study team.  Tr. at 3948.   \n  Dr. Kastner’s experience with the child study team, the early intervention system, and the \ncase management unit provided knowledge about the IDEA and least restrictive environment.  \nTr. at 3948 (Kastner).  He was the school physician for the deaf for twenty- two (22) years.  Tr. \nat 3948-3948 (Kastner).  In that capacity, he was often part of the group of professionals that \nworked with the sending school districts’ child study teams.  Tr. at 3949 (Kastner).  He received \ntraining on the Rehabilitation Act.  Tr. at 3952 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner was engaged as an expert to contribute to the AAMR expert consensus \nguideline services.  Tr. at 3970 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kastner has visited approximately 40 ICF/MR’s in the past 25 years.  Tr. at 3975 \n(Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner has collected benchmarks from other ICF/MR’s that can be compared to \nCHDC.  Tr. at 3976-3977 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner acknowledged that Defendants’ counsel has asked him to identify, in his \nreview of any facility, any problems, inadequacies, or deficiencies.  Tr. at 3982 (Kastner).  In \nfact, he found significant deficiencies at one facility, Embreeville Center, he reviewed while \nworking with Defendants’ counsel in Pennsylvania in a CRIPA action brought by the DOJ.  Tr. \nat 3983 (Kastner).  As to Embreeville Center, Dr. Kastner recommended that the State settle the \n  53\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 54 of 383\ncase or close the facility.  However, Dr. Kastner was asked to work again with Defendants’ \ncounsel even after an unfavorable review at Embreeville Center.  Tr. at 3983 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kastner also found the North Princeton Developmental Center to be unacceptable.  \nTr. at 4382 (Kastner).   \n  As further demonstration of his creditability and fairness in conducting reviews, although \nDr. Kastner found CHDC to meet or exceed accepted professional standards, he opined that the \nState should close Alexander Human Development Center.  Tr. at 3989 (Kastner).  Alexander is \n“world’s apart” from CHDC.  Tr. at 3989 (Kastner).  CHDC is “a very fine facility which in \nmany respects can be a model for other public ICF’s.”  Tr. at 3989 (Kastner).  In contrast, \nAlexander is “a troubled facility with serious quality of care concerns.”  Tr. at 3989 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kastner has worked in Nebraska developing 228 IPP’s for the Beatrice Center.  Tr. at \n3983-3984 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner even worked for the Plaintiff in 1991 to review two (2) facilities in \nWisconsin, Central Wisconsin Center and Southern Wisconsin Center.  Tr. at 3972 (Kastner).  \nHe was asked to look at medical, neurology, and psychiatry.  Tr. at 3972 (Kastner). \n  Theodore Kastner, M.D., is the President of the Developmental Disabilities Health \nAlliance (“DDHA”), which is a healthcare organization that served 7,000 developmentally \ndisabled individuals who live in the community.  Tr. at 3939-3940 (Kastner).  He personally \nprovided psychiatric and neurological consultations for those individuals needing such services.  \nTr. at 3941 (Kastner).  \n \n \n \n  54\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 55 of 383\nAndrew Warren, M.D.  \nAndrew Warren is an adult psychiatrist.  Tr. at 4641 (Warren).  Dr. Warren is English and \nhe holds an MB degree from England, a BS degree, an MA, and a doctorate of philosophy.  Tr. at \n4641 (Warren); Def. Ex. 372.  The English BS, bachelor of medicine, and BS, bachelor of \nsurgery, are equivalent to the American M.D. degree.  Tr. at 4641, 4642 (Warren).

PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL CARE GENERALLY AT CHDC \nMET OR EXCEEDED ACCEPTED PROFESSIONAL \nSTANDARDS \n \nDr. Kastner was able to conclude:  \n \nI believe that both the administrative leadership and clinical \nleadership at CHDC are exceptional and rate them as excellent, \nand those would specifically include Mr. Price and Ms. Miller, \nwho function as a superintendent and the head of the QI program, \nand Dr. Thomas and Ms. Green, who run the medical and social \nservices departments. I was impressed with all four, and I think \nthey're doing an excellent job. If I didn't believe that, I would say \nso. \n \nTr. at 4075 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner explained that the ICF/MR survey process is rigorous.  Tr. at 4038 (Kastner).  \nThey look at 489 tags or items.  “It is very comprehensive and exhaustive.”  Tr. at 4039 \n(Kastner).  “And as a result, virtually no facility undergoes a survey without having some \ndeficiency identified.”  Tr. at 4039 (Kastner).  And the fact that Conway has had some \ndeficiencies is certainly no indication that it does not meet federal standards or does not provide \nhigh quality care.”  Tr. at 4039 (Kastner).  CHDC is fully certified as an ICF/MR facility.   \n  Dr. Kastner conducted an independent review of CHDC using a standardized approach.  \nTr. at 4001 (Kastner).  He obtained a stratified random ten (10) percent sample of charts \nconsistent with the methodology that CMS would use.  Tr. at 4001 (Kastner).  A stratified \n  63\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 64 of 383\nsample was chosen to assure that it was representative of the population at CHDC, Tr. at 4001 \n(Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner observed two (2) weeks of tours by Plaintiff’s experts.  Tr. at 3999 (Kastner).  \nHe went back for another week without the Plaintiff’s experts.  Tr. at 4000 (Kastner). \n  The quality of care at CHDC was very good to excellent in nearly every aspect.  Tr. at \n4007 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner would rank CHDC in the 90 to 95th percentile.  Tr. at 4007 \n(Kastner).  Dr. Kastner did not see any evidence of an inappropriate pattern of care or a pattern \nof care that was not consistent with professional standards.  Tr. at 4007 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner believes the provision of psychiatric services to residents of CHDC meets all \nappropriate standards of care.  Tr. at 4218 (Kastner).  The consultative model at CHDC meets \ngenerally accepted professional standards.  Tr. at 4222 (Kastner).  The diagnostic processes at \nCHDC are compliant with standards and the diagnoses at CHDC are consistent with the thinking \nof the rest of the field.  Tr. at 4084 (Kastner).  There is adequate monitoring of side effects.  Tr. \nat 4084 (Kastner).  Psychiatric management at CHDC is consistent with generally accepted \nclinical guidelines and clinical practices.  Tr. at 4084 (Kastner).  The monitoring of antiepileptic \nmedication at CHDC complied with clinical practice guidelines.  Tr. at 4083 (Kastner).  The low \nrate of status epilepticus at CHDC shows that care processes are appropriate as to seizure \nmanagement, Tr. at 4083 (Kastner). \n  The patterns of psychotropic medications and psychiatric diagnosis at CHDC are \nreasonable, Tr. at 4025 (Kastner).  Direct care staffing was more than adequate at CHDC.  Tr. at \n4069 (Kastner).  CHDC also has a fairly rich physician ratio.  Tr. at 4069 (Kastner). \n  64\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 65 of 383\n  Poor outcomes can occur even when the standard of care is being met.  Tr. at 4031, 4032 \n(Kastner).  It is not reasonable to say, as stated by Plaintiff’s experts, that poor outcomes mean \npoor practices.  Tr. at 4033 (Kastner). \n  As Dr. Kastner noted: \nThere will be outliers. There will be individuals who have \nan outcome that none of us would find acceptable. But that's \npart of being in the human services field. We all fail every \nday. Every one of my patients is going to die. And that does \nnot mean that I'm a failure. \n \nTr. 4018 (Kastner). \nThere are a very small number of guidelines specifically developed for persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities or with intellectual disabilities.  Tr. at 4024 (Kastner).  As to \nguidelines, Dr. Kastner stated: \nIf there's less evidence, practice parameters are called \npractice guidelines. And in those instances, you could expect \ndeviation from the practice parameter in 50 or 25 percent of the \ncases, meaning compliance in 50 to 75 percent. \n \nTr. at 4021 (Kastner).  And then there are situations where there is even less evidence and you \nhave treatment options “where only 25 percent of the practitioners might be expected to \ncomply.”  Tr. at 4021 (Kastner).  “And most organizations recognize that the quality of evidence \nis insufficient to articulate standards.”  Tr. at 3992 (Kastner).   \n  There is no standard for the psychiatric diagnosis of a person with developmental \ndisabilities.  Tr. at 4025 (Kastner).  DM-ID does not have strong evidence to support it.  Tr. at \n4022 (Kastner).  There is no evidence at all that it is a accepted a standard of care.  It was never \nvalidated or studied.  Tr. at 4022 (Kastner).   \n  65\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 66 of 383\n  Dr. Kastner contributed to the content of a book entitled “International Consensus \nManual” which Dr. Mikkelsen recommends as one of two books that should be on the shelf of \nanyone interested in developmental disabilities.  Tr. at 3969, 3970 (Kastner).  Although the \nInternational Consensus addresses evidence based practice, it was never meant to be a standard \nrather it was intended to be an educational resource.  Tr. at 3970 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Gary Stewart is CHDC’s on-call physician.  Tr. at 1725 (Thomas).  Dr. Stewart is on-\ncall the majority of the time.  When he is unavailable, the other CHDC physicians cover on-call.  \nTr. at 1725 (Thomas). \nDr. Stewart maintains a medical practice apart from his work at CHDC.  Dr. Stewart’s \nworkload does not concern Dr. Thomas, as Medical Director of the facility.  Tr. at 1725, 1726 \n(Thomas). \nDr. Stewart has privileges to admit CHDC residents to the local Conway hospital, \nConway Regional Center.  Tr. at 1726 (Thomas). \nDr. Stewart is subject to peer review at physician meetings.  Tr. at 1726, 1727 (Thomas).  \nDr. Stewart does attend the physician peer review meetings.  Tr. at 1727, 1728, 1756 (Thomas). \nAs to Mikkelsen’s allegations as to after hours on-call medical services, he could not \noffer any standard.  Tr. at 4173 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner stated: \nAnd actually I wish he had suggested one because most \nICFs don't have the availability of a full-time physician on \nsite to provide after hours coverage. It's the outlier. I'm \nnot saying -- you know, it's really unusual. And it's a \nwonderful thing. It's a great resource to the residents of \nCHDC that there is a full-time physician available after hours \nwho is familiar with them, is familiar with the facility, with \ntheir personal needs. And that improves the quality of care. \nIt actually improves continuity because you're not referring \npeople who are acutely ill after hours to healthcare settings \nwhere there's no one who knows them. The typical ICF doesn't \nhave the availability of Dr. Stewart and will have to send that \n  66\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 67 of 383\nindividual not to the infirmary because most of them don't have an \ninfirmary, but straight to the ER. And depending on the hospital \nand the doctor that's on-call, they very well could find someone \nthere who don't know anything about them, and that exposes them \nto additional risks. And I think the after hours on-call services \nis actually one of the strengths of the facility. \n \nTr. at 4173 (Kastner).   \nThe infirmary is for patients who are ill, who would benefit from 24 hour RN care.  They \nmay require IV fluids, but their condition is not such that they need to be sent to the hospital.  Tr. \nat 5462 (Parmley).  \nThe infirmary has never served as an impediment to proper care for residents.  Tr. at 5463 \n(Parmley).  Dr. Parmley stated that the infirmary is a  “wonderful asset to have.”  Tr. at 5463 \n(Parmley). \nRegistered nurses and LPNs are available at the infirmary 24 hours a day.  Tr. at 5463 \n(Parmley).       \nDr. Schulz assisted with the development of the role of the infirmary within the care \ndelivery spectrum.     \nAnd we used standards that were developed by the industry and \napplied them to our clients out th ere so that when they m et a \ncertain level of clinical need, they could legitimately be transferred \nto a tertiary care center, such as Conway Regional or UAMS  or at \nChildren’s Hospital.  That program we started eight years ago and \nit’s used every nursing shift, three times a day, if not more, if need \nbe,  to evaluate every patient th at’s  sick enough to be in the \ninfirmary.  The idea was not to keep the patients too long so their \nstatus became less stable and we could ship them on to definitive \ncare.  And then that was used by the other facilities as well as a \nstandard by which all patients would be judged to see if they need \nto go to the hospital.   \n \nTr. at 6180, 6181 (Schulz). \n  67\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 68 of 383\nPlaintiff’s witness, Crawford, did not know the rate of hospitalizations that could \nreasonably be expected at a facility such as CHDC.  Tr. at 2945 (Crawford).  Crawford did not \nknow whether the rate of hospitalizations at CHDC is higher or lower than what is observed at \nnursing homes.  Tr. at 2945 (Crawford).  Crawford was unable to provide any specific instances \nwhere the staff at CHDC failed to exercise professional judgment or violated standard of care in \nthe management of a specific individual leading up to hospitalization.  Tr. at 2945, 2946 \n(Crawford).   \nAs to Mikkelsen’s alleged concerns over “termination of life” decisions, Dr. Kastner \nstated: \nAs I said yesterday, I take great offense to Dr. \nMikkelsen's implication that there is any process at CHDC that \nrelates to a decision to terminate life. That is -- it crossed a line for \nme. And I want to make it absolutely clear, it's unacceptable to \ndescribe the practices at CHDC in that fashion. People in the \ncourse of their lives, they reach a point where their lives will end \nand their loved ones need to be able to make a determination about \nthe appropriateness of care that is rendered at the end of life. \n \nOne way of looking at that, characterizing the pattern of \nend of life care, is to look at the do not resuscitate orders. \nAnd Dr. Mikkelsen had a benchmark in his reports in the \nreferences that allowed us to compare end of life care in a \nvery gross and general way between the Southbury Training \nSchool in Connecticut and CHDC. And that was the use of the do \nnot resuscitate order. And I can't remember which one was 58 and \nwhich one was 59 percent, but they are both approximately \ncomparable, meaning that the healthcare providers at Southbury \nTraining School and the healthcare providers at CHDC are \napproaching this issue in generally the same way. There's no gross \nunderutilization of DNRs at CHDC, there's no gross \noverutilization. \n \nTr. at 4175 (Kastner).   \n  Dr, Mikkelsen had a “subjective concern” on his part that hospice was considered within \na few days of onset of an illness before it was clear that the illness was terminal.  Tr. at 3849, \n  68\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 69 of 383\n3850 (Mikkelsen).  However, Mikkelsen could not identify any specific instances where he \nbelieved that treatment was inappropriately withheld from a CHDC resident.  Tr. at 3850 \n(Mikkelsen).   \nThere is no evidence that there is any increased risk of aspiration pneumonia as compared \nto comparable facilities identified by Mikkelsen.  Tr. at 4064 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Warren reviewed the use of stat meds at CHDC.  CHDC’s use of stat meds meets \ngenerally accepted professional standards.  Tr. at 4564 (Warren).   \n \n4.  Psychiatric Care For Children or Adolescents at CHDC Met or \nExceeded Accepted Professional Standards \n \n  Dr. Kraus’ role in this case was to assess the psychiatric services provided by CHDC to \nchildren residing at CHDC.  Tr. at 6200 (Kraus).   \nThe defendants sent Dr. Kraus a variety of documents with respect to expert opinions.  \nHowever, Dr. Kraus selected his own patient records to review and his own on-site itinerary.  Tr. \nat 6243 (Kraus).   In conducting his review of CHDC, Dr. Kraus interviewed such individuals as \nMr. Price, Ms. Miller, Ms. Henderson, Mr. Burgess, several psychologists, some resident staff, \none or two nurses, Dr. Callahan, Dr. Schulz, Dr. Parmley, developmental pediatricians, and Dr. \nLea.  Tr. at 6200, 6201 (Kraus).  Dr. Kraus reviewed the expert reports and depositions of Drs. \nHolloway, Mikkelsen, and Manikam.  Tr. at 6201 (Kraus).   \n  Dr. Kraus reviewed all the charts of children being treated with psychotropic \nmedications, who were being seen by the psychiatrist or physician.  Tr. at 6201, 6202 (Kraus).   \nDr. Kraus also reviewed: the 2004 CRIPA investigation; the January 2010 CARF accreditation \nletter; CHDC behavior support plans, safety plans; CHDC individual programming, behavioral \nprogramming, and policies; 2008 residential restraint policies; lab surveillance guidelines; 2005, \n  69\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 70 of 383\n2006, 2007 restraint summaries; DOJ experts’ curriculum vitae; April 2004 reports of findings of \nthe Civil Rights Division; list of all residents; the declaration of Jodie Holloway; the 2009 CARF \nsurvey report; the pharmacy side-effect sheets; and the vitae of current CHDC physicians.  Tr. at \n6203, 6204 (Kraus).   \n  Dr. Kraus conducted a site visit and made observations at CHDC.  He essentially \nobserved each child whose charts he reviewed.  Tr. at 6203, 6204 (Kraus).  He reviewed the \nvarious parameters, conducted staff interviews, performed chart reviews, observed all the \nchildren and adolescents on the psychiatrist’s caseload, and looked at those children, observed \nthose children, very carefully.  Tr. at 6239, 6240 (Kraus).   \n  Regarding the biopsychosocial approach, at the time of Dr. Kraus’ assessment there was \nno national standard of care.  Thus he relied on the practice parameter that was articulated in \n2005 by the Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.  He also relied on other standards.  \nTr. at 6234 (Kraus).   \n  Overall the psychiatric care of the children residing at CHDC is reasonable and consistent \nwith the community standards for care.  CHDC meets accepted professional standards in its \nprovision of psychiatric services to children.  Tr. at 6212 (Kraus).   \nCHDC utilizes a psychiatric consultant, physicians with tremendous pediatric care \nexperience, physicians trained in working with children with developmental disabilities, and a \nfamily practice physician.  Tr. at 6213 (Kraus).  \nDr. Kraus stated: \nI felt that the care was relatively impressive in regards to the level \nof stability that they’ve had, the lack of any type of severe \nmorbidity or mortality, the lack of hospitalizations.  These are kids \nwho were having repeated hospitalizations and now are not.  And \nvariable attempts, very significant attempts in trying to lower \n  70\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 71 of 383\nmedications on these kids, but for many of these kids, not having \nthat possible and that they would become more aggressive.   \n \nTr. at 6213 (Kraus).   \nHaving a psychiatric evaluation within 30 days of admission is not a definitive \nrequirement.  “I think that it would be ideal if they could be, but certainly not a requirement.”  \nTr. at 6338 (Kraus).   \nDr. Kraus saw “no negative sequelae of children” where the psychiatric evaluation did \nnot occur within 30 days of admission.  Tr. at 6368, 6369 (Kraus).   \nThe developmental pediatricians, which I think go beyond primary \ncare, and the family practice physician will access and look at the \nchildren.  Typically, they don’t make medication changes, but they \nwill be seen by physicians in the interim from when Dr. Callahan \nsees them. \n \nTr. at 6323 (Kraus).   \nDr. Kraus explained: \n…. I can’t tell you whether the primary care or the developmental \npediatrician saw that child in that interim period.  What I can tell \nyou is when you look at the chart, there seems to be a level of \nstability with the child.  There were no horrid adverse medication \nerrors that can be seen.  In my assessment of the kids, there were \nno horrid movement disorders or other types of side effects see.  \nThe one issue which we described yesterday in come detail \nregarding the lithium level was the primary issue.  I think that this \nwhole concept is greatly exaggerated and distorted.   \n \nTr. at 6325 (Kraus).   \n  Dr. Kraus found that there is adequate communication between Dr. Callahan and the staff \nand the other physicians.  Tr. at 6213 (Kraus). The communication between Dr. Callahan and the \nstaff and other physicians may not always be clearly documented in the charts, but the end result \n  71\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 72 of 383\nof the communication is documented in the charts.  Tr. at 6214 (Kraus).  Dr. Kraus knows that \nDr. Callahan has a comprehensive understanding of his patients, “really what is striking is how \nmany patients he knows without looking at the charts.”  Tr. at 6220 (Kraus).   \n  It is not appropriate for Dr. Holloway to use the requirements for inpatient psychiatric \nfacilities and apply them to a residential setting like CHDC for the developmentally disabled.  \nTr. at 6206 (Kraus).  Dr. Kraus explained: \nInpatient facilities are the most restrictive mental health \ninterventions that we have.  There are very strict requirements as a \nresult of that, primarily related to Eight Amendment issues, but \nother, you know, restriction components as well.  And that not only \nis it my opinion that one should not apply inpatient requirements to \nthis facility, but in all of the other DOJ work - - and this is public \nknowledge - - that I’d done in regards to the juvenile correctional \nfacilities, it was very clear, and this was discussed repetitively, that \ninpatient facilities are simply too restrictive to compare to, for \nexample, a juvenile correctional facility, which it was their opinion \nwas most closely related to a residential facility, but not to an \ninpatient facility.   \n \nTr. at 6206, 6207 (Kraus).  Similarly, Dr. Kastner believes that the application of JCAHO \nstandards to CHDC s inappropriate because those standards only apply to an inpatient psychiatric \nunit at a hospital.  Tr. at 4009 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kraus noted that one consideration in assessing the adequacy of psychiatric care is \nwhether psychiatrists see an individual within one month of admission and at least quarterly \nthereafter.  However, Dr. Kraus clarified: \nI think that that is a nice general concept, but one that may have \nvariability to it.  So there are some children that need to be seen far \nquicker than that.  There are some facilities that have children that \nare very high suicide risks and they need to be seen sometimes \nwithin 24 to 48 hours.  There are other types of facilities, Conway \nand others, where you may have children that are more medically \nunstable where it’s more important that they see the general \nphysician, the pediatrician, to stabilized the medically. \n  72\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 73 of 383\n \nTr. at 6235, 6236 (Kraus).  In some cases, a wait for over a month before seeing a consulting \npsychiatrist is acceptable. “Each facility is different in regards to the practice.”  Tr. at 6236, 6237 \n(Kraus).    Dr. Kraus, in his own practice, typically does not make any changes when he first sees \nan individual.  He likes to see an individual adjust to a program and he is not inclined to \nimmediately change their medication.  CHDC, similarly, would just continue their needs prior to \nthe individual’s psychiatric consultation, perhaps taking labs, in the interim.  Tr. at 6377, 6378 \n(Kraus).   Dr. Kraus takes issue with the “guidelines that have a definitive number connected to it \nbecause it takes away the clinical judgment of the treater.”  Tr. at 6328 (Kraus).    \n  The parameters set by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for \nCHDC’s use of psychotropic medications in child and adolescents “were essentially followed.”  \nTr. at 6207 (Kraus).   \n  Dr. Callahan appropriately assesses his patients for side effects.  Tr. at 6221 (Kraus).  \nThere was adequate assessment and documentation of side effects.  Tr. at 6220, 6221 (Kraus).   \nThere are meetings where medication side effects are reviewed and then sent to the parents for \ntheir consent.  Tr. at 6221, 6222 (Kraus).    “…. I don’t know anybody that makes formal reports \nover relatively minor side effects.  They adjust the dosage, talk to staff, and they move on.”  Tr. \nat 6331 (Kraus).  He would not expect every adverse drug reaction to be reported to him.  \nWhether or not he would expect such a report depends on the significance of the adverse drug \nevent.  Tr. at 6374 (Kraus).  An institution’s procedures regarding adverse drug events may be a \npositive thing to know, however, alone, it would not impact on patient care.  Tr. at 6334 (Kraus).    \n  Tardive dyskinesia is potentially a permanent movement disorder.  It is a potential side \neffect from neuroleptic medications such as Thorazine or Mellaril, it is a lesser potential side \n  73\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 74 of 383\neffect for Risperdal or Seroquel (.3 percent likelihood, as opposed to 15 percent).  Tr. at 6214, \n6215 (Kraus).  “I did not see tardive dyskinesia in any one of the kids that I saw.”  Tr. at 6215 \n(Kraus).   \n  Dr. Kastner found that the rates of tardive dyskinesia at CHDC are very low, and, in fact, \nare below the benchmark identified by Plaintiff’s witness, Holloway.  Tr. at 4084 (Kastner).  The \nAIMS instrument is used appropriately at CHDC and there is no greater occurrence of tardive \ndyskinesia at CHDC than would be observed at any other comparable facility.  Tr. at 4084 \n(Kastner).  Dr. Holloway said the rate of tardive dyskinesia that normally would be observed in \nan ICF/MR would be 2 to 20 percent, and the rate of tardive dyskinesia at CHDC is less than 2 \npercent.  Tr. at 3979 (Kastner).   \n  Extrapyramidal side effects such as tremors or akathisia are reversible.  “Uncomfortable, \nbut far less of an immediate concern.”  Tr. at 6215 (Kraus).  Extrapyramidal side effects are \nvariable. \nIn other words, you may see children at times who may have some \nextrapyramidal side effects and other times they may not.  At the \ntime I was there, the kids that I observed, I saw nobody that had \nParkinsonian or extrapyramidal side effects.   \n \nTr. at 6215 (Kraus).   \n  It is appropriate for the medications to focus on the behavioral concern of the child.   \nAbsolutely.  Medication focus should always focus on the behavioral concern.  You don’t \ntreat a diagnosis, you treat the behaviors. \n \nTr. at 6223, 6273 (Kraus).   “What is important is to look at what the symptoms are and attempt \nto do your best to treat them.”  Tr. at 6376 (Kraus).  \n  74\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 75 of 383\n  Regardless of the National Institutes of Health study on the efficacy of Celexa, Dr. Kraus \nstill agrees with what he represented that “citalopram as an SSRI can still potentially be helpful \nin some children with autistic spectrum disorder.”  Tr. at 6297 (Kraus).  P. Ex. LK-1 and LK-2, \narticles on the efficacy of certain medications, do not “limit the clinical judgment and the \npotential usefulness of SSRIs in certain children with autism, depression, and anxiety disorders.”  \nTr. at 6300 (Kraus).  “The use of citalopram or escitalopram for children with autism is still not \ncontradicted.”  Tr. at 6301 (Kraus).   \n[M]edication efficacy is followed up by a variety of staff and the \nphysician through numerous methods, some through measurement, \nand we described yesterday, others through assessment of the child \nor reports from the staff.  So some is quantitative and some is \nqualitative.   \n \nTr. at 6318 (Kraus).   \nCiting to a commentary written by Fred Volkmar, a preeminent expert on autism, Dr. \nKraus quoted: \nAs the authors note, and as with all negative studies, there is \nalways the possibility that a different result might have been \nobtained with a larger sample. \n \nTr. at 6371 (Kraus).  Regarding sample size, Dr. Kraus did not agree that it is always the case \nthat a larger sample will alter the results.  He explained: \nThere’s typically a point in research where they’ll say this is \nsufficient or there’s enough repetitive studies to solidify this \nparticular issue.  This is an issue which is not completely clear and \nnot completely understood, which is why he says we need more \nstudies of this kid to advance research and guide clinical practice.  \nWe’re just not completely there yet. \n \n  75\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 76 of 383\nTr. at 6384 (Kraus).  Physicians should not rely upon just one isolated study to change their \nwhole treatment.  Tr. at 6371 (Kraus).  There is not enough information in the study to result in \nsuch strong action regarding the use of citalopram.  Tr. at 6372 (Kraus).  “[P]eople should have \ncaution about simply not using a medication that potentially could be helpful based on this one \nstudy.”  Tr. at 6372 (Kraus).   \nRegarding Pl. Ex. LK-2 and LK-3, Dr. Kraus explained: \nOne thing that the abstract describes in the results, as you’ve just \ndescribed, is the side effects are, in part, associated with the \ncitalopram.  Of course, if one, on one hand, doesn’t give any \nmedication and on the other hand gives the medication, that group \nof people getting the medications are going to have some \npercentage of side effects that the group not getting the medication \nis going to have, and that’s what they describe there.   \n \nTr. at 6379 (Kraus).  Dr. Kraus also questioned whether the results related to using the \nmedication for anxiety or depression or actually using it for the same issues being addressed in \nthe study.  Tr. at 6380 (Kraus).     \n  Dr, Kraus saw evidence in the records that primary care physicians follow up on \nmedication changes at CHDC.  Tr. at 6324 (Kraus).   \n  Dr. Kraus reviewed the charts of the following children residing at CHDC:  L.W., B.B., \nT.C., J.B., C.A, M.B., K.C., H.B., J.B., D.B., A.B., M.G., K.H., C.J,. R.D., M.M., R.C., H.A., \nB.H., C.L., T.N., J.M., T.T., C.T., S.W., N.S., J.R., T.S., C.S., C.W., M.W..  Dr. Kraus reviewed \n35 charts in total.  Some were not notable.  Tr. at 6209 (Kraus).  (The transcript notes review of \nT.M., however, Dr. Kraus explained that this was a typographical error and all references to \n“T.M.” in his report should be read as “T.N.”.  Tr. at 6209, 6210 (Kraus).)  Dr. Kraus “saw all, \nand if not all, almost all the children.”  Tr. at 6216 (Kraus).   \n   B.B.  \n  76\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 77 of 383\nTardive dyskinesia is a potential side effect of neurological medication.  B.B. “presented \nas a child with cerebral palsy, or symptoms consistent with cerebral palsy.” B.B. did not have \nchoreoathetic movements associated with tardive dyskinesia.  Tr. at 6208 (Kraus).     \n    C.L.  \nC.L. had come from the community with orders from the community psychiatrist to bring \nhis lithium level up to 600 milligrams twice a day.  C.L. was monitored as they raised the lithium \nlevels.  After being placed at CHDC the level was .5.  Within a week later the level was 1.  \nMonths later, C.L. was vomiting small amounts and had an unsteady gate.  His lithium level was \nelevated to 4.  CHDC sent him to the Conway Medical Center and then he was sent on to the \nUniversity Hospital in Little Rock.  It was determined that C.L. also had pneumonia.  C.L. had \nseveral rounds of dialysis, but his levels did not decrease.  It was learned later that the tubes that \nwere used to draw his blood contained a lithium base, increasing the lithium level reported in his \ntests.  His EKG tested normal.  No kidney damage was determined.  Tr. at 6216, 6217, 6218 \n(Kraus).  C.L. has had no signs of kidney damage or any other long term effects from the raised \nlithium levels.  Tr. at 6218 (Kraus).   \nCHDC’s treatment and care of C.L. met accepted professional standards. \nI think not only were they right on top of this and did intervene \nquickly, but I think if this had happened in a community place, this \nis a child that would have died.  And then actually as opposed to \nlooking at this as a problem from the center, I think that once you \nlook at this and see how quickly they were able to respond, and \nhaving these hospitals and the quick response I think saved this \nboy’s life. \n \nTr. at 6218 (Kraus).  Dr. Kraus would not agree that thirst is a sign of lithium toxicity.  “Thirst \ncan be a sign of simply being on lithium, period.”  Tr. at 6282 (Kraus).  “Refusing a meal is not \nnecessarily a lithium issue.”  Tr. at 6283 (Kraus).   When asked if it were reasonable for CHDC \n  77\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 78 of 383\nto admit C.L. to the CHDC infirmary after testing a lithium level of 4 and to repeat the tests, for \na more thorough reading, the next morning, before sending C.L. to the hospital, Dr. Kraus agreed \nthat the first reading could have been artificially high if taken after the administration of lithium. \nDr. Kraus deferred to the treating physician on his reasoning as to this decision. Tr. at 6375 \n(Kraus).       \n  Dr. Kastner noted that there is no guideline on the management of lithium overdose.  Tr. \nat 4026 (Kastner).   \n  As observed by Dr. Warren, if someone is dehydrated, it is very easy for them to get \nlithium toxicity.  “It is not a question of bad care.”  Tr. at 4727 (Warren). \n  At the time of admission, C.L. was under the care of Dr. Farrell, the outpatient \npsychiatrist.  C.L. was admitted to CHDC on respite.  Tr. at 3878 (Mikkelsen).  C.L.’s mother \nwas unable to care for him in their home due to his agitation and tantrums, running away, and \nbiting people.  (Mikkelsen).   \nBetween March 28, 2008, and May 1, 2008, at CHDC, Dr. Lea was the treating \nphysician.  Tr. at 3879 (Mikkelsen).  C.L.’s dose in Lithium was increased by the outpatient \npsychiatrist, Dr. Farrell, before his admission to CHDC.  Tr. at 3879 (Mikkelsen).    \nLithium will achieve a steady state in approximately a week.  A steady state is when the \n“same dose will produce the same blood level.” Tr. at 3879 (Mikkelsen).   \nOn March 28th the Lithium would not have been administered to C.L. for a sufficient amount of \ntime to achieve a steady state.  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that it would be reasonable to have \nperformed a second Lithium level on April 1, 2008.  Tr. at 3879, 3880 (Mikkelsen).   \nOther than a reference to limited nausea and vomiting in one progress note, Dr. \nMikkelsen agreed that C.L.’s records between March 28th and May 1st did not indicate any \n  78\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 79 of 383\nsymptoms consistent with moderate or severe Lithium toxicity.  Tr. at 3881 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. \nMikkelsen stated that per his report, C.L. was admitted to the infirmary on May 1st at 9:00 p.m.  \nTr. at 3881, 3882 (Mikkelsen). \n  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that the Conway Regional Medical Center record uses the word \n“comatose”, but  C.L. did not develop a coma until approximately four hours after he had been \nadmitted there.  Tr. at 3882 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen stated that there would be significance in the white blood cell count on \narrival to the hospital if C.L. had an infection.  Dr. Mikkelsen was not aware that C.L. was \ndiagnosed with pneumonia.  Tr. at 3882, 3883 (Mikkelsen).  C.L. received treatment with \nOmnicef after his return.  It is an antibiotic.  Tr. at 3883 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen acknowledged that pneumonia can affect an individual’s level of \nhydration.  To a “certain degree”, that hydration can affect Lithium levels.  Tr. at 3883, 3884 \n(Mikkelsen).   \nC.L. has had a number of renal function tests since his lithium toxicity, and  “basically \nthe results have been normal so far.”  Tr. at 3884 (Mikkelsen).     \n  Dr. Parmley noted that CL receives monitoring by CHDC for his kidney function, every \nsix months.  It has always shown to be within normal range.  Tr. at 5495 (Parmley).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that it is possible that C.L. has not been consistently been given the \nLithium at home, and then had received it consistently at CHDC, his level could increase rapidly.  \n“I’ve seen that.”  Tr. at 3884, 3885 (Mikkelsen). \n  Dr. Holloway did not  know if C.L. was being seen by an outside psychiatrist, when C.L. \nhad been treated by Dr. Ferrell even before he was admitted to CHDC.  Tr. at 2676 (Holloway).  \nDr. Holloway made accusations about Dr. Callahan and the quality of care at CHDC based on \n  79\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 80 of 383\nlimited information about C.L.’s case.   Dr. Holloway did not review C.L.’s medical history \nincluding his hospital records to see why his lithium levels increased.  Tr. at 2677 (Holloway).  \nDr. Holloway agrees that when C.L. contracted pneumonia, that was the cause of his increased \nlithium levels.  Tr. at 2677 (Holloway).   \n    T.N.         \nT.N. had an orchiectomy.  In 2005 he had the removal of his right testicle, as there was \nno blood flow to that testicle.  In 2009, it was detected that his left testicle was avascular and \nthere was no testosterone coming from it.  They removed his left testicle as well.  Dr. Kraus \nobserved him.  He was calm.  He asked him to raise his arms, and he showed no tremors.  For the \nmost part, Dr. Kraus observed him from a distance.  When he did approach him, he had some \ninteraction with him and he remained relatively calm.  Tr. at 6118-6220 (Kraus).  Dr. Kraus saw \nno evidence of any medication side effects for T.N., “[a]bsolutely none.”  Tr. at 6220 (Kraus).           \n  Dr. Kraus’ also had an issue with Dr. Holloway’s findings on T.N. was regarding her \nobservations of T.N..  The interaction that she described was at variance to what Dr. Kraus \nobserved.  Tr. at 6373 (Kraus).   \nC.J.’s neurologist, outside of CHDC, prescribed the Keppra.  Tr. at 3873 (Mikkelsen).   \nWhat led Dr. Mikkelsen to his suspected diagnosis of NMS was “[t]he stiffness and the \nelevated C.K. and the correlation with the increase in the Haldol.”  Tr. at 3873 (Mikkelsen).   Dr. \nMikkelsen, however, agreed that an elevated C.K. does not always mean someone has NMS.  Tr. \nat 3873, 3874 (Mikkelsen).  It can be true that an individual has really high C.K. scores and does \nnot have NMS.  Tr. at 3874 (Mikkelsen).   \n  80\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 81 of 383\nDr. Mikkelsen also admitted that upgoing toes may suggest a central nervous system \nlesion, such as a stroke, and that upgoing toes are not typically seen in NMS.  Tr. at 3874 \n(Mkkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen acknowledged that  “far less than 1 percent” of individuals who take \nneuroleptic medication develop NMS.  Tr. at 3874 (Mikkelsen).  He also agreed that a very small \npercentage of people who have NMS do not have a fever, and C.J. did not have a fever.  Tr. at \n3874, 3875 (Mikkelsen).  As a result, it is unlikely that C.J. has NMS.   \nDr. Mikkelsen did notice in other records that Dr. Callahan was aware and sensitive to \nNMS.  Tr. at 3875 (Mikkelsen).   \n    S.A.  \n  S.A. has had a very clear significant reduction in the amount of medications she takes.  \nTr. at 4238 (Kastner).  CHDC has clearly improved the quality of her care.  Tr. at 4239 \n(Kastner).  Dr. Holloway admits that if S.A. was having medications tapered at CHDC, then that \nwould be an indication that she is receiving quality care.  Tr. at 2681 (Holloway). \n    A.C.J. \n  Although Holloway claims that A.C.J. is on six (6) psychotropic medications, actually \nfive (5) are anti-epileptic medications.  Tr. at 4239, 4240 (Kastner).  Also, her psychiatric care is \nprovided by a psychiatrist outside of CHDC.  Tr. at 4240 (Kastner).   \n  Dr, Holloway does not know whether A.C.J. has seizure disorder which requires him to \ntake five different medications to manage,  She also does not know if A.C.J. is seeing an \nepileptologist.  Tr. at 2673 (Holloway).  A.C.J. is an outliner because he has the greatest use of \npsychotropic medication at CHDC during the two-year period that Dr. Holloway studied.  Tr. at \n2673 (Holloway).  A.C.J. isn’t even on Dr, Callahan’s caseload, because of her severe seizure \n  81\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 82 of 383\ndisorder, and she is seen by Dr. Farrell at another private setting away from the facility,  Tr. at \n2673 (Holloway).  A.C.J.’s parents chose Dr. Farrell because they had a long standing \nrelationship with him.  Tr. at 2673 (Holloway).   \n    A.M.B. \n  As to A.M.B., and Dr. Holloway’s alleged concerns, Dr. Kastner stated: \nWhat I would say is that the symptoms were well \ncharacterized in the record. There was a determination, a \njudgment, made by the treating physicians as to the cause of \nthose symptoms, and appropriate treatment was implemented. So \nthere really isn't a sufficient basis in the record to allow a \nthird party, such as myself or Dr. Holloway, to reach an \nindependent diagnosis and therefore to criticize any treatment \nthat might be offered to address those symptoms.   \n \nTr. 4241 (Kastner). \nDiagnostic evaluations were “relatively comprehensive”.  Dr. Kraus did not evaluate \nthem in detail, however, he noted that they were clearly part of the children’s files.  Tr. at 6210 \n(Kraus).  Dr. Kraus reviewed the diagnostic evaluations for: C.A., J.B., H.B., M.B., H.A., A.B., \nJ.B., D.B., K.C., T.C., R.C., R.D., M.G., C.H., B.H., C.J., C.L., J.M., M.M., J.R., B.R., C.S., \nZ.S., T.S., N.S., C.T., C.W., S.W., B.W., M.W., L.W., J.W.  Tr. at 6210 (Kraus).   \nT.C.’s dosage of Risperdal was reduced significantly over the period of time he was at \nCHDC.  Tr. at 4184 (Kastner).  He came to CHDC on high doses of Risperdol prescribed by a \ncommunity physician.  Tr. at 4184 (Kastner).  Reductions in Respirdal are often associated with \nweight loss and T.C. lost weight.  Tr. at 4185 (Kastner).  T.C.’s weight never fell out of the range \nfor an ideal body weight.  Tr. at 4185 (Kastner).   \n  T. C., is a six-year-old, had challenging behaviors that resulted in his placement at \nCHDC.  As described by Dr. Kastner:  \n  82\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 83 of 383\nAlthough T is 6 years old, he is large for his age and it is \nimpossible for his petite grandmother to handle him when out of \ncontrol. He will harm himself and others by banging his head, \nkicking, biting, pulling hair, and hitting. He will also eat non-\nnutritive items. He climbs constantly. To ensure his safety, there is \nno dining table in the room. Other measures to prevent injury are \noutside doors locked, bathroom doors locked, kitchen cabinets tied \nshut, refrigerator chained shut, faucet knobs removed, electric \nstove burners removed, mattresses placed on floor, and additional \nmattresses propped against the window in T's room. DDS service \nspecialist attempted to find DDS special needs and integrated \nsupports, however, there were no providers in the area. \n \nTr. at 4185, 4186 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen alleged that Dr. Callahan will prescribe two neuroleptic medications to \nchildren as young as the age of six, but T.C. was prescribed two neuroleptics by an outside \nphysician before T.C. ever came to CHDC.  Tr. at 4188 (Kastner).   \nT.C. arrived at CHDC on an emergency basis for emergency respite.  He was strapped to \na papoose board to transport him due to his aggressive behavior.  Tr. at 3868 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. \nMikkelsen agreed that T.C. was unable to be cared for at home.  Tr. at 3868 (Mikkelsen).   \nAt the time of his admission, T.C. was taking Riperidone, Thorazine and Clonidine.  Tr. \nat 3868 (Mikkelsen).  Risperidone and Thorazine are neuroleptic medications and were \nprescribed by the physicians at the Arkansas Children’s Hospital.  Tr. at 3868 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that the Arkansas Children’s Hospital is a referral specialty \nhospital.  Tr. at 3869 (Mikkelsen). \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that by May 2009, the total daily dose of psychotropic medication \nfor T.C. had been reduced.  Tr. at 3869 (Mikkelsen).  He agreed that Risperdal as used for autism \ncan be effective.  Tr. at 3870 (Mikkelsen).    \n  83\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 84 of 383\nDr. Mikkelsen clarified on cross-examination that he did not say that T.C. had a diagnosis \nof dysphagia or that there was evidence in the record that he did, he said that he would suspect \nsome sort of swallowing problem.  Tr. at 3870 (Mikkelsen).     \nDr. Mikkelsen did not know whether T.C. is within the desired weight for his height.  Tr. \nat 3871 (Mikkelsen).   \n   Dr. Callahan has done a sufficient job in the diagnosis of children.  Tr. at 6222 (Kraus).   \n… When we look at the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual, it \nbecomes far more complicated in regards to making diagnoses \nwith kids with severe developmental delays and just severe mental \nretardation, and what becomes much - -you try to do it, you do \nyour best.  I think if you were to take ten psychiatrists and put \nthem in a room with a child with a severe delay, they could all \ncome up with potentially different diagnoses, all of which they \nprobably could find a basis for in the DSM.  What is most \nimportant is to look at what the behaviors are of the child, to have \nsomething that has some basis diagnostically, and then to look at \nwhat the behaviors are of the child so you can justify what the \ntreatment is. \n \nTr. at 6223 (Kraus).  Assessment of children at CHDC is diagnostically adequate and consistent \nwith the community norms and medically accepted professional standards.  Tr. at 6224 (Kraus).   \nDr. Kraus stated: \nThere may be more severe psychopathology in particular with the \nhigher functioning kids, it becomes far more confusing and less \nclear in regards to definitive diagnoses.  So when that’s the case, \nyou could have ten child psychiatrists come in, and separate from \nthe MR diagnoses, probably come up with ten different potential \ndiagnoses that the child may have, some of which may have a \nmedication treatment, others that may not. \n \nTr. at 6376 (Kraus).     \n  Dr. Kraus reviewed the records for information as to why each child was referred to \nCHDC. Regarding the children’s records that he reviewed, Dr. Kraus noted that they had \n  84\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 85 of 383\ninterventions prior to their admissions to CHDC.  Interventions included multiple \nhospitalizations, the involvement of DCFS, multiple foster home placements, sometimes \nspecialized foster home placements, and placements with other residential services, such as \nEaster Seals.  Tr. at 6211 (Kraus).  \nRegarding the children than have been placed at CHDC, Dr. Kraus noted: \n[T]hese kids had been in, many of them in multiple \nhospitalizations, with treatment with child and adolescent \npsychiatrists, such as at the University Hospital here in Little Rock, \nand still could not be stabilized on an outpatient basis.  And I’m \nnot sure if it could be completely appreciated how complicated the \ndevelopmental delays, the behavioral difficulties, psychiatric and \nmedical difficulties are of these kids and why they’ve needed this \ntype of facility so that they can safely, hopefully, grow to as much \nas they can to their full potential, and in my opinion, having less \nlikelihood of morbidity or mortality, both for themselves as well as \nothers.  Many, many of these kids were actually ultimately placed \nthere because they’re so aggressive that even with all of the \nmedications they’d been on could not be stabilized.   \n \nTr. at 6212 (Kraus).  The only other option for some of these children is to hospitalize them, \nwhich is a “significantly more restrictive alternative.”  Tr. at 6212 (Kraus).    \n  Similarly, as to L. W., Dr. Kastner stated: \nL displays inappropriate interpersonal \nand social skills. Reports indicate that he will avoid school \npeers and is often aggressive to siblings. L displays temper \ntantrums, aggression, destruction of property, and \nself-injurious behavior. L will bang his head to the point of \nleaving knots and scratches on his head. He has put his head \nthrough a large living room window at home and a window at the \nArkansas Children's Hospital reception desk. L removed trim \noff the walls of his home, disassembled his dresser, turned \nover a home entertainment center and four televisions. His \nparents state that he does not appear to know what authority \nis. \n \n  85\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 86 of 383\nTr. at 4233 (Kastner).  L. W. could not be served by a waiver-funded provider because there \nwere behavioral services that it could not provide.  Tr. at 4234 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Holloway admits that she made no attempt to check L.W.’s records to see what \nmedications that he came in to compare that to what he was on at the time of her review.  Tr. at \n2671 (Holloway).   \n  The supine restraints, such as papoose boards, are consistent with regards to what is used \nthroughout the country.  “[T]here was essentially no significant morbidity, and certainly no \nmortality associated in recent time in regards to the use of restraint.”  Tr. at 6208 (Kraus).    \n  Dr. Kraus commented on Dr. Mikkelsen’s implication that some of the children’s \nbehaviors were worsening because of their environment at CHDC.   \nAnd the reality is that when you have a therapeutic milieu, when \nyou have a group of kids that are interacting, with developmental \ndelays or not, there are going to be interactions at times that will \ncause a child to react in a negative context.  That’s simply a \nprocess of the milieu.  You’ll see that on an inpatient unit, you’ll \nsee that anywhere.  Short of keeping a child in a bubble, which \ncertainly is not going to help them, there’s no way to avoid that.  If \na child is going to have some ability to react to changes in their \nenvironment, perhaps these changes in the milieu, although in the \nshort term may have some negative reaction, perhaps causing a \nchild to become aggressive, in the long run may have a positive \nreaction if the child can learn potentially a better approach to \nresponding to that type of change in their environment. \n \nTr. at 6224, 6225 (Kraus).    \nAggression is discussed in terms of increasing and decreasing medication and is one of \nthe core components for stabilization.  Tr. at 6320, 6321 (Kraus).  Aggression is the reason a \nmajority of the children are placed at CHDC.  Tr. at 6321 (Kraus).  Aggression is specific \nenough for treatment purposes.  Tr. at 6321 (Kraus).     \n  Dr. Kraus commented: \n  86\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 87 of 383\nThe facility was remarkably comfortable.  The kids with \nsignificant developmental delays in many of the yards were \nsmiling, were surprisingly interactive with the staff.  And is was \njust a striking process to see. \n \nTr. at 6204 (Kraus).   \n  The overall care of the children was reasonable.  Their sleeping areas felt like bedrooms \nand the cottages were homey.  “There was nothing which I observed which led me to think their \noverall care was not being taken care of.”  Tr. at 6226 (Kraus).   \n \n[W]hen you go through that facility, you see the staff, there’s a \nwarmth to these incredibly disabled kids that I don’t think I’ve \never seen before.  And there was just something very touching \nabout it.  Even though there’s no way to quantify that.   \n \nTr. at 6228 (Kraus).  Dr. Kraus did not fully evaluate staffing patterns.  However, he was able to \nnote that the staffing seemed adequate for the cottages which he evaluated.  Tr. at 6225 (Kraus).   \nThe cottage staff were “amazing.”  Dr. Kraus explained: \nI’ve seen a lot of different facilities over my professional career.  \nMost of the cottage staff had been there for years, and they were \nnot just there, in my opinion, because it was a job.  They truly \nloved taking care of these kids …. They had an understanding of \nthe kids ….  \n \nTr. at 6225 (Kraus). \nThere are two pediatricians on staff at CHDC.  Tr. at 5338 (Callahan). \nDr. Parmley believes that her prescription of medications at CHDC to treat psychiatric \ndisorders in children and adolescents is within professional standards.  “Professional standards \nare those practices that a reasonable person in a similar position with similar education would do \nin normal - - under normal circumstances.”  Tr. at 5450 (Parmley).  Dr. Parmley’s subspecialty \n  87\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 88 of 383\ntraining in developmental behavioral pediatrics is on the border between pediatrics and \npsychiatry.  Tr. at 5450 (Parmley). \n  Dr. Callahan has made referrals of CHDC child residents to a child and adolescent \npsychiatrist.  He has not done it frequently, “because of access”, but he has “had a couple of \noccasions.”  Tr. at 5337 (Callahan).  Recently, Dr. Callahan has tried to refer CB to an outside \nthe facility child and adolescent psychiatrist.  There had been a delay, the referred doctor had \nchanged practices, but CB has been seen by another doctor at the referred medical center.  Tr. at \n5337, 5338 (Callahan).  \nDr. Callahan did not tell Dr. Holloway that he is not a member of the treatment team.  Tr. \nat 5339 (Callahan).  Dr. Callahan is not a member of the team of those who are not receiving \npsychiatric care.  Tr. at 5361 (Callahan).  Most of Dr. Callahan’s input to the IDT is in writing.  \n“That’s not uncommon for consultants.”  Tr. at 5339 (Callahan).  Dr. Callahan also provides \nverbal input to IDT members.  Tr. at 5340 (Callahan).   Dr. Callahan is available to the IDT for \ndirect communication .  Tr. at 5339 (Callahan).  Dr. Callahan attends meetings such as a staffing \nupon request.  Tr. at 5340 (Callahan).  When Dr. Callahan formally visits a patient, various \nmembers of the treatment team may be present.  Such members typically include the \npsychological examiner, a member of the direct care staff, family members, a nurse, and social \nworker.  Tr. at 5339 (Callahan). \nDr. Callahan expects that his recommendations to the IDT are reviewed by them.  Tr. at \n5340 (Callahan).   \nI do make those recommendations on a routine basis both in \nwriting as part of a scheduled routine visit, and in writing \nsometimes in response to a written question that comes up, and \nalso sometimes verbally.  If it’s something very significant, usually \nI’ll document it in writing, but, for instance, if I’m called about \nsomething, I’m probably not going to document that in writing.  \n  88\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 89 of 383\nBut the person that I call may write a note saying, ‘Discuss with \nCallahan about’ so and so. \n \nTr. at 5340 (Callahan).  \n \n  Dr. Callahan discusses the possibility of decreasing the need for psychotropic drugs for \ncertain individuals with the IDT.  “That’s an ongoing issue with most of our folks.”  Tr. at 5341 \n(Callahan).  Sometimes family is firm about not wanting to change or reduce psychotropic \nmedications.  Typically, however, newly admitted individuals enter CHDC on multiple \nmedications and CHDS is successful in reducing those.  Tr. at 5341 (Callahan).   \n  Dr. Callahan discusses differential diagnosis with the IDT, and more so with the psych \nexaminer.  Tr. at 5341 (Callahan).  Dr. Callahan does not document conversations on differential \ndiagnosis on every little detail, “no more than any other psychiatrist does in real world standard \nof medical care.”  Like “pretty much every physician does”, Dr. Callahan goes through \ndiagnoses in his head but does not write them all down.  Tr. at 5341 (Callahan).  \n  Dr. Callahan discusses medication side effects and interactions with the IDT.  “That’s a \nroutine question at each visit.”  Tr. at 5342 (Callahan).  Taper criterion is based on symptoms \nand the tracking of those symptoms.   \nAnd then that’s - - information is recorded and usually summarized \non a monthly basis.  When they prepare a specific taper criteria, it \nmight be that someone had no more than a certain amount of \naggression in a given six-month period or a given year. \n \nTr. at 5343 (Callahan).  Dr. Callahan discusses the meeting of formal taper criteria in progress \nnotes.  He will then recommend whether or not to reduce the medication.  Tr. at 5343 (Callahan).   \n“The taper criteria is not the only time when a medication might be reduced, but it acts as sort of \na trigger to remind folk to review that issue.”  Tr. at 5353 (Callahan).  In response to Dr. \nHolloway’s claim that taper criteria should be based on target symptoms relevant to the DSM-IV \n  89\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 90 of 383\ncriteria, Dr. Callahan explained:  “that’s not a widely accepted standard.”  Tr. at 5343, 5344 \n(Callahan).  [T]hat’s not the standard of care.”  Tr. at 5344 (Callahan).   \n  Dr. Holloway admits that the psychology examiners do not make the final decision on \nwhat taper criteria are set for the residents, they only make recommendations and it is again the \npediatrician or primary care physician who decides on what the taper criteria is set.  Tr. at 2644 \n(Holloway).  Dr. Callahan provides input to the IDT through his written consultations and verbal \ninteraction with them.  Tr. at 2644 (Holloway). Dr. Holloway agrees that the primary care \nphysician is on the IDT team and the psychiatrists consults with them and they make a \ndetermination, with the help of the ID team, whether or not a taper criteria is appropriate.  Tr. at \n2664 (Holloway).   \n5.  DR. CALLAHAN IS FULLY QUALIFIED TO CARE FOR \nCHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS \n \nThe Plaintiff alleges that Dr. Callahan must be certified in child and adolescent \npsychiatry in order to provide psychiatric consultation for children and adolescents residing at \nCHDC.  The Plaintiff, however, was unable to cite to any appropriate standard to support this \nclaim, and multiple experts and witnesses for the Defendants effectively disputed this claim. \nDr. Callahan works with the two pediatricians on staff at CHDC.  Drs. Parmley and \nShultz are at CHDC most of the time.   \nWe communicate verbally, in writing sometimes if there's specific \nissues, and by telephone when I'm not there. I see them and talk to \nthem pretty much every day I'm there as is true with the other \nprimary care physicians. \n \nTr. at 5338 (Callahan).  Dr. Callahan consults with the pediatricians on some of his psychiatric \ntreatment and care.  They discuss recommendations and provide Dr. Callahan with observations \n  90\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 91 of 383\nor information provided by the psychological examiner and nursing staff.  Tr. at 5338, 5339 \n(Callahan). \n  Dr. Fassler reviewed various documents and made a site visit to CHDC in February 2010.  \nTr. at 4612 (Fassler).  Dr. Fassler’s scope of review and focus was “fairly narrow.”  Specifically: \nIt was to address a specific question, which was whether or not it \nwas appropriate for a facility such as CHDC to receive psychiatric \nconsultation from a general psychiatrist as opposed to a child and \nadolescent psychiatrist. \n \nTr. at 4612 (Fassler).  To reach his conclusions in this matter, Dr. Fassler reviewed:  CVs of \nfacility physicians; some expert reports; background articles in the literature relative to the \naccess to child and adolescent psychiatry; and the CARF survey.  He interviewed a number of \nfacility physicians.  Tr. at 4612 (Fassler).  Dr. Fassler interviewed Drs. Callahan, Shultz, \nParmley, Lea, and Thomas.  Tr. at 4614 (Fassler). \nDr. Fassler relied upon national standards.  Such standards include literature regarding \nthe access to child and adolescent psychiatry including articles from the Council on Graduate \nMedical Education; the American Medical Association; a Thomas and Holzer Publication in the \nAcademy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Journal; data from the Academy of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry; a study by Koppelman; the National Ambulatory Care Medical survey; \nan article by Stubbe; and data from the Annie E. Casey Foundation.  Tr. at 4612, 4616-4619, \n4621, 4624, 4627 (Fassler; DF-1, DF-2. \nDr. Fassler found that given the shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists, given that \nmost child and adolescent psychiatrists do not have the experience of working with children and \nadolescents with developmental disabilities, and given that CHDC has arranged ongoing \nconsultation services with a general psychiatrist, Dr. Callahan, who does have extensive \n  91\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 92 of 383\nexperience working with this population, and has physicians and pediatricians ultimately \nresponsible for the delivery of care, utilizing a general psychiatrist instead of a child and \nadolescent psychiatrist is not a departure from the generally accepted standard of care.  Tr. at \n4624, 4625 (Fassler). \nIn place of a child and adolescent psychiatrist, CHDC has arranged for ongoing \nconsultation services with Dr. Callahan, a board-certified general psychiatrist.  Dr. Callahan has \nextensive experience working with adults, adolescents, and children with developmental \ndisabilities.  Dr. Callahan’s consultation is further augmented by two pediatricians, including a \nbehavioral developmental pediatrician, and family practice physicians.  It is these physicians \nwho are ultimately directly responsible for the care of the pediatric residents.  Tr. at 4625 \n(Fassler). \nCHDC physicians may seek outside consultation, “outside of the usual consultants for \nparticular medical consultation.  Such requests have always been approved.  There is at least one \nchild who is seen by a child and adolescent psychiatrist in Little Rock.  Tr. at 4637 (Fassler). \nDr. Fassler explained that the standard is that “physicians should  try and do the best they \ncan to take care of their patients with the resources available.”  Tr. at 4632 (Fassler).  Dr. Fassler \ndescribed the great value to the experience possessed by Dr. Callahan as follows: \nI believe I would disagree with your characterization of adequate \nservices. What I'm saying is, I think a general psychiatrist with this \namount of experience is adequate services, and I think if you \nrecruit someone through a J-1 visa program, they may be a child \npsychiatrist, but it's unlikely that they have this kind of extensive \nbackground in treating children and adolescents with \ndevelopmental disabilities. So most child psychiatrists don't have \nthis kind of background. Of the 48 child and adolescent \npsychiatrists in Vermont, there's maybe one who really has this \nkind of expertise. So it's not just any child and adolescent \npsychiatrist, it's a child and adolescent psychiatrist with experience \nand expertise in this area. \n  92\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 93 of 383\n \nTr. at 4633 (Fassler).  He further stated: ”just having a child psychiatrist, if it's not a \nchild psychiatrist with expertise in this area, could actually make things worse.  Tr. at 4635 \n(Fassler).  There are relevant clinical considerations in the type of child and adolescent \npsychiatrist who would be appropriate to practice at CHDC. \nThe reality is that most child and adolescent psychiatrists do not \nhave particular expertise in the evaluation and treatment of \ndevelopmental disabilities, and there's an article by Stubbe, \nDorothy Stubbe, who is a training director who addressed this \nissue and surveyed the child and adolescent psychiatrists \ngraduating from their training program, and they felt clinically \nleast prepared in the areas of complex psychopharmacology, \ncognitive behavioral therapy, and the treatment of children with \ncomplicated developmental disabilities. \n \nTr. at 4624 (Fassler). \n  At the time of Dr. Fassler’s review in February 2010, there were approximately 51 \nresidents under the age of 18 residing at CHDC.  Tr. at 4616 (Fassler) \n  Throughout the country, general practitioners and pediatricians provide mental health \nservices to children.  Tr. at 4620, 4621 (Fassler).  Per the National Ambulatory Care Medical \nSurvey, 84.8 percent of psychotropic medication prescriptions were provided  by general \npractitioners or pediatricians to pediatric patients in office-based practices in the United States.  \nTr. at 462, 4622 (Fassler). \n  There is a nationwide shortage of children’s mental health professionals.  Tr. at 4616 \n(Fassler).   \n[C]hild and adolescent psychiatry in particular is probably the most \nunderserved medical subspecialty.  There’s a board shortage of all \nchild mental health professionals, but in terms of child and \nadolescent psychiatry, the Council on Graduate Medical Education \nhas on several occasions noted that we need about four times as \nmany child and adolescent psychiatrists as we have. \n \n  93\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 94 of 383\nTr. at 4616 (Fassler).  There are only currently about 7,300 practicing child and adolescent \npsychiatrists in the country.  Of those 7,300, only approximately 6,800 actually provide clinical \ncare.  Tr. at 4617 (Fassler). \n  The shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists in Arkansas “seems to be particularly \nacute”, as it is 40 percent below the national average.  There are “approximately 2.38 child and \nadolescent psychiatrists per hundred thousand people in the country as a whole, but in Arkansas, \nthe ratio is 1.42 per hundred thousand.  Tr. at 4617 (Fassler). \nCiting a Thomas and Holzer publication in the Academy of child and Adolescent \nPsychiatry Journal, Dr. Fassler explained: \n[T]he United States as a whole has 8,67 child and adolescent \npsychiatrists per hundred thousand youth, and in Arkansas during a \ncomparable time period, the figure was  4.7 per hundred thousand.  \nSo representing approximately 54 percent of the national average, \nwhich is the eighth lowest number of child and adolescent \npsychiatrists per youth in the country. \n \nTr. at 4617, 4618 (Fassler).  There are 30 child and adolescent psychiatrists who are members of \nthe Academy in Arkansas.  There are no child and adolescent psychiatrists in the county of \nConway, Arkansas.  Tr. at 4618, 4619 (Fassler). \n  In comparison, Vermont has 48 child and adolescent psychiatrists.  In Arkansas “there \nare about 30 child and adolescent psychiatrists for a population of 3 million.”  In Vermont, there \nare 48 members of the Academy for a population of 650,000, and that is not nearly enough.  Tr. \nat 4620 (Fassler). \n  Most of Arkansas, including Conway, has been designated as a mental health \nprofessional shortage area.  Tr. at 4618 (Fassler). \n  The AACAP has policy statements on the psychiatric treatment of children in hospitals.  \nTr. at 4622 (Fassler).  CHDC is not a hospital within the meaning of the AACAP policies.  Tr. at \n  94\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 95 of 383\n4622 (Fassler).  Those policies are not intended to address psychiatric care at an ICF/MR or \nother residential facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities.  Tr. at 4622 (Fassler).  \nA policy was developed in June 2010, after Dr. Fassler’s report.  It has not yet been widely \ndisseminated.  At this point, it is “not in general use or recognition or adoption.”  Tr. at 4623 \n(Fassler).  The AACAP and other professional organizations recognize that child and adolescent \npsychiatrists may not be available in certain circumstances.  Tr. at 4623 (Fassler). \nDr. Fassler noted that the last CARF survey at CHDC was in December 2009 and that \nCHDC received a three-year accreditation.  Tr. at 4613 (Fassler).  The CARF reviewer, regarding \nthe 2009 survey, specifically noted that CDHD is: \ncommended on the positive interaction between physicians, \nnursing, pharmacy services, and the teams that interact together to \nensure that medication and therapeutic intervention are properly \nprescribed, administered, and monitored. And the CARF report \nfurther went on to state that the organization has a long history of \nproviding high quality residential treatment services for adults and \nchildren with developmental disabilities and multiple chronic \nmedical impairments and that services designed and provided for \nchildren, adolescents, and adults represent the combination of not \nonly evidence- and research-based practices, but also the creativity, \nskill, and dedication of the staff members. \n \nTr. at 4613 (Fassler).   The 2009 CARF report contained no specific recommendations regarding \nmedical use.  Tr. at 4613 (Fassler).     The 2009 CARF report contained areas on integrated \nDD/mental health and behavioral health services for children and adolescents in residential \nsettings and did not raise any specific concerns regarding psychiatric consultation.  Tr. at 4613, \n4614 (Fassler).    \n  CHDC has made and continues to make efforts to hire a child and adolescent psychiatrist.  \nTr. at 4624 (Fassler).     “[I]t’s not reasonable to assume that CHDC could easily identify and \n  95\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 96 of 383\ncontract with a child and adolescent psychiatrist who had particular training and expertise in this \narea.”  Tr. at 4625 (Fassler).    \n  Dr. Fassler found that the arrangement between CHDC and a general psychiatrist for the \nprovision of psychiatric care to pediatric residents is not unreasonable.  “I don’t think it \nrepresents a significant deviation or departure from generally accepted standard of care.”  Tr. at \n4625 (Fassler).    \nDr. Kraus agreed that Dr. Callahan could appropriately and adequately provide the \npsychiatric consultation for children and adolescents, and Dr. Kraus stated: \nAlthough it's always a hope that one can get a child and adolescent \npsychiatrist to treat kids, the most recent parameter of sorts that's \nout from the Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, which \nactually just came out in June, clearly states that because of the \nwork force shortage of child psychiatrists in the areas where child \npsychiatrists simply aren't available, that one wants to be able to \nhave well-trained and experienced general psychiatrists in lieu of \nthat because there really isn't an option. For example, in the county \nwhere Conway is, there are no child psychiatrists. Even when one \nlooks around Little Rock, based on the statistics from the Academy \nof Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, at most, 18 child psychiatrists, \nalthough perhaps not all of them practicing. This would be an area \nwhere there is an obvious work force issue. \n \nTr. at 6205 (Kraus).  The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists does not \nspecifically require that only a child and adolescent psychologist treat children and adolescents.  \nIt is acceptable for a general psychiatrist to treat children and adolescents in those situations.  Tr. \nat 6205 (Kraus). \n  Dr. Kraus made some effort to contact some child psychiatrists at the Arkansas Medical \nCenter Department of Psychiatry.  However, no one was able to get back to him.  Tr. at 6227 \n(Kraus). \n  96\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 97 of 383\n  Dr. Kraus concluded that Dr. Callahan has “done an overall very comprehensive job with \nvery complicated kids, and very consistently.”  Tr. at 6220 (Kraus).  The psychiatric care that Dr. \nCallahan provides to the children and adolescents at CHDC meets accepted professional practice.  \nTr. at 6227 (Kraus). \nAdditionally, Dr. Kastner addressed Holloway’s claim that Dr. Callahan should be a child \npsychiatrist to render consultation to children at CHDC, and Dr. Kastner confirmed that there is \nno standard to support this claim. Tr. 4216 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner also describes how the \npublications relied upon by Holloway have been superceded, do not apply to a facility like \nCHDC, and do not define practices for the purposes of meeting the standard of care.  Tr. at 4217, \n4218 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner also noted that Dr. Callahan works with pediatricians who have expertise in \ntreating children with disabilities.  Tr. at 4223 (Kastner).  Also, the specialty of psychiatry, such \nas possessed by Dr. Callahan, includes the competency to care for children across their life span.  \nTr. at 4224.  Consequently, Dr. Kastner agreed that it was appropriate for Dr. Callahan to \nprovide psychiatric consultation for children and adolescents.  Tr. at 4217-4224. \nDr. Mikkelsen admitted that the standard of care can vary from geographic region to \ngeographic region.  Tr. at 3794 (Mikkelsen).  Reasonable care may vary from region to region \ndepending on resources and availability of certain expertise.  Tr. at 3795 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that pediatricians often provide psychiatric services to children due \nto the unavailability of a child psychiatrist.  Tr. at 3814 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen also agreed \nthat in the community, psychiatric services are provided sometimes to children by \nnonpsychiatrists such as physicians, pediatricians, and neurologists.  Tr. at 3814 (Mikkelsen).   \n  97\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 98 of 383\nRegarding his work at MENTOR, Dr. Mikkelsen did not even know whether physicians \nwithout board certification in child psychiatry provide psychiatric services to children served by \nMENTOR.  Tr. at 3814 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen assumed that Arkansas is considered underserved in regard to child \npsychiatric services.  Tr. at 3817 (Mikkelsen).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that the Arkansas Children’s Hospital is a referral specialty \nhospital.  Tr. at 3869 (Mikkelsen).  It would not be problematic to Dr, Mikkelsen if the Dennis \nDevelopmental Center, which is an affiliate of the Arkansas Children’s Hopsital, were directed \nby a pediatrician and not a child psychiatrist.  Tr, at 3869 (Mikkelsen).   \n  Although Dr. Holloway expressed concern about Dr. Callahan providing care to L.W. \nbecause Dr. Callahan was not a child psychiatrist, L.W. actually receives his psychiatric care \noutside of CHDC.  Tr. at 4234 (Kastner).  This is just one of many mistakes or \nmisrepresentations by Plaintiff’s experts. \n  Holloway is unaware of whether the American Psychiatric Association – Council on \nChildren, Adolescents and Families has a policy of helping psychiatrists to learn more about \ndiagnosis and treatment of children.  Tr. at 2640 (Holloway).  However, she admits that there is \nno APA policy that prohibits general psychiatrists from treating or consulting on the care of \nchildren or adolescents in residential settings.  Tr. at 2640 (Holloway). \n  Holloway doesn’t know how many child psychiatrists are in the state of Arkansas or in \nthe county where CHDC is located.  Tr. at 2641 (Holloway).  Holloway agrees that child \npsychiatry is an underserved area of medicine.  Tr. at 2641 (Holloway).  Holloway admits that \ndepending on the area, psychiatric services are provided to children by pediatricians and primary \ncare physicians due to the shortage of child psychiatrists or even general psychiatrists.  Tr. at \n  98\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 99 of 383\n2642 (Holloway).  Holloway agrees that pediatricians can provide mental health psychiatric \nservices for children.  Tr. at 2643 (Holloway).  Holloway admits that Dr. Callahan is only a \nconsulting psychiatrist and the final decision on treatment is made by the pediatrician at \nCHDC,and no matter what Dr. Callahan recommends, the final call is made by the pediatrician \nor primary care physician.  Tr. at 2644 (Holloway).  However, Dr. Holloway did not meet with \nor speak to any pediatrician at CHDC and does not know how they interact or work in concert \nwith Dr. Callahan.  Tr. at 2649 (Holloway). \n  Dr. Holloway stated that there are seven (7) child psychiatrists in the Little Rock area, but \nshe does not even know whether any of those seven (7) accept Medicaid or have any interest in \nproviding care to children with developmental disabilities.  Tr. at 2646 (Holloway).  In \nLouisiana, Dr. Holloway’s home state, like Arkansas, there is also a shortage of psychiatrists, \nand any physician with a license to practice medicine can provide psychiatric services to \nchildren.  Tr. at 2646 (Holloway). \n  Holloway strangely claims that a psychiatrist that has just completed the 2-year program \non child psychiatry with no practice experience whatsoever would be more qualified to work \nwith the children at CHDC than Dr. Callahan who has over 29 years of experience working with \nthese developmentally disabled children and adolescents.  Tr. at 2647 (Holloway). \n \n6.  THE PLAINTIFF AND PLAINTIFF’S WITNESS, DR. \nMIKKELSEN, INAPPROPRIATELY AND MISTAKENLY \nCLAIM THAT THE MORTALITY RATE AT CHDC IS HIGH \n \n  The Plaintiff’s witness, Dr. Mikkelsen, claims that the mortality rate is high at CHDC, \nand the Plaintiff disingenuously claims that residents at CHDC are more likely to die at CHDC \nthan to move out.  These allegations are irresponsible and false. \n  99\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 100 of 383\n  Dr. Mikkelsen claims that CHDC does not compare favorably to one (1) facility in \nConnecticut and four (4) facilities in Massachusetts.  However, an examination of that data in \nproper context does not support that claim. \nThe national mortality rate at public ICF’s, like CHDC, is 2 per thousand.  Tr. 3980, 3978 \n(Mikkelsen). \n  Mikkelsen never offered a benchmark as to what mortality rate should be expected at an \nICF/MR such as CHDC.  Tr. at 3980 (Mikkelsen).  He failed to mention that the mortality rates \nat the Connecticut ICF and the four (4) Massachusetts ICF’s that he used for comparison were 80 \nor 90 percent higher than at CHDC.  Tr. at 3980 (Mikkelsen). \nIn actuality, CHDC compares very favorably as to mortality rate to the Connecticut and \nMassachusetts facilities cited by Mikkelsen.  Dr. Kastner observed: \nThe data available at Conway and the data available from \nSouthbury Training School and Massachusetts allow meaningful \ncomparisons based upon the average annual mortality rate. The \naverage mortality rate at Conway was 21.6 years -- I'm sorry -- \n21.6 per thousand. The average annual mortality at the \nMassachusetts ICFs was 39.4, and that's from the data published in \n2007 and collected in 2005. It's the most recent data I could get. \nAnd in Connecticut at the Southbury Training School, over a \nperiod of, I believe, eight years, the average mortality rate was 43 \nper thousand. So just to review the three rates -- 21.6 at Conway, \n39.4 in Massachusetts, and 43.1 in Connecticut. The rate of the \nincrease in Massachusetts, the mortality rate is 82 percent higher in \nMassachusetts and 99 percent higher in Connecticut. The numbers \ninvolved in calculating these rates are sufficiently large as to allow \na statistical analysis -- a simple statistical analysis called a chi \nsquare, which demonstrates that the difference in those rates is \nstatistically significant. \n \nTr. at 4096, 4097 (Kastner) \n \n  “Age is by far the risk factor that has the greatest input into mortality. The older you are, \nthe more likely you are to die.”  Tr. at 4090, 4091 (Kastner).  The average age of residents at \n  100\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 101 of 383\nSouthbury Training School is close to 60, while the average age at CHDC is much younger.  Tr. \nat 4091.  So, the comparison of average age of mortality by Mikkelsen between Southbury \nTraining School and CHDC is inappropriate.  Furthermore, Mikkelsen has no evidence that the \ncalculated age of death has any statistical significance and his findings are completely \nmeaningless.  Tr. 4091, 4092 (Kastner).  As Dr. Kastner stated: \nObviously, people at Conway are dying at a younger age, but in \norder to determine whether that is a statistically significant \ndifference, you need to apply a statistical test, and Dr. Mikelson \nfailed to do that. What you need to do in order to apply a statistical \ntest is to provide the statistician with a distribution of the ages of \nthe population at those three centers, which Dr. Mikelson did not \nproduce. \nSo Dr. Mikelson looked at a small number of outcomes, calculated \nan average and alleged that it was statistically significant without \nhaving performed any statistical analysis. And that is improper. \nYou can't make an allegation without evidence to support it. \n \nTr. at 4093 (Kastner). \n  To demonstrate the flawed logic of Mikkelsen as to mortality rates, Dr, Kastner noted: \nNow let's just follow along with his theory. If his theory is that the \nyounger the age of death, the more inferior the quality of care, \nthere is evidence to suggest that in both community -- both in \nhome settings in Connecticut and Massachusetts. There is a high \ndegree of concern. The average age at death of individuals at home \nin Connecticut was 32. The average age at home for individuals \nserved in Massachusetts was 49.4. One would, if you follow Dr. \nMikelson's logic, have to naturally conclude that those are the two \nmost dangerous settings in the state of Massachusetts and \nConnecticut. And obviously, we shouldn't allow people to live at \nhome because it's so dangerous. \nI don't believe this for a moment, and I hope you don't \nmisunderstand my sarcasm. I probably shouldn't have presented it \nin that fashion, but the point being the age of death really has very \nlittle to do with the quality of care. It has much more to do with the \nage of the population. Rather than fight with Dr. Mikelson about \nwhether they're older or younger, here or there, I am simply going \nto say that he failed to perform a statistical test and, therefore, there \nis no way to conclude based on his data that there is any difference \nin the age of death between these three groups. \n  101\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 102 of 383\n \nTr. at 4093, 4094 (Kastner). \nAs to aspiration pneumonia and other causes of death in the Massachusetts facilities \nreferred to by Mikkelsen: \n… 27 percent of the deaths at Conway were due to aspiration. 21 \npercent of the deaths in Massachusetts were due to aspiration. \nThere is no statistically significant difference in the rates of \naspiration pneumonia between the Conway center and \nMassachusetts ICFs. In terms of cardiopulmonary deaths, 14 \npercent of the deaths at Conway versus 19 percent of the deaths in \nMassachusetts. And cancer, zero percent Conway, 10 percent \nMassachusetts. Again, none of those differences will achieve \nstatistical significance, and the reason is we're dealing with very \nsmall numbers. \n \nTr. at 4100, 4101 (Kastner). \n  At Beatrice Center in Nebraska, 47 persons who were medically fragile were moved to \nother settings.  Tr. at 3984, 3985 (Kastner).  After 12 months, 12 of those 47 had died.  Tr. at \n3985 (Kastner).  One of them died just five or six days after being transferred.  Tr. at 3985 \n(Kastner).  The DOJ did nothing.  Tr. at 3985, 3986 (Kastner).   \n  As to the plaintiff’s claim that a resident of CHDC is more likely to die at CHDC than to \nmove out, Dr. Kastner points out: \nWell, I -- there is no data, I think, that's been presented by anyone \nabout probabilities, looking at probabilities of death. I just don't \nknow where that comes from. I don't believe it's in Dr. Mikelson's \nreport. I don't believe it was represented in any direct testimony. \nThere is no basis in any of the documentation that I saw to support \nsuch a conclusion. \n \nTr. at 4105, 4106 (Kastner). \nDr. Mikkelsen had no mortality rates for persons served by MENTOR group homes.  Tr. \nat 3845 (Mikkelsen). \n \n  102\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 103 of 383\nDr. Mikkelsen testified as to a comparison of mortality rates at CHDC with those of other \nHDCs including Southbury Training School and Massachusetts.  Tr. at 3845 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. \nMikkelsen has never visited Southbury Training School.  Tr. at 3845, 3846 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen did not know if there was an infirmary on grounds at Southbury Training \nSchool.  Tr. at 3850 (Mikkelsen).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen possessed no statistical comparisons between Southbury Training School \nresidents and CHDC residents as to the nature of their disabilities or medical conditions.  Tr. at \n3844, 3845 (Mikkelsen).   \nThere are no children at the Massachusetts HDCs.  Tr. at 3847 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. \nMikkelsen was unable to give statistical age ranges from Massachusetts to make a comparison \nwith CHDC.  Tr. at 3847 (Mikkelsen).   \nThe figure Dr. Mikkelsen used for Southbury was an average age of 55 years old.  Tr. at \n3847 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen did not know the percentage of individuals at CHDC who had a do not \nresuscitate order.  Tr. at 3850 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen did not know the average age of death for individuals served by \nMENTOR.  Tr. at 3850 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen had no average, overall average age of death for persons living in public \nICF/MRs nationwide.  Tr. at 3850 (Mikkelsen).   \nAlthough she commented on mortality rates, Crawford did not know the death or \nmortality rates from the ICF/MR where she worked.  Tr. at 2947 (Crawford).  Crawford also did \nnot know the rate of death that could reasonably be expected at a facility such as CHDC.  Tr. at \n  103\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 104 of 383\n2947 (Crawford).  Crawford did not know the rate of death in nursing homes.  Tr. at 2947 \n(Crawford). \nPsychiatric Care for Individuals Over 15 Years Old At CHDC Met or Exceeded Accepted \nProfessional Standards. \n \n  Dr. Warren reviewed the psychiatric care provided at CHDC to individuals 16 years old \nand older.  Tr. at 4648, 4649.   \n  Dr. Warren toured CHDC, once in November 2009 and once in February 2010.  Tr. at \n4649.  During his tour of CHDC, Dr. Warren interviewed various staff, reviewed patient records \nand documents, observed meetings, and met with some patients.  Tr. at 4649.  (Warren).   \n  Dr. Warren selected the individuals he wished to interview.  He interviewed Calvin Price, \nthe superintendent; Buck Reddig, the clinical chief of psychology; Angela Green, the social \nservices clinical chief, Gail Miller, the director of quality assurance; Dr. Denise Thomas, the \nmedical director; Dal Burgess, the pharmacist; Linda Henderson, the quality improvement nurse, \nSandra Gardner, the director of nursing; Melissa Allen, the medical technology supervisor; Dr. \nCallahan, the psychiatrist; Dr. Stewart, the on-call physician; Becky Brewer and Doug Hart, two \nof the five team leaders; and Anita Cooper and Michelle Messer, two psychological examiners.  \nTr. at 4652 (Warren).   \n  Dr. Warren reviewed Dr. Callahan’s medical charts and notes.  Tr. at 4649 (Warren) \n  Dr. Warren reviewed CMS regulations. Tr. at 4649 (Warren).   \n  Dr. Warren reviewed enough residents to have a significant representative survey of the \ncare.  Tr. at 4650 (Warren).  Dr. Warren explained: \nWell, it was a randomly selected statistically significant sample.  I \nlooked at the charts of 27 patients which were randomly selected in \na particular statistical way.  And that represents 10 percent of the \npopulation at Conway who are 16 or over on psychotropic \nmedicines, psychiatric medicines.   \n  104\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 105 of 383\n \nTr. at 4650 (Warren).  Dr. Warren generated a random list of the 274 patients who were 16 or \nover and who were receiving psychiatric medicines, and selected every fifth name on the list.  Tr. \nat 4651 (Warren).  A statistically valid sample enables the generalization to the total population.  \nTr. at 4655 (Warren).  \nDr. Warren reviewed 27 charts and interviewed approximately 17 of those individuals \nwhose charts he reviewed.  Tr. at 4655 (Warren).     \nDr. Warren reviewed approximately 12 medical records of those reviewed or commented \non by Plaintiff’s experts.  Tr. at 4651 (Warren).   \nDr. Warren stated that Drs. Holloway and Mikkelsen did not attempt to obtain a \nstatistically random sample.  Tr. at 4699 (Warren).  Dr. Mikkelsen only provided a detailed \nreview on seven residents with respect to psychiatric care.  Dr. Holloway only provided a \ndetailed review of 15, and only 9 with respect to psychotropic medicines and only 6 with respect \nto restraints.  Their findings are not statistically generated and thus cannot be generalized to the \nentire CHDC population.  Tr. at 4699 (Warren).  \nDr. Warren is not a psychologist and, thus, did not review or make any findings as to \npsychology.  Tr. at 4749 (Warren).  “I was just looking at what the psychiatrist did.”  Tr. at 4749 \n(Warren). \nDr. Warren assessed whether the psychiatric care provided to CHDC residents 16 years \nold and older demonstrated a reasonable exercise of professional judgment.  Tr. at 4649 \n(Warren). Dr. Warren concluded that the psychiatric care provided to CHDC residents 16 years \nold and older demonstrated a reasonable exercise of professional judgment.  Tr. at 4649 \n(Warren).  \n  105\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 106 of 383\nFrom his review of the medical records and treatment plans, Dr. Warren found \ncommunications and interactions between the psychiatrist and the psychological examiners.  Tr. \nat 4698 (Warren).   \nDr. Thomas and the other physicians provide clinical oversight to Dr. Callahan.  Tr. at \n4702 (Warren).  The records show that there are communications between the various \ndisciplines. \nThe chart review shows there’s extensive communication between \nthem, and the results of the statistical analysis that I did shows that \nthere is frequently communication between Dr. Callahan, team \nmembers, consultants.  As frequent as regular, it’s documented in \nthe systematic ways as evidenced of two-way written and verbal \ncommunications. \n \nTr. at 4702 (Warren).   \nDr. Kastner similarily found no evidence to support Mikkelsen’s claim that there was \npoor communication between physicians, consultants and other members of the clinical team.  \nTr. at 4127 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner observed that Dr. Callahan adequately communicates with the \ninterdisciplinary team (IDT) by written communication.  Tr. at 4225 (Kastner).  “It’s a \ncompletely appropriate and reasonable practice.”  Tr. at 4226 (Kastner).   \nDr. Callahan is available to the primary care physicians by phone or in person.  When Dr. \nCallahan is on grounds, he sees them and discusses particular individuals.  “Of course, they are \nthe one[s] that ultimately writes the orders for the psychiatric referral also, and the copies of my \nevaluations and consultations go to them.”  Tr. at 5350 (Callahan).  If Dr. Callahan sees that \nsomething needs immediate attention, he will print out a note and hand carry it to the physician \nexplaining his thoughts.  Tr. at 5350 (Callahan).  The primary care physician actually writes the \n  106\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 107 of 383\nprescriptions.  Thus, the physician can choose not to accept Dr. Callahan’s medication \nrecommendation.  Tr. at 5350 (Callahan).   \nDr. Parmley believes that communications between physicians and Dr. Callahan meets \naccepted professional standards.  Tr. at 5451 (Parmley). \nDr. Thomas noted that physicians “meet every day and talk.  Informally, we talk about \nour patients every day.”  Tr. at 1747.  Informal meetings could involve the entire physician staff.  \nTr. at 1749 (Thomas).  Dr. Thomas supervises the other physicians.  However, each physician is \nresponsible for their own case load.  Tr. at 1752 (Thomas).  Specific individuals may be \ndiscussed at the monthly physician meetings.  Tr. at 1753 (Thomas). \nDr. Mikkelsen’s opinion that the communication between Dr. Callahan and the other \nprofessionals was inadequate was based merely on outcomes.  It was not based on interviews of \nDr. Callahan or other medical staff.  Tr. at 3851 (Mikkelsen).     \nDr. Callahan considers himself a member of the IDT.  “I consult with them more than I \nam physically present in the numerous meetings they have.”  Tr. at 5339 (Callahan). Dr. \nCallahan discusses policies and procedures with CHDC medical staff.  Tr. at 5342 (Callahan).  \nDr. Callahan has had input into a number of policies.  Tr. at 5324.  (Callahan).   \nFrom his review of the medical records and treatment plans, Dr. Warren saw documented \nreasonable DSM-IV diagnoses. Tr. at 4698 (Warren). \nFrom his review of the medical records and treatment plans, Dr. Warren found \nappropriate target symptoms associated with the diagnosis.  Tr. at 4698.  (Warren).   \nDr. Warren observed rationale for medication changes.  Tr. at 4698 (Warren).   \nDr, Warren agreed that Dr. Callahan personally evaluated each patient on psychotropic \nmedications at a minimum of every three months.  Tr. at 4698 (Warren).  In each evaluation, Dr. \n  107\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 108 of 383\nCallahan expressed the taper criteria and evaluated whether target symptoms were appropriately \ntreated by medications.  Tr. at 4698, 4699 (Warren).   \nThere are no standards about how long a psychiatrist should spend with a patient.  Tr. at \n4703 (Warren).  In his own practice, at the hospital, Dr. Warren performs rounds because it is \nquicker, more efficient.  Rounds do not ensure adequacy of care, as suggested by Plaintiff’s \ncounsel.  Tr. at 4733 (Warren).  CHDC is different than a hospital setting.  Dr. Warren explained: \nYou see the patients in a hospital every day.  And an ICF/MR, I don’t think it \nwould be too disruptive to have the patients being taken out of activity once a \nmonth or once every three months to see the doctor. \n \nTr. at 4734 (Warren).     \n  Dr. Warren found that overall, psychiatric care provided at CHDC meets acceptable \nstandards of care.  Tr. at 4699 (Warren).   \n  Dr. Kastner found “clear evidence of an independent professional judgment made by Dr. \nCallahan in regard to whether or not a psychiatric disorder is present and what that psychiatric \ndisorder is.” Tr. at 4228 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner found that Dr. Callahan’s pattern of care to be \nconsistent with what other experts would recommend.  Tr. at 4151 (Kastner).   \nDr. Warren disagreed with most of Drs. Mikkelsen’s and Holloway’s findings regarding \nthe psychiatric care to individuals over the age of 16.  Dr. Warren only partially agreed with Dr. \nHolloway on one case, the case of A.J.  He could not find documentation whether it was founded \nor not.  Tr. at 4699, 4700 (Warren).  A.J. sees Dr. Farrell, an outside psychiatrist.  Tr. at 4700 \n(Warren).  Dr. Warren disagreed with all of Dr. Mikkelsen’s findings with respect to psychiatric \ncare to individuals over the age of 16.  Tr. at 4700 (Warren). \n   \n  108\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 109 of 383\nM.W. \nM.W. was first referred to Dr. Callahan in 2004 due to an increase in aggression and self-\ninjurious behavior.  He was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, \nand severe mental retardation.  Tr. at 4656, 4657 (Warren).  His self-injurious behavior and \naggressive behavior have decreased.  Dr. Callahan treated him appropriately with SSRI and \nSeroquel.  The psychiatric care for M.W. demonstrates a reasonable exercise of professional \njudgment.  Dr. Warren concluded that MW’s evaluation was thorough, a working diagnosis was \nmade, medical decisions and doses were appropriate and side effects were monitored.  Tr. at \n4657, 4658 (Warren).   \nSeroquel was being used to treat his diagnosis of dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety \ndisorder.  Tr. at 4780 (Warren).  When asked by Plaintiff’s counsel whether being bossy was a \nbehavior to be monitored to make the determination whether to increase the Seroquel, Dr. \nWarren replied: \nIt wasn’t increased.  He was assessed as having no side effects.  \nHis recent mild escalation was probably situational.  The \nrecommendation was to continue the current treatment and in view \nof the recent delay, not to take the Citalopram. \n \nTr. at 4785 (Warren).  Dr. Warren further explained that anxiety, aggression, and impulse control \noften overlap and cannot be separated out for etiology.  Tr. at 4786 (Warren).   \nJ.D. \nJ.D. was first evaluated by Dr. Callahan in 2002.  He had a previous diagnosis of \npervasive developmental disorder.  He was receiving an anti-seizure medication, Tegretol.  Dr. \nWarren concluded that J.D.’s medication was appropriate.  Dr. Callahan considered all of JD’s \netiologies and conservatively continued and monitored his medication.  Under Dr. Callahan’s \n  109\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 110 of 383\ncare, J.D. has shown reduction in the rates of all his symptoms and his behavior has improved.  \nJ.D.’s psychiatric care demonstrates a reasonable exercise of professional judgment.  Tr. at 4658-\n4660 (Warren).   \nWhen asked by Plaintiff’s counsel about whether there was any discussion as to J.D.’s \nbehaviors getting worse or better as his Tegretol was increased, Dr. Warren said: \nNo. On the return visit, it was felt he was doing better. \n  \nTr. at 4789, 4790 (Warren).  Dr. Warren further explained: \n \nA lot of it is you don’t have precise information, so you do your \nworking hypothesis of what’s going on, you do a therapeutic trial \nof medicine, you look at outcomes, and the outcome in this case \nwas positive.  His rates went down and treatment is very \nconservative.  He was on Tegretol to start with, they just increased \nthe dose and he did better. A reduction in rates from about one to \ntwo per month in the early 2000s to zero over several months in \n2008. \n \nTr. at 4790, 4791 (Warren).  It would be standard practice in the treatment process to wait for \nperiodic lab results.  Tr. at 4792, 4793 (Warren).       \n   \nC.C.   \nC.C. was first evaluated by Dr. Callahan in 1998.  She had been on Haldol and Cogentin as \nprescribed by another psychiatrist.  She had a long history of severe aggression and self-injurious \nbehavior.  She was diagnosed with organic personality disorder and profound mental retardation.  \nDr. Warren concluded that her medications were appropriate.  Under Dr. Callahan’s care, her \nbehaviors remained stable and even improved.  Complicating factors were considered and \nattempts were made to take her off the medications. C.C.’s care demonstrates a reasonable \nexercise of professional judgment.  Tr. at 4660, 4661 (Warren).     \nL.F., C.P., D.B., J.G., T.B., S.L., A.F., A.W., A.D.W., C.G., H.B., J.L., R.C., H.A., W.L., \nS.S., D.D., N.C., D.K.,W.B., B.H., J.B., H.T. \n  110\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 111 of 383\nThe psychiatric care of  L.F., C.P, D.B., J.G., T.B., S.L., A.W., A.D.W., C.G., H.B., J.L., \nR.C., H.A., W.L., S.S., D.D., N.C., D.K., W.B., B.H., J.B., and H.T.  represents “reasonable \nadequate standards of care, appropriate standards of care.”  Tr. at 4662 (Warren).  Most of these \nindividuals were non-verbal and severely or profoundly retarded.  Only two or three were verbal.  \nTr. at 4662, 4663 (Warren).   (Dr. Warren was unable to make a conclusion as to A.F.’s care as \nhe believed there were insufficient records to make a determination.  “And that doesn’t represent \na typical example of the patients at Conway because she was actually cared for by an outside \npsychiatrist.”  Tr. at 4663 (Warren).) \nThe majority of these individuals have aggression or self-injurious behavior.  Tr. at 4663 \n(Warren).   \nAll of these individuals received a diagnosis or working diagnosis.  Tr. at 4663 (Warren).   \nAll the medications prescribed for these individuals were tailored to the individual’s \nsymptoms “as careful discussion in the notes of medicine selection … Side effects were routinely \nconsidered.”  Tr. at 4663 (Warren).  For a number of these individuals, decreases in medications \nwere tried.  For some, it was determined that it would not be prudent to try such a decrease.  Tr. \nat 4663, 4664 (Warren).   \nFor all these individuals, environmental or other possible causes of behavior were \nconsidered.  Tr. at 4664 (Warren).   \nFor the majority of these individuals, “the outcomes were positive or stable, either \nimproved or remained stable.”  Tr. at 4664 (Warren).   \nThe psychiatric care provided to S.S. by Dr. Callahan demonstrates a reasonable \nexerciseof professional judgment.  Tr. at 4684, 4685 (Warren). \n    A.M.B. \n  111\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 112 of 383\nDr. Warren did not agree with Dr. Holloway’s allegations with respect to A.M.B.  The \nrecord did not support Dr. Holloway’s allegation that there is a lack of implementation, adequate \nsystem of detecting, reporting, responding to, and documenting drug-induced side effects.  Dr. \nWarren disagreed that Dr. Callahan neglected to reveal a diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia or \nacataphasia resulting from treatment with antipsychotics.  Tr. at 4685, (Warren).   \nDr. Callahan diagnosed the presence of abnormal facial and body movements and he also \ndiscussed the risks and benefits of continuing the antipsychotic medication despite the presence \nof early tardive dyskinesia.  Tr. at 4685 (Warren).  He monitored side effects and blood tests.  He \nused ongoing behavioral strategies and made a reasonable review of pertinent history.  Tr. at \n4686 (Warren).  While all neuroleptics can cause tardive dyskinesia , Seroquel, which AMB was \nreceiving, has the least likelihood of causing it.  Tr. at 4686 (Warren).   \nDr. Callahan’s psychiatric treatment of AMB met generally accepted professional \nstandards.  Tr. at 4686 (Warren).   \n    S.A. \nDr. Warren found no evidence to support Dr. Holloway’s claim that there was no notation \nto reference reasons for the use of 4 milligrams per day dose of Guanfacine, a dose greater than \nthe maximum for S.A.  Tr. at 4687 (Warren). \nS.A. was receiving Guanfacine upon admission to CHDC. Dr. Callahn noted he would \nconsider tapering it.  Guanfacine is a commonly used drug for ADHD in children.  A long-acting \nformulation of Guanfacine called Intuniv was recently approved and the maximum dose is 4 \nmilligrams a day.  Tr. at 4687 (Warren).   \nS.A.’s vital signs were monitored and were within the normal range.  Tr. at 4688 \n(Warren).   \n  112\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 113 of 383\nDr. Warren also disagreed with Dr. Holloway’s allegation that there was no differential \ndiagnosis and target symptoms associated with DSM-IV.  S.A. has an appropriate diagnosis of \nADHD, autistic disorder, oppositional defiant disorder.  The DSM-IV diagnoses and target \nsymptoms are discussed throughout the patient’s records.  Tr. at 4688 (Warren).   \nDr. Callahan met the accepted professional standards of care in his provision of care to \nS.A.  Tr. at 4688 (Warren).   \nJ.S. \nDr. Warren found no evidence to support Dr. Holloway’s allegation that it was essential \nthat the psychiatrist and interdisciplinary team determine if the present treatment regime is \neffective to minimize utilization of restraint.  Tr. at 4688 (Warren).   \nTo the contrary of Dr. Holloway’s allegation, Dr. Callahan was evaluating J.S.’s response \nto prescribed psychotropic medicines, followed diagnosis related symptoms, and made changes \nto medications based on positive responses or side effects.  Tr. at 4689 (Warren).  Per his long-\nterm knowledge of J.S., he planned to discontinue or decrease the antipsychotics and place the \npatient back on Mellaril which had been successful in the past.  Tr. at 4689 (Warren).  Dr. \nCallahan’s recommendation to change J.S.’s prescriptions from Zyprexa to Mellaril “represents a \nreasonable exercise of clinical judgment.”  Tr. at 4689 (Warren).   \nDr. Callahan met accepted professional standards in his treatment of JS.  Tr. at 4690 \n(Warren). \n    T.N. \nT.N. is a “very difficult patient.”  He was hyperactive and difficult to control at home.  \nBefore he came to CHDC he was at a different center where they had to separate him from the \nother clients.  Tr. at 4690 (Warren).  Dr. Callahan’s note says that TN was so hyperactive and \n  113\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 114 of 383\nself-abusive that he had to be restrained from hurting himself and destroying property.  Tr. at \n4691 (Warren).  Dr. Callahan followed him closely.  He diagnosed him with attention deficit \ndisorder, hyperactivity, autistic disorder, stereotypic disorder with self-injury, and profound \nmental retardation.  Tr. at 4691 (Warren). \nThe records demonstrate that Dr. Callahan was cognizant of the risk of tardive dyskinesia \nor neural malignant syndrome (NMS).  Tr. at 4691 (Warren).  Dr. Callahan recommended \ncautious attempt to reduce his Altose, due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia or NMS.  Tr. at 4691, \n4692 (Warren).  \nDr. Warren did not agree with Dr. Holloway’s allegation that there was multiple clinical \nlapses of communication between Dr. Callahan, Dr. Stewart, the consulting neurologist and the \nconsulting hematologist.  The records demonstrate multiple communications between these \nprofessionals concerning T.N.’s care and the risk and benefits of Depakote.  Tr. at 4692 \n(Warren).   \nDr. Warren also disagreed with Dr. Holloway’s allegation that Dr. Callahan was \nprescribing medication to T.N. to treat aberrant behavior rather than DSM-IV diagnosis \nsymptoms.  The medications were prescribed specifically for DSM diagnosis of bipolar disorder, \nOCD.  Tr. at 4692 (Warren).   \nPer the American Journal of Mental Retardation, Dr. Warren explained:  \n[T]hey state even when only a tentative or nonspecific diagnosis \ncan be made, a clinician may need to focus on one or more \nbehavioral symptoms as the targets for treatments.  And these \nsymptoms on their own may be targets for treatments.  And they \nlist such as self-injurious behaviors, physical aggression, \nimpulsivity, hyperactivity, a lot of things. \n \nTr. at 4693 (Warren). \n  114\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 115 of 383\nDr. Warren does not agree with Dr. Holloway that an individual’s behavioral symptoms \nshould not be the target for treatment.  Tr. at 4693 (Warren).   \nT.N.’s low platelets as well as monitoring and discussion on those counts were noted in \nthe chart.  They were thought primarily to be the cause of a viral illness.  Depakote was \ncontinued.  When the viral illness passed, his platelet count returned to baseline.  Tr. at 4695 \n(Warren).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen expresses some concerns about T.N.’s low platelet count which he thought \nwas related to the use of Depakote.  However, Dr. Kastner demonstrated that the low platelet \ncount was due to an infection and had “very little to do with whether he’s taking Depakote.”  Tr. \nat 4177, 4178.  (Kastner).   \nAnd I think the whole thing is a straw man thrown out there to \nmake the facility look bad when it has absolutely nothing to do \nwith monitoring side effects, but clearly indicates that CHDC is \nmanaging this patient in a very appropriate manner.  And when he \nbecomes acutely ill, they recognize it, they refer him to the \nhospital, he receives timely treatment.  And I would hold forth that \nT.N.’s care is really an illustration of the excellence in care that’s \nprovided at CHDC.   \n \nTr. at 4179 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Callahan’t treatment of TN met generally accepted professional standards.  Tr. at \n4695 (Warren).   \nMore than five doctors were treating T.N. during the period of time covered by the \nrecords Dr. Mikkelsen reviewed.  Tr. at 3859 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen did not recall the \nprimary care physician during that time.  Dr. Mikkelsen knew T.N. was being treated by a \nneurologist, but he did not refer to him in his notes in his summary.  He did not review all the \nprimary care physician’s interdisciplinary notes.  Tr. at 3859, 3860 (Mikkelsen). \n  115\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 116 of 383\n   Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that T.N. fit the profile for chronic noncyclic hypomanic behavior.  \nAccording to Dr. Mikkelsen, the appropriate treatment for such is mood stabilizers and possibly \nSSRIs.  He suggested that they begin with lithium or valproic acid.  Tr. at 3860 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen was aware that T.N. has a seizure disorder and agreed that Depakote is a brand \nname valproic acid that can be used for seizures.  Tr. at 3861 (Mikkelsen).   \n Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that it was significant that T.N.’s Risperdal dosage, while on the \nDepakote, was reduced from 9 to 2.5 milligrams a day.  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that the risks of \ntreatment with Risperal are greater than with Depakote.  Tr. at 3861 (Mikkelsen).     \n Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that guardian consent is needed to treat a patient.  Tr. at 3862 \n(Mikkelsen). \n Dr. Mikkelsen did not have a problem with the use of clonidine for T.N.  Tr. at 3863 \n(Mikkelsen).   \nIt was not Dr. Mikkelen’s contention that the reduction in the platelet count to 16,000 \nwas solely due to the use of Depakote.  Tr. at 3863 (Mikkelsen).  When asked whether the \ndecision to maintain a patient on Depakote with a platelet count of 56,000 did not violate the \nstandard of care, Dr. Mikkelsen replied: \n \nI think I said there would be a difference of opinion among \nreasonable people about that.  I guess the answer to your question \nthen would be yes. \n \nTr. at 3864 (Mikkelsen).   \n \nDr. Mikkelsen was aware that T.N. was being followed by a hematologist for his low \nplatelet count.  Tr. at 3864 (Mikkelsen).  The infectious disease specialist speculated about the \nlow platelet count being due to a viral infection leading to bone marrow suppression.  Tr. at 3865 \n(Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen did not think that simply marginally reducing the Depakote would \n  116\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 117 of 383\nhave a dramatic effect on bringing the platelet count up.  Tr. at 3865 (Mikkelsen).  T.N.’s \nseizures were well controlled.  Tr. at 3865 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen attributes that to the \nDepakote.  Tr. at 3865, 3866 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that Dr. Callahan noted that the \nincrease in Depakote seems to have been helpful regarding T.N.’s bipolar disorder.  Tr. at 3866 \n(Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen stated that he did not know if it was a statistically true statement but \nacknowledged that Dr. Callahan would subjectively conclude that there was some benefit to the \nDepakote.  Tr. at 3866 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen acknowledged that T.N.’s platelet count recovered to its baseline levels \neven with the ongoing treatment of Depakote.  Tr. at 3866 (Mikkelsen).   \nC.J. \nDr. Callahan’s diagnosis was that C.J. was showing early signs of dementia of the \nAlzheimer’s type. Dr. Warren found that the evidence supported the diagnosis, as of lack of \ndeterioration in cognitive skills.  Tr. at 4696 (Warren).  \nDr. Warren did not agree with Dr. Mikkelsen’s findings regarding use of anticonvulsant \nand antipsychotic medication for C.J.  Dr. Warren explained that Keppra was prescribed on the \nrecommendation of the consulting neurologist.  Dr. Callahan recommended a reduction or \ntermination of Keppra at the time of the mental status change.  The primary care physician chose \nto reduce rather than discontinue the Keppra.  Tr. at 4696, 4697 (Warren). \nPer Dr. Warren, the record did not support Dr. Mikkelsen’s allegation that Dr. Callahan \nfailed to identify oculogyric crisis, nor did it support Dr. Mikkelsen’s thought that C.J. had \nneuroleptic malignant syndrome.  Tr. at 4697 (Warren).  C.J. did not have oculogyric crisis.  Tr. \nat 4697 (Warren). \n  117\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 118 of 383\nThe hospital physicians considered neuroleptic malignant syndrome.  “In any event, \nwhether she had it or she didn’t have it, the standard treatment for NMS is the discontinuation of \nthe antipsychotic medication, which is what Dr. Callahan had recommended.”  Tr. at 4697 \n(Warren).   \nDr. Warren saw no evidence that Dr. Callahan’s recommendations led to C.J.’s premature \ndeath.  Tr. at 4698 (Warren). \nDr. Warren found that Dr. Callahan’s care and treatment of C.J. met accepted \nprofessional standards.  Tr. at 4698 (Warren). \n  Dr. Mikkelsen questioned the use of Keppra with C. J. and alleged that Haldal caused \nneuropeltic malignant syndrome.  Dr. Kastner explains how neuroleptic malignant syndrome \n“was not the cause of death, was not a contributing factor to the cause of death, and actually did \nnot occur in this patient.”  Tr. at 4190-4197 (Kastner).  “[T]here is no departure at all from any \nstandard of care”.  Tr. at 4197, 4902 (Kastner).  Even Dr. Mikkelsen admitted that a diagnosis of \nneuroleptic malignant syndrome in the absence of a fever, and C. J. has no fever, is a rare \noccurrence.  Tr. 4199 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner explained why C.J. clearly did not have NMS.  Tr. \nat 4198, 4199, 4200, 4203, 4204 (Kastner).  C.J. actually died of pneumonia.  Tr. at 4202 \n(Kastner).   \nW.B. \nDr. Warren agreed that it appears from the records that during the period when W.B. was \nreceiving Geodon and Ativan, Dr. Callahn had not seen WB right away.  However, [t]hat doesn’t \nnecessarily mean he wasn’t seen by a physician.  The PCP also sees people.”  Tr. at 4808 \n(Warren).     \n  118\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 119 of 383\nDr. Warren found that Dr. Callahan’s care and treatment of W.B. met accepted \nprofessional standards.  Tr. at 4811, 4812 (Warren).   \n  C.L. \nAs to C.L., who had lithium tonicity, Dr. Mikkelsen incorrectly claims that C. L. was \ncomatose when admitted to the hospital.  Tr. at 4121, 4122 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner “really [had] \ntrouble with the characterization that C.L. suffered in any way as a result of the care provided by \nCHDC.”  Tr. at 4123 (Kastner).  C.L. was being treated for pneumonia which can impair \nhydration and can raise the lithium level.  Tr. at 4123, 4124 (Kastner).  This is actually an \nexample of “very good care” according to Dr. Kastner.   \n  When Dr. Mikkelsen learned that C.L. had pneumonia that may have caused his lithium \ntonicity, he then claimed that the lithium may have caused him to aspirate and resulted in \naspiration pneumonia.  As Dr. Kastner noted, there is no evidence that C. L. had dysphagia or \nwas aspirating.  Tr. at 4126 (Kastner).  Although Mikkelsen claims tht C. L. had difficulty \nswallowing a pill on one occasion, this is not dysphagia.  Tr. at 4126 (Kastner).  There is also no \nevidence that he had aspiration pneumonia.  Tr. at 4126 (Kastner).    \nDr. Callahan considered environmental and behavioral factors.  He noted that she is \nblind, has autism and had brain surgery at the age of 6, diagnosing her with an anxiety disorder.  \nDr. Warren explains: \nSo, he therefore, reasonably identifies conditions in the patient that \ncould be the etiology of her regression rather than the aggression \njust being environmental.  And a sort of larger question is even if \nthere were possible environmental factors contributing to her \nbehavior, would it be against ethical standards to treat her with \nmedicines.  And for her degree of severe self-injurious behavior \nand aggression, the expert consensus guidelines I mentioned earlier \nclearly indicate the treatment with medicine is appropriate … \n \n  119\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 120 of 383\nTr. at 4682 (Warren).  It is often not possible to make a specific diagnosis.  Tr. at 4683 (Warren).   \n  S.S. \nDr. Warren saw evidence that Dr. Callahan considered changes in behavior before he \ntapered or changed any medication recommendations for S.S.  He also considered input from \nothers as to her behavior before he made any adjustments.   Tr. at 4684 (Warren).   \nDr. Warren saw no evidence that Dr. Callahan only changed his medication recommendation \nbecause her mother so requested.  Dr. Callahan had acquired input from others before even \nspeaking with S.S.’s mother.  Tr. at 4684 (Warren).  Dr. Callahan considered the guardian’s \nrequest with a cost-benefit analysis.  Dr. Warren concluded:   \nI think he was okay with doing this.  The cost-benefit analysis was \nhe had three reports that the behavior was drastically worse on \nMellaril.  The guardian wanted the change.  The change looked \nreasonable.  There was no clear contradiction to it, so he did it.   \n \nTr. at 4805, 4806 (Warren).     \nDr. Miklelsen claims that Dr. Callahan deferred to the guardian for S.S. as to whether to \nuse Zyprexa, but Dr. Kastner points out that the primary care physician is a consultant and it was \nthe primary care physician who made the treatment decision based also on the consultation by an \nendocrinologist.  Tr. at 4181, 4182 (Kastner).   \nThere are three physicians who concur with that \nrecommendation as did the guardian. And if Dr. Mikkelsen wants \nto allege that all three physicians violated the standard of care, he'd \nhave to demonstrate that, which I don't think he can, or \nacknowledge that it's the way that they felt practice should be \nimplemented for this specific individual. \n \nTr. at 4182 (Kastner).  Furthermore, Dr. Kastner noted: \nSo I don't think this individual illustrates any pattern \nat all because there was no standard for a pattern of care \n  120\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 121 of 383\narticulated, there was no pattern of care described. In this \ncase, isolation certainly couldn't support evidence of a \npattern being present. And I would disagree as to whether or not \nthis is even representative of care that deviates from an accepted \nstandard at all, because there are three physicians that concurred \nwith the treatment. They made a judgment that the treatment was \nappropriate. \n \nTr. at 4182 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen incorrectly testified that physicians can stop medication without guardian \nconsent.  Tr. at 4183 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Warren reviewed the medical charts of some patients reviewed and cited by Drs. \nMikkelsen and Holloway.  Tr. at 4664 (Waren). \n  D.F. \nD.F. was admitted to CHDC in 1968; she was referred to Dr. Callahan in 2007.  She was \nreferred due to changes in behavior, compulsive behavior.  DF has severe mental retardation and \nsignification medical problems such as seizure disorder.  She was diagnosed with major \ndepression and OCD.  She took an antidepressant, Serotonin, for depressive disorders; Serotonin \nalso helps with obsessive compulsive symptoms.  Risperidone was added for the treatment of \nagitation and psychotic symptoms.  Psychiatric care with respect to DF was within the \nreasonable exercise of professional judgment.  Tr. at 4664, 4665, 4666 (Warren). \nDr. Callahan considered alternative treatment for D.F.  The IDT had also discussed \nbehavioral strategies.  D.F. was also tried off Risperdone, but her behaviors worsened.  Her \nbehaviors improved once it was restarted.  Tr. at 4666, 4668 (Warren). \nDr. Warren did not agree with Dr. Mikkelsen’s opinion that D.F. had difficulty with the \nintroduction of an antipsychotic medication for someone who was already identified as having \n  121\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 122 of 383\nsignificant behavioral and environmental factors contributing to the problematic behaviors.  Tr. \nat 4667 (Warren).   \n“[A]ugmentation of an SSRI with neuroleptic is standard treatment for difficult \ncompulsive behaviors.”  Tr. at 4667 (Warren).   \nB.L.H \nThe psychiatric care provided to B.L.H. met generally accepted professional standards.  \nB.L.H. has a complex history of mental health diagnosis.  He has profound mental retardation, \nhistory of NMS (an adverse reaction to Haldol), bipolar disorder, pervasive developmental \ndisorder, pica, prior diagnoses of autism, intermittent explosive disorder, depressive disorder.  \nWhen attempts were made to redirect B.L.H., he would often become more aggressive, he was \nvery strong, and would bite people.  Dr. Callahan gave him a working diagnosis and treated him \nconservatively, he recommended the reduction of Haldol and reduced and discontinued the \nPropanolol.  His behaviors worsened, becoming more aggressive with eye-poking behavior.  \nOther medications were tried.  Lithium and Depakote were started, adjusted, and monitored; first \nthe Lithium and then the Depakote.  After many attempts for referral, he was sent to Little Rock \nfor ECT.  He significantly improved.  The maintenance with the ECT did not work and he \nrelapsed.  He was prescribed Mellaril.  Tr. at 4668 - 4672 (Warren).   \nECT is electroconvulsive therapy.  It is used for mania, “which is standard.”  Tr. at 4798 \n(Warren).  “Mania is a condition often with hypersexuality, agitation, aggression, all kinds of \nthings.”  Tr. at 4799 (Warren).  “ECT has fewer side effects than medicines.”  Tr. at 4799 \n(Warren).   \n  122\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 123 of 383\nDr. Callahan’s trials with these medications for B.L.H. should not reflect negatively upon \nDr. Callahan.  “[H]e would try different members of that class of medicine, standard practice, \ngood standard practice.”  Tr. at 4672 (Warren).   \nDr. Warren did not agree with Dr. Holloway that Dr. Callahan did not consider the \nneuroleptic side effects as a cause of anxiety.  Dr. Callahan addressed the side effects.  He \nconsidered the AIMS test.  Tr. at 4672, 4673 (Warren).   \nMost psychiatrists can identify akathisia by observation.  Tr. at 4801 (Warren).   \nDr. Warren also disagreed with Dr. Holloway’s criticism that Dr. Callahan let the psych \nexaminer take the lead in changing B.L.H.’s medications.  Tr. at 4672 (Warren).  The IDT \ncommunicated concerns and considerations.  Dr. Callahan outlined a plan in his note for changes \nin medication based on the behavior.  Tr. at 4673 (Warren).  “[A]nd the primary care physician \ncould decline that recommendation if he wanted or the psychological examiner could speak \nagain directly to Dr. Callahan if she wanted.  It’s standard operation of a multidisciplinary team.”  \nTr. at 4673, 4675 (Warren).   \n   D.H.  \nD.H. is profoundly mentally retarded with medical problems such as seizure disorder, \nblind, occasional pica, a history of low platelets.  He was referred to Dr. Callahan due to \nbehavior problems.  He had a behavior program which he was no longer responding well to. Dr. \nCallahan reviewed his history and reached a diagnostic formulation.  He made recommendations \nfor treatment of an anxiety disorder secondary to seizure disorder with behavioral interventions.  \nSerotonin was prescribed for use if he did not improve with the interventions.  Dr. Callahan \nmonitored the effects of the medications.   Tr. at 4674, 4675 (Warren). \n  123\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 124 of 383\nDr. Warren did not agree with Dr. Mikkelsen that Dr. Callahan did not actively treat \nknown significant medication side effects.  Dr. Callahan gave evidence that he felt the problem \nwas not just environmental, but an anxiety disorder.  Tr. at 4676 (Warren). \nContrary to Dr. Mikkelsen’s concern that Seroquel caused sedation, Seroquel actually showed to \nbe effective.  Tr. at 4677 (Warren).   \nTheir expert consensus guidelines for treatment of behavior \nproblems in mental retardation and that even - - well, they say, \nthey emphasize that even when a specific diagnosis is made, the \ncondition should address behavior symptoms that may be \nappropriate targets for the treatment, and even if an identifiable \npsychiatric diagnosis cannot be made, medicines can be used to \ntreat specific behavioral symptoms.  And they state that \nmedication’s definitely recommended as a part of an initial \ntreatment plan for self-injurious behavior with a risk of lasting \nharm, for aggression to others that poses a physical risk, and the \nlack of response to psychosocial interventions.  All of those things \nwould apply to this patient. \n \nTr. at 4677 (Warren). \nDr. Callahan provided reasoned justification for his diagnosis of anxiety disorder when \nhe saw DH at the initial visit.  Tr. at 4677, 4678 (Warren).  Side effects were clearly monitored \nand documented.  “It was clear that the physicians were communicating, the platelet levels were \nactively monitored, and the choice was made not to change the medicines.”  Tr. at 4678 \n(Warren).    \nEvery lab test would be signed off by a physician and the physician would see him.  Tr. at \n4802 (Warren).   \nDr. Callahan’s notes reflect his strategy to the physician regarding changes in platelet \ncounts.  Tr. at 4803 (Warren).  D.H.’s platelet counts were followed by the physician.  D.H. was \n  124\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 125 of 383\nalso being seen by a neurologist who “doesn’t think it is imperative he comes off the Depakote.”  \nTr. at 4804 (Warren).   \nThe psychiatric care provided to DH met accepted professional standards.  Tr. at 4678 \n(Warren).   \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that from the record Depakote and Serquel were for the treatment \nof a psychiatric disorder.  Tr. at 3872 (Mikkelsen).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen testified that he would not recommend discontinuation of Depakote due to \nlow platelet count unless the count was under 50,000.   \nQ.  So I believe this individual might have had a count of 87,000. \nA.  Yeah.  I wouldn’t worry about that. \nTr. at 3872 (Mikkelsen). \nA.C.J. \nDr. Warren found no evidence to support Dr. Holloway’s conclusion that Dr. Farrell did \nnot provide a DSM diagnosis, performed no diagnostic formulation or differential diagnosis, \nprovided no outline of what medicines are targeting, did not address status of seizure disorder, \ndid not note continuity of care with neurologist, and did not document review of vital signs and \nweights.  Tr. at 4678, 4679 (Warren).   \nDr. Warren did not find a diagnostic formulation or diagnosis.  However, he noted that \nA.C.J. was being seen by a psychiatrist outside of CHDC.  He found that this was not \nrepresentative of the psychiatric care at CHDC.  She did not receive medication \nrecommendations or psychiatric care from Dr. Callahan.  Tr. at 4678, 4680 (Warren). \nA.C.J. is on a variety of medications.  She has a seizure disorder and is “required code \nblue transportation to the emergency room if she has a seizure because of her respiratory \n  125\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 126 of 383\ndistress.”  She also has a vagal nerve stimulator.  Tr. at 4679 (Warren).  Dr. Farrell, the outside \npsychiatrist, provides notes on the medications and blood levels.  Tr. at 4679 (Warren).  \n  K.F. \nDr. Parmley stated that K.F.’s death was not untimely.  She was born with chromosome \n18q deletion.  “The prognosis for people born with that particular deletion is less than 24 hours.”  \nK.F. lived “20 years and 11 months longer than she should have.”  The longest living person \nwith the same condition lived less than a year.  Tr. at 5453, 5454 (Parmley). \nDr. Warren did not agree with Dr. Mikkelsen’s allegation that Dr. Callahan’s notes \nindicated that he would prescribe psychotropic medication for individuals engaging in self-\ninjurious behaviors and aggression due to environmental and behavioral factors.  Dr. Warren did \nnot agree with Dr. Mikkelsen’s allegation that Dr. Callahan will prescribe psychotropic \nmedication that he believes is contraindicated for a patient and will produce harm.  Tr. at 4681, \n4682 (Warren).   \n   “It’s very difficult in the more severely mentally retarded individuals to actually \nascertain the various criteria to make a particular diagnosis.”  Tr. at 4645 (Warren).  Dr. Warren \nexplained: \nAs people become more mentally retarded, they become less \nverbal.  Many of the criteria used to make diagnoses in the DSM-\nIV, which is the usual sort of manual we go by to try and arrive at \npsychiatric diagnoses, many of the criteria listed in there require \nverbal reports from the patient to describe their subjective mental \nexperiences, which individuals with mental retardation even with \nmild levels are not able to do well.  And certainly a lot of the more \nprofoundly, severely profoundly mentally retarded individuals are \nnonverbal. \n \n  126\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 127 of 383\nTr. at 4645, (Warren).   There are behavior disorders in the developmentally disabled population \nthat do not meet the diagnostic characteristics in the DSM-IV.  Tr. at 4646 (Warren).  Some \ndiagnoses may be symptom-based.  Stated by Dr. Warren: \nI think best practice is to try as best you can to arrive at a working diagnosis and \nyou would try and find clusters of symptoms that would suggest a particular \ndiagnostic direction to work in, try and arrive at a working diagnosis even though \nthere aren’t strict criteria available to make that definitive diagnosis. \n \nTr. at 4646 (Warren).  Using psychopharmacology is a standard practice.  Tr. at 4646 (Warren). \nCHDC has a reliable method for identifying medication target symptoms and clinically \njustified diagnosis.  Dr. Callahan explained: \nThis occurs through psychiatric consultation to the primary care physician, \ndiscussions with psych examiners and other treatment team members.  And those \ninteractions are documented in the consultation notes, medical progress notes, the \nIPPS, the special staffings, and positive effects, negative effects, and the side \neffects are thoroughly discussed. \n \nTr. at 4700, 4701 (Warren).  Dr. Callahan makes the diagnoses, not the nonmedical staff. \n[H]e shows the reasoned thinking behind his diagnoses.  There is input from the \nmultidisciplinary team regarding medicine changes, but Dr. Callahan just makes, \nwell, makes a recommendation to the PCP who is the ultimate arbiter who decides \nwhether to accept that or decline that. \n \nTr. at 4703 (Warren).   \nThe prescription of psychotropic medication is based on previous evaluation including all \navailable records and history and a new evaluation.  Information is also gathered from \ncaregivers.  Dr. Callahan considers behavioral reports, records of any unusual symptoms, sleep \nissues, etcetera.  “Basically look at all of the information, and then I would formulate a \ndiagnosis.”  If a psychiatric diagnosis is made, Dr. Callahan then taking all of that into \nconsideration, looking at what I think the best diagnosis at the time is, then I would make a \n  127\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 128 of 383\nrecommendation of medication based on that individual, and what, in my experience, is most \nlikely to work best in that type of individual.  Tr. at 5349 (Callahan).   \nJust because an individual is referred to Dr. Callahan, it does not necessarily mean that he \nwill make a psychiatric diagnosis and prescribe medications to them.  Tr. at 5380 (Callahan).  Dr. \nCallahan would not necessarily make a diagnosis based on someone being merely agitated.  Tr. \nat 5380 (Callahan).   \nDr. Callahan does consider a medication benefit versus risk assessment before \nrecommending a psychotropic medication.  Tr. at 5349 (Callahan).  Dr. Callahan’s medication \nbenefit versus risk assessment is formulated in his head, “what any physician will do.”  Tr. at \n5349 (Callahan).    The primary care physicians are involved in the medication benefit versus \nrisk assessment.  They are “perfectly competent to consider those issues, particularly with regard \nto side effects as well.”  Tr. at 5373 (Callahan).   \nIf an individual is unable to cooperate, for example, with a physical examination or lab \nwork, a “more rapid short-term solution” may be considered.  The physician may consider short-\nterm anxiety medications in such a situation involving the safety of the individual.   \nThe same thing would happen in any hospital setting where you \nhad someone becoming agitated.  They would not wait to see what \nhappened in two weeks.  They would deal with the immediate \nsituation and then proceed from there.   \n \nTr. at 5380 (Callahan).   \nDetermining the difference between a behavior and a symptom of psychiatric diagnosis is \na matter of degree.  If a behavior significantly interferes with a social and occupational function, \nit is a symptom.  Tr. at 4647 (Warren).   \n  128\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 129 of 383\nRegarding the acceptable standard of care for treating individuals with profound mental \nretardation and attempting to determine whether they are suffering from a psychiatric illness, Dr. \nWarren explained that there are general principles to follow.  The review should include history \nand collateral information, such as family and personal history, medical history, medications, \nsleeping and eating patterns.  “[T]ry as best you can to do a mental status examination.”  Tr. at \n4647, 4648 (Warren).  The, after review of, for example, language abilities, speech, appearance, \nmood, any signs of being psychotic, any obsessions or compulsions, judgment and insight, a \nworking diagnosis can be made.  Tr. at 4648 (Warren).  “[T]he treatment plan should be - - the \nsort of guiding principles might be that is you use a medicine to try and use the one that has \nfewer side effects to start with a small does, to increase doses gradually, if you can, try to change \nonly one medicine at a time, look for side effects.”  Tr. at 4648 (Warren).      \nAfter noting that Dr. Mikkelsen treats people with boarderline personality disorder with \npsychotropic medication when there is no indication for psychotropic medication, Dr. Kastner, \nstated: \nWhat I fault Dr. Mikkelsen for is coming here and saying that \nbecause they treat people with psychotropic medications or other \nprocedures at Conway when they feel they need to do something \nthat they have now violated the standard of care.  Dr. Mikkelsen \nviolates that standard of care in his own practice.  He should admit \nthat here and acknowledge that the practices at Conway are no \ndifferent than what he does in his own practice.   \n \nTr. at 4029 (Kastner).  As pointed out by Dr. Kastner, Mikkelsen has prescribed psychotropic \nmedication without a psychiatric diagnosis.  Tr. at 4136, 4137 (Kastner).  Both Dr, Mikkelsen \nand Dr. Holloway agree that psychotropic medication can be used to treat behaviors even when \nthere is no Axis I diagnosis.  Tr. at 4137 (Kastner).   \n  129\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 130 of 383\nPsychotropic medications are not predominantly used for maladaptive behaviors.  Tr. at \n4703 (Warren).  Per the consensus guidelines, if a diagnosis cannot be made, “medication \nselection should be made based on specific behavioral symptoms, and when a specific diagnosis \ncan be made, they should also address behavioral symptoms.”  Tr. at 4683 (Warren).  Dr. Warren \nfound no evidence of CHDC prescribing medication just to suppress aberrant behavior.  Tr. at \n4705 (Warren). \nContrary to the implication of Plaintiff’s counsel, the integration of medication and \npsychosocial intervention are considered.  The psych examiner is present at the interview for this \nreason.  Tr. at 4752 (Warren).       \n“[A] lot of the core symptoms you might look for, especially a measurable type of \nsymptoms, are not going to be the kikind of thing that’s going to show up in the diagnostic \ncriteria.”  Tr. at 5345 (Callahan).  An example is someone with schizophrenia who is \nexperiencing hallucinations.  May of the individuals at CHDC are nonverbal and cannot \narticulate that they are hearing voices.  Their symptoms may be observed by an increase of \nagitation or talking to themselves.  Tr. at 5344, 5345 (Callahan).   \nThe priority is targeting the most severe symptom.   \nAnd so this – basically the psychological examiner gives me a \nreport, I summarize what I think are the most relevant parts of the \nreport, a, with not going into massive detail which, as you know, \ncan be very time consuming and not terribly helpful.  And, again, \nin that particular case, this is an individual which aggression has \nbeen part of his long-term symptoms, and so we can track that \nparticular symptom as part of his treatment plan.  \n \nTr. at 5337 (Callahan); Pl. Ex. 824.  Callahan was treating the underlying disorder.  “The \nsituation factors may exacerbate the underlying disorder.”  Tr. at 5378 (Callahan); Pl. Ex. 824.  \n \n  130\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 131 of 383\nDr. Mikkelsen admitted that all behaviors can be symptoms of mental illness.  Tr. at 3820 \n(Mikkelsen).  Distinguishing symptoms and behaviors, Dr. Mikkelsen stated: \nWell, symptoms are usually - - would usually be more related to \nthe psychiatric diagnosis, and, again, in the field that we are talking \nabout here, the behaviors that you see addressed are usually \naggression, SIB, agitation, and tantrum behavior that do not in and \nof themselves readily fit with any psychiatric diagnosis without \nsome linkage to the psychiatric diagnosis.   \n \nTr. at 3820, 3821 (Mikkelsen).   \n \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that where individuals have intellectual impairment where it is \ndifficult to access internal thoughts, you must be more thoughtful outside the official DSM \nguidelines.  Tr. at 3817, 3818 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that for many individuals with \nprofound mental retardation, the diagnosis that can be made is either autism spectrum disorder or \npervasive developmental disorder.  Tr. at 3826 (Mikkelsen).  There are situations where rule-out \ndiagnosis is appropriate.  Tr. at 3826 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen coauthored with McKenna Psychopharmacological Algorithms for Adults \nWith Developmental Disabilities and Difficult to Diagnose.  Tr. at 3818 (Mikkelsen).  Per said \narticle, Dr. Mikkelsen explained: \n \nWhat I meant was that it gets more and more difficult to make a \npsychiatric diagnosis as intelligence decreases into the severe to \nprofound levels for the reasons that you read in my quote.  And \nthen raising a question for future research as to whether or not \nthere are as yet uncharted syndromes that may become apparent \nwith regard to those more basic physiological regulatory systems \nthat you talked about.  \n \nTr. at 3819 (Mikkelsen).   \n \n`Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that the majority of residents at CHDC have severe or profound \nmental retardation.  Tr. at 3819 (Mikkelsen).  Consistent with his article Psychopharmacological \n  131\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 132 of 383\nAlgorithms for Adults With Developmental Disabilities and Difficult to Diagnose, Dr. Mikkelsen \nagreed that it is more difficult to make a valid psychiatric diagnosis for the majority of \nindividuals at CHDC.  Tr. at 3819 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that it may not always be appropriate to follow the DSMIV very \nstrictly.  Tr. at 3837 (Mikkelsen).  In fact, Dr. Mikkelsen once published an article regarding \nbehavioral phenotypes suggesting in part that you would not necessarily have to make a \npsychiatric diagnosis to render treatment.  He abandoned the hypothesis and went back to \nbelieving that a solid psychiatric diagnosis is needed.  Tr. at 3833, 3834, 3835 (Mikkelsen).   \nThe most definitive way to make a diagnosis is to conduct an assessment of that \nindividual.  Although he found the documentation sufficient to make an opinion.  Dr. Mikkelsen \ndid not perform an individual examination of individuals.  Tr. at 3832 (Mikkelsen). \nWhen asked whether the review of diagnosis after each unsatisfactory medication trial \nmay explain frequent changes of diagnosis, Dr Mikkelsen replied: \n-- [Y]es, you can see a change in diagnosis after you’ve had a result from a \nmedication which makes you think that there’s something else operating. \n \nTr. at 3821 (Mikkelsen).   \n \nAs Dr. Kastner noted, Mikkelsen could not provide any benchmark or standard to support \nhis claim that obsessive-compulsive disorder was diagnosed too frequently at CHDC. Tr. 4134 \n(Kastner).  As to the diagnosis, OCD, Dr. Kastner stated:  \nIt's very, very difficult to make a diagnosis of obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder because we really don't have insight into the \nthinking, and typically it's inferred simply from the presence of \nrepetitive or stereotypic behavior, which is often overlapping \nsignificantly with the autism spectrum disorder diagnoses. So this \nis a fairly common problem. It's seen often in clinical practice. \nThere are many, many, many hundreds of articles on he \noverlapping clinical presentation of the autism spectrum disorders \n  132\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 133 of 383\nand OCD, the difficulty in making the diagnosis, the \nappropriateness of treating those behaviors which, depending on \nhow you look at them, could be considered symptoms of OCD. So, \nagain, I have no concern at all regarding this type of care for this \ntype of patient.  \n \nTr. at 4135, 4136 (Kastner).  The Food and Dradministration has approved the use of certain \ndrugs such as Risperdal and Abilify to treat challenging behaviors.  Tr. at 4141 (Kastner).   \nWhen asked how the diagnosis of OCD is made at CHDC, Dr. Parmely explained, in \npart: \nAll psychiatric diagnoses are based on the American Psychiatric \nAssociation’s Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, which is published by the American Psychiatric \nAssociation, and it outlines what you are looking for to be able to \ndiagnose an illness, and you can have to be able to meet all of \nthose criteria.   \n*   *  * \nThe diagnosis of OCD is based on that. . . The obsessions are the \nthoughts and intrusive things that are interfering with your life and \nmaking you non functional.  The compulsions are the things that \nrelative to the anxiety caused by the other. \n \n*   *  * \n \nTr. at 5451, 5452.  It is difficult to diagnosis OCD in people who are cognitively impaired \nbecause they are unable to describe the obsession.  In many cases it is based on observation.  Tr. \nat 5452, 5453 (Parmley). \nDr. Parmley confirmed that the diagnosis of OCD does not impair the diagnosis of other \ndisorders.  Tr. at 5453 (Parmley). \nIt is not unbelievable to Dr. Parmley that one-quarter of the population at CHDC has \nOCD.  “If they meet the criteria, yes” OCD is interfering with their daily lives.  Tr. at 5472 \n(Parmley). \n  133\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 134 of 383\nOCD is distinct from autism.  Tr. at 5472.  Yet, treatments for OCD and autism are not \nnecessarily different.  Tr. at 5473 (Parmley). \n[M]any of the drugs that are used to treat OCD are also considered \nantidepressents, particularly of the SSRA, selective serotonin \nreuptake inhibitor class.  And those who have been approved by \nthe studies that they have found that they, you know, reduce that \nanxiety that’s in OCD.  Now, an antidepressant might also be \nappropriate for an autistic person, child, so in which case the same \ndrug would be treating both things, or maybe two different ones.   \n \nTr. at 5473, 5474 (Parmley). \n  Dr. Mikkelsen claimed that the number of OCD diagnoses at CHDC is high, however, he \nhad no data to compare the OCD number with other settings.  Tr. at 3829, 3830 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. \nMikkelsen does not know the percentage of patients at an ICF/MR who would be expected to \nhave an OCD diagnosis.  Tr. at 3830 (Mikkelsen).   \n  Although Mikkelsen claims that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should \nnot be diagnosed with a diagnosis of autism, most of the individuals at CHDC with the type of \ndual diagnosis were so diagnosed before coming to CHDC.  Tr. at 4145 (Kastner).  Dr. Holloway \nclaimed there were six (6) persons with a diagnosis of ADHD and autism, but Dr. Kastner could \nnot find evidence to support this claim by Holloway.  Tr. at 4145 (Kastner).  In fact, some of \nthese six (6) actually had the ADHD diagnosis removed after coming to CHDC.  Tr. at 4145, \n4146 (Kastner).   \nIn one study, for example, the researchers found that 55 percent of \nchildren with autism spectrum disorders fulfilled the DSM-IV \ncriteria for ADHD. Obviously there is an empirical basis for \npeople who believe they should treat -- diagnose and treat children \nwith autism as though they also have ADHD. . . . What I'm telling \nyou is that current practice is consistent with making those two \ndiagnoses concurrently in children and treating symptoms of \nADHD in children with autism. There's plenty of literature, I've \nabstracted 16 or so articles, and I don't see there's a need to go into \n  134\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 135 of 383\nthose except again to go back to that treatment of children with \nautism spectrum disorders. \n \nTr. at 4146, 4147.  (Kastner).  Although Mikkelsen implies that ADHD should not be diagnosed \nat all in the population at CHDC, ADHD is diagnosed in this type of population all the time.  Tr. \nat 4146 (Kastner).   \nDr. Mikkelsen provided no comparative data from other facilities as to the number of \nADHD diagnoses.  Tr. at 3830 (Mikkelsen). \n  Dr. Mikkelsen admitted that there is no absolute prohibilitation of the diagnosis of \nADHD in children with significant intellectual impairments.  However, there is a “caution about \nit.”  Tr. at 3840, 3841 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that, according to the DSM, an ADHD \ndiagnosis cannot be made only on the presence of pervasive developmental disorder.  Tr. at 3841 \n(Mikkelsen) \n  Dr. Mikkelsen conceded that there is professional literature which states that ADHD may \nbe an appropriate diagnosis for children with a diagnosis of autism.  Tr. at 3841 (Mikkelsen).  \nSymptoms of ADHD and autism can overlap.  Tr. at 3841 (Mikkelsen).   \n  Dr. Warren found that Dr. Callahan’s notes to be detailed.  “I was struck by the amount \nof detail I could find.”  Tr. at 4650 (Warren).  Dr. Kastner also found the records maintained by \nDr. Callahan are appropriate, adequate, and consistent with general practice.  Tr. at 4156 \n(Kastner).  There is an approval process for the prescription of psychiatric medications.  After \nDr. Callahan makes a medication recommendation, the recommendation goes to the primary care \nphysician.  The primary care physician can accept or choose not to accept the recommendation.  \nThe primary care physician’s determination then goes to the IDT.  If the medication is approved \nby the guardian, then the recommendation is sent to the Human Rights Committee (HRC).  If it \n  135\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 136 of 383\nis approved by the HRC, the medication recommendation is returned to the primary care \nphysician to write the order.  Tr. at 4652, 4653 (Warren).  The psychiatric medication approval \nprocess may be expedited if necessary.  Medications can be ordered within four hours.  Tr. at \n4653 (Warren).   \nTypically, psychotropic medications decrease in dosage after an individual is admitted to \nCHDC.  Tr. at 5345 (Callahan).  They do so “rather dramatically both in terms of number of \nmediations and dosages.”  Tr. at 5345 (Callahan).  CHDC strives to use the smallest dosage of \npsychotropic medication as possible to control the prominent symptoms and allow the individual \nto be comfortable.  However, sometimes, the individual’s symptoms require an increased dosage.  \nTr. at 5345, 5346 (Callahan).   \nCHDC has adopted the most conservative definition of polypharmacy.  Polypharmacy is \ntwo psychiatric medications in use at the same time.  Subcategories such as same class of \nmedication and augmentation are also considered.  Tr. at 5342 (Callahan).  \nSometimes polypharmacy is inherited.  Tr. at 5346 (Callahan).  “People come in on \nmultiple medications, and we just reduce the mediations as much as seems possible given the \ncircumstances and, again, the situation.”  Tr. at 5346 (Callahan). \nIn certain situations, polypharmacy is necessary. \nMy inclination is that how much medication they are taking is \nsignificant, but someone banging their head on the door or the \nwalls, scratching themselves all of the time, picking at their skin to \nthe point of bleeding, attacking other people or trying to, is of a \ngreater concern than exactly how much or how many medications \na person is on. \n \nTr. at 5346 (Callahan).  Polypharmacy is more the norm than not in the provision of psychiatric \nstandard of care.  Tr. at 5347 (Callahan).   \n  136\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 137 of 383\nDr. Warren found that Dr. Callahan used an appropriate selection of medications from an \nappropriate range of classes of psychotropic medications.  Tr. at 4705 (Warren).  He prescribes a \nwide variety of medications.  Dr. Warren explained: \nThere is no correct number of drugs or classes to prescribe for a \nparticular patient population, and you must instead individualize \nyour treatment according to the patient.  And Dr. Callahan’s \npractice showed such careful, individualized, logical, thoughtful \nreasoning with regard to his use of medicines. \n \nTr. at 4705 (Warren).   \n  Contrary to Mikkelsen’s claim that Dr. Callahan used mostly only five (5) medications, \nDr. Callahan prescribed twenty (20) medications.  Tr. at 4148 (Kastner).  Dr. Callahan is clearly \nnot picking the same medications over and over again.  Tr. at 4149 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner \nstated: \nAnd I think there's no evidence that my pattern or Dr. Mikkelsen's \npattern or Dr. Callahan's pattern or CHDC's pattern would violate \nany standard of care because there's no standard pattern. There is \nno standard, if you will, of care in that area. And I think that's \nsomething that is clearly supported by the  consensus statement of \nthe 40 or 45 experts in the \"Psychopharmacology of Persons with \nMental Retardation\" that was published in the mid '90s, I believe. \nIn fact, it's only gotten worse. Every time a new drug comes out, \nthey always look for a new indication. So it just -- we're just \nbombarded with new treatment options and new toys, if you will. \nAs they come out, people just start using them. It's going to be \nmore and more difficult to say that there could possibly be a \ntypical pattern because there are just so many different meds, so \nmany people using them in novel or unapproved uses. It's just \ngoing to become more and more complicated over time. \n \nTr. at 4149, 4150 (Kastner).   \nIn response to Mikkelsen’s claim that Clozaril is the “gold standard,” Dr. Kastner \nresponded:  \n  137\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 138 of 383\nI think that statement reflects Dr. Mikklesen's personal \nidiosyncrasies about the use of Clozaril. Clozaril is a very toxic \nmedication as he described. Patients who are treated with Clozaril \nrequire blood tests every two weeks. And the blood test results \nneed to be given to the pharmacy before the pharmacy will release \nthe medication to the patient. It's that toxic. I don't use it in my \npractice more than a handful of times. I could see it being used \nmore at CHDC, but it's not something that personally I would \nencourage or that I think is required to be done in order to meet the \nstandard of care. You know, on the contrary, if they had high rates \nof use of Clozaril and Dr. Mikkelsen walked in, I could see him \nsaying, \"Oh, this is far too much Clozaril. It's a toxic medication. \n \nTr. at 4152 (Kastner).   \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that the use of Clozaril can be fatal if not carefully monitored.  \nHowever, it is in his opinion an effective medication.  Tr. at 3808 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen \nreferred to Clozaril as the gold standard in the treatment of psychiatric conditions.  Tr. at 3808 \n(Mikkelsen).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen claimed that Dr. Callahan utilized psychotropic medication that might be \nharmful to the patient.  Tr. at 4160 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner explained: \nWell, Dr. Mikkelsen was a bit of a moving target on this \none. In his report, he said that the standard is to, quote, \nfirst do no harm. I'm paraphrasing the Hippocratic oath. And that's \nreally not the standard for the prescription of any treatment \nbecause as Dr. Mikkelsen did acknowledge two days ago, every \ntreatment is potentially harmful, and he couldn't identify a single \npsychotropic or other medication treatment that wasn't potentially \nharmful. If we employed the standard f to first do no harm, we \nwould not be able to prescribe any medications because we \ncouldn't with certainty ensure that our treatments might not harm \nthe individual. So obviously that's an impractical and unrealistic \nand unacceptable standard. And Dr. Mikkelsen in his testimony \nchanged his position and then began to support the reasonable \npractice which is to perform some form of comparison of the \npotential risks and benefits of treatment versus nontreatment. And \nthat's the standard. And I saw evidence of Dr. Callahan practicing \naccording to that standard. \n \n  138\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 139 of 383\nTr. at 4160, 4161 (Kastner).  Dr. Callahan weighs potential risks against potential benefits of \ntreatment consistent with the standard of care, and he is exercising professional judgment.  Tr. at \n4162 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner dod not see any medications prescribed by Dr. Callahan that were \ncontraindicated.  Tr. at 4163 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Warren found the use of psychotropic medications at CHDC to be appropriate, Tr. at \n4703 (Warren).   \nContrary to the implication of Plaintiff’s counsel, CHDC avoids frequent drug and \nmedication dose changes.  Tr. at 4751 (Warren). \nContrary to the implication of Plaintiff’s counsel, CHDC attempts to avoid using two \nmedications in the same therapeutic class.  “There are repeated notes about polypharmacy \nconsiderations at Conway.”  Tr. at 4751 (Warren).  Dr. Warren stated:  “They’re aware of that \nand attempt to avoid it.”  Tr. at 4752 (Warren).   \nContrary to the implication of Plaintiff’s counsel, Dr. Callahan’s notes the attempted \navoidance of long term use of anti-anxiety agents.  Tr. at 4752 (Warren). \n  CHDC has an appropriate system for detecting, monitoring, reporting, responding to and \ndocumenting drug side effects.  Tr. at 4700 (Warren).  Side effects are “addressed by Dr. \nCallahan and the primary care physicians both through clinical observation, systematic \nlaboratory testing, use of the AIMS scale, and when side effects are assessed or detected. They \nare appropriately addressed.”  Tr. at 4700 (Warren).   \n  As to Mikelsen’s claims as to the detection and monitoring of side effects, Dr. Kastner \n“found that Mikkelsen’s allegations about potential side effects were purely conjecture.”  Tr. at \n4170 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner reviewed the cases sampled by Dr. Mikkelsen, and those cases \n  139\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 140 of 383\n“were clear that side effects are monitored.”  Tr. at 4171, 4172).  Dr. Kastner found adequate \nside effect monitoring.  Tr. at 4173 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kastner stated that the AIMS test used at CHDC “is the instrument that’s the most \nwidely used for the purposes of screening for the presence of tardive dyskinesia.  Tr. at 4231 \n(Kastner).   \n  CHDC utilizes a protocol which automatically orders laboratory tests pursuant to each \nindividual’s prescriptions.  It is automatic.  Dr. Callahan then reviews the results.  Tr. at 4701 \n(Warren).  Dr. Warren stated that six month review for tardive dyskinesia is appropriate.  Tr. at \n4702 (Warren).  According to Dr. Warren, “with a reasonable degee of medical certainty”, a \ndoctor cannot identify tardive dyskinesia without seeing the patient.  Tr. at 4704 (Warren).   \n  As to Mikkelsen’s alleged concerns about the frequency of psychiatric evaluations, Dr, \nKastner found that Mikkelsen did not offer any standard or practice pattern, and that Mikkelsen \ndid no analysis of the current practice at CHDC.  Tr. at 4165, 4166 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner did \nnot see any evidence that follow up recommendations were problematic in any way.  Tr. at 4165.   \n  Dr. Kastner, contrary to Mikkelsen, did not see any evidence of a pattern of delay in \nimplementing treatment plans in any of the clinical practices at CHDC Tr. at 4159 (Kastner).   \n \n7.  THE OPINIONS OF PLAINTIFF’S PSYCHIATRIC EXPERTS \nARE UNRELIABLE \n \n  The Defendants have already described how the sampling techniques of Dr. Mikkelsen \nand Dr. Holloway were unscientific and unrepresentative.  However, there are additional reasons \nfor rejecting or discounting the opinions of Dr. Mikkelsen and Dr. Holloway, such as their lack \nof qualifications, their lack of standards, inconsistencies between their testimony and their \npractice, their mistakes, and their misrepresentations.   \n  140\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 141 of 383\nDr. Mikkelsen \n  Dr. Mikkelsen holds no primary care certification.

Dr. Mikkelseon holds no certifications \nin and does not practice family medicine or pediatrics.  Tr. at 3783 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen \nhas no hospital admitting privileges anywhere.  Tr. at 3784 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen has no \ncredentials as to primary care services.  Tr. at 3784 (Mikkelsen).  He does not bill Medicaid, \nMedicare, or commercial insurers for primary care services.  Tr. at 3785 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. \nMikkelsen does not provide treatment for pneumonia.  Tr. at 3785 (Mikkelsen).  As the \nconsulting medical director for The Mentor Network, Dr. Mikkelsen does not supervise all their \nmedical services and he does not provide hands-on supervision of the medical services.  Tr. at \n3785, 3786 (Mikkelsen).  As a result, Dr. Mikkelsen has an inadequate background to comment \non general medical services.   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen has no certification pertaining to end-of-life care.  Tr. at 3783 \n(Mikkelsen).   \n    In his practice, Dr. Mikkelsen does not supervise any practicing therapists, such as \nspeech-language therapists, occupational therapists, or physical therapists.  Tr. at 3785 \n(Mikkelsen).  Dr, Mikkelsen has no formal training in the delivery of nursing care, occupational \ntherapy services, or nutritional services.  Tr. at 3782 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen is not certified \nin psychology and is not credentialed by any agency or entity to provide psychological services.  \nTr. at 3783 (Mikkelsen).  In his practice, Dr. Mikkelsen does not directly supervise any \npsychologists.  He is not credentialed to provide psychological services by any insurance \ncompany.  Tr. at 3784 (Mikkelsen).  He does not bill Medicaid, Medicare, or commercial \n  141\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 142 of 383\ninsurers for psychology services.  Tr. at 3784 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen has not taken any \nvoluntary recertification in adult psychiatry since his initial certification in 1978.  Tr. at 3781, \n3782 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen has not taken any voluntary recertification in child psychiatry \nsince his initial certification in 1981.  Tr. at 3782 (Mikkelsen).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen was provided with a spreadsheet of individuals on psychotropic drugs at \nCHDC by the DOJ that he had not requested.  Tr. at 3786 (Mikkelsen).  Prior to his tour of \nCHDC, Dr. Mikkelsen received documents from the DOJ, selected by the DOJ.  Tr. at 3786, \n3787 (Mikkelsen).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen did not review CHDC residents in any proportions to the overall general \npopulation, such as by disability or intellectual level.  Tr. at 3787 (Mikkelsen).  There was at \nleast one individual whom Dr. Mikkelsen reviewed only because other DOJ consultants asked \nhim to.  Tr. at 3788 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that his sample ended up being younger \nresidents.  Tr. at 3788, 3789 (Mikkelsen).  Also, the examples Dr. Mikkelsen ended up with were \nresidents who took more medication than the average resident at CHDC.  Tr. at 3789 \n(Mikkelsen). The sample that Dr. Mikkelsen ended up with were individuals who had more \nadverse outcomes than the average individual at CHDC.  Tr. at 3789 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. \nMikkelsen selected 76 charts “drawn from low utilizers of medications, high utilizers of \nmedications, and then some based on the diagnostic constellation that was listed on the face \nsheet, probably leading more toward complex diagnostic formulations.”  Tr. at 3790, 3791 \n(Mikkelsen).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen agrees that if an observer interacts with clients it may certainly affect the \nrepresentativeness of the observations of the client’s behavior.  Tr. at 3793, 3794 (Mikkelsen).  \n  142\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 143 of 383\nAlthough he was doubtful that his presence was causing a disturbance, he left a residence where \nhe was told he was upsetting some of the residents.  Tr. at 3794 (Mikkelsen). \nDr. Mikkelsen did not interview Dr. Eldon Schulz, a key physician providing psychiatric care to \nresidents of CHDC  Tr. at 3791 (Mikkelsen). \n  Dr. Mikkelsen did not conduct a psychiatric assessment of any individual at CHDC.  Tr. \nat 3831 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that a professional might be able to offer treatment without \nevidence of its efficacy and still not violate the standard of care.  He agreed with the caveat that \nin the case of psychopharmacology they should have some rational hypothesis.  Tr. at 3805 \n(Mikkelsen).     \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that you may be able to deviate from a guideline and still not \nviolate a professional standard.  Tr. at 3815 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed with the quote from the AACAP that stated: \nThe practice parameters are not intended to define a standard of \ncare, nor should they be deemed exclusive of all proper methods of \ncare or exclusive of other legitimate methods of care directed at \nobtaining the desired results.  The ultimate judgment regarding the \ncare of a patient and family must be made by the clinician in light \nof all the clinical evidence presented by the patient and family, the \ndiagnostic and treatment options available, and available resources. \n \nTr. at 3816 (Mikelsen).   \n  Speaking to his experience in Massachusetts, Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that CARF evaluators \nperform rigorous evaluations.  Tr. at 3797 (Mikkelsen).   Speaking to his experience in \nMassachusetts, Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that CARF surveyors review general medication issues and \nwhether there are overmedications at the facility.  Tr. at 3797, 3798 (Mikkelsen).  Massachusetts \n  143\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 144 of 383\nCARF surveyors review for individuals who are obtund, drooling, or experiencing side effects.  \nTr. at 3798 (Mikkelsen).    \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that you cannot implement a treatment plan without the informed \nconsent of a legal guardian.  Tr. at 3813 (Mikkelsen).   \nRegarding his work at MENTOR, Dr. Mikkelsen did not know whether nurse \npractitioners without board certification in psychiatry provide psychiatric services to MENTOR \nclients.  Tr. at 3814 (Mikkelsen). \n  Dr. Mikkelsen admitted that there is no real substantial evidence, no definitive treatise on, \nthe effectiveness of treatments for borderline personality disorder.  Tr. at 3806, 3807 \n(Mikkelsen).   \n  Any psychotropic medication and any medication have the potential to cause harm.  Tr. at \n3807 (Mikkelsen).  The potential harm of medications does not preclude Dr. Mikkelsen from \nusing them.  Tr. at 3808 (Mikkelsen).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that specific medications might be used for novel or unapproved \nuses or doses which exceed the FDA approval if there is a reasonable neuropharmacological \nhypothesis.  Tr. at 3822 (Mikkelsen).   \nPsychotropic drugs may be tried to treat borderline personality disorder.  Tr. at 3826, \n3827 (Mikkelsen).   \nWhen asked if somebody is aggressive and self-injurious and you cannot find a \nfunctional cause, whether it is acceptable to treat the individual with psychotropic medication, \nDr. Mikkelsen replied: \n[I]f it looks as if serious physical harm to the individual or to \nothers is imminent, then obviously you have to act in a number of \nways to keep that individual and/or other individuals safe, and that \n  144\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 145 of 383\nmay include pharmacological intervention until such time as you \ncan figure out what is going on ….    \n \nTr. at 3828 (Mikkelsen). \n  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that pursuant to the Expert Consensus Guideline Series Treatment \nof Psychiatric and Behavioral Problems in Mental Retardation, that Risperdal is the first choice \nof an antipsychotic medication for psychosis, self-injurious behavior, and aggressive or \ndestructive behavior.  Tr. at 3841, 3842 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that it sounded \nreasonable that valproic acid (Depakote), followed by Tegretol and its derivatives are the first \nchoice of mood stabilizers, anticonvulsant medications for the treatment of self-injurious \nbehavior or aggressive and destructive behavior.  Tr. at 3842 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed \nthat an SSRI (none specifically) is the first choice of an antidepressant for depression for self-\ninjurious behavior, for aggression, for destructive behavior, for nonaggressive agitation, and for \nanxiety.  Tr. at 3842, 3843 (Mikkelsen).  He acknowledged that Depakote, SSRI, and Risperdol, \nall identified as first choice medications, constitute approximately more than 72 % of the \nprescriptions recommended by Dr. Callahan.  Tr. at 3843 (Mikkelsen).   \n  Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that Clozapine should only be considered for persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities and comorbid psychotic illness who have not improved on at least two \nclinical trials of more traditional antipsychotics.  Tr. at 3843, 3844 (Mikkelsen).   \nApproximately 278 individuals at CHDC receive psychotropic medication.  According to \nDr. Mikkelsen, more than half of those individuals receive two or more psychotropic \nmedications. Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that approximately 121 only receive one psychotropic \nmedication.  Tr. at 3844 (Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen did not even know how many in his seven \nor eight case examples were taking only one psychotropic medication.  Tr. at 3844 (Mikkelsen). \n  145\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 146 of 383\nDr. Mikkelsen did not know how many people at CHDC receive two or more \nneuroleptics at the same time.  Tr. at 3871 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that even among experts, there may be different patterns of \npsychiatric diagnoses.  Tr. at 3832 (Mikkelsen).   \n Dr. Mikkelsen agreed that the presence of a poor outcome or adverse outcome is not \nsufficient by itself to conclude that the standard of care has not been met.  Tr. at 3802 \n(Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Matson could not identify anyone at CHDC who was overmedicated.  Tr. at 1240 \n(Matson). \nDr. Mikkelsen could not provide numbers for what he would consider an appropriate \ncaseload for a psychiatrist at CHDC.  Tr. at 3853 (Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that guardian consent is needed to treat a patient.  Tr. at 3862 \n(Mikkelsen).   \nDr. Mikkelsen agreed that the ICF/MR regulations and CARF survey guideline are \naccepted professional standards.  Tr. at 3794 (Mikkelsen). \n \nDr. Holloway \n  The opinions of Dr. Holloway should be rejected or discounted because she failed to \nconduct a scientifically reliable study, she has limited experience with ICF/MR’s, she has \nrevealed inconsistencies between her testimony and her practice, and she made many errors in \nher review.   \n  Holloway admits that she did not use any statistical procedure to establish the presence of \na pattern in this case.  Tr. at 2622 (Holloway).  Holloway does not know how many charts she \n  146\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 147 of 383\nreviewed of children younger than 18 years old.  Tr. at 2623 (Holloway).  Holloway testified that \nshe chose charts with different diagnoses on the diagnostic spectrum, rather than trying to get a \nstatistically valid sample.  So she may have evaluated an individual with a certain diagnosis only \nbecause that individual has that diagnosis, even if he was the only one at the center with that \ndiagnosis.  Tr. at 2623 (Holloway).   \n  Other than the facilities that she works with in connection to settlement agreements for \nthe DOJ, Holloway has never worked in an ICF/MR facility to provide psychiatric care.  Tr. at \n2628 (Holloway).   \n  The facilities that Holloway provides consulting to both use IQ scores and adaptive skill \nscores and combine them to establish a diagnosis of the intellectual disability,  Tr. at 2632 \n(Holloway).   \n  Holloway admitted  that it is appropriate for CHDC to use the DM-ID as well as the \nDSM-IV-T.  Tr. at 2633 (Holloway).  The DM-ID was created because there are not enough \nadaptations in the DSM-IV-TR for individuals to make sure diagnostics would be appropriate for \nthe developmentally disabled population.  Tr. at 2634 (Holloway).   \n  Holloway admits that she did not use the ICF/MR standard at all in her review of CHDC.  \nTr. at 2634 (Holloway).  Holloway was under the mistaken belief that peer reviews were \nrequired under the ICF/MR regulations.  Tr. at 2634 (Holloway).   \nHolloway inappropriately uses policy statements as a standard for care to support her \nopinions even though she is aware that they specifically state in the body of the policy statement \nthat they are not intended to define a standard of care.  Tr. at 2634 (Holloway).  Holloway admits \nthat the policy statement for JCAHO says it is intended for use in hospital settings and for \nhospital patients.  Tr. at 2636 (Holloway).   \n  147\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 148 of 383\nShe admits that the policy statements she used are really JCAHO standards and should not be \napplied when reviewing a facility like CHDC.  Tr. at 2636 (Holloway).   \n  Holloway agreed that it is difficult to arrive at an Axis I diagnosis when a patient is \nnonverbal, like many of the residents at CHDC, and a provisional or rule out diagnosis would be \nappropriate.  Tr. at 2637,2638 (Holloway).  Rule-out diagnosis are common when a resident is \nnew to the facility or has changed to a new living area, or someone who has a diagnosis but is \npresenting with new issues.  Tr. at 2637 (Holloway).  \nPinecrest, the facility where Holloway provides consulting services, admits adolescents.  \nTr. at 2638 (Holloway).   \n  Dr. Holloway admits to using polypharmacy, chemical restraints and off-label drugs in \nher practice.  Tr. at 2650-51 (Holloway). \n  The ICF/MR guidelines only require that the Interdisciplinary Team complete their \nevaluation within 30 days of the individual’s admission, which is not to say that the psychiatric \nevaluation must be done within that timeframe.  Tr. at 2652 (Holloway).  \n   Dr. Holloway did not do a comparative assessment to see how many people at CHDC had \na delay in their initial assessment at CHDC.  Tr. at 2653 (Holloway).   \nDr. Holloway alleged that CHDC was deficient because T.M. did not have a psychiatric \nassessment done as quickly as she thought was necessary, however, she does not even know if \nT.M. was actually admitted, or if he was on a respite status.  Tr. at 2653 (Holloway).  Dr. \nHolloway could not name any standard to support her claim that individual placed at CHDC \nshould receive expert services within any certain time line, similar to those who are hospitalized.  \nTr. at 2653 (Holloway).   \n  148\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 149 of 383\nDr. Holloway admits that there is no standard that requires peer reviewing for psychiatric \nservices at CHDC.  Tr. at 2654 (Holloway).  She also admits that there is no standard that \nrequires a certain screening or assessment methods to be used at CHDC.  Tr. at 2654 (Holloway).  \nAnd she agrees that there is no standard that requires a face to face evaluation by a psychiatrist \nevery time an individual is experiencing difficulties that have resulted in restrictive measures \nsuch as the use of physical restraints or psychotropic medication.  Tr. at 2655 (Holloway)  There \nis also no standard that requires a face to face evaluation when an individual has been prescribed \nmedication changes or when they receive a diagnostic workup.  Tr. at 2655 (Holloway).  \n  Dr. Holloway agrees that the use of psychotropic medication to treat or suppress aberrant \nbehavior is not always improper.  Tr. at 2658 (Holloway).      \n  Dr. Holloway could not specifically identify anyone at CHDC who was receiving a \npsychotropic medication but who did not have an Axis I diagnosis.  Tr. at 2658 (Holloway). \n  There is no literature that requires that the percentage of people on psychotropic \nmedications in a facility must be under a certain amount.  Tr. at 2660 (Holloway). \n  Resident W.B. had stat medication on 15 occasions over a 2-year period and represented \n14% of all stat medications for the entire facility during the time period which Dr. Holloway \nexamined CHDC.  The remaining 37 individuals who had stat medication had only a total of 96 \ninstances of stat medication which averages out to 3 uses per individual over a 2-year period.  Tr. \nat 2661 (Holloway).  Dr. Holloway had no comparative benchmarks to tell the Court whether \nthis was a high or low rate compared to other ICF/MR’s.  Tr. at 2661(Holloway).  \n  The rate of tardive dyskinesia at CHDC is well below the rate published in the literature \nas to what you would expect for this population.  Tr. at 2662 (Holloway). \n  149\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 150 of 383\n  Dr. Holloway thinks that Dr. Callahan or the psychiatrist at CHDC must be the “main \nplayer” in decisions affecting a resident’s care, it should not be a team effort or team decision.  \nTr. at 2664 (Holloway).  This is contrary to the IDT process required by the ICF/MR regations.  \n  Dr. Holloway agrees that if a treating physician or consulting psychiatrist recommends a \ndrug for a resident at CHDC, and the guardian does not agree with the use of that particular drug, \nCHDC can not administer that drug and neither would any other doctor in the country, the \nguardian must be in agreement.  Tr. at 2666 (Holloway). \n  Dr. Holloway did not meet with or speak to Dr. Reid or Dr. Farrell who both provide \npsychiatric services to individuals at CHDC. Tr. at 2668 (Holloway).  \n  Dr. Holloway agrees that if someone is seen by an outside psychiatrist, then the outside \npsychiatrist would be responsible for managing that individual’s care.  Tr. at 2676 (Holloway). \n  Dr. Holloway refused tp consider whether T.M. was afraid of Dr. Holloway and was \ntrying to get away from her when staff were helping him to leave the pool facility.  T.M. fell in \nthe pool while he was attempting to put distance between himself and Dr. Holloway.  Tr. at 2681 \n(Holloway).  Dr. Holloway did not do any follow-up review of records over the next few days to \nsee if TM was exhibiting side effects or if he was really afraid of her at the pool.  Tr. at 2681 \n(Holloway).   \n  Dr. Holloway said that she could attest with medical certainty that B.H. is suffering from \ntardive dyskenisia, but she did not conduct a clinical observation of B.H., has never met him and \ndoes not know his AIMS test result scores.  Tr. at 2687-91 (Holloway). \n  Dr. Holloway confirmed that some of the children who live at the facility where Dr. \nHolloway provides consultation services, have been placed there because their psychiatric illness \n  150\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 151 of 383\nhas caused them to harm themselves or others.  Those children are provided with education \nclasses on the campus of the facility.  Tr. at 2700 (Holloway).   \n  Holloway agrees that parent and guardians have the right to chose where their children \nreceive their care and to decide what is in the best interest of the child.  Tr. at 2643 (Holloway).  \n  \n8.  PLAINTIFF’S EXPERT, DR. MATSON, A PSYCHOLOGIST, IS \nNOT QUALIFIED TO RENDER OPINIONS AND HIS OPINIONS \nLACK MERIT AS TO PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL \nSERVICES \n \nDr. Matson is not a physician and he has no credentials to diagnose psychiatric illness or \nhe use of psychotropic medications.  Tr. at 4242 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kastner describes how Dr. Matson has a certain hostility towards psychiatric or \nbiological causes of behavior. Tr. at 4252-4255 (Kastner).  In fact, Dr. Matson’s views are not \neven consistent with the testimony of other DOJ experts, Mikkelsen, and Holloway.  Tr. at 4255 \n(Kastner).  As stated by Dr. Kastner: \nWell, if his recommendations were to rise to the level of \ntreating what I would consider to be primarily psychiatric \nconditions with an operant or behavioral approach, I think that \nwould violate the standard of care. I think Dr. Matson probably \nwould need to exercise some caution in the rigorousness of his \nopinions, that they need to take into account that not all behaviors \nhave a function and that functional analysis and behavioral \ninterventions may not always be clinically appropriate.   \n \nSo, for example, an individual who is hallucinating should not be \ntreated primarily with a behavior approach. Personally, I would not \nrecommend the use of a behavioral approach for the treatment of \nanxiety disorders in persons with mental retardation and \ndevelopmental disabilities. I believe Dr. Matson would disagree, \nand that's okay. It's his opinion. I have a different opinion. We \ncome from different theoretical perspectives. But again, I don't \nbelieve Dr. Matson can adequately represent the standard of care \nwithout taking into account the opinions of other disciplines and \nother reasonably qualified professionals. \n  151\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 152 of 383\n \nTr. at 4259 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kastner is very pleased with the integration of psychology and medicine at CHDC.  \nTr. at 4260 (Kastner).  The data collected by the psych examiners is extremely useful to the \nconsulting psychiatrist, Dr. Callahan.  Tr. at 4260 (Kastner).  The conduct of the psych \nexaminers and Dr. Callahan is absolutely consistent with the standard of care.  Tr. at 4260 \n(Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kastner confirmed that the psychiatric assessments at CHDC contained a core \nsymptoms diagnostic formulation and a rationale for the use of psychotropic medications.  Tr. at \n4265 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kastner found that the CHDC psychiatrists and professionals use an appropriate \nassessment and diagnostic procedure, and do not need to use standardized rating scales.  Tr. at \n4269 (Kastner).  \n  Dr. Kastner stated that psychometric instruments, or data collection tools, are not a \nrequired component of the psychiatric diagnostic process.  Tr. at 4244 (Kastner).  Data collection \ntools and standardized instruments are not the standard of care.  Tr. at 4245 (Kastner).   \n  Dr, Matson alleged excessive use of psychotropic medication without identifying an \nappropriate benchmark to support that claim.  Tr. at 4268 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Matson cited an article that claimed the rate of psychotropic medication use in \nOklahoma was about 22 percent.  Tr. at 3979 (Kastner).  Actually, that article referred to \npsychotropic medication use at Hisson Center and did not include the use of antiepileptic \nmedications, which would have put the rate over 50 percent.  Tr. at 3979, 3980 (Kastner).  This \nrate is comparable to the 45 to 50 percent rate at CHDC.  Tr. at 3979, 3980 (Kastner).  Dr. \nMatson did not appropriately represent that benchmark.  Tr. at 3980 (Kastner).   \n  152\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 153 of 383\n  Contrary to the opinions of Dr. Matson, Dr. Kastner noted at there is no specific standard \nfor tapering psychotropic medications.  Tr.  4264 (Kastner).  The tapering practices at CHDC are \nin compliance with accepted professional standards. Tr. at 4264 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Kastner found that Matson’s concerns regarding psychotropic medication use did not \nhave any merit.  Tr. at 4263 (Kastner).   \n  Dr. Matson agreed that he would not say that in no case where there is an Axis I \ndiagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder that the individual should not be treated with \npsychotropics.  Tr. at 1235, 1236 (Matson).   \n  Dr. Matson agreed that it could be appropriate to use a psychotropic medication or other \nmedications if you are unable to identify behavioral causes.  Tr. at 1236 (Matson).     \n  Dr. Matson agreed that off label drug practice is acceptable in some instances.   \n \nThe FDA will approve a drug for a certain use, for example, a \npsychotropic drug, an antipsychotic drug would be approved for \npsychosis.  It might also be approved for other purposes like manic \ndepressive disorder or something like that, but there might be other \nsituations where there isn’t another treatment alternative where it \nhasn’t been approved yet by the FDA but where the prescribing \nperson may make a determination that it might be effective for that \nindividual.  It might be for aggression, for example, if that’s what \nwe’re talking about, and that would be called an off label \nprescription. \n \nTr. at 1238, 1239 (Matson). \n   Matson, admitted that some individuals at CHDC are on psychotropic drugs to control \nseizures.  Tr. at 1239 (Matson).  When Dr. Matson compiled his data on psychotropic drugs, he \ndid not completely factor out of the data the use of psychotropics for seizures.  Tr. at 1239 \n(Matson). \n  153\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 154 of 383\nRegarding T.G. and her use of Risperadol, Dr. Matson agreed that some professionals \nthink it is a good thing to prescribe Risperadol.  Tr. at 1239, 1240 (Matson). \n  Dr. Matson was not referring to anyone specifically at CHDC as having suffered physical \nharm or irreversible side effects due to psychotropic drugs.  Tr. at 1242, 1243 (Matson).  Dr. \nMatson is not a psychiatrist.  He agreed that he would leave it up to a psychiatrist to determine \nany specific harm from a psychotropic drug.  Tr. at 1242, 1243 (Matson).  \nDr. Matson did not know how many people or committees have to approve the use of \npsychotropic medications before a CHDC starts the medication regimen.  Tr. at 1243 (Matson). \n  Dr. Matson did not know of anyone at CHDC who is on psychotropic medication who is \nnot diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder.  Tr. at 1244 (Matson). \nDr. Matson did not evaluate any CHDC residents to determine whether they could be \ntaken off their psychotropic medication.  “No.  Again, that would be for the psychiatrist to do.”  \nDr. Matson agreed that he is not a psychiatrist.  Tr. at 1244, 1242, 1243 (Matson). \nDr. Matson agreed that the topic of psychotropic medications having limited empirical \nsupport as treatment for self-injurious behavior is contentious, that some professionals strongly \nbelieve that it is useful for self-injurious behavior.  Tr. at 1244, 1245 (Matson). \n  Dr. Matson agreed that sometimes when an individual is tapered from medication, they \ncan experience a reemergence or significantly increased incidence of problem behavior.  Tr. at \n1246 (Matson). \nHe agreed that guardian consent is required for a psychotropic medication taper.  Tr. at \n1246, 1247 (Matson).      \nDr. Matson did not know the statewide rate of psychotropic drug use for persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities in Arkansas.  Tr. at 1268 (Matson). \n  154\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 155 of 383\nB.  CHDC PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT \n \nCHDC’s psychological examiners are licensed and regulated by the State of Arkansas to \npractice their profession at CHDC. Ark. Code § 17-97-101 et seq., Tr. at 5876 (Walsh).  One of \nCHDC’s psychological examiners, Ms. Glenn, had first had experience with the state’s \nregulation of psychological examiners. Tr. at 6688 (Glenn).  As president of the Arkansas \nAssociation of Masters in Psychology, Ms. Glenn advocated for an independent licensure for \nmaster’s level psychologists, which would allow those psychologists to practice without a \nsupervising clinician. Tr. at 6688 (Glenn).  In 2007, while president of the AAMP, Ms. Glenn \ncoauthored a bill that was enacted in Arkansas in 2007. Tr. at 6688 (Glenn).  That statute \nestablished the independent practice of a master’s level psychologists in Arkansas. Ark. Code § \n17-97-303, Tr. at 6688 (Glenn).  The statute requires master’s level psychologists to go through \n3,000 hours of supervised practice after their initial licensure along with a 600 internship \nsupervised by a board certified psychologist, after which they can practice without a clinical \nsupervisor. Ark. Code § 17-97-303, Tr. at 6688 (Glenn).  \nAll CHDC psychological examiners are also qualified to practice at CHDC pursuant to \nICF/MR regulation. 42 CFR § 483.430(b)(5)(v). Tr. at 4246 (Kastner).  CHDC psychological \nexaminers are also Qualified Mental Retardation Professionals, per CMS regulations. 42 CFR § \n483.430(a), Tr. at 5875 (Walsh).  Six CHDC psychological examiners are permitted to practice \nindependently, without a clinical supervisor. Ark. Code § 17-97-303, Tr. at 5876 (Walsh).  Only \nfour CHDC psychological examiners are required by state law to practice under the clinical \nsupervision of CHDC’s Chief of Psychology, Dr. Reddig. Ark. Code § 17-97-303, Tr. at 2099, \n5876 (Walsh).   \n  155\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 156 of 383\nAlthough some of CHDC’s psychological examiners are licensed independently, Dr. \nReddig still serves as their clinical supervisor. Tr. at 6690 (Glenn).  In that position, Dr. Reddig \ndiscusses the psychological examiners caseloads with them, reviews their behavior programs, \nand assists them with various other issues. Tr. at 6690 (Glenn).  Some psychological examiners \nat CHDC have been licensed for over 20 years. Tr. at 2081, 6550 (Reddig, Priest).  At least seven \nof CHDC’s psychological examiners have worked in settings other than CHDC.  Tr. at 2109 \n(Reddig).  Some CHDC psychological examiners have published in their field, including topics \nsuch as anxiety and depression in persons with mental retardation. Tr. at 6683 (Glenn).  All \nCHDC psychological examiners read literature in their field, go to workshops, follow trends in \ntheir field, and vet whatever they can based on the needs of their practice. Tr. at 5891 (Walsh).  \nCHDC’s psychological examiners meet at least twice a month at the psychology department’s \nstaff meeting, which includes Dr. Reddig, and they also have monthly quality circle meetings \nwhere they discuss issues that are occurring at the center or with individual clients.  Tr. at 6690 \n(Glenn).   \nDr. Reddig is the chief psychologist at CHDC and has served in that position since 2004.  \nTr. at 1936, 1937 (Reddig).  It is undisputed that Dr. Reddig is qualified to clinically supervise \nCHDC’s psychological examiners. Tr. at 1187 (Matson).  He received his doctorate in counselor \neducation in 1993 and has published in his field. Tr. at 1939, 1941-42 (Reddig).  Dr. Reddig is \nthe clinical supervisor for all ten masters level psychological examiners at CHDC. Tr. at 1936, \n1786, 6690 (Reddig, Adams, Glenn).  Dr. Reddig has worked for the Arkansas Division of \nDevelopmentally Disabled for sixteen years during which, he has worked throughout the state, \nconsulting with community providers, public schools, and individuals receiving waiver services, \nfrequently conducting and overseeing functional assessments for individuals. Tr. at 2073 \n  156\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 157 of 383\n(Reddig).  For instance, after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Dr. Reddig worked on an emergency \nbasis at Fort Chaffee to provide services to individuals with mental health issues and \ndevelopmental disabilities. Tr. at 2074 (Reddig).  From 1988 to 1993, Dr. Reddig also served on \nthe Arkansas State Licensing Board. Tr. at 2074 (Reddig).  Dr. Reddig is highly knowledgeable \nof licensing requirements for psychologists in the State of Arkansas as well as the limitations of \nthe psychological examiners at CHDC.  Tr. at 2075 (Reddig). \nThe caseloads of CHDC psychological examiners are all appropriate. Tr. at 4247 \n(Kastner), 5884 (Walsh).  Plaintiff produced no evidence at trial that any CHDC resident has \nbeen negatively impacted because the CHDC Psychology Department was understaffed.  In fact, \nPlaintiff has produced no evidence that the CHDC Psychology Department is understaffed.  \nPlaintiff’s expert’s, Dr. Matson’s, suggestion to hire additional psychologists at CHDC is \nunrealistic. Tr. at 5884 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson’s proposed additions to CHDC’s Psychology \nDepartment would make CHDC the best staffed psychology program in the country. Tr. at 5884 \n(Walsh).  The average number of individuals per psychological examiner at CHDC is the same \ncaseload that Defendants’ expert, Dr. Walsh, had as a practitioner at and ICF/MR. Tr. at 5884 \n(Walsh). \nEach resident at CHDC is assigned to a psychological examiner even if the individual \ndoes not have a psychiatric diagnosis or behavior program. Tr. at 6555 (Priest).  Therefore, some \ncaseloads may be larger than others because some CHDC residents do not use as many \npsychology services as others.  Tr. at 6555 (Priest).  Some CHDC residents do not require any \ndirect attention of a psychological examiner, which allows the CHDC psychology department to \nadjust caseloads to ensure residents who need the attention of psychological examiners get it. Tr. \nat 5884-85 (Walsh).  The psychological examiners’ caseloads at CHDC range from 22 to 60 \n  157\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 158 of 383\nresidents because, for example, the resident of the Willow units do not have as many \npsychological needs relative to other CHDC residents. Tr. at 5885 (Walsh).  Because only 428 \nCHDC residents have some type of behavior plan, the average active caseload for psychological \nexaminers is between 38 and 39 residents. Tr. at 5885 (Walsh).  CHDC psychological \nexaminers’ caseloads are not onerous. Tr. at 4247 (Kastner), 5885 (Walsh). \n \n9.  PLAINTIFF’S EXPERTS’ FLAWED ANALYSES \nPlaintiff’s experts’ methodology was nonscientific and some of Plaintiff’s experts’ \nallegations were gratuitous and unreasoned. Tr. at 4241-42 (Kastner), 5807, 5931 (Walsh).  For \nexample, Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson’s, concluded that the CHDC Quick Reference Guides \nshould either contain more information or not be used at all, and neither position has a basis in \nprofessional standards. Tr. at 5903-04 (Walsh).  Plaintiff’s psychology experts did not collect or \norganize data to support any of their allegations and looked at no outcomes before forming their \nopinions. Tr. at 5808, 5931 (Walsh).  As Plaintiff’s medical expert Dr. Mikkelsen testified, it is \nthe outcomes that really let you judge whether or not the standard of care is being met.  Tr. at \n3799 (Mikkelsen).  Plaintiff’s experts, Drs. Matson and Manikam, looked almost exclusively at \nprocesses at CHDC, rather than outcomes. Tr. at 5809 (Walsh).  Plaintiff’s experts also unfairly \nplaced added emphasis on treatment fidelity measures in CHDC’s behavior plans because of \ntheir narrow academic backgrounds. Tr. at 5825 (Walsh). \nDespite Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson’s, academic title, his review of records and data \nfrom CHDC was beyond careless, and demonstrated no intent to be scientific. Tr. at 4241 \n(Kastner), 5893 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson, showed no intent to be objective in his review of CHDC. \nTr. at 5893 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson did not review a sample of CHDC residents and did not even \nfinish reviewing the records that he started to review. Tr. at 5894 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson did not \n  158\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 159 of 383\neven comply with the general standards that he claims should exist for data collection at CHDC. \nTr. at 4242 (Kastner).  Instead, Dr. Matson looked narrowly at CHDC to find things to criticize. \nTr. at 5894 (Walsh).   \nAmong other things, Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson, cited a study of self-injurious \nbehavior to suggest that CHDC’s rate of self-injurious behavior was unusually high, but that \nstudy is not a useful comparison because there are studies that are much more representative of \nthe population at CHDC. Tr. at 5917 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson’s reliance on that study was \ndisingenuous because the abstract of the study cited by Dr. Matson expressly made clear that the \nrates of self-injurious behavior are much lower in community settings compared to large \nICF/MR settings, given the types of people that are served in the respective settings. Tr. at 5917 \n(Walsh).  Dr. Matson’s representation of a study of aggressive behavior was even more \nmisleading because he compared CHDC to what he claimed was a statistic of 9.8% for physical \naggression, but that study actually said that the 9.8% percent figure was for sexually aggressive \nbehavior, not generally aggressive behavior. Tr. at 5918 (Walsh).  In that same article, the rate \nfor physical aggression is actually identified as 24.4%. Tr. at 5918 (Walsh). \nRather than selecting a representative sample of CHDC residents, at his deposition, Dr. \nMatson testified that the individuals he reviewed were selected at random, so he assumed they \nwere representative. Tr. at 5895 (Walsh).  At trial, Dr. Matson did not even believe he drew a \nrepresentative sample of CHDC residents for his review. Tr. at 1206-09 (Matson).  He also \nclaimed to not know whether there were incorrect name transcriptions on his lists, although that \nfact was noted in Defendants’ expert report months before trial.  Tr. at 1206-1209 (Matson).  \nPlaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson, was utterly careless in his review of CHDC. Tr. at 5900 (Walsh).  \nDr. Matson can not make statements about the entire CHDC population because he did not take \n  159\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 160 of 383\nany sort of reasonable scientific approach in his work. Tr. at 5902 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson’s sample \nwas not representative of CHDC with respect to gender, clinical team membership, level of \nintellectual disability, ambulation status, fragile health, aggressive, destructive, or self-injurious \nbehaviors in behavior plans. Tr. at 5895 (Walsh).  In some instances, Dr. Matson’s sample was \nnearly the reverse of the actual CHDC population. Tr. at 5895 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson oversampled \npeople with severe behavioral problems and severe disabilities, but undersampled residents with \nprofound disabilities. Tr. at 5895 (Walsh).  Any conclusions drawn from Dr. Matson’s sample \ncannot be applied to the rest of the CHDC population. Tr. at 5896 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson appeared \nto observe instances on his tours and then go to the records to support his opinions, which is the \nreverse of the way objective research is done. Tr. at 5894 (Walsh).   \nThere were other fundamental flaws in the way that Dr. Matson approached his review of \nCHDC. Tr. at 5902 (Walsh).  For example, Dr. Matson misapprehended how behavior plans and \nrestraints are used at CHDC. Tr. at 5901 (Walsh).  He did not use the data available to him from \nCHDC in any quantifiable way. Tr. at 5902 (Walsh).  And he did not generate data from his \nreview of CHDC. Tr. at 5902 (Walsh).  Although Dr. Matson claimed he reviewed all 510 Quick \nReference Guides at CHDC, he provided no critical content for having supposedly reviewed so \nmuch material. Tr. at 5903 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson also failed to specify which type of behavior \nplans he reviewed for which CHDC residents. Tr. at 5896 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson created charts in \nhis report that were not constructed in any sensible way. Tr. at 5897 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson did not \ntabulate information he claimed to have gleaned from CHDC behavior plans in any way that \nmade sense and he did not identify any data coming out of them. Tr. at 5897 (Walsh).  Dr. \nMatson’s opinions were all unsupported or supported only by a biased selection of CHDC \nresidents. Tr. at 5897 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson tended to look for problems at CHDC and then \n  160\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 161 of 383\ngravitate toward them to support his opinions. Tr. at 5897 (Walsh).  As evidence of his sloppy \nresearch, in one of Dr. Matson’s charts he identified one of CHDC’s psychological examiners as \none of the residents, leading one to lack confidence in Dr. Matson’s analysis. Tr. at 5897 \n(Walsh).  In another of Dr. Matson’s charts he incorrectly identified the first names of at least six \nor seven CHDC residents, further leading one to lack confidence in Dr. Matson’s analysis. Tr. at \n5898 (Walsh).  At a minimum, Dr. Matson’s, lack of methodology affected his findings. Tr. at \n5902 (Walsh). \n  Further evidence of Dr. Matson’s limited credibility was revealed when he confused \nmicrocephaly with hydrocephaly and colloquially identified the former as “water on the brain.” \nTr. at 5883 (Walsh).  Microcephaly is a person with a small circumference of the head. Tr. at \n5884 (Walsh). \nOf critical importance, Dr. Matson also confused functional behavior assessment with the \noverall comprehensive functional assessment required by the ICF/MR regulations. Tr. at 6091 \n(Walsh).  The ICF/MR standards do not include functional behavior assessment, but rather \ninclude an overall comprehensive functional assessment that is interdisciplinary in nature, done \nwithin 30 days of admission, and then annually updated thereafter, which is quite different than a \nfunctional behavior assessment. Tr. at 6091 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson’s emphasis on cognitive \ntesting seems to have come from a similar misunderstanding of the ICF/MR regulations. Tr. \n5876-77 (Walsh).  Cognitive assessment is not a big part of what psychological examiners do at \nCHDC because all of the residents at CHDC had to have already had cognitive assessments by a \npsychologist in order to have been admitted to CHDC. Tr. at 5877 (Walsh). \nDr. Matson’s incomplete review of records also directly impacted his findings.  Dr. \nMatson erroneously indicated that the behavior plans for TH had no behavior function identified \n  161\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 162 of 383\nand no replacement behaviors identified. Tr. at 5899 (Walsh).  TH’s behavior plans clearly \nidentify behavior functions and replacement behaviors, contrary to Dr. Matson’s claim. Tr. at \n5899 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson did an incomplete or inaccurate review of TH’s records, leading one \nto conclude that Dr. Matson’s overall conclusions are not trustworthy. Tr. at 5899 (Walsh).  In \nthe case of ZS, Dr. Matson erroneously indicated that ZS’s behavior plans had no replacement \nbehaviors, leading one to conclude that Dr. Matson’s overall conclusions are not trustworthy. Tr. \nat 5900 (Walsh).  ZS’s behavior plans identified multiple replacement behaviors, including \nplaying with toys, building things, and taking objects apart, contrary to Dr. Matson’s claim. Tr. \nat 5900 (Walsh).  In the case of ACJ, Dr. Matson erroneously indicated that ACJ’s behavior \nplans had no replacement behaviors, further leading one to conclude that Dr. Matson’s overall \nconclusions are not trustworthy. Tr. at 5900 (Walsh).  ACJ’s behavior plans specifically stated \n“appropriate behaviors for ACJ include remaining calm,” and then list a number of other \nbehaviors, contrary to Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson’s claim. Tr. at 5900 (Walsh). \nSimilarly, Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Manikam, was not a reliable witness.  Dr. Manikam \nreviewed IPPs for only 20 CHDC residents, which is a 3.9% sample, too small to draw any \nconclusions. Tr. at 5923 (Walsh).  Further, all of the information Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Manikam, \nrecommended to be included in CHDC’s IPPs is already in those IPPs. Tr. at 5923-25 (Walsh).  \nDr. Manikam falsely indicated in his report that he reviewed 74 behavior intervention plans. Tr. \nat 5920 (Walsh).  Adding up the number of documents that Dr. Manikam loosely described as \nplans and claimed he reviewed, there are only 54 documents, not 74, as he indicated. Tr. at 5920 \n(Walsh).  The plans that Dr. Manikam claimed to have reviewed represented only 46 CHDC \nresidents. Tr. at 5920 (Walsh).  Dr. Manikam also inconsistently stated in his report that there \nwere 41 types of restraints used at CHDC and then later indicated that there were only 13 types \n  162\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 163 of 383\nof restraints. Tr. at 5918 (Walsh).  Based on his testimony, Dr. Manikam also seems to not \nunderstand what the ICF/MR regulation permit relative to programmed use of restraints. Tr. at \n5855 (Walsh). \nThe positive behavior support movement advocated by Dr. Manikam is described by \nleading behavioral psychologists as “a utopian delusion.” Tr. at 5922 (Walsh).  That movement, \nfor which Dr. Manikam seems to advocate, is not a standard in the field of psychology. Tr. at \n5922, 5923 (Walsh).  Plaintiff’s own expert, Dr. Matson, acknowledged that there is \ndisagreement within the field of behavioral psychology as to the validity of the positive behavior \nsupport movement advocated for by Dr. Manikam. Tr. at 5922 (Walsh).  Some leading \nbehavioral psychologists have concluded that the positive behavior support movement for which \nDr. Manikam seems to advocate has done damage to the field of applied behavior analysis. Tr. at \n5923 (Walsh).   \na.  EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE \nEvidence-based practice in psychology is a new theory of practice. Tr. at 4266 (Kastner), \n5887 (Walsh).  The American Psychological Association adopted a resolution in 2005 to start \nlooking at evidence-based practice, so it is disingenuous to criticize CHDC in 2009 for not \nhaving evidence-based practice in their psychology department. Tr. at 5887 (Walsh).  There is \ncurrently no evidence base, or only a very limited evidence base, on which to base a practice like \nthe psychology department at CHDC, so CHDC cannot be expected to employ evidence-based \npractice in the way Plaintiff’s expert has suggested. Tr. at 5887-88 (Walsh). \nContemporary academic literature maintains that psychologists structure their practices \nbased on their experience, not on evidence-based practice because there has been no evidence-\nbased practice that has been properly vetted in the field of psychology and developmental \n  163\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 164 of 383\ndisabilities. Tr. at 5889 (Walsh).  Evidence-based practice for psychological examiners at CHDC \nwould not involve a review of literature and attempt to directly apply that material to their \npractices. Tr. at 5889 (Walsh).  There is no evidence-based practice standard that CHDC \npsychological examiners could go to and say that is how they are going to carry out their \npractice. Tr. at 5889 (Walsh). \nPlaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson, cited no evidence-based standards in his report or \ntestimony. Tr. at 5890 (Walsh).  Dr. Matson’s suggestion that CHDC psychological examiners \nshould read the evidence from academic literature and attempt to incorporate it as they see fit is \nnaïve and that suggestion shows an absence of empirical evaluation as to whether that would \nwork or achieve positive outcomes. Tr. at 5890 (Walsh).  Reliance on journal articles is not an \nappropriate way to describe evidence-based practice as a standard. Tr. at 4266 (Kastner), 6060 \n(Walsh).  Most peer-reviewed academic publications do not contain any treatment fidelity \nmeasures, so it is not likely that any day-to-day programs have treatment fidelity measures and \nnone of Plaintiff’s witnesses offered any evidence of such programs. Tr. at 5893 (Walsh). \n \nb.  BEHAVIOR INTERVENTION COMMITTEE IS NOT \nNECESSARY AT CHDC \n \nAt trial, Plaintiff’s, expert Dr. Matson, suggested that CHDC should have a “Behavior \nIntervention Committee,” and although some states’ do require a specific committee with that \nname, that type of committee is not required by Arkansas law, CMS regulations, or any \nprofessional standards. Tr. at 1189-90, 1270-71, 4207, 5850.  Nevertheless, the CHDC \npsychology department peer review committee serves the same function as the behavior \nintervention committee recommended by plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson. Tr. at 5851.   \n  164\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 165 of 383\nThe CHDC psychology department peer review committee serves as a professional \nreview of the behavior plans and brings all of the psychological examiners together as a collegial \ngroup to discuss ideas and proposals. Tr. at 5852.  The CHDC psychology department peer \nreview committee is governed by policy. Defendants’ Exhibit 910, Tr. at 5850, 5851.  The \ncommittee meets on a regular basis, maintains meeting minutes, and conducts regular \npresentations on a monthly basis. Tr. at 5851.  Since its inception, the committee has reviewed \nCHDC residents’ cases involving self-injurious behavior, aggression, pica, feces smearing, \ntantrums, refusal, and many other behaviors. Tr. at 5852.  The CHDC psychology department \npeer review committee exceeds professional standards and meets any substantive suggestion by \nPlaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson. Tr. at 5850. \n \nc.  PSYCHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSES - TREATING \nPROFESSIONAL’S RELIANCE ON DIAGNOSTIC \nMANUALS \n \nThe only diagnosis in the DSM-IV-TR that involves any kind of psychological test is \nmental retardation. Tr. at 1219, 1220, 2035 (Matson, Reddig).  Scales and tests are not necessary \nin making any other diagnosis from the DSM-IV-TR. Tr. at 2040 (Reddig).  All other diagnoses \nin the DSM-IV-TR are based on how people behave and what people report, so using the DSM-\nIV-TR for diagnosing people with severe and profound developmental disabilities can be \nextremely difficult. 2035, 5882 (Reddig, Walsh).  People with severe and profound \ndevelopmental disabilities express themselves in very different ways than a practitioner finds in \nthe DSM-IV-TR because the DSM-IV-TR relies on what patients report.  Tr. at 2033 (Reddig).  \nThe vast majority of CHDC residents can not report their symptoms and do not express \nthemselves in ways typically identified in the DSM-IV-TR. Tr. at 2033 (Reddig). \n  165\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 166 of 383\nPlaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson, agreed that it is not always possible to get a clear diagnosis \nfrom the DSM-IV-TR. Tr. at 1223 (Matson).  Dr. Matson agreed that diagnosing some behaviors \ndoes not require a standardized mental health assessment and could be discerned through \nobservation. Tr. at 1237 (Matson).  In fact, Dr. Matson has reported in publications that the best \nway to determine if a psychiatric diagnosis exists for someone with mental retardation is through \nobservation. Tr. at 6683 (Glenn).  Although he did not necessarily agree with it, Dr. Matson \nacknowledged that there are peer reviewed publications that have concluded that the DSM-IV-\nTR’s layout of disorders does not work for patients with developmental disabilities.  Tr. 1220-\n1222 (Matson).  Because some professionals maintain that the DSM-IV-TR does not sufficiently \ndiagnose individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, efforts have been made to \ndevelop alternative diagnostic systems for use with those patients.  Tr. at 1222, 1223 (Matson).  \nThe Diagnostic Manual for People with Intellectual Disabilities (“DM-ID”) is an attempt to \nadapt the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual categories to people with developmental disabilities. \nTr. at 5882 (Walsh).  When attempting to apply it to the severely or profoundly disabled, \nhowever, a practitioner has the same problems using the DM-ID that he has using the DSM-IV-\nTR because the only adjustments in diagnostic criteria in the DM-ID have been made vis-a-vis \nmildly and moderately disabled individuals. Tr. at 5883 (Walsh). \n \n10. DEFENDANTS’ EXPERT, DR. KEVIN WALSH \nDefendants’ expert, Dr. Kevin Walsh, is a psychologist and the Director of Quality \nManagement and Research for Developmental Disabilities Health Alliance, Inc. (“DDHA”). Tr. \nat 5782-93 (Walsh), Def. Ex. 92-A.  Based on education and experience, Dr. Walsh, is an expert \nin the provision of psychological services, management of services for developmentally disabled \n  166\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 167 of 383\npeople, and the provision of community based services for developmentally disabled people. Tr. \nat 5782-93 (Walsh), Def. Ex. 92-A. \nDDHA, the organization for which Dr. Walsh is the Director of Quality Management and \nResearch, provides community based health care, including in-home behavioral supports, and \nrelated services to individuals throughout New Jersey and has been one of the largest, if not the \nlargest, provider of community-based specialized primary health care to individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities in the country, providing services to approximately 3,000 individuals \nand care management to approximately 4,500 individuals. Tr. at 5782-93, 5801 (Walsh), Def. \nEx. 92-A.   DDHA focuses exclusively on providing services for developmentally disabled \nindividuals living in community settings. Tr. at 5802 (Walsh).  The organization regularly \ndevelops habilitation programs, in-home behavioral supports, behavior plans, and individual \nplans for its clients. Tr. at 6037 (Walsh).  It also operates an in-home behavioral support \nprograms for school-aged children. Tr. at 6038 (Walsh).   \nAmong other things, in his position as Director of Quality Management and Research for \nDDHA, Dr. Walsh does direct care staff training on the program plans developed by DDHA. Tr. \nat 6039 (Walsh).  As part of his current work at DDHA, Dr. Walsh also develops training \nmanuals and systems for DDHA on behavioral management, community services, professional \nsupport, and quality management. Tr. at 5792, (Walsh), Def. Ex. 92-A. \nDr. Walsh has more than a decade of experience working in state operated institutional \nsettings and has extensive experience in consultation with state-operated facilities. Tr. at 5782-\n93, (Walsh), Def. Ex. 92-A.   Until recently, Dr. Walsh was licensed as a clinical psychologist, \nbut opted not to renew that license because his current practice focuses on research, policy, and \nsystem management as they relate to psychological and other services for the developmentally \n  167\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 168 of 383\ndisabled. Tr. at 5783 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh has published over 50 peer-reviewed publications, \nincluding publications on clinical psychology, systems, and policy issues. Tr. at 5784 (Walsh).  \nHe is an associate editor of the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental \nDisabilities, requiring him to make decisions on acceptance or rejection of publications, manage \nthe peer-review process, manage reviewers, and edit manuscripts that are submitted to the \njournal. Tr. at 5784-85 (Walsh). \nDr. Walsh has been on his county ARC for approximately 19 years and president of that \norganization for 14 years. Tr. at 5785 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh has been on the executive committee \nof the board of the ARC of New Jersey for approximately 15 years. Tr. at 5785-86 (Walsh).  \nARC, formerly known as the Association for Retarded Citizens, promotes community based \nservices for the developmentally disabled. Tr. at 5786 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh’s county ARC is a \nservice provider, providing support services, supportive living, and supportive work in \ncommunity based settings. Tr. at 5786 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh also serves on the ARC’s mainstream \nmedical care board and advisory board. Tr. at 5786 (Walsh).  In the past, Dr. Walsh has been \ninvolved with several work groups to study issues of long-term care and aging. Tr. at 5788 \n(Walsh). \nDr. Walsh also serves on the state level behavior review committee for the state of New \nJersey, which is the committee that develops behavioral policy for the state and reviews \nproposals from service providers. Tr. at 5786-87 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh also serves on New \nJersey’s state level interdisciplinary research committee, which reviews any research proposals \nthat are put forward that will include any developmentally disabled New Jersey residents as \nsubjects. Tr. at 5787 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh is also on the restraint working group for the state of \nNew Jersey, which has been rewriting the states policies on restraints for several years. Tr. at \n  168\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 169 of 383\n5787-88 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh also serves on the New Jersey Olmstead Oversight Committee as a \nmember of the quality work group, which was established by the state to oversee the state’s \ndecision to move residents from developmental centers in conjunction with the state’s Olmstead \nplan. Tr. at 5788 (Walsh). \nAmong other positions that he has held, Dr. Walsh was the Director of Psychology at the \nTraining School at Vineland, which was a residential facility with more than 250 residents. Tr. at \n5789 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh’s work at the Vineland facility included developing a package of non-\naversive physical holds to replace the facility’s disjointed restraint techniques. Tr. at 5790 \n(Walsh).  The program developed by Dr. Walsh at Vineland in the early 1980s is still used there, \nand since that time it has also been used to train people working with the developmentally \ndisabled in community settings. Tr. at 5791 (Walsh).  Since its inception, over 15,000 direct care \nstaff and 500 trainers, in small and large residential settings, have been trained on that program. \nTr. at 5791 (Walsh).  That training program uses some video training and is competency based. \nTr. at 5791 (Walsh). \nDr. Walsh initially became involved with CHDC in 2003, subsequent to a visit from the \nDepartment of Justice. Tr. at 5792 (Walsh).  In 2003, Dr. Walsh observed that CHDC had higher \nnumbers of restraints that it currently has. Tr. at 5792 (Walsh).  In 2003, Dr. Walsh \nacknowledged that CHDC’s documentation and management of restraints could be improved and \nhe made recommendations for CHDC to accomplish that. Tr. at 5792-93 (Walsh).  In 2005, Dr. \nWalsh reviewed services at CHDC again and made additional recommendations to CHDC for \neven further improvements. Tr. at 5793 (Walsh).  In 2008, Dr. Walsh worked directly with \nCHDC’s Chief of Psychology, Dr. Reddig, to formulate the behavior plans, the positive behavior \nsupport plans, strategy plans, and safety plans, which are presently in use at CHDC. Tr. at 5793 \n  169\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 170 of 383\n(Walsh).  Dr. Reddig and CHDC personnel developed the forms, documentation, and details \nassociated with the current behavior plans and Dr. Walsh reviewed those materials after they \nwere developed by Dr. Reddig and CHDC personnel. Tr. at 5793 (Walsh).  The behavior plans at \nCHDC were structured to be coordinated with the use and reduction of planned restraints. Tr. at \n5793 (Walsh). \n \n11. DR. WALSH’S METHODOLOGY \nPrior to writing his rebuttal report in this matter, Dr. Walsh toured CHDC in September \n2009 for four days and in March 2010 for three days. Tr. at 5800 (Walsh).  In preparation for his \nreport in this matter, Dr. Walsh collected data and information from which he could extract data, \nincluding policies, procedures, and interviews. Tr. at 5800 (Walsh).  In particular, Dr. Walsh \ngathered data on restraint numbers, human rights committee records, incident reports, and \nstatistical incident reports in preparation for his report. Tr. at 5801 (Walsh).  Based on \nundisputed information provided from CHDC to Dr. Walsh, Dr. Walsh used the number 503 as \nthe total population of residents at CHDC, which he relied on in calculating percentages relative \nto CHDC’s total census. Tr. at 5809 (Walsh).  Among other things, Dr. Walsh did a behavior \nmanagement review of CHDC from 2009-2010, which included taking a randomized, stratified, \nrepresentative sample of CHDC residents who are on behavioral strategies. Tr. at 5802-03 \n(Walsh). \nThe behavioral strategies reviewed by Dr. Walsh are called “Safety Plans” at CHDC and \nare the psychology department plans for residents who have some kind of restrictive element \nwritten into their program plans. Tr. at 5803 (Walsh).  At the time of Dr. Walsh’s review in \nSeptember 2009, he was provided a list of all CHDC residents who had Safety Plans. Tr. at 5803 \n  170\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 171 of 383\n(Walsh).  At that time, there were 99 CHDC residents with Safety Plans. Tr. at 5803 (Walsh).  \nThose 99 CHDC residents became the basis for Dr. Walsh’s randomized, stratified, \nrepresentative sample. Tr. at 5803 (Walsh). \nIn his review of behavior plans at CHDC, Dr. Walsh’s intention was to characterize the \nbehavior plans and their outcomes for the people who were on behavior plans. Tr. at 5803-04 \n(Walsh).  Among the people who were on safety plans at CHDC at the time of Dr. Walsh’s \nreview, he randomly selected thirty of those people. Tr. at 5804 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh’s random \nselection of CHDC Safety Plans was generated from a random number of tables using an Excel \nspreadsheet. Tr. at 5804 (Walsh).  If a randomly selected Safety Plan for a CHDC resident had a \nrelated Positive Behavior Support Plan or Strategy Plan, Dr. Walsh also reviewed those related \nplans for the respective CHDC resident. Tr. at 5804 (Walsh). \nIn addition to the thirty Safety Plans Dr. Walsh reviewed, seven of those plan had \nPositive Behavior Support Plans associated and the other twenty-three Safety Plans had Strategy \nPlans associated with them. Tr. at 5804 (Walsh).  In his review of behavior plans at CHDC, Dr. \nWalsh reviewed a total of sixty plans for thirty CHDC residents, comprised of thirty Safety \nPlans, seven Positive Behavior Support Plans, and twenty-three Safety Plans. Tr. at 5804 \n(Walsh).  The thirty people, who’s behavior plans Dr. Walsh reviewed, represented a thirty \npercent sample of the people at CHDC who had safety plans. Tr. at 5804 (Walsh).  The sample \nof CHDC residents who’s Safety Plans Dr. Walsh reviewed was a random sample representative \nof CHDC residents who had Safety Plans. Tr. at 5804 (Walsh). \nTo make the representation of the population even more reliable, Dr. Walsh used a \nstratification system in which he built a sampling frame using age, unit, and intellectual disability \nlevel to stratify his sample. Tr. at 5804 (Walsh).  The importance of stratification in sampling is \n  171\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 172 of 383\nthat it makes the sample more representative and makes it truly scientific. Tr. at 5805 (Walsh).  \nLarge sampling organizations, like the Gallup organization, are able to use stratified random \nsampling of only 2,000 people to predict how 300 million voters will vote. Tr. at 5805 (Walsh). \nDr. Walsh’s stratification of the age of CHDC residents was three groups, under the age \nof twenty-two, ages twenty-two to fifty, and over the age of fifty. Tr. at 5805 (Walsh).  Dr. \nWalsh also stratified the CHDC residents, who’s plans he reviewed, into two groups, based on \nthe severity of their intellectual disability, “mild and moderate,” and “severe and profound.” Tr. \nat 5805 (Walsh).  In identifying his sample, Dr. Walsh also noted the CHDC residence for each \nof the individuals he reviewed. Tr. at 5805 (Walsh). \nDr. Walsh’s sample included seven CHDC residents who were under twenty-two, sixteen \nwho were aged twenty-two to fifty, and seven who were over fifty. Tr. at 5806 (Walsh).  Dr. \nWalsh’s random, stratified, and representative sample of CHDC residents was further validated \nby his sample containing approximately the same age distribution, level of disability, and \nresidence location as the entire CHDC population. Tr. at 5806 (Walsh).  The reason Dr. Walsh \nidentified a random, stratified, and representative sample was because it was critical for him to \nbe able to look at those 30 people and for whatever he found for those 30 people, also be able to \nconclude that those findings applied to all CHDC residents with Safety Plans. Tr. at 5806 \n(Walsh). \nDr. Walsh’s evaluation of CHDC’s quality included an analysis of structure, process, and \noutcomes. Tr. at 5808 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh’s analysis of the processes at CHDC included how \nthings were done generally and how plans were written and approved in particular. Tr. at 5809 \n(Walsh).  Dr. Walsh’s analysis of CHDC was markedly more representative compared to \nPlaintiff’s experts, who looked almost exclusively at processes at CHDC, rather than outcomes. \n  172\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 173 of 383\nTr. at 5809 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh’s analysis of the outcomes at CHDC included what was really \nhappening at CHDC, as opposed to what Plaintiff’s experts’ assumed was happening based on \ntheir interpretations of CHDC processes. Tr. at 5809 (Walsh). \nRegarding standards, based on his extensive experience and education in the fields of \npsychology, quality, research, management, and community based services for the \ndevelopmentally disabled, Dr. Walsh testified that the ICF/MR standards are the relevant \nstandards of care for CHDC. Tr. at 6059 (Walsh).  He testified further that reliance on journal \narticles is not an appropriate way to define professional standards. Tr. at 6060 (Walsh). \n \n12. FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENTS \nFunctional behavior assessments are not common in settings like CHDC and are not \nrequired by ICF/MR regulations or professional standards. Tr. at 6092 (Walsh).  Research studies \nshow that it is not possible to discern function for approximately five to seven percent of \nindividuals like the residents of CHDC because their behavior is not clear. Tr. at 5846 (Walsh).  \nEfforts to conduct functional assessments in applied settings are only recently becoming more \ncommon. Tr. at 5794 (Walsh).  No body of standards requires functional behavior assessments \nbe conducted at CHDC. Tr. at 6092 (Walsh).  Nevertheless, CHDC has made significant \nimprovements in recent years in doing functional assessments for CHDC residents. Tr. at 5829-\n30 (Walsh).   \nCHDC’s Psychology staff are responsible for intellectual and functional assessments at \nCHDC.  Tr. at 1956 (Reddig).  All CHDC residents have had functional assessments conducted \nby licensed psychological examiners. Tr. at 5919 (Walsh).  CHDC psychological examiners \nmake professional judgments about whether and how to use the CHDC functional assessment \n  173\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 174 of 383\nworksheet in assessing CHDC residents. Tr. at 1776, 1959, 5794 (Adams, Reddig, Walsh).  A \nfunctional assessment is done at CHDC in order to identify and assess what function a problem \nbehavior serves for a person and, in turn, offset the need for the problematic behavior by \naddressing that function in another way. Tr. at 1776, 5794 (Adams, Walsh).  Some CHDC \npsychological examiners use the CHDC functional assessment worksheet in conjunction with an \nindirect commercial scale. Tr. at 1776, 5838 (Adams, Walsh).  For example, Ms. Glenn uses \nCHDC’s functional assessment worksheet in conjunction with commercially available functional \nscales such as the Motivation Assessment Scale, which, when used together, rate the behavior \nand give her information about the function of the behavior, antecedent conditions, and the \nsetting in which the behavior is occurring.  Tr. at 6681 (Glenn).  CHDC psychological examiners \nalso use the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale when they deem it appropriate. Tr. at 1774 \n(Adams).  Any CHDC psychological examiner can use the Motivation Assessment Scale or any \nother commercial assessment scale if they believe it will be useful for a particular resident on \ntheir caseload.  Tr. at 1968 (Reddig). \nWhen completing a functional assessment for an individual, the psychology department \nat CHDC interviews direct care staff that work with the resident as well as the parent or guardian \nof the resident to obtain information that only people who interact with the resident everyday \nwould know. Tr. at 6567 (Preist).  Psychological examiners also conduct direct observation when \ncompleting a functional assessment to see how the individual interacts with others and reacts to \ncertain situations. Tr. at 5919, 6568 (Walsh, Priest).  Psychological examiners always use \nprofessional judgment when conducting a functional assessment. Tr. at 6570 (Priest).  For \nexample, in preparation for completing a functional assessment, Mr. Priest will create a scatter \nplot of behaviors and list out when the behavior occurred, where it occurred, what the staff \n  174\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 175 of 383\nthought the individual was trying to accomplish with the behavior and what type of behavior was \nexhibited, in order to determine the true reason for the behavior and capture any trends or \npatterns. Tr. at 6570 (Priest).  Some psychological examiners, like Mr. Priest, have over 20 years \nof experience working with the same residents at CHDC, which allows them to assess what the \nfunction of that person’s behavior is in conjunction with the functional assessment worksheet. \nTr. at 1960, 2094 (Reddig).   \nA functional assessment worksheet is used anytime psychological examiners develop \nbehavior programming, including any behavior plans. Tr. at 6673 (Glenn), Def. Ex. 460.  The \nfunctional assessment tells CHDC professional staff why a person is exhibiting a certain \nbehavior and what function the behavior serves for that person. Tr. at 6673 (Glenn).  After the \nfunctional assessment is done by the psychological examiner, the team members meet to discuss \nthe function of the resident’s behavior, what the staff can do to change the situation, and improve \nor change the behavior. Tr. at 6677 (Glenn).  Once the team has discussed the results of the \nfunctional assessment, the information obtained from the assessment and the meeting is used to \ndevelop a behavior plan. Tr. at 6677 (Glenn).  CHDC’s functional assessments also serve to \nimprove the lives of CHDC residents.  CHDC collects data on the problems that they are trying \nto improve and the skills that they are trying to teach to the individual. Tr. at 6581 (Priest).  \nCHDC psychological examiners couple this approach with observation which allows them to \ndetermine things such as whether someone is happier, more content with their life, or smiling \nmore. Tr. at 6581 (Glenn).  The effectiveness of the functional assessments is proven through the \ndata collected from the observations. Tr. at 6581 (Glenn). \nFor CHDC residents under the age of twenty-two, functional assessments are also used in \nconjunction with their educational services.  Professionals in CHDC’s education department are \n  175\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 176 of 383\nwell informed about functional assessments including how they are completed and how they can \nbe used by the education department. Tr. at 6485, 6486 (Priest).  Special education teachers at \nCHDC also use functional assessments to identify a particular antecedent to a behavior and \nunderstand why that behavior occurs. Tr. at 6485, 6486 (Priest).  Special education teachers at \nCHDC use the information contained in the functional assessments, such as antecedents to \nbehavior, and behavior plans to reduce the number of incidents of behavior before they occur.  \nTr. at 6486 (Priest).  The special education department and the psychology department have an \nopen line of communication regarding behavior plans and functional assessments. Tr. at 6487 \n(Priest). \n \na.  CHDC’S FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENTS EXCEED \nPROFESSIONAL STANDARDS \n \nThe CHDC functional behavior assessment worksheet meets generally acceptable \nprofessional standards in the field of psychology and CHDC psychological examiners are doing \nprofessionally accepted functional assessments. Tr. at 5837, 6677 (Walsh, Glenn).  Although he \ndid not conduct a scientific review of CHDC’s records, even Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Manikam \nadmitted that CHDC psychological examiners did functional assessments and he rated some of \nthose functional assessments as excellent. Tr. at 5837-38 (Walsh).  Dr. Manikam agreed that all \nof the functional assessments at CHDC he reviewed included many of the necessary components \nrequired for adequacy.  Tr. at 3206, 3207 (Manikam). \nDr. Walsh separately rated the functional assessment sections of the CHDC behavior \nplans he reviewed. Tr. at 5818 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh’s analyzed the functional assessments by \nCHDC psychological examiners as a separate component of his analysis of the CHDC behavior \nplans. Tr. at 5817-18 (Walsh).  For approximately thirteen percent of the CHDC residents, whose \n  176\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 177 of 383\nbehavior plans Dr. Walsh reviewed, the use of an indirect commercial scale for functional \nassessment was used, specifically the motivational assessment scale. Tr. at 5828 (Walsh).  For \napproximately sixty-three percent of the CHDC residents, whose behavior plans Dr. Walsh \nreviewed, the CHDC functional analysis worksheet was used. Tr. at 5828 (Walsh).  For \napproximately twenty percent of the CHDC residents, whose behavior plans Dr. Walsh \nreviewed, some form of functional assessment was done other than an indirect commercial scale \nor the CHDC functional analysis worksheet. Tr. at 5828 (Walsh).  For approximately ninety-\nseven percent of the CHDC residents, whose behavior plans Dr. Walsh reviewed, the \npsychological examiner included information from interviews with staff or others in the \nfunctional assessment. Tr. at 5828 (Walsh). \nAll of the CHDC behavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh included direct observations of \nthe CHDC resident for whom the plan was created. Tr. at 5829 (Walsh).  Sixty percent of the \nCHDC behavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh included information from other records of the \nCHDC resident. Tr. at 5829 (Walsh).  All of the CHDC behavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh \nincluded some function or hypothesized function for behavior. Tr. at 5829 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh \nrated most of the functional assessment in the CHDC behavior plans as average or good. Tr. at \n5829 (Walsh). \nb.  PLAINTIFF’S EXPERTS’ BASELESS \nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC \nFUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT METHODS \n \nFunctional assessment techniques are assessments of an individual’s behavior as opposed \nto experimentally analyzing it. Tr. at 5835 (Walsh).  Functional assessments may be in the form \nof indirect functional assessments, also known as non-experimental functional analysis, which \ninclude things like questionnaires given to staff. Tr. at 5835 (Walsh).  Functional assessments \n  177\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 178 of 383\nmay also be in the form of direct functional assessments, such as the CHDC functional \nassessment form, which is also called a descriptive form. Tr. at 5836 (Walsh).  If the CHDC \nfunctional assessment form is deconstructed, it includes staff interviews, direct observations, \ncontingency analysis, and antecedent, behavior, consequence analysis, communication analysis. \nTr. at 5836 (Walsh).  Indirect functional assessments and descriptive tools, like the one \npredominantly used at CHDC are both secondary measures and treated in professional literature \nas equivalents. Tr. at 5837 (Walsh). \nPlaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson, proposed that CHDC psychological examiners do more \nexperimental functional analysis. Tr. at 1008-09, 1205 (Matson).  As an initial matter, CHDC \npsychological examiners are all licensed professionals, who have the right to practice their \nprofession within the bounds of their license, which may include non-behaviorist psychology. Tr. \nat 5835 (Walsh).  Non-behaviorists may not want to set up anything like the experimental \nfunctional analysis proposed by Dr. Matson and deferring to their professional judgment would \nrequire one to respect that decision. Tr. at 5835 (Walsh). \nCHDC does not use applied behavior analysis because it is more conducive to a research \nenvironment rather than a treatment environment. Tr. at 6571 (Priest).  Applied behavior analysis \nrequires a very controlled environment where certain variables can be manipulated in order to \ntest their effect on the target behavior. Tr. at 6571 (Priest).  Applied behavior analysis could \ncause things to be worse for an individual if variables are not manipulated in the right way and \npsychological examiners at CHDC have used their professional judgment to refrain from \npracticing in that fashion with residents’ safety in mind. Tr. at 6580 (Priest). \nFurther, the use of experimental functional analysis proposed by Dr. Matson would \nrequire CHDC residents repeated exposure to negative scenarios in an effort to determine the \n  178\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 179 of 383\nfunction of an individual’s behavior based on his or her reaction to varying scenarios. Tr. at \n5834-35 (Walsh).  Application of that type of experimental functional analysis would subject \nCHDC residents to repeated, negative stimuli in the hope of eventually understanding the \nfunction of a particular behavior. Tr. at 5834-35 (Walsh).  The experimental functional analysis \nproposed by Dr. Matson at CHDC would also be difficult or impossible to set up, resource \nintensive, and has not been used widely in any field of psychology because it is difficult to do. \nTr. at 5834-35 (Walsh).  Although Plaintiff’s experts would not require CHDC psychological \nexaminers to do experimental functional analysis, their suggestion reveals their subjective review \nof services at CHDC. Tr. at 6094-95 (Walsh). \nPlaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson, admitted that his proposed experimental functional \nanalysis is labor intensive and ethically troubling.  Tr. at 1012 (Matson).  Dr. Matson’s \nalternative proposal is for CHDC to use a commercially available tool such as the Motivation \nAssessment Scale, which is already in use at CHDC. Cf. Tr. at 1012, 6681 (Matson, Glenn). All \nof those tools recommended by Dr. Matson derive information entirely on interviews with staff, \nwhich is a component of every functional assessment done by CHDC psychological examiners. \nTr. at 5829 (Walsh). \n \n13. CHDC BEHAVIOR PLANS \nDoing a behavior plan for someone who is severely or profoundly disabled is incredibly \ndifficult for a psychologist because it can be like working in the dark. Tr. at 5845 (Walsh).  \nResearch studies have shown that it is not possible to discern function for approximately five to \nseven percent of individuals like the residents of CHDC because their behavior is not clear. Tr. at \n5846 (Walsh).  CHDC has three types of behavior plans – Safety Plans, Positive Behavior \n  179\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 180 of 383\nSupport Plans, and Strategy Plans . Tr. at 5797 (Walsh).  Behavior plans are developed, written, \nand implemented in a large, team framework at CHDC. Tr. at 5807 (Walsh).  As such, CHDC’s \nbehavior plans form an intercommunication network among staff, directing treatment and goals \nfor CHDC residents. Tr. at 5808 (Walsh).  The behavior plans are one of the sets of tools that \nCHDC psychological examiners use to serve their clients. Tr. at 5798 (Walsh).   \nEach of the CHDC behavior plans – Safety Plans, Positive Behavior Support Plans, and \nStrategy Plans – contains a functional analysis. Tr. at 5797 (Walsh).  The CHDC behavior plans \nmay look similar, but they each have three very distinct and separate functions. Tr. at 5797 \n(Walsh).   \na.  SAFETY PLANS \nIf a CHDC resident requires enhanced supervision or any other service that is considered \nan intrusion on his or her rights, then a CHDC Safety Plan is created. Tr. at 1827, 6562 (Adams, \nPriest).  CHDC Safety Plans are the place where any restraints, planned restraints, or any kind of \nrestrictive procedures, are delineated by the treating professional. Tr. at 5795 (Walsh).  Safety \nPlans necessarily have restrictive procedures in them. Tr. at 5830 (Walsh).  CHDC has three \ntypes of Safety Plans: safety plans with planned restraints, safety plans with personal holds and \nmechanical restraint, and safety plans with planned restrictions. Tr. at 1946 (Reddig).  Any \nCHDC resident with any type of restraint will have a Safety Plan. Tr. at 1827 (Adams).  If a \nSafety Plan is appropriate for an individual at CHDC, there will always be either a strategy or \npositive behavior support plan which accompanies the safety plan. Tr. at 1827 (Adams). \nIf a safety plan has restraints, it is required, under CHDC Policy II D 16, to have a \ncorresponding positive behavior support plan in order to improve the individual’s behavior and \ndecrease the incidents requiring restraint. Tr. at 1827, 1946, 2077, 6485, 6562, (Adams, Reddig, \n  180\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 181 of 383\nBuck, Priest), Def. Ex. 366.  Safety plans and positive behavior support plans may not change \nfrom year to year if success is obtained and no changes are needed. Tr. at 1853 (Adams).  If a \nsafety plan and a positive support plan are implemented on the same exact date, there is an \nexpectation that they will contain similar if not the same information in the section covering the \nhistory of the individual. Tr. at 1854 (Adams).  Safety plans are different from positive behavior \nsupport plans in that they are used only in instances where a person is displaying aggression, self \ninjury or significant property damage which requires some planning as to how to intervene with \nthat behavior. Tr. at 2076-77 (Reddig).  The safety plan is designed to cure the emergency or the \nunsafe behavior and return the person to their regular programming as it is laid out in their \nIndividual Program Plan.  Tr. at 2076-77 (Reddig). \nSafety plans and any corresponding behavior plans go through the interdisciplinary team \nprocess and human rights committee. Tr. at 5004 (Miller).  The interdisciplinary team determines \nwhether a safety plan is needed based on whether the risk of an individual’s behavior is greater \nthan the risk of the safety plan use. Tr. at 1947 (Reddig).  If the team decides that the risk of the \nbehavior is greater, then they explain in the program that the risk of allowing the inappropriate \nbehavior to continue outweighs the risk of the safety plan use. Tr. at 1947 (Reddig).  After they \nare developed and written, those plans go to the CHDC Chief of Psychologist, the physician, the \nguardian, and then to the superintendant for approval. Tr. at 1849, 5004 (Adams, Miller).  Prior \nto Superintendent Price’s approval, on behalf of the Quality Assurance Department, Gail Miller \nreviews the behavior plans for specific components and to ensure that staff will be able to \nunderstand the plans. Tr. at 5004-5008 (Miller).  Ms. Miller reviews the strategy plans and the \npositive behavior support plans to make sure they coincide with the safety plan. Tr. at 5008 \n  181\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 182 of 383\n(Miller).  While reviewing the safety and strategy plans, Ms. Miller keeps in mind the CARF and \nCMS standards. Tr. at 5008 (Miller).   \nEvaluating only a Safety Plan for a CHDC resident will not show all of the behavior \nplanning for that resident. Tr. at 6597 (Priest).  For example, T.S. just completed the taper \ncriteria for discontinuing restraints from his safety plan, but he is still on increased supervision \nand there is a system of levels of reinforcement in his safety plan. Tr. at 6594-96 (Priest).  T.S.’s \npsychological examiner and staff are working with him to teach him the skill of taking \ninstruction because his problems with behavior and tantrums stem from simple requests from \nstaff such as “would you check to see if those clothes are yours?”  Tr. at 6596 (Priest).  His \npsychological examiner has broken up the steps of taking instruction for T.S. Tr. at 6596 (Priest).  \nStaff have taught T.S. to look at the person giving instruction, listen to the instruction, either ask \na question or indicate that you understand, then go do it. Tr. at 6596 (Priest).  That part of T.S.’s \nprogram is properly delineated in his Positive Behavior Support Plan. Tr. at 5697 (Gale).  \nPsychology staff at CHDC are tracking T.S.’s progress with taking instruction and report that he \nhas three months with 100% completion on his training for instructions. Tr. at 6596 (Priest). \n \nb.  POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT PLANS \nCHDC Positive Behavior Support Plans are used to teach residents alternative behavior to \nreplace undesired behavior that has been identified by professionals. Tr. at 1945, 2076, 5795-96 \n(Reddig, Walsh).   The Positive Behavior Support Plans identify the undesired behavior and the \nmotivations behind that behavior. Tr. at 2076, 5795-96 (Reddig, Walsh).  The plans set out \ninstructions to staff on how to implement the program in order to enhance behavior to replace the \nundesired behavior. Tr. at 1945, 2076, 5795-96 (Reddig, Walsh).  They are also used as \n  182\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 183 of 383\nopportunities to expand residents’ skill levels, which can improve their interactions with other \npeople. Tr. at 1945 (Reddig). \nPositive Behavior Support Plans are developed, in part, from the functional assessment of \na resident’s behavior. Tr. at 6550 (Priest).  The CHDC functional assessment worksheet assists \npsychological examiners in analyzing an individual’s behavior and the function that behavior \nserves for the individual. Tr. at 6550 (Priest).  The functional assessment worksheet analyzes \nwhy a resident exhibits a behavior, whether it could be inadvertently reinforced, and what type of \npositive behavior could replace the problem behavior. Tr. at 6550 (Priest).  Before a Positive \nBehavior Plan is implemented there is an extensive approval process where the plan is reviewed \nby the interdisciplinary team, the guardian must review the plan and give his or her consent, the \nchief psychologist must review and approve the plan, then it goes to the individual’s physician \nwho must provide his or her approval at which point it will be sent to the human rights \ncommittee at CHDC and then finally the plan will be submitted to the superintendent, Calvin \nPrice. Tr. at 6564 (Priest).  Once the plan is approved by the relevant parties, the psychological \nexaminers will in-service the direct care staff and train them on proper implementation of the \nplan before the plan will be implemented with the individual. Tr. at 6564 (Priest).  CHDC \npsychological examiners often create a Positive Behavior Support Plan in the absence of restraint \nuse even though it is not required, so that the individual can be trained in a new skill that would \nhelp them to avoid the problem behavior and avoid the need for any restraint. Tr. at 6562 \n(Priest).    \nAn example of programming in a Positive Behavior Support Plan would be if a resident \nis known to get frustrated and toss a table over because he wants a break from what he is doing, \nthe positive behavior support plan would teach that individual the skill of holding up a green card \n  183\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 184 of 383\nthat reads “I need a break” as a replacement behavior, thereby bypassing the potential need for a \nrestraint. Tr. at 6562 (Priest). \n \nc.  STRATEGY FOR IMPROVED BEHAVIOR PLANS \nCHDC Strategy for Improved Behavior Plans are similar to plans in other settings that are \ncalled “behavioral guidelines.” Tr. at 5796 (Walsh).  CHDC Strategy Plans are developed by \npsychological examiners in conjunction with the interdisciplinary team and are used by staff to \naddress behavior that does not rise to a level that requires a positive behavior support plan. Tr. at \n1947 (Reddig).  There is nothing contained in a strategy that involves any intrusion on the \nindividual’s rights. Tr. at 6565 (Priest).  If a resident at CHDC is diagnosed with a psychiatric \ncondition or is taking psychotropic medications, then CHDC psychology department will always \ncreate a Strategy Plan for the individual too. Tr. at 6562, 6564 (Priest).  Strategy Plans identify \npotential problem areas for an individual’s behavior, things that the individual prefers or things \nthat they want to avoid, and directs staff on how to accommodate the individual when those \nsituations present themselves. Tr. at 2077 (Reddig).  Strategy Plans focus on how to more \neffectively interact with a resident and make his or her life more pleasant. Tr. at 2077 (Reddig).  \nThey include data from the previous staffing year so staff and treating professionals have a \ncontext for a resident’s plan. Tr. at 6593 (Priest).  Among other things, Strategy Plans help staff \nto identify signs of tension or anxiety for a resident and suggest ways to make their environment \nless stressful. Tr. at 6565 (Priest). \nFor example, C.S.’s psychological examiner testified that C.S.’s strategy plan advises \nstaff that he can be oppositional and he may try to manipulate staff. Tr. at 6593-94 (Priest).  The \nstrategy for C.S. recommends that staff stay firm with him and be clear when C.S. asks for \n  184\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 185 of 383\nsomething. Tr. at 6594 (Priest).  The strategy plan specifically instructs staff that “maybe” is not \na good response to a question from CS because it is not clear and will likely cause C.S.’s \nbehavior to escalate. Tr. at 6594 (Priest).  C.S.’s strategy plan specifically instructs staff to \nrespond to questions from C.S. with a clear “yes” or “no.” Tr. at 6594 (Priest). \n \nd.  BEHAVIOR PLANS IMPLEMENTED BY CHDC’S \nSPECIAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT \n \nCHDC’s Special Education Department is well informed about the development and use \nof behavior plans for school-aged residents at CHDC. Tr. at 6485, 6486 (Priest).  The CHDC \nSpecial Education Department and the Psychology Department have an open line of \ncommunication regarding behavior plans and functional assessments. Tr. at 6487 (Priest).  \nCHDC special education teachers receive in-service training on each student’s behavior plan \nafter each plan is approved by the IRC. Tr. at 6486 (Priest).  They also keep a copy of each \nstudent’s behavior plans in their classroom. Tr. at 6487 (Priest).  If a special education teacher \ndetermines that a student is experiencing an antecedent condition, as identified in a behavior \nplan, then he or she uses the instructions in the plan, such as separate and calm, to redirect the \nstudent and prevent a behavior incident from occurring. Tr. at 6486 (Priest). \n \n14. PLAINTIFF’S EXPERTS’ BASELESS CRITICISMS OF \nREPLACEMENT BEHAVIORS AND FIDELITY MEASURES \n \nPlaintiff’s expert’s criticism of fidelity measures at CHDC was unfounded. Tr. at 5823 \n(Walsh).  In 2003, Plaintiff’s consulting psychologist did not express any concerns about \ntreatment fidelity measures. Tr. at 5825 (Walsh).  Plaintiff’s experts did not identify any failures \nin any of the CHDC plans as a result of a lack of treatment fidelity measures. Tr. at 5825 \n  185\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 186 of 383\n(Walsh).  Similarly, Dr. Walsh did not identify any failures in any of the CHDC plans as a result \nof a lack of treatment fidelity measures. Tr. at 5825 (Walsh).  Professional standards for practice \nin an applied setting like CHDC do not require or even reasonably allow for fidelity checks in \ntheir behavior plans. Tr. at 5822 (Walsh).  Professional standards do not require fidelity checks \nin applied settings like CHDC, as proposed by Plaintiff’s experts, and such fidelity checks are \nnot common in applied practice. Tr. at 5822 (Walsh).  Only twenty-five percent of research \nstudies published in peer-reviewed academic journal publications contain some kind of treatment \nfidelity. Tr. at 5823 (Walsh).  Instead of treatment fidelity measures in their behavior plans, \nCHDC psychological examiners circulate through the living units, monitor treatment plans on a \nmonthly basis, train staff on implementation, and are available for questions and answers, which \nensures treatment integrity. Tr. at 5824 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh has reviewed behavior plans in \nmany facilities and has never seen treatment fidelity measures in any of them. Tr. at 5824 \n(Walsh).  Plaintiff’s experts unfairly placed added emphasis on treatment fidelity measures in \nCHDC’s behavior plans because of their narrow academic background. Tr. at 5825 (Walsh). \nSome of Plaintiff’s experts may have failed to identify replacement behaviors in the plans \nthey reviewed because those replacement behaviors are listed in the positive behavior support \nplans or strategy plans and not necessarily the safety plans reviewed by Plaintiff’s experts. Tr. at \n5827 (Walsh).  Reinforcement contingencies are the most fundamental piece of a behavior plan \nand may appear as an if-then statement. Tr. at 5826 (Walsh).  In most of the behavior plans \nreviewed by Dr. Walsh there were clear reinforcement contingencies. Tr. at 5827 (Walsh).  In \nalmost all of the behavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh, the plans sought to reduce or eliminate \nproblem behaviors and included replacement behaviors. Tr. at 5827 (Walsh).  Nearly half of the \n  186\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 187 of 383\nbehavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh contained reinforcer selection and/or discussion of the \nsame. Tr. at 5827 (Walsh). \n \n15. EXPERT ANALYSIS OF CHDC BEHAVIOR PLANS \nDefendants’ expert, Dr. Walsh, objectively analyzed the behavior planning and program \nimplementation processes at CHDC. Tr. at 5807 (Walsh).  None of Plaintiff’s experts conducted \nan objective review of CHDC’s Behavior Plans. Tr. at 1201-03, 1210, 3174, 3175 (Matson, \nManikam).  Defendants’ expert, Dr. Walsh’s, analysis of CHDC behavior interventions at CHDC \nwas a formal, scientific process designed to show the nature and level of behavior interventions \nat CHDC. Tr. at 5812 (Walsh).   \nDr. Walsh created the formal tool he used for rating CHDC’s behavioral interventions \nand called it the “behavior plan quality rating tool” based on his experience analyzing behavior \nplanning at many ICF/MR facilities. Tr. at 5812 (Walsh).  Prior to using his behavior plan \nquality rating tool, Dr. Walsh did a reliability study of the tool, which determined that the tool \nhad reliability that could be the basis for peer-reviewed, academic publication. Tr. at 5813-5817, \n6085 (Walsh).  The behavior plan quality rating tool used by Dr. Walsh took a snapshot of the \nelements in the behavior plans. Tr. at 5812 (Walsh).  The tool had four sections, each with \nsubparts, addressing administrative, behavioral change, management, and overall elements. Tr. at \n5813 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh was careful to minimize the possibility of rater drift in his analysis of \nbehavior plans at CHDC by reviewing all of the plans in his sample in a two-day period without \ninterruption. Tr. at 5813 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh separately analyzed and rated the functional \nassessment sections of the CHDC behavior plans he reviewed. Tr. at 5818 (Walsh). \n  187\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 188 of 383\nDr. Walsh concluded that all of the administrative elements that should be in the \nadministrative portion of the CHDC behavior plans were there. Tr. at 5818-19 (Walsh).   \nMost of the behavior plans analyzed by Dr. Walsh did not allow for adjustments within the plan \nitself, which is directly in line with professional expectations because in an ICF/MR setting it is \nnot appropriate for staff to make changes to a plan on the fly. Tr. at 5819-20 (Walsh).  All of the \nCHDC behavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh had descriptions of the target behavior and \nevidence of functional assessments. Tr. at 5825-26 (Walsh).  Some of the plans Dr. Walsh \nreviewed targeted more than one behavior. Tr. at 5841 (Walsh).  At least seventy-five percent of \nthe behavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh contained clear descriptions of the plans and specific \nbehavioral techniques. Tr. at 5826 (Walsh).  In almost all of the CHDC behavior plans reviewed \nby Dr. Walsh there were instructions for specific plan techniques, sufficient to ensure \nimplementation. Tr. at 5826 (Walsh).  Going beyond professional standards, CHDC also has \nspecial meetings when behavior plans do not work in order to discuss those issues. Tr. at 5824 \n(Walsh). \na.  DR. WALSH’S FINDINGS AS TO CHDC BEHAVIOR \nPLANS \n \nThe behavior plans and practices at CHDC meet accepted professional standards. Tr. at \n5854 (Walsh).  All of the CHDC behavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh had data collection \nprovisions and instructions for staff. Tr. at 5830 (Walsh).  All but one of the CHDC behavior \nplans reviewed by Dr. Walsh had been previously reviewed by the CHDC Chief of Psychology, \nDr. Reddig, with the exception being one plan for which a cover sheet could not be located. Tr. \nat 5830 (Walsh).  In ninety-seven percent of the CHDC behavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh, \nthe instructions for applying the restrictive procedure were clear. Tr. at 5831 (Walsh).  For all of \nthe CHDC behavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh, he rated the general components as slightly \n  188\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 189 of 383\nabove average. Tr. at 5831 (Walsh).  For all of the CHDC behavior plans reviewed by Dr. Walsh, \nthere was a range of quality and on the whole CHDC is representative of other ICF/MRs. Tr. at \n5832 (Walsh). \n \nb.  MEASURES OF OUTCOMES AND \nEFFECTIVENESS OF CHDC BEHAVIOR PLANS \n \nOutcomes and effectiveness are important in assessing the quality of the CHDC behavior \nplans. Tr. at 5840 (Walsh).  Outcomes are the sine qua non of what is happening at a facility like \nCHDC. Tr. at 5807 (Walsh).  One of the most important outcomes of the CHDC behavior plans \nis the sixty-nine percent reduction in planned restraints from 2005 through the time of trial. Tr. at \n5798 (Walsh).  As discussed below, it is also impressive that CHDC had approximately sixty \npercent improvement in behaviors over about a twelve month period. Tr. at 5846 (Walsh).  For \nthe individuals who’s behavior plans Dr. Walsh reviewed, Dr. Walsh also rated the effectiveness \nof the plan, where there were monthly progress notes available to do so. Tr. at 5840 (Walsh). \nDr. Walsh’s analysis of CHDC behavior plans and monthly progress notes allowed him \nto determine whether behavior was changing over time. Tr. at 5841 (Walsh).  CHDC monthly \nsummaries are data tables that have a record of CHDC residents’ performance relative to a \nbehavior plan. Tr. at 5841 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh compared the first three quarters of data and \ncompared it with the last three quarters of data available for each individual in his sample to \ndetermine whether there was an increase or a decrease in the number of target behaviors. Tr. at \n5842 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh compared data for target behaviors identified in the CHDC behavior \nplans that he reviewed to determine whether those behaviors changed over a specified period of \ntime and based on that he gave them an effectiveness rating. Tr. at 5842-43 (Walsh). \n  189\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 190 of 383\nIf there were more problem behaviors over time, Dr. Walsh identified the target behavior \nas worse. Tr. at 5843 (Walsh).  If there was up to a thirty-three percent improvement in the target \nbehaviors over time, Dr. Walsh identified the target behavior as improved. Tr. at 5843 (Walsh).  \nIf there was between thirty-four and sixty-five percent improvement in the target behaviors over \ntime, Dr. Walsh identified the target behavior as much improved. Tr. at 5843 (Walsh).  If there \nwas a sixty-six percent or greater improvement in the target behaviors over time, Dr. Walsh \nidentified the target behavior as greatly improved. Tr. at 5843 (Walsh). \nAmong the behavior plans that Dr. Walsh rated for effectiveness, approximately fourteen \npercent had no change; approximately twenty-seven percent of the behaviors got worse; \napproximately thirty-five percent were greatly improved; approximately five and nine tenths \npercent were much improved; approximately seventeen and six tenths percent were improved. \nTr. at 5843 (Walsh).  Among the behavior plans that Dr. Walsh rated for effectiveness, \napproximately sixty percent of behaviors improved over about a twelve month period, which is \nremarkable in such a short period of time. Tr. at 5843 (Walsh).  The effectiveness of the behavior \nplans at CHDC indicates that what CHDC is doing in relation to the behavior plans is working \nand the outcomes for residents are strong. Tr. at 5844 (Walsh). \nThe behavior plans and practices at CHDC meet accepted professional standards. Tr. at \n5854 (Walsh).  Not only are standards for professional practice and procedures being met at \nCHDC, but the outcomes and effectiveness of CHDC’s behavior programming demonstrate that \nthose professional standards have yielded exceptional results for CHDC residents. Tr. at 5798, \n5846 (Walsh).   \n \n16. BEHAVIOR PLAN TRAINING \n  190\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 191 of 383\nA behavior plan is only implemented at CHDC after all staff, residents, and day programs \nare trained on the plan. Tr. at 5850 (Walsh).  Psychological examiners train staff in the behavior \nprogram that they wrote to ensure that staff are trained on all relevant and necessary material and \nno significant issues are overlooked.  Tr. at 2018 (Reddig).  The behavior programs at CHDC are \nnot written for a Ph.D. psychologist, rather they are written for direct care staff to understand and \nbe able to follow. Tr. at 6590 (Priest). \nAt trial, two CHDC psychological examiners described specifically how they work with \nstaff to implement behavior plans and track behaviors.  Psychological examiner, Ms. Glenn, \ntrains new staff in the programming for every resident in that living unit where that new staff \nwill work, including safety plans, positive behavior support plans, target behaviors, strategies for \nimproved behavior, psychiatric diagnosis, medications, behavior reports and how to complete \nbehavior reports as well as other documentation used in the residence. Tr. at 6678 (Glenn).  New \nstaff is trained to work specifically with the individuals who live in the residences in which they \nhave been assigned to work.  Tr. at 6678 (Glenn).  Ms. Glenn tests new staff to make sure they \nare competent in comprehending the behavior programs, identifying target behaviors, and \nunderstand which interventions are appropriate and when. Tr. at 6678 (Glenn).  Ms. Glenn also \nroutinely goes to new and experienced staff, to conduct in-person training anytime there is a new \nstrategy for improved behavior or new positive behavior support plan or safety plan. Tr. at 6679 \n(Glenn).  After training staff on new components of behavior plans and other changes in \nprogramming, Ms. Glenn tests staff on those components to ensure staff understand the plans.  \nTr. at 6679 (Glenn).  Ms. Glenn continuously works with staff to develop plans for the \nindividuals on her caseload. Tr. at 6680 (Glenn).  Staff are informed about what behaviors and \n  191\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 192 of 383\ninterventions Ms. Glenn is addressing and staff track that behavior and record all of the data \nsurrounding the behavior. Tr. at 6680 (Glenn). \nMr. Priest also testified that he trains staff on the programs that he creates for the \nindividuals on his caseload. Tr. at 6589 (Priest).  Mr. Priest also monitors staff to see how they \ninteract with residents, whether they are following the program, whether they are following \nprograms correctly, and documenting information correctly on the behavior reports. Tr. at 6589-\n90 (Priest).  For example, if staff write on the behavior report that they “followed the program,” \nMr. Priest will insist that they tell him precisely what they did, rewrite the behavior report, and \nremind staff that they are to record specifically what they observed and what they did to address \nthe behavior exhibited by the resident, and then Mr. Priest will determine whether the program \nwas followed or not. Tr. at 6590 (Priest).  Mr. Priest also developed a video to assist with \ntraining staff on the positive behavior support plans, levels of reinforcement system and \nincreased supervision requirements. Tr. at 6597 (Priest).  Staff watch the video then there is an \nexamination of the key points, which staff must pass before working with a resident.  Tr. at 6597 \n(Priest).  Staff turns the test into Mr. Priest personally so that when he looks over the test, he can \nexplain to that staff person what questions he or she answered incorrectly. Tr. at 6597 (Priest).  It \nis also a chance to correct staff on any issues and give the staff person an opportunity to ask \nquestions. Tr. at 6597 (Priest).  Mr. Priest also observes staff while they are implementing the \ninstructions in the positive behavior support plan. Tr. at 6597 (Priest). \nIn the past, Mr. Priest had an incident where a staff member did not know how to follow \na program that was going to be implemented, so Mr. Priest had that staff member watch the \nvideo and take the exam again. Tr. at 6597 (Priest).  The staff member got 6 out of 8 of the \nquestions correct after watching the video. Tr. at 6597 (Priest).  That score was considered \n  192\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 193 of 383\nunacceptable for CHDC standards and the staff member was transferred to an area where \nprogramming was simpler. Tr. at 6597 (Priest).  CHDC requires staff to get 100% of the \nquestions correct on the exam testing their competency on implementing behavior plans if staff \nare working with that resident everyday. Tr. at 6597 (Priest). \n \n17. CHDC QUICK REFERENCE GUIDES \nCHDC Quick Reference Guides are used on each residential unit. Tr. at 5903 (Walsh).  \nThey are beneficial tools that serve multiple functions. Tr. at 5904 (Walsh).  The Quick \nReference Guides list various information, including behavioral issues, a seizure profile, \nprecautions for bad weather, special dietary instructions, physical therapy instructions, mobility \ninformation and equipment needs, risk factors, and other precautions. Tr. at 1212, 1213 \n(Matson).  The Quick Reference Guides also includes a photo of the CHDC resident for whom \nthe Quick Reference Guides was prepared. Tr. at 1212 (Matson).  The Quick Reference Guides \nare not intended to be a substitute for any CHDC resident’s program plan or other records. Tr. at \n1213 (Matson). \n  None of Plaintiff’s experts did any formal analysis of CHDC’s Quick Reference Guides, \nbut Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Manikam relied on them for his substantive analysis of CHDC. Tr. at \n1211, 1212, 5904, 5918 (Matson, Walsh). \n \n18. BEHAVIOR REPORTS AND DATA COLLECTION \nThe CHDC behavior reports are a data collection tool for psychological examiners and \nother professionals. Tr. at 5911(Walsh).  A completed behavior report form is sent to the \npsychological examiner, and the Incident Review Committee, central records, and the resident’s \n  193\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 194 of 383\nresidence, and from there the relevant professionals use that information for their respective \nfunctions. Tr. at 5910-11 (Walsh).  The psychological examiners use the behavior reports to \ncollect data on the type and frequency of behaviors exhibited by residents. Tr. at 5909 (Walsh).  \nThat method of data collection is appropriate for psychological examiners because most CHDC \nresidents do not exhibit behaviors at such a high frequency that they could not be accurately \ntracked in that way. Tr. at 5909 (Walsh). \nThe CHDC behavior report is a sophisticated form used by psychological examiners and \nCHDC staff to collect and track data regarding CHDC residents’ behaviors. Tr. at 5910 (Walsh).  \nBehavior reports may be completed by direct care staff if the behavior occurred in the living unit \nor in front of direct care staff.  Tr. at 1994 (Reddig).  Teachers may also fill out behavior reports. \nTr. at 1994 (Reddig).  Behavior reports can be filled out by any staff who have been trained by \npsychological examiners on how to complete the behavior report. Tr. at 1992 (Reddig).  \nPsychological examiners train staff to identify antecedent conditions that appear immediately \nbefore a behavior manifests itself and staff report those conditions on the behavior report. Tr. at \n2008 (Reddig).  The CHDC behavior report form has fourteen sections for information. Tr. at \n5910 (Walsh).  The report form requires the individual completing it to provide, among other \nthings, the resident’s name, the residence code, the start and end time of the incident, the location \nof the behavior, the antecedent condition, which can be selected from seventeen pre-listed check \nboxes or the “other” box can be selected and a description provided, the target of the behavior, \nand the type of behavior, which can be selected from among nine pre-listed types of behavior. \nTr. at 5910 (Walsh). \nThe CHDC behavior report form also provides eighteen other pre-listed behaviors, two \nbehaviors about destruction, pre-listed check boxes for verbal expressions, for leaving assigned \n  194\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 195 of 383\narea, for type of restraint used, for staff response, and for a brief summary. Tr. at 5910 (Walsh).  \nThe CHDC behavior report form also requires that information to be included about staff \nmembers who were involved, including the staff member’s name, title, and the date. Tr. at 5911 \n(Walsh).  There is also a section on the behavior report on the bottom left that indicates staff \nresponse to the behavior. Tr. at 4876-77 (Murphy).  The immediate response to the behavior by \nthe staff is listed on every report.  Tr. at 4876-77 (Murphy).      \nThe immediate purpose of staff completing behavior reports is to report what is going on \nwith the residents they serve such as sleeping patterns, changes in mood, episodes of aggression \nor refusals, not necessarily to show trends and patterns of restraint. Tr. at 2109 (Reddig).  The \nCHDC behavior report form also allows the psychological examiner to provide information and \nmake an interpretation. Tr. at 4877, 5911 (Murphy, Walsh).  Other CHDC professionals derive \ndata from behavior reports to track trends and patterns. Tr. at 2109 (Reddig).  Generally, \nbehavior reports are used if a behavior occurs infrequently because data sheets would be \ninefficient in a situation such as that. Tr. at 1996 (Reddig). \nCHDC psychological examiners have two levels of data collection, the behavior reporting \nsystem and the psychological examiner’s personalized data collection system. Tr. at 5913 \n(Walsh).  CHDC psychological examiners exercise their professional judgment in building a \nspecific data collection form for particular residents at CHDC. Tr. at 5911-12 (Walsh).  CHDC \npsychological examiners develop their own forms for data collection and tracking behaviors for \nparticular CHDC residents in conjunction with the respective resident’s behavior plans. Tr. at \n5912 (Walsh).  Data collection sheets may be used for identifying behavior that a psychological \nexaminer wants to track, including sleep patterns, bowl movements, or engagement of certain \nbehaviors. Tr. at 1996 (Reddig).  CHDC psychological examiners train CHDC staff on the use of \n  195\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 196 of 383\nthe unique forms developed by the psychological examiners for data collection and tracking \nbehaviors. Tr. at 5912 (Walsh).  Among other things, CHDC psychological examiners graph data \non behaviors. Tr. at 5914 (Walsh).  Through the psychological examiner’s personalized data \ncollection system and the behavior reporting system treatment data is collected by psychological \nexaminers. Tr. at 5913, 6581 (Walsh, Glenn). \nPlaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson’s, concern that data cannot reliably be collected at CHDC if \nmore than one behavior is occurring is unfounded because the data sought to be collected are \nspecific predetermined behaviors, not passive research observations. Tr. at 5913-14 (Walsh).  \nPlaintiff’s expert, Dr. Matson, inappropriately compared CHDC psychological examiners real \nworld data collection processes to the data collection of researchers. Tr. at 5909 (Walsh). \nDefendants’ expert, Dr. Walsh, analyzed the 243 monthly progress notes from all of the \nCHDC psychological examiners for the month of June 2009.  Tr. at 5914 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh \nfound that seventy-two percent of those progress notes contained data tabulation and tables, \ncontrary to Plaintiff’s experts’ claim that CHDC psychological examiners were not charting their \ndata. Tr. at 5914 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh also found that an additional eighteen percent of those \nprogress notes had data graphed, contrary to Plaintiff’s experts’ claim. Tr. at 5914 (Walsh).  \nCHDC Psychological examiners decision to use charts in some data collection as opposed to \ngraphs is reasonable because their use of charts is with small, uncomplicated numbers and \ngraphing that data would add nothing to the analysis of the data. Tr. at 5915 (Walsh). \nCHDC psychological examiners do graph data if it is more complicated or if there is \nmore than one data set being compared. Tr. at 5915 (Walsh).  Ninety percent of the June 2009 \nmonthly progress notes prepared by psychological examiners had an objective layout of data, i.e. \na graph or a table. Tr. at 5915 (Walsh).  Plaintiff produced no evidence that the corresponding \n  196\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 197 of 383\nnine percent of June 2009 monthly progress notes, which contained only narrative descriptions of \ndata, was not appropriate for the data reflected in those summaries. Tr. at 5915 (Walsh).  CHDC \npsychological examiners track treatment data with objective data based means in accordance \nwith professional standards. Tr. at 5916 (Walsh). \n \n19. CHDC PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT’S BEHAVIOR REPORTS \nAND RESTRAINT USE SUMMARIES \n \nCHDC monitors all behavior reports facility wide.  Tr. at 4986 (Miller).  The psychology \ndepartment enters information from all of the behavior reports into a database, which then \ngenerates monthly reports.  Tr. at 4880 (Miller).  The monthly report is called the Behavior \nReport and Safety Plan Use Report, which, among other things, tracks the total number of \nbehavior reports, safety plan uses, and tracks how many times restraints, including emergency \nrestraints, were used in each month.  Tr. at 1261, 1997, 4875, 4876 (Matson, Reddig, Murphy); \nDef. Ex. SM-4.  Graphs are used for these reports because the visual presentation is more readily \nassessed by professionals across disciplines. Tr. at 4878, 4879 (Murphy), Def. Ex. SM-4.  The \nBehavior Report and Safety Plan Use Report is circulated to program coordinators, team leaders, \nthe quality assurance coordinator, administrative staff, psychology department staff, and the \nsuperintendant. Tr. at 2079, 4875, 4876 (Reddig, Murphy).  CHDC uses this report in various \nways. Tr. at 4882 (Murphy).  It provides detailed information about the use of planned restraints \nfor all of CHDC. Tr. at 1999 (Reddig).  Those reports are a good resource for CHDC to stay \nabreast of any trends and patterns associated with residents who have been restrained and any \ninformation from behavior reports that were prepared during that month. Tr. at 2079, 4875, 4876 \n(Reddig, Murphy).  Among other things, it includes information about particular residents and \noutlier restraint data. Tr. at 2079, 4875, 4876 (Reddig, Murphy). \n  197\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 198 of 383\nThe behavior reports are used by administrative staff to identify trends and patterns and \nhow best to respond to those issues. Tr. at 4882-4884 (Murphy), Def. Ex. SM-4.  For example, \nthe behavior report that included August 9, 2010, indicated a spike in restraints for F.B. Tr. at \n4886-87 (Murphy), Def. Ex. SM-4.  Because of that indication, the spike would be reviewed by \nthe IRC and the psychological examiner treating FB. Tr. at 4886, 4887 (Murphy), Def. Ex. SM-\n4.  Typically, the psychological examiner is contacted first to begin that type of review process.  \nTr. at 4882-4884 (Murphy), Def. Ex. SM-4.  If an increase in restraints is detected in a certain \nresidence or certain individuals, those reasons are also examined. Tr. at 4882-4884 (Murphy), \nDef. Ex. SM-4.  Depending on the reasons, the behavior, environment, or staff may be addressed. \nTr. at 4882-4884 (Murphy), Def. Ex. SM-4.  Reviewing spikes in behavior for particular days is \nvaluable to understand what may have gone on that particular day to increase behaviors, such as \na fire drill or weather conditions. Tr. at 4885, 4886 (Murphy), Def. Ex. SM-4.  Such reasons \nwould indicate to the team that perhaps a change in an individual’s plan may not be appropriate \nbecause the behavior may have been caused by an anomalous environmental factor.  Tr. at 4885, \n4886 (Murphy), Def. Ex. SM-4.  Trends, patterns, and thresholds are also tracked from the \nIncident Review Committee meeting minutes to provide CHDC.  Tr. at 4930, 4931 (Murphy).    \n \n20. CHDC MONTHLY PLAN REVIEWS ENSURE CHDC \nPROVIDES ACTIVE TREATMENT \n \nCMS regulations require CHDC to provide active treatment for CHDC residents, which \nis not provided in community based settings.  The ICF/MR Guidelines describe active treatment \nas “aggressive, consistent implementation of a program of specialized and generic training, \ntreatment, health services and related services….” 42 CFR 483.440(a).  CHDC is meeting active \ntreatment standards delineated in ICF/MR regulations. Tr. at 5928 (Walsh).  The ICF/MR \n  198\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 199 of 383\nrequirement for active treatment does not mean that CHDC residents have to receive \nprogramming 24-hours per day. Tr. at 5927 (Walsh).  An example of active treatment meeting \nICF/MR requirements is setting a goal to teach someone how to brush his or her teeth by having \nhim or her practice teeth brushing three times a week. Tr. at 5927 (Walsh).  Although none of \nPlaintiff’s experts reviewed active treatment at CHDC in any depth, Plaintiff’s experts agreed \nthat CHDC residents should not be constantly engaged, in adaptive skills, speech, or other skill-\nbuilding activities. Tr. at 1263, 1264, 3195, 3196 (Matson, Manikam).   \nThe monthly plan reviews at CHDC is a program review that is done to ensure quality \nand that the active treatment requirements for residents are met. Tr at 5950 (Walsh).  The \nreviews include assessing programs that are part of the Individual Program Plans for each CHDC \nresident. Tr. at 5950 (Walsh).  The monthly plan review occurs at the team level and again at a \ncentral level. Tr. at 5950 (Walsh). \nAt the team level, program coordinators do a monthly plan review for each resident, \nwhich is a paper review. Tr. at 5950 (Walsh).  On a monthly basis, CHDC program coordinators \nserve an ongoing quality review function by conducting a process called “monitoring,” which \ninvolves the program coordinators observing the training of at least one objective for each client. \nTr. at 5950 (Walsh).  The monthly plan reviews done by the program coordinators are \ndocumented on a two page sheet that includes data and narrative sections. Tr. at 5951 (Walsh). \nThe central monthly plan review is done by someone in the quality assurance department \nand includes a review of the actual IPP documents. Tr. at 5951 (Walsh).  The central monthly \nplan review includes an analysis of the IPP documents with CHDC’s IPP review check sheet, \nwhich has seventy-seven items to make sure the IPPs have the necessary components and that \nthose components hold together and make sense. Tr. at 5951 (Walsh).  The CHDC Quality \n  199\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 200 of 383\nAssurance Department reviews 840 IPPs annually with the CHDC IPP review check sheet in \naddition to the 6,000 plus annual team level monitoring checks. Tr. at 5952 (Walsh).  Programs \nat CHDC are constantly reviewed to ensure their effectiveness and implementation. Tr. at 5952 \n(Walsh). \n \n21. CHDC’S HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEES \nThe human rights committees at CHDC use preformatted human rights committee review \nreports. Tr. at 5933 (Walsh).  The first page of the human rights committee review report is \nlargely data based, including personal documentation, medication, monitoring, and objectives \nunder review, and the second page is largely narrative. Tr. at 5933 (Walsh).  The human rights \ncommittee meeting minutes go beyond professional standards by keeping the human rights \ncommittee meeting minutes on the form with the individual’s records. Tr. at 5933 (Walsh). \nThe CHDC human rights committees do not just do one time checks on matters that \npotentially impact residents’ rights, but rather the committees may do extra reviews of a matter \nafter one month, three months, or six months. Tr. at 5934-35 (Walsh).  The CHDC human rights \ncommittees may review residents’ cases even where there is no behavior plan if someone notices \nan increase in problem behaviors. Tr. at 5935 (Walsh). \nDefendants’ expert, Dr. Walsh, took all of the human rights committees meeting minutes \nfrom March and April 2009 and analyzed those minutes to characterize what was accomplished \nby those meetings and minutes. Tr. at 5934 (Walsh).  The human rights committee meetings \nreviewed by Dr. Walsh included psychological examiners, representatives from the community, \na consumer representative, a CHDC staff member representative, a medical representative, and \nthe human rights committee chairperson. Tr. at 5934 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh found that the CHDC \nhuman rights committee meets ICF/MR requirements for plan and review. Tr. at 5848-49 \n  200\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 201 of 383\n(Walsh).  The CHDC human rights committee exceeds professional standards and its process and \noutcomes reflect its high achievements. Tr. at 5935 (Walsh).  In addition to the human rights \ncommittees, as discussed above, CHDC has another group of oversight committees called the \nincident review committees. Tr. at 5936 (Walsh). \n \nC.  CHDC HABILITATION, NUTRITION MANAGEMENT, \nCOMMUNICATION, SPEECH THERAPY, PHYSICAL THERAPY, \nOCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, ORAL HYGIENE \n \n  The Plaintiff provided insufficient evidence, and in some cases no evidence, to prove that \nthe Defendants substantially departed from accepted professional practice in the areas of \nhabilitation, nutritional management, communication and speech therapy, physical therapy and \noccupational therapy, and oral hygiene.  Furthermore, the Defendants’ nationally-recognized \nexperts concluded that the state’s treating professionals are exercising professional judgment and \nmeeting or exceeding accepted professional standards in these areas.    \n  The Plaintiff cannot meet its burden of proof by presenting nothing more than (1) a \ndifference of professional opinion as to which practices are appropriate or (2) expert testimony \nthat another course of action would have been better. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 321 \n(1982); Collignon v. Milwaukee County, 163 F.3d 982, 987 (7th Cir. 1998); Lelsz v. Kavanagh, \n807 F.2d 1243 (5th Cir. 1987); Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 \nF.2d 1239, 1248 (2nd Cir. 1984); Doe v. Gaughan, 617 F. Supp. 1477, 1487 (D. Mass, 1985), \naff'd, 808 F.2d 871 (1st Cir. 1986); See also Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250, 252 (4th Cir. \n1990) (noting that Youngberg prohibits courts from \"weigh[ing] the decisions of the treating \nprofessionals against the testimony of the [plaintiffs'] professionals to decide which of several \nacceptable standards should apply\"); U.S. v. Comm. of Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. 565, 584 \n  201\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 202 of 383\n(W.D. Pa. 1995) (\"Optimal courses of treatment as determined by some expert, while laudable, \ndo not establish the minimal constitutional standard\").  Rather,  \n \nLiability may be imposed only when [a] decision by [a] \nprofessional is such a substantial departure from accepted \nprofessional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that \nthe person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a \njudgment. \n \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 323.   \nThe evidence at trial clearly demonstrates that CHDC’s treating professionals exercise \nprofessional judgment.  Defendant’s experts, nationally recognized, highly qualified \nprofessionals, concur that professional judgment was exercised and that practices at CHDC meet \nor exceed accepted professional standards.    \n \n22. DEFENDANTS’ EXPERTS, DR. SHEPPARD, DR. SCHMELER, \nMR. JINKS, AND MS. HACKETT, ARE MORE QUALIFIED, \nUSED MORE APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGY, AND \nAPPLIED MORE APPROPRIATE STANDARDS THAN \nPLAINTIFF’S EXPERT, MS. CRAWFORD, IN RENDER \nOPINIONS ON THE QUALITY OF NUTRITIONAL \nMANAGEMENT, COMMUNICATION AND SPEECH \nTHERAPY,  PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY,  \nAND ORAL HYGIENE AT CHDC  \n \n  Because of the Defendants’ experts’ specialized and highly qualified backgrounds, \nDefendants’ experts are more aware of the accepted professional standards in their respective \nfields.   Plaintiff’s expert, Ms. Carly Crawford (OT), presented the majority of testimony \nregarding nutritional management, communication and speech therapy, and physical therapy \n(PT) and occupational therapy (OT).  Defendants’ experts, Dr. Sheppard (nutritional \n  202\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 203 of 383\nmanagement), Dr. Mark Schmeler (OT), Mr. Jinks (communication and speech therapy), and Ms. \nPamela Hackett (PT) were far more qualified than Ms. Crawford to render opinions on the \nquality of care at CHDC in these areas.   \n  Plaintiff’s expert, Ms. Crawford, is a licensed occupational therapist in the state of \nOklahoma. Tr. at 2739, 2743 (Crawford).  She has no licensing or training as a physical \ntherapist, no formal training or licensing as a speech therapist, no formal training or licensing as \na nutritionist, no formal training or licensing in psychology, and no formal training or licensing \nin nursing. Tr. at 2898 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford was a teacher for the deaf, but she has no \nformal training or licensing in any area other than occupational therapy. Tr. at 2898 (Crawford).  \nMs. Crawford is not licensed to provide physical therapy, speech therapy, nursing, or dietary \nservices. Tr. at 2899 (Crawford).  She is not certified by RESNA. Tr. at 2900 (Crawford).  She \nholds no academic appointments, has not published any peer reviewed journals, and has not \ngiven any formal presentations in “some years.” Tr. at 2900, 2901 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford \ndoes not directly provide services to any adults. Tr. at 2901 (Crawford).  She has never been \nqualified by a Court to offer an expert opinion regarding the standard of care for occupational \ntherapy (or physical therapy, speech pathology, nutrition, medicine). Tr. at 2901 (Crawford).  \nSimilarly, Ms. Crawford has no training or experience to offer an expert opinion as to \npsychology or medicine. Tr. at 2901, 2902 (Crawford).  Defendants’ expert, Dr. Kastner, found it \ninappropriate for Ms. Crawford to comment on physical and nutritional management as she is \nnot licensed as a physical therapist or a speech language pathologist. Tr. at 4272 (Kastner).  N \nthe issue of expert qualifications, Dr. Kastner, noted: \nMs. Crawford’s opinions would seem to undermine that \nrequirement, because what she proposed in her report was really \nbased upon the idea that having worked shoulder to shoulder with \npeople she somehow had obtained sufficient knowledge to be able \n  203\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 204 of 383\nto practice in those disciplines.  So her opinion regarding \npositioning, for example, which she acknowledged falls into the \nscope of practice of a physical therapist, are really without any \nbasis.  Her opinion about feeding practices, which fall into the \nscope of practice of a speech therapist, really have no basis at all, \nno documents, no practice parameters, guidelines, \nrecommendations, standards, licensure, just her opinion. \n \nTr. at 4031 (Kastner).   \nFurther, Ms. Crawford’s testimony suggests that she is biased against institutional \nsettings and that she may come to the same conclusion in every institution that she reviews.  On \npage 1 of her expert report in this matter, Ms. Crawford referenced the Beatrice State \nDevelopment Center.  In part, she explained: “I have done many of these reports and I have a \ntemplate that I use that includes the general propositions and this particular first page has the \noutline because I used the same methodology for all of them ….”   Tr. at 2904 (Crawford).  \nWhen asked if it was accurate to say that her report for Beatrice contained many of the same \nconclusions as the report in this matter, Ms. Crawford responded that there “were possibl[y] \nsome similarities.”  Tr. at 2905 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford did not produce the Beatrice report to \nthe Defendants per their request for comparison.  Ms. Crawford deferred to the DOJ attorney as \nto whether or not to turn over the Beatrice report.  She stated: “I was allowing the attorney to \nmake that determination.  I don’t know what the rules are in terms of confidentiality for other \ncases I am working on.”  Tr. at 2905, 2906 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford made no \nrecommendations in her report, yet her report refers to a recommendation section in her \nintroduction.  She explained: “[T]hat page is a document on my computer that has these very \nsame things in it and I did not make that.”  Tr. at 2906 (Crawford).  Such statements further \nsupport a finding that Ms. Crawford uses the same reports for various institutions that she \nreviews. \n  204\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 205 of 383\n  Three of five of Ms. Crawford’s references supporting her findings were handouts not \ndrafted by her.  Tr. at 2915, 2916 (Crawford).  Such handouts cannot be considered accepted \nprofessional standards.  Defendants’ expert, Dr. Kastner concluded tht Ms. Crawford is not \nqualified to comment on the scope of practice for physical therapists, nutritionists, nurses, \npsychologists, or physicians.  Tr. at 4274 (Kastner).  Her comments on physical assistance \nsupports and mealtime supports are completely without any basis.  Tr. at 4274 (Kastner).  She \nalso could not cite any evidence as to standards for physical and nutritional supports.  Tr. at 4274 \n(Kastner).     \n  The Plaintiff presented only the testimony of its occupational therapist, Ms. Crawford, to \ncover all of the professional disciplines of nutritional management, communication and speech \nlanguage pathology, and physical management (OT and PT).  The Defendants, in contrast, \npresented testimony of four highly specialized experts to review each of these areas.    \n   \n  Justine Joan Sheppard, Ph.D., CCC/SLP, BRS-S \n  Defendants’ expert, Dr. Justine Joan Sheppard is an adjunct professor and associate \nprofessor at Teachers College, Columbia University.

Defendants’ experts are also \n  210\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 211 of 383\nmore credible because they used appropriate scientific methodology, whereas Ms. Crawford \nlacked any concrete methodology in her review of services at CHDC.       \n  Mrs. Crawford’s report states in her introduction that she describes her methodology used \nfor her review, but there was no section on methodology in her report.  Tr. at 4282 (Kastner). \nMs. Crawford, basically selected individuals to review as she made her on-site \nobservations.  She was asked by the Plaintiff “to look at physical and nutritional management \nservices and therapy services that included OT, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and \nspeech language pathology.” Tr. at 2740 (Crawford).  However, her methodology for reviewing \nthese areas was flawed.  She did not observe any staff training on eating. Tr. at 2907 (Crawford).  \nShe did not specifically interview any staff as to their understanding of the various terms of \nspecific plans. Tr. at 2907, 2908 (Crawford).  Nor did she observe the dysphagia committee in \noperation. Tr. at 2908 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford did not use any particular instruments to \nmeasure the health, welfare or wellness of any individual. Tr. at 2914, 2915 (Crawford).  She did \nnot even request all relevant records for preparation of her findings.  Tr. at 2907 (Crawford).   \nMs. Crawford had no benchmarks for the various health indicators that she stated required \ntracking, such as pneumonia, aspiration, nutrition, choking, mortality, decubitus, osteoporosis, et \ncetera. Tr. at 2918 (Crawford).  As to Ms. Crawford’s flawed methodology, Defendants’ expert, \nDr. Kastner, observed: \nMs. Crawford identified no sample prospectively as to what she \nwanted, what data she wanted to collect.  She identified no care \npractices that she wanted to examine.  She identified no standards \nfor those care practices.  She identified no outcomes for those care \npractices or any benchmarks against which those outcomes would \nbe compared.  Her evaluation appeared to be based in identifying a \ngroup of outliers which she identified using the risk assessments \nprovided to her by the facility and going through those outliers to \nidentify any potentially poor outcomes, to then highlight those \noutcomes in her report and make a representation that those poor \n  211\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 212 of 383\noutcomes for those outliers represented the pattern of care in the \nfacility, which again, I believe is a completely inappropriate \napproach to making a representation about a pattern of care.   \n \nTr. at 4273-4274 (Kastner). \n  More troubling was the way Ms. Crawford conducted her observations by interacting \nwith the very people she was observing.  When asked whether her interactions with clients at \nCHDC impacted her observations of the very people she was trying to review, Ms. Crawford \nreplied: \nWell, when I go into a facility, I again, like to interact with people \nas people and I like to see how they respond and communicate and \ninteract as a – because I care about them as people.  So I – I don’t \nsee that as inappropriate. \n \nTr. at 2931 (Crawford).   \nAnother of Plaintiff’s own experts, Dr. Matson, explained that when he conducts his \nreviews, he does not interact any more than necessary with the residents because it might upset \nthem and might actually alter the representativeness of his observations.  Tr. at 1262, 1263 \n(Matson).   Defendants’ expert, Dr. Kastner, felt that Ms. Crawford and Ms. Osgood were \nparticularly disruptive during their tours at CHDC and that had an effect on the quality of their \nobservations. Tr. at 4058 (Kastner).   \nSo, for example, during meals -- this is a simple -- it's \nno big deal. Client has very severe spasticity, and he cannot \ngrasp a cup. His hands are flexed, which means they are bent to \nthe wrists, and they are rotated externally, which means they \nare turned outwards, which leaves only his wrists to oppose each \nother. And he uses the back of his wrists to grasp a cup and to \nlift it to his mouth and drink. Obviously, it's a challenge for \nthis person to drink, but he can drink independently. \nMs. Crawford was interacting with him during his attempt to \ndrink. He smiled up at her, and he turned his head, and he \ndumped all the meal all over himself. And he was perfectly \nhappy to get the attention. But it didn't represent much of an \nopportunity to observe him feeding and certainly wouldn't be the \n  212\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 213 of 383\nbasis for drawing any conclusions about feeding practices at the \nfacility. \n \nTr. at 4058 (Kastner). \nMs. Crawford would go in and in a very general way just say, \"Hi, \nI'm Carly.\" I'm here to do whatever. Some rooms she had clearly \nidentified the clients she was looking for. So in one instance, she \nwalked into the room and said to no one in particular, \"Where is \nL.?\" Well, that's like an alarm going off, you know, particularly in \nthe settings where there are the younger clients, who have very \nstrict behavioral programming. That is a cue for people to \nbegin to misbehave. It's like watching the balls on a pool \ntable when the cue ball hits them, and all of a sudden they are \ngoing in all kinds of different directions. In my notes -- I'm \nnot going to read them -- there might be a description of what \nhappened in that room when she walked in and asked for L., and L. \nimmediately knew that it was -- it was an opportunity for him to \nmake mischief. There were two different occasions where she \nspoke to a client, talked to them about, \"Why are you here? What \ndo you want to do? Do you want to go outside?\" And the client \nleft. Then all of a sudden the staff have to scramble, because now \nthey have someone that's supposed to be doing something else. \nShe may not understand that her interaction with that client \nprovoked that behavior. But it was clear to me that there was a \ncausality to what happened during the tour. And that has an \neffect on the observations that occurred. \n \nTr. at 4059 (Kastner).   \nThere was a client who had a communication board. \nShe was in a wheelchair with a tray and the board, and she uses \nthe board to communicate. And she has trouble moving her body \nand turning her head and looking. The appropriate way to \naddress her would be to stand in front of her so that she can \nsee you and interact with you and the board at the same time. \nBut Ms. Crawford approached her from behind, addressed her \nover her left shoulder. And the client found that frustrating, \nbecause the client couldn't simultaneously turn and maintain a \nposition in her chair and interact with Ms. Crawford and use the \ncommunication board effectively. Again, those types of events \noccurred fairly regularly. \n \nTr. at 4060 (Kastner).   \nAs Dr. Kastner noted further, from his touring with Ms. Crawford: \n  213\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 214 of 383\nSo, for example, when she walked into the room with the younger \nresidents and sat down on the couch next to T.C. or L.W. -- it is in \nmy notes somewhere -- I can’t remember -- and moved his \npersonal objects and gave her pen and paper to him and started \nlooking through his books, it was a serious disruption in the \nbehavioral programming, not only for that individual, but for \neveryone else in the room who wanted to be treated equally.  So \nthat day in particular was a very difficult tour, because it became \nso disruptive that she was asked to leave.  And it was only after \npersistent requests from the staff through Mr. Zaycosky that she \neventually agreed to leave, and at that point threw her hands up \nand said, “I’m done touring,” even though we were scheduled to \ngo to another setting.  She just went back to the visitors’ room, I \nthink where the DOJ staff were.   \n \nTr. at 4061 (Kastner). \n \n  Ms. Crawford also did not perform any hands-on assessments to determine optimal or \nproper alignment. Tr. at 5287, 5288 (Hancock).  Dr. Kastner noted that Ms. Crawford did no \nformal assessment of any resident at CHDC and, therefore, Ms. Crawford cannot attribute any \nharm that would result from the alleged practices she claims to have observed. Tr. at 4285-4288 \n(Kastner).  Thus, while she was quick to criticize an individual’s position as improper, without \nassessment, she could not possibly make a finding on any individual’s ability to conform to a \ndifferent alignment or position.  Treating professionals at CHDC had made such assessments.     \n  Dr. Kastner stated that Ms. Crawford did not track any outcomes at CHDC and offered \nno benckmarks for evaluating the appropriateness of outcomes.  Tr. at 4281 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner further described the bias of Ms. Crawford’s sample as follows: \nThat sample was not drawn on a random basis. Again, for \nher consideration, she used the documents provided by the \nfacility to identify individuals at greatest risk, whether they \nwere the, as we saw in trial, the list of individuals who were \nhospitalized, risk of -- individuals who were at risk of \ndysphagia, a list of individuals who were at risk of fracture \ndue do osteoporosis. Her focus was on the high-risk individuals, \nthe individuals most likely to have poor outcomes. \nI don't think the process of collecting data would lead in any \n  214\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 215 of 383\nfashion to any reasonable assessment of the pattern of care. \n \nTr. at 4284-85 (Kastner). \n  Contrary to Ms. Crawford, Defendants’ experts used a much more objective methodology \nin conducting their reviews.  Each expert focused on specific areas of expertise, and \ncomprehensively and extensively conducted on site visits, staff interviews and document review. \n  For example, Defendants’ expert, Dr. Sheppard, toured CHDC twice, three days in \nNovember 2009 and one day in March 2010.  Tr. at 3299 (Sheppard).  She visited fourteen sites \non campus, including review of breakfasts, lunches and dinners at the residences.  She observed \nmedication passes, canteen meals, and classroom snacks.  Tr. at 3299, 3300 (Sheppard).  Dr. \nSheppard reviewed samples of the population at CHDC, that is, adults and children; medically \nfragile; ambulatory and non-ambulatory; tube fed and independent eaters.  She testified, “I \nselected a range of sites to give me those views and also to give me views of all the different \ntypes of eating environments.”  Tr. at 3300 (Sheppard).  Dr. Sheppard reviewed twenty-three \nresident charts and observed eighty-five residents at these various sites.  Tr. at 3300, 3301, 3373 \n(Sheppard).  Dr. Sheppard reviewed all the mealtime plans and diets for the individuals she \nobserved. Tr. at 3301 (Sheppard).  She interviewed CHDC administrators, PTs, OTs, SLPs, \nresident staff, infection control members, and the Chair of the Central Dysphagia Committee.  \nTr. at 3300 (Sheppard). Dr. Sheppard reviewed various documents including policies, \nprocedures, guidelines that related to swallowing and dysphagia, and management of swallowing \nand dsyphagia.  She reviewed dental care documents as well.  Tr. at 3301 (Sheppard). \n  Defendants’ expert, Dr. Schmeler, toured CHDC in March 2009.  He specifically toured \nthe physical therapy clinic, physical therapy orthotics shop, and visited various homes to observe \nthe residents.  He also reviewed various documents including the Occupational Therapy Policies \n  215\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 216 of 383\nand Procedures Manual, the physical therapy assessment forms, and the adaptive equipment \nforms. Tr. at 3453, 3454 (Schmeler).  Dr. Schmeler made observations of 10 CHDC residents.  \nTr. at 3454, 3455 (Schmeler).  He did not use outcome-based quantitative data for his review of \nCHDC because, as he testified, “the population I was looking at was not cognitively intact \nenough or nonverbal.”  Tr. at 3496 (Schmeler).  Dr. Schmeler considered comments and opinions \nof treating professionals, but made his own determinations and findings.  Defendants’ expert, \nMr. Jinks, reviewed the speech language pathology portions of medical records.  He also made \nobservations while on site. Mr. Jinks observed four residents while on site at CHDC: A.J., S.B., \nK.F., and C.M.  Tr. at 3531, 3532 (Jinks).  The focus of Defendants’ expert Ms. Hackett “was to \nlook at the management of the physical therapy program and to assess specifically the \npositioning programs and the seating and positioning for the residents.”  Tr. at 4814 (Hackett).  \nMs. Hackett spent two days on site at CHDC.  She interviewed staff and observed residents’ \nphysical reassessments.  She conducted some physical assessments to determine whether or not \nthe positioning equipment and program were appropriate.  Tr. at 4814 (Hackett).  Ms. Hackett \nreviewed approximately one hundred positioning programs.  She reviewed specific positioning \nprograms in greater detail for those whose positioning was questioned by Plaintiff’s expert, Ms. \nCrawford.  She reviewed approximately nineteen (19) individualized positioning programs.  Tr. \nat 4814, 4815 (Hackett).  Ms. Hackett reviewed eight (8) residents in greater detail.  Tr. at 4816 \n(Hackett).  \n  Generally, the Defendants’ experts reviewed individual residents in response to Ms. \nCrawford’s findings.  Individuals were also selected for independent review.  Each of \nDefendants’ expert’s review was within his or her area of expertise. Collectively, they presented \na much more balanced and comprehensive review than that of Ms. Crawford. \n  216\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 217 of 383\n \nEXPERT STANDARDS \n  There is no evidence that CHDC substantially departed from any accepted professional \nstandard in the areas of habilitation, nutritional management, communication and speech therapy, \nphysical therapy, occupational therapy, and oral hygiene. The Plaintiff’s expert, Ms. Crawford, \nused her own personal opinion and no formalized instruments or methods when conducting her \nreview. She provided no particular accepted professional standards that the Defendants are \nfailing to follow. Furthermore, Ms. Crawford provided testimony on what she considered to be \nbest practices.  At trial, the Defendants’ experts presented various accepted professional \nstandards.  They found that CHDC meets or exceeds those standards.  They found no departures \nfrom any accepted standards.  Treating professionals at CHDC are exercising professional \njudgment.  See generally Tr. at 2739-2968, 3287-3406, 3411-3448, 3448-3528, 3528-3562, and \n4812-4850 (Crawford, Sheppard, Sheppard, Schmeler, Jinks, Hackett). \n  Ms. Crawford seemed to review CHDC with a presumption that she would find \ndeficiencies.  She testified that she found some deficiencies in every facility she has reviewed.  \nTr. at 2903 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford could not articulate any specific professional standard, \nguideline or benchmark which she used to formulate her conclusions; rather, she used general \npropositions to guide her review.  She stated: “I developed [and] I verbalized them and put them \ndown on paper as a reflection of my experience as an occupational therapist, as a team member \non a physical nutrition management team and my experience across a wide number, a large \nnumber of facilities.”  Tr. at 2909, 2910 (Crawford). Ms. Crawford did not use any formalized \ninstrument to assess whether there was compliance with any of her general propositions.  Tr. at \n2910 (Crawford).  Her general propositions allegedly represent what she sees “customarily” in \n  217\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 218 of 383\nher experience and in her “experience visiting other facilities” and her “personal experience as a \nclinician.”  Tr. at 2911 (Crawford). Ms. Crawford’s general propositions have not been peer-\nreviewed in any manner.  Tr. at 2911 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford has not published her general \npropositions anywhere.  Tr. at 2911 (Crawford).  Defendants’ expert, Dr. Kastner explained:  \nI’m not in favor of going in, saying here's your policy and \nyou didn't comply with it, and therefore you violate \nprofessional standards. That is just not reasonable, especially \nat a facility like Conway that takes a more contemporary \napproach to quality management. \n \nTr. at 4019 (Kastner). \n  Ms. Crawford used her own “general propositions to conduct her review, but Dr. Kastner \nstated that these were not peer-reviewed and did not reflect the “opinion of any professional \ngroup, any association, or any prefession.”  Tr. at 4278 (Kastner).  Further, Ms. Crawford’s \nfindings were not based on substantial departures of professional care, as she used “best \npractices” as a threshold.  Stated differently, Ms. Crawford applied an optimal standard.  She \nagreed that she applied a standard that care be optimal for each individual.  Tr. at 2910, 2911 \n(Crawford).   \n  Ms. Crawford defined a guideline as something that is not “written in stone.  It is a \nsuggested practice.”  Tr. at 2911 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford defined a policy as “more specific \nprocedures … there would be stricter adherence.”  Tr. at 2911 (Crawford).  Professionals have \nmore latitude in implementing a guideline and less latitude in implementing a policy.  Tr. at \n2911, 2912 (Crawford). \n  Ms. Crawford discounted or disregarded CHDC’s adherence to ICF/MR regulations and \ndid not apply the ICF/MR standards in her review of CHDC.  Tr. at 2913 (Crawford). She \ntestified that she does not look at ICF/MR regulations routinely and agreed that she is not \n  218\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 219 of 383\nintimately familiar with the regulations.  Tr. at 2913 (Crawford). Ms. Crawford agreed, however, \nthat ICF/MR standards articulate some standards of care.  Tr. at 2914 (Crawford). Ms. Crawford \nis aware that CHDC is fully certified by CMS.  Tr. at 2914 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford did not \nconsider CARF standards in her review of CHDC.  She did not even know if CARF standards \nwould cover her review.  Tr. at 2913 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford was not familiar with the \nJCAHO standards and did not know if JCAHO standards would have any relevancy to an \nICF/MR setting.  Tr. at 2913, 2914 (Crawford). \n  In contrast to Ms. Crawford’s personal opinion approach, Defendants’ experts relied on \nconcrete mainstream accepted professional standards in the fields of nutritional management, \ncommunication and speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy, and oral hygiene.  \nBecause of their specialized and highly qualified backgrounds, Defendants’ experts are more \naware of the accepted professional standards in their respective fields.   \n  Dr. Sheppard explained that best practice in the field of nutritional management is \nevidence based, that is, there has been research to demonstrate the practice.  In addition, the \nquality of life as it relates to the individual must be considered along with the individual’s \nparticular needs, strengths and weaknesses.  Various professionals, an interdisciplinary team, \nwork together to develop the best possible program.  Tr. at 3296-3298 (Sheppard).  “And then \naccepted professional practice is more of a typical rather than the sign of excellence, but is a \nmore typical practice in a profession.  And it has elements of the best practice, but they may not \nbe applied as consistently across all individuals ….”  Tr. at 3298 (Sheppard). \n  As stated by Dr. Sheppard: “…minimally accepted professional practice doesn’t \nnecessarily consider quality of life.  You really are mostly concerned with health and safety \nissues and the programming is often generalized, not individualized.”  Tr. at 3298 (Sheppard).   \n  219\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 220 of 383\n  Dr. Sheppard applied the following standards: best practice; accepted practice; minimally \nacceptable practice; and failing.  Dr. Sheppard did not find any failings in the areas she reviewed.  \nDr. Sheppard applied the standards as practice standards.  The standards she applied were \nprocess based, with an outcome side.  “In other words, you don’t evaluate both process and \noutcome at the same time … it’s an attempt to look at a complex structure and not put a single \nlabel on the whole structure when there are complex things going on.”  Tr. at 3359-3361 \n(Sheppard). \n  If you fail the minimally accepted standard, there is harm.  Such harm includes physical \nas well as other types of harm.  Tr. at 3362 (Sheppard) .  “[I]f a facility violated a standard of \npractice as a matter of course, as a matter of what they did, then that also would fail to meet \nacceptable standards, minimum accepted professional practice.”  Tr. at 3363, 3368, 3369 \n(Sheppard).  “In dysphagia, the breaking of a minimal standard is one where there is -- harm \noccurs. But not only harm occurs, but harm occurs as a matter of -- harm occurs because of a \nmissed practice, if you -- if you will.”  Tr. at 3368 (Sheppard).   \n  Dr. Sheppard does not always find that facilities meet acceptable professional standards. \nDr. Sheppard found a facility in another state that failed in nutritional management.  “I found \nsubstantial failure, and I put that in my report.”  Defendants’ lead counsel, Tom York, in that \nmatter was the same defense lead counsel in this matter.  Tr. at 3441, 3442 (Sheppard).  As a \nresult, Dr. Sheppard has evidenced great integrity and honesty in her reviews. \n \nCHDC PROFESSIONALS QUALIFICATIONS, TRAINING, AND RATIOS \n  CHDC professionals in the areas of habilitation, nutritional management, communication \nand speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy, and oral hygiene are qualified \nand well trained.  They are exercising professional judgments.   \n  220\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 221 of 383\n  Cynthia Johnson is a clinical speech pathologist at CHDC.  Tr. at 5386 (Johnson).   Ms. \nJohnson holds an undergraduate degree in speech pathology from the University of Central \nArkansas, with a minor in special education, and a graduate degree in speech pathology from \nMemphis State University.  She also has a teaching certificate in special education; and has post-\ngraduate hours in special education from Vanderbilt University.  Tr. at 5386, 5387 (Johnson).   \nMs. Johnson is licensed by the State of Arkansas and has a certificate of clinical competence \nfrom the American Speech Language and Hearing Association.  Tr. at 5387 (Johnson).  Ms. \nJohnson has worked at CHDC for 29 years.  She provides clinical services and clinical therapy.  \nHer case load includes speech language and dysphagia services. She provides in-service training \nand represents speech services administratively at various meetings.  Tr. at 5387 (Johnson).  The \nquality of speech language pathology department personnel meets professional standards with \nrespect to credentials for their positions. Tr. at 3539 (Jinks).  \nAlesea Holbrook is the Director of Dietary Services at CHDC.  Tr. at 5316 (Holbrook).  \nMs. Holbrook holds a bachelor’s degree in dietetics from Texas Women’s University.  She is a \nregistered dietician with the American Dietetic Association and licensed by the State of \nArkansas.  Tr. at 5317 (Holbrook).  Ms. Holbrook’s work experience includes working as a \nclinical dietician at a hospital and providing clinical services at CHDC.  She has been employed \nat CHDC for 26 years.  Tr. at 5317 (Holbrook).  Ms. Holbrook’s main responsibility at CHDC as \nDirector of Dietary Services is working with the clinical services.  She also oversees the food \nservice department, which ensures residents receive the correct diets.  Tr. at 5317 (Holbrook).  \nThe Dietary Department provides competency-based training.  Such training is provided in their \nannual retraining and also during every employee’s Phase I initial training.  Dietary mixes, the \n  221\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 222 of 383\nactual thickening of a variety of liquids, are required to be approved by Ms. Holbrook or a \nspeech pathologist.  Tr. at 5320 (Holbrook).      \n  Staff training in nutritional management consists of one (1) week of classroom and two \n(2) weeks on-the-job training for newly hired employees.  Competency-based training is 2/3 of \nthe training.  Tr. at 3325, 3326 (Sheppard).  For new hires there were training sections on \nnutritional management, dietary, oral hygiene, choking, medication administration, and meal \nservice. There were specific competency-based trainings for thickening of liquids. Nurses are \nalso educated on the risk assessment for pneumonia, monitoring for tardive dyskinesia, \nadministration of medication, and enteral feeding and tube feeding.  Nurses are also trained on \nthickening liquid medication.  Tr. at 3326 (Sheppard).  When mealtime plans are changed, the \nspecialists make the changes and train the residential supervisors who in turn train the direct care \nstaff.  Tr. at 3326, 3327 (Sheppard). \n   CHDC considers the proper mealtime procedure and the thickening of liquids an \nimportant matter.  The Superintendant holds staff accountable for improper mealtime \noccurrences.  P. Exh. AAH 4.  Dysphagia training is provided to new employees.  The training \ncovers such issues as signs of silent aspiration, thickening of liquids, and use of adaptive \nequipment.  It also calls attention to the individual eating plans.  Tr. at 5396 (Johnson).   \n  Dr. Sheppard found that the staff training was an accepted professional practice model, \nand maybe with respect to the frequency of direct care training a minimally accepted level.  Tr. \nat 3328 (Sheppard).  The two (2) weeks on-the-job training was best practices model.  Tr. at \n3329.  The nurse training and retraining is a best practices model.  Tr. at 3329 (Sheppard).  The \ninterim training that occurred when there was a mealtime change “certainly meets minimally \nacceptable standards.”  Tr. at 3329 (Sheppard).   \n  222\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 223 of 383\n  DOJ counsel questioned Dr. Sheppard as to the level of complexity of the 2007 \nnutritional management PowerPoint presentation materials with respect to the competency-based \nquestions in Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1052-1, and DOJ counsel implied that the answers were obvious \nand did not establish competency.  Dr Sheppard replied that the questions were not “obvious at \nall.”  Tr. at 3390-3393 (Sheppard).  Training as to the mealtime liquids is done by the dietician \nwhen it is a pre-service or repeat service training and by the residential supervisors when there is \na meal plan change.  Tr. at 3394 (Sheppard).  The professional staff train the residential \nsupervisor and the supervisor would then train the direct care staff.  Tr. at 3394 (Sheppard).     \nApproximately eighty (80) individuals at CHDC receive direct speech therapy.  Tr. at \n5420, 5421(Johnson).   Mr. Jinks observed an initial orientation regarding communication to new \nstaff while he was on site.  The training provided by the speech language pathology assistant \ncovered issues from swallowing, use of sign language, general communicative interaction, as \nwell as some on communication devices, and other systems.  The initial orientation was \nadequate.  Tr. at 3531, 3536 (Jinks).  Mr. Jinks found that the quality of speech language \npathology staff department personnel meets professional standards with respect to credentials for \ntheir positions.  Tr. at 3539 (Jinks).  \nCHDC provides in-services on augmentative communication and on dysphagia.  Training \noccurs during Phases I and II training.  A speech aide conducts the training and a certified \nclinician also attends the training.  Tr. at 5389, 5396 (Johnson).  The speech aide who provides \nthe speech and dysphagia training is certified by the Arkansas Department of Human Services.  \nShe has 33 years of experience working with those with developmental disabilities and a number \nof years working under the supervision of speech language pathologists.  Tr. at 5396, 5397 \n(Johnson).  Mr. Jinks found that it is fine that Ms. Wheeler conducts general staff training on \n  223\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 224 of 383\naugmentative and adaptive equipment, even though she is not a licensed speech language \npathologist.  Tr. at 3559 (Jinks).  Supervisor training with respect to speech services has been \nprocedure review.  However, competency-based training is being implemented.  Tr. at 5398 \n(Johnson).  All the speech language clinicians have received at least one college level course in \nsign language.  Tr. at 5389, 5390 (Johnson).   \n  Lisa Hancock supervises the physical and occupational therapy (PT and OT) \ndepartments, as well as the physical therapy orthotics shop at CHDC.  Tr. at 5249, 5250 \n(Hancock).  Ms. Hancock provides direct care to residents on her caseload.  Tr. at 5249, 5250 \n(Hancock). Ms. Hancock holds a bachelor’s degree in physical therapy from the University of \nCentral Arkansas and she is licensed by the State of Arkansas as a physical therapist. Tr. at 5250 \n(Hancock).  Ms. Hancock routinely participates in continuing education to maintain her physical \ntherapy license in Arkansas.  Tr. at 5250, 5251 (Hancock).  Ms. Hancock began her career a \nCHDC as a staff therapist.  Tr. at 5251 (Hancock).  There is the equivalent of three (3) full-time \ntherapists in the physical therapy department.  Tr. at 5252 (Hancock).  There are also two (2) \nphysical therapy aides in the physical therapy department.  Tr. at 5252 (Hancock).  Additionally, \nthere are two physical therapy assistants in the physical therapy department. Tr. at 5252 \n(Hancock).  Ms. Hancock keeps track of whether all the physical therapists have their continuing \neducation courses up to date.  Tr. at 5252 (Hancock).   \nA physical therapy aide is an unlicensed person that serves specific \nfunctions within the department that have been instructed to them \nthrough in-service training, on-the-job training.  Unlike the \nphysical therapist assistant, they have a license and degree, \neducational background in the field.  The difference being that the \nphysical therapist aide can only do certain things as long as they \nare supervised by the minimum of a physical therapist assistant on \ngrounds.   \n \nTr. at 5252 (Hancock).   \n  224\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 225 of 383\nThe PT aides have a very hands-on relationship with the clients, and they are with the \nclients on a regular basis working on maintenance programs or delivering or replacing \nequipment.  Tr. at 5253 (Hancock).  Physical therapists and physical therapy aides and assistants \nall check to see if direct care staff is properly lifting and adjusting the client.  Tr. at 5253, 5254 \n(Hancock). \n  Direct care staff is trained on physical therapy and related services in Phase I and II \ntraining.  They then work on a regular basis with the PT staff on proper lifting techniques. Phase \nI PT training takes four (4) to four and a half (4 ½) hours.  During that time, transfers, \nmechanical lifts, adaptive equipment, et cetera are taught.  Tr. at 5254, 5261 (Hancock). A \nlicensed physical therapist or a physical therapist assistant provides the PT training in Phases I \nand II training.  Tr. at 5289 (Hancock).  Therapists maintain their continuing education \nrequirements and attend local and national conferences.  Tr. at 3459 (Schmeler).   \n  If a PT staff notices that a direct care staff is performing an improper lift or if there may \nbe imminent danger, they stop the lift from taking place.  If they feel the lift can be done better, \nthey suggest in-servicing.  Tr. at 5254 (Hancock).  If PT staff made an observation that a lift or \npositioning was improper after having previously been corrected, the PT would report back to \nthe PT therapist or assistant so that continued in-service could take place and correction could be \nmade.  Disciplinary action would take place if the problem persisted.  Tr. at 5255 (Hancock). \nA spot check is when a physical therapist or physical therapist \nassistant pops into a residence and watches a transfer take place \nunannounced, or if there’s not a transfer going on, we can give \nthem a task and say we’d like to see a two person lift from this \ncouch to this, and then we will check their technique.  And if they \nfollow all of the established guidelines that we provided them with \nin the past, and then at that point if we see anything that needs to \nbe addressed there on the spot, then we provide immediate in-\nservicing there.  And the form that’s used is one that can be \ndocumented as an in-service training as well.  \n  225\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 226 of 383\n \nTr. at 5262 (Hancock).  If spot checks revealed a pattern of techniques that could be improved, \nan in-service would be held for the entire unit.  Tr. at 5263 (Hancock).  The PT Department \nperforms periodic spot checks in the residences, to check on proper positioning and make any \ncorrections.  The therapist communicates directly with staff.  Ms. Hancock has requested that the \nphysical assistants perform spot checks on a regular basis, and that a minimum of two (2) take \nplace each day.  She has requested that follow-ups take place, and any additional in-servicing \ntakes place if needed.  Tr. at 5294-5296 (Hancock).  While this is not more formal training, it is \nstill training.  Tr. at 4847 (Hackett). \n \n23. HABILITATION, NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT, \nCOMMUNICATION AND SPEECH THERAPY,  PHYSICAL \nAND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, AND ORAL HYGIENE \nPROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT AND ACCEPTED \nPROFESSIONAL STANDARDS \n \n  The trial testimony and exhibits demonstrate that CHDC professionals are exercising \nprofessional judgments in their provision of care to CHDC residents.  No evidence has been \npresented by the Plaintiff to suggest a substantial departure from any accepted professional \nstandard in the areas of habilitation, nutritional management, communication and speech therapy, \nphysical therapy and occupational therapy, and oral hygiene.  To the contrary, the evidence \nsupports the findings that CHDC meets or exceeds accepted professional standards in these \nareas.  As discussed below, CHDC provides habilitation, nutritional management, \ncommunication and speech, physical and occupational (physical management), and oral hygiene \nservices and therapies.  No evidence has been produced, except perhaps isolated incidents, as to \nany harm to residents due to lack of any such services and therapies.     \n  226\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 227 of 383\n \nHABILITATION \n  CHDC meets or exceeds accepted professional standards in its provision of habilitation \nmaintenance and skill development.  CHDC provides habilitation to its residents.  Most \nhabilitation and training classes at CHDC include daily living skills, fine gross motor \ndevelopment, and sensory development.  Habilitation classes are held apart from the special \neducation classes.  Children receive habilitation classes during school hours in the special \neducation classrooms taught by special education teachers.  Tr. at 1658, 1665 (Price).   No \nevidence was presented at trial to suggest that CHDC was in substantial departure of any \naccepted professional standard with respect to habilitation.   \n  Dr. Matson seemed critical of some of the residents’ job tasks.  When asked if he knew \nthat the sorting of rocks, sorting and labeling of mineral samples, was for a contract with a local \ncollege geological department, Dr. Matson said it was “typical.” Tr. at 1266 (Matson).  However, \nhe could not have made any determinative finding as to habilitation as he did not interview any \nstaff to determine whether the activities were related to residents’ IPPs.  Tr. at 1266, 1267 \n(Matson).  He also did not compare the activities with any individual IPPs.  Tr. at 1267 (Matson). \n \nNUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT \nThe Constitution requires the management of nutritional status of residents at CHDC \npursuant to the exercise of professional judgment which is consistent with accepted professional \nstandards of practice.  U.S. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. 565, 611 (W.D. PA \n1995), aff’d. U.S. v. Ridge, 96 F.3d 1436 (3d 1996) citing Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, \n323 (1982).  As detailed below, CHDC provides the exercise of professional judgment consistent \nwith accepted professional standards of practice with respect to screening, assessment, \n  227\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 228 of 383\nmonitoring, and provision of care in its management of the nutritional status of its residents.  No \nsystem harm, or pattern or practice, have been shown to be due to lack of any such nutritional \nmanagement.  \n       \n  GENERAL NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT  \n  Dr. Sheppard found that CHDC’s overall nutritional management program meets \naccepted professional standards.  Tr. at 3351 (Sheppard).   \n[I]f you looked at this program from top to bottom, that is was -- it \nwas right in there with what the standards are for management in a \n-- of people with developmental disability in any setting.   \n \nTr. at 3351 (Sheppard).   \n  Nutritional Management is applied to a large number of CHDC residents.  Ninety-eight \npercent (98%) of residents at CHDC require diet modifications.  Tr. at 3303 (Sheppard).  Sixty-\ntwo percent (62%) of the population has reflux precautions.  Tr. at 3305 (Sheppard).  Plaintiff’s \nexpert, Dr. Matson, did not know what percentage of people at CHDC have eating problems.  Tr. \nat 1275 (Matson).  Thus, he is not fully informed to make any determinations on CHDC’s \nnutritional management.  \n  CHDC provides assessments and offers studies to determine each individual’s nutritional \nmanagement needs.  Each specif ic assessment and study is identified in the specif ic sections \nbelow (sections on dysphagia, pneumonia, choki ng incidents and difficult swallowing events, \nmealtime and meal plans, and adaptive equipment).  General descriptions as to assessments and \nmodified barium swallows are as follows. \n \n  Assessment    \n  228\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 229 of 383\n  CHDC is aware of its residents’ nutritional needs.  One indicator of nutritional status is \nan individual’s weight.  Weights are monitored weekly or monthly, and heights are monitored \nquarterly.  Individuals are reweighed if there is a discrepancy in excess of five (5) pounds.  A \ntrained dietary technician participates in weighing individuals.  Tr. at 3320 (Sheppard).  Other \nindicators are discovered through assessment.  Nutritional assessments are conducted annually \nfor everyone, those with and without problems.  Dr. Sheppard noted that: “And that’s really best \npractices model.”  Tr. at 3320 (Sheppard).  Individuals at CHDC are assessed by the Dietary \nDepartment for nutritional status a minimum of one time a year.  They are assessed more often if \nrequested by the physician, the team, or as a need may arise.  Tr. at 5317 (Holbrook).  Dr. \nMatson referred to assessment scales for eating problems, but he did not assess and is not aware \nof anyone at CHDC who has suffered physical harm as a result of not having such observation \nmethods used for their eating problems.  Tr. at 1275, 1276 (Matson).  Thus, his suggestion \nshould be discounted.   \n  CHDC uses barium swallows as a form of assessment and monitoring of an individual’s \nnutritional status.  Barium swallows have to be ordered by a physician.  Tr. at 2934 (Crawford).  \nBarium swallows have to be coordinated with the local hospital.  Tr. at 2934 (Crawford).   There \ncan potentially be some delay of the test if the hospital does not have availability.  Tr. at 2934 \n(Crawford).  However, possible delay does not hinder the usefulness of the swallow study as an \nassessment tool and has not hindered anyone’s care at CHDC.  Ms. Crawford did not know how \nlong it would take for an individual in the Conway community to get an appointment for a \nbarium swallow.  Tr. at 2935 (Crawford).  Thus, there is no indication that any potential delay is \nunreasonable.     \nThe modified barium study is used as an integral part of \nmanagement for people with swallowing disorders at CHDC. And \n  229\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 230 of 383\nin that year, 2009, 33 percent of the population had gone out for \nthese studies either responsive to changes in their levels of choking \nor pneumonia risk or in response to actual pneumonia episodes or \nchoking episodes. And in the studies, there is an indication that this \nwas -- these were valid referrals, is that the studies revealed \nabnormal swallowing in 91 percent of that 33 percent, so that they \nwere appropriate. \n… \nThat’s a pretty good level of positive results, that there were \nproblems that were identified in that - - in those studies.  And then \nthe interventions for that person - - appropriate diets, appropriate \nfeeding strategies - - were developed out of those, with those \nstudies as the database for making the appropriate decisions. \n \nTr. at 3305 (Sheppard).   \nDr. Sheppard stated that CHDC’s use of the modified barium swallow and consultations \nare an integral part of their management program and “was a best practice model.”  Tr. at 3312, \n3328 (Sheppard).  A speech pathologist would go along with the individual for his/her modified \nbarium swallow at Conway Regional Health System.  A community medical speech pathologist \nwould also provide consultation to advise on management of swallowing issues.  Tr. at 3324 \n(Sheppard).  The videofluoroscopy is conducted by both a radiologist and a medical speech \npathologist, which is standard practice.  Tr. at 3325 (Sheppard).  The modified barium swallow \nreport would go back with the individual that day and, “within 24 hours of the resident’s return, \nthe primary physician enters the chart note, which changes any practice, management of the \nindividual … it’s very quick turn around of information and implementation of this change in \npractice.”  Tr. at 3324, 3325 (Sheppard). \n  Dietary services are involved in swallow studies after notification by the speech \npathologist of completion of the study at the hospital.  Records, reports, and recommendations \nare sent to the Dietary Department for review and implementation.  Tr. at 5317, 5318 \n(Holbrook).  Per the barium swallow results, Ms. Holbrook marks any equipment changes on the \n  230\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 231 of 383\ndiet sheets, and the occupational therapist or the speech pathologist takes the equipment into the \nunits and provides the training.  Tr. at 5318 (Holbrook).   \n  Regarding nutritional management, Ms. Crawford claimed there were a number of \nresidents who would benefit from a physical and nutritional support team, but she did not \nperform any assessments at CHDC to determine if they would actually benefit from such a team.  \nTr. at 2919, 2920 (Crawford).  Dr. Kastner stated that the ICF/MR regulations do not require a \nphysical and nutritional management team as recommended by Ms. Crawford.  Tr. at 4280 \n(Kastner).   Thus, her suggestion should be discounted.  Ms. Crawford could not offer even a \nsingle reference to support her opinion that her physical and nutritional management approach \nshould be used at CHDC.  Tr. at 4030 (Kastner). \n \n  DYSPHAGIA \n  CHDC exercises professional judgment with respect to assessment and management of \ndysphagia.  Except for some isolated incidents, no examples of harm due to lack of dysphagia \nmanagement have been proven.  CHDC provides comprehensive dysphagia management \nguidelines.  CHDC has guidelines for management of dysphagia in individuals with swallowing \nand feeding disorders.  CHDC’s guidelines for management of dysphagia are a quality of life \ndocument as well.  Tr. at 3306 (Sheppard); Def. Ex. 347.  CHDC’s guidelines for management of \ndysphagia outline criteria and very specific procedures.  Dr. Sheppard found the guidelines to be \na “comprehensive policy for managing dysphagia and for individual care”.  Tr. at 3306, 3307 \n(Sheppard); Def. Ex. 347.   \n  CHDC’s guidelines for management of dysphagia certainly meet accepted professional \npractice as found by Dr. Sheppard.  “And in some respects were best practice.”  Tr. at 3311, \n  231\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 232 of 383\n3312 (Sheppard); Def. Ex. 347.  The concern for quality of life was “best practice quality.”  The \nstandardized tools for the modified barium swallow were at least accepted professional \nstandards.  The procedures regarding timelines and responsibility of timelines and the reflux \nprecautions met accepted professional standards.  Tr. at 3312, 3313 (Sheppard).  Dr. Kastner \ntestified that gastroesphageal reflux is appropriately managed at CHDC.  Tr. at 4078 (Kastner).  \nHe also felt that dysphagia and feeding practices were appropriately managed.  Tr. at 4078 \n(Kastner).   \n  CHDC provides individualized risk assessments for dysphagia.  CHDC uses a dysphagia \ndisorder survey.  Plaintiff’s e xpert, Ms. Crawford, had no concerns with respect to the survey.   \nShe acknowledged that the survey  was created by one of Defenda nts’ experts, Justine Joan \nSheppard.  Tr. at 2918, 2919 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford herself admitted that Dr. Sheppard is a \nrespected expert in the area of dysphagia.  Tr. at 2919 (Crawford).   \n  Associated with the dysphagia assessment are other risk assessments used by CHDC.  \nThere are three (3) standardized assessment tools: the choking risk assessment, pneumonia risk \nassessment, and dysphagia disorder survey.  “All three are used. They’re all administered, at \nleast annually and more frequently in cases of incident, when there is a need, a changing in \nfunction.”  Tr. at 3307, 3308 (Crawford).  The Risk Assessment for Choking for Oral Eaters, the \nPnuemonia Risk Assessment, and the Dysphagia Management Staging Scale are standardized \ninstruments for the developmentally disabled.  Tr. at 3310, 3311 (Sheppard); Def. Ex. 288, 289, \n290.  “[I]t was important that we develop tools that were standardized on the population and not \nuse tools that have been used for people who for instance have eaten normally all their lives and \nthen had a stroke and have dysphagia.”  Tr. at 3311 (Sheppard).  \n  232\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 233 of 383\n  Informal swallowing and feeding assessments were conducted at CHDC within the first \nseven (7) days of entering CHDC, depending on level of need.  “[Y]ou have got that first few \ndays of getting people used to being there and, before you really want to subject them to any \nformal testing.”  Tr. at 3329, 3330 (Sheppard).  The screening done within thirty (30) days of \nadmission is different than the informal assessment.  “The screening tools that -- the quick tests \nthat were used and then the formal assessment is -- the clinical dysphagia evaluation involves \nparticipation - -the interdisciplinary participation of the various specialists who will look at \nvarious components of the -- of the problems that the individual is having.”  Tr. at 3330 \n(Sheppard).    Whether an individual is referred for a barium swallow is up to the physician.  \n“The physician is the only one that can order that.”  Tr. at 6414 (Henderson). The Central \nDysphagia Committee may request that the physician consider ordering a barium enema.  Tr. at \n6414, 6415 (Henderson).  Dr. Kastner found that barium swallows were preformed in a timely \nfashion.  Tr. at 4307 (Kastner). \n  With respect to the clinical dysphagia evaluation, it “includes a valuation of the \ncontributing causes of the problem as well as a description of the problem itself.  The quick tests, \nthe dysphagia disorder survey and the dysphagia staging scale … tell you what was - - what the \nfunction is.  But it doesn’t tell you what is causing any functional difficulties.”  Tr. at 3331 \n(Sheppard).  Everyone at CHDC receives a clinical dysphagia assessment annually.  Tr. at 3331 \n(Sheppard).  Upon admission, “If the quick tests indicate that the individual did have dysphagia, \nthen there would be a clinical dysphagia evaluation.”  Tr. at 3331 (Sheppard).  The speech \npathologist, the dietician, the physical therapist, the occupational therapist and the nurse perform \nthe dysphagia evaluation.  Tr. at 3331, 3332 (Sheppard).  The evaluations were, according to Dr. \n  233\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 234 of 383\nSheppard: “…really a best practices model.  What I saw in record after record consistently was \nthat these reports, that evaluations were responsive to events.”  Tr. at 3333 (Sheppard). \n[T]he clinical dysphagia evaluations where the various specialty \nareas would do their evaluations, submit their reports, and have \nthese reports integrated by - - into the IPP is certainly an accepted \nprofessional practice.  And the aspects of swallowing and feeding \nproblems that needed to be noted were noted and then were put in \nthis overall document that guided care.  So that’s an accepted \npractice. \n \nTr. at 3333 (Sheppard).    \nTheir collaboration with the community is a good - - is really a \nbest practices model.  So I think that we have here a –an \nassessment program that is in some aspects best practices and in \nsome aspects accepted professional practice.  It’s a good program. \n  \nTr. at 3333, 3334 (Sheppard).   \nPart of CHDC’s management of dysphagia includes monitoring of dysphagia throughout \nCHDC.  The Central Dysphagia Committee reviews dysphagia, among other matters.  It meets \naccepted professional standards in terms of process, oversight, quality monitoring, and direct \nimplications of treatment. Tr. at 5954, 5955 (Walsh).  It is a very good quality management and \nrisk management program at CHDC. Tr. at 5955 (Walsh).  The Central Dysphagia Committee \nfunctions as a quality assurance committee.  It is chaired by a registered nurse.  Linda \nHenderson, the Quality Improvement Nurse and director of nursing, is the chair of the Central \nDysphagia Committee.  Tr. at 3313 , 5313,  6389 (Sheppard, Hancock, Henderson).   The \nfollowing other individuals comprise the Central Dysphagia Committee: a staff development \nnurse, the primary care physicians, four speech therapists, three clinical therapists, and the \nclinical supervisor, an OT, a PT, a dietician, a human rights committee chairperson, a living unit \nsupervisor representative, the infection control nurse, an administrative representative, the \ndentist, the dental hygienist, and program coordinator.  Tr. at 6402, 3313 (Henderson, Sheppard).  \n  234\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 235 of 383\nThe Central Dysphasia Committee meets monthly and makes recommendations to the \ninterdisciplinary team, including the physician. Tr. at 5954 (Walsh). \n    Dr. Sheppard observed a Central Dysphagia Committee meeting.  She found the \n“discussions were informed with very substantial documentation.”  Tr. at 3314 (Sheppard).  The \nCentral Dysphagia Committee “fulfilled the functions that it’s designed for as a best practices \ncommittee was really very good.”  Tr. at 3315 Sheppard. The Central Dysphagia Committee is \nnot a reactionary committee.  It is a peer review, quality assurance committee.  Tr. at 3401 \nSheppard).   \n   Ms. Hancock, a PT, sat on the Central Dysphagia Committee even before it was called \nthe Central Dysphagia Committee (previously it was called the Specialized Eating Committee.)   \n[T]he primary role of the physical therapist and the whole process \nis related to positioning and alignment.  It’s just a piece or \ncomponent of the overall assessment process that’s performed.  \nEach area has different components that they provide the \ninformation to that’s all compiled together by the speech \npathologist.  They do a significant portion of that with input from \nthe other areas related to their specific field of expertise, nursing \nprovides portions of that, which all work together as a team to \nmake sure that we are providing the most appropriate mealtime \ndecisions for each individual person. \n \nTr. at 5312, 5313 (Hancock). \n  The Central Dysphagia Committee functions as a consultant and advisory body to the \nIDT regarding dysphagia and swallowing disorders.  The Committee serves to support the team \nas well as make recommendations to the team and the primary care physicians.  Tr. at 6389 \n(Henderson).  The Central Dysphagia Committee reviews all airway events such as changes in \nrisk factors, choking events, and difficult swallowing events.  It reviews cases referred by any \nCommittee member, the IRCs, the IDTs, and the medical department.  The Committee also \nreviews cases of pneumonia and those who were on ventilators at a hospital.  Tr. at 6389 \n  235\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 236 of 383\n(Henderson).  The committee follows a general agenda each meeting.  First, follow-up and \nupdates from the previous meeting are reviewed, especially with respect to individual cases.  \nThen, changes in risk factors, choking events, difficult swallowing events, referral cases, \npneumonias, ventilator cases are reviewed.  Lastly, procedures, equipment, quality improvement \nor assurance matters are reviewed.  Tr. at 6402, 6403 (Henderson).   \n \nCHOKING INCIDENTS AND DIFFICULT SWALLOWING EVENTS \n  CHDC identifies residents with choking risks and takes precautions to reduce and, when \npossible, eliminate choking incidents and difficult swallowing events.  CHDC exercises \nprofessional judgment with respect to assessment and management of choking and difficult \nswallowing events.  But for, perhaps, a few isolated incidents, no examples of harm due to \nfailure to identify choking risks, or failure to protect those who have difficulty swallowing, have \nbeen proven.        \n  A difficult swallowing event is when no intervention is required.  There is no acute \nchange in vital signs or no symptoms of airway obstruction, such as change in skin color, eye’s \nprotruding, dizziness, change in level of consciousness, unable to speak or make a sound.   \nThe events are strangling or severe coughing.  During this event, \nthe body’s protections are in place.  If we were to talk about it in \nthe vernacular, I would say, ‘It went down the wrong way.’ \n \nTr. at 6390 (Henderson). \nThe definition for choking is a partial or complete obstruction of \nthe airway due to a foreign body, such as food or non-edibles.  The \nonset of respiratory distress may be sudden with coughing.  There \nmay be agitation in the early stages of airway obstruction.  The \nsigns of respiratory distress included labored, ineffective breathing \nuntil the person can no longer breathe, and loss of consciousness \nwill occur if the obstruction is not relieved.  \n      \n  236\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 237 of 383\nTr. at 6402 (Henderson).   \n  Seventy four percent (74%) of the residents at CHDC present as a high choking risk, per \nCHDC risk assessment.  Tr. at 3303 (Sheppard).  The CHDC choking risk assessment was \nstatistically validated, “standardized and validated on this population.”  Tr. at 3304 (Sheppard).  \nWhile seventy four percent (74%) of the residents presented a choking risk in 2009,  only 2.17 % \nof the population experienced choking events that required assistance.  As Dr. Sheppard \nobserved: “So that in spite of the high levels of risk in the population, the management was such \nthat you have this rather small percentage actually experiencing that level of choking in that one \nyear.”  Tr. at 3304 (Sheppard).   \n  CHDC’s choking assessment is part of the initial thirty (30) day assessment.  Tr. at 3330 \n(Sheppard).   CHDC looks at indicators such as a person’s choking history, their choking risk \nassessment scores, x-rays, and whether they are tube fed when considering that individual’s \nchoking risk factor.  Tr. at 6395, 6396 (Henderson).  The choking risk is communicated to the \nprogram coordinator.  The IDT incorporates it into their plan.  The risk is listed on the diet sheet \nthat is used in the living unit.  Tr. at 6396 (Henderson).  The information on choking risk is \nshared with the IDT, the team leader, the program coordinator, the dietary staff, the nursing staff, \nand the psychology department.  Tr. at 6396 (Henderson).   \nAfter a choking episode, there will be a modified barium swallow \ndone, a choking episode that requires assistance to clear.  And then \nafter a choking episode, often whether it requires assistance to \nclear or not, a speech pathologist will go in to observe the patient \nor the individual, the resident, at a meal and then report on any \nproblem that is seen or any conditions that are apparent, any need \nfor change in practice, in mealtime practice. \n \nTr. at 3332, 3333 (Sheppard).   \n  237\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 238 of 383\nIf an individual has a choking episode, the speech language pathologist staff assesses the \nnext meal.  Alignment is considered and may be referred to the PT department for further \nassessment.  Tr. at 5278, 5279 (Hancock).  CHDC staff provides instructions to staff after \nreviewing choking incidences.  Tr. at 5391 (Johnson).  Speech staff follow-up on any medical \nmanagement that may be indicated as a result of a choking incident.  A special staffing may be \nheld.  Tr. at 5391, 5392 (Johnson). \nThe follow-up by speech could include updating the choking risk \nassessment if the level changes, updating the dysphagia disorder \nsurvey, modifying the diet or liquids with a referral to dietetics, \nchanging adaptive eating equipment with referral to occupational \ntherapy, altering positioning with referral to physical therapy, \nrevising the eating plan, referring for a swallow study by referral to \na physician, staff in-service training.  It could be a \nrecommendation for increased supervision that would be referral to \nthe team.  It could be referral to the physician for additional \nmedical assessment or intervention or it could be a referral to the \npsychological examiner. \n     \nTr. at 5392 (Johnson).   \nAfter a choking incident, a resident is followed up by speech pathology staff.  Tr. at 5397 \n(Johnson).  Also, after a choking incident, the choking risk level may change, which entails a \nnew choking risk assessment.  Tr. at 5397, 5398 (Johnson).  \n  When there is a choking event, first aid or a code is called if necessary.  If a physician is \nnot present, one physician will be called.  The individual will go to the clinic and the physician \nor registered nurse will make a determination if the individual’s diet should be modified prior to \nthe speech therapist’s evaluation.  A red sticker is placed on the diet sheet and communications \nare documented in the log book.  The sticker is not removed until the speech therapist has \ncompleted the evaluation.  Tr. at 6394 (Henderson).   So, when a choking event is identified, the \ninitial response is to provide first aid.  Then, dietary changes may be made.  A speech therapist \n  238\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 239 of 383\nevaluates the individual and sends her findings to the physician.  The therapist also engages in a \ncore meeting with some of the Central Dysphagia Committee members.  The team also conducts \na special staffing to make any recommendations to the 24 hour schedule or treatment plan.  The \nCentral Dysphagia Committee also reviews the event.  A swallow study may be conducted in the \nmeantime.  Sometimes the matter is referred to a gastrointestinal physician, or reflux precautions \nare implemented.  Tr. at 6397, 6398 (Henderson).  Sometimes, before the Central Dysphagia \nCommittee even meets, diet, procedure or equipment changes are made in the interim.  Tr. at \n6398 (Henderson).   \n  Normally, the speech pathologist makes her evaluation at the very next meal.  It is \npossible, though, if the choking occurred during dinner on a Friday, that the evaluation would not \ntake place until few days later.  “However, an RN has evaluated the person, they’ve informed the \ndoctor, and any changes that need to be made in the meantime can be made.”  Tr. at 6422 \n(Henderson).   The speech therapist always makes mealtime observations following a choking.  \nUsing a standardized form, the therapist evaluates such things as the food, the swallow, the \nbehaviors, the size of food and how handled by the person, and the consistency of the fluid.  Tr. \nat 6398, 6399 (Henderson).   \n  CHDC also reviews difficult swallowing events.  The speech therapist reviews a \nswallowing event much like that of a choking event.  A core team evaluates the difficult swallow \nand diet changes are considered.  Eating is a pleasure for CHDC residents, so CHDC tries to \nminimize chopped or blended diets unless absolutely necessary.  Tr. at 6399 (Henderson).   \n  Thus, CHDC adequately responds to choking incidents and then monitors individuals for \nany future intervention. Routine observations are performed by professional staff to document \nchoking concerns.  Such documentation includes annual dysphagia disorder survey and choking \n  239\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 240 of 383\nrisk assessment; speech monitoring; food service audit reports; mealtime monitoring forms; and \nprogram coordinator monitoring objectives.  Tr. at 5392 (Johnson).   \n  All of CHDC’s techniques to monitor and document choking are proactive.   \n \nWe would have individualized diets and diet textures, proper \npositioning during meal times, and all instances of oral intake. The \nuse of adaptive eating equipment to facilitate intake in a safe \nmanner. Nutrition by tube when oral intake is unsafe or inadequate. \nImplementation of eating plans with procedures that are individual \nspecific. In-service training of staff regarding eating plans, diet \nconsistencies, choking prevention and other pertinent topics. \nIdentification of choking and pneumonia risks to increase staff \nawareness, medical management of rumination, reflux, and other \nconditions impacting oral intake, and referral for medical tests and \nprocedures including but not limited to swallow studies, upper GIs, \nand esophagrams. \n \nTr. at 5393 (Johnson).   \n  Choking risk levels are also monitored over time.  The team RN documents any changes \nin scores from year to year, from any events, from any swallow studies, et cetera, and also seeks \nrecommendations from the IDT.  The RN then transmits this information by means of a progress \nnote to the physician.  Tr. at 6397 (Henderson).  The choking risk is listed on the QRG.  Tr. at \n6396 (Henderson).  There are times when documentation is not consistent though.  For example, \nan individual’s risk may change as the result of a choking risk assessment and it takes some time \nfor the quick reference guide to be changed in accordance with the modified risk assessment.  Tr. \nat 5396 (Johnson). \n  Monitoring of choking and difficult swallows also takes place via the Central Dysphagia \nCommittee. The Central Dysphagia Committee reviews all difficult swallowing events and all \nchoking events.  Tr. at 6391 (Henderson).  Prior to the committee meeting, Ms. Henderson \nreviews the clinical record to gather information and complete a form that is used by the \nCommittee.  The form indicates the history of choking events, history of difficult swallowing \n  240\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 241 of 383\nevents, yearly choking and pneumonia assessment risk, any x-ray studies or diagnosis of any \nswallowing abnormalities or follow-through studies such as EGD’s or GI’s.  Respiratory status \nand spinal issues are also reviewed.  Past history of pneumonia and aspiration are reviewed. GI \nand oral disorders, such as GERD, gastritis, esophagitis, and constipation are reviewed.  Any \nhistory of ileus, hietal hernia, gastric ulcer, H. pylori infection is reviewed.  Strictures of the \nesophagus and gingivitis are reviewed.  Precautions and interventions already in place are \nconsidered, such as reflux precautions, pneumonia vaccine, GI disorders, diet, food, texture, size, \nfluid consistencies.  Altered nutrition, such as a g-tube is considered, or if they have drainage, \nNPO, potential for oral intake, whether they are fed by a pump, the speed, duration, and whether \nthey are bolus fed.  Oral hygiene and dental care are also considered.  Tr. at 6391, 6392 \n(Henderson). \n  The Central Dysphagia Committee meets formally once a month.  The committee also \nmeets more often if needed.  “If there is a choking event or difficult swallowing event, there will \nbe a core team meeting.”  The core team usually consists of Ms. Henderson, the speech therapist, \nthe dietician, and the physician.  If not an in person meeting, communication will occur through \ntelephone calls.  Tr. at 6392, 6393 (Henderson).  If a difficult swallowing event occurs, the \nCentral Dysphagia Committee would discuss that event at their very next meeting.  Tr. at 6393 \n(Henderson). Individual specific cases are also discussed at the Central Dysphagia Committee \nmeetings.  Tr. at 6393 (Henderson).   \n  In the interim between a difficult swallowing event and the review of the event at the \nCentral Dysphagia Committee meeting, the speech therapist evaluates the individual and \ndetermines whether it is safe for the individual to eat and the type of diet they should be eating.  \nThe therapist then communicates with the dietician regarding any interventions.  Also, a \n  241\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 242 of 383\nphysician, dietician, or speech therapist may request a swallow study.  The speech therapist’s \nevaluation usually occurs at the very next meal.  Tr. at 6393 (Henderson).  Even before the \nspeech therapist conducts the evaluation, a registered nurse examines the individual.  Tr. at 6394 \n(Henderson).  In response to the claim that CHDC was not meeting professional standards with \nrespect to the Central Dysphagia Committee meeting 30 days after a choking event, Dr. \nSheppard responded: \nSo following the choking event … within two days … and often on \nthe same day, the person has been seen by the speech pathologist \nand has been observed in a meal, the IDT meets - - the \ninterdisciplinary team for that person and the residence meets and \nmakes all the changes in program.  The doctor - - the nurse has \nseen the person immediately.  They do all the interventions that are \nneeded and then their interventions are reviewed in this committee \nmeeting.  So that 30 days later or 2 months, whatever, later it \noccurs.  They are acting as a quality assurance committee to review \nwhat has been done in a very timely way following the event. \n \nTr. at 3315 (Sheppard). \n  The fact that the Central Dysphagia Committee Minutes dated February 6, 2008, \n(Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1052-2) did not include any recommendations from A.R.’s choking does not \nmean that there was nothing done at CHDC in response to her choking and death.  As Dr. \nSheppard noted, “certainly, they considered it and in the considering of it came to conclusions \nnot in the minutes.”  Tr. at 3405, 3406 (Sheppard).  In fact, CHDC conducted preventive \nmeasures following A.R.’s choking event and passing.  There was a plan of correction, effective \nimmediately, that all individuals that sleep in the day rooms be provided with constant \nsupervision.  The plan of correction also called for in-service training including a presentation \nand competency-based testing.  “So it’s a complex response to the event, and a correction plan \nthat had occurred to that event that was then reviewed … by the central dysphagia committee \nwith no comment except that is had been reviewed.”  Tr. at 3444, 3446 (Sheppard); Pl. Ex. 309.  \n  242\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 243 of 383\nThe Central Dysphagia Committee did not make extensive comment on the choking incident \ninvolving A.R. because the administrative review process handled the review and follow up.  Tr. \nat 5398 (Johnson).   \n  The Central Dysphagia Committee meets monthly.  All incidents of choking are \naddressed.  “Usually everything has already been done prior to that meeting.  We just discuss it \nin that meeting.”  Tr. at 5279, 5314 (Hancock).  The Central Dysphagia Committee reviews \nincidents of pneumonia and choking and risk factors.  The committee discusses the information \nand precautions that should be in place.  Tr. at 5314 (Hancock).   \n  A swallowing event at CHDC is generally anytime a resident has choked, coughed, or not \nbeen able to swallow food. Tr. at 5954 (Walsh).  When a swallowing event occurs at CHDC, it is \nreported to the unit nurse and reported to the RN supervisor, who decides if the person needs to \nbe seen by a physician. Tr. at 5954 (Walsh).  If a swallowing event occurs at CHDC, it will be \nreviewed by the Central Dysphagia Committee regardless of whether it is referred to a physician. \nTr. at 5954 (Walsh).  If a swallowing event is referred to a physician, that physician will follow \nup, but a speech therapist will also go out to the residence and observe the resident’s next meal \nand make recommendations based on their observations and discussions with staff. Tr. at 5954 \n(Walsh).  Swallowing events are reported to Ms. Henderson via a progress note containing the \nevent, what was choked on/difficult to swallow, the vital signs, time of day, and interventions.  \nMs. Henderson is usually telephoned for purposes of notification as well.  Ms. Henderson \ncommunicates with the dietician, speech therapist, as well as the physician.  Tr. at 6394, 6395 \n(Henderson).  \n  As additional monitoring, the Central Dysphagia Committee reviews individuals who \nhave had a change in choking risk factors. Tr. at 6399 (Henderson).  Even if someone has not \n  243\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 244 of 383\nhad a choking or difficult swallowing event, he or she can be referred to the Central Dysphagia \ncommittee for review.  Any member of that person’s IDT, any medical professional, or any \nprogram coordinator can make the referral.  Tr. at 6400 (Henderson).  Prior to 2009, the \nCommittee did not delineate difficult swallowing events and choking events, they considered \nboth together as choking events.  Tr. at 6421 (Henderson).  \n  As chairperson of the Central Dsyphagia Committee, Ms. Henderson verifies any \nchanges of diet or adaptive equipment per a choking event.  Tr. at 6423 (Henderson).  \nProfessionals, other than the Chair of the Central Dysphagia Committee, provide quality \nassurance in making sure staff is implementing any changes to the diet order sheets.  Tr. at 6424, \n6425 (Henderson).  Direct care staff is aware of individuals who meet the high risk criteria for \nchoking and provide higher monitoring of the protections in place.  Tr. at 6429 (Henderson).   \nPrecautions would have been put in place if an individual were identified in the high risk \ncategory.  “Our policy is that if somebody scores 50 percent or greater on their pneumonia risk or \ntheir choking risk, that it is our policy that we do a swallow study.”  Tr. at 6429 (Henderson).     \n  CHDC also does review trends with respect to choking and pneumonia.  Tr. at 6395 \n(Henderson).  The Central Dysphagia Committee created a database of CHDC residents who \nexhibit dysphagia and gastrointestinal reflux related problems. Tr. at 5954 (Walsh).  While Ms. \nHenderson does keep a database, her best source of information is derived from her clinical \nrecords and review, and not from her database.  “My database is primarily for my use.”  Tr. at \n6416 (Henderson).  The accuracy of the database is dependent upon the accuracy of the progress \nnotes from which she enters the data.  Tr. at 6416, 6417 (Henderson).  Program coordinators and \nthe RN review information from Ms. Henderson’s database.  They notify her with any errors.  Tr. \nat 6417, 6418 (Henderson).  When an individual dies or leaves the facility, they are removed \n  244\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 245 of 383\nfrom the database.  However, Ms. Henderson maintains the hard copies of those individuals who \nhave had choking events.  “So I physically write down, I have a list, a running list of people who \nhave had choking events since 6-07.”  Tr. at 6419 (Henderson).  Ms. Henderson uses the hand-\ndone list for the number of chokings.  Tr. at 6420 (Henderson).    \n  CHDC strives to prevent and reduce choking incidents.  However, even with meeting \nevery precaution, it is inevitable that with this population chokings may occur.  Choking \nincidents have been reduced every year that the Central Dysphagia Committee has been in \nexistence at CHDC, and from 2007 to 2009 choking incidents have been reduced over 50 \npercent. Tr. at 5955(Walsh). \n  Plaintiff’s expert provided no benchmarks or standards on choking rates in comparable \nsettings to CHDC.  Ms. Crawford did not know the number of choking incidents that occurred at \nICF/MRs where she had worked.  Tr. at 2923, 2924 (Crawford).  She did not know what rate of \nchoking incidents could reasonably be expected to occur in a facility such as CHDC.  Tr. at \n2924.  Ms. Crawford did not know if the rate for choking incidents at CHDC is higher or lower \nthan what is observed in nursing homes.  Tr. at 2924 (Crawford).   \n  Ms. Crawford referred to a facility of 300 residents, the San Antonio State Supported \nLiving Center, that she claims had zero incidents of choking in a six-month period.  Tr. at 2924 \n(Crawford).  Even though other Plaintiff’s experts in this matter questioned CHDC’s \nunderreporting or inadequate systems based on the low numbers for injuries and restraints, Ms. \nCrawford would not assume that San Antonio was underreporting.  She would not assume that \nthey have an inadequate system for identifying or reporting choking.  Tr. at 2926 (Crawford).  \nMs. Crawford had no other numbers from San Antonio regarding the rate of aspiration \npneumonia, fractures, decubiti, mortality, et cetera.  Tr. at 2926, 2927(Crawford).  Ms. Crawford \n  245\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 246 of 383\ndid not know the number of choking incidents at San Antonio for the last two-year period.  Tr. at \n2926, 2927 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford did not know at San Antonio how many individuals had \ndysphagia, were in wheelchairs, had special diets, had epilepsy, or choking deaths within the last \ntwo years.  Tr. at 2927 (Crawford).      \n  Furthermore, in an effort to demonstrate harm from choking events at CHDC, Ms. \nCrawford inappropriately relied upon isolated incidents or events outside of CHDC’s control.  \nFor example: \n•  S.N. \nRegarding S.N.’s choking, Ms. Crawford was asked if it is appropriate to include an \nincident that occurred outside the premises of CHDC and outside the supervision of CHDC.  Ms. \nCrawford responded: \nIn my deposition, I said I do believe that as a facility we are \nresponsible for individuals, regardless where they are at the time, \nand that -- I also said that it's important that the facility provide \ninformation to the family to help them understand the \nrecommended diet textures and assistance techniques for each -- \nfor their child. \n \nTr. at 2935 (Crawford). Ms. Crawford did not know if she included any residents other than S.N., \nwhere the choking occurred outside of CHDC, at the family’s home, for example, in her choking \nnumbers.  Tr. at 2935 (Crawford).   \n•  J.G. \n    Ms. Crawford agreed that if J.G. has not had a choking incident since 1986, that is \ndemonstrative that CHDC is doing some good management of his eating.  Tr. at 2937, 2938 \n(Crawford). \n•  J.F. \n  246\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 247 of 383\n  The speech pathologist’s review of J.F. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1022) was a few days \nfollowing the choking incident.  Dr Sheppard found: “That’s still well within a best practices \nkind of - - or at least accepted professional practice routine.”   \nWhat you have is, you have the nursing staff looking at the \nindividual immediately after the event or maybe even during the \nevent, and what it says here is that the nurse found – the individual \npatient at that point, resident, was doing fine, with no evidence of \nany problem, and that he returned to his normal routine. \n \nTr. at 3436 (Sheppard).   \n•  J.W.R. \n  Regarding a choking episode of J.W.R. (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 988), the nurse had checked \nhim immediately.  Tr. at 3440 (Sheppard).   \n•  A.R. \n  CHDC conducted preventive measures following A.R.’s choking event and passing.  \nThere was a plan of correction, effective immediately, that all individuals that sleep in the \ndayrooms be provided with constant supervision.  The plan of correction also called for in-\nservice training including a presentation and competency-based testing.  “So it’s a complex \nresponse to the event, and a correction plan that had occurred to that event that was then \nreviewed … by the central dysphagia committee with no comment except that is had been \nreviewed.”  Tr. at 3444-3446 (Sheppard); Pl. Ex. 309.  Regarding the choking of A.R. in 2008, \nan immediate administrative review was conducted from the team’s perspective.  They also \nevaluated the dysphagia care she had been receiving. Protections were in place and proper \nassessments had been performed.  It was found that this was more of a residential issue than \ndysphagia issue. Thus, the Central Dysphagia Committee minutes did not reflect everything that \n  247\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 248 of 383\nwas reviewed or evaluated.  Tr. at 6440, 6441 (Henderson).  Swallowing itself was not the issue, \nthe lack of staff monitoring of A.R. was the issue.  Tr. at 6442 (Sheppard).         \n  Ms. Crawford commented on the number of choking incidences at CHDC as being \nshocking.  However, the actual numbers do not support her opinion.     \nThere are 500 individuals and they have 3 meals a day, that’s \ngoing to be 1500.  Then if you multiply those 1500 meals by 365 \ndays a year, that will put you at 547,500.  Then if we just add one \nmedication pass for each of those individuals, that’s going to put \nthe number at 548,000.  And that doesn’t include the other \nmedication passes or snacks or anything like that.  So in 2009, \nthere were eight choking incidences at CHDC.  So when you \ncompare those eight incidences with over 548,000 potential \nchoking opportunities, I think the shock is there were not more.  I \nthink that speaks well that the number is so low, considering all the \nopportunities there would be to choke, especially if you counted \neach bite per meal that an individual might take. \n \nTr. at 5445, 5446 (Johnson). \nThere appears to be a spike in the number of chokings in 2007, but 2007 is when the \nCommittee initially started keeping choking data for every choking event and went back to \nreview the history of choking events.  In 2008 there was a drop in the number of choking events.  \nIn 2007, it was “the diligence and the education of our staff that we saw a spike, as you would \nnormally see when you start to collect data.”  Tr. at 6400, 6401 (Henderson).  The 2008 choking \ndata is accurate.  Ms. Henderson herself reviewed every case during 2008 and reviewed them \nwith physicians.  Tr. at 6401 (Henderson). \n  The testimony on the number of choking incidents (that is 24 in 2007, 18 in 2008, and 11 \nin 2009) is accurate pursuant to the information possessed by Ms. Henderson.  Tr. at 6439 \n(Henderson).  However, the numbers of chokings in 2007 to those in 2009 are not comparable.   \nIn 2007, that would have been every event that occurred, including \ndifficult swallowing events.  In 2009, we broke it down so that we \ncould look at the exact situation that occurred with that person.  So \n  248\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 249 of 383\nin 2009, you have difficult swallowing events and then you have \nchoking events. \n \nTr. at 6439, 6440 (Henderson). \n \n  PNEUMONIA \n  CHDC assesses risk of, provides preventative care for, adequately treats, and monitors \npneumonia.  The evidence demonstrates that CHDC exercises professional judgment in its \nmanagement of pneumonia.  CHDC has a pneumonia risk assessment.  The pneumonia risk \nassessment is part of the initial thirty (30) day assessment.  Tr. at 3330, 3331 (Sheppard).  The \nnursing staff completes the pneumonia risk assessments.  Tr. at 5392 (Johnson).  The nurses are \nconstantly assessing the residents, especially those at high risk, for signs and symptoms of \npneumonia.  Tr. at 6427, 6428 (Henderson).  CHDC provides preventive care for pneumonia.  \nTr. at 5382 (Gardner).   Preventive pneumonia care includes yearly risk assessments by a \nregistered nurse.  The assessments consider their age, any dysphagia diagnosis, how they receive \ntheir nutrition, any history of smoking, and any oral disorders.  Tr. at 5382, 5383 (Gardner). \nPreventive care includes: reflux precautions, that is elevation of the head by 30 degrees or \nstaying upright after meals for 30 minutes to an hour, oral care consisting of Listerine or Peridex, \nand the use of PPI, a protein pump inhibitor medication.  Preventive care also includes a \npneumonia shot and a yearly flu shot.  Tr. at 5383 (Gardner).  CHDC also uses mouthwash as a \npneumonia precaution.   \nMouthwash will decrease the number of bacteria that are in the \nmouth.  So if the person is to reflux or if they aspirate their own \nsaliva, then there is less bacteria in their saliva, so it decreases the \nchances of that person developing a pneumonia from their own \nsaliva. \n \n  249\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 250 of 383\nTr. at 6437 (Henderson).   Frequency of dental visits also reduces the risk of pneumonia.  “Our \nclients see the dentist or the dental hygienist at least every three months.”  Tr. at 6437 \n(Henderson).   \n  From June 1, 2008 to July 24, 2009, there were  two (2) individuals  transferred to the \nhospital for aspiration pneumonia.  Tr. at 2942 (Crawford); Pl. Ex. 1037.  There are other causes \nof pneumonia other than aspiration.  Tr. at 2943 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford conceded that many \nof the pneumonias that she considered m ay have no relationship to  aspiration.  Tr. at 2943 \n(Crawford).   Ms. Cra wford  did not know the  number  of individuals, who she listed with \npneumonias, who had no relationship to aspiration or feeding problems.  Tr. at 2944 (Crawford).   \n  Some of the risk indicators for pneumonia are dysphagia, poor oral care, receipt of \nnutrition from a gastrostomy tube, an excessive dry mouth or excessive secretions, a history of \npneumonia over the previous five years, or an age over 40.  Tr. at 5384 (Gardner).  The physician \nmakes the diagnosis of pneumonia.  Tr. at 5384 (Gardner).  A diagnosis of pneumonia is made \nby physician assessment and chest X-rays.  Tr. at 5384 (Gardner).  Ms. Crawford has no medical \nexpertise that would allow her to diagnose pneumonia or to determine its cause.  Once a \ndiagnosis of pneumonia is made, CHDC takes several steps for treatment depending on the \ncondition of the patient.  The residents can be treated at the CHDC infirmary with oxygen or \nbreathing treatments.  If the condition worsens, the physician may decide that the resident should \nbe transported to the hospital for treatment.  Oral antibiotics or IV antibiotics are usually \nprescribed.  Tr. at 5384 (Gardner).  If the resident is treated at the hospital for pneumonia, upon \nreturn to CHDC, their care will be followed up.  If they left from the infirmary, they will return \nto the infirmary for a few days.  If they were admitted to the hospital from their unit or sick call, \nthey will return and be seen by a physician.  The physician will then determine the course of \n  250\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 251 of 383\ntreatment and whether treatment should take place at the unit or in the infirmary.  Tr. at 5385 \n(Gardner).  At the clinic, the recovery of pneumonia is monitored.  The physician will follow-up \nto ensure the pneumonia is clear, and there could be follow-up X-rays or laboratory work.  Tr. at \n5385 (Gardner).  If someone is diagnosed with pneumonia, a physician is always involved in the \ncare and treatment.  Tr. at 6413 (Henderson). The teams, the RNs, the LPNs, and the physician, \nmonitor a resident following a case of pneumonia. “It’s professional judgment by those treating \nstaff.”  Tr. at 6425 (Henderson).     \n  As an OT, Ms. Crawford is not perm itted to order diagnostic testing as to pneumonia or \nto prescribe treatment or medication for pneumonia.  Tr. at 2941 (Crawford).  Thus, she is not \nthe appropriate person for m aking determinations as to whethe r professional judgments have \nbeen exercised in these areas.   Ms. Crawford was unable to identify any specific instances where \nstaff at CHDC failed to exerci se reasonable professional judgm ent in the m anagement of a \nspecific individual with aspiration pneum onia or pneumonia.  She was unable to speak to the \nmedical or nursing m anagement of the pneumoni as.  Tr. at 2944, 2945  (Crawford).  CHDC \nmonitors  pneumonia  throughout the facility.   The Central Dysphag ia  Committee  reviews \npneumonia cases.  Tr. at 6400, 6411 (Henderson).   The Central Dysphagia Comm ittee reviews \ncases where the individual is placed on a ventilator.  The Committee evaluates them the first day \nthey return from the hospital after being placed on a ventilator.  Many ti mes, CHDC refers the \nindividual for a swallow study as well.  After recuperation, another swallow study is performed.  \nTr. at 6400 (Henderson).   \n  The Central Dysphagia Committee began reviewing cases of pneumonia when Linda \nHenderson began chairing the Committee in January of 2009.  The Committee reorganized with \na more clinical focus.  Tr. at 6411, 6412 (Henderson).  Before 2009, the Central Dysphagia \n  251\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 252 of 383\nCommittee did not review individual cases of pneumonia.  The infection control nurse and the \nInfection Control Committee reviewed the cases before 2009.  They did not necessarily review \neach individual case, as the Dysphagia Committee now does, but they reviewed the numbers of \nthe cases.  Tr. at 6413 (Henderson).  Prior to 2008, the team reviewed high-risk individuals for \npneumonia.  Tr. at 6414 (Henderson).           \n  The Central Dysphagia Committee reviews the interventions in place, all the clinical \ninformation, and makes their own evaluation.  The Committee considers whether there are any \nadditional recommendations that they can make to the IDT to help prevent pneumonia.  Tr. at \n6412 (Henderson).  The program coordinator representative documents the minutes of the \nCentral Dysphagia Committee meetings.  The minutes are taken back to the Committee for \napproval.  Then, the chairperson signs off on them.  Tr. at 6412 (Henderson).  The Central \nDysphagia Committee acts as an advisory committee to the IDT with respect to pneumonias.  \n“The team - - they’re nurses, they’re doctors, they’re dieticians, they’re speech therapists, they’re \ndirect care staff - - they evaluate and treat pneumonias.”  Tr. at 6413 (Henderson).   \n  The Central Dysphagia Committee and the Infection Control Committee interact.  The \ninfection control nurse, as well as other members, is a member of both committees.  The \ninfection control nurse maintains the data on the pneumonias and provides the committees with \ninformation on diagnoses, x-rays, or hospitalizations.  Tr. at 6413, 6414 (Henderson).   \n  The Dysphagia Committee will follow individuals one (1) to three (3) months after \ndiagnosis of pneumonia and the Committee will assess their respiratory status.  The team will \ncontinue to evaluate and treat the pneumonia.  Tr. at 6414 (Henderson).     \n  Trends of pneumonia are reviewed.  Ms. Henderson does not track pneumonia in her \ndatabase, but the infection control nurse does in her database.  Tr. at 6427 (Henderson).  \n  252\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 253 of 383\nPlaintiff’s expert provided no benchmarks and lacked sufficient knowledge for making any \nsound conclusions as to CHDC and its management of pneumonia.   Ms. Crawford did not know \nhow many cases of pneumonia occur at the ICF/MR where she worked.  Tr. at 2941 (Crawford).  \nShe did not know the rate of pneumonia that could be reasonably expected to occur at a facility \nsimilar to CHDC or if the rate of pneumonia at CHDC is higher or lower than what is observed \nin nursing homes.  Tr. at 2941 (Crawford).   \n  Although Crawford claimed that one facility in Texas has no aspiration pneumonia for a \nshort period of six (6) months, Dr. Kastner explained: \nThe exhibit which she was asked to look at, which was the \nlist of hospitalizations of people from CHDC, identified only \none instance of aspiration pneumonia during the 12-month period \nand a second possible instance. I personally don't think that \nthere is a compelling body of evidence to suggest that the rates \nof aspiration pneumonia are any different than would be \nreasonably expected, based upon reasonable practice. That -- \nthe fact that there was zero reported at one facility over a \nperiod of six months and the facility is half the size of \nConway -- and Conway's, you know, 500 people in a 12-month \nperiod and had one. I don't find that to be significantly \ndifferent. The comparable time frame with a smaller facility in \nTexas would have been a two-year period, and it would have been \nvaluable to find out whether there had been other \nhospitalizations due to aspiration pneumonia resulting from the \nSan Antonio school. But, you know, the fact that one happened \nover that period of time at Conway doesn't concern me at all.   \n \nTr. at 4079 (Kastner). \n  As to Plaintiff’s experts not dist inguishing between aspiration pneumonia \nand other pneumonia, Dr. Kastner stated: \nIf you identified pneumonia as the outcome, it's incorrect \nbecause there are multiple other contributing factors to the \ndevelopment of pneumonia. It would be unreasonable to say that \npeople develop pneumonia and relate that to only a couple of the \nfactors that lead to an increased rate of pneumonia. You have \nto be specific, tie the outcome to the process, tie aspiration \n  253\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 254 of 383\npneumonia to dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux -- is the \nonly appropriate links. When you do that, you don't see an \nelevated risk of aspiration pneumonia at the Conway Human \nDevelopment Center relative to comparable ICFs, those identified \nby Dr. Mikelson, or the data that Ms. Crawford produced from her \nexperience in Texas. It's the same or at least it's within the \nrealm of the same. \n \nTr. at 4080 (Kastner).   \nAspiration pneumonia was not increased at CHDC compared to other benchmarks.  Tr. at \n4078 (Kastner). \n \nMEALTIME AND MEAL PLANS \nCHDC provides individual meal plans to its residents and manages mealtime in a safe, \npleasant, and appropriate envir onment. Food consistencies are m odified per individual need.   \nResidents’ eating is monitored.  Staff is monitored and trained on their f eeding and mealtime \nsupport.  Thus, CHDC exercises  professional judgment in its de livery of meal services. The \nvarious  food consistencies and delivery of th ose  consistencies m eet  accepted professional  \nstandards. \n  Dr. Sheppard conducted a “rather extensive review of the dietary department … because \nthey play such a central role in nutritional management at CHDC.  And so [she] looked carefully \nat their policy and procedure.”  Tr. at 3315 (Sheppard).  The Dietary Department at CHDC meets \nprofessional standard with respect to their involvement in dysphagia and nutritional \nmanagement.  Dr. Sheppard found: “[T]here is some accepted professional practice and some \nvery much best practice in this - - in what they’re doing.”  Tr. at 3321 (Sheppard).  \n  Plaintiff’s own expert, Ms. Crawford, found the diet plans and the special meal time \nsafety plans themselves to be “minimally acceptable”.  Tr. at 2771 (Crawford). All of the \n  254\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 255 of 383\nresidents had individualized mealtime plans.  Tr. at 3303, 5394 (Sheppard, Johnson).  The diet \nsupplement sheets and the mealtime plans guided the residential staff in mealtime management.  \nTr. at 3334 (Sheppard).  The dietician generated the diet supplements and the speech pathologist \ngenerated the mealtime plans.  Tr. at 3334 (Sheppard).  Preference foods were available and \noffered to residents.  Tr. at 3335 (Sheppard).  Regarding the mealtime plans, Dr. Sheppard \nobserved: \n[T]he plans I looked at were up to date.  They were appropriate for \nthe needs of the individuals and some sensible decisions had been \nmade about what the individuals needed.  There was one particular \ninstance where the plan was not available.  It was being used \nelsewhere, but otherwise the plan books were all available within \nthe dining room.  And I looked at the diet sheets to see that they \nwere appropriate and up to date.   \n \nTr. at 3343 (Sheppard).  “Everything in these individualized plans was consistent with accepted \nprofessional practice.”  Tr. at 3343 (Sheppard).   \nThe diet descriptions were correct.  The fact that there were errors \nin service, that didn’t do any particular harm.  In other words, the \ntolerance that the individual   had for that error was good, was \nokay.  That - - meets minimally acceptable standards. \n \nTr. at 3348 (Sheppard). \n  The pediatric and the adult program occurred within the context of the activity.  Tr. at \n3338 (Sheppard).  Dr. Sheppard found that such incidental training was optimal practice.  Tr. at \n3338, 3339 (Sheppard).  Regarding the pediatric residential dining program, there was a \nlunchtime training program in the pediatric houses.  It was a skill driven program.  The program \nwas for the purpose of developing eating behaviors, that is, “behave in an eating situation and \nthen eating skills, self feeding skills, use of utensils and chewing skills, cup drinking skills … \nand be able to function in a less restrictive environment.”  Tr. at 3337 (Sheppard).  The pediatric \nresidential dining program met accepted professional practice as stated by Dr. Sheppard.  Tr. at \n  255\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 256 of 383\n3338 (Sheppard).   The pediatric residential dining program was interdisciplinary and was \nintegrated with residential care.  Tr. at 3338 (Sheppard).     \n  Enteral nutrition, nutrition and/or hydration by non-oral means, is sometimes required at \nall ICF/MRs.  Tr. at 2946 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford did not know the number of individuals on \nenteral nutrition at the ICF/MR where she worked.  Tr. at 2946, 2947 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford \ndid not know the rate of enteral nutrition that could reasonably be expected to occur at a facility \nsuch as CHDC or how the rate compares to that at nursing homes.  Tr. at 2947 (Crawford).    \n  Mealtime management procedures met accepted professional standards.  Practices “in \nsome ways best practices, in some ways acceptable professional practice, but it’s up there.”  Tr. \nat 3335 (Sheppard).  There were a variety of eating environments, such as the cafeteria, a \ncanteen, and the houses.  Tr. at 3336 (Sheppard).  The staggered serving schedule, where \nindividuals did not have to wait that long for their food, was “quite good” according to Dr. \nSheppard. Tr. at 3344 (Sheppard).  Where groups were brought into the kitchen, the individuals \nhad to wait longer to be served.  Dr. Sheppard stated: \nAnd when I saw that there was an overly long wait, I would rate \nthat as minimally acceptable.  And when I saw that the waits were \nwithin ten minutes or so, I thought that was an accepted \nprofessional practice.  That’s okay. \n \nTr. at 3344 (Sheppard).   \nService schedules were varied from house to house.  Dr. Sheppard found four \nobservations best practices and six observations to be accepted professional practice.  Tr. at 3345 \n(Sheppard).  Mealtime recommendations on procedures and techniques “were all appropriate \nrecommendations and they’re certainly accepted professional standards.”  Tr. at 3349 \n(Sheppard).  With respect to implementation of recommendations, Dr. Sheppard found four of \n  256\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 257 of 383\nher ten observations were best practices, three were acceptable and three were minimally \nacceptable.  Tr. at 3350 (Sheppard).   \n  With respect to staff supervision of meals, “a couple of houses met a best practice \nstandard in how they supervised and assisted the residents and two met an accepted standard and \nfour were minimally acceptable.”  Tr. at 3350 (Sheppard).  Dr. Sheppard found the dining rooms \nto be pleasant, with good acoustics, with ample space, with good clusters of people, and space to \neat alone if preferred. It was individualized. To that respect, it was a best practices model.  Tr. at \n3350, 3351 (Sheppard).   \n  Published literature refers to liquid consistencies as nectar, honey, but not milk shake.  \nTr. at 2940 (Crawford).  There are five diet consistencies at CHDC: blended consistency which \nis puree; chopped consistency which is essentially ground; diced consistency which is cut up in \nsmall bite-sized pieces; soft diet, which is chewable; and regular diet which is fundamentally \nrestricted.  Tr. at 3317 (Sheppard).  With developmental disabilities, varied consistencies of food \nare necessary because some do not have the developmental skills or the tolerance, or swallowing \nability.  Specialized diets are needed due to physiological or psychological or developmental \nissues.  Tr. at 3317, 3318 (Sheppard).  There is a continuum of modified food diets.  Tr. at 3318 \n(Sheppard).  Liquid consistencies also vary.  Some individuals need thickening in the liquid to be \nable to control it upon swallow. Thickenings include honey thick or honey-like consistency, or \nspoon thickened or pudding-thick liquid.  Pudding-thick can range in thickness, but is delivered \nby a spoon rather than a cup.  Tr. at 3318, 3319 (Sheppard).  Dr. Sheppard found that the various \nliquid and food consistencies at CHDC meet the residents’ needs and is “best practices.”  Tr. at \n3319 (Dr. Sheppard).   Liquid thickening “is a problematic issue wherever it’s done.”  At CHDC, \nit met minimally accepted standards.  Tr. at 3348, 3349 (Sheppard). \n  257\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 258 of 383\n  Regarding Plaintiff’s Expert Carly Crawford’s testimony regarding K.S. and the \nthickening of his liquid, Ms. Holbrook explained: \nK.S. prefers his liquids thickened.  They do not have to be \nthickened for any kind of aspiration purposes.  He just prefers that, \nand that’s his preference. \n \nTr. at 5320 (Holbrook).   Consequently, if any liquids were not thickened for K.S., it was not a \nsafety issue. \n  Individual dietary information was included in three places: in each residence, in the \nmealtime guidelines, and in the residential guidelines.  Tr. at 3303 (Sheppard).  When a \nphysician makes an order for a diet change, the diet change will be made on the same day it is \nreceived.  On weekends the change is made by the nurse and during the week by the dietician.  \nTr. at 3320, 3321 (Sheppard).  The quick reference guides (QRG’s) and the meal plans were \nconsistent.  There was a system in place.  When changes were made to the meal plans, there may \nbe a lag in making the change to the QRG.  Tr. at 3376 (Sheppard).  Dr. Sheppard reviewed \napproximately 85 meal plans and approximately 1/3 of those QRG’s.  The ones she reviewed \nwere congruent in that the QRG’s contained the most recent changes.  Tr. at 3378 (Sheppard).  \nStaff is alerted to a resident’s choking risk by the choking risk assessment.  Such assessment \nresults are sent to the individual’s residence, the program coordinator, the nurse and other team \nmembers.  The results are noted in the IPP, the 24 hour schedule, the quick reference guide, on \nthe diet sheets, and on the eating plans.  Tr. at 5395 (Johnson).    \n  Seating at mealtime was “quite appropriate” according to Dr. Sheppard.  There was a \n“full variety of chairs available to meet the needs of individuals - - highly individualized seating \nand quite appropriate.  Really best practices model.”  Tr. at 3346 (Sheppard).  The PT \nDepartment’s responsibility with respect to mealtime seating is training, that is Phases I and II, \n  258\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 259 of 383\nspot checks, and in-services.  PT staff is present in the residences, providing input on proper \nalignment on a regular basis.  Tr. at 5277 (Hancock).  “So in-service and education and \nalignment is a very big part of our role, and it is done on a continuous basis.”  Tr. at 5277 \n(Hancock).  Speech language pathologist staff also evaluates mealtime seating through their \ntraining and experience on positioning and alignment.  Tr. at 5278 (Hancock).   \n  Although Ms. Crawford alleged that monitoring of physical and nutritional supports was \ngeneral and did not address the efficiency of interventions, Dr. Kastner found that there is \n“abundant evidence in the record of active monitoring of the effectiveness of interventions.  Tr. \nat 4289 (Kastner).  \nThe food audit contains information such as food temperatures, safety, sanitation, correct \ndiet, correct adaptive equipment, and correct consistency of liquids.  Tr. at 5318 (Holbrook).  \nFood audit process entails viewing of a variety of mealtimes by the Dietary Department, or \nsomeone designated by the team.  Information is checked, is audited, at various mealtimes on a \nroutine basis.  Tr. at 5318 (Holbrook).  The food audits have been effective.  Corrections are \nmade at the time of the audit and then Quality Assurance follows up with a plan of correction \nand formal training.  Tr. at 5318, 5319 (Holbrook).  If the food auditor observes an increase in \nthe number of modified diets being served incorrectly, Quality Assurance, the team leader, and \nthe residential supervisor are notified.  Tr. at 5319 (Holbrook).  Quality Assurance tracks any \ncorrections per the food audits through its plan of correction process.  Tr. at 5319 (Holbrook).  If \nan individual is cited during a food audit for failing to correctly modify a diet, a follow-up audit \nis conducted.  Tr. at 5319 (Holbrook).  Food service audits include the manner in which food is \nserved and the positioning of staff feeding an individual.  Tr. at 5393 (Johnson). \n  259\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 260 of 383\n  CHDC monitors the effectiveness of strategies outlined in an eating plan by using \nfunctional outcomes and trending of the previous five years.  (Functional outcomes include \nweights, hydration status, choking incidents, and pneumonia incidences.)  Tr. at 5319, 5320 \n(Holbrook).  The mealtime monitoring form includes checking for signs of silent aspiration, such \nas coughing, watery eyes, use of adaptive equipment, and meal refusals.  Tr. at 5394 (Johnson).  \nMonitoring allows CHDC to follow an individual by their functional outcomes.  Tr. at 5394 \n(Johnson).  Staff is monitored on their feeding techniques when the speech pathologist is in the \nunit or during a food audit.  They are also monitored by the dysphagia disorders surveys and the \nmealtime monitoring forms.  Tr. at 5395 (Johnson). The dietician monitored quarterly for \nconduct of the dining room, issues related to food preparation and cleanliness, and food \nconsistencies.  The program coordinator monitored the service objectives.  Tr. at 3339, 3340 \n(Sheppard).  The monitoring met accepted professional practice.  “It was interdisciplinary, and \nthat is certainly good.”  Tr. at 3340 (Sheppard).  The dietician, speech pathologist, and the \nresidential program managers monitored the direct care staff with respect to implementation of \nmeal plans.  Dr. Sheppard reviewed the evaluations that were done by the speech pathologists \nfollowing choking incidents.  She reviewed monitoring lists and reports from the speech \npathologists.  Tr. at 3374, 3375 (Sheppard).   \n  Float staff receive information on mealtime via in-service training that has been done by \nthe supervisors.  It is the supervisors’ responsibility to ensure that any staff assisting with an \nindividual has been trained with respect to that individual.  Tr. at 5397 (Johnson).   \n  Speech pathologists are present in the units on a routine basis.  They see individuals on \naverage 15 times a year.  Tr. at 5395 (Johnson).   “The dietician, the dietary department or a \nspeech pathologist working with the dietary department observes every resident monthly.”  Tr. at \n  260\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 261 of 383\n3339 (Sheppard).  Some with higher risk or with “less stable patterns” were monitored twice a \nmonth.  Tr. at 3339 (Sheppard).  Monitoring was also conducted upon request by staff. Tr. at \n3339 (Sheppard).  Interim monitoring occurred after episodes of choking or pneumonia.  Tr. at \n3340 (Sheppard).   \n \nADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT \n  CHDC’s inventory and use of adaptive equipment meets accepted professional standards.  \nPlaintiff has raised no specific issues with respect to the adaptive equipment which CHDC \nprovides to its residents.  Regarding adaptive equipment, Ms. Crawford found that “there was \nreally not an overwhelming concern there at all.”  Tr. at 2840 (Crawford).   \n[T]hey maintain an inventory of adaptive eating equipment, and \nthey participate with other departments in comprehensive team \nassessments or in their version of comprehensive team assessment, \nwhich is to submit annual reports that refer to nutritional \nmanagement as a part of the report. \n \nTr. at 3323 (Sheppard). “Departments conduct an annual reevaluation of individuals and perform \nand update checks of individuals using adaptive chairs 12 to 15 times annually.”  Tr. at 3323 \n(Sheppard).  Dr Sheppard found that the adaptive equipment was “really quite good.  It was \ncertainly accepted professional practice.  It was very good.”  Tr. at 3328 (Sheppard). With \nexception of 2 or 3 isolated instances out of 85, the equipment was provided as prescribed.  Tr. at \n3347 (Sheppard).  The feeding equipment at CHDC includes conventional and specialized \nequipment.  The feeding equipment demonstrated “best practice.”  Tr. at 3347 (Sheppard).   \n \n \n \n  261\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 262 of 383\nCOMMUNICATION AND SPEECH THERAPY \n  CHDC provides a variety of communication  devices and supports and provides speech \ntherapy and services.  As described below, CHDC meets accepted professional standards in \ndelivery of communication and speech therapy services.   CHDC utilizes various communication \nboards, from very simple boards to very sophisticated boards.  Tr. at 3532 (Jinks). The \ncommunication systems at CHDC enabled individuals to be functional, enabling them to interact \nwith the staff providing services to them.  Tr. at 3533 (Jinks).   \n  The words included on a communication board are derived from a standard list of words \nand also from staff surveys and conversations with parents/guardians regarding an individual.  \nTr. at 5397 (Johnson).  Approximately 60 generic communication boards are available at various \nCHDC locations.  Health or medical related boards are located in each of the nurse’s stations, \nresidences, and at 25 other locations across campus.  Tr. at 5388, 5389 (Johnson).  \n  CHDC does not use the picture exchange communication system (PECS).  CHDC \nbelieves their therapy is “more person centered than product driven.”  They believe their therapy \nis appropriate.  Tr. at 5390 (Johnson).  Staff were familiar with the picture exchange \ncommunication system (PEC system), but had not implemented it.  Mr. Jinks was unaware of \nany accrediting body which would accredit the PEC system.  The absence of the PEC system is \nnot reflective of a departure from any professional standards.  “It’s just one approach that could \nbe considered.”  Tr. at 3534, 3535 (Jinks).  There was no training available in the State of \nArkansas on the PEC system.  Tr. at 3535 (Jinks).  Mr. Jinks recommended the increased use of \nspeech output systems.  Such would enhance the program but is not necessary to meet accepted \nprofessional standards.  Tr. at 3536, 3537 (Jinks). \n  262\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 263 of 383\n  Residents begin training on communication boards in therapy.  Once they are able to use \nthe board in therapy, it is incorporated into their home and school, and they may be further \nevaluated for the use of speech output system.  Such training meets acceptable professional \nstandards as determined by Mr. Jinks.  Tr. at 3534 (Jinks). Residents begin training on \ncommunication boards in therapy.  Once they are able to use the board in therapy, it is \nincorporated into their home and school and they may be further evaluated for the use of speech \noutput system.  Such training meets acceptable professional standards.  Tr. at 3534 (Jinks).  \n  With respect to staff training and supervision, speech language pathologists refer to Ms. \nJohnson if they need guidance or have any clinical questions.  Tr. at 5444 (Johnson).  Research \nshows that there is little or no empirical data on the clinical outcome of clinical supervision.  \nFurthermore, those with many years of experience are in the self-evaluation stage and require \nlittle or no supervision.  Tr. at 5444 (Johnson). \n  Twenty-one (21) school age residents are non-verbal.  Seven (7) school age residents \nhave augmentative communication systems which they are being trained on.  Six (6) of those \nindividuals take the devices across campus with them.  Tr. at 5389 (Johnson).  Verbal school age \nresidents do not require alternative communication devices, as they are already able to \ncommunicate.  Tr. at 5389 (Johnson). \n  When a need is made known or when a new resident comes into the facility, \ncommunication evaluations are completed and the broad spectrum of communication abilities is \nconsidered.  Then a more in-depth evaluation would be completed for those that have need for \nfurther use of augmentative communication.  Tr. at 3538, 3539 (Jinks).    School-age residents \nare evaluated within 30 days of admission and then re-evaluated every three (3) years.  Also, \nthey can be evaluated at any time at the request of the interdisciplinary team.  Tr. at 5388 \n  263\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 264 of 383\n(Johnson).  All of CHDC’s school age population has received a formal augmentative or \nalternative communication assessment.  Tr. at 5388 (Johnson).  . \n  Mr. Jinks found that CHDC provides effective communication services for individuals \nwith severe physical and motor impairments.  Tr. at 3539, 3540 (Jinks).  CHDC provides a wide \nrange of communication services and systems.  CHDC covers a broad range of applications of \ncommunication technology.  Tr. at 3540 (Jinks).  The speech programs at CHDC are clinician \ndesigned specifically for the individual.  Tr. at 5390 (Johnson).  \n  Mr. Jinks observed four residents while on site: A.J., S.B., K.F., and C.M.  Tr. at 3532 \n(Jinks).  Mr. Jinks observed a speech language pathology therapy session while on site.  Tr. at \n3531, 3532 (Jinks).  Mr. Jinks observed speech language pathologists interacting with teachers in \nspecial education settings at CHDC.  Tr. at 3546 (Jinks).  Mr. Jinks noted that the speech \nlanguage pathology evaluation, the recommendations, and the goals were appropriate to the \nindividuals.  Tr. at 3535 (Jinks).   \n  Mr. Jinks found that it was an appropriate conclusion for CHDC speech pathologists, \nafter considering and trying the consultative model, to decide to provide direct therapy.  “[I]t’s \nup to each individual facility or institution to make that type of decision.”  The absence of a \nconsultative model does not fall below any professional standard.  Tr. at 3533, 3534 (Jinks). All \nresidents, regardless of their age, have access to speech language therapy services.”   Tr. at 5388 \n(Johnson).  Twenty nine (of fifty) of the school age children at CHDC receive direct speech \ntherapy.  Tr. at 5388 (Johnson).  In public schools, not all of the special education students are \nenrolled in speech therapy.  Tr. at 5388 (Johnson).  CHDC uses traditional speech therapy.  Such \ntherapy is used all across the United States and in other countries.  Tr. at 5390, 5391 (Johnson).  \nThe students on Ms. Johnson’s speech caseload are meeting their objectives.  If students do not \n  264\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 265 of 383\nmeet their objectives, a plan of action is developed to assist them in meeting those objectives.  \nTr. at 5391 (Johnson).   Mr. Jinks also determined that communication issues are being addressed \nthrough behavioral programs.  Tr. at 3556, 3557, 3561 (Jinks).  Mr. Jinks found that the reports \nspecific to communication systems in the medical records met acceptable standards.  Tr. at 3533 \n(Jinks).  The speech language pathology sections of the medical charts include an evaluation, and \nannual review and progress notes.  Tr. at 3535, 3536 (Jinks). \n \nOCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (OT) AND PHYSICAL THERAPY (PT) \n  CHDC provides OT and PT services and therapy.  Physical management at CHDC \nincludes assessment and monitoring.  Positioning and repositioning plans are individualized and \nhave protected individuals from harm.  Staff is trained on OT and PT techniques.  The \nConstitution imposes a duty, pursuant to the exercise of professional judgment, to provide \nservices “which maintain the residents’ maximum ability to move, but not a duty to achieve \nsome optimal level of performance.”  U.S. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. 565, \n617 (W.D. PA 1995), aff’d U.S. v. Ridge, 96 F.3d 1436 (3d Cir.1996) in accord with Youngberg \nv. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 329 (1982).    \n[A]n infringement of a mentally retarded resident’s liberty interests \nmay occur if a loss in movement results from the Center’s failure \nto provide necessary physical therapy training and/or services, but \nnot every instance where there is a loss of movement indicates that \na constitutional violation has occurred … absent proof that the \nfailure to provide training results in the loss of a recognized liberty \ninterest (e.g. minimally adequate or reasonable training to ensure \nsafety and freedom from undue restraint, as recognized in \nYoungberg), does not implicate constitutional Due Process \nconcerns.   \n \n  265\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 266 of 383\nU.S. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. 565, 617, 618 (W.D. PA 1995), aff’d U.S. \nv. Ridge, 96 F.3d 1436 (3d 1996).  The Plaintiff has provided no evidence to support any claim \nof any harm resulting from CHDC’s physical management programs.  The record reflects no \nevidence of loss of movement, loss of any basic care skills, or medical harm such as untreated or \npreventable decubiti.  To the contrary, Defendants’ expert, Ms. Hackett found the adult and \nschool age PT programs to meet accepted professional standards.  The fragility of CHDC \nresidents’ skeletal systems as well as the best possible position for their skeletal ability must be \nconsidered.  As described below, CHDC is exercising professional judgment and is meeting or \nexceeding constitutional standards with respect to physical management.   \n     \nPHYSICAL THERAPY SERVICES \n  Ms. Hackett found that CHDC residents are receiving appropriate physical therapy \nsupports and services.  Tr. at 5290 (Hancock).  The PT services at CHDC enable the residents to \nbecome more mobile and comfortable.  Tr. at 5290 (Hancock).  Part management of spasticity is \naccess to a physician in Little Rock and in Conway.  Tr. at 3456, 3457 (Schmeler).  The physical \ntherapy department at CHDC primarily looks at range of motion, posture and mobility.  Tr. at \n3458, 3459 (Schmeler).  The physical therapy department at CHDC conducts individual \nassessments upon admission and then subsequently throughout residency.  Tr. at 5251 \n(Hancock).  Physical therapy treatment is based on the assessments and the individual treatment \nneeds.  Tr. at 5251 (Hancock).   \n  CHDC addresses acute medical needs; provides wheelchair modifications and power \nwheelchair training; wound care; positioning programs; and holds monthly orthotic clinics.  The \nphysical therapy department also provides direct therapy services.  Tr. at 5251 (Hancock).  \n  266\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 267 of 383\nPhysical therapy treatment and direction are determined through the physical therapy \nassessments.  Assessments include the consideration of orthopedic involvement, muscle tone \nissues, contractures, and measurements.  Tr. at 5255 (Hancock).   \n  Direct PT intervention includes PT services that assist an individual in achieving a goal \nand PT staff actively work with the individual.  Indirect PT services pertain to pieces of \nequipment used by individuals.  Tr. at 5257, 5258 (Hancock).  The physical therapist is \nultimately responsible for each individual’s indirect PT services.  Tr. at 5261 (Hancock).     \n  New admissions require more detailed assessments including chart review.  Assessments \nfor new admissions that are school-aged require standardized testing.  Tr. at 5255, 5256 \n(Hancock).  CHDC utilizes standardized tests for school-age individuals per the IDEA rules.  For \nthe general public, such testing guides the reimbursement process.  CHDC does not bill in that \nmanner, but uses the testing as guidance for service goals related to mobility or balance \ncoordination.  CHDC also uses other forms of standardized tests.  Tr. at 5259 (Hancock).          \n  Assessments for new admissions provide a baseline of functional abilities.  Also, devices \nare reviewed for continued use at CHDC.  Tr. at 5256 (Hancock).   \n  Those receiving direct intervention PT services receive annual assessments.  Tr. at 5257 \n(Hancock).  Those with one piece of adaptive equipment, such as a wheelchair or AFO or gait \nbelt, their PT services would be assessed on an annual basis.  Tr. at 5257 (Hancock).  Those not \nreceiving direct PT service or without adaptive equipment, are assessed for PT services every \nfive years.  Tr. at 5257 (Hancock).  There are minimum PT services outlined for the formal \nassessment process.  PT staff go beyond those services depending on the particular issues \nthrough other processes.  Tr. at 5258 (Hancock).    The positioning plans are contained in the \npositioning book maintained at each living unit.  Three types of positioning are delineated in the \n  267\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 268 of 383\nbook: time out of the wheelchair; alternate positioning; and individual positioning programs.  \nThe book contains guidelines and pictures.  Tr. at 5263, 5264 (Hancock).      \n \nPHYSICAL MANAGEMENT, POSITIONING, POSITIONING PLANS \n  The occupational therapy department at CHDC primarily looks at upper extremity, \nsplinting, helmets, activities of daily living, bathing, dressing, feeding, and adaptive utensils.  Tr. \nat 3459 (Schmeler).  Ms. Crawford did not offer any testimony as to assistive equipment \ntechnology supports despite her reference to this area in her report.  Dr. Kastner observed: \nBut I don't believe she testified at all about Section 2 of her report \nand the issue of assistive technology supports, which I found to \nbe quite striking, because this was the area that relates to the \nscope of practice of occupational therapists. I don't \nunderstand it really. It was probably the only area to which \nshe could have reasonably offered an opinion about the standard \nof care. But I don't believe that she did offer that during her \ndirect testimony. \n \nTr. at 4293 (Kastner). \n  Monitoring of treatment plans are performed by OT and PT on a weekly basis or a \nmonthly basis.  They make observations and review documentation.  There is a quarterly review \nand then an annual review.  Tr. at 3479 (Schmeler).   Plaintiff’s expert, Ms. Crawford, criticized \nthe positioning of several individuals.  However, her criticisms are unfounded by the evidence or \nat best are isolated incidents.  Furthermore, no evidence of harm has been identified by the \nPlaintiff or its experts related to any alleged improper positioning.   \n•  R.M.K. \nR.M.K. has custom molded wheelchair seating.  He has a day bed for alternative \npositioning.  For OT he receives indirect services, uses soft hand splints, and has a hand \n  268\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 269 of 383\nwashing program. Dr. Schmeler found that his equipment was adequate, needing no \nadjustments.  Tr. at 3461, 3462 (Schmeler).   \n•  G.H. \nG.H.’s wheelchair was modified to accommodate his preference for leaning.  He had \nbeen accessed for a power wheelchair.  Dr. Schmeler noted that the wheelchair was \nadequate, meeting his needs.  Tr. at 3462, 3463 (Schmeler).      \n•  L.E. \nDr. Schmeler noted that L.E.’s poor posture and poor seating alignment is not the fault of \nCHDC.  Such deformity most likely evolved over 15 or 20 years or so due to lack of intervention \nliving at home before he came to CHDC.  Either intervention was not available or the knowledge \nwas not available at the time.  Tr. at 3477, 3478 (Schmeler).   \n  L.E.  has very severe rotational kyphoscoliosis, “he’s essentially twisted 180 degrees … \nsome of the most challenging of situations to deal with.”  He has a customized seating system.  \nWhile placed in bed at night, he has no alternative positioning program.  Such is acceptable \ngiven his posture.  He receives indirect OT services and is monitored for skin hygiene.  Dr. \nSchmeler found that his physical management and interventions were appropriate.  Tr. at 3464 -\n3466 (Schmeler).     \n  L.E. was admitted to CHDC in November of 1980.  L.E. is a “very rare example of \nsomeone that has a severe condition that’s referred to as opisthotonos.”  Tr. at 5274 (Hancock).  \nL.E. also has a “rotational component in his condition that - - long-term effects of that condition \nresult in scoliosis, pelvic obliquity, hip dislocations, sometimes pressure problems, even \nmandibular malalignment.”  Tr. at 5275 (Hancock).  At the time of admission to CHDC, the \northopedic stated that he would be bedridden.  “[A]t the time that he arrived at the facility, he \n  269\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 270 of 383\nwas already in that posture.”  Tr. at 5275 (Hancock).  L.E. was seen three years following his \nadmission to CHDC by Dr. Richard McCarthy, a renowned orthopedics specialist in the \ncommunity. Dr. McCarthy found that there were no treatment options available for L.E.’s \ncondition.  Tr. at 5276 (Hancock).  Ms. Hackett determined that CHDC has provided L.E. with \nan appropriate seating system. It is like a cart that allows him to be mobile.   \nHe has no skin breakdown.  He is happy.  He’s able to go to class.  \nAnd he has what I feel like for him a very rounded - - well life. \n \nTr. at 5276, 5277 (Hancock).     \n•  K.P. \nK.P. has a history of fractures, severe osteoporosis for which “quite a few interventions” \nwere in place.  For OT, she was monitored for a bilateral hand hygiene program.  She had \na left positioning splint for her hand.  Dr. Schmeler stated: “So my overall conclusion \nhere is, there was nothing that stood out as being any kind of departure from accepted \nstandards of practice.  They are using precautions to avoid fractures.  Her wheelchair \nappeared to fit her well, and she seemed to be on her appropriate splinting program for \nher left hand.”  Tr. at 3466, 3467 (Schmeler).   \n•  K.D.B., C.C., G.H., M.J., K.S. \n  Dr. Schmeler also reviewed the physical management of K.D.B., C.C., G.H., S.B., M.J., \nand K.S.  “Overall, the type of population that I looked at tended to be people with pretty severe \nphysical and cognitive disabilities that require some pretty significant interventions related to \nseating and mobility and splinting and being able to manage their activities of daily living, so \ntransfers, dressing, toileting, eating.  There really wasn’t anything that stood out as being a \nsignificant departure.”  Tr. at 3468, 3469 (Schmeler).        \n•  N.K.   \n  270\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 271 of 383\nN.K. is positioned in posterior tilt.  Posterior tilt is a position “like if you were to slide \nforward in your chair and sit on just the back portion of your spine and pelvis, this person \nis fixed in that position.”  Tr. at 5282 (Hancock).   \nHe is also fixed with an abduction somewhat.  He has a multitude \nof orthopedic concerns that have been addressed over time.  He has \ndegenerative joint disease of both hips and he has had right hip \nsublation, which subsequently required surgery.  So he has a \nvariety of other health, just medical needs. When he entered into \nthe center, his orthopedic considerations were well established at \nthe time of his entrance.  He came from a home setting, and his \northopedic structure was set.   \n \nTr. at 5282 (Hancock).   Ms. Hancock noted that N.K. has GERD which can be affected by his \nposterior tilt, but he is in the most upright position he can be in.  Tr. at 5283 (Hancock).   \n•  K.D.B., L.H., K.M., M.M., K.P., G.Y., J.D. \n  Plaintiff’s expert Carly Crawford mentioned K.D.B., L.H., K.M., M.M., K.P., G.Y., and \nJ.D. in her expert report.  The first six of those reside in 2 Willow, the unit which houses the \nmost fragile women at CHDC.  Their positioning programs do state that these individuals should \nnot be out of their wheelchairs for extended periods of time.  It is an accurate statement.  \nHowever, it is a template statement used throughout the Center.  It is difficult to seat these \nwomen in their chairs.  These women “are the most health-fragile individuals that we have at the \ncenter, and also severely deformed individuals that have such orthopedic concerns and muscle \ntone concerns that it is difficult to seat them in a chair.”    \n… [T]hey have less of a tolerance to being upright and in that chair \nthan other individuals.  You would only have to look at their x-rays \nto see how deformed and the severity of the deformity that we’re \ntalking about.  So you would find that if they were in their chair \nand then they appeared to be uncomfortable, that they would be \nplaced in alternate positioning, and that may not be in their \nwheelchair.  \n  \nTr. at 5284-5286 (Hancock).   \n  271\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 272 of 383\n  Ms. Hancock has never seen any resident in Willow in any type of inappropriate seating.  \nTr. at 5309 (Hancock).  For the individuals, whose plans stated they should spend most of their \ntime in their wheelchairs, it was not inappropriate for them to spend time outside of their \nwheelchairs.  Tr. at 5309 (Hancock).  “[I]f you saw the orthopedic consultations on these \nindividuals, this wouldn’t even be a question.”  These individuals have significant deformities.  \nThey are out of their wheelchairs for quality of life and comfort.  “The fact that we could provide \nseating for some of these individuals is just - - is amazing.  It’s amazing they don’t have skin \nbreakdown problems, amazing they can even be upright.”  Tr. at 5309, 5310 (Hancock).  They \nhave incurred no harm from being outside their wheelchairs.  Tr. at 5310, 5311 (Hancock).   \n  A huddle cuddle can be categorized as being similar to a waterbed frame.  Tr. at 2939 \n(Crawford).   \n•  K.P. \nK.P. was on hospice care.  She spent a significant amount of time out of her wheelchair \ndue to comfort reasons.  Tr. at 5287 (Hancock).     \n  Optimal alignment is in a wheelchair.  Tr. at 5291.  Individuals, such as those residing at \nWillow, have physical conditions that may necessitate them to be out of their wheelchairs more \nfrequently.  Tr. at 5292 (Hancock).  While Ms. Hancock agreed that the statement on top of their \npositioning programs stating that their wheelchairs are the optimal position did not apply to \nthem, she explained that the reason the statement was there was because it was part of a form \ntemplate used throughout the facility.  Tr. at 5292, 5293 (Hancock). \n  While wanting to see more detail and better pictures, Plaintiff’s expert, Ms. Crawford, \nfound no problem with the positioning plans themselves.  Tr. at 2896 (Crawford).  “I think they \nminimally meet the standard.”  Tr. at 2896 (Crawford).  Positioning programs are available in the \n  272\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 273 of 383\nareas where the individuals live and eat in a notebook.  Tr. at 2939 (Crawford).  The positioning \nprograms at CHDC were adequate.  Tr. at 4828 (Hackett).  Individualized positioning plans were \nprovided for many individuals.  The importance of using wheelchairs was stressed; and \nindividuals were optimally aligned a lot of the time.  Tr. at 4828 (Hackett).  Regarding the \nindividuals she observed, Ms. Hackett found the positioning to be “appropriate, generally \nadequate.”  Tr. at 4829 (Hackett).  Positioning programs were out and available when the \nindividuals were eating.  “I thought that was also significant.  It’s one thing to have a program \nthat’s in a book, but it’s another thing for it to be being used functionally.”  Tr. at 4829 \n(Hackett).     \n  Individuals may move themselves out of optimal alignment while in their wheelchairs or \nwhile seated when eating.  Tr. at 2948 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford did not formally assess any \nindividuals as to verify whether or not they were properly aligned or whether or not they had \nsufficient support.  Tr. at 2948 (Crawford).  The determination of proper alignment is a matter of \nprofessional judgment based on assessment of the individual.  Tr. at 2951, 2952 (Crawford).  Ms. \nCrawford was asked whether it was possible, for example with those who have deformities or \ncontractures, that those individuals cannot be placed in as perfect a position that would be \nsuggested for them.  She replied that she would not suggest a perfect position for them.  Tr. at \n2954 (Crawford).  Ms. Crawford could not specifically say for any of the individuals she noted \nas having improper positioning that they were harmed as a result of the positioning.  Tr. at 2957 \n(Crawford).  \n  “Positioning means postural alignment and the supports that maintain that postural \nalignment.”  It is “extremely important” at meals.  Tr. at 3379 (Sheppard).  When asked whether \n  273\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 274 of 383\nshe checked the congruency between the plan and the individual’s alignment during her \nobservations, Dr. Sheppard replied: \nOh, of course I did.  When I would be looking - - if there was \nanything in the mealtime plan that specifically addressed how they \nshould be positioned while eating, I would have been looking at \nthat.   \n \nTr. at 3380 (Sheppard).  She continued: \nThere are standards of positioning that are adhered to in eating.  \nHead alignment sometimes, hip alignments, postural alignments, \nand that’s an accepted standard for eating.  And the mealtime plans \nare for the individualized items on top of those general standards.  \nAnd so what I addressed in the other items were the specialized \nneeds that were articulated in the individual plans, but I didn’t have \nit here.  It doesn’t mean that they didn’t - - I don’t say they didn’t \nmeet, adhere to whatever was in the mealtime plans, but of those \n85 mealtime plans I looked at, there must have been very few that \nhad anything to do with seating, is my guess as to the reason for \nme not articulating it here.  What I thought was a more general and \nvalid way of doing it was to say that they adhered to the standards. \n \nTr. at 3382, 3383 (Sheppard).  \n  With respect to Plaintiff’s expert’s statements on proximal stability as it relates to \nmobility and function, Dr. Schmeler explained: \nThat’s pretty much a theoretical textbook description of seating. \n \n        *     *    * \nSeating is a much more complicated activity than most people \nreally understand it.  If you look at our own seated postures, we \nmove constantly.  We change our positions throughout the day, \nthroughout the hour, depending on what our needs are … But then \nthere’s comfort.  Sitting upright is not comfortable … So stability \nand balance sometimes gets trumped you want to be comfortable \n…  So it’s hard to dictate a posture because you really need to \nunderstand what it is that person needs to do or is trying to do at \nthat given time.  You need to know what that person’s range of \nlimitations are … It’s something that just has to be looked at a lot \nmore carefully than just to say that everybody should be sitting \nupright with their pelvis locked in and their body balanced. \n  274\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 275 of 383\n \nTr. at 3471, 3472 (Schmeler). The ideal position of 90-90 may not be ideal for someone with a \nfixed deformity such as a dislocated hip or severe hamstring contracture.  Tr. at 4819 (Hackett).   \n 90/90/90 seating is an anatomical reference.  Tr. at 3472, 3473 (Schmeler).  It is not a current \nstandard.  “[Y]ou would never find that standard in the ergonomic literature.”  Tr. at 3473 \n(Schmeler).   \n  MAT assessments are not always necessary.  Tr. at 3473, 3474 (Schmeler).  The PT and \nPT assistant perform periodic spot checks in the residences, to check on proper positioning and \nmake any corrections.  The therapist communicates directly with staff.  Tr. at 4847 (Hackett).  \nThe PT Department provides continuous in-servicing and training on proper alignment and \nsupport.  Tr. at 5288 (Hancock).      \n  Ms. Crawford’s observations of positioning based on that given moment are not \nnecessarily reflective of any equipment being improperly fitted.  Tr. at 4820, 4821 (Hackett).  \nMs. Hackett observed: \nBut in most - - in the cases that I saw, the wheelchairs were - - the \nback positions were appropriate.  They accommodated deformities \nappropriately.  I was really actually very pleased with what I saw. \n      \nTr. at 4821 (Hackett).   \n  Dr. Kastner noted that “perfect symmetric upright alignment may not always be achieved \nin individuals with they type of disabilities that are encountered at CHDC.”  Tr. at 4276 \n(Kastner).  Dr. Kastner explained why this was not the propoeer standard that Ms. Crawford was \nusing and he stated: \nBut her focus on using proper alignment or symmetric alignment \nas the standard allowed her to simply walk into a room, physically \nscan the room visuallym and identify those individuals who were \nnot seated ina perfect or, I’m sorry, in a proper fashion and reach a \n  275\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 276 of 383\nconclusion quickly that those individuals’ care did not meet the \nstandard of care and felt that was quite improper.   \n \nTr. at 4277 (Kastner).  Dr. Crawford’s average length of observation was only 2.1 minutes, \nwhich is an inadequate amount as to the provision of services.  Tr. at 4277 (Kastner).   \nThe general standard for repositioning a nonambulatory person who is in bed is every two \nhours.  Tr. at 5306 (Hancock).  The blanks on the positioning documentation do not necessarily \nmean that the repositioning did not take place, it only means the documentation did not take \nplace.  Tr. at 5307 (Hancock). Dr. Schmeler was asked if it was a substantial departure from \ngenerally accepted professional standards if individuals were not repositioned as frequently as \nindicated by their plans.  Dr. Schmeler explained that generally that was true and that staff \nshould comply with the plan, but it would depend on a case-by-case specific basis.  Tr. at 3509-\n3511 (Schmeler).  The Defendants presented evidence on case-by-case specifics and the reasons \nfor the positions and repositioning.  The Plaintiff did not investigate or consider any potential \nreasons for any repositioning that had not occurred per the plan.  In addition, the Plaintiff \nprovided no evidence of harm for any alleged lack of repositioning.   \n•  C.C., T.S., K.S., D.S., D.W., J.R., L.H., K.M., M.M., K.P., G.Y., B.H., M.L., W.R., T.R., \nC.C., H.G., M.G., F.M. \n  Ms. Hackett found the individualized positioning programs of C.C., T.S., K.S., D.S., \nD.W., J.R., L.H., K.M., M.M., K.P., G.Y., B.H., M.L., W.R., T.R., C.C., H.C., M.G., F.M. to be \nappropriate.  CHDC provided alternative positions to adjust wheelchair seating and CHDC \nconsidered an individual’s need for more than one position.  Tr. at 4815, 4816 (Hackett). \n•  J.P.E., J.P.J., D.B., N.K., D.B., C.J., L.E., A.R. \n  Ms. Hackett reviewed 8 residents (J.P.E., J.P.J., D.B., N.K., D.B., C.J., L.E., A.R.) in \ngreater detail.  These were individuals alleged by Ms. Crawford to be poorly aligned.  Ms. \n  276\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 277 of 383\nHackett explained that when you observe these individuals with neurological impairments, their \nalignment from a visual inspection is often very poor. “[Y]ou really need to look in greater depth \nin terms of what their fixed deformities are.”  Ideal alignment may be impossible.  “[I]f someone \nhas a neurological impairment that’s been in place for many, many years, they will have fixed \ndeformities like dislocated hips or contractures or scoliosis, where you can’t get them straight.”  \nTr. at 4816, 4817 (Hackett).  Ms. Hackett found the equipment for J.P.E., J.P.J., D.B., N.K., \nD.B., C.J., L.E., A.R. fit them appropriately.  Tr. at 4820 (Hackett).   \n•  J.P.E. \nJ.P.E. was said to be in posterior pelvic tilt by Ms. Crawford.  Posterior pelvis tilt is not \nan ideal postural alignment.  However, J.P.E. has fixed deformities.  Ms. Hackett noted: “He \nonly had 75 degrees of hip flexion available, and he had very short hamstrings … So if we \nactually tried to seat him in a neutral pelvic tilt at 90-90, it would have been agonizing.”  Tr. at \n4818, 4819 (Hackett).  J.P.E’s positioning accommodations were appropriate and accommodated \nhis deformities.  Tr. at 4820 (Hackett).  J.P.E. had a “foam-in-place back cushion”, a custom \nmade accommodation.  Tr. at 4820 (Hackett).  Ms. Hackett asked J.P.E. if he was comfortable \nand he did not report any discomfort.  It is important to get input from those you are evaluating.  \nTr. at 4820 (Hackett).   \n•  D.B. \n  When Ms. Hackett observed D.B., she was seated properly aligned.  Within 10 or 15 \nminutes of her observation, D.B. managed to move to the side which she seemed to enjoy, in a \nless than optimal position.  Staff let her remain in such position because she enjoyed it.  \nAnd then they put her straight again.  And that’s okay. It’s okay to \nlet somebody do that for a little while for enjoyment as long as \nthey are optimally aligned and appropriately positioned the rest of \nthe time. \n  277\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 278 of 383\n \nTr. at 4821, 4822 (Hackett).  D.B. was not in an unsafe situation in any way according to Ms. \nHackett.  Tr. at 4822, 4823 (Hackett).   \n•  S.B. \n  Ms. Crawford reported that S.B. should be fed midline to prevent choking.  S.B. has \nathetosis which includes a lot of involuntary movements.  Because of the constant movement, \nshe ate in a position where her head was forward and she would turn her head to the side, “which \ncreated a reflex that would lock her body into a reflex position, and she had a stable moment \nwhere she could get food in her mouth and have a smooth swallow.”  Ms. Hackett explained: \nBut for this particular woman, because of her athetosis, that was \nthe only stable position that she could eat in.  When we tried to \nfeed her in the appropriate neutral head forward position, she \nstarted to aspirate. \n \nTr. at 4823, 4824 (Hackett).  S.B. also communicated, on her communication board, that she \nliked to have her forehead held by her caregiver while eating and that it helped her.   \nI just asked if I could just observe her trying to take one bite \nwithout this extra support.  And she could not release the spoon.  \nShe bit down on it and had a tonic bite.  So everything that they \nwere doing was appropriate. \n \nTr. at 4824, 4825 (Hackett).  Ms. Hackett found that having S.B. tilted back slightly, 15 degrees, \nwhile she ate, was optimal for S.B.  Tr. at 4825 (Hackett).  When S.B. is not eating, midline \npositioning is optimal for her.  When she is eating, midline is not optimal for her.  Tr. at 4837 \n(Hackett).  \n•  C.J. \n  Ms. Hackett participated with the physical therapists in a MAT assessment for C.J. and \nfor all the others except the one who was having some respiratory issues.  Tr. at 4826, 4827 \n  278\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 279 of 383\n(Hackett).  C.J. had “a severe hamstring contracture on his right side, which caused his pelvis to \nshift in his chair.  And he had a pelvic obliquity.”  He was in “quite a bit of pain” when he was \nput all the way back in his chair.  Tr. at 4826 (Hackett).   So, his positioning was appropriate.   \n  As to Crawford’s claim that there was improper positioning at CHDC, Dr. Kastner \ndescribed how the ewvidence does not support her: \n \nYes, I did. Again, I think decubiti is an excellent \noutcome to study if we want to understand the impact of \npositioning practices. Ms. Crawford talked about the importance \nof positioning and made allegations about improper positioning \npractices at CHDC. The -- and alleged in many specific \ninstances that those poor positioning practices would lead to an \nincreased risk of decubiti. Well, there is an invitation to a \nstudy, an invitation to look at the occurrence of decubiti \nacross the facility and see if it confirms what would occur if \ncare practices were deficient. If positioning practices are \ninappropriate, we should expect an increased risk of decubiti. \nBased upon data, the rate of decubiti is approximately four per \nhundred per year. There are people with multiple decubiti, so \nwe would express it as four decubiti per hundred people per \nyear, and that's clearly a reasonable benchmark, a reasonable \noutcome rate when you compare decubiti risks at other ICF/MRs \nand data collected by the centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nservices at nursing homes. \n \nTr. 4080, 4081 (Kastner). \n \nDECUBITI \n  Decubiti is not an issue at CHDC.  CHDC prevents decubiti with its positioning program.  \nWhen pressure sores do develop, CHDC provides treatment and management.  The Plaintiff has \nnot presented evidence of any harm with respect to decubiti.  \n  At Ms. Crawford’s deposition, she did not know the rate of decubiti at a facility such as \nCHDC.  So the rate would not have factored into her opinions in this case.  Tr. at 2920 \n(Crawford). Ms. Crawford did not know the national average for facilities similar to CHDC \n  279\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 280 of 383\nregarding the rate of decubiti.  Tr. at 2920 (Crawford).  The rate of decubiti at CHDC is much \nlower than the benchmards.  Tr. at 4065 (Kastner).  Ms. Crawford did not know that the \nincidence of pressure sores at CHDC is lower that the incidence in the nationwide population in \nlong-term care facilities.  Tr. at 2921 (Crawford).  According to Ms. Crawford, the rate of \ndecubiti she calculated for CHDC used a denominator of only those at risk and not the entire \npopulation.  “[P]eople that walk and talk and move around on their own and, you know, they \nwould not fall into the category of risk or harm, you wouldn’t expect them to have a pressure \nulcer.”  Tr. at 2961, 2962 (Crawford).   Ms. Crawford did not know how CMS reports the rate of \ndecubiti, that is, whether rates for a nursing home includes the entire population.  Tr. at 2962 \n(Crawford).  Ms. Crawford could not provide any specifics but stated that there are sources \nwhich say that the denominator should be modified for purposes of reporting decubiti.  Tr. at \n2963 (Crawford).  Crawford could not provide any guidance for locating this standard.  Tr. at \n2963 (Crawford).  As a result, Ms. Crawford inappropriately inflated the rate of decubiti at \nCHDC and she had no basis for comparison to other settings to show what rate would be \nreasonably expected. \n  Other than one case where the individual developed decubiti while on a trip with his \nmother, Ms. Crawford did not know whether the individuals with decubiti developed decubiti at \nCHDC or outside the facility.  Tr. at 2920, 2921 (Crawford).  Consequently, she could not tell \nthe Court what number of decubiti actually occurred during care rendered at CHDC.  Regarding \npressure sores, “the national incidence is somewhere between 14 and 18 percent, with a goal of \ntrying to get that reduced significantly.”  There is 13 percent incidence across the population at \nCHDC.  Thus, CHDC is less than the national average.  Tr. at 3470, 3471 (Schmeler).  At \nCHDC, the majority of sores were not past stage two.  At stages one and two “there’s a lot of \n  280\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 281 of 383\nopportunity to resolve the issue.  Stage two is basically superficial redness and maybe some \nsuperficial skin break.”  Tr. at 3474 (Schmeler).  Stage three is “dermis” and stage four is \n“muscle and bone”.  Tr. at 3474 (Schmeler).     \n  The PT Department trains staff on how to avoid decubiti and skin breakdown.  Generally, \nskin breakdown is avoided or reduced through the positioning programs and the seating systems.  \nThe PT Department developed guidelines on wound care, which provides description and care of \nvarious types of skin breakdown.  Tr. at 5280 (Hancock).  The PT Department provides direct \ncare staff with written instructions and specific verbal communications on how to care for \ndecubiti.  Tr. at 5280, 5281 (Hancock). \n \nWHEELCHAIRS \n  CHDC provides customized wheelchairs.  It has its own orthotics shop on campus.  The \nequipment shop was a “best practices model.  That’s really excellent.”  Tr. at 3328 (Sheppard).   \nThe physical therapy orthotics shop is an on-site workshop.  At the shop, custom seating is \nfabricated for CHDC residents.  The shop also contains an inventory of commercial products.  \nThus, CHDC has the ability to fabricate a wheelchair from scratch or to use commercial items \n“based on the needs of the client.”  Tr. at 3455 (Schmeler).  “I don’t think there’s that many \npeople with the expertise or the resources to put together complex seating systems for \npopulations like this.”  Dr. Schmeler found the orthotics shop to be “most impressive, almost \nabove standard.”  Tr. at 3469 (Schmeler).   \n  Ms. Hackett was “quite impressed” with the physical therapy orthotics shop.  Tr. at 4827 \n(Hackett).  Sometimes when you order items from a catalogue, by the time you receive the \nequipment, the child has outgrown it.  The materials used by CHDC in their orthotics shop were \n  281\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 282 of 383\nconsistent with what is commercially available.  CHDC ordered items that they did not fabricate \nin their shop.  Tr. at 4827, 4828 (Hackett).  There are five employees at the physical therapy \northotics shop who work mainly on the construction and modification of wheelchairs and other \nadaptive devices.  Tr. at 5250 (Hancock).  \n  CHDC was able to fabricate items “very rapidly and very specifically for individuals \nthere.”  Tr. at 4827 (Hackett).  Fitting for a chair to completion can take as little as a few days; \nlonger if special equipment is needed, “but it can be done very quickly.  In other centers you can \nwait months for chairs …”  Tr. at 3323 (Sheppard).  With respect to specialized equipment, the \nmanagement of the equipment, the quick turnaround of repairs, the condition of the equipment \nand its appropriateness was best practice.  Tr. at 3328 (Sheppard).  With respect to CHDC’s \ntimeliness of the PT orthotics shop, it is “lightening speed, because I’m used to waiting six to \nnine months in the private sector.  And just also having the ability to modify it on site is very \nbeneficial.”  In the community, a supplier may need to be called.  “Sometimes a client [in the \ncommunity] has to stay in bed for two or three days waiting for someone to come and fix their \nwheelchair.”  Tr. at 3476 (Schmeler).  Generally, from the time a PTO work order is placed, to \nthe time a new or modified chair is completed, the process takes approximately two to three \nweeks.  Tr. at 5269 (Hancock).  If it is an integrity issue or emergent issue, the chair is completed \nin one to two days.  Tr. at 5269 (Hancock).  In the community, the same process takes four to six \nmonths.  Tr. at 5271 (Hancock).      \n  Referrals to the wheelchair clinic can be made by anyone, such as direct care staff, a \ncottage manager, or a team member.  Tr. at 3455, 3456 (Schmeler).  Wheelchair seating is \nroutinely assessed and monitored.  Tr. at 3456 (Schmeler).  CHDC does not use a standardized \n  282\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 283 of 383\nassessment form for consideration of powered mobility, but they do follow the same fundamental \ncriteria.  Tr. at 3503 (Schmeler).  \n  Need for a new seating system is identified through observation or a mat assessment.  \nPast modifications and considerations are reviewed.  Then a PTO work order is completed or the \nindividual will be seen in the seating clinic.  The PTO or seating clinic measurements and \nwheelchair preference is only the initial step to begin the process.  Tr. at 5265 (Hancock).  Once \nthe initial information is received via a PTO work order or seating clinic, the orthotic shop makes \nthe base frame and supporting structures.  Then, a fitting takes place.  Depending on the \ncustomization, several fittings may follow.  If the chair is unique, the PT staff would demonstrate \nthe various features of the chair to direct care staff.  Tr. at 5265-5268 (Hancock).   \n  Tilt in space wheelchairs are used at CHDC.  “Tilt in space wheelchair is essentially the \nability to change the orientation of the seat and back rest on a chair without changing the seat and \nback rest on a chair.” Such chair promotes well-positioned seating.  Tr. at 3457 (Schmeler).  \nStandard manual wheelchairs are also used at CHDC.  Tr. at 3458 (Schmeler).  Tilt in space \nwheelchairs are not designed for a population that self-propels.  Manual wheelchairs are for \nthose who self-propel.  Tr. at 3458 (Schmeler).   \n  There are eight to ten powered wheelchair users at CHDC.  Tr. at 3458 (Schmeler).  \nCHDC considers powered wheelchairs for those who can turn on and off the device safely, are \nable to drive straight, and are able to negotiate fixed obstacles.  Such follows “a generally \naccepted protocol.”  Tr. at 3458 (Schmeler).  Powered wheelchairs are not a necessity for \nachieving acceptable standards within the field of occupational therapy.  Tr. at 3463 (Schmeler).  \nProviding consideration for powered mobility is within accepted standards of practice, “to at \nleast assess the situation and see if there’s a potential that they can learn.”  Tr. at 3463, 3464 \n  283\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 284 of 383\n(Schmeler).   The PT staff assess for power wheelchairs at any time during the evaluation \nprocess and by referral or request by other staff.  The PT Department has a trainer power \nwheelchair.  Someone is currently using the power wheelchair training.  Tr. at 5259, 5260 \n(Hancock).  Regarding use of power wheelchairs, consideration of seizure activity and \ncomprehension of danger must be taken into account.  Tr. at 5260 (Hancock).   Approximately \nten individuals at CHDC use power chairs as their mode of transportation.  Tr. at 5260 \n(Hancock).  Self-propelled wheelchairs provide exercise and use of the individual’s arms.  Power \nwheelchairs do not promote such exercise.  Thus, such loss of mobility must be taken into \nconsideration.  Tr. at 5260, 5261 (Hancock).     \n  Lap trays are “very commonly used on wheelchairs, for a number of reasons.”  For \nexample, they are used as a working surface and for medical purposes (helping the individual \nstay upright).  Tr. at 3478, 3479 (Schmeler).  In the ten cases Dr. Schmeler reviewed, none of the \nindividuals with lap trays were using them inappropriately as restraints.  Tr. at 3480, 3481 \n(Schmeler).  “Just because someone can’t take their tray off and they don’t have the ability to \nmove themselves doesn’t mean that that tray has become a restraint.”  Tr. at 3493.  “[I] didn’t see \nany cases where someone was using a tray but could have been able to self-propel themselves if \nthe tray wasn’t there.”  Tr. at 3494 (Schmeler). \nSome wheelchairs of CHDC have padded trays.  A tray serves a variety of purposes as: a \nfunctional activity surface; an adaptive support where a communication device is mounted; a \nstabilization bar or strap support; sensory support where sensory equipment can be attached; or \nassistance in upright positioning.  Tr. at 5283, 5284 (Hancock).  Lateral pads to wheelchair trays \nprovide an alternative to more restrictive supports such as chest straps, shoulder straps, or \nharness type straps.  Tr. at 5284 (Hancock).  There may be a few individuals who have \n  284\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 285 of 383\nequipment on their wheelchairs which may be considered a restraint.  “But that all passes \nthrough the appropriate channels before anything is ever done, and it’s very limited.”  The \npurpose would be to limit their hand and leg movement for safety reasons while they are \ntransported around campus.  Tr. at 5308, 5309 (Hancock). \n \nORAL HYGIENE \n  The dental and hygiene services were the best practices model and met accepted \nprofessional practice.  Tr. at 3327 (Sheppard).  PT and OT participation in the dental services \nand oral hygiene was accepted practice.  Tr. at 3327 (Sheppard).   \n  CHDC has one full time dentist and one full time oral hygienist on campus.  Tr. at 3321 \n(Sheppard).  Residents are seen quarterly for oral examinations and for planning of any dental \nprocedures.  Tr. at 3321.  There is specialized equipment to minimize aspiration that might occur \nduring oral examination.  Tr. at 3322.  The specialized dental equipment was best practice.  Tr. at \n3327 (Sheppard).  An oral hygiene progress note is provided for the chart.  Tr. at 3322 \n(Sheppard).  Dental hygienists participate in training staff on dental hygiene and in providing \nservices as needed and requested by the houses.  Tr. at 3322 (Sheppard).   \n    \nVI.  THE DOJ HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED A VIOLATION OF THE INDIVIDUALS \nWITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT (IDEA) IN THAT THERE HAS NOT \nBEEN A SHOWING THAT CHDC HAS NOT PROVIDED STUDENTS WITH A \nFREE AND APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION (FAPE) OR THAT \nSTUDENTS AT CHDC ARE NOT RECEIVING THEIR EDUCATION IN THE \nLEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT \n \nAt trial the DOJ failed to demonstrate that CHDC is not in compliance with the IDEA, \nthe students at CHDC are not provided FAPE, or that they are not receiving services in the least \n  285\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 286 of 383\nrestrictive environment.  Conversely, the State of Arkansas defended the special education \nservices offered at CHDC by showing that the special education department at CHDC is \ncomplaint with the IDEA, is meeting and exceeding generally accepted professional standards, \nand through the IEP process and admissions process, CHDC is also ensuring that students are \nreceiving their education in the least restrictive environment.  The Defendants’ education experts \nboth testified that CHDC is providing FAPE and that CHDC is in full compliance with the \nIDEA.  They also explained that FAPE can only be determined by evaluating each student \nindividually.  The Department of Justice failed to prove that even one (1) child at CHDC was not \nprovided a Free and Appropriate Public Education at CHDC or was not receiving services in the \nleast restrictive environment.      \nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) was created to manage federal \nfunds that are allocated to assist the states in educating handicapped children.  To receive federal \nmoney, a state must provide all handicapped children with “a free appropriate public education” \noften referred to as “FAPE,” 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400(c), 1414(b)(2)(A), 1415, 1416.  A free \nappropriate public education means special education and related services.  Id.  “Special \neducation means “specially designed instruction at no cost to parents or guardians, to meet the \nunique needs of a handicapped child, including classroom instruction, instruction in physical \neducation, home instruction, and instruction in hospitals and institutions.” § 1401(16).  “Related \nservices are defined as transportation, and such developmental, corrective and other supportive \nservices … as may be required to assist a handicapped child to benefit from special education.”  \nExamples of ‘related services’ identified in the Act are speech pathology and audiology, \npsychological services, physical and occupational therapy, recreation, and medical and \ncounseling services.” § 1401(17). \n  286\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 287 of 383\n  Although it is not the only element of the IDEA, FAPE is the key to deciding whether a \nschool district, or in this case an ICF/MR, is in compliance with the Act. The Supreme Court \nanalyzed the IDEA and the concept of FAPE in Board of Education v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, \n203 (1982).    The IDEA requires participating states to provide, at public expense, instruction \nand support services sufficient “to permit the child to benefit educationally from that \ninstruction.” “The IDEA does not impose upon States any greater substantive educational \nstandard than would be necessary to make such access meaningful.”  Id. at 192.  In creating the \nIDEA, Congress expressly stated “the process of providing special education and related services \nto handicapped children is not guaranteed to produce any particular outcome.”  S. Rep., at 11, \nU.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1975, p. 1435.    \n  “The primary safeguard is the obligatory development of an individualized education \nprogram (“IEP”).” Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 181.  The IEP compiles information and goals about a \nparticular student’s educational progress and must include “statements about the child’s current \nperformance, long-term and short-term instructional targets, and objective criteria for measuring \nthe student’s advance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1401(19); 34 C.F.R. § 300.346 (1989). \n  Typically, the development of an IEP requires the participation of a team of individuals, \nincluding the parents, the child’s teacher, designated specialists, and a representative of the LEA. \n20 U.S.C. § 1401(19); 34 C.F.R. § 300.344.  Once developed, an IEP must be reviewed annually \nand revised when necessary. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1414(a)(5), 1413(a)(1), (11); 34 C.F.R. § 300.343(d).   \n  The question of whether an IEP is “adequate and appropriate” is a mixed question of fact \nand law.  Lachman v. Illinois State Bd. of Educ., 852 F.2d 290, 293 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 \nU.S. 925 (1988); Gregory K. v. Longview School Dist., 811 F.2d 1307, 1310 (9th Cir.1987).  \nLike other mixed questions, measuring the adequacy and appropriateness of an IEP requires the \n  287\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 288 of 383\ncourt to determine whether certain facts possess, or lack, legal significance in a given case.  In \nshort, the court is required to make its judgment, applying “a legal standard to a particular set of \nfacts.” TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 450 (1976).  Therefore, the question of \nwhether a student’s IEP complies with the IDEA can only be decided on an individual basis after \nthe Court has considered whether the facts of an individual case are such that the IEP is \ninappropriate.      \n   Defendants and their experts demonstrated and offered proof that FAPE is and has been \nprovided at CHDC.  Even though the DOJ’s sole education expert, Dr. Thibadeau, stated many \ntimes that the educational services at CHDC were not in compliance with the IDEA, she could \nnot show even one (1) student for which FAPE was not provided at CHDC or even one (1) \nparent, for that matter, who was dissatisfied with the education their child was receiving at \nCHDC.   \nDr. Thibadeau also made several inaccurate statements to support her conclusions, which \nwere not supported by anything other than her cursory review of CHDC and a minimal number \nof educational records, including preliminary notes taken by Arkansas Department of Education \nSurveyors, which were chosen for her review by attorneys working for the Department of \nJustice.    \nDefendants’ experts, Dr. Bruce Gale, a child psychologist and IDEA expert as well as \nDerek Nye, a special education instructor, transition specialist, and director of the ARC of \nCumberland County, New Jersey, both testified that they did independent reviews of the \neducation provided to CHDC students.  They also both testified that CHDC is providing FAPE to \nits students and fully complies with the IDEA.  Tr. at 5690 (Gale). \n \n  288\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 289 of 383\nD.  BOARD OF EDUC. V. ROWLEY, 458 U.S. 176 (1982) \n \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Rowley is the most pertinent law with regard to this \nmatter because it focused on two issues: (1) what is meant by the Act's requirement of a “free \nappropriate public education” and (2) what is the role of state and federal courts in exercising the \nreview granted by 20 U.S.C. § 1415.  Id. at 186.   Rowley relied upon the legislative history of \nthe IDEA to determine whether the IDEA indicated a congressional intent that such education \nmeet some additional substantive standard that the States maximize the potential of handicapped \nchildren.  The Court ultimately decided that the intent of the IDEA was not to “displace the \nprimacy of States in the field of education, but only for States to receive funds to assist them in \nextending their educational systems to the handicapped.”  Id. at 208.   \nIn Rowley, the plaintiff, Amy Rowley, challenged the State of New York because the \nState denied her parent’s request to provide a qualified sign-language interpreter in all of her \nclasses.  The District Court found that although the child was advancing in her classes from \ngrade to grade, she was not performing as well academically as she would without her handicap \nand, therefore, was not receiving a “free and appropriate public education.”  The Court of \nAppeals affirmed this decision.  The United States Supreme Court disagreed, however stating: \n“noticeably absent from the language of the statute is any substantive standard prescribing the \nlevel of education to be accorded handicapped children.” Id. at 189.  “Whatever Congress meant \nby an ‘appropriate’ education, it is clear that it did not mean a potential-maximizing education.”  \nId. at 197.   \nIn its decision, the Supreme Court discussed at length what was meant by the term “free \nappropriate public education” focusing mainly on the term “appropriate.”  In doing so, the \nSupreme Court discussed legislative history of the IDEA, the language of the statute and the two \n  289\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 290 of 383\ncases which served as the impetus for the creation of the IDEA, Pennsylvania Assn. for Retarded \nChildren v. Commonwealth, 334 F. Supp. 1257 (Ed. Pa. 1971) and Mills v. Board of Education \nof District of Columbia, 348 F. Supp. 866 (D.C. 1972).  Rowley at 193.  Both cases held that \nhandicapped children must be given access to an adequate, publically funded education, and \nneither case assured that any particular substantive level of education was required.  Id. at 193.  \nThe Supreme Court found that in the Act, Congress did not use the word “appropriate” as a term \nof art. Id. at 197.  “The term ‘free appropriate public education’ means special education and \nrelated services which (a) have been provided at public expenses, under public supervision and \ndirection, and without charge, (b) meet the standards of the State educational agency, (c) \nincluded an appropriate preschool, elementary, or secondary school education in the State \ninvolved, and (d) are provided in conformity with the individualized education program (IEP) \nrequired under section 1414(a)(5) of this title.” Id. at 188.  These preceding four items are the \nsubstantive requirements of the IDEA.  Further, the Supreme Court specifically stated “to require \nthe furnishing of every special service necessary to maximize each handicapped child’s potential \nis, we think, further than Congress intended to go.”  Id. at 199.  “The District Court and the Court \nof Appeals erred when they held that the Act requires New York to maximize the potential of \neach handicapped child commensurate with the opportunity provided non-handicapped children. \nDesirable as that goal might be it is not the standard that Congress imposed upon States which \nreceive funding under the Act.  Rather, Congress sought primarily to identify and evaluate \nhandicapped children and to provide them with access to free public education.”  Id at 200.  “We \ntherefore conclude that the ‘basic floor of opportunity’ provided by the act consists of access to \nspecialized instruction and related services which are individually designed to provide \neducational benefit to the handicapped child.”  Id. at 201.  “Entrusting a child’s education to state \n  290\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 291 of 383\nand local agencies does not leave the child without protection.”  Id. at 208.  “Congress’ intention \nwas not that the Act displace the primacy of States in the field of education, but that States \nreceive funds to assist them in extending their educational systems to the handicapped.  \nTherefore, once a court determines that the requirements of the Act have been met, questions of \nmethodology are for resolution by the States.”  Id. at 208. \nThe Supreme Court explained that the IDEA recognizes that federal courts cannot run \nlocal schools. Local educators deserve the latitude to determine the individualized education \nprogram most appropriate for each disabled child.  Just as CHDC deserves the latitude, in \nconjunction with the Arkansas Department of Education, to determine what is appropriate for \neach child’s individual education program.  In Rowley, the Supreme Court intended to instruct \nother courts that the IDEA does not deprive these educators of the right to apply their \nprofessional judgment.  Rather, it establishes a basic floor of opportunity for every handicapped \nchild.  States must provide specialized instruction and related services “sufficient to confer some \neducational benefit upon the handicapped child,” but the Act does not require “the furnishing of \nevery special service necessary to maximize each handicapped child's potential.”  Id. at 201. \nUltimately, the Supreme Court made an individual determination of whether Amy \nRowley was denied a free appropriate public education by evaluating the legislative history of \nthe IDEA, the intent of Congress, the express language of the Act and the detailed facts of Amy \nRowley’s education program.  The Court held that even though she was not afforded a sign \nlanguage interpreter, the overall educational program she was afforded did not fail to comply \nwith the substantive requirement of the Act.  The Court also stated that the “lower courts should \n  291\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 292 of 383\nnot have concluded that the Act requires the provision of a sign-language interpreter.” Id. at \n210.4             \nE.  STUDENTS’ INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS (IEP) ARE \nINDIVIDUALIZED AND CALL FOR AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF \nTIME IN SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSES DETERMINED ANNUALLY \nBY THEIR INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PROGRAM TEAM  \n \nStudents at CHDC have an IEP meeting annually where the IEP team discusses what is \nneeded for each student at CHDC to obtain a meaningful education. Tr. at 2118 (Milum).  The \nminutes of special education class are listed in the IEP.  Tr. at 2382-2383 (Thibadeau). \n   Students’ IEPs are individualized, therefore, an individualized review of each IEP is \nrequired in order to determine whether FAPE was or was not provided.  Tr. at 5639 (Gale).  As \npart of a student’s school day, and in line with the IDEA, students at CHDC receive special \neducation instruction as well as related services as part of their school day.  Tr. at 6449-6450 \n(Buck).  Related services are occupation therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy, activities of \ndaily living, toileting skills, psychology services, money management and job training.  Tr. at \n6449-6450 (Buck). Students at CHDC receive meaningful free and appropriate education related \ntraining during the entire day up to 9:00 p.m.  Tr. at 5551 (Gale). \nIt is the position of the Arkansas Department of Education that habilitation training and \nactivities of daily living are acceptable as part of an educational school day.  Tr. at 3043-3044 \n(Harding).  The Arkansas Department of Education does not require students at CHDC to attend \nspecial education instruction for 6 hours a day.  Tr. at 3041 (Harding).  When a student is placed \nin an ICF/MR, the Arkansas Department of Education has found that their need for medical or \n                                                 \n4 This last item is particularly important in that the DOJ has argued that the State is in violation of the IDEA because \nthey have not provided a full time sign language interpreter to CHDC student, L.W.  Even though Defendants \npresented testimony that CHDC did provide a sign language interpreter for a number of hours per week to L.W. and \ndirect care staff were instructed on the signs that L.W. is familiar with, DOJ still argued at trial that this was not \nsufficient and was a clear violation of the IDEA. Tr. at 6490-6492, 6494-6495, 6529 (Buck).  What is clear is that \nthe Supreme Court of the United States disagrees with this argument, ironically the same unsuccessful argument that \nwas advanced by Amy Rowley.  \n  292\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 293 of 383\npsychological treatment and intensive training supersedes their need to sit for six hours in a \nclassroom.  Tr. at 3041-3042 (Harding).  Under Rowley, “a local educational agency simply \nmust show that each IEP is reasonably calculated to confer an educational benefit and to allow \nthe student to progress adequately from grade to grade.”  Id. at 204.  The IDEA does not require \nthe School District to show that the IEP will confer an educational benefit.  Not only would this \nmisstate the standard, but it would constitute an impossible burden to meet. No school can \nguarantee that an IEP will prove successful or that minutes in a classroom are more beneficial \nthan related services.  The federal regulations explicitly disclaim the notion that an IEP provides \na guarantee of any sort. See 34 C.F.R. § 300.350.  “But in seeking to provide such access to \npublic education, Congress did not impose upon the States any greater substantive educational \nstandard than would be necessary to make such access meaningful.” Rowley at 204.  CHDC \nprovides related services to help students improve behavior, communication skills, coping with \nmedical conditions and becoming more sufficient so that students can transition back to their \nhomes and public schools.  The related services provide the student with ways to manage their \ndisabilities which in many cases acted as a barrier for those students in public schools.  CHDC is \nproviding its students with a meaningful education by providing its students with special \neducation instruction as well as needed related services.   \nEach student at CHDC has an IEP in accordance with the IDEA.  The members of the \nIEP team are present to make professional judgments regarding what is best for each individual \nstudent and what is necessary to make each student’s education meaningful.  Tr. at 5135 (Nye).  \n“The Act requires participating States to educate a wide spectrum of handicapped children, from \nthe marginally hearing-impaired to the profoundly retarded and palsied. It is clear that the \nbenefits obtainable by children at one end of the spectrum will differ dramatically from those \n  293\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 294 of 383\nobtainable by children at the other end, with infinite variations in between.” Id. at 202.   It is not \nalways immediately clear what is best for each student, particularly when a student is diagnosed \nwith profound mental retardation, by only completing a cursory review of a student’s educational \nrecords.  A more detailed review is required which includes a child’s parents, treating \nprofessionals and special education providers.  These reviews are conducted at the student’s IEP \nmeeting where the child’s treating professionals, teachers and the child’s parents or guardian \ndiscuss the child’s individual situation and agree on how they can make education services \nmeaningful for that child.   \n  This decision must not be taken away from the State and the child’s parent or guardian.  \nThe Supreme Court has already stated in the Rowley that it is not the job of the federal courts to \nmake such determinations, they are specifically reserved for the States and the appropriate \neducation agencies; in this case, the State of Arkansas and the Arkansas Department of \nEducation.  It was the DOJ’s burden to show that there are students at CHDC who are not \nbenefiting from the accommodations made for them by the facility or that they are not provided \nwith an IEP.  The DOJ argued that students will not elevate to regular education because they are \nnot provided enough special education services.  However, this misstates the intent of the IDEA \nand the purpose of special education.  “The IDEA does not contemplate that special education is \nlike the minor leagues, where success will elevate a student into the major leagues of regular \neducation.”  Board of Educ. of Downers Grove Grade School Dist. No. 58 v. Steven L., 898 F. \nSupp. 1252,1262 (N.D. Ill. 1995).  Courts have held that the minutes a student spends in a \nclassroom are not a deciding factor of whether FAPE is provided.  “The IDEA, however, does \nnot require that every minute of the school day be devoted to these endeavors; each IEP is \nindividualized to the needs of each disabled child, some of whom might need more than 180 \n  294\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 295 of 383\nminutes of special education, some of whom might need less.”  Barber v. Bogalusa City School \nBd.  2001 WL 667829, 6 (E.D.La. 2001).  Barber stated this notion correctly in recognizing that \ndetermining whether FAPE was provided under the IDEA is an individual inquiry.  The DOJ was \ncharged with proving at trial that there were students at CHDC who needed more minutes in a \nclassroom and that those students were denied those minutes of special education and, therefore, \ndenied FAPE.  In fact, Susan Thibadeau was questioned on what “is enough” in terms of minutes \nthat the students spend in a special education classroom and she could not definitively say.  Tr. at \n2195 (Thibadeau).  The reason Ms. Thibadeau could not provide a definitive answer to the \nCourt’s question is because this is an inquiry that must be done on a case-by-case basis – student \nby student.  What might be enough time in a special education classroom for one student may be \nnot enough for another.  The DOJ has not shown that any amount of minutes for any student at \nCHDC was inappropriate or that the time a student is participating in related services resulted in \na loss of educational opportunity.   \nIn an attempt to prove that students at CHDC are not spending an appropriate amount of \ntime in special education classes, the DOJ presented an IEP from Sheridan School District, the \ndistrict that a CHDC student attended before admission to CHDC.  However, as Defendants’ \neducational expert, Bruce Gale, pointed out, it is not an appropriate comparison and it then \nbecame clear that the DOJ was mistaken in its position.  Dr. Gale testified that the IEPs from the \nstudent’s last placement could not be compared to the student’s IEP at CHDC because the IEPs \nlist minutes of special education per week and students at CHDC have more weeks of class than \n  295\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 296 of 383\nstudents in Sheridan School District.  Therefore, a yearly average is more appropriate when \nevaluating how many minutes in special education students at CHDC are receiving. 5 \n  The Defendants’ educational expert, Dr. Gale, testified that he personally witnessed many \nstudents practicing functional academics throughout their day.  Tr. at 5692-93 (Gale).  So even if \na child is not in special education class, they are still learning functional academics such as using \nsilverware, communicating and attention skills. \n  That being said, these are all issues of methodology, and as discussed earlier, Rowley \nspecified that “questions of methodology are for resolution by the States and Courts lack the \nspecialized knowledge and experience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of \neducational policy.”  Rowley at 208.  The minutes that each student spends in special education \nclass is something that is determined on a case-by-case basis at CHDC and listed in each \nstudent’s IEP.  How many minutes each student at CHDC should spend in a special education \nclass is a question of educational policy.  Therefore, it is not something that a Court can \n                                                 \n5 The DOJ asked defense expert Bruce Gale to comment on the IEP of C.W. when C.W. was enrolled at Sheridan School \nDistrict and to compare the minutes of special education he was receiving to what his receiving now at CHDC.  In response \nto these exhibits, Dr. Gale testified:   \n \n“Well, boy, we've got an apple and Bermuda comparison here. You have to do a yearly \naverage. So is it 450 per week times a year or 1,250 per week times a typical school year?  \nThese aren't comparable. I understand the numbers look the same, but you have to \nunderstand for the total year how many minutes of education are occurring, and I just \nremembered -- I mean, you know, first of all, I mean, I remember C.W. He is the child \nwho reported to me that he killed animals and he is the child who can't tell time. And he \nis the child who has verbal skills but talked about messing up, and messing up means \nkilling animals and fighting with his brother. And when I looked into more details of that, \nI remember that his emotional behavior is extraordinarily unstable. That's C.W.”   \nTr. at 5772 (Gale).   \n \nSome students at CHDC, C.W. in particular, come with severe emotional and behavioral disorders where they require more \nrelated services than minutes of classroom instruction.  C.W. is a prime example of a student at CHDC who the IEP team and \nparents are working with to resolve these severe difficulties so that he can return to public school.  Interestingly, DOJ did not \nindicate to the Court whether C.W. has made progress since he has been at CHDC, either socially or academically.  DOJ only \npresented the minutes in the classroom and expects this Court to make a cursory decision based on that alone, which would \nnot only be past any latitude the Supreme Court gave to lower courts, but would also be a disservice to C.W. and other \nstudents like him.  It also ignores the fact that a team of professionals together with the parent is making professional \njudgments regarding his education and what is individually best for him.  This is a judgment that should be left to the IEP \nteam to make.     \n \n  296\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 297 of 383\ndetermine for Arkansas students across the board or at CHDC.  To determine how many minutes \na particular student should have in a special education classroom would require this Court to \nmake a decision for a student that requires specialized knowledge of how many minutes that \nstudent can tolerate and how many other related services are needed to accommodate the student, \nwhat issues caused them to leave their home school district and what would be needed for a \nmeaningful education for the student.  The Supreme Court has ruled that this is not an \nappropriate decision for a Court to make and it should be left for resolution by the State agencies.   \n \nF.  THE IDEA DOES NOT REQUIRE A REGULAR EDUCATION TEACHER \nTO ATTEND IEP MEETINGS \n \n  CHDC is not required to have a regular education teacher at every IEP meeting if the \nchild is not likely to be participating in regular education classes.  CHDC does not violate IDEA \nprocedural safeguards by having a special education teacher attend an IEP, when the student is \nonly receiving special education classes.   \nPrior to 1997, the IDEA provided that the school district was \nobligated to include the student’s current teacher as a member of \nthe IEP team. In 1997, Congress revised the IDEA to require the \ninclusion of ‘at least one regular education teacher of such child (if \nthe child is, or may be, participating in the regular education \nenvironment)’ and ‘at least one special education teacher, or where \nappropriate, at least one special education provider of such child.’  \nM.L. v. Federal Way Sch. Dist., 394 F.3d 634, 643 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting 20 U.S.C. § \n1414(d)(1)(B)).  That court found that the school district did not violate the procedural \nsafeguards of the IDEA by not including the student’s regular education teacher or even current \nteacher for that upcoming year.  M.L., 394 F.3d 634, 643.  There are two material facts at issue \nhere – (1) whether CHDC includes a regular education teacher at the IEP meetings and (2) \nwhether the decision not to include a regular education teacher results in the students’ loss of an \n  297\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 298 of 383\neducational opportunity.  If the exclusion of a regular education teacher did not result in the loss \nof an educational opportunity then there is no violation of the IDEA.  The Defendant developed \nevidence at trial which supported the fact that if a student is participating in any general \neducation curriculum, they will not be admitted to CHDC.  The 5 conditions to be admitted to \nCHDC are (1) behavior that could not be managed in the community setting, (2) medical \nconditions that could not be managed in the community setting, (3) any student who was enrolled \nin general education classes could not be admitted to CHDC, (4) student could not be a safety \nrisk to the other students at CHDC, and (5) there has to be a peer group for that individual at \nCHDC in order for them to be admitted.  Tr. at 5145-5146 (Nye). \n  The IDEA allows CHDC to include only special education teachers in the IEP process if \nthe student is not attending regular education classes and is not likely to attend regular education \nclasses. Id.  Current CHDC students do not participate in regular education services and the DOJ \nhas produced no evidence that any particular student at CHDC is participating in regular \neducation services or is likely to participate in regular education classes, during the course of the \nyear following the IEP meeting.  The DOJ cannot show that CHDC failed to comply with the \nIDEA merely because regular education teachers do not participate on IEP teams at CHDC.   The \nDOJ is required to show that there are children at CHDC who otherwise would be participating \nin regular education classes and are not afforded the benefit of a regular education teacher at the \nIEP meeting.   \nThe permissible exclusion of a regular education teacher at IEP meetings is also \nsupported by the interpretive notes to the relevant IDEA regulations, which provide that “[t]he \nregular education teacher who serves as a member of a child’s IEP team should be a teacher who \nis, or may be, responsible for implementing a portion of the IEP, so that the teacher can \n  298\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 299 of 383\nparticipate in discussions about how best to teach the child.”  34 C.F.R. PART 300 APPENDIX A, \n# 26.   The students at CHDC cannot participate in general education classes and no portions of \nthe students’ IEP’s are implemented by regular education teachers.  The students at CHDC do \nnot participate in regular education classes due to the severity of their disabilities, which in many \ncases include serious health and behavior problems.   Some of the children at CHDC were \nmoved to CHDC after the child’s school or their parent/guardian determined that it was no \nlonger possible for them to attend classes in the public school system. The students at CHDC \nhave assessments that indicate that they are not likely to succeed in regular education classes, \nand, therefore, no regular education classes are recommended and no regular education teacher is \nresponsible for implementing any portion of the IEPs.  Therefore, according to the interpretive \nnotes, no regular education teacher is required to attend IEP meetings at CHDC.     \nIn M.L. v. Federal Way School Dist., the court held that a harmless error standard should \nbe applied in deciding whether or not the absence of the regular education teacher was such that \nthe student was denied a FAPE. M.L., 394 F.3d  at 636.  In order for the absence of a regular \neducation teacher to be a procedural violation that results in a denial of a FAPE, the absence \nmust be such that it results in a loss of educational opportunity or seriously infringes upon the \nright of parental participation in the IEP process.  Id. at 658.  The DOJ has failed to provide the \nCourt with any facts to show that any student at CHDC has been deprived of an educational \nopportunity. Further,  \nwhile a regular education teacher must be a member of the IEP \nteam if the child is, or may be, participating in the regular \neducation environment, the teacher need not (depending on the \nchild’s needs and the purpose of the specific IEP team meeting) be \nrequired to participate in all decisions made as part of the meeting \nor to be present throughout the entire meeting or attend every \nmeeting.... The extent to which it would be appropriate for the \n  299\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 300 of 383\nregular education teacher member of the IEP team to participate in \nIEP team meeting must be decided on a case-by-case basis. \n 34 C.F.R. Part 300 APPENDIX A, # 24.  When the relevant law is applied to the circumstances of \nstudents at CHDC, it is clear that CHDC has not denied any of its students a free and appropriate \npublic education by failing to include a regular education teacher at the IEP meetings.   \n  The Defendants proved at trial that each student is evaluated to determine whether it is \nlikely that he or she would be able to participate in the regular education environment in the \nupcoming year.  Once that determination is made, CHDC determines whether a regular \neducation teacher should be included in the IEP meetings. The law is clear that the determination \nof whether a regular education teacher is included in the IEP meeting should be done on a case-\nby-case basis. See e.g. M.L., 394 F.3d 634.   The DOJ and its expert have not done a case-by-\ncase analysis of even one (1) child at CHDC and has not proven that any child at CHDC is \nparticipating in regular education without the benefit of the participation of a regular education \nteacher at the IEP meeting, and, therefore, the DOJ has failed to show that any student at CHDC \nhas been denied FAPE.   \n  Additionally, the recent Arkansas Department of Education monitoring report found no \ndeficiencies at CHDC for having only special education teachers at the IEP meetings.  Tr. at \n2396 (Thibadeau).  As stated previously, the IDEA does not require specific standards to be met, \nthis is the job of the Arkansas Department of Education.  As long as CHDC is meeting the \nrequirements of the State agency as well as meeting the other 3 substantive requirement of the \nIDEA, then they are in compliance with the IDEA and no court action is appropriate.    \nTherefore, since the substantive requirements of the IDEA have been met, and the DOJ did not \n  300\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 301 of 383\nmeet their burden in showing any CHDC student who did not receive an educational benefit \nfrom the education they received there, CHDC is not in violation of the IDEA. \n \nG. THE IDEA DOES NOT REQUIRE A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY \nREPRESENTATIVE TO ATTEND IEP MEETINGS AND THE \nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS FAILED TO SHOW THAT AN LEA IS \nNOT PRESENT FOR IEP MEETINGS AT CHDC  \n \n  As a procedural matter, the IDEA requires states and local education agencies (LEAs) to \n“assure that handicapped children and their parents...are guaranteed procedural safeguards with \nrespect to the provision of free appropriate public education.” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(a).   A LEA is a \nlocal representative who is familiar with the general curriculum, to supervise the course of study \nof special education and have knowledge of the resources of the agency.  Tr. at 5212-13 (Nye).  \nAn IEP team member can qualify as an LEA if that person can satisfy all three requirements.  Tr. \nat 5212-1523 (Nye).  CHDC consistently invites the local education agency representative to \neach student’s IEP meeting.  Tr. at 5214, 2395 ( Nye, Thibadeau).  The particular LEA invited \ndepends on the school district where the child resided immediately before CHDC admission.  \nAlthough the IDEA does not require that an LEA attend each IEP meeting and CHDC has no \nauthority to compel the LEA’s attendance, CHDC continues to invite an LEA to each IEP \nmeeting.  LEA’s usually affirmatively request that CHDC conduct subsequent IEP meetings \nwithout their attendance. Tr. at 5214 (Nye).   \n  Susan Thibadeau, Derek Nye, Thoronda Smith and Judy Buck all testified that CHDC \nroutinely invites an LEA to each IEP meeting held at CHDC.  Tr. at 2157, 2395, 5214 (Smith, \nThibadeau, Nye).  However, LEA representatives can choose not to attend the IEP meetings even \nif they are invited.  Tr. at 5214 (Nye).  Susan Thibadeau also testified that the ADE monitoring \nreport of June 16, 2010 cited no concerns on the issue of LEA representative attending IEP \n  301\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 302 of 383\nmeetings.  Tr. at 2396 (Thibadeau).  Marcia Harding furthered this point when she testified that \n“nothing can be done to compel outside agencies to attend the IEP meeting.”  Tr. at 2992 \n(Harding). \n  The IDEA expressly permits members of the IEP team to be excused. 28 U.S.C. § \n1414(d)(1)(C).  Legislative history for this section of IDEA demonstrates Congress’ recognition \nthat requiring all IEP team members to attend all meetings concerning a disabled child may be \nunnecessary and onerous in some circumstances. See H. Rep. No. 108-77, at 110 (2003) (noting \nthat the 1997 amendments to the IDEA “allow local educational agencies to better utilize their \npersonnel who are not needed for a particular meeting”).  Legislative history reflects a similar \nintent to streamline the “manifestation determinations review” (“MDR process”), as the statute \nwas amended in 1997 to require only “relevant” members of the IEP team to make manifestation \ndeterminations, as opposed to the entire IEP team.  Id. at 116-20.  If the LEA believes certain \nstatutorily-required IEP team members are not essential to the MDR process, those persons may \nbe excused.   \nOnce the IEP is completed, CHDC sends the LEA a full copy of the student’s IEP for the \nLEA’s review, along with a letter requesting that the LEA contact CHDC if the LEA has any \nquestions or comments Tr. at 5214 (Nye).  As to students at CHDC, LEA’s do not provide access \nto the general curriculum, make no formal referral for educational services at CHDC, and bear \nno financial responsibility for the educational costs of the students at CHDC Tr.at 2395 \n(Thibadeau).  CHDC has had many LEA’s attend the administrative staffing IEP meetings either \nin person or by teleconference Tr. at 2157 (Smith).  At trial, CHDC produced examples of letters \nsent to the LEA’s notifying them of each IEP meeting for children in that LEA’s district Tr. at \n6476 (Buck); Def. Ex. 472.   \n  302\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 303 of 383\n  CHDC has complied with the IDEA on this issue by inviting the appropriate LEA to each \nIEP meeting.  CHDC furthers its compliance with the IDEA by sending a copy of each student’s \nIEP to the LEA for its review.  CHDC has complied fully with this provision of the IDEA and \nthe Arkansas Department of Education is satisfied with CHDC’s efforts to invite LEA’s to the \nIEP meetings.  In short, LEA’s are not required to attend, and CHDC, ADE or DOJ cannot \nlegally compel them to attend.  Also, the fact that they have not attended, is not a violation of the \nIDEA and does not mean that CHDC is not providing students with FAPE.  Whether an LEA \nattends the meeting or not, the topic of least restrictive environment is still routinely discussed at \neach IEP meeting Tr. at 5216 (Hancock).  Therefore, no child at CHDC has been denied FAPE \nor denied any rights afforded them by the IDEA just because an LEA is not in attendance at their \nIEP meeting.   \n \nH. CHDC REQUESTS THE ATTENDANCE OF OUTSIDE AGENCIES AT \nIEP MEETINGS AND PARENTS/GUARDIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO \nEXCLUDE THOSE AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES FROM IEP \nMEETINGS \n \nBeginning at age sixteen (16), the IDEA requires that a student’s IEP include a statement \nof needed transition services. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A)(vii)(II).  Transition services are based \non a student’s needs and interests and “promote movement from school to post-school activities, \nincluding ... vocational training, integrated employment ... continuing and adult education, adult \nservices, independent living or community participation.” 34 CFR § 300.43 (a).  They may \ninclude “instruction, related services, community experiences, the development of employment \nand other post-school adult living objectives, and, when appropriate, acquisition of daily living \nskills and functional vocational evaluation.” 20 U.S.C. § 1401(30).  See also Tammy S. v. \nReedsburg School Dist., 302 F.Supp. 2d 959, 976 (W.D.Wis. 2003).   \n  303\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 304 of 383\n  “To the extent appropriate, with the consent of the parents or a child who has reached the \nage of majority ... the public agency must invite a representative of any participating agency that \nis likely to be responsible for providing or paying for transition services.” 34 C.F.R. § \n300.321(b)(3) (emphasis added).  As the law requires, students’ parents’ or guardians’ consent is \nrequired before CHDC can invite outside agencies to the student’s IEP meeting.   \n  The material fact at issue with this requirement is whether the parent consents to CHDC \ninviting an outside agency to participate in the IEP meeting to provide transition services.   \nCHDC obtains permission from a student’s parent or guardian before inviting any outside agency \nto an IEP meeting, including agency representatives who may be able to provide transition \nservices.  Tr. at 3038 (Harding).  For each student reaching the age of sixteen (16), CHDC \nroutinely requests that the student’s parent or guardian give permission to invite an agency \nrepresentative to provide the student with transition services. If the parent or guardian consents, \nan agency representative is invited to discuss transition services. Tr. at 2992, 2397 (Harding, \nThibadeau).     \n  The DOJ has offered no evidence to support its conclusion that Defendants are not \ncomplying with this provision.  CHDC special education staff routinely attempt to obtain \nparent/guardian consent by sending the parent/guardian a form entitled “Permission for Consent \nPrior to Inviting Agencies Related to Transition” prior to each IEP meeting.  Tr. at 6476 (Buck).  \nThat document identifies numerous agencies that might be helpful in planning transition \nstrategies and activities for a CHDC student.  The “Permission for Consent Prior to Inviting \nAgencies Related to Transition” describes the agency to provide transition services to the \nparent/guardian and requests permission of the parent/guardian to invite the listed agencies.  \nAfter CHDC sends the request forms to the parent/guardian, the parent/guardian is asked to fill \n  304\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 305 of 383\nout the form and agree to allow an outside agency to attend the IEP meeting to assist the student \nwith any transition services that may be relevant.  Many times, the parent/guardian chooses not \nto allow an outside agency to attend the IEP meeting, which is his/her right to do.  Tr. at 6476 \n(Buck).  CHDC is complying with the procedural requirements of the IDEA by requesting \nparents’/guardians’ permission to include an outside agency representative to assist with \ntransition services.  This documentation and the corresponding testimony make clear that CHDC \nis complying with the IDEA, and at the very least, show that the DOJ has not met its burden of \nshowing that CHDC is not in compliance with the IDEA.   \n \nI.  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS NOT SHOWN THAT CHDC HAS \nNOT PROVIDED APPROPRIATE TRANSITION SERVICES FOR ITS \nSTUDENTS \n \n  The IDEA defines “transition services” as “a coordinated set of activities for a student \nwith a disability that (a) is designed within an outcome-oriented process, which promotes \nmovement from school to post-school activities, including post-secondary education, vocational \ntraining, integrated employment (included supported employment), continuing and adult \neducation, adult services, independent living, or community participation; (b) is based upon the \nindividual student's needs, taking into account the student's preferences and interests; and (c) \nincludes instruction, related services, community experiences, the development of employment \nand other post-school adult living objectives, and, when appropriate, acquisition of daily living \nskills and functional vocational evaluation.” 20 U.S.C. § 1401(30).   \n“It is important to distinguish between the statement of transition services in the IEP and the \nprovision of transition services.” Urban by Urban v. Jefferson County School Dist., 89 F.3d 720, \n  305\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 306 of 383\n726 (Colo.,1996).6  Technical deviations from the requirements of section 1401(a)(20), such as \nthe failure to include a statement of transition services, do not render an IEP entirely invalid, and \nto hold otherwise would “exalt form over substance.” Doe v. Defendant I, 898 F.2d 1186, 1190 \n(6th Cir.1990); See also Thomas v. Cincinnati Bd. of Educ., 918 F.2d 618, 625 (6th Cir.1990) \n(stating that defendant's failure to provide parent with written notice of new IEP meeting was \nerror of “technical noncompliance which did not result in any substantial deprivation”); Burke \nCounty Bd. of Educ. v. Denton, 895 F.2d 973, 982 (4th Cir.1990) (refusing to award \ncompensatory education when “the procedural faults committed by the Board ... did not cause \n[the child] to lose any educational opportunity”). \n   “The ‘benefit’ conferred by the [IDEA] and interpreted by Rowley must be more than de \nminimis.” Polk v. Central Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16, 853 F.2d 171, 182 (3d Cir.1988), \ncert. denied, 488 U.S. 1030, 109 S.Ct. 838, 102 L.Ed.2d 970 (1989); see also Johnson v. \nIndependent Sch. Dist. No. 4, 921 F.2d 1022, 1025-26 (10th Cir.1990) (“[T]he ‘appropriate’ \neducation required by the Act is not one which is guaranteed to maximize the child's potential.”), \ncert. denied, 500 U.S. 905, 111 S.Ct. 1685, 114 L.Ed.2d 79 (1991).  \n                                                 \n6 In Urban by Urban v. Jefferson County School Dist., 89 F.3d 720, 726 (Colo. 1996), the Court reviewed this same \nissue for a student whose IEP lacked any explicit statement of transition services.  The student’s IEP also failed to \ndesignate a specific outcome for the student once he turned 21 and it did not contain a specific set of activities for \nmeeting that outcome.  The issue that the court considered was whether the student was denied an appropriate \neducation due to the IEP’s lack of any statement regarding transition services. The Court stated “This deficiency, \nhowever, did not amount to a denial of an appropriate education.  Although the IEP did not contain a specific \nstatement of transition services, Gregory was not denied such services.  The IEP contained language which \naddressed Gregory’s transitional needs, such as community awareness, daily living skills, and the ability to pay for \npurchases.  In addition, these services were focused on teaching Gregory to generalize and transfer skills from one \nenvironment to another.”  “Gregory’s IEP was reasonably calculated to enable him to receive benefits.  In the \ncontext of a severely disabled child such as Gregory, the benefit conferred by the IDEA and interpreted by Rowley \nmust be more than de minimis.” Id at. 727.  Again it is clear that Courts need to do an individual inquiry to be able \nto determine whether a student is denied FAPE.   \n  \n \n  306\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 307 of 383\n  Even in instances where a student does not have an explicit statement of transition \nservices, the Courts have held that this is not enough to hold that the school district was not \ncomplying with the IDEA.  At CHDC, once a student turns 16 years old, their IEP contains an \n“Individual Transition Plan.”  Tr. at 6476 (Buck).  The State is in complete compliance with the \nIDEA with regard to transition services.   The evidence is clear that CHDC students’ IEPs \nconform to the requirements of the IDEA by explicit inclusion of transition services.  Also, the \nevidence supports that CHDC sends parents a list of outside transition services who could attend \nthe IEP to assist with transition services if the parent chose to have them present.  Ms. Thibadeau \ntestified that she evaluated forms that were sent from CHDC to parents and guardians asking \nthem for permission to invite transition specialists to the IEP meeting.  Tr. at 2300 (Thibadeau).  \nDefense witness, Judy Buck, a CHDC Special Education Supervisor, reinforced this point by \nidentifying Defense Exhibit 472 as an example of the document that is sent to parents of students \n16 years or older at CHDC regarding transition service providers who are willing to attend the \nstudent’s IEP.  Judy Buck also testified that a transition plan is always in place within the \nstudent’s IEP by the time the student turns 16. Tr. at 6476 (Buck).  Thoronda Smith also testified \nthat Transition services are provided at CHDC to help the individuals to learn words or \ntechniques, performing out in the community or to living in a community, functional safety \nsigns, cooking, cleaning, washing and drying clothes.  She also testified that she is involved by \nadministering the life centered career assessment test which she uses to develop a student’s \ntransition goals and objectives.  Tr. at 2168 (Smith). \nThe IEPs that were entered into evidence are further proof of CHDC’s efforts to provide \nstudents with transition services.   As further evidence of this, the DOJ could not present even \none (1) student who did not have a transition plan.  Instead they resorted to picking at various \n  307\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 308 of 383\nminute details regarding whether the transition plans took into account the student’s interests.  In \nfact, Ms. Thibadeau testified about a transition plan that in her opinion was deficient because it \nfailed to take the student’s interests into consideration. Tr. at 2354-55 (Thibadeau).  Defense \nwitness Judy Buck, however, testified that CHDC uses the Life Centered Career Education \nAssessment, a professionally accepted tool in the field of education, which assesses the student \nfor a vocation.7  Tr. at 6464 (Buck).  Interestingly, Susan Thibadeau did not evaluate that \nstudent’s Life Centered Career Assessment to see how that assessment aided CHDC in their \ninclusion of certain vocations in which to train that particular student.   Thibadeau also did not \nindicate in her testimony or in her expert report that she discussed this transition plan with the \nstudent’s guardian or with the student.  So it should be assumed that this is the vocation that the \nstudent actually chose for themselves through the assessment tool.   \n  Nevertheless, the evidence supports that each student at CHDC has an IEP that is \nreasonably calculated to enable the students to receive educational benefits and transition \nservices, and that transition plans are present and functional for each CHDC student 16 or older.  \nAnd as case law dictates, it is not whether the IEP explicitly states transition services, but rather, \nthe test is whether the IEP contains language that addresses the student’s transitional needs.  \nTherefore, the record supports the proposition that not only do CHDC students have IEPs which \naddress transitional needs, but they are also receiving assessments specific to what the student \nwants as a vocation.  Once the assessment is complete, the student is provided with a complete \ntransition plan.  This is just one example of how CHDC complies with the IDEA and succeeds in \n                                                 \n7 Judy Buck described the Life Centered Education Assessment stating “It has different jobs in it. And it has \npictures of all the jobs, so you can use it with someone whether they are verbal or not. And it will have like three \npictures together. And it may have gardening and car maintenance and someone working in a restaurant. And they \nmark which picture as they go through. Then at the end, it's analyzed by a data sheet. And it shows --you add all \ntheir scores up of which pictures they mark. The pictures fit into different categories. And the majority, you know, \nthat they have marked in a certain area will tell you what their interests are. It will show whether they are into like \ngardening and plants and that or if they are into automotive or if they are into public service.” Tr. at 6464 (Buck). \n \n  308\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 309 of 383\nproviding their students with not only FAPE, but also the most comprehensive education \npossible.    \nJ.  STUDENTS AT CHDC ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE STATEWIDE \nASSESSMENTS \n \n  CHDC special education staff do not perform Statewide Assessments because CHDC is \nexempt from the No Child Left Behind (“NCLB”) requirements.  NCLB does not apply to \nICF/MR 24-hour care and supervised living residential facilities.  \n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (“ESEA”) permits states to voluntarily \nparticipate in a federal-state partnership in the area of public education.  In return for federal \nmoney, participating states agree to comply with federal requirements that are designed to \nenhance the quality of elementary and secondary education and to further academic achievement.  \n20 U.S.C. § 6301, et. seq.   The NCLB Act amended ESEA to “ensure that all children have a \nfair, equal and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach, at a \nminimum, proficiency on challenging state academic achievement standards and state academic \nassessments.” Id.   As a means of holding states accountable for the federal funding they receive, \nNCLB requires states to make annual assessments of all public school students and to use the \nresults of these assessments in determining whether schools and districts have made adequate \nyearly progress toward the NCLB’s overriding goal of academic proficiency for all students.   \n  Defendants do not challenge the aim of the NCLB, however, Defendants do challenge the \nDOJ’s assertion that the students at CHDC are required to participate in statewide assessments.   \nCHDC is exempt from NCLB because CHDC does not exist for the primary purpose of \nobtaining an education.  It is not an elementary or secondary school as defined by Arkansas law.   \nWhile CHDC must offer education services to children who are school-aged, CHDC is not \ndesignated under state law as a school or school district.  Therefore, CHDC is not subject to \n  309\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 310 of 383\nNCLB standards for core academic subject area instruction nor is it required to have the school-\naged children at CHDC participate in statewide benchmark testing programs.  \n  The ADE is in regular contact with CHDC education administrators. In fact, in August of \n2009, the ADE specifically communicated to CHDC that CHDC is exempt from the required \nassessments of NCLB because CHDC is a 24-hour residential care facility. 8  Tr. at 3048 \n(Harding).     \n  Additionally, there is no correlation between a special education student being assessed, \nand a special education student participating in the general education curriculum.  All CHDC \nstudents access the Arkansas Framework General Education Curriculum through the \ndevelopment and instruction of their formal IEP goals and objectives. CHDC students are \nassessed regularly for educational progress.  The ADE June 16, 2010 report, which noted no \nconcerns with this issue, is further support for this conclusion.  \n \nK. CHDC STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING AN EDUCATION IN THE LEAST \nRESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT \n \nThe Supreme Court requires lower courts to engage in an analysis of whether a student’s IEP \nsatisfies the substantive standards of the IDEA.  The Court in Rowley noted that the IDEA \n                                                 \n8 Marcia Harding explained why CHDC is exempt when she testified at trial.   \n“In the beginning, when our state plan was developed for consistency with No Child Left \nBehind, it was indicated and accepted by the U.S. Department of Education peer review \nthat since they were not elementary and secondary schools, that they would not be \nnecessary to include them, that NCLB applied only to secondary and elementary public \nschools. So at the time we were under that impression and, therefore, the rules \npromulgated by the Department of Education excluded these types of nonpublic school \nsettings, nontraditional programs. They had programs of education, but they were not \npublic schools. And so at the time, we thought we were doing what we -- what was \napproved and appropriate. We have since begun to move in the direction – beginning this \nyear, we are including our incarcerated students. And so the movement now is toward \nlooking at how to best involve and engage these other students, but we were not found to \nbe out of compliance for not having had them in there before because these are not \ndefined to be elementary and secondary schools.”   \nTr. at 3048 (Harding).   \nTherefore, they were not included in the statewide testing program. \n  310\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 311 of 383\n“requires participating States to educate handicapped children with non-handicapped children \nwhenever possible.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 202.  \n  Title 20 U.S.C. § 1412(5)(a) requires that participating States establish “procedures to \nassure that to maximum extent appropriate, handicapped children, including children in public or \nprivate institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not handicapped, \nand that special classes, separate schooling or other removal of handicapped children from the \nregular education environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the handicap is such \nthat the education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be \nachieved satisfactorily.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(5)(a). \n  “Correctly understood, the correlative requirements of educational benefit and least \nrestrictive environment operate in tandem to create a continuum of educational possibilities.” \nRowley, 458 U.S. at 181.  “To determine a particular child’s place on this continuum, the \ndesirability of mainstreaming must be weighed in concert with the Act’s mandate for educational \nimprovement.” Lachman, 852 F.2d at 296.  “Assaying an appropriate educational plan, therefore, \nrequires a balancing of the marginal benefits to be gained or lost on both sides of the maximum \nbenefit/least restrictive fulcrum. Neither side is automatically entitled to extra ballast.”  Roland \nM. v. Concord School Committee, 910 F.2d 983, 993 (1st Cir.1990). \nThe IDEA's implementing regulations provide that disabled children are to be educated in the \nleast restrictive environment (“LRE”). 34 C.F.R. § 300.550(b)(1). Therefore, a school district \nmust provide that instruction in the least restrictive environment, which means the disabled \nstudent is to be educated with nondisabled students to the “maximum extent appropriate.” Pachl \nv. Seagren, 453 F.3d 1064, 1067 (8th Cir.2006) ( citing 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)).  Consequently, \n“a disabled student should be separated from his peers only if the services that make segregated \n  311\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 312 of 383\nplacement superior cannot ‘be feasibly provided in a nonsegregated setting.’ “ Id. (quoting \nRoncker v. Walter, 700 F.2d 1058, 1063 (6th Cir.1983)); see also T.F. v. Special Sch. Dist. of St. \nLouis County, 449 F.3d 816, 820 (8th Cir. 2006) (noting IDEA reflects a “strong preference” \nthat disabled children attend regular classes with nondisabled children and a presumption in \nfavor of public school placement). \n  The Eighth Circuit explains that the mainstreaming requirement “is inapplicable where \neducation in a mainstream environment ‘cannot be achieved satisfactorily.’” Pachl, 453 F.3d at \n1068.  Segregating a child from the mainstream setting is allowed when “ ‘the handicapped child \nwould not benefit from mainstreaming’ when ‘any marginal benefits received from \nmainstreaming are far outweighed by the benefits gained from services which could not feasibly \nbe provided in the non-segregated setting,’ and when ‘the handicapped child is a disruptive force \nin the non-segregated setting.’ ” Id. (quoting Roncker, 700 F.2d at 1063). \n  Typically the students at CHDC are placed there because placement in a regular \neducation setting was unsuccessful due to the student’s disability, and exacerbated by medical or \nbehavior difficulties. Tr. at 5147 (Nye).  Once a student is able to benefit from mainstream \neducational services, CHDC transitions the student into a mainstream setting. Tr. at 5150 (Nye).  \nCHDC assesses each child individually as to whether it is feasible for him or her to receive \neducation in a general education setting.  Tr. at 5216 (Nye).  At trial, the DOJ implied that \nbecause some students at CHDC came from a mainstreamed education setting before, those \nstudents should be in a mainstreamed education setting now.  However, Defendant’s expert, \nDerek Nye, testified to precisely this type of misperception.  Mr. Nye testified that, in studying \nthe students at CHDC, there are no students at CHDC now that came from the general \ncurriculum.  Tr. at 5143 (Nye).   About half of the students came from a residential setting where \n  312\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 313 of 383\nthey received services in their home.  The other half of students at CHDC came from completely \nself-contained classrooms with no interaction with non-disabled peers.  Tr. at 5143 (Nye).  Most \nof the students at CHDC came from residential settings or self-contained classrooms where they \nhad little to no contact with non-disabled peers.  Tr. at 5143 (Nye).  This material fact flatly \ncontradicts the DOJ’s representation that most students at CHDC moved to an educational \nenvironment that is much more restrictive than their prior placement. \n  Defendants’ educational expert, Dr. Gale, testified to the concept of least restrictive \nenvironment by stating:  \nSo it's not in any way and should never be a thought \nthat just because there's a community environment, that's \nautomatically less restrictive. You really have to have a good \nunderstanding of the integrative nature of what CHDC is and look \nat planned, careful transitions.   \nTr. at 5771 (Gale).  Contrary to the DOJ’s assertions at trial, Dr. Gale testified that he found no \nevidence of any provider that could meet the needs of any CHDC student. Tr. at 5757 (Gale).  \nDOJ’s assertions show a complete disregard for the welfare of the CHDC residents, while \ncompletely ignoring the actual needs, progress, safety, and reduction in the level of \nrestrictiveness being provided to these CHDC students.  \n  Additionally, students at CHDC have constant contact with their non-disabled peers \nthrough the CHDC volunteer program in which school-aged children volunteer in CHDC \nclassrooms and interact with the students at CHDC.  Tr. at 5232 (Nye).  The children who \nvolunteer help with classroom activities, physical activities, games, and other social outings \ninvolving CHDC students. Tr. at 5232 (Nye). \n   During trial, the DOJ attempted to mischaracterize the intent of the IDEA by implying \nthat the Act requires students to regularly interact with their non-disabled peers.  The IDEA does \n  313\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 314 of 383\nnot require that disabled students interact with non-disabled peers. The IDEA only requires that \nstudents receive a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment. 20 \nU.S.C. § 1400 et seq.  Students at CHDC are assessed by the IEP team annually to ensure that \nthey are receiving services in the least restrictive setting for their needs.  Tr. at 5151-52 (Nye).  \nIEP teams have determined that CHDC is currently the least restrictive environment for the \nstudents served at the facility, and each student is receiving a free appropriate public education in \nthat setting.  Furthermore, parents of CHDC students wish for their children to stay at CHDC for \nthe educational opportunities that they receive there.  Tr. at 3270 (Catron).   Defense witnesses, \nMelissa Catron, a registered nurse, and Michael Black, a federal employee, are parents of CHDC \nstudents.  Both of these parents testified that their children R.C. and H.B, respectively, were in \npublic schools before coming to CHDC and both of their children have made notable progress \nsince their admission to CHDC. Tr. at 3262, 6833 (Catron, Black).   Melissa Catron testified that \nher son R.C. was having serious behavior issues at the public school which included injuring \nother students.9  Tr. at 3263 (Catron).  CHDC makes an assessment for R.C. every year on \nwhether it is appropriate to transition him back into a public school.  Tr. at 3271 (Catron).  This \ndecision is made by the team which includes Ms. Catron and a transition specialist.  Tr. at 3271 \n(Catron).  Melissa Catron testified that she attends R.C.’s IEP meetings annually and grants \npermission to CHDC to invite a transition specialist to attend the IEP.  Tr. at. 3271 (Catron). \n  The Court heard testimony from Judy Buck, an education supervisor and Instructor II at \nCHDC, who attested to the fact that each year students are assessed for transition and that it is a \n                                                 \n9 The following is an excerpt from testimony given by Melissa Catron regarding her son, R.C., and the reasons why \na public school setting is not appropriate for her son.  “At about age eight, he started becoming violent towards other \nchildren, other -- towards the teachers and the aides. And when he would have issues like that, they, basically, for \nthe safety of the other children, of course, they would suspend him. I would have to come home from work and take \ncare of him three and four days at a time, which made it very close to losing my job because of it.”  Tr. at 3263 \n(Catron). \n  314\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 315 of 383\ngoal at CHDC to transition students back into public schools whenever appropriate.   Tr. at 6465 \n(Buck).  Ms. Buck also testified that CHDC holds MAPS meetings when the team determines \nthat the student is ready to transition back to public school.  According to Ms. Buck, a MAPS \nmeeting can be called at any time and by anyone, including the parent or even an outside agency.  \nTr. at 6479-80 (Buck), Def. Ex. 465.  Marcia Harding also commented on the issue of least \nrestrictive environment in stating that she would be exceeding her authority to step in to move a \nchild to a less restrictive environment because she is not part of the IEP team.  Tr. at 3059 \n(Harding).   If the IEP team and the parent are in agreement on the least restrictive environment, \nthen Ms. Harding cannot substitute her own opinion for that individual student.  She also can not \npre-determine what the IEP team outcome has to be or use sanctions to substitute her views for \nthe team’s decision.  Tr. at 3059 (Harding).   Also worth noting, the Arkansas Department of \nEducation did not find any deficiencies in the area of least restrictive environment.  Tr. at 2399 \n(Thibadeau). \n  CHDC is evaluating its students annually to determine whether they are in the least \nrestrictive environment.  Among its efforts, CHDC holds annual IEP meetings which include the \nparent and the students’ teachers and other professionals as well as a transition specialist if \npermission is granted for them to attend.  CHDC also facilitates Multiple Agency Planning \n(MAPS) meetings if a student is determined by the team to be ready for transition or if someone \nfeels that the student could benefit from more transition services by multiple agencies.  CHDC \ndoes regular evaluations for students, always with the goal of moving them back into the public \nschools.  CHDC is in full compliance with the least restrictive environment requirement of the \nIDEA and is in full compliance with ADE rules and regulations for ensuring that its students are \nreceiving their education in the least restrictive environment.   \n  315\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 316 of 383\n \nL.  CHDC IS IN FULL COMPLIANCE AND IS FULLY COOPERATING \nWITH THE ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE \nMONITORING REPORT REQUIREMENTS  \n \n  The Arkansas Department of Education (“ADE”) conducts monitoring of school districts \nall over the state of Arkansas.  Tr. 3036-38 (Harding).  The purpose of the survey is to improve \nthe quality of services that the school is providing and ensure that they are complying with the \nIDEA.  Tr. at 5579 (Gale).   \n  In an effort to produce evidentiary support that does not exist at CHDC, the DOJ \nmischaracterized the recent ADE monitoring of CHDC.  In an attempt to do so, The DOJ called \nMarcia Harding, the ADE Associate Director, to testify to the recent ADE monitoring of CHDC.  \nHowever, Ms. Harding testified that in her experience there have been instances where a school \ndistrict did not comply with the IDEA and it did not result in a denial of FAPE.  Tr. at 3014 \n(Harding).  She also testified that the presence of a technical violation of some sort does not \nequate to students being denied FAPE.  Children can still receive FAPE even though there is a \ntechnical violation present.  Tr. at 3050 (Harding).  \n  The DOJ attempted to argue at trial that since there were areas of possible non-\ncompliance contained in the ADE monitoring report of CHDC, this was a clear indication that \nCHDC is not providing FAPE to its students.  However, Ms. Harding, the DOJ’s own witness, \ntestified that the monitoring ADE completed at CHDC was not on the basis of pattern or practice \nas it had been in the past, therefore, if even just one instance of noncompliance was present then \nthere was a finding recorded in the monitoring report.  Tr. at 3014 (Harding).  Ms. Harding also \ntestified that the ADE monitoring report does not reflect whether the finding of noncompliance \nwas in one case or all cases at CHDC, so if there is a finding of noncompliance in just one case, \n  316\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 317 of 383\nthen it must be cited as a finding in the monitoring report.  Tr. at 3014 (Harding).  Therefore, it \ncannot be concluded that the findings listed in the monitoring report are found program wide or \nsystemically.  Tr. at 3015 (Harding).  In fact, Ms. Harding testified at trial that it is her opinion \nthat it is difficult to stay in a continuous state of compliance.  Tr. at 3034 (Harding).  In fact, \nthere were seven (7) school districts in Arkansas this year that were designated as high risk \nbecause of the degree to which they found those schools out of compliance. Tr. at 3034 \n(Harding).  CHDC was not one of these seven (7).   \n  Marcia Harding also testified that ADE monitors take notes as they go through the \nvarious sites and talk to people during monitoring, and the notes taken by monitors during \nmonitoring are not intended to be final conclusions or established facts.  Tr. at 3033 (Harding).  \nShe also testified that a note is not an official finding.  Tr. at 3033 (Harding).  It was further \nestablished by Defendants at trial that ADE monitors were given the report by Department of \nJustice witness Susan Thibadeau before they even began monitoring of CHDC.  Tr. at 3033 \n(Harding).  Therefore, it is unknown whether notes contained in the monitoring file refer to \nconcepts developed by Ms. Thibadeau which surveyors were attempting to keep in mind rather \nthan actual observations by the ADE monitors.  Tr. at 3034 (Harding).  Curiously, rather than \ncalling one of the actual monitors who were responsible for this report and the notes contained in \nthe ADE monitoring file, such as Janet Estes, to prove their case, the DOJ chose to call Marcia \nHarding, the director of education services, who, incidentally, played no direct part in the \nmonitoring of CHDC.   \n  The ADE report also frequently contained sections which contained the phrase \n“insufficient evidence.”   Defendants’ expert, Derek Nye, testified that this term does not \n  317\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 318 of 383\nrepresent a deficiency, rather it means that there is not enough clear evidence to support a clear \nruling.  Tr. at 5166 (Nye). \n  On top of this cluster of testimony by Marcia Harding who was not even remotely \nfamiliar with the notes contained in the ADE monitoring file, the DOJ inappropriately elicited \ntestimony from their expert Thibadeau on her evaluation of the notes made by ADE monitors \nduring their review of CHDC where she guessed as to the meaning of those notes.   Susan \nThibadeau went on in an attempt to bolster her own testimony by citing the areas where the ADE \nreport found deficiencies that corresponded with items contained in her report.  However, she \nfailed to cite a standard or define for the court how these items caused FAPE to be withheld from \neven one (1) student at CHDC.  The Defendants are working closely with the ADE to correct any \ndeficiencies noted in the 2010 monitoring report and Marcia Harding testified that CHDC has \nbeen extremely cooperative with ADE throughout this process. Tr. at 3036 (Harding). The ADE \nmonitoring is an example of how the State is managing the educators within its borders and \nensuring that they are complying with the IDEA.   Most importantly, there has been no \ndetermination by the ADE that FAPE has not been provided at CHDC.  Marcia Harding \nexplicitly stated under oath that the determination of whether FAPE has been provided is a very \nlarge process and she was not requested to undertake that process.  Tr. at 5176 (Nye).   \n  CHDC submitted a corrective action plan to ADE, before their deadline for a corrective \naction plan, on July 14, 2010.  Tr. at 3037 (Harding).  Two of the eight areas of noncompliance \nwere immediately resolved when the ADE accepted information provided by CHDC as sufficient \nand no further action has been necessary.  For the other six areas, CHDC is working closely with \nADE to provide them more specific evidence and details.  Tr. at 3037 (Harding). \n  318\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 319 of 383\n  The monitoring report was not a determination of whether FAPE was provided at CHDC, \nand the ADE monitoring report is a different type of review and is not intended to provide that \ntype of information.  The Court should not use the ADE monitoring report as a key to \ndeciphering whether FAPE is provided at CHDC and it was inappropriate for Ms. Thibadeau to \nattempt to misuse the ADE monitoring report for that purpose.     \n \nM. THE OPINIONS OF SUSAN THIBADEAU WERE NOT RELIABLE AND \nSHOULD BE ACCORDED LITTLE OR NO WEIGHT BY THE COURT \n \n  As described in the Defendants’ Proposed Findings of Facts, DOJ’s education expert, \nSusan Thibadeau lacked factual foundation for her opinions, exhibited bias, relied on unreliable \nevidence, misrepresented the evidence, and failed to establish relevant standards and what \nconstituted a substantial departure from accepted professional standards.  \n  For example, Ms. Thibadeau formed an opinion that CHDC is not devoting sufficient \ntime to teaching children to toilet.  She testified at trial that this opinion was formed by only \nreferring to the IEP for this information and that she did not look at the IPP. Tr. at 5675-76 \n(Gale).  However, at CHDC, toileting is taught to students by the direct care staff in the living \nunits and recorded on the IPP.  Tr. at 5595 (Gale).  Clearly, Ms. Thibadeau lacked any factual \nfoundation for her opinions and did not partake in any due diligence to learn the inner workings \nof the facility in order to opine on the toileting program at CHDC.   \n  Another example of Thibadeau’s lack of due diligence was clear when she opined on the \nSpecial Treatment Levels of Reinforcement System at CHDC and stated that it was inappropriate \nbecause it denied students their right to receive FAPE.  Tr. at 6455 (Buck).  In reality, a student \nis only held back from going to class when they are on the red level and are not prevented from \nreceiving education services.  Tr. at 6455 (Buck).  In fact, the students who Thibadeau testified \n  319\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 320 of 383\nwere part of the red level of the Special Treatment Levels of Reinforcement System in 2009 \nactually missed no class time in 2009.  Tr. at 5180 (Nye).   \n  Remaining examples exist of Thibadeau failing to exhibit due diligence appeared when \nshe used the notes taken by ADE surveyors to bolster her own opinion without first discussing \nwith the surveyors what they meant by the notes that appear in the ADE monitoring file.  She \nfurther testified at trial during cross-examination that she would not want the notes that she took \nduring her tour of CHDC to be taken as her final opinions.  Tr. at 2402 (Thibadeau).  Ms. \nThibadeau also testified that some students at CHDC should be receiving their education in a less \nrestrictive setting, however, she made no attempt to learn the student’s prior history of placement \nand why a less restrictive placement was not available as determined by the families and treating \nprofessionals of those children.  Tr. at 2369 (Thibadeau).  \nAnother example of inaccuracies in her testimony is when Susan Thibadeau testified that \nmechanical restraint on children is strictly prohibited in Maine, when in actuality, the State of \nMaine Regulations Governing the Licensing and Functioning of Intermediate Care Facilities \nwith Mental Retardation 10-1444 CMR Chapter 18, Effective January 1, 2009 state otherwise.  \nTr. at 2285 (Thibadeau).  Kevin Walsh, a psychologist specializing with children and adults with \ndevelopmental disabilities testified that “Dr. Thibadeau, did not understand what the ICF/MR \nregulations permit relative to programmed use of restraints.” Tr. at 5855 (Walsh). \nThe DOJ also elicited testimony from Susan Thibadeau with regard to several students \nwho Thibadeau thought could receive services in a less restrictive setting.  Tr. at 2306-2314 \n(Thibadeau).  However, Susan Thibadeau did not meet with the IEP teams or observe the IEP \nmeetings of any of these students to determine why the team made the decision not to transfer \nthose students.  She merely looked at the IEP and made a determination by herself without doing \n  320\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 321 of 383\nany further inquiry into medical difficulties or behavioral issues that precipitated the student’s \nadmission to CHDC in the first place.  Thibadeau also failed to inquire into those student’s prior \nplacements, which is an important factor in determining whether a student should transition back \ninto public school.   \n   Susan Thibadeau also reviewed documents from the Department of Justice, including the \ncomplaint and findings letter drafted by the DOJ, which biased her opinions of CHDC before she \neven made her initial visit to CHDC and before reaching her opinions.  Tr. at 2361-62 \n(Thibadeau).  Ms. Thibadeau also admitted at trial that she created invalid data by creating a \ndisruption to the teachers during their class and relying on conclusions based on a disrupted \nenvironment.  Tr. at 2369 (Thibadeau), 5685 (Gale).    \n  Additionally, Susan Thibadeau did not select scientifically valid samples and, instead, she \ntargeted the most difficult and weak cases where CHDC may have deviated from their normal \npractice.  The few examples of alleged less than optimal educational practices are not \nrepresentative of care and services at CHDC.  Ms. Thibadeau opined that resident C.A. could \nfunction in a less restrictive setting with appropriate support but she also testified at trial that she \ndid not evaluate C.A., does not know him and does not know what supports C.A. would need to \nfunction successfully in another educational setting.  Tr. at 2392 (Thibadeau). \n  Finally, Susan Thibadeau testified at trial that she thinks that any amount of mechanical \nrestraint is inappropriate.  Tr. at 2403 (Thibadeau).  However, she went on to testified that she \ndoes not know of any document or standard that disallows the use of mechanical restraint on \nchildren and could not reference even one standard that would support her opinion.  Tr. at 2404 \n(Thibadeau).  \n  321\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 322 of 383\nMs. Thibadeau showed clear bias in her testimony and admitted to using absolutely no \ncomparative data or benchmarks from other facilities or programs including school settings.  Tr. \nat 2409 (Thibadeau).  Unfortunately, the testimony offered by Susan Thibadeau only established \nher personal opinions, that lacked sound scientific analysis, objectivity and diligence necessary \nto assure reliable scientific results, and, therefore, it should be critically examined and given little \nor no weight by the Court.   \n \nN.  CONCLUSION \n \nThe DOJ has not been able to show even one (1) case to support its claims that \nDefendants are not complying with the IDEA and failing to provide FAPE to CHDC students.  \nThe Court should not assume that DOJ actually represents the interest of any student at CHDC.  \nThe parents and guardians of the students at CHDC have not claimed that the educational \nservices are deficient.  To the contrary, parents are part of the IEP team and help to make \ndecisions regarding their child’s education.  The DOJ was unable to present even one (1) parent \nor guardian of a student at CHDC who was alleging that FAPE is not provided to their child.  \nThe DOJ’s claim is based on the flawed, biased and idealistic opinions of Ms. Thibadeau who \nrelied upon distortions of the deposition testimony of CHDC employees and unfounded \nassumptions as to the ADE monitoring report.  \n  The DOJ did not show, as a matter of law, that CHDC does not provide a free and \nappropriate public education to its students and has also failed to prove that even one child was \ninappropriately placed at CHDC.  The DOJ also failed to show that CHDC was violating the \nIDEA by not participating in statewide assessments or requiring a regular education teacher to \nattend the IEP meetings.  Finally, the DOJ also failed to show even one student who has not \nimproved since their placement at CHDC, and, in fact, Defendant’s provided testimony by two \n  322\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 323 of 383\nparents of two different CHDC students who testified that their children have made substantial \nprogress at CHDC and that they think that CHDC is the least restrictive placement for their child.  \nCHDC is in compliance with the IDEA and is providing FAPE to its students in the least \nrestrictive environment possible.  The State of Arkansas has an active and effective Department \nof Education which works with CHDC to ensure compliance with the IDEA.  It is not the job of \nthe courts to usurp the power of the Department of Education or to dictate on matters of \neducation methodology.  The Arkansas Department of Education vigorously effectively \ncontinues to work with the school districts within the State, and with facilities like CHDC, of \nwhich the ADE monitoring report is proof.  Therefore, the Court should enter judgment for the \nDefendants with regard to all claims involving the IDEA and least restrictive environment.      \n \nVII.  COMMUNITY PLACEMENT \n \nBased on Arkansas’ total population and the incidence of developmental disabilities in \nthe general population, approximately 88,000 Arkansans have a developmental disability. Tr. at \n5987 (Walsh).  Of those 88,000 individuals, approximately 88 percent are likely mildly disabled, \n8 percent moderately disabled, and the remaining, small minority, are profoundly and severely \ndisabled. Tr. at 5988 (Walsh).  Of the total, Arkansas provides services only to approximately \n1% to 1.5% percent of its developmentally disabled citizens in its human development centers. \nTr. at 5988 (Walsh).  The remaining Arkansans with developmental disabilities are served in \ncommunity-based programs. Tr. at 5988 (Walsh). \nAlthough the Department of Justice is the Plaintiff in this matter, for evidentiary \npurposes, the Court cannot assume that it represents the interest of any CHDC resident or \nguardian. There was no such evidence at trial.  The Department of Justice must prove all of the \n  323\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 324 of 383\nsame elements of a claim that any other plaintiff is required to prove. U. S. v. Pennsylvania, 902 \nF. Supp. 565, 578 (W.D. Pa. 1995) aff’d. U.S. v. Ridge, 96 F.3d 1436 (3rd Cir. 1996). \nO. PLAINTIFF FAILED TO PROVE THAT DEFENDANTS VIOLATE THE \nAMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. \n \nAlthough the evidence in the instant matter is wanting, the United States Supreme \nCourt’s decision in Olmstead v. Zimring is dispositive of Plaintiff’s allegations regarding \ndischarge of CHDC residents to alternative community settings. Olmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. \n581 (1999).10  In Olmstead, an action was filed on behalf of two women with mental retardation \nand co-morbid psychiatric disorders, known by their initials, L.C. and E.W.  After being \nadmitted voluntarily to the Georgia Regional Hospital in Atlanta in May 1992, L.C.’s \nschizophrenia was treated and stabilized.  By May 1993, L.C. expressed a desire to leave the \nGeorgia Regional Hospital and her treating professionals at the facility agreed that she could \nhave her needs met in a state-supported community treatment program.  However, L.C. remained \nin the Georgia Regional Hospital for nearly three more years.  Plaintiff E.W. was voluntarily \nhospitalized at the Georgia Regional Hospital in February 1995 with a diagnosis of personality \ndisorder.  By 1996, E.W. expressed a desire to leave the facility and her therapist concluded that \nshe could be treated in a community-based treatment program.  E.W. was not discharged, \nhowever, after legal action had been brought.  Both women argued that the state’s failure to \ndischarge them to a community-based treatment program violated Title II of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. \nFinding that L.C.’s and E.W.’s continued treatment at the Georgia Regional Hospital \nviolated the ADA, the Olmstead Court developed a three-prong test to determine when the ADA \n                                                 \n10 By Plaintiff’s own admission, its ADA claim in the present case concerns only “residents institutionalized inside \nthe CHDC.”  United States v. State of Arkansas, 4:10CV327 JLH, Document 11 (filed 5/24/10).   \n  324\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 325 of 383\n“require[s] placement of persons with mental disabilities in community settings rather than in \ninstitutions.”  Id. at 587.  The Court instructed that community placement is required when: \n…the State’s treatment professionals have determined that \ncommunity placement is appropriate, the transfer from institutional \ncare to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected \nindividual, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated, \ntaking into account the resources available to the State and the \nneeds of others with mental disabilities.”   \nId.  \n  Interpreting the ADA and the Department of Justice’s regulations issued under it, \nOlmstead emphasized that there is no “federal requirement that community-based treatment be \nimposed on patients who do not desire it.” Id. at 602.  The Court further stressed that “nothing in \nthe ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for \npersons unable to handle or benefit from community settings.”  Id. at 601-02.  “[T]he ADA is not \nreasonably read to impel States to phase out institutions, placing patients in need of close care at \nrisk.”  Id. at 605.  In fact, the Court recognized that “for [some] individuals, no placement \noutside the institution may ever be appropriate.”  Id. (citing and quoting Brief for American \nPsychiatric Association et al. as Amici Curia at 22-23 (“Some individuals, whether mentally \nretarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times—perhaps in the short run, perhaps in \nthe long run—for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community \nsettings”); Brief for Voice of the Retarded et al. as Amici Curiae 11 (“Each disabled person is \nentitled to treatment in the most integrated setting possible for that person—recognizing that, on \na case-by-case basis, that setting may be in an institution”); Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, \n327 (1982) (Blackmun, J., concurring) (“For many mentally retarded people, the difference \nbetween the capacity to do things for themselves within an institution and total dependence on \nthe institution for all of their needs is as much liberty as they ever will know”).    \n  325\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 326 of 383\n \n24. PLAINTIFF PRODUCED NO EVIDENCE THAT TREATING \nPROFESSIONALS AT CHDC HAVE RECOMMENDED DISCHARGE \nFOR A CHDC RESIDENT AND CHDC DID NOT DISCHARGE THAT \nRESIDENT \n \nIn conjunction with Plaintiff’s obligation to prove guardian consent, the Olmstead \ndecision requires Plaintiff to demonstrate that treating professionals have recommended \ndischarge for CHDC residents and that the Defendants’ failed to accommodate that \nrecommendation. Olmstead, 527 U.S. 581, 587.  Plaintiff probed CHDC’s records for nearly \neight years before the trial in this matter.  Yet, at trial Plaintiff offered no evidence that treating \nprofessionals at CHDC had determined that any CHDC resident should be discharged from \nCHDC to an alternative community setting and the guardian consented to the discharge, and then \nresident remained at CHDC.   \nCHDC’s treating professionals make professional judgments on a continuing basis while \nthey are treating CHDC residents. Tr. at 6001(Walsh).  Many of those treatment decisions, \nincluding treating professionals’ determination about the best setting for an individual, are noted \nin residents’ Individual Program Plans. Tr. at 6001 (Walsh).  This system was designed to meet \nand exceed the U.S. Supreme Court’s guidance in Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. \n581 (1999).  \nIn Porter v. Knickrehm, the plaintiff brought a § 1983 claim alleging that in the State of \nArkansas the human development centers’ admission and discharge procedures violated \nconstitutional equal protection and procedural due process rights. Porter v. Knickrehm, 457 F.3d \n794 (8th Cir. 2006).  The Eighth Circuit affirmed that “[p]rocedures under Arkansas statutes and \nunder the internal policies of state human development center (HDC) for admission of mentally \nretarded persons to such centers satisfied procedural due process.” Id. at 799.  The Court found \n  326\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 327 of 383\nthat “[o]nly minimal protections were needed to meet procedural due process requirements for \nadmitting mentally retarded individual to state human development center (HDC), where \nadmission occurred voluntarily by authority of legal guardian.” Id. at 798 (citing Parham v. J.R., \n442 U.S. 584,606 (1979)).  In the instant matter, the Plaintiff seeks to circumvent state laws and \nregulations by imposing its preference for deinstitutionalization on the Defendants.  This Court \nhas already found that the procedures for admission and discharge at the State’s human \ndevelopment centers meet constitutional due process standards. Porter v. Knickrehm, 457 F.3d \n794. \nOlmstead does not require deinstitutionalization or the closure of residential facilities like \nCHDC.  In Conner v. Branstad, a district court soundly reasoned \n[I]f Congress had actually intended to require states to provide \ncommunity based programs for mentally disabled individuals \ncurrently residing in institutional settings, it surely would have \nfound a less oblique way of doing so. \n \n Conner v. Branstad, 839 F. Supp. 1346, 1357 (S.D. Iowa 1993); See also U.S. v. Oregon, 782 F. \nSupp. 502, 514 (D.Or. 1991)(“[P]remature or inappropriate community placements would result \nin a much higher risk of potential harm than residents are exposed to at [the facility].”).   \nIn this matter, Plaintiff offered no evidence of differing professional opinions because its \nonly expert on this issue, Ms. Richardson, is not and has never been a treating professional for \nthe developmentally disabled.  Even if her testimony is construed as questioning the decisions of \nCHDC’s treating professionals, Plaintiff cannot meet its burden of proof by presenting nothing \nmore than (1) a difference of professional opinion as to which practices are appropriate or (2) \nexpert testimony that another course of action would have been better. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at \n321; Collignon v. Milwaukee County, 163 F.3d 982, 987 (7th Cir. 1998); Lelsz v. Kavanagh, 807 \nF.2d at 1243 (5th Cir. 1987); Society for Good Will to Retarded Children, Inc. v. Cuomo, 737 \n  327\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 328 of 383\nF.2d at 1238, 1248 (2nd Cir. 1984); Doe v. Gaughan, 617 F. Supp. 1477, 1487 (D. Mass. 1985), \naff’d, 808 F.2d 871 (1st Cir. 1986); See also Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250, 252 (4th Cir. \n1990) (noting that Youngberg prohibits courts from “weigh[ing] the decisions of the treating \nprofessionals against the testimony of the [plaintiffs’] professionals to decide which of several \nacceptable standards should apply”); U.S. v. Comm. of Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. 565, 584 \n(W.D. Pa. 1995) (“Optimal courses of treatment as determined by some expert, while laudable, \ndo not establish the minimal constitutional standard.”). \n[T]he State generally may rely on the reasonable assessments of its \nown professionals in determining whether an individual ‘meets the \nessential eligibility requirements’ for habilitation in a community-\nbased program. \n \n Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 602; Id. (quoting School Bd. of Nassau Cty. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 288 \n(1987) (“courts normally should defer to the reasonable medical judgments of public health \nofficials”); See also Hanson By and Through Hanson v. Clarke County, Iowa, 867 F.2d 1115 (8th \nCir. 1989). \nLiability may be imposed only when [a] decision by [a] \nprofessional is such a substantial departure from accepted \nprofessional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that \nthe person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a \njudgment. \n \nYoungberg, 457 U.S. at 323. \nDefendants’ treating professionals are exercising professional judgment as to issues of \ncommunity placement. Tr. at 5999 (Walsh).  Plaintiff has offered no evidence to the contrary.  \nThe adequacy of professional judgment should not be based exclusively on what is documented \nin a particular section of a resident’s Individualized Program Plan because what is noted in an \nIPP is a reflection of all of the professional judgments that are continuously made for that \nresident. Tr. at 6001 (Walsh).  CHDC’s IPPs primarily are prepared to comply with federal \n  328\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 329 of 383\nregulations for ICF/MR facilities, which means they contain certain information in a specified \nformat for multiple uses.  Professional judgment exercised by treating professionals at CHDC is \nnot something that is momentary and is not limited to an IPP meeting for a given resident. Tr. at \n5999-6000 (Walsh).  Professional judgment goes on all the time, while professionals work with a \nresident, often on a daily basis. Tr. at 6000 (Walsh).  At the IPP meeting, treating professionals \nhave already made professional judgments about a particular resident. Tr. at 6000 (Walsh).  The \nIPP documents that those professional judgments have occurred. Tr. at 6000 (Walsh). \nIn advance of every IPP meeting, CHDC sends a booklet entitled “Arkansas ACS Waiver \nGuide.” Tr. at 6778 (A. Green), Def. Ex. 410.  That booklet was developed by DDS in \nconjunction with waiver providers to thoroughly explain Medicaid waiver services in Arkansas. \nTr. at 6778-79 (A. Green).  CHDC also provides that booklet to parents and guardians at the time \nof a resident’s admission. Tr. at 6778-79 (A. Green).  Guardians are also sent a document \nentitled, “Individual's Choice of Alternative Community Services Waiver or Intermediate Care \nFacility,” which solicits the guardian’s choice to pursue alternate community waivers or \ncontinued services at CHDC. Tr. at 6777-78 (A. Green), Def. Ex. 406.   \nAt the IPP meeting, CHDC’s program specialists and other team members discuss waiver \nservices with guardians, the interdisciplinary team reviews professional assessments, and the \nteam and guardian discuss the individual’s needs, abilities, and where that individual or the \nguardian would like to receive services. Tr. at 849, 6778 (A. Green).  That discussion is \ndocumented in the IPP. Tr. at 849 (A. Green).   \nAt CHDC, this documentation is a strength in the IPP’s. Tr. at 4041 (Kastner).  There is a \nspecific statement in every IPP about whether Conway represents the least restrictive or most \nintegrated setting. Tr. at 4041 (Kastner).  That is not the typical case at other ICF’s. Tr. at 4041 \n  329\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 330 of 383\n(Kastner).  Most ICF’s do not have such documentation in their IPP’s. Tr. at 4041 (Kastner).  \nThere is no requirement in the ICF/MR regulations that any such documentation occur. Tr. at \n4041 (Kastner).  CHDC is actually ahead of most facilities in that they have an individualized \nstatement in every IPP under a heading called \"transitional plan.\" Tr. at 4041 (Kastner).  That \ndocumentation is exceptional. Tr. at 4041 (Kastner).  It exceeds ICF/MR standards and is much \nbetter than the process at other ICF/MR facilities. Tr. at 4041 (Kastner).   \n \n25. PLAINTIFF PRODUCED NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY CHDC \nRESIDENT OR GUARDIAN WANTS TO BE DISCHARGED FROM \nCHDC \n \nThe evidence in the instant matter is sharply distinguishable from Olmstead.  In the \ninstant matter, Plaintiff produced no evidence at trial that any CHDC resident, or guardian of a \nCHDC resident, wants to be discharged from CHDC.  Unlike the Olmstead case, Plaintiff’s \ncounsel in this matter has not been retained by any resident or guardian of a resident at CHDC.  \nAny representations from Plaintiff’s counsel in this matter are just a reflection of the DOJ’s \npolitical agenda, and are not supported by actual evidence.  Despite 30 days of testimony, \nPlaintiff’s counsel offered no evidence that any CHDC resident or guardian wants services in the \ncommunity and has been denied those services. \nIn fact, the guardians and families of CHDC residents filed an Amicus Brief because, as \nthey said, the Plaintiff “has displayed almost total indifference to the significant, legal role of \nfamilies and guardians in the admissions of their disabled family members to residential care \nfacilities and in assuring their health and safety, wherever they may reside, showing also lack of \ndeference to the United States Supreme Court decision in Olmstead.” U.S. v. Arkansas, 4:09-cv-\n033 JLH, Document 50 (filed 8/27/10), page 24.   \n  330\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 331 of 383\nAlthough guardians of CHDC residents have no obligation to defend their decisions \nregarding the treatment and care of their loved ones, at trial, Defendants offered testimony from \nseveral CHDC guardians.  Earline Stoddard is the mother of a resident at CHDC with the initials \nA.S.  Tr. at 3229 (Stoddard).  Ms. Stoddard has been a nurse since 1963.  Tr. at 3230 (Stoddard).  \nHer son has lived at CHDC since he was approximately 10 years old.  Tr. at 3230 (Stoddard).  \nA.S. has severe developmental disabilities that cause him to be non-verbal and suffer seizures.  \nTr. at 3231 (Stoddard).  Ms. Stoddard visits her son often at CHDC.  Tr. at 3232 (Stoddard).  Ms. \nStoddard testified that she is permitted to see her son at any time and she often comes to visit \nhim without making an appointment or giving advance notice.  Tr. at 3232 (Stoddard).  Each \ntime Ms. Stoddard visits CHDC, she is permitted to visit with her son at the cottage where he \nresides.  Tr. at 3232 (Stoddard).  In over 40 years of visits to CHDC, Ms. Stoddard, testified that \nshe has never seen anything that would alarm her about the care that is provided to her son.  Tr. \nat 3234 (Stoddard).  She testified further that each time she visits CHDC there is always \nexperienced staff who are also working in the house with new staff.  Tr. at 3234 (Stoddard).  Ms. \nStoddard has never seen her son’s cottage staffed by only new staff. Tr. at 3234 (Stoddard).  \nOther family members also visit A.S. and have never been restricted from seeing A.S.  Tr. at \n3234 (Stoddard). \nA.S. participates in training programs at CHDC such as a walking program and other \ntraining on self care and independent living skills.  Tr. at 3243 (Stoddard).  If A.S. injures \nhimself, CHDC notifies Ms. Stoddard and discusses the injuries with her.  Tr. at 3236 \n(Stoddard).  A.S. participates in community outings with CHDC.  Tr. at 3246 (Stoddard).  A.S. \nhas gone several places off campus including shopping trips and to the county fair.  Tr. at 3247 \n(Stoddard).  A.S. was moved to Willow at one time during an illness and suffered from \n  331\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 332 of 383\ndepression due to the move from his cottage.  Tr. at 3247 (Stoddard).  Once A.S. was moved \nback to his cottage, his mood was stabilized.  Tr. at 3247 (Stoddard).  Ms. Stoddard testified that \nA.S. would not handle a move out of CHDC.  Tr. at 3248 (Stoddard).  A.S. enjoys sounds as \nstimuli and enjoys being in his cottage more than in a quiet place such as Ms. Stoddard’s home.  \nTr. at 3260 (Stoddard).  A.S. enjoys outings off campus only if he is with his caregivers with \nwhom he is familiar.  Tr. at 3259 (Stoddard). \nMs. Stoddard does not wish to seek placement for A.S. in a waiver-funded placement.  \nTr. at 3239 (Stoddard).  She has investigated waiver-funded programs in the past such as group \nhomes in northern Arkansas as well as Easter Seals in Arkansas.  Tr. at 3239 (Stoddard).  Both \nplacements were inadequate to meet A.S.’s needs and Ms. Stoddard is pleased with the care that \nCHDC provides to A.S.  Tr. at 3239 (Stoddard).  Ms. Stoddard testified that she does not wish to \npursue waiver options in the future.  Tr. at 3240 (Stoddard). \nMs. Stoddard attends each annual IPP meeting and has made suggestions at A.S.’s IPP \nmeeting that were received by the IDT team.  Tr. at 3240, 3242 (Stoddard).  The social worker \ninitiates a conversation with Ms. Stoddard regarding community placement for A.S. at each IPP \nmeeting.  Tr. at 3243 (Stoddard).  The social worker does not initiate the discussion regarding \ncommunity placement and waiver apologetically, but rather it is discussed candidly where \nCHDC explains options to be considered.  Tr.  at 3244 (Stoddard).  CHDC mails a packet to Ms. \nStoddard containing information regarding waiver services before the IPP meeting each year.  \nTr. at 3244 (Stoddard). \nMs. Stoddard wishes to do her own thorough investigation into any potential placement \nfor A.S. before that placement will be considered for A.S.  Tr. at 3244 (Stoddard).  To stay \ninformed about waiver options, she makes phone calls, talks to nurses, students, and waiver \n  332\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 333 of 383\nproviders.  Tr. at 3245 (Stoddard).  To date, no placement that Ms. Stoddard has investigated has \nbeen as satisfactory to her as CHDC.  Tr. at 3245 (Stoddard).  \nBarry Landen is guardian for his 55-year-old brother, K.L., who lives at CHDC. Tr. at \n6841, 6842 (Landon).  Mr. Landen is a filmmaker with a bachelor’s degree in cinema studies. Tr. \nat 6841 (Landon).  His brother, K.L., is non-verbal, severely mentally retarded, blind, and \nepileptic. Tr. at 6842 (Landon).  K.L. has limited mobility. Tr. at 6842 (Landon).  As a child, \nK.L. lived in a small group home in Syracuse, New York, that failed to provide him with proper \ncare and supervision which resulted in K.L. getting hit by a car, resulting in several broken bones \nand epilepsy. Tr. at 6843 (Landon).  Mr. Landen’s parents looked at facilities across the country \nand decided to move K.L from New York and placed him at CHDC. Tr. at 6843 (Landon). \nMr. Landen visits his brother every three weeks and takes him to his home for visits over \nthe weekend. Tr. at 6844 (Landon).  Mr. Landen knows all of K.L.’s cottage roommates.  Tr. at \n6846 (Landon).  K.L. is extraordinarily fragile with a lack of balance and no concept of danger, \nbut in the 40-plus years that K.L. has lived at CHDC he has not had any significant injuries.  Tr. \nat 6851 (Landon).  CHDC has at least a 40-year track record of taking excellent care of K.L.  Tr. \nat 6851, 6852 (Landon). \nMr. Landen wants K.L. to live with the people at CHDC because he is familiar with them \nand trusts them.  Tr. at 6853 (Landon).  K.L. has three jobs on campus shredding paper, folding \ntowels and crushing cans. Tr. at 6847, 6848 (Landon).  The interdisciplinary team updates Mr. \nLanden on how K.L. is progressing in his work.  Tr. at 6847, 6848 (Landon).  Mr. Landen has \nbeen to a lot of facilities throughout the years and notices a difference in that CHDC is homelike \nand comfortable whereas others are not.  Tr. at 6846 (Landon).  Mr. Landen has also had in-\n  333\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 334 of 383\ndepth experience with group homes through various projects that he has produced as the director \nof operations at CNN.  Tr. at 6850 (Landon). \nMr. Landen attends all of K.L.’s IPP meetings.  Tr. at 6847 (Landon).  Waiver options are \nbrought up by Shelbie Huff, K.L.’s social worker, at every IPP meeting.  Tr. at 6849, 6850 \n(Landon).  Mr. Landen expresses to the interdisciplinary team that he is not interested in waiver \noptions at each IPP meeting.  Tr. at 6850 (Landon). \nMichael Black is a guardian and parent of a school-aged child at CHDC with the initials \nH.B.  Tr. at 6822 (Black).  Mr. Black is a federal employee and postal worker. Tr. at 6837 \n(Black).  At the time of trial, H.B. was 14 years old. Tr. at 6823, 6824 (Black).  H.B. has a \ncognitive functioning of a two- year-old child and uses a wheelchair. Tr. at 6823, 6824 (Black).  \nHe is somewhat ambulatory and is somewhat verbal, but has a very small vocabulary.  Tr. at \n6822, 6823 (Black).  He is severely mentally retarded with cerebral palsy and has a \nhydrocephalus shunt.  Tr. at 6823 (Black).   \nPrior to seeking H.B.’s admission to CHDC, Mr. Black used waiver-funded programs for \nH.B., including Easter Seals. Tr. at 6825 (Black).  Mr. Black testified that the Easter Seals \nfacility at which H.B. received services was a short term rehabilitation facility, not a long term \ncare facility. Tr. at 6825 (Black).  After four years of working with H.B., Easter Seals discharged \nhim because they decided that his rehabilitation had stopped and he would not progress any \nfurther.  Tr. at 6825 (Black). \nSince H.B. has been at CHDC, his aggression and self injurious behavior has reduced \nfrom occurring once per week to once every 4 to 5 months. Tr. at 6827 (Black).  CHDC has \nworked extensively on H.B.s aggression and self injury, which has resulted in a decrease in the \n  334\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 335 of 383\nnumber of incidents. Tr. at 6827 (Black).  H.B. has required no mechanical restraint in the past \nyear. Tr. at 6827 (Black). \nH.B. lives in a residence that is arranged in a home-like setting with separate sleeping, \neating and living quarters. Tr. at 6828 (Black).  Mr. Black makes regular visits to CHDC to see \nH.B. Tr. at 6827.  H.B. often participates in outings off-campus with his father and the rest of \ntheir family.  Tr. at 6828 (Black).  H.B. also participates in off-campus outings with campus staff \nsuch as fishing trips, the state fair and the movies. Tr. at 6828 (Black).  On cross-examination, \nPlaintiff’s counsel disingenuously asked Mr. Black if EPSDT services were ever offered to his \nson. Tr. at 6838 (Black).  EPSDT services are only available for children with psychiatric illness.  \nTr. at 6838 (Black).  H.B. does not have any psychiatric diagnosis. Tr. at 6823 (Black).  Mr. \nBlack testified that he believes CHDC has adequate staffing to provide H.B. with the level of \nservice and attention that he needs. Tr. at 6831 (Black).  CHDC is familiar with H.B.’s condition \nand his hydrocephalus shunt. Tr. at 6831 (Black).  CHDC is also within close proximity to \nArkansas Children’s Hospital. Tr. at 6831, 6834 (Black). \nMr. Black also attends H.B.’s annual IPP meetings. Tr. at 6829 (Black).  Waiver options \nare discussed regularly with Mr. Black at the IPP meeting for H.B. Tr. at 6830 (Black).  Mr. \nBlack has also independently explored waiver options for H.B. Tr. at 6830, 6831 (Black).  Mr. \nBlack has concluded that waiver-funded programs do not have adequate staffing and are not \nfamiliar with H.B.’s medical condition and requirements with regard to his hydrocephalus shunt. \nTr. at 6831 (Black). \nMr. Black intends for H.B. to transition eventually into a small group home once he gets \nolder and becomes more mature, but he opposes H.B.’s discharge from CHDC at this time. Tr. at \n6832 (Black).  H.B.’s interdisciplinary team is aware of the goal to transition H.B. once he \n  335\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 336 of 383\nbecomes a young adult.  Tr. at 6832 (Black).  H.B. has made immense advancements at CHDC \ndue to the capabilities of the staff. Tr. at 6833 (Black).  Mr. Black is pleased with the services \nthat H.B. receives at CHDC and does not want to move him to anywhere else, including his \nfamily’s home.  Tr. at 6833, 6834 (Black). \nLarry Taylor is the guardian for his sister, C.T., who lives at CHDC. Tr. at 5049 (Taylor).  \nMr. Taylor is a mortgage banker by profession. Tr. at 5049 (Taylor).  He became guardian for his \nsister after his mother and father died. Tr. at 5054 (Taylor).  Larry Taylor’s mother was a co-\nfounder of the Holy Souls School for Exceptional Children, which is now operating as The Allen \nSchool. Tr. at 5051 (Taylor).  C.T. attended that school for as long as it could provide stimulus \nand active treatment. Tr. at 5052 (Taylor).  C.T. is currently 58 years old and functions at a level \nof a two-year-old. Tr. at 5050 (Taylor).  She has lived at CHDC since February 1966, when she \nwas 14 years old. Tr. at 5050 (Taylor).  C.T. has grown and prospered since she has lived at \nCHDC. Tr. at 5053 (Taylor).  Her family explored placements for C.T. all over the country and \nvisited those placements before they chose CHDC for C.T. Tr. at 5053 (Taylor).  Dr. Parmley is \nC.T.’s primary care physician and C.T. receives psychiatric care from Dr. Callahan.  Tr. at 5064 \n(Taylor).  Dr. Parmley and Dr. Callahan consult with each other to provide C.T. with general \nmedical and psychiatric care. Tr. at 5064 (Taylor).  C.T. has severe mental retardation and severe \nmental illness that manifests itself in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Tr. at 5050 (Taylor).  She is \nverbal and able to express her wishes. Tr. at 5051 (Taylor). \nMr. Taylor was previously the vice president of the parents’ association at CHDC and \nnow serves as the president of the statewide parents’ association, Family and Friends of Care \nFacility Residents, which serves as an umbrella organization for family support groups for all of \nArkansas’ human development centers. Tr. at 5055-56 (Taylor).  The Family and Friends of Care \n  336\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 337 of 383\nFacility Residents is a statewide organization which raised funds to help draft and file the \nAmicus Brief in the case at hand. Tr. at 5057 (Taylor).  There are members of Family and \nFriends of Care Facility Residents who have loved ones who are on waiver, but still advocate to \nkeep the human development centers as a resource in the continuum of care for their loved ones. \nTr. at 5058 (Taylor). \nMr. Taylor visits with his sister at least once a week at CHDC and is very involved with \nher treatment and care. Tr. at 5054, 5055 (Taylor).  Mr. Taylor is able to visit C.T. any time \nduring the day or evening and may roam the grounds at CHDC with his sister anytime he likes. \nTr. at 5059 (Taylor).  C.T. visits her brother at his home and oftentimes asks to be returned to \nCHDC, which she calls her “home.” Tr. at 5059 (Taylor).  Mr. Taylor testified that it is important \nto him that staff at CHDC are awake and provide care 24 hours a day. Tr. at 5059 (Taylor).  He \nnoted that CHDC staff do not sleep at night, which is not necessarily the case in community \nsettings. Tr. at 5059 (Taylor). \nMr. Taylor is involved in C.T.’s IPP meeting and provides assistance to the IPP team to \nform C.T.’s program plan. Tr. at 5062 (Taylor).  C.T.’s IPP was admitted as Defendants’ Exhibit \nLT1 which contains a quote from Larry Taylor that he expressed during C.T.’s IPP meeting \nwhich was “CHDC may not be perfect, but it is perfect for C.” Tr. at 5065 (Taylor).  Alternative \nplacement for C.T. is discussed with Larry Taylor at every IPP meeting. Tr. at 5065 (Taylor).  \nMr. Taylor has a long standing relationship with Sandy Moix who works as C.T.’s social worker \nat CHDC. Tr. at 5062 (Taylor).  Mr. Taylor has been approached by CHDC staff in the past with \nregard to alternative placements that CHDC proposed that Mr. Taylor consider for C.T. Tr. at \n5069 (Taylor).  Mr. Taylor has been impressed with some of the waiver-funded providers that \n  337\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 338 of 383\nappeared at the CHDC provider fair, but not impressed so much that he would consider moving \nhis sister from CHDC. Tr. at 5065 (Taylor). \nMr. Taylor is very knowledgeable about waiver-funded programs. Tr. at 5059 (Taylor).  \nHe has investigated several waiver funded programs and has not found one that would meet his \nsister’s needs as well as they are met at CHDC. Tr. at 5060 (Taylor).  He has not seen anything \nwhile touring waiver-funded programs and residential settings that would give him pause or \ncause him to rip C.T. from her home of so many years. Tr. at 5061 (Taylor).  Even though Mr. \nTaylor is extremely knowledgeable about developments and current services available through \nwaiver funded programs, he opposes his sister’s discharge from CHDC. Tr. at 5059 (Taylor). \nMelissa Catron is a mother of a school-aged resident at CHDC. Tr. at 3260 (Catron).  Ms. \nCatron is a registered nurse with an associate’s degree in nursing. Tr. at 3261 (Catron).  Her son, \nR., has lived at CHDC for four years. Tr. at 3262 (Catron).  When R. was living at home, Ms. \nCatron was required to transport him to all medical appointments. Tr. at 3265 (Catron).  R. \nwould react violently in the car and at the doctor’s offices, requiring restraint. Tr. at 3265 \n(Catron).  Ms. Catron testified that R. reacts very badly to change of any kind. Tr. at 3265. \nBefore R. was admitted to CHDC, he attended school at the community school in Herber \nSprings, Cleburne County, which is a public school for handicapped children. Tr. at 3262 \n(Catron).  R.’s education in public schools in Cabot, Arkansas was unsuccessful. Tr. at 3262 \n(Catron).  When attending public schools, R. was always educated with other disabled peers. Tr. \nat 3263 (Catron).  R. was never integrated into a regular classroom and does not tolerate \ninteraction with non- disabled children well. Tr. at 3263 (Catron).  It is better for R. to be \neducated with other disabled peers rather than with non-disabled peers. Tr. at 3264 (Catron).  R. \n  338\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 339 of 383\nis educated in special education classes at CHDC to Ms. Catron’s satisfaction. Tr. at 3269 \n(Catron). \nR. was on several psychotropic medications before he was admitted to CHDC, including \nRisperdal, Propranolol, and Cogentin. Tr. at 3265 (Catron).  CHDC has managed R.’s \nmedications since his admission. Tr. at 3265 (Catron).  CHDC attempted to reduce R.’s \nmedication at one time, which was unsuccessful, so his medication dosage was increased again. \nTr. at 3265 (Catron).  Prior to reducing R.’s psychotropic medication dosage, his physicians \ndiscussed the recommendation to reduce medication with Ms. Catron at R.’s IPP meeting. Tr. at \n3267 (Catron).  With Ms. Catron’s agreement, R.’s dosage of Risperdal was reduced by half, but \nwithin a few days the numbers of incidents of R.’s self-abuse, attacking other people, and \nagitation increased considerably. Tr. at 3267 (Catron).  After these incidents, R.’s dosages were \nincreased to their previous levels and R. has been stable. Tr. at 3267 (Catron).  If R. has medical \nemergencies at CHDC, CHDC has handled them appropriately. Tr. at 3274 (Catron). \nR. does have a Safety Plan and a Strategy Plan. Tr. at 3267 (Catron).  As part of R.’s \nsafety plan, CHDC may use a papoose board with R. as a last resort. Tr. at 3273 (Catron).  R.’s \noutbursts are less frequent at CHDC than when he was living at home. Tr. at 3274 (Catron).  Ms. \nCatron has never disagreed with CHDC about how professionals and staff deal with R.’s \nbehavior. Tr. at 3268 (Catron).  If R. injures himself or someone else at CHDC, Ms. Catron is \nalways notified by CHDC. Tr. at 3269 (Catron). \nMs. Catron makes regular visits to CHDC to see her son. Tr. at 3269 (Catron).  She is not \nrestricted from seeing R. and can visit him at any time she wants and as often as she wants. Tr. at \n3270 (Catron).  R. also participates in community outings with staff and other residents from \nCHDC such as eating out, shopping and basketball games. Tr. at 3273 (Catron). \n  339\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 340 of 383\nMelissa Catron attends R.’s IPP meeting each year where they discuss community \nplacement of R. Tr. at 3271 (Catron).  During the IPP meeting, CHDC initiates the conversation \nwith Ms. Catron regarding R. moving out of CHDC into a waiver-funded program, group home, \nor in home respite care. Tr. at 3272 (Catron).  Ms. Catron testified that the topic of community \nplacement for R. is not brought up apologetically by CHDC, but rather is a genuine discussion. \nTr. at 3272 (Catron). \nBefore admitting R. to CHDC, Ms. Catron spent several years with the waiver program. \nTr. at 3268 (Catron).  She had multiple experiences with direct care staff that were provided \nthrough the waiver program. Tr. at 3268 (Catron).  Often those workers would not show up in the \nmorning when they were scheduled to come. Tr. at 3268 (Catron).  Other aides provided by the \nwaiver would come as scheduled, but were not sufficiently trained to work with a severely \ndisabled child. Tr. at 3268 (Catron).  One aide provided through the waiver was sufficiently \ntrained to work with R., but when the aid was not there R. was so violent at home that it was \nimpossible for Ms. Catron and her husband to properly control R. Tr. at 3268 (Catron).  Prior to \nR.’s admission to CHDC, the state informed Ms. Catron of residential settings that serve \nindividuals with similar challenges that R. presents, including full time residential care. Tr. at \n3275 (Catron).  Ms. Catron testified that the state indicated to her that R. should be placed in a \nresidential facility like CHDC only if it was absolutely necessary. Tr. at 3275 (Catron). \nMs. Catron does not believe that a group home is appropriate for R. at this time. Tr. at \n3270 (Catron).  She believes that R. needs more services than he could get if he was living in a \ngroup home or other community setting. Tr. at 3276 (Catron).  Ms. Catron does not wish to \npursue any other waiver options for R. at this time. Tr. at 3270 (Catron).  Among other reasons, \nMs. Catron testified that CHDC is a better placement for R. than any other community option \n  340\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 341 of 383\ndue to his difficulties with transition and violent outbursts. Tr. at 3272 (Catron).  Ms. Catron \nbelieves that CHDC is the best place for R. at this time because his classes and physicians are on \ncampus. Tr. at 3270 (Catron).  R. handles the transition from classes and locations on the campus \nmuch better than he would in the community. Tr. at 3270 (Catron).  If R. has to see the \npsychiatrists at CHDC and is having a violent episode, CHDC will take R. back to his residence \nand try again later in the day or the following day, which is not an option for Ms. Catron if R. \nwas living at home. Tr. at 3280 (Catron).  Ms. Catron opposes her son’s discharge from CHDC. \nTr. at 3270 (Catron). \nPlaintiff did not offer any testimony, or other evidence, from even one CHDC guardian.  \nThat glaring dearth of evidence necessarily means that Plaintiff failed to meet its burden of \nproof.  Even Plaintiff’s only expert on this issue, Ms. Richardson, testified that she did not \nbelieve that CHDC residents should be forced to leave CHDC without the consent of their \nguardian. Tr. at 637-38 (Richardson). \nThe only CHDC guardians who testified at trial were called by Defendants and were \nunder no obligation to testify11.  CHDC guardians have no obligation to justify their decisions to \nhave their loved ones receive services at CHDC.  Plaintiff has never alleged that any CHDC \nguardian is incompetent or otherwise incapable of making decisions for a CHDC resident.  \nNevertheless, in full public view, CHDC guardians explained their deeply personal reasons for \ntheir respective decisions to have their loved ones receive services at CHDC in order to \ndemonstrate that they have actively made those difficult decisions.   \n \n                                                 \n11 Defendant’s note that Plaintiff subpoenaed Mr. Alan Fortney to testify in their case in chief.  Mr. Fortney testified \nthat he was not the guardian for his step-daughter, and he testified strongly in favor of the care and services that his \nstep-daughter receives at CHDC.  Tr. at 1484-1503 (Fortney). \n  341\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 342 of 383\nP.  PLAITIFF’S ONLY EXPERT ON THE ISSUE OF COMMUNITY \nPLACEMENT, MS. RICHARDSON, OFFERED UNRELIABLE \nOPINIONS AND NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT PLAINTIFF’S BURDEN \nOF PROOF  \n \nPlaintiff’s expert, Ms. Richardson, does not hold a license or degree in any of the areas \nthat CHDC’s treating professionals practice. Tr. at 636, 5983 (Richardson, Walsh).  Ms. \nRichardson is a licensed attorney. Tr. at 519 (Richardson), Pl. Ex. 210-1.  She also has a master’s \ndegree in special education, but has not taught for over 20 years. Tr. at 517-18 (Richardson).  \nShe does not have a degree in social work or any other clinical specialty that would allow her to \nsecond-guess the professional judgment of CHDC’s treating professionals. Tr. at 518 \n(Richardson).  Although she frequently referred to “the profession” throughout her testimony, \nMs. Richardson was never able to articulate to what “profession” she was referring. Tr. at 679, \n688, 689, 716, 737 (Richardson). \n26. MS. RICHARDSON APPLIED NO STANDARDS IN HER \nEVALUATION OF CHDC \n \nAll of Ms. Richardson’s opinions about CHDC should be discounted or completely \nignored by the Court.  She used no standards to assess CHDC, employed no rational \nmethodology, and revealed herself to be nothing more than an advocate with a ideological \nagenda.  She has no relevant clinical training and is not a treating professional. Tr. at 5983 \n(Walsh).  Her opinions about transition services at CHDC were, at best, nothing more than \nspeculation. Tr. at 5984 (Walsh).  Ms. Richardson applied no professionally accepted standards \nto her evaluation of CHDC and she made no attempt to apply minimally accepted professional \nstandards to her evaluation of services at CHDC. Tr. at 675-76 (Richardson).  To the contrary, \nMs. Richardson’s consultation was specifically aimed at her goal of moving people out of CHDC \nto the community. Tr. at 661-62 (Richardson).  Rather than evaluating CHDC objectively, Ms. \n  342\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 343 of 383\nRichardson testified that “[her] role was to support community placement” Tr. at 661 \n(Richardson).  Ms. Richardson also described the purpose of her consultation as follows:  “I was \nlooking at was the question of whether there were people at Conway who could be served in the \ncommunity in a less restrictive, more integrated environment.” Tr. at 662 (Richardson). \nMs. Richardson testified that she was “puzzled” by the phrase “standard of care”. Tr. at \n688 (Richardson).  She also testified that she does not think the standard of care is defined by the \nmajority of professionals because the majority is always going to be behind the curve. Tr. at 688-\n89 (Richardson).  She testified that the standard of care is derived “from people who have \nworking at the forefront of the field” and described it as what “most folks who are writing about \nthe profession and being called upon to develop new aspects of it -- what are they thinking.” Tr. \nat 688 (Richardson).  Ms. Richardson testified that she also considers the relevant standard of \ncare to be “where the profession is headed” a “the standard that is beginning to be embraced by \nstates as people are setting new direction.” Tr. at 689 (Richardson). \nMs. Richardson admitted that her definition of the standard of care is not accepted by a \nmajority of any professionals. Tr. at 688-89 (Richardson).  She testified that she compared \nservices at CHDC to standards “which seem sensible.” Tr. at 528, 674-75 (Richardson).  She \nclaimed that she was unable to apply any professional standards in her evaluation of CHDC \nbecause no one has to live in an “institution [sic] facility.” Tr. at 676 (Richardson).  \nContradicting herself, Ms. Richardson added, “the standard is that nobody [has to live in an \ninstitutional facility]” Tr. at 676 (Richardson).  Although they were described vaguely, Ms. \nRichardson was clear that the standards she applied were “above the mean.” Tr. at 690 \n(Richardson). \n  343\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 344 of 383\nIn an effort to present a veil of legitimacy with her personal agenda, Ms. Richardson also \ntestified that she attempted to interpret language that she selectively reviewed from the DDS and \nCHDC mission statements and then used them as her standard. Tr. at 526, 675-76 (Richardson).  \nHowever, she admitted that she knew the mission statements were not written or intended to be \nan articulation of any professional standard. Tr. at 675, 676, 689 (Richardson).  She also \nadmitted that the mission statements are merely aspirational goals that DDS and CHDC work \ntoward. Tr. at 676 (Richardson).  Although she claimed that she used the DDS and CHDC \nmission statements as standards, Ms. Richardson admitted that at the time she prepared her \nreport, she failed to read CHDC’s entire mission statement and missed specific statements in \nCHDC’s mission statement that CHDC is \"committed to utilize the least restrictive alternatives \nto meet the developmental needs of individuals and foster a return to community living.\" Tr. at \n532, 720 (Richardson).  Ms. Richardson failure to read CHDC’s entire mission and her de facto \nadoption of CHDC and DDS’s mission statements as “standards” was part of a feeble attempt to \ndisguise her inferior work and personal agenda. Tr. at 523, 720 (Richardson). \nMs. Richardson’s distorted concept of standards allowed her to go into CHDC and \nconclude that some individuals could be discharged to community settings, without consideration \nof how those individuals would fare in a community setting, what their needs would be, or even \nwhether those individuals’ guardians want an alternative setting. Tr. at 5986 (Walsh).  She \nadmitted that her review of CHDC and opinions were not mainstream and admitted that she did \nnot necessarily rely on facts or data to reach her conclusions. Tr. at 679-81 (Richardson).  \nAlthough she implied that she was the embodiment of a standard, Ms. Richardson has published \nnothing for at least the past 10 years and none of her work has been subjected to peer-review. Tr. \nat 690, 677 (Richardson); See also Pl. Ex. 210.  Ms. Richardson relied on no case law, including \n  344\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 345 of 383\nthe Olmstead decision in assessing services at CHDC. Tr. at 678-79 (Richardson).  She also \ntestified that her evaluation of services need not be based on the scientific method, but rather on \nbroadly discerning the truth, which Ms. Richardson claims “depends on the person.” Tr. at 680-\n81 (Richardson). \nMs. Richardson admitted that CMS regulations provide the relevant standards of care for \ndischarge and transitions.  She acknowledged that CMS regulates admission and discharge \npractices at ICF/MR facilities, including CHDC. Tr. at 685 (Richardson).  Consistent with the \nOlmstead standard, ICF/MR regulations permit transfer or discharge only when a facility cannot \nmeet an individual's needs, the individual no longer requires an active treatment program in an \nICF/MR setting, the individual or guardian chooses to reside elsewhere, or when a determination \nis made that another level of service or living situation, either internal or external, would be more \nbeneficial, or for any other good cause, including any reason that is in the best interest of the \nindividual. Tr. at 686 (Richardson).  CMS regulations specifically delineate when discharge or \ntransfer of a CHDC resident is required. Tr. at 686 (Richardson).  Ms. Richardson made no \nattempt to apply CMS regulations in her review of discharge and transition practices at CHDC. \nTr. at 686 (Richardson).  She also admitted that neither the ICF/MR regulations nor any other \nprofessional standards require a formal transition plan, as she proposed in her direct testimony. \nTr. at 687 (Richardson). \n \n27. MS. RICHARDSON SUBJECTIVELY SELECTED HER SAMPLE  \n \nMs. Richardson chose the number of CHDC residents that she reviewed because it was “a \nnumber [she] thought [she] could do.” Tr. at 658 (Richardson).  She admitted that the CHDC \nresidents she chose to review were not randomly selected. Tr. at 658 (Richardson).  Ms. \n  345\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 346 of 383\nRichardson did not select CHDC residents for her sample based on any objective criteria and she \ndid not attempt to draw a representative sample of CHDC residents for her analysis. Tr. at 5992 \n(Walsh).  She agreed that her sample was biased in favor of higher functioning CHDC residents \nand was not representative of the population at CHDC. Tr. at 703 (Richardson).  She admitted \nthat forty-five percent of the individuals she reviewed at CHDC were pre-determined to be \namong the most high-functioning CHDC residents. Tr. at 703, 5992 (Richardson, Walsh).  Ms. \nRichardson’s review of CHDC included a bad sample and variables that did not correlate to her \nconclusions. Tr. at 5992 (Walsh).  Any conclusions drawn from Ms. Richardson’s sample cannot \nbe extrapolated to the entire CHDC population.  \n \n28. MS. RICHARDSON’S FLAWED METHODOLOGY   \n \nMs. Richardson had no rational basis for her opinions or conclusions regarding services \nat CHDC. Tr. at 5994 (Walsh).  She used absolutely no clinical process in her evaluation of \nCHDC. Tr. at 5984 (Walsh).  Ms. Richardson admitted that she did not review the quality of any \nservices at CHDC and she made no effort to compare services at CHDC to services offered by \ncommunity- based providers in Arkansas. Tr. at 661, 679 (Richardson).  When questioned about \nher flawed methodology, Ms. Richardson testified that her work in this case was only an \noverview and was not an intensive review. Tr. at 694 (Richardson). \nDespite claiming that she toured CHDC for nine days during 2009, Ms. Richardson \nattended only two IPP meetings. Tr. at 695 (Richardson).  She did not look at any clinical records \nduring her review of CHDC, such as physical therapy evaluations, occupational therapy \nevaluations, speech evaluations, psychological testing, behavior reports, or behavioral \ninterventions. Tr. at 659 (Richardson).  She only looked at residents’ clinical records to the \n  346\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 347 of 383\nextent that they were incorporated into resident’s Individual Program Plans, so she could not \npossibly have assessed CHDC’s treating professionals’ exercise of professional judgment \naccurately. Tr. at 659 (Richardson).  She also did not interview any CHDC guardians as part of \nher review. Tr. at 694-95 (Richardson).   \nMs. Richardson’s brief tour of CHDC, limited review of records, and incidental meeting \nof some CHDC residents, did not afford her enough information to conclude that any CHDC \nresident could be classified as high, medium, or low priority for community placement. Tr. at \n5983 (Walsh).  For the limited observations that she made, Ms. Richardson did not use standard \nnaturalistic observation practices and she admitted as much. Tr. at 5994 (Walsh).  With utter \ndisregard for CHDC residents, Ms Richardson chose to inject herself into situations she claimed \nto be observing. Tr. at 5994 (Walsh).  Interacting with someone is necessarily different than \nobserving someone. Tr. at 5995 (Walsh).  If a CHDC resident is interacting with a stranger, such \nas Ms. Richardson, even if Ms. Richardson is somehow able to simultaneously withdraw and \nobserve and interact, as an observer she is not getting an accurate sample of that individual’s \ntypical behavior. Tr. at 5995 (Walsh).  To do a proper evaluation of transition services at CHDC, \none would need to look at the resident as a whole, in the same way that the interdisciplinary team \ndoes, including treatment history, functional skills, and the nature of the place to which he or she \nwould be transitioning. Tr. at 5983, 6764-65 (Walsh, A. Green).  Without an in-depth review of \nclient files and lengthy naturalistic observations, Ms. Richardson should not have even been \nmaking recommendations about program plans, transition services, or community placements. \nTr. at 5994 (Walsh). \nMs. Richardson occasionally does part-time work in Tennessee pursuant to a consent \ndecree. Tr. at 738 (Richardson).  According to Ms. Richardson, when she does her review of \n  347\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 348 of 383\nservices in Tennessee, she interviews a resident for hours. Tr. at 738 (Richardson).  She then \ninterviews the resident’s treating professionals, including physicians, and the resident’s \nguardians and only then does she make a recommendation about whether she believes the \nresident should continue to reside at the facility or consider transferring to a community \nresidential setting. Tr. at 738-39 (Richardson).  Ms. Richardson has never done an analysis of her \nwork in Tennessee to determine if it is statistically valid, statistically reliable, or statistically \nsignificant, but she did not even attempt to apply that process in reviewing services at CHDC. Tr. \nat 677, 738-39 (Richardson). \nMs. Richardson made no attempt to compare CHDC to similar facilities. Tr. at 668 \n(Richardson).  She did not know the rate of admission at CHDC and did not know the rate of \nadmission to any other large, publicly operated ICF/MR facility. Tr. at 669 (Richardson).  She \ndid not rely on the CMS data compilation, OSCAR (“online survey certification and reporting”), \nalthough she suspected OSCAR contained relevant data for purposes of comparing CHDC to \nother facilities. Tr. at 668 (Richardson). \n  On direct examination, Ms. Richardson claimed that her opinions were informed by a \nstudy by the University of Minnesota, but then on cross-examination she repeatedly insisted that \nshe offered no such testimony. Cf. Tr. at 596-597, 668 (Richardson).  Ms. Richardson did not \nknow that the University of Minnesota study, which she selectively cited in her direct \nexamination, actually uses data from OSCAR to compare data and outcomes across states. Tr. at \n668 (Richardson).  The University of Minnesota study cited by Ms. Richardson in her direct \nexamination describes the rates of admission to large publicly operated ICF/MR’s nationwide \nhave increased in recent years. Tr. at 668-669 (Richardson).  When Defendants’ counsel pointed \nMs. Richardson to that statistic, she testified that she had no opinion about why the rates of \n  348\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 349 of 383\nadmission to large publicly operated ICF/MR’s have increased in recent years. Tr. at 669.  \nExposing her personal ideological agenda, she refused to consider the possibility that the rates of \nadmission to large publicly operated ICF/MR’s nationwide have increased in recent years \nbecause the resources in community programs are inadequate to meet the need of some people \nwith developmental disabilities. Tr. at 669 (Richardson). \n \n29. MS. RICHARDSON’S INACCURATE  AND UNINFORMED \nRANKING OF CHDC RESIDENTS \n \nAt the back of Ms. Richardson’s report, she included a chart, but she never explained \nhow she selected information to include in her chart or why she excluded other information. Tr. \nat 5984 (Walsh).  Similarly, Ms. Richardson rated CHDC residents in her sample along a high, \nmedium, low continuum, but she never explained what that continuum was or what criteria she \nused to place residents at various places on that continuum. Tr. at 5990 (Walsh).  Similarly, she \nnever explained how she reached any of her conclusions about specific CHDC residents. Tr. at \n5985 (Walsh).  In some cases, Ms. Richardson rated CHDC residents “high” in her category \nsystem despite them having extremely complicated physical and mental impairments, being \nprofoundly disabled, and requiring 24 hour care.  Tr. at 5985 (Walsh).  Making a judgment that \nany particular person is a high candidate for community placement cannot be done, particularly \nwithout knowing whether there are community settings that can meet the actual needs of the \nindividual. Tr. at 5983 (Walsh).  Ms. Richardson never offered any explanation for how she \nreached her decision or what criteria she even considered. Tr. at 5985 (Walsh).  Ms. \nRichardson’s entire analysis of CHDC was subjective. Tr. at 706, 5985 (Richardson, Walsh).  \nShe did not even meet with four of the CHDC residents she rated as high for consideration of \ncommunity placement. Tr. at 716 (Richardson). \n  349\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 350 of 383\nMs. Richardson’s ratings of CHDC residents are completely meaningless. Tr. at 5992 \n(Walsh).  At trial, she was unable to explain why she ranked CHDC residents high, medium, or \nlow, without referring to the particular resident’s records because she used no objective criteria \nin her review of CHDC. See e.g. Tr. at 704, 705, 706 (Richardson).  Her assignment of high, \nmedium, and low designations appeared to be random. Tr. at 5991 (Walsh).  Ms. Richardson \nnever explained how she concluded that half of the people in her review should have “upgraded” \nplans and what purpose it would serve. Tr. at 5984 (Walsh).  Ms. Richardson rankings made no \ndistinction in her ratings among CHDC residents who were ambulatory, non-mobile, medically \nfragile, or self-injurious. Tr. at 5991 (Walsh). \nFor several CHDC residents, Ms. Richardson misrepresented the nature of their support \nand service needs. Tr. at 6766 (A. Green).  For example, M.F. she indicated a diagnosis of spina \nbifida, hydrocephaly, renal failure, and g-tube. Tr. at 6765 (A. Green).  M.F. does have a g-tube, \nbut he does not have a diagnosis of renal failure and he does not have a diagnosis of spina bifida. \nTr. at 6765 (A. Green).  In her key issues for some people, Ms. Richardson indicated that some \nresidents were medically fragile, needed 24-hour nursing care, and they had reflux precautions. \nTr. at 6765 (A. Green).  Those are also things that M.F. has, but they were not identified by Ms. \nRichardson in her description of M.F. Tr. at 6765 (A. Green). \nFor M.L.A, Ms. Richardson simply indicated that he needed health supports. Tr. at 6765 \n(A. Green).  She did not identify, as she did for some individuals, M.L.A.’s renal failure, \naggression, hydrocephaly, and medically fragility. Tr. at 6765 (A. Green).  Similarly, Ms. \nRichardson was pointedly asked why she rated C.G. as “high” for potential placement in a \ncommunity setting. Tr. at 704 (Richardson).  After rereading C.G.’s IPP, Ms. Richardson’s \nunresponsive answer was: \n  350\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 351 of 383\nI rated her as high because I thought what I was seeing was an \nindication that she was making progress, that she was stabilizing, \nthat she had some capabilities that would allow for a transition in \nspite of the fact that it was really clear that the team had said that \nher last transition had been difficult. So my thinking was that were \nshe to make another transition, it would be a good idea if you just \nmake one more, not try to transition her through team placements \nor something, but to really think about what a good community \nplacement might be for her, and then decide whether that would be \npossible to do and appropriate to do. And if it were, then proceed \nin that direction, not in a hurried fashion, but in a measured \nfashion. \n \n    Tr. at 704-05 (Richardson). \n \nMs. Richardson also rated R.S.C. as “high” for consideration for community placement. \nTr. at 5995 (Walsh).  R.S.C. is a blind 29-year-old woman with profound cognitive disabilities.  \nShe has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy and anxiety disorder.  Her overall age equivalent is \n17 months.  She needs total personal care and intense supervision.  She is not ambulatory and \nuses a wheelchair for movement.  She can only express her needs and wants through gestures \nand facial expressions.  She takes psychotropic medications.  She has a behavior plan for \nagitation, flails her arms and legs, and has high pitched vocalizations.  She disrobes, tears her \ndisposable briefs, and sometimes bites herself. Tr. at 5996 (Walsh).  If R.S.C. was discharged to \nthe community she would likely be discharged to a nursing home because of her exceptional \nclinical needs. Tr. at 5996 (Walsh).  At age 29, it would not be appropriate for R.S.C. to be \nserved in a nursing home.  Ms. Richardson’s cavalier rating of “high” for R.S.C. was wrong. Tr. \nat 5996 (Walsh).  RSC’s Interdisciplinary Team made professional judgments, concluding that \nR.S.C. should be served at CHDC and documented that decision in R.S.C.’s IPP. Tr. at 5997 \n(Walsh). \nSimilarly, Ms. Richardson’s representation that J.S.R. would get the attention he craves \nin the community, which would, in turn, cure his behavior problem, was a transparent attempt to \n  351\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 352 of 383\nperpetuate a fallacy and further her agenda. Tr. at 5993 (Walsh).  Advocates like Ms. Richardson \nattempt to perpetuate the myth that facilities like CHDC cause behavior problems and if you take \nsomeone out of a facility, there behavior problems will go away. Tr. at 5993 (Walsh).  There is \nabsolutely no basis for that unfounded speculation and Ms. Richardson offered no evidence to \nsupport it. Tr. at 5993 (Walsh).  People who have behavior problems are prone to have them \nregardless of where they live and the setting, in and of itself, is not necessarily a behavioral \nchange agent. Tr. at 5993 (Walsh).  Contrary to Ms. Richardson’s theory that CHDC caused \nJ.S.R.’s behavior problems, J.S.R.’s records show that his behavior has consistently improved \nsince he has been at CHDC. Tr. at 5993-94 (Walsh).  In fact, by June 2009, J.S.R. had ten \nstraight months without aggressive episodes. Tr. at 5993-94 (Walsh).  By Ms. Richardson’s \nlogic, he should stay where he is. Tr. at 5994 (Walsh). \n \n30. DEFENDANTS’ EXPERTS’ ANALYSIS OF MS. RICHARDSON’S \nEVALUATION \n \nDefendants’ experts, Drs. Kevin Walsh and Theodore Kastner, did an objective, \nsecondary analysis of Ms. Richardson’s chart, where she listed all of the CHDC residents she \nreviewed. Tr. at  4340-41 (Kastner), 5989 (Walsh).  Defendants’ experts determined that, at best, \nonly half of the information in Ms. Richardson’s chart could provide information about the \nfunctional status of the CHDC residents. Tr. at 5989 (Walsh).  They testified that the criteria Ms. \nRichardson used in her evaluation simply could not be determined. Tr. at 4340-41 (Kastner), \n5990-92 (Walsh).  Her assignment of high, medium, and low designations appeared to be \nrandom. Tr. at 4340-4341, 5991 (Kastner, Walsh).  As part of their objective, secondary analysis \nof Ms. Richardson’s chart, Drs. Walsh and Kastner did determine that Ms. Richardson did not \nuse ambulation, mobility, health status, cognitive level, adaptive level, aggressive behavior, and \n  352\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 353 of 383\ntype of behavior plans as criterion for rating CHDC’s residents on her continuum. Tr. at 4340-41 \n(Kastner), 5991 (Walsh).  Dr. Walsh testified that professional literature identifies variables such \nas ambulation, mobility, health status, cognitive level, adaptive level, and behavior issues that \npredict community success. Tr. at 5991 (Walsh).  Yet, Ms Richardson chose to ignore those \ncriteria. Tr. at 4340-41 (Kastner), 5991 (Walsh).  Defendants’ experts finally concluded that Ms. \nRichardson had no basis for any of her opinions about CHDC’s transition services. Tr. at  4340-\n41 (Kastner), 5994 (Walsh). \nAs to Ms. Richardson’s sampling, Dr. Kastner testified that  \n[s]he went to lists of individuals and chose a disproportionately \ngreater number from the group that had the greatest needs and a \ndisproportionately high number from the group that had the lesser \nclinical needs and, as a result, was really unable to reach a \nconclusion about the overall needs of the population at the facility. \n \n    Tr. at 4344 (Kastner). \n  Dr. Kastner expressed particular concern with Ms. Richardson’s claim that she could \ndecide that a CHDC resident could be placed in a less restrictive setting without any assessment \nof the individual, and in some cases without even seeing the individual. Tr. at 4339 (Kastner).   \nCommenting on Ms. Richardson’s methodology, Cr. Kastner testified \nI think that’s akin to just operating a Ouija board.  Professional \njudgment requires a professional assessment.  It’s absurd to think \nthat anyone could walk into a room and make an assessment of \nwhat would be clinically indicated for an individual without \nundertaking a clinical assessment.  One of the values and real \nimportance of the ICF/MR model is the interdisciplinary approach \nto treatment planning.  And because the process is driven by \nmultiple professional providing their input, a comparable \nassessment would need to be done.  \n \n    Tr. at 4339 (Kastner). \n \n  353\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 354 of 383\n  Dr. Kastner added that Ms. Richardson’s opinion, which she attempt to extrapolate to half \nof the CHDC population was “an outrageous opinion, because it is not based in any assessment \nof the individual needs…of the person, and could result in significant harm if someone were to \nact upon those recommendations or create an expectation that half of the individuals who \ncurrently reside at CHDC could adequately be served in less restrictive settings.” Tr. at 4344-45 \n(Kastner).  As Dr. Kastner testified, the Department of Justice compelled residents of an ICF/MR \nfacility in Nebraska to be transferred to less restrictive settings, and those individuals died at an \nextremely high rate because the settings they were transferred to were clinically inappropriate. \nTr. at 4345 (Kastner). \n  During his testimony, Dr. Kastner also noted that he toured community providers with \nMs. Richardson and expressed concern that Ms. Richardson related on selective portions of those \ntours to the Court. Tr. at 4312 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner testified that Easter Seals, United Cerebral \nPalsy, Pathfinders, and the Faulkner County Workforce Center all indicated that less restrictive \nprogramming funded through the waiver and state Medicaid plan was often unable to meet the \nneeds of individuals who required a more intensive service model, such as an ICF model. Tr. at \n4312 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner also testified that those community providers expressed \nappreciation for their respective relationships with CHDC and ability to rely on CHDC to serve \nclients from their programs on short and long term bases. Tr. at 4312 (Kastner).  \n \n31. MS. RICHARDSON’S LIMITED CONCLUSION \n \nMs. Richardson’s trial testimony was significantly different than the opinions she \nexpressed in her report, but because Plaintiff’s counsel refused to offer any of its experts’ reports \nas evidence, Ms. Richardson’s testimony stands alone.  At trial, Ms. Richardson testified that it \n  354\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 355 of 383\nwas not her recommendation that any resident of CHDC be discharged or transferred from \nCHDC based on her review. Tr. at 553-54, 693, 708 (Richardson).  Ms. Richardson merely \ntestified that in her opinion as many as 50 percent of CHDC residents could have their plans \n“upgraded.” Tr. at 553-54, 716 (Richardson).  She actually testified that “perhaps 50 percent \ncould look at really having their transition plans upgraded….” (emphasis added) Tr. at 553-54 \n(Richardson).  CHDC does not have a separate document called a “transition plan” and no \nICF/MR is required to have such plans.  Tr. 4041 (Kastner).   CHDC has Individualized Program \nPlans with a section entitled “transition plan,” but Ms. Richardson’s implication that transition \nplans are a separate documents at CHDC is further evidence of her cavalier review of services at \nCHDC.  Tr. at 4041(Kastner).  Ms. Richardson offered no standard for making that assessment. \nTr. at 638-42, 668 (Richardson).  Ms. Richardson admitted that neither the ICF/MR regulations \nnor professional standards require a formal transition plan, as she proposed in her direct \ntestimony. Tr. at 687 (Richardson). \nQ. PLAINTIFF’S PRIVATE PROVIDERS ARE NOT TREATING \nPROFESSIONALS AND OFFERED SELF-SERVING TESTIMONY \n \nAll of the community providers that testified for Plaintiff operate privately owned,  \nmulti-million dollar corporations that would reap direct financial benefit if they received any \nreferrals from CHDC.  Furthermore, none of those witnesses was qualified to offer a clinical \nopinion about the care of CHDC residents.   \nFirst Step, Inc. has an annual budget of $32 million. Tr. at 862 (Bland).  Its revenue \ncomes from developmentally disabled Arkansans’ waiver funds for the services it provides. Tr. \nat 863 (Bland).  Ms. Bland estimated that First Step, Inc. charges its waiver clients an average of \n$40,000 to $45,000 per year or higher. Tr. at 887-888 (Bland).  Ms. Bland admitted that her \nestimate does not reflect total costs of care for individuals served by First Step, Inc. because, for \n  355\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 356 of 383\nexample, individuals reside in their families’ homes and receive medical care from other \nproviders. Tr. at 888 (Bland).  Ms. Bland testified that if First Step, Inc. is able to serve more \nseverely disabled people through the waiver, such as individuals currently residing at CHDC, it \nwill be able to charge those clients more for its services. Tr. at 888 (Bland).  Among the 1600 \nindividuals for whom First Step, Inc. provides services, only about 165 of those individuals use \nstate waiver funds. Tr. at 917 (Bland).  Ms. Bland misrepresented the number of individuals for \nwhom First Step, Inc. provides services through the state waiver. Tr. at 918 (Bland).  In her \ndirect testimony, Ms. Bland inflated the number of individuals First Step, Inc. serves through the \nstate waiver. Tr. at 918 (Bland).  She testified that First Step, Inc. serves 206 individuals through \nthe waiver, but First Step, Inc. actually serves only 168 individuals through the waiver. Tr. at 918 \n(Bland).  In her direct testimony she misrepresented that First Step, Inc., was among the five \nlargest providers of waiver services for developmentally disabled Arkansans. Tr. at 918 (Bland).  \nMs. Bland admitted that First Step, Inc. is not among the largest five providers of waiver services \nin Arkansas. Tr. at 918 (Bland). \nMs. Bland also owns and operates five other corporations, ironically named “On Our \nOwn, Inc.,” “On Our Own II, Inc.” “On Our Own III, Inc.,” “On Our Own IV, Inc.,” and “On \nOur Own V, Inc.” Tr. at 953 (Bland) (and AR Sec of State).  Ms. Bland’s “On Our Own” \ncompanies own all of the real estate where the clients, to whom First Step, Inc. provides \nresidential services, reside. Tr. at 953 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. is the managing agent of the real \nestate where those clients live and the program and service provider. Tr. at 954 (Bland).  The \nclients to whom First Step, Inc. provides residential services turn their money over to First Step, \nInc.,  First Step, Inc. then pays rent to one of Ms. Bland’s five “On Our Own” companies. Tr. at \n  356\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 357 of 383\n953 (Bland).  Ms. Bland’s testimony was questionable because her testimony is directly \nconnected to her potential, personal financial gain. Tr. at 862 (Bland). \nMs. Bland holds no experience, advanced credentials, licensure, or certification that \nwould allow her to second-guess licensed, treating professionals. Tr. at 926-27 (Bland).  Despite \noverseeing First Step, Inc.’s provision of educational services to children, Ms. Bland has never \nbeen certified as a special education teacher and has never taught special education. Tr. at 926 \n(Bland).  Ms. Bland’s only distantly relevant educational background is a bachelor’s degree in \nsociology from Southern Arkansas University which she received over 40 years ago. Tr. at 926 \n(Bland).  Ms. Bland testified that she “graduated from college with a degree in a helping field…” \nand then later denied that she testified in that way. Tr. at 926 (Bland).  Ms. Bland deliberately \nmisrepresented her anticipated testimony to Defendants’ counsel as recently as one (1) day \nbefore she testified. Tr. at 910 (Bland).  Ms. Bland misled Defendants’ counsel about her \nanticipated testimony by disingenuously claiming that she was reluctant to testify. Tr. at 910 \n(Bland).  Ms. Bland deliberately hid the fact that she reviewed CHDC IPPs from Defendants’ \ncounsel in an effort to needlessly disrupt Defendants’ case. Tr. at 910 (Bland).  Ms. Bland \ntestified that she believed that no one under the chronological age of majority should ever see the \ninside of an institution. Tr. at 960 (Bland). \nMs. Bland’s cousin resides at CHDC because her needs cannot be met by a private \nprovider or in an alternative residential setting. Tr. at 670 (Bland).  Ms. Bland has a cousin who \nresides at CHDC and she has made no effort to seek or discuss alternative residential placement \nwith her family. Tr. at 912, 968 (Bland).  Ms. Bland has not even visited CHDC in the past 15 \nyears, in either a professional or personal capacity. Tr. at 912 (Bland).  Whether financially \nmotivated or not, Ms. Bland was mometarily able to set aside her personal agenda and admit that \n  357\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 358 of 383\nguardians, such as her cousin’s guardian, should absolutely not be forced to consider community \nplacement. Tr. at 670 (Richardson). \nArkansas Support Network has an annual budget of over $10 million. Tr. at 1512 (Vire). \nThe majority of work done by Arkansas Support Network is providing direct care workers for \nindividuals with disabilities who reside in group homes or privately operated residences, \nincluding HUD housing. Tr. at 1507 (Vire).  Arkansas Support Network employs only 450 \npeople, 400 of whom are direct care staff. Tr. at 1507, 1512 (Vire).  Arkansas Support Network \noperates a small employment program with 50 disabled individuals enrolled, but only 39 of those \nindividuals are actually employed. Tr. at 1507 (Vire).  Arkansas Support Network does not \nprovide any financial support for disabled Arkansans who want to own their own homes, despite \nDr. Vire claiming that Arkansas Support Network had a program to provide home ownership for \nthe disabled. Tr. at 1509 (Vire).  The individual development accounts, to which Dr. Vire \nclaimed the Arkansas Support Network had some relationship, are actually a Department of \nHuman Services program, not an Arkansas Support Network program. Tr. at 1509 (Vire). \nDespite reviewing at least one CHDC IPP, and on direct examination, testifying that he \ncould serve someone with personality change due to cerebral palsy, Dr. Vire admitted that he did \nnot know what personality change due to cerebral palsy was. Tr. at 1533 (Vire).  Dr. Vire \nadmitted that he has a “personal bias…that we should not have institutions.” Tr. at 1542-43 \n(Vire).  Dr. Vire testified that he believes it is futile to support a system of care for the disabled \nthat provides for community based programs and institutional care, and Dr. Vire contends that \ninstitutional programs should be eliminated to resolve the dilemma that he perceives. Tr. at 1547 \n(Vire).  Dr. Vire testified that he believed the Plaintiff’s lawsuit against CHDC, DDS, DHS, and \nthe State of Arkansas was some kind of “a humanitarian argument.” Tr. at 1546 (Vire).  \n  358\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 359 of 383\nHowever, even Dr. Vire conceded that he would not question the decision of a guardian who \nopted to have his or her loved one receive services at CHDC. Tr. at 1543 (Vire). \nCindy Alberding is the executive director of a privately owned company called, \nIndependent Case Management, Inc. Tr. at 1327-28 (Alberding).  Ms. Alberding is also the \npresident of an organization called the Arkansas Waiver Association. Tr. at 1330 (Alberding).  \nMs. Alberding began her 20 tenure at Independent Case Management, Inc., as the vice president \nof that company. Tr. at 1328 (Alberding).  Independent Case Management, Inc., provides \nservices to approximately 450 clients. Tr. at 1331, 1332 (Alberding).  Independent Case \nManagement, Inc., is paid approximately $35,000 to $40,000 per client for providing its limited \nservices, which do not include residential, educational, day programs, and all Medicaid state plan \nservices to its clients. Tr. at 1333, 1384 (Alberding).  Ms. Alberding’s educational background is \nlimited to a bachelors degree in special education. Tr. at 1383 (Alberding).  Ms. Alberding \nworked as a special educator for only three years from 1982 to 1985. Tr. at 1383 (Alberding).  \nMs. Alberding holds no advanced credentials, licenses, or certifications. Tr. at 1383-84 \n(Alberding). \nJeff Lambert is the assistant executive director for programs at Bost, Inc, a privately \nowned corporation based in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Tr. at 1858, 1919 (Lambert).  He holds a \nbachelor’s degree in organizational management, but has no clinical or professional training. Tr. \nat 1892 (Lambert).  Bost, Inc. has an annual budget of approximately $26.5 million. Tr. at 1859-\n60 (Lambert). \n \n32. PLAINTIFF’S WITNESSES’ COMMUNICATION WITH \nDEFENDANTS \n \n  359\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 360 of 383\nAll of the private providers who testified for the Plaintiff also admitted that they had an \nactive relationship with DDS and CHDC to the benefit of the disabled individuals they serve.  As \ndiscussed more fully below, DDS maintains information about services provided by all \ncommunity providers, which it uses to refer individuals, guardians, and family members who \ncould benefit from those services. Tr. at 1448 (Cromer), Pl. Ex. 265, 1395 (Alberding).  \nAdditionally, Independent Case Management, Inc. has had clients leave its services and opt for \nplacement at Arkansas’ human development centers. Tr. at 1336 (Alberding).  Independent Case \nManagement, Inc., recently had at least one client’s guardian remove his child from Independent \nCase Management, Inc.’s services and opt for his child to receive services at CHDC. Tr. at 1393-\n94 (Alberding).  Ms. Alberding added that it was possible that her staff have been contacted by \nCHDC personnel inquiring about services for CHDC residents that she would not necessarily \nknow about. Tr. at 1395 (Alberding).  Bost, Inc., has had two former CHDC residents, J.D.G. \nand J.M., transitioned to its programs recently. Tr. at 1898 (Lambert).  Several years ago a \nCHDC resident, R.W., was transitioned from a Willow home at CHDC to Bost, Inc.  (She later \nmoved to another state.) Tr. at 1899 (Lambert).  CHDC and Bost, Inc., have been in contact \nabout specific services offered by Bost, Inc., and potentially available for specific CHDC \nresidents. Tr. at 1898-99 (Lambert).  CHDC personnel have solicited, and received, specific \ninformation about services offered by Bost, Inc. Tr. at 1899 (Lambert).  Contrary to Plaintiff’s \nallegation, CHDC has transitioned at least one (1) child from CHDC to the privately operated \ncommunity provider, Bost, Inc. Tr. at 1865 (Lambert).   \nArkansas Support Network has also provided services to individuals who previously \nresided at CHDC. Tr. at 1523 (Vire).  Dr. Vire admitted that the staff of Arkansas Support \nNetwork may have had conversations with CHDC personnel about specific CHDC residents that \n  360\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 361 of 383\nDr. Vire did not know about. Tr. at 1548-49 (Vire).  CHDC personnel also have solicited \ninformation from First Step, Inc. about services potentially available for specific CHDC residents \nand had conversations with First Step, Inc. personnel about the scope of those services. Tr. at 866 \n(Bland).  As recently as August 2010, CHDC inquired about services offered by First Step, Inc., \nfor a specific CHDC resident. Tr. at 921 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. had to inform CHDC that it did \nnot provide the services needed for that CHDC resident. Tr. at 921 (Bland).  Ms. Bland misled \nthe Court in her direct testimony when she suggested that First Step, Inc. had never referred any \nof its clients to CHDC. Tr. at 920 (Bland).  Ms. Bland admitted that First Step, Inc. has referred \nat least one client to CHDC’s outreach program. Tr. at 920 (Bland).  Ms. Bland also admitted \nthat First Step, Inc. sought CHDC’s assistance in developing a behavior management program \nfor a First Step, Inc. client and that CHDC aided First Step, Inc. in developing that program \nincluding providing First Step, Inc. with information, tools, and methods for helping that client. \nTr. at 920 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. has referred at least one (1) child back to his school district \nand that school district in turn referred that child to a human development center. Tr. at 936 \n(Bland).  Ms. Bland admitted that she had received clients who were referred, and transferred \nfrom, the Human Development Centers, and she specifically recalled such transitions from the \nBooneville Human Development Center. Tr. at 921 (Bland).  Ms. Bland added that she may have \nhad clients transfer from CHDC to First Step, Inc., despite her claim that she could not recall any \nsuch transfers during her direct testimony. Tr. at 920-21 (Bland). \n \n33. INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THE \nCOMMUNITY \n \nThe Division of Developmental Disabilities Services maintains detailed information \nabout services provided by all community providers which it uses to refer individuals, guardians, \n  361\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 362 of 383\nand family members who could benefit from those services. 1448 (Cromer), Pl. Ex. 265, 1395 \n(Alberding).  Guardians, family members, and individuals get information about First Step, Inc., \nfrom its website, treating physicians, telephone contact, self-referral, and other mechanisms. Tr. \nat 864 (Bland).  Most recipients of First Step, Inc.’s services receive those services because they \nhave been referred by their primary care physicians. Tr. at 864-65 (Bland).  Ms. Bland also offers \npotential recipients of First Step, Inc.’s services information about other privately operated \nservice providers, but has not and does not tell those people about the possibility of receiving \nservices at a human development center. Tr. at 898-99 (Bland).  Bost, Inc. receives client \nreferrals from DDS and other state agencies. Tr. at 1863 (Bland).  Arkansas Support Network \nalso gets referrals to its program from the State. Tr. at 1522 (Vire).  In his direct testimony, Dr. \nVire misrepresented his organization’s ability to inform guardians and potential clients about the \nservices offered by Arkansas Support Network and that there is no prohibition on him or \nArkansas Support Network engaging in that activity. Tr. at 1558 (Vire).  Guardians or \nindividuals who want services, such as those provided by Arkansas Support Network, are given \ninformation about Arkansas Support Network and similar organizations, and guardians or \nindividuals are able to contact Arkansas Support Network or similar organizations directly. Tr. at \n1522-23 (Vire).  Independent Case Management, Inc. sends information out to people that \ncontact it for information. Tr. at 1395 (Alberding).  Independent Case Management, Inc. also \ndoes some outreach about some services it provides. Tr. at 1395 (Alberding).  Its employees have \nalso spoken at different community groups about services it provides. Tr. at 1395 (Alberding).  \nIts representatives have also spoken at transition meetings at schools when the school districts \ninvite it. Tr. at 1395 (Alberding). \n \n  362\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 363 of 383\n34. DEFENDANTS’ PROVIDER FAIRS \n \nAlthough the State of Arkansas has no obligation to host provider fairs, it does so as part \nof its commitment to provide a continuum of services for the developmentally disabled. Tr. at \n841 (Green).  The provider fairs organized by DDS are specifically designed to allow private \nproviders to reserve a table, set it up and provide information about their organizations, and \nanswer questions from consumers, families, guardians, and whoever else attends. Tr. at 1869-70 \n(Lambert).  Plaintiff’s community provider witnesses conceded that the provider fairs are used to \nhelp them market their services. Tr. at 1339, 938 (Alberding, Bland).  In the past year, there have \nbeen at least four (4) provider fairs hosted at human development centers in Arkansas.  Tr. at \n1338-39 (Alberding).  Several providers, CHDC personnel, families of residents, and residents of \nCHDC attended the community provider fair at CHDC in April 2010. Tr. at 983 (Bland). \nTwo (2) staff members of First Step, Inc. attended the community provider fair at CHDC \nin April 2010, although Ms. Bland did not even know the provider fair was held. Tr. at 983 \n(Bland).  Dr. Vire erroneously testified that he and Arkansas Support Network were not invited \nto the community provider fair hosted by CHDC. Tr. at 1524 (Vire).  Although Dr. Vire \nvehemently denied he was invited to the community provider fair hosted by CHDC, Ms. Green \ndid invite Dr. Vire and Arkansas Support Network to attend the community provider fair. Tr. at \n6781, 6791-92 (A. Green); Def. Ex. AG-1. \nCHDC invited First Step, Inc. to a provider fair at CHDC in 2010 and First Step, Inc. \nattended that provider fair. Tr. at 923 (Bland).  Independent Case Management, Inc., was also \ninvited to the provider fair at CHDC, but chose not to attend. Tr. at 1338 (Alberding).  In the \nmonths before trial, personnel from Bost, Inc. attended a meeting at CHDC regarding \ntransitioning residents from the Alexander Human Development Center. Tr. at 1868 (Lambert).  \n  363\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 364 of 383\nWhen asked directly by Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Lambert testified that he was not disappointed in \nthe turnout for the provider fairs because “a lot of times you don't have participation from the \nfamilies.” Tr. at 1870 (Lambert). \nPlaintiff’s community providers’ questionable commitment to actually serving \nindividuals in Arkansas’ human development centers is revealed by their involvement with \nresidents of the Alexander Human Development Center.  For example, despite Dr. Vire’s claims \nthat he has made efforts to serve individuals transitioning from Alexander Human Development \nCenter, none of those individuals have selected Arkansas Support Network as a provider for any \nservices. Tr. at 1550 (Vire).  First Step, Inc. had two staff members attend two community \nprovider fairs at the Alexander Human Development Center in August 2010, but Ms. Bland did \nnot personally attend either of those events. Tr. at 983 (Bland).  No residents of the Alexander \nHuman Development Center have signed a provider selection form indicating that they want \nIndependent Case Management, Inc., as their provider. Tr. at 1383 (Alberding).  Other than \nattending a provider fair, neither Ms. Alberding, nor Independent Case Management, Inc., has \nmade any effort to participate in the process of transitioning residents from the Alexander \nHuman Development Center, despite being aware that that facility is closing. Tr. at 1383 \n(Alberding). \n \n35. PLAINTIFF’S PRIVATE PROVIDER WITNESSES \nCONDUCTED A LIMITED REVIEW OF CHDC RESIDENTS’ \nOLD INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM PLANS \n \nNone of Plaintiff’s provider witnesses selected the IPPs they reviewed and none of them \neven knew how those documents were selected for their review. Tr. at 1555, 1874, 1901-02, \n1377, 1380, 877, 912-13 (Vire, Lambert, Alberding, Bland).  The Plaintiff selectively chose a \nlimited number of old IPPs for CHDC residents and presented them to Ms. Bland and the other \n  364\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 365 of 383\ncommunity providers with specific instructions to “review the needs, the diagnosis, and anything \nof significance related to the needs and decision in the program plan, the goals and objectives.” \nTr. at 866, 868, 1377 (Bland, Alberding).  Other than the IPPs they reviewed, Plaintiff’s \nwitnesses did not review any records, attend any IPP meetings, meet with any CHDC resident, \nCHDC residents’ guardians, or CHDC staff, or otherwise attempt to better understand the CHDC \nresidents about whom they would testify. Tr. at 1880, 1902-03, 1379-80, 1532, 1554-55, 912-13, \n(Lambert, Alberding, Vire, Bland).  Plaintiff’s witness’ self-serving testimony is even more \ntroubling when one considers Defendants’ expert, Dr. Kastner’s research on the risk of mortality \nin community based settings as compared to institutions.  Dr. Kastner conducted research in the \nstate of California that demonstrated that there was an elevated risk of mortality associated with \nliving in the community as compared to living in an “institution.” Tr. at 3965-66 (Kastner). \nPlaintiff’s non-expert witness, Dr. Vire’s, testimony helped reveal why these witnesses \nwere willing to testify that they could serve individuals they never met and for whom they only \nhad a single IPP for each individual, in some cases over two years old.  Dr. Vire explained, that \n“[w]e don't discuss whether or not to accept the person; we discuss how to provide the supports \nonce they come.” Tr. at 1520 (Vire).  Dr. Vire testified, “our default answer is yes.  We never go \ninto any referral thinking will we or won't we. We only think about how will we.” Tr. at 1520, \n1527 (Vire).  Ms. Alberding expressly testified that she would have liked additional information \non all of the CHDC residents, whose IPPs she reviewed. Tr. at 1380 (Alberding). \nSome of Plaintiff’s witnesses demonstrated that their claim that they could serve CHDC \nresidents was purely hypothetical.  Dr. Vire testified that the Arkansas Support Network could \nonly provide services for the individuals whose IPPs he reviewed if it had no limit on resources. \nTr. at 1527 (Vire).  Mr. Lambert also admitted that his testimony that Bost, Inc. could serve \n  365\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 366 of 383\nCHDC residents assumed unlimited funding. Tr. at 1872 (Lambert).  Ms. Alberding only \nconcluded that the individuals, whose IPPs she reviewed, could be served in the community if \nthe waiver funding was unlimited. Tr. at 1368, 1379 (Alberding).  Similarly, Ms. Bland testified \nthat she thought on direct examination that Plaintiff’s counsel was asking her whether the \nservices identified in the IPPs were generally available in the community, not whether she or \nFirst Step, Inc., could actually serve any particular individual. Tr. at 912 (Bland).  Ms. Bland \nwould not be willing to say that First Step, Inc., would or would not be able to provide services \nfor an individual unless she had all of the information available about that individual. Tr. at 925 \n(Bland).  Not surprisingly, none of Plaintiff’s witnesses rated any of the CHDC residents, whose \nIPPs they reviewed, consistently with Ms. Richardson’s ratings or even each other. Tr. 974-77, \n1904-05, 1906-07, 1556, 1398, 1375, 1400 (Bland, Lambert, Vire, Alberding). \n \n36. PLAINTIFF’S WITNESSES’ SEGREGATED SERVICES \n \nTwo of Bost, Inc.’s ICF/MR facilities are segregated by sex. Tr. at 1897 (Lambert).  The \n15 bed ICF/MR facility operated by Bost, Inc. was formerly a 30-bed facility, which stands out \nas an institutional building in the community where it is located. Tr. at 1897 (Lambert).  Bost, \nInc., segregates the clients it serves based on the needs of those clients, with individuals who \nneed more nursing care residing at its ICF/MR facilities. Tr. at 1896. (Lambert)   \nIndividuals receiving services from First Step, Inc. are also not integrated into the \ncommunity. Tr. at 865-66 (Bland).  The apartment buildings operated by First Step, Inc. are \nsegregated settings. Tr. at 977 (Bland).  Ms. Bland testified that grouping individuals on the basis \nof their functionality is a reasonable practice. Tr. at 978 (Bland).  Individuals served by First \nStep, Inc. in its group homes, are grouped in residences based on their functional level, and have \ndiagnostic ranges from mild to moderate mental retardation. Tr. at 958 (Bland).  Ms. Bland’s \n  366\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 367 of 383\napartments and group homes are segregated based on severity of mental retardation, so that \npeople with mild and moderate retardation will not live in the same building as individuals who \nhave severe or profound mental retardation. Tr. at 954-55 (Bland).  Individuals served by First \nStep, Inc. in its group homes are grouped in residences based on their functional level, and have \ndiagnostic ranges from mild to moderate mental retardation. Tr. at 958 (Bland).  The school-aged \nchildren served by First Step, Inc. do not receive their education with non-disabled peers. Tr. at \n889 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. provides education services to school-aged children exclusively in a \nsegregated setting, with no integration with non-disabled peers. Tr. at 889 (Bland).  First Step, \nInc., provides educational services in a segregated setting. Tr. 934 (Bland).  One of First Step, \nInc.’s special education teachers is responsible for 15 to 16 children and could be responsible for \nup to 20 students. Tr. at 933-34 (Bland). \n \n37. PLAINTIFF’S WITNESSES’ LIMITED SCOPES OF SERVICES \nWOULD NOT ADEQUATELY SERVE ANY CHDC RESIDENT \n \nEven if Plaintiff’s witnesses concluded that they could serve CHDC residents, the Court \ncannot assume that CHDC residents could be, or would even want to be, served by those \nproviders.  As Defendants’ expert, Dr. Kastner, noted, the most integrated setting is not based \nonly on where an individual has the greatest opportunities to interact with non-disabled persons. \nTr. at 3986 (Kastner).  One must also consider whether the setting meets the needs of the \nindividual. Tr. at 3986 (Kastner).  Plaintiff’s witnesses do not provide all of the services needed \nfor CHDC residents.  Tr. 3942 (Kastner).  None of the community providers that testified for \nPlaintiff provides medical, psychiatric, psychological, physical, occupational, or speech therapy, \ndental, dietetic, or food services for the individuals they serve. Tr. at 1333, 1384, 1389, 1507, \n1551-52, 1899-1900 (Alberding, Vire, Lambert).  Aside from Bost, Inc. which has no openings \n  367\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 368 of 383\nin its ICF/MR residential facilities, none of the community providers that testified for the \nPlaintiff provide residential services through their waiver funding.  Tr. at 1867, 1896-79, 1895-\n96, 863, 865, 1332, 1550 (Lambert, Bland, Vire).  Plaintiff’s witnesses essentially testified that \nthey could provide direct care services if CHDC clients were willing to relocate to areas of the \nstate where those providers operated. \nHealthcare providers are generally not funded through the waiver. Tr. at 3942 (Kastner).  \nThe State’s Medicaid Plan pays for many services for individuals in the community, including \ndoctors’ visits, dental services, hospitalizations, the first two hours of personal care services, \nsome prescriptions, some medical equipment, among other things. Tr. at 1385 (Alberding).  \nAmong other things, the State Medicaid Plan has caps on services, including physician services, \nmental health services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, prescription \nmedications, durable medical equipment, and hospital days that an individual can receive in a \nyear. Tr. at 1349, 1350, 1351, 1901 (Alberding, Lambert).  Community providers also can not \nprovide 24-hour nursing even if an individual required that service. Tr. at 1349 (Alberding).  \nSimilarly, they cannot ensure services to individuals who are ventilator-dependent, even if an \nindividual required that service. Tr. at 1350 (Alberding).  Mechanical restraints are not available \nin community based programs. Tr. at 1535 (Vire).  Also, active treatment, which every CHDC \nresident requires, is not provided under the ACS waiver. Tr. at 4038 (Kastner). \nSome developmentally disabled individuals served by Bost, Inc. share housing with Bost \nInc. staff. Tr. at 1862 (Lambert).  Bost, Inc. provides some services in congregate settings. Tr. at \n1862 (Lambert).  For some individuals, the day program services provided by Bost, Inc. are \nprovided in the same building where those individuals reside. Tr. at 1863 (Lambert).  At the \nICF/MR facilities operated by Bost, Inc., personnel are permitted to withhold personal property \n  368\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 369 of 383\nfrom the individuals they serve as punishment if those individuals are being destructive. Tr. at \n1895 (Lambert).  If clients served by Bost, Inc. are at risk of physical harm, Bost, Inc. personnel \nare permitted to use “adverse stimuli” in accordance with their training. Tr. at 1895 (Lambert).  \nBost, Inc., is not permitted to use any type of mechanical or personal restraint on its clients. Tr. \nat 1894-95 (Lambert).  Bost, Inc. can only arrange for 24 on-call nursing services if a client \nneeded a nursing component and the funding was specially approved by the state’s Medicaid \nPlan. Tr. at 1872 (Lambert).  Bost, Inc. cannot provide 24-hour nursing care in the community. \nTr. at 1908, 1916 (Lambert).  Bost, Inc. can only arrange for services for someone who is \nventilator dependent if that individual was able to get special funding from the state’s Medicaid \nplan and that care did not conflict with the Nurse Practitioner’s Act. Tr. at 1872 (Lambert).  Bost, \nInc. has had at least one client who required transfer from Bost, Inc.’s services to a human \ndevelopment center because Bost, Inc. could not arrange the needed behavioral supports. Tr. at \n1912 (Lambert). \nArkansas Support Network provides no nursing services. Tr. at 1513 (Vire). \nDr. Vire testified that some community-providers in Arkansas may not be able to provide \nservices to individuals with challenging behaviors. Tr. at 1521 (Vire).  Dr. Vire admitted that an \nindividual could not thrive in a community based program unless he or she could perform \n“grooming, hygiene, et cetera.” Tr. at 1535 (Vire).  Arkansas Support Network has no way to \nsupport even 50 referrals if it got them at one time. Tr. at 1541 (Vire).  In sheltered workshops \noperated by providers in the community, participants may only make pennies a day. Tr. at 1510-\n11 (Vire). \nIndependent Case Management, Inc. has no residential facilities and provides no \nresidential services. Tr. at 1332 (Alberding).  It also provides no services in group homes. Tr. at \n  369\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 370 of 383\n1381 (Alberding).  Most of the individuals served by Independent Case Management, Inc. live \nwith their families. Tr. at 1333 (Alberding).  Some of the Independent Case Management, Inc. \ndirect care staff live in the same apartment with the individual to whom they are supposed to be \nproviding services. Tr. at 1333 (Alberding). \nDespite testifying that Independent Case Management, Inc. could serve individuals with \nhearing impairment, vision impairment, mental illness, and seizures, and who are non-\nambulatory, have severe, challenging behavior problems, autism, or need psychotropic \nmedication, Ms. Alberding could not say how many individuals that Independent Case \nManagement, Inc. actually serves with those needs. Tr. at 1387 (Alberding).  Independent Case \nManagement, Inc. can only provide services to individuals who need frequent resuscitation if \nthey have the financial resources to pay for it without waiver funds. Tr. at 1350 (Alberding). \nMs. Alberding testified that Independent Case Management, Inc. uses absolutely no \nrestraints with any of its clients, but later admitted that some of its clients are required to use \nhelmets in certain circumstances for the convenience of staff. Tr. at 1340-41 (Alberding).  \nIndependent Case Management, Inc. has not served any clients who require any restraint \nintervention other than redirecting. Tr. at 1389 (Alberding).  Independent Case Management, Inc. \ndoes use time-out and exclusion if those contingencies are part of an individual’s behavior plan. \nTr. at 1389 (Alberding).  Independent Case Management, Inc. staff are trained on time-out and \nexclusion procedures by whoever prepares the behavior plan, but that training is not competency-\nbased. Tr. at 1390 (Alberding).  The only competency based training that Independent Case \nManagement, Inc., staff receive is from DDS, when staff is initially hired. Tr. at 1392 \n(Alberding).  Independent Case Management, Inc. staff receive no competency based training \nrelated to the specific needs of the individuals they serve. Tr. at 1392 (Alberding).  Independent \n  370\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 371 of 383\nCase Management, Inc. staff receive no annual, or other, retraining that is competency-based, Tr. \nat 1392 (Alberding).   \nInjuries that occur involving Independent Case Management, Inc. are reported to Ms. \nAlberding exclusively. Tr. at 1388 (Alberding).  Independent Case Management, Inc. has no \nquality assurance program. Tr. at 1388 (Alberding).  Independent Case Management, Inc. does \nnot collect or track overall data on seizures, and the only record of seizures is in the individual \nclient’s files. Tr. at 1388 (Alberding).  Ms. Alberding testified that Independent Case \nManagement, Inc., can only provide services for an individual who has no more than one-\nhundred seizures in a year. Tr. at 1385 (Alberding).  If a client served by Independent Case \nManagement, Inc. had a life-threatening seizure and needed treatment beyond his or her typical \nmedication, Independent Case Management, Inc., staff must call 911. Tr. at 1390 (Alberding).  \nIndependent Case Management, Inc. has two nurses that may be available for call, but Ms. \nAlberding testified that a nurse will only be called “if there was some need for that.” Tr. at 1391 \n(Alberding).  The only mortality review for Independent Case Management, Inc. clients is done \nby the DDS Mortality Review Committee. Tr. at 1393 (Alberding). \nFirst Step, Inc. cannot provide all of the services that children at CHDC require. Tr. at \n977 (Bland).  For example, First Step, Inc., is not equipped to provide specialized service for \nmedically-fragile children or adults, and is only able to provide services for those individuals in \nthe same setting as individuals who are not medically-fragile. Tr. at 883-84 (Bland).  Ms. Bland \ntestified that First Step, Inc. is not equipped to restrain individuals under any circumstances. Tr. \nat 884 (Bland).  Ms. Bland testified that the individuals, whose IPPs she reviewed, could fail in a \ncommunity placement. Tr. at 976 (Bland).  Over the past five years, Ms. Bland estimated the \n  371\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 372 of 383\naverage age of death for clients served by First Step, Inc., to be in the tweenties or younger. Tr. \nat 971 (Bland). \nFirst Step, Inc. direct care staff receive no competency-based training on medication side \neffects. Tr. at 967 (Bland).  Ms. Bland defended First Step, Inc.’s lack of competency based \ntraining for medication side effects by claiming that her staff have passed a CNA exam sometime \nprior to their employment at First Step, Inc. but Ms. Bland admitted later that she knew the CNA \nexam did not test competency for medication side effects. Tr. at 968 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. \ntrains new employees with “one full week of orientation” and then new employees are placed on \nthe job and observed for 90 days and given feedback in the afternoon of their job performance. \nTr. at 965-66 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. employees have had limited aggressive management \ntraining. Tr. at 962 (Bland). \nResidents of the group homes operated by First Step, Inc. are not permitted to be in their \nresidences during the day unless they are sick. Tr. at 959 (Bland).  Two nurses are required to be \npresent if First Step, Inc. requires use of an EpiPen, but no individuals served by First Step, Inc. \ncurrently have an order for an EpiPen. Tr. at 963 (Bland).  If nurses are required to administer an \nEpiPen, they must be called because they are not present in the particular area where the seizure \nwould occur. Tr. at 963 (Bland). \nMs. Bland also operates several companies called “On Our Own, I,” “On Our Own II,” \n“On Our Own III,” etc., which owns the real estate where First Step, Inc. clients reside.  First \nStep, Inc. is the managing agent of the real estate where those clients live and the program and \nservice provider. Tr. at 954 (Bland).  The apartments operated by Ms. Bland house residents \nfrom ages 18 to 70. Tr. at 954 (Bland).  Not every apartment owned by the “On Our Own” \ncompanies is handicapped accessible. Tr. at 954 (Bland).  As few as two units in each of the 14 \n  372\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 373 of 383\nand 20 unit buildings owned by the “On Our Own” companies are actually handicap accessible. \nTr. at 954 (Bland).  Some of the buildings operated by Ms. Bland require consumers to use a \nbuzzer at night if they require any assistance because First Step, Inc. only provides staff for those \nbuildings during the day. Tr. at 955 (Bland).  If a resident needs to use the buzzer system, First \nStep, Inc. attempts to have someone respond to the buzzer within five minutes. Tr. at 955 \n(Bland).  At its so-called 24-hour staffed facilities, First Step, Inc. requires residents to use a pull \ncord if assistance is needed at night to alert the sole staff member who is stationed in an office in \nthe building. Tr. at 956 (Bland).  At First Step, Inc.’s facilities, residents are required to start \ntheir days at 6:00 am. Tr. at 956 (Bland). \nThe case mix at First Step, Inc. is not comparable to individuals served at CHDC. Tr. at \n919 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. cannot provide services to anyone who is ventilator dependant. Tr. \nat 893 (Bland).  It cannot provide services to anyone requiring regular resuscitation. Tr. at 893 \n(Bland).  It provides limited nursing services and it is not equipped to provide specialized service \nfor medically-fragile children or adults, and is only able to provide services for those individuals \nin the same setting as individuals who are not medically-fragile. Tr. at 883-84, 959 (Bland).  First \nStep, Inc., does not provide services to clients who require restraints. Tr. at 949-50 (Bland).  Ms. \nBland testified that First Step, Inc. is not equipped to restrain individuals under any \ncircumstances. Tr. at 884 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. personnel may use a “basket hold” or  \n“four-point hold” if a client is aggressive. Tr. at 948 (Bland).  Some professionals maintain that a \n“basket hold” is dangerous. Tr. at 949 (Bland). \nFirst Step, Inc. has a policy that its personnel must call for an ambulance if a seizure lasts \nmore than three (3) minutes. Tr. at 947 (Bland).  Ms. Bland did not know why First Step, Inc. has \nthat policy though. Tr. at 947 (Bland).  She testified that direct care staff at First Step, Inc. must \n  373\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 374 of 383\nmake a judgment about contacting emergency services when an individual has a seizure based on \nwhether the seizure “scares the staff” or “makes the staff freightened.” Tr. at 944 (Bland).  One \nFirst Step, Inc. client has up to 40 seizures each day. Tr. at 945 (Bland).  The First Step, Inc. \nclient that has up to 40 seizures a day is on medication that has not managed to control her \nseizures and, according to Ms. Bland, the child “is seizing pretty much all of the time.” Tr. at 945 \n(Bland). \nThe only way that First Step, Inc. maintains data for individual children is in a collective \nfile of all injuries kept by Ms. Bland and a general file for each individual. Tr. at 942 (Bland).  \nMs. Bland described the composition of First Step, Inc.’s interdisciplinary team as “two \nadministrators that have children that have developmental disabilities, the master's in social \nwork, the OT, PT, and speech, particularly occupational therapist, the teacher, and the \npsychological examiner, and a psychiatrist if called in for contract, and a psychologist if called in \nfor contract. Tr. at 930 (Bland).  First Step, Inc.’s interdisciplinary team was only formed in the \npast year. Tr. at 930 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. relies on only one masters’ level psych examiner to \ndo behavioral assessments for the individuals it serves. Tr. at 930 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. has no \nbehavioral management committee. Tr. at 930 (Bland). \nFirst Step, Inc.’s sole method for policing abuse and neglect relies on its employees to \nmonitor each other and its clients to directly report abuse and neglect. Tr. at 950 (Bland).  Ms. \nBland claimed that First Step, Inc. has never substantiated any incidents of staff on client \nphysical abuse. Tr. at 951 (Bland).  She then qualified her testimony by adding “not that has been \ntold to me.” Tr. at 951 (Bland).  Ms. Bland admitted that First Step, Inc. has had instances of \nsubstantiated abuse based on its employees derogatory and caustic language directed toward its \nclients. Tr. at 950 (Bland).  At First Step, Inc. no allegation of neglect would be made against a \n  374\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 375 of 383\nstaff member where one client injured another client, unless the staff member was not in \nattendance and the client was left unsupervised. Tr. at 946 (Bland).  Ms. Bland is the only person \nwho conducts the investigations of abuse and neglect for First Step, Inc. the company that she \ncontrols and operates. Tr. at 946 (Bland).  First Step, Inc. has had incidents of children in its \nclassrooms injuring other children. Tr. at 945 (Bland). \nDespite First Step, Inc., having a corporate policy and practice precluding “use [of] \nadverse stimuli for restraint,” Ms. Bland admitted that on at least one occasion that policy was \nflagrantly violated. Tr. at 884 (Bland).  In an attempt to restrain or punish an individual served by \nFirst Step, Inc. an employee of First Step, Inc. taped a school-aged child to a chair. Tr. at 884 \n(Bland).  Ms. Bland testified that she was sure that there are cases of abuse and neglect that do \nnot get reported at First Step, Inc. and it has been sued several times for incidents that were \nreported. Tr. at 951 (Bland).  Fist Step, Inc. has been sued for failing to protect the clients it is \npaid to protect. Tr. at 952 (Bland).  In one case, First Step, Inc. was sued for allowing client-to-\nclient sexual abuse. Tr. at 952 (Bland).  In another case, First Step, Inc. was sued for leaving a \nchild behind on a school bus all day. Tr. at 952 (Bland).  In yet another case, First Step, Inc. was \nsued because it broke a child’s nose on a school bus door. Tr. at 952 (Bland). \nThe community provider witnesses Plaintiff offered at trial had no clinical training or \nexperience and were not treating professionals.  Their testimony that they could serve \ndevelopmentally disabled individuals with complicated medical and behavior conditions was \nbased on a limited review of one document and, therefore, would violate professional standards \nif any of those witnesses was a licensed professional.  Even if their thinly disguised, self-serving \ntestimony is considered, it is not credible as to a determination of whether Defendants are \ncomplying with the Americans with Disabilities Act.    \n  375\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 376 of 383\n \nR.  DEFENDANTS’ EXPERTS’ ANALYSIS OF TRANSITION SERVICES AT \nCHDC \n \nDefendants’ experts, Drs. Walsh and Kastner, conducted an objective evaluation of \nadmission and discharges at CHDC.  At the time of their analysis of CHDC, Drs. Walsh and \nKastner noted that CHDC had a waiting list of about 65 people, who are waiting for admission \ninto CHDC. Tr. at 5980 (Walsh).  CHDC has no waiting list for residents transitioning to \ncommunity placements, but some residents may remain at CHDC while they are in the process of \nsetting up services in the community. Tr. at 5978-79 (Walsh).  Defendants’ experts noted that \nthere were five individuals in the process of transitioning from CHDC. Tr. at 5980 (Walsh).  The \nguardian of K.C. wanted placement in a particular community setting, which had no vacancies, \nso K.C. is waiting for an opening at that location. Tr. at 5980 (Walsh).  Another CHDC resident, \nK.H., was in the process of transitioning to Louisiana because her mother had moved to that state \nand requested K.H.’s transfer. Tr. at 5980 (Walsh).  K.L. was an adult respite admission, whose \nMedicaid waiver placement was in process. Tr. at 5980-81 (Walsh).  R.L. was a minor who had \nbeen referred to UCP for placement. Tr. at 5981 (Walsh).  B.M. was an adult whose guardian \nwas still completing the waiver application process at the time of Drs. Walsh and Kastner’s \nreview of CHDC. Tr. at 5981 (Walsh).  \nAmong other things, Drs. Walsh and Kastner objectively documented admissions and \ndischarges from CHDC over a multiple year period. Tr. at 5979 (Walsh).  Defendants’ experts \nanalyzed 16 respite admissions from February 2008 through November 2009, and 37 regular \nadmissions from January 2008 through February 2010. Tr. at 5981 (Walsh).  They also analyzed \ndischarges from CHDC between July 2006 and March 2010, which was the most recent 46 \nmonth period available to them. Tr. at 5981 (Walsh).  Defendants’ experts concluded that CHDC \n  376\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 377 of 383\ndischarges an average of two individuals per month. Tr. at 5981 (Walsh).  Defendants’ experts \nalso determined that CHDC residents who are discharged go to a variety of other settings, \nincluding waiver services. Tr. at 5981 (Walsh). \nDrs. Kastner and Walsh also noted that CHDC routinely conducts a consumer satisfaction \nsurvey.  The consumer satisfaction survey is a direct measure of the quality of services at CHDC. \nTr. at 4334, 6107 (Kastner, Walsh).  Among other things, the CHDC satisfaction survey reveals \nthat 97 percent of guardians are satisfied or very satisfied overall with CHDC. Tr. at 4334 \n(Kastner), 5956 (Walsh).  The CHDC satisfaction survey also reveals that 77 percent of \nguardians are very satisfied overall with CHDC. Tr. at 4334 (Kastner), 5956 (Walsh). \nDefendants’ experts concluded that professionals at CHDC exercised independent \nprofessional judgment about the appropriateness of CHDC for the individuals they serve and \nwhether those individuals could be served in a less restrictive environment. Tr. at 4007-08 \n(Kastner).  Defendants’ experts found that in every instance in their sample, CHDC was the least \nrestrictive and most integrated setting. Tr. at 4007-08, 4086-87 (Kastner).  Defendants’ experts \nnoted that the judgments of treating professionals at CHDC were independent of the decisions \nmade by guardians. Tr. at 4329 (Kastner).  Defendants’ experts also found that treating \nprofessionals made independent judgments that CHDC was the least restrictive environment for \nschool-aged children receiving residential and educational services at CHDC. Tr. at 4008 \n(Kastner). \nDefendants’ experts also found that families and guardians of CHDC residents made \ninformed, well-educated decisions with regard to whether CHDC was the most integrated setting \nappropriate for the needs of their loved ones to receive the services they need. Tr. at 4008 \n(Kastner).  98 percent of the time the guardians participated in the creation of the IPP and \n  377\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 378 of 383\nguardians expressed opinions based on their knowledge of the various options available to them \nin making a decision as to the least restrictive or most integrated setting. Tr. at 4087 (Kastner).  \nAs to the knowledge of parents and guardians about community settings, Defendants’ expert, Dr. \nKastner, observed, \nI think plaintiff’s experts underestimate the knowledge that family \nmembers have, specifically family members and guardians of \nindividuals at Conway have.  The discussions that are \nmemorialized in the IPP and the social services notes reflect a very \ndeep understanding of the capacity of both the Conway center and \nthe waiver-funded programs to support their loved ones.  \n \n    Tr. at 4050 (Kastner). \nDefendants’ experts concluded that CHDC is a dynamic facility in that it admits and \ndischarges residents regularly, in accordance with professional standards and guardian \npreferences. Tr. at 5979 (Walsh).  CHDC population is not static and CHDC does not seek to \nmaintain the status quo relative to keeping residents at CHDC. Tr. at 5982 (Walsh).  Dr. Kastner \nconcluded: \nPeople are being admitted, people are being stabilized, people are \nbeing discharged.  There’s no effort on the part of CHDC to \ncapture people as they come in and to not let them leave for the \npurposes of maintaining their census or maintaining their \npopulation or justifying their existence. \n \n    Tr. at 4335 (Kastner). \nWhen CHDC residents or their guardians want to transition from CHDC, they are able to \ndo so. Tr. at 5982 (Walsh).  When a CHDC resident’s guardian wishes to have his or her loved \none receive services in the community, that resident is referred to the waiver and given priority \nplacement if there is a waiver waiting list. Tr. at 5978 (Walsh).  CHDC residents who are \ntransitioned to community-based residential services do not have to worry about moving at a \nreasonable pace because there is no waiting list to be discharged from CHDC. Tr. at 1426-27, \n  378\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 379 of 383\n5979-80 (Cromer, Walsh).  Residents of CHDC are “first in line” to move if they wish to \ntransition to a less restrictive setting. Tr. at 4331 (Kastner). \nDefendants’ experts also analyzed opportunities for CHDC residents to interact with non-\ndisabled peers.  Drs. Walsh and Kastner analyzed data of on-campus activities from January \nthrough March 2009 and off-campus activities from January through June 2009. Tr. at 5957 \n(Walsh).  There were 305 off-campus activities that included 1061 residents during the six month \nperiod reviewed by Dr. Walsh. Tr. at 5958 (Walsh).  For the CHDC residents on the total care \nteam, there were 30 off campus activities and 80 residents participated in the six-month period \nreviewed by Dr. Walsh. Tr. at 5958 (Walsh).  Some of the off-campus activities that CHDC \nresidents participate in, usually in groups of three or four, include:  basketball games, baseball \ngames, Boy Scout outing, bus ride, church services, Disney on Ice, eating out at restaurants, \nLipizzaner Stallions, local library, the McGehee recreation center, Martin Luther King, Jr. \ncelebration, movies, PB plunge, pet therapy, picnic, shopping, special Olympics, sports complex, \nToad Suck park trips, local parks, Winter Jams 2009, and wrestling competitions. Tr. at 5959 \n(Walsh).  Approximately 2,000 people are estimated to be involved in over 600 off-campus \nactivities annually from CHDC. Tr. at 5959 (Walsh). \nIn the first three months of 2009, there were 592 on campus activities for residents at \nCHDC and there were 5,886 occasions of resident involvement in those activities. Tr. at 5959 \n(Walsh).  Over the course of a year at CHDC, there are approximately 20,000 occasions of \nresidents’ involvement in approximately 2,021 activities.  Tr. at 5959 (Walsh).  Some of the on-\ncampus activities that CHDC residents participate in include arts and crafts, bingo, chapel, \nconnect four, cookouts, decorating their homes, electric monopoly, fishing, giant jenga, gym \n  379\n\nCase 4:09-cv-00033-JLH   Document 219   Filed 02/10/11   Page 380 of 383\nactivities, holiday programs, movies, mini golf, pizza parties, and many more activities. Tr. at \n5960 (Walsh). \nDefendants’ experts also testified that it would cost significantly more to serve \nindividuals through the waiver, state Medicaid plan, and public housing as compared to serving \nindividuals at CHDC. Tr. at 4313-17 (Kastner).  Defendants’ experts’ conducted a study that \nshowed that the cost of care in institutional programs was lower than the cost of care in \ncommunity programs. Tr. at 3967 (Kastner).  Dr. Kastner testified that the cost of care is actually \nlower at CHDC than the care that current residents would require if they were served through the \nwaiver.

Case No. 4:09CV00033 JLH\nSTATE OF ARKANSAS; MIKE BEEBE, \nGovernor of the State of Arkansas, in his official \ncapacity only; JOHN M. SELIG, Director of the\nArkansas Department of Human Services, in his official\ncapacity only; JAMES C. GREEN, Ph.D., Director\nof the Arkansas Division of Developmental\nDisabilities Services, in his official capacity only;\nand CALVIN PRICE, Superintendent of the\nConway Human Development Center, in his\nofficial capacity only DEFENDANTS\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nMost lawsuits are brought by persons who believe that their rights have been violated.  Not\nthis one.  The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice brings this action on behalf of the\nUnited States of America against the State of Arkansas and four state officials in their official\ncapacities alleging that practices at Conway Human Development Center violate the rights of its\nresidents guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act.  All or nearly all of those residents have parents or\nguardians who have the powert o assert the legal rights of their children or wards.  Those parents and\nguardians, so far as the record shows, oppose th e claims of the United States.  Thus, the United\nStates is in the odd position ofa sserting that certain persons’ rights have been and are being violated\nwhile those persons—through their parents and guardians—disagree.\nFor its first claim for relief, the plaintiff alleges that patterns and practices at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center violate the constitutional rights of its residents by failing to provide reasonably\nsafe conditions; by failing to provide the level of habilitation and training necessary to protect the\n\nresidents’ liberty interests and to ensure their rights and freedom; and by substantially departing from\ngenerally accepted standards of care in the medical, psychological, and other services provided by\nthe Center.  Cf. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 322, 102 S. Ct. 2452, 2461, 73 L. Ed. 2d 28\n(1982) (finding that individuals i nvoluntarily committed to a state  institution must be assured\nadequate or reasonable training to ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint).  Over the course\nof a six-week bench trial, the plaintiff examined witness after witness and introduced exhibit after\nexhibit in an effort to prove that many policies and practices of Conway Human Development Center\nsubstantially depart from generally accepted professional standards.  See id. at 323, 102 S. Ct. at\n2462 (recognizing that decisions of professionals  are considered valid unl ess they constitute a\nsubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards). The plaintiff\nmakes allegations of abuse and neglect; takes issue with the Center’s use of restraints, psychological\nservices, and medical services; and argues that the procedures used to prevent choking, aspiration\npneumonia, fractures, decubitis ulcers, and other injuries are subpar.  Finally, the plaintiff alleges\nthat, because of the Center’s deficiencies, residents die prematurely.  These allegations certainly are\nserious.  They are not, however, supported by the weight of the evidence presented at trial.\nFor its second claim for relief, the plaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development Center\nviolates the integration mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Under the Act, a public\nentity must administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated, least restrictive\nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.  Olmstead v. Zimring, 527\nU.S. 581, 591-92, 119 S. Ct. 2176, 2183, 144 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1999).  In the context of this case, the\nterms “restrictive” and “integrated” refer to the level of interaction with nondisabled persons.  An\nintegrated setting is a “setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled\n2\n\npersons to the fullest extent possible,” while a restrictive setting is one in which disabled persons\nhave less interaction with nondisabled persons.  See 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. B (Mar. 15, 2011).  The\nplaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development Center is not the  most integrated setting\nappropriate for many of its resi dents; that the Center’s employ ees fail to provide pare nts and\nguardians with adequate information about other services tha tthe plaintiff considers more integrated;\nand that the Center’s staff does not exercise professional judgment in determining the most\nintegrated setting appropriate for residents.  The weight of the evidence, however, indicates\notherwise.  The plaintiff has not met its burden under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nFor its third claim for relief, the plaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development Center\nviolates the rights of children at the Center under the Individuals with Disability Education Act by\nfailing to provide them with free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment.\nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a) (2006).  The plaintiff offers evidence showing that children at the Center\ndo not spend enough time in school; that special education teachers at the Center are not trained on\nthe most advanced teaching methods and tools;  that the education plans of the students are\ninadequate; and that the ratio of teachers to students does not meet state requirements.  While the\nevidence supports the plainti ff’s allegation that Conway Human Development Center does not\nprovide free appropriate public education, the evidence also establishes that the Center has submitted\na corrective action plan to the Arkansas Department of Education, which is the state agency\nresponsible for supervising special education programs and monitoring their compliance.  At the\ntime of trial, the Department had yet to determine whether the corrective measures proposed in the\nplan would bring Conway Human Development Center into full compliance with the Individuals\nwith Disabilities Education Act.\n3\n\nThe Court conducted its bench trial from September 8, 2010, through October 15, 2010.  At\nthe conclusion of the trial, the parties requested that the filing period for post-trial briefs be delayed\nuntil completion of the official transcripts.  The transcripts have been prepared, and briefs have been\nfiled.  Having received all of the evidence, the Court makes the following specific findings and\nconclusions.\nI.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nA. INTRODUCTORY FINDINGS OF FACT\nConway Human Development Center is a residential facility providing a variety of services\nfor persons with developmental disabilities.  It is one of six human development centers operated\nby the Division of Developmental Disability Services of the Arkansas Department of Human\nServices.  Tr. 749-50, 764 (J. Green).  The six human development centers have a total capacity of\n1100 persons.  Tr. 4332 (T. Kastner).  One of the six, Alexander Human Development Center, was\nin the process of closing at the time of trial.  Tr. 751 (J. Green).  Alexander Human Development\nCenter had 109 residents.  Tr. 4332 (T. Kastner).\nConway Human Development Center is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices as an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded,1 Tr. 4044 (T. Kastner), which\nmeans that it is eligible for and receives federal funds through Medicaid.2  It is licensed by the\n1 See 42 C.F.R. § 440.150 and 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.400-483.480 for the definition of and\nregulations pertaining to an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded. \n2 It is another oddity of this case that the institution at issue is funded and regulated by\none department of the executive branch of the federal government while another department of\nthe executive branch contends that its conditions are so deplorable as to violate rights guaranteed\nto the institution’s residents by the United States Constitution.  More pointedly, the United States\nsimultaneously funds Conway Human Development Center, certifies it as eligible for those\nfederal funds, and contends that the conditions there are so deplorable as to be unconstitutional.\n4\n\nArkansas Office of Long-Term Care3 for 539 beds.  Tr. 533 (A. Richardson); Tr. 845 (A. Green);\nPl.’s Ex. 229.  Conway Human Development Center provides medical care, dental care, physical\ntherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, special education, habilitation, and recreational\nservices.  Tr. 535, 642 (A. Richardson).  It employs approximately 1200 persons on a 409-acre\ncampus that includes thirty-two cottages, school buildings, a chapel, a gymnasium, a pool, an\ninfirmary, and other building s.  Tr. 533 (A. Ri chardson); Pl.’s Ex. 229.  The Center serves\nindividuals with a wide range of disabilities through its various programs and has a number of\nprocedures and policies in place to ensure that it is meeting the needs of its residents effectively.\n1. The Residents of Conway Human Development Center\nResidents of Conway Human Development Center are impaired in a number of ways.  The\nlarge majority of those residents are classified asp rofoundly or severely mentally retarded.4  Tr. 5810\n(K. Walsh).  Most of them also have psy chiatric disorders as well as additional impairments or\ndisorders.  On July 31, 2009, 509 persons ranging in age from seven to seventy-two resided at the\nCenter.  Pl.’s Ex. 229.  Of those 509 residents, 399 were classified as profoundly mentally retarded;\n77 were classified as severely mentally retarded; 25 were classified as moderately mentally retarded;\n7 were classified as mildly mentally retarded; and 1 resident, pursuant to a respite, or short-term,\nadmission, was described as functioning  at a borderline level.  Pl.’s Ex . 229.  Fifty-two of the\n3 The Office of Long-Term Care is a state agency that, among other things, regulates\nintermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded.\n4 Mental retardation is significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning\naccompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning.  Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders 39-49 (4th ed. 2000 Text Revision).  “Mild mental retardation”\nrefers to an intellectual quotient level of 50-55 to approximately 70; “moderate mental\nretardation” refers to an intellectual quotient level of 35-40 to 50-55; “severe mental retardation”\nrefers to an intellectual quotient level of 20-25 to 35-40; and “profound mental retardation” refers\nto an intellectual quotient level below 20 or 25.  Id. at 42-44.\n5\n\nresidents had autism; 171 had aggressive, destructive, or self-injurious behaviors; 319 had dual\ndiagnoses (i.e., developmental disabilities and psychiatric diagnoses); 137 had fragile health; 307\nhad seizure disorders; 229 had cerebral palsy; 190 were non-ambulatory; 35 were hearing impaired;\n21 were deaf; 129 were vision impaired; 36 were blind; 277 of the residents required devices (e.g.,\nwheelchairs, braces, or orthotic devices) to maintain body alignment; and 484 required modified\ndiets.  Pl.’s Ex. 229.\nConway Human Development Center is the onyl human development center operatedb y the\nState of Arkansas that provides services to children.  Tr. 764-66 (J. Green).  In July of 2009, fifty-\ntwo of the residents at the Center were school-aged children, Pl.’s Ex. 229, and at the time of trial,\nforty-eight of the residents were under the age of twenty-one, Tr. 846 (A. Green).  Many of these\nchildren came to Conway Human Development Center as a result of maladaptive behaviors.5  Tr. 846\n(A. Green); Tr. 2272 (S. Thibadeau).  They previously lived at home, in foster care, in group homes,\nor in other such settings and may have attended public schools.  Unfortunately, their maladaptive\nbehaviors proved to be more than their caregivers and school officials could manage, so their parents\nor guardians sought to have them admitted to Conway Human Development Center.  Tr. 2272 (S.\nThibadeau); Tr. 3263-65 (M. Catron); Tr. 4055-57 (T. Kastner); Tr. 5145-49 (D. Nye); Tr. 5607-08\n(B. Gale); Tr. 6212 (L. Kraus); Tr. 6616-18 (K. Priest); Tr. 6724-25 (B. Brewer).  Some of the\nchildren are in the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services due to neglect, physical\nmaltreatment, or sexual maltreatment.  Tr. 6724 (B. Brewer).\n5 Here and in many places in this opinion, the Court uses the terminology commonly used\nby witnesses at trial.\n6\n\n2. Admission to and Discharge from Conway Human Development Center\nAdmission to Conway Human Development Center occurs only after certain requirements\nare met.  Generally, a parent or guardian applies for admission to the Center on behalf of the child\nor ward and retains the right to withdraw the child or ward.6  Before a person can be admitted to\nConway Human Development Center, a determination must be made that the Center is the least\nrestrictive, most integrated environment in which the services needed by that person can be provided\nappropriately.  Tr. 4310 (T. Kastner); Tr. 5145 (D. Nye); Defs.’ Ex. 912, Division of Developmental\nDisability Services Policy No. 1086 § II(d)1.\nIn the twenty-six month period between January of 2008 and February of 2010, thirty-seven\npersons were admitted to Conway Human Development Center.  Tr. 4335 (T. Kastner).  Also during\nthat time period, forty-four persons entered the Center for respite, or short-term, care rather than\nadmission.  Tr. 4336 (T. Kastner) .  Over a fort y-six month period—between July 1, 2006, and\nMarch 17, 2010—seventy-two persons were discharged from Conway Human Development Center,\nwhich represents an average of almost two discharges per month.  Tr. 5981 (K. Walsh).   From July\nof 2009 through mid-October of 2010, six residents of the Center were discharged, as were fifteen\npersons who had entered for respite care.  Tr.  6768 (A. Green).  At the time of trial, six ty-five\npersons were on a waiting list for admission to Conway Human Development Center.  Tr. 647\n6 The Division of Developmental Disability Services has procedures for court-ordered\nadmissions, but no evidence was presented that any resident of Conway Human Development\nCenter has been admitted pursuant to court order.  If the Division of Developmental Disability\nServices or the superintendent of Conway Human Development Center determines that voluntary\ndischarge presents a danger to the individual or others, either may initiate legal proceedings.  No\nevidence was presented that legal proceedings have been instituted to prevent a parent or\nguardian from removing a child or ward.  Cf. Porter v. Knickrehm, 457 F.3d 794, 798-99 (8th\nCir. 2006) (holding that a guardian’s decision to admit the ward, a moderately retarded adult, to a\nhuman development center in Arkansas was a “voluntary” admission).\n7\n\n(A. Richardson); Tr. 4310 (T. Kastner); Tr. 5980 (K. Walsh).\n3. Parents and Guardians of Residents of Conway Human Development\nCenter\nMany, if not most, of the parents and g uardians of the residents of Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center keep themselves informed regarding the Center.  They have formed the Conway\nHuman Development Center Parents’ Association, which is comprised of parents and guardians who\nare concerned about the Center, itsr esidents, its staff, and what is happening in human development\ncenters around the state.  Tr. 50 55 (L. Taylor).  The association meets quarterly .  Tr. 5056\n(L. Taylor).  Many of the same parents and guardians are also members of a statewide organization,\nFamilies and Friends of Care Facility Residents, which is an umbrella group for all of the parent and\nguardian groups of the human development centers in the State of Arkansas.  Some of the members\nof the statewide group have developmentally disabled family members who receive services in the\ncommunity rather than in facilities like Conway Human Development Center.  Tr. 5058 (L. Taylor).\nTogether, the two parent organizations filed an amicus brief in opposition to the plaintiff’s claims\nin this action.\nAccording to the individual program plans and other evidence introduced at trial, the parents\nand guardians of residents of Conway Human Development Center are overwhelmingly satisfied\nwith the services there and believe that the Center is the least restrictive, most integrated placement\nappropriate for their children and wards.  Tr. 482 (S. Murphy); Tr. 4328-29 (T. Kastner).  Ninety-\nseven percent of the parents and guardians of residents at Conway Human Development Center who\nresponded to a survey stated that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the services that their\nchildren and wards receive.  Tr. 4328 (T. Kastner); Tr. 5956-57 (K. Walsh).  Six persons who were\nparents or guardians of residents of Conway Human Development Center testified at trial.  Two of\n8\n\nthe six were nurses.  All six of them testified that they were pleased with the services offered by\nConway Human Development Center.  Tr. 1502 (A. Fortney); Tr. 3249 (E. Stoddard); Tr. 3273-74\n(M. Catron); Tr. 5069-70 (L. Taylor); Tr. 6832-34 (M. Black); Tr. 6850-52 (B. Landen).  None of\nthe six had any criticism of Conway Human Development Center. \n4. Teams at Conway Human Development Center\nThe residents of Conway Human Development Center are divided into five “teams,” which\nare groups of residents assigned to a designated area with a specific group of employees responsible\nfor their training and care.  Defs.’ Ex. 910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. II-A-1.\nThe teams are, in order from the highest functioning residents to the residents with the g reatest\ndevelopmental disabilities, as follows: the Habilitation and Training Team, the Sheltered Living\nTeam, the Individual Assistance Team, the Intensive Training Team, and the Total Care Team.\nThe  Habilitation  and  Training  Team  consists  of  the  residents  at  Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center who function at the highest intellectual level of those admitted to the facility.\nTheir level of intellectual function ranges from the higher profound level of intellectual disability\nto the moderate level of intellectual disability, with some school-aged children functioning at the\nmild level.  The majority of them are placed at Conway Human Development Center because of\nmaladaptive behaviors.  Tr. 1663 (C. Price); Tr. 6723-26 (B. Brewer).\nThe Sheltered Living Team consists of residents who function at the profound to mild or\nmoderate level of intellectual disability.  A large number of them have seizure disorders, issues\nrelated to swallowing, and maladaptive behaviors.  Tr. 1663 (C. Price).\nThe Individual Assistance Team consists of residents who function in the lower profound to\nupper profound level of inte llectual disability.  Many of them have maladaptive behaviors and\n9\n\nseizure disorders.  They have low self-help skills and require manipulation in almost everything that\nthey do.  Tr. 1663-64 (C. Price).\nThe Intensive Training Team consists of residents in the lower profound level of intellectual\ndisability.  They have many maladaptive behaviors and seizure disorders.  Their skill level is below\nthat of the residents on the Individual Assistance Team.  They require total assistance with self-help\nand daily living skills.  Tr. 1664 (C. Price).\nThe Total Care Team consists  of residents who are in the  profound level of intellectual\ndisability and have severe medical conditions.  They are the most medically fragile residents at\nConway Human Development Center.  They typically are non-ambulatory.  Many of them have\nmajor swallowing issues, and most of them are fed by a tube.  They require total assistance with\neverything that they do.  Tr. 1664 (C. Price).\nEach of the five teams has a manager who is known as the team leader.  The team leader is\nresponsible for reviewing, monitoring, and approving programs and supervising the staff that is\nresponsible for the residents on that team.  Tr. 6722-23 (B. Brewer); Pl.’s Ex. 279.\n5. Interdisciplinary Teams and Individual Program Plans\nEach resident at Conway Human Development Center is served by an interdisciplinary team\n(which should not be confused with the teams  into which residents a re placed).  A resident’s\ninterdisciplinary team consists of persons from various disciplines who provide services to that\nresident.  Each interdisciplinary team includes a program specialist7 who is a qualified men tal\n7 The current title for this position is “program specialist,” but the position was formerly\nknown as “social service worker” or “social worker.”  Conway Human Development Center\nemploys twelve program specialists.\n10\n\nretardation professional;8 the resident’s parent or guardian; a member of the direct care staff; the\npsychological examiner assigned to that resident; and other professionals who provide service for\nthat particular resident, such as a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a speech language\npathologist, or a primary care physician.  Tr. 636 (A. Richardson); Tr. 4860, 4901-03 (S. Murphy);\nTr. 5017 (G. Miller).\nEach resident’s interdisciplinary team prepares an individual program plan for that resident\ndescribing the resident’s needs as well as a program for addressing those needs.9  Defs.’ Ex. 910,\nConway Human Development Center Policy No. II-D-1.  An individual program plan includes\ninformation submitted by the various professionals and direct care staff who provide services to that\nresident.   The p lan  includes  information about  the  resident’s social  history,  psychological\nassessment, medical care, dental care, medications, auditory assessment, nutritional status, dysphagia\nassessment, speech assessment, physical therapy assessment, occupational therapy assessment,\nspecial education, residential assessment, recreational interests, and other assessments as specified\nby the interdisciplinary team.  Tr. 4901-07 (S. Murphy); Defs.’ Ex. SM-5; Defs.’ Ex. 910, Conway\nHuman Development Center Policy No. II-D-1 at 5.  Each individual prog ram plan includes a\ntransition plan and takes into consideration the resident’s rights, the strengths of the resident, the\nneeds of the resident, the problems and liabilities of the resident, and the resident’s personal, long-\n8 A qualified mental retardation professional is a person who has at least one year of\nexperience working directly with persons with mental retardation or other developmental\ndisabilities and is either a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a registered nurse, or a person who\nholds at least a bachelor’s degree in one of several fields identified in the applicable regulation,\n42 C.F.R. § 483.430.  Those fields include psychology, social work, pathology, special\neducation, and rehabilitation counseling.\n9 A large number of individual program plans were introduced into evidence.  See Pl.’s\nExs. 101-1 through 206.\n11\n\nrange goals.  Pl.’s Ex. 101-1 through 206.\nEach resident’s interdisciplinary team meets at least annua lly to review the resident’s\nindividual program plan.  In addition to the annual meeting, the interdisciplinary team may meet as\nneeded for what Conway Human Development Center calls “special staffing.”  Tr. 4860, 4866, 4869-\n70 (S. Murphy).  Special staffing occurs when a resident has significant maladaptive behaviors,\nmedical issues, or other indications that some  aspect of the individual prog ram plan should be\nreconsidered.\n6. Behavior Plans\nIn addition to their individual prog ram plans, residents at Conway Human Development\nCenter who have maladaptive behaviors usually have a safety plan, a positive behavior support plan,\nand a separate description of strategies to be used by staff in dealing with them.10  A safety plan is\na plan for restraints, restrictions, or both.  Tr. 5795 (K. Walsh); Defs.’ Ex. 910, Conway Human\nDevelopment Center Policy No. II-D-16.  A positive behavior support plan is a plan to identify ,\ndevelop, and support positive behavior.  Tr. 5795-96 (K. Walsh); Tr. 6562 (K. Priest).  Strategies\ndirect staff as to how to best work with  the residents.  Tr. 5795-96 (K. Walsh); Tr. 6561-62\n(K. Priest); Defs.’ Ex. 910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. II-D-16.  In September\nof 2009, 99 residents of Conway  Human Development Center had safety plans, 33 had positive\nbehavior support plans, and 295 had strategies.  Tr. 5803 (K. Walsh).\n7. Human Rights Committees\nConway Human Development Center has five human rights committees, one for each team,\n10 Conway Human Development Center policy considers behaviors as “maladaptive” “if\nthey present a danger to self or others, to property, or interfere with habilitation and inclusion in\nthe community.”  Defs.’ Ex. 910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. II-D-9.\n12\n\nwhich review and approve specific treatment and behavioral interventions.  Tr. 5010 (G. Miller).\nThe  human  rights  committees  are c omprised  of  a chai rperson;  a vi ce  chairperson;  center\nrepresentatives; consumer representatives; and non-affiliated, community representatives.  Tr. 5009\n(G. Miller); Tr. 5934 (K. Walsh); Defs.’ Ex. 910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. I-\nF-4.  Conway Human Development Center psychological examiners are assigned to each of the\nhuman rights committees in a nonvoting role to provide information and consultation to the voting\ncommittee members.  Tr. 5009 (G. Miller); Tr. 5934 (K. Walsh).\nThe human rights committees review issues of residents’ rights (such as the right to privacy),\nmedical diagnoses, medications, behavior plans, safety plans, and individual program plans.  They\nalso review and decide whether  to approve behavior plans t hat involve the use of restrictive or\nintrusive procedures.  Defs.’ Ex. 910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. I-F-4.  Prior\nto  submission to a human ri ghts  committee, be havior  plans are developed as follows: the\ninterdisciplinary team establishes an objective and a plan; the psychological examiner formulates the\nbehavior intervention plan; and the team leader, chief of psychology, and primary care physician\nreview the plan.  Then, written and informed consent is obtained from the parent or guardian.\nTr. 5849 (K. Walsh).  If the human rights committee does not approve a behavior plan, the\ninterdisciplinary team must co rrect any impediment to approva l that is identified.  Tr. 5850\n(K. Walsh).  If the human rights committee approves a behavior plan, it is sent to the superintendent\nfor his approval, and then staff and other C onway Human Development Center personnel are\ninstructed on how to implement the plan.  Tr. 5850 (K. Walsh).  The psychological examiners train\nthe staff as to how to implement the plan .  Tr. 6589-90, 6599-6600 (K. Priest); Tr. 6677- 78 (E.\nGlenn); Defs.’ Ex. 910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. II-D-16 at 4, 11, 14.\n13\n\n8. Incident Review Committees\nIn addition to the human rights committees, Conway Human Development Cent er has\nanother group of oversight committees called “incident review committees.”  Each of the five teams\nhas an incident review committee, and there is also a central incident review committee.  Tr. 5936\n(K. Walsh). The team incident review committees meet Monday through Friday,  Tr. 5014-15 (G.\nMiller); Tr. 5936 (K. Walsh), while the central incident review committee meets monthly, Tr. 5936\n(K. Walsh); Pl.’s Ex. GM-1.  The incident review committees review reports of injuries, deaths,\ndisruption of services to cl ients, patterns and trends, safety concerns, property damage, and\nworkman’s  compensation-related issues.    Pl.’s  Ex.  GM-1; Defs.’ Ex .  910, Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center Policy No. I-F-15.\nConway Human Development Center is required to report to a State of Arkansas database\nincidents of maltreatment of residents by staff, fractures, cuts and lacerations that require stitches,\nbruises that require x-rays, client-to-client bites if there is a skin break or if an antibiotic is required,\nswellings, sprains if there are x-rays, abrasions and burns that require the application of medication\nor ointment, medication errors that require medical treatment, and certain other types of incidents.\nTr. 5938-39, 5943 (K. Walsh); Defs.’ Ex. 910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. I-E-\n12; Defs.’ Ex. 911, Arkansas Department of Human Services Policy Manual §§ 1090 et seq.; Defs.’\nEx. 912, Division of Developmental Disability Services Policy No. 1027.  Minor bumps and bruises\nare not reportable.  Tr. 5938 (K. Walsh).  The incident review committees review the incidents that\nmust be reported to the state database.  Tr. 5936-37 (K. Walsh).\nThe central incident review committee at Conway Human Development Center performs a\nsecond review of incidents that were reviewed by the team incident review committees.  The central\n14\n\ncommittee also provides oversight review for identifying trends and policy directions.  It produces\na quarterly incident report summary, which is a statistical report showing all incidents that occurred\nin the prior quarter.  Tr. 5937-38 (K. Walsh). \n9. Physical Therapy\nConway Human Development Center employs a staff of physical therapists who are licensed\nby the State of Arkansas, are assisted by physical therapy aides and assistants, and perform a number\nof functions at the Center.  Tr. 5251-52 (L. Hancock).  The physical therapy department performs\nassessments of new resident s upon admission and reassesses th em  periodically during their\nresidency.  Tr. 5251 (L. Hancock).  The department also provides wheelchair modifications, power\nwheelchair training, and wound care.  In addition, the department hosts an orthopedic clinic each\nmonth.  Tr. 5251 (L. Hancock).  The department trains direct care staff in proper positioning and\nlifting and performs spot checks to determine whether direct care staff are complying with the\ntraining.  Tr. 5254-55 (L. Hancock).  The physical therapy department also prepares positioning\nprograms for each resident in need ofp ositioning services.  Tr. 5263-64 (L. Hancock).  Among other\nthings, the positioning services are designed to avoid decubitus ulcers, also known as pressure ulcers,\nand to help prevent choking during mealtime.  Tr. 5277-81 (L. Hancock).\nConway Human Development Center operates a physical therapy orthotics shop at which it\nconstructs custom-made wheelchairs and other orthotics devices for the residents.  Each device is\nform-fitted to the resident who will use it.  Tr.5 265-69 (L. Hancock).  Very few residential facilities\nhave on-site orthotics shops.  Tr. 3469 (M. Schmeler).  A resident at Conway Human Development\nCenter who needs a custom-made wheelchair can have one constructed and properly fitted to that\nresident’s specific needs withina pproximately two days.  Tr. 5269 (L. Hancock).  MarkR  . Schmeler,\n15\n\nPh.D., an expert in occupational therapy specializing in assistive technology, described the turn-\naround rate at Conway Human Development Center’s orthotics shop as “lightning speed.”  Tr. 3474-\n76 (M. Schmeler).  When such a cust om-made wheelchair or other device is ordered from a\ncommercial vendor, the process may take four to six months.  Tr. 5271 (L. Hancock).  \nB. FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE\nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT\nThe plaintiff’s first claim fo r relief is that many  of the conditions at Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center violate the constitutional rights of the Center’s residents.  Specifically, the\nplaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development Center’s efforts tok eep its residents safe and free\nfrom undue restraint substantially depart from generally accepted practices.  The greater weight of\nthe evidence is to the contrary.\n1. Allegations that a P attern and Practice of Abuse and Neglect and a\n“Culture Of Silence” Exist at Conway Human Development Center\nThe plaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development Center has a pattern and practice of\nabusing and neglecting its residents and that a  “culture of silence” exists permitting abuse and\nneglect.  That allegation is contrary to the greater weight of the evidence.\nCarla Jo Osgood, called as an ex pert witness for the plaintiff, provided unconvincing\ntestimony that  abuse and neglect of residents is rampant at Conway Human Development Center\nand that a “culture of silence” prevails such that employees over time become reticent to report abuse\nand neglect.  Osgood had no formal  education in any field relevant to her testimony ,11 nor is it\n11 Osgood has a bachelor’s degree in political science.  She has taken graduate courses at\nthe Cincinnati Bible Seminary and also has studied pastoral counseling.  Tr. 41 (C. Osgood).  Her\ncurriculum vitae provides no information about her education, thus tacitly admitting that she has\nno formal education in the field of her purported expertise.  Pl.’s Ex. 1-1.\n16\n\nevident that she has any experience that would qualify her to give expert testimony under Rule 702\nof the Federal Rules of Evidence.  See Tr. 37-41, 204-12 (C. Osgood); Pl.’s Ex. 1-1.\nIn her testimony, Osgood made mention of “g enerally accepted standards” but did not\nidentify any source where such standards could be  found other than the reg ulations that govern\nintermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, which she regarded as outdated.  Tr. 279-80\n(C. Osgood).  She testified that “the standards of practice are fluid over time and could have changed\nat any time in the last four months, twelve months, what have you.”  Tr. 222 (C. Osgood).  She did\nnot refer to texts, journals, or other sources that would reflect shared knowledge among people who\nwould qualify as experts in a particular field.   Her testimony did not seem to  connect to any\nidentifiable body of knowledge or any identifiable discipline from which g enerally accepted\nstandards might be ascertained.  She stated that she had toured approximately thirty facilities in\nfifteen states, but she neither identified the facilities nor gave any description of them from which\nthe Court could determine whether those facilities were comparable to Conway Human Development\nCenter.  She also provided no quantitative analysis comparing rates of abuse and neglect at Conway\nHuman Development Center to rates at similar f acilities or to any  benchmarks.  Tr. 269-72\n(C. Osgood).  Osgood leaped to the conclusion that a “culture of silence” exists at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center based on t he fact that, in a few instances, the staff member reporting\nmaltreatment had worked at the facility less than six months and based on the fact the Center\ndisciplines employees who fail to report maltreatment immediately, as the Center’s policy requires.\nTr. 156-61, 168, 181, 183 (C. Osgood).\nEven disregarding the issues relating to Osgood’s credibility, her testimony is contradicted\nby the greater weight of the evidence, which demonstrates that no pattern and practice of abuse and\n17\n\nneglect exists at Conway Human Development Center.  \nTo begin with, Conway Human Development Center has specific policies in place designed\nto protect its residents from maltreatment.

Tr. 5948-49\n(K. Walsh).  This fact supports the finding that there is no pattern and practice of abuse and neglect\nat the Center.\nMoreover,  the testimony   of  parents  and gu ardians  of re sidents  at Conway   Human\nDevelopment Center also supports the finding  that there is no pattern and practice of abuse and\nneglect at the Center.  When a resident is involved in an incident of aggression, maltreatment, or\ninjury, the Center notifies the parent or g uardian unless the parent or guardian has specifically\n19\n\ndirected otherwise.  Tr. 3236 (E. Stoddard); Tr. 3269, 3282 (M. Catron); Tr. 4868-69 (S. Murphy);\nTr. 5033-34 (G. Miller); Tr. 5059( L. Taylor).  Parents and guardians are permitted to visitt he Center\nunannounced.  Tr. 3232 (E. Stoddard); Tr. 3270 (M. Caotrn); Tr. 5059 (L. Taylor).  Even though they\nare permitted to visit unannounced, no parent or guardian of any resident, past or present, testified\nthat he or she had reason to believe that C onway Human Development Center has a pattern or\npractice of permitting residents to be abused or neglected.\nTo the contrary, parents and guardians testified that the staff at Conway Human Development\nCenter genuinely care about the residents and immediately report any issues that arise.  \nThe first witness called for the defense was Earline Stoddard, whose forty-four-year-old son\nis a resident of Conway Human Development Center.  Tr. 3230 (E. Stoddard).  At the time of trial,\nMs. Stoddard was an adjunct instructor for the Schoo olf Nursing at Baptist Health.  She has worked\nin the nursing field for more than forty years.  Tr. 3230 (E. Stoddard).  Ms. Stoddard often makes\nunannounced visits to the Center to visit her son, and she has never seen anything that would cause\nher to be alarmed or upset.  “I  can tell you when he was in a school in Kansas, we were never\nallowed to go back to the cottage to see him.  They always brought him to us.  That’s one thing I like\nabout Conway [Human Development Center], is you can go see your child any time you want to.”\nTr. 3233 (E. Stoddard).  Ms. Stoddard testified, “[I]t’s so important to me to know that the people\nwho are caring for [my son] love him and will take care of him and are held responsible  for it.”\nTr. 3247 (E. Stoddard). \nMelissa Catron’s son also is a resident of Conway Human Development Center.  He was\nnineteen years old at the time of trial and had been a resident for more than four years.  Tr. 3261-62\n(M. Catron).  Ms. Catron is a registered nurse.  She testified that the Center works with her son on\n20\n\neverything she could possibly want.  She believes that he is loved there.  “I don’t feel like anybody\nis there against their will to work with him.  I’ve just not seen that.  Everyone I’ve seen there that\nworks with him wants to be there, that’s what they want to do, and they seem to care about the kids.\nI’m thrilled.”  Tr. 3274 (M. Catron).\nThe defendants also called as a witness Larry Taylor, who is the guardian of his fifty-eight-\nyear-old younger sister.  “Tests showt hat [my sister] functions at about two years and nine months.”\nShe was fourteen years old when she was admitted.   Tr. 5050 (L. Taylor).  Mr. Taylor has lunch with\nhis sister on a weekly basis.  “I can rely on them to call me any time there’s an injury.  And that\nmeans a bruise of 2 inches, a scratch, a fall from bed.”  Mr. Taylor could not recall a time when he\nnoticed that his sister had suffered an injury  that he did not already  know about.  Tr. 5059\n(L. Taylor).\nMichael Black’s fourteen-year-old son was admitted to Conway Human Development Center\nwhen he was eight or nine.  Tr. 6824 (M. Black).  “They call if he gets a bruise or a bump or has an\nincident.  They call and let us know that he fell and scraped his knee . . . .  They call and tell us that\nhe’s fine, you know, we put a Band-Aid on it, we gave him a hug and a kiss, and he’s back to being\na normal little child.”  Tr. 6833 (M. Black).   “All the workers there . . . most of them that we know\nof have children of their own. . . .  We’re happy that he’s in an environment where we know he’s safe\nand he’s going to get good sound medical care while he is there.”  Tr. 6833-34 (M. Black).\nBarry Landen is the guardian of his brother, whoi s fifty-five years old and has been a resident\nof Conway Human Development Center for more than forty years.  Tr. 6842 (B. Landen).  Landen’s\nbrother was born blind.  \n[My brother] is an extraordinarily fragile individual.  His balance, as I said, it’s just\nterrible, and it’s very easy for him to fall and hurt himself. . . . h e doesn’t understand\n21\n\nthe concept of putting your fingers over the door when you slam will cause you a\nhuge amount of injury.  So the factt hat nothing serious has happened to [my brother]\nin 40 years of living there is extraordinarily significant to me.\nTr. 6851 (B. Landon).\nThe testimony that staff members at Conway Human Development Center genuinely love\nand care for the residents is inconsistent with the allegation that there is a pattern and practice of\nabuse and neglect of residents at the Center.\nJust as no parent or guardian testified to facts that would indicate a pattern or practice of\nabuse and neglect at Conway Human Development Center, similarly, no past or present employee\noffered any testimony indicating that such a pattern or practice of abuse or neglect exists.  If a pattern\nor practice of abuse or neglect exists at Conway Human Development Center, some past or present\nemployee would know of it and wouldh ave testified about it.  Tr. 4873-74 (S. Murphy).  If a “culture\nof silence” prevails such that present employees are disinclined to report abuse and neglect, some\nformer employee would know of it and would have testified about it.  No past or present employee\ntestified that Conway Human Development Center has or has had a pattern or practice of permitting\nresidents to be abused or neglected.  No past or present employee testified that a “culture of silence”\nexists at Conway Human Development Center or that employees of the Center are reluctant to report\nabuse or neglect.\nIn fact, Johnny Lee Matson, Ph.D., who was called by the plaintiff as an expert witness in\nthe field of psychology, testified that the psychology staff at Conway Human Development Center\nconsists of “very nice people” who “were try ing very hard” and “doing  the best they  could.”\nTr. 1072 (J. Matson).  Even though Dr. Matson believes that the technical skills of the psychology\nstaff at the Center are deficient, he did not hesitate to say that they are good people who are doing\n22\n\ntheir best, an observation that cannot be reconciled with the allegation that a pattern of abuse and\nneglect prevails.\nOther witnesses described the staff at Conway Human Development Center as consisting of\npeople who genuinely care for the residents and exhibit a loving attitude toward them.  For example,\nLouis Kraus, M.D., who testified as an expert in child psychiatry, described the cottage personnel\nat Conway Human Development Center as follows: \nThey were amazing. . . . I’ve seen a lot of different facilities over my professional\ncareer.  Most of the cottage staff had been there for years, and they were not just\nthere, in my opinion, because it was a job.  They truly loved taking care of these kids.\nThey would coddle them, they would hold them.  There was a warmth with the staff\nthat I observed during the day and early evening shifts, which I felt was very\nimpressive.  They also, I think it’s important, they had an understanding of the kids.\nLike, for example, one child that we talked about, TM, that had the orchiectomy, that\nstaff really knew this child.  They knew when people came up to him too quickly,\nthat he’ll get anxious.  They knew that when he’s cold, he shakes, and he likes it\nwhen it’s warmer out.  They  knew things about this child.  And in each of the\ncottages and dorms, that’s what you found.  That’s something refreshing, as opposed\nto people looking at their watches for the end of their shift.\nTr. 6225-26 (L. Kraus).  Derek Nye, Ph.D., an expert in special education, testified:\nI’m from New Jersey.  There seems to be in my experience an edginess that exists all\nalong the shoreline from Boston to Baltimore.  And I see that edginess sometimes in\nour field, and it disappoints me on the east coast where staff have perhaps lost their\nfocus as to why they are doing what they are doing.  And I have seen it, quite frankly,\nin facilities I’ve worked at . . . .  And I saw it in some of the developmental centers\nin New York and New Jersey specifically.  And I had a fear that I would . . . see it\nhere, too.  Why not?  And I was – pleasantly surprised is an understatement.  I was\noverwhelmed by the caring attitude, by the compassion . . . and not just the special\neducators.  People from the boardroom to the washroom, they place these individuals\nat the center of every thing.  They understood that they were there because these\nindividuals needed their assistance.  And they never violated that trust.     My\nexperience is they didn’t violate that trust.  And it was very impressive.  And I saw\nthat throughout in the classroom.\n*  *  *\n[T]here was a relationship, there was trust, there were students that were comfortable.\nWithout being able to cite specifics, I believe certainly in my mind it’s a given that\nstudents who feel they are safe, they are comfortable, that they are loved, are going\n23\n\nto have a greater capacity to learn and to love and to trust back.  And I saw that given.\nPeople may argue that’s an intangible and perhaps it is, but when you’ve taught and\nyou’ve been involved in as many places as I have in 36 years, you know it when you\nsee it, and I saw it every day.\nTr. 5120-21 (D. Nye). Even if some of those who testified believe that the technical skills of the staff\nat Conway Human Development Center are deficient—as Dr. Matson does—it is not plausible to\nsay that employees at the Center genuinely care for the residents and exercise their best efforts to\nattend to the residents’ needs while tolerating a pattern and practiceo f abuse and neglect about which\nthey remain silent.\nThe greater weight of the evidence proves that no pattern and practice of abuse, neglect, or\nmaltreatment of residents exists at Conway Human Development Center, and no “culture of silence”\nexists there.  The evidence proves that Conway Human Development Center exercises reasonable\ncare to prevent and to stop abuse, neglect, and maltreatment.\n2. Allegations  that Conw ay  Human  Development  Center’s  Use of\nRestraints Violates Residents’ Rights\nContrary to the plaintiff’s allegations, and for the reasons that follow, the Court also finds\nfrom the greater weight of the evidence that Conway Human Development Center’s use of restraints\ndoes not violate the constitutional rights of its residents.\nResidents of Conway Human Development Center engage in aggression toward others, self-\ninjurious behavior, tantrums, destruction of property, ingestion of non-edible objects, and the like,\nwhich can be dangerous to the resident engaging in the behavior as well as to other residents and\nstaff or property.  The Center sometimes uses  mechanical restraints including papoose boards,\nrestraint chairs, restraint jackets, mittens, and helmets to contain dangerous behavior.  Defs.’ Ex.\n910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. II-D-12 at 2-3.\n24\n\nIf the use of restraints is to be a part of the program for a resident at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center, the interdisciplinary team must prepare a safety plan and a positive behavior\nsupport plan.  Tr. 6652 (K. Priest).  Pursuant to the Center’s written statement of residents’ rights,\nmechanical restraints may be used when l ess restrictive interventions have failed and when\n“absolutely necessary to prevent the individual from injury to himself/herself and to others.”  Defs.’\nEx. 910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. I-D-5 at 4.  Conway Human Development\nCenter’s policy on the use of planned restraints provides, “An individual may require the use of\nemergency or planned restraint . . . to contain behavior that is dangerous to self, others, or property.\nUnless clinically contraindicated, the use of restraint is a last resort containment measure preceded\nby less restrictive measures.” D  efs.’ Ex. 910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. II-D-\n12 at 1.  The policy also provides:\nContainment Restraint: Orders for restraint are time limited and shall not\nexceed one hour and 50 minutes for an adult or one hour for a child or\nadolescent.  The individual is immobilized until calm by an approved device or\ndevices which prevent movement of the  body or parts of the body and/or normal\nfunction, not to exceed 15 minutes without an extension approved and documented\nby the QMRP14/designee, preferably after face-to-face attention.  Unless otherwise\ndetermined by the IDT,15 QMRP/designee, extensions will be obtained every 15\nminutes until the individual is calm.  The IDT should define what constitutes calm\nbehavior for this individual when used in a behavior program.  Unless determined\nclinically contraindicated by the QMRP/designee, should time in restraint reach 55\nminutes, the individual must be released for five mi nutes for the opportunity for\nmotion, liquid intake, or toileting.  Should time restraint reach 1 hour and 50 minutes,\nthe individual must be released for at least 10 minutes for the previously listed\nactivities.  If this 10-minute release is judged to be a danger to the individual\nand/others, additional staff  should be called to ensure  safety for all concerned.\nConstant supervision is required. \nId. at 3 (bold, italics, andu nderlining in the original).  The planned use of mechanical restraints must\n14 Qualified Mental Retardation Professional.\n15 Interdisciplinary Team.\n25\n\nbe reviewed and approved by the chief psychologist, the human rights committee, the primary care\nphysician, the superintendent, and the parent or guardian.  Tr. 6563-64 (K. Priest); Defs.’ Ex. 910,\nConway Human Development Center Policy No. I-D-5 at 7.\nIn addition to the use of mechanical restraints as a part of a safety plan, Conway Human\nDevelopment Center permits the use of mechanical restraints as an emergency measure to protect\nthe resident or other residents from injury.  The incident must be documented, and notice must be\ngiven to the interdisciplinary team, the child psychologist, the superintendent, the human rights\ncommittee, and others.  An individual placed in a mechanical restraint must be monitored at least\nevery fifteen minutes and must be g iven an opportunity for motion and exercise for at least five\nminutes during each hour.  The unplannedu se of mechanical restraints must be reviewed by the chief\npsychologist, the human rights committee, the primary care physician, the superintendent, and the\nparent or guardian.  Defs.’ Ex. 910, Conway Human Development Center Policy No. II-D-13.\nWhile the use of mechanical restraints is troubling, psychologists called by both the plaintiff\nand the defendants agreed that it is sometimes necessary to use mechanical restraints when providing\ncare  for  persons  with the disabilities and ps ychiatric  disorders found at Conway   Human\nDevelopment Center.  Tr. 1180, 1248-49 (J. Matson); Tr. 5565 (B. Gale); Tr. 5855-56 (K. Walsh).\nThe regulations that govern intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded provide for the use\nof restraints within certain limits and with specified controls.  See 42 C.F.R. § 483.420(a)(6) (2011)\n(requiring facilities to ensure that residents are free from unnecessary restraints and are provided\nactive treatment to reduce the need for physical restraints); 42 C.F.R. § 483.440(f)(3)(iii) (requiring\na facility to have a committee consisting of staff, parents and guardians, and unaffiliated persons to\nreview, monitor, and make suggestions regarding the use of physical restraints, among other things);\n26\n\n42 C.F.R. § 483.450(b)(1)(iv)(B) (requiring a facility to adapt and implement policies and procedures\nregarding the use of physical restraints for the management of inappropriate behavior); cf. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 290ii (2006) (governing the use of restraints in facilities that receive federal funds).  The policies\nof Conway Human Development Center comply  with these regulations.  The Center’s use of\nmechanical restraints is consistent with the regulations that govern intermediate care facilities for\nthe mentally retarded and is not a substantial departure from generally accepted professional\nstandards.16  Tr. 5565-72 (B. Gale); Tr. 5854-60, 5871 (K. Walsh).\nConway Human Development Center has made and is making a conscientious effort to\nreduce the use of mechanical restraints.  Implementation of a program of safety plans, positive\nbehavior support plans, and strategies is part of that effort. F rom 2005 until the time of trial, the use\nof mechanical restraints at the Center declined by sixty-nine percent.  Tr. 5798, 5865 (K. Walsh).\nIn September of 2009, six ty-two residents had contingent restraints in their plans,  which is\napproximately twelve percent of the residents.  Tr. 5868 (K. Walsh).  In other words, eighty-eight\npercent had no restraints whatsoever in their plans . From July of 2008 through July of 2009, eighty-\neight percent of the incidents of restraints involved three individuals.  Tr. 5868 (K. Walsh).  At the\ntime of trial, restraints had been removed from the plans of two of those three individuals.  Tr. 5869\n16 Carla Jo Osgood testified for the plaintiff that the use of restraints at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center substantially departs from generally accepted standards. As with her\ntestimony regarding abuse and neglect, her testimony regarding the use of restraints was\nunpersuasive.  Osgood performed no quantitative analysis comparing rates of injury at Conway\nHuman Development Center to rates of injury at similar facilities or to any other benchmarks. \nTr. 247-48 (C. Osgood).  Nor did she provide any evidence that she was qualified to testify as an\nexpert regarding restraint use.  More credible testimony criticizing the Center’s use of restraints\nwas offered by psychologists called as expert witnesses for the plaintiff, but for the reasons stated\nin this section and in the succeeding section of these findings, that testimony was insufficient to\nmeet the plaintiff’s burden of proof.\n27\n\n(K. Walsh).\nBased on the greater weight of the evidence, the Court finds that no pattern and practice\nexists at Conway Human Development Center of using restraints without sufficient safeguards and\nsupervision to ensure that the safety, welfare, and civil and human rights of residents are adequately\nprotected; and the Court finds that the use of restraints at the Center does not represent a substantial\ndeparture from generally accepted standards applicable to intermediate care facilities for the mentally\nretarded.\n3. Allegations that Psychological Services at Conway Human Development\nCenter Substantially Depart from Generally Accepted Standards\nAlthough the plaintiff alleges that the psychological services at Conway Human Development\nCenter substantially depart from generally accepted standards, that allegation was not proven by the\ngreater weight of the evidence.\nJohnny Lee Matson, Ph.D., and Ramasamy Manikam, Ph.D., testified for the plaintiff that\nthe psychological services offered at the Center depart substantially from generally accepted\nstandards in a number of ways, but the Court had difficulty in ascertaining to what standards they\nreferred and what they meant when they testified that a practice was a substantial departure from\nthose standards.  It appeared that when they used terms such as “departures from generally accepted\nstandards,” they meant that the practices at Conway Human Development Center were not the best.\nThat interpretation of their testimony was confirmed to some extent by Dr. Matson.  On cross-\nexamination, Dr. Matson testified that a substantial departure is the same thing as failing to meet best\npractices.  Tr. 1219 (J. Matson).  Although he modified that statement on redirect examination,\nTr. 1301, 1327 (J. Matson), it still appeared to be an accurate description of the opinions offered by\nhimself and Dr. Manikam, i.e., that the practices at Conway Human Development Center were not\n28\n\nthe best practices.  For ex ample, at one point Dr. Matson criticized one of the psy chological\nexaminers for using bar charts rather than graphs to record behavioral incidents of residents who\nhave behavior plans.  Tr. 1145-46 (J . Matson).  Dr. Matson also said that something could be a\nstandard even if only ten percent of the professionals in his fi eld were doing it.  Dr. Manikam\ntestified, “In this field, [ the] standards are fluid.  I t’s not a body that is se tting the standard.”\nTr. 3155 (R. Manikam).  I n the end, the Court  concluded that Drs. Matson and Manikam were\ncorrect that the provision of psychology services at Conway Human Development Center could be\nimproved, nor is it likely that anyone would argue to the contrary.  The fact that psychology services\nat Conway Human Development Center could  be improved does not mean, however, that the\nprofessionals who provide those services have departed so substantially from generally accepted\nstandards that it cannot be said that they are exercising professional judgment. \nThe Court finds from the greater weight of the evidence that the professionals who are\nproviding psychological services at Conway Human Development Center aree xercising professional\njudgment and that their practices are within  the boundaries of g enerally accepted professional\nstandards.  Psychological services are provided at Conway Human Development Center by ten\npsychological examiners licensed by the State of Arkansas.  Tr. 1936-37 (C. Reddig).  The chief\npsychologist, Dr. Carl Reddig, has an Ed.D. in psychology.  Tr. 1938-39 (C. Reddig); Pl.’s Ex. 557.\nThe licensed psychological examiners have master’s degrees in psychology, Tr. 1937 (C. Reddig);\nTr. 6550 (K. Priest); Tr. 6672 (E. Glenn); Tr. 6712 (W. McKindra), and six of them are licensed to\npractice independently, Tr. 6689 (E. Glenn).  Their qualifications meet the standards imposed by the\nregulations that govern intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded.  See 42 C.F.R.\n§ 483.430(b)(5)(v).  Conway  Human Development Ce nter’s practice of hiring  master’s level,\n29\n\nlicensed psychological examiners is within theb ounds of generally accepted practice at intermediate\ncare facilities for the mentally retarded.  Tr. 5875-76 (K. Walsh).\nThe evidence established that some and perhaps al l of the psychological examiners at\nConway Human Development Center lack formal training in applied behavioral analy sis.  The\nregulations that govern intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, however, do not require\npsychologists  to have formal training   in applied behavioral analy sis.    See  42 C.F .R.\n§ 483.430(b)(5)(v).  The evidence fails to show th at it is a substantial departure from generally\naccepted practice for psychological services at such a faci lity to be provided by psychological\nexaminers who do not have formal training in applied behavioral analysis.\nThe evidence also fails to prove that the practices followed and procedures used by the\npsychological examiners at Conway Human Development Center substantially depart from generally\naccepted professional standards. Much of the testimony at trial focused on functional behavior\nassessments, which are designed to determine the function that is served by maladaptive behaviors.\nTr. 5794 (K. Walsh).  The theory is that if the function of a maladaptive behavior can be determined,\nthen that function can be served in another way so that the individual will not feel the need to engage\nin the maladaptive behavior.  Tr. 6563 (K. Priest).  These functional behavior assessments are used\nin formulating positive behavior support plans  and strategies.  Tr. 6562- 63 (K. Priest).  The\npsychological examiners at Conway Human Development Center exercise professional judgment\nin performing functional behavior assessments and in performing their other duties.  Tr. 5828-30,\n5836-37 (K. Walsh); Tr. 6566-70 (K. Priest); Tr. 6673-77 (E. Glenn).  While it seems likely that\nDrs. Matson and Manikam could perform functional behavioral assessments and other duties of\npsychological examiners better than some of Conway Human Development Center’s psychological\n30\n\nexaminers, the evidence failed to establish that the functional behavior assessments or other work\nof  the  psychological  examiners  at  the  Center  substantially  depart  from  generally  accepted\nprofessional standards.  Tr. 5853-54 (K. Walsh).\n4. Allegations that Conway Human Development Center Fails to Provide\nAdequate Medical Care\nAlthough the plaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development Center has a pattern and\npractice of providing inadequate medical care to its residents, the greater weight of the evidence\ndisproves that allegation.\nAt the time of trial, Conway Human Development Center had a staff o ffour full-time primary\ncare physicians: Denise Thomas, D.O., who serves as the medical director; Patricia Parmley, M.D.;\nJarrett Lea, M.D.; and Sam Schultz , M.D.   Tr. 1724 (D. Thomas ); Tr. 5482 (P. Parmley ).\nDrs. Thomas and Lea are family doctors, and Drs. Parmley and Schultz are pediatricians.17  Tr. 5449,\n5482 (P. Parmley).  There was one vacancy on the medical staff at the time of trial.  Tr. 6880\n(C. Price).  After-hours care is provided by another primary care physician, Dr. Gary Stewart, who\nresides at the facility.  Tr. 1725 (D.T  homas).  These primary care physicians are available to provide\nmedical care to residents of Conway Human Development Center twenty-four hours per day, 365\ndays per year.  Additional physician services, including those of a neurologist, an epidemiologist,\nand an infectious disease physician, are provided through a contract with the University of Arkansas\nfor Medical Sciences.  Tr. 6880 (C. Price).  I n addition to its phy sicians, Conway Human\nDevelopment Center employs approximately twenty registered nurses and ei ghty-six licensed\npractical nurses.  Tr. 5382, 5386 (S. Gar dner).  Not only is the Center sufficiently staffed with\n17 Dr. Parmley has completed a fellowship in developmental behavioral pediatrics.  Tr.\n5449 (P. Parmley).\n31\n\nmedical personnel to meet the needs of its residents, but it also provides psychiatric services in a\nmanner  that  complies  with  generally  accepted  practices,  uses and m onitors  medications\nappropriately, and provides medical services that are adequate to protect its residents. \nIn making findings related to medical care, particularly psychiatric care, at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center, the Court must judge the credibility of the plaintiff’s expert witnesses.  Jodie\nHolloway, M.D., and Edwin J. Mikkelsen, M.D., who testified for the plaintiff, are board certified\nin general psychiatry and in child and adolescent psychiatry.  Dr. Holloway is also board certified\nin forensic psychiatry.  Both Drs. Holloway and Mikkelsen are qualified to give expert testimony in\nthe field of psychiatry under Rule 702 of the F ederal Rules of Evidence.  Both are impressive\nindividuals.  Ultimately, however, they were not more believable than the experts called by the\ndefendants, in part because in some notable instances their conclusions went beyond the scope of\nthe support offered for those conclusions.\nFor instance, Dr. Holloway testified that psychiatric services at Conway Human Development\nCenter are substandard with respect to children because the Center does not employ a psychiatrist\nwho is board certified in child and adolescent psychiatry.  Tr. 2514-16 (J. Holloway).  In support of\nthat opinion, she cited and read from a policy statement of the American Academy of Child and\nAdolescent Psychiatry, which was received into  evidence as Plaintiff’s Exhibit 870.  Tr. 2516\n(J. Holloway).  That policy statement on its face applies to hospitals, not to intermediate care\nfacilities.  Tr. 6206-07 (L . Kraus); Pl.’s Ex. 870.  Moreover, Dr. Holloway admitted on cross-\nexamination that the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry refers to its policy\nstatement as “a voice on the issues” and states that the policy is not intended to define a standard of\ncare.  Tr. 2635 (J. Holloway).\n32\n\nDr. Holloway also testified that Conway Human Development Center does not adequately\nassess individuals for tardive dyskinesia, a disorder that sometimes develops as a side effect of\npsychotropic medications.  The percentage of individuals at Conway Human Development Center\nwith a diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia is low.  Tr. 3979 (T. Kastner).  Even though Conway Human\nDevelopment Center uses the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale to assess residents for tardive\ndyskinesia, Dr. Holloway testified that the incidents of tardive dyskinesia at the Center must be\ngreater than the number of persons who have  that diagnosis.  Tr. 2606-07 (J . Holloway).  She\nconcluded,  therefore,  that  Conway  Human De velopment  Center does  not  adequately  assess\nindividuals for tardive dyskinesia as a side effect of the psychotropic medications used there.  That\nthe percentage of residents at Conway Human Development Center who have a diagnosis of tardive\ndyskinesia is low could mean either that the Center fails to identify the individuals with tardive\ndyskinesia or that the Center manages psychotropic medications in a manner that minimizes side\neffects such as tardive dyskinesia.  The evidence failed to show that any resident at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center has tardive dyskinesia but has not been diagnosed.  Tr. 4701-02 (A. Warren);\nTr. 6214-15 (L. Kraus).  Nevertheless, Dr. Holloway insisted that the Center does not adequately\nassess residents for tardive dyskinesia.\nDr.  Mikkelsen  testified  that  the  overall  medical  services  offered at   Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center are substandard and cited as evidence the fact that the average age of death of\nresidents at the Center is lower than the average age of death of residents at certain facilities in\nMassachusetts and Connecticut.  Tr. 3772 (E. Mikkelsen).  Thee vidence established, however, that\nthose facilities serve a substantially older population than does Conway Human Development\nCenter, so the facilities are not comparable as to the average age at which residents might die.\n33\n\nTr. 3847-48 (E. Mikkelsen); Tr. 4096-97 (T. Kastner).  Dr. Mikkelsen also testified that the rate of\ndeaths due to aspiration pneumonia at Conway Human Development Center supports his opinion\nthat medical care at the Center is substandard, Tr. 3776-77, 3918 (E. Mikkelsen),  but there is no\nstatistically significant difference between the death rate due to pneumonia at the Center and the rate\nat the facilities in Massachusetts to which Dr. Mikkelsen was comparing the Center.  Tr. 4100-01\n(T. Kastner).\nDr. Mikkelsen pointed to several examples of Conway Human Development Center’s alleged\nfailure to monitor the side effects of psychotropic medications, one of which concerned CL, a nine-\nyear-old boy who was admitted to the Center with a preexisting prescription for Lithium.18  Lithium\nis a psychotropic medication with a narrow ther apeutic range and severe toxic consequences.\nTr. 5480 (P. Parmley). When CL was admitted into Conway Human Development Center, the\nmedical staff had some doubt as to whether he  had received his Lithium consistently.  Tr. 5456\n(P. Parmley).  They drew blood to ascertain th e Lithium level and found that the level was 0.5.\nTr. 4118 (T. Kastner). Staff at the Center then administered the Lithium in accordance with the\nprescription that had been written before CL came to the Center.  After allowing sufficient time for\nthe Lithium to reach a stable level, another lab test was conducted and the Lithium level was\ndetermined to be 1.0, which is within what Dr. Mikkelsen called the therapeutic range.  Tr. 4118\n(T. Kastner); Tr. 5456-57 (P. Parmley).  Over the following month, CL had one incident of difficulty\nin swallowing, but there was no other record ofa nything out of the ordinary.  Tr. 4119 (T. Kastner).\nApproximately one month later, staff observed one evening that CL had an altered gait and took him\nto the infirmary.  Tr. 5457 (P. Parmley).  At the infirmary it was found that he had some upper\n18 See Tr. 3660-88 for Dr. Mikkelsen’s direct testimony regarding CL. \n34\n\nrespiratory distress.  Dr. Stewart ,who provides after-hours care in the infirmary, ordered that a check\nbe taken of the Lithium level.  The Lithium level was found to be in excess of 4.0, which is a toxic\nlevel.  Tr. 4119 (T. Kastner).  CL was kept in the infirmary overnight, and on the following morning\nDr. Stewart ordered a “trough level” test be taken to determine the level of Lithium.  The level again\nexceeded 4.0, and Dr. S tewart admitted CL to Conway Regional Medical Center.  Tr. 4121\n(T. Kastner); Tr. 5458 (P. Parmley).  At Conway Regional Medical Center, the Lithium level was\nagain determined to be at a toxic level, and CL was transferred to Arkansas Children’s Hospital in\nLittle Rock, Arkansas.  Tr. 5458 (P. Parmley).  His Lithium level was stabilized, and he was found\nto have pneumonia.  Tr. 4123 (T. Kastner).  CL was later discharged and has suffered no ongoing\neffects of Lithium toxicity.  Tr. 5459 (P. Parmley).  According to Dr. Mikkelsen, CL’s Lithium level\ncontinued to increase during the month between CL’s admission into Conway Human Development\nCenter and the evening when he was first taken to the infirmary.  Dr. Mikkelsen believed that the\nswallowing incident was probably due to nausea and vomiting, which are signs of Lithium toxicity.\nTr. 3665-66 (E. Mikkelsen).  He also testified that CL necessarily had other symptoms of Lithium\ntoxicity that were not recorded because the stfaf failed to observe them.  Tr. 3678-79 (E. Mikkelsen).\nIn contrast, Theodore Kastner, M.D., testified that there was no basis for believing that CL\nhad Lithium toxicity during the month between his admission to Conway Human Development\nCenter and the evening when he was taken to the infirmary.  Tr. 4125 (T. Kastner). According to\nDr. Kastner, the elevation in CL’s Lithium level likely was the result of pneumonia and dehydration.\nTr. 4123-24 (T. Kastner).  Dr. Kast ner did not believe that the si ngle incident of difficulty in\nswallowing was caused by Lithium toxicity, nor did he find any evidence that CL had symptoms of\nLithium toxicity during that month.  Tr. 4126 (T. Kastner).  Dr. Kastner, along with another expert,\n35\n\nLouis Kraus, M.D., concluded that Conway Human Development Center staff carefully monitored\npotential side effects of the Lithium and saved CL’s life by quick response to the sudden onset of\nLithium toxicity secondary to pneumonia  and dehydration.  Tr. 4530 (T. Kastner); Tr. 6218\n(L. Kraus). After it was called to Dr. Mikkelsen’s attention that CL had pneumonia, he testified that\nthe pneumonia was due to aspiration of fluids dur ing the swallowing incident. Nothing in the\nmedical records indicates that CL aspirated fluids.\nDr. Mikkelsen’s opinion regarding CL depends upon findings for which there is no evidence\nand blames the staff at Conway Human Development Center for failing to record evidence that\nwould have supported those findings.  The evidence at trial established that the staff of Conway\nHuman Development Center appropriately monitored CL and responded to changes in his medical\ncondition—they  saved his life.  Yet, Dr. Mikkelsen criticized the medical care given to CL based\non an assumption that CL had Lithium toxicity for a month before anyone noticed, which is an\nassumption unsupported by evidence.\nThere were two more examples of a similar nature in the testimony of Dr. Mikkelsen.  One\nof them involved TN, who had a dramatic decrease in his platelet count  after having been on\nDepakote for several years.19  Dr. Mikkelsen testified that the dramatic decrease in platelets was\nsecondary to Depakote, which had been prescribedf or TN by a neurologist as a means of controlling\nTN’s seizures.  According to Dr. Mikkelsen, this was another instance in which Conway Human\nDevelopment Center failed to monitor the side effects of psychotropic medication.  The evidence\nestablished, however, that the dramatic  decrease in platelet count wa s secondary to an acute\ninfection, and the platelet count rebounded with  treatment of the infection and administration of\n19 See Tr. 3736-52 for Dr. Mikkelsen’s direct testimony regarding TN.\n36\n\nsteroid medication even tho ugh TN continued  to receive Depakote.  Tr. 4179 (T. Kastner).\nDr. Mikkelsen recognized that the drop in TN’s platelet count could be attributed to the infection but\nsaid that whether the dramatic decrease in platelet count “was solely related to the Depakote or the\nDepakote plus the acute illness would be hard  to sort out.”  Tr. 3752 (E. Mikkelsen).  Still,\nDr. Mikkelsen admitted that TN’s paltelet count recovered to its baseline level in the face ofo ngoing\ntreatment with Depakote.  Tr. 3866 (E. Mikkelsen);  cf. Tr. 4694-95 (A. Warren).  TN thereafter\ncontinued taking Depakote, and yet he did well.  Tr. 4179 (T. Kastner).  Common sense suggests that\nif TN’s platelet count recovered to its baseline level and remained stable thereafter while TN was\ntaking Depakote, Depakote was not the cause of the dramatic decrease in the platelet count.\nAnother example from Dr. Mikkelsen’s testimony concerned CJ, a fifty-nine-year-old woman\nwho Dr. Mikkelsen testified died from neuroleptic malignant syndrome caused by an increase in her\nHaldol prescription.20  Dr. Mikkelsen testified that CJ died from neuroleptic malignant syndrome\neven though the medical records do no treflect that she hads ymptoms typical of that syndrome.  One\nof the classic symptoms, as Dr. Mikkelsen admitte d, is high fever.  Althoug h there are a few\ninstances in the literature of a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome without high fever, it is\nexceedingly rare.  Tr. 3874-75 (E. Mikkelsen); Tr. 4199, 4203 (T. Kastner).  CJ’s temperature was\nnormal or below.  Pl.’s Ex. 791-1 to -5.  Another symptom is rigidity.  Dr. Mikkelsen testified that\nthe fact that CJ had her knees bent meant that  her legs were rigid, which is hardly convincing.\nTr. 3706-08 (E. Mikkelsen); Tr. 4193 (T. Kastner).   Another symptom of neuroleptic malignant\nsyndrome is an oculogyric crisis, which is a spasmodic attack marked by a fixation of the eyes in one\nposition—usually upward.  Tr. 3875-76 (E. Mikkelsen).  Nothing in the medical records indicated\n20 For Dr. Mikkelsen’s testimony regarding CJ, see Tr. 3690-3718.\n37\n\nthat CJ’s eyes were fixated.  Tr. 4697 (A. Warren).  Dr. Mikkelsen testified that the medical record\nfailed to state that CJ’s eyes were fixated because the treating physician failed to look at CJ’s eyes.\nTr. 3718, 3876 (E. Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen was not present when the physician examined CJ,\nso he cannot possibly know whether the physician examined her eyes.\nAlthough Drs. Holloway and Mikkelsen are highly qualified expert psychiatrists, the Court\nhas concluded that their opinionsa re not as reliable as the contrary opinions offered by experts called\nby the defendants.\na. Allegations  that Psy chiatric  Services  for  Children  at\nConway Human Development Center Are Inadequate\nThe greater weight of the evidence establishes that psychiatric services for children at\nConway Human Development Center comply with generally accepted professional standards.\nDouglas Callahan, M.D., is the consulting psychiatrist at Conway Human Development\nCenter.  Tr. 1729 (D. Thomas).   Dr. Callahan is licensed to prac tice medicine in the State of\nArkansas and is board certified in general psychiatry.  The core competency of a board-certified\npsychiatrist includes the care of children.   Tr. 4224 (T. Kastner).  Dr . Callahan has provided\npsychiatric services to persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities for more than twenty\nyears.  Tr. 5335-36 (D. Callahan).  He serves as a consultant to the primary care physicians.  The\nresidents at Conway Human Development Center who need psychiatric services are referred to\nDr. Callahan, who sees them on campus.  Direct care staff and psychological examiners accompany\nresidents when they are seen by Dr. Callahan, and they provide information to him regarding the\nresidents’ behavioral symptoms.  Tr. 5364-65 (D. Callahan); Tr. 6556-57 (K. Priest).  Dr. Callahan\nmakes diagnoses and recommendations regarding medication and other psychiatric care.  Hi s\ndiagnoses and recommendations are recorded in progress notes, which are forwarded to thep rimary\n38\n\ncare physicians for review.  The primary care physicians then decide whether to implement the\nrecommendations  from Dr. Calla han.   Tr. 5484 (P. P armley).   Dr. Callahan is on campus\napproximately two days each week.  He has an offcie in the same suite of offices as the primary care\nphysicians.  When he is on campus, he regularly sees the primary care physicians, and when he is\nnot on campus, he is available for consultation by telephone.\nThere is a shortage of child psychiatrists in the United States and specifically in the State of\nArkansas.  Tr. 4616-18 (D. Fassler); Tr. 6204-05 (L. Kraus).  Moreover, very few child psychiatrists\nhave specific training in dealing with children with developmental  disabilities.  Tr. 4623-24\n(D. Fassler).  Psychiatric services are provided to children in the United States most often through\npediatricians or general practitioners.  Tr. 4621-22 (D. Fassler).\nThe model of care at Conway Human Development Center by which psychiatric services are\nprovided to children, through the use of a board-certified pediatrician consulting with a physician\nwho is board certified in general psychiatry, is permitted by the regulations that govern intermediate\ncare facilities for the mentally retarded, 42 C.F.R. § 483.430(b)(5), and is within the bounds of\ngenerally accepted practice for such facilities.  Tr.  4222 (T. Kastner); Tr. 4624-25 (D. Fassler);\nTr. 6212 (L. Kraus).  Psychiatric services provided to children at Conway Human Development\nCenter are consistent with generally accepted professional standards.  Tr. 6212-13 (L. Kraus).\nb. Allegations  that Psychotropic Medications Are\nInappropriately Prescribed to Control Behavior\nAlthough the plaintiff alleg es that Conway Human Development Center overprescribes\npsychotropic medications to control behavior, the greater weight of the evidence does not support\nthat allegation.  Psychiatric diagnoses generally are made following the criteria of the fourth edition\nof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.  Those criteria often rely upon patient\n39\n\nreports that persons with mental retardation are unable to give.  The reliability of diagnoses of\npsychiatric disorders in persons with mental retardation, therefore, is in inverse proportion to the\nlevel of disability.  Tr. 3818-19 (E. Mikkelsen); Tr. 4645-46 (A. Warren).  In other words, the greater\nthe level of mental retardation, the less reliable the psychiatric diagnoses.  While in general it may\nbe inappropriate to use medication simply to suppress bad behavior, it is not a substantial departure\nfrom generally accepted professional standards to use medication to treat specific behavioral\nsymptoms in psychiatric patients with mental retardation, whether or not an identifiable psychiatric\ndiagnosis can be made.  Tr. 3828 (E. Mikkelsen); Tr. 4646, 4679, 4682-83, 4693-94 (A. Warren);\nTr. 6222-24, 6275 (L. Kraus).  The regulations that govern intermediate care facilities for the\nmentally retarded authorize the use of medication to control inappropriate behavior.  42 C.F .R.\n§ 483.450(e).  So far as the evidence showed, the ues of psychotropic medications at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center is consistent with those regulations.21  The use of psychotropic medications at\nConway Human Development Center is not a substantial departure from generally accepted\nprofessional standards.  Tr. 4703-04 (A. Warren); Tr. 5450 (P. Parmley); Tr. 6207, 6223-24, 6227\n(L. Kraus).\nc. Allegations that Conway Human Development Center Fails\nto Monitor Side Effects of Psychotropic Medications\nIn addition to allegations of overuse, the plaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development\nCenter fails to monitor the side effects of the psychotropic medications it prescribes.  The greater\nweight of the evidence does not support that allegation.\nAll medications have potential side effects.  In the case of psychotropic medications, those\n21 The caveat to this statement is that no evidence was presented regarding 42 C.F.R. §\n483.450(e)(4)(ii).\n40\n\nside effects can be serious.  Reasonably careful physicians weigh the risks of the side effects of a\nparticular medication against the benefits that the patient may obtain from the use of that medication.\nDr. Callahan testified, and the Court believes, that at Conway Human Development Center the risk\nversus benefit calculation often is done mentally but not recorded in the practicing physician’s notes.\nTr. 5349, 5372 (D. Callahan).\nThe use of psychotropic medications at Conway Human Development Center typically is\ninitiated by a recommendation from Dr. Callahan (unless a client comes to Conway Human\nDevelopment Center with preexisting prescriptions for psychotropic medications) and then is\nforwarded to the primary care physician who writes the order.  Before the prescription is filled, the\nuse of the psychotropic medication must be reviewed by the interdisciplinary team and the human\nrights committee, and it must be approved by  the parent or  guardian of the resident.  The\ninterdisciplinary team, which includes the primary care physician, discusses what the medication is\nexpected to accomplish, what the potential side effects are, and the relationship between the potential\nrisks and the potential benefits.  Every resident on psychotropic medication will have taper criteria\nwhich the psychological examiners monitor.  Tr. 6614 (K. Priest).  After all of the consents are in\nplace, the primary care physician orders the drug and establishes a laboratory protocol for monitoring\npotential problems.  Tr. 508-09 (S. Murphy ); Tr. 5484-87 (P. Parmley).  These safeguards are\nreasonably prudent safeguards designed to ensure that the risks of psychotropic medications are\naccurately and adequately assessed and weighed against the potential benefits.  Tr. 4163-64 (T.\nKastner); Tr. 6221 (L. Kraus).\nThe potential side effects of each psy chotropic medication are listed in the individual\nprogram plan for each resid ent to whom psychotropic medications are administered.  Tr. 4925\n41\n\n(S. Murphy).  Staff at Conway Human Development Center are trained to watch for symptoms that\nmay be associated with side effects of  psychotropic medications.  Tr. 509, 4871-72, 4924-25\n(S. Murphy).  In addition, when psychotropic medications may result in consequences measurable\nthrough laboratory analyses, monitoring is conducted through laboratory analyses.  Tr. 5486-87\n(P. Parmley).\nConway Human Development Center also uses the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale\nto measure involuntary movements known as ta rdive dyskinesia.  The Abnormal Involuntary\nMovement Scale is the most widely used instrument for the screening of tardive dyskinesia.\nTr. 4231 (T. Kastner).\nThe monitoring of potential side effects of psychotropic medications at the Center complies\nwith generally accepted professional standards.  No pattern or practice exists at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center of failing to monitor for side effects of psychotropic medications.  Tr. 4171-73\n(T. Kastner).\nd. Allegations Regarding Polypharmacy\nThe  plaintiff  also  takes  issue  with C onway  Human Development Center’s use of\npolypharmacy, that is, prescribing two or more psychotropic medications to a resident. Tr. 5342\n(D. Callahan).  Many of the residents at Conway Human Development Center come to the Center\nwith psychiatric diagnoses and with prescriptions for multiple psychotropic medications.  Tr. 5346\n(D. Callahan).  The practice at Conway Human Development Center is to attempt to reduce the\nnumber of psychotropic medications as well as the dosage, but that is not always possible.  Tr. 5345-\n46 (D. Callahan).  An effort is made to avoid poly pharmacy, but in some instances, in the\nprofessional judgment of the physicians at Conway Human Development Center, the benefits of\n42\n\npolypharmacy to individual residents outweigh the risks to those residents, and in those instances\npolypharmacy is used.  Tr. 5346-47 (D. Callahan).  In 2010, 278 of the residents at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center were prescribed psychotropic medications.  F orty-three percent of those\nresidents were prescribed one  psychotropic medication; 33% were prescribed two psychotropic\nmedications; 17% were prescribed three psy chotropic medications; 4.7%  were prescribed four\npsychotropic medications; and 2 re sidents (fewer than 1%) were  prescribed five psychotropic\nmedications.  Tr. 4153 (T. Kastner).\nThe greater weight of the evidence fails to establish that the use of polypharmacy at Conway\nHuman Development Center is excessive and fails to establish a pattern and practice of inappropriate\nor unreasonable use of polypharmacy at the Center.\ne. Allegations  that Inadequate Medical Care Causes\nUnnecessary  Deaths  at  Conway  Human  Development\nCenter\nThe plaintiff also alleges that many unnecessary deaths have occurred at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center due to inadequate medical care, but, again, the greater weight of the evidence\nis to the contrary.\nEldon Schulz, M.D., is the medical director for the Division of Developmental Disability\nServices for the State of Arkansas.  Tr. 6177 (E.  Schulz).  He is the Ro ckefeller Professor for\nChildren with Special Healthcare Needs, Director of the Dennis Development Center at the\nUniversity of Arkansas for M edical Sciences, and a faculty member practicing at Arkansas\nChildren’s Hospital.  Tr. 6178-79  (E. Schulz).  Since 2005 he has served as the phy sician\nrepresentative on a committee that reviews all of the deaths of residents of the human development\ncenters in Arkansas.  Tr. 6179, 6192 (E. Schulz).  As a member of that committee, he reviewed in\n43\n\ndepth the records pertaining to each death at Conway Human Development Center between 2005 and\nthe time of trial.  In his opinion, which the Court credits and adopts, during that time none of the\ndeaths of residents at Conway Human Development Center was due t o medical malpractice.\nTr. 6192-93 (E. Schulz).\nf. Conclusion as to Adequacy of Medical Care\nThe greater weight of the evidence establishes that Conway Human Development Center\nprovides adequate medical care, including psychiatric care, to its residents.  Tr. 4083-84, 4218\n(T. Kastner); Tr. 4649 (A. W arren); Tr. 5456 (P. Pa rmley).  No pattern or practice of medical\nnegligence or inadequate medical care exists at the Center.\n5. Allegations that Conway Human Development Center Fails to Exercise\nCare to Prevent Choking\nThe plaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development Center fails to take proper steps to\nprevent choking incidents among its residents.  The greater weight of the evidence, however, proves\nthat the Center exercises reasonable care to prevent choking.\nFirst, Conway Human Development Center employs seven speech language pathologists who\nwork full-time at the center.  Tr. 5386, 5417 (C. Johnson).  The speech language pathologists are\nlicensed by the State of Arkansas and have a number of duties, including providing speech-language\ntherapy services, providing augmentative communication systems, assessing residents for dysphagia,\nidentifying choking risks, and assisting in issues related to swallowing.  Tr. 5387, 5391-92, 5417 (C.\nJohnson).\nSecond, new employees of Conway Human Development Center are given dysphagia training\nin which they are taught to observe silent signs of aspiration, to thicken liquids properly, and to use\nadaptive equipment properly.  Tr. 5396 (C. Johnson).  New employees are taught that each resident’s\n44\n\neating plan should be reviewed before assisting that resident at mealtime.  Tr. 5396 (C. Johnson).\nThird, Conway Human Development Center takes a number of steps to avoid choking\nincidents during mealtime.  The Center employs a dietician who is licensed by the State of Arkansas.\nTr. 5316-17 (A. Holbrook).  Each residento f Conway Human Development Center has a nutritional\nand eating plan that is desig ned, among other things, to avoid choking incidents.  Tr. 5317-18\n(A. Holbrook); Tr. 5393-94 (C. Johnson).  The Center also uses food service audits and mealtime\nmonitoring to check for proper positioning, silent aspiration, use of adaptive equipment, and other\nfactors related to choking and aspiration.  Tr. 5393-94 (C. Johnson). \nFourth, Conway Human Development Center assesses residents for risk of choking using an\nassessment tool that has been statistically validated on individuals with developmental disabilities\nresiding in congregate facilities.  Tr. 3304 (J. Sheppard).  A choking risk assessment is done each\nyear in preparation for the annual meeting of the residents’ interdisciplinary teams.  Tr. 5407 (C.\nJohnson).  If a resident chokes, that person is reassessed.  Tr. 5407 (C. Johnson).  In the assessment,\nthe resident is identified as either low risk or high risk for pneumonia and choking.  Tr. 6395 (L.\nHenderson).  If a resident scores fifty percent or greater on the assessment for either the choking or\nthe pneumonia risk, that person is placed in a high risk category.  Tr. 6395 (L. Henderson).  Also,\nif a resident has a choking history, has x-ray evidence of aspiration, or is fed by a tube, those factors\ncould place the person in a hig h risk category.  Tr. 6395-96 (L . Henderson).  The information\nregarding a resident’s risk factors is communicated to the program coordinator so that it can be taken\ninto account on that resident’s twenty-four-hour schedule and the individual program plan by the\ninterdisciplinary team.  Tr. 6396 (L. Henderson).  The information is also placed on the dietary sheet\nthat is used in the living unit and is part of the feeding plan.  Tr. 6396 (L. Henderson).\n45\n\nFinally, Conway Human Development Center has a central dysphagia committee, which acts\nas a consultant and an advisory to the interdisciplinary teams regarding dysphagia and swallowing\ndisorders.  Tr. 6389 (L. Henderson).  The committee serves to support and make recommendations\nto the teams as well as the primary care physicians.  Tr. 6389 (L. Henderson).  The central dysphagia\ncommittee reviews all airway events, such as changes in risk factors for choking; choking events;22\ndifficult swallowing events;23 and cases that are referred by any member of the committee, the\nincident review committees, thei nterdisciplinary teams, or the physicians.  Tr. 6389 (L. Henderson).\nThe committee also reviews cases of pneumonia.  Tr. 6389 (L. Henderson).  The head of the central\ndysphagia committee is Linda Henderson, R.N., whose title at Conway Human Development Center\nis “Quality Improvement Nurse.”  Tr. 6387-89 (L. Henderson).  Other members of the committee\ninclude a staff development nurse, primary care physicians, four speech therapists, three clinical\ntherapists, a clinic supervisor, an occupational therapist, a physical therapist, a dietician, a human\nrights committee chairperson, a living unit supervisor representative, an infection control nurse, an\nadministrative representative, Conway Human Development Center’s dentist and dental hygienist,\na program coordinator representative, and the director of nursing.  Tr. 6402 (L. Henderson).  The\ncentral dysphagia committee meets monthly but will sometimes meet more often than once a month\n22 Conway Human Development Center defines “choking” as a partial or complete\nobstruction of the airway due to a foreign body, such as food or non-edibles.  The onset of\nrespiratory distress may be sudden with coughing; there may be agitation in the early stages of\nairway obstruction.  The signs of respiratory distress include labored, ineffectual breathing until a\nperson can no longer breathe; loss of consciousness will occur if the obstruction is not relieved. \nTr. 6402 (L. Henderson).\n23 Conway Human Development Center defines a “difficult swallowing event” as an event\nin which no intervention is required; no acute change in vital signs occurs; and there are no\nsymptoms of airway obstruction, such as change in skin color, eyes protruding, dizziness, change\nin level of consciousness, or inability to speak or make a sound.  Tr. 6390 (L. Henderson).\n46\n\nif necessary.  Tr. 6392-93 (L. Henderson).\nPrior to a committee meeting, Henderson reviews the clinical record and gathers reportable\ninformation that is used by the central dysphagia committee.  Tr. 6391 (L. Henderson).  The report\nfor any particular resident includes a history of choking events; a history of difficult swallowing\nevents;  yearly  choking  and pneumonia assessmen t  risks; any  x-ray  studies or diag noses  of\nswallowing  abnormalities; a nd  any  types  of follow-th rough  studies,  such  as  an\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy24  or x -rays  of the upper g astrointestinal  region.   Tr. 6391\n(L. Henderson).  The committee then reviews the resident’s respiratory diagnoses, such as asthma\nor  chronic rhinitis, and the resident’s history   of  respiratory  disease or dist ress.    Tr.  6391\n(L. Henderson).  The committee also reviews spinal issues, such as curvature of the spine, rod or\nmetal implants, and the like.  Tr. 6391 (L. Henderson).  The committee looks at the resident’s past\nhistory of pneumonia and aspiration; other gastrointestinal and oral disorders, such as gastrointestinal\nreflux disease or gastritis; esophagitis; constipation; ileus or hiatal hernia; gastric ulcers; or H. pylori\ninfection.  Tr. 6391-92 (L. Henderson).  The committee also looks for strictures of the esophagus and\ngingivitis.  Tr. 6392 (L. Henderson).  It then considers what precautions and interventions are already\nin place and reviews the resident’s food and fluid consistencies and whether the person has altered\nmeans of nutrition, such as a feeding tube.  Tr. 6392 (L. Henderson).  The committee also reviews\nthe resident’s oral hygiene care.  Tr. 6392 (L. Henderson).\nWhen a difficult swallowing event occurs, the resident is evaluated by a speech therapist,\nusually at the next meal or the next snack after the swallowing event.  Tr. 6393-94 (L. Henderson).\n24 An esophagogastroduodenoscopy is an endoscopic examination of the esophagus,\nstomach, and duodenum.  Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary 643 (30th ed. 2003).\n47\n\nThe speech therapist determines whether it is safe for the resident to eat and, if so, what type of diet\nis needed and then communicates that information to the dietician.  Tr. 6393 (L. Henderson).  If the\nphysician, the dietician, or the speech therapist believes that a swallow study is needed, then it is\nordered.  Tr. 6393 (L. Henderson).  In 2009, thirty-three percent of the residents of Conway Human\nDevelopment Center were referred for a modified barium study, and ninety-one percent of the studies\nrevealed abnormal swallowing.  Tr. 3305 (J. Sheppard). \nMembers of the staff at Conway  Human Development Center are trained in methods of\nclearing a resident’s airway when a choking incident does occur.  If a choking event occurs, staff will\nimmediately provide first aid and make any necessary dietary changes.  Tr. 6397 (L. Henderson).\nThe speech therapist will evaluate and report her  findings to the physician as well as to a core\nmeeting of some of the central dy sphagia committee members.  Tr. 6397-98 (L . Henderson).\nSometimes a doctor will be called to the scene of ac hoking event.  At other times, the resident will\ngo to the infirmary after a choking event to be evaluated by a physician.  The interdisciplinary team\nwill have a special staffing  to make any  necessary changes in the resident’s twenty -four-hour\nschedule or treatment plan.  The central dysphagia committee will review the incident, and a swallow\nstudy may be conducted.  A gastrointestinal physician may be consulted to evaluate the case.  Reflux\nprecautions may be added if they have not yet been instituted.\nCarly Crawford, an expert witness for the plaintiff, testified that members of the staff at\nConway Human Development Center do not exercise generally accepted minimum professional\njudgment regarding choking.  Tr. 2756-57 (C. Crawford).  The Court, however, isn ot convinced that\nCrawford is qualified to testify as an expert regarding professional standards for the prevention of\nchoking by developmentally disabled persons.   Crawford is an occupational therapist with an\n48\n\nundergraduate degree in deaf education and a master’s degree in occupational therapy.  She is\nlicensed as an occupational therapist in the St ate of Oklahoma.  Tr. 2743 (C. Crawford).  She\ndescribed occupational therapy as looking “at how an individualu ses their hands for daily activities”\nand at positions such as sitting or standing for daily activities.  Tr. 2741 (C. Crawford).  On direct\nexamination, she said that shew  as qualified to testify about services other than occupational therapy\nbecause “I have had education relative to health systems, body systems, understand health risks, and\nunderstand anatomy, physiology, and then have been working shoulder to shoulder with speech\npathologists and physical therapists.”  Tr. 2742-43 (C. Crawford).  Crawford presented no evidence\nthat convinced the Court that she was qualifi ed to testify as an ex pert in any area other than\noccupational therapy.\nApart from her lack of qualifications, Crawford’s credibility was called into question by a\nlack of care i n the manner in which she wrote her report.  Cross-examination revealed that\nCrawford’s report in this case identified the subject of her report as Beatrice State Development\nCenter, which is the name of a facility in another state about which she had previously written a\nreport.  She also referred in her report to sections where recommendations would be made and\nmethodology would be described, but no recommendation section appeared in the report, nor was\nher methodology described anywhere in the report.  Tr. 2905-07 (C. Crawford).\nEven if the Court disregarded these discrepancies, Crawford’s testimony on choking events\nat Conway Human Development Center is unpers uasive.  She testified that Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center has an excessive number of choking episodes, but the only benchmark that she\noffered for comparison was that she had recently been to a facility with 250 to 300 residents that had\nno choking incidents over a six-month period.  Tr. 2768 (C. Crawford).  During the 2009 calendar\n49\n\nyear,  Conway  Human  Development  Center ha d  eleven incidents of choking .   Tr. 6439-40\n(L. Henderson).  The fact that one facility, with a population of 250 to 300 persons, had noe pisodes\nof choking in a six-month period, while some 500 residents of Conway Human Development Center\nhad eleven episodes of choking in a twelve-month period is insufficient to establish that Conway\nHuman Development Center fails to exercise reasonable care to prevent choking events. Crawford’s\ntestimony was inadequate to form the basis for any reliable conclusions.\nOther than Crawford’s testimony that one facility with 250 to 300 residents had no choking\nepisodes in a six-month period, the plaintiff presented no evidence to establish a benchmark from\nother facilities across the United States by which one could determine that the rate of choking at\nConway Human Development Center was unreasonably or unusually large.\nThe weight of the evidence sug gests that it is not.  Cynthia Johnson, a speech language\npathologist  employed  by  Conway  Human Deve lopment  Center,  calculated  that  there  are\napproximately 548,000 occasions each year when a resident might have a choking event,25 so the\nnumber of choking events is quite smallc ompared to the occasions in which choking is a possibility.\nTr. 5446 (C. Johnson).  Justine Joan Sheppard, Ph.D., called by the defendants as an expert in speech\npathology,  testified  that  in 2009 seventy -four  percent of the residents of Conway   Human\nDevelopment Center had a hig h risk of choking, but only 2.17% experienced a choking event.\nTr. 3304 (J. Sheppard).\nIn the past several years, Conway Human Development Center has had one death as a result\nof choking.  That death occurred in 2008 when a profoundly retarded, fifty-eight-year-old resident\n25 The calculation was accomplished by multiplying the number of residents by the\nnumber of mealtimes per year and adding one daily medication pass per day per resident.\n50\n\nwent unnoticed into the kitchen and stuffed food into her mouth.  Tr. 6440-42 (L. Henderson).  At\n11:30 p.m., members of the direct care staff working the night shift noticed the resident asleep on\na couch in the day room, went into the bedrooms to check other residents, and then returned to the\nday room at 11:35 p.m., by which time the resident had gone into the kitchen and stuffed food into\nher mouth.  Pl.’s Ex. 6-3.  Staff attempted to remove the food from the resident’s mouth, clear the\nairway by abdominal thrusts, and administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  An ambulance arrived\nat 11:57 p.m. and took the resident to the nearest hospital where she died of aspiration pneumonia\nseveral days later.  Pl.’s Ex. 6-3.  While that incident is certainly tragic, no evidence was presented\nsufficient to show it is part of a pattern opr ractice of failing to take precautions to minimize choking\nrisks.\nUltimately,  the  evidence  fails  to e stablish  a  pattern  or  practice  at  Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center of failing to take appropriate and reasonable steps to prevent choking.\n6. Allegations that Conway Human Development Center Fails to Exercise\nReasonable Care to Prevent Aspiration Pneumonia\nSimilarly, the plaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development Center fails to exercise\nreasonable care to prevent aspiration pneumonia, but, yet again, the greater weight of the evidence\nis to the contrary.\nConway Human Development Center provides preventive care for pneumonia by taking an\nannual pneumonia risk assessment; by taking reflux precautions, such as keeping residents up for\na period of time after they eat and elevating the head of the bed; by providing oral care; and by\nadministering a pneumonia vaccination annually.  Tr. 5383 (S. Gardner).\nIf a resident is suspected of having pneumonia, that person is assessed by a physician who\nmakes a diagnosis.  Tr. 5384 (S. Gardner).  If a resident is diagnosed with pneumonia, treatment may\n51\n\ninclude an oral or intravenous antibiotic, updrafts, and breathing treatments.  Tr. 5384 (S. Gardner).\nThe resident may be moved into  the on-site infirmary or transported to the hospital.   Tr. 5385\n(S. Gardner).\nData regarding pneumonia is maintained by Conway Human Development Center’s infection\ncontrol nurse, who is a member of the central dysphagia committee.  The infection control nurse\ngives Linda Henderson, the head of thec entral dysphagia committee, a list of every resident who has\nhad a diagnosis, has had an x-ray, or has been in the infirmary or hospital for pneumonia during that\nmonth.  Tr. 6413-14 (L. Henderson).  The centrald ysphagia committee reviews cases of pneumonia,\nacting in an advisory role to the interdisciplinary team.  Tr. 6411-13 (L. Henderson).  If a resident\nhas a case of pneumonia, the central dysphagia committee will follow up with that resident one to\nthree months after the case of pneumonia to ascertain that resident’s respiratory status.  Tr. 6414\n(L. Henderson).\nDr. Mikkelsen testified that the rate of death from aspiration pneumonia at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center was excessive compared to facilities in Massachusetts.26  Tr. 3776-77, 3918\n(E. Mikkelsen).  In 2005, twenty-seven percent of the deaths at Conway Human Development Center\nwere caused by aspiration pneumonia, while twenty-one percent of the deaths in Massachusetts\nfacilities were caused by aspiration pneumonia.  Tr. 4101 (T. Kastner) . Over a two year period, there\nwere nine deaths at Conway Human Development Center due to aspiration pneumonia and six at the\nMassachusetts facilities.  Tr. 4101 (T. Kastner).  Although there was some difference between the\n26 Carly Crawford also testified that the number of incidences of aspiration pneumonia at\nConway Human Development Center was excessive.  However, as mentioned above, Crawford\nwas not qualified to testify as an expert in that field, nor did she offer any benchmarks as\nevidence from which one could compare Conway Human Development Center with other\ninstitutions.\n52\n\nnumber of deaths due to aspiration pneumonia at Conway Human Development Center and facilities\nin Massachusetts, the difference between the rates of death is quite small and is not statistically\nsignificant.  Tr. 4100-01 (T. Kastner).\nConway Human Development Center exercises reasonable care to prevent and to detect\npneumonia.  Although the plaintiff alleges that the residents of Conway Human Development Center\nexperience a high rate of aspiration pneumonia, the evidence fails to show that the rate of aspiration\npneumonia at Conway Human Development Center is statistically higher than the rate in other\nfacilities or among any population with similar risks.  Tr. 4079 (T. Kastner).  The evidence fails to\nestablish a pattern or practice at Conway Human Development Center of failing to take appropriate\nand reasonable steps to prevent aspiration pneumonia.\n7. Allegations that Conway Human Development Center Fails to Exercise\nReasonable Care to Prevent Fractures\nThe plaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development Center fails to exercise reasonable\ncare to prevent fractures, but the greater weight of the evidence establishes that the Center exercises\nreasonable care to prevent fractures.\nThe population at Conway Human Development Center has an increased risk ofo steoporosis\nfor a number of reasons.  In light of this risk, Conway Human Development Center takes a number\nof steps to prevent fractures among its residents.  The Center uses a DEXA (dual  energy x-ray\nabsorption) meter scan for assessing fracture risks.  Tr. 6403 (L. Henderson).  The DEXA meter has\nx-ray capability and uses computer software to analyze the lumbar spine and hip, determining bone\nmineral density and contents.  The software compares that information to what would be expected\nat peak bone age, which is about thirty years of age; compares previous scores and measurements;\nand then takes all of that information and formulates it into a risk assessment.  The resident is then\n53\n\ncategorized as not at risk, at incerased risk, or at high risk for bone fracture based on the results.  The\nDEXA meter also includes a photographic representation of the scan of the bones, which shows\nspaces and gaps in the bones.  Tr. 6403-05 (L. Henderson).  Dr. Steve Kemp, an endocrinologist who\nconsults with Conway Human Development Center, rates these scans and makes the diagnoses of\nosteoporosis, osteopenia, or normal scan.  Tr. 6405, 6438 (L. Henderson).  DEXA meter scans are\nconducted every two years, and the primary care physician reviews the DEXA scan results, as does\nthe interdisciplinary team.  Tr. 6405-06 (L. Henderson).  Very few intermediate care facilities for the\nmentally retarded have an on-site DEXA meter.  Tr. 4065 (T. Kastner).\nSome residents are not suscepti ble to a DEXA scan because of body  shape. For those\nresidents, Conway Human Development Center uses a urine test called an “N-telopeptide,” which\nassesses the rate of bone absorption in the urine.  Tr. 6407 (L. Henderson).  Conway Human\nDevelopment Center also may perform other types of testing, such as endocrine testing, testing for\nVitamin D, and testing for calcium.  Tr. 6407-08 (L. Henderson).\nIn addition to testing for increased risk of fractures, Conway Human Development Center\nhas procedures in place for treating residents who are at risk.  Based on the results of a laboratory\nanalysis of the resident’s blood, the treatment protocol usually begins with Vitamin D and calcium\ntreatments.  If treatment is required for low bone mineral density, Conway Human Development\nCenter usually starts with  bisphosphonates.  Boniva and Fosamax are the two most common\nbisphosphonates used at Conway Human Development Center.  Other therapies for low bone mineral\ndensity are also used.  Tr. 6408 (L. Henderson).\nWhen a resident experiences a fracture at Conway Human Development Center, Linda\nHenderson does a clinical audit.   She assesses the risk of osteopor osis and audits the resident’s\n54\n\nmedical records to see if bone fractures have occurred before.  Henderson then reviews the results\nof any DEXA scans; examines the types of interventions that have been performed; and reviews any\nmedications related to osteoporosis that the resident receives, including calcium and Vitamin D.  She\nalso ascertains whether the resident is having acute back pain, has had any loss of height, or has\ndeveloped kyphosis.  From that information, Henderson then formulates a progress note that the\nphysician will evaluate to see whether additionali nterventions are needed.  Tr. 6410 (L. Henderson).\nAt Conway Human Development Center, there were twenty-one fractures reported for 2008\n(the last year for which data was available at the time of trial), which translates to a rate of\napproximately four fractures per hundred reside nts per year.  Tr. 4082 (T. Kastner). The only\nevidence of any benchmarks for comparison was Dr. Kastner’s testimony regarding a published\nstudy of the annual rates of fractures at four intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded in\nNew England.  At those facilities, the rates of fractures ranged from 13.2 to 15.3 fractures per 100\nresidents per year.  Tr. 4297 (T. Kastner).     Thus,  the rate of fractures at Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center is substantially lower than the fracture rates at other facilities according to the\nonly benchmark offered for comparison.  Tr. 4082 (T. Kastner).27 \nConway Human Development Center exercises reasonable care to prevent fractures.\n8. Allegations that Conway Human Development Center Fails to Exercise\nReasonable Care to Prevent Decubitus Ulcers\nThe greater weight of the evidence establishes that Conway Human Development Center\nexercises reasonable care to prevent decubitus uclers.  From June of 2007 until September 16,2 009,\n27 Carly Crawford testified that Conway Human Development Center had an excessive\nnumber of fractures.  However, as mentioned above, Crawford was not qualified to testify as an\nexpert in that field, nor did she offer any benchmarks from which one could compare Conway\nHuman Development Center with other institutions.\n55\n\nthe Center recorded seventy-seven incidents of decubitus ulcers for forty-six residents.  There were\nthirty-one instances in 2007, twenty instances in 2008, and twenty-six instances in 2009 through\nSeptember 16, 2009.  The rate of decubitus ulcers atth e Center is lower than in comparable facilities\nin the United States.  Tr. 4065, 4081 (T. Kastner).  Most of the decubitus ulcers do not go beyond\nstage two, which involves superficial redness and superficial skin break and is a stage at which the\nulcer can be resolved.  Tr. 3474 (M.  Schmeler).  No evidence was offered to show that the\noccurrence of decubitus ulcers among the residents of Conway Human Development Center is\nexcessive compared to similar populations elsewhere.28  Tr. 3470-71 (M. Schmeler).\n9. Allegations that Conway Human Development Center Fails to Exercise\nReasonable Care to Protect Residents from Injuries in General\nResidents at Conway Human Development Center do not suffer mo re frequent or more\nserious injuries than comparable populations in ohter settings.  In 2008 and the first half of 2009, the\ninjury rate at Conway  Human Development  Center was .41 per pers on per year.  Tr. 5940\n(K. Walsh).  The per person per year rates of specific injuries at Conway Human Development\nCenter in 2008 and the first half of 2009 were: for cuts, .16; for fractures, .06; for bruises, .06; for\nbites, .02; for swellings/sprains, .03; for abrasions, .03; for burns, .00; and for other injuries, .05.\nTr. 5942 (K. Walsh).  Reported injury rates for other institutions range from .36 per person per year\nto .65 per person per year.  Tr. 5941 (K. Walsh).  The rate of injury at Conway Human Development\nCenter falls into that range.  The greater weight of the evidence establishes that Conway Human\nDevelopment exercises reasonable care to protect residents from injuries.\n28 Carly Crawford also testified that Conway Human Development Center had an\nexcessive number of ulcers.  However, as mentioned above, Crawford was not qualified to testify\nas an expert in that field, nor did she offer any benchmarks from which one could compare\nConway Human Development Center with other institutions.\n56\n\n10. Allegations that Residents of Conway Human Development Center Die\nat an Early Age Due to Poor Conditions in General\nContrary to the plaintiff’s allegations, the greater weight of the evidence does not establish\nthat residents of Conway Human Development Center die at an early age because of substandard\ncare.\nOver a two-year period, twenty-two residents of Conway Human Development Center died.\nThe average age of death at the Ce nter during those two years was 46.5 y ears.  Tr. 3772\n(E.  Mikkelsen).   Dr. M ikkelsen  testified  that  the  average  age  of deat h  at  Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center was lower than the average age of death at facilities in Massachusetts and\nConnecticut, from which he concluded that residents of Conway Human Development Center die\nat a young age due to substandard care.  Tr. 3917-18 (E. Mikkelsen).  Dr. Mikkelsen’s reasoning is\nflawed, however, because the Massachusetts and Connecticut facilities provide services only to an\nelderly population—the residents at those facilities were older than 46.5 years of age, so of course\ntheir average age of death is higher than 46.5.  In contrast, Dr. Kastner testified that the mortality rate\nat the facilities in Massachusetts and Connecticut was higher than the mortality rate in Conway\nHuman Development Center, which also would be expected because those facilities serve an older\npopulation.  Tr. 3980, 4096-97 (T. Kastner).  Thea fcilities in Massachusetts and Connecticut are not\ncomparable to Conway Human Development Center with respect to a critical risk factor for\ndeath—age—so these comparisons prove nothing.\nThe national mortality rate for intermediate care facilities is twenty-two per thousand per\nyear.  Tr. 3980, 4089, 4098 (T. Kastner).  Them  ortality rate at Conway Human Development Center\nis twenty-two per thousand per year.  Tr. 3980, 4089, 4098 (T. Kastner).  Thus, the mortality rate at\nConway Human Development Center coincides with the national average for intermediate care\n57\n\nfacilities.\nThe greater weight of the evidence fails to establish that residents of Conway Human\nDevelopment Center are exposed to conditions that cause early deaths.\n11. Conclusion  as  to  Whether  Conway  Human  Development  Center\nProvides a Reasonably Safe Environment\nFor all of the reasons that have been stated, the greater weight of the evidence establishes that\nConway Human Development Center does not depart from generally accepted practices in its efforts\nto keep residents safe and fr ee from undue restraint.  Conway  Human Development Center is a\nreasonably safe facility that does not use undue restraint.\nC.  FINDINGS  OF  FACT  REGARDING  ALLEGATIONS  THAT CONWAY\nHUMAN  DEVELOPMENT  CENTER  VIOLATES  THE IN TEGRATION\nMANDATE OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\nThe plaintiff’s second claim for relief alleges that Conway Human Development Center\nviolates the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the Center is not\nthe least restrictive, most integrated setting appropriate for its residents; fails to give adequate\ninformation to parents and g uardians about less restrictive alte rnatives; and fails to exercise\nprofessional judgment in making its determinations as to whether the Center is the least restrictive\nsetting for its residents.  The greater weight of the evidence does not support these allegations.\nAs mentioned above, Conway Human Development Center is certified by the Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid as an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, which means that\nit is funded throug h Medicaid.  Medicaid is a  program through which the federal government\nprovides financial assistance to states so that they can provide medical care to needy persons.29  In\n29 See Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 502, 110 S. Ct. 2510, 2513, 110 L. Ed. 2d\n455 (1990).\n58\n\norder to participate, a state must submit a plan that satisfies certain requirements of the Medicaid\nprogram.  However, the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services\nis authorized to waive those requirements so that states can create programs that provide Medicaid-\nfunded services to persons with long -term disabilities in noninstitutional settings.  42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396n(c).  Such programs are known as home and community based waiver programs, or simply\nwaiver programs.  If a state chooses to offer Medicaid-funded services through a waiver program,\nthe state must apply to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for a wai ver of the\nrequirements of the Medicaid program that otherwise would be imposed. \nArkansas has a Medicaid hom e and community based waiver program for persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities.  Persons who meet the disability requirements for admission to an\nintermediate care facility for the mentally retarded and the Medicaid income eligibility requirements\nmay qualify to participate in the waiver program.  Tr. 1412-15 (C. Cromer).  The waiver program\nprovides an alternative to institutionalization.  Defs.’ Ex. 410 at 2.  Waiver services in Arkansas\ninclude case management, supported employment, supported living, specialized medical supplies,\nadaptive equipment, community transition services, and other services.  Tr. 1415-18 (C. Cromer);\nDefs.’ Ex. 410 at 22-38.  Providers of waiver services in Arkansas are licensed by the Divison of\nDevelopmental Disability Services and are compensated according to a daily rate not to exceed $176\nper day for supportive living or $391.95 per day for persons who require the highest level of care.\nTr. 806 (J. Green); Tr. 1418, 1429-30 (C. Cromer).\nA state must apply for a certain number of “slots” when it applies for approval for a waiver\nprogram.  Tr. 750-52 (J. Green).  The number of “slots” is determined by the funds available to pay\nfor services.  Tr. 752 (J. Green).  Arkansas has4 083 “slots,” which means that it serves 4083 persons\n59\n\nthrough its waiver program.  Tr. 1426 (C. Cromer).  Although the plaintiff alleges that Arkansas\npromotes institutionalization of persons with developmental disabilities, the number of persons\nserved in the Arkansas waiver program is four times greater than the number of persons served in\nthe Arkansas human development centers.\nWhen a person contacts the Division of Developmental Disability Services to inquire about\nobtaining services, that person is given a choice of services form that permits the person to apply to\nreceive services from a human development center, through the waiver program, or both.  Tr. 1452\n(C. Cromer); Tr. 6776 (A. Green).  I f a person qualifies for services, that person is placed on a\nwaiting list.  Tr. 1452 (C. Cromer).  In 2007, approximately 700 persons were on a waiting list to\nobtain services in the Arkansas wai ver program.  Tr. 778-79 (J. Green).  As of April of 2010,\napproximately 1400 persons were on the waiting list.  Tr. 779 (J. Green).  At the time of trial, 1600\nor 1700 persons were on the waiting list for waiver services in Arkansas.  Tr. 779 (J. Green); Tr.\n1441 (C. Cromer).  Residents of a human development center who seek waiver services are given\npriority, which is to say that if the parent or guardian of a resident of a human development center\nseeks placement for the child or ward in waiver services, that resident will go to the top of the\nwaiting list for waiver services.30  Tr. 695 (A. Richardson); Tr. 780( J. Green); Tr. 4050 (T. Kastner);\nTr. 6784 (A. Green).\n30 The plaintiff places a sinister interpretation on the fact that residents of human\ndevelopment centers are given priority, contending that it encourages parents and guardians to\nadmit their children and wards to a human development center so as to attain priority on the\nwaiting list for waiver services, but there is no evidence that any parent or guardian has sought to\nhave a child or ward admitted to a human development center in order to receive priority on the\nwaiting list for waiver services.  Tr. 4310 (T. Kastner).\n60\n\n1. Allegations that Conway Human Development Center Is Not the Least\nRestrictive, Most Integrated Placement Alternative Appropriate for its\nResidents\nThe plaintiff alleges that residents of Conway Human Development Center are segregated\nin a restrictive environment where they are deprived of the opportunity to interact with nondisabled\npersons, whereas, according to the plaintiff, many, if not all of them, could be served in more\nintegrated settings.  Much of the presentation at trial discussed this issue in terms that presupposed\nthe  outcome:  the  alternatives  were  described  as  “institutionalization”  at  Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center or “community placement” through waiver services.  “Community placement”\nis a term that implies a more integrated, less restrictive setting than does the term “institution,” but\nit does not follow from the use of these terms that a resident automatically will have a greater degree\nof interaction in community placement, i.e., with a waiver provider, than in an institution such as\nConway Human Development Center.  The evidence establishes that residents of Conway Human\nDevelopment Center do interact with nondisabled persons—the Center is not a prison with inmates\nbarred from interaction with the  outside world; and conversely, the evidence establishes that\nplacement with a waiver provider does not guarantee any amount of interaction with nondisabled\npersons.\nResidents of Conway Human Development Center participate in activities outside of the\nfacility.  As of July 31, 2009, eleven residents worked at jobs off campus.  Tr. 534 (A. Richardson);\nTr. 6731 (B. Brewer); Pl.’s Ex. 229.  Some of  the residents attend summer progr ams at the\nUniversity of Central Arkansas .  Tr. 504 (S. Murphy ).  Many go off campus for recreational\nactivities.  Tr. 504 (S. Murphy).  Off-campus activities include, but are not limited to, going to the\nmovies, eating out, shopping, bowling, fishing, going to parks, going to the state fair, going to the\n61\n\nlibrary, attending athletic events at a local university, attending church, going on boy scout outings,\ngoing to pet therapy, and participating in the Special Olympics.  Tr. 5958-59 (K. Walsh); Tr. 6732\n(B. Brewer); Tr. 6828 (M. Black); Pl.’s Ex. 230.  During the first six months of 2009, residents of\nConway Human Development Center participated in 305 off-campus activities sponsored by the\nCenter.  Tr. 5958-59 (K. Walsh).\nIn addition to off-campus activities sponsored by the Center, residents of Conway Human\nDevelopment Center go off campus for visits with family and friends, sometimes during the day and\nsometimes overnight or over a weekend or so me other extended period of ti me.  Tr. 3232\n(E. Stoddard); Tr. 3284 (M. Catr on); Tr. 6828  (M. Black); Tr. 6844-45 (B . Landen).  These\ninteractions with persons off campus can be be neficial, enriching experiences for the Center’s\nresidents.  Tr. 3259 (E. Stoddard).  More importa ntly, these interactions render life at Conway\nHuman Development Center less restrictive and more integrated for residents.\nConway Human Development Center also  sponsors a panoply  of on-campus activities,\nincluding but not limited to arts and crafts, bi ngo, chapel, Connect Four, cookouts, gymnasium\nactivities, movies, miniature golf, and pizza parties.  Tr. 5959-60 (K. Walsh).  During the first\nquarter of 2009, there were 592o n-campus activities.  Tr. 5959 (K. Walsh).  Nondisabled volunteers\nalso come to Conway Human Development Center to visit and work with the residents.  Pl.’s Ex.\n1227.\nThe evidence does establish that many, if not all, of the residents of Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center could be served by organizations that provide services through the Arkansas\nhome and community based waiver program.  After reviewing approximately forty individual\nprogram plans of residents of Conway Human Development Center, the plaintiff’s expert Antoinette\n62\n\nRichardson testified that many of them could be considered for the possibility of placement with a\nprovider of waiver services.  Tr. 528 (A. Richardson).  Similarly, four officers of organizations that\nprovide waiver services in Arkansas reviewed approximately forty-six randomly selected individual\nprogram plans of residents of Conway Human Development Center and concluded that many, if not\nall, of them could be served through the waiver program.31  Tr. 868-99 (P. Bland); Tr. 1353-75 (C.\nAlberding); Tr. 1526-27 (K. Vire); Tr.1875-76 (J. Lambert).\nAlthough the defense attempted in some measure to discredit this testimony, that some and\nperhaps all of the residents of Conway Human Development Center could receive services through\nthe waiver program cannot seriously be denied.  Indeed, Calvin Price, the superintendent of Conway\nHuman Development Center, when asked how many of the residents of the Center could be served\nthrough the waiver program, testified, “Maybe they all could with the proper supports . . . .  I\npossibly think that a lot of our individuals could live in the community if they had the appropriate\nresources.”  Tr. 1714 (C. Price).  That m any, if not all, of the residents at Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center could be served by waiver providers does not, however, ipso facto establish that\na waiver provider is the appropriate placement for a specific resident or that the resident would have\na greater degree of interaction with nondisabled persons in the waiver program.\nRichardson testified that she toured a small intermediate care facility in Central Arkansas,\nas well as the Faulkner County Day School, Easter Seals in Little Rock, United Cerebral Palsy in\nLittle Rock, and Pathfinders in Jacksonville.  Tr. 576, 590-91 (A. Richardson).  She testified that\n31 Those four persons were Pamela Bland, Executive Director of First Step, Inc.; Cindy\nAlberding, Executive Director of Independent Case Management; Keith Vire, Ph.D., Chief\nExecutive Officer of Arkansas Support Network; and Jeff Lambert, Assistant Executive Director\nfor programs for Bost Incorporated. \n63\n\nsome of these providers could provdie services such as those needed by residents of Conway Human\nDevelopment Center.  Tr. 592 (A.  Richardson).  She did not, however, testify  that any of these\nplacement alternatives would be the appropriate placement for any specific resident of Conway\nHuman Development Center, nor d id she testify that any specific resident of Conway Human\nDevelopment Center would have a greater degree of interaction with nondisabled persons if that\nresident received services at the smaller intermediate care facility  for the mentally retarded or\nthrough one of the providers of waiver services.\nRichardson also visited a former resident of Conway Human Development Center who had\nbeen discharged and was living in an apartment with staffing and nursing help available.  Tr. 575 (A.\nRichardson).  The former resident required a lift to be transferred from a bed to a chair, as well as\nspecial arrangements for bathing and assistance with eating, dressing, and other such necessities of\ndaily life.  Tr. 575 (A. Richardson.)  Richardson’s testimony did not compare the extent to which the\nformer resident interacted with nondisabled persons while living alone in an apartment with the\nextent to which she interacted with nondisabled persons while living at the Center, nor is it obvious\nthat this former resident interacts with nondisabled persons to a greater degree while living alone in\nan apartment than she did while living at Conway Human Development Center.\nRichardson admitted that “some people can be in a fairly restrictive setting even in a\ncommunity placement.”  Tr. 693 (A. Richardson).  She also admitted that some people have left\nresidential facilities, lived alone in an apartment, and never integrated at all into the community.  Tr.\n693 (A. Richardson).  Richardson acknowledged that each resident should be studied individually\nin order to determine whether that resident should be placed with a provider of waiver services, and\nshe admitted that she had not performed that type of study.  Tr. 700, 708 (A. Richardson).  Thus, just\n64\n\nas it is an error to assume that because Conway Human Development Center is an institution its\nresidents have no interac tion with nondisabled persons, so too is it an error to assu me that a\ncommunity placement ipso facto precludes the possibility of isolation or automatically provides more\ninteraction with nondisabled persons than an institutional setting.\nThe testimony of some of the parents of  Conway Human Development Center residents\nhighlights the importance of making  an individualized determination regarding the appropriate\nplacement for a developmentally disabled person.  The testimony of the parents also makes clear that\nit is a mistake to assume that every disabled person would have more interaction with nondisabled\npersons through the waiver program than at Conway Human Development Center.\nAlan Fortney, speaking of his stepdaughter who resides at Conway Human Development\nCenter, testified:\nShe likes a lot of people interaction . . . a lot of people say community programs,\nliving on your own and all this kind of stuffi s the way to go.  It would drive her nuts\nto live either by herself or [with only] one or two people.  She likes a lot of people\nand a lot of interaction.  While we were on this waiver program list, we even\nconsidered HUD housing and we came to the realization . . . that would drive her\nnuts.  She would not be able to handle that.\nTr. 1501-02 (A. Fortney).  It is apparent that the Fortneys have carefully considered the needs of their\ndaughter and have concluded that Conway Human Development Center is the most appropriate place\nfor her.  They  have also conc luded, based on their daug hter’s individual characteristics, that\nplacement with a waiver provider would not provide their daughter a greater degree of interaction\nwith nondisabled peers. \nAnother parent, Melissa Catron, testified that her son lived at home and attended public\nschool or a community school until he was fifteen, but “[h]e never was integrated into a regular\nclassroom, except for . . . assemblies or things like that.  He didn’t tolerate being around normal\n65\n\nchildren.”  Tr. 3263 (M. Catron).  As he got older, his behavior problems got worse.  Tr. 3263-64\n(M. Catron).  His violent outbursts eventually reached the point that the Catrons could no longer\nkeep him at home.  Tr. 3268-69 (M. Catron).  Afters everal years in the waiver program, the Catrons\nplaced their son at Conway Human Development Center, and they have found that he does better\nwith other disabled children than with nondisabled children.32  Tr. 3264-65, 3268-69 (M. Catron).\nCatron also testified that Conway Human Development Center is the appropriate placement for her\nson, rather than placement with a waiver provider, in part because\nhe doesn’t travel well.  The fact that all of his classrooms are right there close to\nwhere he is, his doctors are right there where he is, the dentist, everything he needs\nis right there, he handles that transition much better that way than he would in the\ncommunity.  From experience, I just really don’t think that that would be . . . the best\noption for him.\nTr. 3270 (M. Catron).  Thus, the Catrons have determined based on their knowledge of their child\nthat Conway Human Development Center is the appropriate placement for him rather than sending\nhim back to a waiver provider.\nEarline Stoddard made the pointc oncisely when asked on cross-examination whether she had\nfound some providers in the community that were not good: “Not where I’d want my son to be.\nMight be all right for someone else’s child, but not for mine.”  Tr. 3255 (E. Stoddard). \nAs Angela Green of Conway Human Development Center testified, “[E]ach person is [an]\nindividual.  They have individual needs, they have their own preferences.”  Tr. 6764 (A. Green).\nAny decision regarding the least restrictive placement appropriate for a developmentally disabled\n32 Catron’s experience is not unique.  As Price testified, many of the residents of Conway\nHuman Development Center previously received services through a waiver provider but were\nreferred to Conway Human Development Center as a more appropriate placement.  Tr. 1714-15\n(C. Price); see also Tr. 5607-08 (B. Gale).\n66\n\nperson must be based on that person’s individual needs and individual preferences, as demonstrated\nby the testimony of the parents, Angela Green, and others.\nNo evidence was presented that Conway Human Development Center has refused t o\ndischarge a resident upon request by the parent or guardian or refused to assist in a placement with\na provider of waiver services.  If a parent or guardian of a resident of the Center requests placement\nwith a provider of waiver services, staff will attempt to find one. T r. 618 (A. Richardson).  Residents\nwho seek discharge from the Center are discharged without significant delay.  Tr. 4049 (T. Kastner).\nFrom June of 2007 to July of 2009, eighteen residents were discharged.  Seven of those residents\nwere discharged to another hum an development center.  Six were discharged to the care of\norganizations that provide waiver services.  Five were discharged to their homes.  Pl.’s Ex. 271.  In\nthe two years before trial, eight persons were discharged to waiver services.  Tr. 6789-91 (A.G  reen).\nConway Human Development Center does not have a waiting list of residents seeking discharge.\nTr. 4049, 4331 (T. Kastner).\nThat residents of Conway Human Development Center could be served by organizations that\nprovide waiver services does not  establish that the residents would have a g reater degree of\ninteraction with nondisabled persons if they received services from a waiver provider, nor does it\nestablish that services offered by the waiver provider are the appropriate services for any specific\nresident.  The plaintiff offered no evidence that any specific placement with a provider of waiver\nservices was the appropriate placement for any specific resident of Conway Human Development\nCenter, nor did the plaintiff offer any evidence that any specific resident would have a greater degree\nof interaction with nondisabled persons if that resident were placed in a particular program of a\nwaiver services provider.  The plaintiff failed to prove that Conway Human Development Center is\n67\n\nnot the least restrictive, most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of any specific resident.\n2. Allegations that Conway Human Development Center Fails to Give\nAdequate Information to Parents and Guardians Regarding Waiver\nServices\nThe plaintiff alleges that Conway Human Development Center does not provide parents and\nguardians with adequate information regarding waiver services, but the evidence proves that it does.\nBefore each annual interdisciplinary team meeting, Conway Human Development Center\nsends to the parent or guardian a brochure explaining services available through Arkansas’s waiver\nprogram, a list of the providers of  waiver services in the State of Arkansas, and a list of waiver\nproviders in the county where the resident’s family lives.  Tr. 501-02, 4898-99 (S. Murphy); Tr. 3244\n(E. Stoddard); Tr. 6776 (A. Green).  The per county information describes the services provided by\neach provider and includes the locations of those services as well as contact information for those\nservices.  Tr. 4899 (S. Murphy); Tr. 6776-77 (A. Green).  Conway Human Development Center also\nsends each parent or guardian a choice of services form on which the parent or guardian can choose\nwhether to receive services through the waiver program or from the  Center.  Tr. 847, 6777-78\n(A. Green); Pl.’s Ex. 294; Defs.’ Ex. 406.\nAt the resident’s annual interdisciplinary team meeting, staff of the Center discuss whether\nthe Center is the least restrictive, most integrated placement appropriate for serving the needs of the\nresident.  Tr. 6728-29 (B. Brewer).  As a part of that discussion, staff members ask the parent or\nguardian if he or she has received the brochure describing the waiver program and the list of waiver\nproviders.  Staff members also ask the parent or guardian if he or she is interested in pursuing waiver\nservices.  Tr. 502, 4899 (S. Murphy); Tr. 1476 (B. Brewer).  Members of the staff at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center provide a parent or guardian information to see whether the parent or guardian\n68\n\nis interested in waiver services.  Tr. 3244 (E. Stoddard).\nMembers of the staff at Conway Human Development Center take steps beyond the annual\ninterdisciplinary team meeting to ensure that parents and guardians are informed.  Whenever the\nCenter becomes aware that a waiver provider has an opening in a location near the family of one of\nits residents, the Center notifies the family of that opening.  Tr. 529, 556 (A. Richardson); Tr. 840\n(A. Green); Pl.’s Ex. 264. In the spring of 2010, the Center invited all of the waiver providers in the\nState of Arkansas to the campus during a meeting of Friends and Families of Care Facilities\nResidents, the statewide parent organization, so that the waiver providers could make information\nabout their services available to parents and guardians.  Tr. 841, 6777 (A. Green); Tr. 923 (P. Bland);\nTr. 1338 (C. Alberding); Tr. 5065-66 (L. Taylor).\nParents and guardians also learn about alternative services through the two parent association\ngroups and through social workers in their counties.  Tr. 853 (A. Green).  Many of the parents and\nguardians have looked into alte rnative services before or during placement at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center.  Tr. 853 (A. Green); Tr . 3239, 3243, 3245 (E. Stoddard).  They  are well-\ninformed as to the availability of waiver service.  Tr. 4050-51 (T. Kastner).  Parents and guardians\nof residents of Conway  Human Development Center make informed decisions as to whether\nresidents should be treated at the Center or discharged to an alternative placement.  Tr. 853\n(A. Green); Tr. 4008 (T. Kastner).\nConway Human Development Center does not prevent any  resident from moving to an\nalternative placement. The Center adequately informs parents and guardians of the nature and scope\nof the home and community based waiver program in Arkansas, and it provides the parents and\nguardians with a comprehensive list ofw  aiver providers, including contact information.  The greater\n69\n\nweight of the evidence establishes that Conway Human Development Center provides adequate\ninformation to parents and g uardians to enable them to make informed decisions regarding\nplacement.\n3. Allegations that the Staff Members at Conway Human Development\nCenter Fail to Exercise Professional Judgment in Determinations as to\nthe Least Restrictive Placement Alternative\nFinally, the greater weight of the evidence establishes that staff members at Conway Human\nDevelopment Center make professional judgments in determining the least restrictive placement\nappropriate for each resident.  The members of the interdisciplinary teams, including the parents and\nguardians, typically agree that Conway Human Development Center is the least restrictive placement\nalternative appropriate for serving the needs of the residents.  Tr. 482, 497 (S. Murphy); Tr. 837 (A.\nGreen); Tr. 1464 (L. Brewer); Tr. 6729-30 (B. Brewer).  Although the professionals often do not\nrecommend placement with a waiver provider unless requested to do so by the parents or guardians,\nTr. 402 (J. Weaver); Tr. 547 (A. Richardson); Tr. 836-37 (A. Green), they frequently encourage\nguardians to consider placement with waiver  providers, Tr. 6785 (A. Green), and they  have\nrecommended placement with a waiver provider without a prior request from a parent or guardian,\nTr. 4896-97 (S. Murphy); Tr. 6729 (B. Brewer).  O n at least two occasions, professionals at the\nCenter have recommended community placement when the parent or guardian disagreed.  Tr. 855\n(A. Green). The professi onals exercise professional judgment in determining whether Conway\nHuman Development Center is the least restrictive, most integrated placement alternative appropriate\nto serve its residents’ needs.  Tr. 4007-08, 4041, 4086-88, 4329, 4403 (T. Kastner); Tr. 5999-6001\n(K. Walsh).\n70\n\nD.  ALLEGATIONS THAT CONWAY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT CENTER\nVIOLATES THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT\nThe plaintiff’s third claim for relief is for alleged violations of the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act, which requires certain institutions to provide a free appropriate public\neducation in the least restrictive setting appropriate to school-aged children with disabilities. A  t the\ntime of trial, Conway Human Development Center had forty-eight school-aged residents and a total\nof fifty-three children in its special education classes.33  Tr. 5096 (D. Nye).\nThe parties presented conflicting expert testimony on the issue of whether Conway Human\nDevelopment Center complies with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  The plaintiff\ncalled as an expert witness Susan Thibadeau, Ph.D., while the defendants called Derek Nye, Ph.D.,\nand Bruce Gale, Ph.D.  All three were qualified as experts and all three testified credibly.\nDr. Thibadeau’s ultimate conclusion was that Conway Human Development Center did not\nmeet its obligation under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to provide each child with\na free appropriate public education.  Tr. 2176 (S. Thibadeau).  She testified that many of the children\nwere receiving only ninety minutes per day of special education services, or 450 minutes per week,\nwhich she believed was inadequate.  Tr. 2176, 2187 (S. Thibadeau).  Althoug h the students,\naccording to Dr. Thibadeau, nominally  spent more than six hours per day in special education\nservices, much of that time was actually spent in habilitation classes that were neither taught nor\nsupervised by special education teachers.  Tr. 2193, 2221-22 (S . Thibadeau).  F urthermore,\nDr. Thibadeau did not believe that the special education teachers at Conway Human Development\nCenter received adequate supervision  or sufficient ongoing training.  Tr. 2182-83,  2336-40\n33 Five of the children were at Conway Human Development Center on respite, or short-\nterm, status and were not actually residents of the Center.  Tr. 5096 (D. Nye). \n71\n\n(S. Thibadeau).\nDr. Thibadeau also testified that Conway Human Development Center did not educate\nchildren in the least restrictive environment, as required by the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act.  She testified that several of the children had mild cognitive disabilities and came to\nConway Human Development Center because of behavioral problems, but with the improvement\nof the behavioral problems at the Center, she believed that those children could transition to a less\nrestrictive environment.  Tr. 2181, 2304-13 (S. Thibadeau).\nIn  addition,  Dr.  Thibadeau  criticized  the  assessment  test  used  at  Conway  Human\nDevelopment Center and the quality of the individualized education plans, including the transition\nplans.  Tr. 2177, 2818-82, 2222-40 (S. Thibadeau).  Asa  part of her criticism of thet ransition plans,\nDr. Thibadeau testified that there was no i ndication that adult service agencies participated in\ntransition planning.  Tr. 2299 (S . Thibadeau).  Dr. Thibadeau also “had concerns” about the\n“integration of different therapies,” saying that the psychological examiners did not spend enough\ntime in the classrooms.  Tr. 2180 (S. Thibadeau).  She also “had some concerns” about the students’\n“quality of life,” referring specifically to the fact that nineteen of the forty-five children whose\nrecords she reviewed were not toilet trained and several were eating chopped or pureed food instead\nof being taught to eat more slowly.  Tr. 2180-81 (S. Thibadeau).\nNeedless to say, the experts for the defendants disagreed with Dr. Thibadeau’s conclusions.\nTheir ultimate conclusion was that Conway Human Development Center complied with the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act and specifically that it provided a free appropriate public\neducation.  Tr. 5097 (D. Nye); Tr. 5585, 5659, 5690 (B. Gale).  Contrary to Dr. Thibadeau, they\ntestified that the amount of time spent in special education classes each day was adequate to comply\n72\n\nwith the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  Tr. 5100-01, 5152-53\n(D. Nye); Tr. 5551-53 (B. Gale).  They disagreed that the assessment tool used by the Center was\ninappropriate.  Tr. 5156-57 (D. Nye); Tr. 5587 (B. Gale).  Dr. Nye testified that Conway Human\nDevelopment Center is the least restrictive environment for the children there.34  Tr. 5155 (D. Nye).\nThe Arkansas Department of Education is charged with monitoring schools in Arkansas and\nenforcing  compliance  with the   Individuals  with  Disabilities  Education  Act.   In  January  of\n2010—after Dr. Thibadeau had comp leted her report—the Arkansas  Department of Education\nofficially investigated Conway Human Development Center for compliance with that Act.  The\nArkansas Department of Education issued its official report on June 16, 2010, in the form of a letter\nto Calvin Price, Superintendent of the Center.  Tr. 2988 (M. Harding); Pl.’s Ex. 1104.  The report\nfound that Conway Human Development Center wa s in substantial compliance with the least\nrestrictive environment requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, as well as\nsome  of the other significant requirements of the Act, but that there were fifteen areas  of\nnoncompliance.  Pl.’s Ex. 1104.\nSeveral of the areas of noncompliance involved procedural or technical requirements that\nreadily can be remedied.  Tr. 5167 (D. Nye).  For example, Conway Human Development Center\nwas found not to be in compliancew ith the requirement that evaluation procedures be completeda nd\na written report submitted to the Arknasas Department of Educationw  ithin sixty days from receiving\nformal consent from a parent org uardian.  Pl.’s Ex. 1104 at 1; Tr. 2995 (M.H  arding).  Another area\nof noncompliance related to the fact that in its evaluations the Center used categories applicable to\nthe Medicaid program rather than categories applicable to the Individuals with Disabilities Education\n34 Dr. Gale was not called as an expert on the least restrictive environment issue.\n73\n\nAct.  An example of this type of noncompliance given at trial was that the Center would classify a\nchild as having cerebral palsy, whereas the proper category for special education purposes would be\n“health impaired” or “multiply disabled.”  Tr. 2996 (M. Harding).\nNot all of the criticisms by the Arkansas Department of Education are merely technical.\nFirst, the Arkansas Department  of Education found that the individualiz ed education plans at\nConway Human Development Center did not suffi ciently take into account sp ecial factors that\nimpede a child’s learning, such as maladaptive behaviors, lack of English proficiency, impaired\nvision or hearing, and the like; did not adequately address the unique needs of each child; and did\nnot adequately plan for children’s transition after secondary school.  Pl.’s Ex. 1104 at 2; Tr. 3000-05\n(M. Harding).  In regard to transition planning, it appeared that representatives of other agencies\nwere not invited to meetings to discuss post-secondary goals and transition services.  Tr. 2990-92\n(M. Harding); Pl.’s Ex. 1104.  Second, the Arkansas Department of Education found that Conway\nHuman Development Center failed to provide a free appropriate public education because it failed\nto meet the required ratio of teachers to pupils .  Tr. 3009-10 (M. Harding).  For students whose\nprimary program is special education, the teacher to pupil ratio should be one to fifteen, one to ten,\nor one to six, depending on how much time, attention, and related services each child needs.  Tr.\n3010 (M. Harding).  Although the record is not as explicit on this point as the Court would like, it\nappears that for most of the children at Conway Human Development Center the requirement is no\nmore than six pupils to every one teacher; the Center had more than six pupils per teacher.  Third,\nthe Arkansas Department of Education found that Conway Human Development Center was not\nproviding a free appropriate public education because children did not spend sufficient time in\nschool receiving special education services.  The Arkansas Department of Education seemed to agree\n74\n\nwith Dr. Thibadeau that many of the children at Conway Human Development Center were receiving\nonly ninety minutes per day of special education.  Tr. 3012-14 (M. Harding); Pl.’s Ex. 1210.  Fourth,\nthe Arkansas Department of Education found that Conway Human Development Center failed to\nprovide a free appropriate public education because it failed to  adopt “promising educational\npractices proven effective through research and demonstration for the provision of special education\ninstruction.”  Tr. 3015 (M. Harding); Pl.’s Ex. 1104 at 15.  As explained at trial, this finding means\nthat teachers at Conway Human Development Center were not acquainted with some of the more\ncurrent types of strategies, interventions, and programs that can be effective with children like those\nserved at the Center, and no system was in place to keep teachers current.  Tr. 3017 (M. Harding).\nIn short, the Arkansas Department of Education found that Conway Human Development\nCenter did not adequately plan special education for each child, did not provide the children with\nadequate time in special education classes, did not provide an adequate number of teachers, and did\nnot provide for continuing education adequate to enable the teachers to do their job well.\nAs noted above, the monitoring by the Arkansas Department of Education was conducted\nafter Dr. Thibadeau had submitted her report, and the persons who conducted the monitoring\nreviewed Dr. Thibadeau’s report.  Tr. 3033 (M. Harding).  It is apparent that the monitors from the\nArkansas Department of Education examined the program at Conway Human Development Center\nwith a view toward determining whether the criticisms made by Dr. Thibadeau were accurate or not,\nand they did so using a process that was systematic and impartial.  Tr. 3026-33 (M. Harding).  They\nconfirmed many but not all of Dr. Thibadeau’s criticisms.  After considering all of the evidence, the\nCourt is persuaded that the findings of the Arkansas Department of Education are true.  The finding\nthat Conway Human Development Center educates children in the least restrictive environment is\n75\n\nsupported not only by the testimony of Dr. Nye but also by the determination of each child’s\nindividual education plan team—a team that consists of the persons who are best situated to make\nthat decision regarding that child.  The findings that Conway Human Development Center has failed\nto provide adequate plans and has failed to includeo ther agencies in transition planning is supported\nby the testimony of Dr. Thibadeau.  The finding that children spend too little time in special\neducation classes is supported by the testimony of Dr. Thibadeau.  The finding that teachers are not\ngiven appropriate continuing education is supported by the testimony of Dr. Thibadeau.  Finally, as\nto the finding that the teacher to pupil ratio was inadequate, it is within the province of the Arkansas\nDepartment of Education to set a standard for the teacher to pupil ratio inasmuch as one element of\nthe definition of “free appropriate  public education” is c ompliance with standards of the state\neducational agency.  20 U.S.C. § 1401(9).  The greater weight of the evidence supports the findings\nof the Arkansas Department of Education, as described above, so those findings are adopted as the\nfindings of this Court.\nIn response to the letter of noncompliance,  Conway Human Development Center was\nrequired to submit a corrective action plan.  The process of submitting the corrective action plan had\nbegun before trial, Tr. 3037 (M.H  arding), but was continuing at the time of trial.  Tr. 6503 (.J Buck);\nTr. 6881 (C. Price); Defs.’ Ex. JB-2.  At the time of trial, the Center had added special education\ninstruction  times and dev eloped  new  pupil  schedules.   Tr. 2117-18 (S. Milum); Tr. 3047\n(M. Harding).  Additional special education t eachers had been hired.  Tr. 3047  (M. Harding).\nConway Human Development Center was in the process of hiring additional staff.  Defs.’ Ex. JB-2\nat 4.  The Center was also changing its professional development policies to bring them into\ncompliance.  Defs.’ Ex. JB-2 at 4.\n76\n\nWhen the trial concluded and the record closed, the Arkansas Department of Education had\nnot yet determined whether the corrective action taken by Conway Human Development Center\nwould be sufficient to bring  the Center’s speci al education program into compliance with the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act.  The process was ongoing and was not scheduled to be\ncompleted until sometime after trial.  Nonetheless, the evidence was sufficient to show that the\nArkansas Department of Education will ensure that the appropriate corrective action is taken to bring\nthe Center’s special education program into compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities\nEducation Act.  Although the monitors from the Arkansas Department of Education did not review\nthe file of every child at Conway Human Development Center, in the corrective action process, the\nCenter will be required to review the programs for all similarly situated children and correct them.\nTr. 3051 (M. Harding).  As Marcia Harding testified, “[W]e set out corrective actions, and we go in\nand assure that it gets corrected.”  Tr. 3034 (M. Harding).  The Court believes her.\nII.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nA. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING THE PLAINTIFF’S STANDING\nThe Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act authorizes the Attorney General to institute\na civil action in the name of the United States to obtain “such equitable relief as may be appropriate\nto insure the minimum corrective measures necessary” to guarantee that institutionalized persons are\nnot deprived of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United\nStates.  42 U.S.C. § 1997a(a) (2006).  Conway  Human Development Center is  an institution as\ndefined in the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act.  42 U.S.C. § 1997.  The United States\nhas standing to bring this action.\n77\n\nB. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING THE PLAINTIFF’S FOURTEENTH\nAMENDMENT CLAIMS\nThe Supreme Court has held that when a menatlly retarded person is involuntarily committed\nto a state  institution, the state has certaino bligations under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Youngberg\nv. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S. Ct. 2452 , 73 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1982).35  According to Youngberg, a\nmentally retarded person involuntarily committed to a state institution has the rig ht to minimally\nadequate or reasonable training to ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint.  Id. at 319, 102\nS. Ct. at 2460.  The Court recognized:\nYet these interests [in safety and freedom from restraint] are not absolute; indeed, to\nsome extent they are in conflict.  In operating an institution such as [the one at issue\nin Youngberg], there are occasions in which it is necessary for the State to restrain\nthe movement of residents –  for example, to protect them as well as others from\nviolence.  Similar restraints may also be appropriate in a training program.  And an\ninstitution cannot protect its residents from all danger of violence if it is to permit\nthem to have any freedom of movement.  The question then is not simply whether a\nliberty interest has been infringed but whether the extent or nature of the restraint or\nlack of absolute safety is such as to violate due process.\nId. at 319-20, 102 S. Ct. at 2460.  Determining whether the rights of a mentally retarded person in\na state institution have been violated requires “that the courts make certain that professional\njudgment in fact was exercised.  It is not appropriate for the courts to specify which of several\nprofessionally acceptable choices should have been made.”   Id. at 321, 102 S. Ct.  at 2461.  A\nmentally retarded person in a state institution is entitled to “minimally adequate training,” defined\nas “such training as may be reasonable in light of [the individual’s] liberty interests in safety and\n35 The parties agree that Youngberg applies in this case, so the Court need not and will not\naddress the issue of whether Youngberg is inapplicable because some or all of the residents of\nConway Human Development Center are there voluntarily.  Cf. DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty.\nDep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 109 S. Ct. 998, 103 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1989); Dorothy J. v. Little\nRock Sch. Dist., 7 F.3d 729 (8th Cir. 1993).\n78\n\nfreedom from unreasonable restraints.” I d. at 322, 102 S. Ct. at 2461.  Courts “must showde ference\nto the judgment exercised by a qualified professional.”  Id.  The decision by a professional “is\npresumptively valid; liability may be imposed only when the decision by the professional is such a\nsubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate\nthat the person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.”  Id. at 323, 102\nS. Ct. at 2462.\nApplying the Youngberg standards to this case, the Court concludes that Conway Human\nDevelopment Center does not violate the mandates of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Conway Human\nDevelopment Center provides minimally adequate training and protects the safety and freedom of\nits residents in a manner consistent with the standards of Youngberg.  The professionals at Conway\nHuman Development Center exercise professional judgment.  Even if the professional judgment of\nsome or all of the plaintiff’s experts were better than the professional judgment of some or all of the\nprofessionals at Conway Human Development Center, the evidence does not prove that decisions\nof the latter represent such a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice,\nor standards as to demonstrate that professiona l judgment was not actually exercised.  Conway\nHuman Development Center is in compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution\nof the United States.\nC. CONCLUSIONS  OF  LAW  REGARDING  THE  AMERICANS  WITH\nDISABILITIES ACT\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act provides, in pertinent part:\nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified individual with a disability\nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the\nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subject to\ndiscrimination by any such entity.\n79\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132.  This prohibition on discrimination \nmay require placement of persons  with developmental disabilities in community\nsettings rather than in institutions when . . . the State’s treatment professionals have\ndetermined that community placement is appropriate, the transfer from institutional\ncare to a less restrictive setting is not opposed by the affected individual, and the\nplacement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account resources available\nto the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.\nOlmstead v. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 587, 119 S. Ct. 2176, 2181, 144L . Ed. 2d 540 (1999).  A public\nentity must administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate\nto the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.  Id. at 591-92, 119 S. Ct. at 2183; 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.130(d) (2010).  The most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of a qualified individual\nwith a disability is a setting that enables the individual with a disability to interact with nondisabled\npersons to the fullest extent possible.  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 592, 119 S. Ct. at 2183; 28 C.F .R.\npt. 35, app. B (Mar. 15, 2011). T  he Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination against\nqualified individuals, i.e., persons with disabilities who “with or without reasonable modifications\nto rules, policies, or practices, . . . mee[ t] the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of\nservices or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.”  Olmstead, 527\nU.S. at 602, 119 S. Ct. at 2188 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2)).  A state generally may rely on the\nreasonable assessments of its own professionals in determining whether an individual meets the\nessential eligibility requirements for habilitation in a community based program.  Id.  There is no\nrequirement that community based treatment be imposed on persons who do not desirei t.  Olmstead,\n527 U.S. at 602, 119 S. Ct. at 2188; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(e)(1).  \nThe plaintiff failed to prove that Conway Human Development Center is in violation of the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act.  The plaintiff failed to prove that Conway Human Development\nCenter is not the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of any specific resident.  The\n80\n\nplaintiff failed to prove that any alternative placement would enable any specific resident of Conway\nHuman Development Center to in teract with nondisabled persons  to a g reater extent.  The\nprofessionals at Conway Human Development Center exercise reasonable professional judgment in\nmaking recommendations for placement of the residents there.  No person determined by the State’s\ntreatment professionals to be appropriate for community placement has been denied community\nplacement.  The parents and guardians of the residents at Conway Human Development Center make\ninformed judgments regarding placement.  No resident of Conway Human Development Center has\nbeen denied community placement when a parent or guardian has requested such a placement.\nConway Human Development Center is not discriminating against persons with disabilities.\nIt is not violating the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nD. CONCLUSIONS  OF  LAW  REGARDING  THE  INDIVIDUALS  WITH\nDISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT\nThe special education program at Conway Human Development Center is subject to the\nrequirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400  et seq.  The\nchildren at Conway Human Development Center are children with disabilities as defined in\n20 U.S.C. § 1401(3).  Conway Human Development Center is required to provide each child with\na free appropriate public education.  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1) (2006).\nThe term “free appropriate public education” means special education and related\nservices that --\n(A) have been provided at public ex pense, under public supervision and\ndirection, and without charge;\n(B) meet the standards of the State educational agency;\n(C) include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school\neducation in the State involved; and\n(D) are provided in conformity with the individualized education program\nrequired under section 1414(d) of this title.\n20 U.S.C. § 1401(9).  Conway Human Development Center also has an obligation to educate the\n81\n\nchildren in the least restrictive environment.  Congress has defined that obligation as follows:\nTo the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in\npublic or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who\nare not disabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children\nwith disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the\nnature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes\nwith the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A).  To the extent appropriate, with consent of the parents, Conway Human\nDevelopment Center must invite the agency that likely will be responsible for providing transition\nservices to the individual education plan meeting when a purpose of the meeting will be to consider\npost-secondary goals and transition services.  34 C.F.R. § 300.321(b)(3) (2007).\nConway Human Development Center educates children in the least restrictive environment,\nbut it has failed to provide children with a free  appropriate public education, and it has failed to\ninvite agencies that provide transition services to the meetings at which post-secondary goals and\ntransition services are discussed.\nHaving concluded that Conway Human Development Center has failed to comply fully with\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the issue is whether to enter an injunction. An\ninjunction is an equitable remedy that does not issue as a matter of course.  Weinberger v. Romero-\nBarcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 311, 102 S. Ct. 1798, 1803, 72 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1982); see also Salazar v.\nBuono, __ U.S. __, 130 S. Ct. 1803, 1816, 176 L. Ed. 2d 634 (2010).  An injunction should issue\nonly when legal remedies are inadequate and irreparable injury will occur without the injunction.\nRomero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. at 312, 102 S. Ct. at 1803.  A court should be especially cautious when\ncontemplating relief that implicates public interests.  Salazar v. Buono, 130 S. Ct. at 1816.  I n\ndetermining whether to exercise the Court’s equitable discretion to enter an injunction in a case such\nas this one, where Cong ress has provided a reg ulatory scheme, the Court should consider the\n82\n\nregulatory scheme at issue and the enforcement mechanisms provided therein.\n[C]ourt and agency are not to be  regarded as wholly independent and unrelated\ninstrumentalities of justice, each acting in the performance of its prescribed statutory\nduty without regard to the appropriate function of the other in securing the plainly\nindicated objects of the statute.  Court and agency are the means adopted to attaint he\nprescribed end, and so far as hteir duties are defined by the words of the statute,t hose\nwords should be construed so as to atta in that end throug h co-ordinated action.\nNeither body should repeat in this day the mistake made by the courts of law when\nequity was struggling for recognition as an ameliorating system of justice; neither can\nrightly be regarded by the other as an alien intruder, to be tolerated if it must be, but\nnever to be encouraged or aided by the other in the attainment of the common aim.\nHecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 330-31, 64 S. Ct. 587, 5928, 8 L. Ed. 754 (1944) (quoting United\nStates v. Morgan, 307 U.S. 183, 191, 59 S. Ct. 795, 799, 83 L. Ed. 1211 (1939)).\nThe  Individuals  with Disab ilities  Education  Act  imposes  a  duty  for  monitoring  and\nsupervising compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act on a state educational\nagency to be selected by the state:\n(11) State educational agency responsible for general supervision\n(A) In general\nThe State educational agency is responsible for ensuring that– \n(i) the requirements of this subchapter are met;\n(ii) all educational programs for children with disabilities in the State,\nincluding all such programs administered by any other State agency\nor local agency --\n   (I) are under the g eneral supervision of individuals in the\nState  who  are  responsible  for  educational  programs  for\nchildren with disabilities; and\n(II) meet the educational standards of the State educational\nagency[.]\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(11)(A).\nAs section 1412(a)(11)(A) makes clear, the staet agency’s responsibility to supervise special\neducation programs includes not only a duty to monitor but also to enforce.  Section 1416(a)(1)(C)\nprovides that the Secretary of Education must “require States to-- (i) monitor implementation of this\n83\n\nsubchapter by local educational agencies; and (ii) enforce this subchapter in accordance with\nparagraph (3) and subsection (e).”  Paragraph (3) provides:\n(3) Monitoring priorities\nThe Secretary shall monitor the States, and shall require each State to monitor the\nlocal educational agencies located in the State (except the State exercise of general\nsupervisory responsibility), using quantifiable indicators in each of the following\npriority areas, and using such qualitative indicators as are needed to adequately\nmeasure performance in the following priority areas:\n(A) Provision of a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive\nenvironment.\n(B) State exercise of general supervisory authority, including child find,\neffective monitoring, the use of resolution sessions, mediation, voluntary\nbinding arbitration, and a system of transition services as defined in sections\n1401(34) and 1437(a)(9) of this title.\n(C) Disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special\neducation and related services, to the extent the representation is the result of\ninappropriate identification.\nIn Arkansas, the state educational agency responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with\nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is the Arkansas Department of Education.\nAs stated above, the Arkansas Department  of Education has requ ired Conway Human\nDevelopment Center to submit a corrective action plan for bringing its special education program\ninto compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  The Arkansas Department of\nEducation will evaluate and determine whether the corrective action plan is appropriate and will\nensure that the special education program at Conway Human Development Center complies with the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act.  Therefore, it is not necessary for this Court to enter an\ninjunction in order to secure the rights guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\nto students at Conway Human Development Center.\n84\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court finds and concludes that Conway Human Development Center complies with all\nof the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Americans with Disabilities Act but not\nall of the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  Because Congress has\nprovided for a st ate educational agency to enforce compliance with that Act, and because the\nevidence established that the state educational agency here is enforcing and will enforce compliance,\nno injunction is necessary or appropriate.\nA judgment dismissing this action with prejudice will be entered separately.\nIT IS SO ORDERED this 8th day of June, 2011.\n                                                                      \nJ.

      "text": "U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division \nOffice of the Assistant Attorney General  Washington, D.C. 20035 \nAPR  2 1  2004 \nThe  Honorable  Mike  Huckabee \nGovernor  of  Arkansas \nState  Capitol \nLittle  Rock,  Arkansas  72201 \nRe:  CRIPA  Investigation  of  the  Conway  Human  Development \nCenter,  Conway,  Arkansas \nDear  Governor  Huckabee: \nI  am  writing  to  report  the  findings  of  the  Civil  Rights \nDivision's  investigation of  conditions  at  the  Conway  Human \nDevelopment  Center  (\"Conway\"),  in  Conway,  Arkansas.  On \nNovember  8,  2002,  we  notified you  of  our  intent  to  conduct  an \ninvestigation of  Conway  pursuant  to  the  Civil  Rights  of \nInstitutionalized  Persons  Act  (\"CRIPA\"),  42  U.S.C.  §  1997.  As  we \nnoted,  CRIPA  gives  the  Department  of  Justice  authority  to  seek \nrelief  on  behalf  of  public  institution residents  who  have  been \nsubjected  to  a  pattern or practice  of  egregious  or  flagrant \nconditions  in violation of  the  Constitution or  federal  law. \nAt  various  points  in  February,  April,  and  May  of  2003,  we \nconducted  on-site  inspections  of  Conway  with  expert  consultants  in \npsychiatry,  psychology,  general  medical  care,  nursing,  nutritional \nand  physical  management,  protection  from  harm,  community \nplacement,  and  special  education.  Before,  during,  and  after our \nsite visits,  we  reviewed  medical  and  other  records  relating  to  the \ncare  and  treatment  of  over  300  residents.  We  also  reviewed \nfacility policies  and  procedures,  interviewed  administrators  and \nstaff,  and  observed  residents  in  their  residences,  activity areas, \nclassrooms,  and  during  meals.  We  conveyed  our preliminary \nfindings  at  exit  interviews  conducted  at  the  end  of  the  February \nand  April  facility visits,  and  articulated our  preliminary \nfindings  by  telephone  shortly after our  May  visit. \nAs  a  threshold  matter,  we  note  that  Conway  is  staffed \npredominately  by  dedicated  individuals  who  are  genuinely  concerned \nfor  the  well-being  of  the  persons  in  their  care.  Further,  we  wish \nto  express  our  appreciation  for  the  assistance  and  cooperation \n\nprovided  to  us  by  Conway  administrators  and  staff  throughout  the \ninvestigation. \nConsistent  with our  statutory obligation under  CRIPA,  I  now \nwrite  to  formally  advise  you  of  the  findings  of  our  investigation \nand  the  minimum  remedial  steps  we  deem  necessary  to  address  these \ndeficiencies.  As  described  more  fully  below,  we  conclude  that \ncertain conditions  at  Conway  violate  the  federal  constitutional \nand  statutory rights  of  In particular,  we  find  that \nresidents~ \nresidents  of  Conway  suffer  significant  harm  or  risk of  harm  from \nshortcomings  in  the  facilities'  health  care,  habilitative \ntreatment  services,  restraint  practices,  and  protection  from  harm \npolicies.  We  further  find  that  the  State  fails  to  provide \nresidents  with  required  education  services  pursuant  to  the \nIndividuals  with  Disabilities Education Act  (\"IDEA\"),  20  U.S.C. \n§  1401  et  ~·  Finally,  it appears  that  the  State  does  not \nprovide  services  to  individuals  with  disabilities  in  the  most \nintegrated  setting appropriate  to  individual  residents'  needs. \nSee  Olmstead  v.  L.C.,  527  U.S.  581  (1999) i  Title  II  of  the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities Act  (\"ADA\"),  42  U.S.C.  §§  12132  et \n~i Section  504  of  the  Rehabilitation Act  of  1973,  29  u.s.c: \n§  794i  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130 (d). \nI  .  BACKGROUND \nConway  is  a  center  for  persons  with  developmental \ndisabilities  such  as  mental  retardation,  cerebral  palsy,  epilepsy, \nand  autism.  At  the  time  of  our  2003  visits,  Conway  housed  nearly \n550  residents  aged  11  to  66.  Residents  live  in  approximately  30 \nhousing  units  spread  across  the  facility's  campusi  each  unit \nhouses  between  14  to  38  residents.  Some  residents  require \nsubstantial  staffing  supports  to  meet  their daily  needs,  while \nothers  are  much  more  independent.  A  number  of  residents  have \nsignificant  behavioral  issues,  and  many  of  the  residents  are \neither non-ambulatory  or  have  other  health  care  needs.  At  the \ntime  of  our  tours,  over  70%  of  the  residents  were  identified by \nConway  as  having  seizure  activity,  and  almost  half  of  the \nresidents  were  receiving  anticonvulsant  medications.  Over  40%  of \nresidents  had  been  diagnosed  as  having  one  or  more  psychiatric \ndisorders  and  were  receiving psychotropic  medications. \n2 \n\nII.  FINDINGS \nA.  HEALTH  CARE \nThe  residents  of  Conway  are  entitled  to  adequate  health  care. \nSee  Youngberg  v.  Romeo,  457  U.S.  307,  316,  323  (1982) i  Green  v. \nBaron,  879  F.2d  305,  310  (8th  Cir.  1989) .1  To  its credit,  Conway \ngenerally provides  adequate  EKG  monitoring,  serum  drug  levels,  and \nvarious  laboratory  testing  (e.g.,  liver  function  tests,  complete \nblood  counts).  Dental  care  is  also  adequate.  Additionally,  with \nthe  exception of  neurology  services,  _residents  who  require  a \nspecialized  level  of  medical  care  generally  receive  consultative \nservices. \nNotwith~tanding these  isolated positive  elements  of  care, \nhowever,  our  investigation  revealed  that  the  overall  health  care \nprovided  to  Conway  residents  is  grossly deficient  and  exposes \nindividuals  to  substantial  risk of  harm.  We  found  particularly \nacute  problems  with  Conway's  medical  and  neurological  care,  as \nwell  as  its physical  and  nutritional  management  and  therapy \nservices.  Nearly  as  troublesome  were  Conway's  infection  control \nand  medication  administration  practices. \n1.  Medical  Assessment  and  Treatment \nMedical  assessment  and  treatment  services  at  Conway  are \nterribly  inadequate.  Conway  medical  staff  often  fail  to  consider \ncrucial  medical  variables,  formulate  diagnoses,  and  plan  timely \nand  appropriate  interventions.  This  has  resulted  in  serious \ndelays  and,  in  some  cases,  outright  failures,  in  identifying, \ndiagnosing,  treating,  and  monitoring  residents  with  serious  and \nlife-threatening medical  problems. \n1  In  assessing  whether  the  constitutional  rights  of \nindividuals  with  developmental  disabilities  in  institutions \nhave  been violated,  the  governing  standard  is  the  Due  Process \nClause  of  the  Fourteenth Amendment.  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at \n323.  Accordingly,  the  proper  inquiry  focuses  on  whether \ninstitutional  conditions  substantially depart  from  generally \naccepted  professional  judgment,  practices,  or  standards.  Id. \nat  323i  see  also  Morgan  v.  Rabun,  128  F.3d  694,  697-98 \n(8th  Cir.  1997) i  Heidemann  v.  Rother,  84  F.3d  1021,  1029 \n(8th  Cir.  1996). \n3 \n\nThe  days  leading  up  to  the  death  of  Conway  resident  Nancy \nGreen2  illustrate  the  serious  deficiencies  in basic  medical  care \nat  Conway.  On  April  7,  2003,  nursing  staff  reported  evidence  of \n\"profuse  bleeding\"  into Ms.  Green's  colostomy bag.  On  April  8, \n2003,  the  attending  physician  recommended  \"seeking  surgery  for \ncauterization of  stoma  site.\"3  Yet  there  was  no  documentation \nthat  the  physician  examined  or  attempted  to  examine  Ms.  Green  at \nthat  time.  Although  she  experienced  significant  amounts  of \nbleeding  on  three  more  documented  occasions,  Ms.  Green  was  not \nseen  by  a  surgeon  until  April  17,  at  which  time  the  surgeon \nfinally  cauterized  the  colostomy  area  and  stated,  \"if bleeding \npersists,  will  need  to  admit  and  work  up  in hospital.\" \nOn  no  less  than  eight  subsequent  occasions  during  the  next \nthree  months,  Conway  nursing  staff documented  significant \nbleeding,  sometimes  in amounts  that  were  large  enough  to  fill \nMs.  Green's  colostomy  bag,  spill  onto  her  legs,  and  soak  her \nclothing.  Records  indicate  that  on  only one  occasion  did  the \nattending  physician  actually examine  the  stoma  site.  There  is  no \nevidence  that  the  physician  ever  assessed  the  various  possible \ncauses  of  Ms.  Green's  bleeding  or  developed  a  plan  of  care  to \nevaluate  and  treat  these  causes  (other  than  referrals  to  surgery \nfor  cauterization and  to  a  local  emergency  room) .  This  is \nespecially disturbing  because  not  only did Ms.  Green  have  a \ndocumented history of  conditions  that  can  be  likely causes  of \nsignificant  bleeding,  but  the  surgeon  had  recommended  an  in \npatient  evaluation  if bleeding  persisted.  On  July  30,  2003,  after \ntwo  documented  episodes  of  particularly heavy  bleeding  the  day \nbefore,  the  physician  finally  sent  Ms.  Green  to  Conway  Regional \nMedical  Center  where,  on August  9,  2003,  she  died. \nConway  did  not  provide  us  an  autopsy  report  or hospital \nrecords,  although we  requested  these  materials.  Without  such \nrecords,  it is  not  possible  to  determine  the  exact  cause  of \nMs.  Green's  death.  However,  Conway's  failure  to  assess  adequately \nthe  possible  causes  of  Ms.  Green's  persistent  bleeding  and  to \ndevelop  a  plan  of  medical  care  as  well  as  its  apparent  disregard \nof  the  treating  surgeon's  instructions,  represents  a  gross \ndeficiency in medical  care. \n2  To  protect  residents'  privacy,  we  identify residents \nwith  pseudonyms.  We  will  separately  transmit  a  schedule \ncross-referencing  the  pseudonyms  with  the  residents'  names. \nStoma  is  a  surgical  opening. \n4 \n\nThe  case  of  Ms.  Green  is  hardly unique.  We  found  numerous \nother  instances  where  Conway's  physicians  failed  to  conduct  basic \nassessment  and  treatment  of  residents,  and  overlooked  or  ignored \nsignificant  symptoms.  For  example,  during  Donna  Moran's  annual \nphysical  examination  in April  2002,  the  physician  detected  a  \"3  x \n3  em.  mass,  right  breast,\"  and  recommended  further  assessment  of \nthe  mass.  But  medical  records  reflect,  and  the  attending \nphysician  confirmed  during  our  May  2003  tour  that,  more  than  one \nyear  after detection of  the  breast  mass,  absolutely  no  follow-up \nwas  provided  to  Ms.  Moran.  This  is  especially disturbing  in  light \nof  the  fact  that  Ms.  Moran's  medical  summary  sheet  indicates  that \nshe  has  a  \"history of  hysterectomy\"  without  any  further \ninformation  on  the  reason  for  the  hysterectomy.  If  the \nundocumented  reason  for  the  hysterectomy was  cancer,  the  breast \nmass  could be  closely related and  potentially life-threatening. \nEdward  Spears  presents  another  troubling  case.  Mr.  Spears \nhas  been  diagnosed  with  a  seizure  disorder.  Medical  records \nreflect  that  beginning  in November  2002,  Mr.  Spears'  seizures \nworsened  in  frequency,  severity,  and  type  of  seizure  activity,  and \nthat  he  also  began  to  fall  frequently,  something  not  previously \nnoted  to  be  a  problem.  Yet  neither  the  attending physician  nor \nthe  neurologist  adequately  assessed Mr.  Spears  to  determine  the \ncause  of  the  increased  seizure  activity and  the  falls.  The \nomission  is  glaring  because  a  blood  test  conducted  in  February \n2003  indicated  serum potassium  in  the  toxic  range.  Elevated \nlevels  of  serum  potassium are  known  to  have  adverse  effects  on \nneurological  functioning,  and  may  have  been  the  cause  of \nMr.  Spears'  increased  seizure  activity and  falls.  Although  the \nattending  physician  initialed the  February  2003  blood  test \nresults,  there  is  no  record  of  follow-up  of  any  kind. \nOne  factor  exacerbating  Conway's  deficient  medical  care  is \nits grossly  inadequate  documentation  practices.  Generally \naccepted professional  standards  require  that  medical  records  be \norganized  in a  manner  that  allows  relevant  information  to  be \nidentified and  utilized  in medical  treatment  decisions.  Conway's \nrecords  are  incomplete,  cursory,  and  arbitrary.  Progress  notes  by \nboth nurses  and  physicians  do  not  accurately  reflect  whether  or \nnot  a  resident  has  been  fully  assessed  or  a  treatment  plan has \nbeen  ordered.  Medical  summaries  and  problem  lists  fail  to  include \nvital  information  about  treatments  and,  in many  cases,  contain \noutdated  information  regarding  current  diagnoses,  medications,  and \nspecialists  involved  in  the  residents'  care. \n5 \n\nNursing  care  plans  likewise  are  inadequate.  They  are  not \nstandardized,  are  not  updated  appropriately,  are  minimal  in \ncontent,  and  are  not  sufficiently specific.  Patient  goals  are \npoorly documented  and  not  reviewed  consistently among  the \ndifferent  treatment  teams.  Often,  goals  are  not  implemented,  and \nno  rationale  is provided  to  explain  the  lack  of  implementation. \nAnother  factor  that  contributes  to  the  inadequate  medical \ncare  is  Conway's  lack of  a  system  for  monitoring  the  quality  of \nphysician  services.  Generally  accepted  professional  standards \ndictate  that  health care  facilities  collect  data  on  patterns  of \nphysician practices  and  make  inquiries  regarding  problematic \ntrends.  Additionally,  there  should  be  a  process  through  which \ninformation  about  physician  practices  and  trends  can  be  used  for \ncorrective  action  and  performance  improvement.  Conway's  lack  of \nan  adequate  monitoring  system  for  physician  services  places \nresidents  at  risk of  preventable  and  potentially  life-threatening \nharm.  And  Conway's  failure  to  conduct  meaningful  mortality \nreviews,  discussed  below,  heightens  this  risk. \n2.  Preventive  Care \nConway's  preventive  care  is  deficient  in  a  number  of \nimportant  respects.  First,  Conway  fails  to  provide  consistent \nscreening  for  residents  who  are  at  risk  for  developing  particular \nmedical  problems,  including:  (1)  screening  for  thyroid and \ncervical  spine  problems  in  individuals  with  Down's  syndrome; \n(2)  bone  density  screening  for  those  at  risk of  developing \nosteoporosis  (e.g.,  those  receiving  long-term  treatment  with \nphenytoin4);  and,  (3)  screening  for  bowel  dysfunction. \nResident  Michael  Willis  provides  a  case  in point. \nMr.  Willis,  who  receives  chronic  treatment  with  phenytoin,  has \nnever  had  his  bone  density  screened  appropriately.  Over  the \ncourse  of  several  years,  Mr.  Willis  has  suffered  several \nfractures,  including  fractures  of  his  right  humerus,  right  ankle, \nright  fourth  finger,  left  clavicle,  and  right  first  metatarsal. \nThe  failure  to  screen  for  bone  density  is  a  substantial  departure \nfrom  generally accepted practices  and  may  have  denied  Mr.  Willis \npreventive  treatment  for  his  increased  risk of  fractures. \nConway  also  fails  to  conduct  adequate  physical  examinations. \nPhysical  examinations,  which  are  supposed  to  be  conducted \n4  Phenytoin  is  an  anticonvulsant  medication. \n6 \n\nannually,  are  often not  timely.  Morever,  when  these  exams  do \noccur,  physicians  regularly  \"defer\"  examination  of  residents' \ngenitalia,  testes,  external  vagina  and  rectum.  There  is  no \ndocumentation  indicating  that  these  examinations  are  later \nperformed.  Generally  accepted  professional  standards  of  care \nrequire  that  such  probes  should  be  part  of  every  annual  physical \nexamination.  The  consistent  deferment  of  this  portion of  the \nexamination  places  residents  at  risk  that  illnesses  and  other \nharmful  conditions  will  go  undetected  and  untreated.  Of  great \nconcern  is  the  possibility that  the  failure  to  conduct  such \nexaminations  annually will  allow  sexual  abuse  to  go  undetected. \nFinally,  according  to  generally accepted  professional \nstandards,  all  staff  who  work  directly with  residents  should  be \ncertified and  re-certified  in  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation \n(\"CPR\")  and  first  aid.  Although  all  Conway  staff  are  trained  and \ncertified in  CPR  upon  initial  hire,  only medical  staff  are \nrequired  to  become  re-certified  in  CPR.  The  direct  care  staff, \nwho  are  often  the  only persons  available  to  assist  residents  on \nthe  units  in  case  of  an  emergency,  are  not  required  to  maintain \nthese  certifications. \n3.  Neurological  Care \nConway  fails  to  provide  adequate  care  and  monitoring  for \nresidents  with  seizure  disorders.  At  the  time  of  our  tour,  over \n70%  of  the  residents  had  a  history of  seizure  activity and  almost \nhalf  of  the  residents  were  taking one  or more  anticonvulsant \nmedications  for  a  seizure  disorder.  Generally  accepted \nprofessional  standards  dictate  that  all  reasonable  efforts  should \nbe  taken  to:  (1)  identify  the  cause  of  a  resident's  seizures, \n(2)  use  anticonvulsant  medications  that  control  seizures  with \nminimal  toxicity,  and  (3)  use  alternative  therapies  for  residents \nwith  seizures  that  are  resistant  to  medications. \nAt  Conway,  however,  some  residents  with  active  seizure \ndisorders  have  not  received neurology  services  of  any  kind  in \nseveral  years.  Further,  Conway  has  no  clear criteria  for \nreferrals  of  individuals  with  refractory seizures  --i.e., \nexperiencing  ten  or more  seizures  per  year  -- to  epileptology.  At \nthe  time  of  our  review,  the  majority of  Conway  residents  with \nrefractory seizures  had  not  been  evaluated  by  epileptology. \nConway  also  fails  to  monitor  adequately  the  use  of \nanticonvulsant  medications.  Anticonvulsant  medications  are  not \nuniformly  helpful  for  various  seizure  types,  and  certain \n7 \n\nmedications  that  may  reduce  one  type  of  seizure  may  exacerbate \nothers.  At  Conway/  the  use  of  anticonvulsant  medication  is  not \nbased  on  a  reliable  diagnostic  evaluation  to  determine  the \nspecific  type  of  seizure  an  individual  exhibits.  In  the  vast \nmajority  of  records  we  reviewed/  no  diagnosis  of  seizure  type  was \nlisted either  in  the  medical  summaries  or  in  the  neurology \nconsultant/s  notes.  This  is  true  even  in  the  records  of \nindividuals  with  refractory  seizure  types.  Indeed/  at  the  time  of \nour  tour/  several  residents  had  experienced  well  over  ten  seizures \nwithin  12  months.  Yet  none  of  these  residents/  records  contains  a \ncharacterization of  seizure  type/  nor  do  the  records  reflect  any \neffort  to  classify the  seizures.  For  that  matter,  Conwayts \nselection of  anticonvulsant  medications  suggests  no  effort  to \nmatch  the  seizure  type  with  the  medication  most  likely to  address \nthe  problem.  This  raises  the  possibility that  poor  treatment \nselection may  be  a  factor  in  the  worsening  of  the  seizure \ndisorder. \nConway  similarly neglects  to  provide  any  monitoring  of \ncognitive/  motor or behavioral  toxicity associated with  the  use \n1 \nof  anticonvulsant  treatments.  Anticonvulsant  medications  can  have \na  wide  range  of  adverse  and  potentially life-threatening effects. \nIndividuals  with  developmental  disabilities  are  particularly \nvulnerable  to  the  adverse  affects  of  anticonvulsant  medications/ \nespecially the  older anticonvulsants.  Although  some  Conway \nresidents  with  seizure  disorders  have  been  transitioned  from \ntreatment  with  older  anticonvulsant  medications  to  newer  agents/ \nthe  use  of  older  anticonvulsants  is  still prevalent,  without \nappropriate  diagnostic  evaluation  and  careful  analysis  of  risks \nand  benefits. \nGenerally  accepted  professional  standards  of  care  require \nthat  individuals  who  have  been  seizure-free  for  two  or more  years \nbe  re-evaluated  to  determine  whether  anticonvulsant  treatment  is \nstill necessary.  However/  numerous  Conway  residents  receiving \nanticonvulsant  medications  at  the  time  of  our  tour  had  no \ndocumented  seizure  activity in  several  years.  For  example/  Kevin \nRogers  has  received  continuous  treatment  with  phenytoin  since  his \nlast  documented  seizure  in 1991.  His  most  recent  neurological \nassessment  was  in  1992.  Pat  Glass  and  Lisa  Parks  have  been \ntreated  continuously with  phenytoin  since  their  last  documented \nseizures  in  1996.  There  is  no  evidence  that  either  resident  has \nreceived  a  neurological  assessment  of  the  need  for  this  continued \ntreatment  or  any  evaluation of  the  risks  associated with  use  of \nthis  anticonvulsant  medication/  which  include  significant \n8 \n\nimpairment  in motor  performance,  decline  in  cognition,  and \nincreased  risk  for  pathological  fractures. 5 \n4.  Nutritional  and  Physical  Management  Services \nConway's  physical  and  nutritional  management  services  pose \nserious  risks  to  residents.  Specifically,  Conway  fails  to: \n(1)  identify,  assess,  and  monitor  individuals  vulnerable  to  the \ntype  of  health  concerns  common  in  individuals  with  developmental \ndisabilities;  (2)  provide  adequate  mealtime  supports;  (3)  conduct \nsafe  and  proper  transfers  of  individuals  who  need  assistance;  and \n(4)  provide  adequate  seating  systems  and  alternate  positioning \noptions.  As  a  result,  Conway  residents  are  subjected  to  a  range \nof  serious  and,  in  some  cases,  potentially  fatal  conditions. \na.  Identification,  Assessment  & Monitoring  of \nHigh  Risk  Residents \nIndividuals  with  developmental  disabilities  often have \nsignificant  health  and  medical  concerns,  including  pneumonia \nand/or  aspiration pneumonia,  choking,  dysphasia, 6  lung  disease, \nseizure  disorders,  and  gastroesophageal  reflux,  to  name  just  a \nfew.  When  these  \"health  risk  indicators\"  are  present  (especially \nin  combination) ,  residents  require  specialized physical  and \nnutritional  supports  (\"PNS\")  in order  to  avoid  serious  risk of \nharm.  Safe  and  adequate  nutrition,  whether  taken  orally or \nthrough  tube-feeding,  is  critical. \nGenerally  accepted  professional  standards  require  that  a \nfacility  like  Conway  have  a  PNS  team,  committee,  or  the  equivalent \nwhose  functions  include:  (1)  identifying  and  tracking  individuals \nwith  health  risk  indicators;  (2)  providing  comprehensive \nassessments  of  an  individual's  PNS  needs;  and  (3)  monitoring  the \neffectiveness  of  PNS  services.  Conway  does  not  have  a  PNS  team  or \nany  other  system  for  adequately  identifying,  assessing,  and \nmonitoring  individuals  with,  or  at  risk of,  health  concerns  common \nin  individuals  with  developmental  disabilities. \n5  A  pathological  fracture  is  a  spontaneous  fracture \noccurring  as  a  result  of  disease  of  a  bone  and  not  due  to \ntrauma. \n6  Dysphasia  is  a  condition that  causes  difficulty in \nswallowing. \n9 \n\nConway  does  have  what  it calls  \"specialized  eating \ncommittees,\"  including  a  central  Specialized  Eating  Committee \n(\"Central  SEC\")  and  each  treatment  team,s  Specialized Eating \nCommit tee  (\"Team  SEC,,) .  However,  these  commit tees  do  not  serve \nthe  critical  functions  of  identifying,  assessing,  and  monitoring \nindividuals  with,  or  at  risk of,  PNS-related  health  concerns. \nAccording  to  Conway,s  written  policies  and  procedures,  the  Central \nSEC  is  supposed  to  provide  quality  control  with  respect  to \nspecialized eating  guidelines  and  general  structure  and  oversight \nto  the  Team  SECs.  In  practice,  the  Central  SEC  performs \nadministrative  tasks  such  as  following  up  on  lost  equipment, \nconducting  inventories  of  adaptive  mealtime  equipment,  and \ngathering  catalogs  to  order  equipment.  We  found  no  evidence  that \nthe  Central  SEC  had  addressed  significant  PNS  issues  for  anyone \nliving  at  Conway  during  the  eight-month  period  for  which  meeting \nminutes  were  provided.  In  fact,  at  the  time  of  our  tour  in \nFebruary  2003,  the  Central  SEC  had  not  even  met  since  October \n2002. \nLikewise,  the  Team  SECs  do  not  provide  the  comprehensive \nsupports  and  services  that  a  PNS  team  typically provides. \nAccording  to  Conway,s  written  policies  and  procedures,  the  primary \npurpose  of  each  Team  SEC  is  to  enhance  individuals,  eating  skills. \nIn  practice,  Team  SECs  conduct  limited mealtime  monitoring  on  a \nsporadic,  inconsistent  basis.  Furthermore,  this  monitoring \ngenerally  is  limited  to  determining  whether  the  proper  equipment \nand  diet  texture  is provided  to  the  individual.  Staff1 s \nmonitoring  does  not  include  a  systematic  review  of  the \neffectiveness  of  the  specialized eating  procedures  or  staff,s \nimplementation  of  the  mealtime  plan. \nThere  are  a  significant  number  of  residents  at  Conway  who, \nbased  on  their histories  of  health  risk  indicators,  should be,  but \nhave  not  been,  assessed  and  monitored  by  a  PNS  team.  For  example, \nConway,s  records  reveal  that  several  individuals  experienced \nrepeated  incidents  of  decubitus  ulcers7  in  the  year  preceding  our \ntour,  and  numerous  others  were  identified as  having  \"skin \nintegrity concerns\"  in  staff meeting  minutes.  Others  have \ndocumented  diagnoses  of  dysphasia  or pneumonia  and  many  have \nexperienced  significant  weight  loss.  Numerous  residents  have  been \n7  Decubitus  ulcers  are  sores  resulting  from  the \nprolonged pressure  of  lying  in  a  bed  for  a  long  period  of \ntime.  They  are  also  referred  to  as  pressure  sores  or  bed \nsores. \n10 \n\ntaken  to  the  emergency  room  and/or  hospitalized  for  PNS-related \ndiagnoses  such  as  dehydration,  respiratory distress,  bowel \nobstruction,  and  aspiration.  Sadly,  many  individuals  who  have \ndied  since  January  2002  exhibited  health  risk  indicators  and  may \nhave  benefitted  from  PNS-related  services  that  they  never \nreceived. \nEven  in  cases  where  Conway  makes  efforts  to  identify  specific \nphysical  and  nutritional  support  needs,  it fails  to  implement \nconsistently a  plan  to  address  these  needs.  For  example, \nCharlotte  Reese  had  a  swallow  study  in January  2002  due  to \nincreased  coughing  during  and  after meals.  The  radiologist's \nreport  concluded  that  dysphasia  was  present  and  recommended \nsmaller  bites  and  \"chin  tuck  maneuvers.\"  There  is  no  evidence \nthat  the  SEC  or  the  speech-language  pathologist  reviewed  the \nswallow  study,  nor  did Ms.  Reese  have  a  set  of  specialized eating \nprocedures  in place  to  guide  staff  on  proper  food  presentation \ntechniques.  We  observed Ms.  Reese  during  a  meal  when  staff \npresented  her  with  large  bites  of  food  without  sufficient  time  for \nher  to  swallow  and  clear.  At  times,  staff presented  up  to  five \nbites  without  permitting her  to  swallow  and  clear. \nIn  another  example,  Tim  Jackson  had  a  swallow  study  in \nFebruary  2002,  in which  the  radiologist  concluded  that  he  should \nnot  receive  thin  liquids.  However,  Mr.  Jackson's  specialized \neating procedures  were  dated  January  2002  and,  at  the  time  of  our \nreview  more  than  a  year  later,  had  not  been  updated  to  reflect  the \nfindings  and  recommendations  of  the  swallow  study. \nConway  also  fails  to  provide  adequate  PNS  services  to \nindividuals  receiving  tube-fed nutrition.  Tube-fed  individuals \nare  at  risk of  complications  such  as  those  related  to  surgery, \naspiration,  and  respiratory problems.  Therefore,  generally \naccepted  standards  of  care  require  that  a  PNS  team:  (1)  conduct  a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  PNS  needs  prior  to  tube  placement,  and \n(2)  develop  a  PNS  plan  to  address  the  individual's  needs  after \ntube  placement.  This  plan  should  include  consideration of  a \nreturn  to  oral  intake. \nNone  of  the  70  individuals  identified by  Conway  as  receiving \nsome  or  all  of  their nutrition via  tube  at  the  time  of  our  review \nhad  received  a  comprehensive  team  assessment  prior  to  tube \nplacement,  nor  did  any  of  them  have  a  PNS  plan.  In  fact,  the  SECs \nhad  not  completed  any  assessments,  screenings,  reviews,  or \nmonitoring  of  any  of  these  70  residents. \n11 \n\nb.  Mealtime  Supports \nConway  fails  to  provide  adequate  mealtime  supports  to  its \nresidents.  We  observed  numerous  individuals  who  were  eating  and \ndrinking,  either on  their  own  or with  staff  assistance,  at  too \nfast  a  pace,  and  many  who  were  presented or  permitted  to  take \nbites  or  sips  that  were  too  large.  Staff  frequently  failed  to \nfollow  the  residents'  specialized eating procedures  or other \nmealtime  plans.  For  example,  some  individuals  did  not  receive  the \ncorrect  diet  texture  and/or  liquid consistency.  Others  were \nsupposed  to  receive  liquids  throughout  the  meal  but  received  none. \nAll  of  these  practices place  residents  at  risk of  aspiration  and \nchoking. \nWe  also  observed  numerous  individuals  eating,  drinking,  or \nreceiving  enteral  nutrition while  in poor  postural  alignment, \nplacing  these  individuals  at  risk of  gastroesophageal  reflux, 8  in \naddition  to  aspiration and  choking.  In  many  instances,  direct \ncare  staff  not  only  failed  to  correct  the  resident's  poor  postural \nalignment,  but  actually contributed  to  the  risk of  harm  by  using \nimproper  mealtime  assistance  techniques  (e.g.,  standing  above  the \nresident's  eye  level  range,  causing  the  resident  to  hyperextend \nhis  or her  neck) . \nMealtimes  in  some  of  the  housing  units  are  exceptionally \ncrowded  and  chaotic,  with  insufficient  staffing  to  provide \nadequate  supervision  and  assistance  during  meals.  See  42  C.P.R. \n§  483.430 (d)  (1)  (\"The  facility must  provide  sufficient  direct  care \n8  Gastroesophageal  reflux  is  the  term  used  to  describe \na  backflow  of  acid  from  the  stomach  into  the  swallowing  tube \nor  esophagus.  When  the  frequency  of  acid  reflux  is  much \ngreater  than  normal,  or  complications  develop  as  a  result  of \nacid  reflux,  the  condition  is  known  as  gastroesophageal  reflux \ndisease,  or GERD.  Chronic  irritation of  the  esophagus  by \nstomach  contents  may  cause  scarring  and  narrowing  of  the \nesophagus,  making  swallowing  difficult.  GERD  may  also \nirritate the  muscles  in  the  esophagus,  causing  discoordinated \nactivity during  swallowing.  Severe  injury  to  the  esophagus \nmay  lead  to  bleeding  or ulcer  formation.  Patients  who \nexperience  regurgitation  could  aspirate  stomach  contents  into \ntheir  lungs  resulting  in  pneumonia.  Chronic  irritation of  the \nesophagus  may  also  lead  to  the  growth  of  abnormal  lining \ncells,  a  condition  known  as  Barrett's  esophagus. \n12 \n\nstaff  to  manage  and  supervise  clients  in accordance  with  their \nindividual  program plansn).  Our  observations  of  breakfast  in one \nunit  are  illustrative  of  many  of  these  harmful  practices.  When  we \narrived,  there  were  two  staff  in  the  day  room  with  16  residents, \nwhile  two  other  staff  were  in  the  kitchen  preparing  breakfast. \nThe  meal  began  shortly after  7:00  a.m.  Many  residents  did  not \nhave  a  beverage.  A  number  of  residents  had  difficulty cutting \ntheir  food  and,  when  they  received  no  assistance  from  staff,  began \neating  large  pieces  of  food  with  their hands,  often  stuffing  large \npieces  of  food  in  their mouths.  One  of  the  men  we  observed \nswallowing  whole  pieces  of  French  toast  has  a  diet  order  that \ncalls  for  diced,  half-inch pieces  of  food,  and  had  a  choking \nincident  in April  2002.  After  residents'  repeated  requests  for  a \nbeverage,  a  staff  member  finally brought  a  pitcher  of  juice  to  the \nresidents  at  7:40  a.m.  Three  of  the  men,  however,  had  finished \ntheir meal  by  7:25  a.m.  and  thus  had  no  beverage  with  their meal. \nOne  resident  lowered  his  pants  in  the  dining  room  and  was  removed. \nAnother  resident  was  observed  \"feedingn  other  men  from  his  plate \nand  pouring  liquid  from  his  cup  into  another  resident's  cup  before \nand  after he  drank  from  the  cup  himself.  A  third  resident  dropped \nhis  spoon  and  was  unable  to  retrieve  it himself.  He  quietly asked \nfor  assistance,  but  no  staff  attended  to  him.  A  fourth  resident \ngulped  liquids  rapidly and  coughed  repeatedly  without  staff \nintervention.  Another  resident  also  gulped  his  beverage  rapidly \nat  the  end  of  his  meal.  At  approximately  8:00a.m.  (and  after our \nConway  staff  escort  spoke  to  a  staff member),  five  additional \nstaff  entered  the  dining  area. \nThe  numerous  unsafe  mealtime  practices  described  above \nreflect  the  inadequate  training  and  supervision  that  Conway \nprovides  to  its direct  care  staff,  as  well  as  deficiencies  in  the \nknowledge  and  skills of  the  professional  staff  who  should  be \nsupervising  and  correcting  the  direct  care  staff.  Contrary  to \ngenerally accepted  professional  standards,  Conway's  direct  care \nstaff  do  not  receive  competency-based  training  regarding  mealtime \nassistance  strategies  specifically  related  to  presentation of  food \nand  fluids,  nor  do  they  receive  person-specific  training  regarding \nthe  implementation  of  residents'  nutritional  support  plans. \nMoreover,  despite  the  many  shortcomings  we  observed,  the \nprofessional  staff do  not  identify  these  practices  as  deficient \nthrough  their mealtime  monitoring  activities  or otherwise. \nc.  Transfers \nA  significant  portion  of  Conway  residents  have  limited \nmobility  and,  therefore,  are  dependent  on  staff  to  transfer  them \n13 \n\nfrom  one  position or  location  to  another.  Generally  accepted \nprofessional  standards  of  care  require  that  staff  be  adequately \ntrained  in  and  utilize  safe  and  appropriate  physical  support  and \nhandling  techniques  in  the  course  of  transfers.  Properly  setting \nup  the  environment  prior  to  executing  a  transfer  is  a  critical \ncomponent  in  this  process.  Controlled,  smooth  and  segmented \nmovements  with proper  body  mechanics,  and  adequate  support  of  the \nindividual  at  proximal  points  of  his  or  her  body  are  integral \naspects  of  safe  and  efficient  transfers.  When  transfers  are \nconducted  improperly,  residents  are  at  significant  risk of  harm, \nincluding  nerve  damage,  fractures,  and  various  injuries  resulting \nfrom  falls. \nWe  observed  numerous  transfers  in which  staff  demonstrated \nunsafe  techniques  such  as  moving  too  quickly,  dropping  the \nresident  onto  a  chair or  bed,  improperly  securing wheelchairs  or \nbeds  prior to  transfer,  failing  to  properly align  the  resident \nafter  the  transfer,  neglecting  to  communicate  to  the  resident  and \nprepare  equipment  prior  to  the  transfer,  and  using  improper  body \nmechanics.  These  improper  techniques  place  residents  (and  staff) \nat  significant  risk of  injuries. \nThe  numerous  unsafe  transfer  techniques  we  observed  reflect \nthe  inadequate  training  and  monitoring  that  direct  care  staff \nreceive.  Staff  training  on  transfer  techniques  should  stress \npractice  and  performance  competency  in  the  areas  of  proper  body \nmechanics  and  proper  alignment  and  support  of  the  resident  before, \nduring,  and  after a  transfer.  See  42  C.F.R.  §  483.430(c) (2)  (\"For \nemployees  who  work  with  clients,  training must  focus  on  skills  and \ncompetencies  directed  toward  clients'  developmental,  behavioral, \nand  health needs\").  Conway's  training  is  not  competency-based. \nIndeed,  instructions  and  guidelines  distributed during  Conway's \ninitial phase  of  training  fail  to  include  important  information, \nsuch  as  how  to  set  up  a  safe  transfer environment  and  the  proper \nuse  of  a  mechanical  lift. \nd.  Seating  Systems  and  Alternate  Positioning \nConway's  seating  systems  and  alternate positioning devices \nsubstantially depart  from  generally  accepted professional \nstandards.  It  is well  established  among  professionals  in  the \nhealth  care  field  that  individuals  must  be  provided  with  safe  and \nappropriate  seating  systems  and  alternate positioning devices  that \nallow  for  proper  alignment  and  support.  Seating  systems  and \nalternate positioning  devices  should  be  individually  tailored  to \nthe  specific  needs  of  each  resident.  Residents  who  are  not \n14 \n\nproperly  aligned  and  supported  in  their  seating  systems  and/or \nalternate  positioning  devices  are  at  risk of  aspiration, \ngastroesophageal  reflux,  contractures, 9  musculoskeletal \ndeformities,  debucitus  ulcers,  skin breakdown,  and  other  harmful \nconditions. \nWe  observed  numerous  residents  with  poor  alignment  and \nsupport  in wheelchairs,  beds,  and  recliners.  Many  residents  with \ninadequate  support  and  alignment  were  receiving  tube-fed  nutrition \nat  the  time,  increasing  the  resident's  risk of  aspiration and \ngastroesophageal  reflux,  and  reducing  the  resident's  ability to \nbreathe  and  digest  safely and  effectively. \nConway's  alternative  positioning  options  are  limited  to  beds, \nrecliners,  beanbags,  beds  with  padded  sides,  and  waterbeds.  These \ndevices  may  not  address  the  unique  needs  of  each  resident  and  thus \nmay  not  provide  needed  pressure  relief.  In  fact,  team  meeting \nminutes  reflect  that  several  residents  experienced  \"skin  integrity \nconcerns\"  related  to  their seating  systems  and/or  alternate \npositioning. \nComprehensive  assessment  of  residents'  seating  system  and \nalternate  positioning  needs  is  a  generally accepted  professional \npractice,  and  typically  includes  a  \"mat  assessment\"  to  identify \nthe  individual's  postural  patterns,  skeletal  deformities,  and \nrange  of  motion  limitations  for  seating  and  other positions. \nWithout  comprehensive  assessments,  individuals  are  at  risk of \nreceiving  inadequate  support  and  alignment  which,  as  discussed \nabove,  increases  their  risk of  physical  harm. \nConway's  PT/Orthotic  shop  operates  a  \"seating  clinic\"  and,  to \nits  credit,  capably  completes  seating  system  fabrications, \nmodifications,  and  repairs  on-site  and  in  a  timely manner. \nHowever,  Conway's  seating  clinic  does  not  conduct  adequate \nassessments  of  residents'  needs  prior to  fabrication  or \nmodification  of  seating  systems. \nMorever,  only  a  fraction  of  the  individuals  with  seating \nsystems  are  evaluated  in  the  seating  clinic.  We  received \nconflicting  information  regarding  how  many  individuals  are \n9  A  contracture  is  a  permanent  tightening  of  muscle, \ntendons,  ligaments,  or  skin  that  prevents  normal  movement  of \nthe  associated body  part.  It  can  cause  permanent  deformity  of \nthe  affected body  part. \n15 \n\nactually  seen  in  the  clinic  on  an  annual  basis,  ranging  from  44  to \n150  residents.  Whatever  the  correct  figure  is,  the  number  of \nindividuals  seen  in  the  clinic  is  still  substantially less  than \nthe  244  to  275  residents  who  use  a  wheelchair  as  their primary \nmeans  of  mobility.  In  fact,  we  observed  residents  in  seating \nsystems  with  poor  alignment  and  support  who,  at  the  time  of  our \nreview,  had  not  been  evaluated by  the  clinic  in  over  a  year. \nMoreover,  even  when  evaluated by  the  clinic,  residents  often  are \nnot  provided  safe  and  appropriate  seating  systems.  Several \nresidents,  for  instance,  were  evaluated  in  the  clinic  in  the  year \nprior  to  our  tour,  but  none_ were  in seating  systems  that  provided \nadequate  alignment  and  support  at  the  time  of  our  review. \nEllie  Ryan  illustrates  the  risk of  significant  harm  presented \nby  not  providing  a  comprehensive  seating  assessment.  Between \nFebruary  and  October  2002,  Conway  staff  submitted  six  separate \nwork  orders  to  resolve  problems  with  Ms.  Ryan's  foot  support  in \nher  wheelchair.  But  there  was  no  evidence  that  Conway  conducted  a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  Ms.  Ryan's  needs.  The  modifications \nmade  in response  to  each  of  the  six work  orders  did not  resolve \nMs.  Ryan's  foot  support  issues  and,  consequently,  she  suffered \nmultiple  injuries  over  the  six-month  period,  including  foot \nfractures  and  skin breakdown.  If  Conway  had  provided  Ms.  Ryan \nwith  a  timely  and  comprehensive  seating  assessment  in  February \n2002,  these  injuries  may  have  been  prevented. \nFinally,  Conway's  system  for  monitoring  the  condition and \neffectiveness  of  seating  systems  is  inadequate.  Based  on  the \nnumber  of  individuals  we  observed  with  inadequate  seating  systems, \nas  discussed  above,  it  is  apparent  that  the  therapists  and  aides \ncharged with  identifying  alignment  and  support  issues  lack  the \nknowledge  and  skills  necessary  to  recognize  and  correct  these \ndeficiencies. \n5.  Therapy  Services \nConway  fails  to  provide  its  residents  with  adequate  and \nappropriate  occupational  therapy  (\"OT\"),  physical  therapy  (\"PT\"), \nand  communication  services.  As  a  result,  residents  face  an \nincreased  risk of  contractures  and  deformity,  and  loss  of \nindependence  and  functional  skills.  Lack  of  adequate  OT  and  PT \nsupports  also  exposes  residents  to  an  increased  risk of \nrespiratory,  gastrointestinal,  and  skin  integrity complications. \nIf  communication  skills deteriorate  or  are  not  developed, \nresidents  are  more  likely to  be  unable  to  convey  basic  needs  and \nconcerns.  Lack  of  communication  skills  will  also  make  it more \n16 \n\ndifficult  for  staff  to  recognize  and  diagnose  health  issues  such \nas  pain. \nConway  fails  to  provide  residents  with  adequate  OT  and  PT \nassessments  and  services.  Assessments  fail  to  establish  clear \nbaselines  and  goals  for  therapy  services.  In  fact,  of  the  53 \nindividual  program  plans  we  reviewed  for  therapy  services,  not  one \nincluded  learning  objectives  for  people  receiving  direct  OT  or  PT. \nRather,  documentation  of  residents'  progress  in  therapy  typically \nconsists  of  superficial,  subjective  statements  such  as  the \nresident  \"had  a  good  year,\"  or was  \"performing  well,\"  and  contains \nno  measurement  or  analysis  of  objective  data,  nor  even  an \nexpectation  that  residents  will  acquire  new  skills.  With  regard \nto  OT  and  PT  assessments  and  services,  it remains  unclear  whether \nConway's  OT  and  PT  staff  are  unable  to  recognize  potentials  and \nneeds  for  residents  or whether  they  simply  do  not  have  time,  due \nto  low  staffing  levels,  to  assess  and  implement  supports \nappropriately  for  residents  to  meet  their  individualized needs. \nCommunication  evaluations  are  more  comprehensive  than  OT  and \nPT  evaluations,  and  more  often  include  measurable  learning \nobjectives.  However,  Conway's  communication  therapists  fail  to \nprovide  adequate  augmentative  and  alternative  communication \n(\"AAC\")  evaluations  and  services.  AAC  devices  (e.g., \ncommunication  boards,  electronic  devices,  etc.)  are  used  by \nindividuals  who  have  the  capacity to  communicate  with  others,  but \nwho  have  impairments  that  interfere  with  their ability to  do  so \nverbally.  AAC  devices  enable  individuals  who  otherwise  would  be \nunable  to  do  so  to  explain  their medical  (e.g.,  pain,  illness \nsymptoms,  etc.)  or  other  problems  (e.g.,  abuse,  neglect,  etc.). \nAdditionally,  AAC  devices  can  be  critical  to  community  placement \nand  independent  living  opportunities.  Contrary  to  generally \naccepted  standards,  Conway  requires  that  a  resident  demonstrate \ncertain skills,  such  as  vision,  ability to  identify objects  or \npictures,  and  imitation of  fine  motor  movements  or  gestures,  as \nprerequisites  to  being  evaluated  to  determine  whether  he  or  she \nwould  benefit  from  an AAC  device.  Additionally,  and  again  in \ncontravention  of  generally accepted  professional  standards, \nnumerous  residents  who  had  been  identified to  receive  training  to \nuse  an  AAC  device  do  not  have  access  to  such  a  device  to  use \nthroughout  their day,  without  which  these  individuals  cannot  learn \nto  communicate  in  a  meaningful  and  functional  context. \n17 \n\n6.  Infection  Control \nConway  staff  follow  infection  control  policies  that  are \noutdated,  unsafe,  and  ineffective  to  prevent  the  spread of \ninfectious  and  contagious  diseases,  placing  Conway  residents  and \nstaff  at  risk  of  harm.  For  example,  Conway's  policy  regarding \nblood-borne  pathogens  is  ten years  old,  and  fails  to  include \nrecently  identified precautions  regarding  the  transmission  of \nblood-borne  pathogens  such  as  hepatitis  and  HIV/AIDS. \nAdditionally,  Conway  permits  up  to  a  two-week  grace  period  from \nthe  time  of  admission  before  administering  the  PPD  to  identify \nresidents  who  might  be  positive  for  tuberculosis.  Conway's \npractice  of  permitting  a  time  lag  of  this  length  has  the  potential \nto  allow  a  case  of  active  tuberculosis  to  go  undetected. \n7.  Medication  Administration \nGenerally  accepted  professional  standards  of  care  require \nthat  the  administration of  medications  be  documented  in a \nMedication Administration  Record  (\"MAR\")  that  reflects  the  dosage \nand  the  actual  time  of  administration.  Conway's  MARs  deviate  from \nthese  standards  of  care.  Specifically,  the  MARs  document  the  time \nwhen  the  medication  is  ordered  to  be  administered,  not  the  time \nthat  the  medication  is  actually administered.  This  permits  the \nactual  time  of  medication  administration  to  go  undocumented  and \nfor  personnel  to  elude  accountability  for  errors. \nB.  HABILITATIVE  TREATMENT  AND  RESTRAINTS \nThe  residents  at  Conway  are  entitled to  reasonable  safety, \nfreedom  from  unreasonable  restraint,  and  habilitative  treatment \nadequate  to  ensure  safety and  facilitate  the  ability to  function \nfree  from  restraints.  See  Youngberg,  457  U.S.  at  324.  Conway's \nhabilitative  treatment  services  and  restraint  practices,  however, \nare  grossly deficient  and  expose  residents  to  substantial  risk of \nharm  and  unreasonable  restraint.  Conway's  activity programming, \nbehavior  programs,  psychiatric  services,  and  restraint  practices \nand  procedures  are  all  critically inadequate. \n1.  Activity  Programming \nAn  essential  component  of  habilitative  treatment  for  persons \nwith  developmental  disabilities  is  the  regular  provision  of \nactivities designed  to  help  them  develop  new  skills  and  practice \nskills  already  learned.  See  42  C.F.R.  §  483.420(6)  (facilities \nparticipating  in Medicaid  must  \"ensure  that  clients  are  provided \n18 \n\nactive  treatment  to  reduce  dependency  on  drugs  and  physical \nrestraints\").  However,  in  the  vast  majority of  units  we  observed \nduring  our  tour  of  Conway,  the  residents  were  not  engaged  in  any \nactivities whatsoever.  For  example,  in  10  Birch,  11  Birch,  14 \nCypress,  15  Cypress,  19  Maple,  21  Birch,  and  25  Cedar,  we \nconsistently observed  few  or  no  activities  for  residents  to  engage \nin,  and  extremely  low  staff-to-resident  interactions.  When \nresidents  are  not  provided  with  adequate  treatment  programming, \nnot  only  are  they  less  likely to  learn  adaptive  behaviors,  but \nthey  also  are  more  likely to  seek  stimulation  through  maladaptive \nbehaviors  such  as  self-stimulation,  withdrawal,  self-injury,  or \nphysical  aggression.  These  maladaptive  behaviors,  in  turn, \nincrease  staff's utilization of  restrictive procedures  such  as \nphysical  restraints  and  psychopharmacological  interventions. \nEven  if meaningful  activities  were  offered  to  Conway \nresidents,  direct  care  staff  in  the  majority  of  the  units  we \nobserved  do  not  possess  the  skills  necessary  to  provide  adequate \nhabilitative  treatment  to  residents.  A  significant  number  of \nstaff  failed  to  demonstrate  competency  in  the  most  basic  skills, \nsuch  as  effectively prompting  residents  and  reinforcing  and \nshaping  appropriate  behavior.  For  example,  we  observed  numerous \ninstances  where  staff  failed  to  intervene  effectively when  a \nresident  exhibited  self-injurious  behavior  (\"SIB\"). \nThe  lack of  adequate  activity programming  at  Conway  is  due, \nin part,  to  the  inadequacy  of  the  training  and  supervision \nprovided  to  direct  care  staff.  Generally  accepted  professional \nstandards  require  structured,  ongoing  performance-based  training \nfor  the  direct  care  staff who  implement  the  treatment  programming, \nand  systematic  monitoring  of  the  direct  care  staff  to  ensure \nproper  and  consistent  implementation.  42  C.F.R.  §  483.430(e) \n(\"The  facility must  provide  each  employee  with  initial  and \ncontinuing  training  that  enables  the  employee  to  perform his  or \nher  duties  effectively,  efficiently,  and  competently\").  Based  on \nour  observations,  Conway  is  not  providing  staff with  this  kind  of \ntraining  or monitoring.  This  places  residents  at  risk  for  poor \nprogram  implementation  and,  in  turn,  inadequate  treatment  and  risk \nof  harm.  At  the  time  of  our  review,  Conway's  director of  staff \ntraining/development  position was  vacant,  further  exacerbating  the \ninadequacy  of  Conway's  staff  training program. \nLikewise,  although  it is  commendable  that  members  of  Conway's \npsychological  staff  participate  in group-monitoring  processes, \nConway  does  not  provide  its psychology  staff with  the  training  and \nsupervision  necessary  for  them  to  provide  adequate  psychological \n19 \n\nand  behavioral  services.  In  particular,  Conway  needs  more \ncentralized  supervision  and  training  of  psychological  examiners \nwith  respect  to  reliable  and  valid  data  collection practices, \nactivity design,  prompting  methods,  rate  and  quality of \nreinforcement,  shaping  of  behavior,  and  the  identification of \nalternative  behaviors.  At  the  time  of  our  review,  the  position  of \nChief  of  Psychology  was  vacant  and  an  off-site psychologist  was \ncovering  the  position.  The  lack  of  a  permanent,  on-site  Chief  of \nPsychology  contributes  to  the  inadequacies  of  the  services \nprovided  by  the  department. \n2.  Behavior  Programs \nConway's  behavior  programs  are  ineffective  and  substantially \ndepart  from  generally  accepted  professional  standards. \nSpecifically,  Conway's  behavior  programs:  (1)  are  based  on \ninadequate  functional  assessmentsi  (2)  are  not  implemented  as \nwritteni  and  (3)  are  not  monitored  and  evaluated  adequately. \nThese  deficiencies  increase  the  likelihood  that  residents  will \nlearn or  continue  to  engage  in maladaptive  behaviors  as  well  as  be \nsubjected  to  unnecessarily  restrictive  interventions  and \ntreatments. \na.  Functional  Assessments \nIn  order  to  develop  an  effective  behavior  program,  generally \naccepted professional  practice  requires  that  psychology  staff \nidentify  the  underlying  function  of  the  resident's  maladaptive \nbehavior  through  an  individualized,  formal  functional  assessment. \nThe  functional  assessments  developed  by  Conway's  psychology  staff \nare  seriously  deficient.  Without  a  thorough  assessment  of  the \nfunction  of  the  resident's  maladaptive  behavior,  including  clearly \nidentified alternative  behaviors  to  supplant  the  function  of  the \nmaladaptive  behavior,  behavior  programs  will  not  be  successful  1n \nmodifying  the  maladaptive  behavior. \nb.  Implementation \nImproper  implementation  of  a  behavior  program  can  lead  to  the \ninadvertent  reinforcement  of  maladaptive  behaviors,  as  well  as  the \nexcessive  use  of  restrictive  treatments.  See  42  C.F.R. \n§  483.430 (e)  (\"Staff  must  be  able  to  demonstrate  the  skills and \ntechniques  necessary  to  implement  the  individual  program  plans  for \neach  client  for  whom  they  are  responsible\").  Throughout  Conway, \nwe  observed  numerous  incidents  of  inadequate  implementation  of \nbehavioral  support  programs. \n20 \n\nOur  observations  of  staff  implementation  of  Barbara  Charles' \nbehavior  program  illustrate the  risk  of  harm  inherent  in  improper \nprogram  implementation.  Ms.  Charles'  behavioral  support  program \nidentifies various  forms  of  SIB,  including  face  slapping,  hand \nbiting,  and  scratching.  Pursuant  to  Ms.  Charles'  program,  direct \ncare  staff  are  to  provide  activities  for  her  at  least  every  15 \nminutes.  When  Ms.  Charles  engages  in  SIB,  her  program  provides \nthat  staff are  to  give  her  a  verbal  prompt  and  graduated  guidance \nto  interrupt  the  SIB.  If  this  is  unsuccessful  in  interrupting  the \nSIB,  Ms.  Charles'  program provides  for  use  of  mechanical \nrestraints  to  prevent  further  SIB.  During  our  observation, \nMs.  Charles  engaged  in SIB  at  least  13  times  in  the  presence  of \nsupervisory staff without  intervention.  There  were  no  activities \noccurring  at  the  time,  and  no  staff  attended  to  her.  As  staff \ncontinued  to  ignore  her,  Ms.  Charles'  rate  and  intensity of  SIB \nincreased.  Only  when  Ms.  Charles  became  extremely  agitated did \nstaff  finally  interact  with  her.  By  intervening  only  at  the  peak \nof  her  episode  of  SIB,  staff  are  inadvertently  reinforcing \nMs.  Charles'  maladaptive  behavior  as  a  means  of  communication. \nFurthermore,  the  more  agitated  she  is,  the  more  likely it  is  that \nshe  will  not  be  responsive  to  redirection which,  in  turn, \nincreases  the  likelihood  that  staff  will  apply  mechanical \nrestraints.  In  this  way,  staff's  failure  to  implement \nMs.  Charles'  behavior program may  lead  to  unnecessarily \nrestrictive  interventions.  See  42  C.F.R.  §  483.430 (e) (3)  (\"Staff \nmust  be  able  to  demonstrate  the  skills  necessary  to  administer \ninterventions  to  manage  the  inappropriate  behavior  of  clients\"). \nc.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nGenerally  accepted professional  standards  of  care  require \nthat  facilities  collect  and  record  accurate,  reliable  data \nregarding  residents  on  behavior  programs.  This  data  should  be \nused  to  evaluate  a  resident's  progress  on  behavior-related goals \nand  to  make  decisions  regarding  future  treatment.  Otherwise, \nresidents  are  in  danger  of  being  subjected  to  ineffective, \ninadequate,  and/or  unnecessarily  restrictive  treatment;  avoidable \ninjuries  related  to  untreated behaviors  and  the  use  of  unnecessary \nrestrictive  interventions;  and  potentially dangerous  and \nunnecessary  side  effects  of  medications. \nMethods  of  data  collection used  at  Conway  do  not  provide \nreliable,  accurate  data.  Conway's  primary  instrument  for  data \ncollection,  the  Behavior  Incident  Report  (\"BIR\"),  is  not \nsufficient  to  provide  useful  data.  For  example,  in  reviewing  a \nBIR,  one  cannot  determine  whether  the  behavioral  incident  involved \n21 \n\nfive  acts  of  SIB  or  50  acts  of  SIB.  Cf.  42  C.F.R.  §  483.440(e) (1) \n(\"Data  relative  to  accomplishment  of  the  criteria  specified  in \nclient  individual  program  plan objectives  must  be  documented  in \nmeasurable  terms\").  Consequently,  the  information  collected  on \nthe  BIRs  do  not  prov~de the  degree  of  accuracy  necessary  for \nmeaningful  program  review  and  analysis. \nOther  methods  of  data  collection used  at  Conway  are  not \nrecorded  on  a  consistent  basis  and,  therefore,  do  not  provide \naccurate  data.  For  example,  on  one  unit  (Poplar  32),  data \ncollection  is  conducted  through  the  use  of  daily notations  on  a \nchalkboard  regarding  an  individual's  behavior.  The  information \ncollected  on  the  chalkboard  is  supposed  to  be  transferred to  a \nmonthly  tally sheet  at  the  end  of  each  day.  When  we  observed  the \nchalkboard,  however,  the  previous  day's  data  had  not  been  erased. \nAs  a  result,  no  data  from  the  current  day  had  been  added  to  the \nchalkboard  at  the  time  of  our  observation.  On-site  review  of  the \nmonthly  tally sheet  revealed  that  data  was  not  available  for  a \nperiod  of  eight  days  (April  1-8,  2003).  Basing  decisions \nregarding  a  resident's  treatment  on  such  invalid data  is not \nconsistent  with  professional  standards  and  places  residents  at \nrisk of  improper  treatment  and  harm. \n3.  Psychiatric  Services \nPsychiatric  services  at  Conway  are  a  source  of  great  concern \nto  us.  Specifically,  Conway  fails  to:  (1)  provide  adequate \npsychiatric  assessment  and  diagnostic  services,  and  (2)  manage \npsychotropic  medications  properly. \na.  Psychiatric  Assessments  and  Diagnoses \nGenerally  accepted professional  standards  of  care  require \nthat  initial  psychiatric  diagnoses  be  based  on  complete \npsychiatric  assessments  in  which  relevant  historical, \nenvironmental,  biological,  social,  psychosocial,  medical,  and \nneurological  factors  and  influences  are  evaluated.  Once  an \ninitial  diagnosis  is  made,  ongoing  assessments  should  be  conducted \nto  ensure  that  timely  re-evaluation  of  the  resident's  condition  is \nmade  and  treatment  adjusted  accordingly. \nConway's  psychiatric  assessments  and  diagnoses  are  seriously \ndeficient.  We  requested  copies  of  psychiatric  assessments  for \nover  70  residents;  none  of  the  records  we  received  contained  an \nadequate  psychiatric  assessment.  Rather,  residents  are  assigned \ndiagnoses  without  any  documentation  of  signs  or  symptoms  to \n22 \n\njustify the  diagnoses.  Nor  is  any  consideration given  to  the \npsychosocial  context  of  symptoms  or  possible  behavioral  treatment. \nMoreover,  in  many  cases,  the  medication  regimen  prescribed  for  an \nindividual  is  not  appropriate  for  the  diagnosis  assigned. \nNumerous  individuals  at  Conway  have  tentative  and  unspecific \ndiagnoses,  listed as  \"not  otherwise  specified\"  (\"NOS\"),  with  no \nevidence  of  further  assessments  or  attempts  to  finalize  the \ndiagnoses.  In  fact,  with  rare  exceptions,  once  a  resident  is \nassigned  an  initial  diagnosis,  this  diagnosis  is  continued without \nany  significant  changes,  ignoring  the  dynamic  nature  of  mental \nillness  and  the  likelihood  that  these  diagnoses  were  not  valid \nwhen  first  established. \nWe  found  a  multitude  of  examples  of  the  assessment  and \ndiagnostic  problems  identified above.  For  example,  John  Black  has \na  diagnosis  of  \"psychiatric  disorder,  NOS.\"  This  is  not  a  valid \ndiagnosis  and  provides  no  legitimate  basis  for  treatment. \nMr.  Black's  record  does  not  contain  a  complete  psychiatric \nassessment,  and  psychiatric  consultation notations  list \nnonspecific  behavior  such  as  \"destruction,\"  \"aggression,\"  and \n\"lability,\"  without  any  evidence  that  attempts  were  made  to obtain \ninformation  regarding  behavioral  or  contextual  factors  that  might \nassist  in  diagnosing  Mr.  Black.  Moreover,  Mr.  Black  also  has  a \ndiagnosis  of  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (\"OCD\").  The  only \nsupport  for  this  diagnosis  in Mr.  Black's  record  consists  of  a \nbrief  notation  stating  \"compulsive-sounding  behavior,\"  such  as \n\"tearing of  mattress,  clothing.\"  This  diagnosis  has  been \ncontinued  for  Mr.  Black  despite  a  failed  medication  trial  that  was \nintended  to  treat  his  \"OCD.\" \nNumerous  other  residents  at  Conway  have  been  assigned \ndiagnoses,  including  dementia  of  Alzheimer's  type,  tic  disorder, \nand  autism,  without  justification.  Barry Goldman,  for  example, \nhas  a  diagnosis  of  \"dementia  of  Alzheimer's  type.\"  A  diagnosis  of \nAlzheimer's  in an  individual  with mental  retardation  such  as \nMr.  Goldman  requires  (i)  the  establishment  of  a  baseline  level  of \ncognitive  functioning,  and  (ii)  the  presence  of  multiple  cognitive \ndeficits,  including  memory  impairment  and  at  least  one  other \nspecific  cognitive  disturbance  in  such  areas  as  language  use, \nability to  carry out  motor  acts,  or  identifying objects.  But \nMr.  Goldman's  diagnosis  appears  to  be  based  on  little more  than \nvague,  anecdotal  staff  reports  of  forgetfulness  and  episodes  of \nconfusion  increasing  to  \"2-3  per month,\"  with  no  assessment  of \nMr.  Goldman's  baseline  cognitive  level,  no  collection of \nhistorical  data,  and  no  effort  to  perform  a  mental  status \n23 \n\nexamination  of  Mr.  Goldman's  cognitive,  language,  and  other \nfunctions.  In  fact,  other  than  one  statement  in  the  psychiatric \nnotes  that  Mr.  Goldman  was  in  a  \"good  mood  today,\"  there  is  no \nindication he  has  ever  been  examined  by  the  psychiatrist  at  all. \nMoreover,  the  report  that  Mr.  Goldman's  confusion  had  increased  to \n2-3  incidents  per month  suggests  an  episodic  course  that  is \ninconsistent  with Alzheimer's  type  dementia,  but  not  inconsistent \nwith  Mr.  Goldman's  other diagnosis  of  seizure  disorder.  There  is \nno  evidence  that  Mr.  Goldman  was  examined  by  a  neurologist  to \ndetermine  whether  his  confusion  is  related  to  his  seizure \ndisorder,  nor  that  a  diagnosis  of  \"delirium,\"  a  serious  medical \ncondition  that  is marked  by  an  episodic  fluctuating  course  of \ndeficits,  was  considered.  Instead,  Mr.  Goldman  was  given  the \n\"definitive\"  diagnosis  of  dementia  of  Alzheimer's  type,  a  serious \nand  untreatable  condition,  preventing  the  evaluation  and  treatment \nof  his  actual  condition  and  restricting his  community  placement \noptions,  given  the  chronic,  unrelenting  course  of  Alzheimer's-type \ndementia. \nThe  deficiencies  identified above  may  be  attributable,  in \npart,  to  Conway's  insufficient  psychiatric  staffing  levels.  At \nthe  time  of  our  tour,  Conway  was  providing  15  hours  per week  of \npsychiatric professional  time  to  serve  the  needs  of  over  225 \nresidents  taking  psychotropic  medications.  Generally accepted \nstaffing  standards  require  at  least  two  full-time  (i.e.,  80  hours \nper  week)  psychiatrists  for  a  caseload  of  this  size. \nConway's  inadequate  diagnostic  services  also  are  due  to  the \nfact  that  Conway's  psychiatrist  does  not  function  as  part  of  the \nresident's  interdisciplinary treatment  team  and,  therefore,  does \nnot  access  this  valuable  tool  in diagnosing  and  treating \nindividuals  who  lack  the  ability to  report  their  inner \nexperiences.  Rather,  the  psychiatrist  relies  on  brief \nobservations  of  the  resident's  behavior  during  office visits  and  a \nverbal  report  provided  to  him  by  the  psychological  examiners. \nBased  on  the  content  of  psychiatric  progress  notes,  this  system \nfails  to  provide  accurate  information  on  the  nature  of  the \nsymptoms  targeted  for  treatment,  the  course  of  these  symptoms,  and \nthe  context  during  which  they  occur. \nFurthermore,  Conway  fails  to  integrate  psychiatric  and \nbehavioral  treatments.  Generally  accepted  standards  require  that \npsychiatric  treatment  be  integrated with  behavioral  treatment  to \nensure  that  the  behavior  targeted  for  treatment  with  medication  is \nthe  result  of  a  psychiatric  disorder  and  not  a  learned  behavior \nthat  is more  appropriately  addressed  with  behavioral  treatment. \n24 \n\nAt  Conway,  there  is  no  regular  exchange  of  data  between  the \npsychological  examiners  and  the  psychiatrist,  even  in  cases  where \nan  individual  has  not  responded  to  repeated  and  continuous  drug \ntreatments.  In  the  absence  of  an  integrated approach,  individuals \nare  at  risk of  receiving  unnecessary  and  excessive  medications \nthat  have  potentially harmful  side  effects  and  deprivation of \nsafer  and  needed  psychosocial  treatment. \nb.  Psychotropic  Medication  Management \nThe  use  of  psychotropic  medication  should  always  be  justified \nby  the  clinical  needs  of  the  resident.  Regular  and  systematic \nreview  and  adjustment  of  medications  should  be  conducted  to  ensure \nthe  continued  effectiveness  of  the  regimen  prescribed.  Further, \nbecause  many  types  of  psychotropic  medications  carry serious  side \neffects,  psychiatric  staff must  carefully monitor  individuals \ntaking  these  medications. \nConway's  psychotropic  medication  management  substantially \ndeparts  from  generally accepted professional  standards.  As \ndiscussed  above,  medication  use  is  based  on  incomplete  psychiatric \nassessments  and  diagnoses  and,  in many  cases,  the  medication  is \nnot  appropriate 'tor  the  diagnosis.  Further,  there  is  no  system \nfor  regularly monitoring  side  effects  or  ensuring  that  medications \nare  being  used  effectively.  In many  cases,  serious  adverse \neffects  on  cognition,  motor  functioning,  behavior,  and  physical \nhealth  are  not  assessed  or  are  ignored  when  present. \nConway  also  fails  to  conduct  adequate  periodic  assessments  of \ntardive  dyskinesia  (\"TD\")  in  individuals  receiving  long-term \nantipsychotic  medications.  TD  is a  serious  and  potentially \nirreversible  and  disabling  movement  disorder  that  occurs  as  a  side \neffect  of  antipsychotic  medications.  Even  when  standardized  tests \nperformed  by  the  nursing  staff  indicate  positive  findings  of  TD, \nthe  psychiatrist  fails  to  review  these  tests  and  take  action based \non  the  presence  of  TD.  Moreover,  the  nursing  staff  are  not \ntrained adequately  to  perform  the  standardized  tests. \nConway's  Pharmacy  and  Therapeutics  (\"P&T\")  Committee  does  not \noperate  in accordance  with generally accepted  professional \nstandards.  Specifically,  it fails  to  perform  some  of  the  core \nfunctions  of  a  P&T  Committee,  including  adequate  monitoring  of \nAdverse  Drug  Reactions  (\"ADRs\"),  Medication  Variance  Reports \n(\"MVRs\"),  and  Drug  Utilization Evaluations  (\"DUEs\").  For \ninstance,  according  to  the  chairman  of  the  P&T  Committee,  no  ADRs \nwere  reported  to  the  Committee  in  the  past  year.  Given  the  size \n25 \n\nof  the  facility,  the  complete  absence  of  ADRs  for  an  entire year \nis  highly  suspect.  The  lack of  monitoring  for  ADRs,  MVRs,  and \nDUEs  deprives  the  facility of  a  systematic  approach  to  the \nidentification of  serious  problematic  trends  and  their  remedies. \nThe  following  are  examples  of  Conway's  failure  to  manage  the \nuse  of  psychotropic  medications  and  their potential  side  effects \nadequately: \n•  Judy  Turner  has  a  diagnosis  of  OCD  and  has  received  treatment \nwith  a  combination  of  an  anticonvulsant/mood  stabilizer and \nan  antipsychotic,  neither  of  which  is  an  appropriate \ntreatment  for  OCD.  Ms.  Turner's  record  indicates  that  her \nsymptoms  worsened  despite  the  treatment.  Furthermore,  the \nanticonvulsant/mood  stabilizer was  continued  for  almost  four \nmonths  despite  the  fact  that  repeated  laboratory  tests \nsuggested  serious  and  life-threatening pancreatic \ndysfunction,  which  is well-known  to  occur with  this \ntreatment. \n•  Bill  Driver  has  diagnoses  of  behavior  problem,  autism,  severe \nmental  retardation,  psychotic  disorder NOS,  pervasive \ndevelopmental  disorder,  OCD  and  TD.  Between  June  2000  and \nApril  2003,  Mr.  Driver was  treated continuously with  the \nantipsychotic  medication,  thioridazine,  and  received \nadditional  treatment  with  another  antipsychotic  medication, \nrisperidone,  for  approximately  two  years.  Both  medications \nhave  the  potential  to  induce  or worsen  TD.  Although  there \nare  safer,  equally effective  antipsychotic  medications \navailable,  there  is  no  documentation  that  any  of  these  were \nconsidered  until  October  2002,  at  which  time  the \npsychiatrist  noted  the  need  to  obtain  consent  from \nMr.  Driver's  mother  for  the  use  of  a  safer antipsychotic \nmedication,  quetiapine.  Nevertheless,  as  of  April  2003,  more \nthan  half  a  year  later,  the  psychiatrist  had  not  prescribed \nquetiapine  treatment  for  Mr.  Driver.  Furthermore,  there  is \nnothing  in  the  record  to  indicate  that  Conway  was  monitoring \nMr.  Driver's  TD  during  extended  trials  with  thioridazine  and \nrisperidone. \n•  Steve  Walker  has  a  diagnosis  of  anxiety disorder NOS,  and  was \nreceiving  treatment  with  an  antidepressant,  fluoxetine;  an \nantipsychotic,  risperidone;  and  an  anticholinergic, \nbenztropine.  Fluoxetine  is  an  appropriate  treatment  for \ndepression  or  panic  attacks,  and  is  known  to  have  the \npossible  side  effect  of  aggression.  Nothing  in Mr.  Walker's \n26 \n\nrecord  indicates  the  presence  of  depression  or panic  attacks. \nFurthermore,  when  Mr.  Walker  subsequently  exhibited \nincreasingly aggressive  outbursts,  Conway's  psychiatrist \nadded  risperidone  to  Mr.  Walker's  treatment  without  any \nindication  that  he  considered  that  the  fluoxetine  may  have \nbeen  causing  or  contributing  to  the  aggression.  Due  to  the \nuse  of  risperidone,  Mr.  Walker  developed  tremors  and, \ntherefore,  an  anticholinergic  medication,  benztropine,  was \nadded  to  treat  the  tremors.  Although  psychiatric \nconsultation notes  state  that  Mr.  Walker  was  \"tolerating \ntreatment  well,\"  nothing  in his  record  indicates  that  he  was \nmonitored  for  the  risks  associated with  anticholinergic \ntreatment,  which  include  bowel  dysfunction  and  further \ndeterioration of  his  already  compromised  cognitive  function. \n4.  Restraint  Practices  and  Procedures \nConway's  use  of  restraints  substantially departs  from \ngenerally accepted  professional  standards  of  care  and  exposes \nresidents  to  excessive  and  unnecessarily  restrictive \ninterventions.  Conway  uses  a  number  of  mechanical  restraint \ndevices  to  control  residents'  behavior,  including  padded  mittens, \nface  guards,  mitten  jackets,  arm  splints,  restraint  jackets, \npapoose  boards,  and  restraint  chairs.  Generally  accepted \nprofessional  standards  dictate  that  such  restrictive \ninterventions:  (a)  will  be  used  only when  persons  pose  an \nimminent  and  substantial  risk of  harm  to  themselves  or  others  or \nin  limited emergency  situations;  (b)  will  be  used  only  after  a \nhierarchy  of  less  restrictive measures  has  been  exhausted; \n(c)  will  be  continued  only when  proven  effective;  (d)  will  not  be \nused  as  punishment,  for  the  convenience  of  staff,  or  in  the \nabsence  of  or  as  an  alternative  to  treatment;  and  (e)  will  be \nterminated  as  soon  as  the  person  is  no  longer  a  danger  to  himself \nor  others.  See  also  42  C.F.R.  §  483.450(b) (3)  (\"Techniques  to \nmanage  inappropriate  client  behavior must  never  be  used  for \ndisciplinary purposes,  for  the  convenience  of  staff or  as  a \nsubstitute  for  an  active  treatment  program.\"). \nConway's  policy does  appropriately provide  that  restrictive \ninterventions  must  be  the  least  restrictive  intervention necessary \nto  \"effectively manage\"  behaviors  and  may  be  used  only  after \npositive  approaches  have  proven  ineffective.  Conway,  however, \ndoes  not  adhere  consistently to  this  policy.  Rather,  staff's \nover-reliance  on  restrictive  interventions  indicates  that  staff \nresort  to  these  interventions  before  attempting  lesser  restrictive \ninterventions.  In  2002,  approximately  90  residents  (or  16%  of \n27 \n\nConway's  residents)  wore  restrictive  devices  or  were  placed  in \nimmobilizing  restraints.  In  one  living  unit,  14  women  were  placed \nin  mechanical  restraints  a  total  of  245  times  in  2002.  Four  of \nthese  residents  were  placed  in  restraints  more  than  half  of  the \ntimes  that  they  engaged  in  a  behavioral  incident.  These  figures \nstrongly  suggest  that  lesser restrictive  measures  either: \n(a)  were  not  utilized prior  to  placing  the  residents  in \nrestraints;  (b)  were  not  given  an  adequate  trial  prior  to \nresorting  to  more  restrictive  interventions;  or  (c)  were \nineffective  and  alternative  lesser  interventions  should  have  been \nattempted.  Staff's  excessive  use  of  restraints  also  reflects  that \nthe  facility  has  failed  to  develop  appropriate  ways  to  treat \nresidents'  problem  behaviors,  and  that  staff utilize  restraints \neither  for  their own  convenience,  to  control  behaviors  in  lieu of \neffective  behavioral  treatment,  or  as  a  result  of  insufficient \nstaffing.  This  is  of  particular concern  given  that  Conway \nidentified approximately  50  vacant  direct  care  and  supervisory \nstaff positions  as  of  April  8,  2003. \nMoreover,  Conway  continues  the  use  of  restrictive \ninterventions  without  modification  even  when  proven  ineffective. \nWhen  a  restrictive  intervention  is  effective  in preventing  or \nlimiting  a  resident's  targeted  behavior,  the  need  for  the \nintervention  should  decrease  over  time.  Conway,  however, \ncontinues  to  utilize highly  restrictive  interventions,  often  for \nescalating periods  of  time,  with  numerous  residents  even  when  the \nrestraint  appears  to  be  ineffective.  For  example,  George  Prescott \nwas  restrained with  arm  splints  for  increasing  periods  of  time \nfrom  January  to  December  2002  (1/02  - 250  minutes;  3/02  - 455 \nminutes;  6/02  - 1010  minutes;  10/02  - 952  minutes;  11/02  - 2805 \nminutes;  12/02  - 1950  minutes).  Similarly,  staff  restrained \nAngela  Hawthorne  on  a  papoose  board  for  escalating periods  of  time \nduring  2002  (1/02  - 55  minutes;  5/02  - 600  minutes;  6/02  - 985 \nminutes;  11/02  - 5612  minutes;  12/02  - 7850  minutes).  The  use  of \nrestrictive procedures  under  these  circumstances  constitutes \neither a  form  of  punishment,  or  the  use  of  restraints  for  the \nconvenience  for  staff,  both  of  which  are  violations  of  the \nresidents'  rights  and  prohibited by  ICF/MR  regulations,  the \nAmerican  Association  on  Mental  Retardation's  policy  statements,  as \nwell  as  Conway's  own  policies. \nWhen  restrictive  interventions  are  included  in  residents' \nbehavior  programs,  generally accepted  professional  standards \ndictate  that  the  need  for  the  intervention must  be  supported  by  a \nformal  functional  assessment  or  data  that  lesser  restrictive \ninterventions  have  proven  unsuccessful.  As  discussed  above, \n28 \n\nConway  does  not  conduct  formal  functional  assessments. \nFurthermore,  although  the  facility collects  data  regarding  the  use \nof  restraints,  it does  not  appear  that  this  data  results  in \nreconsideration  of  alternative  methods  of  dealing  with  the \nresidents'  targeted  behaviors  or modification  of  residents' \nbehavior  programs.  Moreover,  contrary  to  generally  accepted \nstandards,  there  is  no  procedure  whereby  an  increasing  number  of \nrestrictive  interventions  triggers  a  review  of  a  residents' \nbehavioral  treatment  by  the  entire  treatment  team. \nWhether  restrictive  interventions  are  effective  cannot  be \nmeasured  accurately  if  the  behavioral  and  restraint  data  upon \nwhich  treatment  teams  rely  is  not  accurate.  As  discussed  above, \ndata  is not  collected on  a  consistent  basis  at  Conway.  We  found \nnumerous  additional  inconsistencies  in  the  documentation  recording \nthe  use  of  restraints.  For  example,  one  January  2002  report \ndocuments  that  Kristin  Burke  was  restrained  4.5  times  longer  than \nanother  report  for  the  same  month.  A  November  2002  report \nreflects  that  Florence  Snyder  was  restrained with  long  arm  splints \nnearly  three  times  longer  than  another  report  for  that  same  month. \nOn  one  unit,  staff  had  failed  to  record  daily behavioral  data  for \nany  of  the  residents  during  the  month  of  our  visit  and  could  not \ndescribe  the  meaning  of  the  terms  on  the  data  recording  sheet  that \nthey  were  supposed  to  be  utilizing.  The  data  recording  sheet  for \na  resident  on  another  unit  had  not  been  completed  since August \n2002  (i.e.,  eight  months  of  failure  to  record  data)  and  the  unit \nsupervisor  could not  say  whether  he  had  ever  used  the  data \nrecording  sheets.  Given  that  the  psychological  examiners  rely on \nthis  data  to  determine  whether  to  include  or  continue  restrictive \ninterventions  in  residents'  behavioral  programs,  the  accuracy  of \nthis  data  is  essential  to  ensure  that  restraints  are  utilized only \nwhen  necessary  and  effective.  Cf.  42  C.F.R.  §  483.450(b) (2) \n(\"Interventions  to  manage  inappropriate  client  behavior  must  be \nemployed  with  sufficient  safeguards  and  supervision  to  ensure  that \nthe  safety,  welfare  and  civil  and  human  rights  of  clients  are \nadequately protected.\"). \nConway  requires  that  all  behavior  programs  containing \nrestrictive  interventions  be  approved  by  the  treatment  team,  Chief \nPsychologist,  guardian,  physician,  Superintendent,  and  the  Human \nRights  Committee  (\"HRC\"),  which  is  comprised  of  Conway  staff, \ncommunity  representatives,  and  consumer  representatives.  We  found \nthat  the  restrictive  procedures  are  approved  by  the  treatment \nteams,  and  that  the  facility  is  particularly conscientious  in \nsecuring  consents  from  family  members  and  guardians.  Review  of \nthese  programs  by  the  Chief  Psychologist  and  the  HRC,  however,  is \n29 \n\ninadequate.  As  discussed  above,  at  the  time  of  our  review,  the \nposition  of  Chief  of  Psychology  was  vacant  and  an  off-site \npsychologist  had  been  retained  to  review  and  approve  the \nbehavioral  programs.  This  psychologist  is  unfamiliar with  the \nindividuals  whose  programs  he  reviews,  has  little time  for  direct \nobservation,  and  provides  inadequate  supervision  and  guidance  to \nthe  psychological  examiners.  This  arrangement  consequently  leaves \nresidents  without  adequate  review  by  a  licensed professional. \nSimilarly,  the  HRC  fails  to  review  all  available,  relevant \ndata  and  to  consider  lesser  restrictive  alternatives  thoroughly \nprior  to  approving  the  use  of  restrictive  interventions.  The \ncommittee  frequently  fails  to  require  an  explanation of  the  lesser \nrestrictive  techniques  that  have  been  utilized,  question why \nrestraints  continue  to  be  necessary,  and/or  inquire  if  staff  are \nteaching  the  resident  replacement  behaviors  to  reduce  the  need  for \nrestraints.  Moreover,  the  committee  approves  programs  even  when \ndocumentation  does  not  support  the  continuation of  restrictive \ninterventions  or  reflects  that  the  resident  is  suffering  side \neffects  from  the  intervention.  In  fact,  in  2002,  the  HRC  only \ndisapproved  one  program  of  the  158  it reviewed  - this  program  had \nbeen  suggested by  a  family  member.  The  HRC  never  disapproved  a \nprogram  suggested  by  facility  staff. \nC.  PROTECTION  FROM  HARM \nConway  fails  to  provide  basic  oversight  of  resident  care  and \ntreatment  that  is  critical  to  ensuring  the  reasonable  safety of \nits  residents.  In  order  to  maintain  a  reasonably  safe  environment \nfor  residents,  institutions must  have  an  effective  system  for \ndetecting  abuse  and  neglect.  See  42  C.F.R.  §  483.420(d) (1) \n(facilities  participating  in Medicaid  \"must  develop  and  implement \nwritten policies  and  procedures  that  prohibit  mistreatment, \nneglect  or  abuse  of  the  client\");§  483.420(d)(3)  (\"[t]he  facility \nmust  have  evidence  that  all  alleged violations  are  thoroughly \ninvestigated  and  must  prevent  further  potential  abuse  while  the \ninvestigation  is  in progress\").  The  most  fundamental  requirement \nfor  a  minimally  adequate  system  of  oversight  is  a  process  for \ndetermining  a  resident's  cause  of  death.  Another  critical \ncomponent  is  an  \"incident  management  system,\"  i.e.,  a  system  for \nreporting  and  investigating  incidents  involving  serious  injuries \nto  residents,  tracking  and  trending  these  incidents,  and \nimplementing  and  monitoring  corrective  action  to  avoid  future \nincidents.  Additionally,  residents  must  be  afforded  and  advised \nof  their  rights  as  well  as  the  process  for  reporting  violations  of \nthese  rights. \n30 \n\nAs  described  in  detail  below,  the  procedures  employed  at \nConway  for  protecting  residents  from  harm  are  grossly  inconsistent \nwith generally accepted  professional  standards.  Most  alarming  is \nthe  absence  of  any  meaningful  mortality review.  Further,  although \nConway  has  implemented  some  significant  improvements  in  its \nincident  management  system,  serious  deficiencies  remain.  Finally, \nConway  does  not  afford  and  advise  its  residents  of  rights \nnecessary  to  ensure  their safety. \n1.  Mortality  Reviews \nBetween  1993  and  the  time  of  our  review,  75  Conway  residents \ndied.  For  the  vast  majority,  Conway  did  not  identify the  cause  of \ndeath  although  we  requested  this  information.  Morever,  Conway \nfailed  to  conduct  a  mortality  review  or  investigation  for  any  of \nthe  75  deaths.  Without  a  mortality  review  or  investigation,  there \nis  no  way  to  determine  whether  any  of  these  75  residents  died  of \nnatural  causes  or  terminal  illness,  or  whether  they died  as  a \nresult  of  neglect  or  abuse.  Conway's  failure  to  perform \nmeaningful  mortality reviews  is  a  substantial  departure  from \ngenerally accepted  standards  of  care  and  places  all  Conway \nresidents  at  risk of  serious  harm. \nConway  officials  informed  us  that  as  of  late  2002,  a  state \nlevel  panel  began  reviewing  resident  deaths  at  all  of  the  Arkansas \nHuman  Developmental  Centers.  However,  when  we  toured  in May  2003, \nConway  had  not  received  any  minutes  of  the  panel's  deliberations, \nnor  any  documentation,  findings,  or  recommendations  with  respect \nto  the  panel's  reviews.  Without  such  information,  it  is \nimpossible  for  Conway  to  determine  whether  their  residents'  deaths \nare  reviewed,  the  quality and  timeliness  of  the  reviews,  or \nwhether  any  of  the  deaths  are  due  to  abuse  or  neglect.  Given  the \negregious  deficiencies  in medical  care  at  Conway,  discussed  above, \nthe  absence  of  an  accountable  system of  mortality  review  is \nparticularly disturbing. \n2.  Incident  Management \nFacility records  indicate  that  Conway's  residents  are \nfrequently  exposed  to  harmful  incidents.  Specifically,  in  2002, \nConway  generated  approximately  270  incident  reports  involving \nresident  injuries  that  were  either  self-inflicted or  caused  by \nstaff members  or  other  residents.  These  injuries  include,  but  are \nnot  limited  to,  84  abrasions,  bruises,  and  cuts;  77  injuries \nrequiring  staples  or  sutures;  42  bites;  19  small  bone  fractures; \n14  other  fractures;  and  4  incidents  of  choking.  These  reports  do \n31 \n\nnot  include  all  resident  injuries  that  occurred  in  2002  because \nthey  do  not  include  any  incidents  where  the  description  suggested \nthat  the  injury had  a  health-related  cause  (e.g. an  injury caused \n1 \nby  a  fall  during  a  seizure) .  During  this  same  time  period/  the \nfacility  also  reported  45  incidents  involving  allegations  of  abuse \nor  neglect. \nTo  its  credit/  Conway  has  developed  an  incident  management \nsystem  that  has  a  number  of  positive  features.  Specifically/  the \nreporting  policy defines  essential  termsi  it sets  adequate  time \nframes  for  internal  and  external  reporting  as  well  as  the \ncompletion  of  investigationsi  it appropriately addresses  the  need \nto  protect  clients  immediately  from  staff  accused  of  abuse  or \nneglecti  and  it appropriately  requires  the  termination  of  staff \nfound  to  have  abused  or  neglected  residents  as  well  as  the \ntermination  or  discipline  of  staff  who  fail  to  report  or  delay \nreporting  suspected  abuse  or  neglect.  Conway1 s  investigations  of \nserious  incidents  where  abuse  or  neglect  is  alleged  are  conducted \nby  trained  investigators  and  are  generally  comprehensive/ \nappropriate/  and  timely. \nNevertheless/  Conway1 s  investigations  of  serious  incidents \nwhere  no  abuse  or  neglect  is  alleged  substantially depart  from \ngenerally  accepted  standards.  With  rare  exception/  incidents \nwhere  abuse  or  neglect  is  not  alleged  receive  an  informal \n\"administrativen  review  only.  These  informal  reviews  commonly \nconsist  of  a  one-page  synopsis  of  the  incident,  the  attention paid \nto  the  resident 1 S  immediate  needs/  and  any  corrective  actions \ntaken.  They  usually do  not  address  whether  there  is  any  evidence \nof  abuse  or  neglect  and/  if  the  issue  of  abuse  or  neglect  is \nraised  at  all the  Team  Leader  routinely  states  that  there  is  no \n1 \nsuch  evidence.  These  administrative  reviews  are  not  conducted  by \nindependent  investigators.  Rather,  they  are  conducted  by  staff \ndirectly responsible  for  the  supervision  of  the  staff member(s) \ninvolved  in  the  incident.  Furthermore,  the  staff  conducting  the \ninvestigation  are  not  properly  trained  in  investigation \nmethodologies.  The  failure  of  the  facility  to  consider abuse  or \nneglect  and  conduct  comprehensive,  independent  investigations  of \nsuch  serious  injuries  as  fractures/  vaginal  tearing broken  teeth/ \n1 \ncuts  requiring  sutures,  and  bites/  potentially places  residents  at \ngreat  risk of  harm. \nNotably,  the  facility  recently developed  a  policy  to  guide \nthe  investigation of  injuries  of  unknown  origin.  Conscientious \nimplementation  of  this  policy and  the  extension  of  this  policy  to \nserious  injuries  of  known  origin  could  significantly  improve  the \n32 \n\nquality of  Conway's  investigation process  and  protections  afforded \nits  residents. \nBasic  client  protection  also  requires  that  serious  incident \ninvestigations  be  reviewed  by  an  objective  party who  has  the \nexpertise  to  critique  investigations  and  identify necessary \nremedial  actions.  It  is  commendable  that  the  facility's \nsuperintendent  reviews  all  investigations.  However,  to  ensure \nadequate  expertise  and  objectivity,  the  Central  Incident  Committee \nalso  should  review  incident  investigations.  There  is no \ndocumentation  in  the  Committee's  minutes  reflecting  that  such \nreview  is  conducted.  The  lack  of  an  adequate  review  of \ninvestigations  by  parties  not  associated with  the  unit  on  which \nthe  incident  occurred  exposes  residents  to  risk of  harm. \nGenerally  accepted professional  standards  of  care  also \nrequire  that  facilities  track  and  trend  incident  data  to  identify \npotentially problematic  trends/  and  to  identify,  implement,  and \nmonitor  implementation  of  corrective  action.  Conway  purports  to \ntrack  incident  information  and  the  implementation  of  corrective \nactions;  however,  it relies  upon  reports  that  do  not  identify all \nof  the  corrective  actions  proposed  in  response  to  incidents  and \nwhether  the  corrective  actions  were  implemented.  More \nimportantly,  there  is no  documentation  that  these  reports  are \nreviewed  by  the  Central  Incident  Review  Committee  or  other parties \nwho  can  effect  change.  Nor  is  there  any  documentation  that  anyone \nuses  the  information  contained  in  these  reports  to  identify \npersons  who  are  frequent  victims  or  aggressors,  or  to  identify \nenvironmental,  staffing,  or  other  caregiving  deficiencies. \nAppropriate  tracking  and  trending  of  this  information  is  essential \nin protecting  residents  from  future  harm. \nPursuant  to  generally accepted  standards  of  professional \npractice,  Conwayts  incident  management  policy  is  also  deficient  in \nthat  it does  not  include  a  procedure  whereby  residents  who  meet \nspecific  thresholds  concerning  incident  involvement  (i.e., \ninvolvement  in  a  very  serious  incident  or  involvement  in  a  certain \nnumber  of  incidents  over  a  set  period  of  time)  are  flagged  as  \"at \nrisk.\"  When  such  triggers  occur/  it is  essential  that  the \nresident's  treatment  team  convenes  to  review  the  treatment  plan \nand  make  any  necessary modifications. \nSeparately,  although  Conway's  definition of  physical  abuse \nappropriately  includes  the  use  of  restrictive  procedures  as \npunishment,  it  fails  to  include  other misuses  of  these  procedures, \nsuch  as  using  restrictive procedures:  (1)  without  approval; \n33 \n\n(2)  when  lesser  restrictive  measures  are  appropriate;  (3)  for \nunnecessarily  long  periods  of  time;  (4)  for  staff  convenience;  or \n(5)  as  a  substitute  for  active  treatment.  These  procedures,  many \nof  which  are  extremely  intrusive  and  deny  the  resident  all  or \nnearly  all  free  movement,  are  forms  of  physical  abuse  and  should \nbe  treated as  such. \nLastly,  in  order  to  protect  all  residents  from  abuse  and \nneglect,  all  staff  and  residents  must  be  trained  in  the  processes \nfor  reporting  abuse  and  neglect.  Conway's  training  is  inadequate. \nIt  is  commendable  that  every member  of  Conway's  staff  receives \nabuse  and  neglect  training  during  orientation.  Only  direct  care \nstaff,  however,  are  re-trained on  this  issue  during  the  six-month \nre-training program,  and  it is unclear  from  the  documentation  we \nwere  provided  whether  and,  if so,  how  comprehensively  this  is \ncovered  in the  annual  re-training  curriculum.  Moreover,  there  is \nno  formal,  organized  training  in  self-protection  for  the  residents \nat  Conway. \n3.  Residents'  Rights \nIn  order  to  be  reasonably  free  from  harm,  all  residents  of \nfacilities  such  as  Conway  retain certain  rights  and  should be \ninformed  of  these  rights.  Conway  has  developed  a  policy  setting \nforth  the  residents'  rights  and  explains  these  rights  to  residents \nand  their  families  or  guardians  upon  admission.  Although  the \npolicy  identifies  some  aspects  of  appropriate  treatment,  it does \nnot  meet  generally  accepted professional  standards  in many \nimportant  respects.  First,  the  policy does  not  clearly specify \nwhether  a  resident  or  his  guardian  may  consent  to  the  resident's \nparticipation  in  research  studies.  If  a  resident  is  able  to  give \ninformed  consent,  the  decision  to  participate  in  research  studies \nshould  be  the  resident's,  and  not  his  guardian's.  Second,  the \npolicy  states  that  staff  who  are  determined  to  have  abused \nresidents  \"could\"  be  terminated.  This  contradicts  other  facility \npolicies  that  state  that  such  an  employee  \"shall\"  be  terminated \nimmediately.  Third,  Conway's  resident  rights  policy  states  that  a \nresident  may  refuse  medical  treatment  \"unless  such  treatment  is  in \nhis/her best  interest  or  is  necessary  to  preserve  the  individual's \nlife.\"  This  raises  two  problems:  (a)  assuming  that  all  medical \ntreatment  is  in a  resident's  best  interest,  residents  are  deprived \naltogether of  the  right  to  refuse  medical  treatment,  and  (b)  the \npolicy  entirely circumvents  the  ability of  those  residents  who  are \ncapable  of  making  informed  decisions  to  make  decisions  regarding \nend-of-life  issues. \n34 \n\nD.  SPECIAL  EDUCATION \nConway's  provision of  special  education  services  does  not \ncomport  with  federal  law  because  it  fails  to  provide \nindividualized  educational  programs  that  are  reasonably  calculated \nto  enable  students  to  receive  an  appropriate  education.  At  the \ntime  of  our  visit  to  Conway,  there  were  32  residents  who  qualified \nfor  special  educational  services. \nFederal  law  conditions  federal  funding  of  State  special \neducation programs  upon  the  requirement  that  the  State provide  a \nfree  and  appropriate  public  education  (\"FAPE\")  to  all  children \nwith  disabilities  aged  3  to  21  who  reside  in  the  State.  See \nIndividuals  with  Disabilities  Education Act  (\"IDEA\"),  20  U.S.C. \n§  1400  et  ~ The  IDEA  requires  educational  agencies  to  develop \nan  individualized  education program  (\"IEP\")  for  each  child having \na  disability.  The  required  elements  of  the  IEP  include,  but  are \nnot  limited to:  (a)  an  assessment  of  present  levels  of \neducational  performance;  (b)  a  statement  of  the  individualized \nspecial  education,  related  services/  and  supplementary  aids  to  be \nprovided  to  the  child  to  meet  stated objectives  and  goals;  and \n(c)  a  statement  of  how  progress  toward  annual  goals  and  objectives \nis  to  be  measured.  20  U.S.C.  §  1414(d).  The  IEP  must  include  a \nstatement  of  transition  service  needs  for  each  student  with  a \ndisability beginning  at  age  14;  such  transition services  must  be \noutcome-oriented  and  promote  movement  from  school  to  post-school \nactivities/  including  post-secondary  education/  vocational \ntraining,  integrated employment,  continuing  and  adult  education/ \nadult  services,  independent  living  and  community  participation. \nId.  §  14 01 ( 3 0)  (A)  .  The  IDEA  requires  such  \"related services\"  as \nare  necessary  to  permit  the  child  to  benefit  from  instruction. \nId.  §  1401(22) .10  In  addition/  federal  regulations  require  that \nchildren with  disabilities  be  educated  in  the  least  restrictive \nenvironment.  Id.  §  1412(a) (5).  In  short/  the  IDEA  requires \n10  \"Related  services\"  include  transportation and  such \ndevelopmental,  corrective/  and  other  supportive  services \n(including/  but  not  limited  to,  speech-language  pathology  and \naudiology  services/  psychological  services/  physical  and \noccupational  therapy/  recreation,  social  work  and  counseling \nservices,  and  orientation and  mobility  services)  as  may  be \nrequired  to  assist  a  child with  a  disability to  benefit  from \nspecial  education.  The  term  also  includes  school  health \nservices/  social  work  services  in  schools/  and  parent \ncounseling  and  training.  20  U.S.C.  §  1401(22). \n35 \n\n\"access  to  specialized  instruction and  related  services  which  are \nindividually  designed  to  provide  educational  benefit  to  the \nhandicapped  child.\"  Board  of  Educ.  v.  Rowley,  458  U.S.  176,  201 \n(1982). \n1.  Assessments \nUnder  the  IDEA,  Conway  must  conduct  a  comprehensive \nassessment  of  each  qualified  child  to  determine  the  child's \nindividualized  educational  needs.  34  C.F.R.  §  300.320.  Conway's \nassessments  are  out-of-date,  age-inappropriate,  and  do  not  provide \ndiscrete  data  to  identify accurately a  student's  functional  needs \nfor  daily  living  skills.  For  example,  Conway  evaluated  Rob  Quist \nin April  2002  by  utilizing  the  Brigance  Diagnostic  Inventory  of \nBasic  Skills,  a  tool  designed  to  evaluate  readiness,  reading, \nlanguage  arts,  and  mathematics.  The  manufacturers  discontinued \nthis  assessment  tool  in  2001  and  have  removed  it  from  print. \nConway  also  utilizes  regularly  the  Brigance  Diagnostic  Inventory \nof  Early Development  (Birth  to  Seven  Years) .  This  tool  is  not \nage-appropriate  for  Conway's  student  population,  all  of  whom  are \nat  least  11  years  of  age.  In  addition,  Conway  uses  the  Life \nCentered  Career  Education  Modified  Curriculum  for  Individuals  with \nModerate  Disabilities  (LCCEM)  for  six  students.  In  each  of  those \ncases,  assessment  data  derived  from  this  test  was  not  incorporated \ninto  students'  IEP  goals/objectives.  Even  where  a  student  scored \na  zero  (indicating  non-competent)  in a  particular  skill  on  the \nLCCEM,  and  did  so  on  consecutive  yearly  tests,  that  skill  was  not \nlisted as  a  \"need\"  on  the  assessment  summary. \n2.  Individualized  Special  Education  and  Related \nServices \nChildren  with  disabilities  have  the  right  to  individualized \nspecial  education  and  related  services.  34  C.F.R.  §  300.26. \nBecause  of  the  numerous  problems  with  Conway's  assessments, \nConway's  educational  programs  are  fragmented  and  often do  not  meet \neach  student's  individualized needs.  Specifically,  Conway  does \nnot  provide  its  students:  (1)  sufficient  hours  of  instruction; \n(2)  instruction  structured  to  produce  functional  educational \noutcomes;  (3)  access  to  assistive  communication  technology \nnecessary  for  students  to  benefit  from  instruction;  or \n(4)  adequate,  individualized  IEPs. \n36 \n\na.  Amount  of  Instruction \nChildren with  disabilities  residing  in State  facilities \nshould  not  be  denied  services  that  the  State  provides  to  children \nwithout  disabilities.  29  U.S.C.  §  794.  At  the  time  of  our visit, \nthe  scheduled  daily  instructional  time  for  Conway  students  ranged \nfrom  45  minutes  to  three  hours  per  day.  This  amount  of \ninstruction  is  clearly  inadequate  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  Conway \nstudents.  Indeed,  Arkansas  public  schools  are  required  to  provide \nall  students  with  six hours  of  instruction per day.  Moreover,  the \nactual  hours  of  instruction provided  to  Conway  students  are  even \nless  than  the  hours  indicated  on  the  students'  schedules.  During \nour visit,  instructors  and/or  students  frequently  arrived  late  for \nclass  or  terminated  class  early.  For  instance,  although  scheduled \nfor  class  at  10:45  a.m.,  Kris  Norton  did  not  arrive  until  11:11 \na.m.;  Grace  Kendall,s  lesson was  scheduled  at  8:30a.m.,  but  did \nnot  start  until  9:10a.m.;  Becky  Frost,s  lesson was  scheduled  at \n9:00a.m.,  but  did  not  start until  9:30a.m.;  Rob  Quist1 s  lesson \nwas  scheduled  for  9:00a.m.,  but  did  not  start  until  10:00  a.m. \nGail  Brown,s  45-minute  class  lasted on~y six minutes;  Ms.  Frost,s \n45-minute  class  lasted only  one  minute;  Mark  Harrison1 s  45-minute \nclass  lasted only  eight  minutes. \nb.  Quality of  Instruction \nThe  IDEA  requires  that  special  education  services  include \nspecially designed  instruction that  meets  the  unique  needs  of  a \nchild with a  disability.  34  C.F.R.  §  300.26.  Conway,s \ninstructional  methods  fail  to  meet  this  requirement.  Conway  has \nno  specially designed  special  education  curriculum.  Student \ninstruction  is  comprised  of  a  random  set  of  non-functional \nactivities. \nWe  observed  numerous  instructional  sessions  during  our  visit \nthat  demonstrated  that  Conway,s  instruction  is poorly planned  and \nexecuted.  For  instance,  we  observed  that  instructors  do  not \nengage  the  students  to  attend  to  lessons;  teachers  do  not \nappropriately prepare  instruction and  instructional  settings  to \nmaximize  the  students,  learning;  instructors  do  not  re-position \nstudents  who  are  poorly positioned  in  their wheelchairs  to  improve \ntheir  fields  of  vision  or  comfort  levels;  and  teachers  introduce \ninstructional  tasks  and,  within minutes,  either drop  that \ninstruction entirely or  complete  the  task  for  the  student. \n37 \n\nc.  Assistive  Technologies  and  Services \nThe  IDEA  requires  that  IEP  teams  consider  the  communications \nneeds  of  each  child and  whether  or  not  the  child  requires \nassistive  technology  devices  or  services.  34  C.F.R.  §  300.346. \nIf  staff  determine  that  a  student  has  such  needs,  these  needs \nshould  be  included  in  the  student's  IEP.  Despite  the  inclusion of \nan  assistive  communication  device  in their  IEPs,  a  number  of \nConway  students  that  we  observed  did  not  have  access  to  their \ndevices  during  instruction.  Mr.  Quist's  instructor did  not \nutilize his  computerized  communications  device  during  his  lessons \neven  though  his  IEP  requires  this  use.  Although  Marissa  Isaacs' \neducational  objective  is  to  make  choices  via  the  use  of  a \ncommunication  device,  she  did  not  have  access  to  her  communication \ndevice  during  instructional  sessions. \nd.  Individualized  Education  Programs \nThe  IDEA  requires  Conway  to  develop  IEPs  for  each  of  its \nstudents.  34  C.F.R.  §§  300.342-47.  The  IEPs  developed  by  Conway \nstaff  fail  to  identify and  address  appropriately  the  students' \nidentified special  education  and  related  service  needs. \nSpecifically,  the  similarity of  plans  and  objectives  from  student \nto  student  demonstrates  that  many  of  these  goals  and  objectives \nare  not  individualized.  For  example,  despite  the  fact  that \nCarolyn  Biggins'  assessments  reveal  no  limitations  in  identifying \nproduct  labels,  basic  food  groups,  or  functional  safety signs,  her \nIEP  team  has  selected  those  tasks  as  both  her  annual  goals  and \nshort  term objectives.  Ms.  Biggins'  documented  need  in her \nIndividual  Program  Plan  for  additional  skill  development  in  other \nareas,  such  as  improved  fine  motor  skills,  language,  self-help, \nsimple  food  preparation,  money  usage,  and  exercise,  however,  are \nnot  incorporated  into  her  IEP. \n3.  Related  Services \nIn  providing  special  education  to  children with  disabilities, \nthe  State  must  address  each  child's  identified  special  education \nand  related  services  needs.  34  C.F.R.  §  300.300(3) (i).  In \nparticular,  the  IDEA  requires  Conway  to  consider  the  behavioral \nneeds  of  students  when  planning  their educational  instruction. \n34  C.F.R.  §  300.346.  Conway  fails  to  provide  adequate  and \neffective  behavioral  services  to  permit  teachers  to  deal \neffectively with  disruptive  behaviors.  For  example,  during  our \nobservation  of  a  35-minute  class,  we  counted  52  episodes  of  self \ninjurious  behavior  (hitting  his  head  with  his  hands)  by  Gregory \n38 \n\nTamblin.  Although  the  teacher  made  several  attempts  to  block \nMr.  Tamblin,  she  was  unable  to  ameliorate  his  behavior.  The \ninstructor's  inability to  provide  effective  behavioral \ninterventions  to  address  the  student's  behavioral  episodes  in  the \nclassroom  significantly limited his  ability to  benefit  from  class. \nSimilarly,  educational  assessments  for  Mr.  Norton  indicate  that \nhis  behavioral  episodes  prevent  him  from  working  successfully  in \ngroups;  however,  no  strategies  are  incorporated  in his  IEP  annual \ngoals  or  short-term objectives  to  address  his  behaviors.  Despite \ndocumentation  to  the  contrary,  his  IEP  indicated  \"none  needed\"  in \nthe  section on  managing  behavior. \n4.  Annual  Goals  and  Objectives \nThe  IDEA  requires  that  IEPs  contain measurable  annual  goals \nand  objectives,  including  benchmarks  and  short  term  objectives. \n34  C.F.R.  §  300.347.  In  order  to  determine  if a  student  has  met \nthese  goals  and  objectives,  instructors  must  maintain  accurate \ndocumentation  of  each  student's  educational  progress. \nSpecifically,  instructors  should maintain  monthly  educational \nprogress  notes,  including  descriptive  statements  referring  to  the \nIEP  objectives,  the  data  collected  related  to  the  measurement \ncriteria,  and  the  student's  recent progress  to  date. \nRecommendations  to  modify  a  student's  IEP  should  be  based  on  a \nclear  rationale  derived  from  an  analysis  of  this  data. \nConway's  documentation  does  not  contain  the  information \nrequired  to  permit  instructors  to determine  if their  students  are \nprogressing  toward  their goals  and  objectives.  The  lack  of \nreliable  data  for  each  IEP  makes  it difficult,  if not  impossible, \nto  measure  a  student's progress  toward  his  or  her  goals. \nFurthermore,  review  of  individual  records  reveals  that  IEPs \nfrequently  are  not  modified when  a  student  consistently fails  to \nmake  progress  toward  a  stated objective.  For  example,  the  IEPs  of \nJim  Carney,  Gail  Brown,  and  Grace  Kendall  in 2001  and  2002  had \nidentical  objectives  despite  their  lack  of  progress.  It  is \nunacceptable  that  students'  objectives  are  continued  and  program \nplans  are  unrevised  from  one  year's  IEP  to  the  next  when  the \nprogram  has  failed  to  produce  positive  results  and  no  new \ninstructional  strategies  have  been  tried. \n5.  Transition  Services \nThe  IDEA  requires  that  transition  services  be  planned  for \nstudents  above  13  years  of  age.  Such  services  must  be  outcome \noriented,  promoting  transition  from  the  school  setting  to  post-\n39 \n\nsecondary education/  vocational  training/  integrated employment/ \ncontinuing  and  adult  education/  adult  services/  independent \nliving/  and  community  participation.  34  C.F.R.  §  300.29. \nFrequently/  Conway  fails  to  plan  adequately  for  the \ntransition of  its  students.  For  example/  Mr.  Quist  and  Dave \nMoorhouse/  both  age  14 were  denied  transition plans  even  though \n1 \nthe  teams  had  identified a  number  of  desired post-school  outcomes \nfor  them.  Marianne  Forest at  age  18 did  not  have  a  transition \n1  1 \nplan  -- every  transition  service  indicator was  checked  \"none \nneeded.\" \n6.  Least  Restrictive  Environment \nFederal  law  and  regulations  require  that to  the  maximum \n1 \nextent  appropriate/  children with  disabilities/  including  children \nin  institutions  like  Conway receive  educational  services  in  the \n1 \nleast  restrictive  setting.  34  C.F.R.  §  300.550.  Special  classes/ \nseparate  schooling,  or  other  removal  of  children with  disabilities \nfrom  the  regular  educational  environment  may  occur  only  if the \nnature  or  severity of  the  student's  disability  is  such  that \neducation  in  regular  classes  with  the  use  of  supplementary aids \nand  services  cannot  be  satisfactorily achieved.  34  C.F.R. \n§  300.550. \nAlthough  Conway  has  placed  six of  its  32  students  in  the \nlocal  public  school/  there  are  a  number  of  problems  with  this \narrangement.  Of  those  six students/  three  attend  merely  one  hour \nper  day;  the  other  three  attend one  and  one-half  hours  per day. \nOnce  at  the  public  school/  all  educational  services  are  provided \nin  a  Conway-dedicated  classroom.  This  classroom operates \nindependently  from  the  rest  of  the  school  and  is  staffed \nexclusively by  Conway  employees.  Conway  students  do  not \nmatriculate  with  other public  school  students  at  any  time  during \nthe  day.  Moreover,  the  Conway-dedicated  classroom  is  not  an \nappropriate  educational  environment.  Half  of  the  classroom  space \nis  utilized by  the  public  school 1 S  occupational  and  physical \ntherapists,  none  of  whom  provide  services  to  the  Conway  students. \nFurthermore/  the  elementary  school  environment  is  age \ninappropriate  for  the  six Conway  students  who  range  in  age  from  11 \nto  13  years  old generally  the  age  of  middle  school  students. \n1 \nThe  remaining  26  special  education  students  receive  education \nat  the  Conway  facility.  Due  to  an  ongoing  asbestos  abatement \nproject,  several  classrooms  were  not  being  used  at  the  time  of  our \nvisit.  Instructors  were  providing  educational  services  for  many \n40 \n\nstudents  in  the  living units  (bedrooms,  dining  rooms,  and  living \nareas),  often while  other  distracting  activities were  going  on  in \nthe  same  space.  Instructors  only  brought  materials  with  them  that \nthey  could  carry  to  and  from  the  chapel,  which  served  as  a  staging \narea  for  supplies.  As  a  result,  these  students  did  not  experience \nschool  in an  appropriate  setting  and  with  appropriate \ninstructional  materials. \nE.  SERVING  PERSONS  IN  THE  MOST  INTEGRATED  SETTING \nAPPROPRIATE  TO  THEIR  INDIVIDUALIZED  NEEDS \nArkansas  is  failing  to  serve  some  residents  of  Conway  in  the \nmost  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  their  individualized needs, \nin violation of  Title  II  of  the  ADA  and  the  regulations \npromulgated  thereunder.  One  such  regulation  - the  \"integration \nregulation\"- provides  that  \"[a]  public  entity shall  administer \nservices,  programs,  and  activities  in  the  most  integrated  setting \nappropriate  to  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with \ndisabilities.\"  28  C.F.R.  §  35.130(d).  The  preamble  to  the \nregulations  defines  \"the  most  integrated  setting\"  to  mean  a \nsetting  \"that  enables  individuals  with  disabilities  to  interact \nwith  non-disabled persons  to  the  fullest  extent  possible.\" \n28  C.F.R.  §  35,  App.  A  at  450. \nIn  construing  the  anti-discrimination provision  contained  in \nTitle  II  of  the  ADA,  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that \n\"[u]njustified  [institutional]  isolation  .  .  is properly \nregarded  as  discrimination based  on  disability.\"  Olmstead  v. \nL.C.,  527  U.S.  581,  597,  600  (1999).  Specifically,  the  Court \nestablished that  States  are  required  to  provide  community-based \ntreatment  for  persons  with  developmental  disabilities  when  the \nState's  treatment  professionals  have  determined  that  community \nplacement  is  appropriate,  provided  that  the  transfer  is not \nopposed  by  the  affected  individual,  and  the  placement  can  be \nreasonably  accommodated,  taking  into  account  the  resources \navailable  to  the  State  and  the  needs  of  others  with  mental \ndisabilities.  Id.  at  602,  607. \nFurther,  President  Bush,  as  part  of  his  New  Freedom \nInitiative,  has  decreed  it a  major  priority for  his  Administration \nto  remove  barriers  to  equality  and  to  expand  opportunities \navailable  to Americans  living with  disabilities.  As  one  step  in \nimplementing  the  New  Freedom  Initiative,  the  President,  on  June \n18,  2001,  signed  Executive  Order  No.  13217,  entitled  \"Community \nBased  Alternatives  for  Individuals  with  Disabilities.\"  This  Order \nemphasized  that  unjustified  isolation or  segregation  of  qualified \n41 \n\nindividuals  with  disabilities  in  institutions  is  a  form  of \nprohibited discrimination  and  that  the  United  States  is committed \nto  community-based  alternatives  for  individuals  with  disabilities. \nExec.  Order  No.  13217,  §§  1(a)-(c),  66  Fed.  Reg.  33155  (June  18, \n2001) . \nRegrettably,  the  State  of  Arkansas  has  not  taken  adequate \nsteps  regarding:  (a)  community  placements;  (b)  assessments; \n(c)  communication  of  information  on  community  resources  to \nresidents,  guardians,  and  family  members;  and  (d)  execution of  the \ndischarge  process.  At  present,  there  are  too  few  community \nresources  in place  to  meet  the  needs  of  Conway  residents.  In \naddition,  as  a  consequence  of  Conway's  procedures,  individuals  who \ndesire  to  live  in  the  community,  and  who  reasonably  can  be \naccommodated  there,  are  denied  the  opportunity  to  live  and  work  in \nmore  integrated  settings  in violation of  the  State's  obligations \nunder  Title  II  of  the  ADA. \n1.  Inadequate  Numbers  of  Community  Placements \nA  review  of  the  discharges  from  Conway  for  the  past  eight \nyears  reveals  an  extremely  low  number  of  community  placements. \nFrom  1994  through  2002,  Conway  discharged  56  residents,  or  an \naverage  of  6.2  residents  per year.  Based  on  Conway's  average \ncensus  for  those  years,  which  ranged  from  570  to  615  residents, \nConway  discharged  only  about  one  percent  of  its population yearly \nover  that  period.  Moreover,  only  13  of  these  56  discharges  were \nto  community  placements  in Arkansas,  or an  average  of  1.4 \nresidents  per  year.  In  fact,  of  the  38  discharges  from  Conway \nsince  2000,  many  merely  represent  a  transfer of  the  resident  from \nConway  to  another  institutional  setting such  as  a  nursing  home, \nhospice,  or  another  human  development  center. \nIn  2003,  only  nine  of  the  approximately  550  Conway  residents \n(1.6%)  had  been  referred  for  residential  placement  out  of  the \ninstitution.  Of  the  nine,  one  has  been  on  the  waiting  list  for  22 \nyears,  and  three  others  have  been  on  the  list  for  more  than  six \nyears.  Not  one  of  the  62  persons  who  have  been  admitted  to  Conway \nsince  1993  has  been  placed  or  recommended  for  placement  in  a \ncommunity-based  facility.  The  pace  by  which  Conway  discharges \nresidents  to  community  placements  is  inadequate,  and  subjects \nresidents  to  continued  unnecessary  isolation  in  the  institution. \n42 \n\n2.  Inadequate  Assessment \nGenerally  accepted  standards  regarding  the  transition of \npersons  with  developmental  disabilities  who  reside  in  institutions \nto  the  community  require  that  treatment  teams  carefully evaluate \nthe  needs  of  each  individual  by  taking  into  account  the  person's \nstrengths,  limitations,  and  preferences,  and  identify services  to \nbe  provided  in  the  most  integrated  setting appropriate  to  the \nindividual's  needs.  Conway  has  no  comprehensive  facility policy \nby  which  to  guide  transitions  from  the  institution to  community \nliving  arrangements.  Without  such  a  roadmap  on  how  to  construct \nan  appropriate  placement,  transition planning  is  inconsistent  and \nineffective. \nContrary  to  the  requirements  of  the  ADA,  Conway's \ninterdisciplinary  teams  appear  to  endorse  the  retention of \nindividuals  in  the  institution.  The  teams  do  not  develop  complete \nanalyses  of  how  and  where  each  resident  can  be  appropriately \nserved  in  the  most  integrated  setting.  For  example,  in  2003, \nBrian  Featherston's  treatment  team  determined  that  Conway  remained \nhis  most  integrated  setting because  he  \"continues  to  benefit  from \nthe  services  and  training provided  at  CHDC,n  and  he  \"has  lived \nhere  for  many  years  and  considers  this  his  home.n  Neither  of \nthese  reasons  justifies  continued  isolation  in an  institutional \nsetting.  The  team  did  not  discuss  any  plans  to  explore  options  1n \nthe  community  with  Mr.  Featherston's  guardians,  and  did  not \nexplain  its reasons  for  determining  that  he  is  not  appropriate  for \ninclusion  in  the  Medicaid  waiver  program.  In  short,  the  team \nfailed  to  provide  a  comprehensive  assessment  regarding  the  most \nintegrated  setting  in which  Mr.  Featherston  can  be  appropriately \nserved. \nInterdisciplinary teams  assert  that  Conway  is  the  most \nintegrated  setting even  for  those  residents  who  have  communicated \ntheir desires  for  community  placement.  For  example,  despite  Holly \nDiNardo's  stated goal  to  live  in  a  home  or group  home, \nMs.  DiNardo's  program plan  states  that  Conway  remains  her  most \nintegrated  setting.  Her  plan  catalogues  numerous  self-care  and \ndaily  living  skills which  she  demonstrates  daily,  including \ngrooming  and  personal  hygiene,  clothing  selection,  laundry  skills, \nhelping  staff with  chores,  and  running  errands  for  staff. \nMs.  DiNardo  also  has  three  jobs  on  Conway's  campus.  In view  of \nthe  array of  skills  that  Ms.  DiNardo  possesses,  the  conclusion \nthat  Conway  is  her  most  integrated  setting  is  highly questionable. \n43 \n\nEven  where  a  treatment  team  recommends  that  community \nplacement  is  appropriate  for  certain residents,  there  is  no \nevidence  that  Conway  actively pursues  community  placement.  For \nexample,  despite  Conway's  1997  recommendation  that  Peggy  Gandy \ntransfer  to  the  community,  Ms.  Gandy  remained  institutionalized at \nConway  as  of  February  2003.  Pre-1997  placements  in  community \nresidences  were  not  successful  for  Ms.  Gandy,  but  her  team  did  not \ndiscuss  why  her prior placements  were  unsuccessful,  and  did  not \ndevelop  measures  to  improve  the  chance  of  her  future  success  in \ncommunity  placements.  Her  August  2002  plan  noted  that  she  had \n\"significant  strength  in  community  living  skills  in  that  she \nunderstands  how  to  access  many  community  services\"  and  that  she  is \n\"unhapp[y]  with  her  placement  at  Conway.\"  Given  the  unreasonably \nslow  response  to  its 1997  recommendation,  the  treatment  team  has \nneglected  its  responsibility to  support  Ms.  Gandy  in her  desire \nfor  successful  community  placement  through  the  development  of  a \ncomprehensive  transition plan.  Similarly,  Conway  professionals \nrecommended  Georgia  Weston  for  community  placement  in  September \n1996i  her  September  2002  plan  suggests  \"possible  placement  in  a \nsmall  IF/MR  in  the  community.  .  during  the  next  3-5  years.\" \nThis  is not  an  acceptable  time  frame.  Glynis  Martin  was \nrecommended  for  community  placement  23  years  ago,  yet,  according \nto  her  February  2002  plan,  her  need  for  support  in ambulation  and \npersonal  skills,  and  for  follow-along  medical,  speech,  and \noccupational  therapy  services  has  prevented  her  from  leaving  the \ninstitution.  There  is no  evidence  that  Ms.  Martin's  treatment \nteam  has  developed  an  adequate  transition plan  for  her  during  the \npast  nearly quarter  of  a  century. \n3.  Inadequate  Information  on  Community  Resource \nGenerally  accepted  professional  standards  mandate  that,  in \norder  for  individuals,  and,  as  appropriate,  their  families  or \nguardians,  to  make  informed  choices  about  placement  in  the \ncommunity,  staff must  provide  them  with  adequate  information  about \ncommunity  options  and  resources.  The  decision whether  to  remain \nin  the  institution or  to  transfer  to  a  community-based  program  is \nnot  meaningful  if  it is not  an  informed  decision.  Conway  does  not \nensure  that  residents  and  their  families  or guardians  are  fully \ninformed.  Staff  does  not  provide  adequate  opportunities  for \nresidents  and  their  families  or guardians  to  experience  and  learn \nabout  alternative  living arrangements,  community  day  programs,  and \ncommunity  employment  options.  Although  Conway  arranged  leisure \nand  recreational  visits  into  the  community  during  the  period  from \nJanuary  2002  to April  2003,  there  were  no  documented  visits  to \nother  residential  settings  or  employment  sites  to  provide  an \n44 \n\nawareness  of  the  variety of  choices  that  would  be  available  to \nresidents.  Indeed,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Conway  has  provided \nany  educational  opportunities  regarding  community  options  to \nseveral  of  the  individuals  and  their  families  or guardians  who \nhave  been  on  the  wait  list  for  placement  for  many  years. \n4.  Inadequate  Discharge  Process \nSuccessful  implementation  of  community  transition depends  on \nthe  development  of  a  transition plan  that  incorporates  the \nfollowing  elements:  a  current  individualized plan;  current \nassessments  of  skill  areas;  special  consultation  reports  to \nevaluate  special  needs,  where  appropriate;  an  action plan \nidentifying  needed  individual  supports  in  the  community  along  with \ntimelines  by  which  specified  staff are  to  develop  the  supports; \nidentification of  personal  preferences  for  home,  school,  leisure, \nand  work;  identification of  staff  training  needed  in the \ncommunity,  including person-specific  training  to  be  provided \nbefore,  during,  and  after transition;  identification of  necessary \nfiscal  resources;  a  list of  all  assistive  devices  being  used \ncurrently or  still needed  for  placement  to  occur;  a  list of \nactivities  to  be  completed  before,  during,  and  after  transition; \nand  requirements  for  \"follow  alongn  after a  placement  has \noccurred. \nDischarge  planning  summaries  prepared  by  Conway  frequently \nare  not  comprehensive.  Based  on  a  review  of  discharge  records, \nsummaries  are  essentially lists.  They  do  not  provide  details  on \nthe  specific  individualized  service  for  each  need  identified.  For \nexample,  Ms.  Martin's  discharge  plan  is  not  sufficiently \ncomprehensive  to  assist  Ms.  Martin,  Conway,  or  community  providers \nin making  a  successful  community  transition.  Specifically, \nMs.  Martin's  discharge  summary  lists  the  following  services  needed \nfor  transition:  attendant  for  personal  care,  grooming,  and \nhygiene;  transportation;  communication  facilitation;  work  skills \ntraining  and  supervision;  recreational  services;  and  occupational, \nphysical  and  speech  therapy.  Without  more  detail  regarding  these \nservices  and  the  identification of  a  specific  staff  member  who  is \nassigned  to  secure  each  service,  a  successful  transition  is \nunlikely  to  occur.  The  absence  of  a  comprehensive  community \ntransition plan  has  the  potential  to  significantly delay  timely \ntransition and  can  result  in  failed  community  placement. \n45 \n\n5.  Inadequate  Community-Based  Services \nWe  applaud  the  efforts  that  have  been  expended  in Arkansas  to \ndevelop  an  Olmstead  Plan  to  address  the  development  of  additional \ncommunity  resources.  However,  the  current  lack of  community-based \nservices  to  address  fairly  typical  needs  of  persons  with \ndevelopmental  disabilities  severely hampers  the  State's  ability to \nserve  persons  in  the  most  integrated  setting appropriate  to  their \nneeds.  According  to  Conway  staff,  small  Intermediate  Care \nFacilities  for  the  Mentally  Retarded  (ICF/MR),  and  group  homes  in \nArkansas  do  not  have  the  capability to  deal  with  persons  who  are \nbehaviorally  challenged,  and  it  is  difficult  to  arrange  community \nservices  for  medically  challenged  people.  Conway  staff  report \nthat  in order  for  a  resident  of  Conway  to  transition to  a \ncommunity-based  home,  he  or  she  must  be  able  to  take  medication, \nhave  behaviors  under  control,  and  be  independent  in  self-care  and \ndaily  living  skills.  Arkansas'  lack  of  community  resources  for \npersons  with  developmental  disabilities  thwarts  the  implementation \nof  treatment  teams'  decisions  recommending  community  placement. \nWhere  community  transition does  occur,  the  State  should \nprovide  adequate  follow-along  services.  See  Armstead  v.  Coler, \n914  F.2d  1464,  1467  (11th  Cir.  1990);  Thomas  S.  v.  Brooks,  902  F.2d \n250,  254-55  (4th  Cir.  1990);  Halderman  v.  Pennhurst  State  Sch.  and \nHosp.,  834  F.  Supp.  757,  766  (E.D.  Pa.  1993).  This  component \nshould  include  face-to-face  visits with  the  former  resident; \ninterviews  with  staff,  family,  and  guardians;  and  careful  review \nof  the  individual's  records.  Staff  from  Conway  should  utilize \nmeasurable  criteria by which  to  ensure  that  the  individual  is  safe \nand  healthy  in  the  new  environment,  and  that  the  transition  is \nbeing  implemented  as  planned.  Conway's  follow-along  is primarily \nvia  telephone  contact  and  lasts  only  three  months  after  the \nresident's  placement.  This  procedure  is  not  sufficient  to  ensure \nthat  the  individual  is  safe  in  the  new  residence  and  that  the \ntransition has  been  appropriate  and  successful. \nIII.  REMEDIAL  MEASURES \nTo  remedy  the  identified deficiencies  and  protect  the \nconstitutional  and  statutory rights  of  Conway  residents,  Arkansas \nshould  implement  promptly,  at  a  minimum,  the  remedial  measures  set \nforth  below: \n46 \n\nA.  Health  Care \n1.  Provide  appropriate  medical  care  to  all  residents, \nincluding  routine  screening  and  preventive  care,  and \nmedical  assessment  and  treatment,  in  a  timely  and \non-going  basis. \n2.  Develop  and  implement  an  adequate  documentation \nsystem  that  ensures  timely,  accurate,  and  thorough \nrecording  of  all  medical  and  nursing  care  provided \nto  each  resident. \n3.  Ensure  that  all  staff  in direct  contact  with \nresidents  are  regularly  certified  in carpio \npulmonary  resuscitation. \n4.  Provide  appropriate  neurological  and  epileptological \ncare  for  all  residents  with  seizure  disorders, \nincluding  assessment,  diagnosis,  and  medication \nmanagement. \n5.  Develop  an  appropriate  and  comprehensive  system  for \nscreening,  identifying,  assessing,  supporting,  and \nmonitoring  residents  with  physical  and  nutritional \nsupport  needs.  Provide  safe  and  appropriate  seating \nsystems,  alternate positioning  and  AAC  devices,  and \nmealtime  support  plans  to  all  residents  with  an \nidentified need.  Ensure  that  staff  responsible  for \nscreening,  identifying,  assessing,  transferring, \nsupporting,  and  monitoring  residents  with physical \nand  nutritional  support  needs  are  trained  and \nsupervised  adequately  on  an  on-going  basis. \n6.  Ensure  that  the  physical  space,  staffing,  and \nsupervision during  mealtimes  are  sufficient  to \naccommodate  each  resident's  specialized needs  and \nensure  the  safety of  all  residents. \n7.  Develop  a  comprehensive  assessment  system  for \nresidents  in need  of  occupational  therapy,  physical \ntherapy,  and  communication  services.  Provide  a \nsufficient  number  of  appropriately  trained  staff, \nadequate  resources,  and  quality assurance  programs \nto  ensure  the  provision of  appropriate  physical \ntherapy,  occupational  therapy,  and  communication \nservices. \n47 \n\n8.  Develop  and  implement  an  effective  infection control \nprogram. \n9.  Develop  and  implement  a  safe  and  effective  system of \nmedication  administration. \n10.  Develop  and  implement  an  appropriate  quality \nassurance  program  for  medical  care. \nB.  Habilitative  Treatment  and  Restraints \n1.  Provide  residents  with  habilitation,  training,  and \nbehavioral  programs  that  are  adequate  to  protect \nresidents'  personal  safety and  prevent  unreasonable \nuse  of  restrictive  interventions. \n2.  Ensure  that  psychology  staff  are  trained  and \nsupervised  adequately.  Provide  on-going  competency \nbased  training  for  all  psychology,  supervisory,  and \ndirect  care  staff  in  treatment  and  behavioral \ninterventions  and  data  collection,  including  the \nproper  use  of  restraints. \n3.  Ensure  that  psychiatric  staffing  levels  are \nsufficient  to  meet  the  needs  of  residents. \n4.  Ensure  that  all  residents  receiving  psychotropic \nmedications  receive  effective  psychiatric  services, \nincluding  assessment,  diagnosis,  and  medication \nmanagement,  on  a  timely  and  on-going  basis. \n5.  Ensure  that  only  the  least  restrictive  restraint \ntechniques  necessary  are  utilized,  and,  except  in an \nemergency,  that  restraints  are  used  only  in \nconnection with  a  behavioral  treatment  program  and \nnever  as  punishment  or  for  the  convenience  of  staff. \n6.  Provide  quality assurance  programs  to  ensure  that \nrestraints  are  used  effectively and  properly. \nEnsure  that  ineffective  behavior  programs  are \nmodified  or  replaced  in  a  timely manner. \n48 \n\nC.  Protection  from  Harm \n1.  Ensure  that  an  adequate  mortality review  is \nconducted,  and  findings  and  recommendations  are \ndocumented,  for  every  resident  death. \n2.  Develop  an  adequate  system  for  investigating, \ntracking,  and  managing  incidents  of  resident  injury \nand  ensure  that  all  staff  and  residents  are  trained \nadequately on  processes  for  reporting  abuse  and \nneglect.  Provide  quality  assurance  programs  to \nensure  the  reasonable  safety and  rights  of \nresidents. \nD.  Special  Education \n1.  Provide  adequate  special  education  services  for  all \nqualified  residents  in  compliance  with  the  IDEA. \nE.  Serving  Persons  in  the  Most  Integrated Setting \nAppropriate  to  Their  Individualized  Needs \n1.  Ensure  that  all  residents  are  regularly and \nappropriately assessed  to  determine  whether  they  are \nreceiving  services  in  the  most  integrated  setting \nappropriate  to  their  individualized  needs  in \naccordance  with  the  ADA.  Provide  adequate  education \nabout  available  community  placements  to  residents \nand  their  families  or guardians  to  enable  them  to \nmake  informed  choices.  Provide  adequate  staff \ntraining  and  resources  to  ensure  timely  and  adequate \ntransition planning. \n***** \nWe  hope  to  continue  working  with  the  State  in  an  amicable  and \ncooperative  fashion  to  resolve  our  significant  concerns  regarding \nthe  care  and  services  provided  at  Conway.  We  will  be  sending  to \nyou  under  separate  cover  our  consultants'  evaluations  of  Conway. \nAlthough  their  reports  are  their work  - and  do  not  necessarily \nrepresent  the  official  conclusions  of  the  Department  of  Justice  -\ntheir observations,  analyses,  and  recommendations  provide  further \nelaboration of  the  issues  discussed  in  this  letter and  offer \npractical  assistance  in addressing  them. \n49 \n\n",

In response, the defendants have filed a motion to strike the United States’ motion for\npreliminary injunction, arguing in part that the United States’ delay in seeking a preliminary\ninjunction belies any claim of irreparable harm.  The United States has responded to the defendants’\nmotion to strike.2  For the following reasons, the United States’ motion for a preliminary injunction\nis denied.\nI.\nThe Conway Human Development Center (CHDC), located in Conway, Arkansas, is certified\nas an Intermediate Care Facility for the Mentally Retarded (ICF/MR) and houses approximately 510\nindividuals with developmental disabilities.  On November 8, 2002,t he Civil Rights Division of the\nDepartment of Justice informed the State of Arkansas of its intent to conduct a formal investigation\ninto the conditions at CHDC pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA),\n42 U.S.C. § 1997.  The Civil Rights Division conducted onsite inspections in February, April, and\nMay 2003 with expert consultants from various professional backgrounds.  In addition to the site\nvisits, the Civil Rights Division reviewed policies and procedures, interviewed administrators and\nstaff, and observed CHDC residents.  The CiviRl ights Division conveyed preliminary findings after\neach site visit in February, April, and May 2003.\nOn April 21, 2004, Assistant Attorney General R. Alexander Acosta issued a 50-page letter\nreporting the findings of the Civil Rights Division.  Those findings included the following:\n2 Although the defendants characterize their response as a motion to strike and ask for an\nextension of time to respond more fully, their motion to strike provides a substantive response to\nthe United States’ arguments for a preliminary injunction.  Therefore, the Court will treat the\ndefendants’ motion to strike as a response to the motion for preliminary injunction, and the\nUnited States’ response to the motion to strike as a reply to the defendants’ response.\n2\n\n[W]e find that residents of [ CHDC] suffer significant harm or risk of harm from\nshortcomings in the facilities’ health care, habilitative treatment services, restraint\npractices, and protection from harm policies.  We further find that the State fails to\nprovide residents with required education services pursuant to the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1401 et seq.  Finally, it appears\nthat the State does not provide services to individuals with disabilities in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to individual residents’ needs.  See Olmstead v. L.C.,\n527 U.S. 581 (1999); Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42\nU.S.C. §§ 12132 et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §\n794; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d).\nThe 50-page document then went on to describe in detail the bases for the findings.\nOn January 16, 2009—more than six years after initiating its investigation of CHDC, and\nalmost five years after issuing its findings from the investigation—the United States commenced the\ninstant action against the defendants.  The complaint alleges that the defendants have failed and are\ncontinuing to fail to do the following:\na. Provide reasonably safe conditions and ensure the reasonable safety and\npersonal security of CHDC residents.\nb. Provide the CHDC residents with that level of habilitation and training,\nincluding behavioral and related training programs, necessary to protect the\nresidents’ liberty interests and ensure their safety and freedom from undueo r\nunreasonable restraint.\nc. Ensure that restraints are administered to residents by appropriately qualified\nprofessionals in keeping with accepted professional standards, and are not\nused as punishment, in lieu of treatment, or for the convenience of staff.\nd. Adequately supervise residents in restraints to protect them from harm.\ne. Adequately assess individuals residing in the CHDC to ascertain whether they\nare receiving treatment in the most in tegrated setting appropriate for their\nindividual needs.\nf. Ensure that residents whom professionals determine should be placed in the\ncommunity, and who do not oppose such placement, are placed there.\n3\n\ng. Ensure that residents are evaluated and provided the necessary support and\nservices to receive a free and appropr iate public education in the le ast\nrestrictive environment.\nh. Provide adequate psychological and behavioral services; adequate medical,\nneurological, and nursing services; adequate psychiatric services; adequate\nhabilitation and therapy services, including physical therapy, occupational\ntherapy, speech and language therapy, and nutritional services; and adequate\nprotections from harm.\nThe complaint then alleges violations of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process protections; the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act; and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\nFinally, on March 9, 2010—more than one year after filing its complaint, and more than\nseven years after initiating its investigations into the CHDC—the United States filed the pending\nmotion for a preliminary injunction.  The United States filed its motion only after its experts\ncompleted their reports.  According to the United States, immediate injunctive relief is \nnecessary to stop ongoing, severe, and irreparable harm.  That relief must target the\nconditions at CHDC that place all residents at the most imminent risk—conditions\nthat have led to death, organ failure, and exposure to lethal side effects of medication\nand have exposed individuals to needless and harmful restraints—while requiring\nthat the State ensure that no more of its youngest and most vulnerable citizens are\nexposed to this unsafe and inappropriately segregated institutional environment.\nThe United States asserts that the delayed timing of its motion is due, in part, to only recently\nobtained “substantial and alarming evidence that CHDC residents face increasing and grave risk of\nharm with each and every day that deficiencies are ignored.”  This evidence includes emails\nproduced in late 2009 documenting the defendants’ intention to increase the number of children\nhoused in state institutions; an incident in October 2009 in which a resident was hospitalized for\nlithium poisoning; and an admission in December 2009 from the CHDC’s Chief of Psychology that\napproximately 70-80 CHDC residents have treatment programs that include restraint use. \n4\n\nII.\nIn considering whether to grant a preliminary injunction, a court must consider four factors:\n(1) the probability that the movant will succeed on them  erits; (2) the threat of irreparable harm; (3)\nthe state of balance between the threat of harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict\non other parties; and (4) the public interest.  Dataphase Systems, Inc. v. C L Systems, Inc., 640 F.2d\n109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981).  The district court’s inquiry is an equitable one, requiring the court to\nconsider “whether the balance of equities so favors the movant that justice requires the court to\nintervene to preserve the status quo until the merits are determined.”  Velek v. Arkansas, 198 F.R.D.\n661, 663 (E.D. Ark. 2001) (quoting Dataphase, 640 F.2d at 113).  No single factor is determinative,\nand the factors are not a rigid formula.  Id.  The party seeking a preliminary injunction bears the\nburden of proving that an injunction is necessary, and the decision to grant or deny the preliminary\ninjunction is within the broad discretion of the district court. Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496,\n503 (8th Cir. 2006); Gelco Corp. v. Coniston Partners, 811 F.2d 414, 418 (8th Cir. 1987). \nA. THREAT OF IRREPARABLE HARM\nHaving carefully considered the parties’  arguments and supportive case law, the Court\nconcludes that the United States’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief turns on the second\nDataphase factor, the threat of irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.  “Perhaps\nthe single most important prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction is a demonstration\nthat if it is not granted the applicant is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision on the\nmerits can be rendered. . . .”  11A C HARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER, & MARY KAY\nKANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2948.1, at 139 (2d ed. 1995).  “There must  be a\nlikelihood that irreparable harm will occur. ..  . [A] preliminary injunction will not be issued simply\n5\n\nto prevent the possibility of some remote future injury.”  Id. § 2948.1, at 153-55; see also Kaplan\nv. Bd. of Educ. of City Sch. Dist. of City of New York, 759 F.2d 256, 259 (2d Cir. 1985) (predictions\nof havoc and unrest were too speculative to constitute clear showing of immediate irreparable harm).\nThe United States has delayed moving for injunctive relief for a significant period of time\nafter it knew of the conditions at the CHDC of which it now complains.  “A long delay by plaintiff\nafter learning of the threatened harm may be taken as an indication that the harm would not be\nserious enough to justify a preliminary injunction.”  11A C HARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R.\nMILLER, & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 2948.1, at 156 and n.12 (2d\ned. 1995); see also Klauber Bros., Inc. v. Lady Marlene Brassiere Corp., 285 F. Supp. 806, 808\n(D.C.N.Y. 1968) (where plaintiff was aware of defendant’s activities for about one year prior to\nfiling the lawsuit, plaintiff’s inaction disentitled it from receiving a preliminary injunction); Poe v.\nMichael Todd Co., 151 F. Supp. 801, 803 (D.C.N.Y. 1957) (that the plaintiff waited three months\nafter filing suit to move for injunctive relief was a factor militating against granting preliminary\ninjunction).  As the Second Circuit has stated:\nThough . . . delay may not warrant the denial of ultimate relief, it may , standing\nalone, preclude the granting of preliminary injunctive relief because the failure to act\nsooner undercuts the sense of urg ency that ordinarily accompanies a motion for\npreliminary relief and suggests that there is, in fact, no irreparable injury.  Although\ndelay may not negate the presumption of irreparable harm if the delay was caused by\nthe plaintiff’s ignorance of the defendant’s [conduct], if it is not so explainable, delay\nalone may justify denial of a preliminary injunction.\nTough Traveler, Ltd. v. Outbound Products, 60 F.3d 964, 968 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotes,\ncitations, ellipses omitted); see also Hubbard Feeds, Inc. v. Animal Feed Supplement, Inc., 182 F.3d\n598 (8th Cir. 1999) (affirming the district court’s determination that the plaintiff’s delay in objecting\n6\n\nto the defendant’s use of its product “belies any claim of irreparable injury pending trial”) (citing\nTough Traveler, 60 F.3d at 968).\nThe Court does not take lightly the seriousness of the accusations in the United States’\ncomplaint and motion for preliminary injunction.  The second Dataphase factor is not, however, a\nmatter solely of the seriousness of the allegations; the issue is whether harm will be irreparable but\nfor immediate Court intervention.  The United States has moved for a preliminary injunction more\nthan seven years after it started investigations; almost six years after issuing its findings on the\ninvestigations; almost fourteen months after the complaint was initially filed; approximately six\nmonths after its experts completed weeks of onsite investigations at the CHDC; and only six months\nin advance of a potentially  month-long trial on the merits.3  By its own de lay in requesting a\npreliminary injunction, the United States has tacitly shown that it does not believe the threat of\nirreparable harm is so great as to warrant preliminary injunctive relief.  Based on the record, the\nUnited States cannot say that its delay was caused by its ignorance of the defendants’ conduct, Tough\nTraveler, 60 F.3d at 968, so its delay suggests that there is, in fact, no danger of irreparable harm\nabsent Court intervention.  Moreover, the fact that trial on the merits is near minimizes the danger\nthat irreparable harm will occur before a decision is reached on the merits.\nThe Court has carefully reviewed the allegations contained in the United States’ 50-page\nfindings letter, the complaint, and the motion for preliminary injunction.  The allegations in the\nmotion for preliminary injunction are in substance the same as the allegations in the 2004 findings\nletter.  The Court has also carefully reviewed the declarations and reports of the six experts engaged\nby the United States.  Each expert conducted an onsite investigation over a period of days between\n3 The trial is scheduled to begin on September 8, 2010.\n7\n\nJuly and September of 2009.  Each epxert severely criticizes the CHDC.  None, however,o pined that\nthe deficiencies at the CHDC created an emergency situation that needed to be rectified immediately.\nHad any of the experts observed an emergency situation that needed to be corrected immediately,\none would have expected a motion for preliminary injunction accompanied by an affidavit shortly\nafter conclusion of the onsite investigations in September.  Instead, each expert issued a report in\nmid to late December of 2009—more than three monhts after conclusion of the onsite investigations.\nThe United States then waited another three months to file its motion for a preliminary injunction.\nHaving waited eight years from the beginning of its investigation, six years since issuing the findings\nletter, fourteen months since commencing this action, six months since completion of the experts’\nonsite investigation, and three months since receiving its expert reports, the United States now\nargues that the status quo cannot continue another six months until the trial on the merits—which\nis not credible.\nThe United States has the burden of showing that an emergency preliminary injunction is\nnow necessary to prevent irreparable harm that otherwise was not a danger back when the complaint\nwas filed or when it wa s conducting investigations.  The United States has failed to carry  that\nburden. \nNor has the United States shown that a preliminary injunction is necessary to maintain the\nstatus quo.  The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo so that the court can\nrender a meaningful decision on the merits after a trial.  See Penn v. San Juan Hosp., Inc., 528 F.2d\n1181, 1185 (10th Cir. 1975) (“The object of the preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo\npending the litigation of the merits.”); Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co. v. Randolph, 182 F.2d 996,\n999 (8th Cir. 1950) (“A temporary injunction is usually issued to preserve the status quo until a\n8\n\nhearing on the merits may be had.”); United States v. Adler’s Creamery, 107 F.2d 987, 990 (2d Cir.\n1939) (stating that a preliminary injunction’s “ordinary function is to preserve the status quo and it\nis to be issued only upon a showing that there would otherwise be danger of irreparable injury”); 11A\nCHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER, & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND\nPROCEDURE § 2947 (2d ed. 1995).  “Ordinarily, the court in its discretion may grant a preliminary\ninjunction where it appears that there is a substantial controversy between the parties and that one\nof them is committing an act or threatening the immediate commission of an act that will cause\nirreparable injury or destroy the status quo of the controversy before a full hearing can be had on the\nmerits of the case,a nd generally such an injunction will be granted whenever necessary to the orderly\nadministration of justice.”  Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co., 182 F.2d at 999 (quoting Benson Hotel\nCorp. v. Woods, 168 F.2d 694, 697 (8th Cir. 1948)).\nHere, the relief requ ested by the United Stat es would, in fact, chang e the status quo.\nAccording to the United States’ own investigations and expert reports, there has been no significant\nchange in the kinds of treatment and pr ocedures used at the CHDC since 2002, when the United\nStates began investigating.  The United States seeks changes in the admissions, treatment, and\nevaluation procedures at the CHDC and seeks those changes only six months before a trial on the\nmerits is to begin.  The United States’ motion makes clear that it, in fact, does not want the status\nquo to remain the same, as the status quo i s what the United States alleges is harmful to CHDC\nresidents.\nB. REMAINING FACTORS\nThe remaining factors that the Court must consider are the probability of success on the\nmerits, the balance of harms, and the public interest.  As for the probability that the United States\n9\n\nwill succeed on the merits at trial, it is clear from the parties’ briefs that the opinions of each party’s\nrespective expert witnesses will play a significant role in the Court’s determination on the merits.\nIn moving for a preliminary injunction, the United States relies heavily on its expert witnesses’\nreports.  Determining the likelihood of success requires full consideration of the expert reports from\nboth sides, but pursuant to the schedule to which the parties agreed and which the Court, in reliance\non the agreement of the parties, adopted, the time for the defense experts to submit their reports has\nnot yet arrived.  The parties agreed to a schedule whereby the expert reports for the United States\nwould be disclosed by December 23, 2009; the defense experts’ onsite investigations would conclude\nby March 25, 2010; and the ex pert report for the defense would be disclosed by April 27, 2010.\nDocument #24-2.  The Court adopted th at agreed schedule.  Document #25.  The Court cannot\ndetermine the likelihood of success without considering the defendants’ expert reports, which are,\nby agreement and by court order, not yet due.\nThe other two factors—the public interest and the state of balance between the threat of harm\nand the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other parties—are closely tied.  Neither of\nthem points more strongly toward granting an injunction than not, in part because of the nature of\nthe injunction requested.  The United States re quests that the Court issue an order providin g\nimmediate relief to:\na. Cease all admissions of school-age children to the CHDC;\nb. Prohibit  the treatment of childre n  at t he  CHDC with psy chotropic\nmedications  prescribed  by  a psy chiatrist  not  accredited  in  child  and\nadolescent psychiatry and appoint an independent psychiatric consultant to\nperform a medication side effect assessment of each CHDC resident who is\nreceiving or has received psychotropic medications; and\n10\n\nc. Prohibit  the  use at   the  CHDC  of  the  most  severe,  outdated  forms of\nmechanical restraints.\nThe United States also requests that within ninety days of the Court’s or der, all other forms of\nrestraint should be reviewed and revised as appropriate by an independent team of doctoral level\nbehavioral clinicians with actual training and experience in contemporary, evidence-based behavioral\nmanagement programs; within thirty days of the Court’s order the parties should jointly choose an\nindividual to act as Community Placement Evaluator; within ninety days the Community Placement\nEvaluator should access all of the children at theC HDC for community placement; and within thirty\ndays of the assessment transition plans should be developed for all of the children.\nAs to the first aspect of the preliminary injunction requested by the United States, in the\nabsence of specific information about the specific circumstances of a specific child who might be\nadmitted to the CHDC, the Court has no means by which to balance the harm and assess the public\ninterest associated with granting a preliminary injunction.  Without specific information involving\na particular child, the Court cannot say whether admitting that child to the CHDC or prohibiting the\nadmission of that child to the CHDC would be in the best interest of the child or in the public\ninterest.\nIn the second aspect of the preliminary injunction requested by the United States, the United\nStates  requests  that the Court prohibit treatme nt  of children with psy chotropic  medications\nprescribed by the CHDC psychiatrist.  Without knowing the specific facts of a particular case, the\nCourt cannot say whether the potential harm from psychotropic medications would outweigh the\nbenefit of those psychotropic medications.  With respect to the request that the Court appoint an\nindependent psychiatric consultant to perform a medic ation side effect assessment, obviously it\n11\n\nwould take a span of time to find a child psychiatrist capable of performing the assessment and\navailable to perform the assessment; and then actually performing the assessment would require\nanother span of time.  The Court cannot sa ythat the benefit of commencing that process five months\nbefore trial would outweigh the harm that could be caused by waiting until the trial on the merits to\ndetermine whether such a process is really necessary.\nIn the third aspect of the request for injunction, the United States requests that the Court\nprohibit the use of “the most se vere, outdated forms of mechanical restraints.”  Elsewhere in its\nrequest for a preliminary injunction, the United States refers to papoose bo ards, restraint chairs,\nstraightjackets, “and similar outdated, extreme forms of behavioral restraints on children,” as the\nrestraints that should be prohibited.  The declaration of the expert retained by the United States on\nthis issue, however, does not say that such restraints are never appropriate.  The expert declaration\nsays:\nMechanical restraints may be used i n certain,  carefully limited circumstances\nconsistent with clinical standards.  These standards require a careful evaluation of the\nbenefits and risks of using restraints by qualified staff.  To accurately evaluate these\nbenefits and risks, clinicians must have an understanding  of basic psychological\nprinciples and evidence-based treatment approaches.  With appropriate review and\noversight, mechanical restraints may then be used in a manner consistent with those\nprinciples.  CHDC’s mechanical restraint practices substantially depart from these\ngenerally accepted standards and principals [sic].\nAssuming that the Court were to accept this statement by the United States’ expert, the remedy\nwould not be to eliminate completely the use of mechanical restraints but to require the CHDC to\nadopt appropriate clinical standards for using them.  If the use of mechanical restraints is appropriate\nin some circumstances, as apparently everyone agrees, there is insufficient information before the\nCourt by which the Court can assess the balance of harms and the public interest associated with\n12\n\ncompletely prohibiting the use of straightjackets, restraint chairs, and papoose boards between now\nand a decision on the merits.\nAll of the other aspects of the request for a preliminary injunction involve requests that the\nCourt order the commencement of processes that will take some months to complete.  These may\nbe valid requests, and the Court may order such processes to begin after a trial on the merits; but\nthere is no information from which the Court can conclude that the potential harm in waiting the\nbrief period of time between now and trial outweighs the potential harm associated with ordering the\ncommencement of these processes before a trial on the merits.\nThe United States has failed to meet its burden of showing that the public interest and the\nbalance of harms favor granting the injunction.\nCONCLUSION\nNothing in this Opinion and Order should bec onstrued as discounting the seriousness of the\nissues.  The decisions to be made are important—important enough to wait a few more months so\nthat they can be based on all of the evidence.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the United States’ motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED.\nDocument #42.  The defendants’ motion to strike is DENIED as moot.  Document #49.\nIT IS SO ORDERED this 7th day of April, 2010.\n                                                                       \nJ.
