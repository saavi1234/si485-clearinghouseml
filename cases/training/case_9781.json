    "summary": "<p>In 2002, the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division (\"DOJ\") conducted investigations, aided by expert consultants in juvenile justice administration, psychology, medicine, education, and sanitation, at two military-style juvenile facilities (\"Oakley\" and \"Columbia\") operated by the state of Mississippi. In June 2003, DOJ notified the state in a findings letter that the investigations revealed that the facilities deprived the resident juveniles of rights under the First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 14141, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. &sect; 1401, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 794.</p>\r\n<p>DOJ found that youth confined at Oakley and Columbia suffered harm or the risk of harm from deficiencies in the facilities' (1) provision of mental health and medical care, (2) protection of juveniles from harm (including physical harm from staff), and (3) juvenile justice management (lack of due process and adequate grievance procedures, untrained staff, mail/telephone/visitation inadequacies, and limited exercise opportunities). DOJ also found sanitation deficiencies at Oakley. In addition, both facilities failed to provide required general education services, as well as education to eligible youth as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The First Amendment violations were rooted in both facilities' requiring youth to engage in religious activities. The findings letter proposed a number of remedial measures for the state to adopt, offered to negotiate with the state to reach a resolution of the allegations, and stated that a federal lawsuit could soon be filed against the state if a negotiated settlement could not be reached.</p>\r\n<p>On December 18, 2003, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against the state (and relevant juvenile justice-related state officials and agencies). Among the allegations were the defendants' failure to adequately protect youth from harm and the risk of harm (including staff abuse) at these facilities, unreasonable isolation and restraint use, failure to provide adequate mental and medical health care and rehabilitative treatment, inadequate educational services, and failure to provide adequate special education services to youth with mental illness and intellectual and learning disabilities. The DOJ sought declaratory and equitable relief, relying upon authority granted by 42 U.S.C. &sect; 14141.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, in an originally-separate class action case involving Columbia that was filed on April 13, 2004 against the state, a settlement had been reached to remedy the facilities' limits on juvenile residents' contacts with their attorneys. By the time the settlement was reached, on January 12, 2005, that case had been consolidated with the DOJ's case pursuant to an unpublished July 12, 2004, order of Magistrate Judge James C. Sumner. Lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Mississippi Center for Justice had represented the juvenile plaintiff in the 2004 case, <a href=\"../../../../case/43516/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">K.L.W. v. James</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Later in 2005, separate agreements were reached between the DOJ and the state to address the shortcomings at the juvenile facilities that were alleged in the 2003 DOJ lawsuit. In a May 4, 2005, memorandum of agreement, the parties detailed means of remedying deficiencies in mental health care, rehabilitative services, and special education. On June 9, 2005, the parties filed an agreement setting out remedial measures to address protection from harm, suicide prevention, and medical and dental care issues. Both agreements included provisions for compliance and quality assurance and for monitoring and enforcement, imposed reporting requirements and rights of access, and set out implementation and termination procedures. Joyce Burrell was chosen to be the monitor. District Judge Henry T. Wingate approved the settlement and received the subsequently-filed periodic monitor's reports.</p>\r\n<p>An Amendment to Consent Decree was filed with the court on February 26, 2008, which extended its provisions to May 31, 2010, appointed two court monitors&mdash;Leonard Dixon and Lindsay Hayes&mdash;set out deadlines for receiving detailed action plans from those monitors, and addressed compliance with the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 3626(a).</p>\r\n<p>In 2010, the court ordered the Consent Decree amended to dismiss certain provisions and modify others, and appointed Dr. Kelly Dedel as a monitor. The court required the defendant to develop a comprehensive action plan for the substantive remedial areas of the Agreement. This Action Plan was filed with the court on September 16, 2010.</p>\r\n<p>Monitoring continued, and on April 12, 2013, the parties advised the court that the state had satisfied the requirements in the major substantive areas of the Consent Decree. The only remaining action at that point was implementation of the Quality Assurance program.</p>\r\n<p>On September 27, 2013, the court (Judge Wingate) signed an Agreed Order Terminating Specific Provisions of the Amended Consent Decree, in which parties agreed that the state had met its burden of remaining in substantial compliance for a period of six months with regards to many provisions of the Consent Decree.</p>\r\n<p>The twenty-first Monitor&rsquo;s Report, issued on May 8, 2014, explained that Missouri had complied with the remaining Consent Decree provisions, and DOJ concurred with this conclusion. Therefore, on August 19, 2014, Judge Wingate terminated the Consent Decree and its associated Orders and finally dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>",

The parties shall \nattempt in good faith to mediate the dispute for a minimum of 30 days prior to \ninitiating any court action. DOJ commits to work in good faith with the State to \navoid enforcement actions. However, in case of an emergency posing an \nimmediate threat to the health or safety of youths, the United States may omit \nthe notice and cure requirements herein (including the provision regarding \nmediation), before seeking judicial action. \n(58) Agreement Coordinator The State shall appoint an Agreement Coordinator \nto coordinate and oversee compliance with this Agreement. \n(59)Termination This Agreement shall terminate four years from the date it is \nordered by the Court. The Agreement may also end earlier than four years from \nthe date it is ordered by the Court if the State has substantially complied with \neach of the provisions of the Agreement and has maintained substantial \ncompliance for at least two years. The burden shall be on the State to \ndemonstrate this level of compliance. There are three substantive sections of \nthis agreement - protection from harm, suicide prevention, and medical and \ndental care. A section of the Agreement may be terminated if the State sustains \nits burden with respect to that section of the Agreement. Noncompliance with \nmere technicalities, or temporary failure to comply during a period of otherwise \nsustained compliance will not constitute failure to maintain substantial \ncompliance. At the same time, temporary compliance during a period of \nsustained noncompliance shall not constitute substantial compliance. \nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/miss_oakley_cd.htm 6/6/2007\n\nUS v.

Section II of the \nCourt’s order modifies Paragraph 38 to require the State to develop a comprehensive action plan for the \nsubstantive remedial areas of the Agreement:  protection from harm, suicide prevention, mental health \nand rehabilitative services, and Paragraphs 39-40 regarding quality assurance and corrective action \nplans.  The State was directed to revise or modify the existing Action Plan for protection from harm and \nsuicide prevention and integrate the plans into the comprehensive action plan in consultation with the \nmonitor.  The State would then submit that comprehensive action plan to the United States and monitor \nand revise it based on the comments from the United States and Monitor.  The Parties were directed to \njointly file, no later than 90 days from the Court’s June 21, 2010 Order, a request to the Court to enter \nthe comprehensive action plan as a modification to the Agreement. \n \n  With the assistance of Dr. Dedel (the Monitor), the Parties have collaborated to create the \ncompliance action plan.

Accordingly, the Parties now jointly submit to the Court, \nwithin the 90 day deadline time period, their request to the Court to enter the attached Compliance \nAction Plan (Attachment 1) as a modification to the Agreement. \n  \n   \n\nCase 3:03-cv-01354-HTW-JCS   Document 160    Filed 09/16/10   Page 2 of 4\n  The Parties also wish to inform the Court that Dr. Dedel is scheduled to tour the Oakley Training \nSchool in Raymond, Mississippi on November 15-19, 2010 and December 13-17, 2010.   \n \n  Respectfully submitted this 16th day of September, 2010. \n \nFor the United States: \n \nDONALD R.

THE PRISON LITIGATION REFORM ACT\nThe United States and Defendants stipulate that this\nAmendment complies in all respects with the provisions of the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a).  Pursuant to\nthe stipulation and the facts set forth in the Parties’ Joint\nMotion to Amend Consent Decree, the Court finds that Defendants\nhave violated the federal rights of youth.  Further, the Court\nfinds that the prospective relief in this Amendment to the\nConsent Decree is narrowly drawn, extends no further than\nnecessary to correct the violations of federal rights set forth\nin the Complaint, is the least intrusive means necessary to\ncorrect these violations, and will not have an adverse impact on\npublic safety or the operation of a criminal justice system. \nAccordingly, this Amendment complies in all respects with the\nprovisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a).\n  All provisions of the Consent Decree that do not conflict\nwith this Amendment shall remain in full force and effect.  \nSO ORDERED this 26th day of February, 2008.\ns/ HENRY T.

 The number of staff present at the time of the incident and their position; \n•  Staff’s use of verbal de‐escalation strategies, prior to resorting to physical restraint; and \n•  Staff’s progression to more restrictive levels of physical restraint, and why increasing \nlevels of restraint were necessary. \nThese shortcomings are particularly evident when the written IR is compared to the videotaped \nfootage of the incident.  \n \nIn part, the format of the IR form itself contributes to this problem. The form does not clearly \nspecify the information to be included in staff’s narratives. Further, the current practice for \nresponding staff to complete the entire IR form is unnecessary and also can provide conflicting \ninformation with regard to the type of incident and other information used for incident tracking. \n \nSome of the JCWs do not have the skills needed to write high‐quality incident reports; others \nare simply apathetic. Staff receive training in IR writing during Orientation, but the training may \nnot adequately reflect real‐world situations and some trainers may not be skilled at \ncommunicating this type of information. They do not receive any refresher training in IR writing. \n \nSimilarly, some of the shift supervisors, who are responsible for reviewing all IRs and ensuring \ntheir completeness, do not have the skills to review IRs and determine their sufficiency, or are \nhesitant to hold staff accountable for their mistakes. Shift Supervisors do not receive any special \ntraining to hone these skills, and until very recently (July 2010), supervision of these staff was \nineffective.  \nAction Step  Due Date \n1.  Revise IR form to clarify the types of information staff should  August 1, 2010 \nsupply in the narrative.  \n2.  Implement a simplified Staff Statement form (e.g., consisting only  October 1, 2010  \nof prompts/lines for recording narrative statement) to eliminate \nthe duplication of effort in recording other information pertinent \nto the incident. Ensure all responding staff complete a Staff \nStatement and attach them to the Incident Report.  \n3.

Develop a campus wide level system that addresses the  November 1, 2010 \nyouth’s need for structure, monitoring/surveillance, and   \nindividual behavior modification while providing opportunities \nfor increasing privileges and self‐management based on the \nyouth’s achieving and maintaining behavior change goals as \ndetermined by the treatment team.   \n20.

Revise and implement Staff Attendance and Tardiness policy to be  January 1, 2011 \nmore in line with those of other public safety organizations (i.e., \nmore closely inspect the reasons underlying staff call‐ins).  \n \n \n \n \n \nIV.A. (14) Isolation.  The State shall develop and implement policies, procedures, and practices \nto ensure that isolation, lockdown, seclusion and other similar restrictions are used only when \nappropriate, in an appropriate manner and to document fully the use of isolation. The State \nshall immediately cease requiring youth to strip and remain naked while in isolation.  \nBarriers to Compliance \n \nOne barrier to the State’s ability to demonstrate compliance with this provision is the \ninadequacy of the data used to track practices related to isolation. For example: \n•  Data pulled from the IRs on “Behavior Management Isolation” may include a range of \nactions that do not actually include isolation (e.g., separating two youth by placing them \nin chairs on opposite sides of the day room; giving the youth a time‐out in his room \nwhen the door remains open). This practice artificially inflates the number of BMI \nepisodes and prevents an accurate accounting of its use. \n  9.\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01354-HTW-JCS   Document 160-1    Filed 09/16/10   Page 10 of 17\n•  The distinction between BMI and Pre‐Hearing Confinement (PHC) is not always clear, \nand thus data collection practices are not consistent. Greater clarity in policy and data \ncollection is needed for the State to be able to demonstrate that PHC is used when the \nyouth is a) out of control or b) accused of a very serious rule violation (e.g., assault with \ninjury; escape; etc.); AND c) pending a disciplinary hearing. In the past, situations like \nthese may have been labeled BMI, which would both inflate the BMI statistics and \ndeflate the PHC statistics.  \n \nFurther, while youth in isolation receive recreation and education each day, the policy does not \ncurrently include any specific requirements for the delivery of mental health services while the \nyouth is in isolation. While isolation can effectively suppress unwanted behaviors in the short \nterm, absent constructive interaction with mental health staff about the incident, youth in \nisolation are unlikely to change their behavior over the long term.  \n \nPast history suggested that youth on the mental health caseload are disproportionately \nrepresented among youth in isolation. The facility does not regularly track this data and thus the \nextent to which this is true cannot be monitored.  \nAction Step  Due Date \n37. Clearly delineate the situations in which the Behavior  February 1, 2011 \nManagement Isolation (BMI) label is to be applied to ensure that \nan accurate record of the frequency of BMI usage is produced.  [if \nthe true frequency of BMI appears excessive (i.e., it is used in \nresponse to non‐serious infractions), additional action steps will be \ndeveloped.] \n38. Clearly delineate the situations under which isolation is to be  February 1, 2011 \nlabeled Pre‐Hearing Confinement (PHC), rather than BMI, so that \naccurate data regarding its use can be produced. [if the true use of \nPHC appears in conflict with policy, additional action steps will be \ndeveloped.] \n39. Implement contact standards for mental health professionals with  September 1, \nyouth who are in any type of isolation.    2010 \n40.

Revise the BMU policy to provide for an administrative override to  January 1, 2010 \nadmit a youth upon intake. This option should be used very rarely \nand only in response to youth with an extreme propensity for \nviolence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  13.\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01354-HTW-JCS   Document 160-1    Filed 09/16/10   Page 14 of 17\n \nIV.B. (23) Supervision of Youth at Risk of Self‐Harm.  The State shall ensure that newly‐arrived \nyouth, youth in isolation or seclusion and other youth at heightened risk of self‐harm are \nsufficiently supervised to maintain their safety.    \nBarriers to Compliance \n \nSome of the staff tasked with supervising youth during the overnight hours have not complied \nwith policy. Occasionally, staff on 3rd shift have been observed sleeping while on duty. Some \nstaff have attempted to implement the required supervision practices, but have not made the \nobservations at the required intervals. Although problems are not pervasive, given the serious \nnature of the behaviors this provision is designed to prevent, continued vigilance is necessary.   \nAction Step  Due Date \n45. Increase the number of individuals who have access to the server  October 1, 2010 \nwhere videotaped footage is stored to increase the frequency of \nvideotape review.   \n46.

DEFENDANTS\nAGREED ORDER TERMINATING SPECIFIC PROVISIONS\nOF THE AMENDED CONSENT DECREE\nIn 2005, this Court approved and entered as its Order a consent decree (“Agreement”)(Dkt.\n#119, 120, May 31, 2005) requiring the State of Mississippi, et al. (the “State”) to implement certain\nmeasures to address unconstitutional conditions at the Oakley Training School (“Oakley”) and the\nColumbia Training School (“Columbia”).1  On February 26, 2008, this Court approved and entered\nan amendment to the Agreement that included, inter alia, an extension of the termination date of the\nAgreement to May 31, 2010 and the appointment of three monitors to oversee the Agreement.\n(Dkt.#135.) On April 30, 2008, this Court approved and entered as an order the Action Plan for suicide\nprevention.  (Dkt. #141.)  On July 10, 2008, this Court approved and entered as an order the Action\nPlan for protection from harm.  (Dkt. #144.)  On June 21, 2010, this Court entered an Order to Amend\nConsent Decree.  (Dkt. #158.)  The Amended Consent Decree essentially addressed the following:\na)  dismissal of Paragraphs 20-22, 24-28, and 29-36;\nb)  the addition of three (3) paragraphs to a new subsection IV.D.\nconcerning mental health care and rehabilitative services;\n1Columbia Training School was closed in June 2008, and female youths are currently\nhoused at Oakley.\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01354-HTW-JCS   Document 173   Filed 09/27/13   Page 2 of 6\nc) the amendment of Paragraph 38 to require the State to develop\na comprehensive action plan for the substantive remedial areas\nof the Agreement - protection from harm, suicide prevention,\nand  mental  health  care  and  rehabilitative  services;  and\nParagraphs 39-40 regarding quality assurance corrective action\nplans;\nd) the  appointment  of  Kelly  Dedel,  Ph.D.  to  monitor  the\nremaining provisions of the Agreement; and\ne) the modification of Paragraph 59, the termination provision.\nParagraph 59 of the Amended Consent Decree provides:\n(59) Termination: This Agreement shall terminate when the State is in substantial\ncompliance with each provision of this Agreement and has maintained such\nsubstantial compliance for a period of six (6) months.  However, nothing\nherein shall be deemed to waive any rights or protections under the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §3626.\na. The parties shall request a status conference with the\ncourt every six (6) months to apprise the court of the\nstatus of the State’s efforts at compliance with this\nAgreement until termination of this Agreement.\nb.  The burden shall be on the State to demonstrate this\nlevel of compliance.\nc.   There  are  four  (4)  substantive  sections of this\nAgreement - protection from harm, suicide prevention,\nmedical and dental care, and mental health care and\nrehabilitative services.  A section of the Agreement\nmay be terminated if the State sustains its burden with\nrespect to that section of the Agreement.\nd. Noncompliance with mere technicalities, or temporary\nfailure  to  comply  during  a  period  of  otherwise\nsustained compliance will not constitute failure to\nmaintain substantial compliance.  At the same time,\ntemporary compliance during a period of sustained\nnoncompliance  shall  not  constitute  substantial\ncompliance.\nAt this time, all parties, as well as, the court appointed monitor are in agreement that the State\nhas met its burden of substantial compliance for a sustained period of six (6) months with regards to\n\nCase 3:03-cv-01354-HTW-JCS   Document 173   Filed 09/27/13   Page 3 of 6\nSubsections IV.A through IV.D and that the following provisions are ripe for dismissal in accordance\nwith Paragraph 59:\nSUBSECTION IV.A.

      "text": "June 19, 2003 \nThe Honorable Ronnie Musgrove \nGovernor of Mississippi \nOffice of the Governor \nJackson, Mississippi  39205 \nRe:\t CRIPA Investigation of Oakley and Columbia Training \nSchools in Raymond and Columbia, Mississippi \nDear Governor Musgrove: \nOn May 8, 2002, we notified you of our intent to investigate \nthe Oakley Training School in Raymond, Mississippi (“Oakley”) and \nthe Columbia Training School in Columbia, Mississippi \n(“Columbia”) pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized \nPersons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997 (“CRIPA”), and the Violent Crime \nControl and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141. \nConsistent with the statutory requirements of CRIPA, we are \nwriting to report the findings of our investigation.  At the \noutset, we wish to express our appreciation for the complete \ncooperation of the staff at the facilities, the Department of \nHuman Services, and the Attorney General’s Office during this \ninvestigation. \nOn June 24-28, 2002 and July 16-17, 2002, we conducted on-\nsite inspections of Oakley with expert consultants in juvenile \njustice administration, psychology, medicine, education, and \nsanitation.  On July 29-August 1, 2002 and September 25-27, 2002, \nwe inspected Columbia with all but the sanitation expert \nconsultant.  We reviewed documents including, but not limited to, \npolicies and procedures, incident reports, medical and education \nfiles, and facility maintenance records. \nWe find that conditions at Oakley and Columbia violate the \nconstitutional and statutory rights of juveniles.  Youth confined \nat Oakley and Columbia suffer harm or the risk of harm from \ndeficiencies in the facilities’ provision of mental health and \nmedical care, protection of juveniles from harm, and juvenile \njustice management.  There are also sanitation deficiencies at \nOakley.  In addition, both facilities fail to provide required \ngeneral education services as well as education to eligible youth \nas required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1401, et seq., and Section 504 of the \n\n-2 \n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.  Finally, we find \nthat Oakley and Columbia violate the youths’  First Amendment \nrights by forcing them to engage in religious activities. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe Mississippi Department of Human Services operates Oakley \nand Columbia through the Division of Youth Services.  The average \nlength of stay for youth in the training schools is two to three \nmonths, but some youth may stay up to six months or longer.  The \nmajority of youth committed to Oakley and Columbia are non \nviolent offenders.  For example, 75 percent of the girls at \nColumbia are committed for status offenses, probation violations, \nor contempt of court.  The majority of boys at Oakley are \ncommitted for property offenses, lower level drug possession \ncharges, or auto theft charges. \nYouth offenders who are mentally ill or have mental \nretardation are to be committed by the Mississippi youth courts1 \nto rehabilitation facilities operated by the Mississippi \nDepartment of Mental Health.  See MS ST §§ 41-21-109; 43-21-611. \nThus, we were told that youth with mental illness or mental \nretardation are not confined at Oakley or Columbia.  As discussed \nin greater detail below, this is not the case. \nA.  Description of the Facilities \n1.  Oakley Training School \nOakley Training School, also known as the Mississippi Youth \nCorrectional Complex, sits on approximately 1,068 acres of land \nsurrounded by agricultural fields in Raymond, Mississippi, which \nis approximately 30 minutes outside of Jackson, Mississippi. \nOakley is designed to function as a paramilitary program for \ndelinquent boys2 and is comprised of three operational units, \n1  Mississippi youth courts are divisions of either\nchancery or county courts and have original jurisdiction in\nproceedings involving delinquent, neglected or battered children. \n2  Reportedly, the program imposes a military style\ndiscipline on youth and is purported to promote a “vigorous\nphysical fitness training program.” \n\n-3 \n\nUnit One, Unit Two, and Ironwood.  Boys housed at Oakley range in \nage from 10 to 17.  At the time of our visit, 336 boys were \ncommitted to Oakley. \nUnit One is a large, under-utilized, self-contained building \nwith a housing capability of 275.  Enclosed in a secure perimeter \nfence, Unit One contains the intake unit with approximately four \nseparate cells, a medical infirmary, its own school, a small \nmodern gym, and outside recreational space.  The intake unit is \nwhere youth sent to Oakley are processed and evaluated, and \ncontains 11 separate living units known as pods, each designed to \nhold approximately 20 juveniles.  Each pod has a locked \ncorrectional officer’s control room designed in a manner such \nthat no interaction between line staff and juveniles can occur. \nDuring our visit, only three of the 11 pods were operational due \nto staff shortages. \nUnit Two consists of several unfenced buildings in a \ntraditional juvenile detention campus setting with a free \nstanding school, vocational shops, a large cafeteria, a chapel, \nand open space used for parade and military training.  Unit Two \nhas eight living units known as cottages.  The cottages hold \nbetween 24 to 32 juveniles.  Unit Two also has a separate unit \nknown as the Special Intervention Unit (“SIU”) for youth with \nbehavioral and disciplinary problems, and youth who are suicidal. \nThe SIU has 14 locked single cells and a large unfurnished day \nroom that is adjacent to the staff control room.  During our \nvisit, approximately seven youth were confined to the SIU. \nIronwood, the third unit on the Oakley campus, is a free \nstanding building housing boys aged 10 to 17.  Ironwood is \ndescribed as a 90-day, therapeutic intensive treatment unit for \nboys with behavioral problems from Units One and Two at Oakley \nand transfers from Columbia.  It is a self-contained maximum \nsecurity unit purportedly used for the most aggressive juveniles. \nYouth who are considered difficult, have attempted to escape, \nhave been involved in assaults, or have serious emotional or \nmental health problems are housed there.  Ironwood can house 25 \nyouths in locked single cells.  Nineteen boys were confined in \nIronwood during our visit. \n2.  Columbia Training School \nThe Columbia Training School, located in Columbia, \nMississippi, is approximately two and one-half hours northwest of \n\n-4 \n\nGulfport, Mississippi.  Like Oakley, Columbia sits on over 1,000 \nacres of land in an unfenced agricultural setting and purports to \nuse a military model for delinquent youth.  Columbia, comprised \nof several housing and administration buildings encircling a \nlarge field in a cottage setting, has a medical clinic, a free \nstanding school with a cafeteria, a chapel, and a gym.  Columbia \nhouses girls aged 10 to 18 and boys aged 10 to 15.  During our \nsite visit, 196 youth were committed to Columbia, 92 girls and \n104 boys. \nColumbia has two secure housing units, one for boys and the \nother for girls, used in the same manner as the SIU at Oakley \nwith the added function of serving as the intake units for all \nColumbia youth.  The boys’ population in an SIU unit called \nMcGehee varied from seven to 12 during our tour.  The girls’ SIU \npopulation in a unit called Cleveland ranged from 10 to 12. \nDuring our visit, only four residential cottages were being used \nand only one of those housed girls, Hammond Cottage.  Hammond \nCottage, designed to hold approximately 40 girls, has two \ndivisions:  one side of the cottage houses girls rotating through \nthe basic training program and the other side houses the advanced \ntraining programs.  During our visit, the basic side of Hammond \nhoused 43 girls and the advanced side 37 girls.  Many girls had \nbunks in the hallways due to overcrowding.  Boys were housed in \nthe other three cottages -- Rouse, Hugh-White, and Burrow.  Rouse \nis a boys’ basic program cottage for new commitments and housed \n28 boys during our visit.  Hugh-White is for basic program \nparticipants who are re-committed to Columbia.  Hugh-White housed \n27 boys during our visit.  Burrow is for boys in the advanced \nphase of the program and housed 40 boys. \nB.  Legal Background \nYouth adjudicated delinquent have a right to reasonably safe \nconfinement conditions and, at a minimum, should have the same \nconstitutional protections as adult pretrial detainees.  See \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315-16 (1982) (holding that a \nperson with mental retardation committed to the state’s custody \nhas substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535-36 (1979) \n(Fourteenth Amendment standard applies to pretrial detainees); \nGary H. v. Hegstrom, 831 F.2d 1430, 1432 (9th Cir. 1987) \n(applying the Fourteenth Amendment standard afforded adult \npretrial detainees to juveniles); Morgan v. Sproat, 432 F. Supp. \n1130, 1135-36 (S.D. Miss. 1977) (in a case involving the rights \n\n-5 \nof youth confined at Oakley, the court held that juveniles \nadjudicated delinquent are entitled to substantive due process \nprotections under the Fourteenth Amendment); see also Morales v. \nTurman, 383 F. Supp. 53, 120 (E.D. Tex. 1974) (“all juveniles \n. . . are constitutionally entitled to care that at least \nconforms to minimal professional standards,”), rev’d on other \ngrounds, 535 F.2d 864 (5th Cir. 1976), rev’d, 430 U.S. 322 (1977) \n(per curiam), on remand 562 F.2d 993 (5th Cir. 1977 (court did \nnot reach definitive holding regarding existence of right to \ntreatment), on remand 569 F. Supp. 332 (E.D. Tex. 1983). \nAdjudicated youth have a right to adequate education \ninstruction.  See Morgan v. Sproat, 432 F. Supp. 1130, 1140-41 \n(S.D. Miss. 1977).  Eligible youth also possess federal statutory \nrights to education under the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400, et seq. and Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq.  See \nAlexander S. v. Boyd, 876 F. Supp. 773, 788 (D.S.C. 1995). \nII.  FINDINGS \nYouth at Oakley and Columbia are confined in unsafe living \nconditions and receive inadequate treatment and care.  These \nconditions exist mainly because of staff shortages, ineffective \nmanagement and supervision at every organizational level within \nboth facilities, and the facilities’ emphasis on control and \npunishment instead of rehabilitation. \nA.  Protection from Harm \nOakley and Columbia do not have any system of positive \nincentives to manage youth, but instead rely on discipline and \nforce.  This leads to unconstitutionally abusive disciplinary \npractices such as hog-tying, pole-shackling, improper use and \noveruse of restraints and isolation, staff assaulting youth, and \nOC spray abuse. \n1.  Abusive Disciplinary Practices at Columbia \n(a)  Hog-tying and Pole-Shackling \nThe use of restraints without penological justification is \ncruel and unusual punishment.  See Hope v. Pelzer, 122 S. Ct. \n2508, 2514, 2518 (2002) (the unnecessary handcuffing of an inmate \nto a hitching post after his disruptive behavior ended violated \n\n-6 \nthe Eighth Amendment).  Youth reported and one staff member \nconfirmed incidents of hog-tying at Columbia in the boys’ and \ngirls’ SIUs and in Hammond Cottage.  Approximately 10 to 15 boys \nand girls consistently described the practice, where youth are \nplaced face down on the floor with their hands and feet shackled \nand drawn together.  That is, youths’ hands are handcuffed behind \ntheir backs.  Their feet are shackled together and then belts or \nmetal chains are wrapped around the two sets of restraints, \npulling them together.  A 13-year-old boy, in the SIU on suicide \nwatch, told us that he had been hog-tied twice while in the SIU. \nAnother boy told us that he was hog-tied for refusing to follow \norders.  Several girls in Hammond Cottage told us that either \nthey had been hog-tied or they had witnessed other girls being \nhog-tied.  They reported that girls are typically tied for three \nhour periods in the corners of the cottage and stated that girls \nwere also hog-tied in the SIU.  Girls also reported being hog-\ntied in a SIU cell called the “dark room.” \nContrary to Columbia’s policy that requires the documenting \nof all uses of restraints, the practice is not documented in \nincident reports or unit logbooks.  When our expert consultant \ndiscussed the apparent discrepancy between youth reports and lack \nof incident report documentation, Columbia SIU staff either \ndenied that these incidents took place or reluctantly admitted \nthey may have occurred -- but not during their shifts.  A senior \nmanager claimed it had been a long time since hog-tying had \noccurred because the practice was “inhumane.”  However, one \nrelatively new SIU staff person stated that hog-tying had \noccurred in the boys’ SIU a few months prior to our visit. \nThus, we have reason to believe that hog-tying occurs at \nColumbia despite the lack of penological justification or \ntherapeutic or rehabilitative benefit to hog-tying.  Columbia’s \nown policies prohibit the use of restraints as punishment. \nColumbia youth consistently reported another abusive \nrestraint practice.  Youth reported that they had either observed \nor experienced having their arms and legs shackled to poles in \npublic places.  For instance, one young girl reported that her \narms and legs were handcuffed and shackled around a utility pole \nbecause she was non-compliant during military exercises.  The \nrest of the unit was forced to perform military drills around \nher.  The youth was shackled for at least three hours, released \nfor lunch, and briefly shackled again.  This incident was \nwitnessed and similarly described by other youth, both boys and \n\n-7 \n\ngirls.  Another girl reported that two weeks prior to our visit, \nshe was shackled to a pole for talking in the cafeteria.  Still \nanother girl reported that she was shackled to a pole for \napproximately four hours because she did not say, “Yes, sir,” on \ncommand.  Again, this practice is not documented in incident \nreports or unit logbooks in violation of Columbia’s restraint \npolicy.  Not only is this abusive practice in violation of \nColumbia’s policies, it is unlawful. \n(b)  The girls’ SIU \nGirls in the SIU at Columbia are punished for acting out or \nfor being suicidal by being placed in a cell called the “dark \nroom.”  The “dark room” is a locked, windowless isolation cell \nwith lighting controlled by staff.  When the lights are turned \nout, as the girls reported they are when the room is in use, the \nroom is completely dark.  The room is stripped of everything but \na drain in the floor which serves as a toilet. \nMost girls are stripped naked when placed in the “dark \nroom.”  According to Columbia staff, the reason girls must remove \ntheir clothing before being placed in the darkroom, is that there \nis metal grating on the ceiling and the cell door which could be \nused for hanging attempts by suicidal girls.  Such suicidal \nhazards should be remedied rather than requiring suicidal \nchildren to strip naked. \nOne girl told us that the weekend prior to our visit, she \nwas placed naked in the “dark room” from Friday until Monday \nmorning.  She stated that she was allowed out of the cell once a \nday to take a shower, but received all her meals inside of the \ncell.  Another girl told us that in July 2002, she was placed in \nthe “dark room” with the lights off for three days with little \naccess to water as her requests for water were largely ignored. \nWhile facility administrators told us that this room is \nrarely used and if used, for no longer than a few hours at a \ntime, a number of girls reported being locked in the cell for as \nlong as three days to a week.  There is no separate log book to \nrecord the use of the “dark room” to substantiate the \nadministrators’ claims regarding the length of time the darkroom \nis in use.  To the contrary, log book entries for a three-month \nperiod for the girls’ SIU indicate that the dark room often is \nused overnight or over the weekend, particularly when the SIU is \n\n-8 \n\novercrowded, as well as used for punishment and for suicidal \ngirls. \nDuring our visit to the girls’ SIU at Columbia, there were \n14 girls present.  Nine of the girls had been locked in bare \ncells for more than a week; one girl had been locked in a bare \ncell for 114 days.  The conditions we observed in the SIU are \nparticularly inhumane.  The cells are extremely hot with \ninadequate ventilation.  Some girls are naked in a dark room \nwhere they must urinate and defecate in a hole that they cannot \nflush.  Restraint chairs are use for punishment in violation of \nColumbia’s own policy and procedures manual.3  OC spray is \nsometimes used in response to a youth’s minor misbehavior.  As \ndiscussed earlier, sometimes, girls are hog-tied.  Girls are \noften not given access to basic necessities, such as water, \npersonal hygiene items, and bathroom facilities, and girls are \nnot given sufficient mental health services.  Given the \nsignificant number of juvenile girls in Mississippi juvenile \nfacilities who suffer from various forms of mental disorders, \nparticularly separation anxiety disorder,4 the use of the SIU in \nits present form should be banned at Columbia.5 \n(c)  Other abusive practices at Columbia \n3  Columbia’s policy states that a restraint chair should\nonly be used if extreme force is necessary and that restraints,\nin general, must not be used to punish.  Generally accepted\nprofessional standards mandate that restraint chairs be used only\nfor youth whose self-destructive or dangerous behavior cannot be\ncontrolled safely in any other way; they should never be used as\npunishment. \n4  Girls in Mississippi juvenile justice facilities are\nfive to seven times more likely than boys to have a depression\ndisorder, and are two to five times more likely than boys to meet\nthe criteria for an anxiety disorder.  Angela Robertson & Jonelle\nHusain, Prevalence of Mental Illness and Substance Abuse\nDisorders Among Incarcerated Juvenile Offenders 27-28 (2001). \n5  See Lollis v. New York State Department of Social\nServices, 322 F. Supp. 473, 482 (S.D.N.Y. 1970) (two-week\nconfinement of a 14-year-old girl dressed in night clothes in a\nbare cell with no recreational facilities or reading matter is\ncruel and unusual punishment). \n\n-9 \nYouth at Columbia describe a number of abusive practices \nimposed by staff.  For example, youth report “sitting in a \nchair,” in which youth are required to assume a sitting position \nwhile holding their backs up against the wall with knees bent for \nas long as 20 to 30 minutes.  Youth also are forced to perform \n“guard duty.”  Youth are awakened in the middle of the night, \nrequired to get dressed, and walk inside the cottage for hours \nwith their hands to their heads (similar to a military salute) \nfrom bed to bed.  In June 2002, according to the SIU log book, a \nstaff person was given permission to awaken the boys at midnight, \ntake away their mattresses and covers, and force them to perform \n“guard duty.”  Boys housed in the cottages are sent by drill \ninstructors to the SIU during the day for punishment for failing \nto perform exercises.  SIU staff confirmed that boys’ punishment \nmay last for hours and consists of running around tables in the \nSIU day room with mattresses on their backs.  Girls are punished \nin the military field by being forced to run with automobile \ntires around their bodies or carrying logs.  Girls reported being \nforced to eat their own vomit if they throw-up while exercising \nin the hot sun. \nOur juvenile justice expert consultant observed a cottage \nstaff person punish an entire cottage by forcing youth to run \ninside the dorm room silently for at least 25 minutes while other \nyouth showered.  We learned that prior to our visit, one youth \nhad broken his toe by hitting it on a bed while performing this \nexercise. \nThese exercises and disciplinary practices serve no \npenological or rehabilitative purpose.  Many are cruel and \ndemeaning.6  They also are unsafe because, as our expert noted, \nwhen this type of physical punishment is imposed, the facility \ndoes not monitor the physical well-being of the youth. \n2.  Abusive Staff \n(a)  Assault \n6  See Morales v. Turman, 364 F. Supp. 166, 174 (E.D. Tex.\n1973) (subsequent history omitted)(“Requiring [youth] to maintain\nsilence during periods of the day merely for purposes of\npunishment, and to perform repetitive, nonfunctional, degrading,\nand unnecessary tasks for many hours . . . constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.”). \n\n-10 \nBased on our interviews with youth, our observations during \nthe tours, and review of documentation provided by the State, we \nfind that staff at Oakley and Columbia use excessive force with \nimpunity. \nAt Oakley, more than half of the youth in Ironwood reported \nthat staff had physically abused them.  In Unit One, a number of \nyouth reported, and some line staff confirmed, that youth who are \nre-committed to Oakley are taken to one of the isolation rooms in \nthe intake area and punched and slapped by staff as punishment \nfor being re-committed.  Youth reported in Unit Two that staff \nhit and physically assaulted other children.  One such incident \nwas confirmed by staff members who reported that approximately \ntwo weeks prior to our visit, a school counselor physically \nabused a youth.  This youth was choked by the counselor and sent \nto Ironwood based on the counselor’s recommendation to the \nfacility director.  The youth never received a hearing.  We were \ntold by staff and youth that the counselor would never be held \naccountable for the incident.  Indeed, we received no written \nincident or investigative reports concerning this incident. \nWhen asked why abuses were allowed to occur at Oakley \nwithout consequences to staff, we were told that staff shortages \ninhibited the facility administration’s ability to follow-up on \nyouth’s complaints.  Staff also stated that some staff abused \nyouth with impunity because they were favored by the \nadministration.  When asked why staff did not report these \nallegations, most staff responded that they feared retaliation. \nIn other cases, youth did not file complaints because they \nbelieved that their concerns would not be investigated or \naddressed.  During our second tour of Oakley, we observed a \ngeneral assembly conducted by administration officials where a \nnumber of the youth voiced concerns about being assaulted by \nstaff.  For example, one youth stated that a staff person had \nshoved his head into a toilet.  The youth wanted to know how the \nadministration would respond to complaints.  One administrative \nofficial responded that youth were not allowed to defend \nthemselves against staff who assaulted them. \nIn the girls’ SIU at Columbia, staff reportedly have hit, \nchoked, and slapped girls.  For instance, girls reported that a \nten-year-old girl was slapped by a male security guard.  A young \nboy in the boys’ SIU reported that before being taken to the SIU, \n\n-11 \n\nsecurity slapped him twice in the face and placed his neck in a \n“sleeper hold.”7 \n(b)  OC Spray Abuse \nBoth at Oakley and Columbia, staff practices regarding the \nuse of OC spray amount to excessive force.  According to the \nfacilities’ policy, OC spray may be used in only three \nsituations:  to “quell a riot”; or to “prevent further injury \nwhen students are fighting” and all other efforts to resolve the \nfight have failed; or if a youth possesses a device “clearly \nintended to be used as a weapon and refuses to disarm.”  Incident \nreports and youth complaints reflect that youth are sprayed \narbitrarily and in violation of facility policy and law.  See \nAlexander S. v. Boyd, 876 F. Supp. 773, 786 (D.S.C. 1995) \n(indiscriminate use of OC spray violates youth’s constitutional \nrights.  OC spray should only be used when there is a risk of \nserious bodily harm and no other less intrusive restraint is \navailable).  At Columbia, boys in the SIU reported that staff \nsprayed under their locked cell doors and that staff sprayed boys \nin the face while they were hog-tied.  Boys also told us that \nstaff sprayed into the air while boys were doing exercises for \npunishment in the SIU.  Incident reports make clear that suicidal \nyouth are sprayed for their suicidal gestures and behaviors and \nthat youth locked in isolation rooms who bang on the door of \ntheir cell are sprayed.  A log entry for the SIU in May 2002 \nindicates that a suicidal girl was sprayed because she refused to \nremove her clothes before being placed in the “dark room.” \nYouth at Columbia reported that staff routinely sprayed \nyouth for failing to perform military exercises.  Our review of \nincident reports confirms that OC spray is used for this purpose. \nFor example, a 13-year-old boy was sprayed because he did not \nperform exercises.  Reportedly, he was punished further by being \nforced to do 100 squat thrusts, 100 push ups, and 100 jumping \njacks.  One girl, prior to being sent to the SIU, had difficulty \nkeeping up with the group during exercise in the parade field. \nShe yelled to a staff person that it was hot and to “shut up \ntalking to me.”  Security was called and she was sprayed in the \nface.  Youth also talked extensively about “running the ridge,” a \n7  Youth told us that in order to be placed in a sleeper\nhold, a security officer stands behind a youth with his arm\naround the neck of the youth, cutting off the ability to breath. \n\n-12 \n\nform of intensive running on the campus grounds.8  Youth who \nrefuse to run the ridge are reportedly sprayed by staff. \nOn the Oakley campus, staff at Ironwood and Unit One use \nexcessive force, spraying OC to control youth who misbehave or \nwho are noncompliant.  For example, a youth in Unit One was \nsprayed for refusing to go into his cell.  In another case, two \nyouths were sprayed in Ironwood as they engaged in horseplay. \nFinally, based on our document review and conversations with \nstaff and juveniles, OC spray use at both facilities often is \nundocumented and unreported.  We find that OC spray is used \nregularly at both facilities for minor infractions or for \npunishment. \n3.  Investigation of Abuse Allegations \nOakley and Columbia do not have systemic internal and \nexternal review processes of abuse allegations to ensure that \ninvestigations are conducted thoroughly and objectively. \n(a)  Internal Review \nAll abuse allegations are not being investigated internally \nat the facilities or by the Division of Youth Services.  Oakley \nand Columbia share an investigator who investigates allegations \nof abuse, when reported to him by the facility administrators. \nThe investigator also functions as the “military coordinator.” \nThe investigator conducts a limited perfunctory investigation and \nsubmits brief investigative reports and summary recommended \ncourses of action to the Director of the Division of Youth \nServices for approval.  However, the investigator’s authority to \nconduct abuse investigations is not clearly defined.  As a \nresult, we found that Oakley and Columbia administrators are not \nheld accountable if they fail to report all allegations to the \ninvestigator. \nIn addition, youth reported feeling prohibited from \nreporting abuse allegations.  Youth at both facilities stated \nthat they did not report staff abuse because they believed that \n8  “Running the ridge” is a practice where staff force\nyouth to repeatedly run up and down the upper fields of the\nColumbia grounds at a fast pace. \n\n-13 \n\nreporting led to retaliation, or their allegations were not taken \nseriously.  A medical clinic incident notebook at Columbia \ndocuments the nursing staff’s treatment of youth’s injuries from \nalleged physical abuse by staff or pepper spray use.  However, \nthese abuse allegations appear never to have been investigated, \neven when an injury was noted by the nurse and could have \npossibly substantiated the youth’s claim. \n(b)  External Review \nWe found few external reviews of abuse allegations from \noutside agencies.  The Division of Youth Services’ Division of \nProgram Integrity conducted only 10 external reviews of abuse \nallegations between May 2000 and May 2002, most of them \nconcerning staff at Columbia.  We are aware of allegations of \nstaff abuse at Columbia and Oakley that would have warranted more \nthan 10 investigations from the Division of Program Integrity \nduring that time period. \nMoreover, during our tour of Columbia, children made various \nabuse allegations concerning specific staff.  Several girls \nalleged that a recreation staff person forced girls to run and \nperform military exercises wearing tires.  Many youth reported \nthat the acting head nurse routinely denied medical care and \naccess to appropriate health services.  The girls in the advanced \ncottage alleged that a security guard engaged in inappropriate \nsexual behavior by standing in front of the uncovered windows of \nthe girls’ cottage and observing them while they were undressing \nbefore going to bed. \nWe provided enough information for a thorough investigation \nto be conducted.  We relayed the nature of the allegations, the \napproximate date and location of where the incidents occurred, \nand the names of the staff persons allegedly responsible for the \nincidents9 to the Mississippi State Attorney General’s Office \n(“Attorney General’s Office”).10  We were informed by the Public \nIntegrity Division of the Attorney General’s Office that they \n9  We did not, however, provide the names of the allegedly\ninvolved youth in deference to the youths’ request for\nconfidentiality, many of whom had relayed fears of retaliation. \n10  The Mississippi Department of Human Services agreed to\ndefer its investigation of the allegations to the Attorney\nGeneral’s Office. \n\n-14 \n\nwould need the names of the youth making the allegations in order \nto conduct the investigation because approval of the youth court \njudge who adjudicated the youth delinquent was required.11 \n4.  Severe Staff Shortages \nColumbia and Oakley fail to keep the youth in their care \nsafe due to severe staffing shortages.  Oakley has a staff \nvacancy rate of 39 percent.  Due to budgetary constraints, Oakley \nis under a hiring freeze and cannot hire new staff to fill the \nvacancies, according to administration officials.  During our \ntours, we noted that the staff at Oakley, including the facility \nmanagement, appeared to be under stress and overworked.  The \ndocumentation we received indicated that the Division of Youth \nServices was notified as early as January 2002 that these \nshortages compromised the safety of both staff and youth on \nOakley’s campus.  Specifically, during an incident that resulted \nin the use of pepper spray, a staff person had to enlist the \nassistance of a youth to defuse a fight in one of the cottages. \nThe facility investigator wrote to the administrators at the \nDivision of Youth Services that “[t]here is a serious need for \nadditional staff members which [sic] are adequately trained in \njuvenile justice and security requirements before a staff member \nor student is critically injured or killed.” \nStaff and administration are typically required to work \novertime.  On the weekends, youth are sometimes distributed to \nother living units due to staffing shortages.  In Units One and \nTwo, one staff person supervises 30 or more juveniles on every \nshift.  This ratio substantially departs from generally accepted \nprofessional  practices.  During our tour, staff and senior \nmanagers repeatedly told us that Oakley is a dangerous place to \nwork.  Staff repeatedly stated that they are unable to protect \nyouth from harm.  Some senior managers admitted that all critical \nincidents were not being reported because the facility cannot \nafford to fire abusive staff.  Line staff accused other staff of \nassaulting youth and stated that nothing is done about the abuse. \nSimilarly, Columbia has staffing shortages and an inability \nto fill vacant positions.  At the time of our on-site \n11  We were told that the Attorney General’s Office could\nnot initiate its own inquiry without prior court approval or in\nconjunction with the Department of Human Services.  See MS ST §§\n43-21-353; 43-21-261. \n\n-15 \n\ninvestigation, Columbia had a hiring freeze and a vacancy rate of \napproximately 30 percent.  The result of the shortage is \nparticularly harmful for the girls.  The girls’ cottage is \nseverely overcrowded.  Girls are made to sit in a confined lobby \narea or on the day room floor every evening for at least four \nhours in silence because staff shortages prevent them from \nstaying in their rooms.  Our expert noted a critical shortage of \ndirect care workers.  Like Oakley, Columbia’s staffing patterns \nsubstantially depart from generally accepted professional \npractices. \nB.  Mental Health Care \nThe Constitution requires that confined juveniles receive \nadequate medical treatment, including adequate mental health \ntreatment and suicide prevention measures.  Hott v. Hennepin \nCounty, 260 F.3d 901, 905 (8th Cir. 2001) (citing Williams v. \nKelso, 201 F.3d 1060, 1065 (8th Cir. 2000)); Young v. City of \nAugusta, 59 F.3d 1160, 1169 (11th Cir. 1995); Horn v. Madison \nCounty Fiscal Court, 22 F.3d 653, 660 (6th Cir. 1994); Bowring v. \nGodwin, 551 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir. 1977). \nOakley and Columbia house a large population of juveniles \nwho suffer from mental disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal \nthoughts.12  A July 2001 study funded by the Mississippi \nDepartment of Public Safety Division of Public Safety Planning \nand the Department of Mental Health Division of Children and \nYouth Services found that between 66 and 85 percent of the \nincarcerated juvenile offenders in Mississippi “met DSM-IV \ndiagnostic criteria for a mental disorder.”13  The study added \nthat “multiple, co-occurring mental health and substance abuse \ndiagnoses were evident . . . [and] 9% [of the juveniles] had \nsuicidal thoughts and plans.”  Oakley and Columbia do not provide \nadequate services for this vulnerable population.  Lack of \ntraining, resources, program structure and staffing shortages \n12  However, as indicated previously, these youth should be\ncommitted to rehabilitation facilities operated by the\nMississippi Department of Mental Health.  See supra, p. 2. \n13  Angela Robertson & Jonelle Husain, Prevalence of Mental\nIllness and Substance Abuse Disorders Among Incarcerated Juvenile\nOffenders (2001) (“the Mississippi State University Study”).\nRobertson and Husain are researchers at Mississippi State\nUniversity. \n\n-16 \n\nhave severely affected Oakley and Columbia’s counseling programs \nand as a result youth with mental health concerns receive \nhaphazard and cursory treatment. \n1.  Administration of Psychotropic Medications \nThe care of youth with severe mental illness requires \nassessment and management by a psychiatrist, and where \nmedications are prescribed before confinement, the continuation \nof medications without interruption upon admission to the \nfacilities.  The management of youth with mental illness and the \nadministration of psychotropic medications is seriously deficient \nat Oakley and Columbia. \nMany youth on psychiatric medications are not allowed to \ncontinue to receive those medications when they are admitted to \nOakley or Columbia.  The physicians, not the psychiatrists, \ndetermine which youth with mental illness will continue to \nreceive their psychotropic medicine while committed.  For \nexample, before his admission to Columbia, a youth was treated at \na psychiatric hospital and discharged with a prescription for \nrisperdal, which treats the symptoms of schizophrenia.  His \nrisperdal was continued in detention and his medicine was sent to \nColumbia when he was transferred.  However, the facility \nphysician discontinued the youth’s risperdal without referring \nhim to the psychiatrist for follow-up treatment.  In another \ncase, a youth was hospitalized for mental health treatment and \nupon release was prescribed psychotropic medications.  Upon \nadmission to Columbia, the physician discontinued these \nmedications and made no referral to the psychiatrist.  After \nstaff reported the youth’s unacceptable behavior, he was referred \nto the psychiatrist who, apparently either ignoring or being \nunaware of the youth’s prior history, prescribed a different \nmedication altogether.  The youth was still taking the facility-\nprescribed medication at the time of our visit, and staff \ncontinued to find the youth’s behavior unacceptable. \nPhysicians should not make decisions about whether a child \nwill continue on most prescribed psychiatric medications.  A \npsychiatrist should evaluate the youth’s medication needs based \non a diagnostic interview, a review of records of prior care, \nand, if necessary, in consultation with the youth’s psychiatrist \nin the youth’s home community. \n\n-17 \nRarely are the contracted psychiatrists and staff \npsychologists informed when a child is admitted with or has a \nhistory of treatment with psychiatric medicine.  Youth with \nmental illness often are untreated while in the facilities, even \nthough they are admitted with a history of mental illness. \n2.  Managing Suicidal Youth \nOakley and Columbia fail to employ adequate suicide \nprevention measures.  Activity, positive relationships between \nstaff and youth, individual attention, school, exercise, reading, \nand counseling are necessary aspects of an adequate adolescent \nsuicide prevention program.  Instead, at Columbia, suicidal youth \nare isolated in SIUs in stripped cells, sometimes naked, are not \nallowed outdoor exercise, and receive very little schooling or \ncounseling.  As previously discussed, some suicidal girls at \nColumbia are placed in the “dark room.”  Furthermore, in the \nisolation units or SIUs at both facilities, children’s mattresses \nare taken away during the day, leaving them with the option of \nlying or sitting on concrete or standing. \nBoys at Oakley who are judged to be suicide risks are placed \nin an empty day room adjacent to the control room where they sit \non the floor all day without access to books, school, or outdoor \nexercise.  They also are not permitted to interact with other \nboys in the room.  The counselor assigned to counsel suicidal \nyouth attempts to see each youth once per day, but if she is \nunavailable, no one provides mental health counseling in her \nabsence. \nC.  Rehabilitative Treatment \nThe Constitution requires that youth confined at Oakley and \nColumbia receive adequate rehabilitative treatment.  Morgan v. \nSproat, 432 F. Supp. 1130, 1135-36 (S.D. Miss. 1977); Pena v. New \nYork State Division for Youth, 419 F. Supp. 203, 207 (S.D.N.Y. \n1976).  Oakley and Columbia youth, however, receive inadequate \nrehabilitative treatment.  We found that counselors and \npsychologists are the staff responsible for rehabilitative \ntreatment.  Psychiatrists are contracted for only one day a month \nat both facilities.  The majority of their time is spent \nconducting forensic evaluations for the court, rather than \nproviding mental health or rehabilitative treatment to youth. \nStaff assigned to the housing units, such as juvenile \ncorrectional officers, function as security and play no role in \n\n-18 \n\nthe youths’ rehabilitative treatment.  There is little or no \ninteraction between the various disciplines regarding youths’ \nstrengths and needs or rehabilitative treatment.  The lack of \ncommunication between staff hampers their ability to provide a \nrehabilitative environment.  Indeed, the programs’ current focus \non discipline, control, and negative reinforcement fosters an \natmosphere where staff demean, belittle, and abuse youth and is \nnot conducive to rehabilitative treatment. \nOakley and Columbia counselors have masters degrees and the \nqualifications to provide effective rehabilitation, however, with \nthe average caseload of between 20 and 30 youth, individual goals \nare impossible to achieve.  For example, counselors routinely are \nunable to see youth individually or in group sessions.  Moreover, \ntherapy continuity is not maintained because counselors are \nreassigned when youth move from the basic to the advanced \nprogram.  Furthermore, counselors are responsible for \nimplementing youths’ individual treatment plans, but are not \ninvolved in the development of the plans.  Counselors, typically, \ndecide which goals they will work on with the youth and as a \nresult youths receive canned group sessions, such as, “obey \nauthority” or “value an education,” which have little \nrehabilitative value.  A senior mental health employee at Oakley \nadmitted that youth do not receive individualized rehabilitative \ntreatment. \n1.  Individual Treatment Plans \nBoth facilities rely solely on individual treatment plans \n(“ITPs”) provided by the youth court, rather than developing an \nindividualized plan once the youth arrives at the facility. \nUnfortunately, the courts’ ITPs are not comprehensive and fail to \nevaluate the youth’s mental health status.  Youth are not \ninvolved in their own treatment planning, nor are the counselors \nor the youths’ parents.  In addition, youths’ ITPs repeatedly \ncontained the diagnosis of “conduct disorder, alcohol abuse, \ncannabis abuse, strong borderline and antisocial personality \ntraits.”  Given the time constraints, lack of information, and \nthe absence of individual sessions with youth, it is not clear \nhow the youth courts’ psychologists could make appropriate \ndiagnoses.  The fact that many diagnoses are remarkably similar \nheightens this concern. \n2.  Anti-Therapeutic Conditions \n\n-19 \nMany of the conditions at Columbia do not promote \nrehabilitation or good mental health, but instead cause \ndepression and mental deterioration.  In the evenings, youth are \nrequired to sit in silence for large blocks of time while they \nsort their clothes, clean their boots, or for girls, braid each \nother’s hair.  This time could be better spent productively \nengaged in activity and learning.  The environment as it \ncurrently exists invites acting out by youth and the abusive \ninstitutional practices that too often follow.  For example, \nyouth are forced to perform physical exercise and threatened with \nSIU if they are caught talking to each other.  In fact, youth \nexpressed frustration at the wasted time and lack of \nrehabilitation services being offered in the evenings.  Lack of \nactivity, social interaction, and counseling assistance put youth \nat risk for depression. \nMany of the conditions at Oakley and Ironwood, similarly, \nare harsh and do not promote rehabilitation.  Oakley’s SIU is \npurportedly used to address the needs of the most vulnerable \nboys, but instead, functions like an adult prison.  Instead of \naddressing the boys’ mental health or rehabilitative treatment \nneeds, boys are either locked in isolated cells (where they are \nsometimes also shackled) or shackled and forced to perform work \ndetails around the campus in order to earn their way out of the \nSIU.  They are not permitted to attend school or receive any \neducational instruction, and are provided limited access to \ncounseling.  Except for work details, the boys are permitted out \nof their cells only once a day to exercise in the hallway, but \nmust eat their meals in their cells. \nOn the day of our arrival to Oakley, we observed a 13-year-\nold boy sitting in a restraint chair near the Ironwood control \nroom.  Reportedly, he was placed in the restraint chair to \nprevent self-mutilation.  No staff approached him, and he was not \nallowed to attend school or receive programming, counseling, or \nmedication.  This boy had been severely sexually and physically \nabused by family members and had been in several psychiatric \nhospitals prior to being sent to Ironwood.  Just before our \narrival, he had been locked naked in his empty cell.  His cell \nsmelled of urine, and we observed torn pieces of toilet paper on \nthe concrete floor that he had been using as a pillow. \n3.  The Military Program \n\n-20 \nThe use of paramilitary programs at youth training schools \nis not, in itself, unconstitutional.  However, our experts noted, \nand it is generally accepted, that four segments of the youth \npopulation at Oakley and Columbia are particularly unsuitable for \nparamilitary programs:  younger boys, girls, youth with \ndevelopmental disabilities, and youth who are emotionally or \nphysically fragile. \nThe disciplinary practices are particularly harmful to the \nyounger boys at Columbia who are physically, emotionally, or \npsychologically unable to participate fully in the training \nprogram.  Young boys at Columbia are not developmentally suited \nto benefit from the military approach.  Many staff perceived that \nthis particular population was noncompliant and anti-authority, \nwhen in reality, many of the boys are merely active third, fourth \nand fifth graders with short attention spans.  The result is that \nthe younger boys stay at Columbia longer because they are \nconsidered behavior problems.  A Columbia counselor told us: \nYou can’t change developmental stages.  They are not \nready.  They are playful . . . .  The young kids \nusually stay longer, usually four to six months - \nthere is no tolerance for their silly behavior, so they \nhave to start over.  Many have ADHD [Attention Deficit \nHyperactivity Disorder], and they have an especially \nhard time, partly because the doctor here usually takes \nthem off medication -- they are not really defiant, but \nthey can’t be judged the same as the older kids.  I do \na lot of counseling with young kids who cry and really \nmiss their families.  They get depressed. \nAdditionally, the counselor stated that a suggestion had been \nmade by other counselors to place at least the younger boys in a \nseparate unit.  However, they were told there was insufficient \nstaff to run it.  In our experts’ opinions, the military program \nis ineffective and harmful for younger boys. \nColumbia’s paramilitary program also is unsuitable for some \nof the troubled girls it serves.  Our expert noted that girls may \nmake some self-esteem gains in physically challenging programs \nbut the girls at Columbia are deriving no benefits, physical or \notherwise, from the program that is currently being administered. \nHarsh disciplinary practices are characterized as training.  A \nJune 2002 log book entry shows that a facility manager punished a \ngirl by requiring her to sleep one hour and walk one hour for two \n\n-21 \n\nsuccessive nights.  This same girl also had to eat every meal \nstanding for one week thereafter.  These punishments are largely \nunregulated and in some cases endorsed by supervisory personnel \nbecause they are considered military training.  From a juvenile \njustice and mental health perspective, the military program is \ninappropriate for girls who have a history of being victimized \nand abused either physically or sexually. \nA paramilitary program also is inappropriate for youth with \nlearning or developmental disabilities.  Youth are only permitted \nto move to the ‘advanced’ unit once they have met behavioral \nobjectives and passed a written and oral test on military \nprocedures.  Youth with learning or developmental disabilities \nhave difficulty passing the test and serve longer commitments \nbecause they cannot move beyond the basic phase of the program. \nOne counselor stated that, “[a]t least ten percent are \ndevelopmentally slow, and the staff don’t understand low-\nfunctioning kids.  They can’t make it.”  For example, staff made \nfun of a girl who had both physical and cognitive impairments. \nThis girl was just learning to read and was unable to earn a \ngrade higher than 70 on the military test the youth must pass in \norder to move from the basic to the advanced phase of the \nprogram.  Her peers were concerned that she would never be able \nto pass the test.  Youth with learning and developmental \ndisabilities are particularly inappropriate for the programs \noffered at Oakley and Columbia. \nFinally, youth who are physically or emotionally fragile are \nsingled out and made to feel worse because of their fragility. \nBoys at Oakley reported staff routinely picked on boys who were \nsmall in size, emotionally sensitive, or had difficulty adjusting \nto the military program.  Some, but not all, of these boys may be \nplaced in Unit Two’s Magnolia Cottage for boys who for medical or \npsychological reasons are considered inappropriate for the \nphysical training component of the military program.  However, \nboys in Magnolia Cottage are verbally and physically abused by \nstaff during non-physical components of the military program as \noften as the emotionally and physically vulnerable boys in other \ncottages.  A 15-year-old former resident of Magnolia Cottage who \nwas moved to the SIU told us that he tried to perform well in the \nnon-physical aspects of the program but was sensitive to being \nteased by staff and had difficulty controlling his reactions, \nwhich precipitated his being sent to isolation in SIU.  The \nMagnolia Cottage residents confirmed his account.  Again, from a \njuvenile justice and a mental health perspective, the \n\n-22 \n\nparamilitary training program, even when the physical aspects are \neliminated, is not only ineffective, but harmful to such youth. \nD.  Medical and Dental Care \nYouth at Columbia and Oakley receive inadequate medical and \ndental care. \n1.  Quality of Care \nStaff shortages and a lack of medical leadership have \ngreatly affected the ability of staff to provide necessary \nmedical services to youth at Oakley and Columbia.  No one is \naccountable for Oakley and Columbia’s medical program.  Neither \nthe facility director nor anyone in the Division of Youth \nServices or the Department of Human Services is directly \nresponsible for primary care at either facility. \nColumbia has only two full-time Licensed Practical Nurses \n(LPNs) providing services for a 200 bed juvenile facility with an \naverage of 13 new admissions every week.  Oakley has five full-\ntime LPNs and a full-time contract RN servicing a population that \ncan reach up to 400 with 15 to 25 new admissions every week.  At \nOakley and Columbia, LPNs are unsupervised and given \nresponsibilities beyond their scope of practice.  In short, the \nLPNs are practicing medicine without a license. \nOakley and Columbia do not have full-time physician \nassistants or nurse practitioners on staff and both have several \nvacant nursing positions.  Oakley’s contract physician sees \npatients approximately four hours per week with half of his time \nperforming clinical exams on new admissions; Columbia’s contract \nphysician sees patients three hours per week.  The physicians at \nOakley and Columbia are contracted solely for clinical care and \nhave no responsibility for the nursing staff or ensuring that \npolicies and procedures are followed.  The result is that access \nto adequate medical care is very limited.  Also, responses to \nhealth issues such as chronic disease care and health education \nare virtually non-existent. \nColumbia and Oakley routinely fail to continue youths’ pre \nexisting medical regimens after they are committed to the \ntraining schools.  At Columbia, medicines are often discontinued \nupon arrival.  Even asthmatic youth do not receive follow-up care \nto ensure that their cases are being managed.  For example, a \n\n-23 \n\ngirl was admitted to Columbia with a history of asthma.  She was \nnot asked about her medical history during her initial exam.  She \nsubsequently told the nurse about her inhaler and that it \nprevented asthma attacks if used prior to exercise.  The youth \nnever received an inhaler.  While performing exercises, she began \nto have an asthma attack.  She was not allowed to see the nurse \nand was told to continue to exercise or be punished for \ndisobedience.  In a highly restricted environment where access to \nmedical services is limited, acutely asthmatic youth must have \nroutine, scheduled follow-up care. \nWe found that nurses at Oakley do not routinely follow-up \nwith youth after providing rescue inhalers.  Poor care can cause \nsevere illness in youth as the following example illustrates:  A \nyouth was admitted to Oakley in May 2002.  He had a history of \nasthma and was hospitalized for acute asthma one month prior to \nhis admission to Oakley.  Several asthma medications were sent \nwith him to Oakley including singulair and maxair.  These and all \nother medications were discontinued upon his arrival.  Moreover, \nmedical staff made no attempt to find out his prior medical \nhistory.  Two days after his admission, he developed acute asthma \nand suffered from shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing for \nat least a week.  The only treatment provided by the nurse was a \nrescue inhaler.  The youth was finally examined by the physician \nwho noted that his vital signs were significantly abnormal, but \nsent the youth back to his cottage without treatment.  Another \nfive days passed before the youth was permitted a consultation \nwith an asthma specialist who subsequently prescribed singulair \nand maxair. \nThe facilities fail to maintain equipment or lack equipment \nto provide essential emergency services.  Columbia’s medical \nclinic contained old, rusty, dirty, and sharp equipment stored in \neasily-accessible places such as unlocked drawers and trays on \nthe counter in the examination room.  Equipment that could be \nstolen easily and used as weapons such as scissors, razor blades \nand even a scalpel blade were left unattended and readily \naccessible to youth on a cart in the exam room rather than \nsecurely stored.  The medical clinics at both facilities do not \ncarry adequate emergency or medical equipment.  For instance, the \nclinics do not carry oxygen or syringes which are necessary for \nemergencies, or basic medical equipment such as needles with \nengineered controls used to prevent injury to health staff. \n\n-24 \n\nStaff fail to follow basic universal precautions which have \nled to dangerous health hazards for youth in the facilities.  A \nnurse at Oakley was observed by our expert giving one resident a \npre-filled syringe of the hepatitis B immunization.  She \naccidentally inserted the same needle into the arm of the next \nresident before realizing her mistake.  Moreover, a scalpel blade \nis repeatedly used by Columbia’s facility physician to shave \nwarts, permitting the transmission of blood-borne pathogens from \npatient to patient.  In violation of standard medical practice \nand at the risk of contamination, Oakley staff store food in the \nsame refrigerator as pharmaceuticals such as immunizations and \ncontrol solutions to analyze blood.  Our expert noted that the \nOakley physician conducted nine examinations in one day and never \nchanged the roll of paper that lined the surface of the \nexamination table. \n2.  Health Assessments \nColumbia and Oakley’s health assessments are incomplete, and \nnecessary intake services are not provided.  Both facilities fail \nto give tuberculosis skin tests upon admission even though \nMississippi is in the top quartile of states with annual \nincidence of the disease.  Moreover, identified medical histories \nare not pursued.  For example, a girl at Columbia had a history \nof thrombocytopenia.14  No platelet count was obtained upon \nadmission to assess the status of disease activity or to \ndetermine risk of internal bleeding.  This is of great concern \nbecause she is expected to be a full participant in the military \nprogram.  Furthermore, abnormal medical findings are not pursued. \nFor example, a youth at Columbia with a significantly low \nhematocrit15 did not receive further evaluation by the contract \nphysician or a specialist, nor did the youth receive any \ntreatment.  A female patient, also at Columbia, with a green \nvaginal discharge noted during her admission physical examination \nwas neither referred to the gynecologist nor provided treatment. \nAt Oakley, a patient who had blood in his urine was not referred \nto the contract physician and received no evaluation or \ntreatment.  Another boy with a history of asthma was admitted to \n14  Thrombocytopenia is a disease of the blood in which\nthere are too few platelets.  It is a condition that interferes \nwith clotting. \n15  A low hematocrit means that there is a lower than \nnormal level of red blood cells. \n\n-25 \n\nOakley.  Intake medical staff did not note this on his initial \nhealth assessment and other staff were reportedly unaware of his \nasthma until he suffered from shortness of breath for several \ndays while in military training.  At both facilities, past health \nrecords from medical providers and basic but necessary health \ninformation from parents or guardians are almost never obtained \nor requested. \n3.  Sick Call \nYouth must be provided sick call in a clinical setting where \nthey can discuss health problems confidentially with a qualified \nclinician.  Neither Oakley nor Columbia have an adequate sick \ncall protocol.  At Columbia, youth must verbally tell cottage \nstaff that they need to see the nurse.  Staff sometimes disregard \nthe requests, and other times call the nurse to evaluate the \nproblem.  The nurse may or may not see the child depending on \nwhat the staff tells her about the problem over the telephone. \nYouth may have an opportunity to see the nurse when she makes \nmedication rounds in the cottages or at other times she happens \nto be in the cottages.  This evaluation is not done \nconfidentially, but where cottage staff and other residents are \npresent.  The Acting Head Nurse reportedly curses at youth, \nignores medical requests, fails to provide medical advice to \ngirls about their female conditions, and consistently prevents \nyouth’s access to the doctor.  This nurse has denied assistance \nto girls who felt faint and dizzy from exercising in the heat. \nIn one instance, a girl was injured after falling on her knee \nwhich swelled into a large knot.  Staff allowed her to see the \nActing Head nurse in the cafeteria.  The nurse did nothing for \nher knee.  When this youth saw another nurse, she referred her to \nthe physician who treated her knee. \n4.  Inadequate Dental Care \nColumbia and Oakley do not have adequate dental programs. \nThe medical policies and procedures for both facilities do not \nrequire routine initial dental assessments.  Initial dental \nassessments and treatment should be  part of the overall health \nassessment of every youth admitted to Oakley and Columbia. \nColumbia has not had a contract dentist since December 2001. \nTherefore, dental screening, examination, and oral hygiene, among \nother important components of an adequate dental care program, \nwere non-existent.  It appears that when Columbia did have a \ndentist, the only services that were provided were extractions. \n\n-26 \n\nDental treatment is necessary to both maintain and restore oral \nstructures. \nThe dental program at Oakley raised additional concerns. \nThe dentist did not provide adequate dental examinations.  His \ndental assessments involved a simple inspection of the mouth \nwithout the aid of a light or a dental explorer.  We learned that \nthe dentist’s contract was not renewed after our first tour. \nHowever, it is unclear whether Oakley has contracted with another \ndentist for services.  In any case, no dentist should provide \nservices to youth in the dental clinic we observed.  The clinic \nwas extremely dirty and contained mouse droppings and cob webs. \nMedications in the cabinets had expired between 1991 and 1995. \nNeedles and other instruments were lying on counters and in \nunlocked drawers.  We recommended during our first tour of Oakley \nthat the dental clinic be shut down immediately until it is \nthoroughly cleaned. \nE.  Education \nYouth at Oakley and Columbia are entitled to an adequate \neducation and vocational training during commitment.  Morgan v. \nSproat, 432 F. Supp. 1130, 1140-41 (S.D. Miss. 1977) (Oakley must \nprovide sufficient education, vocational training and \nrecreation).  The State also is obligated to provide a free and \nappropriate education to qualified students under the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.  Some of the core provisions of the \nIDEA include parental notification, identification of students \nwho may be eligible for special education, evaluation of new \nadmissions, and individual education plan development and \nrevisions.  However, Oakley and Columbia fail to provide these \nand other general education services such as ensuring that youth \nreceive the required number of class hours per day and \neducational services within a reasonable amount of time after \ncommitment.  They also fail to provide most special education \nservices and fail to properly screen for youth who may be in need \nof such services. \n1.  Delay in Providing Educational Services \nOakley and Columbia youth do not attend school for several \nweeks after admission.  At Oakley, the administrator, school \nprincipal, staff, and youth told us that youth committed for the \nfirst time receive no education for three weeks.  Youth who are \n\n-27-\n\nre-committed receive no education for five weeks.  We also found \nthat youth were denied access to education services for periods \nlonger than three and five weeks.  We found that Oakley did not \nhave any policies governing these practices, which violate the \nMississippi Compulsory School Attendance Law.16  Pursuant to \npolicy, Columbia youth do not attend school for the first three \nweeks or more after admission which also is a violation of state \ncompulsory attendance laws and the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  See Donnell C. v. Illinois State Board of \nEducation, 829 F. Supp. 1016, 1018-19 (N.D. Ill. 1993).  Unless \nunforeseen circumstances occur, youth should be provided with \neducational services soon after admission in accordance with \nstate and federal law. \n2.  General Education \nAlthough we encountered some well-intentioned teachers and \nschool administrators at both facilities, the structural problems \nof the school program coupled with the absence of support and \nresources results in an education program that is sorely \ninadequate and fails to meet the needs of students. \n(a)  Programming at Columbia and Oakley \nColumbia has strengths that can be improved upon, such as a \nschool environment that is conducive to learning, properly \ncertified teachers who are given adequate time for planning, \nadequate space and educational materials, a computer lab, a well-\nequipped library, and a GED program for age-appropriate girls. \nIn comparison, Oakley’s program suffers from a serious lack of \nleadership and little staff support.  Oakley’s principal admitted \nthat his focus is on Unit Two, leaving the Unit One school \nprogram to be administered by an interim facility administrator \nand Ironwood to be run by a teacher.  Oakley’s SIU has no school \nprogram.  Youth in Unit Two at Oakley were observed simply \nsitting in class rooms and not engaged in any school work. \nTeachers typically provide little instruction there or in \n16  We have been informed since our education tour of \nOakley that it was changing the structure of its military and\neducation programs to provide youth with education services\nwithin one week of admission.  We were not provided with\ndocumentation of how this transition was to occur nor the current \nstatus of its implementation. \n\n-28 \n\nIronwood.  The youth in Unit One, however, appeared to be engaged \nin class room activity. \nMost youth at Oakley and Columbia are not receiving the full \nstate mandated class time, which is a violation of Mississippi’s \ncompulsory education laws.17  Youth routinely are pulled from \nclass for significant periods of time to perform work details or \nparticipate in “recreation” such as card playing, contributing to \nthis violation. \nOakley and Columbia do not have policies to ensure that \nyouth are placed in appropriate classes, have balanced class \nsizes or are taught appropriate subject matter.  Moreover, an \nanalysis of class subjects taken by youth shows that youth are \nnot receiving the full benefit of class instruction in core \nsubjects at either Columbia or Oakley.  The population of youth \nat Columbia and Oakley include those with severe academic \ndeficiencies who function well-below grade level.  Yet, only 40 \npercent of Columbia youth attend classes in the four core \nacademic subjects:  math, English, social studies, and science. \nOtherwise, youth are enrolled in classes such as “Life Skills” \nand “Family Dynamics.”  In light of the population that Columbia \nserves, these elective courses should be a supplement to the four \ncore subjects, not in place of them.  Some core academic courses \nat Columbia were linked into one class such as “math/science” and \n“reading/social studies.”  While there is a logical integration \nof these subjects, youth are unable to master all of the \ncompetencies required for both courses during a single class \nperiod.  This is troubling because youths’ grades are forwarded \nto home schools, reflecting credit for two core classes when they \ninstructionally receive less than that. \nFurthermore, Columbia does not employ substitute teachers to \ncover classes when teachers are sick or on vacation.  When a \nteacher is absent, youth are regularly placed in “overflow” which \nmeans that youth are divided into other classes in session during \nthat time period.  Youth reported that they were not given any \nwork to do in these situations, but were required to sit in the \nclass and be silent.  There also are no substitute teachers \nemployed at Oakley for absent teachers. \n17  Even though Oakley’s and Columbia’s education structure\nprovides for the State mandated 330 minutes of instruction, a\nmajority of the students do not receive 330 minutes of\ninstruction per day. \n\n-29 \nSchool records from youths’ home schools should be obtained \nso that youth are placed in appropriate classes at Oakley and \nColumbia.  However, we found that youths’ files rarely contained \npublic school records.  Neither facility had a protocol for \nreceiving records from non-responsive school systems.  We were \ntold during our tour at Columbia that the school planned to be \nlinked to the Mississippi Student Information System which will \nprovide access to youths’ most recent transcripts.  However, \nuntil that connection is made, Columbia and Oakley must develop a \nsystem for receiving and maintaining permanent and cumulative \nrecords containing academic information. \n(b) \t Education services for youth in disciplinary \nisolation \nYouth are not provided with adequate education in the SIUs \nat Oakley and Columbia.  The lack of education in the SIUs at \nColumbia was the most glaring denial of access to education \nservices in the facilities.  Youth can be locked up for two or \nmore weeks without attending school.  If a youth is “committed” \nto the SIU program, then a youth is in lock-up for several months \nand education is limited and often-times sporadic.  The boys in \nSIU who had access to educational programming received \napproximately 45 minutes to an hour of class time less than two \ndays per week and did not receive any instruction the week prior \nto our visit.  In addition, all of the boys in the SIU class \nreceived the same work assignments despite differences in their \nages, abilities, and academic levels.  Girls received only two \nhours of education per day, except on Tuesdays when no academic \nclasses were held. \nAt Oakley, youth in the SIU are denied education for the \nduration of their confinement.  Confinement may be for one to \nseven or more days and students may be sent back to the SIU \nsuccessively, causing even more disruption in their education. \nThe Ironwood program has one unsupervised teacher responsible for \nteaching up to 25 youth.  Youth in Ironwood receive approximately \nthree hours of instruction two days per week, but not all \nstudents receive the benefit of this minimal programming.  Some \nwho had been locked in Ironwood 90 days or more reported rarely \nbeing taken out of their cells for class and others reported \nbeing given materials in their cells, but given no pencils, which \nlimited their ability to do the assignments.  We respect the \nfacilities’ legitimate security concerns, however, youth \ncommitted to the SIUs should have access to the full range of \n\n-30 \n\neducational services in order for Columbia and Oakley to be in \ncompliance with Mississippi compulsory education laws. \n3.  Special Education \nThe problems we encountered with the provision of special \neducation services at both facilities were pervasive.  Oakley and \nColumbia fail to follow key provisions of the IDEA and other \nspecial education services mandates.  School administrators at \nboth facilities were either unaware of the IDEA or erroneously \nbelieved their schools were exempt from its requirements.  For \ninstance, Oakley’s principal believed Oakley was exempt from core \nIDEA provisions because of an agreement between the Mississippi \nDepartment of Human Services and Mississippi Department of \nEducation.  Oakley and Columbia are not exempt from the IDEA. \n(a)  Screening, evaluation and identification \nPursuant to the IDEA, Oakley and Columbia are responsible \nfor screening, evaluating, and identifying youths suspected of \nhaving a qualifying disability which would entitle them to \nspecial education services.  Yet, neither facility has a \nstructured mechanism to screen potentially eligible youth.  The \nfacilities rely heavily on school records from community schools \nto identify youth eligible for special education services. \nHowever, youth may not have been attending school regularly prior \nto their commitment, so reliance on school records alone is not \nenough.  Furthermore, as discussed earlier, we found that youths’ \nfiles rarely contained public school records.  The IDEA requires \nthat eligibility be determined by a team of qualified \nprofessionals, the child, and the parent or guardian, if \navailable. \nFurthermore, we found that ineligible youth are being placed \nin special education while many other students who may be \neligible are never identified and denied access to services in \nviolation of federal law.  At Oakley, a youth was given four \nsegments of special education services a day, but the special \neducation teacher could not identify the student’s eligibility \nfor these classes.  The student’s file contained no information \nregarding the reason for placement in special education courses. \nWhen asked why this student was in special education, the teacher \nresponded that the student did not do well in math.  Six other \nstudents’ files contained no information documenting the reason \nfor their placement in special education classes.  Another \n\n-31 \n\nstudent was receiving four segments of special education services \nper day as required by his expired individual education plan. \nHowever, his psychological report indicated that his IQ was 66 \nwhich brings the appropriateness of his placement at Oakley into \nquestion, given that youth with mental retardation are not \nsupposed to be placed at Oakley or Columbia. \n(b)  Individual Education Plans \nThe foundation of the special education process is the \ndevelopment and implementation of an individual education plan \n(“IEP”) for each qualified youth.  See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. \n305, 311 (1988); see also 34 C.F.R. § 300.341(a).  The facilities \nhave failed to create a system of developing, implementing, \nmonitoring, and reviewing students’ IEPs.  None of the special \neducation teachers at Oakley were able to produce a current, \nvalid IEP for any of the youth in their classes.  Furthermore, \nIEPs contained identical, rather than individualized, goals and \nobjectives.  IEPs did not contain, for example, statements of \npresent levels of performance or measurable annual goals and \nobjectives as required by law, and no IEP meetings have been \nheld, in part, because teachers and administrators were unaware \nthat youth must be re-evaluated periodically to keep IEPs \ncurrent.  Eligible youth must have an IEP completed for each \nschool year.  Schools must offer a continuum of placement options \nfor special education students.  Oakley only has two of the four \noptions available while Columbia has no options available for \neligible youth. \nParents and guardians at Columbia and Oakley are not \nnotified regarding evaluations, eligibility determinations, \nplacements, or provision of special education services.  Parent \nor guardian participation in every step of the process is a \nguiding principle of the IDEA which is being violated by both \nfacilities. \n(c)  Related and Transition Services \nRelated services, such as individual and family counseling, \nspeech pathology, and psychological services, must be provided \nwhere indicated so that youth receive the maximum benefit of \nspecial education.  See 34 C.F.R. § 300.24.  The few related \nservices that had been available at Columbia have been \ndiscontinued and they have never been provided at Oakley. \n\n-32 \nChildren eligible for special education 14 years of age and \nolder also are entitled to transition services.  Transition \nservices include vocational training, continuing education, or \nemployment services.  Columbia provides no transition services \nfor students’ re-entry into their home communities -- another \nviolation of federal law.  Oakley offers some limited \nopportunities for vocational training.  However, only students \nwho achieve a certain score on the Test of Adult Basic Education \nare permitted to take the vocational courses.  This requirement \ntypically excludes special education children and limits Oakley’s \nability to provide legally-required transition services.  The \nvocational program should be expanded and made more inclusive, \nparticularly in the provision of transitional services to special \neducation students. \nF.  Religion \nReligious activities can further a juvenile facility’s \nrehabilitative mission.  Moreover, Oakley and Columbia must allow \nyouth to engage in religious exercise through voluntary religious \nactivities, unless the facilities can demonstrate that curtailing \nsuch activities would be the least restrictive means of achieving \na compelling governmental interest.  See Religious Land Use and \nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc. \nHowever, Oakley and Columbia’s interests in affording youth the \nbenefits of religious activities have led to the “establishment” \nof religion in violation of the First Amendment by coercing youth \nto engage in specific religious activities. \nDuring our first visit to Oakley, we observed youth-led \nprayer during the graduation ceremony which occurs every \nWednesday morning and which youth in Unit Two are required to \nattend or face discipline.  Furthermore, Oakley staff informed us \nthat for two weeks following our visit, the youth would be \nattending Vacation Bible School.  We observed posters containing \nreligious material such as the “The Lord’s Prayer” and other \nBible verses hanging on the walls in military training classrooms \nand in counseling rooms in the cottages.  Mandatory prayer and \nthe posting of religious literature in the common areas of state \nfacilities for youth violates the Establishment Clause.  See \nEngel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962) (holding that classroom \nprayer at the beginning of each school day violates the \nEstablishment Clause); Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S. 39, 39 (1981) \n(finding that posting the Ten Commandments on the walls of \nclassrooms violates the Establishment Clause). \n\n-33 \nAt Columbia, youth are required to attend religious services \nat the church every Sunday.  Some girls reported they would be \nsubject to discipline if they did not sing during services.  The \nfacility administrator stated that youth had the option of not \nattending the Sunday worship services if they chose not to, but \nboth boys and girls indicated that attending Sunday worship \nservices was a requirement or they would be disciplined.  Youth \nalso must participate in a religious service in their cottages \nevery Tuesday evening or face discipline.  The only reading \nmaterial the children in the SIUs and some of the housing units \nare allowed to possess is the Bible.  We witnessed a mandatory \ngroup counseling session in the boys’ SIU in which youth were \nrequired to read Bible verses and sing religious songs. \nIn each of these cases, youth were required to engage in \nspecific religious activities and were subject to disciplinary \naction if they did not participate.  As discussed above, these \nare the same types of activities that the Supreme Court has found \nto amount to the State sponsorship of particular religious \nbeliefs.  Moreover, none of these activities are required to \nmaintain facility security or for any other operational purpose. \nTherefore, these activities violate the Establishment Clause. \nWe emphasize that we are not suggesting that all religious \npractices at Oakley or Columbia must stop.  In fact, the Free \nExercise Clause of the First Amendment protects the youths’ \nrights to engage in voluntary religious activity.  In light of \nthe unique nature of the correctional setting, facilitating \njuveniles’ religious exercise may require a degree of State \ninvolvement in religious activities that would not be appropriate \nin other settings.  For example, courts have held that it is \npermissible for the State to pay for chaplains in order to \naccommodate the religious exercise of those under State custody \nand control.  See Katcoff v. Marsh, 755 F.2d 223 (2d Cir. 1985) \n(upholding military chaplaincy program); Carter v. Broadlawns \nMedical Center, 857 F.2d 448 (8th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 \nU.S. 1096 (1989) (holding the county hospital’s hiring of\nchaplain did not violate the Establishment Clause).  Likewise, \nwhile having a chapel in a public school would clearly violate \nthe Constitution, chapels are present in most large correctional \nfacilities.  Similarly, substance abuse programs that incorporate \nfaith, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, are used by correctional \nfacilities and probation departments throughout the country. \nSuch programs are permissible under the Establishment Clause, \nthough participants objecting to the religious elements must be \n\n-34 \n\ngiven a secular alternative if participation is mandatory.  See \nWarner v. Orange County Dep’t of Probation, 115 F.3d 1068  (2d \nCir. 1997). \nTo comply with the Constitution, Oakley and Columbia need \nnot excise religion from their facilities or programs.  However, \nthey must ensure that they do not coerce the youth to engage in \nreligious activities by making all such activities voluntary. \nAlso, the exhibition of religious posters in common areas should \nbe limited to areas where the juveniles are voluntarily present, \nsuch as a room where a religious service or religious instruction \nis being held. \nG.  Safety and Sanitation \n1.  Oakley \nOakley’s buildings and grounds are unsafe and unsanitary, \ncreating unconstitutional confinement conditions for youth. \n(a)  Physical Plant \nOakley’s campus contains old administration buildings and \nhousing units which require constant upkeep and maintenance. \nUnfortunately, Oakley’s maintenance staff consists of four \nemployees who have received little or no training.  These four \nindividuals are required to maintain all of the buildings, \ncontrol pest and rodent infestation, and mow and landscape the \nexpansive grounds.  There is no facility safety officer. \n(1)  Administration Buildings \nThe medical and dental clinics pose numerous safety hazards \nto Oakley’s youth and staff.  The Unit II Medical Clinic is a \ndecrepit building with many water leaks that have created \nstructural damage.  The isolation room within the building is not \nequipped or constructed for its purpose which is to isolate youth \nwith respiratory or gastrointestinal problems.  Even more \nconcerning is that there is no sterilization equipment in the \nclinic to clean medical instruments.  Moreover, supplies and \nequipment were not properly stored to maintain any kind of \nsterilization.  The dental clinic had not been cleaned in many \nmonths because we observed dirt, spider webs, mouse droppings, \nand dead roaches everywhere.  It was apparent that the clinic has \na major insect and rodent infestation. \n\n-35 \nThe kitchen had several deficiencies.  First, rodent and \ninsect infestation are causing unsanitary conditions.  We saw \nmouse droppings in the food storage areas and live and dead \ncockroaches in the kitchen.  Kitchen staff stated that they had \nto cover food while cooking to prevent cockroaches from falling \nin from the hood above the stove.  Youth also complained about \nfinding roaches in their food.  Many areas of the kitchen were \nunclean and some areas invited roach infestation.  Second, water \ntemperatures in the kitchen created unsafe conditions.  The \ntemperatures were high enough to cause first degree burns in a \nmatter of seconds.  Also, the water temperature and pressure in \nthe dishwashing machine were improperly set so that dishes were \nnot always clean. \nThe vocational training area, which includes the auto-body, \nsmall engine repair, welding, and carpentry shops, had a number \nof safety hazards.  Our expert observed numerous mislabeled or \nunlabeled chemicals stored around the trade areas.  There were no \n“Material Safety Data Sheets” relating to the chemicals in these \nareas, which inform staff how to handle and store this type of \nmaterial.  The sheets also provide important safety and emergency \ninformation on the chemicals.  For example, a “chemical reducer” \nwas located uncovered on a shelf in the auto-body shop, where the \nwarning label clearly warns against this.  Also, gas cylinders \nused for torches and welding were not properly secured.  This \nfact, coupled with the fact that the areas have no fire sprinkler \nsystem and that the fire extinguishers have not been properly \ninspected, creates an extreme fire hazard.  Furthermore, the \nexhaust system in the painting booth was inoperable. \nThe gymnasium at Oakley is supposed to be used for \nrecreation.  Unfortunately, during our visit much of it was \nunuseable because of water leaks from the roof.  The locker \nrooms, showers, and stage area were not operable because of \ndisrepair and flooding.  The boy’s restroom was dirty and the \nfloor was in disrepair.  The girl’s restroom was in poor repair \nand had no hot water. \n(2)  Housing Units \nThe housing units at Oakley are divided into dormitories and \ncottages in Unit II and pods in Unit I, Ironwood, and the SIU. \nTwo older cottages in Unit II, Cypress and White cottages, are in \nextremely poor physical condition.  Cypress and White cottages \nsuffer from age and deterioration and are not regularly \n\n-36 \n\nmaintained.  We observed the following problems in Cypress: \npaint peeling from ceiling and walls, three out of the four \nurinals were not operational, three of the eight showers were not \noperational, and showers were only operable through the control \nroom.  In other Unit II, SIU, and Ironwood housing, many \nbathrooms had not been maintained properly with walls and \nceilings in poor repair and many washbasins, showers, and toilets \nnot operable.  Furthermore, SIU and Ironwood’s housing set-up \ndoes not allow youth access to toilets or washbasins without \ngetting the attention of staff.  Youth also share one bar of soap \nduring showers. \nThe housing units suffer from numerous other problems. \nLighting in the living units varied greatly.  There were numerous \nareas in which the lighting was so poor that it invited accidents \nand certainly eyestrain.  Hot water temperatures varied \nsubstantially between the housing units.  Temperatures varied \nbetween 81 and 135 degrees.  Air temperature and humidity were \ngenerally in the acceptable range, but a few living units were \nextremely cold because of too much air conditioning.  There were \nnumerous examples of mis-stored chemicals and cleaning supplies, \nsuch as, a dirty mop head stored next to clean sheets and \nunderwear.  Many of the youth’s mattresses were worn far beyond \ntheir useful life.  In this condition, they cannot be adequately \ncleaned or sanitized and are fire safety risks.  Youth sleep on \nthe floor in crowded housing units or if the youth is on suicide \nprecautions. \n(b)  Pest Control \nIn addition to what has already been discussed above, pest \ncontrol in the housing units at Oakley is woefully lacking. \nThere were rat burrows behind Cypress cottage, mice and roaches \nin the Unit I medical clinic, and roach infestations in Elm \ncottage and the SIU. \n(c)  Fire Safety \nIn an April 2002 fire inspection report, a fire marshal \ndetermined that four of the living units and the Unit II school \ndid not have an operable fire alarm system.  The report also \nfound that the staff lacked adequate training and understanding \nfor emergency situations.  At the time of our visit three months \nlater, these issues still had not been addressed.  Other fire \nsafety concerns included:  emergency generators that required \n\n-37 \n\nhand cranking; Pine cottage’s only fire extinguisher was \npartially discharged; Cypress cottage’s only fire extinguisher \nwas behind a locked door and the fire exit was locked and barred; \nand generally staff had a difficult time finding the right keys \nfor fire extinguishers and fire exits. \n2.  Columbia \nIn general, we found the Columbia facility in better \ncondition than the Oakley campus,18 but found the following \nproblems:  (1) potentially dangerous areas in the housing units \nfor youth with suicidal ideation;19 and (2) sweltering \ntemperatures in the girl’s SIU with girls having no access to \nwater. \nH.  Other Juvenile Justice Issues \n1.  Lack of Due Process \nYouth routinely are locked in isolation in the SIUs at \nOakley and Columbia, and in Ironwood at Oakley, without adequate \ndue process.  As a general rule, juveniles may be isolated and \nlocked briefly in their rooms as an immediate response to out-of-\ncontrol behavior that may endanger the youth, other children, or \nstaff.  However, extended isolation for punitive purposes may \nonly be imposed if the youth is afforded notice of the charges \nand after an informal hearing before a staff member not involved \nin the incident.  Moreover, the youth should be able to appeal \nadverse results of the due process hearing.  Cf. H.C. v. Jarrard, \n786 F.2d 1080, 1082 (11th Cir. 1986); Gary H. v. Hegstrom, 831 \nF.2d 1430, 1443 (9th Cir. 1987); Patterson v. Hopkins, 481 F.2d \n640, 641 (5th Cir. 1973).  Both Oakley and Columbia have policies \ndetailing adequate due process procedures to which youth are \nentitled before being placed in disciplinary isolation.  However, \nactual practices at both facilities deviate substantially from \nwritten policy.  For example, a disciplinary committee at \n18  At Columbia, there were some general maintenance issues\nfor some of the older housing units. \n19  For example, we observed metal hooks for hanging\nuniforms in the hallways of most of the basic and advanced\nhousing areas.  Metal grating with openings large enough to tie\noff a hanging device was found in several cells in the girls’\nSIU. \n\n-38 \n\nColumbia hears complaints against youth.  However, if a youth \nappears before the Committee and testifies to something other \nthan what the staff attests to, the youth is typically given \nadded time or punishment.  Youth sent to the SIUs do not receive \nthe benefit of the committee hearing prior to removal from the \ncottages and in fact may be confined in isolation for several \ndays before they receive word regarding their punishment or \nrelease back to the cottages.  Hearings are not provided to \nstudents at Oakley when they are removed from the open cottages \nand sent to Unit One, the SIU, or Ironwood.  Youth reported, and \nthe documentation we reviewed showed, that youth are routinely \nremoved to the secure, locked units based on recommendations from \nthe psychologist, the facility administrator, or the director of \nthe Division of Youth Services, without the opportunity for a \nhearing. \n2.  Grievance Process \nColumbia and Oakley youth have no ability to access a \ngrievance system designed to address their complaints regarding \ntheir treatment at the facilities.  Generally accepted \nprofessional standards mandate that youth should have readily \navailable access to a grievance process.  Where courts have \nconsidered this, they have uniformly found that detained youth \nhave a constitutional right to file grievances with facility \nadministrators regarding their treatment.  Bradley v. Hall, 64 \nF.3d 1276, 1279 (9th Cir. 1995); D.B. v. Tewksbury, 545 F. Supp. \n896, 905 (D.Or. 1982); Morales v. Turman, 364 F. Supp. 166, 175 \n(E.D. Tex. 1973).  An objective grievance system should be well \nknown to youth at Oakley and Columbia and be easily accessible. \nGrievances also provide an important quality-control mechanism by \nwhich Oakley and Columbia administrators can monitor whether \nfacility staff are adhering to policies and procedures. \n3.  Staff Training \nMany of the deficiencies we identified at each facility can \nbe directly attributed to lack of training.  Staff at both \nfacilities lacked adequate training in behavioral management \ntechniques, assessment of suicidal youth, crisis management, \npsychiatric medications, therapeutic techniques, verbal \ncommunication and de-escalation, and working with violent \njuveniles.  Staff also need to be trained in properly documenting \nserious incidents, use of physical and chemical restraints, and \nvisual checks of youth locked in cells.  Nurses at Oakley and \n\n-39 \n\nColumbia are not provided training to improve their skills and \nclinical competency and are not regularly trained and certified \nin CPR.  Staff at Oakley had not received any training in CPR, \nfirst aid, or other medical issues in recent years.  Staff at \nboth facilities are ill-equipped to handle emergencies. \n4.  Mail, Telephone, and Visitation \nYouth have the right to send and receive written \ncommunications through the postal service.  See Milonas v. \nWilliams, 691 F.2d 931, 939 (10th Cir. 1982).  Both Oakley and \nColumbia’s policies state that incoming and outgoing mail will \nnot be read by staff unless there is reasonable cause to believe \nthe mail is a threat to the security of the institution or \nanother individual, or contains sexually explicit or obscene \nmatter.  Youth at Columbia reported that their mail was censored. \nReportedly, correspondence to family or to youth court judges \nwhich mentioned anything negative about Columbia or the Columbia \nstaff was not mailed.  At both facilities, many youth indicated \nthat they were not given regular opportunities to write their \nfamilies.  Overly-restrictive practices with respect to mail, \ntelephone, and visitation work together to deny youth in both \nfacilities the ability to communicate with their families, \ncommunities, and attorneys. \nAdditionally, youth cannot make or receive telephone calls \nat Oakley and Columbia.  Families are permitted visits for only \ntwo hours on Sunday.  Many youth reported that families could not \nvisit because of the youth’s placement in a facility far from \nhome combined with such limited visitation opportunities.  This \nforced estrangement from their families negatively impacts \nyouths’ abilities to achieve success at the facilities. \n5.  Lack of Opportunities for Exercise at Ironwood \nIronwood staff do not allow youth to go outside for exercise \nin the recreation yard attached to the building.  During our \nfirst tour, more than half of the youth had been in Ironwood \nlonger than 90 days.  One youth had been confined in Ironwood for \nnearly two years and reported that he had never been allowed \n\n-40 \n\noutside even though there is a secure court in the back of the \nfacility.  This is unhealthy and inhumane, and unlawful.20 \nIII.  REMEDIAL MEASURES \nIn order to rectify the identified deficiencies and protect \nthe constitutional and statutory rights of the youth confined at \nOakley and Columbia, the facilities should implement, at a \nminimum, the following measures: \nA. \t Protection from Harm \n1.\t Ensure that any imposition of discipline is appropriate and \njustified by a legitimate, appropriate penological interest. \nEnsure that abusive institutional practices such as hog-\ntying, pole shackling, “sitting in a chair,” “guard duty,” \nmaking youth run with tires around their bodies, use of the \n“dark room” in the girls’ SIU at Columbia, and requiring \nyouth to strip naked before being placed in isolation, are \nceased immediately. \n2.\t Ensure that juveniles are adequately protected from staff \nabuse.  Employ sufficient trained and independent \ninvestigators to ensure that all incidents of violence, use \nof force, or serious injury are adequately investigated and \nthat appropriate personnel actions are taken in response to \nsubstantiated findings.  Ensure that OC spray is used only \nwhere there is an imminent risk of serious bodily harm and \nno other less intrusive restraint is available.  Ensure that \nall uses of OC spray or mechanical or chemical restraints \nare well-documented and reviewed in a timely manner by \nsenior administrators. \n3.\t Develop and implement adequate quality assurance mechanisms \nand review to ensure the efficacy of corrective measures. \nB. \t Mental Health Care \n20  Youth in confinement “must receive at least an hour’s \nphysical exercise out of the [unit] or in the gym . . . .” \nMorgan v. Sproat, 432 F. Supp. 1130, 1140 (S.D. Miss. 1977).\nYouth “should have at least one to two hours of recreation each \nweekday and two to four hours on weekends, when they are not in\nschool.”  Id. at 1154. \n\n-41 \n\n1. \t Provide adequate mental health and rehabilitative treatment. \n2. \t Ensure that there are an adequate number of counselors and \npsychologists and an adequate amount of contracted \npsychiatric hours to provide adequate mental health and \nrehabilitative treatment services to all youth who require \nsuch services. \n3. \t Ensure that all youth with mental health needs have current \ncomprehensive individual treatment plans, and that the \nyouth, and facility counselors, are involved in their \ndevelopment. \n4. \t Develop and implement policies and procedures that comply \nwith generally accepted professional standards for the \nmanagement of suicidal youth. \n5. \t Ensure that restraints and isolation other than disciplinary \nisolation are used only when a youth presents a clear and \npresent danger to him/herself or others.  Provide adequate \npositive behavior management programs. \n6. \t Cease placement of youth in isolation cells for prolonged \nperiods.  Ensure that youth placed in isolation cells \nreceive adequate exercise and recreation outdoors. \n7. \t Cease placement of mentally ill youth in programs and units \nwhere they cannot receive adequate mental health care or \nwhere they face a likelihood of punishment or other harm in \nresponse to their mental illness.  Cease placement of youth \nwith suicidal ideation at Ironwood or in the SIUs at Oakley \nand Columbia. \n8. \t Provide appropriate rehabilitative activities during non-\nschool hours and days. \n9.\t Cease placement of youths into paramilitary programs when, \nby reason of mental or physical disability or maturity \nlevel, the youth cannot reasonably be expected to obtain any \nsignificant benefit or the placement will likely result in \nphysical or psychological harm to the youths. \nC.  M\t edical Care \n\n-42 \n1. \t Staff all medical units with sufficient medical staff to \nscreen and evaluate incoming youth, and provide adequate \ntreatment and monitoring of youth with medical needs. \n2. \t Ensure that nurses provide medical care within the scope of \ntheir training and licensure. \n3. \t Train staff to conduct medical and mental health assessments \nproperly and to look for signs of mental and physical \nillness in the youth interviewed. \n4. \t Revise and implement procedures to ensure that youth \nreporting or exhibiting possible signs of significant \nmedical or mental health problems during the initial \nassessment are seen promptly by a doctor or psychiatrist, \nwhere appropriate, and receive follow-up care. \n5. \t Develop and implement procedures for validating and \ncontinuing, if appropriate, current prescriptions for \nmedications of incoming youth within the prescriptions’ \nclinically indicated time period. \n6. \t Ensure that the medical clinics at each facility are \nequipped with adequate equipment to provide essential \nemergency services.  Ensure that medical equipment that \ncould be used as weapons is not accessible to youth. \n7. \t Provide for an appropriately confidential environment in \nwhich to conduct medical and mental health assessments. \nEnsure that youth have adequate opportunities to contact and \ndiscuss health concerns with health care staff in a setting \nthat affords privacy. \n8. \t Develop and implement policies, procedures, and practices to \nensure that youth receive care from the appropriate level \nand specialty of practitioner in a timely manner. \n9. \t Ensure that all youth receive a full dental examination at \nthe time of the initial health assessment, and provide \nadequate treatment and monitoring of youth with dental \nneeds. \n10. \t Cease the use of the dental clinic at Oakley until such time \nas the risks of infection from the contaminated instruments, \n\n-43 \nand equipment, and dirt, pests, and other vermin are \nremoved. \nD.  E\t ducation \n1. \t Ensure that all students receive appropriate education \ninstruction within a few school days of their arrival at the \nfacility.21 \n2.\t Ensure that all students receive 330 minutes of classroom \ntime per day and that all students receive the benefit of \nclass instruction in math, English, social studies, and \nscience. \n3. \t Provide adequate qualified substitute teachers. \n4. \t Provide youth in disciplinary confinement with the full \nrange of educational services. \n5. \t Provide all youth reasonable access to reading and writing \nmaterials in their cells. \n6. \t Provide adequate screening of youth for special education \nneeds.

Provide special education services to \nall youth identified by the screening process. \n7.\t Implement procedures to identify all youth with mental \nretardation or mental illness and ensure that they are \ntransitioned out of Oakley and Columbia as quickly as \npossible.  Implement procedures to prevent the placement of \nyouth with mental illness or mental retardation at the \nfacilities. \n21  One way Oakley and Columbia could provide this remedy\nis to set up a special “intake” education class.  This classroom \ncould focus on basic education skills such as literacy, current\nevents, and math skills.  The curriculum would be applicable to\nchildren with a broad range of education backgrounds.  It would \nalso provide the facility with an opportunity to evaluate the\nchildren’s education abilities before all relevant education \nrecords had been obtained.  After an appropriate period of time\nin this intake classroom, children could be integrated into the\ngeneral school population. \n\n-44 \n8. \t Ensure parent or guardian involvement in evaluations, \neligibility determinations, placement and provision of \nspecial education services. \n9. \t Ensure that all eligible youth have current, valid IEPs. \nCreate a system of routinely developing, implementing, \nmonitoring and reviewing youth’s IEPs. \n10. \t Provide juveniles with adequate related services at Oakley \nand Columbia and ensure that special education students have \naccess to transition services specified in the IDEA, such as \nthe vocational training program at Oakley. \nE.  R\t eligious Freedom \n1.\t Revise the policies regarding the exercise of religion to \nclarify the proper role that religious activities can play \nat the facilities.  The policies shall provide that youth be \nallowed to engage in voluntary religious activities unless \nthe facilities can show that curtailing such activities \nwould be the least restrictive means of achieving a \ncompelling governmental interest.  At the same time, the \npolicies must not coerce youth to engage in specific \nreligious activities.  Provide adequate training to all \nstaff on the policies and protocols described above. \nMonitor facility programs and the decorations on the units \nto ensure that the policies described above are being \nfollowed. \nF.  E\t nvironmental Health \n1. \t Correct deficiencies in maintenance and sanitation at \nOakley.  Appoint a facility safety officer to ensure \naccountability in the areas of safety and sanitation. \n2. \t Repair all safety hazards in administrative buildings and \nhousing units at Oakley.  Remedy all suicide hazards in \nareas where youth with suicidal ideations may be potentially \nhoused. \n3. \t Ensure that Oakley provides proper water temperatures in the \nkitchen and housing areas. \n4. \t Obtain Material Safety Data Sheets for all applicable \nchemicals used in the facilities. \n\n-45 \n5. \t Develop written policies and procedures specifically \naddressing the handling, storage and use of flammable, \ncaustic and toxic chemicals in compliance with applicable \nstate and federal regulations. \n6. \t Correct structural problems in Oakley’s gymnasium. \n7. \t Repair and replace all malfunctioning toilets, lavatories \nand showers at Oakley. \n8. \t Ensure that adequate sleeping accommodations are provided \nsuch that no youth is required to sleep on the floor at \nOakley. \n9. \t Implement proper sanitation and maintenance control of \ncockroaches, spiders and mice throughout Oakley, including \nhousing and medical areas. \n10. \t Ensure that bi-annual fire safety inspections are conducted \nat Oakley by state and local fire officials. \n11. \t Address all issues identified by the Fire Marshal at Oakley \nimmediately. \n12. \t Ensure that Oakley staff are adequately trained quarterly in \nfire and emergency procedures. \n13. \t Ensure adequate ventilation throughout the boys’ and girls’ \nSIUs at Columbia so that youth receive an adequate supply of \nfresh air and reasonable levels of heating and cooling. \nMaintenance staff should review and assess compliance with \nthis requirement at appropriate intervals. \nG. \t Other Juvenile Justice Issues \n1. \t Ensure that youth are afforded a due process hearing before \nimposing confinement for disciplinary purposes in the SIUs \nat both facilities, Unit One at Oakley, and Ironwood. \n2. \t Develop and implement an adequate grievance system at Oakley \nand Columbia. \n3.\t Employ sufficient trained staff to ensure safety and to \nsatisfy the individual treatment, training and \n\n-46 \nrehabilitative needs of juveniles confined in these \nfacilities. \n4.\t Train existing staff so that they perform their positions \nadequately and ensure that all staff demonstrate an \nunderstanding of and/or demonstrate the application of \napplicable skills.  For all staff working with juveniles, \nthe areas of training and demonstrated competence should \ninclude:  passive restraint; stages of adolescent \ndevelopment; communication skills; therapeutic intervention \nskills; basic rights of residents and staff; report writing; \nbasic medical terminology; recognizing and responding to \nseizure disorders; common side effects of prescription and \nnon-prescription medication; universal precautions to \nprevent infection of TB or HIV/AIDS; confidentiality of \nmedical information; the provision of health education for \nresidents; basic information concerning learning \ndisabilities; certification in first aid and CPR; and \nadaptive activities for physically and developmentally \nchallenged juveniles. \n5.\t Provide juveniles with adequate access to mail, telephones, \nand visitation. \n6.\t Ensure youth confined to Ironwood are permitted access to \nadequate outdoor exercise. \n* * * * * \nDuring the exit interview at our on-site tours, we provided \nState officials with preliminary observations made by our expert \nconsultants.  State officials and facility staff reacted \npositively and constructively to the observations and \nrecommendations for improvements.  The collaborative approach the \nparties have taken thus far has been productive.  We hope to be \nable to continue working with the State in an amicable and \ncooperative fashion to resolve deficiencies previously noted.  In \naddition, due to the State’s cooperation in this matter, and \nState officials’ expressed desire to improve conditions in these \nfacilities, we will send, under separate cover, reports from our \nexperts which provide their more detailed findings and \nrecommendations to address the inadequacies they found in the \noperation of the facilities.  Although the expert consultants’ \nevaluations and work do not necessarily reflect the official \n\n-47 \n\nconclusions of the Department of Justice, their observations, \nanalysis, and recommendations provide further elaboration of the \nissues discussed in this letter and offer practical assistance in \naddressing them. \nIn the unexpected event that the parties are unable to reach \na resolution regarding the concerns outlined above, the Attorney \nGeneral may initiate a lawsuit pursuant to CRIPA, to correct \ndeficiencies or to otherwise protect the rights of Oakley and \nColumbia residents, 49 days after the receipt of this letter. \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1997b (a)(1).  We have every confidence, however, \nthat this matter will be resolved cooperatively.  Accordingly, \nCivil Rights Division attorneys will soon contact State officials \nto discuss in more detail the State’s implementation of these \nremedial measures. \nSincerely, \nRalph F.
