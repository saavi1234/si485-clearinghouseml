The motions for a stay pending decision of the Certiorari petition in Shain and/or of the disqualification motion are denied. The motion for an extension of time to respond to the class certification motion is also denied since (1) it is untimely, defendants having submitted it so late that it only reached chambers on the date the response was due and (2) the motion is entirely unspecific about what addition at discovery is allegedly necessitated by the amendment of the complaint and this provides no rational basis for the Court to assess the need for an extension .

The Court has carefully considered the application of plaintiffs' counsel to award $200,000 of the remaining funds to the plaintiffs' counsel as a means of restoring $200,000 to the originally requested attorneys' fees that were withheld in order to assure sufficient payments to claimants. However, the Court has previously declined to award an additional $200,000 in attorneys' fees to the plaintiffs' counsel. Moreover, the Court continues to believe that the attorneys' fees award without the additional $200,000 is a reasonable attorneys' fee award. While there are certainly cases where a greater percentage of recovery has been awarded, the percentage of recovery in this case was reasonable, and it resulted in a modest, although reasonable, premium over the lodestar. By April 27, 2016, the parties should submit a stipulated proposed order authorizing the payment of the cy pres award to the Fortune Society and tho Women's Prison Association. SO ORDERED.

Moreover, the proposed notice is insufficient to assure that any prospective class members are giving informed consent to having a one-third contingency fee deducted from their recovery, when they could simply return the form to the administrator without any contingency fee being deducted.

    "summary": "<p>On July 15, 2002, inmates of New York City jails filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 against the City of New York and jail officials in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the Court in a series of amended complaints for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, alleging that the defendants had violated their constitutional rights by subjecting them to strip searches in the absence of reasonable suspicion that the plaintiffs were concealing weapons or contraband.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants asked the Court to disqualify one of the plaintiff's attorneys, alleging that he should be removed because he had represented the city in a different case. On June 3, 2003, District Judge Gerard E. Lynch denied the motion. McBean v. City of New York, No. 02-5426, 2003 WL 21277115 (S.D. N.Y. June 3, 2003).</p>\r\n<p>On July 25, 2003, this case, McBean v. City of New York, was consolidated as the lead case with a similar case, Cence v. City of New York, No. 03-4114.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after the consolidation, the parties entered into settlement negotiations, and attended settlement conferences overseen by Magistrate Judge Theodore H. Katz. Just before agreement was reached, a group of putative plaintiffs, represented by different private counsel than the original plaintiffs, asked the Court to allow them to intervene and create a sub-class of misdemeanor arrestees charged with narcotics or weapons-related offenses. On April 27, 2005, Judge Lynch denied the motion to intervene, finding that the current named plaintiffs were adequate class representatives and that the class definition did not need to be narrowed. McBean v. City of New York, 228 F.R.D. 487 (S.D. N.Y. 2005).</p>\r\n<p>On May 13, 2005, the parties reached a settlement agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, plaintiff class members were eligible to receive $750 if they were subjected to one wrongful strip search and $1000 if they were subjected to two or more wrongful strip searches. The defendants agreed to offer \"gynecological services\" to female pre-trial detainees until 2008, and they agreed that the female detainees had the right to refuse such services if they were unwanted. The defendants also agreed to pay $500,000.00 in attorneys' fees and costs for class counsel in this litigation, as well as the ongoing administration costs of the settlement.</p>\r\n<p>After notification to potential plaintiff class members, the parties asked the Court for final approval of the settlement agreement. The previously- mentioned would-be plaintiff intervenors objected to the proposed settlement as unfair. On February 7, 2006, Judge Lynch approved the settlement agreement, finding that it was fair and had been properly negotiated. It called for a total payout to the class of approximately $2.8 million and payment of $500,000 in plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. McBean v. City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377 (S.D. N.Y. 2006).</p>\r\n<p>In 2007, the same private attorneys who had unsuccessfully sought to intervene in the case earlier and now represented a different group of plaintiff-intervenors, assertedly as a putative class (those subjected to improper strip searches after settlement had been reached with the original plaintiffs) asked the District Court to allow these new plaintiffs to intervene in the lawsuit. The defendants asked the Court to dismiss their motion as untimely. The proposed intervenors responded that they did not learn that there was an ongoing lawsuit concerning strip searches until November 2006. On February 13, 2007, the District Court (Magistrate Judge Katz) concluded that the motion to intervene was timely and allowed its proponents to join this case as plaintiff-intervenors. McBean v. City of New York, No. 02-5426, 2007 WL 473711 (S.D. N.Y. Feb. 13, 2007).</p>\r\n<p>On August 29, 2007, the plaintiff-intervenors stipulated and agreed to dismiss their claims against the defendants pursuant to a settlement between the parties, except for claims relating to strip searches occurring when post-admission detainees leave the city's correctional facilities or when officials search a detainee's housing within one of the facilities. Under the terms of this settlement, the defendants agreed not to strip search any detainee without reasonable suspicion, to promulgate written policies regarding when strip searches were appropriate, to retrain their intake personnel within four months of October 4, 2007, to agree to appointment of a Special Master whose role would be to ensure adherence to the new policies, to post signs advising prisoners of the new policies and how to report violations, and to discipline employees who disregarded the new search policies. The defendants also agreed to pay attorneys' fees and costs.</p>\r\n<p>On March 16, 2010, the parties entered a Stipulated Settlement providing for payment of $33 million dollars in damages by the City to the approximately 100,000 pretrial detainees involved in the case. The court (John G. Koeltl) preliminarily approved the settlement on March 22, 2010.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs moved for final approval of the stipulation of settlement on September 24, 2010, which the court approved on October 22, 2010. The settlement provided extra payments for eighteen persons who were were allegedly strip searched, in addition to the damages settlement for two certified classes:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Those who were admitted to DOC custody after arraignment between July 23, 2002 and October 4, 2007 but were not also simultaneously admitted on&nbsp;(i) any felony charges; (ii) a parole violation; (iii) an outstanding warrant for a felony offense; (iv) a violation of felony probation; (v) a City sentence of less than one year; or (vi) who were not already serving a State sentence at the time of their admission;</li>\r\n<li>And those&nbsp;who were admitted to DOC custody after arraignment between July 15, 1999, and July 22, 2002 on a Drug or Weapon Non-Felony Charge as defined in paragraph 23 of the Damages Settlement, but did not receive a monetary settlement as part of the 2005 Settlement, as defined in paragraph 22 of the Damages Settlement, and were not also simultaneously admitted on (i) any felony charges; (ii) a parole violation; (iii) an outstanding warrant for a felony offense; (iv) a violation of felony&nbsp;probation; (v) a City sentence of less than one year; or (vi) who were not already serving a State sentence at the time of their admission.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Final judgment was issued on November 9, 2010. The case is now closed.</p>",

(Cardinale Decl., Ex. 2, ¶ 17 (affidavit of \nPlaintiffs,  DOC  Chief  William  Fraser  submitted  with  amicus \nv.  briefing in Shain v. Ellison).) The strip searches consisted \nThe City of New York et al., Defendants.  of “a search of the inmate [’s] apparel after the inmate has \nremoved  his/her  clothing  [,]  accompanied  by  a  visual \nNos. 02 Civ. 5426(GEL), 03 Civ. 4114(GEL). | April  inspection of the inmate’s mouth, hair, armpits, knees and \n27, 2005.   toes.

In Shain, a divided panel of the Second \n  Circuit  declined  to  apply  the  lesser  standard  of \n“reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,” \ndeveloped in the context of prison regulations by the \nOPINION AND ORDER  Supreme Court in Turner v.

The \nDistrict Court preliminarily approved the certification of these classes on October 5, 2007.  The \nDistrict Court finally approved certification of the injunctive class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P \n  9\n\n \n23(b)(2) class after a fairness hearing on the Injunction Settlement on February 5, 2010.  \nCertification of the Fed. R. Civ. P 23(b)(3) classes that comprise the 2002 to 2007 Subclass was \nnot at issue at the fairness hearing on the Injunction Settlement, and that certification has not \nbeen finally approved.   \n31.  The Parties reaffirm their agreement, subject to the District Court’s final approval, \nto certify the 2002 to 2007 Subclass pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) and will seek such \ncertification at the fairness hearing on this Stipulation. \nFUNDING AND RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES \n32.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Stipulation, the City agrees to pay \nThirty-Three Million Dollars ($33,000,000.00) which shall be used to pay all claims of SCMs, \nservice awards to Named Plaintiffs, payments to GYN Plaintiffs, administrative costs, and past, \npresent, and future attorneys’ fees and costs.  The $33 Million shall be reduced pursuant to \nparagraphs 33 and 34, if less than 10% of the persons on the Final Class List submit valid Claim \nForms.  The total amount less any reductions pursuant to paragraphs 33 and 34 is the Class Fund.  \nThe Class Fund does not include the $802,308.51 in attorneys’ fees and costs previously paid to \nClass Counsel pursuant to the Injunction Settlement.  The Class Fund also does not include the \nadditional individual payments that will be made to “Post-2007 Persons,” as set forth in paragraph \n41. \n33.  If less than 10% of the persons on the Final Class List submit valid Claim Forms, \nthe $33 Million shall be reduced as follows:  After subtracting the Settlement Costs awarded \nfrom the $33 Million, the Remainder (“Remainder”) shall be divided by one-tenth of the number \nof SCMs on the Final Class List, which amount shall constitute the “Paragraph 33 Award \nAmount.”  The Paragraph 33 Award Amount should then be multiplied by the number of SCMs \n  10\n\n \non the Final Class List who constitute the difference between (i) 10% of the Final Class List and \n(ii) the amount equal to the number of SCMs who submitted Claim Forms.  The resulting amount \nwill be refunded to the City. \n34.  For example, if 100,000 individuals are on the Final Class List and $4,000,000 is \npaid to cover the Settlement Costs, and only 9,000 SCMs submit Claim Forms, then the amount is \ncalculated as follows: The Remainder is $29,000,000.  $29,0000/10,000 = $2,900. $2,900 \n(10,000 – 9,000) = $2,900,000.  In this example, the Class Fund would be reduced by $2,900,000 \nand the maximum award an SCM shall receive would be $2,900.  This $2,900,000 would be \nrefunded to the City. \n35.  Within two weeks after Preliminary District Court Approval, the City shall deposit \nor cause to be deposited into a bank account designated by the Administrator by wire transfer an \namount of same–day-available funds equal to the amount approved by the District Court for \npayment to the Class Administrator to cover the costs of notice agreed to by the Parties and/or \nordered by the Court, and will provide additional funds to the Administrator as approved by the \nCourt, except that the total of said funds shall not exceed $600,000.  Any such payment shall be \ndebited against the Settlement Costs.  If the Stipulation is not ultimately approved by the Court, \nthen all such funds paid to the Administrator, to the extent they are available after payment of all \naccrued class administration expenses, shall be returned to the City.  The Administrator will \nsubmit monthly bills to the Parties and may pay itself from these funds in accordance with its bill \nif the Parties do not object to the bill within 30 days of receipt of the monthly bill. \n36.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Stipulation and the approval of the \nCourt, within thirty (30) calendar days of the Effective Date for Payment, the City shall deposit or \ncause to be deposited into the Class Settlement Fund Account (“CSFA”) the Class Fund (a) less \n  11\n\n \nthe Settlement Costs, and (b) less deductions due to child support liens as provided for in \nparagraphs 43(c) and 57.  Within thirty (30) calendar days of the Effective Date for Payment, the \nCity shall deposit by wire transfer to the trust account of Class Counsel the Settlement Costs less \nthe amount already advanced under the terms of the immediately proceeding paragraph. \n37.  In the event that this Stipulation receives Final District Court Approval, but the \nfunds are not immediately paid due to an appeal by a third party (see definition of “Effective \nDate for Payment”), the City will place the Class Fund in an interest bearing escrow account, and \nthe interest accrued shall be added to the Class Fund for the benefit of the Class in the event that \nthe Stipulation is finally approved and entered as a judgment.  Should the settlement not be finally \napproved after exhaustion of all appellate avenues, all such funds, including interest earned on \nthem, shall be returned to the City (except for class administration costs already expended by the \nAdministrator).  Should the settlement not be finally approved, or if for any other reason there is \na delay in immediate payment by the City, the City shall have no claim for the funds advanced to \nthe Administrator for notices against the Named Plaintiffs, the GYN Plaintiffs, the Post-2007 \nPersons, the Settlement Class, Class Counsel, or the Administrator for reimbursement of the \nadvanced funds, except that any advance funds shall be credited towards any subsequent \nsettlement in this action.   \n38.  The City will join Class Counsel in seeking the Court’s approval of the \nStipulation, including approval of the Settlement Costs. \n39.  No payment shall be made to eligible SCMs before the Effective Date for \nPayment.  Claims will be processed between the date of Preliminarily District Court Approval \nand the Effective Date for Payment.  Upon the Effective Date for Payment, processed claims \nmay be paid. \n  12\n\n \n40.  No additional payments shall be paid to Class Counsel for fees and costs before \nthe Effective Date for Payment.  After the City deposits or wires Class Counsel the Settlement \nCosts, as set forth in paragraph 36, Class Counsel may immediately withdraw money from the \nSettlement Costs to pay its own fees and costs before a final accounting, as long as sufficient \nmoney is reserved to pay the Administrator’s costs, GYN Plaintiffs’ payments, and service \nawards to Named Plaintiffs.  If the Administrator’s final bill is less than the amount previously \nadvanced, the Administrator shall refund to Class Counsel the remainder.  A copy of the \nAdministrator’s final accounting, as well as monthly bills, shall be provided to the City.    \n41.  Within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date for Payment, the City will pay Post-\n2007 Persons the same Award Amount, as defined in paragraph 42, that SCMs who submit \nClaim Forms are paid.  Such amounts shall be paid from funds other than the Class Fund.  If \nPost-2007 Persons are members of the Settlement Class and submit a valid Claim Form by the \nBar Date, they may also recover the Award Amount from the Class Fund.  That is, Post-2007 \nPersons may receive the Award Amount twice if they are also eligible SCMs who submit timely \nvalid Claim Forms.  \nPAYMENTS TO THE SETTLEMENT CLASS \n42.  The amount awarded to SCMs who submit Claim Forms shall be calculated as \nfollows: \na.  First, the amount paid to the Administrator for costs; to Class Counsel for \nattorneys’ fees and costs; to Named Plaintiffs for service awards; and to GYN \nPlaintiffs (collectively “Settlement Costs”) shall be subtracted from the Class \nFund.  This amount shall be $4 million unless otherwise reduced or altered by the \nCourt. \n  13\n\n \nb.  Second, the amount of money previously paid pursuant to the 2005 Settlement to \nSCMs who submit Claim Forms pursuant to this Stipulation shall be added to the \nremaining amount of the Class Fund for calculation purposes.  This added amount \ndoes not increase the Class Fund but is included for calculation purposes only. \nc.  This amount shall then be divided by the number of SCMs who submit valid \nClaim Forms. \nd.  The resulting amount of (c) shall be the “Award Amount.” \n43.  SCMs who timely file a completed and signed Claim Form and who are eligible \nfor an award shall each be entitled to receive this Award Amount from the Class Fund in \ncompensation for their claims, subject to the following provisions: \na.  In addition to the Award Amount, the Named Plaintiffs in this action shall receive \nadditional service awards as set forth in paragraph 63 below; and the GYN \nPlaintiffs shall receive payments as set forth below in paragraph 64 below.  The \nadditional amounts referred to in this sub-paragraph shall be paid from the \nSettlement Costs. \nb.  If a SCM was paid as part of the 2005 Settlement, the previous settlement amount \nshall be deducted from the Award Amount, so that all SCMs shall be given an \nequal amount for any new admission strip search claim between July 15, 1999 and \nOctober 4, 2007. \nc.  If an SCM who submitted a Claim Form has a New York child support lien, the \namount of that lien shall be deducted from the amount the Administrator pays him \n  14\n\n \nor her, pursuant to the provisions in paragraph 57.  The amount paid by the \nAdministrator to these SCM’s will be their share of the Remainder minus any \nchild support lien already deducted by the City.   \n44.  If the calculation of the Award Amount set forth in paragraph 42 above results in \nan Award Amount of less than $1,800 and if more than 2000 individuals not on the Final Class \nList are valid claimants within the Settlement Class, then the City agrees to add an additional \namount to the Class Fund above the agreed-upon $33 Million so that the valid claims by those \nnot on the Final Class List do not reduce the amount paid to those on the Final Class List below \n$1,800.  This additional amount will be added to the Remainder and used solely towards \npayments of the Award Amounts. \n45.  Class Counsel has the discretion to void checks mailed to SCMs and not cashed \nwithin 120 days of issuance.  Notice of this procedure will be provided at the time the checks are \nissued.  Class Counsel, on written notice to the City and the Court, shall have the discretion to (a) \nreissue the checks, or (b) add the amount of the voided checks back to the Class Fund to be \ndivided equally amongst eligible SCMs, or (c) issue checks to persons who make late claims for \ngood cause shown, or (d) seek an award by the Court consistent with cy pres principles.  If \npermission is granted to make late claims for good cause shown, any amount due and owing \nattributable to New York child support liens shall be deducted and forwarded to the City prior to \nany payment to an SCM who submitted a late claim. \n46.  The Administrator is permitted for good cause shown (including proper \ndocumentation and proof of authority) to issue checks in the name of a person other than the \nSCM.  \n  15\n\n \nADMINISTRATOR \n47.  The Administrator’s duties shall include administering the Class Fund, including \nbut not limited to the following matters: (1) issuing notice, including information about the right \nto object or opt out of the settlement; (2) locating class members; (3) distributing Claim Packets to \nand receiving executed original Claim Forms of same from those on the Final Class List; (4) \nestablishing and administering the Class Fund and upon conclusion of the process, closing the \nFund; (5) paying all income taxes, if any, owed by the Class Fund; (6) determining eligibility for \nawards on the basis of information provided by counsel for the Parties and the SCMs, validating \nthe claims, and providing the Parties a list of those persons found preliminarily eligible every 30 \ndays; (7) calculating the amounts of awards; (8) issuing and mailing checks to eligible SCMs, and \nissuing and filing all required tax forms and statements; (9) developing procedures and \nresponding to inquires from SCMs and Opt-Outs about this Stipulation and the procedures \ncontained herein, including by the use of a toll-free number; (10) creating a database of SCMs \nwho have filed timely and valid Claim Forms; (11) establishing a toll-free number, which will be \nincluded in the Claim Packet and on the Summary Notices; (12) creating a database of Opt-Outs; \nand (13) providing the Parties with monthly bills and a final accounting. \n48.  The City agrees to facilitate the work of the Administrator by, among other \nthings, obtaining and providing to the Administrator, information, data, documents, and records \nin the City’s possession, which is relevant and appropriate to facilitate the administration of the \nClass Fund, to the extent such information is disclosable to the Administrator under federal, state \nand/or local laws.  Within forty-five (45) days of Preliminary District Court Approval of the \nStipulation, the City will provide the Administrator with an Excel spread sheet containing the \nfull names of all the SCMs, along with their aliases, Social Security Number, date of birth, \n  16\n\n \nNYSID number, address at the time of the last admission that made them part of the Settlement \nClass (“last relevant admission”), last relevant admission date, last relevant admission charge, and \nlast known address.  To determine the SCM’s last known address, the City shall check certain \ndatabases to which it has access, including DOC records of more recent admissions, the New \nYork City Department of Probation records, Human Resource Administration records, and \nDepartment of Homeless Services records.  Where necessary and/or appropriate, the Parties shall \ncooperatively seek appropriate court orders to obtain the addresses of SCMs.  The City’s \nobligation regarding the information listed in this paragraph only extends to the extent SCMs \nprovided accurate and complete information.  \n49.  To the extent that the Administrator and/or Class Counsel receive inquires that \nthey cannot resolve, the Administrator and/or Class Counsel shall group such inquires and \nsubmit them in writing to a designated person at the Office of Corporation Counsel on a \nrecurring basis, but not more often than a weekly basis.  Results of the investigations will be \nprovided in writing. \n50.  Information provided to Class Counsel and the Administrator pursuant to the prior \ntwo paragraphs shall be confidential, and may not be disclosed to anyone except Class Counsel, \nDefendants’ Counsel, certain City agencies (including DOC, Department of Homeless Services, \nHuman Resources Administration, and the Comptroller’s Office), the Administrator, or the Court \nunder seal.  Class Counsel and the Administrator shall not disclose the confidential information \nto any person not a member of their staff.  To the extent Class Counsel or the Administrator seek \nto disclose this information to any other person or entity, they must first seek Defendants’ \nCounsel’s consent in writing.  Defendants’ Counsel shall not unreasonably withhold consent.  In \naddition, after consent is given, but before disclosing the confidential information to anyone else, \n  17\n\n \nincluding, any agent, contractor, or expert, the Administrator or Class Counsel shall first have \nsuch person or organization sign the confidentiality agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A.  A \nsigned copy of Exhibit A shall be provided to Defendants’ Counsel by expedited transmission \nimmediately but no later than two business days after execution.  Class Counsel and the \nAdministrator shall take all reasonable steps to insure that the confidential information \nconcerning all proposed class members and SCMs, remain private and confidential.  In addition, \nthe information provided to Class Counsel and the Administrator regarding the proposed class \nmembers and SCMs will not be used for any other purpose other than in this litigation and for the \nadministration of this Stipulation.  Similarly, the City will not use any information concerning \nSCMs or proposed class members that is provided by the Administrator or Class Counsel for any \nother purpose other than in this litigation and for the administration of this Stipulation, and the \nCity shall keep such information confidential.   \n51.  The Administrator will apply for a tax ID number, if necessary, and take all \nnecessary steps for the timely creation of the CSFA prior to the forty-fifth day from the Final \nDistrict Court Approval. \n52.  The Administrator shall provide the City the Employer Identification Number for \nthe CSFA, and a completed W-9 Form and bank routing information for the trust fund account, \nwithin 45 days of the Final District Court Approval.   \n53.  The Administrator will treat income taxes as the first priority for payment, and \ntherefore, shall, on a quarterly basis, set aside an amount sufficient to pay all income taxes, if \nany, owed by the CSFA on interest earned to date. The Administrator shall pay all income taxes, \nif any, on a quarterly basis.  The City Comptroller shall have the right to inspect and copy all tax \nforms (and worksheets), and monthly bank statements of the CSFA.  The Administrator will \n  18\n\n \nprovide to Class Counsel, Defendants’ Counsel, and the City Comptroller with a monthly \nstatement of expenses paid.  The City will not be responsible for taxes, penalties, or interest \nincurred on the Class Fund.  The Administrator shall issue all required IRS forms. \n54.  Within thirty (30) days of receiving the Final Class List, the Administrator shall \nmail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to all persons on the Final Class List for whom an \naddress is available a copy of the Claim Packet. \n55.  Subject to approval from the District Court, the Administrator and Class Counsel \nshall be responsible for determining a plan to ensure that as many SCMs as reasonably possible \nreceive the Claim Packet and see the Summary Notices.  A copy of the plan should be sent to \nDefendants’ Counsel. \n56.  The SCM must submit a completed Claim Form to the Administrator by the Bar \nDate unless such date is extended by order of the Court.  The Administrator shall reject claims \nthat are untimely.  A Claim Form is deemed submitted upon deposit in a postpaid properly \naddressed wrapper, in a post office or official depository under the exclusive care and custody of \nthe U.S. Post Office, or when submitted for delivery by a commercial express carrier, or when \nactually received by the Administrator, whichever date is earlier. \n57.  Every thirty (30) days, after the Preliminary District Court Approval, the \nAdministrator shall provide the Parties a list of those persons who are preliminarily eligible so \nthat the City may on a rolling basis determine whether that person’s Award Amount will need to \nbe reduced due to New York child support liens.  The City will not exercise its right to reduce \nthe payments set forth in this Stipulation by exercising its right to recover any other amounts, \nincluding but not limited to amounts due for unpaid City taxes including personal income tax, \nreal estate related taxes, unpaid parking tickets, unpaid Environmental Control Board fines, or \n  19\n\n \nany medicaid costs correctly paid against bills from the New York City Health and Hospitals \nCorporation. No benefits currently received by SCMs may be terminated or reduced as a result of \nAward Amounts unless required by federal or state law or regulation. This does not constitute a \nwaiver of any right to separately recoup overpayments or any amounts owed solely to federal or \nstate governments if such is required by federal or state law or regulation. Within thirty (30) days \nof receiving the last list of those persons eligible to receive an Award Amount, the City shall \nprovide the Administrator and Class Counsel with a list of those persons who have New York \nchild support liens and the amount that shall be deducted from each persons’ Award Amount to \nbe forwarded to the beneficiary of the child support lien.  Prior to providing this list, the City \nshall send each person owing child support liens a notice describing that they owe these liens and \ninformation on how to file a challenge regarding the deduction of the child support liens from the \nAward Amount.  If the City later determines that the amount of the liens was incorrect, the City \nshall directly pay that person the over-deduction of the amount that was withheld from that \nperson’s Award Amount.   \n58.  Any SCM who fails to submit a Claim Form by the Bar Date or any court-\nmandated extension, shall be forever barred from receiving payments pursuant to the Stipulation.  \nSuch person shall be bound by all of the terms of the Stipulation, and the Judgment entered \nherein, including but not limited to the release of all Released Persons of all Settled Class \nClaims, as defined in paragraph 26.   \n59.  The Administrator shall mail letters and/or otherwise contact SCMs who by the \nBar Date submit partially completed Claim Forms that are deficient to provide them up to thirty \n(30) additional days to validate their Claim Forms.  The absence of a social security number or \nother identifying information shall not be a basis for not issuing an award to a SCM if the \n  20\n\n \nAdministrator can otherwise confirm the identity of the SCM.   \n60.  Rights and claims hereunder shall survive the death of SCMs.  If a SCM who is \neligible to receive monetary relief under this Stipulation is deceased, the amount payable to such \ndeceased SCM shall be paid to the appropriate representative of his/her estate.  The \nrepresentative of the estate shall provide proof of death and appropriate documentation to show \nthat she/he is properly a representative of the estate.  If the Administrator determines, after \nreasonable opportunity has been given, that there is insufficient information or proof regarding \nthe deceased person’s estate to permit such payment, the deceased person’s share shall be \ndistributed in accordance with the terms set forth in paragraph 45 for the distribution of returned \nchecks. \nEXCLUSION FROM THE SETTLEMENT CLASS \n61.  Any potential SCM who wishes to be excluded from the Settlement Class must by \nthe Bar Date mail a request to be excluded from the Settlement Class (“Request for Exclusion”) \nto the Administrator.  Any Request for Exclusion must be in writing and state the name, date of \nbirth, address, and telephone number (if any) of the person requesting exclusion and contain a \nclear statement communicating that such person elects to be excluded from the Settlement Class.  \nOriginals of all Requests for Exclusion shall be retained by the Administrator and until such \noriginals are filed with the Court.  Named Plaintiffs will not request exclusion pursuant to this \nparagraph.  A list of all exclusions, as well as a copy of the written Requests for Exclusions sent \nto the Administrator, shall be provided to Class Counsel and Defendants’ Counsel. \n62.  Any SCM who does not timely file a Request for Exclusion shall conclusively be \ndeemed to have become a SCM and to be bound by this Stipulation and by all subsequent \nproceedings, orders, and judgments herein. \n  21\n\n \nSERVICE AWARDS FOR NAMED PLAINTIFFS \n63.  In addition to the Award Amount, each of the eight Named Plaintiffs will be paid \nan additional $8,000 each as an award for services provided to the class and for any \ninconvenience, pain, suffering, and other non-pecuniary loss experienced as a result of having \nbeen a named plaintiff in this action.  Class Counsel shall pay these service awards from the \nSettlement Costs.  The amount of the service awards was negotiated before it was agreed that the \nawards would be paid from the Settlement Costs. \nPAYMENTS TO GYN PLAINTIFFS \n64.  The GYN Plaintiffs shall receive $20,000 each for their alleged injury, physical \npain, and suffering arising out of purported forced gynecological exams.  Class Counsel shall pay \nthe GYN Plaintiffs this amount from the Settlement Costs.  The amount of these awards was \nnegotiated before it was agreed that the awards would be paid from the Settlement Costs.  If they \nare eligible SCMs and submit valid and timely Claim Forms, the GYN Plaintiffs will also receive \nan Award Amount from the Administrator out of the Remainder. \n65.  While Plaintiffs initially asserted class claims arising out of forced gynecological \nexams, a class was never certified.  All putative class claims arising out of forced gynecological \nexams are hereby dismissed.  All claims by the GYN Plaintiffs arising out of forced \ngynecological exams from July 15, 1999 until and including October 4, 2007, are hereby \ndismissed with prejudice. \nADDITIONAL NOTICE \n66.  To augment the Administrator’s efforts to ensure that as many persons as \nreasonably possible receive notice, the Parties will work cooperatively together to ensure that the \nSummary Notices are posted in places where SCMs are likely to see them.  The Administrator \n  22\n\n \nwill provide the Parties with the requested number of copies of the Summary Notices, and will \nemail the Parties a pdf version of the Summary Notices.  \n67.  The City agrees to ensure that the Summary Notices are posted in the following \nlocations within two weeks of the initial mailing of the Claim Packets and approval of the \nSummary Notices, whichever date is later: \na.

Summary Notices also may be placed by Class Counsel in locations comparable \nto those set forth in this section in an effort to give notice to as many SCMs as is reasonably \npracticable. \n72.  Nothing in this section shall limit further appropriate efforts to provide notice. \n  24\n\n \nEXCESS FUNDS \n73.  Any amount remaining in the Remainder shall be distributed to the Settlement \nClass.  If funds are not sufficient for distribution, then Class Counsel will petition the Court for \nan order consistent with cy pres principles. \nEFFECT OF STIPULATION \n74.  Within five (5) business days of when the Class Fund (minus sums advanced for \ncosts of notice) is paid to the Administrator and Class Counsel by the City, all claims in the \nabove-referenced action will be dismissed, with prejudice, and without costs, expenses, or fees in \nexcess of the amount authorized by paragraphs 15, 35 and 36 above. \n75.  The Stipulation, as of the Effective Date for Payment, resolves in full all claims, \nwith prejudice, against the Released Persons by SCMs, including the Named Plaintiffs arising \nout of any strip searches of non-felony pre-trial detainees at DOC jails during the initial new \nadmission process from July 15, 1999 until and including October 4, 2007.

LYNCH, District Judge: \nThe Court has received a series of letters from thc parties concerning defendants' recent \nproduction of voluminous documents, and related issues.  In a letter dated August 17,2007, \nplaintiffs seek (I) an order directing defendants to answer certain interrogatories and requests for \nadmissions relating to the number of disposable hospital gowns ordered by the City for purposes \nof maintaining the privacy of persons being searched; (2) an order precluding defendants from \nmaking use of newly produced documents in their summary judgment motions or at the \npreliminary injunction hearing scheduled to begin on September 24,2007; (3) an order directing \nthe immediate production of all documents listed in defendants' privilege log dated July 19, \n2007, or withheld or redacted after July 19,2007.  (Letter from Elizabeth S. Saylor, Esq., to the \nCourt, dated Aug. 17,2007, at 1 (the \"8/17 Saylor Letter\").) \nBecause the privilege issues implicate prior rulings by Judge Katz made in the course of \nhis management of discovery in this case, and because the reference to Judge Katz remains open, \nthe parties will be directed to take their dispute concerning privilege to Judge Katz.  The \napplications for preclusion of new evidence and for discovery relating to that evidence, however, \nconcern the issues addressed in this Court's Order of July 6, 2007, and accordingly will be dealt \nwith in this Order. \n- 1.  Plaintiffs' Request to Preclude Newly Produced Evidence \nu..  On July 6, 2007, the Court issued an Order (\"the July 6 Order\") addressing an earlier \nrequest by plaintiffs to preclude evidence regarding disposable hospital gowns that was not \no \ndisclosed prior to the end of the discovery period.  Acknowledging that defendants were \nC!  extremely late in producing the required information, the Court expressed strong distaste for the \n- ).1\":>  idea of preclusion as a discovery sanction, noting that \"[w   ]hether or not plaintiffs are entitled to \n(.) \nI  injunctive relief will be determined, so far as this Court can manage it, based on accurate \nfact-finding.\" \n'.f) \n\nThe July 6 Order went on to state: \nThere is a point where preclusion may be appropriate  for \nexample, where late production jeopardizes an adversary's ability \nto fairly prepare a response to new evidence, and thus undermines \nthe reliability of that new evidence.  An injunction precluding strip \nsearches will not be imposed, however, as a sanction for belated \ndiscovery. \nThe July 6 Order went on to direct defendants in no uncertain terms to \"produce any \nsupplemental production on this issue on or before August 1,2007,\" noting that H[i]t should not \nbe beyond the collective wit of the Corporation Counsel and the Department of Corrections to \nmanage to determine how many hospital gowns they purchase in a year, given twelve months to \ndo it.\"  Apparently it was.  Defendants have continued to produce documents relating to their \npurchases of hospital gowns well past the August 1 deadline, and indeed have continued \nproducing such documents even while opposing plaintiffs' current request for relief. \nPlaintiffs, noting the July 6 Order's warning that \"[i]fplaintiffs' preclusion request is \npremature now, the time is fast approaching when a similar request will meet with greater favor,\" \nseek preclusion of the recently produced documents.  While the Court is willing to consider any \napplication for relief that may directly address the prejUdice suffered by plaintiffs, plaintiffs have \nnot made the kind of showing that would require excluding the newly produced documents. \nAs the July 6 order made very clear, newly produced documents will not be excluded as a \ndiscovery sanction.  Newly produced documents will, however, be excluded if they are \nunreliable due to plaintiffs' inability to fairly investigate and prepare their case with respect to \nthose documents due to their belated disclosure.  As the September 24 preliminary injunction \nhearing draws closer, defendants' failure to comply with discovery orders presents an \nincreasingly serious threat to the Court's ability to discern the true facts at issue in this case. \nPlaintiffs' submissions note, rightly, that they have been prejudiced by defendants' late \nproduction, which carne after plaintiffs' summary judgment motion had been filed, but plaintiffs \ndo not contend that the true facts regarding the new documents cannot be established because of \nthe late production.  Instead, plaintiffs argue that defendants' belated and incomplete production \nstrongly suggests that defendants have not been ordering hospital gowns in the numbers they \nclaim.  Perhaps so; plaintiffs may make this argument when the Court takes up the merits of the \ncase.  Meanwhile, absent an argument that defendants' discovery violations undermine the \nreliability of the evidence, plaintiffs' request for preclusion of the new documents is denied. \n2.  Discovery Sought In Response To Defendants' Late Production \nAlthough at this time the newly produced documents will not be precluded, the late \ndisclosures present serious challenges to the factfinding process.  These challenges can be \naddressed only if the defendants fully respond to the plaintiffs' reasonable demands for \nsupplementary discovery in connection with the belated production. \n2 \n\nPlaintiffs seek an order directing defendants to answer certain interrogatories and \nrequests for admissions relating to the number of disposable hospital gowns ordered by the City \nfor purposes of maintaining the privacy of persons being searched.  (See 8117 Saylor Letter, Ex. \n1.)  In response, defendants argue that plaintiffs \"have made no showing that the [documents \nproduced] are in any way inadequate for the purpose of arriving at the truth\" of whether the \ngowns were used in the manner defendants claim.  (Letter from Karl J. Ashanti, Esq., and \nGenevieve Nelson, Esq., to the Court, dated Aug. 24,2007 (the \"8/24 Ashanti Letter\"), at 2.) \nPlaintiffs, understandably, seek to compel defendants to answer simple factual questions that will \nbe at the heart of the upcoming hearing: whether the gown information produced represents all \nthe gowns ordered by defendants, how many gowns DOC ordered, and the number of detainees \naccused of misdemeanors admitted to DOC custody who should have been searched with a \ndisposable gown.  (See 8117 Saylor Letter, Ex. 1.) \nDefendants argue that plaintiffs \"have been able to analyze the documents produced\" \nthemselves.  (8/24 Ashanti Letter, at 3.)  This argument is unconvincing enough on its face, but \nthree days later, defendants  the same defendants who objected that it was unnecessary for \nthem to answer plaintiffs' questions, including a question about whether the gown-related \ninfomlation already produced represented all the gown information there was - produced \napproximately 900 more pages of documents to plaintiffs.  (Second Letter from Elizabeth S. \nSaylor, Esq., to the Court, dated Aug. 27, 2007 (the \"Second 8/27 Saylor Letter\"), at 1; Letter \nfrom Genevieve Nelson, Esq., to the Court, dated Aug. 28, 2007 (\"8/28 Nelson Letter\").) \nApparently failing to see the irony in arguing first that plaintiffs can figure out for themselves \nwhether all gown-related information has been produced and then producing more gown-related \ninformation, defendants have not withdrawn their objection to the interrogatories. \nDefendants have little of relevance to say in regards to their refusal to answer the \ninterrogatories.  They complain that the plaintiffs' document requests were overly broad, but of \ncourse the time for objections to the scope of discovery requests is long past.  At this point \ndefendants' only choices are compliance or contempt, and it is becoming increasingly clear that \ndefendants have chosen the latter. \nDefendants also state that \"[u  Jpon information and belief, most of these documents were \nonly recently located by DOC.\"  (8/28 Nelson Letter, at 1.)  DOC was ordered to locate them \nmuch, much sooner.  In the same letter, defendants contend that the documents were produced \n\"two business days after receiving the documents\" (id.), apparently meaning that defense counsel \nproduced them shortly after DOC located them.  The fact that defendants appear to regard \nDOC's lateness in locating the documents as some sort of an excuse for the late production \nsuggests that defense counsel understand their role in this process as little more than passing \ndocuments along to plaintiffs whenever the client feels like producing them.  It should not be \nnecessary to explain why this is wrong.  Discovery requirements are imposed on the parties \nthemselves, not simply on defense counsel.  In eilect, defendants' counsel do not deny that \ndefendants have failed to comply with this Court's order directing them to locate and produce all \nrelevant documents by August 1; they simply argue it was their client's failure, not theirs.  This \ndoes not help the City's case. \n3 \n\nFinally, and somewhat astonishingly, defendants contend that \"it is disingenuous\" for \nplaintiffs to eomplain that this latest late production was a surprise, because plaintiffs \"were well \naware that the Defendants intended to produce additional documents to them on a rolling basis.\" \n(8/28 Nelson Letter, at 2.)  Perhaps it is true that long ago, when discovery was still open, there \nwas an understanding that production would be \"on a rolling basis.\"  But plaintiffs and the Court \nhave long since had an understanding that discovery was closed, and defendants have done \nnothing to disabuse the rest of us of this understanding.  Even if defendants had stated explicitly \nthat discovery would continue \"rolling\" in at such a late date, it would amount to little more than \nan announcement that they intended to violate this Court's July 6 order.  In short, defendants by \ntheir actions have demonstrated that plaintiffs' need for answers to their interrogatories is highly \nlegitimate.  Defendants will be given until Thursday, September 6, 2007, to answer the \ninterrogatories in full. \nPlaintiffs seek additional discovery on another issue.  In a letter dated August 27,2007, \nplaintiffs advise the Court that defendant on August 13, 2007, issued a revised policy document \npertaining to searches conducted by the DOC.  (First Letter from Elizabeth S. Saylor, Esq., to the \nCourt, dated Aug. 27, 2007 (the \"First 8/27 Saylor Letter\"), at 1 n.l.) This policy appears to \nhave been issued after the August I, 2007, deadline, and so of course defendants have not \nviolated this Court's July 6 order in producing it.  Plaintiffs indicate, not surprisingly, that if \ndefendants rely on this new policy in their motion papers, plaintiffs will seek a Rule 30(b)( 6) \ndeposition on matters relating to the policy, in particular why the policy was revised and how it \nis being implemented.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6). \nDefendants contend, bizarrely, that plaintiffs' demand for new discovery regarding the \nnew policy is \"yet another attempt to divert defendants' attention from the preparation of the \nmotions that are due this Wednesday.\"  (Letter from Genevieve Nelson, Esq., to the Court, dated \nAug. 27, 2007, at 1.) In other words, defendants, having produced significant new evidence on \nthe eve of trial, see it as an attempt to sabotage their work when plaintiffs attempt to discover \nwhat that new evidence means. \nDefendant also argue, irrelevantly, that their conduct in failing to disclose this new policy \nearlier was not \"willful or in bad faith.\" (Id.)  That matters not at all.  Once again: the point is to \nfind the truth about defendants' policies.  The Court cannot find the truth if defendants continue \nto obstruct its factfinding process by making irrelevant objections to reasonable discovery \nrequests.  If defendants have claims of privilege to make relating to the new policy, they may \npresent them to Judge Katz.  Except for those matters as to which Judge Katz sustains a claim of \nprivilege, a Rule 30(b)(6) witness must be made available and prepared to testify regarding the \nnew policy. \nDefendants seem not to understand what is at stake here.  If they did, they would be \nrushing to offer plaintiffs answers to interrogatories, a 30(b)(6) witness, and any other form of \ndiscovery that may ensure that the reliability of the new documents is thoroughly tested by a fair \nadversarial process.  Ifby the time of the hearing the Court cannot be sure that the plaintiffs have \nhad ample opportunity to prepare their case with respect to the new documents, then it will have \n4 \n\nno choice but to exclude those documents as unreliable evidence.  In other words, when \ndefendants produce documents beyond the close of discovery, the alternative to offering \nplaintiffs full supplementary discovery is for defendants not to be able to use the new evidence at \nall. \nAs was clearly stated in the Court's July 6, 2007 order, preclusion will not be imposed as \na sanction for belated discovery.  If the Court cannot be assured of new evidence's reliability, \nhowever, it cannot be admitted.  Defendants will provide to plaintiffs all of the discovery they \nseek, and any other discovery that may reasonably aid in assessing the reliability and \nsignificance of the newly disclosed evidence. \nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that: \n1.  Plaintiffs' request for preclusion of newly produced evidence is denied. \n2.  Defendants are directed to respond by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, September 6,2007, \nto all interrogatories and requests for admissions contained in Exhibit 1 to the \nAugust 17,2007, letter from Elizabeth S. Saylor, Esq., to the Court. \n3.  Defendants are directed to make available a witness pursuant to Rule 3 O(b )( 6) to \ndiscuss the new policy, as discussed above. \n4.  Plaintiffs' applications with respect to defendants' claims of privilege should be \ndirected to Judge Katz. \n5.  As chambers staff informed the parties by phone on August 28, 2007, the \ndefendants' request for an extension of time to serve plaintiffs with defendants' \nmotion for summary judgment and opposition to plaintiffs' motion (see 8/27 \nNelson Letter, at 2-3) is granted.  Defendants' time to serve those papers on \nplaintiffs is extended to 6:00 p.m. on Friday, August 31,2007. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: New York, New York \nLli~ \nAugust 31, 2007 \nY?'I(ffi--\nGERARD E.

Class counsel concedes that City \n:pefendant may still establish that a particular individual class member was subjected to a \npermissible strip  search, by bearing the burden of proof and through production of a \nVisual Body Cavity Search Report (Form 443) or other reliable documentary evidence \n2 \n\nfor the individual in question that demonstrates that the strip  search was based on a \ndetermination that reasonable suspicion required the search. \n•  Pursuant to the pattern and practice of strip searching members of the New Admission \nNon Felony Detainees Without Drugs or Weapons Class and the New Admission Non \nFelony  Detainees  Drug  and  Weapons  Class  upon  admission,  DOC  officers  and \nsupervisory personnel  strip  searched members  of the  aforementioned classes without \nmaking any determination or knowing whether they had been arraigned on a charge \nunder the New York Penal Code that was related to possession or use of a drug and/or \nweapon. \n•  The parties agree that the injunction herein conforms to the requirements of the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626 (\"PLRA\"), and that the relief herein is narrowly \ndrawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal rights of \nthe class,  and is the least intrusive means necessary to  correct the violation of their \nfederal rights. \n3 \n\n1.  Class Certification \nThe Parties hereby agree, subject to the Court's approval, to certify certain classes pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) or (b)(3) and to have ECBA appointed as Class Counsel for each.  The \nClasses shall be: \nAll pretrial detainees arraigned solely on non-felony charges: \n(a) who  have  been  or  will  be  admitted  to  DOC  custody,  but  were/are  not  also \nsimultaneously admitted on:  (i) any felony charges; (ii) a parole violation; (iii) an \noutstanding warrant for a felony offense; (iv) a violation of felony probation or (v) a \nCity sentence of less than one year and who are not already serving at State sentence \nat the time of their admission (the \"Admission Injunctive Class\" pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(b)(2)); \n(b) who were admitted to DOC custody between July 23,2002 and October 4,2007 but \nwere  not  also  simultaneously  admitted  on: (i)  any  felony  charges;  (ii)  a  parole \nviolation;  (iii)  an outstanding warrant for a felony offense;  (iv) Drug or Weapon \nCharges;  (v) a violation of felony probation;  (vi) a City sentence of less than one \nyear;  or (vii)  who were not already serving a State sentence at the time of their \nadmission (the ''New Admission Non Felony Detainees Without Drugs or Weapons \nClass\" pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)); \n(c) who were arraigned on Drug or Weapon Charges and who were admitted to DOC \ncustody between July 23,2002 and October 4,2007 but were not also simultaneously \nadmitted on: (i) any felony charges; (ii) a parole violation; (iii) an outstanding warrant \nfor a felony offense; (iv) a violation of felony probation; (v) a City sentence of less \nthan one year; or (vi) who were not already serving a State sentence at the time of \ntheir  admission (the  \"New Admission Non Felony Detainees Drug and Weapon \nClass\" pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b )(3)). \nII.  Remedies for the Admission Injunctive Class \n1.  City Defendant will not subj ect any member of the Admission Injunctive \nClass to a strip search upon admission into DOC custody without reasonable suspicion. \nA.  Revisions to Written Policies \n2.  City Defendant shall incorporate revisions to DOC written policies such \nthat there is a uniform and plain language message across all relevant policies concerning the \n4 \n\nprohibition  of strip  searching  New  Admission  Non  Felony  Detainees  without  reasonable \nsuspicion.  In particular,  Directive  4508R-C,  Operations  Order  16/89,  and  Command  Level \nOrders concerning 4508R-C and Operations Order 08/02 and any other relevant written policies \n(\"Relevant Written Policies\") concerning the manner and means of processing New Admission \nNon Felony Detainees and/or the manner and means of searching inmates generally will be \nrevised to reflect in plain language the fact that Operations Order 08/02 governs the search of \nNew Admission Non Felony Detainees and will be revised to ensure that conflicting directions or . \ninstructions shall be eliminated. \n3.  Within two weeks of October 4, 2007, ECBA will provide City Defendant with \nthe Relevant Written Policies marked up to reflect suggested changes to ensure that paragraph 2 \nis implemented. \n4.  City Defendant will work in good faith with ECBA to incorporate such suggested \nchanges as appropriate.  Draft revised policies will be provided to ECBA within twenty-:one (21) \ndays of the receipt of suggested changes from ECBA.  ECBA will return policies with comments \nwithin fourteen days. \n5.  City Defendant will promulgate  revised policies  (\"Revised Written Policies\") \nwithin  three  weeks  of receiving  ECBA's  final  comments,  and  will  ensure  full  and  proper \ndissemination of such policies through all appropriate channels. \n6.  Within two weeks of the Revised Written Policies being fully disseminated, City \nDefendant shall provide an affidavit of compliance to  the  Court and to  ECBA setting forth \nspecifically how and when the Revised Written Policies were promulgated and distributed, and \nattaching copies of all the final Revised Written Policies.  Copies of the final Revised Written \nPolicies may be redacted to the extent the policies do not concern search procedures. \n5 \n\nB.  Training \n7.  Immediate  training  of intake  personnel  at  new  admission  facilities: \nWithin four months of October 4, 2007, trainings concerning how to conduct searches of New \nAdmission Non Felony Detainees shall be completed for all personnel whose regular post is the \nintake area of any DOC new admission facility, and no officer will work an intake search post in \na  new  admission  facility  who  has  not  completed  new  admission  search  training  (\"Intake \nPersonnel Training\"). \n8.

The Module shall also be included in every round of in-service personnel \ntraining (whether it is  of Corrections  Officers,  Captains,  or Assistant Deputy Wardens) that \noccurs after the Module is finalized (\"In Service Training\"). \n10.  An applicable job knowledge package incorporating all elements of the \nModule must also appear in every training packet/disk that is provided to personnel who are \napplying for a promotion. \n11.  Until two  years  from the Effective Date, the Module dedicated to  this \ntraining shall be included in every round of training at the DOC Academy for new hires (''New \nHire Training\"). \n12.  The  Intake  PersOlmel  Training,  Promotion  Training,  and  New  Hire \nTraining (and any other training conducted pursuant to paragraphs 7-11 of this subsection) shall \nbe comprised of, at a minimum, the following components.  In-Service Training shall include \n6 \n\nthe same components set forth below, except that the information set forth in sub-paragraph (ii) \nmay be conveyed via classroom instruction rather than a walk-through. \n(i)  a training session of at least one hour devoted exclusively to how to  conduct \nsearches of New Admission Non Felony Detainees, including instructions (a) that \nspecifically  forbid  New  Admission  Non  Felony  Detainees  from  being  strip \nsearched unless  reasonable  suspicion is  found,  and  (b)  that  gowns  are to  be \nprovided for a New Admission Non Felony Detainee's privacy; \n(ii)  a walk-through demonstration inside an intake area, directing personnel \nspecifically during the walk-through: \n(a) how to identify and separate inmates into pens according to whether or not \nthey are New Admission Non Felony Detainees, \n(b) when and how New Admission Non Felony Detainees are given a gown, \n(c) where they ~e permitted to change into the gown, \n(d) how their clothes are placed on a line scan machine, \n(e) what procedures are followed while the New Admission Non Felony \nDetainees are wearing the disposable gown, \n(f) where and how they are permitted to put their clothes back on, \n(g) where disposable gowns are kept within the search room or search area, \n(h) how to re-order or replenish supplies of gowns ifthey are in short supply or \nnot present, \n(i) who within a command is responsible for ensuring supply of gowns, \n7 \n\n(j)  how to conduct a search that ensures privacy for New Admission Non Felony \nDetainees, and which does not involve a strip search as defined herein, in the \nunlikely event no gowns are available during intake, \n(k) what constitutes reasonable suspicion as a basis for strip searching a New \nAdmission Non Felony Detainee, including specific examples, \n(1) what fonns and procedures must strictly be followed when reasonable \nsuspicion is detennined, and \n(m) what logbooks must be filled out and how; \n(iii)  a handout that summarizes in plain language a checklist of all the things that must \nbe done to search a New Admission Non Felony Detainee; and \n(iv)  a simple one-page test that each DOC staff member being trained must fill out and \npass concerning the relevant search procedures for New Admission Non Felony \nDetainees, and which each staff member must sign legibly and on which slhe \nmust print hislher name and shield number. \n(v)  In the  event  a  New Admission Non Felony Detainee refuses  the  offer of a \ndisposable gown during intake, such refusal shall be documented and DOC shall \nnot be considered to be out of compliance with the provisions of this Stipulation \nand Order. \n13.  DOC shall adopt a policy regarding discipline concerning failure to follow the \nprocedures set forth in Operations Order 08/02, and the Module and other relevant training shall \nalso include a clear statement of this policy.  The disciplinary procedures shall follow established \ncommand  discipline  procedures,  duly  negotiated  with  the  applicable  labor  unions.  Such \nviolation will be deemed a schedule \"D\" violation. \n8 \n\n14.  Within four months of the Effective Date, City Defendant shall provide the Court \nand ECBA with an affidavit of compliance with respect to  all steps taken to  implement the \nparagraphs in this subsection and attaching all training, testing, and disciplinary materials created \nand being used therefor.  Attachments provided to  the Court and/or ECBA may be redacted \ninsofar as they do not relate to the provisions concerning search training, testing, or discipline. \nCity Defendant shall also retain copies of the one-page test completed by DOC staff until two \nyears after the Effective Date. \nIII.  Special Master for the Admission Injunctive Class \n15.  Within 30  days  of October 4,  2007,  the parties  shall mutually agree  upon  a \nSpecial Master who shall be appointed to ensure that DOC is not routinely strip searching New \nAdmission Non Felony Detainees and that the City Defendant is not violating this Stipulation \nand Order (the \"Special Master\").  Non-compliance under this injunction shall not be based on \nisolated or sporadic events.  Additionally, non-compliance shall not be based on an inmate's \ndocumented refusal of a gown.  In the event that the parties cannot agree upon a Special Master \nwithin 30 days of October 4,2007, the parties shall each present five suggested Special Masters \nto Judge Lynch, who shall select the Special Master or choose his own.  The Special Master \nshall serve for two years after the Effective Date, and may hire a reasonable number of staff or \nassistants to help himlher, and hislher fees and the fees of his/her staff shall be paid for by City \nDefendant on a monthly basis. \n16.  The Special Master shall provide written reports to the Court and both parties \nconcerning City Defendant's compliance as the Court directs. \n17.  City Defendant shall provide the Special Master access to any and all materials for \npurposes of making determinations about compliance with this injunction. \n9 \n\n18.  City Defendant shall also freely grant the Special Master access to people and \nplaces within DOC for purposes of the Special Master's ensuring DOC's compliance with this \ninjunction,  and  shall  cooperate  with  the  Special  Master  to  ensure  the  freedom  of hislher \nmovement and conversations with DOC staff, within constraints required for security reasons -\nincluding escorts in the jails, and provisions for the privacy of inmates, as needed.  For example, \nthe Special Master shall be permitted to inspect intake areas, to speak with search room or intake \narea officers, supervisors and inmates leaving a search room area or a DOC facility, to inspect \nwhere and how gowns are kept both in intake areas and with respect to DOC's supplies area, and \nto view logbooks and post-order folders located in intake areas.  These are examples only and are \nnot meant to limit in any way areas which the Special Master may choose to inspect or people \nwith whom the Special Master may wish to speak.  To the extent City Defendant has security \nconcerns, the Special Master may be required to sign a confidentiality statemept that shall not \nimpede hislher ability to report effectively on City Defendant's compliance. \n19.  DOC shall within thirty days of October 4, 2007, place permanent signs which are \n(i) at least two feet by two feet in length and width, (ii) clearly legible and in plain English and \nSpanish,  (iii) placed in a secure manner (through bolts or screws) to  a prominent and easily \nviewed location in the search room (e.g., on the front or side of an x-ray machine which is easily \nviewable to an inmate entering the room or area) and inside the holding pens in the intake areas \nand  (iv)  which  state  \"FOR  YOUR  SAFETY  AND  THE  SAFETY  OF  OTHERS,  ALL \nINMATES  ARE  SUBJECT  TO  SEARCH  UPON  ADMISSION.  NON-FELONY  NEW \nADMISSION DETAINEES WILL BE PROVIDED A PAPER GOWN FOR PRIVACY, AND \nWILL NOT BE SEARCHED FULLY UNDRESSED  UNLESS  THERE IS  REASONABLE \nSUSPICION TO BELIEVE THAT YOU POSSESS DRUGS, WEAPONS AND/OR OTHER \n10 \n\nCONTRABAND. IF YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN SEARCHED IN VIOLATION OF \nTHIS RULE, PLEASE CALL 1-800  ___. \"  An equivalent alternative form of notice may be \nagreed upon by the parties or approved by the Court. \n20.  A toll free  number shall be created and paid for by City Defendant,  and the \nSpecial Master shall administer it, including by leaving a voicemail message requesting that \ncallers clearly state and spell their names, their book and case number or NYSID number, the \nfacility at which they were strip searched and what date, and a means of contacting them again \n(e.g., a mother or brother's phone number).  The Special Master alone shall also be able to access \nand listen to the recordings on this toll free number and consider such infortnation in writing \nhislher reports and recommendation.  The Special Master or hislher staff shall also keep a log \nbook noting the details of such messages. \n21.  Both sides may speak with the Special Master freely and without the other party \npresent, and may present the Special Master with evidence concerning DOC's compliance or \nnon-compliance with respect to  this Stipulation and Order and with respect to  any potential \nroutine strip searching of New Admission Non Felony Detainees. \nIV.

Within sixty (60)  days  of October 4,  2007,  City Defendant shall pay ECBA \ninterim reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of 50% of Class Counsel's lodestar, based on Class \nCounsel's current rates, for work conducted by ECBA in the Action to date, without prejudice to \nECBA to seek the remaining 50% and reasonable attorneys fees and costs that the Court may \naward pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 at some later date for the entire Action.  For purposes of this \ninterim payment only, Class Counsel shall provide a summary bill and good faith representations \nand respond to  any further  reasonable requests  for  information and documentation by City \n11 \n\nDefendant.  With respect to the consideration of fees for the entire Action, Class Counsel will \nsubmit a detailed bill and City Defendant reserves the right to  any and all legal arguments \nconcerning fees,  including  good  faith  challenges to  reasonableness  of certain  entries.  The \ninterim amount paid shall be credited to the City Defendant at the time of any future award. \nAfter Court approval of the Stipulation and Order, Plaintiffs shall also be entitled to an additional \naward of fees, costs, and disbursements to be fixed by the Court or agreed to by and between the \nparties hereto to monitor and enforce compliance with the Stipulation and Order. \nV.  Procedural Matters \n23.  With respect to each class set forth in Section I,  the parties shall work \nexpeditiously together to create a plain language notice form in English and Spanish, and shall \nwork in good faith together to seek final approval from the Court through a fairness hearing. \n24.  Nothing contained herein shall in any way limit the ability of the City \nDefendant and DOC to strip search New Admission Non Felony Detainees or any other detainee \nor inmate in custody upon reasonable suspicion that the detainee or inmate possesses drugs, \nweapons or contraband. \n25.  None of the obligations other than class certification shall be enforceable \nafter two years from the Effective Date. \n26.
