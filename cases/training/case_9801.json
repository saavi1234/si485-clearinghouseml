The plaintiffs, who had been strip searched pursuant to this policy, alleged that that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  To remedy the constitutional violations, Plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and class certification.  </p><p>The Gloucester County Sheriff answered Plaintiffs' complaint by generally denying the allegations.</p><p>At the time of this summary, the case was still pending.</p><p></p>",

For at least \nthe past two years prior to the date of the commencement of this litigation, the Gloucester \nCounty Sheriff’s Department has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter \nthe Gloucester County Jail and are placed in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon \nwhich they are charged. Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from \nthe written procedures of the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department, and was \npromulgated by senior Department officials; specifically, Defendants Gilbert Miller, III, \nJoseph C. O’Leary, Michael Silvert, Fred Catalano, Robert M. Balicki, Darrul Johnson \nand Carol Pistorio. \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or minor violations cannot be strip-searched absent \nparticularized suspicion that they possess weapons or contraband. In short, the policy of \nGloucester County and the Gloucester County Sheriffs Department to force those charged \nwith minor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the \nGloucester County Jail (“GCJ”)is clearly illegal.  \nSandra King Wilson and Joseph DePietro (together, “Plaintiffs”) bring this action \non behalf of themselves, and on behalf of a class of thousands of others who were strip \nsearched after being charged with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary \nviolation of their civil rights and those of the class members they propose to represent. \nBoth of these individuals were charged with misdemeanor and/or violation offenses, and \n \n2 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 039 o  f   2 P2 aPgaeg 3e IoDf:  212159\n \nboth were subject to strip searches, in violation of their rights against unreasonable \nsearches under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. They seek \nmonetary damages for themselves and each member of the proposed class, a declaration \nthat the Sheriffs Department’s policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding \nGloucester County, Gloucester County Corrections and the Gloucester County Sheriffs \nDepartment from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody. With \nthis as  background, Plaintiffs Sandra King Wilson and Joseph DePietro complain as \nfollows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1981 & 1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government.  Supplemental jurisdiction exists  \nover Plaintiffs’ pendent state law claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1367(a) inasmuch as \nPlaintiffs’ state law claim is so related to the federal claims within such original \njurisdiction that it forms part of the same case or controversy as do the federal claims. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving \nrise to Plaintiffs’ claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial \ndistrict. \n \n3 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 049 o  f   2 P2 aPgaeg 4e IoDf:  212160\n \nPARTIES \n3.

Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  pursuant  to  Rules  23(b)(1),  23(b)(2)  and \n23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of \nsimilarly situated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and \nwere strip searched upon their entry into the Gloucester County Jail. \n17.   The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nGloucester  County  Jail  after  being  charged  with  nonindictable \noffenses (such as disorderly persons offenses, violations, violations \nof probation or parole, traffic infractions and/or civil commitments) \nor other minor offenses and were or will be strip searched upon their \n \n7 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 089 o  f   2 P2 aPgaeg 8e IoDf:  212164\n \nentry into the Gloucester County Jail pursuant to the policy, custom \nand practice of the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department and the \nCounty of Gloucester.  The class period commences on March 22, \n2004  and  extends  to  the  date  on  which  the  Gloucester  County \nSheriff’s Department and/or the County of Gloucester are enjoined \nfrom, or otherwise cease, enforcing their unconstitutional policy, \npractice and custom of conducting strip searches absent reasonable \nsuspicion.  Specifically excluded from the class are Defendants and \nany and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, \nsuccessors, employees or assignees.   \n \n18.   This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class \naction  under  Federal  law  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and \nadequacy requirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n19.   The  members  of  the  class  are  so  numerous  as  to  render  joinder \nimpracticable.  There are hundreds and probably thousands of people who have been \narrested  for  misdemeanor  violations,  traffic  infractions,  failing  to  make  payment  on \noutstanding traffic violations, failing to make payment on outstanding fines or other \nminor nonindictable crimes who were strip searched under the circumstances described \nherein. \n20.   Joinder of all of these individuals is impracticable because of the large \nnumber of class members and the fact that class members are likely dispersed over a \nlarge geographical area, with some members presently residing outside of Gloucester \nCounty  and  this  Judicial  District.    Furthermore,  upon  information  and  belief,  many \nmembers of the class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would \nhave great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n21.   Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in \nthat they all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants’ \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \n \n8 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 099 o  f   2 P2 aPgaeg 9e IoDf:  212165\n \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the GCJ, and \nall were illegally strip searched in violation of the established law in this judicial circuit. \n22.   Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class.  \nPlaintiffs and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants’ \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n23.   The representative Plaintiffs have the requisite personal interest in the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  \nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n24.   Plaintiffs  have  retained  counsel  who  have  substantial  experience  and \nsuccess in the prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiffs \nare being represented by William Riback; Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of Cuneo \nGilbert & LaDuca, LLP; Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich of the Locks Law Firm, PLLC; \nElmer Robert Keach, III; and Gary E. Mason of The Mason Law Firm, PLLC. \n25.  William Riback is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney \nwho has successfully litigated class actions in both state and federal courts in a number of \njurisdictions across the country. \n26.   Jonathan W. Cuneo and Charles J. LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, \nLLP, have extensive experience in state and federal trial and appellate courts, before law \nenforcement authorities and in proceedings before the United States Congress.  Cuneo \nand  LaDuca  have  successfully  prosecuted  complex  class  actions,  including  cases \ninvolving securities fraud, antitrust violations, consumer protection and products liability \nin state and federal courts throughout the United States. In addition to this experience, \nCuneo and LaDuca are co-counsel in several strip-search class actions, with Mr. Keach, \n \n9 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0190   o  f  P22a gPea 1g0e IoDf:  212166\n \none of which was recently certified in the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of New York against the County of Schenectady and other related Defendants. \n27.  Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich of the Klafter Olsen & Lesser with offices in \nRye  Brook,  New  York,  Haddonfield,  New  Jersey  and  Washington,  D.C.,  are  both \nexperienced civil rights and class action attorneys.  Mr. Lesser is one of this country’s \npremier  class  action  attorneys  having  successfully  litigated  civil  rights,  consumer \nprotection and products liability class actions against Fortune 500 companies in courts \nacross the country, including both New Jersey state and federal courts. Ms. Rudich has \nlitigated scores of individual and class action civil rights cases against a number of \nDefendants in over ten jurisdictions throughout the United States. \n28.  Mr. Keach is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who has \nlitigated a wide variety of civil rights actions, and has litigated class action lawsuits in \nstate and federal courts in five states.  Mr. Keach has successfully litigated strip search \ncases against the Troy City Police Department and the Schenectady School District, and \nwas lead counsel in the Rensselaer County Jail strip search class action that recently \nsettled. \n29.  Gary E. Mason is one of this country’s premier class action attorneys, with \noffices in Washington, DC.  Mr. Mason has successfully litigated class actions against \nFortune 500 companies in both state and federal court in over a dozen jurisdictions, \nincluding gaining a settlement for a class of purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of \n$ 950 million dollars.  Mr. Mason has served as lead or co-counsel in numerous high \nprofile class actions, including In Re The Exxon Valdez, In Re Diet Drugs Product \nLiability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation.  \n \n10 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0191   o  f  P22a gPea 1g1e IoDf:  212167\n \n30.   In short, Plaintiffs’ counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully  prosecute  this  action  against  Gloucester  County,  the  Gloucester  County \nSheriff’s Department and the Policy Making Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiffs knows of \nno conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class. \n31.   This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As such, the \nPlaintiffs seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the GCJ.  In short, the \nCounty of Gloucester, the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department, the Policy Making \nDefendants  and  Gloucester  County  Corrections  Officers  acted  on  grounds  generally \napplicable to all class members. \n32.   In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3).   \n33.   Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, \nand predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  \nThese common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants’ written and/or de facto policy of strip \nsearching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to \nthe Gloucester County Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed \nduring the class period. \n34.   A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members \nof the class is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that \n \n11 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0192   o  f  P22a gPea 1g2e IoDf:  212168\n \nthey are dispersed over a large geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and burden \nof individual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of \nthe class to redress the wrongs done to them.  The cost to the federal court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n35.   There are no other actions pending to address the Defendants’ flagrant \nviolation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though the Defendants have \nmaintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the past 2 years. \n36.   In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs \nalso seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n37.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers  they  supervise,  from  performing  strip  searches  of  arrestees  who  have  been \ncharged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes unless the officer has reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n38.   In turn, under New Jersey law, specifically N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(c), any person \nwho is deprived of substantive due process or equal protection rights, privileges or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States or by the \nConstitution or laws of the State of New Jersey has a claim under State law. \n \n12 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0193   o  f  P22a gPea 1g3e IoDf:  212169\n \n39.  The County of Gloucester, the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department \nand the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, \ncustom  or  practice  of  strip  searching  all  individuals  who  enter  the  custody  of  the \nGloucester County Jail and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the nature of their \ncharged  crime  and  without  the  presence  of  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the \nindividual was concealing a weapon or contraband. \n40.  The County of Gloucester, the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department \nand the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, \ncustom or practice of conducting visual body cavity searches (visual inspection of the \nvaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of the Gloucester \nCounty Jail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of their charged \ncrime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are collectively \nreferred to as “strip searches.” \n41.  The County of Gloucester, the Gloucester County Correctional Facility \nand the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department, and the Policy Making Defendants \nknow that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a policy or practice of \nconducting strip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion.  Upon information \nand belief, the Gloucester Police’s written policy was based on the policy promulgated by \nthe Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department. \n42.  The  Defendants’  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n \n13 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0194   o  f  P22a gPea 1g4e IoDf:  212170\n \n43.  Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n44.  Upon information and belief, the County of Gloucester, the Gloucester \nCounty  Sheriff’s  Department  and  Policy  Making  Defendants  have  promulgated, \nimplemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice \nor custom of strip searching all individuals placed into the custody of the Gloucester \nCounty Jail and placed into jail clothing without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, \nor indeed suspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto policy made the strip \nsearching of pre-trial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the \ncharacteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to \nthe enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches.   \n45.  Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding every named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the GCJ.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of \nreasonable suspicion, and in fact were not supported by reasonable suspicion.  Strip \nsearches are conducted for individuals arrested for, among other innocuous offenses, \nDriving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n46.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches – \neach member of the class, including every named Plaintiff – has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \n \n \n14 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0195   o  f  P22a gPea 1g5e IoDf:  212171\n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \nA.  SANDRA KING WILSON  \n47.  Sandra  King  Wilson  was  arrested  on  September  2005  suspicion  of \nshoplifting and violation of probation which arose from a guilty plea to shoplifting in \n2003. \n48.  Upon arrival of the Gloucester County Correctional Facility Ms. Wilson \nwas required to undress in the shower area in the presence of an observing Correctional \nOfficer.  Ms. Wilson was required to bend down and cough while manually required to \nspread her buttocks.  Ms. Wilson was then required to lift her breasts one at a time. \n49.  Defendants  strip  searched  her  according  to  policy  without  reasonable \nsuspicion of drug or weapon possession. \n50.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, Wilson has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nB.  JOSEPH DEPIETRO \n51.  Mr. DePietro is a disabled person receiving Social Security Disability \nbenefits. \n52.   Mr.  Depietro  turned  himself  in  to  the  Gloucester  Sheriff’s  Office  on \noutstanding child support warrants. \n53.  According  to  the  Gloucester  County  Policy,  Mr.  Depietro  was  strip \nsearched in the presence and requirement of Gloucester County Correctional Officers. \n54.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff’s Department policy, practice and custom, DePietro has \n \n15 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0196   o  f  P22a gPea 1g6e IoDf:  212172\n \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law -- \n \n55.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 54. \n56.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches by law enforcement officers, and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the individual in question has either contraband or \nweapons. \n57.  The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ rights under \nthe  United  States  Constitution.    Simply  put,  it  was  not  objectively  reasonable  for \nGloucester County Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiffs and Class members \nbased on their arrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively \nreasonable  for  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  to  order/direct  Gloucester  County \nCorrections Officers to conduct such searches.   \n58.  These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or \npractice of the County of Gloucester, the Gloucester County Correctional Facility and the \nGloucester County Sheriff’s Department.  As such, the County of Gloucester is directly \nliable for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and members of the Class. \n \n16 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0197   o  f  P22a gPea 1g7e IoDf:  212173\n \n59.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Sheriff  Miller,  Undersheriff  O’Leary, \nUndersheriff Silvert, Officer Catalano, Director Balicki, Warden Johnson and Captain \nPistorio are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the \noperation of the Gloucester County Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of the \nstrip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  .    \n60.  Sheriff  Miller,  Undersheriff  O’Leary,  Undersheriff  Silvert,  Officer \nCatalano, Director Balicki, Warden Johnson and Captain Pistorio knew that the GCJ’s \nstrip search policy was illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to \ndeprive Plaintiffs and members of the Class of their Constitutional rights. \n61.  This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n62.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described \nabove, Plaintiffs have been irreparably injured. \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Statutory Rights Under the New Jersey Civil Rights Act \n \n—Deprivation of Substantive Due Process Rights, Immunities, or Privileges \nunder the New Jersey Constitution— \n63.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in the preceding paragraphs, as though fully set forth therein.  \n64.  N.J.S.A. 10:6-2(c) provides a right of action for any citizen who is \ndeprived of any substantive due process or equal protection rights, privileges or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States or by the \nConstitution or laws of the State of New Jersey, or whose exercise or enjoyment of those \n \n17 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0198   o  f  P22a gPea 1g8e IoDf:  212174\n \nsubstantive rights, privileges or immunities has been interfered with or attempted to be \ninterfered with, by threats, intimidation or coercion by a person acting under color of law.  \n65.  The actions of the Defendants as detailed above violated Plaintiffs’ and \nthe class’s rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as \nalready set forth, as well as under the analogous provisions of New Jersey Constitution, \nparticularly Article I paragraph 7 of same. It was neither objectively reasonable nor \nconstitutional for the Jail’s personnel to strip-search Plaintiffs and all the members of the \nclass based on their arrests for non-indictable offenses. It was neither objectively \nreasonable nor constitutional for the Jail’s personnel personnel to conduct such search or \nto have a policy or practice permitting such searches.  \n66.  The policy, custom and practice of the Gloucester County Sheriff’s \nDepartment, the County of Gloucester and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches of all individuals placed into the Gloucester County Jail without any \nparticularized suspicion that the individuals in question have either contraband or \nweapons.  \n67.  Plaintiffs and members of the Class request that this Court issue a \ndeclaratory judgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of \nGloucester and the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n68.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 67. \n \n18 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0199   o  f  P22a gPea 1g9e IoDf:  212175\n \n69.  The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Gloucester  County  Sheriff’s \nDepartment, the County of Gloucester and the Policy Making Defendants is clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Gloucester  County  Jail  without  any \nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n70.  Upon  information  and  belief,  this  policy  is  currently  in  place  at  the \nGloucester  County  Jail,  with  new  and/or  prospective  members  of  the  Class  being \nsubjected to the harms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiffs.   \n71.  The continuing pattern of strip searching individuals charged with minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n72.  Plaintiffs demand that the County of Gloucester, the Gloucester County \nSheriff’s Department, the Policy Making Defendants and Gloucester County Corrections \nOfficers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of \nthe Gloucester County Jail absent any particularized suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction from this Court ordering as much. \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n73.   The actions of the Individual Defendants detailed herein are outrageous, \nin that they continue to propagate an illegal strip search policy even though they know for \na fact that their actions are unconstitutional. \n \n19 \n\nCasCea s1e:0 16:-0c6v--c0v1-306183-6J8E-IJ-KEMI-AWM  D D  o  c Dumoceunmt e6n2t   6 F0il-e2d    0  3 F/0il9e/d0 90 3  /P05a/g2e0 0290   o  f  P22a gPea 2g0e IoDf:  212176\n \n74.  It is clear that the Policy Making Defendants, the County of Gloucester \nand the Gloucester County Sheriff’s Department have no respect for the civil rights of \nindividual citizens or for the rule of law.  Consequently, an award of punitive damages is \nnecessary to punish the Policy Making Defendants, and to send a message to them that \nthe requirements of the United States Constitution also apply to government officials in \nGloucester County. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n75.   The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Wilson and DePietro, on behalf of themselves and on \nbehalf of a class of others similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant them \nthe following relief: \nA.

No. 89); the Court having considered Plaintiffs’\nsubmissions; the Defendants agreeing to Plaintiffs’ request; and\nit appearing that:\n1.  This case is a class action against the Defendant,\nCounty of Gloucester.  Plaintiffs alleged that the County had an\nunlawful strip search policy that violated the class members’\nrights and entitled Plaintiffs and class members to damages.\n2.  On March 25, 2010, this Court gave final approval to the\nproposed Settlement, in which Defendant agreed to change its\nstrip search policy and provide Plaintiffs and class members with\nmonetary damages in the amount of $4,000,000.\n3.  Pursuant to the Settlement, the class representatives\neach received an incentive payment of $15,000, and class counsel\nwas awarded attorneys’ fees in the amount of $1,154,646.75 and\nexpenses in the amount of $44,603.25.  In addition, $274,995.79\nwas deducted to cover the Garden City Group’s (“GCG”)\n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-KMW   Document 91   Filed 11/13/12   Page 3 of 4 PageID: 3255\nadministrative expenses. \n4.  Class members were entitled to receive their pro rata\nshare of the settlement fund after the above amounts were\ndeducted.  Approximately 3,510 class members received payments of\n$711.01.\n5.  As of July 31, 2012, $93,900.59 remained in the\nsettlement fund.  GCG re-issued a check to one class member,\nwhich reduced the amount by $711.01.\n6.  While completing the initial distribution, GCG performed\na significant amount of post-distribution work by reaching out to\nclass members to cash their checks and performing several fraud\ninvestigations in connection with checks cashed by persons other\nthan the class members.  Because GCG exceeded its estimated fees\nand expenses by approximately $16,867.36, class counsel has\npetitioned the Court to approve an additional fee to GCG in that\namount.  Defendants have agreed to this request.\n7.  The parties also request that the remaining balance in\nthe settlement fund, approximately $76,322, be paid to Gloucester\nCounty as a cy pres recipient.\nIT IS on this 13th   day of November, 2012,\nORDERED THAT:\n1.  The Garden City Group shall receive an additional fee in\nthe amount of $16,867.36.\n2.  The remaining balance in the settlement fund of\n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-KMW   Document 91   Filed 11/13/12   Page 4 of 4 PageID: 3256\napproximately $76,322 shall be paid to Gloucester County as\na cy pres recipient.\n /s/ Joseph E.

For at least the past 2 years, the Gloucester County \nSheriff's Department has had a policy of strip-searching all individuals who enter the \nGloucester County Jail and are placed in jail clothing, regardless of the crime upon which \nthey are charged.  Upon information and belief, this policy is, in part, derived from the \nwritten procedures of the Gloucester County Sheriff's Department, and was promulgated \nby senior Department officials;  specifically, Defendants  Gilbert Miller, III,  Joseph C. \nO'Leary, Michael Silvert, Fred Catalano, Robert M. Balicki, Darryl Johnson and Carol \n. \nPistorio. \n, \nIt has been well established in this judicial circuit for many years that individuals \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations cannot be strip-searched absent particularized \nsuspicion that they possess weapons or contraband.  In short, the policy of Gloucester \nCounty and  the  Gloucester County  Sheriff's Department to  force  those  charged with \nminor crimes to undergo the indignities of a strip search upon entry into the Gloucester \nCounty Jail is not only clearly illegal, but is insensitive and unnecessary. \nSandra  King  Wilson  and  Joseph  DePietro  bring  this  action  on  behalf of \nthemselves, and on behalf of a class of thousands of others who were strip searched after \nbeing charged with petty crimes, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of their \ncivil rights and those of the class members they propose to  represent.  Both of these \nindividuals were charged with misdemeanor and/or violation offenses,  and both were \nsubject to strip searches, in violation of their right against unreasonable searches under \nthe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  They seek monetary damages \n2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 3 of 22(cid:10)\nfor themselves and each member of the proposed class, a declaration that the Sheriff's \nDepartment's  policies  are  unconstitutional,  and  an  injunction  precluding  Gloucester \nCounty, Gloucester County Corrections and the Gloucester County Sheriff's Department \nfrom continuing to violate the rights of those placed into their custody.  With this as a \nbackground, Plaintiffs Sandra King Wilson and Joseph DePietro complain as follows: \nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \n§§  1331,  1341  &  1343  because it is filed to  obtain compensatory damages, punitive \ndamages, and injunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights \nof citizens of the United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C.  §§  1981  &  1983.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the \nprovisions .of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the \nConstitutionality of the policies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise \nto  Plaintiffs'  claims  and  those  of proposed  class  members  occurred  in this judicial \ndistrict. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Sandra  King  Wilson  (\"Wilson\")  is  50  years  old  and  resides  in \nCamden, New Jersey.  Ms. Wilson was arrested on or about September 2005and placed \nin the Gloucester County Correctional Facility on charges of shop lifting, violation of \nprobation for shop lifting and municipal detainers. \n3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 4 of 22(cid:10)\n4.  Plaintiff Joseph DePietro  (\"DePietro\")  resides  in Gloucester  County, New \nJersey.

Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(l), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of \nthe Federai Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly \nsituated individuals who were charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and were strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Gloucester County Jail. \n17. The class that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defined as follows: \nAll persons who have been or will be placed into the custody of the \nGloucester  County  Jail  after  being  charged  with  misdemeanors, \nviolations, violations of probation or parole, traffic infractions, civil \ncommitments  or  other  minor  crimes  and  were  or  will  be  strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Gloucester County Jail pursuant to \nthe policy, custom and practice of the Gloucester County Sheriff's \nDepartment  and  the  County  of Gloucester.  The  class  period \ncommences on March 22, 2004 and extends to the date on which the \nGloucester  County  Sheriffs  Departrnent  and/or  the  County  of \nGloucester are enjoined from,  or otherwise cease, enforcing their \nunconstitutional  policy,  practice  and  custom  of conducting  strip \nsearches absent reasonable suspicion.  Specifically excluded from \nthe class are Defendants and any and all oftheir respective affiliates, \nlegal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees. \n18. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action \nunder Federal law and satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nrequirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n19. The members of the class are so numerous as to render joinder impracticable. \nUpon information and belief, there are hundreds of people arrested for misdemeanors and \nviolations who are placed into the custody of the Gloucester County Jail every month -\nall of whom are members of the proposed class.  Upon information and belief, the size of \nthe proposed class totals at least 5,000 individuals, some of whom have had their civil \nrights violated on mUltiple occasions. \n8 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 9 of 22(cid:10)\n20. Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable  because  of the  large  number of class  members  and  the  fact  that class \nmembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently residing outside of Gloucester County and this Judicial District.  Furthermore, \nupon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may \nnot  speak  English,  and  likely  would  have  great  difficulty  in  pursuing  their  rights \nindividually. \n21. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in that \nthey all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Defendants' \nconducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion.  All members of the class were \ncharged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody' of the Gloucester \nCounty Jail, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the established law in this \njudicial circuit. \n22. Plaintiffs'  claims  are  typical  of the  claims  of the  members  of the· Class. \nPlaintiffs and  all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendants' \ncourse of conduct.  The harms suffered by the Plaintiffs are typical of the harms suffered \nby the class members. \n23. The  representative  Plaintiffs  have  the  requisite  personal  interest  in  the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \nPlaintiffs have no interests that are adverse to the interests of the members of the Class. \n24. Plaintiffs have retained counsel who have substantial experience and success \nin the prosecution of class action and civil rights litigation.  The named Plaintiffs are \nbeing represented by  William Riback;  Jonathan Cuneo and Charles LaDuca of Cuneo \n9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 10 of 22(cid:10)\nGilbert &  LaDuca, LLP; Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich of the Locks Law Firm, PLLC; \nElmer Robert Keach, III; and Gary E. Mason of The Mason Law Firm, PLLC. \n25. William Riback is an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who \nhas successfully litigated class actions in both state and federal  courts in a number of \njurisdictions across the country. \n26. Jonathan W. Cuneo and Charles 1. LaDuca of Cuneo Gilbert & LaDuca, LLP, \nhave  extensive  experience  in  state and  federal  trial  and  appellate  courts,  before  law \nenforcement authorities and in proceedings before the United States Congress.  Cuneo \nand  LaDuca  have  successfully  prosecuted  complex  class  actions,  including  cases \ninvolving securities fraud, antitrust violations, consumer protection and products liability \nin state and federal courts throughout the United States. In addition to this experience, \nCuneo and LaDuca are co-counsel in several strip-search class actions, with Mr. Keach, \none of which was recently certified in the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of New York against the County of Schenectady and other related Defendants. \n27. Seth Lesser and Fran Rudich of the Locks Law Firm with offices in Cherry \nHill and New York City, are both experienced civil rights and class action attorneys.  Mr. \nLesser is one of this country's premier class action attorneys having successfully litigated \ncivil rights, consumer protection and products liability class actions against Fortune 500 \ncompanies in  courts across  the  country,  including both New Jersey state and federal \ncourts. Ms. Rudich has litigated scores of individual and class action civil rights cases \nagainst a number of Defendants in over ten jurisdictions throughout the United States. \n28. Mr.  Keach is  an experienced civil rights and class action attorney who  has \nlitigated a wide variety of civil rights actions, and has litigated class action lawsuits in \nstate and federal courts in five states.  Mr. Keach has successfully litigated strip search \n! \n10 \nI \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 11 of 22(cid:10)\ncases against the Troy City Police Department and the Schenectady School District, and \nwas  lead counsel in the Rensselaer County Jail strip search class action that recently \nsettled. \n29. Gary E.  Mason is one of this country's premier class action attorneys, with \noffices in Washington, DC.  Mr.  Mason has successfully litigated class actions against \nFortune 500 companies in both state and federal  court in over a dozen jurisdictions, \nincluding gaining a settlement for a class of purchasers of defective polybutylene pipe of \n$ 950 million dollars.  Mr. Mason has served as lead or co-counsel in numerous high \nprofile class actions,  including In Re  The Exxon  Valdez,  In  Re  Diet Drugs Product \nLiability Litigation and In Re Synthetic Stucco (EIFS) Product Liability Litigation. \n,30. In short, Plaintiffs'  counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully  prosecute  this  action  against  Gloucester County,  the  Gloucester  County \nSheriff's Department and the Policy Making Defendants.  Counsel for Plaintiffs knows of \nno conflicts among members of the class, or between counsel and members of the class. \n31. This  action,  in part,  seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  As  such, the \nPlaintiffs' seek class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all class members \nwere subject to the same policy requiring the illegal strip searches of individuals charged \nwith misdemeanor or minor crimes and placed into the custody of the Gloucester County \nJail.  In short, the County of Gloucester, the Gloucester County Sheriffs Department, the \nPolicy Making Defendants and Gloucester County Corrections Officers acted on grounds \ngenerally applicable to all class members. \n32. In  addition  to  certification  under  Rule  23(b )(2),  and  the  alternative, \nIn \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \nII \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 12 of 22(cid:10)\n33. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, and \npredominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class.  These \ncommon  questions  of law  and  fact  include,  without  limitation,  the  common  and \npredominate question of whether the Defendants' written and/or de facto policy of strip \nsearching all individuals charged with misdemeanors or minor crimes and committed to \nthe Gloucester County Jail is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited  States Constitution, and  whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed \nduring the class period. \n34. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members of the \nclass is impracticable given the large number of class members and the fact that they are \ndispersed  over a  large  geographical  area.  Furthermore,  the  expense  and  burden  of \nindividual litigation would make it difficult or impossible for individual members of the \nclass  to  redress  the  wrongs done  to  them.  The cost to  the  federal  court system of \nadjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.  Individualized litigation \nwould  also  magnify  the  delay and  expense  to  all  parties and  the court system.  By \ncontrast, the conduct of this action as a class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n35. Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address the \nDefendants' flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even though \nthe Defendants have maintained their illegal strip search regimen for at least the past 2 \nyears. \n12 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 13 of 22(cid:10)\n36. In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs also \nseek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n37. The  Fourth  Amendment  of the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits  state \nofficials,  such  as  the  Policy  Making Defendants  in  this  action  and  the  Corrections \nOfficers they  supervise,  from  performing  strip  searches  of arrestees  who  have  been \ncharged with  misdemeanors  or other minor  crimes unless the  officer has  reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband. \n38. Upon information and belief, the County of Gloucester, the Gloucester County \nSheriffs Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or \nde facto  policy,  custom ·or  practice  of strip  searching  all  individuals  who  enter the \ncustody of the Gloucester County Jail and are placed into jail clothing, regardless of the \nnature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat the individual was concealing a weapon o\"r contraband. \n39. Upon information and belief, the County of Gloucester, the Gloucester County \nSheriffs Department and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and/or \nde facto  policy, custom or practice of conducting visual body cavity  searches (visual \ninspection of the vaginal and rectal cavities) on all individuals who enter the custody of \nthe Gloucester County Jail, regardless of the individual characteristics or the nature of \ntheir charged crime.  For purposes of this Complaint, strip and visual cavity searches are \ncollectively referred to as \"strip searches.\" \n40. The County of Gloucester, the Gloucester County Correctional Facility and \nthe Gloucester County Sheriff's Department, and the Policy Making Defendants know \n13 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 14 of 22(cid:10)\nthat they may not  institute, enforce or permit enforcement of a  policy or practice of \nconducting strip searches without particularized, reasonable suspicion.  Upon information \nand belief, the Gloucester Police's written policy was based on the policy promulgated by \nthe Gloucester County Sheriff's Department. \n41. The  Defendants'  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom \nmandating wholesale strip searches of all misdemeanor and violation arrestees has been \npromulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly established \nlaw. \n42. Reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search may only emanate from the \nparticular circumstances antecedent to the search, such as the nature of the crime charged, \nthe particular characteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest. \n43. Upon information and belief, the County of Gloucester, the Gloucester County \nSheriff's Department and Policy Making Defendants have promulgated,  implemented, \nenforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or de facto policy, practice or custom of \nstrip searching all individuals placed into the custody of the Gloucester County Jail and \nplaced  into jail clothing without any  requirement of reasonable  suspicion,  or indeed \nsuspicion of any sort.  This written and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pre \ntrial detainees routine; neither the nature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the \narrestee, nor the circumstances of a particular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of \nthe policy, practice and custom of routine strip searches. \n44. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each member of the Class, \nincluding every named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine strip search upon their entry \ninto the Gloucester County Jail.  These searches were conducted without inquiry into or \nestablishment of reasonable  suspicion,  and  in fact  were  not  supported by  reasonable \n14 \n\n-, \nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 15 of 22(cid:10)\nsuspicion.  Strip  searches  are  conducted  for  individuals  arrested  for,  among  other \ninnocuous offenses, Driving While Intoxicated, Harassment and Trespassing. \n45. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to this written and/or de/acto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches \neach member of the class, including every named Plaintiff - has suffered or will suffer \npsychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiffs \nA.  SANDRA KING WILSON \n46. Sandra King Wilson was arrested on September 2005suspicion of 4th degree \nshoplifting and violation of probation which arose from a guilty plea to  shoplifting in \n2003. \n47. Upon arrival of the Gloucester County Correctional Facility Ms. Wilson was \nrequired to  undress  in  the  shower area in the  presence of an  observing Correctional \nOfficer.  Ms. Wilson was required to bend down and cough while manually required to \nspread her buttocks.  Ms. Wilson was then required to lift her breasts one at a time. \n48. Defendants  strip  searched  her  according  to  policy  without  reasonable \nsuspicion of drug or weapon possession. \n49. As  a  direct 'and  proximate  result  of the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriff s Department policy, practice and custom, Wilson has \nsuffered and continues to  suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nIS \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 16 of 22(cid:10)\nB.  JOSEPH DEPIETRO \n50. Mr.  DePietro  IS  a  disabled  person  receiving  Social  Security  Disability \nbenefits. \n51.  Mr.  Depietro  turned  himself  to  the  Gloucester  Sheriffs  Office  on \nIII \noutstanding child support warrants. \n52. According to the Gloucester County Policy, Mr. Depietro was strip searched \nin the presence and requirement of Gloucester County Correctional Officers. \n53. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of the  unlawful  strip  search  conducted \npursuant to County and Sheriffs Department policy, practice and custom, DePietro has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \nViolation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law \n-- Unreasonable Search and Failure to Implement Municipal Policies to Avoid \nConstitutional Deprivations Under Color of State Law --\n54. Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation \nstated in paragraphs I through 50. \n55. The  Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  unreasonable searches by  law enforcement  officers,  and prohibits officers from \nconducting strip searches of individuals arrested for misdemeanors or violations absent \nsome particularized suspicion that the  individual in question has  either contraband or \nweapons. \n16 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 17 of 22(cid:10)\n56. The actions of Defendants detailed above violated Plaintiffs' rights under the \nUnited States Constitution.  Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for Gloucester \nCounty Corrections Officers to strip search Plaintiffs and Class members based on their \narrests for misdemeanor/violation charges.  It was also not objectively reasonable for the \nPolicy Making  Defendants to  order/direct Gloucester County  Corrections  Officers to \nconduct such searches. \n57. These strip searches were conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or practice \nof the  County  of Gloucester,  the  Gloucester  County  Correctional  Facility  and  the \nGloucester County Sheriff s Department.  As such, the County of Gloucester is directly \nliable for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and members of the Class. \n58. Upon  information  and  belief,  Sheriff  Miller,  Undersheriff  O'Leary, \nUndersheriff Silvert, . Officer Catalano, Director Balicki, Warden Johnson and Captain \nPistorio are responsible for establishing the policies and procedures to be utilized in the \noperation of the Gloucester County Jail, and are responsible for the implementation of the \nstrip search policy questioned in this lawsuit.  As such, Miller, O'Leary, Silvert, Catalano \nand Balicki are each individually responsible for the damages of the named Plaintiffs and \nmembers of the Class. \n59. Sheriff Miller, Undersheriff O'Leary, Undersheriff Silvert, Officer Catalano, \nDirector Balicki, Warden Johnson and Captain Pistorio knew that the GC]'s strip search \npolicy was illegal, and acted willfully, knowingly, and with specific intent to deprive \nPlaintiffs and members of the Class of their Constitutional rights. \n60. This conduct on the part of all Defendants represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, given that their actions were undertaken under color of state law. \n17 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 18 of 22(cid:10)\n61. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, \nPlaintiffs have been irreparably injured. \nAS AND FOR A SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL \nDEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment --\n62. Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 58. \n63. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Gloucester  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment, the  County  of Gloucester and  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  is  clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Gloucester  County  Jail  without  any \nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n64. Plaintiffs and members of the Class request that this Court issue a declaratory \njudgment, and that it declare the strip search policy of the County of Gloucester and the \nGloucester County Sheriff's Department to be unconstitutional. \nAS AND FOR A THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n65. Plaintiffs  incorporate  by  reference  and  reallege  each  and  every  allegation \nstated in paragraphs 1 through 61. \n66. The  policy,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Gloucester  County  Sheriffs \nDepartment, the  County  of Gloucester and  the  Policy  Making  Defendants  is  clearly \nunconstitutional, in that these entities and individuals are directing/conducting the strip \n18 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-01368-JEI-AMD     Document 1     Filed 03/22/2006     Page 19 of 22(cid:10)\nsearches  of  all  individuals  placed  into  the  Gloucester  County  Jail  without  any \nparticularized  suspicion  that  the  individuals  in  question  have  either  contraband  or \nweapons. \n67. Upon information and belief, this policy is currently in place at the Gloucester \nCounty Jail, with new and/or prospective members of the Class being subjected to the \nharms that have already been inflicted upon the named Plaintiffs. \n68. The  continuing  pattern of strip  searching  individuals  charged  with  minor \ncrimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or prospective members of the Class, \nan adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n69. Plaintiffs  demand  that  the  County  of Gloucester,  the  Gloucester  County \nSheriff's Department, the Policy Making Defendants and Gloucester County Corrections \nOfficers immediately desist from strip searching individuals placed into the custody of \nthe  Gloucester County Jail  absent any particularized  suspicion that the individuals in \nquestion have either contraband or weapons, and seek both a preliminary and permanent \ninjunction from this Court ordering as much. \nDEMAND FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES \n70.
