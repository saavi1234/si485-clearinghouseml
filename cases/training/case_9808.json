    "summary": "<p>On April 26, 2002, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Hancock County, the Hancock County Sheriff, and the Hancock County Jail Administrator, in the United States District Court for the District of Maine.  Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked for compensatory and punitive damages, alleging he was strip-searched in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. </p><p>On May 27, 2001, plaintiff alleged that he was arrested and taken to the Hancock County Jail where he was told to strip and shower while being watched by officers, and was then subjected to a visual body cavity search, which an officer told him was \"routine procedure.\"  Plaintiff alleged that because this search occurred after he requested an attorney, it violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel.  On July 20, 2001, plaintiff was again arrested and taken to the Hancock County Jail, where he was subjected to a clothing search and a shower while being watched, but not a body cavity search.  On July 11, 2001, plaintiff had two contact visits with his attorney.  After the second visit, plaintiff was subjected to a visual body cavity strip-search.</p><p>On January 7, 2003, the Court (United States Magistrate Judge Margaret J. Kravchuck) recommended denying defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment.</p><p>On February 12, 2003, the District Court (Judge George Z. Singal), adopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation and: (1) held that complaint stated a claim, precluding judgment on the pleadings, and (2) denied summary judgment for defendants because there were genuine issues of fact as to whether the jail policy of strip-searching misdemeanor arrestees after contact visits was reasonable and whether the jail had a custom of strip-searching arrestees upon admission.  The Court found no evidence that any jail employee suspected that plaintiff concealed contraband.  The Court found that strip-searching arrestees after contact visits could be unreasonable because Defendants did not provide evidence of the dangerousness of the inmate population or history of contraband problems and plaintiff was not given the choice of having a non-contact visit.  The Court held that post-arrest searches require reasonable suspicion that an arrestee concealed contraband.  While defendants argued that these searches were rogue events which defendants were not responsible for, the Court found sufficient evidence to infer that there was a practice of strip-searching arrestees.</p><p>Wood v. Hancock County, 245 F.Supp.2d 231 (D.Me. 2003). </p><p>After a jury trial, on March 20, 2003, the jury found for defendants.  The jury found that the May 27, 2001 or July 10, 2001 searches were not conducted  as a result of Hancock County practice.  Furthermore, the jury found that plaintiff was not unreasonably strip-searched on July 11, 2001.  Plaintiff appealed.</p><p>On December 31, 2003, the First Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges Frank M. Coffin, Bruce M. Selya, and Norman H. Stahl) affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for a partial new trial.  The Court affirmed the verdict as to plaintiff's post-contact strip-search on July 11, because a blanket strip-search policy was justified after contact visits.  The Court ordered a new trial on claims relating to plaintiff's post-arrest searches on May 27th and July 10th, because the jury instructions defined strip-searches too narrowly, as only searches where the officer inspects an arrestee's mouth and underarms.  </p><p>Wood v. Hancock County Sheriff's Dept., 354 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 2003).</p><p>On May 5, 2004, the parties settled.</p><p>On June 11, 2004, the parties stipulated to dismissal without costs or interest to any party.</p><p>Docket: CV-02-69</p><p></p>",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDISTRICT OF MAINE\nGEOFFREY V. V. WOOD,\nPlaintiff,\nVS.\nCase no. CV-02-\nHANCOCK COUNTY,\nWILLIAM CLARK, SHERIFF, and\nLINDA HANNAN, JAIL ADMINISTRATOR,\nDefendants.\nCOMPLAINT\nGeoffrey V. V. Wood is an individual residing in Bar Harbor, Hancock County,\nMaine.\n2. Hancock County is a political subdivision of the State of Maine\nWilliam Clark is the Sheriff of Hancock County, Maine, at all times relevant to this\nComplaint acting under color of State and County law.\nLinda Hannan is the Jail Administrator for the Hancock County Jail, at all times\n°\nrelevant to this Complaint acting under color of State and County law.\n5. A jury trial is demanded.\nOn May 27, 2001, the Plaintiff was arrested by the Mount Desert police, \"patted\no\ndown,\" and taken to the Hancock County Jail for booking.\nDuring the booking process, the Plaintiff asked for the assistance of an attorney to\no\nobtain advice regarding the paperwork he was being required to sign. The Plaintiff at\nno time became belligerent.\nIn response to Plaintiff’s requests for the right to consult with an attorney, jail\npersonnel stated that \"This can be done the hard way\" while slowly donning rubber\ngloves and glaring at him in an intimidating manner.\n\nThe Plaintiff was escorted to the shower, stripped of his clothing, and\nrequired to shower while jail personnel surveilled him.\n10. After the shower, the Plaintiff was subjected to a search of his person,\nincluding a visual body cavity search in which he was required to bend\nover and spread his buttocks apart so that the jail personnel could\ninspect his body.\n11. The Plaintiff was released from the jail at 4:30 am on May 28, 2001.\n12. The Plaintiff was extremely intimidated and humiliated by this process.\n13. On July 10, 2001, in a separate incident, the Plaintiff was again arrested\nand brought to the Hancock County Jail after being \"patted down.\"\n14. After booking, the Plaintiff was subjected to a clothing search, and a\nshower during which he was surveilled, but not subjected to a visual\nbody cavity search.\n15. On July 11,2001, the Plaintiff was visited by his attorney at the jail at\napproximately 8:30 am, for a 5 - 10 minute meeting. The Plaintiff was\nnot subjected to a strip search, clothing search, or visual body cavity\nsearch either before or after this meeting.\n16. Approximately thirty minutes later, Plaintiff’s attorney returned to the jail\nto meet with the Plaintiff for another fifteen minutes. Plaintiff’s attorney\nwas searched by way of a detection wand upon entry to the jail, and\nbrought with her only a legal pad and a pen.\n17. After the meeting was concluded and the Plaintiff and his attorney were\nleaving the visiting area, a member of the jail personnel informed the\nPlaintiff that he was to be strip searched prior to returning to the general\njail population. The Plaintiff was then strip searched and subjected to a\nvisual body cavity search.\n18. Defendant Linda Hannan and Defendant William Clark have both stated\nthat there is a \"confidential\" official jail policy to strip search anyone\nplaced in the jail after any contact visit, and that this policy is exempt\nfrom the Freedom of Access laws.\n19. Both strip searches were conducted in violation of the \"Minimum\nStandards\" of the State of Maine Department of Corrections standards\nfor small jails and the State of Maine Attorney General’s standards.\n\n20. In further violation of the above described standards, there is no record\nof the strip search or booking that occurred on May 27, 2001, or of the\nvisual body cavity strip search that occurred on July 11,2001.\nCount I: Violation of 42 U.S.C. ~ 1983\n21. Plaintiff repeats and realleges paragraphs 1 - 20 as if set forth fully\nherein.\n22. The Plaintiff was strip searched and subjected to a visual body cavity\nsearch without a reasonable suspicion that he was in possession of\ncontraband, or had violated any rule or law, in violation of his Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches\nof his person.\n23. Defendants’ conduct deprived Plaintiff of his constitutional rights as\nstated in paragraph 22, above.\n24. PlaintifFs right to be free from such unreasonable searches was a clearly\ndefined right under the United States Constitution, and the laws of the\nUnited States and the State of Maine, including case law. Defendants\nare not entitled to qualified immunity.\n25. The May 27, 2001 strip search and visual body cavity search was further\nperformed as direct retaliation for Plaintiff’s request to consult with an\nattorney in regard to his arrest, in violation of his Fifth and Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel.\n26. The Plaintiff suffered intimidation, degradation, humiliation, and a loss\nof dignity as a result of the above described strip searches.\nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff demands judgment in an amount to be\nproven at trial, compensatory damages, punitive damages, for his attorney’s\nfees, costs, interest, and for such other and further relief as may be just in the\npremises.\nDate: t~ _~ ~- 0~--- ~~.Y~ ~YK-\nSandra Hylander Collier, ~\nAttorney at Law\n121 Main Street, PO Box 1391\nEllsworth, Maine 04605\n207/667-6417",

Do you remember?\n4 Two weeks, I believe.\n5 And did you successfully complete that course?\n6 Yes, I did, number one in my class.\n7 As far as the trainin£ that you £ot at the jail, did\n8 some of that training deal with issues of searching people\n9 who were being booked into jail?\ni0 A     Yes.\nIi Q     Were there different types of searches that you were\n12 trained in?\n13 A Yes.\n14 Q What were those?\n15 A Pat search, clothing search, and strip search.\n~16 Q What’s pat search?\n17 A Pat search is upon arrival at the facility it’s an\n18 outer patting of the clothes to find any weapons or\n19 contraband.\n20 Q     And what were you trained in terms of what a clothing\n21 search is?\n22 A     A clothing search is strictly a search of the clothes\n23 themselves.\n24 Q     And how do you conduct a clothing search based on your\n25 training7\n\n449\n1 A     Based on my training, we’d ask for the shirt, fully\n2 inspect the shirt, ask for the shoes, fully inspect the\n3 shoes, socks, pants, underwear, and then they would get into\n4 the shower.\n5 Q     What is it that you are looking for when you’re doing\n6 that search?\n7 A     Any type of. contraband hidden in the clothes.\n8 Q     Are you -- what ’- what are you searching to look for\n9 the contraband?\ni0 A Searching clothes.\nii And how long is the person fully disrobed in front of\n12 you?\n13 A From the time that he takes his 1.ast piece of clothing\n14 off until he steps into the shower, no more than a few\n15 seconds.\n16 Q     Do you recognize Defendants’ Exhibit 17\n17 A     Yes.\n18 Q     What is that, sir?\n19 A     That’s the apron for the shower.\n2O Q     The curtain?\n21 A     Curtain.\n22 Q     And was there ever a different curtain in the shower in\n23 the nurse’s station in booking when you worked there?\n24 A     Not to my recollection.\n25 Q     When an inmate got in there behind that, could you see\n\n450\ntheir genitals while they were showering7\nA     No.\nQ     Did I ask you what a strip search was? I don’t believe\nSO.\nA     No, you didn’t.\n6 Q     Could you tell us what a strip search is, please?\n7 A     A strip search is after you’ve gone through all their\n8 clothes, you do a physical search of the body by having them\n9 run their hands through their hair, open their mouth, check\nI0 their ears, have them lift their arms, and then have them\nii lift their genitals, and then bend over, spread their\n12 buttocks, and cough.\n13 Q     Now, does everybody who comes into the jail get pat-\n14 searched?\n15 A     Yes.\n16 Q     Does everybody who comes into the jail get clothing-\n17 searched?\n18 A If they’re going to remain there, yes.\n19 Q What do you mean by if they’re going to remain there?\n20 A Well, if they’re going to bail out, then normally we\n21 have -- they just kept them in a secure holding cell in\n22 booking. They were pat-searched and placed in there after\n23 they were booked. If they were going to be bailing out,\n24 they’d stay right there. If they were going to be spending\n25 the night or waiting to go to court, then they would be\n\n451\ni clothing-searched and placed inside the facility.\n2 Q     And was everybody strip-searched7\n3 A     The only ones that were strip-searched upon entering\n4 the facility would be people that were already sentenced, or\n5 anybody that was believed to have contraband on them, or\n6 anybody that was charged with a felony.\n7 Q     So if somebody was charged with a misdemeanor, did they\n8 or didn’t they get strip-searched7\n9 A     No, they got clothing-searched.\nI0 Q     Would there be any time you would strip-search someone\nIi who was charged with a misdemeanor7\n12 A     If they had probable cause to believe that the inmate\n13 was going to be carrying some sort of contraband into the\n14 facility.\n15 Q     Okay. I’m going to show you some documents. I’m going\n16 to give you --\n17 MR. MARCHESI: Are Joint 7 and Defendants’ 20 here7\n18 THE CLERK: What was the first one7\n19 MR.

COLLIER: It’s just a copy of the same thing.\n17 No objection.\n18 THE COURT: All right. It’s admitted without\n19 objection.\n2O BY MR. MARCHESI:\n21 Q You filled out Joint Exhibit 7?\n22 A The computerized part of it?\n23 Q Yes.\nYes. The handwritten part, no.\n25 Q Okay. The handwritten part is dated, the following day;\n\n454\nis that right?\nA     Correct.\n3 Q     Can you tell by.looking at that document who booked Mr.\n4 Wood into the jail on that date?\n5 A      I did.\n6 Q     Can you tell by looking at that document what type of\n7 search you did?\n8 A     Clothing search.\n9 Q     There’s evidence in this case that you booked Mr. Wood\ni0 in, and you made him go through the whole strip-search\nii procedure, except for bending over and exposing his buttocks.\n12 Do you know whether or not you did that?\n13 A     No, I did not.\n14 Q     How do you know that?\n15 A      I do remember Mr. Wood coming in on the day that I\n16 booked him. I do remember he had an attitude when he came\n17 in. That’s mainly the reason I remember him. Every time he\n18 did, he did have an attitude. But it was a normal -- normal\n19 run of the things. I went through the procedure, did a\n20 llclothing search on him, and put him inside.\n21 Q     You’re sure you didn’t do a strip search?\n22 A Positive.\n23 MR. MARCHESI: That’s all I have. Thank you, Your\n24 Honor.\n25 THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Ma-rchesi. Cross-\n\n455\n1 examination?\n2 CROSS-EXAMINATION\n3 BY MS. COLLIER:\n4 Q     Officer Wilmot, when did you last work at the Hancock\n5 County Jail7\n6 A     Honestly I couldn’t tell you. I don’t know. I don’t\n7 know when my last date of work was.\n8 Q     Now, everything that you did on the night of July 10th,\n9 2001, involving Mr. Wood, did you act in accordance with what\ni0 you understood to be the policies, practices, or customs of\nII the Hancock County Jail7\n12 A     I followed the procedures and policies of the Hancock\n13 County Jail, yes.\n14 Q     Now, with respect to the search of the clothing that\n15 yo~ did of Mr. Wood, you took Mr. Wood into the medical room\n16 or what’s called the nurse’s room --\n17 A Nurse’s station.\n18 Q -- to do that7\n19 A Yes, ma’am. -\n20 Q Okay. And you asked Mr. Wood to take off all of his\n21 clothing?\n.\n22 A One item at a time.\n23 Q And did you ask him to hand those items to you?\n24 A Yes.\n\n456\n1 asked him to give you his clothing?\n2 A     We were in sight contact, yes.\n3 You maintained eye Contact with him7\n4 A     Yes.\n5 And, of course, maintained eye contact with his person,\n6 as well as his --\n7 A     Yes.\n8 Q     Okay. So you would agree that this was a time during\n9 which you were observing Mr. Wood’s person, as well as\ni0 checking the clothing7\nIi A     You’re going to maintain eye contact, and you’re going\n12 to maintain a visual of him for officer safety reasons. Yes,\n13 you are going to be in the same room with them, and you are\n14 going to be asking them to take off a piece of clothing at a\n15 time. You are going to be physically inspecting the clothes,\n16 not the person.\n17 But when you say. you’re going to maintain a visual on\n18 them, you mean that you’re going to maintain a visual of\n19 their body while they’re in the process of disrobing,\n20 correct7\n21 A     Yes.\n22 Q     Okay. You’re not trained to look away while they’re in\n23 that process7\n24 A     No, that would be an officer safety issue.\n25 Okay. And once the individual, in this case Mr. Wood,\n\n457\nhas removed all of his clothing, do you follow Mr. Wood into\nthe shower area and keep him under observation while he’s\nshowering?\nA     Where I would -- where we normally stand and where he\nis is a matter of a few feet apart. We normally stand at the\n6 entrance to the actual shower area where there’s a partial\n7 partition, and then the shower is behind the partition. That\n8 way we can keep a visual on the inmate and then get his\n9 clothes, and then he turns around and goes into the shower.\nI0 Q So it’s your answer that you do maintain surveillance\nIi of the individual, in this case Mr. Wood, during the time\n12 he’s actually showering?\n13 A     We do maintain -- yes, we are -- we’re -- yes, we do\n14 maintain a visual on them. We’re not physical.ly inspecting\n15 them, having them raise their arms or anything like that, and\n16 we’re also bringing clothes and a towel so that they can dry\n17 off and change up when they get out of the shower.\n18 Q     And when you in this -- you say you do have a clear\n19 memory of Hr. Wood that night?\n20 A     Yes, I remember Mr. Wood coming in, yes.\n21 And you’ve had a chance to look at these documents --\n22 Defendants’ 20, Defendants’ 12 -- that have your name on\n23 them, correct?\n24 A     Yes.\n25 Q     And you had a chance to.talk to Mr. Marchesi about your\n\n458\ntestimony here today?\nA     Other than on the telephone briefly, no, we haven’t sat\ndown and talked.\nQ     You did talk to him about what happened that night and\nwhat you were going to testify to?\n6 A     Well, yes, actually, we did have a couple meetings a\n7 couple weeks ago or something along those lines.\n8 Q     How many -- wet1, strike that.\n9 Is it your recollection that during the time period in\ni0 question and specifically take July 10th, 2001, at any given\nIi time, you had approximately 45 to SO inmates at the Hancock\n\"12 County Jail?\n13 A     Oh, could be. I -- I’m not -- I’d have to look at\n14 records to find out how many we had in there that day.\n15 Q And you have people coming in -- inmates, that is,\n16 coming in and going out at all times of the day?\n17 A Yes.\n18 Q People being discharged, people being let out on bail?\n19 A Hm-hmm.\n20 Q People being arrested --\n21 A Yes.\n22 Q -- coming in? Okay. Can you estimate for the jury\n23 about how many inmates came into the jail, let’s say, July\n24 lOth, 2001?\n25 A If I can take a look at that, I can probably get a\n\n459\n1 pretty good estimate of who came in when.\n2 Okay. And that is the --\n3 A That’d be the booking\n4 Q The booking log. Okay. You may have it there, sir.\n5 Is it Defendants’ 20?\n6 A Yes, ma’am.\n7 Q Do you have it? All right. Would you take a look at\n8 that?\n9 A (Witness looking at exhibit.) There’d be approximately\nI0 ieight people in and out of the facility that day while I was\nii in the booking room.\n12 Q     Okay. And on the third page of that document, if\n13 could -- if I could ask you to look at that for me. Again,\n14 this is the booking log for July IOth, 2001. Doesn’t the log\n15 indicate that you did not book Mr. Wood, but, in fact, TBR,\n16 who I believe we understand to be Troy Richardson, booked Mr.\n17 Wood?\n18 A     (Witness looking at exhibit.) No, I would have had to\n19 have -- if I. signed it, I would have had to have booked him.\n2O Q     We11,.you’re looking at a different piece of paper,\n21 aren’t you?\n22 A     Well, I’m looking at the booking log on January lOth --\n23 or I’m sorry -- July 1Oth.\n24 Q     Hm-hmm. Are you looking at Defendants’ Exhibit 20?\n25 A     Yes, I am.\n\n460\nQ      And am I reading that right? Isn’t that what this log.\nindicates, that Sergeant Richardson booked Mr. Wood?\n3 A      This is an entry Log that said that, 9:40 at night,\n4 Officer Rivers from Bar Harbor PD here with Geoffrey Wood,\n5 his date of birth, 10-46 for a violation of a protection\n6 order. Warrants check was negative by Sergeant Richardson.\n7 That was his writing in the booking Log. That would not\n8 indicate what -- who booked him.\n9 Q     If I suggested to you that Captain Hannan testified\ni0 that that did indicate that it was Mr. Richardson and not\nii yourself who booked him, you’d disagree with that?\n12 A     WELL, if I signed the booking -- the booking sheets, I\n13 would have done the booking. Mr. Richardson might have done\n14 the -- actuaLLy typed in the Log, but he wouldn’t have done\n15 the booking. If I put -- if I signed the booking, I did the\n16 booking.\n17 Q     Is the booking Log maintained by the booking officer?\n18 A     Yes, it is for the most part, but generaLLy, sometimes\n19 we do have other officers come in and fiLL information in if\n20 someone has -- we’re busy up-front.\n21 MS. COLLIER: Excuse me just a moment.\n22 A     Wait a minute. I’m sorry. I read this wrong.\n23 THE COURT: Just wait for another question.\n24 BY MS. COLLIER:\n25 Q Officer, I’m just very.confused. On Defendants’\n\n461\ni Exhibit 20, this is the booking log for the afternoon and\n2 into the evening of July lOth, 2001; am I correct7\n3 A     Yes, it is.\n4 Q     Ali right. And in the middle of this -- top of this\n5 document, does it not indicate that your shift ended --\n6 A     Yes, it did.\n7 Q     -- at 3:15 that afternoon?\n8 A     Correct, yes. I was looking at the pages, not the\n9 actual hours up top.\nI0 Q     Okay. And isn’t it your understanding that Mr.~ Wood\nii was brought into the jail the evening of July lOth, 20017\n12 A That’s what it indicates, yes.\n13 Q You weren’t even there, were you7\n14 Evidently not.\n15 MS. COLLIER: I have no further questions.\n16 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Collier. Mr. Marchesi7\n17 REDIRECT EXAMINATION\n18 BY MR. MARCHESI:\n19 Q     Did you signthe booking sheet?\n20 A     Yes, I did.\n21 Q     Defendants’ Exhibit 127\n22 A     Yes, I did.\n23 Q     Would you sign the booking sheet if you didn’t do the\n24 booking?\n25 A     No, I would not have.\n\n462\n1 Q Who booked Mr. Wood?\n2 I would have if I signed it.\n3 MR. MARCHESI: That’s all I have. Thank you,\n4 Judge.\n5 THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Marchesi. Anything\n6 else, Ms. Collier?\n7 MS. COLLIER: No, Your Honor.\n8 THE COURT: Thank you. You may step down. Just\n9 leave everything there.\ni0 :A     Thank you.\nii THE COURT: Thank you very much.\n12 (The witness left the witness stand.)\n13 THE COURT: All right. Is next the video? All\n14 right.\n15 MR. MARCHESI: I’ve got to set the machine up, I\n16 think.\n17 THE COURT: Yeah, I think. The next item of\n18 testimony in this case is a videotape of someone’s testimony,\n19 members of the jury. In view of the fact that we’d have to\n20 set up the equipment and then bring you back in here and\n21 start it, you’d only watch a few minutes of it before I sent\n22 you home at 2:30. So unless anyone on the jury violently\n23 objects, I’m going to let you go home early. Tomorrow we’re\n24 going to have a much longer day, I suspect. So, again, make\n25 your arrangements.\n\n463\n1 I want to remind you not to reach any conclusions or\n2 even start to think about reaching any conclusions. You’re\n3 far from having heard all of the evidence in this case. Keep\n4 an open mind. Don’t discuss this case. I don’t know if\n5 there’s going to be any print or television or radio\n6 ~ublicity about what’s happened in the courtroom. It’s very,\n7 :very important that you not watch or listen or read any of\n8 that because everybody in this case is -- is entitled to have\n9 your decisions based upon what you’ve heard from the witness\ni0 stand or from the exhibits and from nothing else. That\nii wouldn’t be right, and it isn’t legal either. So don’t\n12 discuss this case with anyone and certainly don’t discuss it\n13 with your fellow jurors.\n14 Tomorrow morning I’m going to try to start right on the\n15 button so we can move along with the presentation of\n16 evidence. And with that, I’ll excuse you for the day and\n17 thank you for your work. The jury’s excused.\n18 (Jury exited at 2:16 p.m.)\n19 THE COURT: All right. Counsel, tomorrow morning\n20 make sure that at 8:30 your equipment is set up, and we’re\n21 ready to go. All right. We’re in recess.\n22 (Proceedings concluded at 2:16 p.m.)\n23\n24\n25\n\n464\n1 CERTIFICATION\n2 I certify that the foregoing is a correct transcript\n3 from the record of proceedings in the above-entitled matter.\n4\n5\n6\nJ~lie G.OEdgecomb, RMR, CRR ~ate\"\n7 Official Court Reporter\n8\n9\ni0\nii\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25",

It is further ORDERED that Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.\nRECOMMENDED DECISION ON MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nKRAVCHUK, United States Magistrate Judge.\nGeoffrey Wood was taken into custody at the Hancock County Jail on May 27, 2001, and July 10, 2001, on\ndomestic assault related charges. In this civil rights action he asserts that he was subjected to strip searches\n[1]\nduring his two detentions in contravention of his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,  and Fourteenth\nAmendments of the United States Constitution. (Docket No. 1.) Wood seeks remedy from Hancock County as\nwell as Hancock County Sheriff William Clark and Hancock County Jail Administrator Linda Hannan in their\nofficial capacity on the theory that the impermissible searches were the result of a policy or custom of which the\ndefendants knew or should have known. Before me is the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings or, in\nthe alternative, summary judgment (Docket Nos. 6 & 7), to which Wood has responded (Docket Nos. 14 & 15). I\nalso address the defendants' motion to strike certain paragraphs of Wood's statements of material fact and one\n233 paragraph of Wood's affidavit. (Docket No. 21.) Though I agree with some of the points *233 raised in the\ndefendants' motion to strike, I conclude that it is unnecessary to strike any portions of Wood's pleadings and\ntherefore DENY the motion. I have addressed the pertinent issues raised by the motion to strike while discussing\n\nthe summary judgment motion. Based on the reasons offered below I recommend that the Court DENY the\nmotion for summary judgment.\nDiscussion\nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings\nThe defendants seek dismissal of the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) for failure to state a\nclaim. I conclude that the defendants are not entitled to judgment on the pleadings. The allegations of Wood's\ncomplaint are sufficient to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See generally Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534\nU.S. 506, 512-13, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). I recommend that the court DENY the motion for\njudgment on the pleadings.\nSummary Judgment Standard\nThe defendants are entitled to summary judgment only if, \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits... show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,\"\nFed R. Civ. P. 56(c), and they are \"entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,\" id. For his part, Wood \"has a\nthreshold burden to `set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'\" Quaker State Oil\nRefining Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., Inc., 884 F.2d 1510, 1512 (1st Cir.1989) (quoting Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 56(e)). See also D. Me. Loc. R. Civ. P. 56(c),(e). In evaluating whether a genuine issue is raised, I\nview all facts in the light most favorable to Wood and give him, as nonmovant the benefit of all reasonable\ninferences in his favor. Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir.2000).\nMaterial Facts\nA. The Showers and Searches\nWood was arrested on May 27, 2001, for domestic assault and brought to the Hancock County Jail. When he\narrived at the jail Wood was pat searched pursuant to Hancock County Jail Policies and Procedure number\nD-220(B)(1). Wood was denied bail until the following morning.\nAs part of the admissions process Wood was directed to strip naked in front of two corrections officers, shower\nbehind a clear plastic curtain while being watched by the two officers, open his mouth and lift his tongue, lift his\narms and expose his armpits, run his fingers through his hair, turn around, bend over, and spread his buttocks.\n(Wood Aff. ¶¶ 5,6,7; Wood Dep. at 57-67.) For purposes of this motion the defendants do not contest that Wood\nwas intimidated by the corrections officers; one of them indicated that the shower and search could be done \"the\neasy way or the hard way.\" The room in which the strip and inspection occurred has a window so that Wood was\nvisible to anyone walking by, though there is no indication in this record that any one did see Wood at this time.\n[2]\nWood was told by one of the officers involved in the search that the search was \"routine procedure.\"  The jail's\n234 record *234 for this May 27, 2001, booking indicates only that Wood was subjected to a clothing search by\ncorrections officer Chris Rivers and that he was included in the medium security classification.\nOn July 20, 2001, Wood was arrested and booked at the Hancock County Jail for violation of a protection order\nand bail conditions that arose from his May 27, 2001, domestic assault arrest. At this point he was pat searched\nand denied bail until the following afternoon. He was booked and housed within the general population at the jail.\nOnce again, after the booking, Wood was required to strip naked, take a shower during which he was not\nwatched, open his mouth and lift his tongue, raise his arms and expose his armpits, run his fingers through his\n[3]\nhair, and turnaround.  He was not required to bend over and spread his buttocks. The jail record for the July 10\nbooking indicates that Wood was subjected to a clothing search by corrections officer Chad Wilmot. Wood was\nclassified as minimum security.\n\nOn July 11, 2001, Wood was allowed two contact visits with his attorney. He was not given a choice as to\nwhether or not he would visit with this attorney or whether or not the visit would be a contact or noncontact visit.\nAfter the second contact visit Wood was required to under go a strip search, which, according to Wood, included\nbeing stripped naked in front of a corrections officer, opening his mouth and lifting his tongue, raising his arms\nand exposing his armpits, running his fingers through his hair, turning around, bending over and spreading his\n[4]\nbuttocks.\nB. Policies, Procedures, and Training\nPer jail policy, all arrestees unable to be released on bail are required to shower as part of the admissions\nprocess, a process which includes disrobing and showering in the presence of a corrections officer. Policy C-120\nis entitled \"Strip Search/Documentation/Showers.\" It provides:\n1. In order to ensure the health, safety and security of the inmates and staff, each inmate being\nassigned to a housing unit will be required to shower as part of the admissions process. Inmates\nwill disrobe and shower while in the presence of the Corrections Officer (same sex) in the shower\nroom located in the medical room.\n2. The Corrections Officer will conduct a search of the inmate[`]s clothing and personal effects for\ncontraband and vermin as the inmate prepares to shower....\n3. Each inmate may be subject to a strip search as part of the admission process according to\nPolicy D-220: Search Procedures. Searches completed as part of the admissions process will be\n235 documented in the inmates booking *235 noting the type and by whom the search was done.\n(Hannan Dep. Ex. 4.)\nThe strip search policy for the Hancock County Jail vis-a-vis pre-trial detainees/arrestees charged with\nmisdemeanors is set forth in \"Policy D-220\":\nJail Staff will conduct searches in the least degrading manner possible. At no time are searches to\nbe used to intimidate, degrade, harass or punish any person.\n.....\nAt the time of arrest or initial admission to the facility, a pre-trial inmate charged with a\nmisdemeanor offense shall not be subjected to a strip search, unless the officer has a reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that an inmate is concealing contraband and is about to come into contact\nwith inmates of the facility. If an inmate charged with a misdemeanor crime is subjected to a strip\nsearch upon initial admission, documentation will be made ...\n.....\nStrip searches shall be conducted in private only by and in the presence of [ ] the minimum\nnumber of officers of the same sex as the inmate [ ] which are necessary to accomplish the search\nand to maintain security and protection.\n(Clark Aff. Ex. A.)\nPolicy Number D-220 describes a strip search as: \"A visual search of an inmate which requires the removal of all\nclothing, to include a search of the clothes removed.\" (Hannan Dep. Ex. at 1.) The policy provides:\nOnce the inmate has removed all their clothing and handed it to the officer, the officer shall\nconduct a visual search of the inmate to include having the inmate shake out their hair, check\ninside the mouth, ears, nose, their arm pits, bottoms of their feet, under the scrotum (where\n\napplicable), lift breast (where applicable) and finally have the inmate bend over, spread their butt\ncheeks and cough. In addition, the inmate's clothing and footwear shall be searched.\n(Id. at 2.) Thus, a strip search includes a visual body cavity search.\nWood contends that his post-arrest shower cum searches were pursuant to policy (PSMF ¶ 19) but the\ndefendants contend that this search, if it did occur, was not undertaken pursuant to a jail policy or procedure\n(Defs' Resp. SMF ¶ 19; Hannan Aff. ¶ 2; Clark Aff. ¶ 2).\nAll jail staff members are trained at the beginning of their employment in the policy for searches of misdemeanant\npre-trial detainees and arrestees. The defendants state that periodic updates of this training are provided during\nthe course of employment. (Hannan Aff. ¶ 3; Clark Aff. ¶ 3.) The parties agree that after one forty-hour week of\ninstruction the corrections officers are expected to be familiar with the circumstances under which strip searches\ncould be performed on inmates at the jail. No instructions or directives are given to jail staff regarding strip\nsearches of misdemeanor pre-trial detainees and arrestees that are in any way inconsistent with the contents of\nPolicy D-220.\nHannan and Clark are the final decision and policymaking authorities for all day-today operations at the Hancock\nCounty Jail. Hannan wrote the Hancock County Policies and Procedures which were approved by Clark, as\n236 sheriff.[5] Hannan was *236 present at the jail from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and\noccasional weekends. She covered several different positions. Neither Hannan nor Clark was involved in the\nalleged May 27, 2001, strip search as participants or directors or supervisors. Hannan and Clark assert that they\nwere unaware of any deviation from the established policy with the sole exception of Wood's allegation with\nrespect to the alleged May 27, 2001, strip search. (Hannan Aff. ¶ 5; Clark Aff. ¶ 5.) They had no passive\nknowledge of the May 27, 2001, search at the time of the search. They first became aware of the search in the\n[6]\nlate summer/early fall of 2001, as a consequence of communications with Wood's counsel.\n[7] [8]\nA \"contact visit\" is a visit during which \"any\"  physical contact between the inmate and the visitor is permitted.\nThe Hancock County Jail has a policy that requires strip searches following contact visits and this policy is\nspecifically set forth in the Hancock County Jail Policy and Procedure Manual in the form of Policy No. F-150. All\ncivilians, including attorneys, are subject to electronic search and must leave their property in a locker prior to\nentering the Hancock County Jail. The room in which the inmates are allowed contact visits has windows on two\nsides so that visits can be monitored by jail staff. According to policy, jail staff members are required to monitor\nvisits, including visits with attorneys, in a manner that reasonably insures the privacy of both the inmate and the\nvisitor without compromising the safety and security of the facility. However, the jail does not visually monitor\nvisits between an inmate and his or her attorney and, because of staff shortages, cannot visually monitor every\ncontact visit.\nThe reason that a strip and visual body cavity search follows contact visits is to protect and maintain institutional\n[9]\nsecurity at the jail and to provide a safe environment for inmates and jail staff.  One concern behind the policy is\nto prevent the admission of contraband into the jail. Hannan considers any item not provided to an inmate\nthrough the jail to be contraband, regardless of the list of allowed items in the inmate handbook. As jail\nadministrator Hannan has had no personal experience with contraband being brought into the jail and transferred\n237 to inmates by *237 individuals other than family members and friends. Hannan describes only two occasions in\nthe State of Maine in which there was an attempt to introduce contraband into a county jail in a body cavity.\nThere are no jail records for May 27 through 28 nor July 10 through 11 that indicate that Wood was searched.\nThere is no evidence that any jail employee harbored an individual reasonable suspicion that Wood was\nconcealing contraband at the time of his May and July detentions.\n[10]\nEach inmate receives the inmate handbook when booked.  Wood acknowledged receiving, reading, and\nunderstanding all the rules and regulations in the inmate handbook at the time of his May 27, 2001, and his July\n10, 2001, admissions. (DSMF Exs. C & D.) Wood states that he signed the form which included the\nacknowledgment that he read the inmate handbook with a corrections officer and was required to do so as part of\nthe booking process. However, he did not receive or review the handbook, with or without a corrections officer,\n\nuntil after he signed the form. (Wood Aff. ¶ 16.) It is standard procedure that an arrestee does not have an\nopportunity to look at the inmate handbook until after they have been placed in their housing cell and no one from\nthe jail goes over the handbook with the arrestee. (Hannan Dep. p. 14, lines 23-25; p. 15, lines 1-14.)\nThe Constitutionality of the Strip Searches\nWith respect to the July search triggered by the contact visit Wood is attacking the official policy promulgated by\nHannan and approved by Clark. \"Local governing bodies ... can be sued directly under [42 U.S.C] § 1983 for\nmonetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional\nimplements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated\nby that body's officers.\" Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Servs. N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611\n(1978)\n(footnote omitted). With regards to the alleged searches in May and July that occurred after Wood's arrest, Wood\nprecedes on a theory that these searches were made pursuant to a \"custom\" that was not formalized as a policy. \nId. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018 (\"[Although the touchstone of the § 1983 action against a government body is an\nallegation that official policy is responsible for a deprivation of rights protected by the Constitution, local\ngovernments, like every other § 1983 `person,' by the very terms of the statute, may be sued for constitutional\ndeprivations visited pursuant to governmental `custom' even though such a custom has not received formal\napproval through the body's official decisionmaking channels.\"). Because Wood is suing Hannan and Clark in\ntheir official capacities the suit against them is identical to the suit against Hancock County. Brandon v. Holt, 469\nU.S. 464, 105 S.Ct. 873, 83 L.Ed.2d 878 (1985); see also Wilson v. Brown, 889 F.2d 1195, 1197 (1st Cir.1989)\n(\"Obviously, state officials literally are persons. But a suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not\na suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official's office,\" citing Brandon).\n[11]\nWood must meet two requirements to maintain a § 1983  claim of an unconstitutional municipal custom or\npractice:\n238 *238 First, the custom or practice must be attributable to the municipality, i.e., it must be \"so well\nsettled and widespread that the policymaking officials of the municipality can be said to have\neither actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice.\" Bordanaro v.\nMcLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1156 (1st Cir.1989). Second, the custom must have been the cause of\nand \"the moving force\" behind the deprivation of constitutional rights. Id. at 1157.\nMiller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.2000). This dispute does not generate a concern about the\nsecond part of this inquiry, in that if there is a custom or practice that calls for impermissible strip searches, then\nthe custom must have been the cause of and \"the moving force\" behind the deprivation of constitutional rights. \nSee id. at 13.\nA. The Post-contact-visit Searches\nUnquestionably the United States Supreme Court's decision Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979) is the jumping off point for the Fourth Amendment analysis of the postcontact-visit search\npolicy. Rejecting the lower court's insistence on a showing of probable cause, the majority concluded in Wolfish\nthat a policy common to all Bureau of Prison facilities requiring strip searches with visual body cavity inspections\nafter every contact visit did not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches. 441\nU.S. at 558-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The defendants assert that the Hancock County Jail's policy of strip searching\ninmates after a contact visit is per se constitutional under Wolfish.\nThe First Circuit has addressed strip search policies in a series of cases post-Wolfish and in doing so has made it\nclear that it reads Wolfish to require an application of a balancing test on a case-by-case basis. See, e.g., \n[12]\nRoberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 109-13 (1st Cir.2001); Miller, 219 F.3d at 12-13; Swain v. Spinney, 117\nF.3d 1, 5-9 (1st Cir.1997); Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 886-88 (1st Cir.1983); see also Mary Beth G. v. City of\nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983) (\"We have observed previously that the balancing test prescribed in \n\nWolfish does not validate strip searches in detention settings per se. Although the majority in Wolfish did uphold\nthe strip searches conducted there on less than probable cause, the detainees were awaiting trial on serious\nfederal charges after having failed to make bond and were being searched after contact visits,\" citations\nomitted.).\nIn Wolfish the Court explained the balancing test as follows:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical\napplication. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\npersonal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in\n239 which it is conducted, *239 the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\n441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861.\nBlinded by their assumption that the jail's post-contact visit strip search policy is per se constitutional under \nWolfish, the defendants have not set forth sufficient facts pursuant to which I can recommend granting judgment\nin their favor. They state that the policy is aimed at protecting and maintaining institutional security at the jail and\nproviding a safe environment for inmates and jail staff. They also state that one concern behind the policy is to\nprevent the admission of contraband into the jail.\nHowever, there is no evidence before me about the inmate population at the Hancock County Jail, see, e.g., \nArruda, 710 F.2d at 887 (emphasizing the relative security needs of the institution, noting that the institution\nbefore it was a maximum security facility); the facility's experience with contraband being passed during contact\nvisits in general, compare Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112 & n. 6 (finding evidence of a history of contraband problems\nbut a lack of a record of instances where a body cavity search was necessary to discover the contraband) with \nArruda, 710 F.2d at 888 (noting that the record demonstrated a lengthy history of contraband problems in the\ninstitution), let alone contact visits with attorneys; how the facility is structured in terms of the intermingling of\ninmates and the ease of passing contraband after a contact visit and whether Wood, in particular, was housed in\na volatile area with access to other inmates, compare Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111 (emphasizing that the plaintiff,\nwhile housed in a maximum security facility, was not himself particularly dangerous in holding that the policy\nrequiring a strip/body cavity search of all inmates upon admission did not pass constitutional muster) with Arruda,\n710 F.2d at 887-88 (upholding constitutionality of post-contact-visit strip policy as applied to a plaintiff in a special\nsecurity area00\"a prison within a prison\"00designed to hold the most dangerous inmates); what types of\n97 97\ncontraband might be smuggled and hidden in the various areas of the bodies that are searched, Wolfish, 441\nU.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (noting that inmate attempts to secrete money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband\nwere documented in the record before it). There is evidence that Hannan knows of only two incidents in the entire\nState involving the smuggling of contraband in body cavities. Also, the jail performs a security check of the\nincoming visitors and the contact visits at the jail can be monitored if staff were committed to that practice; these\nalternatives to the strip search practice may well come into play in making the reasonableness determination. \nSee Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559 n. 40, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (\"assuming\" without deciding \"that the existence of less\nintrusive alternatives is relevant to the determination of the reasonableness of the particular search method at\nissue\"); Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112 (noting that there were less invasive, less constitutionally problematic ways to\nconduct searches than via strip/ body cavity procedure). Additionally, it is uncontroverted on this record that\nWood was not given the choice of having a noncontact-visit with his attorney.\nI conclude that the defendants have not generated a summary judgment record sufficient to undertake the\nanalysis of the post-contact-visit strip search policy under Wolfish and the First Circuit's post-Wolfish precedents\non point. I am cognizant that the First Circuit has commended a thoroughgoing factual inquiry in making a\nreasonableness determination vis-à-vis post-contact visit strip searches. See Arruda, 710 F.2d at 886, 888.\n240 Therefore I conclude that the defendants are not entitled *240 to judgment at this juncture and recommend that\nthe Court DENY them summary judgment on this ground.\n\nB. The Searches Incident to the Arrests\nMuch of the discussion above is applicable to the question of the constitutionality of strip and body cavity\nsearches following an arrest. In brief, it is clear that a strip and visual body cavity search of an arrestee comports\nwith the Fourth Amendment only if it is \"justified by at least a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing\ncontraband or weapons.\" Swain, 117 F.3d at 5, 7. These searches cannot be used as a device to humiliate,\ndegrade, or retaliate against an arrestee. Id. at 8-9.\nThe defendants do not challenge this proposition or suggest that there was reasonable suspicion vis-a-vis Wood\nat the time of his two admissions to the jail. With respect to Wood's alleged searches in the aftermath of his two\nbookings, the defendants argue that they were rogue events, to which they were not a party and which were not\nattributable to any policy or custom.\nNot having named the individual officers involved in these searches as defendants Wood skates on thin ice with\nrespect to carrying his summary judgment burden. Wilson v. Town of Mendon, 294 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2002)\n(concluding that \"in principle\" the failure to name the constitutional tortfeasor was not fatal to a § 1983 case\nagainst a municipality but warning that once the plaintiff chooses this strategy the plaintiff must live with the\nevidentiary consequences). For, Wood must demonstrate that there is a genuine dispute of facts material to his\nclaim that there is a \"custom\" at the jail to strip search misdemeanant arrestees without a reasonable suspicion\nthat the arrestee harbored contraband and that he was searched and his constitutional rights were violated by the\nnondefendant officers who conducted the search. And, to reiterate, this must be a custom \"so well settled and\nwidespread that the policymaking officials of the municipality,\" here Hannan and Clark, \"can be said to have\neither actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice.\" Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1156.\nWood's evidence on this score is that three different corrections officers on two different occasions subjected him\nto a strip search and on one of these occasions subjected him to a visual body cavity search. Vis-à-vis the May\n[13]\nsearch Wood claims one of the officers indicated that these searches were \"routine practice\"  and Wood was\ntold by one of the officers that the shower and search could be done \"the easy way or the hard way.\" Wood also\npoints to the policies of the jail arguing that policy C120 required non-bailed arrestees to undergo a shower as\npart of the admission process and that the definition of the shower process is not much different from that of the\nstrip search. He reports that on both occasions that he underwent the shower procedure he was subjected to a\nvisual inspection of his body and the only difference between these procedures and a visual body cavity search is\nthat during the latter the detainee must bend over and spread his or her buttocks.\n241 *241 There is also evidence that Hannan was aware that the policies that she promulgated with respect to\nbooking and searches were not being followed to the letter. She admits that arrestees are routinely told to sign\nthe acknowledgement of, among other things, having read the handbook with a corrections officer before they\nreceived or read the handbook. She also admits that the fact that Wood was not searched after his first contact\nvisit with his attorney was in contravention to the policy, as was the fact that they were not monitored.\nFurthermore, during one of Wood's post-admission procedures he was not monitored by the corrections officers,\nin contravention to the showering policy. Also implicit in this record is a noncompliance with the recording\nrequirements for strip searches, as the defendants admit that the postarrest searches were something more than\na clothing inspection but were recorded as limited to that procedure.\nThe First Circuit has at least twice indicated that a plaintiffs own experience of being strip searched is probative\nthat there is an existent practice. Miller, 219 F.3d at 12 (emphasizing that the plaintiffs own experience being strip\nsearched is undisputed by defendant/county on summary judgment, citing Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1156); \nBordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1156 (\"Additional support for the existence of such a practice can be inferred from the\nevent itself.\"); but see Swain, 117 F.3d at 11 (addressing a failure to train claim brought by strip searched\narrestees, observing that \"absent prior claim, it cannot be reasonably inferred,\" that the defendant police chief,\n\"knew, or should have known, that his officers were not executing that policy\"). And though it is undisputed that\nno instructions or directives are given to jail staff regarding strip searches of misdemeanor pre-trial detainees and\narrestees that are in any way inconsistent with the contents of Policy D-220, there is sufficient evidence to infer\n\nthat there may be a practice of strip searching these arrestees in conjunction with the admission shower that is\ndone outside the letter of the policies. A jury could infer that the practice at the jail is to conflate the strip search\nprocedure with the shower procedure and that this is such a wide-spread practice that Hannan and Clark knew or\nshould have known that it was occurring. Therefore, I recommend that the Court DENY the defendant's motion as\nto the post-arrest strip search allegations.\nConclusion\nAs discussed above, I DENY the defendants' motion to strike. With respect to the defendants' motion for\nsummary judgment I recommend that the Court DENY their motion for judgment on the pleadings and DENY\ntheir motion for summary judgment\nNOTICE\nA party may file objections to those specified portions of a magistrate judge's report or proposed\nfindings or recommended decisions entered pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) for which de\nnovo review by the district court is sought, together with a supporting memorandum, within ten\n(10) days of being served with a copy thereof. A responsive memorandum shall be filed within ten\n(10) days after the filing of the objection.\nFailure to file a timely objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to de novo review by the\ndistrict court and to appeal the district court's order.\nJanuary 7, 2003.\n[1] Wood's claims under the Fifth and Sixth Amendment are not addressed by either side. I have analyzed the\ncase as a Fourth/Fourteenth Amendment case, as have they.\n[2] The defendants want the court to strike Wood's Statement of Material Fact ¶ 22 which states \"The search\"\ndescribed in ¶ 21 is \"routine procedure\" and the supporting ¶ 8 in the Wood Affidavit which states: \"Prior to this\nstrip search, upon questioning the corrections officers as to why I had to submit to this search, they indicated that\nit was `routine procedure.'\" I agree with defendants that the conclusory ¶ 22 in Wood's Statement of Material Fact\nfinds slim support in ¶ 8 of the Wood affidavit, which contains a representation that is quit different from the\nversion of the searching officers' conduct that was given during his deposition.Whether his affidavit is so\ninconsistent with his deposition testimony as to be stricken is debatable.However, since in the final analysis, I do\nnot believe that whether or not an unidentified officer said that the search was \"routine procedure\" is dispositive\nof this motion, I have not stricken the affirmation.\n[3] The defendants assert that this search is immaterial because Wood is challenging the search on July 11 not\nJuly 10. However, Wood did include this search in his complaint (Compl.¶ 14) and it is relevant to whether there\nwas an unwritten policy and procedure to conduct strip searches on misdemeanor detainees.\n[4] The defendants explain that by policy there should have been a strip search following the first visit with the\nattorney also and that Hannan \"spoke with jail staff\" after learning that there was no such search.\n[5] Based on Hannan's deposition testimony, Wood complains that Hannan is unable to answer questions\nconcerning what the policies applicable to strip searches state without consulting the written policies. (Hannan\nDep. at 48-49.) Without providing record citation, the defendants retort that Hannan did not want to answer the\nquestion under oath without first looking up the policy. This peevish dispute is not determinative of this motion.\n[6] One target of the defendants' motion to strike is Wood's attempt to qualify this assertion by stating that his\nattorney first learned of the May 27, 2001, related allegations via a July 20, 2001, Freedom of Access request.\n(PSMF Ex. A.) I fail to see the materiality of this qualification unless Wood is trying to argue that Hannan and/or\nClark should have learned of the May 27, 2001 search at some earlier time based upon jail records provided by\nway of the Freedom of Access request. But the record does not reveal that the May 27 booking report contains\nany evidence of a strip search, so I remain unconvinced that this qualification serves any purpose.\n\n[7] The defendants picked this term \"any.\" I am sure there are some limitations on what type of contact is\npermitted.\n[8] Wood asserts that a \"contact visit\" is a visit where there is no plexi-glass between the parties. However, I\ncould not find adequate support for this qualification in the cited Hannan deposition exhibits. (Hannan Dep. Exs. 6\n& 8.)\n[9] Again, in his reply statement of facts Wood simply denies this statement without referring to any record\ncitation. In his response to the motion to strike he states this denial is further amplified by his Statement of\nMaterial Fact H 42. That being the case I address the latter, this denial being redundant.\n[10] In his reply statement of facts Wood simply denies this statement without referring to any record citation and\nin response to the motion to strike he provides no reason why his denial should be countenanced.\n[11] Section 1983 of title 42 provides are relevant: \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or\nthe District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person\nwithin the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution\nand laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for\nredress[.]\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n[12]Miller does not directly mention Wolfish but analyzes strip searches to determine if they were \"justified by a\nreasonable suspicion\" under Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997), a case applying Wolfish.\n[13] Again, this statement has been challenged by defendants as inconsistent with Wood's deposition testimony.\nEven if the statement were stricken, the facts and circumstances attendant to the two separate searches, when\nviewed in the light most favorable to Wood, could give rise to the inference that Hannan and Clark knew or\nshould have known of the \"custom\" of subjecting all arrestees to strip searches without regard for reasonable\nsuspicion standards.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Marchesi with whom Wheeler & Arey, P.A., was on brief for appellees.\nBefore SELYA, Circuit Judge, COFFIN and STAHL, Senior Circuit Judges.\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.\nAppellant Geoffrey Wood claims that he was unconstitutionally strip searched on three separate occasions by\ncorrectional officers at the Hancock County Jail in Ellsworth, Maine. He filed a lawsuit seeking damages under 42\n[1]\nU.S.C. § 1983 from the county, the sheriff, and the jail administrator, but a jury found in favor of the defendants.\n59 On appeal, Wood contends *59 that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court incorrectly instructed\nthe jury on both the definition of a strip search and the law governing routine strip searches of inmates after\ncontact visits. We see no error as to the law applicable to post-contact visits, but have concluded that a\nsufficiently misleading definition of a strip search warrants a partial new trial.\nI. Factual Background\nIn mid-2001, appellant Wood was arrested twice on misdemeanor charges and required to completely disrobe\nthree times in the presence of correctional officers. The first two episodes occurred as part of his processing into\nthe Hancock County Jail following the arrests. Although Wood characterizes these events as strip searches, the\ncounty defendants maintain that the encounters were \"clothing searches\" and that any observation of Wood's\nnaked body was incidental to the correctional officers' purpose to examine his clothing. The third search occurred\non the morning after Wood's second arrest, following a contact visit with his attorney. The parties agree that\nWood was subjected to a strip search at that time, but disagree about its constitutionality.\nThe details of these three incidents, with the facts largely depicted in the light most consistent with the jury's\nverdict, are described below. Before turning to those details, we briefly review the jail's relevant search policies.\nAccording to Policy No. C-120, titled \"Admissions Procedures 00 Inmates Not Bailed,\" an individual who is being\n97\nassigned to a housing unit in the jail 00 whether charged with a misdemeanor or felony 00 is subject to a clothing\n97 97\nsearch and must shower after disrobing \"in the presence of [a] Corrections Officer.\" Jail Policy D-220 (Procedure\nC(1)), titled \"Search Procedures,\" states that a pre-trial inmate charged with a misdemeanor offense 00 like\n97\nappellant 00 is subject to a more intrusive strip search only if the officer \"has reasonable suspicion that [the]\n97\ninmate is concealing contraband and is about to come into contact with inmates of the facility.\"\n[2]\nA \"clothing search\" is defined as \"[t]he removal and search of all of an inmate's clothing,\"  while a \"strip search\"\nis defined as \"[a] visual search of an inmate which requires the removal of all clothing, to include a search of the\n60 clothes removed.\" Policy D-220.[3] Thus, individuals *60 arrested for a broad range of minor offenses classified\nas misdemeanors, including failure to pay highway tolls or speeding, could be asked to disrobe completely and\n\nshower if they are unable to post bail and must be assigned housing. Only felony detainees and those suspected\nof carrying contraband are subject to the more extensive examination that the policy describes as a \"strip\nsearch.\"\nSearch # 1. On May 27, 2001, Wood was arrested on misdemeanor charges of domestic abuse and taken to the\nHancock County Jail. He did not immediately post bail and therefore was required to shower and undergo a\nclothing search. He was escorted by a correctional officer into a room near the booking area known as \"the\nnurse's station\" or \"medical room\" and directed to disrobe, one article of clothing at a time, until he was naked.\nHe was standing four to five feet from the officer. Wood contends that two officers were present, but jail records\nindicate that only Officer Christopher Rivers supervised the search and shower.\nOfficer Rivers testified that his standard practice in clothing searches is to instruct the inmates to turn over their\nunderwear last and then to enter the nearby shower stall. Although Rivers said the objective of the search is to\ndetect contraband in the clothing, he and a fellow officer, Chad Wilmot, both testified that they \"maintain a visual\"\non the individuals as they disrobe and enter the shower. Rivers stated that, during the process, the inmates end\nup standing naked for \"[s]econds,\" and Wilmot noted that \"[w]e're not physically inspecting them, having them\nraise their arms or anything like that, and we're also bringing clothes and a towel so that they can dry off and\n[4]\nchange up when they get out of the shower.\"\nThe jail's administrator, Linda Hannan, testified that the corrections staff attempts to provide as much privacy as\n[5]\npossible in the circumstances.  She said that the shower curtain, which was admitted into evidence, is black\nfrom about shoulder height down, and she further stated that the officers are trained to avert their eyes from the\ninmate during the clothing search. She acknowledged that officers might observe the inmate's naked body \"for a\nsplit second as [they] reach for that last piece of clothing.\" Hannan's depiction of the policy departed somewhat\nfrom the two officers' consistent report that they were trained to maintain eye contact with the inmate and that\nthey were not trained to look away because \"that would be an officer safety issue.\"\nSearch # 2. Wood was arrested again on July 10 and charged with violating a protection from abuse order. He\n61 again was brought to the Hancock County Jail *61 and searched in similar fashion to the May occurrence.[6] He\nremained at the jail overnight.\nSearch # 3. On the morning of July 11, appellant was twice visited by his attorney. Both encounters were\n\"contact\" visits, meaning that counsel and client were face-to-face without a glass partition or other divider\n[7]\nseparating them. Although jail policy calls for inmates to be strip searched after all contact visits,  appellant was\nnot searched after the first session with his counsel. After the second, longer visit, however, as appellant and his\ncounsel passed through the booking area, the booking officer stated that appellant needed to be strip searched\npursuant to jail policy. He was taken into the same room where the previous searches had been conducted, and\na full strip search was done. He was asked to fully disrobe, and then was ordered to stick out his tongue, hold his\nhands above his head, turn around, bend over, and manually spread his buttocks.\nAppellant contends that all three of these searches violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from\nunreasonable searches and that the jury was led to conclude otherwise by the trial court's erroneous instructions.\nWith respect to the first two searches, appellant argues that, despite being labeled \"clothing searches,\" they\neffectively were strip searches. The parties agree that the search constitutes a Fourth Amendment violation if it\nwas indeed a strip search. See infra at 62. Appellant asserts that the jury was led astray because the court's\ninstruction improperly limited the definition of a strip search. See infra at 62. He claims that the instruction\nconcerning the third search 00 undisputedly a strip search 00 erroneously established a presumption of\n97 97\nreasonableness regarding strip searches after contact visits. See infra at 66-67.\nDefendants assert in response that the court's instructions accurately reflected the law and that the jurors\nproperly found no constitutional violation. They insist that the May 27th and July 10th searches were carefully\nlimited clothing searches, not strip searches, and as such involved permissible incidental viewing of appellant's\nnaked body. In any event, they say, the label given to the first two searches is unimportant because the jury's\nverdict is supportable even if appellant were subjected to unlawful strip searches. They assert that the verdict\nform may be interpreted to reflect a judgment that the defendants 00 the county and its supervising officials 00\n97 97\n\nwere not liable for the officers' conduct because the officers' actions did not represent a widespread practice or\ncustom. See Monell v. New York Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)\n; Miller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8, 12-13 (1st Cir.2000). Finally, defendants assert that the July 11th strip\nsearch was \"wholly constitutional\" and that the court's instruction correctly set out the law governing routine strip\nsearches following contact visits.\nFor the reasons discussed below, we conclude that appellant is entitled to a new trial on the claims related to the\nMay 27th and July 10th searches, but we uphold the jury's judgment on the July 11th strip search.\n62  II. Discussion\n*62\nA jury instruction that was objected to at trial will constitute reversible error \"`only if it (i) is \"misleading, unduly\ncomplicating, or incorrect as a matter of law\"; and (ii) cannot be considered harmless....'\" Richards v. Relentless,\nInc., 341 F.3d 35, 46 (1st Cir.2003) (citations omitted). In probing whether the error could have affected the\noutcome of the jury's deliberations, we consider its impact in light of the entire record. See Tum v. Barber Foods,\nInc., 331 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2003) (citing Federico v. Order of St. Benedict, 64 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1995) and Allen v.\nChance Mfg. Co., 873 F.2d 465, 469 (1st Cir.1989)).\nWith this guidance in mind, we consider in turn each of the challenged instructions.\nA. Definition of Strip Search\nThe district court defined a strip search to the jury as follows:\nA strip search involves a deliberate, visual inspection of the naked body of a prisoner which\nincludes the examination of the mouth and armpits. A visual body-cavity search is a strip search\nthat includes visual inspection or visual examination of the anal and genital areas.\nAppellant objected to this instruction and proposed an alternative to the court that more broadly defined such a\n[8]\nsearch, essentially classifying any required exposure of a private body part as a strip search.\nThe definition of a strip search was crucial to appellant's case. Our case law holds that an individual detained on\na misdemeanor charge may be strip searched as part of the booking process only if officers have reasonable\nsuspicion that he is either armed or carrying contraband. See Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 27 (1st\nCir.2003) (en banc) (opinion of Selya, J.), petition for cert. filed, 72 U.S.L.W. 3348 (U.S. Nov. 3, 2003) (No.\n03-683); Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 113 (1st Cir.2001). In so concluding, we have recognized that\n\"strip searches are intrusive and degrading []and, therefore, should not be unreservedly available to law\nenforcement officers[].\" Savard, 338 F.3d at 27. When such an intrusion is extended to relatively harmless\noffenders, \"a severe incursion on privacy\" occurs, Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111.\nIn Savard, for example, one of the strip-searched plaintiffs had been arrested for a traffic ticket that had been\nissued to his son six years earlier and never paid; another was arrested in error for failing to appear for a\nprobation review after her probation had ended. See338 F.3d at 33 (opinion of Bownes, J.). Requiring\nparticularized suspicion to strip search misdemeanant arrestees balances institutional security needs with\nindividual privacy, which includes \"a reasonable expectation not to be unclothed involuntarily, to be observed\nunclothed or to have [one's] `private' parts observed or touched by others.\" Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961\nF.2d 188, 191 (11th Cir.1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). There is no dispute that Wood was\nnot suspected of carrying a weapon or contraband either time he was arrested and booked. Thus, if he was strip\nsearched, he suffered a constitutional injury.\n63 Having carefully reviewed the relevant precedent, we believe the court's instruction *63 erroneously\ncircumscribed the jury's evaluation of the evidence. Nearly twenty years ago, we defined a strip search as \"an\ninspection of a naked individual, without any scrutiny of the subject's body cavities,\" Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d\n[9]\n556, 561 (1st Cir.1985),  and we repeated substantially that same description in subsequent cases. See \n\nSavard, 338 F.3d at 25 (defining strip searches as \"visual inspections of the naked body\"); Roberts, 239 F.3d at\n108 n. 1 (\"A `strip search' involves a visual inspection of the naked body of an inmate.\"). See also Peckham v.\nWisconsin Dep't of Corrections, 141 F.3d 694, 695 (7th Cir.1998) (\"strip search\" refers to \"a visual inspection of a\n[10]\nnaked inmate without intrusion into the person's body cavities\").  The district court departed from these\nformulations by defining a strip search to include an \"examination of the mouth and armpits,\" and by stating that\nthe inspection must be \"deliberate.\" Although strip searches often may involve additional steps, we decline to\ndraw the line so narrowly that standing naked for inspection by officers falls short of being a strip search if\nunaccompanied by a demand to open one's mouth or lift one's arms. Unquestionably, the serious intrusion stems\nfrom exposing one's naked body to official scrutiny; the impact of that forced nudity is undervalued if focused\nattention on the mouth and underarms is also required to reach the threshold of a strip search.\nUnder the court's instruction, the most deliberate visual inspection of a naked body, even including a look in the\nmouth, would pass muster, simply because one or two armpits were not inspected. Alternatively, a complete and\nprolonged viewing of a naked body could survive challenge if a jury were to find that it was not sufficiently\n\"deliberate\" because it was designed to examine clothing rather than the body.\nThe court's instruction was therefore flawed in two respects. By adding the word \"deliberate\" to the definition we\npreviously have adopted-stating in the first portion of its instruction that \"[a] strip search involves a deliberate,\nvisual inspection of the naked body of a prisoner\"-the court unduly directed the jurors to the officers' subjective\nintent. The word \"inspection\" sufficiently connotes the need for a focused look. See The Random House\nDictionary of the English Language (2d ed.1987) (unabridged) at 987 (defining \"inspection\" as \"the act of\ninspecting or viewing, esp. carefully or critically ...,\" and, alternatively, as \"formal or official viewing or\n64 examination\").[11] Whether or not the *64 officers set out deliberately to inspect a prisoner's naked body is not\nthe question; it is, rather, whether the officers did, in fact, perform such a search. The remainder of the instruction\nthen added specific elements to the definition 00 scrutiny of the mouth and armpits 00 that are not prerequisites for\n97 97\nfinding that a strip search took place.\n[12]\nThese variations cannot be considered harmless in this case.  Although the jury may not have based its\njudgment for defendants on the scope of the searches 00 an issue we discuss infra at 16 00 the problems with the\n97 97\ninstruction were sufficiently critical to the jury's deliberations that appellant is entitled to have the issue re-\nsubmitted to a jury. We begin our explanation of that conclusion with a brief review of the evidence of what\noccurred.\nAppellant testified that he was subjected to examinations that met the district court's definition of a strip search,\nincluding scrutiny of his mouth and armpits, see supra notes 4 & 6, while the officers testified that the only\nviewing of appellant's naked body occurred in the few seconds after he had completely disrobed while they\n\"maintain[ed] a visual\" on him before he entered the shower. Defendants emphasize that, even if the jurors had\naccepted appellant's version, the jury properly may have found no liability against the county.\nAs first set forth by the Supreme Court in Monell, a governmental entity may not be held liable under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983 for constitutional violations committed by its employees unless the plaintiff's injury results from either an\nofficially sanctioned policy or from a custom or practice that is \"so well-settled and widespread that the\npolicymaking officials ... can be said to have either actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end\nthe practice,\" Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1156 (1st Cir.1989). In the latter case, \"the custom must\nhave been the cause of and the moving force behind the deprivation of constitutional rights.\" Id.; see also Miller,\n219 F.3d at 12. Thus, in rejecting liability, the jury may have believed appellant but concluded that the officers\nacted randomly beyond the jail's policies.\n65 *65 Another possibility, however, is that the jury believed the officers' description of what occurred and concluded-\nconsistent with the jury instruction-that these were not strip searches because there was no check of appellant's\nmouth or underarms. Such a conclusion would have made unnecessary any further discussion about the specific\nnature of the search and whether the visual observation of appellant constituted an \"inspection\" that would qualify\nas a strip search.\n\nIn our view, if the jury had had such a discussion, with the benefit of the correct definition of \"strip search,\" it could\nhave reached a different result. Both officers testified that appellant was under constant watch as he disrobed. \nSee supra at 60. Officer Wilmot stated that the officers are \"physically inspecting the clothes, not the person,\" but\nhe replied affirmatively when asked by counsel if the process necessarily included \"maintain[ing] a visual of their\nbody while they're in the process of disrobing.\" In addition, while Administrator Hannan stated that the only target\nof the search was appellant's clothing, she acknowledged that officers conducting clothing searches must at least\nobserve inmates \"out of the corner of [their] eye[s]\" to be sure the prisoners do not take contraband from their\nclothing and hide it on their persons. She explained that the concern about concealment is why disrobing for a\nclothing search must be done in an officer's presence rather than behind a screen or in another private area.\nBased on this evidence, a properly instructed jury could have decided that both clothing searches performed on\nappellant embraced a visual inspection of his naked body that 00 albeit brief 00 was focused on detecting\n97 97\ncontraband, and thus amounted to a strip search. Our precedent does not require that a search be either\nprolonged or thorough to be termed a strip search, and we decline to add such limitations. The critical question is\nwhether viewing the naked body was an objective of the search, rather than an unavoidable and incidental by-\nproduct. Had appellant been allowed to disrobe behind a screen, for example, and directed to enter the shower\nwhile officers examined the clothes he left behind, the momentary exposure as he walked from the screen to the\nshower clearly would have been incidental to the search of his clothing. By contrast, the procedure utilized by the\nHancock County Jail in this case, as described by the officers, allowed visual inspection of appellant's body\nthrough the progressive stages of his undressing. Indeed, the combined effect of Administrator Hannan's and the\nofficers' testimony permits 00 although it does not compel 00 the inference that, during clothing searches, officers\n97 97\nroutinely keep watch through the disrobing process, at least in part, to be sure no items are secreted on the body.\n[13]\nAlthough less objectionable than more sustained inspections of an individual's naked body, and less intrusive\n66 than a search that includes examination of the mouth and underarms, the search that occurred *66 here\nunquestionably implicated the \"reasonable expectation not to be unclothed involuntarily,\" Justice, 961 F.2d at 191\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Appellant is entitled to have a properly instructed jury decide\nwhether it crossed the line from incidental observation to impermissible inspection.\nHaving determined that the erroneous instruction could have impacted the jury's verdict, we reject defendants'\nfallback contention that such error should not lead to a new trial because the jury's judgment may have signaled\na determination that the searches 00 lawful or not 00 did not stem from a widespread practice or custom\n97 97\n[14]\nattributable to the defendants.  That possibility is not enough, however, to avoid retrial. Appellant is entitled to\na new trial unless the error, which was preserved by objection, can be deemed harmless. On this record, we\ncannot say that the jurors probably would have found the defendants blameless if they found that a constitutional\nviolation occurred.\nThe record contains adequate evidence to permit a jury to conclude that appellant's experience was typical of\nclothing searches at the Hancock County Jail. First, appellant testified that when he asked on May 27th at the\noutset of the search why he needed to take off his clothes, he was told it was \"routine procedure.\" Second,\nOfficer Rivers, after testifying that memos are generated on searches only when circumstances require multiple\nofficers to participate, stated that no memo was prepared on the May 27th search because \"[i]t was a routine\nsearch to me.\" Third, the fact that appellant himself experienced two separate searches conducted similarly by\ntwo different officers, on two different dates, further suggests a standard practice. Finally, the jurors could have\nviewed the standard clothing search as described by Administrator Hannan to include at least a brief inspection of\ninmates' naked bodies. On that basis 00 and with the correct definition of a strip search in mind 00 the jury may\n97 97\nhave found official knowledge of a practice of strip searching misdemeanants.\nIn so concluding, we hasten to add that the defendants' assertions to the contrary do not indicate an attempt to\nmislead. The labels applied to searches do not always reflect a common understanding of the procedures that\nwill be utilized. Although the Hancock County Jail officers disclaimed doing strip searches, for example, their\nunderstanding of what such a search entails is informed by the jail's policy. And, while the strip search definition\ncontained in Policy D-220 is consistent with our precedent 00 \"[a] visual search of an inmate which requires the\n97\n\nremoval of all clothing, to include a search of the clothes removed\" 00 the detailed procedures spelled out for a\n97\nstrip search have the effect of narrowing the scope of the definition by requiring particularized scrutiny of certain\n[15]\nbody parts. See note 3 supra.  Thus, a jury could find that defendants truthfully denied conducting strip\nsearches, within their understanding of what that entailed, but nonetheless committed a constitutional violation by\ninspecting appellant's body in a manner that federal law would deem a strip search.\n67 We therefore conclude that appellant is entitled to a new trial on his claims of *67 constitutional injury arising from\nthe searches on May 27th and July 10th.\nB. Instruction on Post-Contact Visit Strip Search\nAppellant's second complaint centers on the court's instruction on the July 11th strip search:\nI'll now discuss with you the alleged July 11th, 2001 postcontact strip-search issue. I instruct you\nthat without more strip-searching all prisoners after all contact visits in order to prevent smuggling\nof contraband is not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\nHowever, plaintiff may present to you additional facts that make the application of a postcontact\nvisit strip-searching policy unreasonable under the circumstances of this case. In the postcontact\nvisit context, a search is reasonable where the need for the search outweighs the resulting\ninvasion of privacy.\nAmong those things you should consider when making this determination are the scope of the\nsearch, the manner in which it was conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place where\nit was conducted. When balancing these interests, keep in mind that the central objective of jail\nadministration is safeguarding institutional security. You should accord deference to the policies\nand practices that jail administrators consider necessary to preserve internal order and discipline.\nRemember, in order to recover, plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his\nstrip search following a contact visit on July 11th, 2001, was unreasonable....\nAppellant argues that this instruction failed to follow the blueprint for evaluating strip searches that the Supreme\nCourt set out in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In considering the\nconstitutionality of a prison's blanket policy of strip searching inmates after contact visits, the Court articulated a\n\"test of reasonableness\" that requires \"a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\npersonal rights that the search entails.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Factors to be weighed are \"the scope of the\nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.\" Id. Applying that test, the Court in Bell upheld the strip searches at issue.\nAppellant's two-pronged argument is, first, that the district court improperly preempted the jury's balancing by\ndirecting it to presume the July 11th search was reasonable, and, second, that the court then unfairly cemented\nthe presumption by advising the jury to defer to jail policies and practices. We conclude that the instruction as\ngiven fairly presented the relevant law.\nWe agree with appellant that the Bell balancing test is the correct starting point for assessing any strip search.\nBut Bell and other cases lead inevitably to the district court's conclusion that it is presumptively reasonable for a\ndetention facility to conduct strip searches after contact visits. In Bell, the Court recognized that all such facilities\nare \"fraught with serious security dangers,\" and that smuggling of drugs, weapons and other contraband \"is all\ntoo common an occurrence,\" id. The Court further observed that the lack of reported cases of smuggling at the\nMetropolitan Correctional Center in New York, the institution at issue in Bell, \"may be more a testament to the\neffectiveness of this search technique as a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmates to\nsecrete and import such items when the opportunity arises,\" id.\n68 *68 The particular risk posed by contact visits is a theme repeated in the case law and substantiated by this\nrecord. In Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 586, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984), the Supreme Court\nmade the following observations in deciding that a detention facility could constitutionally prohibit contact visits:\n\nContact visits invite a host of security problems. They open the institution to the introduction of\ndrugs, weapons, and other contraband. Visitors can easily conceal guns, knives, drugs, or other\ncontraband in countless ways and pass them to an inmate unnoticed by even the most vigilant\nobservers. And these items can readily be slipped from the clothing of an innocent child, or\ntransferred by other visitors permitted close contact with inmates.\nSee also Goff v. Nix, 803 F.2d 358, 364-65 (8th Cir.1986) (\"The record in this case reflects what this Court and\nother courts know and long have acknowledged, namely that weapons, drugs, and other items of contraband are\nserious problems in our nation's prisons. The director of security at [the facility] testified that a substantial portion\nof the contraband at the prison is introduced through contact visitation.\").\nIn this case, both Administrator Hannan and the county's expert witness, William Sturgeon, testified that contact\nvisits are a significant source of contraband in jails, and that seemingly harmless items 00 such as pens and paper\n97\nclips 00 can be transferred innocently and used in harmful ways. Paper clips, for example, can be used to jam and\n97\nopen handcuffs, pick locks, or poke someone. Hannon stated that she was aware of about a dozen occasions\nduring her correctional career when a family member or friend had tried to deliver, or had delivered, contraband\nto an inmate during a contact visit. Although the Hancock County Jail had reported in response to Sturgeon's\ninquiry no instances of contraband being found during a strip search, he-like the Supreme Court 00 observed that\n97\nthe low numbers may be attributable to the deterrent effect of strip search policies.\nViewed from the perspective of our precedent on strip-searching misdemeanor detainees, Bell's teaching is that\nthe widely acknowledged risk posed by contact visits furnishes sufficient suspicion to justify a blanket policy. And,\nguided by Bell, other courts evaluating the constitutionality of strip searches, including our own, have noted the\ndistinctive need to search that arises from contact visits. See, e.g., Roberts, 239 F.3d at 111 (\"Courts have given\nprisons far more leeway in conducting searches of inmates with outside contact than in searching everyone,\nsimply because such visits often allow smuggling of contraband.\"); id. at 113 (\"Both the Supreme Court in Bell\nand this court in Arruda [v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir. 1983)] have suggested that an individualized reasonable\n[16]\nsuspicion is not necessary to search certain groups of inmates, such as those who receive visitors....\"); Shain\nv. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2001) (\"... Bell authorized strip searches after contact visits, where contraband\noften is passed.\"); Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir.1988) (\"Visual body cavity searches\n69 conducted after contact visits as a means of preventing prisoners' possession of weapons and contraband, *69\neven absent probable cause, have been found reasonable by the Supreme Court.\").\nWe thus read Bell to hold that, except in atypical circumstances, a blanket policy of strip searching inmates after\ncontact visits is constitutional. The Court acknowledged that circumstances may occur to render such a search\nunreasonable-\"on occasion a security guard may conduct the search in an abusive fashion\" 00 and its opinion\n97\nemphasizes that such treatment will not be tolerated. 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (\"The searches must be\nconducted in a reasonable manner.\").\nThe challenged instruction accurately reflected this state of the law, advising the jury that strip searching\nappellant following contact visits was permissible unless \"additional facts ... make the application of a postcontact\nvisit strip-searching policy unreasonable under the circumstances of this case.\" Appellant had the opportunity to\nargue that the search at issue here was unreasonable, and did so. Counsel's argument highlighted that the visitor\nwith whom appellant had contact was his lawyer, an unlikely source of contraband. Counsel further urged jurors\nto consider that the jail's history showed an absence of contraband entering through contact visits, that the risks\nwere low because minimum- and maximum-security inmates were housed separately, that appellant was never\noffered the option of a non-contact visit, and that other alternatives were available for detecting contraband.\nThe jury, however, heard testimony that even professionals such as lawyers and counselors may innocently\ntransfer items that seem innocuous but can be used as tools or weapons. The county also responded to\nappellant's other suggestions of unreasonableness; Sturgeon testified, for example, that the alternative of a\n\"correctional pat search\" would involve significant physical contact that inmates may view as more distasteful\nthan a quick visual search. Appellant did not contend that the search procedure itself was unreasonable, and the\nrecord reveals no unusual elements. It was done in a private area, by a single officer of the same gender, and\nwithout physical contact. Also unavailing is appellant's complaint that the jury's consideration of reasonableness\n\nwas compromised because the court invited undue deference to jail administrators. In Bell, the Supreme Court\nexplicitly stated that\n[p]rison administrators ... should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and\nexecution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order\nand discipline and to maintain institutional security.\n441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The instruction largely mirrored this language.\nTo be sure, a more ideal charge could have been crafted. Rather than beginning with the presumption of\nconstitutionality, we think it would have been preferable for the court to start with the general balancing test\narticulated in Bell before going on to say that the Supreme Court has sanctioned strip searches following contact\nvisits so long as they are reasonable. Likewise, to fully inform the jury on the nature of the \"wide-ranging\ndeference\" due to jail administrators, we think an instruction specifically noting its limits would be helpful.\nAppellant's Requested Jury Instruction # 12, drawn from our decision in Roberts, see239 F.3d at 113, is one\npossible example: \"A blanket strip search policy cannot be justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in\naddressing security considerations.\"\nThe instruction as given, however, adequately informed the jury of its task, and we therefore affirm the judgment\n70 for defendants *70 on the post-contact strip search claim.\nIII. Conclusion\nThe overly narrow definition of \"strip search\" contained in the jury instructions improperly limited the jury's\ndeliberations on the nature of the May 27th and July 10th searches. Appellant is therefore entitled to a new trial\non his claims of constitutional injury arising from those searches. The jury charge on the July 11th post-contact\nstrip search accurately reflected the law, however, and we therefore affirm the jury's judgment that no\nconstitutional injury occurred in connection with that search.\nAffirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for a partial new trial. No costs.\n[1] The complaint, whose caption identifies Sheriff William Clark and Administrator Linda Hannan by their titles,\nand the verdict form, which asks for a single judgment against all three defendants, indicate that the individuals\nwere sued only in their official capacities. As such, their liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is indistinguishable from\nthe county's, and our analysis therefore proceeds on the assumption that only governmental liability is at issue. \nSee Brandon v. Holt, 469 U.S. 464, 472 n. 21, 105 S.Ct. 873, 83 L.Ed.2d 878 (1985); Nereida-Gonzalez v.\nTirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 705 (1st Cir.1993).\n[2] The clothing search process is described by Policy D-220 (Procedure K(4)) as follows: \nAs the inmate removes each piece of clothing they will hand it to the officer who will thoroughly check it for\ncontraband. Once all clothing has been checked the inmate will be given back the clothing he/she may retain.\nThe rest of the clothing will be inventoried and placed in the property box assigned to that inmate.\nJail Policy C-120, which covers admissions procedures, also addresses clothing searches. It states, in relevant\npart:\n1. In order to ensure the health, safety and security of the inmates and staff, each inmate being assigned to a\nhousing unit will be required to shower as part of the admissions process. Inmates will disrobe and shower while\nin the presence of the Corrections Officer (same sex) in the shower room located in the medical room.\n2. The Corrections Officer will conduct a search of the inmate[']s clothing and personal effects for contraband and\nvermin as the inmate prepares to shower....\n[3] The strip search process is described by Policy D-220 (Procedure C(5)) as follows: \n\nOnce the inmate has removed all their clothing and handed it to the officer, the officer shall conduct a visual\nsearch of the inmate to include having the inmate shake out their hair, check inside the mouth, ears, nose, their\narm pits, bottoms of their feet, under the scrotum (where applicable), lift their breasts (where applicable) and\nfinally have the inmate bend over, spread their butt cheeks and cough. In addition, the inmate's clothing and\nfootwear shall be searched.\n[4] Contrary to the officers' report, Wood testified that, after he showered and while still naked, he was ordered to\nraise his hands over his head and to turn around completely. He further claimed that he was directed to open his\nmouth and move his tongue around and ordered to bend down, facing away from the officers, and to touch his\ntoes.\n[5] Multiple provisions of Policy D-220 call for sensitivity in implementing searches. Procedure A states that \"[j]ail\nstaff will conduct searches in the least degrading manner possible,\" and Procedures C(4) and K(3) state that strip\nsearches and clothing searches \"shall be conducted in private only by and in the presence of, the minimum\nnumber of officers of the same sex as the inmate, which are necessary to accomplish the search and to maintain\nsecurity and protection.\"\n[6] Appellant testified that he again was further searched after he showered, while naked. He stated that he was\ntold to raise his hands over his head, turn around 360 degrees, open his mouth and move his tongue around, and\nrub his fingers through his hair.\n[7] Policy F-150 on \"Inmate Visiting\" states that \"[a]fter any contact visit, all inmates will be strip searched before\nbeing returned to their housing unit or work area.\"\n[8] Appellant's requested version was as follows: \nA strip search includes any exposure or observation of a portion of a person's body where that person has a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. This specifically includes prisoners who are watched by corrections personnel\nwhile they change from personal clothing into detention clothing.\n[9] We recognized in Blackburn that \"strip search\" is an \"umbrella term\" covering several increasingly intrusive\nprocedures. In addition to the general term, defined as quoted above, we noted that a \"`visual body cavity search'\nextends to visual inspection of the anal and genital areas\" and that a \"`manual body cavity search' includes some\ndegree of touching or probing of body cavities.\" 771 F.2d at 561 n. 3; see also Savard, 338 F.3d at 25 (separately\ndefining \"visual body cavity searches\" as \"inspections of the anal and genital areas.\")\n[10] We recognize that a strip search may occur even when an inmate is not fully disrobed, but this case does not\nrequire us to explore when \"something less than full nudity,\" Stanley v. Henson, 337 F.3d 961, 964 (7th Cir.2003),\nwould constitute a strip search. See, e.g., Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356, 365 & n. 15 (4th Cir.2001) (noting that\nVirginia statutory definition, similar to most states, provides that \"`[s]trip search shall mean having an arrested\nperson remove or arrange some or all of his clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of the genitals, buttocks,\nanus, female breasts, or undergarments of such person'\") (emphasis added and deleted).\n[11] \"Inspect\" is defined as \"to look carefully at or over; view closely and critically,\" as well as \"to view or examine\nformally or officially.\" See The Random House Dictionary, at 987.\n[12] We note that appellant's proposed alternative also was flawed. His version, defining a strip search to include \nany exposure or observation of private body parts, would seem to extend our accepted formulation by including\nincidental viewing of portions of the body. \nThat appellant's request overshot its mark does not nullify his objection to the court's instruction. Although he was\nnot entitled to his request, see Estate of Keatinge v. Biddle, 316 F.3d 7, 17 (1st Cir.2002) (\"A refusal to give a\nparticular instruction constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction was ... correct as a matter of\nsubstantive law ....\"), his objection 00 that the court too narrowly defined a strip search-was stated with sufficient\n97\nspecificity to meet the \"distinctness\" requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P. 51. The Rule provides that, to preserve an\nobjection to an instruction, a party must \"stat[e] distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"\nFed.R.Civ.P. 51(c)(1). Counsel made the following objection:\n\nTo the extent that your definition 00 the court's definition of a strip search involves a ... deliberate ... visual\n97\ninspection and continues on to include the phrase which includes the examination of the mouth and armpits. The\nbasis for the objection is the First Circuit seemingly-it seems to have approved a broader definition of what a strip\nsearch might involve.\nThe court replied, \"Any other objections?\"\nParticularly in light of our longstanding precedent on strip searches, counsel's objection served as adequate\nnotice of appellant's claim of error. Cf. Keatinge, 316 F.3d at 15; Parker v. City of Nashua, 76 F.3d 9, 12 (1st\nCir.1996).\n[13] We note that, to the extent that a behind-a-screen disrobing would be less effective in detecting concealed\nitems, that might simply be an unavoidable consequence of protecting an individual's right to privacy. Our case\nlaw on misdemeanor arrestees effectively holds that, even if the only way to be comprehensive in detecting\ncontraband is to perform a strip search, the government must bear the risk of missing some items. We\nemphasize that we are not holding that \"clothing searches\" must allow private areas for undressing; we simply\nwish to point out that balancing constitutional rights and institutional needs may require that, in situations\npresenting only a remote risk of concealment, we accept less than perfect law enforcement procedures.\n[14] The jury was not asked to consider whether the strip searches stemmed from an official policy, the other \nMonell prong. See supra at 64.\n[15] Indeed, John Hinkley, the Maine Department of Corrections' jail inspector, testified that the state, through\nrules set by the attorney general's office, defines a strip search to include a body cavity search.\n[16] We note that, in Miller v. Kennebec County, 219 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.2000), we did not distinguish between a\nstrip search conducted as part of the intake process and two subsequent strip searches following the plaintiff's\ncontact visits with family members. Nor did we analyze the rationale for strip searching inmates following contact\nvisits. We therefore do not view Miller as helpful authority on that issue.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Defendants admit the allegations contained in Paragraph 14 of Plaintiff’s Complaint,\nwith the exception of the allegation that the Plaintiff was \"surveilled\" during his intake shower.\nDefendants are without sufficient knowledge or information so as to form a belief as to the truth of\nthat specific allegation and therefore deny same.\n15.
