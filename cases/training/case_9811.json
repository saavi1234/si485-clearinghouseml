Mr. Craddock's submission does not provide a basis for reconsideration of the Court's ruling of 11/10/2020 denying Mr. Craddock's earlier claim for a settlement payment. That ruling was largely based on the submission by class counsel in response to Mr. Craddock's claim. The Court believes that it made the correct ruling based on the record and declines to reconsider it. Also there is no basis at this late date to allow Mr. Craddock to opt out of the settlement. And there is definitely no basis to extend the statute of limitationswhich ran out as much as 15 years ago. The Court therefore denies both of Mr. Craddock's request. The Clerk is directed to mail a copy of this order to: Jermaine Craddock; # R-69423; Illinois River Correctional Center; 1300 West Locust; P.O. Box 999; Canton IL 61520. Mailed notice.

The Court again finds that notice of the settlement and the requirements for making a claim under the settlement was provided in the best means practical under the circumstances. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B). The Court makes the following rulings regarding the claims addressed in the report: 1) If, by no later than 4/16/12, Brian Lewis provides the claims administrator with proof of timely mailing of his claim form, the administrator is to pay his claim. If Mr. Lewis does not do so, his request for payment is denied. 2) The Court denies John Preston Jenkins' motion to demand judgment (dkt. no. 716) for the reasons stated in the joint status report, in particular that he did not submit a timely claim. 3) The Court denies Delano Horn's request for payment because he failed to advise class counsel of his change of address and failed to submit a timely claim. 4) Regarding the claim of Clarence Hebron, a further status report is to be filed by 4/20/12. 5) The Court denies Jeffrey Starks' request for payment on the ground that he failed to make a timely showing that he was eligible for payment. 6) The Court approves class counsel's determination to make payments to Samuel Jackson and Frederick Pigram on the ground that they are class members and made timely claims, and counsel's determination to reissue payment to Emerson Tucker on the same grounds. 7) The Court approves class counsel's proposals with regard to Darnell Grigsby and Reginald Brewer, specifically, that each of them is to submit a properly completed fraudulent activity report to the claims administrator. Unless Mr. Grigsby and Mr. Brewer submit such a report to the claim administrator by no later than 4/17/12, their claims will be denied. A joint status report regarding their claims is to be filed by 4/20/12. Finally, class counsel is directed to promptly mail a copy of this order to each claimant addressed in the order.

    "state": "Illinois",
    "summary": "<p>On January 30, 2006, on behalf of a female and a male plaintiff, the Chicago civil rights law firm Loevy &amp; Loevy filed this lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint challenged the Cook County Sheriff's blanket policy of requiring a strip and body cavity search of every detainee who entered the Cook County Jail for booking/intake, irrespective of the nature of the charge against the detainee and of whether there was any reasonable suspicion that the detainee was concealing weapons or contraband. Plaintiffs contended that suspicionless strip and body cavity searches of detainees accused of misdemeanors and other minor offenses violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiffs also alleged that the searches of male detainees were conducted in a degrading manner that was significantly different than the manner in which females were searched. All female detainees, however, were also allegedly given, without their consent, sexual transmitted disease (STD) testing by a vaginal swabbing procedure. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages and class certification on the various claims. Approximately a month later, an amended complaint added a third named plaintiff. A month after that, a second amended complaint was filed adding three additional persons, including officers of a health care contractor, to the multiple jail, public health, and governmental officials named as defendants along with Cook County.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants responding by moving to dismiss the case on numerous grounds which included: (1) no personal involvement was alleged as to the individual defendants; (2) testing for STDs by vaginal swabbing was not unconstitutional; (3) the County had no control over the Sheriff; (4) one of the three named plaintiffs (Johnson) was arrested for a felony drug crime, so the strip search of him was lawful; (5) each pretrial detainee arrived at the jail after a judicial determination of probable cause; (6) the issue of living conditions and treatment of pretrial detainees at the jail was decided by the district court in Duran v. Sheahan, Case No.74 C 2949 and the case is therefore barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion; and (7) the Sheriff had no control of the health care company that performed the vaginal swabbing. With the exception of dismissing the official capacity claims against the individual defendants, the District Court (District Judge Matthew F. Kennelly) denied the motion to dismiss by order dated August 25, 2006.</p>\r\n<p>On April 25, 2007, Judge Kennelly certified the case as a class action, with the classes defined as follows: (1) all males who were subjected to a strip search and/or a visual body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook County Jail on or after January 30, 2004; and (2) all persons charged only with misdemeanor or lesser offenses not involving drugs or weapons who were subjected to a strip search and/or a visual body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook County Jail on or after January 30, 2004. Defendants sought leave to appeal the certification order to the Seventh Circuit, but leave was denied. Plaintiffs decided not to seek class certification on the vaginal swabbing claims.</p>\r\n<p>On October 3, 2008, the individual defendants filed two motions for summary judgment, the first based on the constitutionality of the search policy in question, and they second based on principles of qualified immunity. On November 10, 2008, Cook County filed a motion for summary judgment, and on the same day, the plaintiffs also filed a partial summary judgment motion on the issue of liability.</p>\r\n<p>On February 23, 2009, the district court (Judge Michael Kennelly issued an opinion in which it granted the individual defendants' motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity but denied the individual defendants' motion for summary judgment based on the constitutionality of the search policy. The court also granted Cook County's motion for summary judgment with respect to the respondeat superior claims, but otherwise denied the motion. The court granted the plaintiff motion for summary judgment with respect to the claims of the Class II members and with respect to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims of the Class I members for searches that occurred prior to the installation of privacy screens, but otherwise denied that motion.</p>\r\n<p>On March 5, 2009, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied on April 2, 2009. 616 F.Supp.2d 834, N.D. Ill 2009. On August 13, 2009, the case went to trial, and the following day, the jury reached a verdict. They found in favor of the plaintiffs, and held that county jail employees violated the law in the manner in which they conducted strip searches of detainees. The defendant subsequently made two motions in response to the judgment and the district court denied them both.</p>\r\n<p>First, on September 15, 2009, the district court denied the sheriff's motion to stay the proceedings pending his interlocutory appeal of a purported 11th Amendment issue, specifically, the Court's ruling denying his motion for judgment as a matter of law at the recent jury trial. The court held that the interlocutory appeal was frivolous. 2009 WL 2986109 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 15, 2009). Second, on November 17, 2009, the court denied the defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law of for a new trial.</p>\r\n<p>The issue of damages still remained, so from March 29, 2010, to April 7, 2010, the court held a jury trial on damages. Immediately after the jury trial and before the verdict was issued, the parties entered into settlement talks.</p>\r\n<p>On April 28, 2010, the Seventh Circuit (Judge Easterbrook) denied the defendants' interlocutory appeal of the District Court's denial of \"11th Amendment\" immunity (Judge Easterbrook admonished the parties for confusing 11th Amendment sovereign immunity with qualified immunity). Judge Easterbrook held that the denial was not from a &ldquo;final decision&rdquo; and that the appeal was frivolous. The defendants had waited three years before they asserted immunity, so the District Court had held that the immunity was waived. 604 F.3d 360 (7th Cir. 2010)</p>\r\n<p>But on August 11, 2010, the court entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, but did not decided the amount of damages or attorney's fees. Instead, the parties reached a settlement agreement deciding those amounts. On November 24, 2010, the Court preliminarily approved the class-action settlement, and on March 4, 2011, the Court granted final approval of the class action settlement. The defendants agreed to pay roughly $18 million in attorney's fees and costs and $365,000 in incentive awards to the class representatives. The defendants also established a $55,000,000 cash fund to pay the claims of individual class members as they were submitted to the court. After the settlement agreement, the court retained jurisdiction and has been handling the claims of individual class members from 2011-2016. As of April 7, 2016, there have been no new motions from late claimants.</p>\r\n<p>Note: There was another strip search case against the Cook County Sheriff in the same District Court. That case, Bullock v. Sheahan, No. 04 C 1051, alleged an unconstitutional practice and policy of strip searching male inmates prior to their release from the Cook County Jail.

After two jury trials, the court found for the plaintiffs.  The parties reached a settlement agreement regarding monetary relief in 2011.",

Kennelly Sitting Judge if Other\nor Magistrate Judge than Assigned Judge\nCASE NUMBER 06 C 552 DATE 12/11/2009\nCASE Young, et al. vs. Cook County, et al.\nTITLE\nDOCKET ENTRY TEXT\nThe Court issues the following preliminary ruling regarding the pretrial procedures to be followed with\nregard to the damages trials.  Counsel should be prepared to address these points (as well as any other\npertinent issues) at the 12/14/09 status hearing.\nO[ For further details see text below.] Docketing to mail notices.\nSTATEMENT\nThe Court has reviewed defendantโs โmotion to clarify damages schedule / reset damages trial.โ  The Court\nhas advanced hearing date on the motion to 12/14/09 at 9:30 a.m., the same date and time as the status\nhearing previously set.\nThe Court notes initially that the motion is based on an incorrect premise, namely that the damages trials the\nCourt has set are โin order to ascertain the damages of the class.โ  Motion ยถ 1.  The Court said nothing of the\nkind.  The purpose of the damages trials is to decide the damages of the individual class members whose\ndamages will be tried, to facilitate the entry of a final judgment on less than all claims under Rule 54(b).  The\nCourt also notes that its assumption was that these damages trials will involve only plaintiffs who are\nmembers of the classes and portions of classes in whose favor liability was determined via the summary\njudgment ruling.  In other words, the Court assumed that damages trials would not involve members of the\nclass in whose favor liability was determined via the recent jury trial, given to the pendency of the\ninterlocutory appeal.  The Court is open to reconsidering the latter point and will expect counsel to discuss it\nat the 12/14/09 hearing.\nThe Court will hear argument on the motion on 12/14/09 but offers the following preliminary determinations\nregarding the pretrial procedures to be followed with regard to the damages trials.  Counsel should be\nprepared to address these points (as well as any other pertinent issues) at the 12/14/09 hearing.\n1)  The Court will set a short and certain date, preferably before the end of 2009, for plaintiffsโ counsel to\nidentify the plaintiffs whose damages cases will be tried (hereafter referred to as โthe damages plaintiffsโ). \nThe damages plaintiffs should include, absent unusual circumstances, all of the named members of the\nclasses or portions of classes in whose favor liability was determined via the summary judgment ruling.  If\nany members of those classes testified at the recent liability trial, they should also be included among the\n06C552 Young, et al. vs. Cook County, et al. Page 1 of  3\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 503 Filed: 12/11/09 Page 2 of 3 PageID #:12061\nSTATEMENT\ndamages plaintiffs, absent unusual circumstances.\n2)  Within 7 days after their identification, the damages plaintiffs will be required to serve Rule 26(a)(1)\ndisclosures relating to the damages trials.\n3)  Defendant wishes to, and is entitled to, serve written discovery requests on the damages plaintiffs.  That\nsaid, there is no reason for defendant to delay preparation of those requests.  The Court expects defendants to\nprepare those requests in advance of the identification of the damages plaintiffs and to serve them on\nplaintiffsโ counsel 7 days prior to the date on which they are required to identify the damages plaintiffs, so\nthat plaintiffsโ counsel have the requests in hand.  The Court will shorten to 7 days the time for the damages\nplaintiffs to answer the requests.  In other words, answers will be due on the same date as the Rule 26(a)(1)\ndisclosures.  The damages plaintiffs will be required to serve any objections to the written discovery on the\ndate for identification of the damages plaintiffs; counsel will be required to meet and confer regarding any\nobjections within 2 business days thereafter; and the Court will rule on those objections within 1 business day\nthereafter, so as not to delay the service of timely answers to the discovery requests.\n4)  The Court will impose a strict deadline on both sides for the service of document subpoenas on non-\nparties relating to the damages trials.  Counsel are expected to propose an appropriate deadline at the\nupcoming hearing.  The Court will set, and will enforce, strict deadlines on compliance with those subpoenas\nand will expect the party that serves the subpoena to take diligent and prompt steps to obtain compliance.\n5)  The defendantโs Rule 26(a)(1) disclosures will be due within 21 days after the plaintiffsโ Rule 26(a)(1)\ndisclosures.\n6)  The damages plaintiffsโ disclosures pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(A) & (B) will be due no later than\n28 days after the Rule 26(a)(1) disclosures.\n7)  The damages plaintiffs will be required to appear for deposition on dates to be scheduled.  The Court\nexpects the parties to propose at the 12/14/09 hearing an appropriate deadline  for completion of such\ndepositions. The Court intends to exercise strict control over scheduling of deposition dates and will, given\nthe limited issues to be tried, shorten the length of the depositions (the Court expects the parties to make\nproposals in this regard at the 12/14/09 hearing).  The Court likewise intends to shorten the time limits on\nany other depositions taken by either side relating to the damages trials.\n8)  The Court will impose a sanction of dismissal on any plaintiff who unjustifiably fails to appear for\ndeposition as directed.  Because of the limited time available prior to trial, substitutions of plaintiffs will not\nbe permitted absent unusual circumstances.  For this reason, plaintiffsโ counsel are advised to do their best to\nselect plaintiffs who will comply with the discovery requirements that the Court is imposing.\n9)  The Court also expects the parties to propose at the 12/14/09 hearing an appropriate deadline for\ncompletion of any other fact depositions relating the damages trials.\n10)  The defendantโs disclosures pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(A) & (B) will be due no later than 21\ndays after the plaintiffsโ disclosures pursuant to those Rules.\n11)  Depositions of experts, if any, must be completed by no later than 3/19/10, in other words, 10 days\nbefore the start of the damages trials.\n06C552 Young, et al. vs. Cook County, et al.

Any motions in limine\nwill be due by 3/22/10, in other words, one week before the trial date.  Motions in limine will be argued, to\nthe extent necessary, on 3/26/10, the last business day prior to the start of trial.\n13)  The Court acknowledges that it may not have covered every possible point of pretrial procedure and\nexpects the parties to be prepared to discuss these and any other pretrial issues at the hearing on 12/14/09.\n06C552 Young, et al. vs. Cook County, et al.

Directors Baird, Godinez, and Kurtovich each had final policymaking authority\nover intake strip searches at the CCJ during their respective tenures.  Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep.\nVol I.) at 7:18-24; 10:16-11:2; Kurtovich Deposition Vol II. at 42:16-44:5; 45:24-48:8; 49:16-\n51:1, Exhibit 11 hereto.

FRCP 25(d).\n3\n\nover the strip searches from January 1, 2004 to the present (i.e., even before and after his tenure). \nDefendantsโ Joint Response to Plaintiffsโ 5/14/07 Requests for Admission, No. 3, Exhibit 12\nhereto. \n14.  During their tenures, Baird, Godinez, and Kurtovich were responsible for ensuring\nthat the CCJโs intake strip search procedures complied with state and federal requirements for the\ntreatment of detainees.

Exhibit 11 (Kurtovich Dep.\nVol. II) at 38:23-39:2; 50:17-51:1.\n15. Salvador Godinez admits that he implemented, enforced, and/or condoned the use\nof the procedures challenged in this case during his tenure as Director of the Cook County\nDepartment of Corrections (โCCDOCโ).  Exhibit 1 (TAC Answer) ยถ 17, FRCP 8(b)(3),(6).\n16. It is also admitted that from January 1, 2004 to the present, Scott Kurtovich was\naware of the procedures being used to conduct strip searches on new detainees at the CCJ.  Id.;\nExhibit 12 (Responses to 5/14/07 Requests for Admission), No. 4.  \nII.  Background\nThe CCJ\n17. During the class period, the CCJ has housed at a given time approximately 10,000\npretrial detainees in 10 residential divisions.  Defendantsโ [Sheriff Sheahanโs and Cook\nCountyโs] August 16, 2004 Status Report in 74 C 2949 at 2, Exhibit 13 hereto.  The women are\nhoused in two divisions, the men are housed in nine divisions (there is one division with both\nmale and female tiers).  Michael Sheahan Deposition Vol. II at 146:19-24, Exhibit 23 hereto.\n18. In Jail parlance, new detainees coming into the facility are referred to as โon the\nnew.โ  Daniel Brown Deposition Vol. I. at 163:17-19, Exhibit 14 hereto.\n19. Detainees โon the newโ enter the jail through the Receiving Classification and\nDiagnostic Center (โRCDCโ or โReceivingโ).  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol. I) at 20:1-9. \n20. The RCDC is divided into a male side and a female side, which are physically\nseparated.  Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 74:2-20.  Female officers can work on the male\nside of the RCDC, but men do not work on the female side.  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol. I) at\n122:8-123:3.\n21. Women on the new are not strip searched at the RCDC.  Rather, they are only\nstrip searched upon arrival to a housing division.  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol. I) at 21:2-20;\n118:6-119:7; 133:3-134:9; 139:5-141:1; Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 58:8-12.  Men on\n4\n\nthe new are strip searched both at the RCDC and upon arrival to a housing division.  Exhibit 10\n(Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 65:5-66:22; Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol. I) at 162:12-15.  \nThe Class I Declarations\n22.  Group Exhibit 15 consists of declarations from 534 men who went through the\nRCDC hallway strip search during the class period.  See Declarations, Group Exhibit 15 hereto;\nDeclarations Summary (โSummaryโ), Exhibit 16 hereto.  \n23.  The Class I declarations were obtained by attorneys who interviewed the\ndeclarants.  Kanovitz Declaration ยถยถ 2-4 , Exhibit 17 hereto.  Each attorney was given a portion\nof the CIMIS database showing each person who was booked into the CCJ on a given day of the\nclass period.  Id .  The attorneys were instructed to contact potential male interviewees at random\nfrom the list and to interview only the first person for that day that they could reach.  Id.  By the\nabove process, Plaintiffs foreclosed any chance for selectivity based on the account of the\ninterviewees gave.  Id. \n24.  Thus, each of the 513 declarations in the summary covers a different day of the\nclass period, see Exhibit 16 (Summary), โsearch dateโ column, and thus describes a distinct strip\nsearch occurrence during the class period.  Id.\n25.  A handful of times, there was an error and Plaintiffs obtained more than one\ndeclaration for a given class period day.  When that happened, Plaintiffs would produce both\nstatements to Defendantsโ counsel and have included them in Group Exhibit 15.  Id. ยถ 5.\nIII.  The CCJ Intake Strip Search Policies\nA.  The Blanket Strip Search Procedure\n26. All people entering CCJ โon the newโ are strip searched under the CCJโs blanket\nstrip search policy.  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol. I) at 150:4-151:7.  The strip search is done\nregardless of the seriousness of the charges, regardless of whether the crime involved violence or\ndrugs, regardless of the circumstances of the arrest, and regardless of the detaineeโs criminal\nhistory (or lack thereof).  Exhibit 9 (Baird Dep.) at 32:9-22; Norman Carlson Deposition at\n176:6-177:2, Exhibit 18 hereto. \n27.  Before adopting the blanket procedure of strip searching all detainees on the new,\nthe Sheriffโs Department never looked into how often those accused of committing\nmisdemeanors brought contraband into the CCJ.  Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 91:2-17. \n28.  Indeed, the Sheriffโs Departmentโsโs FRCP 30(b)(6) witness was not aware of a\nstrip or visual cavity search ever turning up drugs or weapons on a detainee who was accused of\na non-drug, non-weapons offense misdemeanor.  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol. I) at 176-177.\n5\n\nB.  The Procedure for Women \n29.  Instead of strip searching women at the RCDC, the CCJ uses a bodyscan machine. \nErica Queen Deposition at 34:1-3, 63:5-22, Exhibit 19 hereto; Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol. I) at\n120:4-121:12; Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 59:16-8.  \n30.   The CCJ prohibited strip searching women at the RCDC in approximately 2000.\nExhibit 19 (Queen Dep.) at 18:12-24; Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol. I) at 118:6-119:7; 120:4-11. \n31.   The change for women was made as the result of a lawsuit or lawsuits concerning\nthe strip searching of women at the CCJ.  Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 49:2-22; 58:18-\n59:6; 140:23-141:1; 145:15-23;165:7-15; Exhibit 8 (Sheahan Dep. Vol. I) at 54:24-56:2, 73:19-\n74:4.\n \n32.   The body scan machine was installed several years after the prohibition on RCDC\nstrip searches for women went into effect.  Exhibit 19 (Queen Dep.) at 41:3-7. \n33.  Under the current procedure, each woman steps, one at a time, onto a platform,\nspreads her arms and legs, and then the operator hits a button to start the scan.  Id. at 34:10-16;\n63:20-64:8.  The scan takes about two minutes.  Id.\n34.  The women remain clothed during the scan.  Id. at 64:2-66:6.  Even though the\nwomen are clothed, the jail maintains a partition between the group and the machine so that\nwhen one woman is undergoing the scan the others in the group cannot see her.  Id. at\n63:20-64:1.\n35.  After completing the body scan, the women are picked up by officers from their\nhousing divisions.  Id. at 60:19-23.  Each woman is handcuffed and then they are escorted as a\ngroup through a tunnel beneath the jail complex to the housing division.  Damita Delitz\nDeposition at 14:22-16:4, Exhibit 20 hereto.  \n36.  Once at the division, the women are strip searched.  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol.\nI) at 92. \n37.  Each woman is directed into an open-faced cubicle which is approximately five\nfeet by five feet.  Exhibit 20 (Delitz Dep.) at 30:14-31:11; Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at\n47:9-48:12.  The cubicle is like a privacy screen in a doctorโs office such that no woman standing\nin her cubicle can be seen by any of the other women in their cubicles.  Id.  Each cubicle has a\nchair for the womanโs clothes.  Id.\n38.  The guards provide each woman a fresh sheet of paper to stand on so that they are\nnot standing on the bare floor.  Id.\n6\n\n39.  There are two womenโs housing divisions.  One has 13 cubicles, the other has\nonly three, and no more than that number of women participate in the strip search at one time. \nExhibit 20 (Delitz Dep.) at 28:15-29:16.\n40.  The women are first ordered to disrobe, then they are instructed to rub their\nfingers behind their ears, run their fingers through their hair, stretch their arms and feet apart, lift\ntheir breasts, and squat down and cough (although not necessarily in that order).  Id. at\n31:4-32:17.  The women then put their clothes back on, one article at a time, after shaking each\nto show there is nothing inside.  Id. at 35:1-13.  \n41.  During this entire process, the women are disrobed for a total of no more than\napproximately four minutes.  Id. at 59:13-16.  It is a quick process. Id. \n42.  The process is the same for all women on the new.  Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep.\nVol. I) at 92:14-18.\nC.  Additional Information About Prior Strip Search Lawsuits/Lack of Changes\nfor the Men\n43.   On April 8, 2001, the Chicago Tribune published an editorial about strip searches\nof women at the CCJ.  See Editorial, Exhibit 21 hereto; Exhibit 8 (Sheahan Dep. Vol. I) at 74:8-\n75:23; Exhibit 23 (Sheahan Dep. Vol. II) at 117:8-118:16. \n  44.   Sheriff Sheahan and members of his staff read the editorial.  Exhibit 23 (Sheahan\nDep. Vol. II) at 118:12-120:20. \n  45.   The editorial discussed a lawsuit filed by Tonya Townsend.  Exhibit 21 (Editorial)\nat 1.  Ms. Townsendโs lawsuit was styled Wilkes et al. v. Sheahan, et al.  See Wilkes Amended\nComplaint, Exhibit 22 hereto.  It challenged, inter alia, the female group intake strip searches at\nthe CCJ.  Id., passim.\n46.   Although he is not a lawyer, Sheriff Sheahan understood from the editorial that\nthe lawsuit challenged โthe demeaning wayโ in which strip searches were being performed at the\nCCJ.  Exhibit 23 (Sheahan Dep. Vol II) at 122:23-124:3.\n47.   The editorial stated that women were being strip searched in groups of 15 to 40. \nExhibit 21 (Editorial) at 1. \n48.    It stated that the women were being required to perform the squat and cough\nrepeatedly during the search.  Id. at 1.\n49.   The editorial stated that the guards would insult the women, calling them\nโbitchesโ and โwhores.โ  Id. at 1.\n7\n\n50.   The editorial stated that women would cry, collapse, and even vomit during the \nsearch if they were โdrug sick.โ  Id. at 1.\n51.   The editorial stated that unleashed dogs were sometimes used during the search. \nId. at 2. \n52.   The editorial stated that even the guards performing the searches had testified that\nthe floors were sometimes so fouled with urine, excrement and blood that they too felt like\nvomiting.  Id. at 2. \n53.   The editorial stated that New York City strip searches its detainees individually,\neven though it has more detaineees than Cook County.  Id. at 2.   \n54.   The editorial stated that in Cook County, instead of performing the searches\nindividually throughout the day, the jail waits until the bullpen fills up with a โcritical massโ of\ndetainees, sometimes for hours on end.  Id. at 2-3.\n55.    In January of 1995, Sheriff Sheahan was sued by a male inmate, inter alia, for the\nmanner of the group strip search, stating: \nUpon my arrival at [the Jail] I was taken to receiving.... Afterward ... we were\nstrip searched. We were made to stand naked and barefoot. The tunnel was\nextremely cold and the floor was damp and soiled.  After our clothes were\nsearched we were directed to turn around and face the wall. Then they searched\nour shoes and personal papers. I made the mistake of looking at the officer behind\nme.  He bashed my head into the wall....\nPryor v. Sheahan, 1996 WL 221198, *1 (N.D. Ill. 1996). \n56.    Judge Manning refused Defendant Sheahanโs motion to dismiss these allegations,\nciting Bell.  Thereafter, the claims were settled.  See Report of Committee on Finance for April\n15, 1997,  available at http://legacy.cookcountygov.com/secretary/CommitteePages/\nMeeting%20Reports/ Finance%20Committee/1997/04-15-97.htm.  \n57.   On or about July 16, 2003 (before the class period commenced), detainee George\nJenkins filed a grievance regarding his intake strip search at the RCDC.  Jenkins Declaration ยถยถ\n3-5; Jenkins Grievance, Group Exhibit 24, hereto.  \n58.   It states, inter alia:\nThis is a second grievance.  I am writing this grievance due to the improper and\nunconstitutional strip-body cavity search 3 times, or 2 more than was necessary. \n8\n\nThe second and third strip-body cavity searched was ordered as punishment for a\ndetainee in the strip-body cavity search line not understanding English . . . On the\n3rd strip-body cavity search c/o Broadway ordered us to stay bent over (Naked),\nholding our buttocks open (coughing), until he finished searching our shoes and\nproperty, which took about 5 minutes!\nId. (grievance).\n59.   In July of 2004, George Jenkins sued Defendant Sheahan and others over the\nintake strip search.  Jenkins Amended Complaint, passim, Exhibit 25 hereto.  The complaint\nalleged, inter alia, that plaintiff was subjected to misconduct: \nwhile at the Cook County Department of Corrections, on July 7, 2003, Div. 5, at\nabout 8:30 pm of the basement hallway or tunnel, during 3 consecutive strip body\ncavity searches that were performed in a highly abusive fashion and manner. . . .  \nDefendant Sheahan has failed to establish policies designed to safe-guard the\nplaintiff from being subjected to a strip-body cavity search 3 times in an abusive\nfashion in violation of Bell v. Wolfish. . . .  Defendant Velasco has a policy and\npractice of having plaintiff, and other pretrial detainees to be strip-body cavity\nsearched in an open hallway-tunnel. . . [and that there are alleged] illegal acts that\nare contained in Exhibits  #1 and #2.\n Complaint at 6-7B.  The first exhibit to Jenkinsโ complaint was the grievance dated July 16,\n2003.  Id. \n60.   The second exhibit was a letter Jenkins sent to Sheriff Sheahan dated July 22,\n2003, recounting the same events.  Id. at Exh. 2.  That letter was received by Mr. Sheahanโs\noffice and Mr. Jenkins was told it was being investigated.  Id. at Exh. 2, p. 4.\n61.   Sheriff Sheahan read the letters that his office received from inmates and did not\nhave his staff intercept them.  Exhibit 23 (Sheahan Dep. Vol. II) at 186:5-189:3.\nD.  The Group Strip Search Procedure for Men when this case was filed \n1.  The first strip search, at the RCDC\nSize of the Group/Proximity of the Searchees/Lack of Dividers\n62.  Unlike with the women on the new, the men are strip searched at the RCDC\nbefore going to their housing divisions.  Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 65:5-66:22. \n9\n\n63.  The RCDC staff do not start the strip search until the bullpen fills up.  Exhibit 14\n(Brown Dep.) at 98:12-22; 257.  Then they take the men into a hallway to be strip searched as a\ngroup.  Id. at 98:12-22; Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 75:13-23, 77:1-10.  All men are\nstrip searched in the same fashion.  Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 92:19-22. \n64.  The hallway is approximately 150 feet long.  Id. at 75:13-23.  Sometimes the\ndetainee line runs along the entire wall.  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol I) at 109:19-110:12. \nDeclarants have reported massive strip searches with detainees lined up on both walls.  See e.g.\nDeclaration of Darrell Flenard 1-11-07 (Inmates were lined up on both sides of the hallway and\nboth sides were completely full.โ) (bates nos. 1016-1017), Group Exhibit 15.\n   65.  Jail Guard Montique testified that the guards usually take groups of 75 men at a\ntime from the bull pen and that the last group of the night is usually fewer.  Alvin Montique\nDeposition at 34:16-37:7; 48:20-49:5, Exhibit 26 hereto.\n66.  Montique testified that the men have six inches or less between them.  Id. at 35:3-\n11.\n67.  Of the 513 strip search events covered by the Summary, 453 (or almost 90%)\ninvolved searches where the detainees were packed so close that the declarant made physical\ncontact with the body of at least one other detainee while he was being strip searched.  Exhibit 16\n(Summary) at Column 7 (โcontactโ).  See e.g. Declarations of: Derrick Peterson 4-1-04 (โGiven\nthe number of men in the hallway, I had no personal space during the search. . . . I made contact\nwith other searchees a number of times.โ) (bates nos. 96-97); Roy Cobbs 2-22-05 (โWe were\ninstructed to be so close to the people next to us that we were touching.โ) (bates nos. 296-297);\nJohn Schuricht 6-4-05 (โYou could not move without touching the naked men on each side of\nyou.โ) (bates nos. 440-441);  Joshua Yang 8-25-05 (โI was approximately 6 inches or less from\nthe inmates next to me.  Occasionally during the strip search I bumped up against the inmates\nnext to me.  There were no dividers.โ) (bates nos. 549-550); Torrence Williams 3-8-06 (We were\nordered to strip naked as a group. . . .   I had no personal space during the search.  As we stood in\nthe hallway, I was actually touching the shoulders of the inmate to my right and to my left.โ)\n(bates nos. 795-796); and Effrin Hobbs 1/1/07 (โThe inmates were literally forced to stand\nshoulder to shoulder.  As we stood in the hallway, I was actually touching the inmates to my right\nand to my left for the entire search period.โ) (bates nos. 990-991), Group Exhibit 15.\n68.  Additionally, all 513 declarants reported that they could see the naked bodies of\nthe other searchees and that it appeared that the other detaineees could see them.  Exhibit 16\n(Summary) at Column 8 (โvisibleโ).\n69.  The population coming into the jail includes homeless people, Exhibit 18 (Carlson\nDep.) at 127:12-19, and some of the detainees going through the strip search are dirty.  Exhibit\n26 (Montique Dep.) at 64:8-16. \n10\n\n70.  Many declarants reported an overwhelming stench from the mass strip search. \nSee e.g. Declarations of: Dewayne Stewart 8-14-05 (โThe hallway smelled horrible, like urine\nand a dead animalโ) (bates nos. 526-527); Daniel Galven 8-11-05 (โThe hallway smelled like bad\nbody odor, and there was no ventilation.โ) (bates nos. 520-521); and Bennet Sanders 1-1-06\n(โThere was garbage on the floor.  The hallway smelled like feces.โ) (bates nos. 711-712), Group\nExhibit 15.\n71.  Even the jail guards have directed complaints to supervisors and each other about\nthe stench.  Exhibit 26 (Montique Dep.) at 55:20-56:7; Bryan Hatton Deposition. at 78:4-14; 58,\nExhibit 27 hereto: Marlon Jones Dep.58-59:1, Exhibit 28 hereto.\n72.  No effort is made to determine the last time a person has bathed before they go\nthrough the group strip search.  Exhibit 26 (Montique Dep.) at 64:17-21.\n   73.  Some declarants estimated that over 100 men were forced to go through the search\nat one time.  See e.g. Declarations of: Leroy McKeller 10-22-05 (bates nos. 632-633); Timothy P.\nGaffigan 2-12-07 (bates nos. 1036-1037); and Brandon Gaiter 3-17-06 (bates nos. 805-806). \nGroup Exhibit 15.\n   74.  The Sheriff Departmentโs FRCP 30(b)(6) witness was unable to give an estimate\nof the average number of participants in each search.  Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 77:1-\n16.  Another 30(b)(6) witness, Daniel Brown, has seen 80 at a time, Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol.\nI) at 188:3-4, and he could not rule out that strip searches may be done with greater than 80 men\nat a time. Id. at 99:4-13.\n75.  For the period of time before Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification,\nthere were no privacy screens in the hallway for the men as there were for the women.  Exhibit\n10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 77:24-78:10. \n76.  Defendantsโ expert, Norman Carlson, is not aware of any jails that have done \ngroup strip searches without affording privacy dividers in the last 20 years.  Exhibit 18 (Carlson\nDep.) at 158:4-9. \n77.  Mr. Carlson was the main defendant in Bell v. Wolfish along with Griffin Bell. \nExhibit 18 (Carlson Dep.) at 46:1-11.  By the time of Bell, the United States Bureau Of Prisonsโ\nMetropolitan Correction Center at issue in that case was using privacy dividers for its strip\nsearches such that each participant had privacy from the others.  Id. at 50:8-51:9.  \n78.  When asked in November 2006 why the CCJ had not installed privacy dividers for\nthe group strip search in the RCDC hallway, the Departmentโs FRCP 30(b)(6) witness stated that\nhe was the most knowledgeable person and that to the best of his knowledge the Department had\nnever looked into it.  Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 86:19-87:11; 89:9-19.\n11\n\n79.  He also was not aware of any reason why dividers could not be used in the RCDC\nhallway for the men, and he could not foresee any serious problem with installing them.  Id. at\n88:14-89:19.\n80. Sheriff Sheahan made the decision to install the dividers for the women, Exhibit 8\n(Sheahan Dep. Vol. I) at 46:23-48:4; 56:6-10; 67:13-24, and to change the area where the strip\nsearches of the women were performed from the RCDC to the division.  Exhibit 23 (Sheahan\nDep. Vol. II) at 127:12-128:7.\n81.  He did not require the use of dividers for the men at that time.  Exhibit 8 (Sheahan\nDep. Vol. I) at 75:24-77:18. \n82.  Regardless, after approving the dividers for women, he did not have any objection\nto installing them for the men.  Exhibit 8 (Sheahan Dep. Vol I) at 83:18-84:6. \nThe steps in the strip and visual anal cavity search\n83.  Once in the hallway, the men are instructed to line up, single file, behind a yellow\nline that runs along the floor and to place their backs against the wall.  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep.\nVol. I) at 106:8-108:5.  The guards then order the men to step forward, remove all of their\nclothing and shoes, put the articles on the line, and then place their backs against the wall. Id. at\n184:12-85:21. \n84.  The group is then instructed through the following steps: raise their arms above\ntheir heads; wiggle their fingers; open their mouths and stick out their tongues; run their fingers\nthrough their hair; turn around and place their hands high up on the wall; and then lift the left\nfoot then the right. Id. at 184:12-85:21.\n85.  Additionally, the men are instructed to take a step back, bend over at the waist,\nโgrab their cheeks,โ pull them apart, and cough.  Id. at 112:12-22; 199:7-200:21.  The guards\nthen examined the exterior of each manโs anus.  Id. at 170:3-9; 237:12-15.\n86.  For each step, the officers performing the search must observe each searchee in\nthe group satisfactorily perform each step   Id. at 185:17-188:15.\n87.  According to Daniel Brown, an FRCP 30(b)(6) witness for the Department, the\nJail ceased performing this part of the search in or about March of 2006 (several months after this\ncase was filed) and now uses the squat and cough alternative that it had been affording to the\nwomen.  Id. at 112.\n88.  Brown was not aware of any justification for using the bend and spread on the\nmen rather than squat and cough.  Id. at 145:2-22. \n12\n\n89.  The CCJ has not encountered any problems substituting the squat and cough\nprocedure on the men.  Id. at 117-18.  It appears to be just as effective as the visual bend and\nspread search.  Id. at 176-177.\n90.  Despite the successful substitution, numerous declarants describing intake strip\nsearches occurring after March of 2006 report that the bend and spread is still used and that they\nhad to do both the bend and spread and the squat and cough procedures.  See e.g. Declarations of:\nStuart Fernandez 5-27-06 (bates nos. 884-885); Leodis Mitchell 5-30-06 (bates nos. 889-890);\nDarrell Flenard 1-11-07 (bates nos. 1016-1017); and Michael Scott 2-15-07 (bates nos. 1040-\n1041). Group Exhibit 15. \n91.  According to the FRCP 30(B)(6) witness Brown, the change from the bend and\nspread to the squat and cough procedure was never put in writing.  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol.\nI) at 112:9-116:11.\nHygiene/bodily fluids problems stemming from the dense search and lack of dividers \n92.  Bodily fluids were often present during the male group search.  Exhibit 16\n(Summary) at Column 10 (โbod. fldsโ).  During 245 of the searches, the declarant or another\ndetainee in the search  released diarrhea, vomited, and/or bled.   Id.  See e.g.  Declarations of:\nVince King 4-22-04 (โDuring the search, any of the inmates were violently sick.  The inmates\nwere made to clean up their own vomit even though this made them get sick again.โ) (bates nos.\n98-99); Bennet Sanders 1-1-06 (โThen when that inmate threw up, the guards made that inmate\nclean the vomit up off the floor with his own shirt.โ) (bates nos. 711-712); Nick Brocato 2-6-05\n(โI witnessed a number of men who were physically ill during this search.  There were a number\nof men who were vomiting and had diarrhea.  There was also one individual who had blood\ncoming out of his anus.  None of these men were taken out of line.โ) (bates nos. 280-281); Philip\nJones 2-24-05 (โOne older gentleman urinated on himself.  There were also a couple individuals\nwho were vomiting.  These individuals were forced to clean up their own vomit.โ) (bates nos.\n298-299); John Schuricht 6-4-05 (โWhen we were told to bend over, one inmate about five\npeople down from me complained that he could not bend over or he would throw up.  The guards\nshoved him into the wall.  I could hear the guards beating him. . . .  When we left the hallway we\nhad to walk through his vomit and feces.โ) (bates nos. 440-441); Damon Sanders 8-22-05 (โ I\nobserved at least 2 people vomit onto the floor.  I also observed an inmate with open sores on\ntheir arm and back.โ) (bates nos. 543-544); Jeremiah Brewer 5-26-06 (โ I did observe other\ninmates get ill and vomit during the search.  When this would happen the guards would scream at\nthe sick men and make them clean up the floor.โ) (bates nos. 882-883); Kirk Flemming 10-27-06\n(โI noticed that a few searchees were throwing up, and I saw one man pass out.  The guards\ncalled for help, but it took over 30 minutes for help to arrive.โ) (bates nos. 986-987); Effrin\nHobbs 1-1-07 (โBecause of the smells in the hallway, it was hard to breath.  I ended up vomiting\nand at least two other inmates began vomiting as well.โ) (bates nos. 990-991); and Anthony\nWilliams 2-10-07 (โDuring the search a couple of inmates began to get sick.  These inmates\nvomited on the floor and the walls of the hallway.  The vomit splattered and hit other inmates\n13\n\nand got on other inmates clothes that they had to put back on after the search.  At no point during\nthe strip search was any of this vomit cleaned up.โ) (bates nos. 1032-1033).  Group Exhibit 15.\n93.  Sheriff Sheahan knew that detainees vomit all the time because some may be\ncoming down off of drugs and get sick during the strip search.  Exhibit 23 (Sheahan Dep. Vol. II)\nat 166:2-24.  \n94.  Defendantsโ expert, Norman Carlson, testified that given the type of population\nthat is coming into the jail, he would also expect that people would at times vomit or have\ndiarrhea during the strip search.  Exhibit 18 (Carlson Dep.) at 128:1-22.\n95.  Men vomit โall the timeโ during the strip searches.  Exhibit 26 (Montique Dep.) at\n59:22-60:1.\nInsults and slurs/use of threats and violence\n  96.  431 of the 513 declarants reported insults being used by the guards during the\ngroup strip searches.  Exhibit 16 (Summary) at Column 11 (โinsultsโ).\n97.  The guards used insults about matters like body order, their anatomy, sexual\norientation and race.  See e.g. Declarations of: Joseph Sanchez 3-21-04 (โThe guards called me a\nโfaggot.โ  They called other inmates โbitches.โโ) (bates nos. 81-82); Vince King 4-22-04 (โThe\nguards regularly made comments regarding inmatesโ anatomy, especially their genitals.โ) (bates\nnos. 98-99); Ronald Robinson 7-11-05 (โThe guards made fun of inmatesโ appearances,\nincluding commenting about an inmateโs genitalia, and animal noises to comment on the size of\nan inmate.  One inmate who had bandages on and appeared to be bleeding was told, โitโs a shame\nthey did not finish you off because youโre an ugly motherfucker.โโ) (bates nos. 472-473);\nDameon Sanders 8-22-05 (โI observed a guard insult one inmate who did not speak English very\nwell.  The guard asked about his green card and said โ what are you doing here in America.โ  The\nguard also called him gay because of the look of his underwear.โ) (bates nos. 544-545); Bennet\nSanders 1-1-06 (โThey called us โnigger,โ โmotherfucker,โ โboy,โ and โpunk.โ  The guards called\none inmate that was gay โfaggot.โ  The guards taunted him saying โWith your homosexual ass.โโ)\n(bates nos. 711-712); Brandon Gaiter 3-17-06 (โThe guards called us โbitches,โ โhoes,โ โgays,โ\nand โladies.โโ) (bates nos. 805-806); Derrick Taylor 6-30-06 (โOne of the searchee on the line\ntold the guards that his mother had just passed on.  The guards then made rude and derogatory\ncomments about the searcheeโs mother.  When the searchee got upset he was called a โdope\nfiendโ and was threatened with being taken to another room and being beaten if he said another\nword.โ) (bates nos. 927-928); and Kirk Fleming 10-27-06 (โThey called us names like โbitchesโ\nand โhoes.โ  They used racial slurs and threatened physical violence.โ) (bates nos. 986-987). \nGroup Exhibit 15.\n14\n\n98.  Guards also frequently used violence during searches.  Of the 513 declarants in\nthe Summary, 397 of them either witnessed or was a victim of violence by the guards during the\nstrip search.  Exhibit 16 (Summary) at column 12 (โviolenceโ).  See e.g. Declarations of: Jesus\nUrichima 2-7-04 (โIf someone does not understand English, they will get beat up by the guards\nfor not understanding.โ) (bates nos. 14-15); Jose Santoyo 1-1-05 (โWhen these individuals did\nnot follow the guardsโ instructions immediately, due to their lack of understanding, the guards\nwould smash their heads into the wall or hit them in the face.โ) (bates nos. 234-235);  Kenneth\nCollier 8-30-05 (โApproximately 5 inmates were individually assaulted by the guards.  For these\ninmates the guard approached the inmate and punched the inmate a few times in the face and\nstomach.โ) (bates nos. 559-560); Mario Hogans 10-18-05 (โThey treated the sickest inmates the\nworst.  For example, when an inmate was too sick to stand, one of the guards went to him and\ntold him to stand or he would โsmackโ him.  When the inmate failed to comply exactly, the guard\nsmacked his head into the wall.  Simply put, we were not treated like human beings.โ) (bates nos.\n630-631); Kevin Gage 1-26-06 (โWhile I was bent over during the strip search I was kicked in\nthe back by one of the guards.  I could not say anything in fear of brutal retaliation from the\nguards.  I observed 3 other inmates get hit by the guards.โ) (bates nos. 729-730); Alphonso\nGaines 3-3-06 (โThe sick inmate was hit by the guards because he threw up.โ) (bates nos. 785-\n786); Brandon Gaiter 3-17-06 (โI was hit in the back of the head with my own Timberland\nboot.โ) (bates nos. 805-806); Waldon Brown 4-25-06 (โMy head was slammed back against the\nwall when I briefly moved it.  I also observed the guards slapping and pushing other men for not\nfollowing the instructions fast enough.โ) (bates nos. 848-849); Patrick Foster 6-17-06 (โI saw the\nguards slap one man and hit another with his own boot because they turned around while the\nguards were inspecting their own clothesโ) (bates nos. 917-918); Patrick Sanders 10-15-06 (โOne\nguard slapped a man in the face because he picked up his shoes when he was not supposed to. \nUpon getting hit, the man started to bleed from his nose.โ) (bates nos. 976-977); and Michael\nScott 2-15-07 (โThe guards also threw shoes at some inmates and kicked some inmates from\nbehind.โ) (bates nos. 1040-4041). Group Exhibit 15.\n99.  Also, dogs were sometimes used during the strip searches, 25 of the 513 (or\napproximately 5%) strip search events in the Summary included the use of dogs.  Exhibit 16\n(Summary) at column 13.  \n100.  Declarants reported that the dogs were used to threaten and frighten detainees\nduring the strip search.  See e.g. Declarations of: Nathaniel Butts 5-04 (โPerhaps the scariest\naspect of the entire process was the use of the dogs.  The guards allowed the dogs to search us\nwithout muzzles or leashes.  The guards told us that if we moved the dogs would bite of (sic) our\ngenitals.โ)(bates nos. 100-101); Nick Brocato 2-6-05 (โThere were three dogs used during this\nsearch.  These dogs were unmuzzled and came right up to us to sniff our bodies.โ)(bates nos.\n280-281); Alvin Stanton 7-8-05 (โThe dog sniffed the inmates belongings and the inmates\nthemselves, while the inmates had no clothing on.  The dog was not muzzled.โ)(bates nos. 467-\n468); Darryl Burrows 7-1-06 (โThe dogs stood by the guards and barked at the searchees\nwhenever a guard raised his voice.โ)(bates nos. 930-931); and Derris Miles 7-3-06 (โAt least\n15\n\nthree dogs were present during the search, one without a muzzle, and the guards made threats of\nphysical violence if any searchee were to look at the dogs.โ)(935-936).  Group Exhibit 15.\n101.  Director Baird gave orders to have dogs present at the RCDC in connection with\ninmates entering the CC DOC.  Exhibit 9 (Baird Dep.) at 41:23-44:14; 3/8/06 External\nOperations Memorandum, Exhibit 29 hereto.  \n102.  She gave the order after Director Kurtovich requested it.  Id.  She claims that her\npurpose for having dogs present at the RCDC was to โprovide a sense of calmโ and a โdeterrent\neffect.โ  Id.\n   103.  Director Baird believes that there could be a โmyriad of different situationsโ\nwhere it would be appropriate to use dogs during the RCDC strip search.  Id. at 39:5-40:6.\n104.  The K9 officers were expressly ordered to have their dogs in the hallway during\nthe male strip search.  Declaration of Jeffrey Aleman ยถ 3, Exhibit 30 hereto.  It was not\nuncommon for the inmates to be fearful of the dogs.  Id. ยถ 4.\n105.  Director Baird claims she did not know that dogs were actually being used during\nthe strip searches.  Exhibit 9 (Baird Dep.) at 38:24-39:4.  \n   106.  On April 22, 2005 (after Kurtovich had succeeded Baird as Director), Kurtovich \nhimself ordered that the dogs be present at the RCDC in connection with detainees on the new.\n5/3/05 External Operations Memorandum, Exhibit 31 hereto; Exhibit 29 (3/8/06 Memorandum).\n107.  On April 23, 2005, CCJ K9 specialist Aleman wrote an incident report criticizing\nthe use of dogs in the RCDC.  4/23/05 Report, Exhibit 32 hereto.  He wrote a second such report\non April 27, 2005.  4/27/05 Report, Exhibit 33 hereto.\n   108.  On April 29, 2005, Mr. Aleman wrote a third such report, this time noting that the\nK-9 assignment came from Acting Director Kurtovich.  4/29/05 Report, Exhibit 34 hereto;\nExhibit 30 (Aleman Declaration) ยถ 6.  Shortly thereafter, he was removed from the K9 team and\nplaced into a less desireable and lower paying position.  Id.  Director Kurtovich refused to give\nMr. Aleman an explanation for the demotion.  Id.  \nRepetitious searches and other demeaning procedures\n109.  Additionally, guards required that the groups repeat the strip search or portions\nthereof.  This would often occur when one member of the group would make a mistake or take\nlonger than the rest of the group, and the guards would require the entire group to repeat the\nprocedure as a punishment; sometimes there was no provocation at all.  See e.g. Declarations of:\nRoy Cobbs 2-22-05 (โI was order (sic) to bend and spread my cheeks as well as to squat and\ncough.  Both of these procedures took approximately one minute.  However, if anyone did not\n16\n\nfollow instructions we were forced to begin this process all over again.  The (sic) occurred a\ncouple of times.โ)(bates nos. 296-297); Daniel Galvan 8-11-05 (โI was required to bend over,\nspread my butt cheeks, and cough.  This process took approximately 10 minutes because the\nguards made all inmates repeat the process until the guards were satisfied that all inmates\ncoughed in unison.โ)(bates nos. 520-521); Robert Severson 10-17-05 (โBecause some of the\ninmates did not cough loudly enough and because some did not cough all in unison, the guards\nforced us repeat this humiliating procedure.  We had to go through the process of squatting and\ncoughing about four or five times.โ)(bates nos. 628-629); and Lonnie Holder 1-6-07 (โWe were\nforced to do this twice during the search because one of the inmates did it wrong.  We were bent\nover with our cheeks spread for about five minutes each time.โ)(bates nos. 1006-1007); Group\nExhibit 15.\n110.   Of the 513 declarants in the Summary, at least 395 reported the use of a bend and\nspread procedure either alone or with a squat and cough during the strip search.2  Exhibit 16\n(Summary) at column 9. \n111.   The average length of time that these declarants had to remain in the bend and\nspread and/or squat and cough position was 6 minutes.   Id.  \n112.  The duration of the entire strip search reported by the declarants was as follows:\napproximately 46% lasted between fifteen and thirty minutes; approximately 20% lasted between\nthirty and forty-five minutes; while approximately 24% took longer than forty-five minutes.\nApproximately 6% lasted between ten and fifteen minutes, while the remainder took ten minutes\nor less.  Exhibit 16 (Summary) at columns 1-5 (โoverall length of searchesโ).\n113.  Temperature often was also an issue during the group searches: 273 of the 513\nreported that the hallway was cold during the search.  Exhibit 16 (Summary) at column 6\n(โtemp.โ).  See e.g. Declarations of: James Thigpen 2-6-04 (โIt was cold to the point where it\nmade you shiver.โ)(bates nos. 11-12); Joseph Davison 6-1-06 (โThe hallway where the strip\nsearch took place was extremely cold and uncomfortable.โ)(bates nos. 893-894); and Kevin\nHenry 1-8-07 (โThe hallway was freezing cold and very uncomfortable.โ)(bates nos. 1010-1011).\nGroup Exhibit 15.\n114.  It is common for the detainees to complain about the temperature.  Exhibit 26\n(Montique Dep.) at 55:12-15.\n2 More declarants than 395 reported the use of a bend and spread procedure.  The number\nreported in the Summary (395) constitutes only those men who described a specific amount of\ntime for that procedure.  See Group Exhibit 15, passim.  \n17\n\n2.  The second strip search at the mensโ housing divisions\n115.  Once they have put their clothes back on, the men then wait in bull pens to be\ntransported to the housing divisions.  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol. I) at 200:10-201:16. \n116.  When the men arrive at their respective divisions they undergo a second strip\nsearch.  Id. at 162:12-163:24.  The process is the same as at the RCDC.  Id.; Exhibit 27 (Hatton\nDep.) at 93:25-94:20.\n117.  The female body scan is used at the RCDC because the Department prohibits strip\nsearching the women there like they do the men.  Exhibit 10 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol. I) at 66:3-\n67:15.  The purpose for the male RCDC search it to screen for contraband before the detainee is\ntransported from receiving into the jail.  Id.\n118.  The reason for strip searching men at the RCDC hallway, rather than only upon\narrival to the housing division as with the women, is because the CCJ has a body scan machine\nfor the women but not for the men.  Exhibit 14 (Brown Dep. Vol. I) at 159:8-160:4. \n119.  The Departmentโs 30(b)(6) witness had no knowledge why the Sheriff does not\nprovide a bodyscan machine for the men at the RCDC, or if the Department had ever looked into\nobtaining one.  Id. at160:5-161:7. \n120.  Following this Courtโs decision to certify the case as a class action, the CCJ did\ninstall a body scan machine for the men at the RCDC.  Exhibit 11 (Kurtovich Dep. Vol II) at\n19:19-19:4.   \n121.  It takes only seconds to complete the scan.  Id. at 58:3-10.\n122.  The machine costs approximately $150,000.  Id. at 19:19-20:4.  The CCJ also\nobtained an x-ray machine for the menโs shoes, which adds to the expense.  Id. at 20:14-21:4\n123.  The machine is not 100% effective at finding contraband.  Id. at 32:18-33:2. \nNevertheless, it is Mr. Kurtovichโs recommendation that the scanning machines should replace\nthe blanket strip search.  Id. at 33:21-35:8; 68:3-13.  Intake strip searches based on individual\nsuspicion would still remain an option.  Id. \n124.  As of Mr. Kurtovichโs deposition in December of 2007, the CCJ was still using\nthe blanket strip search at the RCDC.  Id. at 64:9-15.\n18\n\nBy contrast, the women have been transported to their\nhousing division without any RCDC strip search or body scan\n125.  For at least seven years before Erica Queenโs November 2006 deposition, strip\nsearching had been banned for women at the RCDC.  Exhibit 19 (Queen Dep.) at 18:12-24. \n126.  About three years before her deposition, the CCJ had installed a bodyscan\nmachine for the women in the RCDC.  Id. at 41:3-7. \n127.  In the interim, new female detainees were simply transferred from the RCDC\nthrough the tunnel to the housing divisions without a strip search or a body scan for weapons or\ncontraband.  Id. at 41:11-21.\n128.  Since the CCJ installed the body scan machine on the womenโs side of the RCDC,\nthe women are now body scanned for weapons and contraband before going to their housing\ndivisions.  Id. at 60:19-23. \n129.  Nevertheless, when the machine breaks down, the women are sent directly to the\ndivisions with no strip search to substitute.  Id. at 40-41.\n3.  The addition of the dividers for the menโs strip searches\n130.  In February of 2007, after Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification, the\nCCJ installed privacy dividers in the RCDC hallway for the male intake strip searches.  3/8/2007\nBrown Affidavit ยถยถ 10-11, Exhibit 35 hereto.\n131.  The dividers are privacy screens, consisting, essentially, of cloth hung on a metal\nrod.  Brown Dep. Vol. II at 14:21-15:1, Exhibit 36 hereto.  \n132.  The screens were set up in the hallway, approximately every four feet.  Id. at\n20:14-21:9.  The hallway is large enough to accommodate 37 strip stalls.  Id.\n  133.   The CCJ then limited the number of men who could go through the group intake\nstrip search at one time to the number of stalls.  Id. at 32:9-33:18.\n134.   The Departmentโs FRCP 30(b)(6) deponent testified that the change makes the\nsearch better and that the guards are probably more thorough with 37 people than with the greater\nnumbers.  Id. at 32:21-33:18; 36:1-38:2.   \n135.   Also, the change has not affected the CCJโs ability to timely process all of the\ndetainees on the new.  Id. at 80:12-81:12.\n19\n\n136.   Defendantsโ expert, Norman Carlson, admits that the CCJ has not experienced\nany major problems from the addition of dividers (beyond the wear and tear on the dividers\nthemselves).  Exhibit 18 (Carlson Dep.) at 54:20-55:9.\n137.  Following installation of the partitions in the RCDC hallway, partitions were\nadded for the strip searches at the divisions in approximately June of 2007.  Exhibit 11\n(Kurtovich Dep. Vol. II) at 9:21-10:7.\n138.  The change to the RCDC strip search procedure regarding the use of dividers was\ncommunicated orally to the guards; there is nothing in writing about the requirement.  Exhibit 36\n(Brown Dep. Vol. II) at 20:17-24.\n139.  Sometimes the guards fail to follow the verbal procedure.  See e.g. Declaration of \nNicholas Perez 5-4-07 (โAs we stood in the hallway there were 2 to 3 inches of space between\nmyself, and the inmate to my right and to my left.  There were dividers, but the guards did not\nuse them.โ). \nIV.  The Admittedly Reasonable BOP Strip Search Procedures Compared\n140.   Defendants admit that the BOP procedures regarding intake strip searches of\ndetainees are relevant to this case.  Exhibit 12 (Defendantsโ Responses to 5/14/07 Requests for\nAdmission), No. 16.\n141. Defendants also admit that the BOP procedures regarding intake strip searches of \ndetainees are reasonable for the circumstances in the BOP.  Exhibit 12 (Defendantsโ\nSupplemental Joint Response to Plaintiffsโ 5/14/07 Requests for Admission), No. 8.\n142. Defendants also assert that the circumstances for the BOP strip searches are\nsimilar to those for the CCJ in that: (1) both BOP and the CCJ receive pretrial detainees charged\nwith nonviolent offenses, violent offenses, and drug offenses, and also those who are repeat\nfelons; and (2) the BOP has a large intake volume of detainees sufficient to justify using a group\nstrip search procedure.  Defendantsโ Joint Answers to Plaintiffsโ Amended 9/28/07\nInterrogatories, No. 1, Exhibit 37 hereto. \nBOP Privacy Requirements For Intake Strip Search\n143. The BOP permits strip searching more than one detainee at a time.  Program\nStatement 5800.12 Chapter 1 at 9-10, Exhibit 38 hereto.  \n144. Nevertheless, the policy requires privacy amongst the searchees by limiting the\nnumber of participants to the number of available strip stalls (which are, essentially, privacy\ndividers).  Id.; \nExhibit 18 (Carlson Dep.) at 191:17-192:4.\n20\n\n145. The policy is dated 12/31/97.  Id.  By the time Mr. Carlson retired from the BOP\nin 1987 all of the facilities had privacy screens such that each person going through the strip\nsearch had privacy from the others.  Exhibit 18 (Carlson Dep.) at 50:3-51:5.\nBOP Prohibition on Blanket Strip Searches of Persons Charged with Misdemeanors\n146.  The BOP policies prohibit intake strip searches of detainee charged with\nmisdemeanors or contempt unless the detainee consents or unless there is reasonable suspicion\nthat the particular detainee is in possession of contraband or weapons.  See Program Statement\n7331.03 at 6, Exhibit 39 hereto.  \n147.  Rather, persons charged with misdemeanors or contempt are given the option to\navoid the strip search by remaining out of general population.  Id.; Exhibit 18 (Carlson Dep.) at\n169:15-20. \n148.  This prohibition has been in place since at least 2002.  Exhibit 18 (Carlson Dep.)\nat 90:2-13.\n149.  Defendantsโ expert, Norman Carlson, is not aware of any jurisdictions, other than\nCook County, that are doing blanket strip searches of persons charged with misdemeanors\nwithout giving them the same option the BOP gives.

KENNELLY, District Judge: \nKim Young, Ronald Johnson, and William Jones have sued the Sheriff of Cook County,\ncertain high ranking Sheriffโs employees, Cook County, and certain Cook County employees. \nPlaintiffs allege that the defendants violated plaintiffsโ Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights\nwhile they were confined as pretrial detainees at the Cook County Jail (CCJ).  Plaintiffs have\nmoved to certify two classes pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).  For the\nreasons stated below, the Court grants plaintiffsโ motion.\nFacts\nIn their second amended complaint, plaintiffs allege that the Sheriff and certain Sheriffโs\nDepartment personnel โimplemented, enforced, and/or condonedโ a policy of strip searching\nevery detainee that enters the CCJ, irrespective of the nature of the charge against the detainee. \n2d Am. Compl. ยถยถ 16-17.  They contend that suspicionless strip searches of detainees accused of\nmisdemeanors and other minor offenses are unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs also allege that the\nsearches of male detainees were conducted in a degrading manner that was significantly different\n\nthan the manner in which females were searched.\nYoung alleges that on January 13, 2005, she was arrested on an outstanding traffic\nwarrant and taken to the CCJ.  Shortly after arriving there, a female guard made her stand behind\na partition, take her clothes off, squat down, and cough.  Young put her clothes back on, and the\nguard led her, along with thirty other women, to a hallway lined with chairs, where the women\nwaited while they took turns going into a small room for STD testing.  Young claims that she did\nnot consent to the strip search or the STD testing.  Briefing on plaintiffsโ request to certify a\nclass on their claims relating to the STD testing is being handled separately.\nJohnson alleges that on April 18, 2005, he was arrested for felony possession of a\ncontrolled substance.  Shortly after he was booked in the CCJ, guards ordered him and one-\nhundred other men to strip naked in a hallway.  The guards then instructed them to face a wall,\nbend over, and spread their buttocks with their hands, as the guards proceeded to visually inspect\nthem.  The men remained naked in each otherโs presence for more than thirty minutes, during\nwhich, Johnson contends, the guards made comments that the men were unbathed and stank.  He\nalleges that the hallway was poorly ventilated and that the air reeked of body odor.  \nJones alleges that on December 30, 2005, he was arrested on an outstanding traffic\nwarrant.  He says that shortly after he was booked in the CCJ, he was strip searched in a hallway\nalong with one hundred other men.  According to Jones, there was no heat in the hallway, the\ntemperature felt like it was less than fifty degrees Fahrenheit, and the men were shivering during\nthe approximately forty minute period they remained in the hallway.  The hallway was poorly\nventilated, and the air reeked of body odor.  Jones alleges that the guards repeatedly poked fun at\nthe men.\n2\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the strip searches performed on Johnson and Jones were conducted\nin a manner violative of the Fourth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.  They also allege that because jail officials strip searched Johnson and Jones in a\ngroup setting but did not perform strip searches on similarly situated females in a group setting,\nthe searches of the men violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nPlaintiffs also contend that in view of the nature of the charges against Jones and Young, it\nviolated the Fourth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to\nstrip search them.  Plaintiffs have also made state law respondeat superior and indemnification\nclaims against Cook County.   \nThe plaintiffs have moved the Court to certify two classes.  The first proposed class\nconsists of all males who were, on or after January 30, 2004, subjected as new CCJ detainees to a\nstrip search (a term the Court will use to cover both strip searches and visual body cavity\nsearches).  The second proposed class consists of all males and females detained for\nmisdemeanor or lesser offenses not involving drugs or weapons who were subjected to a strip\nsearch as new CCJ detainees on or after January 30, 2004.    \nDiscussion\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 authorizes a court to certify a case as a class action if\nthe party seeking certification meets all of the requirements of Rule 23(a) and one of the\nrequirements of Rule 23(b).  Under Rule 23(a)(1)-(4), a plaintiff seeking certification of a class\nbears the burden of proving that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable; there are common questions of law or fact; the representativesโ claims are typical\nof those of the class; and the representatives fairly and adequately protect the interests of the\n3\n\nclass.  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a).\nOnce a party satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a), she must meet one of the\nrequirements delineated in Rule 23(b).  In this case, plaintiffs seek certification under Rule\n23(b)(3).  As a result, they must show that โquestions of law or fact common to the members of\nthe class predominate over any questions affecting individual members, and [that] a class action\nis superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.โ \nFED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3).  Plaintiffs โassume[] the burden of demonstrating that [class]\ncertification is appropriate.โ  Retired Chicago Police Assโn v. City of Chicago, 7 F.3d 584, 596\n(7th Cir. 1993).\n1. Rule 23(a) requirements\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that a class be so numerous that joinder of all its members is\nimpracticable.  Courts may rely on common sense assumptions or reasonable inferences as to the\nsize of a class.  Marcial v. Coronet Ins. Co., 880 F.2d 954, 957 (7th Cir. 1989).  The plaintiff is\nnot required to show the exact number of class members so long as impracticability is apparent\nfrom good faith estimates.  Lopez v. City of Chicago, No. 01 C 1823, 2002 WL 31415767, at *4\n(N.D. Ill. Oct. 25, 2002).  Mere speculation, however, is insufficient to prove numerosity.  Roe v.\nTown of Highland, 909 F.2d 1097, 1100 n.4 (7th Cir. 1990) (citations omitted).  \nRule 23(a)(2) requires the existence of questions of law or fact common to the class, and\nRule 23(a)(3) requires that the class representativesโ claims be typical of those of the class. \nThese requirements are closely related.  See General Telephone Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156\n(1982).  โA common nucleus of operative fact is usually enough to satisfy the commonality\nrequirement of Rule 23(a)(2).โ  Keele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998) (quoting\n4\n\nRosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir. 1992)).  A common set of operative facts is\nordinarily present when the defendants are claimed to have engaged in โstandardized conduct\ntoward the members of the proposed class.โ  Id.    \nThe typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3) focuses on โwhether the named\nrepresentativesโ claims have the same essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.โ \nRetired Chicago Police Assโn, 7 F.3d at 596-97.   โA plaintiffโs claim is typical if it arises from\nthe same event or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members and his\nor her claims are based on the same legal theory.โ  De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., 713\nF.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1983) (citations and internal quotation omitted).  Factual distinctions\nbetween the claims of the named and represented plaintiffs do not defeat typicality.  See Retired\nChicago Police Assโn, 7 F.3d at 596-97.  The claims of the named plaintiffs must, however, have\nโthe same essential characteristicsโ as those of the proposed class.  See id. at 597.  \nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the named plaintiffs fairly and adequately represent the class\nas a whole.  To fulfill this requirement, both class counsel and the class representatives must be\nadequate.  See id. at 598.  A named plaintiff is generally considered to be adequate so long as his\nor her claims neither conflict with nor are antagonistic to those of other class members.  See id.;\nRosario, 963 F.2d at 1018. \na. Numerosity\nProposed class one consists of all males who were, as new CCJ detainees, subjected to a\nstrip search at any time on or after January 30, 2004.  Since the beginning of the class period,\napproximately 250,000 men have been processed and searched at the CCJโs Receiving\nClassification and Diagnostic Center (โRCDCโ).  Plaintiffs allege that strip searches of new male\n5\n\ndetainees were conducted in the same manner throughout the class period.  Given the immense\nnumber of male detainees processed and searched in the same manner, proposed class one fulfills\nthe numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1). \nProposed class two consists of all males and females charged with misdemeanor or lesser\noffenses not involving drugs or weapons who were subjected to a strip search as new CCJ\ndetainees on or after January 30, 2004.  Plaintiffs sought database discovery from the Cook\nCounty Sheriffโs Department (โDepartmentโ) to determine the size of this proposed class.  The\nDepartment claimed that it could not extract the information from its computers and has not\nprovided information on the database system enabling plaintiffs to determine if they can extract\nthe information themselves.  As a result, plaintiffs have not yet received sufficient discovery to\nprove the exact size of proposed class two.\nFrom publicly available data, however, plaintiffs discovered that seventeen persons\nencompassed within proposed class two were admitted to the jail over a four-day period in\nJanuary 2007.  Plaintiffs contend that by extrapolating this figure over the class period, it is\nobvious that the members of the proposed class are sufficiently numerous that their joinder as\nindividual parties would be impracticable.  The Court agrees; plaintiffsโ analysis is rooted in\ncommon sense, not speculation.  See Lopez, 2002 WL 31415767, at *4 (holding that plaintiffs\nโneed not demonstrate the exact number of class membersโ as long as a court can draw a\nconclusion as to numerosity based on plaintiffsโ good faith estimates).\nCertain of the defendants argue that there is no โidentifiableโ class, but their actual\nargument seems to be that the strip searches conducted on incoming detainees are justified and\nshould be declared legal.  See Sheahan Resp. at 7-9.  That is not an appropriate inquiry on a\n6\n\nmotion for class certification.  In Szabo v. Bridgeport Machines, Inc., 249 F.3d 672 (7th Cir.\n2001), the Seventh Circuit made it clear that a court need not accept all of the allegations of the\nplaintiffโs complaint in assessing whether to certify a class and โshould make whatever factual\nand legal inquiries are necessary under Rule 23.โ  Id. at 675, 676.  In this case, however,\ndefendantsโ proffered justification for their strip search policy has nothing to do with whether the\nproposed classes are sufficiently numerous, whether their claims present common issues,\nwhether the named plaintiffsโ claims are typical of those of the class, whether the named\nplaintiffs are adequate class representatives, or whether the requirements of Rule 23(b) have\nbeen met.  Thus inquiry into the merits is not, in the words of Szabo, โnecessary under Rule 23โ\nto determine the appropriateness of class certification.\n Nor does the Court read Szabo as saying that it is appropriate to deny class certification\nโ in the absence of a meritorious motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment โ on the\nground that the plaintiff is likely to lose the case.  And even if Szabo were read that way, it\nwould be particularly unjust and inappropriate to apply such a rule in this case.  All parties\nagreed to defer โmeritsโ discovery pending the completion of class discovery and determination\nof plaintiffsโ class certification motion.  Allowing defendants to defeat class certification by\narguing that the evidence demonstrates that the policy of strip searching all new detainees is\njustified (a contention that, in any event, only addresses the claims of proposed class two) would\namount to requiring the plaintiffs to fight blindfolded, standing on one leg, with their hands tied\nbehind their backs.  The issue is more appropriately addressed at a later stage of the case.\nb. Commonality and typicality\nPlaintiffs contend that the claims of each of the proposed classes present common\n7\n\nquestions of law and fact and that the named plaintiffsโ claims are typical of those presented by\ntheir fellow class members.  Defendants argue that proposed class one is not viable because it\nincludes men charged with all types of crimes with varied criminal histories.  Defendants argue\nthat this class definition is unworkable because it includes, for example, detainees accused of\nfelonies or drug crimes, who, defendants say, properly can be strip searched.\nDefendantsโ argument misses the point.  The claims of proposed class one concern not\nthe propriety of conducting a strip search but rather the manner in which searches were\nconducted.  In a nutshell, the claims of this class are that jail officials searched all men in an\nunreasonable and unnecessarily degrading manner and that the disparities between the search\nprocedures for male and female detainees lack a substantial relationship to an important state\npurpose.  In other words, the nature of the charges against particular detainees has no bearing\n(or, at most, a minimal bearing) on the claims of proposed class one.\nTo satisfy Rule 23(a)โs commonality requirement, a plaintiff need only show that there is\nat least one question of fact common to the class.  Dunn v. City of Chicago, 231 F.R.D. 367, 372\n(N.D. Ill. 2005).  As a general rule, when โthe defendants have engaged in standardized conduct\ntowards members of the proposed class,โ the class meets Rule 23(a)โs commonality requirement. \nKeele v. Wexler, 149 F.3d 589, 594 (7th Cir. 1998).  In this case, the claims of both proposed\nclasses are premised upon contentions that the defendants acted pursuant to policies and standard\npractices that were common to all class members.\nCourts have consistently held that class actions challenging blanket strip search policies\nsatisfy Rule 23(a)(2)โs commonality requirement.  See, e.g., Bullock v. Sheahan, 225 F.R.D. 227,\n229 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (โPlaintiffs allege that defendantsโ policy of strip searching male inmates\n8\n\nunder the stated conditions violates their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  That issue is\ncentral to the claims of the proposed class; the commonality requirement is met.โ); Calvin v.\nSheriff of Will County, No. 03 C 3086, 2004 WL 1125922, at *3 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2004); see\nalso, Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1267 (7th Cir. 1983) (โAlthough the\ncircumstances surrounding the arrests and detentions of each of the plaintiffs-appellees in these\nconsolidated cases are not identical, the situations involve the following common elements: each\nwoman was arrested for a misdemeanor offense and each was subjected to the strip search policy\nof the City of Chicago.โ).  \nThe claims of proposed class one, which consists of male detainees, are that they were\nstrip searched in a manner that affords no privacy from other detainees using search methods that\nare unreasonable and punitive and were treated in a way significantly different from female\ndetainees without good reason.  It can scarcely be questioned that the claims of the members of\nthis proposed class have numerous issues in common.\nThe claim of proposed class two is that it is unreasonable and violative of the\nConstitution to strip search detainees who are charged only with misdemeanors or lesser offenses\nnot involving weapons or drugs, absent some particularized suspicion that the particular detainee\nis hiding contraband.  As with proposed class one, proposed class two challenges a standard\npolicy of the CCJ (the existence of which, the Court notes, the defendants do not appear to\ndispute).  Because both classes challenge what they characterize as standard policies and\npractices, common issues of fact and law permeate their claims.\nA named plaintiffโs claims are not atypical simply because there are โfactual distinctions\nbetween ... [their claims] and those of other class members.โ  See De La Fuente, 713 F.2d at 232. \n9\n\nUnder Rule 23(a), the commonality and typicality requirements โtend to merge . . . [and] serve as\nguideposts for determining whether . . . maintenance of a class action is economical and whether\nthe named plaintiffโs claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class\nmembers will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.โ  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 158 n.13. \nIn this case, the named plaintiffs are challenging the same strip search policies and methods as\nthe classes they seek to represent.  The likelihood of some range of variation in how different\ngroups of new detainees were treated does not undermine the fact that the claims of each class\nshare a common factual basis and legal theory.  De La Fuente, 713 F.2d at 232.  \nDefendants argue that the named plaintiffsโ claims are not typical of those of the classes\nbecause some new detainees likely favor blanket strip searches because they result in\nconfiscation of weapons and other items that might be used to harm them and because blanket\nsearches may prevent some detainees from being victimized by others who might force them to\nconceal contraband.  That may well be true, but it does not defeat the typicality of the named\nplaintiffsโ claims.  Among other things, because certification is sought only under Rule 23(b)(3),\nmembers of the class will be permitted to opt out of the litigation.  If the results of the opt-out\nprocess reflect a sufficient degree of antagonism among class members to suggest an absence of\nthe requisite typicality, numerosity, or other relevant factors, the Court will be open to\nreexamination of the issue of certification of proposed class two.  (The proposition that some\ndetainees may prefer blanket strip searches has little to do with the propriety of certifying\nproposed class one, whose claims concern the manner of conducting strip searches, not whether\nthey should be conducted to begin with.)\nFor these reasons, the Court finds that the named plaintiffsโ claims fulfill Rule 23(a)(3)โs\n10\n\ncommonality and typicality requirements. \nc. Adequacy\nDefendants do not dispute the adequacy of plaintiffsโ counsel.  The Court has no doubt\nthat plaintiffsโ counsel will be able to represent fairly the interests of the proposed classes.  \nDefendants argue that Jones and Young, the proposed representatives of class two, are\ninadequate representatives of that class because they were charged with felony offenses, not\nmisdemeanors.  A proposed class representative must be a member of the class she wishes to\nrepresent.  See, e.g., Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 625 (1997).  The evidence\nreflects, however, that like the other members of proposed class two, both Jones and Young were\narrested on misdemeanor charges, not felonies.  Specifically, Jones was arrested for driving on a\nsuspended license, and Young was arrested for driving while her license was suspended or\nrevoked, both of which are misdemeanors under Illinois law.  See Pl. Reply at 4 & Exs. A & B;\n625 ILCS 5/6-303(a).  In short, based on the evidence presented, Jones and Young are members\nof the class.\nDefendants point out that the CCJโs records appear to have stated that Jones and Young\nwere charged with felonies.  This gives rise to a legitimate question as to whether they are\nadequate class representatives; their individual claims may be subject to particularized defenses. \nSee J.H. Cohn & Co. v. Amer. Appraisal Assocs., Inc., 628 F.2d 994, 998-99 (7th Cir. 1980)\n(representativeโs claim may not be typical of those of the class โ a requirement closely related to\nthe adequacy of representation requirement โ if it is likely to become a focus of the litigation). \nBut this is far from apparent at this relatively early stage of the case, and the Court is\nunconvinced that any individual defenses are likely to be a significant focus of the case.  That\n11\n\nsaid, as the case develops, the Court will not hesitate to reexamine this issue if asked and will, if\nit becomes appropriate, require substitute representatives for class two (and, if none are offered,\nwill consider decertifying that class).\nd. Conclusion\nFor these reasons, the Court finds that both proposed classes satisfy the requirements of\nRule 23(a).\n2. Rule 23(b) requirements\nPlaintiffs seek certification of both classes under Rule 23(b)(3), which requires the โcourt\n[to] find[] that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate\nover any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other\navailable methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.โ  FED. R. CIV. P.\n23(b)(3).  \nWhen a class challenges a uniform policy or practice, the validity of that policy or\npractice tends to be the predominant issue in the ensuing litigation.  See, e.g., Falcon, 457 U.S. at\n147 n.20; Calvin, 2004 WL 1125922, at *4 (strip search case);  Blihovde v. St. Croix County, 219\nF.R.D. 607, 620 (W.D. Wis. 2003).  Both proposed classes challenge what plaintiffs contend are\nuniform policies.  The predominant focus of the litigation of proposed class oneโs claims is likely\nto involve the justifications for, and propriety of, non-private strip searches. \nDefendants argue, with regard to proposed class one, that the reasonableness of the way\nstrip searches were conducted must be determined on a case-by-case basis.  They point out that\ngroups of incoming detainees varied in size from day to day.  There is also the potential that the\nspecifics of what correctional officers said to detainees before or during the searches, the room\n12\n\ntemperature, and other factors may have differed from day to day.  Though these are valid points,\nthe Court is persuaded that the predominant issues in the litigation of proposed class oneโs\nclaims will concern the alleged lack of privacy and differences in the way male and female\ndetainees were treated, not whether (for example) there were fifteen as opposed to eighty male\ndetainees who came in on a particular date.  In any event, from the limited evidence that\nplaintiffs have developed to date, there is a basis to believe that it was relatively common for\ncorrectional officers to make offensive comments to detainees.  Thus, even if the specifics may\nhave differed on different dates, there is no reason to believe that those sorts of particulars will\nbecome a major focus of the litigation.\nWith regard to proposed class two, it appears to be largely undisputed that the CCJ\nsearches all incoming detainees, irrespective of the characteristics of the particular detainee or\nthe nature of the charge against him.  Defendants contend, however, that the Court will have to\nmake an inquiry, individual to each class member, regarding whether the facts known to CCJ\nofficials gave rise to a proper basis to conduct a search.  This, defendants argue, precludes\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3).  The Court disagrees.  We can put it no better than our\ncolleague Judge Robert Gettleman did in certifying a class of similar plaintiffs in a case\ninvolving the Will County Jail:\nDefendants misconceive the way in which reasonable suspicion factors into the\nclass.  Plaintiffs allege that under the uniform strip search policy adopted by the\nSheriff, jail personnel never undertook reasonable suspicion or probable cause\ninquiries.  Thus, the ultimate legal question is not whether jail personnel made\nerroneous reasonable suspicion determinations regarding each individual, but\nwhether the Sheriffโs policy avoided all such inquiry, thus depriving those\nindividuals of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The question of\nthe validity of the Sheriffโs policy thus predominates over any โindividualized\nquestions.โ \n13\n\nCalvin, 2004 WL 1129522, at *4.\nIn sum, the Court finds that plaintiffs have established that common questions\npredominate over individual issues for both proposed classes.\nThe Court also finds that plaintiffs have shown that a class action is the superior method\nfor pursuing plaintiffsโ claims.  From the standpoint of judicial economy, handling even a\nmodest portion of the potential claims of detainees likely would overwhelm the docket in this\nDistrict.  This is a case in which โclass action treatment is appropriate and [ ] permitted by Rule\n23 [because] the judicial economy from consolidation of separate claims outweighs any concern\nwith possible inaccuracies from their being lumped together in a single proceeding for decision\nby a single judge or jury.โ  Mejdrech v. Met-Coil Systems Corp., 319 F.3d 910, 911 (7th Cir.\n2003).  \nDefendants also argue that the superiority requirement is not met because the treatment\nof pretrial detainees at the CCJ is already subject to monitoring pursuant to a consent decree\nentered in the case of Duran v. Sheahan, Case No. 74 C 2949.  They contend that โ[p]laintiffs\ncovered by a consent decree cannot bring claims for equitable relief outside of a contempt order\ninitiated before [the] court [that issued the consent decree].โ  Sheahan Resp. at 14.  The Court\naddressed this issue when it considered defendantsโ motion to dismiss.  See Young v. County of\nCook, No. 06 C 552, slip op. at 11-14 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 25, 2006).  Defendants have made no new\npoints in this regard, so the Court will summarize the pertinent portions of its earlier ruling. \nFirst, the contention that the issues in this case were at issue in Duran โis utterly unsupported\nand borders on the frivolous.โ  Id. at 12.  The defendants have made no effort to show that strip\nsearching of detainees at intake โwas so much as discussed with the court prior to its approval of\nthe Duran decree, let alone that those issues were disputed, litigated, or decided.โ  Id.  Second,\n14\n\ndefendants โhave not pointed to any part of the Duran consent decree that addresses anything\nlike the intake strip search . . . procedures that are at issue in this case.โ  Id. at 13.  As a result,\nthe Duran decree does not preclude the proposed classesโ injunctive relief claims, and the\nSeventh Circuit has held that the decree has no preclusive effect on claims for damages.  Id.\n(citing Martin v. Davies, 917 F.2d 336, 340 (7th Cir. 1990)).  In short, the contention that the\nclaims in this case may be brought, if at all, only as part of the Duran case is entirely lacking in\nmerit.\n3. Cook County\nIn its memorandum opposing class certification, Cook County argues, as it did in a\nmotion to dismiss, that it cannot be held liable for the acts of the Sheriff.  As the Court ruled,\nhowever, the County is a necessary party to this case.  Id. at 8 (citing Carver v. Sheriff of LaSalle\nCounty, 324 F.3d 947, 948 (7th Cir. 2003), and Robinson v. Sappington, 351 F.3d 317, 338-39\n(7th Cir. 2003)).  In any event, the Countyโs argument presents no basis to decline certification\nof the proposed classes.\n4. Final points\nIf anything โpredominatesโ in this case, it is defendantsโ strenuous and repeated\narguments whose apparent aim is to convince the Court that the plaintiffs are doomed to lose the\nlawsuit.  See, e.g., Sheahan Mem. at 3 & 6 (citing sixty-one instances in which strip searches\nrevealed attempted smuggling), 4 (argument that there are good reasons for treating male\ndetainees differently from females), 7-8 (arguing the legal validity of strip searches); Cook\nCounty Mem. at 6 (arguing that strip searches are legal), 11-14 (arguing that the search\nprocedures are reasonable).  These arguments are misplaced in the present context.  As the Court\nhas discussed, though it is appropriate to go behind the pleadings when necessary to assess the\n15\n\nfactors for certification under Rule 23, none of these arguments actually concerns Rule 23โs\nfactors.  Moreover, defendants agreed to defer discovery on the merits, and as a result plaintiffs\nare effectively precluded at this stage from responding to defendantsโ proffered justifications for\nthe challenged policies.  For those reasons, defendants cannot defeat class certification by\narguing that plaintiffs are pursuing a losing cause.\nIf defendants want a decision on the merits โ as seems to be the case โ they should move\nfor summary judgment.  That will allow the Court to determine what discovery plaintiffs are\nentitled to take in order to address the merits.  At the current stage of the litigation, however, a\nruling that amounts to a decision on the merits of the plaintiffsโ claims would be premature.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants plaintiffsโ motion for class certification\n[docket no. 75].  The Court certifies the following classes under Rule 23:  (1) all males who were\nsubjected to a strip search and/or a visual body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook\nCounty Jail on or after January 30, 2004; and (2) all persons charged only with misdemeanor or\nlesser offenses not involving drugs or weapons who were subjected to a strip search and/or a\nvisual body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook County Jail on or after January 30, 2004.  \n \n__________________________________________\n         MATTHEW F.

The current appeal, by the Sheriff (other\ndefendants have not joined this appeal), concerns only\nsearches  after  February  2007  of  detainees  when  they\nfirst arrive at the Jail.\nThe district judge concluded that, because the classโs\nclaims arise from the manner rather than the fact of these\nsearches, the holding of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558โ62\n(1979), does not vindicate the Sheriffโs position. A jury\ntrial was held. At the close of the proofs, the Sheriff filed\na motion for judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 50. He argued that Illinois requires jailers to conduct\nstrip searches and that, when complying with this rule, a\nsheriff or other custodian is part of โthe stateโ for the\npurpose  of  the  doctrine  of  state  sovereign  immunity\nrecognized in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890).\nThe parties call this โeleventh amendment immunity,โ\nโ\nwhich  is  triply  inaccurate first  because  Hans  did  not\ninterpret the eleventh amendment, whose text is limited\nto diversity suits; second because the eleventh amend-\nment limits the jurisdiction of federal courts rather than\nestablishing an immunity, see Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S.\n740, 745 n.2 (1998); Ruehman v. Sheahan, 34 F.3d 525, 527\n(7th Cir. 1994); and third because a state (including a\nstate officer sued in an official capacity) is not a โpersonโ\nfor the purpose of ยง1983. Will v. Michigan Department of\nState Police, 491 U.S. 58 (1989). That statutory rule makes\nit  unnecessary  and  inappropriate  to  consider  what\nlimits the eleventh amendment would create.

For reasons discussed below, however, it does\nnot matter whether โeleventh amendment immunityโ is\na useful shorthand for the Sheriffโs position.\nThe district judge observed that the theory behind the\nRule 50 motion was being raised for the first time even\nthough the suit had been pending for three years. The\njudge  deemed  the  contention  forfeited  and  submitted\nthe case to the jury, which returned a verdict in favor of\nthe class on liability. Because the trial had been bifurcated,\nthe next stage was the presentation of evidence about\ndamages. But, before that phase could begin, the Sheriff\nfiled a notice of appeal, contending that the rejection of\nhis theory is immediately appealable under Puerto Rico\nAqueduct & Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506\nU.S. 139 (1993).\nMetcalf  &  Eddy  applies  to  sovereign  immunity  the\napproach to interlocutory appeals developed by Mitchell\nv. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 525โ30 (1985), for situations in\nwhich a public official asserts an absolute or qualified\nimmunity.  We  assume  (without  deciding)  that  the\nSupreme Court would extend this understanding of the\ncollateral-order doctrine, see Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial\nLoan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949), to an appeal by a state\nofficial  who  contends  that  the  definition  of  the  word\nโ\nโpersonโ in ยง1983 means that a suit is untenable though\nthat  extension  of  Mitchell  would  bring  the  doctrine\nawfully close to authorizing interlocutory review of the\nmerits. (Sovereign immunity does not apply because ยง5\nof  the  fourteenth  amendment  empowers  Congress  to\nsubject states to suits for violations of that amendment.\n\nCaCsea:s 1e::0C 06a9-sc-e3v:0- 0090925- 3 5 0 2 9  DD2oo  cc  uu  mmDeoencntut:  m#0:e0 6n70t1:0 13 3F67i l 4e  3d  2:F 70il 4e  /d 2 : 8 F0/1i4le0/2d P8: a/02g50e/12 400  /o 2 f 0  1 1P30a  P g  ae  gsPe: aI1Dg3e #s::1 133695\n4 No. 09-3092\nSee  Fitzpatrick  v.  Bitzer,  427  U.S.  445  (1976).  The  class\ncontends that the Sheriff violated the fourteenth amend-\nment,  directly  and  via  its  incorporation  of  the  fourth\namendment.  So  Congress  could  authorize  a  suit  such\nas this against a state, though Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332\n(1979), holds that ยง1983 does not do so.) Even on the\nassumption that Mitchell applies to appeals of this kind,\nhowever,  the  Sheriffโs  appeal  must  be  dismissed  for\nwant of jurisdiction.\nLike any other application of the collateral-order doc-\ntrine,  Mitchell  depends  on  characterizing  the  decision\nunder review as โfinal,โ because Mitchell interprets 28\nU.S.C. ยง1291,  a statute that makes  finality essential  to\nappellate jurisdiction. Mitchell rests on the view that, as\na practical matter, an order declining to dismiss a com-\nplaint,  or  denying  a  motion  for  summary  judgment,\nfinally resolves the defendantโs assertion of a โright not\nโ\nto be triedโ for an immunity (unlike a defense on the\nmerits) confers an entitlement to be free of the judicial\nprocess as well as an entitlement to avoid an adverse\njudgment.  An  order  rejecting  a  claim  of  immunity  is\nfinal  in  the two senses  that  matter  to  Mitchell  and  its\nsuccessors:  it  represents  the  district  courtโs  definitive\nresolution, and it subjects the defendant to the judicial\nprocess,  with  all  of  the  costs  that  discovery  and  trial\nproduce.  When  a  district  court  postpones  resolution\nuntil  it  has  received  additional  submissions  from  the\nlitigants, it has not made a decision that is โfinalโ  in\nMitchellโs  sense.  See  Khorrami  v.  Rolince,  539  F.3d  782,\n786โ87 (7th Cir. 2008). And when the defendantโs con-\ntention  does  not invoke  a  โright  not to  be tried,โ the\nfoundation for an interlocutory appeal is missing.\n\nCaCsea:s 1e::0C 06a9-sc-e3v:0- 0090925- 3 5 0 2 9  DD2oo  cc  uu  mmDeoencntut:  m#0:e0 6n70t1:0 13 3F67i l 4e  3d  2:F 70il 4e  /d 2 : 8 F0/1i4le0/2d P8: a/02g50e/12 500  /o 2 f 0  1 1P30a  P g  ae  gsPe: aI1Dg3e #s::1 133696\nNo. 09-3092 5\nTo  date,  the  Supreme  Court  has  treated  only  two\nkinds  of  orders  as  โfinalโ  for  the  purpose  of  an\nimmunity appeal: denial of a motion to dismiss the com-\nplaint and denial of a motion for summary judgment. See\ngenerally Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 305โ11 (1996).\nThese two orders often are the outcome of focused en-\ngagements after full briefing; each represents the end of\na discrete stage in the litigation, during which the legal\nissue has crystallized and been resolved as a matter of\nlaw. Oral denial of a mid-trial motion under Rule 50, by\ncontrast, is not final by that standard. It is possible to\nsee how an order denying a motion for summary judg-\nment  can  be  called  โfinalโ  for  some  purposes  even\nthough the judge has allowed the suit to proceed; but a\nmid-trial ruling is not โfinalโ for any purpose. It is a step\non the way to a verdict. And a mid-trial motion under\nRule 50 does not assert a โright not to be triedโ or even a\nโright to be free of costly discoveryโ; it asserts a right to\nwin (thatโs why it is called a โmotion for judgment as a\nmatter of lawโ). Discovery and trial have occurred by\nthe time lawyers start making Rule 50 motions. A judgeโs\noral statement allowing the trial to proceed may presage\na  final  decision  (judgment  on  the  verdict)  but  is  not\nitself a final decision.\nIt is hard to imagine that the Justices have authorized\npublic officials to bring trials to a halt and disband the\njury while a pre-verdict appeal proceeds. As a practical\nmatter that would give every public official a right to a\nmistrial  in  every  ยง1983  suit  that  seemed  to  be  going\nthe plaintiffโs way, because once a trial stops jurors are\nlikely to forget the evidence, to come across information\n\nCaCsea:s 1e::0C 06a9-sc-e3v:0- 0090925- 3 5 0 2 9  DD2oo  cc  uu  mmDeoencntut:  m#0:e0 6n70t1:0 13 3F67i l 4e  3d  2:F 70il 4e  /d 2 : 8 F0/1i4le0/2d P8: a/02g50e/12 600  /o 2 f 0  1 1P30a  P g  ae  gsPe: aI1Dg3e #s::1 133697\n6 No. 09-3092\nthey are not supposed to read, to discuss the trial with\nfriends and relatives, or all three. Appellate delay would\ncompel the trial to start over with a new jury. Although a\ndistrict judge is entitled to certify that an appeal is frivo-\nlous  and  proceed  with  the  litigation,  see  Apostol  v.\nGallion, 870 F.2d 1335 (7th Cir. 1989), the need for this\nprocedure  (and  for  the  court  of  appeals  to  consider\nwhether  to  stay  the  trial  notwithstanding  an  Apostol\ncertification)  would  throw  a  monkey  wrench  into  the\nproceedings.  And  at  a  second  trial  the  public  official\ncould  force  still  another  mistrial,  because  Behrens\nholds that there is no numerical limit on the number of\npermissible interlocutory appeals in a single case. The\nonly  requirement  is  that  each  order  sought  to  be\nappealed be โfinalโ under Mitchell.\nThus both formal reasons (a mid-trial order is not โfinalโ\nand does not concern a โright not to be triedโ) and practi-\ncal ones (the need to prevent defendants from thwarting\nthe  completion  of  ongoing  trials  and  disrupting  the\norderly management of litigation) lead us to conclude\nthat a district judgeโs oral statement denying a mid-trial\nRule 50 motion is not appealable as a โcollateral orderโ\nunder ยง1291.\nShould  bifurcated  trials  be  treated  differently?  The\nSheriff did not file his appeal until the jury had returned\nits verdict on liability. Perhaps one could say that the\nSheriff  was  asserting  a  โright  not  to  be  triedโ  on  the\ndamages  phase  of  the  litigation.  Attaching  dispositive\nsignificance to the fact that the district judge chose to\nbifurcate the trial might turn what is supposed to be an\n\nCaCsea:s 1e::0C 06a9-sc-e3v:0- 0090925- 3 5 0 2 9  DD2oo  cc  uu  mmDeoencntut:  m#0:e0 6n70t1:0 13 3F67i l 4e  3d  2:F 70il 4e  /d 2 : 8 F0/1i4le0/2d P8: a/02g50e/12 700  /o 2 f 0  1 1P30a  P g  ae  gsPe: aI1Dg3e #s::1 133698\nNo. 09-3092 7\neconomizing  measure  (the  liability  phase  is  easier  to\nmanage  if  damages  evidence  is  postponed)  into  an\noccasion for a prolonged interruption. But just in case\nthe  Justices should  conclude  that  there  is  a  difference\nbetween a mid-trial Rule 50 decision in a unitary trial\nand  a  mid-trial  Rule  50  decision  in  a  bifurcated  trial,\nwe  add  that  this  appeal  must  be  dismissed  anyway,\nbecause it is frivolous.\nThe district judge thought the appeal frivolous because\nthe Sheriff forfeited this theory of immunity by raising\nit for the first time at the end of trial. (Earlier he had\nraised other theories related to sovereign immunity, but\nthis one was a novelty in the litigation.) The judge was\nright to find a forfeiture, though this does not necessarily\nrender the appeal frivolous. Appellate courts sometimes\nrelieve  the  parties  of  forfeitures,  especially  when  the\nlitigation  is  against  a  public  official  in  a  representa-\ntive  rather  than  a  personal  capacity.  See,  e.g.,  Day  v.\nMcDonough, 547 U.S. 198 (2006); Granberry v. Greer, 481\nU.S. 129 (1987); Ford Motor Co. v.

Apr. 22, 2010) (en banc). But this\nappeal  is  substantively  frivolous.  It  is  nothing  but\na delaying tactic and deserves to be swiftly squelched.\nCf. Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 662 n.8 (1977).\nThe Sheriff of Cook County, a local official, is not โthe\nstateโ for the purpose of either Illinois or federal law, and\ntherefore  the  Sheriff  is  a  โpersonโ  as  ยง1983  uses  that\nword.

The Sheriffโs contrary argument proceeds\nin two steps: first, he contends that Illinois law requires\nall  sheriffs  to  conduct  strip  searches  of  all  inmates\narriving at county jails; second, he maintains that any\nlocal official whose conduct is dictated by state law is\nโthe stateโ to the extent of that obligation. It follows, the\nSheriff concludes, that he is not a โpersonโ under Will\n(or, in his own language, that he has โeleventh amend-\nment  immunityโ).  Neither  premise  of  this  syllogism\nis sound.\n1. The state law on which the Sheriff relies is 20 Ill.\nAdmin. Code ยง701.40(f), a regulation that specifies proce-\ndures for admissions to county jails. It provides:\n1) A strip search shall be performed in an area that\nensures privacy and dignity of the individual. The\nindividual shall not be exposed to the view of\nothers who are not specifically involved in the\nprocess.\n2) Strip searches shall be conducted by a person\nof the same sex.\n3) All personal clothing shall be carefully searched\nfor contraband.\n4) The probing of body cavities may not be done\nexcept  where  there  is  reasonable  suspicion  of\n\nCaCsea:s 1e::0C 06a9-sc-e3v:0- 0090925- 3 5 0 2 9  DD2oo  cc  uu  mmDeoencntut:  m#0:e0 6n70t1:0 13 3F67i l 4e  3d  2:F 70il 4e  /d 2 : 8 F0/1i4le0/2d P8: a/02g50e/12 900  /o 2 f 0  1 1P30a  P g  ae  gsPe: aI1Dg3e #s::1 133700\nNo. 09-3092 9\ncontraband. Intrusive searches may only be con-\nducted:\nA) By a medically trained person who is not a\ndetainee, for example, a physician, physicianโs\nassistant, registered nurse, licensed practical\nnurse, or paramedic; and\nB) In a private location under sanitary condi-\ntions.\nThe Sheriff reads this regulation as if it said โ[a] strip\nsearch  shall  be  performedโ  and  the  sentence  stopped\nthere. Plaintiffs, by contrast, read the language as a re-\nquirement  that  strip  searches,  if  performed,  โshall  be\nperformed in an area that ensures privacy and dignityโ\n(and so on). In other words, the Sheriff treats the โshallโ\nin this construction as compelling a strip search, while\nthe  plaintiffs  treat  it  as  compelling  the  preservation\nof dignity.\nEither reading is possible, because โshallโ is a notori-\nously  slippery  word.  See,  e.g.,  Gutierrez  de  Martinez  v.\nLamagno, 515 U.S. 417, 432โ33 & n.9 (1995). One reason\nto think that the Sheriffโs reading is sensible is subsec-\ntion (b), which says: โDetainees shall be given an im-\nmediate  frisk  search.โ  This  uses  โshallโ  in  the  same\nway that the Sheriff thinks that the word works in sub-\nsection  (f).  But  if  subsection  (f)  directs  the  Sheriff  to\nconduct a strip search of every newly admitted detainee,\nit  also  directs  the  Sheriff  to  conduct  each  search  in\na  dignified  manner,  and  to  refrain  from  conducting  a\nbody-cavity  search  โexcept  where  there  is  reasonable\nsuspicion of contrabandโ.\n\nCasCea: s1e:0:C 60a-9cs-ve3-:00 090925- 53  20   9 DD2oo c c u u m mDeeonncttu :# m0: e06n70t10: 1 3F36i7l e 4 d 3 : 2 F074il e / 2d  8:  F/01i4l0e/ 2dP8:a /0g25e0/ 121000 /  2o  0f   11P03a   gP  e a sPg:e a1IgD3e s#:: 1133701\n10 No. 09-3092\nPlaintiffs have not contended in this suit that the Jailโs\npractice of conducting strip searches of detainees first\nentering the jail violates either the federal Constitution\nor Illinois law. Rather the plaintiffs contend, and the jury\nfound,  that  the  manner  of  the  search  is  unreasonable\nand  thus  violates  the  fourth  amendment  as  well  as\nยง701.40(f). No matter how favorably to the Sheriff sub-\nsection (f) is read, it does not compel him or his staff to\nโ\nperform any of the acts such as having large numbers\nof detainees drop their pants simultaneously to raucous\nโ\nhooting  and  taunts  from  guards  of  both  sexes that\nhave  led to  this litigation  and  the  juryโs verdict.  And\nbecause  no  plausible  understanding  of  subsection  (f)\ntreats it as authorizing, let alone commanding, the chal-\nlenged practices, the major premise of the Sheriffโs ar-\ngument has not been established. (We assume for this\npurpose that the evidence supports the classโs view of\nmatters; an interlocutory appeal under Mitchell does not\nauthorize a court of appeals to resolve factual disputes.\nSee Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304 (1995).)\n2. The minor premise also is wrong. The proposition\nthat anyone who obeys state law must be โthe stateโ is not\nsupported  by  any  rule  or  decision  of  which  we  are\naware. We asked the Sheriffโs lawyer at oral argument if\na business that puts soot scrubbers on its smokestack, in\ncompliance with regulations under the Clean Air Act of\n1970, would be โthe federal governmentโ for purposes\nof  citizen  suits  under  that  statute  (which  therefore\nwould have to be dismissed as barred by sovereign im-\nmunity).

Each\ncounty has a Stateโs Attorney. That official is โthe stateโ\nwhen  representing  the  state  (all  criminal  prosecutions\nare brought in the stateโs name) and โthe countyโ when\nrepresenting the county (which he serves as its lawyer\nin  civil  suits).

But  it  does  not\nfollow from the fact that one person may be an official\nof two different public entities that every person who\nis subject to state or federal law is โthe sovereignโ whose\nlaw  he  obeys.

See 28 U.S.C. ยง1442(a)(1); Watson v. Philip\nMorris Cos., 551 U.S. 142, 151โ52 (2007). A vendor that sells\nproducts  made  strictly  according  to  a  federal  buyerโs\nspecifications is not liable to private persons in tort for\ndefects in those products. See Boyle v.

This is an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and state law challenging several\nunjustified and sexually-intrusive search procedures used on both men and women during the\nbooking/intake process at the Cook County Jail (โCCJโ).  \n2. First, the CCJ maintains a blanket policy requiring that all women placed in its\ncustody undergo a vaginal swabbing, a procedure which involves the insertion of a probe into the\nvagina.  \n3.   There is no legitimate purpose for subjecting detainees to this procedure.  Rather,\nas explained below, it serves only to humiliate and dehumanize the women detainees. While\nDefendants subject all women to this procedure upon their entry into Cook County Jail, it either\n2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 34     Filed 03/31/2006     Page 3 of 27(cid:10)\nceased performing, or significantly restricted the use of the equivalent procedure on male\ndetainees under equivalent circumstances several years ago, after being sued by a male detainee\nin the case of Thompson v. County of Cook, et al., 03-C-7172.    \n4 In addition to lacking any legitimate purpose, the procedures are also performed in\na coercive, unsanitary, and dehumanizing environment.  The examiners often fail to change\ngloves between procedures or otherwise follow usual precautions against the spread of infection. \nMoreover, the women are provided no explanation of what is being done to them.  Indeed, asking\nquestions can be considered recalcitrance which can result in the use of physical force on the\nwoman. \n5.  For example, Plaintiff YOUNG was processed into the CCJ as part of a group of\napproximately 30 women, all of whom were required to undergo the vaginal swabbing.  After it\nbecame clear what was being done to the group, one of the women demanded to know if the\npersonnel performing the procedures were licensed.  In response to her questions, several jail\nguards assaulted this woman in front of the rest of the group.  Plaintiff herself asked what was\nabout to happen to her when she was ordered to place herself on a table and put her legs in\nstirrups.  Her question met with silence and she had to participate without an explanation.  \n6 The CCJ also requires both men and women to undergo strip and body cavity\nsearches during intake/booking.  For men, the procedure requires that they strip naked and line\nup facing a wall shoulder-to-shoulder with tens of other men (and sometimes more than 100)\nwho are also being processed into the jail.  The men are then instructed as a group to bend over\nand spread their buttocks with their hands.  All of the men must remain in this position as guards\nwalk down the row and visually inspects each manโs anal cavity.  Often men are forced to stand\n3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 34     Filed 03/31/2006     Page 4 of 27(cid:10)\nnaked amongst each other in close proximity for thirty-minutes or more.\n7. Women are required to undergo a similar set of searches, but, at least, not in the\npresence of other detainees.  The women must strip naked, bend over and assume a crouched\nposition.  They are then instructed to cough several times as a guard or guards watch.   \n8 These strip and visual body cavity searches are conducted pursuant to a blanket\nprocedure that does not require any particularized suspicion that the detainee is concealing\nanything in his/her cavities.  Moreover, the CCJ requires that these searches be conducted on all\ndetainees at the time they are first brought to the CCJ without regard to the nature of the crime\nfor which they are being held.  In other words, a person arrested for a traffic-related misdemeanor\nwho has not yet been able to raise bail will be subjected to the same invasive search as someone\narrested for much more serious offences.\n9 The CCJ had no justification to force PLAINTIFFS and the members of the class\nto submit to these needlessly invasive searches and/or for forcing them to undergo the procedures\nin such humiliating ways.  Nevertheless, Cook Countyโs policymakers, including Defendant\nSHEAHAN, instituted these unconstitutional procedures and they have turned a blind eye to the\ndehumanizing way in which these searches are conducted.  \n10. Indeed, individuals have sued previously over these practices, but the relatively-\nsmall liability threatened by these individual suits has not been sufficient to cause the\npolicymakers to implement reforms.  Plaintiffs bring this class action to compensate those who\nhave been victimized by these sexually-invasive procedures and, hopefully, to bring change.  \nJurisdiction and Venue\n4\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 34     Filed 03/31/2006     Page 5 of 27(cid:10)\n11.

On the evening of January 13, 2005, Plaintiff YOUNG was driving to her cousinโs\nhouse in Chicago for a funeral.  Her daughter, sister and granddaughters were in the car with her.\n22. Police arrested her on a warrant that was issued after Plaintiff YOUNG had failed\nto appear on a traffic ticket.\n23.  The police took her to the CCJ where she was processed in accordance with the\n7\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 34     Filed 03/31/2006     Page 8 of 27(cid:10)\njailโs usual procedures.  Ms. Young participated in the intake with approximately 30 other\nwomen.  \n24.  First, the women were placed in a line and serially taken behind a partition.  When\nMs. Youngโs turn came, she was ordered to remove all of her clothes and underwear, and was\ntold to squat down in front of a guard.  The guard then told her to cough.  Ms. Young complied\nwith all of the guardโs instructions.  She was required to repeat this procedure three times before\nbeing allowed to dress again. \n25.   Later, the approximately 30 women were led to a hallway lined with chairs, where\nthey were ordered to sit and wait.  Periodically, a woman emerged from a room off the hallway to\ncall numbers assigned to the detainees.  When their numbers were called, the detainees were\nmade to enter the room.\n26.  When the woman called Ms. Youngโs number, she entered the room and was told\nto sit at one of three tables.  A woman, who was dressed in street clothes drew two tubes of blood\nfrom Ms. Youngโs arm. When Young asked the woman why her blood was being taken, the\nwoman did not respond.   \n27.   Ms. Young was then sent to sit in the hallway again.  Approximately twenty\nminutes later, she was called back into the room, but this time she was led behind a partition.  A\nwoman ordered Young to remove her clothes again saying, โweโre going to examine you.โ When\nYoung asked what she was being examined for, the woman responded โjust get on the table.โ\nYoung protested, telling the woman that she expected to be bonded out of the jail soon.  Ms.\nYoung was ordered to climb on to the examining table and place her feet in stirrups.\n8\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 34     Filed 03/31/2006     Page 9 of 27(cid:10)\n28.    The woman proceeded to perform a vaginal swab on Ms. Young which included \ninserting a speculum and other probes into Ms. Youngโs vaginal cavity.  \n29.   Ms. Young was never given any paper to read or sign before any of these\nprocedures were performed on her, nor was she asked any questions about her medical status or\nhistory.\n30.   After the procedure, Ms. Young was instructed to return to the hall, where she\nwaited while the other women underwent the same procedure.\n31.   At one point, while Ms. Young was sitting in the hallway, one of the female\ndetainees demanded to know if the person drawing blood was licensed.  When this person\nresponded that she was not licensed, the woman refused to enter the room with her. The woman\nresponded, โweโre going to show you,โ or words to that effect.  Soon guards arrived, physically\nabused the protesting detainee, and took her away.\n32.   Neither Ms. Young nor any of the other women in her presence were asked to\nconsent to these procedures nor were the nature or purpose of the procedures explained to them.\n33.    On information and belief, the persons administering these procedures were\nemployees or agents of the Cook County Department of Health and of Cermak Health Services.  \n34.   On January 15th, approximately 36 hours after being arrested, Ms. Young was\nbrought before a judge and was released from Cook County Jail.  While being checked out of the\njail, Ms. Young asked the woman processing her paperwork if she could see the results of the \nprocedures.  The woman laughed at this request, and said โyou better get out of here now.โ\n35.   On April 18, 2005, Plaintiff JOHNSON was booked into CCJ after having been\ncharged with possession of a controlled substance, a false charge of which he was later acquitted. \n9\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 34     Filed 03/31/2006     Page 10 of 27(cid:10)\n36.   Mr. Johnson went through the intake process with approximately 100 other men. \nThese men were all ordered into a crowded hallway and then instructed to strip naked as a group. \nThey remained naked in each otherโs presence for more than thirty minutes.  The ventilation was\ninsufficient and the air stank of body odor.\n37.   At one point they were told to face a wall, bend over, and spread their buttocks\nwith their hands.  They had to remain in that position as guards walked down the row visually\ninspecting them.  Several of the guards made comments that the men were un-bathed and stank.   \n38.   The following day, Mr. Johnson was released from CCJ and placed on home\nmonitoring.\n39.   On December 30, 2005, Plaintiff William Jones was riding in a friendโs car when\nthe friend was pulled over by Palatine police.  Upon checking the identity of the vehicleโs\noccupants,  the officers discovered an outstanding warrant for Mr. Jones, issued after he had\nfailed to appear at a hearing regarding a traffic offense.  They therefore arrested him.\n40.   The police took Mr. Jones to CCJ where he was processed in accordance with the\njailโs usual procedures.  Mr. Jones participated in the intake with approximately 100 other men.\n  41.   These men were all ordered into a crowded hallway and then instructed to strip\nnaked as a group.  They remained naked in each otherโs presence for approximately 40 minutes. \nThere was no heat in the hallway, and the temperature felt to be less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\nMany of the men were shivering. In addition, the ventilation was insufficient and the air stank of\nbody order.\n  42.   At one point a guard  told the men to put their head on one of the hallway walls,\nwhich were filthy, bend over, and spread their buttocks with their hands.  They had to remain in\n10\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 34     Filed 03/31/2006     Page 11 of 27(cid:10)\nthat position as a guard walked down the row visually inspecting them.    \n  43.   During the 40 minute period, the guards repeatedly engaged in hazing behavior,\npoking fun at the men and trying to โput them in their placeโ with teasing commands. \nClass Allegations\n44.   Cook County Jail is one of the largest detention centers in the world.  Hundreds of\nmen and women are brought into Cook County Jail each day, amounting to approximately\n100,000 people per-year.  Each person booked into Cook County Jail is subjected to the intake\nprocedures described herein.\n45.   Named Plaintiffs YOUNG, JOHNSON, and JONES (the โNamed Plaintiffsโ) seek\nto pursue claims both for themselves and for a class of others similarly situated.  Named\nPlaintiffs believe that the class should be organized into the following four subclasses.\n46.   Class I consists of:\nAll women who have been subjected to vaginal swabbing in connection with the\nintake procedures at the Cook County Jail at anytime on or after January 30, 2004. \nClass I brings claims pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Due Process Clause and the Equal\nProtection Clause.  Plaintiff YOUNG seeks to represent this class.\n47.  The individuals in Class I are so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpractical.  The Named Plaintiffs estimate that Class I numbers in at least the thousands.\na. On information and belief, approximately 200,000 persons have been\nbooked into the Cook County Jail during the Class Period.  A substantial percentage of these\npersons are women;\nb.  On information and belief, all women booked into Cook County Jail\nduring the Class Period have been subjected to the challenged swabbing procedure; and\n11\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 34     Filed 03/31/2006     Page 12 of 27(cid:10)\nc.  Ms. Young herself witnessed at least 30 women being subjected to the\nprocedure.\n48.   There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of Class I.  Among\nthese common questions are:\na. Whether there is any legitimate purpose for subjecting the female\ndetainees to the swabbing procedure;\nb . Whether there is any sufficient justification for continuing to subject\nwomen to the swabbing procedure when the CCJ discontinued or curtailed subjecting men to the\nequivalent procedure under equivalent circumstances;\nc.  Whether the use of the procedure and/or the way in which it is conducted\nis an  unreasonable search;\nd.

This is an action purS\\llllJtto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and state law challenging the use of \nseveral unjustilied and sexually-intrusive search procedures on both men and women at the Cook \nCounty Jail (\"CC1\"). \n2.  First, the CCJ maintains a blanket policy requiring that all women placed in its \ncustody undergo a vaginal swabbing, a procedure which involves the insertion of a probe into the \nvagina. \n3.  There is no legitinlale purpose for subjecting detainees to this procedure.  Rather, \nas explained below, it is used only to humiliate and dehumanize the women detainees. Tellingly, \nDelendants ceased perlbm1ing the equivalent procedure on male detainees several years ago, \nafter being sued be a male detainee in the case of Thompson v. County of Cook, 03-C-7I72. \n4  Tn addition to lacking any legitimate purpose, the procedures are also perfonned in \na coercive and dehumanizing environment.  The women are provided no explanation of what is \nbeing done to them.  Indeed, asking questions is treated as a form of recalcitrance which can \nresult in the use of physical force on the woman. \n5.  For example, Plaintiff YOUNG was processed into the eCJ as part of a group of \napproximately 30 women, all of whom were required to undergo the vaginal swabbing.  After it \n2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 1     Filed 01/30/2006     Page 3 of 25(cid:10)\nbecame clear what was being done to the group, one of the women demanded to know if the \npersonnel performing the procedures were licensed.  In response to her questions, several jail \nguards assaulted this woman in front of the rest orthe group.  Plaintiff herself asked what was \nabout to happen to her when she was ordered to place herself\" on a table and put her legs in \nstirrups.  Her question met with silence and she had to participate without an explanation. \n6  The CCl also requires both men and women to undergo strip and body cavity \nsearches when being processed into the jail.  For men, the procedure requires that they strip \nnaked and line up facing a wall shoulder-to-shoulder with tens of other men (and sometimes \nmore than 100) who arc also being processed into the jail.  The men are then instructed as a \ngroup to bend over and spread their buttocks with their hands.  All of the men must remain in \nthis position as guards walk down the row and visually inspects each man's anal cavjty.  Often \nmen arc forced to stand naked amongst each other in close proximity fl.lr thirty-minutes or more. \n7.  Women are required to undergo a similar set of searches, but, at least, not in the \npresence of other detainees.  'Jbe women must strip naked, bend over and assume a crouched \nposition.  They are then instructed to cough several times as a guard or guards watch. \nI;  These strip and visual body cavity searches arc conducted pursuant to a blanket \nprocedure that does not require any particularized suspicion that the detainee is concealing \nanything in hisfher cavities.  Moreover, the CCJ requires that these searches be conducted on all \ndetainees at the time they are first brought to the CC.J without regard to the nature of the crime \nfor which they are being held.  In other words, a person arrested fi.1f a traffic-related misdemeanor \nwho has not yet been able to raise bail will be subjected to the same invasive search as someone \narrested /()r much more serious ofJenees. \n3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 1     Filed 01/30/2006     Page 4 of 25(cid:10)\n9  There was no constitutional jus(iflca(ion for the CCJ to force PLAINTIFFS and \n(he members of (he class to suhmit to these needlessly invasive searches or for forcing them to \nundergo the procedures in such humilia(ing ways.  Nevertheless, Cook County's policymakers, \nincluding Defendant SHEAHAN, instituted these unconstitutional procedures and they have \nturned a blind eye to the dehumani\"ing way in which these searches are conducted. \n1O .  Indeed, individuals have sued previously over these practices, but the relatively-\nsmall liability threatened hy these individual suits has not been sufficient to cause the \npolicymakers to implement refonns.  Plain(ifTs bring this c1a~s action to compensate those who \nhave heen victimized by these sexually-invasive procedures and, hopefully, to bring change. \nJurisdiction and Venue \nII.

On the evening of January 13,2005, Plaintiff YOUNG was driving to her cousin's \nhouse in Chicago I\\.)r a funeral.  Her daughter, sister and granddaughters were in the car with her. \n20.  Chicago police arrested her 011 a warrant that was issued after Plaintiff YOUNG \nhad failed to appear on a traffic ticket. \n21.  The police took her to the CCJ where she was processed in accordance with th\", \njail's usual procedures.  Ms. Young participated in the intake with approximately 30 other \nwomen. \n6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 1     Filed 01/30/2006     Page 7 of 25(cid:10)\n22.  First, the women were placed in a line and ~erially taken behind a partition.  When \nMs. Young's tum came, she was ordered to remove all of her clothes and underwear, and was \ntold to squat down in front of a guard.  The guard then (old her to cough.  Ms. Young complied \nwith all of the guard's instructions.  She was required to repeat (his procedure three times before \nbeing allowed to dress again. \n23.  J, aler, the approximately 30 women were led to a hallway lined with chairs, where \nthey were ordered to sit and wait.  Periodically, a woman emerged from a room ofT the hallway to \ncall numbers assigned to the detainees.  When (heir numbers were called, (he detainees were \nmade to enter the room. \n24.  When the woman called M~. Young's number, she entered the room and was told \nto sit at one of three tables.  A woman, who was dressed in street clothes drew two tubes of hlood \nfrom Ms. Young's arm. When Young asked the woman why her blood was being taken, the \nwoman did not respond. \n25.  Ms. Young was then sent to  in the hallway again.  Approximately twenty \n~it \nminute~ later, she wa~ called back into the room, but this time she was led behind a partition.  A \nwoman ordered Young to remove her clothes again saying, \"we're going to examine you.\" When \nYoung asked what she was being examined for, the woman responded \"just gel on the table.\" \nYoung protested, telling the woman that she expected to bc bonded (lut ofthejail ~oon. Ms. \nYoung was ordered to climb on to the examining table and plaee her feet in stirrups. \n26.  The woman proceeded to perform a vaginal swab on Ms. Young which included \ninserting a speculum and other probes into Ms. Young's vaginal cavity. \n7 \n\n= \nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 1     Filed 01/30/2006     Page 8 of 25(cid:10)\n27_  Ms. Young was never given any paper to read or sign before any of these \nprocedures were perfomled on her, nor was she asked any questions about her medical status or \nhistory. \n28.  After the procedure, Ms. Young was instructed to return to the hall, where she \nwaited while the other women underwent the same procedure. \n29.  At one point, while Ms. Young was sitting in the hallway, one orthe female \ndetainees demanded to know if the person drawing blood was licensed_  When this person \nresponded that she was not licensed, the woman refused to enter the room with her. The woman \nresponded, \"we're going to show you.\"  Soon guards arrived, physically abused the protesting \ndetainee, and took her away. \n30.  Neither Ms_ Young nor any of the other women in her presence were asked to \nconsent to these procedures nor were the nature or purpose of the procedures explained to them. \n31.  On infonnation and belief, the persons administering these procedures were \nemployees or agcnts of the Cook County Department of Health and of CemJak Health Services. \n32.  On January 15th, approximately 36 hours aller being arrested, Ms. Young was \nbrought heforc ajudge and was released from Cook County Jail.  Whik being checked out of the \njail, Ms. Young asked the woman processing her paperwork if she could see the results of the \nmedical procedures.  The woman laughed at this request, and said \"you better get out of here \nnow.\" \n33.  On April J8  ,2005, Plaintiff JOHNSON was booked into CeJ after having been \ncharged with possession of a controlled substance, a false charge of which he was later acquitted. \n34.  Mr. Johnson went through the intake process with approximately 100 other men. \n8 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 1     Filed 01/30/2006     Page 9 of 25(cid:10)\nThese men were all ordered into a crowded hallway and then instrueted to strip naked as a group. \nThey remained naked in eaeh other's presence flu more than thirty minutes.  The ventilation was \ninsufficient and the air stank of body oder. \n35.  At one point they were told to face a wall, bend over, and spread their buttocks \nwith their hands.  They had to remain in that position as guards walked down the row visually \ninspecting them.  Several of the guards made comments that the men were un-bathed and stank. \n36.  The following day, Mr. Johnson was released from CCJ and placed on home \nmonitoring. \nClass Allegatiol1s \n37.  Cook County Jail is one of the largest detention centers in the world.  Hundreds of \nmen and women are brought into Cook County Jail each day, amounting to approximately \n100,000 people per-year.  Each person booked into Cook County Jail is subjected to the intake \nprocedures described herein. \n38.  Named Plaintiffs YOUNG and JOHNSON (the \"Named Plaintifls\") seek to \npursue claims both for themsclves and for a class of others similarly situated.  Named Plaintiffs \nbelieve that the class should be organized into the following four subclasses. \n39.  Class I consists of: \nAll women who have been subjected to vaginal swabbing in connection with the \nintake procedures at the Cook County Jail at anytime on or alter January 30. 2004. \nClass Tb  rings claims pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Due Process Clause and the Equal \nProtection Clause.  Plaintiff YOUNG seeks to represent this class. \n40.  The individuals in Class I are so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpractical.  The Named Plaintiffs estimate that Class I numbers in at least the thousands. \n9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 1     Filed 01/30/2006     Page 10 of 25(cid:10)\na.  On information and belief, approximately 200,000 persons have been \nhooked into the Cook County Jail during the Class Period.  A substantial percentage of these \npersons are women; \nh.  On infomla1ion and be1ieJ~ all women booked into Cook County Jail \nduring the Class Period have been subjected to the challenged swabbing procedure; and \nc.  Ms. Young herse1fwitnessed at least 30 women heing suhjeeted to the \nprocedure. \n41.  There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of Class I.  Among \nthese common questions are: \na.  Whether there is any legitimate purpose for subjecting the female \ndctainees to the swahhing procedure; \nb .  Whether there is any sufficient justification for continuing to subject \nwomen to the swahhing procedure, when the ceJ discontinued subjecting men to the equivalent \nprocedure; \ne.  Whether the use of the procedure and/or the way in which it is conducted \nan  unreasonable search; \nIS \nd.  Whether the usc of the procedure and/or the way in which it is conducted \nviolates the detainees' rights under the Due Process Clause; \ne.  Whether the use of the proeedurc on women when the equivalent \nprocedure on men has heen discontinued violates the women's rights to Equal Protection; \nr \nWhether Cook County maintains an express policy or custom requiring \nthe swabbing procedure, and/or whether the procedure was instituted by a polieymaker(s) of \n10 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 1     Filed 01/30/2006     Page 11 of 25(cid:10)\nCook County, and/or whether the policymakers of Cook County condoned or were deliberately \nindilTerent to the use of the procedure; \ng.  Whether any of Defendants SHEAHAN, BAIRD, KURDOVJCH, \nROTIIENSTEIN, MARTIN, and/or BERSKY failed in their supervi~ory responsibilities to have \ntenninated this procedure; and \nh.  Whether the procedure violates the women's right~ under state law. \n42.  Plaintiff YOUNG's claims are typical of the claims of Class I.  Ms. Young was \ndetained at the CC.T and was subjected to the swabbing procedure in accordance with the ccrs \nusual practices.  She seeks to prove that the procedure violates the Fourth Amendment, the Due \nProcess Clause and the Equal Protection Clause, as well a~ state law, and that each of the \nDefendants is liable. \n43.  Plaintiff Young will fairly and adequately represent the interests of Class l.  She \nhas retained skilled counsel with experience in constitutional and class action litigation to \nrepresent the Class. \n44.  The quesiions oflaw and fact common to Class I predominate over any individual \nIssues. \n45.

Mr. Johnson himself witnessed approximately 100 men being subjected to \nthe procedure. \n47.  There are questions oflaw and fact common to the claims of Class II.  Among \nthese common questions are: \na.  Whether it is unreasonable to conduct group strip and visual hody cavity \nsearches of the men in a manner whieh violates the FOLLrth Amendment; \nb.  Whether the use of group strip and visual hody cavity searches violates the \nmcn's rights under the Due Process Clause; \nc_  Whether the use of a group strip and body cavity search procedure for men \nbut not fClr women violates the Equal Protection Clause; \nd.  Whether Cook County maintains an express policy or custom requiring \nthe group procedure for memhers of Class II, and/or whether the application of the procedure to \nmembers of Class II was instituted hy a Cook County polieymaker(s), and/or whether the \npolieymakers of Cook County condoned Or were deliberately indifferent to the use of the \nprocedure on the members or Class II; \ne.  Whether any of Defendants SHEAHAN and/or BAIRD failed in their \n12 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 1     Filed 01/30/2006     Page 13 of 25(cid:10)\nsupervisory responsibilities to have avoided the use of a group strip and eavity search procedure \nfor the members of Class II; and \nf.  Whether the procedure violates the state Jaw rights of the members of \nClass II. \n48.  Plain(i(TJOHNSON's claims are typical of the claims of Class II.

In support, Defendants state: \nINTRODUCTION \nA visual body cavity search (\"visual search\") is intrusive. But this discomfort pales in \ncomparison to the mayhem unleashed when weapons and contraband slip into the general prison \npopulation. Consequences include assaults, rapes, escape attempts, and murders, the brunt of \nwhich is borne by inmates. A visual search reduces the presence of weapons and contraband, as \nevinced by the voluminous reports of contraband produced by Defendants. \nCourts recognize the realities of jail life demand security be the foremost concern. Visual \nsearches facilitate this end as they impede the flow of weapons and contraband, ensuring the \nsafety of staff, detainees, and society at large. This bulwark against jail violence must remain. \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 2 of 15\nLEGAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Summary Judgment. \nSummary judgment is proper where the record shows no genuine issue of material fact \nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw. Moriarty v.  Svec, 429 F.3d 710, \n716 (7th Cir. 2005). Courts construe the record in favor of the non-moving party. ld. Summary \njudgment is necessary as to both classes of Plaintiffs because no Constitutional violation exists. \nB.  Fourth Amendment. \nBefore considering the propriety of qualified immunity,  courts  first  ask whether the \nConstitution was violated.  Payne  v.  Pauley,  337 F.3d 767,  780  (7th Cir.  2003).  The Fourth \nAmendment protects \"against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. Amend. IV. But \nFourth Amendment protections are diminished in a correctional setting. Hudson v.  Palmer, 468 \nU.S.  517 (1984).  Moreover, \"courts prudently are deferential to the experienced judgment of \nprison administrators.\" Fernandez v.  Rapone, 926 F.Supp. 255, 260-61  (D. Mass.  1996). The \nfollowing cases embody these points. \nThe seminal case on visual search policies is Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979). Bell \naddressed the very issue before this Court. The facility in Bell mandated everyone \"expose their \nbody cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every contact visit \nwith a person from  outside the  institution.\" ld.  at 558.  The  policy encompassed everyone, \nincluding serious and lesser offenders, and even witness protection participants. ld. at 524. The \nCourt upheld the visual search policy. It determined that officers may conduct a search without \nprobable cause if it is reasonable and not motivated by punitive intent. The reasonableness of a \nsearch is determined by \"balancing ... the need for the particular search against the invasion of \npersonal rights that the search entails.\" ld. at 559. In doing so, the Court considered \"the scope of \nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and \nthe place in which it is conducted.\" ld. \nThe justification for the searches and their location motivated the Court. \"A detention \nfacility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers.  Smuggling of money, drugs, \nweapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence.\" Bell, 441  U.S. at 559. This \nrationale  led  the  Court  to  conclude  a  visual  search  conducted  regardless  of offense  or \nindividualized suspicion was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \n2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 3 of 15\nWhile the  Supreme Court has not revisited prison search policies, it built on Bell in \nHudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984). Hudson considered whether an inmate has a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in his prison cell. Weighing the societal interests in the security of penal \ninstitutions against the privacy interests of inmates, the Supreme Court favored  institutional \nsecurity. \"The recognition of privacy rights for prisoners in their individual cells simply cannot \nbe  reconciled  with  the  concept  of incarceration  and  the  needs  and  objectives  of penal \ninstitutions.\" Id. at 526. The Court observed that prison officials must be \"ever alert to attempts \nto introduce drugs and other contraband into the premises which, we can judicially notice, is one \nof the most perplexing problems  of prisons today.\" Id.  at 527.  The  Court concluded,  \"it is \naccepted by our society that 'loss of freedom of choice and privacy are inherent incidents of \nconfmement.'\" Id. at 528, quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 537. Bell was also the cornerstone of Blockv. \nRutherford, 468 U.S. 576 (1984). In Block, the Supreme Court upheld a jail policy prohibiting \ncontact visits for pretrial detainees. Id.  at 588. A blanket prohibition on contact visits furthered \nsecurity interests because visitors could smuggle contraband. Id. at 586. \nC.  Summation. \nWhile inmates retain some privacy rights, their expectations of privacy are diminished. \nThis is reflected by the following. Officers may search cells at random. Hudson, 468 U.S. at 528. \nOfficers can search inmates after seeing visitors. Bell, 441  U.S.  at 537.  Officers can search \ninmates after visiting the prison library or hospital. Peckham v.  Wise. Dep't. of Corrections, 141 \nF.3d 694  (7th Cir.  1998).  Finally,  inmates  may  be monitored while  showering.  Johnson  v. \nPhelan, 69 F.3d 144 (7th Cir. 1995). It is in this milieu that the Plaintiffs' claims are evaluated.! \nARGUMENT \nSecurity in a jail is paramount. This priority curtails the freedoms  of inmates.  While \nofficers do  not have carte  blanche to  impinge on inmates' rights, these  axioms afford jails \nsignificant discretion to implement security measures. Plaintiffs seek to dismantle a fixture of \ncorrectional facilities.  In so  doing, they elevate inmates'  privacy interests to  the  neglect of \ninstitutional security. \"Privacy is the thing most surely extingnished by a judgment committing \nThe factual background is  set forth  in the Defendants'  Motion for  Summary Judgment based on  Qualified \nI \nImmunity and incorporated herein. \n3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 4 of 15\nsomeone to prison.\" Id.  at 146. Because an inmate's expectation of privacy is incompatible with \nconstant surveillance, conrts resolve this tension in favor of the correctional facilities. \nA.  The Searches are Reasonable Because no Individualized Suspicion is \nRequired. \nThe purpose of the Cook County Department of Correction's (\"CCDOC\") search policy \nis two-fold:  discovery and deterrence.  The  benefits are  innumerable.  Searching  detainees  at \nintake uncovers a baffling array of items. They include not only transparently troublesome things \nsuch as drugs and weapons, but also inherently innocuous items that can be transformed into \ntools of violence. The specter of being searched also serves the critical function of deterrence. \nThose  who  know  of the  search's  thoroughness  may  refrain  from  attempting  to  smuggle \ncontraband. \n1.  Bell Forecloses Plaintiffs' Claims. \nThe facility in Bell had a policy that did not require individualized suspicion. Its policy \napplied to pretrial detainees, prisoners under writs of habeas corpus, \"witnesses in protective \ncustody, and persons incarcerated for contempt.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 524. Thus, the policy applied \nto even those charged with no wrongdoing. If post-visit visual searches for everyone, including \nthose in protective custody, are acceptable, it is difficult to discern how the CCDOC's policy is \nunreasonable. Defendants' underlying premise is straightforward: Bell controls this case. \nPlaintiffs  attack the  CCDOC's blanket policy.  Yet,  the  policy in Bell was just that. \nIndividualized suspicion was not necessary in Bell. It is not required here. Moreover, the basis \nfor  Plaintiffs'  incarceration  need  not  induce  the  search.  The  search's  raison  d'etre  is  the \ndetainee's  destination,  the  CCDOC.  Criminal  history  and  particularized  suspicion  are \ninconsequential. This is the lesson of Bell. \nBell and its progeny emphasize institutional security. This factor sounds the death knell \nof Plaintiffs' case. \"The prisoner's expectation of privacy always [must] yield to what must be \nconsidered the  paramount interest in institutional  security.\"  Hudson,  468  U.S.  at  528.  The \nEleventh Circuit elaborated that conrts intervene only if searches \"are devoid of penological \nmerit and imposed simply to inflict pain.\" Harris v.  Ostrout, 65 F.3d 912, 916 (lIth Cir. 1995). \nThe importance of Defendants' interest is indisputable: \"central to all other corrections goals is \nthe institutional consideration of internal security within the corrections facilities themselves.\" \n4 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 5 of 15\nPell v.  Procunier, 417 U.S.  817,  823  (1974).  The Seventh Circuit explained, Bell v.  Wolfish \n\"emphasized what is the animating theme of the Court's prison jurisprudence for the last twenty \nyears: the requirement that judges respect hard choices made by prison administrators.\" Johnson, \n69 F.3d at 145. Bell's elevation of institutional security disposes of Plaintiffs' contentions. \nThe Bell Court held that visual searches of every facility inhabitant were reasonable. Bell \nestablishes that the Fourth Amendment does not require individualized cause for a visual search. \nBecause Plaintiffs'  theory of constitutional injury depends upon such  a Fourth Amendment \nreading, Plaintiffs' claims fail as a matter oflaw. \n2.  Precedent Supports the CCDOC's Search Policy. \nThe Seventh Circuit and its District Courts recognize that institutional security is an \nintegral factor in the reasonableness calculation. In Campbell v.  Miller, 787 F.2d 217 (7th Cir. \n1986), the  Seventh Circuit upheld a visual search before  and after inmates used the prison \nlibrary. \"Prison authorities could legitimately fear that the library might become a depository into \nand out of which contraband could be smuggled.\" ld.  at 228.  The searches in Campbell are \nnoteworthy because they were conducted without regard to particularized suspicion. Bruscino v. \nCarlson, 854 F.2d 162 (7th Cir.  1988), involved the same facility. Bruscino upheld a manual \nrectal search of inmates returuing to their cells. The court evaluated the search in light of the \nprison's violence  and  \"with proper regard for  the  limited competence of federal judges to \nmicromanage persons.\" ld.  at 165. The reasonableness of the rectal search did not detain the \ncourt long, for the searches revealed \"an impressive quantity and variety of contraband.\" ld. \nAn inmate's challenge to a strip search policy was at issue in Peckham, 141 F.3d 694 (7th \nCir.  1998). The search was \"a visual inspection of a naked inmate without intrusion into the \nperson's body cavities.\" ld. at 695. Officers conducted this search when prisoners returned from \nanother facility,  court,  or a  contact visit.  The  search was  not predicated on individualized \nsuspicion. The Seventh Circuit upheld the policy, \"it is difficult to conjure up too many real-life \nscenarios where prison strip searches of inmates could be said to be unreasonable.\" ld. at 697. In \nDaughtery v.  Harris, the Tenth Circuit approved of a policy at a federal prison subjecting all \ninmates to a rectal cavity search before being placed in the custody of U.S. Marshals. 476 F.2d \n292 (10th Cir. 1973). The court held, \"this policy of allowing rectal searches must be considered \nreasonable unless contradicted by a showing of wanton conduct.\" ld. at 294. \n5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 6 of 15\nDistrict Courts in the Seventh Circuit have found individualized suspicion inapplicable in \nthe reasonableness determination. Detainees challenged a CCDOC policy mandating all new \ndetainees submit to a visual search in Roscom v.  Chicago,  570 F.Supp. 1259 (N.D. Ill. 1983). \nThe court upheld the search, reasoning that Bell \"does not require a showing of probable cause \nfor visual strip searches of pretrial detainees.\" ld. at 1262. It concluded the jail may reasonably \nconsider any detainees \"could be carrying weapons or contraband ... irrespective of the crimes \ncharged.\" ld. Whether a strip search and manual cavity search were reasonable was the focus of \nVasquez v.  Gempeler, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57168 (W.D. Wis. 2008). As to the strip search, \nthe court held,  \"they are legal under circuit precedent,  even if defendants did not have any \nparticularized suspicion that plaintiff had unauthorized items.\" ld. at *2. The court also found the \nmanual cavity search reasonable because legitimate security concerns existed. ld. at *3. \nThese decisions are the blueprint for adjUdicating this matter. The approval of analogous \npolicies warrants the same result here. That institutional security is fostered by a visual search is \na proposition so evident it needs no illustration. This principle reveals the flaw of Plaintiffs' suit. \n3.  Case Law Misconstruing Bell is Suspect. \nDespite  the  above  cited  precedent  and  Bell's  holding  that  searches  do  not  reqUire \nparticularized suspicion, some cases have held to the contrary. They are incorrect. Their reliance \nis dubious because they shun Bell and disregard the deference to state correctional fucilities. See \nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 85 (1987). \"Where a state penal system is involved, federal courts \nhave  . .  . additional  reason to  accord deference  to  the appropriate prison authorities.\" The \nfollowing are examples of Bell's misapplication. \na.  Appellate Decisions. \nThe Ninth Circuit considered the viability of a blanket search procedure in Kennedy v. \nLos Angeles Police Dep 't., 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir. 1989), overruled on other grounds, Hunter v. \nBryant, 502 U.S. 224 (1991). The court held a policy requiring a visual search of all persons \narrested for felonies violated the Fourth Amendment. ld at 716. The Second Circuit held that \nstrip searching detainees charged with misdemeanors absent reasonable suspicion violated the \nFourth Amendment. Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 66 (2d Cir. 2001). See also Roberts v. Rhode \nIsland, 239 F.3d 107 (1st Cir. 2001) (strip searching all arrestees held unconstitutioual). While \n6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 7 of 15\nnot  binding,  these  cases  demonstrate  the  departure  from  Bell as  they  infuse  a  reasonable \nsuspicion standard that Bell never enunciated. \nThe Seventh Circuit considered a search policy that did not account for individualized \nsuspicion in Mary Beth G.  v.  City of Chicago,  723  F.2d 1263  (7th Cir.  1983). A city policy \nmandated female misdemeanants be strip searched in city lockups. The Seventh Circuit found \nBell  distinguishable  \"because  the  particularized  searches  in  that  case  were  initiated  under \ndifferent circumstances.\" Id. at 1272. The plaintiffs in Mary G.  were \"not inherently dangerous \nand ... were being detained only briefly while awaiting bond.\" Id.  The concerns of Bell were \ninapplicable, \"those dangers are [not] created by women minor offenders entering the lockups for \nshort periods while awaiting bail.\" Id.  at 1273. The record supported this fmding, during a one \nmonth period the visual search produced no contraband from minor offenders. Id. \nMary G. is distinguishable. The search in Mary G.  applied to female arrestees at police \nstations, not to all persons booked into the general population of the largest jail in the country. \nThe Plaintiffs have also undergone a Gerstein hearing in which a judge has found probable cause \nto detain them. Moreover, the record here is rife with discoveries of contraband, embodied by \n2,000 pages of contraband reports. This fact clashes with the lack of contraband in Mary G.  The \nsubstantial violence in the CCDOC further distinguishes Mary G.  See Holly v.  Woolfold,  415 \nF.3d  678,  679  (7th  Cir.  2005)  (describing  \"the  dangerous  general-population  area\"  of the \nCCDOC and citing reports of stabbings and murders in the CCDOC). Additionally, Mary G. \nerroneously distinguished Bell on the ground that \"the detainees [in Bell] were awaiting trial on \nserious federal charges after having failed to make bond.\" Id.  at 1272. But the search policy in \nBell encompassed everyone, including witnesses in protective custody. Because its analysis of \nBell is mistaken, Mary G. rests on a frail foundation. \nThe Seventh Circuit jurisprudence discussed above is post Mary G. Cases like Bruscino \nand Peckham represent a retreat from Mary G.'s narrow approach. Mary G. is of no utility here \ndue to the factual distinctions, its misreading of Bell, and recent Seventh Circuit case law. \nb.  District Court Decisions. \nCourts  in  this  District  have  addressed  intake  searches.  The  outcomes  vary.  Some \ndecisions have not given adequate weight to institutional security. Roscom,  discussed above, \ncontrasts with an unpublished decision striking a blanket strip search policy, Gary v.  Hayes, \n7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 8 of 15\n1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13378 (N.D. Ill. 1998). The Gary Court framed the issue as \"whether the \nsearches conducted on female detainees after they had been ordered released from custody by a \njudge is unreasonable under the circumstances.\" Id.  at *36. It struck the policy, reasoning that \nofficials must have \"a reasonable suspicion that the  class  member  is  carrying a weapon or \ncontraband.\" Id. This same policy, as applied to males, was litigated in Bullock v. Sheahan, 2008 \nU.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  59248 (N.D.  Ill.  2008).  The  court invalidated  it because  \"plaintiffs  - as \nindividuals for whom there is no longer any basis for detention - clearly have a privacy interest \nwhich is arguably greater than that of pretrial detainees.\" Id.  at *20. The Bullock Court also \nnoted the paltry amount of contraband discovered. Id. at *22. \nFinally,  in Thompson  v.  Cook County,  428  F.  Supp.  2d 807 (N.D.  Ill.  2006), a jury \nrejected plaintiff's claim that a strip search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The District \nCourt granted his motion for  a new trial.  \"Strip searches at the time of intake of a detainee \naccused of a minor offense violate the Fourth Amendment unless correctional officers have \nreasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the  detainee  is  concealing  contraband.\"  Id.  at  812. \nDefendants offered only non-specific evidence that contraband had been recovered. The court \nrefused to consider the fact plaintiff would commingle with the general population because it \nwould give officials \"a basis for blanket strip searches of detainees irrespective of the presence \nof individualized reasonable suspicion.\" !d. at 815. \nThese cases are distinguishable. Gary and Bullock involved individuals ordered released \nby a judge. The Plaintiffs do not fit that description. They are on their way into the CCDOC \nwhile the plaintiffs in Gary and Bullock were on their way out. The privacy interests in Gary and \nBullock were greater than in the instant case. Thompson is also unhelpful because it involved a \nsingle search, not the search policy itself. The defendants in Thompson offered only non-specific \nevidence of contraband. The 2,000 pages of contraband reports render Thompson inapposite. See \nExhibit 10. Moreover, the plaintiff in Thompson was held in civil contempt, \"incarcerated not to \nbe punished.\" Id. at 887. Thompson did not involve pretrial detainees ordered detained pursuant \nto a Gerstein hearing as here, and thus the case is of marginal significance. \nSummarily rejecting blanket search policies stands Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on \nits head. These cases buoy the delusion that Bell mandates individualized suspicion. It does not. \n8 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 9 of 15\nIt holds  the  opposite.  This  case  affords  the  Court an  opportunity to  clarify the  confusing \npatchwork of cases and restore the central plank of Bell. \n4.  The Eleventh Circuit Reaffirms Bell. \nThe distortion of Bell is pervasive. This phenomenon is noted in a recent en banc decision \nof the Eleventh Circuit, Powell v.  Barrett, 2008 U.S.  App. LEXIS  18907 (11th Cir.  Sept. 4, \n2008). The court, by a vote of 11 to 1, reaffirmed the holding of Bell and lamented its erosion. \nPowell was a detainee class action challenging a jail's search policy. Under the policy \n\"neither the charge itself nor any other circumstance supplied reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat the arrestee might be concealing contraband.\" [d. at *3. Thus, the plaintiffs were searched \n\"solely because they were entering the general population of inmates at the detention facility.\" \n[d.  The search entailed detainees standing naked in a group of up to 40, with each arrestee \n\"visually inspected front and back by deputies.\" [d.  at *5. The policy did not include visual \nsearches.  [d.  at  *42.  After  examining  Bell,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  concluded  Bell  dictated \nupholding the policy, as privacy expectations could not overcome security interests. \nThe Eleventh Circuit addressed cases requiring individualized suspicion for  a search. \nThese cases included not only those emanating from other circuits, but also its own, Wilson v. \nJones, 251 F.3d 1340 (l1th Cir. 2001). The Powell Court rebuked these decisions because they \n\"misread Bell as requiring reasonable suspicion.\" Powell, at *23. It explained that Bell does not \nrequire  reasonable  suspicion before  a  search.  For  Bell required  \"a search  of every inmate \nreturning from a contact visit regardless of whether there was any reasonable suspicion to believe \nthat the inmate was  concealing contraband.\" [d.  at  *24.  The  Eleventh Circuit concluded its \nanalysis by highlighting the opportunity detainees have to hide contraband, noting gang members \n\"have all the time they need to plan their arrests and conceal items on their persons.\" !d. at *45. \nSome courts have emphasized snippets of Bell while gutting its central holding. This \nCourt should endorse the Eleventh Circuit's astute analysis and adhere to Bell. Powell's 11 to I \nvote amplifies Defendants' position. \n5.  The Potential for Weapons and Contraband are at Their Peak During \nInitial Intake. \nThe CCDOC's interest in security is strongest when detainees are booked into the general \npopUlation. Courts recognize this process involves substantial risks to jail security. The record \n9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 10 of 15\nvindicates this view - 2,000 pages of contraband reports. See Exhibit 10. The Sixth Circuit's \nobservations  in upholding  an  intake  search  are  apt:  \"[t]he  security  interests  of the jail in \nconducting a search at this point were strong. [Plaintiff] was about to come into direct contact \nwith the general jail population.\" Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955, 959 (6th Cir. \n1987). The Tenth Circuit made the same determination in Archuleta v.  Wagner, 523 F.3d 1278 \n(10th Cir.  2008).  It upheld a search based on \"the obvious security concerns inherent in a \nsituation where the detainee will be placed in the general prison population.\" Id.  at 1284. The \nFirst Circuit noted that \"[i]ntermingling of inmates is a serious security concern that weighs in \nfavor of the reasonableness, and constitutionality, of the search.\" Roberts v.  Rhode Island, 239 \nF.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 2001). These principles apply here. \nCourts uphold blanket visual searches when inmates transfer to another area of the prison. \nIn Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir. 1983), an inmate challenged a policy mandating visual \nsearches when inmates visited the library, infirmary, and visiting room. Invoking Bell, the First \nCircuit upheld the procedure, noting it was \"most hesitant to  overturn prison administrator's \ngood faith judgments.\" Id. at 887. In Peckham, the Seventh Circuit found a strip search of every \ninmate arriving from another facility or court was reasonable. 141 F.3d at 697. \nThat the CCDOC's procedure concerns individuals entering the facility does nothing to \ndiminish the import of these cases. In fact, the probability of contraband is greater here because \nPlaintiffs are coming from outside the CCDOC. It is at this juncture that Defendants be most \nvigilant. Gang members may get themselves arrested in order to smuggle contraband into prison. \nMoreover, an arresting  officer's pat-down search may miss  items which are then concealed \nduring booking.  These examples  represent real  dangers ameliorated by a visual search.  The \nCCDOC's policy minimizes the risks borne by staff and detainees alike. \nIf searches after trips to the hospital, trips to the library, and trips to other wings are \nreasonable,  logic  dictates  that  searches  of those  entering  the  facility  from  the  outside  are \nacceptable. This is a natural application of Bell, confirmed by eleven judges on the Eleventh \nCircuit, and grounded in common sense. \n6.  The Felon and Non-Felon Dichotomy is False. \nCourts have fixated on the charges of a detainee in calculating the reasonableness of an \nintake search. The precise date and locus of this notion's birth are unknown, but it has led a \n10 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 11 of 15\nrobust life. However, whether a detainee is charged with a felony or some lesser offense has no \nbasis in Supreme Court prison search jurisprudence. \nThe Eleventh Circuit criticized this distinction in Powell. It pointed to Masters v. Crouch, \n872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir. 1989) and Mary G., 723 F.2d 1263. Powell at *31. The Eleventh Circuit \nwas blunt: \"[t]hose decisions are wrong. The difference between felonies and misdemeanors or \nother lesser offenses is without constitutional significance . . . [and] finds no basis in the Bell \ndecision, in the reasoning of that decision, or in the real world of detention facilities.\" Id. at *32. \nThe Eleventh Circuit is correct.  Bell is  silent as  to  detainee  status.  Instead, Bell upheld the \nblanket policy Plaintiffs now ask the Court to strike. \nThe Eleventh Circuit singles out the Seventh Circuit, and rightly so. Citing Mary G., the \nEleventh  Circuit notes,  \"[t]he  MCC  was hardly  a  facility  where  all  of the  detainees  were \n'awaiting trial on serious federal charges,' as some of the opinions incorrectly state.\" !d. at *33, \nquoting Mary G. Thus, cases that have distinguished Bell on the basis that it involved dangerous \noffenders are mistaken. See also Aruda, 710 F.2d at 887-88 (1st Cir. 1983) (\"the strip searches in \n[BelT] were not restricted to particularly dangerous prisoners.\"). Bell made no distinction for less \ndangerous  detainees,  or  even  witness  protection participants.  These  facts  render  Plaintiffs' \ncontentions futile because misdemeanants need not be excepted. \nClaiming  a  detainee's  non-felon  status  immunizes  him from  search  ignores  Bell on \nmultiple grounds. First, Bell articulated no such distinction. Second, the test is \"whether a prison \nsearch policy is  'reasonable'  under the circumstances.\" Aruda, 710  F.2d at 887.  Instead of \nconcluding the search is suspect because the detainee is a minor offender, a court must undertake \na balancing of interests. The central factors in that evaluation are the \"why\" and \"where\" of the \nsearch. But some cases bypass these fundamental questions, with predictable results. \nWhether a detainee is charged with a felony or misdemeanor is a distinction without a \ndifference. Finding to the contrary will have deleterious consequences for correctional facilities, \nas  this  approach  underestimates  the  criminal  mindset.  Gangs  may  exploit  the  disjunctive \ntreatment between offenders. The Eleventh Circuit concurs. Officials do not know whether a \ndetainee is \"only a minor offender or is also a gang member who got himself arrested so that he \ncould serve as a mule smuggling contraband in to other members.\" Powell, at *36. Endorsing the \nfelony-misdemeanor dichotomy frustrates security. This Court should reject it. \n11 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 12 of 15\n7.  Summation. \nKeeping contraband out of the CCDOC is a task of Sisyphean proportions. Defendants \nhave devised a search policy they deem most effective to detect contraband. The Court should \ndefer  to  this  determination.  Blanket  search  policies  that  encompass  minor  offenders  and \ntranscend individualized suspicion have the imprimatur of the Supreme Court. \nB.  The Manner of the Searches is Reasonable. \nPlaintiffs  renounce  the  manner  in  which  the  searches  occurred,  particularly  the \nintrusiveness of the search and its public nature. But courts \"accord substantial deference to the \nprofessional judgment of prison administrators, who bear a significant responsibility for defining \nthe  legitimate  goals  of a  corrections  system.\"  Overton  v.  Bazzetta,  539  U.S.  126,  132 \n(2003).  The burden is not on the Defendants to prove the validity of the policy but on Plaintiffs \nto disprove it. fd. In view of the rejection of similar claims, neither class of Plaintiffs can prevail. \n1.  Group Searches Are Permissible. \nCourts hold that visual  searches  in the  presence  of other inmates  and  staff are  not \nconstitntionally defective. This is so because of security concerns. In Elliott v.  Lynn, 38 F.3d \n188 (5th Cir.  1994), the Fifth Circuit held visual searches conducted before other inmates and \ncorrectional  officers  were  reasonable  because  of security.  A  District  Court  in  this  Circuit \nentertained the question in Zunker v. Bertrand, 798 F.Supp. 1365 (E.D. Wis. 1992). \"Visual body \ncavity searches conducted after contact visits as a means of preventing inmates' possession of \nweapons  and  contraband,  even  absent  probable  cause,  have  been found  reasonable  by the \nSupreme Court.\" !d. at 1369. The court held, \"plaintiff's privacy interest in not having other \ninmates view the strip searches [did not] outweigh[] the security interests of the prison in this \ncase.\" fd. at 1370. The presence of other inmates during a strip search was found reasonable in \nDifilippo v.  Vaughn, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8823 at *6 (E.D. Pa. 1996). The District Court in \nFernandez v. Rapone, 926 F.Supp. 255 (D. Mass. 1996), held similarly. Strip searching inmates \nin front of others \"does not render the searches unreasonable [because a] person's expectation of \nprivacy is unquestionably diminished when he is incarcerated.\" fd. at 262. \nThe correctional context necessitates a loss of privacy. That inmates lack a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy in their unclothed bodies is also evident from the decisions upholding \nobservation of inmates during showers. Phelan,  69 F.3d at 146 (7th Cir.  1995). In Burge v. \n12 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 13 of 15\nMurtaugh,  2007  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  90736  (N.D.  Ind.  2007),  the  court  considered  whether \nsurveillance of inmates in the shower violated the Fourth Amendment. It did not, for \"the privacy \ninterests of the inmate almost always must yield.\" Id. at *4-5. In Rhoden v.  DeTella, 1995 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 17354 at *10 (N.D. Ill. 1995), the court found no violation of a prisoner's right to \nprivacy where officials were able to view him in the shower.  These cases, while outside the \nsearch context, reinforce the view that institutional security cannot be undermined by detainees' \nprivacy demands. That Plaintiffs are searched in front of others is insignificant given the realities \nofj ail life. \n2.  Searches in Areas of Limited Privacy Are Permissible. \nPlaintiffs  argue  the  area  where  the  searches  occurred  is  unsuitable.  Case  law  says \notherwise.  In  Del Raine  v.  Williford,  32  F.3d  1024  (7th  Cir.  1994),  the  Seventh  Circuit \nconsidered a challenge to a digital rectal search that transpired in the \"lobby area\" of a prison. \nThe court upheld the search.  It determined the circumstances warranted the  location of the \nsearch. The court concluded, \"[t]his court will not intervene in decisions within the purview of \nthe warden and the Bureau of Prisons. The decision to initiate different methods to search for \ncontraband is not for this court to make in this case.\" Id. at 1042. \nThe  Eighth  Circuit reached  a  similar conclusion in Franklin  v.  Lockhart,  883  F.2d \n654 (8th Cir. 1989). An inmate in Franklin challenged the manner and place in which officers \nconducted visual searches - in the hallway where other inmates could watch. Security concerns \njustified the procedure and since the record did not support a less public method, the searches \nwere  constitutional. Id.  at  657.  Finally,  the  Ninth  Circuit held hallway  strip  searches were \nreasonable. Michenfelder v.  Sumner, 860 F.2d 328 (9th Cir.  1988). It reasoned, \"so long as a \nprisoner is presented with an opportunity to obtain contraband or a weapon while outside of his \ncell, a visual strip search has a legitimate penological purpose.\" Id. at 333. \nPlaintiffs' disdain for being searched is not without merit. As the Seventh Circuit has \nobserved,  \"[t]here  is  no  question  that  strip  searches  may  be  unpleasant,  humiliating  and \nembarrassing to prisoners.\" Calhoun v.  Detella, 319 F.3d 936,939 (7th Cir. 2003). But in the \nsame breath, the Court admonished, \"not every psychological discomfort a prisoner endures \namounts to a constitutional violation.\" Id.  Because privacy expectations are at a nadir in jails, \nconducting searches in a group setting and public area do not implicate constitutional concerns. \n13 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 14 of 15\n3.  The Conditions Surrounding the Search Are Immaterial. \nPlaintiffs' affidavits devote significant attention to the obscene language of officers and \nthe unpleasant conditions. Such issues are irrelevant to this Motion. The two classes of Plaintiffs \nare defmed not on the surroundings of the search, but on the type of search (visual) and the type \nof the  offense  charged  (less  than  a  felony).  Moreover,  case  law rejects  any  notion  these \nconditions are actionable as articulated here. Verbal abuse by correctional employees does not \nstate a constitutional claim. Emmons v. McLaughlin, 874 F.2d 351, 353 (6th Cir. 1989); Mitchell \nv. Justus, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36656 at *3 (W.D. Vir. 2006). One Northern District Court's \ncomments are noteworthy, \"[tJhe court notices judicially that foul language and name-calling \noccur all of the time in prison settings.\" Joyner v. Elrod, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23519 (N.D. Ill. \n1985). If such occurrences were actionable, \"our courts would become arbitrators in thousands of \nprisoner complaints deciding how actionably obscene was the language.\" [d.  at *2. Plaintiffs' \ncleanliness concerns are likewise irrelevant and precluded by precedent. Unpleasant odors are a \nnatural consequence of prisons and the Constitution does  not prohibit discomfort. Rhodes v. \nChapman,  452 U.S.  337,  349 (1981).  In sum,  Plaintiffs' displeasure with the context of the \nsearch has no bearing on this Motion. \n4.  Summation. \nPolicies have consequences. Adopting Plaintiffs' position will inhibit Defendants' job of \nscreening for contraband. It will also exacerbate an already precarious environment. Striking the \nsearch policy represents the \"unguided substitution of judicial judgment for that of the expert \nprison  administrators\"  the  Supreme  Court  deemed  \"inappropriate.\"  Bell,  441  U.S.  at  554. \nPrecedent, deference, and policy coalesce to warrant a finding that Defendants are entitled to \nsummary judgment on both classes. \nC.  Plaintiffs' Due Process and Equal Protection Claims Fail. \nThe  Fourteenth Amendment states,  \"nor shall  any  State  deprive  any  person of life, \nliberty, or property, without due process of law.\" Due process claims are examined in two steps. \nFirst, the plaintiff must demonstrate that a liberty interest exists that the state interfered with, and \nsecond, whether the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient. \nLekas v. Briley, 405 F.3d 602, 607 (7th Cir. 2005). Defendants have established that Plaintiffs' \nFourth Amendment claims fail as a matter of law. A court has found probable cause to detain \n14 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 205      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 15 of 15\nPlaintiffs per Gerstein. (S.O.F. 21-22). Thus, Plaintiffs' due process assertions cannot stand as \nDefendants have not interfered with any liberty interest. \nPlaintiffs'  equal protection claim also fails.  Detainees must be treated equally, unless \nunequal treatment bears a rational relation to a legitimate penal interest. May v.  Sheahan, 226 \nF.3d 876, 882 (7th Cir.  2000). But the detainees are not similarly situated. Males outnumber \nfemales about eight to one. (S.O.F.  11). The different treatment is rationally related to security \nconcerns as the large number of men requires that they be searched in a different area of the jail \nand a  different manner.  (S.O.F.  42-43).  Males must be strip  searched before  going to their \nhousing divisions. (S.O.F. 14-15). Any other arrangement would impermissibly slow the process \nsuch that detainees would not reach their housing division until the following day. (S.O.F. 50-\n52). In sum, logistical and budgetary realities render any effort to treat the genders the same \nimpossible. These immutable facts foreclose Plaintiffs' equal protection claim. \nCONCLUSION \nWhat  ultimately  differentiates  this  case  from  Northern  District  and  Seventh  Circuit \nprecedent is the 2,000 pages of contraband reports.  These pages are fatal to Plaintiffs' cause \nbecause they breathe life into the dry, arcane, listless legal terms of \"penological interest\" and \n\"institutional security.\" It is these reports that document the crises averted, the violence that did \nnot befall detainees. Make no mistake, the main beneficiary of the search policy is the detainees \nthemselves. Jail weapons are wielded with equal vigor against misdemeanants and felons, and \nthat is why all entrants to the CCDOC must accept a transient unpleasantness early in order to \nforego a prolonged anguish later. \nWHEREFORE, the Sheriff Defendants respectfully request the Court determine that the \nsearch policy is constitutional and grant sununary judgment as to both classes in their favor. \nDefendants seek any additional relief the Court deems just. \nRespectfully submitted, \nTHE SHERIFF DEFENDANTS \nBy: sl Daniel F.

KENNELLY, District Judge: \n\nKim Young, Ronald Johnson, and William Jones have sued Cook County; three of its\ncurrent employees, Stephen Martin, Jr., Daniel Winship, and David Fagus; three of its former\nemployees, Karen Scott, Ruth Rothstein, and Leonard Bersky; Michael Sheahan, the Cook\nCounty Sheriff; and two of his current employees, Callie Baird and Scott Kurtovich.1  Plaintiffs\nbring their suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, alleging that the defendants violated their Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendment rights while they were incarcerated in the Cook County Jail (CCJ).  The\nCook County defendants and the Sheriff defendants have filed separate motions to dismiss under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  For the following reasons, the Court denies the Cook\nCounty defendantsโ motion in part and grants it in part and denies the Sheriff defendantsโ\nmotion.\nFacts\nAccording to plaintiffsโ second amended complaint, Sheriff Sheahan and two of his high\nlevel staff members, Callie Baird and Scott Kurtovich, have โimplemented, enforced, and/or\ncondonedโ a policy of strip searching every inmate that enters the CCJ.  Second Am. Compl. ยถยถ\n16-17.  This policy allegedly continues despite the fact that for more than twenty years,\nnumerous courts โ including the Seventh Circuit โ have held that suspicionless strip searches of\ndetainees accused of minor offenses are unconstitutional.2  Plaintiffs also allege that the\n1 Cook County and its former and current employees are collectively referred to as the\nโCook County defendants.โ  Sheahan and his employees are collectively referred to as the\nโSheriff defendants.โ\n2 See, e.g., Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64-66 (2d Cir. 2001); Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d\n1340, 1343 (11th Cir. 2001); Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 111 (1st Cir. 2001);\nChapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395 (10th Cir. 1993); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723\nF.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983); Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160, 161 (7th Cir. 1980); Calvin v.\nSheriff of Will County, 405 F. Supp. 2d 933, 942 (N.D. Ill. 2005).\n2\n\nindividual defendants have โimplemented, enforced, or condonedโ a policy requiring all female\ninmates to undergo unconsented sexual transmitted disease (STD) testing.  Id. ยถยถ 16-20. \nYoung claims that on January 13, 2005, she was arrested on an outstanding traffic\nwarrant and taken to the CCJ.  Shortly after arriving there, a female guard made her stand behind\na partition, take her clothes off, squat down, and cough.  Young put her clothes back on, and the\nguard led her, along with thirty other women, to a hallway lined with chairs.  There, the women\nwaited while they took turns going into a small room for STD testing.  When Youngโs name was\ncalled, she entered the room, and a woman ordered her to remove her clothes a second time. \nYoung asked why she was being examined, but the woman simply instructed her to โget on the\ntable.โ  Young followed the womanโs order and put her feet in stirrups.  The woman then\ninserted a probe into Youngโs vaginal cavity.  Young claims that she did not consent to the strip\nsearch or the STD testing.\nJohnson claims that on April 18, 2005, he was arrested for felony possession of a\ncontrolled substance.3  Shortly after he was booked in the CCJ, guards ordered him and one-\nhundred other men to strip naked in a hallway.  The guards then instructed them to face a wall,\nbend over, and spread their buttocks with their hands, as the guards proceeded to visually inspect\nthem.  The men remained naked in each otherโs presence for more than thirty minutes, during\nwhich time the guards made comments that the men were unbathed and stank.  The hallway was\npoorly ventilated, and the air reeked of body odor.  \nPlaintiff Jones claims that on December 30, 2005, he was arrested on an outstanding\ntraffic warrant.  Shortly after he was booked in the CCJ, he, like Johnson, was strip searched in a\n3 Johnson claims that he was not convicted of these charges.\n3\n\nhallway along with one-hundred other men.  There was no heat in the hallway, and the\ntemperature felt like it was less than fifty degrees Fahrenheit.  The men were shivering during\nthe approximately forty minute period they remained in the hallway.  The hallway was poorly\nventilated, and the air reeked of body odor.  Jones alleges that the guards repeatedly poked fun at\nthe men.\nIn Count 1, plaintiffs allege that the vaginal swabbing procedure performed on Young\nviolated the Fourth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.4  In\nCount 2, they allege that the vaginal swabbing procedure performed on Young violated the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In Count 3, plaintiffs allege that the\nstrip searches performed on Johnson and Jones violated the Fourth Amendment and the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In Count 4, plaintiffs allege that because jail\nofficials strip searched Johnson and Jones in a group setting, but did not perform strip searches\non similarly situated females in a group setting, the searches of the men violated the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  In Counts 5 and 6, plaintiffs allege that the\nstrip searches performed on Jones and Young violated the Fourth Amendment and the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Count 7 is a state law claim for respondeat\nsuperior liability against Cook County.  Count 8 is a state law claim of indemnification against\nCook County.\nDiscussion\nWhen considering a motion to dismiss, the Court reads the complaint liberally, granting\n4 Plaintiffโs second amended complaint makes class-wide allegations, though the case has\nnot yet been certified as a class action.  For this reason, we recite the allegations of each count of\nthe complaint as they pertain to each named plaintiff.  \n4\n\nthe motion only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support\nof his claim that entitles him to relief.  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).  We accept\nthe allegations in the complaint as true and draw reasonable inferences in the plaintiffโs favor. \nCler v. Ill. Educ. Assโn, 423 F.3d 726, 729 (7th Cir. 2005).  Under federal pleading rules, a\ncomplaint โneed not set out legal theories or comprehensive factual narratives.โ  See, e.g., Rapid\nTest Prods., Inc. v. Durham School Svcs., Inc., No. 05-4066, โ F.3d โ , 2006 WL 2382430, at\n*2 (7th Cir. Aug. 18, 2006). \nTogether, the defendantsโ motions propose seven different reasons for partial or complete\ndismissal of plaintiffsโ claims.  We consider each argument in turn. \n1.  The individual defendantsโ involvement\nThe individual defendants (those other than Cook County) argue that the complaint fails\nto allege that they were personally involved in the claimed constitutional violations.  An\nindividual cannot be held liable under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 unless he caused or participated in an\nalleged constitutional deprivation.  See Wolf-Lillie v. Sonquist, 699 F.2d 864, 869 (7th Cir.\n1983).  Supervisors may not be held liable under this statute for negligently failing to prevent an\nemployee from engaging in prohibited conduct.  See Lanigan v. Village of East Hazel Crest, 110\nF.3d 467, 477 (7th Cir. 1997).  Rather, โโsupervisors must know about the conduct and facilitate\nit, approve it, condone it, or turn a blind eye for fear of what they might see.โโ Id. (quoting Jones\nv. City of Chicago, 865 F.2d 985, 992-93 (7th Cir. 1988)).\nPlaintiffs sufficiently allege that the individual defendants were personally involved in\nthe alleged constitutional violations.  Specifically, they allege that the defendants โimplemented,\nenforced, or condonedโ the strip search and vaginal swabbing procedures at the CCJ.  Second\n5\n\nAm. Compl. ยถยถ 16-20.  In other words, they are claimed to have had knowledge that guards were\nperforming strip searches and STD testing on all new detainees but failed to intervene.  These\nallegations are sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.  See Gentry v. Duckworth, 65 F.3d\n555, 561 (7th Cir. 1995) (denying defendantโs motion for summary judgment because plaintiff\noffered evidence that the defendant knew that guards were denying the plaintiff constitutionally\nrequired writing materials but failed to intervene).\nThe individual Cook County defendants have also moved to dismiss the claims made\nagainst them in their official capacity, arguing these claims are redundant of the claims asserted\nagainst Cook County.  See DeGenova v. Sheriff of DuPage County, 209 F.3d 973, 975 (7th Cir.\n2000) (โAn official capacity suit is the same as a suit against the entity of which the officer is an\nagent.โ).  Because the plaintiffs do not respond to this argument, they are deemed to have\nconceded the point.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses the official capacity claims against\nMartin, Jr., Winship, Fagus, Scott, Rothstein, and Bersky.\n2. Unwanted medical testing under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\nThe Cook County defendants argue that the Court should dismiss Count 1 of the second\namended complaint because the vaginal swabbing procedure, as alleged, did not violate Youngโs\nFourth or Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Defendants do not dispute that the vaginal swabbing\nprocedure โ if Young did not consent to it โ constitutes unwanted medical treatment.  Nor do\ndefendants deny that Young has a Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest in refusing unwanted\nmedical treatment.  See Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278 (1990). \nRather, defendants argue that they cannot be held liable for the test because if it was performed\nwithout Youngโs consent, they were merely negligent in not recognizing the involuntary nature\n6\n\nof the procedure.  They point out that allegations of negligence ordinarily are not enough to\nestablish liability under ยง 1983.  See Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 330 (1986).\nYoung has alleged that the CCJ has a policy of requiring โall womenโ to undergo the\nvaginal swabbing procedure and that the circumstances of the swabbing procedure are\nโcoercive.โ  Second Am. Compl. ยถ 2.  She also claims that if an inmate refuses or asks a question\nabout the procedure, the guards may use physical force on her or instruct her to perform the\nprocedure without answering her question.  See id. ยถยถ 4-5.  Finally, Young has alleged that the\ndefendants โimplemented, enforced, or condoned the use of procedures challenged in this case.โ \nId. ยถยถ 16-20.  If Young proved that the defendants implemented or condoned a policy requiring\neach female inmate to undergo a vaginal swabbing procedure whether she consented or not, a\njury reasonably could find the defendants were more than negligent in recognizing that the\ntesting violated the inmatesโ Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Indeed, these allegations, if taken as\ntrue (as the Court must do at this stage of the case), suggest that the defendants knowingly\nimplemented or condoned a policy of coercing women to take the test or, worse, of forcing\nwomen to take the test despite their outright refusal. \nThe Cook County defendants also argue that the swabbing procedure does not violate the\nFourth Amendment because it is not a search.  As far as the Court can ascertain, it is an open\nquestion whether the Fourth Amendmentโs prohibition against unreasonable searches applies to\nmedical procedures, executed by government actors, that are unrelated to evidence gathering.  At\nleast one court has said that the Fourth Amendment applies only to conduct โmotivated by some\nsort of investigatory or administrative purpose designed to elicit a benefit for the government.โ \nUnited States v. Attson, 900 F.2d 1427, 1430 (9th Cir. 1990).  It does not appear, however, that\n7\n\neither the Supreme Court or Seventh Circuit have spoken directly on the issue.5  Regardless, we\nneed not delve into this issue on a motion to dismiss, having already concluded that Count 1\nstates a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment.  First, allowing the Fourth Amendment claim to\ngo forward does not substantially alter the scope of discovery, if at all.  Second, if, as Attson\nsuggests, the resolution of this issue turns on the governmentโs motivation for performing the\nalleged procedure, then it is impossible at this stage of the litigation to determine what that\nmotivation may have been.  For these reasons, Count 1 states a claim for which relief may be\ngranted, and the Court declines to dismiss Youngโs Fourth Amendment claim.\n3. Cook Countyโs control over the Sheriff\nCook County argues that it cannot be held liable for the acts of the Sheriff because the\nSheriff โis an independently elected constitutional officer who answers to the electorate, not the\nCounty government.โ  See County Mem. at 17-18.  Cook County cites Thompson v. Duke, 882\nF.2d 1180, 1187 (7th Cir. 1989), for the proposition that it cannot be held vicariously liable for\nthe acts of the Sheriff.  It ignores, however, the Seventh Circuitโs more recent pronouncement on\nthe issue, which holds that in Illinois, the county is a necessary party to a suit for damages\nagainst the sheriff.  See Carver v. Sheriff of LaSalle County, 324 F.3d 947, 948 (7th Cir. 2003)\n(โ[A] county in Illinois is a necessary party in any suit seeking damages from an independently\nelected county officer (sheriff, assessor, clerk of court, and so on) in an official capacity.โ); see\nalso Robinson v. Sappington, 351 F.3d 317, 338-39 (7th Cir. 2003) (rejecting Macon Countyโs\n5 In Sullivan v. Bornemann, 384 F.3d 372, 377 (7th Cir. 2004), the court held that the\nFourth Amendment does not prohibit a police officer from briefly restraining a detainee at the\ndirection of qualified medical personnel for the purpose of benefitting the detaineeโs own health. \nThe case does not address, however, whether the Fourth Amendment applies to the medical\nprocedure itself.\n8\n\nargument that it should be dismissed from the plaintiffโs lawsuit alleging that her employer, a\ncircuit court judge, sexually harrassed her, because Macon County would be required to pay any\njudgment). \n4. Strip search performed on Johnson\nThe Sheriff defendants argue that the Court should dismiss Johnsonโs Fourth Amendment\nclaim because a number of courts have held that jail officials may strip search detainees accused\nof felonies or drug crimes.6  See, e.g., Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1089 (6th Cir. 1983)\n(holding that a strip search of a detainee accused of felonious assault does not violate the Fourth\nAmendment); Doe v. Berberich, 704 F. Supp. 269, 272 (D.D.C. 1988) (holding that a strip search\nof a detainee accused of misdemeanor possession of marijuana does not violate the Fourth\nAmendment).  The problem with the cases that the defendants cite, however, is that Johnson\ndoes not dispute that a policy of strip searching accused felons is legal when the search is\nconducted in a reasonable manner.  Rather, he contends that jail officials searched him in a\nfashion that was unnecessarily abusive and humiliating.  \nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Supreme Court said that the test of\nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment involves the consideration of four different factors: \nthe scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for\ninitiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.  Id. at 559.  Examining these factors in the\ncontext of strip searches conducted after contact visits on pretrial detainees accused of serious\n6 The Sheriff defendants have also moved to dismiss the plaintiffsโ class allegations,\narguing that the proposed classes include accused felons who can lawfully be strip searched\nduring the booking process.   The Court declines to address the propriety of the alleged classes,\nhowever, because this objection is premature.  The plaintiffs have not yet filed a motion for class\ncertification. \n9\n\nfelonies, the Court said that โ[a] detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security\ndangersโ and that smuggling of contraband is a real and serious concern for jail administrators. \nId.  Though recognizing as well the significant invasion of privacy that strip searches entail, the\nCourt held that post-contact visit strip searches did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  Id. at\n560.  The Court cautioned, however, that searches carried out in an abusive fashion cannot be\ntolerated.  Id. \nIn this case, we recognize that the scope of a strip search necessarily compromises a\nparticularly serious privacy interest.  As for the second and fourth Bell factors, Johnsonโs\ncomplaint alleges a number of facts that suggest unreasonableness:  the use of threatening or\nharassing language, see Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d 1272, 1281 (11th Cir. 2005), the lack of\nprivacy, including the fact that many others could see Johnsonโs naked body, see Amaechi v.\nWest, 237 F.3d 356, 364 (4th Cir. 2001); Del Raine v. Williford, 32 F.3d 1024, 1040  (7th Cir.\n1994), the significant amount of time it took to complete the search, and the fact that the search\ntook place in a crowded, odorous, poorly-ventilated hallway.\nBalanced against these factors is the governmentโs justification for initiating the search. \nThe defendants, citing a report from the John Howard Association, assert that the strip searches\nare justified to combat โserious security dangersโ at the CCJ.  See Sheriff Mem. at 10.  The Court\nis not permitted, however, to consider these reports on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a\nclaim. Even if we were, Johnson specifically alleges that the Sheriff did not have sufficient\njustification for the strip search procedures.  See Second Am. Compl. ยถ 81.  Taking these\nallegations as true and balancing them with the facts relevant to our consideration of the other\nthree Bell factors, Johnsonโs strip search allegations state a claim on which relief may be\n10\n\ngranted.  In short, without the benefit of evidence concerning the Sheriffโs need to conduct strip\nsearches in the manner performed, the Court cannot determine whether the search performed on\nJohnson was conducted in a reasonable fashion.  For these reasons, Johnsonโs strip search\nallegations state a claim on which relief may be granted.\n5. Finding of probable cause to arrest \nThe Sheriff defendants also argue that the Court should dismiss the defendants Fourth\nAmendment claims because each pretrial detainee arrives at the CCJ after a judicial officer has\nfound that probable cause exists to arrest and detain that individual.  The Sheriff defendants\ncontend that reasonable suspicion to strip search the detainee is inherent in a judgeโs probable\ncause finding.  The Court rejects the argument.  We fail to see how a finding of probable cause to\narrest suggests reasonable suspicion that an individual is concealing contraband, particularly\nwhere the relevant finding is that an individual has allegedly committed a non-violent, non-drug\nrelated misdemeanor or has failed to appear for a hearing in traffic court.  See Shain v. Ellison,\n273 F.3d 56, 65 (2d Cir. 2001) (holding that arraignment of person accused of misdemeanor does\nnot suggest that the person is concealing contraband or weapons).\n6. The Duran consent decree\nThe Sheriff defendants next argue that the Court should dismiss this case in its entirety\nbecause it is barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion.  They state that โthe issue of living\nconditions and treatment of pretrial detainees at the Cook County Jail was decided by the district\ncourt in Duran [v. Sheahan, Case No.74 C 2949].โ  Sheriff Mem. at 13.  This argument is\nlacking in merit for several reasons.\nFirst, as the Sheriff defendants themselves note, issue preclusion โgenerally prevents a\n11\n\nparty from relitigating an issue that has already been litigated.โ  Id. (citing Appley v. West, 832\nF.2d 1021, 1025 (7th Cir. 1987)).  Duran, however, was resolved not by way of litigation and\ndecision, but by a consent decree โ a negotiated resolution approved by the presiding judge. \nBecause the issues underlying consent judgments ordinarily are not actually litigated, such\njudgments normally do not support issue preclusion.  Arizona v. California, 530 U.S. 392, 414-\n15 (2000); La Preferida, Inc. v. Cerveceria Modelo, S.A. de C.V., 914 F.2d 900, 906 (7th Cir.\n1990).\nSecond, the Sheriff defendantsโ contention that the particular issues involved in the\npresent case were also at issue in Duran is utterly unsupported and borders on the frivolous. \nTheir argument is that because Duran concerned โthe treatment and living conditions of pretrial\ndetainees,โ it necessarily included the intake procedures at issue in this case.  Sheriff Mem. at 14. \nThis argument completely misunderstands the doctrine of issue preclusion, which requires the\nidenitical issue involved in the current suit to have been actually litigated, decided by a court on\nthe merits, and necessary to the courtโs judgment.  See Kraushaar v. Flanigan, 45 F.3d 1040,\n1050 (7th Cir. 1995).  The Sheriff defendants have not even attempted to show that strip\nsearching of detainees at intake or vaginal swabbing of female detainees was so much as\ndiscussed with the court prior to its approval of the Duran decree, let alone that those issues\nwere disputed, litigated, or decided.\nIn any event, though it is true that Duran is claim-preclusive as to all pretrial detainees in\nthe CCJ, including current detainees, see Martin v. Davies, 917 F.2d 336, 339 (7th Cir. 1990), it\nbars only claims by detainees for equitable relief that was sought in Duran.  Id. at 340.  The\nSheriff defendants argue only issue preclusion, not claim preclusion, but we address the issue of\n12\n\nclaim preclusion to avoid the need to deal with it as the case progresses.  The Duran decree\naddresses overcrowding, food quality, personal hygiene, visiting privileges, law library access,\nand detainee exercise.  See Duran v. Elrod, 760 F.2d 756,760 (7th Cir. 1985).  The Sheriff\ndefendants have not pointed to any part of the Duran consent decree that addresses anything like\nthe intake strip search and vaginal swabbing procedures that are at issue in this case.  As a result,\nDuran does not preclude the present plaintiffsโ claims for injunctive relief โ if they are actually\nmaking such claims, which is not entirely clear.  See Richardson v. Ala. State Bd. of Educ., 935\nF.2d 1240, 1245-46 (11th Cir. 1991) (holding that application of claim preclusion and issue\npreclusion doctrines was improper where consent decree addressed the discriminatory nature of a\nteacher certification test and second suit addressed the non-renewal of teacher contracts); New\nOrleans Steamship Assโn v. EEOC, 680 F.2d 23, 25-26 (5th Cir. 1982) (holding that application\nof claim preclusion was improper where consent decree addressed racially discriminatory testing\ntechniques and second suit addressed an allegedly discriminatory ranking procedure applied to\nthose who had achieved a passing score on the test).  In addition, the Seventh Circuit has made it\nclear that Duran has no claim-preclusive effect as to later claims for damages.  See Martin, 917\nF.2d at 340.\nFinally, defendants suggest that the Court should transfer this case to our colleague, the\nHonorable George M. Marovich, who presides over the Duran case.  Defendants have provided\nno basis to grant such a request.  There is no question that Judge Marovichโs supervision of the\nDuran consent decree requires him to have intimate knowledge of the workings of the jail and\nother related issues.  But that does not mean that anything that touches upon the operation of the\njail is necessarily within the purview of the Duran case.  Were the Sheriff defendantsโ proposal\n13\n\ntaken to its logical conclusion, every case filed in this District that involved events at the CCJ\nwould be subsumed by Duran and transferrable to Judge Marovich, an obviously unsupportable\nresult.  For this reason, and because the defendants have offered no authority supporting their\nrequest for transfer, the Court denies the request.\n7. Sheriffโs control over operations at Cermak Hospital\nThe Sheriff defendants argue that they cannot be held liable for the vaginal swabbing\nprocedures conducted by Cermak Health Services employees because โSheahan has no\nemployment relationship with Cermak[,] and Sheahan does not control Cermak or the Cook\nCounty Bureau of Health.โ  Sheriff Mem. at 16.  This is not a basis for dismissal for failure to\nstate a claim.  As discussed earlier, plaintiffs allege in the second amended complaint that the\nSheriff defendants instituted or condoned the vaginal swabbing procedure and had authority to\nterminate it but failed to do so.  See Duckworth, 65 F.3d at 561.  Though the plaintiffs may\nultimately be unable to prove these allegations, at this point in the litigation, the allegations are\nsufficient to withstand the defendantsโ motion to dismiss.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Sheriff defendantsโ motion to dismiss\n[docket no. 34].  The Court grants the Cook County defendantsโ motion to dismiss [docket no.\n38] to the extent it seeks dismissal of official capacity claims against Martin, Jr., Winship, Fagus,\nScott, Rothstein, and Bersky, but we otherwise deny the motion.  The defendants are directed to\nanswer all remaining claims by September 15, 2006.  The case is set for a status hearing on \n14\n\nSeptember 7, 2006 at 9:30 a.m. for the purpose of setting a discovery schedule. \n____________________________________\nMATTHEW F.

Case law involving jail \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 2 of 15\nsearch policies is notoriously unpredictable. Courts across the country have struggled to parse \nSupreme Court jurisprudence on the issue.  The result is a patchwork of precedent, the only \nconsistency being  its  inconsistency.  Because  case  law regarding jail  search  policies  is  the \nantithesis of clarity, qualified immunity is proper. This factor, coupled with state law authorizing \nthe  conduct in question leads to the inescapable  conclusion that Defendants  are  entitled to \nqualified immunity. \nFACTS \nI.  Background Regarding Named Plaintiffs. \nKim  Young  (\"Young\"),  Ronald  Johnson  (\"Johnson\")  and  William  Jones  (\"Jones\"), \n(collectively,  \"Plaintiffs\")  take  issue  with  certain  intake  procedures  at  the  Cook  County \nDepartment of Corrections (\"CCDOC\"). They claim these policies violated their constitutional \nrights  guaranteed by the Fourth  and Fourteenth Amendments.  Plaintiffs  sue  pursuant to  42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983. \nYoung was  arrested  and  held on an outstanding warrant.  (S.O.F.  3,  15,  44).1  Upon \narriving at the jail, officers instructed her to remove her clothing and to squat down in front of an \nofficer and cough. (Id.)  She was behind a partition during this procedure. (Complaint at 8)? \nJohnson entered the CCDOC for possession of drugs. (S.O.F. 4). He was charged with a Class 4 \nfelony pursuant to 720 ILCS 570/402( c). (!d.) He went through the intake process with 100 other \nmen. (S.O.F.  11). He was ordered to  strip naked.  (S.O.F.  4,  14,  15, 30). Finally, Jones was \narrested on an outstanding felony warrant.  (S.O.F.  5).  He went through the CCDOC intake \nprocedure with 100 other men.  (S.O.F.  11,30,31,35). He was subjected to  a strip search. \n(S.O.F. 14, 15,30). \nII.  Intake Statistics And Procedure. \nThe CCDOC houses over 10,000 pretrial detainees in ten residential divisions. (S.O.F. 8). \nNew detainees enter through the Receiving Classification and Diagnostic Center (\"RCDC\"). \n(S.O.F. 8,35,36). Male and female detainees are physically separated. (S.O.F. 9) \nDan Brown (\"Brown\") was the Assistant Executive Director of the CCDOC during the \ntime period covering Plaintiffs' allegations. (S.O.F. 10). Brown explained that between 250 and \nI All citations are to Defendants' RuJe 56.1 Statement of Facts (\"S.O.F.\"), unless otherwise noted. \n2 All references to \"Complaint\" are to Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint. \n2 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 3 of 15\n350 detainees are booked into and out of the jail daily. (S.O.F. 11). About 300 of those detainees \nare men and 30 to 40 are women. (Jd). Of those detainees processed for intake, almost all enter \nthe  jail's  general  population.  (S.O.F.  12).  There  are  release  mechanisms  for  non-violent \noffenders under the Duran Consent Decree; as such, there is a high concentration of violent \nindividuals comprising the general population of the Cook County Jail. (See Exhibit 12). \nIII.  Statutory Code Provisions and Jail Inspections. \nThe  CCDOC  requires  that  all  new  detainees  be  strip  searched.  (S.O.F.  14).  Male \ndetainees are strip searched upon admission. (S.O.F. 14, 15). That search is mandated by sections \n701.40(f) and 701.140 of the Illinois Administrative Code. (20 Ill. Adm. Code 701.40(f) (2006)). \nWhile not governed by federal prison regulations, the CCDOC search policy is consistent with \nthem. (S.O.F. 16, 18). Strip searches and visual cavity searches are authorized by Federal Bureau \nof Prisons' regulations and the U.S.  Marshals  Service directives. (Jd).  The CCDOC's intake \nprocedure  is  accredited  by the American Correctional  Association.  (S.O.F.  19,  57-59).  The \nIllinois Department of Corrections performs annual inspections of the jail and approves of the \nintake procedure. (S.O.F. 20). \nBefore entering the CCDOC, each detainee receives a Gerstein hearing in which a judge \nfmds probable cause to detain each individual, in accordance with Gerstein v.  Pugh, 420 U.S. \n103  (1975).  (S.O.F.  21).  The CCDOC is unique in that it only accepts detainees who have \nalready seen a judge. (S.O.F. 22). When a new detainee arrives at the jail, the Sheriffs deputies \nare unaware of each detainee's charges. (S.O.F. 13, 23). A visual strip search, and not an anal \ncavity  probe,  is  performed  during  the  intake  process.  (S.O.F.  30).  Before  the  search,  the \ndetainees are lined up and told they will be searched. (S.O.F. 31). At one point, the number of \ndetainees searched varied, ranging from ten to seventy-five.  (S.O.F.  32-37).  From February \n2007 to the present, no more than 35 detainees are visually searched at one time using partitions. \n(S.O.F.40). \nIV.  Contraband. \nThe strip search prevents the introduction of contraband into the jail. (S.O.F. 24-29, 34, \n64). Brown has personally searched new detainees. (S.O.F. 24). He could not recall a single strip \nsearch during which contraband was not found.  (Jd). Items routinely discovered include cash, \n3 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 4 of 15\ncigarette packages and lighters. (S.O.F. 26). Drugs and weapons such as razor blades and knives \nare de rigueur. (Jd). \nDefense expert Nonnan Carlson is a fonner Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and \nhas over fifty years of experience in correctional administration. (S.O.F. 62).  He reviewed over \n2,000 pages of contraband reports produced during discovery detailing contraband found during \nintake strip searches at CCDOC. (S.O.F. 27). Carlson observed that inmates with misdemeanor \ncharges were as likely to carry contraband as inmates with more serious charges. (S.O.F. 28). For \nan example of this scenario, see Exhibit 10, QH 470. Finally, Carlson noted that the Federal \nBureau of Prisons recognizes the anal cavity is a common place to smuggle contraband. (S.O.F. \n29). \nV.  Female Intake Search Procedure. \nThe smaller number of women entering the jail allows for a modified search procedure. \n(S.O.F. 42). The women go through a body scan machine in the receiving room. (S.O.F. 44). The \nbody scan machine can take five minutes per individual. (S.O.F. 45).  The machine does not \nalways detect objects in detainees' mouths, under a flap of skin, or in the body cavity. (S.O.F. \n45-49). Detainees have evaded the machine's detection and smuggled contraband into jail. (Jd). \nRecidivists can manipulate the scanning machines.  (S.O.F. 45). As  a result, women are strip \nsearched with the use of partitions - identical to the ones used for male searches. (S.O.F. 44). \nVI.  Male Intake Search Procedure. \nLike the women, males go through an interview process, receive a medical screening, and \nare given a security level and housing division. (S.O.F. 35).  Due to the large number of male \ndetainees, the males are strip searched at the RCDC before going to their housing divisions. \n(S.O.F.  36). The RCDC is one of the only areas that can accommodate the large number of \ndetainees.  (Jd).  Additionally, if the search transpired elsewhere it would increase the time a \ndetainee might have a weapon. (S.O.F. 37). \nDetainees would bend at the waist and spread their buttocks so that officers could look \nfor contraband. (S.O.F. 38). One year before Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, Defendants changed \nthe process such that detainees squatted rather than bended at the waist. (S.O.F. 39). In February \n2007, Defendants installed partitions in the hallway where the male searches occurred. (S.O.F. \n4 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 5 of 15\n40).  However, partitions raise  safety concerns, such as using partition parts as weapons and \nconceahnent of attacks by detainees. (S.O.F. 41). \nSearching males using the same procedures as females would slow the process such that \ndetainees  would not reach their housing division in time to  attend court,  on the following \nmorning.  (S.O.F.  50-52).  Detainees  could not reach their housing locations,  eat,  shower, or \ncontact family members. (lef). The jail is subject to a Consent Decree requiring the intake process \nbe completed within a reasonable time, and eleven hours was deemed unreasonable in Lewis v. \nO'Grady,  853  F.2d  1366,  1370  (7th  Cir.  1988).  (S.O.F.  53).  Lastly,  Sheriff Sheahan was \ninformed by District Court Judge Wayne Anderson, during the settlement of the prior female \nstrip search class action that there was no problem with the male strip search. (S.O.F. 54). \nVII.  Class Certification. \nThis Court certified two classes based on improper intake procedures. \nClass I consists of: \nAll males who were subjected to a strip search and/or visual body \ncavity search as new detainees at the Cook County Jail on or after \nJanuary 30, 2004. \nClass II consists of: \nAll persons charged only with misdemeanor or lesser offenses not \ninvolving drugs or weapons who were subjected to a strip search \nand/or a visual body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook \nCounty Jail on or after January 30, 2004. \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs' allegations and the testimony adduced during discovery demonstrate that any \nconstitutional violations committed against Plaintiffs were the result of a strip search policy, not \nthe conduct of individual Defendants. Moreover, this matter does not involve behavior that is \negregious and devoid of social utility, but rather efforts to facilitate important law enforcement \ninterests. There can be little dispute in the worth of combating the scourge of jail violence. Thus, \nthe reasonableness standard militates in favor of fmding qualified immunity. \nI.  This Case Epitomizes Why The Qualified Immunity Doctrine Exists. \nQualified immunity shields  officers from  liability for  civil  damages  insofar as  their \nconduct  does  not  violate  \"clearly  established  statutory  or constitutional  rights  of which  a \n5 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 6 of 15\nreasonable  person  would  have  known.\"  Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald,  457  U.S.  800,  818  (1982). \nQualified immunity \"gives public officials the benefit of legal doubt,\" Elliott v.  Thomas,  937 \nF.2d 338, 341 (7th Cir. 1991), by relieving them from having to decide, at their fmancial peril, \nhow judges will decide future cases. Greenberg v. Kmetko, 922 F.2d 382,385 (7th Cir. 1991). \nIn Saucier v. Katz, the Supreme Court set out a two-part test for qualified immunity. 533 \nU.S. 194,201 (2001). The threshold inquiry is whether \"taken in the light most favorable to the \nparty asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional \nright?\" Id  at 201.  If they do  not show a right was violated, the inquiry ends and sununary \njudgment based on qualified immunity is  proper.  Defendants have established in its Motion \nregarding the constitutionality of the search that the search policy is constitutional and thus this \nCourt need not address the issue of qualified immunity. \nEven if the Court disagrees with the Defendants' Motion, Plaintiffs fare no better because \nqualified immunity applies. In ascertaining the propriety of qualified immunity, the Court must \ndetermine \"if the right was clearly established.\" Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201. '''Clearly established' \nwithin the context of qualified immunity means that the contours of the right must be sufficiently \nclear that a reasonable official would understand that what he  is  doing violates that right.\" \nAnderson,  483 U.S. at 639-40. This second question must be answered in light of the specific \ncontext of the case. Brosseau v.  Haugen,  543 U.S. 194, 198 (2004). \"The relevant, dispositive \ninquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a \nreasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the sitnation he confronted.\" Saucier,  533 \nU.S.  at 201.  \"If officers of reasonable competence could disagree on\" the lawfulness of the \nconduct, \"immunity should be recognized.\" Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 229 (1991). \nDefendants need only show that reasonable minds could differ as to the lawfulness of \ntheir  conduct.  It is  irrelevant  in  deciding  qualified  immunity  whether  there  is  a  \"more \nreasonable\" interpretation of the law that may be conceived of after the fact. Hunter, 502 U.S. at \n228. This distinguishes this Motion from other sununary judgment motions. \"When reasonable \nminds could differ, in the typical summary judgment decision the balance tips in favor of the \nnonmovant while in the qualified immunity context the balance favors the movant.\" Ellis v. \nWynalda, 999 F.2d 243,246 (7th Cir. 1993). \n6 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 7 of 15\nA.  The Statutory Law And Administrative Code Establish That The \nDefendants' Conduct Was Permissible. \nIn considering the \"objective legal reasonableness\" of the  state  officer's actions,  one \nrelevant inquiry is whether the defendant relied on a state statute, regulation, or official policy \nthat explicitly sanctioned the conduct in question.  Wilson v.  Layne,  526 U.S. 603, 617 (1993). \n\"The existence of a statute or ordinance authorizing particular conduct is a factor which militates \nin favor of the conclusion that a reasonable  official would find that conduct constitutional.\" \nGrossman v.  City o/Portland, 33 F.3d 1200, 1209 (9th Cir. 1994). \"Common sense dictates that \nreasonable  public  officials  are  far  less  likely to  conclude  that  their actions  violate  clearly \nestablished  rights  when  they  are  enforcing  a  statute  on  the  books  with  no  transparent \nconstitutional problems.\" Connecticut ex reI.  Blumenthal v.  Crotty, 346 F.3d 84,  104 (2d Cir. \n2003). These axioms dictate qualified immunity for Defendants is proper. \nWhen the  searches  were  performed there was  statutory  and  administrative  authority \npermitting these measures.  Specifically, the  Illinois Administrative Code,  Federal Bureau of \nPrisons'  Directives,  and  the  U.S.  Marshals  Service  Directives  authorize  strip  searches  of \ndetainees  upon  admission  into  a  correctional  facility.  (S.D.F.  15-19).  This  troika validates \nDefendants' actions, which were consistent with these provisions. Defendants acted reasonably \nin  relying  on  unambiguous  state  and  federal  authority  as  the  foundation  for  their  intake \nprocedure. The following synopses of the Illinois and Federal provisions capture their clarity and \nembody the propriety of Defendants' policies. \n1.  Regulatory Language Authorizing Strip Searches. \nThe Illinois Administrative Code provision mandating strip searches at intake states: \n1)  A strip search shall be performed in an area that ensures \nprivacy and dignity of the individual. The individual shall \nnot  be  exposed  to  the  view  of others  who  are  not \nspecifically involved in the process. \n2)  Strip searches shall be conducted by a person ofthe same \nsex. \n3)  All personal clothing shall be carefully searched for \ncontraband. \n4)  The probing of body cavities may not be done except where \nthere is reasonable suspicion of contraband. \n20 Ill. Adm. Code 701.40(f) (2007). \n7 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 8 of 15\nThe Code  also provides that \"[d ]etainees permitted to leave the confines of the jail \ntemporarily, for any reason, shall be thoroughly searched prior to leaving and before re-entering \nm. \nthe jail.\" 20  Adm. Code 701.140. \nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons has a similar directive. It instructs personnel to search \ndetainees in a manner more extensive than the CCDOC's policy. The directive provides: \nStaff shall instruct the inmate to lift or move any body folds or \ncreases, to include penis and testicles, or breasts, and excess skin \nfolds....  The inmate shall be asked to turn around facing away \nfrom the officer, with the arms extended to the side and the feet \nabout shoulder width apart ... The inmate shall be instructed to bend \nover as  far as possible, reach behind and pull buttocks apart to \nexpose the crevice area. \nMale inmates are to be instructed to cough deeply.  Female inmates \nshall be instructed to face the officer, squat and cough deeply. A \nflashlight shall be used for a visual search of these areas. \nFederal Bureau of Prisons, Directive 5800.12, Section 124. \nFinally, the U.S. Marshals Service Directives authorize strip searches in a manner that is \nconsistent with the CCDOC's procedures. The Directives mandate strip searches when there is \nreasonable suspicion. U.S. Marshals Service Directives Section 9.3(D)(3)(a). The U.S. Marshals \nService Directives provides: \nWhen conducting a strip search, the deputy will: \n(3)  Inspect behind each ear and look inside the prisoner's ear canals, \nnostrils, and mouth, checking under the tongue, roof of the mouth, \nand between the lips and gums.  Visually inspect down the front of \nthe body, paying close attention to areas such as armpits, breasts; \nand  genital  area.  Direct  the  prisoner  to  face  in  the  opposite \ndirection and conduct a visual inspection of the upper back area. \n(4)  Direct the prisoner to spread his or her legs and bend forward at \nthe  waist.  Observe  the  anus  area  and  genitals  from  the  rear. \nConclude with an observation of the bottoms and between the toes \nof both feet. \nU.S. Marshals Service Directives Section 9.3(D)(3)(f)(3)-(4). \nThe directives also instruct: \"[p]rior to accepting a prisoner(s) from a detention facility, \ninstitution, or other inside or outside source, deputies may perform their own strip searches as \n8 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 9 of 15\nnecessary based on the factors due to the prisoner's contact with individual(s) inside or outside \nthe facility and the need for a thorough search for contraband and/or weapons.\" 1d. at (D)(3). \n2.  The CCDOC's Intake Procedure Parallels the Federal Bureau of \nPrisous aud the U.S. Marshals Service. \nUnder the Bureau of Prisons' procedure, detainees must bend over as far as possible, pull \ntheir buttocks apart, and cough deeply. The federal correctional officers then use a flashlight for \nthe visual search of these areas.  The provisions of the U.S.  Marshals  Service Directives are \nessentially  identical.  Detainees  at  CCDOC  must bend  over  and  spread their  buttocks,  like \ninmates in federal  facilities.  During the relevant class period, the  CCDOC shifted from this \nprocess to one in which the male detainees must squat and cough. This process mirrors how \nfederal female detainees are searched. Moreover, the U.S. Marshals Service Directives instruct \ndeputies to perform strip searches whenever a prisoner is accepted from an outside source. U.S. \nMarshals Service Directives Section 9.3(D)(3)(g). Thus, the strip search process of the CCDOC \nis consistent with the directives of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshals Service, \nproviding additional support for a finding of qualified immunity. \nThe Illinois Administrative Code requires the CCDOC strip search all detainees prior to \nentering  the  general  population  of  the  jail.  Thus,  non-violent  and  non-drug  related \nmisdemeanants cannot avoid the search process. Illinois law is clear. So are the Federal Bureau \nof Prisons and U.S. Marshall Directives. They make no distinction between detainees and their \nrespective charges.  Again,  Defendants'  conduct was reasonable because they were acting in \naccordance with state and federal regulations. \nFinally,  the  American  Correctional  Association  and  the  Illinois  Department  of \nCorrections inspected and certified the CCDOC. (S.O.F. 19, 20, 57-59). These entities did not \nraise any concerns regarding the intake procedure. (1d).  Defendants relied on the compliance \ncertifications  as  evidence  that  their  intake  procedure  complied  with  national  standards. \nAdditionally, Norman Carlson opined that the searches serve a legitimate penological purpose \nand are performed in a reasonable manner. (S.O.F. 64) Finally, the John Howard Association, a \ncourt appointed monitor pursuant to the Duran consent decree, visits the jail approximately fifty \ntimes per year and has observed the intake procedure. (S.O.F. 60). It has never objected. (Id). \n9 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 10 of 15\nThese factors are additional evidence that Defendants had no reason to suspect the search policy \nviolated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights. \nFor qualified innnunity not to apply, \"the unlawfulness must be apparent.\" Anderson v. \nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987). Here, it was not. In fact, it was the lawfulness that was \napparent.  State and federal provisions authorized Defendants'  conduct.  Thus, Defendants are \nentitled to qualified innnunity. \n3.  Federal Precedent Dictates Qualified Immunity for Defendants \nBecause They Acted in Accordance With Illinois Law. \nIt is axiomatic that officials who follow state and federal provisions should be protected \nby qualified immunity. For a central premise underlying qualified innnunity is \"the need to avoid \nunfairly subjecting the official to liability for the good faith exercise of discretion pursuant to a \nlegal obligation.\" Coleman v.  Frantz, 754 F.2d 719, 727-28 (7th Cir. 1985). Even officials who \ndepart  from  prison regulations  \"do  not lose  their  qualified  innnunity  merely because their \nconduct violates some statutory or administrative provision.\" Davis v.  Scherer, 468 U.S.  183, \n194 (1984). If officials can maintain qualified innnunity despite violating a statutory provision, \nthose who adhere to such provisions deserve qualified innnunity. The following cases involve \ninstances in which qualified innnunity was found because the officials were acting pursuant to a \nregulation or statute. \nThe Supreme Court spoke on this issue in Wilson v.  Layne, 526 U.S. 603 (1999). Layne \ninvolved  police  officers  who  served  an  arrest  warrant with the  media  in  tow.  The  Court \ndetermined the officers' conduct violated the Fourth Amendment. But the officers were entitled \nto qualified innnunity. Similar to the instant case, the officers' conduct was in accordance with a \nU.S. Marshals service policy and the local county's policy. Thus, \"it was not unreasonable for \nlaw enforcement officers to look and rely on their formal ride-along policies.\" Id. at 617. \nExamples of qualified immunity being granted abound in the Northern District. State \nactors sought qualified innnunity against an inmate's claim that he was routinely strip searched \nin Roy v. Jenkins, 1991 U.S. Dist. Lexis 14241 at *16 (N.D. Ill. 1991). The court cited to Bell, \nnoting it \"held that strip searches of convicted prisoners (and even pretrial detainees) did not \nviolate the Fourth Amendment.\" Id.  at *13. This pronouncement, coupled with the plaintiff's \nfailure to state a particularized right existed, led the court to observe, \"[the plaintiff! has no right \n10 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 11 of 15\nto be entirely free from strip searches while in prison.\" Id  at * 15. Thus, it granted qualified \nimmunity to prison officials because \"strip searches are a valid prison security measure rationally \nrelated to a legitimate nonpunitive end.\"  Id. \nIn  Baushard v.  Martin,  1993  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  23358  (N.D.  Ill.  1993),  the  court \nconsidered whether a police official was entitled to qualified immunity after violating a police \nofficer's due process rights. The official had not provided the officer with an adversarial hearing \nbefore discharging him.  But the  official \"was following  a CPD  regulation which gave  him \ndiscretion as to whether to institute adversarial proceedings.\" Id  at *18.  This necessitated a \nfinding of qualified immunity. In Johnson v.  Remmers, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6518 (N.D. Ill. \n2002), prison officials were granted qualified immunity \"because they were acting pursuant to \nfacially valid statutes and regulations.\" The court in Gonzalez v.  TUmer, 775 F.Supp. 256, 265 \n(N.D. Ill. 1991), reached a similar conclusion when it held that an officer who follows a police \nregulation should be given qualified immunity. See also Zookv. Brown, 575 F.Supp. 72 (C.D. Ill. \n1983) (sheriff granted qualified immunity regarding his disciplining of employee pursuant to \nIllinois statute). These cases signify that Defendants' actions were entirely reasonable as they \nwere acting pursuant to the Illinois Administrative Code, Federal Bureau of Prisons directives, \nand the U.S. Marshals Service directives. \nFederal  appellate  courts  have made  similar  determinations.  In Grossman,  the  Ninth \nCircuit invalidated a municipal ordinance prohibiting demonstrations in a public park without a \npermit. 33 F.3d 1200 (9th Cir. 1994). But the officer who arrested the demonstrator for violating \nthe ordinance was entitled to qualified immunity. The court reasoned that \"when a city council \nhas duly enacted an ordinance, police officers on the street are ordinarily entitled to rely on the \nassumption that the council members have considered the views of legal counsel and concluded \nthat the ordinance is a valid and constitutional exercise of authority.\" Id.  at 1209. The D.C. \nCircuit held similarly in Lederman v.  United States, 291 FJd 36 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Capitol Police \nwere entitled to qualified immunity because they acted pursuant to a Capitol Grounds Regulation \neven though the regulation violated the First Amendment. \nThe Second Circuit's analysis in Connecticut ex reI.  Blumenthal v.  Crotty, 346 F.3d 84 \n(2d Cir. 2003), is also instructive. Connecticut brought suit arguing that New York's Nomesident \nLobster Law discriminated against nomesidents  of New York.  The  Second  Circuit  agreed, \n11 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 12 of 15\nholding the statute violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nHowever,  the  defendants  were  entitled  to  qualified  inununity.  \"Without  a  clear  legislative \nmandate or judicial order invalidating the Nonresident Lobster Law, the individual Appellants \nerred  on the  side  of caution  and  relied  upon  the  Nonresident  Lobster  Law's presumptive \nvalidity.\" Id. at 108. Finding this decision \"objectively reasonable under the circumstances,\" the \nSecond Circuit reversed the district court. Id. \nIn  sum,  even  if the  Court finds  the  underlying  regulations  constitutionally  suspect, \nqualified immunity is still proper. State officials \"are charged to enforce laws until and unless \nthey  are  declared  unconstitutional\"  and  \"the  enactment of a  law forecloses  speculation by \nenforcement officers concerning its constitutionality.\" Michigan v.  DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 38 \n(1979). Accordingly, \"even if the statute is arguably unconstitutional,\" officials are \"obligated to \nenforce it, and [are1   entitled to qualified inununity for any constitutional violation that might \nhave resulted.\" Egolfv. Witmer, 421 F. Supp. 2d 858, 876 (E.D. Pa. 2006). \nThese cases are imbued in conunon sense.  It is  inconceivable that officials could be \nindividually liable when they were simply following state and federal guidelines. If the situation \nwere otherwise, officials would be forced to navigate between the Scylla of ignoring the law and \nbeing derelict in their duty and the Charybdis of following the law and being individually liable. \nCourts  recognize  the  intractable  nature  of such  a  dilemma.  That  is  why  officials  in  the \naforementioned cases were granted qualified inununity. It is also why Defendants are entitled to \nqualified immunity. \nB.  Federal  Precedent  Regarding  Strip  Searches  Did  Not  Clearly  Establish \nDefendants' Conduct Was Unlawful. \nEven if the Illinois Administrative Code and the federal  directives are insufficient to \nbestow qualified immunity, the conflicting case law forecloses any doubt. To determine whether \na right was clearly established, the Court looks to analogous cases decided before the defendant \ntook the action challenged. Rakovich v.  Wade, 850 F.2d 1180,1205 (7th Cir. 1988). \nThere are several cases permitting strip searches of detainees, as more thoroughly set \nforth in Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.3 Plaintiffs run headlong into the seminal \nDefendants incorporate herein the constitutional contentions in their Motion for Summary Judgment on The \n3 \nConstitutionality of Search Policy. \n12 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 13 of 15\ncase of Bell v.  Wolfish,  441 U.S. 520 (1979). In Bell, the Supreme Court held that the blanket \npolicy of visual searches after every contact visit did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Id. at \n558. The court reasoned that a \"detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security \ndangers.  Smuggling of money,  drugs, weapons,  and other contraband is  all too common an \noccurrence.\" Id.  at 559. The Supreme Court's pronouncement has been echoed by courts in this \nCircuit. \n\"Courts have  routinely  approved of visual  searches  of prisoners'  rectal  and  genital \nareas.\" United States v.  Oakley, 731 F. Supp. 1363,1371 (S.D. Ind. 1990). The district court in \nListon v.  Steffes, 300 F. Supp. 2d 742 (W.D. Wis. 2002), recognized that even minor offenders \nmay be searched without reasonable suspicion if they are placed in the general jail population: \n\"In this circuit, the law is well settled that strip searches may be performed on persons taken into \ncustody on a misdemeanor or traffic violation ... if the person is going to be housed in the general \njail population and not simply detained for release upon completion of the booking process.\" Id. \nat 756-57. Additionally, lllinois courts hold that strip searches of people arrested pursuant to \nfailure to appear for misdemeanor warrants  do  not violate the Fourth Amendment. People v. \nMitchell, 353 Ill. App. 3d 838, 840-41 (2nd Dist. 2004); People v. Johnson, 334 Ill. App. 3d 666, \n672-73 (4th Dist. 2002). \nThese decisions clash with Northern District cases including Thompson v.  Cook County, \n428  F.  Supp.  2d  807  (N.D.  Ill.  2006),  and  Bullock  v.  Sheahan,  2008  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS \n59248 (N.D. Ill. 2008). This inconsistency necessitates qualified immunity. \nOther courts have noted the uncertain landscape of strip search law necessitates qualified \nimmunity. A district court held that a county sheriff was entitled to qualified immunity on claims \nthat his strip search policy was unconstitutional in Powell v.  Barrett,  376 F.  Supp. 2d.  1340 \n(N.D. Ga. 2005), aff'd Powell v. Barrett, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18907 (11th Cir. Sept. 4,2008) \n(en banc). It reasoned, \"if the majority of the Eleventh Circuit continues to perceive room to \ndebate the contours of this constitutional right, it seems to this Court that no state official could \njustifiably  be  charged  with  having  'fair  warning'  that  conducting  a  strip  search  absent  a \nreasonable suspicion of contraband violates the law.\" Id. at 1349. The First Circuit in Savard v. \nRhode Island,  338 F.3d 23  (1st Cir.  2003),  also  granted qualified  immunity in light of the \nexisting uncertainty over the law of strip searches. See also Bahrampour v.  Lampert, 356 F.3d \n13 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 14 of 15\n969,977 (9th Cir. 2004) (upholding qualified immunity where \"a conflict in the views of district \ncourt judges  on the  issue  [of strip  searches1   demonstrates  that the  constitntionality of the \nregulations was not clearly established\"); Thorne v. Jones, 765 F.2d 1270, 1277 (5th Cir. 1985) \n(prison strip search \"law was not charted clearly.\"). Conflicting case law in the Northern District \nand Seventh Circuit warrant the same treatment here. \nThe tension between the rights of detainees and the demands of institntional security \nengenders an environment of contrasting approaches. Courts have not provided a clear directive \nwith  regards  to  intake  searches.  To  remedy  this  situation,  courts  have  applied  qualified \nimmunity. This Court should do the same. \nC.  The Dangers of Jail Violence Warrant a Finding that Defendants' Conduct \nWas Lawful. \nThere  are  additional motivations to  find  for  Defendants,  namely,  the  security of the \nCCDOC. Institutional security is not an abstraction. Jail violence is endemic. The CCDOC's \nsearch policy seeks to stem this tide. The scale of the contraband seized reflects the gravity of the \nsitnation.  The contraband reports differentiate this case from previous strip search cases. No \nother jail has created so detailed a record of the extent of smuggling drugs and weapons. No \nother jail has documented the prevalence of hiding contraband in bodily orifices, where a pat \ndown or metal detector search would be ineffective. These realities demonstrate the dangers the \ncorrectional staff and inmates face and confirm the reasonableness of Defendants' actions. A \nreasonable jail policymaker could have believed that the problem of contraband justified visual \nsearches. \nCourts have highlighted the difficulties in striking a balance between the constitntional \nrights  of  the  detainee  and  the  penological  interest  in  conducting  contraband  searches. \nMaintaining institutional security as well as the safety of jail officers and detainees are valid \njustifications for strip searches. Stanley v.  Henson,  337 F.3d 966 (7th Cir. 2003) (noting that \nofficers can consider every inmate as a potential carrier of contraband). Because institntional \nsecurity is a legitimate law enforcement objective, there is a compelling reason for a strip search \nabsent reasonable suspicion. Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 133 (2003). As a result, courts \nhave invoked qualified immunity to protect correctional officials from strip search suits like this. \n14 \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 207      Filed 10/03/2008     Page 15 of 15\nCONCLUSION \nTo reiterate, the dispositive inquiry in a qualified immunity determination is whether a \nreasonable  official  would  understand  that  what  he  was  doing  was  unlawful.  Given  that \nDefendants were following the law, the answer suggests itself. The Defendants' conduct in this \ncase was the definition of lawful. The Defendants adhered to administrative code requirements \nand two sets of federal directives. To hold officials individually liable for conduct imposed by \nstate and federal authorities is untenable with the rationale of qualified immunity. \nThe ramifications of finding the search policy unconstitutional and Defendants without \nqualified immunity are far reaching. It will invite a deluge of challenges to federal correctional \nfacilities  following  the  same  policy  and  hinder  efforts  to  quell  the  rampant  violence  in \ncorrectional facilities throughout the country. \nWHEREFORE, the Sheriff Defendants respectfully request that this Court determine that \nthe individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity and dismiss all claims against them. \nDefendants further seek any additional relief this Court deems just. \nRespectfully submitted, \nTHE SHERIFF DEFENDANTS \nBy:  lsi Daniel F.

The Court directs the Clerk to terminate motions 415 and 436, upon which the Court\npreviously ruled.\nO[ For further details see text below.] Docketing to mail notices.\nSTATEMENT\nA jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to liability in this class action.  The defendant, Cook County Sheriff\nThomas Dart, has moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial.\n1. U.S. Department of Justice report\nThe Court admitted pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8) an excerpt of a report by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice (USDOJ) issued to the Sheriff pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons\nAct, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997a.  The Sheriff argues that the report contained double-hearsay, it consisted of opinions\nand conclusions, and it was unfairly prejudicial, in part due to its purportedly late identification by plaintiffs. \nThis matter was fully briefed as a part of a pretrial motion in limine by Dart on which the Court heard\nextensive argument and made a detailed ruling.  See 7/29/09 Tr. 42-52.\nThe Court deals with Dartโs timeliness point first.  Plaintiffs persuasively argued in the motion in\nlimine briefing that it was Dart who should have produced the report in discovery but failed to do so. \nPlaintiffs discovered it on their own and identified it as a possible exhibit in reasonably prompt fashion after\ndiscovering it.  Dart has identified no real prejudice arising from the late disclosure.  Though he contends that\nthe information in the report could not be verified, the report itself contained an offer by USDOJ to provide\ninformation that would enable Dart to identify particular incidents referenced in the part of the report in\nquestion.  \nThe Court correctly ruled that the report qualified for admission under Rule 803(8).  In the language of that\nRule, the report amounted to โfactual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority\ngranted by law.โ  Fed. R. Evid. 803(8).  See, e.g., Palo v. Dallas County, No. 3:05-CV-0527-D, 2007 WL\n2140590, at *8 (N.D. Tex. 2007); R.G. v. Koller, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1133 n.1 (D. Haw. 2006); McKnight\n06C552 Mercado vs. Dart Page 1 of  5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 495 Filed: 11/17/09 Page 2 of 5 PageID #:12037\nSTATEMENT\nv. District of Columbia, 412 F. Supp. 2d 127, 133 n.7 (D.D.C. 2006) (all admitting similar reports under Rule\n803(8)).  Dart argued prior to trial, and argues now, that the sources of information indicated lack of\ntrustworthiness, but that argument was unpersuasive.  Dartโs argument along these lines may have implicated\nthe appropriate weight to be given the report, but it did not affect the reportโs admissibility.  The same is true\nof Dartโs double-hearsay argument.  See generally Clark v. Clabaugh, 20 F.3d 1290, 1295 (3d Cir. 1994);\nMoss v. Ole South Real Estate, Inc., 933 F.2d 1300, 1309-10 (5th Cir. 1991); McClure v. Mexia, 750 F.2d\n396, 399-400 (5th Cir. 1985).  As indicated above, Dart had all the tools needed to attempt to refute the report\nif he wished to do so, and he had both the ability and the opportunity to argue its weight before the jury.\nDartโs objection also suggests that the Court should have excluded the report under Federal Rule of Evidence\n403 as unfairly prejudicial.  The Court is unpersuaded that the balancing required under Rule 403 favors\nexclusion.  Before evidence may be excluded under that rule, its probative value must be โsubstantially\noutweighedโ by the danger of unfair prejudice (etc).  Fed. R. Evid. 403 (emphasis added).  Such was not the\ncase here.\nFinally, and in any event, in the overall context of the trial Dart suffered no appreciable harm from the\nadmission of the USDOJ report.  The incidents described in the report were far less specific and detailed than\nthose discussed by the nearly twenty detainees who testified during the trial.  The juryโs determination\nregarding what happened during intake strip searches largely boiled down to a determination of whether to\nbelieve those witnesses.  The particular incidents referenced in the USDOJ report paled by comparison. \nThe Court also notes that Dart himself offered, and the Court admitted, reports by Illinois authorities\nregarding their inspections of the Cook County Jail.  These reports were admitted on the same basis as the\nUSDOJ report.  The USDOJ report was no less admissible than the state authoritiesโ reports.\n2. References to the L3 body scanning machine\nDefendant says that the Court excluded reference to the Jailโs use of a body scanning machine.  The Court\nagrees with plaintiffs that defendant has mischaracterized the record as well as the Courtโs ruling.\nAt the final pretrial conference, the Court became aware that in or around March 2009, the Cook County Jail\npurportedly had begun to use a body scanning machine to examine male inmates at intake, allegedly in lieu of\nstrip searches.  Plaintiffs objected to the admission of this evidence at trial primarily on the ground that they\nhad not been advised until late June 2009 (about six weeks before trial) of a policy change that supposedly\nhad taken place more than three months earlier and that, one could reasonably infer, had been decided upon\neven before that.  See July 27, 2009 Tr. 58-61.  Dart did not dispute that his counsel first advised plaintiffsโ\ncounsel about the change in policy in June 2009, three months after it supposedly went into effect.  Id. 63;\nsee also id. 60-61.  As a result, plaintiffs argued, they had been completely foreclosed from attempting to\ndetermine whether the policy was actually being enforced and whether strip searches were still occurring. \nId. 64.  \nBecause plaintiffs were hamstrung in responding to the claimed policy change, the Court ruled that the\nliability trial would cover only the period through March 18, 2009, the date on which the change purportedly\ntook effect.  Id. 64.  This made the alleged policy change effectively immaterial and irrelevant for purposes of\nthe trial.\nContrary to Dartโs argument in his post-trial motion, Dart himself injected into the trial the use of the body\nscanning machine for searches of male detainees.  See Pls.โ Resp. to Def.โs Mot. for Judg. at 9 (citing trial\n06C552 Mercado vs. Dart Page 2 of  5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 495 Filed: 11/17/09 Page 3 of 5 PageID #:12038\nSTATEMENT\ntranscript).  The Court allowed a good deal of this evidence to be admitted.  Dart contends that the Court\nโrefusedโ what Dart characterizes as his โattempt[ ] to explain why the L3 was being usedโ via witness Dan\nBrown.  Def.โs Mot. for Judg. at 6 (โThrough Dan Brown, the Sheriff attempted to explain why the L3 was\nbeing used.  The Court refused.  This ruling prevented a number of issues from being discussed.โ).  This, to\nbe charitable, is revisionist history.  During Brownโs examination, Dart introduced, without objection or\nadverse ruling, a good deal of evidence regarding an alleged โpilot projectโ relating to the L3 scanning\nmachine.  Tr. Vol. V 1169-71.  Plaintiffsโ counsel objected when the testimony reached a point where it\nappeared it might run afoul of the Courtโs pretrial ruling barring evidence regarding the claimed March 2009\npolicy change.  Id. 1172.  After hearing extensive argument outside the juryโs presence, the following\ninterchange took place between the Court and Dartโs counsel:\nTHE COURT:  So what additional are you planning to do at this point regarding with [sic] this\nwitness regarding the subject of this body scanning machine that is in these pictures and so\non?\nMR. CATANIA:  This one, nothing further.  We have another one coming up.  That is the\nfemaleโs body scan.\nId. 1180-81 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffsโ counsel advised that he did not object to introduction of evidence\nregarding use of a body scanning machine for searches of female detainees.  Id. 1181.\nIn short, the contemporaneous comments of Dartโs own counsel at the time of the Courtโs ruling put the lie to\nDartโs current argument that the Court โrefusedโ to allow witness Brown to explain further.  Rather, Dartโs\ncounsel said that he did not have further questions for Brown on the topic.\nFollowing this discussion, the Court determined that to avoid running afoul of the pretrial ruling concerning\nthe claimed policy change, no further evidence regarding use of a body scanning machine for searches of\nmale detainees would be introduced โuntil I have an opportunity to address this further.โ  Id. 1183-84.  At the\nstart of the next day of trial, after hearing further argument, the Court stated that โI donโt want there to be any\nfurther questions or answers that even by implication talk about a change in procedures in March of 2009 . . .\n.โ  Id., Vol. VI 1306-07.  The Court advised both sides that โif you think that thereโs something along those\nlines that you need to get in, on either side, you need to front it with me first at a sidebar before it is asked of\na witness and before you ask a question that I conclude after the fact is reasonably likely to draw testimony\nlike that out of a witnessโ mouth.โ  Id. 1308.  After this, Dart never once asked the Court to introduce further\nevidence regarding use of the L3 scanning machine.  In short, Dart has forfeited any argument regarding\nintroduction of further evidence about the L3 machine, and even if he had not done so, the argument is\nwithout merit, because he was offered an opportunity to advise the Court about any further evidence on the\ntopic he wished to offer, but never took that opportunity.\n3. Jury instructions\nIn his motion for new trial, Dart โadopt[ed] and incorporate[d] by reference all objections made to Plaintiffsโ\ntendered instructions as stated in the jury instruction conference.โ  Def.โs Mot. for Judg. at 6.  This one-\nsentence argument forfeits the issue because it fails to develop whatever points Dart was making.  See, e.g.,\nWhite Eagle Co-op. Assโn v. Conner, 553 F.3d 467, 476 n.6 (7th Cir. 2009) (โ[P]erfunctory and undeveloped\narguments, and arguments that are unsupported by pertinent authority, are waived . . . .โ).\nIn any event, the sole objection that Dart pressed involved whether the Court should give the jury a list of\n06C552 Mercado vs. Dart Page 3 of  5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 495 Filed: 11/17/09 Page 4 of 5 PageID #:12039\nSTATEMENT\nfactors to be considered in deciding plaintiffsโ due process and equal protection claims.  See Trial Tr. 1890-\n91 (discussing defense comments on instructions).  Indeed, that is the only instruction that Dart discussed in\nhis reply brief on the current motion after plaintiffs made their argument about forfeiture.  See Def.โs Reply at\n10.  The Court declined to give a list of factors because it found them incomplete and, in part, argumentative,\na ruling that the Court continues to believe was correct.  In any event, the Court specifically permitted\ncounsel to discuss these or any other factors during closing argument.  Trial Tr. 1890.  \nDart also complains that the instructions omitted or downplayed the factor of jail security.  The Court\ndisagrees.  The instructions made it clear that jail security was โan important governmental objective and a\nlegitimate governmental purpose.โ  See, e.g., Jury Instructions 14.\n4. Weight and sufficiency of the evidence\nDart argues that the juryโs verdict on each of the claims was against the manifest weight of the evidence.  A\ncourt considering a motion for new trial may not set aside the jury's verdict โif a reasonable basis exists in the\nrecord to support the verdict, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, and\nleaving issues of credibility and weight of the evidence to the jury.โ  Kapelanski v. Johnson, 390 F.3d 525,\n520 (7th Cir. 2004); see also, Wipf v. Kowalski, 519 F.3d 380, 384 (7th Cir. 2008). \nIn their argument, Dart repeatedly mischaracterizes plaintiffsโ claims that were tried to the jury.  As was\nmade abundantly clear on numerous occasions, plaintiffs did not challenge the fact of a strip search; rather\nthey challenged the manner in which Sheriffโs personnel conducted the search.  In its final instructions, the\nCourt described the partiesโ contentions as follows:\nThe plaintiffs contend that upon intake to the Cook County Jail, they were subjected to\nsearches that were conducted in an inhumane and unreasonable manner, and that they were\ninappropriately subjected to harsher searches than women.\nThe defendant contends that searches were conducted in an appropriate manner and for the\npurpose of safety and security at the Jail.  The defendant also contends that any differential\ntreatment of men and women was justified. \nJury Instructions 11.  Plaintiffsโ equal protection claim concerned differences in which men and women were\nsearched on intake; their due process claim required them to prove that โ[s]trip searches were done in a\nmanner that was not rationally related to a legitimate non-punitive governmental purpose, or the searches\nwere done in a manner that appears excessive in relation to that purposeโ; and their Fourth Amendment claim\nrequired them to prove that they โwere searched in an unreasonable manner.โ  Jury Instructions 15-17.\nThe juryโs decision on each of the claims largely boiled down to a credibility contest, as the Court has\ndiscussed.  The plaintiffsโ witnesses all testified that they were strip searched and body cavity searched in a\ngroup, shoulder to shoulder, with no privacy protection.  The jury was entitled to believe these witnessesโ\ntestimony over that of the several Sheriffโs personnel who testified in contrary fashion.  In addition, enough\nof the plaintiffsโ witnesses testified that they were subjected to degrading comments and treatment that the\njury was entitled to find that this, like the practice of strip searching and body cavity searching new detainees\nin a group without privacy, amounted to a policy of the Sheriff.  Moreover, Dart has cited no case that holds\nthat group strip searches conducted in this manner on pretrial detainees are per se legal (indeed the law is to\nthe contrary, see Mays v. Springborn, 575 F.3d 643, 650 (7th Cir. 2009)), or that suggests that a jury finding\nof liability in this situation is against the manifest weight of the evidence.  In addition, Dartโs arguments that\n06C552 Mercado vs. Dart Page 4 of  5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 495 Filed: 11/17/09 Page 5 of 5 PageID #:12040\nSTATEMENT\ncertain elements of what plaintiffs claimed are not illegal or improper standing alone misses the point; the\njury properly considered the totality of the circumstances, not bits of evidence considered in isolation.  In\nsum, no new trial is required, nor are defendants entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nAs part of their โmanifest weightโ argument, Dart challenges additional evidentiary rulings that the Court\nmade.  He advances no reason why any of these rulings were incorrect, let alone prejudicial in a way that\nwould require a new trial.\n- First, Dartโs counsel never offered any decent reason why the fact that a detainee had had a bond\nhearing had anything to do with the proper manner of an intake strip search.  In any event, Dart\nmanaged to get in, on several occasions, evidence that detainees had come from the court system\nbefore the intake search, and he was not precluded from arguing that this evidence might show that\nthe plaintiffsโ witnesses were mistaken or lying about what happened to them.\n- Second, the nature of the testifying plaintiffsโ charges had no bearing on how they were searched, as\nDartโs witnesses made it clear that all detainees are searched the same way, irrespective of the charges\nagainst them.  And as plaintiffs point out, Dart was able to introduce before the jury the fact that the\nJail housed persons accused of serious crimes โ something that would have been obvious to the jury\nin any event.\n- Third, Dart was not prejudiced by the inability to introduce specific instances in which contraband\nwas found.  Dart was given the opportunity to articulate how this impacted the manner of the search\nas challenged by plaintiffs (as opposed to the fact of the search), and he could offer nothing.  And in\nany event, Dart was able to introduce a number of specific instances in which contraband was found,\nso even if the ruling was wrong, Dart was not unfairly prejudiced in a way that would require a new\ntrial.\n- Fourth, Dart did not object to testimony by certain plaintiffs about their feelings of humiliation, so\nhe has forfeited that point.  The Court also rejects Dartโs remaining evidentiary arguments for the\nreasons that formed the basis of the Courtโs rulings before and during the trial.\nFinally, the Court rejects Dartโs argument that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffsโ\nequal protection claim based on the differential treatment between male and female detainees in intake\nsearches.  His argument essentially consists of a request that the Court reweigh the evidence, see Def.โs Mot.\nfor Judg. 14-15, which is not the standard for determining a motion for judgment as a matter of law.  See\nFilipovich v. K&R Express Sys., Inc., 391 F.3d 859, 963 (7th Cir. 2004).  It is beyond question that the\nSheriff treated male and female detainees differently in searching them at intake during the relevant period,\nand there was more than sufficient evidence supporting a finding that the differences were not justified under\nthe standard that Dart agreed applies to equal protection claims.\n06C552 Mercado vs. Dart Page 5 of  5",

This Agreement is entered into to effect a full and final settlement and \ndismissal with prejudice all claims against Defendants in the above-captioned lawsuit (the \nโActionโ) on the terms set forth below, subject to the approval of the Court.  The Parties \nacknowledge that this Settlement Agreement is contingent upon the Finance Committee of \nthe Cook County Board of Commissioners giving its approval to the settlement, and that if \nthe settlement is not so approved by the time of the Mailed Notice Date (as defined below), \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 2 of 50 PageID #:13754\nthe Settlement Agreement, and any preliminary approval of the settlement shall have no force \nor effect, and the Parties will be returned to the status quo ante with respect to this Action as \nif this Agreement had never been entered into (other than as to notice and claims \nadministrator costs which may have been incurred), as further set forth in Paragraphs 53-55. \nRECITALS \n2.    This is a class action, in which Plaintiffs claim that the Sheriff of \nCook County violated the United States Constitution by maintaining a policy and practice of \nconducting blanket strip searches and/or visual body cavity searches during the initial \nadmission process at Cook County Jail (hereinafter, โJailโ) on pre-trial new admission \ndetainees charged with misdemeanors or lesser offenses not involving drugs or weapons; and \nby maintaining a policy and practice of conducting strip searches and/or visual body cavity \nsearches of pre-trial male new admission detainees in an unconstitutional manner during the \ninitial admission process at the Jail.  Defendants have denied and continue to deny these \nclaims and further deny that they have engaged in any wrongdoing whatsoever.   \nThe Court previously certified two litigation classes in this Action.  The first certified class, \nknown as โClass I,โ consisted of โAll males who were subjected to a strip search and/or \nvisual body cavity search as a new detainee at the Cook County Jail after January 30, 2004.โ  \nThe second certified class, known as โClass II,โ consisted of โAll people (male and female) \ncharged with a misdemeanor or lesser offense not involving drugs or weapons who were \nsubjected to a strip search and/or a visual body cavity search as a new detainee at the Cook \nCounty Jail after January 30, 2004.โ  Class I claimed that the manner in which the strip \nsearches and/or visual body cavity searches were conducted was abusive and violated the \nFourth Amendmentโs prohibition against unreasonable searches, the Fourteenth \nAmendmentโs Due Process Clause, and the Fourteenth Amendmentโs Equal Protection \nClause.  Class II claimed that the blanket policy of conducting strip-searches and/or visual \n2 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 3 of 50 PageID #:13755\nbody cavity searches on individuals detained on suspicion of misdemeanor or lesser offenses \nnot involving drugs or weapons violated the Fourth Amendmentโs prohibition against \nunreasonable searches.  Prior judicial determinations in this case have held in favor of Class I \nand Class II on the issue of liability as to all of their claims.  Specifically, in February of \n2009, the Court granted summary judgment to all members of Class II and to those members \nof Class I who were admitted to the Jail prior to February of 2007.  Thereafter, the Court held \na trial on the claims of members of Class I admitted to the Jail between February of 2007 and \nMarch 30, 2009.  On August 13, 2009, the jury found that the Office of the Sheriff of Cook \nCounty violated the constitutional rights of these additional class members.  Neither the \nCourtโs summary judgment rulings nor the trial determined the damages to Class I or Class II.  \nThe Parties recognize the risk, expense, difficulty and uncertainty associated with resolving \nthe issue of damages on a class-wide basis and any appeals that may follow, as well as the \nuncertainty inherent in complex litigation, and have concluded that the settlement as set forth \nin this Agreement is fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of all Parties.  The \nParties have reached this Agreement at armsโ length, after consultation with their independent \nadvisors and attorneys, in order to resolve these disputes conclusively without the \nuncertainty, expense, and delay of further litigation, pursuant to the terms set forth herein. \nSETTLEMENT TERMS \nPreliminary  Certification of Settlement Classes \n3.

County of Cook, et al. and/or the settlement thereof: \n16 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 17 of 50 PageID #:13769\n \nโข  Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania Policy No. 6034672, effective \nDecember 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004; \n   \nโข  Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania Policy No. 6041577, effective \nDecember 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005; \n \nโข  Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania Policy No. 8766984, effective \nDecember 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007; \n \nโข  Lexington Insurance Company Policy No. 7577060, effective December 31, 2006 to \nDecember 31, 2007; \n \nโข  Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania Policy No.4890591, effective \nDecember 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008; \n \nโข  Lexington Insurance Company Policy No. 1071788, effective December 31, 2007 to \nDecember 31, 2008; \n \nโข  Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania Policy No. 4890641, effective \nDecember 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009; and  \n \nโข  Lexington Insurance Company Policy No. 015542506, effective December 31, 2008 \nto December 31, 2009. \n \n(b)  This agreement does not constitute a stipulation by either side \nas to the amount of damages in addition to policy limits, if any, which may be \nrecovered pursuant to the assignment. \n(c)  Defendants  agree  that  they  will  reasonably  cooperate  with \nPlaintiffs in asserting any and all of the rights assigned to Plaintiffs. \n(d)  Plaintiffs acknowledge that this is an assignment of a claim, not \nof  the  Insurance  Policies.    Subject  to  the  limitations  set  forth  below, \nDefendants agree not to take any action with regard to the Insurance Policies \nthat would impair Plaintiffsโ ability to pursue the rights and claims assigned.  \nThis assignment does not create any further payment obligations on the part of \nDefendants other than those amounts that Cook County has agreed to pay in \nParagraph 27 above. \n17 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 18 of 50 PageID #:13770\n(e)  Defendants warrant and represent that as of the Effective Date \nof this Agreement, none of the aggregate limits of any of the above policies \nhave been impaired in any way by the payment of either indemnity or defense \ncosts.  Defendants further warrant and represent that as of the Effective Date \nof this Agreement, they are not pursuing claims for insurance coverage to their \ninsurers under the Insurance Policies, other than in connection with Young v. \nCounty of Cook, et al., and Michael Parish et al., v Sheriff of Cook County and \nCounty of Cook, Case No. 07 CV 4369 (N.D. Ill.).  Plaintiffs further warrant \nand represent that as of the Effective Date of this Agreement, Defendants have \nnot assigned any rights under the above policies to any party(ies) other than \nPlaintiffs. \n(f)  Notwithstanding any language to the contrary, nothing herein \nshall preclude Defendants, after the Effective Date of this Agreement, from \nproviding notice of any claims to any or all of the insurers under the Insurance \nPolicies.  Nor shall Defendants be precluded, after the Effective Date of this \nAgreement, from pursuing or preserving any claims for insurance coverage \nunder the Insurance Policies, subject to the limitation below in paragraph g. \nregarding  the  following  aggregate  limits  (collectively,  the  โAggregate \nLimitsโ): \n \n  (1)  the $5,000,000 โErrors and Omissions Liability \nAggregate, other than personal injury offense wrongful actsโ in the \n2003-04 Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania (โICOSPโ) \nSpecial Excess Liability Policy for Public Entities and the $5,000,000 \nโAnnual Aggregateโ in the 2004-05 ICOSP Excess Liability Policy; \n \n  (2)  the $10,000,000 โErrors and Omissions Liability \nAggregate, other than personal injury offense and advertising injury \noffense wrongful actsโ in the 2006-07, 2007-08, and 2008-09 ICOSP \nSpecial Liability Excess Policies for Public Entities;  \n \n18 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 19 of 50 PageID #:13771\n  (3)  the $10,000,000 โErrors and Omissions Liability \nAggregate, other than personal injury offense and advertising injury \noffense wrongful actsโ  limits in the 2006-07 and 2007-08, and 2008-\n09  Lexington Insurance Company (โLexingtonโ) Excess Liability \npolicies; and \n \n   (4)  the (i) $10,000,000 โClass Action Strip Search or Body \nCavity Search Liability Aggregateโ in the 2008-09 ICOSP Special \nLiability Excess Policy for Public Entities; and (ii) $10,000,000 โClass \nAction Strip Search or Body Cavity Search Liability Aggregateโ in the \n2008-09 Lexington Excess Liability policy. \n \n(g)  For a period of six months from the Courtโs final approval of \nthis  Agreement,  Defendants  shall  not  accept  any  funds  from  ICOSP  or \nLexington that will reduce the Aggregate Limits.  Nothing herein, however, \nprecludes the County from taking any actions at any time to pursue or preserve \ntheir rights to any of the Aggregate Limits.  Similarly, other than during the \nforegoing  six  month  period,  nothing  herein  precludes  the  County  from \naccepting or otherwise receiving any funds from ICOSP or Lexington that \nwould reduce the Aggregate Limits.   If, however, the County accepts or \nreceives funds from ICOSP or Lexington that would reduce the Aggregate \nLimits, the following procedures and requirements will apply: \n \n(1) The County shall give Plaintiffsโ counsel Loevy & Loevy notice of the \nactual receipt of funds that reduce the Aggregate Limits.  Such notice \nshall be given to Loevy & Loevy within 30 days after the Director of \nthe Department of Risk Management of the Cook County Bureau of \nFinance receives actual knowledge of the actual receipt of such funds. \n(2) Within 30 days of receipt of such notice from The County, either party \nmay initiate a binding arbitration seeking declaratory relief with \nrespect to the following questions: (a) do the Insurance Policies \nprovide coverage, and if so to what extent, for the claims in Young v. \n19 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 20 of 50 PageID #:13772\nCounty of Cook that are subject to the Aggregate Limits, and (b) do the \nfunds received by the County as identified in the foregoing notice \nimplicate the Aggregate Limits, such that the Countyโs receipt of those \nfunds has reduced the amounts available to pay Plaintiffs for covered \nclaims subject to those same Aggregate Limits (together, g(2)(a) and \n(b) are referred to as the โCoverage Questionsโ). \n(3) Any such arbitration must be filed within the 30-day time period set \nforth above, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties.  \nEither party may commence the arbitration by filing a written demand \nfor arbitration with the American Arbitration Association.  The \narbitration shall be conducted in Chicago, Illinois in accordance with \nthe American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules \nand procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for \narbitration. \n(4) If the arbitrator answers the Coverage Questions in paragraph (g)(2) \nabove in the affirmative, then the County shall be required to pay to \nPlaintiffs that portion of the Aggregate Limits that were eroded by the \nCountyโs receipt of funds, but only to the extent that Plaintiffs would \nhave been entitled to those funds pursuant to the assigned claims had \nthe Aggregate Limits not been eroded. \n(5) In any such arbitration, the County may assert any and all arguments \nthat it, ICOSP, or Lexington may have as to why insurance coverage \nmay not exist for the assigned claims in Young v. County of Cook.  No \nprior statements, correspondence, or other communications (whether or \noral or written) regarding insurance coverage positions or theories \n20 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 21 of 50 PageID #:13773\nmade or taken by either of the Parties shall be admissible as evidence \nor used against one of the Parties in any other way in connection with \nthe arbitration. \n(6) Plaintiffs shall use their best efforts to diligently pursue any claims \nassigned herein directly against ICOSP and Lexington.  If Plaintiffs at \nany time enter into a settlement agreement with ICOSP or Lexington \nregarding coverage under the Insurance Policies for the claims \nassigned herein and which does not expressly reserve the issue of the \nCoverage Questions for monies that were previously paid to the \nCounty under this paragraph (g) that reduced the Aggregate Limits, \nthen these arbitration procedures shall be null and void, and Plaintiffs \nshall not be permitted to recover any funds from the County with \nrespect to the Aggregate Limits or otherwise.  If Plaintiffs enter into a \nsettlement agreement that expressly reserves the Coverage Questions, \nthen in any arbitration pursuant to this section, Plaintiffs shall bear the \nburden of not only prevailing on the Coverage Questions, but shall also \nbear the burden of proving that the Plaintiffs would have settled for \nmore had the County not impaired the Aggregate Limits, and by how \nmuch.  The County may make any and all arguments in the arbitration \nthat any settlement agreement with ICOSP or Lexington was sufficient \nto compensate the Plaintiffs for all claims assigned herein, and that the \nCounty should not have to pay any additional monies to Plaintiffs from \nany funds that the County received from ICOSP or Lexington that \nreduced the Aggregate Limits. \n \n21 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 22 of 50 PageID #:13774\n(7) If, prior to the conclusion of any arbitration set forth above, Plaintiffsโ \nclaims against ICOSP or Lexington reach a judgment that decides any \nof the Coverage Questions, that judgment shall be binding on the \nparties with respect to the questions that were to be decided in the \narbitration.  If any such judgment is being appealed, either party may \nseek relief to stay or continue the arbitration until the resolution of any \nsuch appeal. \nNo restrictions apply to the Countyโs ability to accept insurance \nproceeds under the Insurance Policies or any other policies that do not \nreduce the Aggregate Limits, and none of the foregoing procedures \napply to the Countyโs acceptance of any such insurance proceeds. \n \n(h)  Plaintiffs  agree  that,  as  part  of  any  settlement  or  other \nagreement with ICOSP, Lexington, or any related entities of these insurers \n(collectively, the โInsurersโ), they shall not enter into any agreement involving \nany of the Insurers buying back any or all of the Insurance Policies.  Similarly, \nPlaintiffs agree that, as part of any settlement or other agreement with the \nInsurers, Plaintiffs shall not release any rights under the Insurance Policies to \ninsurance coverage, other than those rights assigned to Plaintiffs herein for the \nYoung v. County of Cook, et al. matter. \n29.  All costs of sending the Mailed Notice and Claim Form and \nadministering the Settlement will be paid out of the Settlement Fund.  Defendants shall \nprovide sufficient funds for the Claims Administrator to send out the Mailed Notice and \nClaim Form no later than seven (7) days before the Mailed Notice Date.  The Claims \nAdministrator will perform all work necessary to send the Mailed Notice and Claim Form to \nthe Settlement Class Members and administer the settlement and the Settlement Fund.  The \n22 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 23 of 50 PageID #:13775\nParties will provide to the Claims Administrator an agreed list of members of the Settlement \nClasses (โClass Listโ) based upon a careful analysis of the Cook County Department of \nCorrections booking records produced by Defendants in this litigation (hereinafter, โCCDOC \nrecordsโ) and the offense classification chart for the Illinois Criminal Code that is prepared \nby the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts (hereinafter, โAOIC tableโ), to determine \nthe list of individuals who fall into one or both of the Settlement Classes.  Where charge data \nor offense classification data was either unavailable or inconclusive, the following \nassumptions were used to determine class eligibility: (i) if a statutory charge was ambiguous, \nsuch that it was capable of being either a felony or a misdemeanor depending on the nature \nand circumstances of the specific alleged offense, then in the case of those ambiguous \ncharges that most frequently appeared in the CCDOC records, the ambiguous charges were \ntreated as felony charges, and for all remaining ambiguous charges, the offense classification \nassigned to that specific charge by CCDOC for any given detainee at the time of the \ndetaineeโs admission was used; (ii) if a charge listed in the CCDOC records did not appear in \nthe AOIC table, then the offense classification assigned to that specific charge by CCDOC at \nthe time of the detaineeโs admission was used; and (iii) if the offense classification of a \nparticular charge is elevated by statute from misdemeanor to felony where the individual had \na prior conviction for that same offense, then in instances in which a detainee was admitted to \nCCDOC during the class period more than once for such a charge, that charge is treated as a \nmisdemeanor during that particular detaineeโs first admission during the class period and as a \nfelony during that particular detaineeโs second or subsequent admission during the class \nperiod on that charge. \n30.  The Named Plaintiffsโ incentive awards (โIncentive Awardsโ) will be \npaid out of the Settlement Fund.  Subject to Court approval, each of the nine Named Plaintiffs \nwill each be paid an additional $25,000 as an award for services provided to the class and in \n23 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 24 of 50 PageID #:13776\nrecognition of the time, effort, and substantial benefits conferred to the Classes as a result of \ntheir involvement.  Such awards shall not affect the Named Plaintiffsโ right to seek payment \nas a Settlement Class Member, except in the case of Named Plaintiffs Allen Gorman and \nWilliam Jones, who shall not submit Claim Forms as Settlement Class Members but who \nshall receive payment in addition to the Incentive Awards by Defendants in the full amount \nof the jury awards awarded on their individual claims, which amounts shall not be paid from \nthe Settlement Fund.  The Claims Administrator shall comply with the Internal Revenue \nCode and may issue IRS Form 1099-MISC where appropriate. \n31.  Each Settlement Class Member who is not a Named Plaintiff and who \ntestified at the August 2009 trial in this Action shall each be paid an additional $10,000 as an \naward (โTestifying Class Member Incentive Awardโ) for services provided to the class and in \nrecognition of the time, effort, and substantial benefits conferred to the Classes as a result of \ntheir involvement.  Specifically, an award of $10,000 each shall be paid to Paul Beck, Bobby \nBishop, Robert Brown, Robert Consiglio, James Curran, Michael Higgs, John Jacobsen, \nDerrick Jones, Dennis Maimonis, Darryl Paul, Osbaldo Santiago, Eric Slapak, Del Wilson, \nand Rickey Winfield.  Such awards shall not affect these Settlement Class Membersโ right to \nsubmit Claims Forms and seek payment as Settlement Class Members.  The Claims \nAdministrator shall comply with the Internal Revenue Code and may issue IRS Form 1099-\nMISC where appropriate. \n32.  Each individual who submitted his claim for damages to be tried \nindividually in March and April of 2010 shall be paid by the Defendants for the full amount \nof the jury awards on his claim.  The awards (โIndividual Damage Awardsโ) are as follows:  \nAllen Gorman, $42,000.00; Daniel Coleman, $40,000.00; Robert Brown, $40,000.00; \nWilliam Jones, $25,000.00; Gerardo Aranda, $32,500.00; Vincent Jackson, $25,000.00; \nDavid Malcom, $65,000.00; Martin Medina, $65,000.00.  The Individual Damage Awards \n24 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 25 of 50 PageID #:13777\nshall not be paid out of the Settlement Fund.  Defendants shall pay the Individual Damage \nAwards within twenty-one (21) days of the entry of the Preliminary Approval Order.  The \nforegoing individuals who will be paid the Individual Damage Awards shall provide counsel \nfor Defendant Cook County with their address and either a social security number or I-TIN \n(e.g., through a sworn statement or a W-9 form) at least seven (7) days prior to the issuance \nof payment, so that Defendants can satisfy any federal reporting requirements, or if these \nindividuals do not submit this information, their respective Individual Damage Awards may \nbe subject to backup withholding but only to the extent permitted under federal law.  Such \nindividuals may seek a refund from the federal or state government. \n33.  Class Counselโs attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses will be paid out of \nthe Settlement Fund.  Class Counsel shall seek from the Court an award of actual costs \nincurred in this matter, along with attorneysโ fees of up to one-third of the Settlement Fund \n(collectively hereinafter, the โAttorneysโ Fee Awardโ).  Defendants shall not oppose Class \nCounselโs petition for the Attorneysโ Fee Award.  The final determination of the Attorneysโ \nFee Award will be decided by the Court during the Final Approval Hearing.  The Attorneysโ \nFee Award will be disbursed to Class Counsel at such time as provided in Paragraph 42 \nbelow.   \n34.  Payments to eligible Settlement Classes Members who submit timely \nand valid Claim Forms shall be determined as follows:  Men who were strip-searched one or \nmore time(s) who satisfy the definition of Settlement Class II shall be entitled to an estimated \npayment (subject to adjustment) of $1,000.  Men who were strip-searched one or more times \nwho satisfy the definition of Settlement Class I but not Settlement Class II shall be entitled to \nan estimated payment (subject to adjustment) of $700.  Women who were strip-searched one \nor more times who satisfy the definition of Settlement Class II shall receive estimated \npayment (subject to adjustment) of $500.    \n25 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 26 of 50 PageID #:13778\n35.  The following drug- or weapon-related offense shall be considered \nineligible under the definition of Settlement Class II:  720 ILCS 5/12-2(a)(1) Aggravated \nassault; 720 ILCS 5/24-1 Unlawful Use of Weapon; 720 ILCS 5/21-6 Unauthorized \nPossession or Storage of Weapons; 720 ILCS 5/33F-3 Unlawful Use of Body Armor; 720 \nILCS 550 Cannabis Control Act; 720 ILCS 570 Illinois Controlled Substances Act; 720 ILCS \n646 Meth Control & Community Protection Act; 720 ILCS 647 Meth Manufacturing Chem. \nRetail Sale Control Act; 720 ILCS 648 Meth Precursor Control Act; 720 ILCS 690 Use of \nIntoxicating Compounds Act; 720 ILCS 635 Hypodermic syringes and needles Act; and 720 \nILCS 600 Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.   \n36.  In the event that the payment amounts required by Paragraph 37 \nexceed the funds remaining in the Settlement Fund after payment of other amounts provided \nfor in Paragraphs 29, 30, 31, 33, and 42, payments to Settlement Class Members shall be \nreduced pro rata to distribute the shortfall.   \n37.  In the event that, following the payment of the other amounts specified \nin paragraphs 29, 30, 31, 33, and 42, the number of valid Claim Forms does not consume the \nentire remainder of the Settlement Fund, then Defendant County of Cook may exercise the \nright to receive a reversion of up to $5 million from such surplus.  It is expressly understood \nthat any such reversion will be paid from the monies that the County contributed to the \nSettlement Fund in excess of the $40 million in self-insured retention (โSIRโ) funds offered \nin its attempts to obtain policy limits from its insurers.  In addition, any remaining surplus in \nthe Settlement Fund following the reversion shall be distributed in pro rata amounts to each \nSettlement Class Member who is eligible for payment amounts under Paragraphs 34 and 39-\n41.   \n38.  The payment amounts to Settlement Class Members, as set forth in \nParagraph 34, 36, and 37, are not affected by the number of strip-searches to which a \n26 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 27 of 50 PageID #:13779\nSettlement Class Member has been subjected.  Settlement Class Members shall receive the \nsame payment amount under this Settlement regardless of the number of times they were strip \nsearched.  Settlement Class Members shall receive the highest payment amount to which they \nare eligible based on any one admission to Cook County Jail during the class period.  For \nexample, a Settlement Class Member who meets the definition of Class II on a particular \nadmission date and who meets the definition of only Class I on another admission date shall \nbe entitled to payment as a member of Class II. \nADDITIONAL CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION PROCEDURES \n39.  Settlement Claims shall be denied if the information in the Class List \nindicates that the Claimant is not eligible for payment.  For purposes of calculating the claim \npayments, the information in the Class List shall control and may not be challenged by \nClaimants except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement.  The Claims \nAdministrator shall provide copies of all Claim Forms (including any related documents and \nnon-privileged communications from claimants) to Class Counsel and Defendantโs counsel \non a weekly basis, and in any event by no later than seven (7) days after the deadline for \nsubmitting claims.  Within seventy-seven (77) days of the final date of submission of Claim \nForms, as set forth in Paragraph 24, the Claims Administrator shall provide to Class Counsel \nand Defendantโs counsel a list of the Settlement Class members who submitted Claim Forms, \nalong with (1) the Claims Administratorโs initial proposal for which Claim Forms are valid \nand timely, and (2) the proposed payments for each of the claimants.  Class Counsel and \nDefendantsโ counsel shall have twenty-one (21) days thereafter in which to confer regarding \n(1) which Claim Forms are valid and timely and (2) the appropriate payments (if any) for \neach claim.  If Class Counsel and counsel for Defendant cannot agree on whether any \nparticular claim is entitled to payment under the settlement, they shall submit the issue to the \nCourt.  The Courtโs decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. \n27 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 28 of 50 PageID #:13780\n40.  Where the Claims Administrator, in its discretion, elects to notify the \nClaimant of a defect in the Claim Form, such as the failure to sign the Claim Form, such \nnotification must be mailed as soon as practicable upon the Claims Administratorโs receipt of \nthe Claim Form, and in no event may the deficiency notice be mailed later than eighty-two \n(82) days after the Mailed Notice Date.  The Claimant shall have twenty-one (21) days from \nthe date the deficiency notification was mailed to cure the defect.  The Claims \nAdministratorโs failure to timely notify a Settlement Class Member of a potential defect in \nthat individualโs Claim Form will mean that the alleged deficiency must be disregarded for \npurposes of determining eligibility for payment awards.  The Claims Administrator may, in \nits discretion, disregard any deficiency in the Claim Form for purposes of determining \neligibility for payment.   \n41.  Within one hundred and ten (110) days of the Mailed Notice Date, the \nClaims Administrator shall mail to all Claimants who submitted Claim Forms a notice \ninforming the Claimant of the determination as to whether, and how much money (if any), he \nor she is entitled to receive under the Settlement, but this notice shall be sent only to those \nClaimants for whom the Claims Administrator has made a determination about eligibility for \npayment that is different from, or inconsistent with, the information claimed by the claimant \non his or her Claim Form.  The letter shall also advise the Claimant that he or she may object \nto the amount of the payment, or to the denial of payment, by mailing to the Claims \nAdministrator, within twenty-two (22) days after the date that the Claims Administrator mails \nthe notice, a written and signed statement setting forth the basis for that objection, including \nany documents that support the Class Memberโs objection, such as charging documents or \ncourt papers.  Any objection to the aforementioned notice regarding payment amount that is \nnot postmarked within that twenty-two (22) day period shall be waived.  The only valid basis \nfor an objection is that the criteria set forth in Paragraphs 34 and 35 were not properly applied \n28 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 624-1 Filed: 11/18/10 Page 29 of 50 PageID #:13781\nto the Claimant.  The Claims Administrator shall forward any objections to Class Counsel \nand counsel for Defendant within three (3) days of receipt.  The Parties shall seasonably \nreport to the Court any objections that have been submitted and seek the Courtโs resolution of \nthese objections no later than fourteen (14) days after the postmark deadline for the \nsubmission of these objections. The Parties shall also report to the Court regarding their joint \nor respective recommendation for resolution of each of the objections.    \n42.  Defendant will pay the Attorneysโ Fee Award, the Incentive Awards, \nand the Testifying Class Member Incentive Awards within thirty-seven (37) days after the \nFinal Approval Order is entered.   \n43.  Defendants will fund the remainder of the Settlement Fund within \neighty-five (85) days after the entry of the Final Approval Order, which amount the Claims \nAdministrator shall hold in trust and distribute in accordance with the terms of this \nAgreement.   \n44.  The Claims Administrator shall distribute payments within ninety-one \n(91) days of the entry of the Final Approval Order to each Settlement Class Member who \nsubmitted a valid Claim Form.  The check will be mailed to the Settlement Class Member at \nthe address indicated on the Claim Form.  The Claims Administrator will be responsible for \nall tax withholding and reporting as required by law, including for issuing any necessary IRS \n1099 form(s) to Settlement Class Members.

DEVINE, \nStateโs Attorney of Cook County, through his assistant, Francis J. Catania, and moves this \nHonorable Court pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to enter summary \njudgment in its favor and to dismiss Plaintiffโs complaint.  In support thereof, Defendant states as \nfollows: \nINTRODUCTION \n  Defendant  County  of  Cook  stands  accused  of  having  a  policy  of  strip  searching  jail \ndetainees in an abusive manner and also a policy of strip searching persons charged with minor \ncrimes  without  reasonable  suspicion  that  they  may  be  carrying  contraband1 [EXHIBIT A, Third \nAmended  Complaint].  The  County  of  Cook  is  not  liable  because  the  County  does  not  set \noperational policy for the Cook County Department of Corrections and under Section 1983 there \nis no  respondeat superior liability.  As a matter of well settled Seventh Circuit law,  the County \nof Cook does not set policy for the Sheriff of Cook County and can have no direct liability for \npolicies of the Sheriff because the County is unable to create or change such policies regarding \nthe operation of the Cook County Department of Corrections. In addition, the strip search policy \nemployed  by  the  Office  of  the  Sheriff  of  Cook  County  does  not  violate  the  constitution.  The \nevidence in this record reveals only that the Sheriff is motivated to strip search detainees ONLY \n                                                 \n1 All other claims in this suit have been settled and only these claims remain.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 2 of 15\nbecause of the need to stop the introduction of weapons and contraband into the jail to preserve \nthe safety and security of the jail, its employees and its detainees and prisoners. \n \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n \n  A  motion  for  summary  judgment  should  be  granted  when  โthe  pleadings,  the  discovery \nand disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material \nfact.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). However, a โ[p]laintiff may not rely only on the bare assertions of \nhis pleadings.โ Keri v. Bd. of Trs. of Purdue Univ., 458 F.3d 620, 651 (7th Cir. 2006) (citing Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 56(e)) (emphasis added). Local government units, such as the County of Cook, are not \nliable under ยง 1983 solely on a theory of respondeat superior. Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436 \nU.S. 658 at 690-91, 694, 98 S. Ct. 2018, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1978). A section 1983 action may be \nbrought  against  a  local  government  when  the  local  government  is  shown  to  be  the  โmoving \nforceโ behind the constitutional violation.  Monell, 436 U.S. at 690 n.55. In  Monell, the Supreme \nCourt  created  two  means  of  establishing  local  governmental  liability  under  section  1983:  policy \nand  custom.  A  government  policy  or  custom  can  be  established  in  two  ways.  Policy  is  made \nwhen  a  โdecision  maker  possessing  final  authority  to  establish  municipal  policy  with  respect  to \nthe actionโ issues an official proclamation, policy or edict. A course of conduct is considered to \nbe  a  โcustomโ  when,  though  not  authorized  by  law,  such  practices  of  state  officials  [are]  so \npermanent  and  well  settledโ  as  to  virtually  constitute  law.  The [County] is not required to pay \nany damages where neither it nor its employee is liable.  Tibbs v. City of Chicago, 2005 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 4510 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 8, 2005). \nFACTS \n  Plaintiffs  have  pleaded  that  the  County  of  Cook  is  directly  liable  for  conducting  strip \nsearches  in  the  Cook  County  Department  of  Corrections.  The  complaint  describes  this  as  a \nblanket policy of the County of Cook. [EXHIBIT A, Third Amended Complaint Paragraphs 6-8 \nโComplaintโ]. The Complaint makes allegations at paragraphs 60(d), 66, 67, 75, 79, 84, 88, 93, \nand  98  that  the  County  of  Cook  has  such  policies,  yet  plaintiff  can  point  to  no  evidence  to \nsupport that jail strip search policy is a policy of the County of Cook. Indeed, paragraphs 101 \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 3 of 15\nand 104 of the complaint allege County employees participated in causing the harms alleged by \nthe strip search policy, yet no evidence in the factual record shows Cook County itself; any Cook \nCounty  policy  maker;  or  any  Cook  County  employee  with  policy  making  authority  made  such \npolicy or policy. \n  All witnesses in this case who discuss the strip search policy are employees of the Sheriff \nof  Cook  County:  Deputy  Marlon  Jones,  Deputy  Alvin  Montique,  Sgt.  Erica  Queen,  Deputy \nBryon Hatton, Deputy Brian Doyle, Dan  Brown, Scott Kurtovich, Salvador Godinez and former \nSheriff Michael Sheahan are all employees of the Office of the Sheriff [SOF #1-5]. \n  There  are  two  male  class  representatives  in  the  case.  Plaintiff/class  representative  Ronald \nJohnson  was  told  to  look  at  wall,  not  to  look  in  any  other  direction  except  straight  ahead \n[EXHIBIT  B,  Deposition  of  Ronald  Johnson  55:1-6].  When  ordered  to  put  his  clothes  on, \nplaintiff/class  representative  Ronald  Johnson  could  tell  other  detainees  were  dressing  around  him \n[Exhibit  B, Johnson 67:21-24] but didnโt care about them and wasnโt observing them [Exhibit B, \nJohnson  68:1-3].  Plaintiff/class  representative  Kim  Young  testified  about  being  taken  to  a \ngymnasium [SOF #9; EXHIBIT C, Young, 141:23-24 to 142:1-6] with 15-20 other females. A \nguard, ordered to disrobe and expose parts of her body to the guard, observed young. There was \na divider separating her from other women. [SOF #9; Young, 142:12]  This was different from \nwhen she was strip-searched in Waukesha County Jail in 2001. [SOF #10; Young, 143:3-8]. In \n2001 she stood in line, and the women behind her could see her [SOF #10; Young, 143:12-15]. \nThere are no witnesses and no evidence showing that the County of Cook directs policy-making \nby  employees  of  the  Sheriff  regarding  the  operation  of  the  Cook  County  Department  of \nCorrections.  For  example,  plaintiff  deposed  Marlon  Jones  [SOF  #1;  Jones,  4:9-12],  Alvin \nMontique [SOF #2; Montique, 9:1-24], Erica Queen [SOF #3; Queen, 4:12-13], Bryan Hatton \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 4 of 15\n[SOF #4; Hatton, 5:8-9], and Brian Doyle [SOF #5; Hatton, 5:1-11]. Each of these persons is a \nSheriffโs  officer  working  at  the  jail  and  each  was  trained  as  an  employee  of  the  Office  of  the \nSheriff. [SOF# 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Nearly all persons who are remanded to the jail actually enter the \njailโs  general  population  the  evening  of  processing  [SOF#29,  Kurtovich  111:24-112:2].  The \npurpose  of  strip-searching  persons  before  they  enter  the  general  population  is  to  assure \ncontraband  does  not  enter  the  jail  facility  [SOF#30,  Brown  145:12-16].  Although  scanning \nmachines  are  used  more  and  more,  the  technology  is  not  sufficiently  developed  that  strip-\nsearching can be abandoned altogether [SOF#31, Martin 173:6-13]   \nARGUMENT \n  On April 25, 2007, the Court certified two classes under Rule 23: (1) all males who were \nsubjected  to  a  strip  search  and/or  a  visual  body  cavity  search  as  new  detainees  at  the  Cook \nCounty Jail on or after January 30, 2004; and (2) all persons charged only with misdemeanor or \nlesser  offenses  not  involving  drugs  or  weapons  who  were  subjected to a strip search and/or a \nvisual body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook County Jail on or after January 30, 2004. \nThe Complaint asserts that the County of Cook is liable for these strip searches, but the law and \nfactual record of this case show the County of Cook maintains no such policy and even if it did \nthe policy of the Sheriff in this regard is not unconstitutional. \nI.  THE COUNTY IS NOT LIABLE FOR CREATING OR IMPLEMENTING JAIL \nINTAKE STRIP SEARCH POLICY \n  It is undisputed that all the events in  this case took place at the Cook County Department \nof  Corrections.  Pursuant  to  Illinois  law  the  Sheriff  is  statutory  custodian  of  the  jail.  He  or  she \nshall  have  the  custody  and  care  of  the  courthouse  and  jail  of  his  or  her  county,  except  as  is \notherwise provided. See 55 ILCS 5/3-6017. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 5 of 15\n  Also as a matter of law, the Sheriff and his deputies are not County employees and, as a \nresult, the County cannot be held liable for the alleged conduct of the Sheriff or his deputies.  See \nMoy v. County of Cook, 159 Ill. 2d 519, 640 N.E.2d 926, 931 (1994) (holding that โthe sheriff is \na county officer and, as such, is not in an employment relationship with the County of Cookโ and \nโtherefore,  the  county  may  not  be  held  vicariously  liable  for  the  sheriffโs  alleged  negligent \nconduct.โ)  accord OโConnor v. County of Cook,  787 N.E.2d 185, (1st Dist. March 10, 2003) \n(following  Moy  and  holding  that  the  County  does  not  โbear  any  vicarious  liability  for  the  acts \nand omissions of the Sheriff and his staff.โ)   \n  Indeed, the Sheriff of  Cook County is an independently elected constitutional officer who \nanswers only to the electorate, not to the County government.   Thompson v. Duke, 882 F.2d \n1180,  1187 (7th Cir. 1989),  cert. denied, 495 U.S. 929 (1990). Similarly, Ryan v. County of \nDuPage,  45  F.3d  1090,  1092  (7th  Cir.  1995)  affirmed  dismissal  the  plaintiffโs  Section  1983 \nclaims against DuPage County based upon the alleged conduct of the DuPage County Sheriff and \nstated  that  โit  is  plain  that  the  county  was  properly  dismissed;  Illinois  sheriffs are independently \nelected  officials  not  subject  to  the  control  of  the  county.โ  By  statute,  Cook  County  Deputy \nSheriffs  and  employees  of  the  Department  of  Corrections  are  appointed  by  the  Sheriff  and \nperform all of their duties in the name of the Sheriff.  See 745 ILCS 5/3-6008 and 5/3-6015.  The \nCounty  lacks  the  authority  to  establish  any  policies  concerning  training  or  the  performance  of \nduties by employees of the Sheriffโs office.  Thompson, 882 F.2d at 1187.   \n  In  order  to  establish  liability  against  the  County,  Plaintiff  must  identify  the  illegal \nconduct  properly  attributable  to  the  County  and  show  that  the  County  was  the  โmoving  forceโ \nbehind the alleged injury. This means that the Plaintiff must show that the action was taken with \nthe requisite degree of culpability and demonstrate a direct causal link between the County action \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 6 of 15\nand the deprivation of federal rights. See Bd. of the County Comm'rs of Bryan County v. Brown, \n520 U.S. 397, 404, 117 S. Ct. 1382, 137 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1997). Plaintiffs fail to show that any \nillegal  conduct  was  attributable  to  the  County;  much  less  show  County  was  a  moving  force \nbehind the injury. Therefore the County is not liable as alleged in the Complaint. \n  Because  the  Sheriff  and  his  employees  have  no  employment  relationship  with  the \nCounty, the County cannot be held liable for the alleged misconduct of the individual defendants \nin  this  matter.    See  Moy,  640  N.E.2d  at  931.    Moreover,  even  if  the  deputies  were  County \nemployees, under ยง 1983, there is no respondeat superior liability.  Perkins v. Lawson, 312 F.3d. \n872, 875 (7th Cir. 2002). Count VII paragraph 100 of the complaint alleges County of Cook is \nliable on a  respondeat superior basis. There is no County employee remaining in the case. Scott, \nMartin,  Rothstein,  Winship,  Bersky  and  Fagus  have  all  been  dismissed  [SOF  #15].  Under  the \ndoctrine of respondeat superior, an employer can be held vicariously liable for the tortious acts \nof its  employees. Pyne v. Witmer, 129 Ill. 2d 351, 359, 135 Ill. Dec. 557, 543 N.E.2d 1304 \n(1989) and  Alms v. Baum, 343 Ill. App. 3d 67, 71 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st Dist. 2003). The remaining \ndefendants  are  employees  of  the  Office  of  the  Sheriff,  who  has  sole  authority  to  direct  their \nactions. For purposes of  respondeat superior liability, a servant is one whose physical conduct in \nperforming the services is subject to the master's control or right to control Morgan v. Veterans \nof Foreign Wars of the United States, 206 Ill. App. 3d 569, 575, 151 Ill. Dec. 802, 565 N.E.2d 73 \n(1990). The County of Cook exerts no control over the named defendants or any other employee \nof the Sheriff. \n  In  prior  pleadings,  Plaintiffs  have  suggested  they  adequately  alleged  customs,  policies, \nand practices of the County of Cook violated federal rights of class members. No evidence exists \nin  the  factual  record  of  this  case  to  support  such  allegations.    Plaintiffs  allege  that  their  injuries \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 7 of 15\ncame  about  because  the  County  followed  a  policy  of  strip-searching  detainees  in  a  harassing \nmanner. However, even if true, this would not render  the County liable. While a sheriff is viewed \nas a county officer, โcount[ies] [are] given no authority to control the office of the sheriff,โ Moy \nv. County of Cook, 640 N.E. 2d 926, 929 (Ill.1994). The Seventh Circuit has explicitly ruled that \nIllinois  counties  are  not  liable  for  their  sheriffsโ  actions  under  Monell,  stating  that  โIllinois \nsheriffs  are  independently  elected  officials  not  subject  to  the  control  of  the  county.โ  Ryan  v. \nCounty of DuPage, 45 F.3d 1090, 1092 (7th Cir. 1995). Thus, County states  that any policies \npromulgated by the Sheriff of Cook County or Michael F. Sheahan cannot be attributed to Cook \nCounty, and Cook County cannot be held liable under a respondeat superior theory. See  Carver \nv. Sheriff of LaSalle County, 203 Ill. 2d 497, 787 N.E.2d 127, 136-37, 272 Ill. Dec. 312 (2003) \n(\"โฆ [S]heriffs answer to the electorate of the county from which they are elected, and not to the \ncounty board.\") Finally, in  Ryan v. County of DuPage, 45 F.3d 1090, 1092 (7th Cir. 1995), the \nSeventh Circuit considered a ยง 1983 suit against the sheriff of DuPage County that attempted to \nimpose  municipal  liability  on  the  County  of  DuPage, for  actions  undertaken  by  the  sheriff,  the \npurported  policymaker  for  the  county.  In  Ryan,  they  affirmed  the  dismissal  of  the  county as a \ndefendant,  holding  that  the  sheriff  is  a  policymaker  for  the  county  sheriff's  office,  not  for  the \ncounty  itself.  Ryan,  45  F.3d  at  1092  and  described  Illinois  sheriffs  as  โindependently  elected \nofficials not subject to the control of the countyโ  Franklin v. Zaruba, 150 F.3d 682, 685 (7th Cir. \nIll. 1998). \n    The  Seventh  Circuit  has  recognized  that  in  Section  1983  claims  against  Illinois  sheriffs, \nIllinois  counties  have  a  duty  to  indemnify  judgments  or  settlements  entered  against  sheriffs  or \ntheir  deputies,  and  are  accordingly  necessary  and  indispensable  parties  for  purposes  of \nindemnification.  See Carver v. Sheriff of LaSalle Co., 324 F.3d 947 (7th Cir. 2003).  However, \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 8 of 15\nPlaintiffs, have not asserted a  Carver indemnification claim, but rather, have asserted only direct \nand  vicarious  liability  claims  against  the  County  of  Cook.  Such  direct  or  vicarious  liability \nclaims  are  not  viable  under  Thompson,  Ryan,  and  Moy.  If  the  Sheriff  remains  a  party  to  this \nlitigation  in  his  official  capacity,  Plaintiff  should  be  required  to  amend  his  Complaint  to  state  a \nproper Carver indemnification claim for declaration against the County of Cook. \nII. THE SHERIFF AND HIS EMPLOYEES DO NOT VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF \nDETAINEES UNDER THE 4TH AND 14TH AMENDMENTS \n  Assuming  Plaintiffs  are  allowed  to  amend  their  complaint  to  allege  a  proper  Carver \nindemnification  claim  against  the  County  of  Cook,  there  still  is  no  constitutional  violation  to \nindemnify.    There  is  no  constitutional  violation  where  the  strip  search  is  no  more  intrusive  than \nthe one the Supreme Court upheld in  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L. Ed. 2d \n447 (1979). First, and most fundamentally, the Court in  Bell addressed a strip search policy, not \nany  individual  searches  conducted  under  it.  The  Court  spoke  categorically about the policy, not \nspecifically about a particular search or an individual inmate. See  Bell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S. Ct. \nat 1885. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 538, 104 S. Ct. 3194, 3206, 82 L. Ed. 2d 393 (1984) \ncited Bell for the proposition that โ[i]n some contexts, . . . the Court has rejected the case-by-case \napproach  to  the  โreasonablenessโ  inquiry  in  favor  of  an  approach  that  determines  the \nreasonableness of contested practices in a categorical fashion.โ \n  The threshold determination here is whether a policy of strip search of a male detainee in \nthe  presence  of  other  male  detainees  and  male  officers  constitutes  a  constitutional  violation.  In \nthe  Complaint  Plaintiffs  allege  that  many  men  were  ordered  into  a  corridor  where  they  were \nrequired  to  disrobe  where  they  could  observe  each  other  in  large  groups.  Plaintiffsโ  claim  of  a \nconstitutional  violation  based  on  the  presence  of  officers  and  detainees  during  their  strip  search \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 9 of 15\napparently  satisfied  the  first  inquiry  for  a  municipal  liability  claim at the motion to dismiss stage. \nNow things are different. \n  The  evidence  in  this  case  comes  from  the  testimony  of  the  named  class  representatives. \nKim Young, Ronald Johnson, and William Jones, on behalf of themselves and a class of others \nsimilarly  situated, all testified as to certain procedures in regards to strip searching at the Cook \nCounty  Department  of  Corrections.  Johnson  and  Jones  spoke  of  group  strip  searches  but  each \ndescribed how guards told them to look straight ahead or at a line on the floor [SOF #6 & 7; \nJones, 31:15-22] [SOF #8; Johnson, 55:1-4] and not to look around. To contrast this group strip \nsearch, Kim Young testified that following her arrest and bond hearing in January 2005, she was \ngroup strip searched in a gymnasium, but there was a divider which shielded her from the view \nof others except of course the guard. [SOF #9 & 10; Young, 141:23-24 to 142:1-6, 12]. This was \nonly  slightly  different  from  her  previous  experience  just  4  years  prior  in  Wisconsin  when  she \nwas  strip  searched  individually  but  in  a  place  where  others  in  line  could  see  her.  [SOF  #10; \nYoung,  143:3-15].  The  Wisconsin  search  was  also  a  group  strip  search.  None  of  the  class \nrepresentatives  say  much  beyond  the  simple  fact  that  strip  searches  were  done  in  groups  of \npersons who were involved in the process as new detainees. It is telling that Plaintiff Jones did \nnot even discuss the search with other detainees because the strip search seemed to be a normal \nprocedure so no one talked about it after it was done. [SOF#20, EXHIBIT D, Jones, 48:22-23]. If \nPlaintiffs/Class Representatives understand the need for strip searches in jails lawyers and judges \ncan  surely  understand  why  the  Supreme  Court  has  recognized  that  security  needs  in  the  Bell \nsituation  found  to  justify  strip  searching  an  inmate  re-entering the jail population after a contact \nvisit are no greater or less than those that justify searching an arrestee when he is being booked \ninto  the  general  population  for  the  first  time.  At  least  one  Federal  Circuit,  the  11th  Circuit in  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 10 of 15\nAnd the searches conducted in the  Bell case were more intrusive, and thereby impinged more on \nprivacy interests, than those conducted in this case (see below, note 39 cited in  Bell v. Wolfish, \n441 U.S. 520, 558 (U.S. 1979). \n  The  judicial  orders  issued  at  the  motion  to  dismiss  stage  and  the  motion  for  class \ncertification  stage  assumed  that  group  strip  searches  violated  the  4th  Amendment.  A  survey  of \ncases  addressing  this  issue  directly  has  NOT  found  any  saying  group  searches  are \nunconstitutional.  In  San Bernardino, the Courtโs order on the motion to dismiss considered the \nfact that strip searches occurred in groups as a  factor weighing against their constitutionality but \ndid  not  decide  whether  group  strip  searches  independently  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment. See \nCraft v. County of San Bernardino, 468 F.Supp.2d 1172 (C.D.Cal. 2006). Craft v. County of San \nBernardino, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27526 (D. Cal. 2008). In Adams, when denying Plaintiffโs \nmotion  for  summary  judgment,  the  Court  ruled  plaintiff  failed  to  provide  evidence  that  his \nconstitutional  rights  were  violated.  Rather,  plaintiff  relies  solely  on  the  broad  theory  that  all \ngroup strip  searches  are  unlawful.  The  complaint  was  ruled  to  not  state  a  claim.  Additionally,  in \nthat case, plaintiff provided  no evidence that County policy was behind the searches of plaintiff.  \nAdams v. County of Sacramento, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15666, 8-9 (D. Cal. 2007). In Boissiere \nv. Foti, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11266 (D. La. 1988) the court was asked among other things to \ndetermine if group strip searches violated the right to privacy. Again the answer was no. \n  Recently,  the  11th Circuit had a chance to look at, among others, the very issue raised \nhere about group searches. The court's Powell v. Barrett en banc concern was in strip searches \nconducted on five detainees who were members of the arrestee group where neither the charge \nitself  nor  any  other  circumstance  supplied  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  detainee  might  be \nconcealing  contraband.  The  court  upheld  the  policy  of  strip  searches,  at  least  where  the  strip \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 11 of 15\nsearch was no more intrusive than the one the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in  Bell v. Wolfish. To \nthe extent that the court's decision in  Wilson v. Jones, 251 F. 3d 1340 (11th Cir. 2001), finding a \nconstitutional  violation,  was  inconsistent  with  the  court's  present  reasoning,  the  court  overruled \nit. At least one district judge in this Circuit relied in part on the reasoning of the now overruled \nWilson  case:  Judge  Gettleman  citing  with  favor  the  Wilson  court  conclusion  regarding  persons \ncharged  with  misdemeanors  a  strip  search  policy  that  did  not  require  reasonable  suspicion \nviolated Fourth Amendment Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 405 F. Supp. 2d 933, 940 (N.D. Ill. \n2005) [citing Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1342 (11th Cir. 2001)]. In Calvin, the Court found \na  county  detention  facilityโs  blanket  strip  search  policy  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment  as \napplied to arrestees detained on a failure-to-appear warrant in a misdemeanor or traffic case and \nmisdemeanor  or  traffic  detainees  who  were  being  processed  for  release  following  a  court \nappearance.  In  evaluating  the  Bell  decision,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  correctly  notes  that  โthe \nSupreme Court instructed us that jail officials should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the \nadoption and execution of policies and practices to preserve internal order and discipline and to \nmaintain  jail  security.  Assuming  that  the  detainees  being  booked  into  the  jail  retained  some \nFourth  Amendment  rights,  those  rights  were  not  violated  by  a  policy  or  practice  of  strip \nsearching each one of them, including full body visual searches, as part of the booking processes. \nThe [Bell] court rejected a reasonable suspicion requirement for such policy or practice.โ Powell \nv. Barrett, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18907 (11th Cir. Ga. Sept. 4, 2008). \n  Specifically, the Powell en banc court was met with the following factual scenario drawn \nfrom the District Court record:  \n[H]aving the arrested person go into a large room with a group of up to thirty to \nforty  other  inmates,  remove  all  of  his  clothing,  and  place  the  clothing  in  boxes. \n(Id. P 181.) The  entire group of arrestees then takes a shower in a single large \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 12 of 15\nroom.  (Id.  PP182,  238.)  After  the  group  shower  each  arrestee  \"either singly, or \nstanding  in  a  line  with  others,  is  visually  inspected  front  and  back  by  deputies.\" \n(Id. P183.) \"Then each man [takes] his clothes to a counter and exchange[s] his \nown  clothes  for  a  jail  jumpsuit.\"  (Id.  P  239.)  Identifying  an  illustrative  case,  the \ncomplaint  alleges  that  one  of  these  five  plaintiffs  \"along  with  every  other  inmate \nin the process, had to stand before a guard front and center, and show his front \nand back sides while naked.\" (Id. P240.) There is no allegation that any members \nof  the  opposite  sex  either  conducted  the  visual  searches  or  were  present  while \nthey  were  being  conducted.  Nor  is  there  any  allegation  that  the  searches  were \nconducted in an abusive manner.  Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 at   (11th Cir. \nGa. Sept. 4, 2008). Emphasis supplied. \nThis  group  strip  search  practice  is  little  different  in  terms  of  numbers  and  duration  as  that \nemployed  by  the  Sheriff.  Aside  from  there  being  a  group  searched  at  one  time,  none  of  the \nplaintiff/class  representatives  testifies  about  specific  conduct  that  might  indicate  the  search  was \nconducted as a matter of policy, with the intent to abuse. All agree that the place where the male \nstrip  search  is  conducted  is  a  narrow  hallway.  No  evidence  exists  that  shows  members  of  the \nopposite sex were present during the search. There are really no allegations of verbal abuse by \nguards  directed  toward  the  plaintiff/class  representatives.  There  is  no  proof  showing  these \nplaintiff/class  representatives  were  physically  hurt  by  deputies.  Even  if  we  are  to  believe \nsomeone present during the strip search was  threatened or  that a deputy  used racially derogatory \nlanguage  in  the  present  of  the  plaintiff/class  representative,  allegations  such  as  these  simply  do \nnot implicate protected constitutional rights. See  DeWalt v. Carter, 224 F.3d  607, 612 (7th Cir. \n2000)  (even  โracially derogatory language, while unprofessional and deplorable, does not violate \nthe  Constitutionโ).  There  is  no  claim  that  the  strip  search  was  performed  any  differently  than \nthose  already  approved  in  Bell,  which  were  conducted  as  a  matter  of  policy  on  all  person \ndetained.  In  fact,  the  Bell  court  described  the  precise  nature  of  the  strip  searches  done  at  the \nMCC: โIf the inmate is a male, he must lift his genitals and bend over to spread his buttocks for \nvisual  inspection.  The  vaginal  and  anal  cavities  of  female  inmates  also  are  visually  inspected. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 13 of 15\nThe inmate is not touched by security personnel at any time during the visual search procedure. \n573 F.2d, at 131; Brief for Petitioners 70, 74 n. 56.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558 (U.S. \n1979). And again, the Bell Court upheld this method of strip searching detainees.  \nIII.   EQUAL PROTECTION GROUND FAILS SINCE THE EVIDENCE SHOWS NO \nSIGNIFICANT DISPARITY OF TREATMENT IS BASED ON GENDER \n  The Complaint alleges that these strip searches are a violation of both the 4th Amendment \nand  the  14th  Amendment.  According  to  the  plaintiffsโ  theory,  since  women  have  dividers  and \nmen do not, men have an equal protection claim. There remains no evidence or law supporting a \nposition  that  dividers  are  a  constitutionally  required  minimum.  Plaintiffs  suggest  that  the  only \ndifference between the searches conducted on men and women is based on gender. The evidence \nhowever  highlights  several  reasons  men  and  women  are  not  similarly  situated.  In  addition  to \ngender,  1)  women  are  searched  in  a  gymnasium  giving  rise  to  the  need  for  dividers  to  afford \nmore  protection  from  prying  eyes  not  associated  with  the  process  while  men  are  searched  in  a \ntunnel  where  access  is  easily  controlled;  2)  women  have  monthly  bodily  processes  that  might \ncause  additional  concern  for  privacy  due  to  additional  embarrassment  which  men  clearly  do  not \nhave  to  deal  with;  and  3)  the  numbers  of  women  entering  the  jail  far  less  than  men,  which  by \nitself  makes  treating  males  different.  There  is  no  essential  difference  between  the  use  of  a \nprivacy screen and the use of an order not to look at the persons next to you. \n  It is important to note that women are not strip searched in the same area as men. Women \nare strip searched in the division to which they have been assigned and there is no evidence that \nmale  correctional  officers  are  ever  involved  in  that  process.  Women  are  searched  in  a \ngymnasium [SOF#9], while men are searched in a hallway [SOF#16]. This difference alone can \nreasonably  support  the  use  of  dividers  in  a  gymnasium  where  the  physical  structure  makes  the \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 14 of 15\nplace of the search less conducive to affording privacy and increases the likelihood that someone \nnot  involved  in  the  process  would  be  able  to  observe.  Each  male  plaintiff/class  representative \ndescribed how he was ordered to face the wall and/or look at a line on the floor, thereby being \nordered not to look around. This direction to avoid looking at others serves the same โprivacyโ \nconcern  as  the  dividers  in  a  gymnasium.  A  policy  is  subject  to  scrutiny  under  the  equal \nprotection clause of the fourteenth amendment, which requires that the party seeking to uphold a \npolicy  that  expressly  discriminates  on  the  basis  of  gender  must  carry  the  burden  of  showing  an \nโexceedingly  persuasive  justificationโ  for  the  differing  treatment.  Mississippi  University  for \nWomen v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 102 S. Ct. 3331, 3336, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1090 (1982). If the \nevidence  showed  that  women  were  not  strip  searched  and  men  were,  this  might  raise  an  equal \nprotection issue. However, the factual record shows that both men and women are subjected to a \nstrip  search  prior  to  admission  into  general  population.  Plaintiffs  can  point  to  no  policy,  which \nexpressly  discriminates;  they  can  only  point  to  one  policy  of  strip  searching  detainees  at  intake, \nwhere an order to males not to look at each other is the functional equivalent of a privacy screen. \nCONCLUSION \n  At  this  juncture,  the  Plaintiffs  case  shows  that  no  policy  of  the  County  has  caused  a \nviolation. It shows that the Sheriff has conducted strip searches  in accordance with those already \napproved by the Supreme  Court  in Bell. That the Class representatives themselves can point to \nnothing  beyond  group  strip  searches,  applicable  to  all  including  women,  and  that  those  persons \nare  by  and  large  charged  with  felonies  and  that  some  offices  might  use  rude  and  offensive \nlanguage  in  the  presence  of  detainees  being  searched โ though it seems to be comments about \nsmell. \n  Despite  Bell  v.  Wolfish,  Courts  still  have  difficulty  evaluating  a  jail  strip  search  policy. \nThe  Sixth  Circuit  identified  one  such  problem.  A  district  judge  had  allowed  emotional  response \nto be his guide. The  6th Circuit wrote:  โ[i]t is troubling to consider how much of our visceral \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 225      Filed 11/10/2008     Page 15 of 15\nreactions to strip searches, pro and con, may rest upon perceptions of  class and sex.โ See Dufrin \nv. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1088 (6th Cir. 1983): โIn directing a verdict for Dufrin, the trial judge \nobserved  that  he  did  not  like  the  idea  of  police  routing  โmiddle-class housewivesโ out of their \nbeds โat 11:30 at nightโ and forcing those housewives to submit to strip-searches . . . . We cannot \nbelieve from these comments that the trial court was implying that a different rule ought to exist \nfor  a female who was not middle-class, or who was not a housewife, or who was not from the \nsuburbs.  Any  suggestion  [otherwise]  is  in  our  view  neither  legally  nor  morally  supportableโ \nDufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1088 (6th Cir. Mich. 1983). This court should not let visceral \nreactions to strip searches be the guide.  \n  WHEREFORE,  Defendant  County  of  Cook  respectfully  requests  that  the  Court  grant \nSummary  Judgment  in  favor  of  the  County  of  Cook,  dismiss  plaintiffsโ  liability  claims  against \nthe  County  as  set  forth  in  the  complaint,  in  their  entirety.  In  addition,  the  Defendant  County  of \nCook  asks  this  court  to  rule  that  Plaintiffs  have  not  pleaded  a  claim  for  indemnification  and \ndismiss  the  County  entirely.  In  the  alternative,  Defendant  County  of  Cook  asks  this  court  to \nmaintain the County of Cook as a party defendant solely for the purposes delineated in Carver v. \nSheriff of LaSalle Co. and order plaintiff to re-plead. Defendant County of Cook also requests the \nCourt order further relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate. \n          Respectfully Submitted, \n          RICHARD A.

The Court directs the Clerk to terminate motions 415 and 436, upon which the Court\npreviously ruled.\nO[ For further details see text below.] Docketing to mail notices.\nSTATEMENT\nA jury found in favor of the plaintiffs as to liability in this class action.  The defendant, Cook County Sheriff\nThomas Dart, has moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial.\n1. U.S. Department of Justice report\nThe Court admitted pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8) an excerpt of a report by the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice (USDOJ) issued to the Sheriff pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons\nAct, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997a.  The Sheriff argues that the report contained double-hearsay, it consisted of opinions\nand conclusions, and it was unfairly prejudicial, in part due to its purportedly late identification by plaintiffs. \nThis matter was fully briefed as a part of a pretrial motion in limine by Dart on which the Court heard\nextensive argument and made a detailed ruling.  See 7/29/09 Tr. 42-52.\nThe Court deals with Dartโs timeliness point first.  Plaintiffs persuasively argued in the motion in\nlimine briefing that it was Dart who should have produced the report in discovery but failed to do so. \nPlaintiffs discovered it on their own and identified it as a possible exhibit in reasonably prompt fashion after\ndiscovering it.  Dart has identified no real prejudice arising from the late disclosure.  Though he contends that\nthe information in the report could not be verified, the report itself contained an offer by USDOJ to provide\ninformation that would enable Dart to identify particular incidents referenced in the part of the report in\nquestion.  \nThe Court correctly ruled that the report qualified for admission under Rule 803(8).  In the language of that\nRule, the report amounted to โfactual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority\ngranted by law.โ  Fed. R. Evid. 803(8).  See, e.g., Palo v. Dallas County, No. 3:05-CV-0527-D, 2007 WL\n2140590, at *8 (N.D. Tex. 2007); R.G. v. Koller, 415 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1133 n.1 (D. Haw. 2006); McKnight\n06C552 Mercado vs. Dart Page 1 of  5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 495 Filed: 11/17/09 Page 2 of 5 PageID #:12037\nSTATEMENT\nv. District of Columbia, 412 F. Supp. 2d 127, 133 n.7 (D.D.C. 2006) (all admitting similar reports under Rule\n803(8)).  Dart argued prior to trial, and argues now, that the sources of information indicated lack of\ntrustworthiness, but that argument was unpersuasive.  Dartโs argument along these lines may have implicated\nthe appropriate weight to be given the report, but it did not affect the reportโs admissibility.  The same is true\nof Dartโs double-hearsay argument.  See generally Clark v. Clabaugh, 20 F.3d 1290, 1295 (3d Cir. 1994);\nMoss v. Ole South Real Estate, Inc., 933 F.2d 1300, 1309-10 (5th Cir. 1991); McClure v. Mexia, 750 F.2d\n396, 399-400 (5th Cir. 1985).  As indicated above, Dart had all the tools needed to attempt to refute the report\nif he wished to do so, and he had both the ability and the opportunity to argue its weight before the jury.\nDartโs objection also suggests that the Court should have excluded the report under Federal Rule of Evidence\n403 as unfairly prejudicial.  The Court is unpersuaded that the balancing required under Rule 403 favors\nexclusion.  Before evidence may be excluded under that rule, its probative value must be โsubstantially\noutweighedโ by the danger of unfair prejudice (etc).  Fed. R. Evid. 403 (emphasis added).  Such was not the\ncase here.\nFinally, and in any event, in the overall context of the trial Dart suffered no appreciable harm from the\nadmission of the USDOJ report.  The incidents described in the report were far less specific and detailed than\nthose discussed by the nearly twenty detainees who testified during the trial.  The juryโs determination\nregarding what happened during intake strip searches largely boiled down to a determination of whether to\nbelieve those witnesses.  The particular incidents referenced in the USDOJ report paled by comparison. \nThe Court also notes that Dart himself offered, and the Court admitted, reports by Illinois authorities\nregarding their inspections of the Cook County Jail.  These reports were admitted on the same basis as the\nUSDOJ report.  The USDOJ report was no less admissible than the state authoritiesโ reports.\n2. References to the L3 body scanning machine\nDefendant says that the Court excluded reference to the Jailโs use of a body scanning machine.  The Court\nagrees with plaintiffs that defendant has mischaracterized the record as well as the Courtโs ruling.\nAt the final pretrial conference, the Court became aware that in or around March 2009, the Cook County Jail\npurportedly had begun to use a body scanning machine to examine male inmates at intake, allegedly in lieu of\nstrip searches.  Plaintiffs objected to the admission of this evidence at trial primarily on the ground that they\nhad not been advised until late June 2009 (about six weeks before trial) of a policy change that supposedly\nhad taken place more than three months earlier and that, one could reasonably infer, had been decided upon\neven before that.  See July 27, 2009 Tr. 58-61.  Dart did not dispute that his counsel first advised plaintiffsโ\ncounsel about the change in policy in June 2009, three months after it supposedly went into effect.  Id. 63;\nsee also id. 60-61.  As a result, plaintiffs argued, they had been completely foreclosed from attempting to\ndetermine whether the policy was actually being enforced and whether strip searches were still occurring. \nId. 64.  \nBecause plaintiffs were hamstrung in responding to the claimed policy change, the Court ruled that the\nliability trial would cover only the period through March 18, 2009, the date on which the change purportedly\ntook effect.  Id. 64.  This made the alleged policy change effectively immaterial and irrelevant for purposes of\nthe trial.\nContrary to Dartโs argument in his post-trial motion, Dart himself injected into the trial the use of the body\nscanning machine for searches of male detainees.  See Pls.โ Resp. to Def.โs Mot. for Judg. at 9 (citing trial\n06C552 Mercado vs. Dart Page 2 of  5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 495 Filed: 11/17/09 Page 3 of 5 PageID #:12038\nSTATEMENT\ntranscript).  The Court allowed a good deal of this evidence to be admitted.  Dart contends that the Court\nโrefusedโ what Dart characterizes as his โattempt[ ] to explain why the L3 was being usedโ via witness Dan\nBrown.  Def.โs Mot. for Judg. at 6 (โThrough Dan Brown, the Sheriff attempted to explain why the L3 was\nbeing used.  The Court refused.  This ruling prevented a number of issues from being discussed.โ).  This, to\nbe charitable, is revisionist history.  During Brownโs examination, Dart introduced, without objection or\nadverse ruling, a good deal of evidence regarding an alleged โpilot projectโ relating to the L3 scanning\nmachine.  Tr. Vol. V 1169-71.  Plaintiffsโ counsel objected when the testimony reached a point where it\nappeared it might run afoul of the Courtโs pretrial ruling barring evidence regarding the claimed March 2009\npolicy change.  Id. 1172.  After hearing extensive argument outside the juryโs presence, the following\ninterchange took place between the Court and Dartโs counsel:\nTHE COURT:  So what additional are you planning to do at this point regarding with [sic] this\nwitness regarding the subject of this body scanning machine that is in these pictures and so\non?\nMR. CATANIA:  This one, nothing further.  We have another one coming up.  That is the\nfemaleโs body scan.\nId. 1180-81 (emphasis added).  Plaintiffsโ counsel advised that he did not object to introduction of evidence\nregarding use of a body scanning machine for searches of female detainees.  Id. 1181.\nIn short, the contemporaneous comments of Dartโs own counsel at the time of the Courtโs ruling put the lie to\nDartโs current argument that the Court โrefusedโ to allow witness Brown to explain further.  Rather, Dartโs\ncounsel said that he did not have further questions for Brown on the topic.\nFollowing this discussion, the Court determined that to avoid running afoul of the pretrial ruling concerning\nthe claimed policy change, no further evidence regarding use of a body scanning machine for searches of\nmale detainees would be introduced โuntil I have an opportunity to address this further.โ  Id. 1183-84.  At the\nstart of the next day of trial, after hearing further argument, the Court stated that โI donโt want there to be any\nfurther questions or answers that even by implication talk about a change in procedures in March of 2009 . . .\n.โ  Id., Vol. VI 1306-07.  The Court advised both sides that โif you think that thereโs something along those\nlines that you need to get in, on either side, you need to front it with me first at a sidebar before it is asked of\na witness and before you ask a question that I conclude after the fact is reasonably likely to draw testimony\nlike that out of a witnessโ mouth.โ  Id. 1308.  After this, Dart never once asked the Court to introduce further\nevidence regarding use of the L3 scanning machine.  In short, Dart has forfeited any argument regarding\nintroduction of further evidence about the L3 machine, and even if he had not done so, the argument is\nwithout merit, because he was offered an opportunity to advise the Court about any further evidence on the\ntopic he wished to offer, but never took that opportunity.\n3. Jury instructions\nIn his motion for new trial, Dart โadopt[ed] and incorporate[d] by reference all objections made to Plaintiffsโ\ntendered instructions as stated in the jury instruction conference.โ  Def.โs Mot. for Judg. at 6.  This one-\nsentence argument forfeits the issue because it fails to develop whatever points Dart was making.  See, e.g.,\nWhite Eagle Co-op. Assโn v. Conner, 553 F.3d 467, 476 n.6 (7th Cir. 2009) (โ[P]erfunctory and undeveloped\narguments, and arguments that are unsupported by pertinent authority, are waived . . . .โ).\nIn any event, the sole objection that Dart pressed involved whether the Court should give the jury a list of\n06C552 Mercado vs. Dart Page 3 of  5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 495 Filed: 11/17/09 Page 4 of 5 PageID #:12039\nSTATEMENT\nfactors to be considered in deciding plaintiffsโ due process and equal protection claims.  See Trial Tr. 1890-\n91 (discussing defense comments on instructions).  Indeed, that is the only instruction that Dart discussed in\nhis reply brief on the current motion after plaintiffs made their argument about forfeiture.  See Def.โs Reply at\n10.  The Court declined to give a list of factors because it found them incomplete and, in part, argumentative,\na ruling that the Court continues to believe was correct.  In any event, the Court specifically permitted\ncounsel to discuss these or any other factors during closing argument.  Trial Tr. 1890.  \nDart also complains that the instructions omitted or downplayed the factor of jail security.  The Court\ndisagrees.  The instructions made it clear that jail security was โan important governmental objective and a\nlegitimate governmental purpose.โ  See, e.g., Jury Instructions 14.\n4. Weight and sufficiency of the evidence\nDart argues that the juryโs verdict on each of the claims was against the manifest weight of the evidence.  A\ncourt considering a motion for new trial may not set aside the jury's verdict โif a reasonable basis exists in the\nrecord to support the verdict, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, and\nleaving issues of credibility and weight of the evidence to the jury.โ  Kapelanski v. Johnson, 390 F.3d 525,\n520 (7th Cir. 2004); see also, Wipf v. Kowalski, 519 F.3d 380, 384 (7th Cir. 2008). \nIn their argument, Dart repeatedly mischaracterizes plaintiffsโ claims that were tried to the jury.  As was\nmade abundantly clear on numerous occasions, plaintiffs did not challenge the fact of a strip search; rather\nthey challenged the manner in which Sheriffโs personnel conducted the search.  In its final instructions, the\nCourt described the partiesโ contentions as follows:\nThe plaintiffs contend that upon intake to the Cook County Jail, they were subjected to\nsearches that were conducted in an inhumane and unreasonable manner, and that they were\ninappropriately subjected to harsher searches than women.\nThe defendant contends that searches were conducted in an appropriate manner and for the\npurpose of safety and security at the Jail.  The defendant also contends that any differential\ntreatment of men and women was justified. \nJury Instructions 11.  Plaintiffsโ equal protection claim concerned differences in which men and women were\nsearched on intake; their due process claim required them to prove that โ[s]trip searches were done in a\nmanner that was not rationally related to a legitimate non-punitive governmental purpose, or the searches\nwere done in a manner that appears excessive in relation to that purposeโ; and their Fourth Amendment claim\nrequired them to prove that they โwere searched in an unreasonable manner.โ  Jury Instructions 15-17.\nThe juryโs decision on each of the claims largely boiled down to a credibility contest, as the Court has\ndiscussed.  The plaintiffsโ witnesses all testified that they were strip searched and body cavity searched in a\ngroup, shoulder to shoulder, with no privacy protection.  The jury was entitled to believe these witnessesโ\ntestimony over that of the several Sheriffโs personnel who testified in contrary fashion.  In addition, enough\nof the plaintiffsโ witnesses testified that they were subjected to degrading comments and treatment that the\njury was entitled to find that this, like the practice of strip searching and body cavity searching new detainees\nin a group without privacy, amounted to a policy of the Sheriff.  Moreover, Dart has cited no case that holds\nthat group strip searches conducted in this manner on pretrial detainees are per se legal (indeed the law is to\nthe contrary, see Mays v. Springborn, 575 F.3d 643, 650 (7th Cir. 2009)), or that suggests that a jury finding\nof liability in this situation is against the manifest weight of the evidence.  In addition, Dartโs arguments that\n06C552 Mercado vs. Dart Page 4 of  5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 495 Filed: 11/17/09 Page 5 of 5 PageID #:12040\nSTATEMENT\ncertain elements of what plaintiffs claimed are not illegal or improper standing alone misses the point; the\njury properly considered the totality of the circumstances, not bits of evidence considered in isolation.  In\nsum, no new trial is required, nor are defendants entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nAs part of their โmanifest weightโ argument, Dart challenges additional evidentiary rulings that the Court\nmade.  He advances no reason why any of these rulings were incorrect, let alone prejudicial in a way that\nwould require a new trial.\n- First, Dartโs counsel never offered any decent reason why the fact that a detainee had had a bond\nhearing had anything to do with the proper manner of an intake strip search.  In any event, Dart\nmanaged to get in, on several occasions, evidence that detainees had come from the court system\nbefore the intake search, and he was not precluded from arguing that this evidence might show that\nthe plaintiffsโ witnesses were mistaken or lying about what happened to them.\n- Second, the nature of the testifying plaintiffsโ charges had no bearing on how they were searched, as\nDartโs witnesses made it clear that all detainees are searched the same way, irrespective of the charges\nagainst them.  And as plaintiffs point out, Dart was able to introduce before the jury the fact that the\nJail housed persons accused of serious crimes โ something that would have been obvious to the jury\nin any event.\n- Third, Dart was not prejudiced by the inability to introduce specific instances in which contraband\nwas found.  Dart was given the opportunity to articulate how this impacted the manner of the search\nas challenged by plaintiffs (as opposed to the fact of the search), and he could offer nothing.  And in\nany event, Dart was able to introduce a number of specific instances in which contraband was found,\nso even if the ruling was wrong, Dart was not unfairly prejudiced in a way that would require a new\ntrial.\n- Fourth, Dart did not object to testimony by certain plaintiffs about their feelings of humiliation, so\nhe has forfeited that point.  The Court also rejects Dartโs remaining evidentiary arguments for the\nreasons that formed the basis of the Courtโs rulings before and during the trial.\nFinally, the Court rejects Dartโs argument that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffsโ\nequal protection claim based on the differential treatment between male and female detainees in intake\nsearches.  His argument essentially consists of a request that the Court reweigh the evidence, see Def.โs Mot.\nfor Judg. 14-15, which is not the standard for determining a motion for judgment as a matter of law.  See\nFilipovich v. K&R Express Sys., Inc., 391 F.3d 859, 963 (7th Cir. 2004).  It is beyond question that the\nSheriff treated male and female detainees differently in searching them at intake during the relevant period,\nand there was more than sufficient evidence supporting a finding that the differences were not justified under\nthe standard that Dart agreed applies to equal protection claims.\n06C552 Mercado vs. Dart Page 5 of  5",

In support, Petitioners explain as follows.\nI. Summary Of The Petition\nAfter five years of hard work, Class Counsel obtained a $55 million settlement for their\nclients.  The litigation also brought about reforms in the strip search procedures at the nationโs\nlargest single-site jail facility, meaningful changes that will protect the constitutional rights of\nhundreds of thousands of citizens in the future.\nTo achieve that outstanding result, a total of 35 different Class attorneys collectively\ndedicated more than 15,000 hours of time.  All told, Class Counsel created 513 affidavits from\nclass members, took and defended 84 depositions, briefed 47 motions, reviewed over 5,000\npages of discovery documents, and answered almost 21,000 phone calls and letters from the class\nmembers seeking an update on the case or asking questions about the case.  We also litigated 32\nof the defendantsโ motions, filing 22 briefs; filed and responded to three pleadings in the\nappellate court; and represented the Class at four jury trials.\nPresently before the Court is Class Counselโs request for an award of fees and costs.  \nThe agreed Settlement Agreement authorizes compensation of one-third of the fund, as well as\nreimbursement of out of pocket expenses.  As set forth in this Petition, an award in that amount\nis appropriate for a number of reasons, summarized as follows.\nUnder the applicable case law, the Seventh Circuit directs this Court to determine what\npercentage the Class would have negotiated ex ante for a contingency.  Applying that standard,\nnumerous courts, in this District and elsewhere, have awarded a โmarket rateโ one-third\ncontingency in common funds of similar size for class actions with similar levels of risk.  See,\ne.g., Exhibit A, Mansfield et al. v. Airline Pilots Assoc., 06 cv 6869, slip op. at 8-9, (N.D. Ill.\nDec. 14, 2009) (Ashman, J.) (awarding 35% fee for similarly-sized $44 million dollar fund, and\nfinding that a 35% fee award is โconsistent with awards in similarly complex cases in this and\nother jurisdictions, and accurately reflects the market rate for Class Counselโs services\nconsistent with Seventh Circuit case law...โ) (emphasis added).\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 7 of 44 PageID #:13882\nA key variable in that determination is the extent of the risk.  At one end of the class\ncounsel compensation spectrum is the category of cases where the risks are low.  Law firms\nvigorously compete with one another to represent those classes because the issues of liability,\nand even damages, are clear.  The question in those cases is not so much โifโ the defendant is\ngoing to pay, or even โhow much,โ but mainly โwhen.โ\nThe instant case could not fall any farther from that end of the compensation spectrum. \nIndeed, the offending practices persisted out in the open for years without anyone undertaking to\nchallenge them.  That is at least in part because the prospects for success in mounting such a\nchallenge were so daunting.\nFirst, the largest Class included persons accused of felonies, i.e., people lawfully subject\nto being strip searched, as long as it was done properly.  Their claims required proof of a\nwidespread unconstitutional practice, a sharply-disputed and difficult-to-prove proposition.  \nFor the Class of misdemeanants, the case law was uncertain and unwelcoming, and only got\nworse as the case moved forward.  Even in the realm of strip search litigation, this case was a\nrisky outlier because it involved the nationโs largest single-site jail and class members who,\nunlike in the typical strip search class, had already been arraigned and failed to make bail. \nMoreover, incarcerated class members are among the least sympathetic of plaintiffs, and the\nDefendants were public safety governmental officials.  From a statistical standpoint, prisoner\ncivil rights cases settle infrequently, fail at trial 90% of the time, and rarely prevail on appeal.\nCompounding the risk, the County was not in any frame of mind to settle, at least not\nwithout first attempting to knock out the claims at class certification, summary judgment, a\nliability trial, damages trials, and on appeal.  A loss at any one of those stages would have meant\ndefeat for the Class, and a total loss of counselโs investments of time and resources.  Prevailing at\neach stage required thousands of hours of diligent and creative legal work of the highest caliber,\non par with what the cityโs leading law firms provide to their highest-paying clients.\nThe other major reason why no one previously brought this class action, and thus why\none-third would be an appropriate ex ante fee, is because so few firms are realistically situated to\n2\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 8 of 44 PageID #:13883\nmount this fight.  Complex civil rights cases comprise a very specialized federal practice area,\nrequiring mastery of sophisticated constitutional issues and trial practice skills just to have a\nchance.  Indeed, the lead named plaintiff, Kim Young, contacted ten different attorneys without\nsuccess before Class Counsel agreed to pursue the claims.\nThe absence of other alternatives was no coincidence.  Few, if any, other law firms have\nthe special combination of attributes required to make this case successful, including: (a)\nsubstantial class action experience and the resources to manage and administer a quarter-million\nClass members; (b) capability of successfully litigating complex constitutional issues; (c) top-tier\nfederal trial and appellate practices; (d) political willingness to take on Cook County; (e) capacity\nto devote the necessary 16,000 total hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenses\nwithout repayment for five years; and (f) willingness to accept the very real risk of losing it all.\nClass Counselโs combination of strengths in all of those critical attributes is quite unique. \nThe fact is, our firm and this case were a perfect match.  Given the relative absence of other\nsuper-qualified firms, coupled with the need for a super-qualified firm if there was to be any\nchance of winning, the Class undoubtedly would have been willing to pay a heavy premium to\nsecure the services of a firm such as ours in an ex ante face-to-face negotiation, much less a\nmarket-rate one-third contingency.\nThe Petition also discusses other reasons why a one-third contingency is appropriate here,\nincluding the Declaration of Professor Theodore Eisenberg, a well-respected authority on class\naction compensation.  Professor Eisenberg opines that a one-third contingency is appropriate and\nsimilar to many other awards he has surveyed in comparable cases, another useful data point for\nthe Courtโs consideration.\nProfessor Eisenbergโs analysis also demonstrates the absence of any โscaling effectโ\n(marginally diminishing fee percentages as fund sizes increase) for high-risk civil rights class\naction awards in the Seventh Circuit.  In other words, where the nature of the case is such that\nadditional work increases the fund size, courts recognize that the Class would want its counsel to\nbe incentivized to aim higher and not to quit the fight too soon, i.e., just because a settlement\n3\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 9 of 44 PageID #:13884\noffer reached the level where counselโs compensation percentage drops off.  In this case, for\nexample, Class Counsel rejected earlier $20 and then $40 million offers, believing them to be too\nlow to fairly compensate the Class.  By continuing the battle through trial and on appeal (and\nthereby continuing to incur risk as opposed to locking in a fee) Class counsel was able to greatly\nexpand the overall pie.  From an ex ante perspective, the Class would have been best served by\nfully incentivizing that sort of decision-making, especially where, as here, the damages are soft,\nsubjective, and totally unliquidated.\nFinally, this Petition concludes by discussing the optional โcross-checkโ of the lodestar\nmultiplier, as well as the possible applicability vel non of banded โstair stepโ compensation\nformulas.  In both cases, the one-third contingency passes muster as the appropriate market rate.\nII. Petitionersโ Success In This Litigation Has Achieved A Substantial Settlement Fund,\nAs Well As Important Policy Changes\nThe cash portion of the Settlement Fund consists of a $55 million common fund, as well\nas an assignment of additional claims against the insurers.  Tens of thousands of members of the\nClass will receive the entire cash portion, net of the Claims Administratorโs fees, the incentive\nbonuses for class members who participated at trial, and Class Counselโs fee and costs. \nAssuming the Court approves the incentive bonuses and the one-third contingency fee permitted\nunder the Settlement Agreement, the Class will receive more than 64.3% of the fund, or\n$35,250,000.00.\nThe Class membersโ response to the Settlement Agreement has been favorable.  Although\nthe claims administrator has not completed processing all of the claims, our efforts and diligence\nhave achieved an above-average claims rates of approximately 25%.  See Exhibit B (Affidavit of\nRobin Niemic, Claims Administrator) at ยถยถ 21-22.\n In addition to distributing over $35 million in cash to the Class members, this litigation\naccomplished significant programmatic changes at the Cook County Jail (the โJailโ).  Most\nfundamentally, the unconstitutional tactics have been discontinued, resulting in very real benefits\nfor untold numbers of future detainees.  As a result of this litigation and the case built by Class\n4\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 10 of 44 PageID #:13885\nCounsel during discovery, the Jail purchased modern scanning equipment, an improvement that\nsatisfies the Jailโs legitimate interests while eliminating the need to continue the abusive blanket\nstrip search policy.  Exhibit C (Godinez Dep. at 82:1-16).  The Jailโs administrators themselves\nacknowledge that these changes comprise a โwin winโ because they have actually improved the\nJailโs ability to detect contraband.  Id. at 89:18-90:4, 90:16-91:1, 117:16-19, 161:11-162:21. \nAnd even where there is reasonable cause for a strip search, the Jail no longer uses group strip\nsearches.  Rather, detainees must be searched individually with privacy.  Id. at 124:11-23.\nIII. The Settlement Agreementโs One-Third Contingency Fee Is Appropriate Under The\nCase Law And Should Be Approved\nWhile not dispositive, Class Counsel begins by noting that not one Class Member has\nfiled an objection to the one-third contingency fee authorized in the Settlement Agreement.  The\nCourt obviously has an independent duty to examine the fairness of the fee, but the absence of\nany objections to the fee is a useful starting point, one that distinguishes this settlement from\nmany that do generate fee objections.  E.g., In re Diet Drugs, 582 F.3d 524, 542 (3d Cir. 2009)\n(15 objections to fees); Mansfield et al. v. Airline Pilots Assoc., No. 06 cv 6869 (N.D. Ill. Dec.\n14, 2009) (hereinafter โAirline Pilots Assoc.โ) (17 objections to fees), attached as Exhibit A.  See\nalso Isby v. Bayh, 75 F.3d 1191 (7th Cir. 1996) (13% of jail conditions class members filed\nobjections to settlement).\nLack of objections aside, the law and facts support the full agreed fee for the following\nreasons.\nA. Under The Case Law, The Full Agreed Fee Is Appropriate And Should Be\nAwarded If It Is Consistent With A Percentage That Would Have Been\nNegotiated Ex Ante\nBy investing approximately 15,000 hours of high-quality legal work over the course of\nfive years, a total of 35 lawyers for the Class succeeded in creating a common fund benefitting its\nmembers.  Accordingly, we seek an award of fees under the common fund doctrine, a doctrine\nโbased on the equitable notion that those who have benefitted from litigation should share its\ncosts.โ  Skelton v. General Motors Corp., 860 F.2d 250, 253 (7th Cir. 1988) (citations omitted).\n5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 11 of 44 PageID #:13886\nWhen awarding fees from a common fund, โ[t]he object . . . is to give the lawyer what he\nwould have gotten in the way of a fee in an armโs length negotiation, had one been feasible.โ  In\nre Continental Ill. Sec. Litig., 962 F.2d 566, 572 (7th Cir. 1992).  Because the Class was unable\nto pay fees or costs, the relevant fee is the percentage of the recovery that counsel would have\nnegotiated before undertaking the case, given the need to invest labor and risk hundreds of\nthousands of dollars in out of pocket costs, all with the specter of losing it all.  Sutton v. Bernard,\n504 F.3d 688, 693 (7th Cir. 2007) (ex ante contingency negotiation must account for risk of\nnonpayment, the quality and quantity of the work needed to litigate the case, and the likely\nstakes), citing Synthroid Mktg. Litig., 264 F.3d 712, 721 (7th Cir. 2001) (โSynthroid Iโ). \nB. The Circumstances Surrounding This Litigation Support A Conclusion That\nCounsel and the Class Would Have Negotiated A One-Third Contingency Fee\nThere are numerous reasons why a one-third contingency would have been the\nappropriate negotiated fee in this case.  These factors include the relevant market rate, the\nrelative dearth of other law firms in a position to have tackled this litigation, the skill and\nreputation of Class Counsel, the difficulties in bringing this litigation to a successful conclusion,\nand the substantial risk of nonpayment.  Class Counsel begins with the market rate.\n1. Contingencies In The Amount Of One-Third Of The Common Fund\nAre Consistent With The Market Rate\nA standard contingency arrangement for simple tort litigation runs between one-third and\nforty percent.  Gaskill v. Gordon, 160 F.3d 361, 362 (7th Cir. 1998).  Civil rights cases tend to be\nat the higher end of that range; attached as Exhibit D is an affidavit, signed by several local civil\nrights practitioners, attesting to 40% contingencies as the local market rate, reflecting the risks of\nloss in civil rights litigation.  Cf. Kirchoff v. Flynn, 786 F.2d 320, 323-24 (7th Cir. 1986) (stating\nthat a 40% contingency fee is typical in many practice areas, but that the unlevel playing field\nconfronting civil rights plaintiffs may make a market rate of greater than 40% reasonable).1\n     1  A 40% contingency fee is not an uncommon arrangement for risky cases in other practice\nareas as well.  See, e.g., In re Solis, 610 F.3d 969 (7th Cir. 2010) (40% contingency for fee\ncollections contract); Kenseth v.

The Absence Of Other Law Firms In A Position To Pursue This\nLitigation\nIn securities and consumer class actions, it is not uncommon for multiple firms to jostle\nwith one another to be class counsel.  The same is true for certain MDL litigation.  Such cases\noften present desirable economic propositions, i.e., a high likelihood of success coupled with big\nstakes.  In those situations, firms literally compete for the cherry cases, and courts can establish\nthe market rate via a bidding process.\nFor example, in In re Synthroid Marketing Litigation, 325 F.3d 974 (7th Cir. 2003)\n(โSynthroid IIโ), the court imposed a fee that would equate to 23% of a $55 million common\nfund.  Id. at 975-76.  Unlike the case at bar, Synthroid was an MDL consumer class action for\nwhich the economics were so attractive relative to the risk that numerous law firms around the\ncountry jumped in to compete to represent the class.  Synthroid I, 264 F.3d at 714.  Moreover, the\npredicate facts necessary for liability had already been established by a โwhistleblowerโ account\n     2  Some trial courts in this Circuit have reduced the percentage below one-third in so-called\nโmega fundโ cases where the stakes reach into the hundreds of millions.  See, e.g., Berger v.\nXerox Corp. Ret. Income Guarantee Plan, No. 00-584, 2004 WL 287902, at *2 (S.D. Ill. Jan. 22,\n2004) (fee award of 29% of $239 million common fund), and Berger, No. 00-584 (S.D. Ill. Filed\nJan. 20, 2004) (Memorandum in Support of Final Approval), attached as Group Exhibit F.\n8\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 14 of 44 PageID #:13889\npublished in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Id. at 713-14 (โAfter the articleโs\npublication, lawyers across the country began filing class action suits.โ).  Thus, liability was\nnever in doubt, and damages were certain to be sizable from the outset.  Moreover, the defense \nsettlement offer came so early in the litigation that the court concluded that sufficient discovery\nhad not yet been conducted to determine whether the defendantsโ offer was too low.  Id. at 714-\n15; see also In re Trans Union Corp. Privacy Litig., 629 F.3d 741, 2011 WL 117108, at *5 (7th\nCir. 2011) (cases filed after the FTC had already found that Trans Union violated federal law).3\n Not so here.  There was no bidding war for the privilege of representing this prisoner\nclass.  Quite the opposite, named Plaintiff Kim Young searched out, but was rejected by, ten\ndifferent law firms before she found Loevy & Loevy (โL&Lโ).  Exhibit G (Young Aff. at ยถ 3).\nFrom its vantage point, this Court is aware of how few civil rights firms in this District\nwere truly in a position to devote so many thousands of attorney hours and several hundred\nthousand dollars in cash/credit (in an era when credit is tight), all in the hopes of being paid five\nor more years down the road โ assuming there was any payment at all.  The Class also required a\nfirm capable of skillfully handling the staffing and administrative burden associated with almost\n250,000 class members, including the ability to respond to thousands of letters and phone calls.\nTo be sure, such firms exist, but precious few concentrate in civil rights, a highly-\nspecialized field.  Summary judgment and then Seventh Circuit review loomed as serious barriers\nto recovery, and, with the County unwilling to settle prior to testing these waters, the experience\nand ability needed to address complex constitutional arguments was critical.4\n     3  The court also relied on an actual retainer that one of the attorneys had signed with an\ninsurance third party payer to represent it in the case for 22% after liability had essentially\nbecome clear.  In Re Synthroid Mktg. Litig. (โSynthroid IIโ), 325 F.3d at 976, 978 (explaining\nthat the 22% rate was agreed to โafter a good deal of the risk had been dissipatedโ and that the\ninsurers still โhad to offer 22% to sign up lawyers on a contingent feeโ).\n     4  Class Counsel, for example, had to craft legal positions against a legal backdrop that began\nshifting unfavorably as our case progressed, when various appellate courts began dismissing class\nactions for detainees strip searched upon entry to general population.  See Florence v. Bd. of\nChosen Freeholders, 621 F.3d 296 (3d Cir. 2010) (dismissing claim of putative class strip\nsearched on entry to general population); Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964\n(9th Cir. 2010) (dismissing claim for class entering general population); Powell v. Barrett, 541\nF.3d 1298 (11th Cir.2008) (dismissing claim for class entering general population and remanding\nclaims of those strip searched before the need to enter general population was determined).\n9\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 15 of 44 PageID #:13890\nThe reality is, if Class Counsel had not taken the case, it likely never would have been\nbrought at all, much less won.  After all, the disputed practices had been ongoing out in the open\nfor years, affecting hundreds of thousands of men, all without any prior challenge by any other\nlaw firms.  This factor weighs strongly in favor of the conclusion that ex ante negotiation would\nhave supported a contingency of at least one-third, if not more.\n3. Class Counselโs Capability To Perform The Superior Level Of Legal\nWork Necessary To Obtain The Tremendous Result\nAll of the foregoing speaks to the relative absence of other firms in any realistic position\nto prosecute this case properly.  But even assuming arguendo there had been an availability of\nother firms competing to represent the Class, law firms are not fungible.  Petitioners respectfully\nsubmit that the Class enjoyed the advantage of having been represented by one of the premier\ncivil rights law firms in the Midwest, a factor which warrants compensation at the highest end of\nthe spectrum.  See Synthroid I, 264 F.3d at 720 (โQuality varies among lawyers, and awards net\nof fees could rise with the level of fees if a higher payment attracts the best counsel.  We never\nsee private clients auctioning off their legal work to the lowest bidder.โ) (emphasis added).\nAs the Court has had the opportunity to observe during its tenure on the bench, L&L has\ngrown to 21 lawyers, many with the type of stellar resumes which would qualify them to work\nfor the nationโs largest and most prestigious law firms on behalf of the highest-paying clients. \nSee Group Exhibit H (affidavits stating qualifications).  Instead, our firmโs lawyers have devoted\ntheir careers to challenging civil rights cases, such as this one.  As a result, the Class benefitted\nfrom a level of service that can only be characterized as top of the line.  Cf. Garcia v. Chicago,\nNo. 01 C 8945, 2003 WL 22175620, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 19, 2003) (Holderman, J.) (โIn the case\nat hand, were it not for the skill and determination of [Loevy & Loevy], the violations of Garciaโs\ncivil rights by the City proven by the evidence at trial would not have been established.โ).\nIn further support of Class Counselโs skills, reputation, and accomplishments, we offer\naffidavits submitted by the distinguished figures in the Chicago civil rights community,\nincluding, inter alia, Locke Bowman of the MacArthur Justice Center; Harvey Grossman of the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union; Craig Futterman of the Civil Rights Police Accountability\n10\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 16 of 44 PageID #:13891\nProject at the University of Chicago; Flint Taylor of the Peopleโs Law Office; Andrea Lyon of\nDePaul Law School; and Judson Miner of the Miner Barnhill firm.  See Group Exhibit I.  See\nalso id., Affidavit of Robert S. Grabemann (L&L opposing counsel in recent civil rights trial). \nWe are quite proud of their opinions, all of which place L&L in the highest tier of civil rights\nfirms, and therefore worthy of the highest compensation.  See id.5\nApplying the Seventh Circuit standard of an ex ante negotiation, the Class would have\nbeen hard pressed to find many firms as well qualified to provide the level of service necessary to\nwin, much less achieve the outstanding result obtained here.  Because the supply is limited, the\nmarket power to negotiate something less than a one-third (or even greater) contingency is simply\nnot there.\nThere is an additional factor distinguishing Class Counsel from the rest of the prospective\npack.  Actual trial practice is extremely rare in the class action world.  While there are\nundoubtedly other class action firms with excellent trial attorneys, there are likely few that take\non cases with an eye towards trying them rather than settling pretrial.  There are fewer still that\nhave the level of federal civil trial experience (and record of success) that L&L has to offer.  This\nattribute was critical here given the need to obtain the โpolicy and practiceโjury verdict and the\nhigh verdicts at the damage trials, without which the settlement, if it happened at all, would not\nhave been anywhere near $55 million.\nEven within the subset of class action firms with the capability of trying cases, the market\nthins further because, whatever the number of remaining firms, it is fair to say that virtually none\nhave substantial experience in civil rights litigation, to say nothing of the level of expertise in this\narea comparable to L&L.  Given L&Lโs history of litigating and trying Monell policy and\npractice claims with uncommon frequency, see Exhibit J, Kanovitz Decl. ยถ 50, our firm was\nuniquely suited to build a case for trial.  Granted, many of these other cases have been, for the\n     5  In addition to confirming our firmโs track record for aggressively and successfully litigating\non behalf of our clients, these affidavits also corroborate our law firmโs decision to devote\nthousands and thousands of hours to important civil rights endeavors that are either purely pro\nbono, or else far more about civil rights principles than they are about economic remuneration.\n11\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 17 of 44 PageID #:13892\nmost part, โsmallerโ individual cases, but we have litigated each with the same thoroughness and\nvigor with which โbig firmsโ treat the commercial interests of their highest-paying clients.6\nSummarizing, L&Lโs unique set of skills, built over more than a decade of trying civil\nrights cases, proved immensely valuable to the Class.  The fact is, some law firms are more\nexpensive than others.  Some corporate law firms have earned the right to charge clients\nsignificantly higher rates, and some patent law firms command higher contingencies.  Civil rights\nfirms are no different, particularly where, as here, the Class required the services of a premium\nfirm, without which it would have been less successful or not successful at all.  See discussion,\ninfra, at 36 fn. 21 (describing far smaller settlements in comparable class actions brought by\nother local attorneys).  Class Counselโs services provided very good value to the Class at the one-\nthird contingency, and Counsel should capture the full benefit of that service.  See Synthroid I,\n274 F.3d at 720 (awards โcould rise with the level of fees if a higher payment attracts the best\ncounselโ).7\n     6  Finally, the settlement negotiation itself required experience and skill, including\nsophisticated and creative analysis of insurance issues.  To ensure the Class had every advantage,\nClass Counsel hired insurance counsel from the Howrey law firm to advise and assist.  On their\nown dime, Class Counsel paid these insurance lawyers almost $50,000 at an hourly rate of\n$605/hour (for an attorney with the same year of law school graduation as lead counsel, Mike\nKanovitz).  See Exhibit K (Howrey invoices).\n     7  Assuming hypothetically that the Class could have sought out less qualified attorneys who\nmight have accepted a 30% or even a 25% fee, the Class was nonetheless better served by paying\nL&L a full third because the resulting overall expansion of the pie to $55 million completely\ndwarfs any potential savings for the Class associated with a reduced rate.  This was simply not\nthe type of class action where the pot was fairly fixed and the most rational choice would be to\nselect the cheapest among competing, equally-qualified firms.  See fn. 20, infra, discussing far\nsmaller Bullock and Jackson settlements.\n12\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 18 of 44 PageID #:13893\n4. The Ex Ante Risk Of Nonpayment Was Sufficiently Substantial As To\nJustify The One-Third Contingency\nAs our Court of Appeals has made clear, โ[t]he greater the risk of loss, the greater the\nincentive compensation required.โ  Synthroid I, 264 F.3d at 719.8  The Seventh Circuit has, \nquite properly, singled out civil rights litigation as being amongst the most risky propositions for\ncontingency fee representation.  Kirchoff, 786 F.2d at 323 (while โ40% is the customary fee in\ntort litigation,โ that is the fee for the normal tort litigation and โthe risks plaintiffs face in ยง1983\nlitigation are greaterโ than the norm).  Unlike regular tort litigation, Section 1983 cases face legal\nand practical barriers resulting in more unsuccessful plaintiffs, as the Seventh Circuit\nsummarized:\nA ยง1983 case is not like FELA litigation, in which all but a few defenses have\nbeen stripped away.  It is not even like ordinary tort litigation. . . .  [T]he plaintiff\nmust show more in a ยง1983 case than in a case under the common law of torts. \nNegligence is not itself actionable.  The plaintiff must show intentional\nwrongdoing or at least recklessness in most ยง1983 suits, and every โconstitutional\ntortโ will have one or more elements an ordinary negligence suit.  The plaintiff\nalso must overcome any immunity from suit the defendants may possess.  A\nplaintiff suing the police may encounter juries sympathetic to the defendants --\nmore sympathetic, anyway, than juries are apt to be when the defendant is a\ndeep-pocket corporation in a products liability or FELA suit.  When the plaintiff\nwins on the merits, the jury may treat the defendant as having shallow pockets. . . .\nLitigants under ยง1983 therefore have a harder time on the merits, and recover less\nwhen they win, than plaintiffs in much other tort litigation.\nId. at 323-24.\nEmpirical evidence bears out these observations.  As is discussed in the attached\nDeclaration of Professor Theodore Eisenberg, civil rights cases succeed at far lower rates than\nother types of plaintiffโs litigation.  See Exhibit L (Eisenberg Aff. ยถยถ 49-52).  Professor Eisenberg\nanalyzed the data from federal court case outcomes made publicly available by the\nAdministrative Office (โAOโ) of the United States Courts covering fiscal years 1970 through\n     8  The converse is also true, and courts have ordered fees of less than one-third in lower risk\ncases.  But, to be clear, they did so because the recovery was more certain at the outset, and thus\nthe market would have dictated less of a contingency fee to compensate for the lower risk of loss. \nThe relative lack of risk associated with certain brands of class actions is the main driver of fee\nawards lower than one-third.\n13\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 19 of 44 PageID #:13894\n2008, which include the outcomes of literally millions of federal cases and over 100,000 trials. \nId. ยถยถ 45-48.9  \nNot surprisingly, government actors enjoy a significant advantage in litigation, a\nphenomenon confirmed by empirical research showing a success rate 2.5 times higher than that\nof businesses.  Id. ยถ 55.  As Professor Eisenbergโs charts illustrate, see id. ยถ 49 (Fig. 1), the trial\nsuccess rates of incarcerated plaintiffs in civil rights cases hover around 10%, and never exceed\n20%.  Id. ยถ 49.  This contrasts sharply with noncivil rights cases (better than 50%) and even with\nnonprisoner civil rights cases, in which plaintiffs succeed at trial around 30% of the time.\nMoreover, these low trial success rates are not a function of high rates of pretrial success. \nCivil rights cases are also far less likely than the norm to settle pretrial, and cases involving\nprisoners settle at the lowest rates of all.  Id. ยถ 51 (โThe combination of the lowest settlement\nrates of any major case category and the lowest trial win rates of any case category documents the\nextreme trial court level risk to counsel of bringing cases like this.โ).\nRisks associated with civil rights cases persist on appeal, with a reversal rate for plaintiff\nvictories at about 50%, compared to about 14% when Defendants win.  Id. ยถ 53 (โIn short,\ncounsel in civil rights cases, who survive high pretrial dismissal rates, as evidenced by low\nsettlement rates shown in Figure 2, who survive low trial success rates, as shown in Figure 1, still\nmust run the gauntlet of appellate reversal rates that show the highest gap between plaintiff and\ndefendant appellate success of any case categories.โ).  Professor Eisenberg characterizes this as\nโtranscendent, systemic risk,โ exceeding any other category of litigation.  Id. ยถ 54.\nEmpirical statistics aside, the notion that Cook County would have been willing, or even\npolitically able, to pay $55 million to a class of Jail detainees was not an outcome that anyone\nwould have called โlikelyโ from an ex ante perspective.  To obtain that result, Class Counsel had\n     9  Helpfully, there is a statistical category labeled โPrisoner civil rights, prison\nconditions.โ  According to Professor Eisenberg, the AO started using another code in 1998 to\nseparate prison condition cases from other prisoner civil rights cases.  AO Code 440, which is\ndescribed as โOther civil rightsโ cases, is a reasonable proxy for ยง1983 cases.  Id. ยถ 47, citing\nSchwab, S., Eisenberg, T., Explaining Constitutional Tort Litigation: The Influence of the\nAttorney Fees Statute and the Government as Defendant, 73 Cornell L. Rev. at 725 (table I).\n14\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 20 of 44 PageID #:13895\nto confront potentially dispositive pitfalls in terms of class certification, summary judgment, trial,\nand appeal.  Each of those wins was vital to the Classโs ability to obtain its sizeable settlement,\nand failure at any of these stages would have doomed or substantially reduced the recovery. \nThus, in contrast to class actions where law firms compete to represent the class, the risk here\nwas substantial, and, as demonstrated by cases such as Gaskill, Airline Pilots Assoc., In re\nHousehold Intโl, and Will, the market for riskier cases dictates substantially higher contingency\nfees, either at or just slightly above/below one-third.10\nIn closing on this point, Petitioners wish to emphasize that when one speaks of โriskโ in\nthis context, the potential economic consequences are not merely abstract, particularly for a small\nor even mid-sized firm.  Huge amounts of attorney time and out-of-pocket capital must be spent\nup front on behalf of the clients.  All of this money and billable time can vaporize in an instant. \nOver the past decade, Class Counselsโ firm has invested millions of dollars in civil rights cases\nfor attorney time and expenses that have gone uncompensated because they failed to prevail.11\nTo be clear, Class Counsel is not complaining.  That is the nature of the game.  These\ntypes of cases are very difficult to win.  Counsel understand that risk going in, and knowingly\nassume it.  But on the other side of the equation, when the plaintiffs do prevail for their clients โ\nand, as here, where they prevail big โ then full compensation commensurate with the scope of the\naccomplishment is appropriate.  This is particular so given the economics of the practice, and the\nfirmโs expense in compensating more than twenty highly-qualified attorneys, to say nothing of\nthe multi-million dollar annual overhead associated with running a firm of that size.\n     10  This case was actually riskier than other strip search class actions in the 30% common fund\nrange, which were more attractive because they involved detainees that had not yet been\narraigned or who had been ordered released.  Boone v. City of Philadelphia, 668 F.Supp. 2d 693\n(E.D. Pa. 2009); Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, No. 03 cv 3086 (N.D. Ill. entered Nov. 27,\n2006) (attached as Exhibit M); Gallagher  v.

And, unlike almost any other class action\nin any category, this one had to proceed through trial and appeal.\n     11  As attorney Jon Loevyโs affidavit attests (Group Exhibit H) it is not an uncommon\noccurrence for the firm to lose a substantial investment in a case when the plaintiff fails to\nprevail for one reason or another.

Id.\nยถยถ 9-10.  The Supreme Court, too, has cited and relied on empirical studies he authored or co-\nauthored on various topics, including the eight Supreme Court opinions listed in his affidavit. \nHis empirical studies have been the subject of stories in major media, including the New York\nTimes, the Wall Street Journal, the Atlantic Monthly, among others.  He has also testified about\nlaw-related empirical matters before federal and state legislatures.\nProfessor Eisenberg recently presented his empirical analysis of attorney fees to federal\nMDL judges at the 42nd Transferee Judgesโ Conference, held in West Palm Beach, Florida, in\nOctober of 2009.  He is the founder and editor of the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies, which\nis the official journal of the Society for Empirical Legal Studies.  He also served on the editorial\nboard of the American Law and Economics Review, and as an academic adviser to the National\nCenter for State Courts.  Professor Eisenberg has substantial experience in the study of civil\nrights and discrimination litigation.  He is the author of Civil Rights Legislation (Lexis Nexis 5th\ned. 2004), a casebook that includes hundreds of pages on Section 1983 civil rights litigation.\nAs set forth at length in his Declaration, Professor Eisenberg opines that a one-third\ncontingency is appropriate here for numerous reasons.  First, a one-third contingency is\nconsistent with the market rate for similar awards in civil rights cases and class actions in the\nsame risk category.  Id. ยถยถ 41-56.  Moreover, as Professor Eisenberg, the fact that the Young\nPlaintiffs had been arraigned further increases the risk premium, as did the fact that most Class\nplaintiffs were not challenging the right of the jail to strip search them, but only the manner in\nwhich it was done.  Id. ยถ 59-60, 84.  There is also the matter of the jury trials (which occur in less\nthan 1% of the cases Professor Eisenberg studied, id. ยถ 82) and the interlocutory appeal, which in\nProfessor Eisenbergโs opinion are sufficiently unusual and risky to warrant the highest end of the\ncomparable awards.  Id.  This was also the highest strip search settlement that Professor\nEisenberg has been able to locate, a result he describes as โhistorically high.โ  Id. ยถ 85.\nIn sum, Professor Eisenbergโs opinion provides additional support for the one-third\ncontingency sought here.\n17\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 23 of 44 PageID #:13898\n2. The Record-Breaking Result\nAs the Supreme Court has made clear, โthe most critical factorโ in determining\nreasonableness of the fee award โis the degree of success obtained.โ  Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S.\n103, 114 (1992).  By any measure, the outstanding degree of success obtained here is beyond\ndebate.  This is no โcouponโ settlement.  Class Counsel broke the cash record for strip search\nsettlements.  The amount may well merit inclusion on the list of the highest (collectible) civil\nrights awards ever.  A huge number of Class members โ in the tens of thousands โ will see\nmeaningful checks to compensate them for the injury they suffered.\nClass Counsel should not be โpenalizedโ with a lower percentage merely because we\nachieved such outstanding results for the clients.  In that regard, Professor Eisenberg searched for\nthe existence of a possible โscaling effectโ in Seventh Circuit common fund cases, i.e., he\nreviewed the awards to determine if percentages declined with the size of the recovery.  Using\nregression analysis, he determined that there is almost no scaling effect present in the Seventh\nCircuit for the category of high risk cases.  Id. ยถ 88.  That result indicates that courts treat higher-\nrisk cases differently, recognizing that the market, which may sometimes gravitate toward an \nex ante โbandedโ-based negotiation in some types of commercial cases with fixed damages, \nis not universally applicable.  Rather, as the Seventh Circuit noted, such arrangements make\neconomic sense mainly when the recovery will not โincrease in proportion to the number of\nhours devoted to the case.โ  Synthroid I, 264 F.3d at 721.  This basic lack of scaling also can be\nseen in the fee awards in other strip search class actions, regardless of the size of the fund.  See\nExhibit L, Eisenberg Aff. ยถ 66.13\n     13  These other class actions were also arguably less risky than this one.  Most involved\nblanket strip searches of pre-arraignment detainees not entering general population, or detainees\nwhom the court had already ordered freed, and so those cases did not present the extra proof\nissues and risk of appellate reversal that this case did.  Moreover, none of them appears to have\nproceeded past summary judgment.  See Cazenave v. Foti, No. 00 cv 1246 (E.D. La. July 17,\n2008) (awarding 35% in case that settled after summary judgment motions were filed for\npre-arraignment detainees) (Order and Reasons attached as Exhibit P); Gallagher, No. 04-0448\n(N.D. Cal. Oct. 29, 2004) (awarding 31.6% in case involving female pre-arraignment detainees\nsettled after class certification) (Order of Judgment and Dismissal and Application for Attorneysโ\nFees and Costs, attached as Group Exhibit N); Bynum v. District of Columbia, 412 F. Supp. 2d\n73, 81 (D.D.C. 2006) (awarding 33.3% of pre-trial settlement where class involved over-\n18\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 24 of 44 PageID #:13899\nAs discussed, the history of this litigation demonstrates how the amount of the recovery\nin high risk cases does go up with increased marginal work.  Class Counsel almost tripled the\nClassesโ recovery by pushing the case towards trial, and beyond. \n3. The Policy Reforms Will Provide Additional Non-Pecuniary Benefit\nTo Hundreds Of Thousands Of Citizens\nAs substantial as the financial component of this fund may be, the benefits obtained by\nClass Counsel cannot be measured in dollars alone.  This litigation, including the Courtโs ruling\non summary judgment, also brought about meaningful and needed reforms at the countryโs\nlargest single-site Jail.  The Jail now uses scanning technology instead of blanket strip searches. \nSee Exhibit C, Godinez Dep. at 162:22-163:3.  A detainee may be strip-searched only if there is\nparticularized reasonable suspicion that he or she is harboring contraband.  Id. at 104:4-105:9,\n111:20-21, 142:20-143:3, 146:9-16.\nAs a result of these changes, hundreds of thousands of people will be spared abusive and\noften barbaric strip procedures that were inflicted on the class members โ a policy and practice\nwhich has been discontinued in favor of a far more humane solution, all without sacrificing\nanything in terms of the Jailโs ability to detect contraband, which has actually been improved.  Id.\nat 89:18-90:4, 90:16-91:1, 117:16-19, 161:11-162:21.\nUnder the law, this nonmonetary benefit further supports Counselโs fee petition.  See\nRobinson v. City of Harvey, 489 F.3d 864, 872 (7th Cir. 2007) (affirming fee award in part on\nnonmonetary benefit of successful Monell claim, described as a โvictory that serves the public\ninterest by exposing to light disturbing police malfeasance and grave municipal institutional\ndetention and strip searches of persons after a court had ordered them to be released); Calvin, 03\ncv 3086 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 27, 2006) (awarding one-third to 40 % where claims involved pre-\narraignment arrestees and persons whom the court had already ordered to be released; case\nsettled after summary judgment) (Order Granting Final Approval of Class Action Settlement\nattached as Exhibit M); Boone, 668 F. Supp. 2d 693 (awarding 30% in a case that settled before\nclass certification was decided; class definition, which includes people arrested on bench\nwarrants, appears to contemplate persons who had not been arraigned notwithstanding that the\nopinion uses the both โpretrial detaineesโ and โarresteesโ to describe the class); Connor, No.\n00-10835-RBC (D. Mass. Mar. 11, 2004) (awarding 31% in case that involved claims by female\npre-arraignment detainees as well as those held on default bonds and in protective custody that\nwas settled after class certification) (Final Approval Order and Complaint attached as Exhibit O).\n19\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 25 of 44 PageID #:13900\nfailures, and one that will presumably help to deter future constitutional violations by the Cityโs\nofficersโ).  See also Chicago Acorn v. City of Chicago, No. 97 cv 6391, 1999 WL 1256260, at *9\n(N.D. Ill. Dec. 21, 1999) (plaintiffsโ counselโs achievement in obtaining content-neutral policy\nfor admission to city council meetings served an important public purpose, and thus supported\nfee request); Bynum, 412 F. Supp. 2d at 85 (โThe policy achievements obtained through this\nlitigation set it apart from many class fund cases, which provide only monetary relief.โ).\nIn some class actions, courts place a valuation on the programmatic reforms as part of the\ntotal consideration to the class.  We have not requested that sort of accounting here, urging\ninstead that the Court consider the nonmonetary benefit as further support for the reasonableness\nof the one-third contingency authorized in the Settlement Agreement.14\n4. The Difficulties And Challenges Class Counsel Had To Overcome To\nObtain The Successful Result\nIn considering the request for compensation, Class Counsel urges the Court to keep in\nmind just how many obstacles stood in the way of victory for the Class.  Putting aside the benefit\nof hindsight, a list of some of the legal and factual issues we had to prepare to confront is\nattached as Exhibit Q.  Other challenges are discussed in the Declaration of lead counsel Michael\nKanovitz (โKanovitz Decl.โ) (Exhibit J at ยถ 41), and we review some of them as follows.\nStrategic Obstacles\nUnlike most other strip search defendants, the Jail did not accept detainees until after they\nhad been arraigned by a judge and ordered into the custody of the Sheriff.  The distinction\nmatters, because after arraignment, it is necessary for the detainee to be housed pending trial and,\nthus, to be admitted into the inner confines of the facility (where different safety challenges are\npresented), as opposed to awaiting arraignment in holding cells.  Compare Mary Beth G. v. City\nof Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983) (prohibiting blanket strip searches of\nunarraigned women in a municipal lock-up who were about to make bond).\n     14  Even though these new procedures were implemented in response to this litigation, as the\nCourt may recall, the Sheriff refused to memorialize the reforms into the Settlement Agreement. \nClass Counsel was unwilling to allow impasse on this point to derail the settlement, as the juryโs\nverdicts at the liability and damages trials should be sufficient to ensure future compliance.\n20\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 26 of 44 PageID #:13901\nMoreover, even under the most favorable expression of the case law for those charged\nwith misdemeanors, blanket strip searches are still permissible so long as the facility\ndemonstrates a history of contraband smuggling by class members.  Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at\n1272-73.  Here, as Defendants were always quick to point out, the Jail was notorious for\nproblems with dangerous weapons and contraband.15\nAs for the Classโ argument about strip search methodology, this was by no means a\nguaranteed winner.  The case of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979) had assumed, without\ndeciding, that the Fourth Amendment would apply and, thus, require the methodology to be\nreasonable.  But what was โreasonableโ under a wide array of circumstances remained open to\ninterpretation.  Class counsel found the Jailโs practices objectionable, but the Jail definitely had a\nstory to tell in terms of being the nationโs largest jail with hundreds of detainees to process in just\na few hours each day.  See Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987) (courts should not second-\nguess jail administrators for failing to choose the least burdensome method for a strip search).\nMoreover, Class Iโs claim concerning the strip search methodology turned, in part, on\nabuses that were relatively ad hoc: terrorizing detainees, using violence and profanity, bodily\nfluids spilling during the search.  Those sorts of conditions were likely unconstitutional, but\nestablishing that they were universal, so as to justify class treatment, was difficult and risky. \nPlaintiffs argued, and the Court agreed that any differences in the practices were not likely to\npredominate, Young v. County of Cook, No. 06 cv 0552, 2007 WL 1238920, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Apr.\n25, 2007), but that was no foregone conclusion.16  \n     15  E.g., Rudolph Bush, Inmate Slain in Knife Fight at Cook County Jail, 3 Other Prisoners\nSent to Hospitals, Chicago Trib., Mar. 24, 2002, at 3 (reporting inmate fight with shanks); Jeff\nCohen, 7 Inmates Injured During Brawl, Jail Fight Leaves 3 Hospitalized in Serious Condition,\nChi. Trib., Oct. 28, 2003, at 3 (same); Patrick Rucker and Jo Napolitano, 21 Hurt in Gang Fight\nat Cook County Jail, 6 Inmates Sent to Area Hospitals, Chicago Trib., Oct. 17, 2004, at 1 (same).\n     16  The ruling was also interlocutory, and subject to being revisited as the record unfolded. \nAccordingly, building the case in discovery and trying it before a jury required special care so as\nnot to permit the Fourteenth Amendment claims to devolve into disparate and varying\nexperiences.  The risk of unwinding the Courtโs certification decision on this claim, and thus of\nlosing some of the most powerful evidence of the unreasonable practices, was omnipresent.\n21\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 27 of 44 PageID #:13902\nEarly Proceedings\nFollowing the Courtโs denial of Defendantsโ motions to dismiss, Dckt. Nos. 37, 39, 56,\nClass Counsel geared up to take discovery required for class certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \nThis involved document discovery, as well as depositions of policymakers, various jail guards\nand supervisors, and the named Plaintiffs themselves.  See Exhibit J, Kanovitz Decl. at ยถ 39.\nClass Counsel proceeded to gather class membersโ accounts of cruelty by the guards. \nThis was a fact-intensive endeavor, and there was no guarantee going into discovery that Class\nCounsel was going to gather enough evidence to convince a jury to disbelieve the contrary\naccounts of jail guards, high-ranking administrators, and even jail physicians.\nFormal discovery was comprehensive, to say the least.  We served 23 separate sets of\nrequests for written discovery, took or defended 84 depositions, and reviewed more than 5,000\npages of documents produced in discovery.  This included, for example, intensive scrutiny of\nthousands of pages of โcontraband reportsโ produced and relied upon by the Jail, and researching\ncourt records of the persons identified to determine the nature of their charges and whether they\nbelonged to Class II.  We had to fight for much of the discovery we needed, filing and litigating\nseven discovery motions and responding to multiple others seeking to prevent discovery.\nThe difficulty of obtaining class certification was compounded in all sorts of ways.  For\nexample, Defendants claimed repeatedly, and incorrectly, that the Jailโs database was so\nantiquated that they could not produce to us a list of persons admitted during the class period. \nSee Young v. County of Cook, 2007 WL 1238920, *3 (N.D.Ill. April 25, 2007) (โPlaintiffs\nsought database discovery from the [Sheriffโs Department] to determine the size of this proposed\nclass. The Department claimed that it could not extract the information from its computers . . .โ);\nExhibit J, Kanovitz Decl. ยถ 39.  This prevented Plaintiffs from adducing witness evidence from\nthe class members with which to prove the commonality of the widespread abuses.  It also\nhampered Plaintiffsโ ability to establish numerosity for the misdemeanor class.  Defendants were\nclaiming that persons charged with non-drug/non-weapons misdemeanors rarely entered the Jail\ndue to the I-bond system, and Plaintiffs had no database with which to disprove it.  Accordingly,\n22\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 28 of 44 PageID #:13903\nClass Counsel had to monitor the publicly admissible records of admissions to the Jail for a\nperiod of time and then look up the criminal file of each new detainee to locate those who were\ncharged with Class II charges so as to prove that a misdemeanor class actually existed.17\nClass Certification\nFollowing Plaintiffsโ successful motion for certification, Defendants petitioned the\nSeventh Circuit for leave to appeal under Rule 23(f).  The relief sought by the Defendants would\nhave ended the case.  Class Counsel approached the appeal with the seriousness that it deserved,\nand devoted considerable resources to (successfully) protecting the Classโ interests.\nOnce the Classes were certified, Class Counsel direct-mailed notice (at our expense) to\nover 180,422 Class Members.  Unsurprisingly, many class members took a keen interest, calling\nand writing with questions. We received over 2,000 phone calls and almost 1,800 letters between\nthe time when we sent notice and when the case went to trial.  We were diligent about responding\nto each of these contacts, and we set up protocols so that class members with questions could\nspeak to an attorney, making sure that written questions appropriate for an attorney were\nanswered by an attorney.  Exhibit R, Declaration of Roshna Bala Keen (โKeen Decl.โ) at ยถยถ 4-7.\nNews of the case spread as a result of media coverage of the Courtโs summary judgment\ndecision and of the liability trial.  Between the liability trial and the time when we sent notice of\nthe proposed settlement, counsel received another 1,600 phone calls and another almost 7,000\nletters, most requesting an update on the case and asking for an explanation of what the case\ndevelopments meant.  Again, we responded to each and every communication, providing the\nclass members with access to an attorney whenever requested.  Exhibit R, Keen Decl. ยถ 8. \nAdditionally, since sending out the notice of settlement, we have responded to over 3,200 more\nphone calls and almost 1,800 letters, explaining the settlement.  Id. ยถ 9.  \n     17  During discovery, Defendants also inundated Plaintiffs with irrelevant but voluminous\ndocuments.  One example was an exhibit of 400 โcontraband reportsโ that were apropos of\nnothing at issue at the certification stage, but which still required laborious analysis and\ntabulation so that Plaintiffs could respond to Defendantsโ characterizations of what they showed. \nAnother was Defendantsโ reliance on documents and consent decrees in Duran and the Lewis v.\nOโGrady case which required Plaintiffs to study those records and dockets as well.\n23\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 29 of 44 PageID #:13904\nOn the investigation side, we undertook a massive project to gather over 500 declarations\nfrom randomly selected class members representing a cross section of the class period.  We\ninterviewed each declarant personally to produce the declaration.  The difficulty in the logistics\nof the process alone was considerable.  Also, given the state of the Jailโs charging data on the\nclass members, we conducted a random sample of 2,000 class members and looked up every\nsingle file on them.  We used this data to estimate the rate of Class II charges and also to analyze\nissues of length of stay for misdemeanor detainees with the assistance of database experts.  We\nalso surveyed procedures of other police departments and facilities and conducted a great deal of\ninternet research to marshal evidence for the case.\nSummary Judgment\nFrom the outset of the case, Class Counselโs assessment, based on experience, was that\nwe needed to prevail on summary judgment for Class II because those claims were not\nparticularly viable if tried to a jury.  Because the Jailโs history of contraband problems was\nlegally relevant to the juryโs consideration of the reasonableness of blanket strip searches, if we\nleft a jury question open then the Jail was going to be able to put on a host of incendiary evidence\nabout drugs and shanks and violence towards officers and the detainees themselves.  This would\nhave not only destroyed Class IIโs chances for success, it would also have created the appearance\nthat the Plaintiffsโ case was at odds with jail security, thereby creating an unacceptable spillover\nrisk for the Class I strip search methodology claims.18\nThus, merely surviving summary judgment so that we could present the case to a jury,\nwhich is the most that civil rights plaintiffs usually can hope for in discovery, was not enough. \nBecause there was an undeniable history of contraband entering the Jail, Class Counsel needed to\nso thoroughly undermine the foundation for any conclusion that the evidence was relevant to\nClass IIโs claims as to leave no jury question at all regarding the weight of the evidence.  This\n     18  Class Counselโs concerns were validated very quickly after we filed the case when the jury\nin the Thompson case came back with a defense verdict on roughly the same blanket strip search\nissue.  See Exhibit S, Thompson v. County of Cook, No. 03 cv 7172 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 7, 2006).\n24\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 30 of 44 PageID #:13905\nwas no easy task.  There were 2,000 pages of contraband reports, as well as anecdotal evidence\nfrom every Jail policymaker and employee who sat for a deposition.  Nevertheless, we were able\nto establish that there was no evidence to link these thousands of contraband incidents to\nsmuggling by members of the misdemeanor class.  We also marshaled evidence to establish that\nit was feasible for the Jail to treat post-arraignment misdemeanor detainees in the same manner\nas other jails handle the pre-arraignment detainees that were the focus of the extant case law\nprohibiting blanket strip searches.  This included not only issues of processing but, also, housing\npersons whom the court had ordered to be detained pending trial or making bond. \nWe also managed to develop sufficient evidence to obtain summary judgment in the\nClassโ favor on the methodology claims even though the Jail initially presented numerous\njustifications for using a group strip search procedure which, given the extremely large\npopulation of new detainees being processed each day, risked creating a jury question on the\nreasonableness of such searches (a question the Court found was in fact presented for the\npost-February 2007 class members).\nPlaintiffs succeeded on the search methods claim based in large part on two facts Class\nCounsel were able to marshal during discovery.  The first was the Jail administratorsโ concession\nthat privacy dividers could be installed in the hallway without impeding the timely processing of\nhundreds of inmates per night.  Once we elicited those admissions, we forced the Jailโs hand in\nterms of purchasing the dividers.  At the same time, the declaration evidence we gathered\nindicated that the Jail was not in fact using the dividers as it claimed to be, so there was a fine\nline which we needed to hew in both demonstrating the reasonableness of the dividers for\npurposes of summary judgment and, simultaneously, preserving the claims of the post-February\n2007 class members.19\n     19  We also were fortunate in being able to move the Defendantsโ own expert from the\npositions in his report to essentially backing Plaintiffsโ position by cross-examining him at his\ndeposition.  Separately, we created summaries of the declarations we had gathered in order to\npresent evidence of repeated abuses occurring on over 500 different days of the class period.  The\nsummaries presented a powerful picture of routine abuse as a policy at work in the Jail.\n25\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 31 of 44 PageID #:13906\nLiability Trial\nFollowing the Courtโs rulings on summary judgment, we briefed Defendantsโ motions for\nreconsideration and their request for an interlocutory appeal.  Simultaneously, five of our\nattorneys began preparing for the liability trial.\nWe took every preparation we could to win the trial, not only for the sake of the\npost-February 2007 class members, but also to protect those who had prevailed via the Courtโs\nsummary judgment ruling.  Defendants clearly contemplated appealing that ruling, and we feared\nthat a jury verdict for the defense would provide substantial fodder to undermine summary\njudgment in the eyes of the Seventh Circuit, even if it was not technically relevant.  Moreover,\nthe trial presented Defendants three bites at the apple because there were three Class I claims on\nwhich we had prevailed at summary judgment and which we needed to prove anew to the jury.\nThere was extensive additional investigation, discovery and motion practice prior to trial. \nAs explained above, we vetted hundreds of witnesses, and then participated in both written and\ndeposition discovery regarding 34 class members who were disclosed for the trial.  Between the\nCourtโs February 23, 2009 order on summary judgment and the commencement of trial on\nAugust 13, 2009, the parties litigated 55 written motions, including 32 motions in limine.\nLocating and vetting class members for the trials was also time-consuming.  Counsel\nfaced the challenge of finding good witnesses out of a pool of hundreds of thousands of persons\nin a population that typically have credibility problems.  Moreover, we had to prove a continuity\nof conduct over the course of years, which meant that we needed good witnesses from throughout\nthe relevant time-frame.  With a constant eye on preparing cases for jury trial, undersigned\ncounsel invested heavily in locating the best witnesses available to support the Classโs claims.\nClass counsel also had to retain a number of experts, both as consultants and as testifying\nexperts.  We vetted approximately a dozen potential experts and ended up using a jail practice\nexpert, a statistician, two database experts, and a damages expert.\nThe trial covered eight days and 29 witnesses.  Both from the standpoint of preparing the\ncase and of presenting it to a jury, the trial of this class action was largely unchartered territory\n26\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 32 of 44 PageID #:13907\nfor which there was little guidance.  As Professor Eisenberg attests, class actions are almost\nalways either dismissed or else settled following class certification and before a trial.  Exhibit L,\nEisenberg Aff. ยถ 82.

There are precious few\nprecedents for class action trials at all, much less in the context of a case such as this, where there\nwere multiple issues and questions for the jury, and where the evidence consisted largely of\nanecdotal accounts rather than documents and experts.\nInterlocutory Appeal\nFollowing a Plaintiffsโ verdict on all three claims, the Defendants filed an interlocutory\nappeal on immunity grounds, as well as a motion to certify a far broader interlocutory appeal\ncovering the merits of the summary judgment decision and jury verdict, a motion to stay the case,\nand a motion for new trial and judgment as a matter of law.  Plaintiffs successfully briefed each\nof them, and filed a motion to dismiss the interlocutory appeal in the Seventh Circuit as well as a\ncourt-ordered brief on finality of the judgment appealed from.  Those issues were sent to the\nmerits panel and briefing was ordered on the appeal.  See Young, No. 09-3092, Doc. 17-1 (7th\nCir. Nov. 13, 2009).\nDespite the fact that the Court denied the Sheriffโs motion to certify an interlocutory\nappeal on the merits, the Sheriff proceeded to make those arguments in his immunity appeal\nanyway, claiming that the issues were sufficiently intertwined with the immunity issues to give\nthe Seventh Circuit jurisdiction over the whole case.  Accordingly, Class Counsel was called\nupon to defend the entire case on appeal, and we prepared an exhaustive 53-page response\naddressing every aspect of the summary judgment merits and the juryโs verdict.\n27\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 33 of 44 PageID #:13908\nIn the end, the arguments we raised in our motion to dismiss the appeal prevailed.  \nThe merits panel found that the Defendantโs immunity argument was too insubstantial to create a\nnon-frivolous basis for jurisdiction.  The appeal was dismissed without the court reaching any of\nthe substantive issues going to the merits, deferring them until appeal after final judgment.  See\nMercado v. Dart, 604 F.3d 360, 366 (7th Cir. 2010); see also id. at 364 (agreeing with this Court\nthat โ[T]his appeal is substantively frivolous.  It is nothing but a delaying tactic and deserves to\nbe swiftly squelched.โ).\nThe Damages Phase\nAfter dealing with the slew of Defendantsโ motions that followed in the wake of the\nliability verdict, Class Counsel initiated damages discovery, consulted with experts about proving\ndamages on a class-wide basis, and researched procedures for using special masters.  This\nprocess culminated in Plaintiffsโ motion for a jury trial on class-wide damages.  See Dckt. No.\n493 (Plaintiffsโ Motion to Appoint a Special Master for the Damages Phase of the Case).  After\nresponsive briefing and argument, the Court denied the motion without prejudice, concluding\nthat it would hold jury trials so that the parties could see what the claims were worth.  See Dckt.\nNo. 503.\nThereafter, our five trial attorneys once again geared up for trial on a very short time\nframe, locating witnesses, participating in written and oral discovery, working with an expert,\nfiling motions, and preparing ten plaintiffs for trial.  In addition to the Class members, Counsel\nprepared to examine corroborating damages witnesses for each Class member (who were\ndeposed but did not ultimately testify).  Counsel also deposed thirteen Cermak Health Services\nemployees and Jail employees who were disclosed by the Defendants to rebut the damages\nPlaintiffs, but who never testified.\nThree separate jury trials were held back-to-back over the course of nine days.  At the\nconclusion of each trial, the juries awarded substantial damages to compensate plaintiffs for their\ninjuries.\n28\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 34 of 44 PageID #:13909\nSettlement Negotiations\nEven after Plaintiffs prevailed at each stage โ including on motions to dismiss, motions\nfor class certification, cross-motions for summary judgment, two interlocutory appeals to the\nSeventh Circuit, a liability trial, and three individual damage trials โ negotiating a favorable\nsettlement for the Class was not an easy proposition.  In addition to the complexity of modeling\nclaims rates and analyzing class sizes, the Parties were far apart on money, a gap that was\nmagnified by several insurersโ refusals to pay under the Countyโs policies.\nThe Court is familiar with the fact that it required at least six mediation sessions, as well\nas much additional work among the Parties, to finally reach a settlement agreement.  Leaving\naside the practical and political dimensions of any possible settlement, Class Counsel had to\nanalyze numerous issues of insurance coverage and assignments.  This required a great deal of\nresearch and creative thinking regarding relatively esoteric issues of insurance coverage, bad\nfaith litigation, and municipal liability insurance policies.\nOne measure of how complicated the negotiation became is that the lawyers for both\nsides had to hire coverage counsel to advise them.  To ensure that the Class had every advantage,\nClass Counsel hired an insurance specialist from the Howrey law firm to advise and assist.  As\nstated above, Class Counsel paid the Howrey firm almost $50,000, at hourly rates of $605/hour\nfor an attorney with the same graduation year as Mr. Kanovitz.  Exhibit K (Howrey invoices).\nClaims Administration And Notice\nOnce a settlement was reached, Class Counsel took the lead in soliciting competitive bids\nfrom possible claims administrators.  Counsel also developed training materials for the claims\nadministratorโs call center, and helped to train the companyโs customer service representatives\nwho answer Class Member inquiries.  Exhibit B, Affidavit of Robin Niemiec, at ยถ 4(e).\nWe also used our best efforts to get actual notice to the Class Members so as to facilitate\nclaims by as many eligible people as possible.  Prior to mailing, we made sure that the addresses\nin the Jailโs records were updated through national databases for changes of addresses.  See\nExhibit R, Keen Decl. ยถ11.  In addition, we obtained, via the Illinois Freedom of Information\n29\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 35 of 44 PageID #:13910\nAct, a database of all people being held at any Illinois Department of Correction (โIDOCโ)\nfacility in order to send direct notice to incarcerated class members who would not otherwise\nhave received notice.  Id. ยถ 12.  We also researched IDOC mail rules for each facility, and\ninstructed the Claims Administrator to print special envelopes complying with the particulars of\neach facility.  Id. ยถ 15.  Further, we worked with IDOCโs parole division to obtain the current\naddresses for individuals on parole.  Id. ยถ 13.  As a result of these efforts, 260,000 individual\nnotice packets were mailed on December 13, 2010.  See Exhibit B, Niemiec Affidavit ยถ 12.\nWe also allocated attorneys and staff within the firm to assist class members in the claims\nprocess.  We held clinics at the Harold Washington Public Library on weekends to assist class\nmembers in submitting claims forms and also accepted myriad โwalk-insโ at our office during the\nweek.  See Exhibit R, Bala Keen Decl. ยถ 16.  Thousands of class members also chose to contact\nus by telephone and letters.  Id. ยถ 9.  For a period of time, we had to dedicate two full-time\nattorneys to respond to all these inquires.  Id.  We have also received approximately 1,800 inmate\nletters since sending the Notice of the Settlement and have responded to each of these letters\nindividually.  Id. ยถ 8-9.\nEven now that the claims period has expired, Class Counsel will continue to invest\nsignificant time working with opposing counsel and the Claims Administrator to review the\nvalidity of the large number of claims that were submitted, and to determine the proper payment\nlevel to which valid claimants are entitled.  We estimate that another 610 hours of attorney time\nwill be required before the administration process is completed.  Id. ยถ 18.\nResponse and Claims Rates\nThe Class has responded positively to the Settlement.  As of the date of this filing, 77,933\nindividuals submitted claim forms.  See Exhibit B, Niemiec Aff. ยถ 18.  Based on preliminary\nanalysis to date, the Claims Administrator expects that 61,239 of these forms are valid claims,\nmeaning that we will have achieved a 25% claims rate.  Id. ยถ 20, 21.\nThe claims administrator has 30 years of experience administering class actions involving\nsimilar populations of claimants, and our efforts yielded one of the best claims rates the company\n30\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 36 of 44 PageID #:13911\nhas ever seen.  See Exhibit B, Niemiec Aff. ยถ 1.  Indeed, some historical claims rates in strip\nsearch settlements involving comparable municipalities have been significantly lower.  See, e.g.,\nMcBean v. City of New York, 233 F.R.D. 377, 382 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (7.5% claims rate; of 3,402\nclaims returned out of 40,352 class members); Tyson v. City of New York, Case No. 97 cv 3762\n(S.D.N.Y. filed 7/28/2003) (less than 10% claims rate); Williams v. County of Los Angeles, 2:97\ncv 03826-CW (C.D. Cal.) (9.15% participation rate) (available at http://www.clearinghouse.net/\ndetail.php?id=9746).  It appears likely that once the claims administration process is completed,\nover 50,000 class members will obtain benefits from the Settlement Fund.\nAs things move forward, Counsel will continue to oversee and supervise the claims\nadministratorโs processing of claim forms, resolving disputed claims, and making payments to\nClass Members until the claims processing is completed.\n*  *  *  *\nIn sum, this case was anything but simple.  This was not the type of class action in which\ncounsel merely shows up, gets in line with the other law firms, and bides time until distribution\nof the fund.  If there was to be any recovery, Class Counsel was going to have draw on their skills\nand experience to manufacture a path to victory, a path full of potential pitfalls.  This reality\nfurther supports the contingency sought here.\n5. The Absence Of Any Objections To The Settlement Provision\nAllowing A One-Third Contingency Fee\nAs a final note, this Court may also wish to consider that not one of the tens of thousands\nof responding class members have raised issues with the proposed fee.  In contrast to some\nabusive class actions where recoveries are structured as little more than a pretext to pay counselsโ\nfees, this Class is obviously pleased with the result, as well they should be.  Compare Isby v.\nBayh, 75 F.3d 1191 (7th Cir. 1996) (13% of the class in a jail conditions case filed objections to\na settlement).  Here, the total absence of any objections to the proposed fee is further evidence of\nthe reasonableness of a one-third fee.\n31\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 37 of 44 PageID #:13912\nD. Any โStair Stepโ Method Of Reducing The Fee Would Be Inappropriate Here\nWhile recognizing the primacy of risk, some Seventh Circuit decisions also note that\nclients sometimes negotiate โdiminishing marginalโ fee structure in which the contingency\npercentage varies by layer of recovery.  See Synthroid I, 264 F.3d at 721.  This concept has no\nvalid applicability here for several reasons.\nFirst, the economics that would support such a stair step approach make sense only in\ncases, such as commercial and consumer cases, where the amount of damages is essentially\nfixed, such that a greater commitment of time by counsel will not expand the damages available\nto the Class fund.  Id. at 721 (noting that class actions and commercial contingency structures\nโproduce diminishing marginal fees when the recovery will not necessarily increase in proportion\nto the number of hours devoted to the caseโ).  Here, by contrast, the damages were purely โsoftโ\nand, viewed realistically, the upper end of the fund was truly just a function of how hard and far\nClass Counsel could push the County before one side blinked.  In a very real sense, Class\nCounsel continually expanded the recovery by continuing to fight through trial, appeal, and\nbeyond, until we obtained what we felt to be a fund that was fair for the Class.20\nAs it turned out, the course of the litigation served to confirm that an ex ante stair step\narrangement would have run directly counter to the Classโ best interests.  Recall that the County\nstood on its offer of $20 million โ including an $8 million dollar contingency fee โ and would go\nno higher.  By refusing to settle on the cheap and instead investing the additional time to\ncontinue the battle through the damages trials and appeal, Class Counsel eventually succeeded in\nincreasing the settlement by 275% ($35 million additional dollars) plus the assignment of the\ninsurance claims.  \n     20  Comparable cases litigated by other class counsel have resulted in far smaller settlements\nwhen counsel accepted settlement offers without taking the case to a liability trial, much less\nthree additional damages trials and an appeal.  See Jackson v. Sheriff of Cook County, No. 06 cv\n493 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 28, 2007) ($4.575 million fund for strip searches with forced penile swabbing\nof approximately 160,000 individuals post-arraignment) (Exhibit T); Bullock v. County of Cook,\nNo. 04 cv 1051 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 18, 2010) ($4.2 million dollar fund for strip searches of\napproximately 150,000 individuals returned to the jail for out-processing after court appearance\nthat warranted their release) (Order Granting Preliminary Approval and Mot. for Preliminary\nApproval, attached as Group Exhibit U).\n32\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 38 of 44 PageID #:13913\nThe Classโ interests were thus served quite well by a compensatory incentive to pursue\nthe strategy of pushing the upper limit, despite the substantial additional risk.  Class Counsel, in\nother words, turned down the sure thing, instead risking everything because counsel believed an\nappropriate fund was much higher than what was being offered.  In the end, that perseverance\n(and the associated incentive) virtually tripled what Class received.  Under those circumstances, a\nmarginal fee arrangement that reduced the contingency percentage once the fund exceeded, say,\n$20 million would have been a terrible deal for the Class.  See Synthroid I, 264 F.3d at 721\n(โThis is not to say that systems with declining marginal percentages are always best.  They also\ncreate declining marginal returns to legal work, ensuring that at some point attorneysโ\nopportunity cost will exceed the benefits of pushing for a larger recovery, even though extra\nwork could benefit the client.โ).\nFinally, even if this case had been a good candidate for a commercial-type stair step\narrangement, that alone would say nothing about what percentages should govern each band of\nrecovery and, thus, sheds no light on whether an overall one-third percentage is proper for this\nsettlement.  For example, given that the Class needed Class Counsel to risk more than $200,000\nof out of pocket costs and approximately 15,000 attorney-hours to pursue this case, and given the\nex ante risk of loss and the likely financial stakes, the market may reasonably produce bands of\n50% of the first ten million,21 one-third of the next $25 million, and 25% of any additional\nrecovery.  The overall result of that banding example turns out to be exactly the same as a one-\nthird contingency.  Given that one-third is a common award in similar-sized and larger funds\nwhere the case presented a significant risk of no recovery, there is every reason to believe that the\nappropriate risk bands should blend to at least one-third.\nFurthermore, if anything, the Class here would reasonably have chosen to negotiate a\nstair-stepped fee that actually increased, rather than decreased.  The lower-middle seven figure\n     21  In Kirchoff, the Seventh Circuit observed that even in cases far less risky than civil rights\nlitigation, retainers commonly provide for a 50% contingency if the Defendant takes an appeal. \n786 F.2d at 324, n.5.\n33\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 39 of 44 PageID #:13914\nresults obtained in cases like Bullock and Jackson set the baseline; assuming the Class wished to\ndo better, a reasonable position is that it would only be willing to pay a low contingency for\naverage results, but that it would pay more for a better recovery, for example, by negotiating for\nonly 25% of the first $5 million, one-third of the next $20 million, and 40% of everything above\nthat.  Such an arrangement would equate to a 36% overall fee, which is essentially what Judge\nAshman found to be the market rate very recently in a similarly-sized common fund case that had\nbeen pending before this Court.  Airline Pilots Assoc., No. 06 cv 6869, slip op. at 7 (35% fee\naward is โconsistent with awards in similarly complex cases in this and other jurisdictions, and\naccurately reflects the market rate for Class Counselโs services consistent with Seventh Circuit\ncase law...โ) (attached as Exhibit A).\nThe point is that a one-third overall contingency fee is reasonable and accords with the\nmarket for the type of case and representation for which the Class would have been negotiating. \nThe Court should, therefore, approve the one-third fee allowed under the Settlement Agreement.  \nE.  For Cross-Check Purposes, A One-Third Contingency Fee Would Not Create\nAn Unjustified โWindfallโ\nAs explained above, Counsel has requested a fee percentage that is well-within the range\nof what is normal for cases of this type.  That said, courts may, if they chose to do so, utilize a\nโrough lodestar cross checkโ to ensure that counselโs total contingency fee as compared to the\nrough lodestar value of counselโs hourly time is within a reasonable range of multiples of that\nvalue.  In re Trans Union Corp. Privacy Litig., No. 00 cv 4729, 2009 WL 4799954, at *4 (N.D.\nIll. Dec. 9, 2009), modified and remanded on other grounds, 629 F.3d 741 (7th Cir. 2011).  \nTo be clear, a cross check is certainly not required, and some courts decline to employ\none.  See, e.g., Will, 2010 WL 4818174 at *3 (โThe use of a lodestar cross-check in a common\nfund case is unnecessary, arbitrary, and potentially counterproductiveโ); In re Comdisco Sec.\nLitig., 150 F. Supp. 2d 943, 949 (N.D. Ill. 2001) (โ[T]o view the matter through the lens of free\nmarket principles, any such ex post reevaluation (with or without a multiplier) is truly unjustified\nas a matter of logical analysis-and certainly so if it is only a one-way street.โ).  However, even\nwere the Court to consider this analysis, it does nothing to change the result.\n34\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 40 of 44 PageID #:13915\n1. Multipliers Between Two And Five Times Are Ordinarily Considered\nAcceptable\nCourts that do consider the lodestar have found multipliers within the two to five times\nrange to be acceptable.  See, e.g., In re Diet Drugs, 582 F.3d 524, 545 n.42 (3d Cir. 2009)\n(โWhether the multiplier is 2.6, 3.4, or somewhere in that neighborhood, it is not problematically\nhighโ); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396 F.3d 96 (2d Cir. 2005) (multiplier of 3.5\nin antitrust class action); In re Xcel Energy, Inc., Securities, Derivative & โERISAโ Litig., 364 F.\nSupp. 2d 980, 999 (D. Minn. 2005) (approving a 4.7 multiplier in lodestar cross-check); In re\nRite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 362 F. Supp. 2d 587, 590 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (approving fee award of a\n6.96 multiplier);  In re Interpublic Sec. Litig., No. Civ. 6527 Class Action, 2004 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 21429, at *36-37 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 26, 2004) (multiplier of 3.96); In re Household Intโl Inc.,\nNo. 02-7921 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 22, 2004) (approving fees amounting to a 4.65 multiplier) (attached\nas Exhibit V); Roberts v. Texaco, Inc., 979 F. Supp. 185, 198 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (awarding a 5.5\nmultiplier in race discrimination class action), reversed on other grounds, Kaplan v. Rand, 192\nF.3d 60 (2d Cir. 1999); In re Abbott Labs. Secur. Litig., No. 92 cv 3869, 1995 WL 792083, at\n*14  (N.D. Ill. July 3, 1995) (risks of case justified a 2.0 to 4.0 multiplier); Maley, 186 F. Supp.\n2d at 369-71 (approving โmodest multiplierโ of 4.65 in securities fraud class action).\n2. Class Counselโs Multiplier Of Approximately Three Is Well Within\nThe Range Of Acceptable\nHere, the rough lodestar cross-check confirms that a one-third contingency is comfortably\nwithin the range of reasonableness.  The total value of our firmโs lodestar time expended on\nbehalf of the class comes to approximately $5,994,894.75.  Kanovitz Decl. ยถ 42.  This lodestar\nreflects 3,730.5, 11,700, and 1,140 hours of work, billed at competitive market rates for partners,\nnon-partner attorneys, and paralegals, respectively.  See Exhibits 1 and 3 to Kanovitz Decl. (time\nsheets and lodestar summary).  At a one-third contingency, the multiplier comes to roughly 3.06. \nAs demonstrated above, this multiplier is definitely within the cross-check range that courts have\n35\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 41 of 44 PageID #:13916\nfound acceptable.22\nIn any event, the lodestar cross-check cannot become a vehicle to โre-engineerโ the\ncontingency percentage, because to do so would contravene the Seventh Circuitโs market-based\nex ante approach.  See Synthroid II, 325 F.3d at 979-80 (7th Cir. 2003) (โThe client cares about\nthe outcome aloneโ and class counselโs efficiency should not be used โto reduce class counselโs\npercentage of the fund that their work producedโ).  Neither should the cross-check cause a court\nto discount the ex ante market assessment of the riskiness of the case by substituting post-hoc\ndata suggesting that the bet succeeded.  Again, to do so would circumvent the Seventh Circuitโs\nex ante market approach by discounting the economic reality that contingency firms experience\nlosses as well as wins, and must offset the losers with the winners.  As Judge Shadur observed in\nComdisco:\n[I]t seems entirely unfair to. . . to measure the reasonableness of a bid-generated\npercentage-of-recovery fee against a lodestar benchmark that has been calculated\nin hindsight in terms of those actually expended hours. After all, if the litigation\nhad instead taken the path under which counsel had to slug the matter out to get\nthat same result, spending (say) 150% or 200% of the originally anticipated hours,\ncounsel would not be allowed to restructure its percentage bid in comparable\nhindsight terms to get a bigger share of the recovery.\n150 F. Supp. 2d at 948.\nIV. Counselโs Request For Reimbursement Of Costs Is Reasonable And Should Be\nApproved\nClass Counsel additionally seeks $227,374.98, said amount being costs they advanced to\nproduce the results achieved here.  See Exhibit X (Declaration of Andy Thayer and attached\nmaterials).\nThe Settlement Agreement expressly authorizes payment of Class Counselโs costs from\n     22  Class Counsel have submitted the affidavit of Bruce Meckler in support of their fee petition\nto opine on their rates, which are significantly below where they would be had counsel remained\nat their prior law firms representing corporate clients.  See Affidavit of Bruce Meckler, attached\nas Exhibit W.  Mr. Meckler frequently opines on attorneysโ fees in the context fee litigation.  Id.\nยถ 2-3.  Moreover, even though the โrough lodestarโ cross check does not require scrutiny of the\nbillable hours, and even though courts permit counsel to proffer summaries, we have provided\ndetailed time records, not merely a summary of the hours charged, as class counsel often do.  Our\nrecords demonstrate the reasonable, efficient and hard work that we put in over the past five\nyears to achieve a tremendous result for the class.  See Exhibit J, Kanovitz Decl. ยถ 3.\n36\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 42 of 44 PageID #:13917\nthe fund.  Dckt. No. 624, ยถ 33.  This accords with Rule 23(h), which provides for reimbursement\nof โreasonableโ expenses in common fund class action settlements such as this.  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(h); see also 1998 Advisory Committee Notes (subsection 23(h) applies to cost awards in\ncommon fund settlements).  Indeed, โ[i]t is well-established that counsel who create a common\nfund like this one are entitled to the reimbursement of litigation costs and expenses.  The\nexpenses that may be reimbursed from the common fund encompass โall reasonableโ\nlitigation-related expenses.โ  In re Marsh ERISA Litig., 265 F.R.D. 128, 150 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).\nAs reflected in Mr. Thayerโs Declaration and the accompanying materials, the costs for\nwhich Counsel seeks reimbursement represent the reasonable expenditures necessary to advance\nthe case, such as expert fees for data analysis and jail policy experts, deposition and transcript\nfees and travel.  Counsel incurred these reasonable expenses to aggressively litigate the case,\nsuch as conducting the necessary data and statistical analysis and engaging experts.  These are the\ntypical expenses the market reimburses as the costs of litigation.  See, e.g., Synthroid I, 264 F.3d\nat 722 (reversing the district court for failure to award costs because court failed to consider the\nmarketโs reimbursement for such costs); In re Continental Sec. Litig., 962 F.2d at 570 (finding\nerror for district court not to reimburse class counsel for electronic research expenses from\ncommon fund).23  The $227,374.98 sought should be approved.\nV. The Court Should Approve The Incentive Bonuses For Class Representatives And\nClass Members Who Testified At The Liability Trial\nClass Counsel requests that the Court approve the $25,000 Named Plaintiff Incentive\nAwards and the $10,000 Testifying Class Member Incentive Awards, to be paid out of the\nSettlement Fund, as provided for in Paragraphs 30 and 31 of the Settlement Agreement.  The\nnine Named Plaintiffs in this action (Kim Young, Ronald Johnson, William Jones, Allen\nGorman, Gerrad Lamour, Lee Mercado, Bradley Hytrek, Carl Gray and Matthew Liptak) were\nactive, hands-on participants in this litigation, all to the benefit of the Class as a whole.\n     23  Over the course of their representation, Class Counsel generated Westlaw bills in the\namount of $355,201.  However, Class Counsel has decided not to seek reimbursement for that\ncost, notwithstanding the legal authority to do so cited in the text, because West invoices our firm\nat a fixed rate.  In that sense, the cost is thus more akin to overhead, and Class Counsel cites it as\nfurther support for our request for one-third contingency.\n37\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 43 of 44 PageID #:13918\nFirst, Named Plaintiff Kim Young worked hard to locate legal counsel to redress the\nwrongs she suffered at the Jail; she persevered through ten attorney rejections before locating\nClass Counsel.  See Exhibit G, Young Aff. ยถ 3.  The Class further benefitted from the substantial\nservice provided by the nine Named Plaintiffs, and the significant investment of their time,\nincluding consulting with Counsel and actively participating in discovery.  Each of the Named\nPlaintiffs prepared for and was deposed by Defendantsโ counsel, undergoing extensive\nquestioning about their experiences at the Jail.  In addition, six of the Named Plaintiffs testified\nat the nine-day liability trial in August 2009.\nThe Named Plaintiff Incentive Awards sought here are consistent with those awarded in\nother common fund class actions with active participation, such as Plaintiffs exhibited here.  See\nCook v. Niedert, 142 F.3d 1004, 1016 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming award of $25,000 to named\nplaintiff in recognition of the actions the plaintiff  โ[took] to protect the interests of the class, the\ndegree to which the class [] benefitted from those actions, and the amount of time and effortโ the\nnamed plaintiff expended in pursuing the litigation); Will, 2010 WL 4818174, at *4 (describing\n$25,000 named plaintiff incentive award as โwell within the ranges typically awardedโ for\nparticipation in the litigation); Berger v. Xerox Corp. Retirement Income Guar. Plan, No. 00-584,\nNo. 2004 WL 287902, at *3 (S.D. Ill. Jan. 22, 2004) (approving $20,000 named plaintiff\nincentive awards).\nIn addition to the Named Plaintiffs, fifteen class members testified at the liability trial. \nThey too had to participate in discovery, as well as take time away from work and other\nresponsibilities, and endure the rigor and stress of litigation, all without knowing whether they\nwould prevail.  Their contributions to the liability trial were essential to the Classโs success at\nthat critical juncture in the litigation.  Approval of the nine Named Plaintiff Incentive Awards is\nwarranted based on these individualsโ active participation in the litigation, their expenditure of\ntime, and the benefit they conferred on the Class.24  \n     24  The individuals eligible for the Testifying Class Member Incentive Awards are: Paul Beck, Bobby\nBishop, Robert Brown, Robert Consiglio, James Curran, Michael Higgs, John Jacobson, Derrick Jones,\nDennis Maimonis, Darryl Paul, Osbaldo Santiago, Eric Slapak, Del Wilson and Rickey Winfield.\n38\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 637 Filed: 02/15/11 Page 44 of 44 PageID #:13919\nConclusion\nFor the reasons set forth herein, Class Counsel respectfully request that the Court approve\npayment from the Settlement Fund for: (1) a fee award of one-third of the Settlement Fund in the\namount of $18,333,333 to Class Counsel; (2) reimbursement of Class Counselโs costs in the total\namount of $227,374.98; (3) Named Plaintiffsโ Incentive Awards in the amount of $25,000 to\neach of the nine named plaintiffs; and (4) Testifying Class Member Incentive Awards in the\namount of $10,000 to each of the individuals, who are not Named Plaintiffs, and who testified at\nthe August 2009 trial.\nRespectfully submitted,\ns/ Mike Kanovitz          \nArthur Loevv\nJon Loevy\nMike Kanovitz\nSamantha Liskow\nRoshna Bala Keen\nHeather Lewis Donnell\nLOEVY & LOEVY\n312 North May\nSuite 100\nChicago, IL 60607\nCertificate of Service\nI, Mike Kanovitz, an attorney, hereby certify that on February 15, 2011, I caused a copy\nof this Petition to be filed and served on all counsel of record by means of the Courtโs electronic\nfiling system.\ns/ Mike Kanovitz     \n39",

The Motion should be granted for the reasons that follow. \nIntroduction \n  Plaintiffs and their counsel overcame numerous obstacles to reach the point of a \nsatisfactory settlement.  They aggressively litigated for over four years, pushing the case \nmuch further than most class actions ever go.  As a result, the Class was able to achieve a \nrecord-breaking settlement of $55 million in cash, plus an assignment of claims.  All \nparties to the case now seek to have the Court finally approve the Settlement and bring \nthis litigation to an end. \nCourts consider several factors at this stage of the settlement process, and here \nthey all point unanimously to final approval.  For starters, Counsel respectfully submits \nthat the negotiations yielded the maximum amounts that the Class could have hoped to \nattain in settlement, and the resulting fund is clearly fair and adequate for the Class.  \nOther cases raising comparable issues for comparable classes achieved far less.  See, e.g., \nMotion for Preliminary Approval and Settlement Agreement, Bullock v. Dart, No. 04 CV \n01051 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 17, 2010) ($1.4 million dollar fund for class of 16,000 individuals \nwith payment awards between $100 and $200 per valid claim) (attached as Group Exhibit \nA at pp. 1, 10-11); Order Granting Final Approval and Memorandum in Support of \nProposed Settlement, Jackson v. Sheriff of Cook County, No. 06 CV 493  (N.D. Ill. Nov. \n2, 2007) ($4.575 million dollar fund for class of approximately 100,000 individuals with \npayment awards between $100 and $200) (attached as Group Exhibit B at pp. 1, 3). \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 5 of 27 PageID #:15722\n  Moreover, settlement was the only good litigation option at the time that the Class \nchose to settle.  Not only did the Class avoid the risk of appeal from the forthcoming final \njudgment -- which in this case was a serious concern in light of changing law and the fear \nof sympathy for Defendantsโ financial position -- it also avoided the untenable deluge of \nindividual damages trials.  Put simply, even if the Class won the appeal, most Class \nMembers would have been losers in practical effect because of the impossibility of trying \nso many damages claims.  There can be little doubt that the Settlement is fair and in the \nbest interests of the Class. \n  Likewise, the notice sent to the Class was extremely effective.  Class Counsel \nworked very hard to increase Class Member participation, and as a result of all of those \ndiligent efforts (explained below), the Class Members have submitted claims at a high \nrate of at least 25%.  By comparison, class actions involving strip search claims in New \nYork and Los Angeles achieved claims rates of only 10% or less. \n  Finally, there have been very few objections to the settlement, particularly for a \nclass of this size.  Of the seven total objections, one was filed by an individual who \napparently believes he should receive over $1.3 million from the fund, one seeks to have \nan award of clemency instead of money damages, and the remaining objections do not \ndemonstrate any substantial grounds to doubt the adequacy and fairness of the \nSettlement. \n  Accordingly, and for the reasons that follow, the Court should finally approve the \nSettlement, finally certify the Settlement Classes, and order the Claims Administrator to \nmake payments from the Settlement Fund to Class Members who have submitted timely \nand valid claims. \n  2 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 6 of 27 PageID #:15723\nFacts \n   \nA.   Overview Of The Litigation \n \n  As the Court has had the opportunity to observe over the last four and one-half \nyears, the parties actively and aggressively litigated this case before reaching a \nsettlement.  The case proceeded all the way through summary judgment, a liability trial, \nan interlocutory appeal, and several damages trials โ the later three stages going well \nbeyond the amount of process that most classes receive.  In other words, the claims here \nwere thoroughly litigated; there is no sense in which the Settlement was reached \nprematurely or without an ample exploration of the merits of the Classโ prospects and \npitfalls.  \n  Class Counselโs previously-filed Petition for attorneysโ fees, costs, and class \nmember incentive bonuses (Dkt. 637) contains an extensive summary of the litigation \nactivities during each stage of the litigation, as well as the associated risks faced by the \nClass.  Rather than set forth the same lengthy and detailed background here, Plaintiffs \nrespectfully refer the Court to pages 20-28 of that pleading, which is incorporated herein.   \nB.    The Settlement Process And The Settlement Agreement \n \n  The Settlement Fund that was eventually accepted by the Class was not only the \nresult of not only hard litigating, but also hard bargaining.  As the Court is aware, the \nparties spent months in negotiations, both in six mediation sessions involving this Court, \nas well as additional outside conversations.  Both sides also hired insurance coverage \nattorneys to advise them about the various applicable insurance policies that covered \nCook County during the class period.  Plaintiffs also analyzed the Defendantsโ database, \nreviewed claims rates from other class actions with similar populations of claimants, and \n  3 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 7 of 27 PageID #:15724\nconducted a 2,000 person random sample audit to gain a better understanding of the \npercentage of detainees who fit the Class II definition.  Based on all of these efforts, \nClass Counsel was able to negotiate a Settlement Fund that maximized the total \nconsideration that the County was able to pay to the Class. \n  The proposed Settlement Agreement provides the Class with both a $55 million \ndollar cash fund and an assignment of claims against certain of the Countyโs insurers (the \nโSettlement Fundโ).  See Exhibit C (Settlement Agreement at ยถยถ 27-28).  The cash \nportion pays for compensation to Class Members, as well as the costs of notice and \nsettlement administration, incentive bonuses to class members who assisted the class, and \nthe attorneysโ fees and costs for Class Counsel.  Id. at ยถยถ 29-33.  The cash available for \npayment to the Class will be distributed in shares which vary based upon three categories \nof class membership: men in Class II, men in Class I, and women in Class II.  Id. at ยถ 34.  \nA reversion of up to $5 million was also built into the Settlement to protect Cook County \nin the event that the class claims rate was not sufficient to consume the funds available \nfor payment, net of fees and costs, using an expected payment of $1,000 for Class II men, \n$700 for Class I men, and $500 for Class II women.  Id. at ยถ 37.  However, as explained \nbelow, the claims rate in this case should be more than sufficient to moot any reversion.  \nSee Exhibit D (Declaration of Michael Kanovitz at ยถ 10).  The Settlement Agreement \nprovides that Settlement Class members will receive their payment from the cash portion \nof the Fund within 91 days after the entry of a final order approving the settlement (and \nassuming there are no appeals).  See Exhibit C (Settlement Agreement at ยถ 44).  \n  The Settlement Agreement also proposes that this Court retain jurisdiction until \nthe litigation on the assigned claims is finally resolved so that the Court can determine \n  4 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 8 of 27 PageID #:15725\nthe fairness of any settlement on the insurance claims and apportion fees and costs, \nthough it does not require that such claims be pursued in federal court.  See Exhibit C \n(Settlement Agreement at ยถ 47(f)).  Any additional recovery on the assigned claims will \nbe distributed to the claimants in a manner like the cash portion will be distributed.  Id. at \nยถ 44. \nC.   Notice and Claims Administration \n \n  On November 24, 2010, the Court granted Plaintiffsโ motion for preliminary \napproval of the Settlement Agreement, and ordered the Claims Administrator to mail \nindividual notice to potential Class Members. Dkt. 628; 624. The Court also approved the \npartiesโ Notice Plan, Published Notice and Claim Form.  Id. \n  On December 13, 2010, pursuant to the Notice Plan, individual notices were \nmailed to 249,589 persons who appeared to be Class Members based on the data \nprovided by Cook County Jail.  See Exhibit E (Affidavit of Robin Niemiec at ยถ 12).  The \nNotice was sent after the Claims Administrator first researched the last known address for \nClass Members in LexisNexis (which resulted in 155,555 updated addresses for \nindividuals), and ran the class mailing list through the United States National Change of \nAddress database.  Id. at ยถ 7.  In addition, Class Counsel provided the Claims \nAdministrator the current population of individuals held at Illinois Department of \nCorrection Facilities (โIDOCโ) that Counsel had obtained via the Illinois Freedom of \nInformation Act (โFOIAโ).  Id. at ยถยถ 8-10; Exhibit F (Affidavit of Roshna Bala Keen at ยถ \n8).  Counsel directed the Claims Administrator to compare the Class mailing list with \nIDOCโs population, which resulted in sending 29,019 individual Notice packets to Class \n  5 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 9 of 27 PageID #:15726\nMembers within IDOC facilities, who likely would not otherwise have received notice.  \nSee Exhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at ยถ 9); Exhibit F (Bala Keen Aff. at ยถ 8).   \nTo ensure that these Class Members received timely notices, Counsel also \nresearched IDOCโs mail rules for each facility and instructed the Claims Administrator to \nprint special envelopes complying with the particulars required by each facility.  See \nExhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at ยถ 10); Exhibit F (Bala Keen Aff. at ยถ 11).   Counsel also \nworked with IDOCโs parole division to obtain the current address for anyone on parole, \nwhich resulted in sending 24,769 Notices to updated addresses for Class Members.   See \nExhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at ยถ 11); Exhibit F (Bala Keen Aff. at ยถ 9).  The Claims \nAdministrator mailed an additional 14,730 Notice Packets based on individualsโ requests.  \nExhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at ยถ 13).   \n  Despite these efforts, approximately 87,050 Notice Packets were returned as \nundeliverable without forwarding address and 1,086 were returned with forwarding \naddresses, which the Claims Administrator then mailed to the new addresses.  Id. at ยถ 14.  \nFor any Notice Packets returned from IDOC facilities, the Claims Administrator went to \nIDOCโs inmate locator on the IDOC website to find the current facility at which the \nindividual was held, and then re-mailed the Notice Packet, which resulted in 1,933 Notice \nPackets being sent to a second IDOC facility.  Id.  All told, 266,252 Notice Packets were \nmailed to potential class members.  Id. at ยถ 16. \n  In addition to the individual mailed Notice, published Notice was provided in two \nprint cycles in: (1) La Raza, a Spanish-language weekly publication, published on \nDecember 17, 2010 and January 14, 2011; (2) the Chicago Sun Times, published on \nDecember 15, 2010 and January 15, 2011; (3) the Chicago Defender, published on \n  6 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 10 of 27 PageID #:15727\nDecember 15, 2010 and January 12, 2011; and (4) Prison Legal News, a monthly \npublication for incarcerated individuals, published on December 1, 2010 and January 1, \n2011.  See Exhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at ยถ 18).   Published Notice ran in each of the \npublications as a quarter-page advertisement located in the main body of the paper (not \nthe classified section).  Additionally, a blank claim form was published in Prison Legal \nNews in both print cycles, allowing incarcerated individuals to directly submit a claim \nform without needing to request one, which often requires extra time for these \nindividuals.  \nThe Notice Plan provided that the Jail would post โthe Published Notice inside the \nCook County Jail Receiving Classification and Diagnostic Center [RCDC] in a location \nthat is accessible and visible to detainees.โ  See Exhibit C (Settlement Agreement at ยถ \n14(h)).  No date was specified for when the posting would occur, though the parties had \ncontemplated that the posting would be placed in RCDC beginning on December 13, \n2010, the date of the initial mailing. \nThe Cook County Department of Corrections (โCCDOCโ) posted the Published \nNotice on January 3, 2011.  See Exhibit F (Bala Keen Aff. at ยถ 13).  The Published \nNotice was placed not only in the RCDC but in every division of the Jail and, in addition, \nit was posted in the law library and in several common areas of the Jail.  Id. at ยถ 12-13.  \nTo accommodate Class Members who were processed into the Jail between December \n13, 2010, and January 2, 2011, prior to the Jail posting, the parties agreed to accept late \nclaims from these individuals, provided their claim is postmarked on or before February \n17, 2011.  Id. at ยถ 14.  CCDOC has provided the Claims Administrator with a list of all \n  7 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 11 of 27 PageID #:15728\nadmittees to the Jail during this time period.  Id. at ยถ 15; see also Exhibit E (Niemiec Aff. \nat ยถ 17). \n  In addition to the published notice, Class Counsel held four clinics at the Chicago \nHarold Washington Public Library to assist class members in submitting claim forms, \nand also accepted a number of โwalk-insโ at our law office.  See Exhibit F (Bala Keen \nAff. at ยถ 16).   Thousands of class members also chose to contact Counsel by telephone, \nletter, and email. Id. at ยถ 4. Counsel received approximately 3,200 telephone calls and \n1,800 inmate letters since sending the Notice, all of which were responded to \nindividually.  Id. at ยถ 4.   \n  The Notice campaign was extraordinarily effective, and resulted in a claims rate \nfor this case that is well above average.  See Exhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at ยถ 41).  To date, \nthe Claims Administrator has received 78,314 claim forms of which 62,037 have been \nfound to be valid and timely. Id. at ยถ 39.  There are an additional 132 timely claims which \nthe Claims Administrator still must process to determine if they are valid.  Id. at ยถ 38.  \nThus, the claims rate for this settlement is at least 25% and could be as high as 28%.   \nThis is a much higher claims rate than average for this size class.  See Exhibit E (Niemiec \nAff. at ยถ 41) (Based on Rustโs experience as the claims administrator in other civil rights \nsettlement class actions, the 25% eligible claim rate in this case is above-average and \nhigher than similar settlements ).  For example, the Jackson settlement achieved a claims \nrate of only 11% for the same class of Cook County Jail detainees represented here (the \nJackson class was limited to men and the class period ended in 2007, so it covered \napproximately 100,000 members).  See Group Exhibit G at p. 1 (Plaintiffโs Memorandum \nin Support of Approval of Proposed Settlement and Order Granting Final Approval, \n  8 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 12 of 27 PageID #:15729\nJackson v. Sheriff of Cook County, No. 06 cv 493  (N.D. Ill. Nov. 2, 2007)).  Likewise, \nstrip search class actions in New York and Los Angeles also produced far lower claims \nrates.  See Exhibit D (Kanovitz Decl. at Exhibit 6) (McBean v. City of New York, 02 CV \n5426 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (11% claims rate with 3,402 claims returned out of 40,352 class \nmembers)); id. at Exhibit 8 (Tyson v. City of New York, Case No. 97 CV 3762 \n(S.D.N.Y) (less than 10% claims rate with 6,000 claims returned in a class of 67,000)); \nid. at Exhibit 4 (Williams v. County of Los Angeles, 97 CV 03826 (C.D. Cal.) (13.3% \nclaims rate with 36,730 claims returned in a class of 276,717)).   \nThus, as a result of the high claims rate, far more class members will receive a \npayment through the Settlement Agreement than in the average case of this kind.  Also, \nas a result of the high claims rate, there should be no reversion to Cook County, meaning \nthat the Class will receive the benefit of the entire $55 million fund.   \nD.   Per-Class Member Distribution \n \n  As stated, Class Counsel has previously filed a Petition for attorneysโ fees and \ncosts, as well as class representative and class member incentive bonuses allowed under \nthe Settlement Agreement.  Assuming the Court grants the Petition, the Class will receive \n$35,335,000, or 64.2% of the cash portion of the fund.  This amount will be distributed \nentirely to the claimants, but, due to the high claim rates for this settlement, the estimated \ndistribution per-class member will be prorated in accordance with the Settlement \n  9 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 13 of 27 PageID #:15730\nAgreement.1  The estimated per-class member payment amounts in the Settlement \nAgreement and Notice are up to $1,000 for Class II men, $700 for Class I men, and $500 \nfor Class II women.  See Exhibit D (Kanovitz Decl. at ยถ 7).  Both the Settlement \nAgreement and the Class Notice state that the payment each class member receives \nwould be less than the expected amount in the event that more than the anticipated \nnumber of Class Members submitted claims.  See Exhibit C (Settlement Agreement at ยถ \n26); Exhibit H (Notice at Question 8) (โIf more than the expected number of class \nmembers submit claims, then the actual payments from the $55 million fund will be less \nthan the expected payments, and there will be no reimbursement to the Countyโ).   \n  The pro rata adjustment amount should be approximately proportional to the \namount by which the actual claims rate exceeds 20%.  The final proration will also \ndepend, to a lesser extent, upon the percentage mix of Class II to Class I claimants, \nbecause Class I men receive only 70% of the payment to Class II men, and women are \nonly covered by the Settlement if they are in Class II.  \n  At present, about 21% of claimants are confirmed to meet the definition of Class \nII based on the information for each claimant reflected in the Jailโs database.  See Exhibit \nF  (Bala Keen Aff. at ยถ 20).  That percentage is expected to increase to as high as 26% as \n                                                \n1  As the parties closed the gap in their negotiations over the cash portion of the Settlement Fund \nand the Countyโs reversion rights, Class Counsel tried to arrive at as accurate an estimate of the \nclaims rate as possible.  Information Counsel had on other large strip search class actions (classes \nof 40,000 or greater) revealed an average claims rate of  approximately 13%, with a high claims \nrate of approximately 20%.  See Exhibit D (Kanovitz Decl. at ยถ  6), and id. at Exhibit 4 (summary \nchart).  Rust Consulting, the Claims Administrator, confirmed that these figures fairly reflect the \nlikely claims rate range for the Young class.   See Exhibit F (Bala Keen Aff. at ยถ 19).  Counsel \ncalculated the anticipate a per-class member payments based on an assumption that Plaintiffs \nwould achieve a claims rate towards the higher end of this range. \n \n  10\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 14 of 27 PageID #:15731\nthe claims are processed, due to adjustments for ambiguities in the Jailโs database.2  If the \nrate of Class II membership reaches 26%, then the per-class member payments would be \n$770 for Class II men, $539 for Class I men, and $385 for Class II women at a 25% \nclaims rate.  Lower Class II rates would mean higher per-class member payments.  Id. at \nยถ 21. \n  Even with the above-average claims rate here, the cash portion of the fund \nremains so large that the prorated figures still compare favorably with the amounts paid \nin other strip search class actions approved as fair.  See, e.g., Plaintiffโs Memorandum in \nSupport of Approval of Proposed Settlement, Jackson, 06 CV 593 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 26, \n2007) (awards of between $100-$200 for strip search and invasive penile swab, subject to \nreduction in the event that the claims rate exceeded 16%) (attached as Group Exhibit G at \np. 3); Plaintiffโs Memorandum in Support of Approval of Proposed Settlement, Notice of \nClass Proposed Settlement and Hearing and Order Granting Final Approval, Calvin v. \nSheriff of Will County, 03 CV 3086 (N.D.

See Exhibit D (Settlement Agreement at ยถ 29); Exhibit F (Bala Keen \nAff. at ยถ 21).

Movants explain as follows. \nA.  The Proposed Settlement Is Fair, Reasonable And Adequate, And \nShould Be Finally Approved \n โFederal courts naturally favor the settlement of class action litigation.โ   Isby v. \nBayh, 75 F.3d 1191, 1196 (7th Cir.1996); see also Armstrong v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of \nMilwaukee, 616 F.2d 305, 313 (7th Cir. 1980), overruled on other grounds, Felzen v. \nAndreas, 134 F.3d 873 (7th Cir. 1998) (โSettlement of the complex disputes often \ninvolved in class actions minimizes the litigation expenses of both parties and also \nreduces the strain such litigation imposes upon already scarce judicial resources.โ).  To \nfinally approve a class action settlement, the Court โmust determine whether a proposed \ndecree is lawful, fair, reasonable, and adequate.โ  E.E.O.C. v. Hiram Walker & Sons, \nInc., 768 F.2d 884, 889 (7th Cir. 1985) (citing Gautreaux v. Pierce, 690 F.2d 616, 631 \n(7th Cir. 1982)).  In its review, the Court considers the facts โin the light most favorable \nto the settlementโ and evaluates the fairness of the settlement viewing it in its entirety, \nrather than its component parts.  Isby, 75 F.3d at 1199 (quoting Armstrong, 616 F.2d at  \n                                                \n3  None of these cases achieved the high claims rates achieved here. See, e.g. Plaintiffsโ \nMemorandum in Support of Approval of Proposed Settlement, Calvin, No. 06 CV 03086 (N.D. \nIll.) (filed Nov. 16, 2006) (as of date of filing for final approval, the claims rate was 15%) \n(attached as Group Exhibit I at p. 7); Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffsโ and \nDefendantโs Motion for Final Approval of Settlement and Class Certification, Boone, No. 05 CV \n1851 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 23, 2009) (as of date of filing, claims rate was 15%) (attached as Group \nExhibit J at p. 16). \n \n  12\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 16 of 27 PageID #:15733\n315 (7th Cir. 1980)).  The Seventh Circuit has โadmonished [the district courts] โto \nrefrain from resolving the merits of the controversy or making a precise determination of \nthe partiesโ respective legal rights . . . .โโ  Id. at 1196-97 (quoting in part E.E.O.C. v. \nHiram Walker & Sons, Inc., 768 F.2d 884, 889 (7th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 478 U.S. \n1004). \nTo make its fairness determination, the Court considers the following factors:  (1) \nthe strength of plaintiffsโ case compared to the amount of defendantsโ settlement offer; \n(2) an assessment of the likely complexity, length and expense of the litigation; (3) an \nevaluation of the amount of opposition to settlement among affected parties; (4) the \nopinion of competent counsel, and; (5) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of \ndiscovery completed at the time of settlement.  Synfuel Technologies, Inc. v. DHL \nExpress (USA), Inc., 463 F.3d 646, 653 (7th Cir. 2006), quoting Isby, 75 F.3d at 1199.  \n  Applying the foregoing factors here strongly supports approval of the settlement \nas fair, reasonable and adequate.  Most significantly, the approximate expected value of \ncontinued litigation to Class Members is within range of the actual settlement, which \ndemonstrates the fairness of the Countyโs $55 million dollar settlement offer.  \n1.  The Strength Of Plaintiffsโ Case Is Appropriately Balanced \nwith Defendantโs Settlement Offer \nOf the factors described above, the most important is the strength of Plaintiffsโ \ncase compared with the Defendantโs settlement offer.  Isby, at 75 F.3d at 1199 (โThe \ndistrict court properly recognized that the first factor, the relative strength of plaintiffsโ \ncase on the merits as compared to what the Defendants offer by way of settlement, is the \nmost important consideration.โ); see also Armstrong, 616 F.2d at 314 (same).  Under the \nSeventh Circuitโs approach to this factor, the Court must โquantify the net expected value \n  13\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 17 of 27 PageID #:15734\nof continued litigation to the class.โ  Synfuel, 463 F.3d at 653, quoting Reynolds v. \nBeneficial Nat. Bank, 288 F.3d 277, 284 (7th Cir. 2002).  To do so, the Court should \nโestimat[e] the range of possible outcomes and ascrib[e] a probability to each point on the \nrange.โ  Id.  Although โ[a] high degree of precision cannot be expected in valuing a \nlitigation,โ the Court should determine a โballpark valuation.โ  Id.   \nAfter years of litigating their respective positions, the parties were well-equipped \nto assess the settlement value of Plaintiffsโ claims.  From Plaintiffsโ perspective, it would \nhave been a losing proposition to continue litigating.  Without a settlement, the class \nmembers would have had to face the prospect of individual damages trials in order to \nobtain compensation.  That would be a pipe dream for most class members.  Somewhere \nbetween 60,000 and 70,000 class members have submitted valid claims.  If each of those \npersons instead had to participate in a damages trial, and assuming the Court could try \nthree plaintiffsโ claims per day, we would need a minimum of 20,000 court days, of \nwhich there are approximately 252 per year.  Assuming the Court had nothing to do but \ntry these cases, it would take much of the rest of the century to complete the trials.4  In \nother words, settlement was the sensible decision for the Class as a whole.   \nMoreover, as the Court observed first hand, the cash portion of the fund \nrepresents the most that the County could pay in settlement (certainly as a political and \npractical matter).  Even so, the Class is also receiving an assignment of potentially \nvaluable claims against the insurers that refused to provide coverage.   The policies \nprovided for $80 million in coverage and the assignment includes claims to damages in \n                                                \n4   Certainly a Court might fashion other solutions to get class members compensated, as by using \nspecial masters or entering a liability judgment classwide so that the individual class members \ncould pursue damages actions in multiple courts.  Nevertheless, the foregoing example illustrates \nwhy a settlement was prudent at this juncture.   \n  14\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 18 of 27 PageID #:15735\nexcess of the coverage.  Although no one can predict the future, the assignments are \nvaluable and may well result in additional monies beyond the cash portion of the fund \nbeing paid to the Class. \nAlso militating in favor of settlement was the risk of appeal from the forthcoming \nfinal judgments.  For the reasons set out more fully in Class Counsel Fee Petition pages 9 \nn.4 and 14, dkt. 637, there was appellate risk on both the Class I and Class II claims, and \nthe state of the Countyโs financial condition loomed in the background.  See also \nFlorence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, 621 F.3d 296 (3rd Cir. \n2010) (dismissing blanket strip search claim); Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, \n595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (same) Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th \nCir. 2008) (en banc) (same).   \n2.  Continued Litigation Would Be Lengthy, Complex And Costly \n  If the parties were to continue to litigate this action through individual damage \ntrials, each side would expend considerable time and money in prosecuting and defending \ntheir positions.  As explained above, it would take almost 80 years of trial time were all \nthe claims to be tried.  The costs in attorney and court time would be enormous.  \nMoreover, even with creative solutions to try to ensure that the class members got their \nday in court, many class members would certainly have to wait several years for \ncompensation, if not longer.  By contrast, the proposed Settlement Agreement provides \ncompensation now to all of the Class Members who have submitted timely, valid claims. \n3.  There Is Virtually No Genuine Opposition To The Settlement \nAgreement \n  Given the large size of the class and the number of individual notices that were \nmailed, it is telling that only seven objections were received.  Cf. Isby v. Bayh, 75 F.3d \n  15\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 19 of 27 PageID #:15736\n1191, 1200  (7th Cir. 1996) (13% of jail conditions class members filed objections to \nsettlement).  Of these seven, only five were properly filed with the Court and timely.5  \nDespite these deficiencies, Counsel has addressed the substance of all of the objections \nbelow. \n  Of these seven, one is filed by a person who requests that 2.5% of the settlement \nfund be allocated to him personally without any explanation or basis for doing so.  See \nExhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at Exhibit 9 at pp. 2-4) (Objection filed by Sienky Lallemand).   \nHis objection seeks a disproportionate and unfair allocation of the settlement fund. \n  The remaining objections are no more problematic.  For instance, Richard \nKearney objects to the fact that Class I men will receive a payment that is less than Class \nII men, given that all men go through the same strip search procedure regardless of their \ncharges.  Id. at Exhibit 9 at p. 5.  The difference in payment levels is fair.  Unlike Class I \nmen, Class II men had a claim that they should not have been strip searched at all and \ntherefore should not have suffered any intrusion of privacy.  It is appropriate to assess \ntheir injuries as greater than persons who were allowed to be strip searched. \n  William T. Sherrod objects that the settlement fund should be allocated in such a \nmanner that persons who were strip searched multiple times during the class period \nwould receive up to five payments.  See Exhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at Exhibit 9 at p. 1).  \nWhile this is one way of allocating the available settlement monies, it is not the only fair \nmethod, and the Parties did not believe that it was consistent with how juries would \n                                                \n5   Two objections were not filed with the Court as required by the Settlement Agreement and set \nforth in the Notice.  Exhibit C (Settlement Agreement at ยถ 14(r)); Exhibit H (Notice) at Question \n15 (โHow do I tell the Court I donโt like the Settlement?โ).  See also Exhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at \nExhibit 9 at 10-14) (Objections filed by Ronald Witt and David Kraybill).  Of these two \nobjections, David Kraybillโs objection was also untimely.  Rust Consulting received his objection \non February 4, 2011, and emailed it to Class Counsel only yesterday. \n  16\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 20 of 27 PageID #:15737\nassess damages.  Persons who were admitted into the jail on multiple occasions are likely \nto be less sympathetic than a person who was arrested only once, and thus likely to get \nlower damages.  In merely disclosing to the jury that he was strip searched during \nmultiple admissions, a plaintiff would risk lowering his overall award.   A claim for a \nsingle strip search may result in greater compensation than the total for multiple strip \nsearches.  Moreover, the experience at the bellwether trials demonstrated that jurors \nperceive additional strip searches to be far less injurious than a single strip search.  For all \nof these reasons a single payment sufficiently accommodates persons who were booked \nmultiple times, and is fair. \n  William Dujka and Ronald Witt object that the amount of the settlement is too \nlittle given the abuses that occurred during their strip searches.  Id. at Exhibit 9 at p. 6, \n10-12.  These are the only two individuals out of the entire quarter-million member Class \nmaking such an objection.  For the reasons explained throughout this Memorandum, the \namount of the settlement is fair both in terms of the gross payment to the Class and in \nterms of the per-class member distribution, and comports with other settlements approved \nas fair.  Moreover, the fact that a class settlement amount is below what a class member \nmight achieve by opting out and proceeding individually is to be expected, and does not \ndemonstrate that the consideration to the class is unfair.  Cf.  E.E.O.C. v. Hiram Walker \n& Sons, Inc., 768 F.2d 884, 889 (7th Cir. 1985) (โThe essence of settlement is \ncompromise.  Each side gains the benefit of immediate resolution of the litigation and \nsome measure of vindication for its position while foregoing the opportunity to achieve \nan unmitigated victory.โ) (citations omitted).  In addition, the substance of Mr. Wittโs \nobjection (which was not filed with the Court) relates to sexual injuries suffered as a \n  17\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 21 of 27 PageID #:15738\nresult of being subjected to a penal swab at the Jail, a particularly invasive procedure \nformerly part of the Jailโs intake process that was not encompassed by this strip search \nclass action.  See Exhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at Exhibit 9 at 12). \n  Antonio Claiborne objects that money damages are not a sufficient remedy as to \nhim and that the relief provided to him should be expungement of his criminal record or \nclemency.   Id. Exhibit 9 at pp. 7-9.  Expungement or clemency is not a remedy that was \navailable to the class and it is not a remedy for which the Defendants had the power to \nsettle.  That being said, nothing in this settlement precludes Class Members like Mr. \nClaiborne from seeking expungement of their records if they qualify to do so.6 \n  Finally, David Kraybill mailed an untimely objection to Rust, which he also failed \nto file with the Court, in which he (and he alone, out of the quarter-million Class \nmembers) objects to the attorneyโs fees portion of the Settlement Agreement.  Id. at \nExhibit 9 at pp. 13-14.  Assuming the Court is inclined to overlook the procedural \nshortcomings, the substance of his objection has been thoroughly addressed in Class \nCounselโs Petition for Attorneyโs Fees and Costs, which Counsel refers to and \nincorporates here.  Dkt. 637.7   In short, while he believes that Counsel should be \nโadequately compensated for taking a case like this to trial and for the expense and riskโ \ninvolved, he believes Counselโs fees should be lower than the fees we receive when we \nrepresented Plaintiffs on an individual basis. See Exhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at Exhibit 9) at \n                                                \n6   Class Counsel has frequently referred individuals, including Class Members in this action, to \nthe Expungement Desk at the Daley Center, which is staffed by volunteers from the Cabrini \nGreen Legal Aid Clinic, to assist individuals in processing the necessary forms to expunge their \nrecords.  See Exhibit F (Bala Keen Aff. at ยถ 5). \n \n7   Because this objection was not received until after Class Counsel had already filed their \nPetition for fees and costs, it was not specifically referenced or addressed therein, although, as \nstated in the text, Counsel stand on their arguments contained in the Petition. \n  18\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 22 of 27 PageID #:15739\n13.  For the reasons discussed extensively in Counselโs fee petition and the \naccompanying affidavits, the one-third fee provided for in the Settlement Agreement \naccurately reflects the market for and the high risk nature of this case.  Dkt. 637 at pp. 6-\n20.  In any event, the fee is in fact less than the 40% contingency that Counsel typically \nrequires to take a case of this nature on an individual basis. \n    4.  Class Counsel Supports This Settlement Agreement  \n  Class Counselโs firm is in an excellent position to evaluate the fairness of the \nsettlement based on more than a decade of hard-won experience representing civil rights \nplaintiffs.  As the Court saw from its supervision of the settlement process, Class Counsel \ntook a hard-line position in negotiations and kept fighting (all the way through trials and \nan appeal) until we were able to get a fund size which we felt was fair.  We rejected \noffers of $20 million (with a 40% contingency fee) and, later, of $40 million.  We also \ninsisted on obtaining an assignment of claims that, after much evaluation (including by \nhiring expensive coverage counsel), we believed the County was undervaluing.  Because \nthe Countyโs final settlement offer provides significant payments to class members (in \nline with many other class action settlement) without further delay or risk, while allowing \nthe Class to seek more, Counsel determined that settlement would provide the best \nbenefit for class members, and Counsel supports the settlement. \n5.  This Settlement Was Negotiated Only After Significant \nDiscovery And Litigation \n  As recounted in greater detail in Class Counselโs Petition for Attorneyโs Fees, \nCosts, and Class Member Incentive Bonuses (dkt. 637) the Settlement was obtained only \nafter completing discovery, conducting multiple trials and litigating an appeal.  There are \nmore than 600 entries on the docket.  Thus, this case is completely on the opposite end of \n  19\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 23 of 27 PageID #:15740\nthe spectrum from those which raise a red flag because they settled early in the game.  \nThere can be no serious contention that the Class should have litigated further before \nsettling.   \nB.  The Notice Provided To Class Members Meets Due Process \nThe purpose of a class notice is to provide interested parties notice of the \nsettlement, their right to object and exclude themselves, and enough information about \nthe terms of the settlement so that they can evaluate their options. See Phillips Petroleum \nCo. v. Shutts, 472 U.S.797, 812 (1985).  In this case, the Notice that was provided Class \nMembers met and surpassed the requirements of due process. \nAt the outset, the initial mailing sent to the last known address of 249,599 \nconfirmed and potential class members amply complied with constitutional minimums, \nbut Plaintiffs went to numerous additional efforts to find current addresses for as many \nindividuals as possible.  Plaintiffs also directed the claims administrator to research the \nlast known address for all individuals, utilizing LexisNexis and the United States Postal \nServiceโs NCOA address updating service, and then supplemented this information by \nobtaining parolee addresses from the Illinois Department of Corrections (โIDOCโ).  See \nExhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at ยถ 7-11); Exhibit F (Bala Keen Aff. at ยถ 7-9).  In addition, \nPlaintiffs obtained a list of all persons currently held in the IDOC and directed the Claims \nAdministrator to send notice to incarcerated class members at their IDOC addresses, \nincluding explicit instruction on the nuances of correctly marking the envelopes \naccording to the mail rules of each institution.  Id. at ยถ 11.  The direct notice provided to \nClass Members was certainly the โbest practicable, reasonably calculated under the \n  20\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 24 of 27 PageID #:15741\ncircumstances to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them \nan opportunity to present their objections.โ  Phillips Petroleum Co., 472 U.S. at 812 . \nThe Notice Plan also included published notice in the Sun Times, Chicago \nDefender, La Raza (selected to reach Spanish speaking class members) and Prison Legal \nNews (selected to reach incarcerated class members).  The Published Notice ran in each \nof the publications as a quarter-page ad located in the main body of the paper (not the \nclassified sections) in two print cycles.  Moreover, the Notice in the Prison Legal News \nincluded a printed Claim Form, enabling incarcerated individuals to submit a claim form \nwithout needing to rely on the prisonsโ mail systems, which tend to suffer from \nunexpected and potentially lengthy delays.  See Exhibit E (Niemiec Aff. at ยถ 18).  The \nNotice was also made available in Spanish and on a designated website.  Finally, the \nDefendant posted the Notice in the Cook County Jailโs RCDC, every division of the Jail, \nthe law library and in several common areas of the Jail.  See Exhibit F (Bala Keen Aff. at \nยถยถ 12-15).  The Parties endorsed the Notice Plan because it is the best practicable means \nto reach potential class members and would encourage a high rate of claim submissions.   \n  Finally, the high claims rate is good evidence of the effectiveness of the Notice.  \nThe Notice Plan achieved the goal of effectively reaching class members and \nencouraging them to submit claims.  The Notice provided individuals with all the \ninformation needed to reach an informed decision regarding their rights and the Proposed \nSettlement Agreement.  Both Parties agreed that the provided was the best practicable in \nconsideration of all the factors at issue for this class of individuals. \n \n \n  21\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 641 Filed: 02/22/11 Page 25 of 27 PageID #:15742\nC.  The Court Should Grant Final Certification of the Three Settlement \nClasses  \nEach of the two Proposed Settlement Classes meets the requirements for \ncertification upon settlement and the even more stringent requirements for certification as \na litigation class.  See April 25, 2007 Order; Dkt. 92.  First, the Settlement Classes meet \nthe four prerequisites of Rule 23(a) of numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy \nof representation.  The members of the Settlement Classes, 250,000 strong, are so \nnumerous that joinder is impracticable.  Likewise, the Settlement Classes satisfy Rule \n23(a)(2) because there are common factual and legal questions for the Class Memberโs \nclaims.  Id. at 8 (courts have repeatedly held that โclass actions challenging blanket strip \nsearch policies satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)โs commonality requirementโ) (citations omitted); see \nalso Rosario v. Livaditis, 963 F.2d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir. 1992) (โA common nucleus of \noperative fact is usually enough to satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule \n23(a)(2)โ).  The requirements of Rule 23(a)(3) are met because the claims or defenses of \nthe representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.  Finally, the \nrepresentative Class Members and Class Counsel adequately represent the interests of \nSettlement Class Members.  The Settlement Classes also meet the requirements for \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(3) because common questions predominate over questions \naffecting only individual members and class resolution is superior to individual lawsuits \nas this Court has already found in the litigation context.

KENNELLY, District Judge:\nPlaintiffs Kim Young, Ronald Johnson, and William Jones, on behalf of\nthemselves and two certified classes, have sued former Cook County Sheriff Michael\nSheahan and Sheriffโs employees Callie Baird, Scott Kurtovich, and Salvador Godinez\n(collectively the Sheriff Defendants), as well as Cook County, under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \nPlaintiffs allege violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights during the\ntime they were confined as pretrial detainees at the Cook County Jail (CCJ).  Cook\nCounty and the Sheriff Defendants have moved separately for summary judgment, and\nplaintiffs have moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.  \n1\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 2 of 37\nFacts\nOn cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court construes facts and draws\ninferences โin favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration is made.โ \nIn re United Air Lines, Inc., 453 F.3d 463, 469 (7th Cir. 2006).  \n1. CCJ and the defendants\nDuring the class period, CCJ housed, at any given time, approximately 10,000\npretrial detainees in ten residential divisions.  Women are housed in two of the\ndivisions, and men are housed in nine of them (one division houses both women and\nmen).  New detainees enter CCJ through the Receiving Classification and Diagnostic\nCenter (RCDC).  The RCDC contains separate areas for men and women.  Between\n250 and 350 detainees are booked into and out of CCJ daily, of which approximately\n300 detainees are men and thirty to forty are women.  \nMost of the detainees arriving at CCJ have already had a probable cause\nhearing before a judge.  Though defendants contend they do not know the nature of\ncharges pending against detainees when they arrive at the RCDC, the evidence they\ncite on this point does not support that contention.  Rather, the evidence shows that the\nRCDC staff has information identifying the specific offense(s) with which each detainee\nhas been charged, though a charge is not expressly classified as a felony or a\nmisdemeanor.  \nThe Sheriff Defendants were all high-ranking officials in the Sheriffโs office during\ntimes relevant to plaintiffsโ claims.  Sheahan was the Cook County Sheriff from\nDecember 1990 to December 2006.  As Sheriff, Sheahan was the custodian of CCJ\n2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 3 of 37\nunder Illinois law.  See 55 ILCS 5/3-6017.  Sheahan had policymaking authority over\nCCJ, including with regard to strip search policies.  \nBaird was the director of the Cook County Department of Corrections (CCDC)\nfrom July 2003 until November 2004.1  She was succeeded by Kurtovich, who served\nas director from November 2004 until June 2006.  In turn, Godinez followed Kurtovich\nas director of CCDC and continues to hold that position currently.  Baird, Kurtovich, and\nGodinez all had policymaking authority over intake strip searches at CCJ during their\nrespective tenures as directors of CCDC.  This responsibility included ensuring CCJโs\npolicies concerning intake strip searches complied with federal and state law.  \n2. Procedures and strip searches at CCJ\nAll new detainees entering CCJ are visually strip searched for the purpose of\nfinding contraband.  The search involves a visual inspection of the detaineeโs naked\nbody, including his or her body cavities.  Most detainees arriving at the RCDC enter\nCCJโs general population, regardless of the type of charge they are facing.  \nDefendants have submitted over 2000 pages of contraband reports, spanning\nseveral years, that they contend show a pervasive problem of detainees attempting to\nbring contraband into CCJ.  Contraband, as defined in a jail setting, includes paper\nmoney, loose change, and cigarettes, as well as weapons and drugs.  The majority of\nthese 2000-plus pages of reports appear to deal with contraband that is not inherently\ndangerous, such as money.  \nDefendants contend that weapons and drugs have been โroutinelyโ found in\n1Witnesses used the terms โdirectorโ and โexecutive directorโ of CCDC\ninterchangeably in their depositions.  Both terms refer to the same position.  \n3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 4 of 37\npossession of detainees arriving at the RCDC.  Sheriff Defendantsโ Local Rule 56.1\nStatement ยถ 26.  Defendants do not, however, cite to any evidence supporting their\nclaim that these items are โroutinelyโ found.  Rather, they cite general testimony about\nthe types of contraband found over the years and refer to the 2000 pages of\ncontraband reports as a group without providing detail regarding how many of those\nreports concern drugs, weapons, or other dangerous items.  As plaintiffs correctly point\nout, however, it is not the Courtโs responsibility to go hunting through a record of this\nsize unguided to try to find a factual dispute.  Rather, it is the partiesโ obligation to draw\nthe Courtโs attention to evidence they contend is relevant.  See, e.g., Roger Whitmoreโs\nAuto Serv., Inc. v. Lake County, 424 F.3d 659, 664 n.2 (7th Cir. 2005); Ogdon v. Hoyt,\n409 F. Supp. 2d 982, 986-87 (N.D. Ill. 2006).  Defendants have not satisfied this\nobligation by their general citation to the mass of contraband reports.  \nSimilarly, the Sheriff Defendants contend that โ[b]ased on the contraband report,\nmisdemeanants were just as likely to carry contraband as detainees charged with more\nserious crimes.โ  Sheriff Defendantsโ Local Rule 56.1 Statement ยถ 28.  To support this\ncontention they cite the testimony of their expert witness and contraband reports as a\nwhole.  The citation to defendantsโ expert does not support that statement.  Defendantsโ\nexpert testified that he considered the contraband reports as part of his opinion but did\nnot indicate how many, if any, of those reports involved detainees charged with\nmisdemeanors.  And, as noted above, defendantsโ blanket citation to the 2000 pages of\nreports likewise does not properly support their contentions.  In their briefs, defendants\ncite five specific examples from the reports of detainees allegedly charged with\nmisdemeanors having been found with contraband, including weapons or drugs.  See\n4\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 5 of 37\nSheriff Defendantsโ Reply in Supp. of their Mot. for Summ. J. Based on Constitutionality\nof Search Policies at 4 (citing Sheriff Defendantsโ Local Rule 56.1 Statement Ex. 10 at\nQH 384, 421, 423, 461); Sheriff Defendantsโ Mem. in Supp. of their Mot. for Summ. J.\nBased on Qualified Immunity at 4 (citing Sheriff Defendantsโ Local Rule 56.1 Statement\nEx. 10 at QH 470).  They do not, however, provide any basis to support their contention\nthat these events occur โroutinely.โ  Sheriff Defendantsโ Local Rule 56.1 Statement ยถ\n26.  Moreover, as discussed below, the evidence does not support defendantsโ\ncontentions regarding the five suggested examples.  \nIn addition, defendants have provided no information regarding how many of the\n2000-plus contraband reports involve detainees charged with non-weapon, non-drug\nmisdemeanors, much less how many such detainees were found to possess weapons\nor drugs.  Plaintiffs correctly point out that the contraband reports do not always indicate\nwhether the contraband was found in a detaineeโs body pursuant to a strip search or\nwas instead found in a detaineeโs clothes (e.g., loose change in a pocket).  The\ndifference is significant; a strip search would not be needed to find items in pockets.  \nThe searches conducted during the class period involved having detainees strip\nnaked, bend over, and spread their buttocks, or by having the detainees squat and\ncough multiple times.  Strip searches were conducted without regard to the seriousness\nof the charges against an individual detainee and without individualized reasonable\nsuspicion that a strip search was necessary.  Defendants contend that the seriousness\nof the charges against any given detainee had been considered by a judge at bond\ncourt prior to the commitment of the detainee to CCJ.  Though true, this does not\ncontradict plaintiffsโ contention that new detainees were strip searched at CCJ\n5\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 6 of 37\nregardless of the level or the nature of the offense charged.  As a result, a detainee\nwho (for example) was unable to make bail on a misdemeanor charge was strip\nsearched.  \nNew female detainees arriving at CCJ ordinarily were not strip searched at the\nRCDC.  Rather, they were searched with a body scanning machine at the RCDC and\nwere later strip searched upon arrival at the residential division to which they were\nassigned.  The women were strip searched in open-faced cubicles, a space similar to\nthat provided by a privacy screen in a doctorsโ office, with dimensions of approximately\nfive feet by five feet.  Each cubicle contained a chair for the womenโs clothes, and the\ndetainees could not see individuals in other cubicles.  Throughout the class period, the\nsquat-and-cough method was used for female detainees, not the bend-and-spread\nmethod.  \nThe search procedures differed for male detainees.  They were strip searched\nboth at the RCDC and a second time upon arrival at a housing division.  The strip\nsearches at the RCDC were conducted using the bend-and-spread method until\napproximately February 2006.  Since then, male detainees at the RCDC have been\nsearched using the squat-and-cough method.  Despite defendantsโ contentions to the\ncontrary, the Rule 30(b)(6) witness for CCDC indisputably testified that he was not\naware of any justification for using the bend-and-spread method for the men as\nopposed to the squat-and-cough method prior to February 2006.  He also\nacknowledged that the squat-and-cough method is a more dignified way to conduct a\nsearch.  The squat-and-cough method is as effective in conducting searches as the\nbend-and-spread method, and CCJ has not experienced any problems due to the\n6\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 7 of 37\nchange in methodology.  \nAt the RCDC, male detainees were lined up in a hallway for their strip search.  At\ntimes, detainees would cover the entire length of the hallway wall.  Plaintiffs allege that\nthe RCDC staff did not conduct searches until the holding bullpen was full, but\ndefendants have presented evidence that searches sometimes take place before the\nbullpen was full.  Defendants admit that guards took groups of seventy-five men for\nstrip searches in the hallway, but they note that the last group searched at night was\ntypically smaller.  Plaintiffs present evidence that strip searches were occasionally\nconducted in a group of over 100 detainees at the same time, though defendants\ndispute that more than seventy-five detainees were ever searched at a time.  CCDCโs\nRule 30(b)(6) witness could not rule out the possibility, however, that more than eighty\ndetainees were sometimes searched in a single group at the RCDC.  \nThe RCDC hallway where male detainees were strip searched in groups did not\ncontain any privacy screens before January 31, 2007.  Defendantsโ expert, Norman\nCarlson, is unaware of any other jails that have conducted group strip searches without\nprivacy dividers in the last twenty years.  When his deposition was taken in November\n2006, CCDCโs Rule 30(b)(6) witness stated that he was unaware whether CCDC had\never investigated the possibility or cost of installing privacy dividers in the hallway where\nmen were strip searched at the RCDC.  In or around February 2007, privacy screens\nwere installed in the hallway where groups of men are strip searched at the RCDC.2 \n2Defendants argue that evidence regarding the privacy screens is inadmissible\nas a subsequent remedial measure.  Federal Rule of Evidence 407 โdoes not require\nthe exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered  [to demonstrate]\n(continued...)\n7\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 8 of 37\nThe screens were spaced approximately four feet apart, and the hallway was large\nenough to accommodate thirty-seven stalls.  Since the stalls were installed, the number\nof men searched at one time has been limited to the number of available stalls. \nDefendants dispute this is the case, but the evidence they cite does not support their\ncontention.  Sometime after January 2007, a body scanning machine was also installed\nin the male section at the RCDC.  The parties dispute how long it takes the machine\nused on the male side of the RCDC to complete a scan.  \nPlaintiffs and defendants both compare defendantsโ policies to those used by the\nfederal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  Defendants concede that BOPโs procedures for strip\nsearches of incoming detainees are reasonable under the circumstances facing BOP. \nBy 1987, all BOP facilities had privacy screens for all detainees undergoing strip\nsearches.  Defendantsโ expert witness is unaware of any jurisdictions other than Cook\nCounty that conduct strip searches of all detainees charged with misdemeanors without\ngiving them the option to avoid a strip search by remaining outside of the jailโs general\npopulation.  \n3. Plaintiffsโ claims\nPlaintiff Jones is a fifty-two year-old man.  He was taken to CCJ after failing to\ncomply with a condition of his bond for a misdemeanor traffic violation.  During his\nintake at CCJ, Jones was strip searched with a group of fifty other men.  Jones claims\n2(...continued)\nfeasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted . . . .โ  Fed. R. Evid. 407. \nDefendants argue that use of privacy dividers and body scanning machines were and\nare not always feasible for a number of reasons.  The Court has considered evidence of\nsubsequent measures taken by defendants only to the extent it bears on these\nfeasibility issues, which the Court addresses further in the discussion below.  \n8\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 9 of 37\nthat during the search, he and the other men were lined up shoulder-to-shoulder and\nwere required to bend over with their buttocks spread apart while a guard walked up\nand down the line.  Defendants deny that the men in the group strip search would have\ntouched each other and claim they would have been at least six inches apart based on\nthe practice at CCJ.  After posting bond later that same night, Jones was released from\ncustody.  \nPlaintiff Johnson is a forty-four year-old man.  He was arrested for felony\npossession of a controlled substance.  Johnson alleges he was falsely arrested.  He\nwas taken to CCJ and strip searched in a hallway, allegedly with 100 other men. \nJohnson claims the search was so crowded that the naked men were touching each\nother.  Defendants cite Johnsonโs deposition testimony to contend that the prisoners\nduring the search were not touching each other.  This takes Johnsonโs testimony out of\ncontext.  When read in its entirety, it is clear that Johnson only denied that someone\nreached out and affirmatively tried to touch him.  See Sheriff Defendantsโ Resp. to Pls.โ\n56.1 Statement Ex. 4 at 59-64.  He unequivocally stated the crowding of the search\nresulted in poisoners touching each other:  โQ. Nobody touched you or nobody touched\nyou in the way that you were offended by?  A. Offended by.  I mean it was so crowded,\nI was touched but it wasnโt done offensively.โ  Id. at 59:23-60:2.  \nPlaintiff Young is a forty-seven year-old woman.  She was arrested for failure to\nappear in court on a misdemeanor traffic violation and was taken to CCJ.  While waiting\nfor delivery of $200 for her bond, Young was subjected to an intake strip search. \nOn April 25, 2007, the Court, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23,\ncertified two classes of plaintiffs.  Class I consists of โall males who were subjected to a\n9\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 10 of 37\nstrip search and/or a visual body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook County\nJail on or after January 30, 2004.โ  Dkt. No. 92 at 16.  Jones and Johnson are the class\nrepresentatives for Class I.  Class II consists of โall persons charged only with\nmisdemeanor or lesser offenses not involving drugs or weapons who were subjected to\na strip search and/or a visual body cavity search as new detainees at the Cook County\nJail on or after January 30, 2004.โ  Id.  Jones and Young are the class representatives\nfor Class II.3  \nIn addition to information about the class representatives, plaintiffs have\nsubmitted sworn declarations from over 500 men, selected randomly, who were strip\nsearched at the RCDC during the class period.  Defendants dispute the factual content\nof these declarations based on testimony regarding the general experiences of CCJ\nofficials and employees, but not based on first-hand knowledge concerning the specific\nallegations contained in the declarations.  Cook County also repeatedly contends that\nnone of the affidavits are trustworthy, but it has submitted no evidence in support of that\ncontention.  \nOne RCDC employee testified that detainees have about six inches of space\nbetween each other during the strip searches.  In nearly ninety percent of the\ndeclarations submitted by plaintiffs, the declarants claimed that the strip searches at the\nRCDC were so crowded that detainees made physical contact with one or more other\n3Cook County contends that Jones and Young were not arrested on\nmisdemeanors and cannot represent Class II.  The Court rejected that argument in\ngranting the motion for class certification.  Young v. County of Cook, No. 06 C 552,\n2007 WL 1238920, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 25, 2007).  Cook County has presented no new\nevidence that would call for reconsideration of the previous ruling.  \n10\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 11 of 37\ndetainees.  Most declarants also reported being able to see other detaineesโ naked\nbodies.  Cook County contends that the detainees do not see each other because they\nare ordered to face the wall or look at the floor.  \nThough not necessarily experienced by the class representatives, many of the\ndeclarations submitted by plaintiffs detail additional problems during the group strip\nsearches at the RCDC.4  Many of the declarants complained of strong, foul odors\nduring the strip searches.  The declarants also claim that bodily fluids were often\npresent during the male group strip searches.  Defendants dispute how often such\nfluids โ including vomit, diarrhea, and blood โ were actually present during searches. \nOver 400 of plaintiffsโ declarants also claim that the guards used insults or abusive\nlanguage during strip searches.  These included insults about body odor, anatomy,\nsexual orientation, and race.  On occasion, entire groups would be required to repeat\nthe strip search, or portions of it, after one detainee made a mistake during the process. \nPlaintiffs contend that dogs were used to threaten, frighten, and intimidate detainees\nduring strip searches and that at times the dogs were not muzzled or leashed. \nDefendants deny these contentions and claim that dogs were only used occasionally in\nthe search area.  \nPlaintiffs also claim that the Sheriff Defendants never looked into how often\n4To dispute most of the allegations made by the declarants, defendants rely only\non the deposition testimony of the class representatives โ specifically, the absence of\ntestimony by the class representatives regarding similar allegations.  Unless they\ndenied observing those conditions, the fact that the class representatives did not testify\nabout them does not mean they did not experience or observe them; rather, it reflects\nonly that defendantsโ counsel did not ask questions about them during the depositions. \nMoreover, the fact that a class representative did not experience a particular adverse\ncondition at the RCDC is not evidence that the same was true of the declarants.  \n11\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 12 of 37\nindividuals accused of misdemeanors brought contraband items to CCJ.  Defendants\ndispute this, citing generally to exhibit 10 to the Sheriff Defendantsโ Local Rule 56.1\nstatement.  As noted above, defendantsโ submissions provide minimal detail about\nthese 2000-plus pages of reports.  The reports do not indicate whether the detainees\nidentified in them were charged with misdemeanors or felonies.  Moreover, defendants\ncite no evidence indicating that CCJ officials considered these reports or other similar\ninformation before adopting the blanket strip search policy for all detainees, including\nthose charged with misdemeanors.  Indeed, many of the contraband reports are from a\nperiod long after the strip search policy had been implemented.  CCDCโs Rule 30(b)(6)\nwitness testified that he could not recall a specific instance of a strip search of a\ndetainee charged with a non-drug, non-weapons misdemeanor that resulted in the\ndiscovery of drugs or weapons.  \nDiscussion\nSummary judgment is appropriate if โthe pleadings, depositions, answers to\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  To determine whether a genuine\nissue of material fact exists, the Court must view the record in the light most favorable\nto the nonmoving party and draw reasonable inferences in that partyโs favor.  Anderson\nv. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Lesch v. Crown Cork & Seal Co., 282 F.3d\n467, 471 (7th Cir. 2002).  A genuine issue of triable fact exists only if โthe evidence is\nsuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.โ  Anderson,\n12\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 13 of 37\n477 U.S. at 248.  โThe fact that plaintiff and defendants have filed cross-motions for\nsummary judgment does not change the applicable standard.  The Court must consider\neach motion independently and must deny both motions if there is a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact.โ  Egan Marine Corp. v. Great Am. Ins. Co. of N.Y., 531 F. Supp. 2d 949,\n953 (N.D. Ill. 2007) (citations omitted).  \n1. Motion to strike plaintiffsโ Local Rule 56.1 statement\nThe Sheriff Defendants have moved to strike plaintiffsโ Local Rule 56.1\nstatement and ask the Court to deny plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment due to\ntheir alleged failure to comply with the local rule.  They first take issue with paragraphs\n1-8, 16-28, and 126-29 of plaintiffsโ statement on the ground that the facts contained in\nthose paragraphs are immaterial.  The Sheriff Defendantsโ only explanation regarding\nimmateriality is that plaintiffs do not cite these paragraphs in their summary judgment\nbrief.  Nothing in the local rule, however, requires a summary judgment movant to cite\nto each paragraph of its statement of facts in its motion or brief.  Moreover, the\nparagraphs the Sheriff Defendants seek to strike clearly contain material facts\nconcerning the plaintiffs, their claims, and the defendantsโ procedures and policies โ\nfacts that are so fundamental that they form the basis of the partiesโ dispute.  \nThe Court denies the motion to strike with respect to paragraphs 1-8, 16-28, and\n126-29.  The Court grants the motion with respect to paragraph 77 because it is\nimmaterial for present purposes.  In that paragraph, plaintiffs note that defendantsโ\nexpert witness was the main defendant in the seminal Supreme Court case of Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).  \n13\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 14 of 37\nNext, the Sheriff Defendants contend that a number of paragraphs in plaintiffsโ\nstatement do not comply with Local Rule 56.1 because they contain multiple factual\nassertions or multiple sentences and are overly descriptive of the evidence cited for\nsupport.  To the extent these are technical violations of Local Rule 56.1 โ it is not clear\nthat they are โ the Court, in its discretion, chooses to excuse them.  See Little v. Coxโs\nSupermarkets, 71 F.3d 637, 641 (7th Cir. 1995) (noting that district courts have\ndiscretion to overlook failure to comply strictly with local rules regarding summary\njudgment).  The Court also notes that defendants have not complied with Local Rule\n56.1 in every paragraph of their factual statements.  The Court has chosen to consider\nall proper evidence submitted by each of the parties, regardless of whether it was\npresented in strict compliance with Local Rule 56.1.  \nThe Sheriff Defendants also contend that paragraphs 43-54 of plaintiffsโ factual\nstatement are inadmissible hearsay.  Those paragraphs report statements made in\narticles that appeared in the Chicago Tribune.  Plaintiffs counter that the articles are not\nhearsay because they are only submitted for purposes of demonstrating that\ndefendants were on notice regarding claims about the conditions at CCJ โ an issue that\ndoes not appear to be seriously disputed.  The Court declines to strike paragraphs 43-\n54 but has not considered those paragraphs for purposes of this motion.  \nLast, the Sheriff Defendants challenge plaintiffsโ submission of affidavits by class\nmembers regarding conditions at CCJ and, specifically, their experiences during strip\nsearches.  The Sheriff Defendants claim it is inappropriate for the Court to consider\nthese affidavits because none of them were submitted by detainees who were\nprocessed and searched at the exact same time as the class representatives. \n14\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 15 of 37\nDefendants have not, however, cited any authority to support their contention, and their\nargument makes no sense:  the claims of the class concern defendantsโ practices over\nan extended period.  In any event, the Seventh Circuit and other judges in this district\nhave considered similar affidavits, without commenting on the propriety of doing so. \nSee, e.g., Little v. Walker, 522 F.2d 193, 194 (7th Cir. 1977) (considering affidavits of\nputative class members regarding attacks in Illinois prisons on review of order\ndismissing complaint); Bullock v. Sheahan, 568 F. Supp. 2d 965, 975 (N.D. Ill. 2008)\n(considering affidavits submitted by class members regarding manner and conditions of\nstrip searches in support of summary judgment motion); Doe v. Calumet City, 754 F.\nSupp. 1211, 1213-15 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (same).  It is appropriate to consider the affidavits\nof class members submitted in support of plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment to the\nextent those affidavits contain admissible evidence.  The Court denies the Sheriff\nDefendantsโ motion to strike these affidavits. \n2. Class II plaintiffs\nPlaintiffs and defendants both contend they are entitled to summary judgment\nwith respect to the claims of the Class II plaintiffs โ detainees charged with\nmisdemeanor offenses not involving drugs or weapons who were strip searched,\nincluding a visual body cavity search, upon intake into CCJ.  Defendants admit that all\ndetainees entering CCJ, including those in Class II, are strip searched.  It is also\nundisputed that these searches were conducted without making individualized\nreasonable suspicion determinations.  \nPretrial detainees retain their constitutional rights, including the protections of the\n15\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 16 of 37\nFourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Bell, 441 U.S. at\n545; Thompson v. County of Cook, 412 F. Supp. 2d 881, 888-89 (N.D. Ill. 2005).  Those\nrights, however, are limited due to the realities of confinement, most importantly the\nneed to maintain security and order in jails and prisons.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 545-46\n(โThere must be mutual accommodation between institutional needs and objectives and\nthe provisions of the Constitution that are of general application.โ) (internal quotation\nomitted).  Plaintiffsโ claims must be evaluated in this light, giving deference to the\nexpertise of jail and prison officials.  Id. at 546-48.  In this regard, the Supreme Court\nprescribed a balancing test:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable\nof precise definition or mechanical application.  In each case, it requires a\nbalancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\npersonal rights that the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.  \nId. at 559.  In Bell, the Supreme Court determined that strip and body cavity searches\nof pretrial detainees that had engaged in contact visits with visitors from outside the jail\ncomplied with constitutional standards.  Id. at 558.  \nThe Seventh Circuit has stated that โthe balancing test prescribed in [Bell] does\nnot validate strip searches in detention settings per se.โ  Mary Beth G. v. City of\nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983).  There are โfew exercises of authority by\nthe state that intrude on the citizenโs privacy and dignity as severely asโ visual body\ncavity and strip searches.  Id. (citing authority describing strip searches as โdemeaning,\ndehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive,\nsignifying degradation and submissionโ).  โThe more intrusive the search, the closer\n16\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 17 of 37\ngovernmental authorities must come to demonstrating probable cause for believing that\nthe search will uncover the object for which the search is being conducted.โ  Id. at 1273\n(citing Terry v. Ohio, 293 U.S. 1, 18 n.15 (1968)).  \nIn Mary Beth G., the plaintiffs claimed that their Fourth Amendment rights were\nviolated by a City of Chicago policy to strip search all female detainees placed in\nChicago Police Department detention facilities, without individualized suspicion for\nconducting the searches.  Id. at 1267-68, 1273.  The plaintiffs had been charged with\nmisdemeanors and were being detained until they could make bond.  Id. at 1272.  The\ncity attempted to justify the strip search policy based on security concerns.  Id. at 1272-\n73.  There was not, however, evidence that the women being strip searched posed\nserious security risks.  Accordingly, the Seventh Circuit held the searches โbore an\ninsubstantial relationship to security needs so that, when balanced against . . . privacy\ninterests, the searches cannot be considered โreasonable.โโ  Id. at 1273.  \nFollowing Bell, courts of appeal have generally ruled that a detainee held on a\nmisdemeanor charge not related to weapons or drugs may not be strip searched absent\nindividualized reasonable suspicion that he or she is carrying such contraband.  See,\ne.g., Id. at 1273; Roberts v. State, 239 F.3d 107, 112 (1st Cir. 2001); Shain v.\nEllison, 273 F.3d 56, 62-66 (2d Cir. 2001); Amaechi v. West, 237 F.3d 356, 364-65 (4th\nCir. 2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395-96 (10th Cir. 1993); Maters v.\nCrouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253-54, 1257 (6th Cir. 1989); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d\n739, 741-42 (8th Cir. 1985);  Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir.\n17\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 18 of 37\n1985).5  The crux of these cases is that given the extreme intrusion into personal\nprivacy that a strip search or body cavity search entails, people charged with minor\noffenses that do not involve drugs or weapons are not subject to such searches absent\nindividualized reasonable suspicion.  \nA number of courts in this district, including this one, have come to the same\nconclusion.  See Bullock, 568 F. Supp. 2d at 974-76 (granting summary judgment for\nplaintiffs on claim that policy of strip searching all detainees reentering CCJ while\nwaiting to be discharged after a court appearance violated Fourth Amendment);\nThompson v. County of Cook, 428 F. Supp. 2d 807, 812-15 (N.D. Ill. 2006); Calvin v.\nSheriff of Will County, 405 F. Supp. 2d 933, 938-45 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (blanket policy of\nstrip searching detainees arrested for failure to appear in court for misdemeanor and\ntraffic violation cases violated Fourth Amendment); Gary v. Sheahan, No. 06 C 7294,\n1998 WL 547116, at *10-13 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 20, 1998) (policy of strip searching female\ninmates following judicial determination that they must be released from custody\nviolated Fourth Amendment); Doe v. Calumet City, 754 F. Supp. at 1220-21 (same).  \nDefendants challenge the continuing validity of Mary Beth G. and similar cases,\nrelying on the Eleventh Circuitโs decision in Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.\n2008) (en banc).  In Powell, the Eleventh Circuit, acknowledging Mary Beth G. and\nother cases, held that there is no need, when evaluating a Fourth Amendment\n5The Ninth Circuit has gone even further, finding unconstitutional a police\ndepartment policy of strip searching all detainees charged with a felony without any\nanalysis of individualized suspicion.  See Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Depโt, 901\nF.2d 702, 716 (9th Cir. 1990), overruled in part on other grounds, Hunter v. Bryant, 502\nU.S. 224 (1991).  Plaintiffs do not argue for such a broad rule in this case.  \n18\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 19 of 37\nchallenge to strip searches of detainees, to consider whether the detainees have been\narrested for misdemeanors or for more serious crimes.  Id. at 1309-10.  This Court,\neven if it were so inclined, has no authority to disregard Mary Beth G. โ even though the\nEleventh Circuit believes that case was decided incorrectly.  \nDefendants focus on the need to maintain security at CCJ, especially with\nrespect to the prevention of violence, as a justification for strip searching the Class II\nplaintiffs.  As noted above, this is an important concern at a facility like CCJ, one that\ncan justify strip searches of detainees.  The problem with defendantsโ contention in this\ncase, however, is that they have not provided an evidentiary basis from which any\nreasonable jury could find the searches of Class II plaintiffs were reasonable, either\nwith respect to misdemeanor detainees in general or each individual detainee, under\nthe balancing test established in Bell and Mary Beth G.  \nCourts have generally required jail officials to have either individualized suspicion\nor suspicion arising from the nature of the charged offense before conducting a strip\nsearch of a detainee charged with a misdemeanor that does not involve drugs or\nweapons.  See, e.g., Shain, 273 F.3d at 63; Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112 (requiring โa\nreasonable suspicion that the individual inmate is concealing contrabandโ); Masters v.\nCrouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1254 (6th Cir. 1989) (analysis of validity of strip search\njustification requires โconsideration of the nature of the offense and the question of\nwhether there is any reasonable basis for concern that the particular detainee will\nattempt to introduce weapons or other contrabandโ); Stewart, 767 F.2d at 156-57 (strip\nsearches of โminor offenders awaiting bond when no reasonable suspicion existed that\n19\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 20 of 37\nthey as a category of offenders or individually might possess weapons or contrabandโ\nviolated Fourth Amendment); Bullock, 568 F. Supp. 2d at 975 (requiring โindividualized\nreasonable suspicionโ); Thompson, 412 F. Supp. 2d at 890.  Defendants have not\npresented any evidence that reasonable suspicion existed to strip search either\nmembers of Class II in general or class representatives Young and Jones specifically. \nNor have defendants attempted to present evidence that individualized suspicion\nexisted to conduct a strip search of any particular member of Class II.  \nLacking any evidence of individualized suspicion of the Class II representatives\nor the members of Class II, defendants raise several additional arguments as to why\nsecurity concerns at CCJ necessitate the blank strip search policy.  In particular,\ndefendants cite to the 2000-plus pages of contraband reports to support their argument\nthat security at CCJ requires strip searching all detainees charged with misdemeanors\nthat do not involve weapons or drugs.  Those reports, however, would not enable a\nreasonable jury to reach that conclusion.  First, many, if not most, of the reports indicate\nthat the contraband found was money, not drugs or weapons that could lead to violence\nat CCJ.  Though CCJ has an interest in preventing detainees from bringing into the jail\nnon-dangerous contraband, such as money or cigarettes, that type of contraband does\nnot pose the same security risk so as to justify highly intrusive strip searches of\nmisdemeanor detainees absent individualized reasonable suspicion.  \nSecond, the reports do not indicate the nature of the charges against the\ndetainees who possessed contraband.  Thus there is no evidence that members of\nClass II or misdemeanor detainees โ a subset of all CCJ detainees โ routinely\npossessed contraband.  The Sheriff Defendants cite specifically to only five of the\n20\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 21 of 37\ncontraband reports in their briefs as specific evidence that misdemeanor detainees\npossessed drugs or weapons.  The reports they cite, however, do not indicate the\nnature of the charges against the detainees in question.  Without evidence of the nature\nof those charges, there is no basis upon which a jury reasonably could find that security\nconcerns justify conducting extremely invasive searches of all Class II members. \nThough a history of security and violence issues might, along with other considerations,\njustify a blanket strip search policy, defendants have not presented any evidence that\nwould justify such a policy with respect to misdemeanor detainees.  \nFinally, the reports do not always indicate whether the contraband was\ndiscovered as result of a strip search or instead was found in a detaineeโs clothing or\nwillingly surrendered.  In the five reports cited in the Sheriff Defendantsโ briefs, two of\nthem involved finding contraband in pockets or shoes, and in one instance, the\ndetainee voluntarily handed the contraband to officers.  One report does not state\nwhether the contraband was found in the detaineeโs body cavities or clothes.  Only one\nof those five reports involved contraband discovered during a squat-and-cough visual\nbody cavity search.  This is insufficient, as a matter of law, to justify highly intrusive strip\nsearches of detainees charged with minor offenses without individualized reasonable\nsuspicion that they possess contraband or pose a security risk.  Roberts, 239 F.3d at\n112 (โThe lack of specific instances where a body cavity search was necessary to\ndiscover contraband supports a finding that the policy of searching all inmates is an\nunreasonable one.โ); Calvin, 405 F. Supp. 2d at 944.  \nDefendants also argue that strip searches of the persons in Class II are justified\nbecause members of that class were admitted to the general population at CCJ, where\n21\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 22 of 37\nthey would come into contact with detainees facing more serious charges and might be\nattempting to smuggle contraband to them.  Though the Supreme Court in Bell\nrecognized the security risk posed by detainees that could attempt to smuggle\ndangerous contraband into jail following a contact visit, Bell, 441 U.S. at 558-60, the\nClass II plaintiffs present a different situation.  Unlike detainees returning from contact\nvisits who may have planned to use such a visit in an effort to obtain contraband and\nhide it in a body cavity, there is no basis to think the Class II plaintiffs knew they were\nabout to be arrested, depriving them of the opportunity to hide something in their\nbodies.  See Shain, 273 F.3d at 63; Thompson, 412 F. Supp. 2d at 890.  The\nunexpected nature of the detaineesโ arrest also undermines any deterrence argument,\ncontrary to the situation with the plaintiffs in Bell, who could have used scheduled\ncontact visits as an opportunity to attempt to smuggle contraband.  Shain, 273 F.3d at\n63.  \nSecond, though intermingling with general prisoners may be one factor in\nevaluating the reasonableness of a strip search policy, that fact standing alone is not\nenough to justify strip searches in the absence of individualized reasonable suspicion. \nSee Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 396 (10th Cir. 1993); Masters, 872 F.2d at\n1254; Calvin, 405 F. Supp. 2d at 943.6  It is telling that defendantsโ own expert testified\nthat he is not aware of any jail that conducts strip searches of all detainees charged\n6One ruling in this district implies that strip searches may be reasonable where\nthe detainee will intermingle with the general jail population.  See Roscom v. City of\nChicago, 570 F. Supp 1259, 1262 (N.D. Ill. 1983).  That case did not address the issue\nat great length or consider whether prisoner mingling renders strip searches reasonable\nper se.  Moreover, Roscom was decided before the Seventh Circuitโs ruling in Mary\nBeth G., which does not prescribe such a rule.  \n22\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 23 of 37\nonly with misdemeanors without giving those detainees the option to remain outside of\nthe jailโs general population.  \nMoreover, courts have noted that a general policy to place detainees charged\nwith minor offenses in the general jail population along with persons charged with more\nserious crimes does not justify a blanket strip search policy.  See Roberts, 239 F.3d at\n112-13; Chapman, 989 F.2d at 396; Calvin, 405 F. Supp. 2d at 944-45 (holding that\nโadministrative concerns such as โspace constraintsโ are not sufficient to justify blanket\nstrip search policiesโ).  The Court finds the reasoning of those cases persuasive in light\nof past rulings by the Supreme Court and the Seventh Circuit.  As discussed above,\nBell and Mary Beth G. require this Court to balance CCJโs interests against the severity\nof the searches that were conduced on members of Class II.  Defendants have not\noffered an explanation or any evidence as to why all misdemeanor detainees must be\nheld in CCJโs general population.  Instead, they rely on their general contentions about\njail security, exactly the kind of reasoning the courts cited above found insufficient to\njustify blanket strip search policies for misdemeanor detainees.  After balancing the\ninterests in this case, the Court is persuaded that the CCJโs choice of a policy that\npermits misdemeanor detainees to have contact with detainees charged with more\nserious offenses does not come close to outweighing the serious infringement on a\nmisdemeanor detaineeโs Fourth Amendment rights that occurs when a strip search is\nconducted.7  No reasonable jury could reach the opposite conclusion.  \n7The Court also notes that Illinois law (though it does not affect plaintiffsโ\nconstitutional claims) requires, whenever possible, that detainees charged with minor\noffenses be housed separately from those charged with felonies.  See 20 Ill. Admin.\n(continued...)\n23\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 24 of 37\nIf CCDC officials suspect a particular detainee may be attempting to smuggle\ncontraband into the jailโs general population (e.g., based on criminal history), they may\nhave reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip and body cavity search of that detainee. \nSee Calvin, 405 F. Supp. 2d at 944.  But the possibility that this could occur in a given\ncase does not justify conducting such searches against all detainees charged with\nmisdemeanors that do not involve weapons or drugs.  \nFinally, defendants argue that the strip search procedure at CCJ is justified\nbecause a judge has already found probable cause that an offense has been\ncommitted by a detainee.  The First Circuit found this was not a compelling reason that\nwould justify a strip search of a detainee being held on a minor traffic violation. \nRoberts, 239 F.3d at 111.  The Court agrees with the First Circuit.  The existence of\nprobable cause that a detainee committed a misdemeanor, by itself, has nothing to do\nwith whether that detainee might have contraband on him or might attempt to smuggle\ncontraband into CCJ.  Defendants offer no explanation why a finding of probable cause\nthat an individual has committed a misdemeanor unrelated to drugs or weapons\nprovides any basis for conducting a highly intrusive strip or body cavity search of that\ndetainee.  \nIn light of Mary Beth G. and numerous similar rulings in other cases, the strip\nsearches of all detainees held on misdemeanor or lesser charges not involving drugs or\nweapons, without individualized reasonable suspicion, violated their Fourth Amendment\nrights as a matter of law.  No reasonable jury could find otherwise.  As one judge in this\n7(...continued)\nCode ยง 701.70(b)(4).  \n24\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 25 of 37\ndistrict summarized:  \nThe facts in cases where searches have been upheld suggest some\nreasonable cause on the part of the authorities to suspect that the\ndetainees might be trying to smuggle weapons or contraband into the jail. \nSuch cause may be furnished by the nature of the offense or the nature of\nthe offender.  \nSimenc v. Sheriff of DuPage County, No. 82 C 4778, 1985 WL 4896, at *3 (N.D. Ill.\nDec. 9, 1985).  Defendants have not presented any evidence that blanket strip\nsearches are necessary with respect to the members of Class II generally.  Nor have\nthey presented evidence of individualized suspicion of the class representatives or\nother members of Class II to justify the strip searches.  Weighing the nature of the\nsearches at issue against the justifications and evidence provided by defendants, no\nreasonable jury could find defendantsโ policies with respect to the Class II plaintiffs\ncomplied with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.  Accordingly, the Class II\nplaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on their Fourth Amendment claims.  \n3. Class I plaintiffs\nClass I includes โall males who were subjected to a strip search and/or a visual\nbody cavity search as new detainees at the Cook County Jail on or after January 30,\n2004.โ  Dkt. No. 92 at 16.  Plaintiffs challenge the searches of the Class I members\nunder the Fourth Amendment and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  Both sides contend they are entitled to summary judgment\nwith respect to the Class I plaintiffs.  \na. Fourth Amendment\nFor purposes of the summary judgment motions, plaintiffs concede that it is\n25\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 26 of 37\nproper for CCJ to conduct strip searches of the Class I members in groups.  They\nchallenge the manner in which those group searches were conducted.  Defendants\nargue that the manner in which the searches were conducted did not violate the Fourth\nAmendment as a matter of law.  \nBell v. Wolfish is again the starting point for the Courtโs analysis.  The Supreme\nCourt made clear, otherwise permissible strip โsearches must be conducted in a\nreasonable manner.โ  Bell, 441 U.S. at 560; see also Campbell v. Miller, 499 F.3d 711,\n718 (7th Cir. 2007) (finding unreasonable a strip search conducted in the backyard of a\nhouse in full view of the public).  \nThe full extent of the circumstances of the group searches of the Class I\nmembers is factually disputed.  The following facts concerning those searches,\nhowever, are undisputed:  (1) men at CCJ have been routinely strip searched in groups\nof up to at least seventy-five individuals; (2) until approximately February 2007, there\nwere no privacy screens in the hallway where the members of Class I were searched at\nthe RCDC โ meaning they were searched in full view of the other detainees in the\ngroup being searched8; (3) on occasion, bodily fluids have been present in the hallway\nwhere the searches of the Class I members occurred; (4) the members of Class I had,\nat times, no more than six inches of space between each other during the strip\n8Defendants attempt to dispute whether Class I members could see each othersโ\nnaked bodies by stating that the detainees are ordered to look forward or down at the\nfloor.  Though defendants are entitled to reasonable inferences in response to plaintiffsโ\nmotion, no reasonable fact finder could infer that seventy-five naked men standing in\nclose quarters for purposes of a strip search will not, incidental to those circumstances,\nobserve other menโs naked bodies.  Such an inference would defy common sense. \nRegardless, it is undermined by the unrebutted class member declarations submitted by\nplaintiffs.  \n26\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 27 of 37\nsearches before the privacy screens were installed; (5) individuals in the group\nsearches, prior to the installation of the privacy screens, would accidentally bump into\nand touch each other; and (6) prior to some time in 2006, men were searched using the\nless dignified bend-and-spread method, whereas women were searched using the\nsquat-and-cough method.  \nIn light of these undisputed facts, the Court finds that the strip searches of the\nmembers of Class I before the privacy screens were installed at the RCDC were\nunreasonable and violated the Fourth Amendment as a matter of law.  During that\nperiod, the class members, who were undergoing one of the most intrusive types of\nsearches the government may permissibly conduct, were subjected to conditions that\ngreatly enhanced their discomfort and humiliation.  They were herded together with\ndozens of other men and forced to strip and bend over or squat in front of a large\ngroup, with less than a foot of space between them.  \nThough the officials at CCJ were entitled to conduct these strip searches (except\nas to Class II members) so long as they did so in a safe and efficient manner, the\nextreme conditions of the searches violated the Fourth Amendment.  The search in\nCampbell was not conducted at a jail, but that case is still instructive for the Seventh\nCircuitโs clear denunciation of the search of a naked detainee in public view.  Campbell,\n499 F.3d at 718-19 (collecting cases); see also Amaechi, 237 F.3d at 361-62 (noting\nthat reasonableness of strip search depends in large part on whether it was conducted\nin private).  โWhen [strip] searches are conducted in public, the intrusion is considered\neven more severe.โ  Bullock, 568 F. Supp. 2d at 975 (citing Campbell, 499 F.3d at 718-\n19) (holding strip search at CCJ violated Fourth Amendment as a matter of law). \n27\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 28 of 37\nDefendantsโ attempt to distinguish Campbell on the basis that the search in that case\noccurred at a private residence is unpersuasive.  Finding that strip searches in โpublicโ\nviolate constitutional principles, the Seventh Circuit cited cases where the โpublicโ\nsearch was conducted at a detention facility.  See Campbell, 499 F.3d at 719 (citing Hill\nv. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 392, 395-95 (10th Cir. 1984); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d\n1007, 1010 (4th Cir. 1981)).  \nElliott v. Lynn, 38 F.3d 188 (5th Cir. 1994), cited by defendants, provides an\ninstructive contrast to the pre-privacy screen searches conducted at the RCDC.  In\nElliott, the warden ordered an institution-wide โshakedownโ at a Louisiana penitentiary\nthat included strip searching every prisoner incarcerated there.  Id. at 189-90.9  This\nwas done in response to a rash of murders, stabbings, and other attacks among the\ngeneral population at the prison.  Id.  The plaintiffs in Elliott did not challenge the\npropriety of conducting strip searches, just the manner in which they were conducted. \nId. at 190.  Due to the need to search all 3,164 prisoners as quickly as possible, the\nprisoners were searched in groups of five or six in one area of the prison while fifty-five\nother inmates were present awaiting inspection.  Id.  There is no indication that the\nprisoners were piled together without personal space while being searched; rather, the\nsearches took place in small groups while other prisoners stood apart from those being\nsearched.  The Fifth Circuit found the searches were reasonable under the\ncircumstances, especially considering the need to conduct them quickly.  Id. at 191-92.  \n9As convicted prisoners, those searched in Elliott enjoyed even more limited\nconstitutional protections against unreasonable searches than the pretrial detainees in\nthe current case.  See Thompson, 412 F. Supp. 2d at 888-89 (collecting cases).  \n28\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 29 of 37\nThe current case involves far less pressing needs, as there is no contention that\nviolence would erupt if the searches of the Class I plaintiffs were conducted with fewer\ndetainees at a time.  Though other prisoners were present and possibly watching the\nsearches in Elliott, that was due only to the emergency situation.  Even facing such\ncircumstances, the prison officials in Elliot searched only five to six men at a time,\nthereby calculating their efforts to preserve some dignity.  Defendants submit no\nevidence that they made any such efforts during the period before they installed the\nprivacy screens.  \nDefendants contend that privacy screens or partitions are not constitutionally\nrequired, and state, in this regard, that โ[i]institutional security trumps detaineesโ\ndesires.โ  Sheriff Defendantsโ Resp. to Pls.โ Mot. for Summ. J. at 12.  This contention\nimplicates the feasibility of using screens in the RCDC hallway because defendants are\narguing that the desire for privacy screens must give to way to security concerns.  Such\na contention, however, is undermined by the fact that in 2007, privacy screens were\ninstalled in the hallway at the RCDC and have been used without problems since that\ntime.  Moreover, defendantsโ expert witness testified that he was unaware of any facility\n(other than CCJ) that has conducted group strip searches without providing some sort\nof privacy partitions for the last two decades.  \nBased on the undisputed facts, no reasonable jury could find that the group strip\nsearches of the Class I members prior to the installation of the privacy screens\ncomplied with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.  Accordingly, the Court\nenters summary judgment as to liability in favor the Class I plaintiffs for searches\noccurring before the installation of the privacy screens in the hallway at the RCDC in or\n29\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 30 of 37\naround February 2007.  \nThe Court will not, however, grant either sideโs motion for summary judgment\nwith respect to Class Iโs alleged Fourth Amendment violations for the period after the\nprivacy screens were installed at the RCDC.  Disputed questions of material facts exist\nwith respect to those searches.  Those disputed facts include, at a minimum, (1)\nwhether the privacy screens were always used; (2) the frequency and prevalence of\nbodily fluids present in the strip search area; (3) the alleged use of dogs for intimidation\nand humiliation purposes; and (4) other allegedly abusive conduct by CCJ officials. \nThough any one of these allegations, if proven by plaintiffs, arguably might not cause\nthe searches to violate the Fourth Amendment, proof of some or all of them might be\nsufficient to do so.  Accordingly, due to the existence of disputed factual issues, the\nCourt denies plaintiffsโ and defendantsโ motions for summary judgment on this part of\nClass Iโs claims.  \nb. Equal protection\nThe Class I plaintiffs also claim that the manner of the group strip searches\nconducted at the RCDC violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment because male detainees were searched in a significantly different manner\nthan female detainees, without justification for doing so.  One difference between the\nmale and female searches is that the female searches were conducted with privacy\nscreens long before the men.  Another difference has to do with the use of body\nscanning machines.  As with the Class I plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment claims, the facts\nare undisputed with respect to certain aspects of the strip searches prior to the time\nwhen the privacy screens were installed at RCDC.  Accordingly, the Court will analyze\n30\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 31 of 37\nthe propriety of summary judgment based on those limited, undisputed facts.  \nIt is undisputed that the strip searches policies upon entry to CCJ expressly\ntreated men and women differently.  When a โchallenged policy expressly discriminates\n. . . on the basis of gender, it is subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.โ  Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 723\n(1982).  A proponent of a policy that treats men and women in a significantly different\nway, as in this case, โmust carry the burden of showing an exceedingly persuasive\njustification for the differing treatment.  The burden is met only by showing at least that\nthe classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory\nmeans employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.โ  Id.\nat 724 (internal quotations omitted); see also Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273-74\n(applying the same rule in context of strip search policies).  This comports with the\ngeneral rule that gender-based classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny. \nVarner v. Ill. State Univ., 226 F.3d 927, 934 (citing J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127,\n136 (1994)); Bullock, 568 F. Supp. 2d at 973.  \nDefendants cite institutional security as a justification for the difference in the\nstrip search policies between male and female detainees.  Specifically, defendants\nfocus on the greater number of men held at CCJ and processed through the RCDC. \nDefendant Sheahan made a similar argument in Bullock.  See Bullock, 568 F. Supp. 2d\nat 972, 974 & n.2.  Defendants certainly had a legitimate interest in processing\ndetainees entering CCJ in a safe and efficient manner.  They have not, however,\npresented any evidence that the difference in search policies between men and women\n31\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 32 of 37\nโsubstantially furthersโ that interest.  See J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 136-37; Mary Beth G., 723\nF.2d at 1273-74.  Though it is undisputed that CCJ houses more men than women, that\nfact alone does not explain why, prior to the installation of the privacy screens, men\nwere strip searched in such large groups, without any privacy, and packed together so\ntightly that they could not help seeing and touching each other.  Nor does it explain why\nthe squat-and-cough was not utilized for male detainees until long after it was used for\nfemale detainees.  No reasonable juror could find that such a search furthers a\nsubstantial governmental interest.  \nDefendants also cite the fact that men and women are searched in different\nareas of CCJ as justification for the different policies.  Several courts in this district have\npreviously determined that such โlogisticalโ concerns cannot justify the treatment of a\nspecific group of detainees.  See Bullock, 568 F. Supp. 2d at 973-74; Gary, 1998 WL\n547116 at *2, 9.10  This Court agrees.  Again, the logistics of processing male and\nfemale detainees in different areas does not justify treating men and women differently.  \nCook County also contends that womenโs menstrual cycles justify a policy\naffording female detainees greater privacy.  This is not an โexceedingly persuasiveโ\njustification for the difference between the male and female searches.  Male detainees\nalso present hygiene issues.  The fact that some female detainees present one\ndifferent or additional hygiene issue is insufficient to justify the stark gender-based\ndifferences between the search policies prior to the time the privacy screens were\n10The cases from the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits that the Sheriff\nDefendants cite in support of their contentions are inapposite, because none of them\nconcerned disparate gender treatment with respect to strip search policies.  \n32\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 33 of 37\ninstalled in the male search area at the RCDC.  \nLast, defendants contend that the differences in charges against men and\nwomen justify the differing strip search policies.  Apart from the inconsistency that\narises from defendantsโ desire to consider the nature of detaineesโ charges with respect\nto Class I and their contrary arguments with respect to Class II, defendants fail to cite\nany evidence to support the contention that men and women were charged with\nmaterially different crimes or posed different security risks.  \nThe undisputed facts show, as a matter of law, that the strip searches of the\nClass I members prior to the installation of privacy screens at the RCDC violated the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court enters summary\njudgment in favor of plaintiffs on that basis.  The Court denies both partiesโ motions for\nsummary judgment, however, with respect to remainder of the Class I plaintiffsโ equal\nprotection claims, due to the existence of disputed material facts.  Those facts include\nthose that precluded summary judgment for either side on part of the Class I plaintiffsโ\nFourth Amendment claims, as well as disputed facts concerning the viability of using\nbody scanning machines for male detainees and the necessity of subjecting male\ndetainees to two strip searches.  \nc. Unlawful punishment\nThe Class I plaintiffs contend that certain aspects of the strip search procedures\nconstitute unlawful punishment.  The Eighth Amendment does not apply to pretrial\ndetainees.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 535 n.16; Tesch v. County of Green Lake, 157 F.3d 465,\n472-73 (7th Cir. 1998).  Pursuant to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, however, pretrial detainees may not be punished, except in connection\n33\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 34 of 37\nwith infractions committed while in custody.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 535; see also Thompson,\n412 F. Supp. 2d at 887 (collecting authorities).  Due process protections for pretrial\ndetainees in this case are at least as great as the protections afforded to convicted\ncriminals under the Eighth Amendment.  Tesch, 157 F.3d at 473.  Pretrial detainees\nโhave an interest in being free from gratuitously severe restraints and hazards.โ  Hart v.\nSheahan, 396 F.3d 887, 893 (7th Cir. 2005).  Plaintiffs do not have to establish intent. \nSee id. at 892 (โPunishment is not the only motive for brutal treatment.  But whatever\nthe motive is, if the brutal treatment is gratuitous, due process in its substantive sense\nhas been violated.โ).  \nAs with the Class I plaintiffsโ Fourth Amendment claims, the Court denies\nsummary judgment with respect to the post-privacy screen period, in which significant\nfacts are disputed.  For the policies during the earlier period to the extent there are no\nmaterial factual disputes (the same as recounted above in the Fourth Amendment\nanalysis), it is appropriate to enter summary judgment in favor of the Class I plaintiffs. \nAgain it is undisputed that members of Class I, prior to the installation of privacy\nscreens in the RCDC hallway, were strip searched in large groups, without any minimal\nform of privacy, where they saw and touched one another.  No reasonable jury could\nfind that this policy was โreasonably related to a legitimate goal.โ  Tesch, 157 F.3d at\n474 (quotation omitted).  Rather, this is an example of โunreasonably harsh treatment\nmeted out to inmates who have not yet been convicted of any crime.โ  Hart, 396 F.3d at\n892.\nAccordingly, the Court grants summary judgment to the Class I plaintiffs on their\n34\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 35 of 37\nunlawful punishment claim for the period prior to the installation of the privacy screens\nat the RCDC and otherwise denies their motion on the punishment claims.  The Court\ndenies defendantsโ motions for summary judgment on the punishment claims.  \n4. Qualified immunity\nThe Sheriff Defendants filed a second summary judgment motion contending\nthey are entitled to qualified immunity.  Plaintiffs have sued the Sheriff Defendants in\ntheir individual and their official capacities.  โ[I]t is well established that the qualified\nimmunity doctrine does not apply to official capacity claims.โ  Sanville v. McCaughtry,\n266 F.3d 724, 732 (7th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted).  The Court therefore denies\nSheriff Defendantsโ motion with respect to plaintiffsโ official capacity claims.  Plaintiffs\nconcede the Sheriff Defendantsโ motion with respect to plaintiffsโ individual capacity\nclaims.  Accordingly, the Sheriff Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on\nqualified immunity grounds in their individual capacities.  \n5. Cook Countyโs liability\nIn its summary judgment motion, Cook County contends there is no basis to hold\nit liable for constitutional violations that occurred at CCJ.  Under Illinois law, the Cook\nCounty Sheriff is an elected county officer.  Cook County cannot be held vicariously\nliable for the Sheriffโs, or his staffโs, conduct.  Moy v. County of Cook, 159 Ill. 2d 519,\n528-32, 640 N.E.2d 926, 929-31 (1994); see also Ryan v. County of DuPage, 45 F.3d\n1090, 1092 (7th Cir. 1995).  Thus Cook County is entitled to summary judgment on\ncount seven of plaintiffsโ third amended complaint, which seeks to impose liability\nagainst Cook County under the doctrine of respondeat superior.  \n35\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 36 of 37\nCook County is mistaken, however, when it contends that plaintiffs have not\nasserted a claim for indemnification against it.  Count eight of the third amended\ncomplaint asserts such a claim.  Cook County acknowledges that with respect to\nsection 1983 claims against county sheriffs, Illinois counties have a duty to indemnify\njudgments, rendering the counties necessary parties.  Carver v. Sheriff of LaSalle\nCounty, 324 F.3d 947, 948 (7th Cir. 2003).  Accordingly, Cook Countyโs motion for\nsummary judgment is denied with respect to count eight.  \nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants the Sheriff Defendantsโ motion to\nstrike plaintiffsโ Local Rule 56.1 statement with respect to paragraph 77, but otherwise\ndenies that motion [# 259].  The Court grants the Sheriff Defendantsโ motion for\nsummary judgment based on qualified immunity with respect to the Sheriff Defendants\nin their individual capacities but otherwise denies that motion [# 206]; denies the Sheriff\nDefendantsโ motion for summary judgment based on constitutionality of the search\npolicy [# 204]; and grants Cook Countyโs motion for summary judgment with respect to\nplaintiffsโ respondeat superior claims but otherwise denies that motion [# 223].  The\nCourt grants plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment with respect to the claims by the\nClass II members and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims of the Class I\nmembers for searches that occurred prior to the installation of privacy screens in the\nhallway at the RCDC but otherwise denies the motion [#228].  The Court denies as\nmoot plaintiffsโ motion to strike defendantsโ expert [# 255].  This case is set for a status\nhearing on March 10, 2009 at 9:30 a.m.  Each side is to file a status report by March 6,\n36\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 278      Filed 02/23/2009     Page 37 of 37\n2009 addressing what issues and claims remain unresolved and how the Court should\nproceed.  \n________________________________\n           MATTHEW F.

After notice was sent to the \nSettlement Classes,1 this Court held a Final Approval Hearing on March 1, 2011, for the purpose \nof determining  ( 1)  whether the proposed  settlement,  on the  terms  set  forth  in the  Parties' \nSettlement Agreement, is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and should be finally approved by this \nCourt;  (2) whether, pursuant to  the terms of the proposed settlement, a judgment should be \nentered dismissing Defendant County of Cook and Sheriff Tom Dart and releasing Defendants \n1 All terms and phrases used in this Order shall have the same meaning as in the Class \nAction Release and Settlement Agreement dated November 16, 2010, including the exhibits (the \n\"Settlement Agreement\"). \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 650 Filed: 03/04/11 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:16106\nand the other Releases from all Released Claims; and (3) whether to award attorneys' fees and \nexpenses to Class Counsel and Class Member Incentive Awards. \nThe  Court,  having  reviewed  the  Settlement  Agreement  and  all  papers  submitted  in \nconnection with the proposed settlement, and having considered all arguments of counsel and \nobjectors; finds that the Parties have evidenced full compliance with the Preliminary Approval \nOrder, and that there are substantial and sufficient grounds for entering this Order Granting Final \nApproval of Settlement and Final Judgment (\"Final Order and Judgment\").  The Court therefore \ndirects the Parties and their counsel to implement and consummate the Settlement Agreement \nand directs the administration of the settlement in accordance with the terms and provisions of \nthe Settlement Agreement. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED as follows: \n1.  The Court has federal subject matter jurisdiction of this Action and jurisdiction to \napprove the settlement. \n2.  The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Named Plaintiffs and all members of \nthe Settlement Classes. \n3.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the Court finds that (a) members \nof each Settlement Class are so numerous as to make joinder of all members impracticable; \n(b) there are questions of law or fact common to each of the Settlement Classes; (c) the claims of \nthe Named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the Settlement Classes they represent; (d) the \nNamed Plaintiffs and Class Counsel fairly and adequately protected and will continue to protect \nthe interests of the members of the Settlement Classes; (e) questions of law or fact common to \nthe members of each of the Settlement Classes predominate over any questions affecting only \nindividual members; and (f) a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of the Action. \n2 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 650 Filed: 03/04/11 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:16107\n4.  The Court therefore finds that the requirements for certifying a settlement class \nhave been met and are appropriate under the circumstances of this case pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure  23(b )(3).  The Court certifies for  settlement purposes only  the following \nSettlement Classes, with the Named Plaintiffs representing each Settlement Class as follows: \n(a)  Settlement Class I (Class Representatives:  Ronald Johnson) \nAll males who were subjected to a strip search and/or visual body cavity \nsearch as a new detainee at the Cook County Jail between January 30, \n2004 and March 30,2009. \n(b)  Settlement  Class  II  (Class  Representatives:  Kim  Young,  Carl  Gray, \nMatthew  Liptak,  Lee  E.  Mercado,  Gerrard  Lam our,  Allen  Gorman, \nBradley Hytrek, William Jones) \nAll people (male and female) charged with only a misdemeanor or lesser \noffense not involving drugs or weapons who were subjected to a strip \nsearch and/or a visual body cavity search as a new detainee at the Cook \nCounty Jail between January 30, 2004 and March 30, 2009. \n(c)  Excluded from these Settlement Classes are the following persons: \n(i)  Members of the Northern District of Illinois federal judiciary and \ntheir immediate families; and \n(ii)  All persons who  have  timely  elected  to  opt  out  of or exclude \nthemselves from the Settlement Classes in accordance with the Court's \nOrders. \n5.  The Court gives final approval to the settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate \nto the Named Plaintiffs and to each member of the Settlement Classes, and in their best interests, \nand in full compliance with all requirements of due process and federal law.  The settlement is \nfinally approved in all respects. \n6.  The Settlement Agreement, settlement of this Action, or any proceedings taken \npursuant thereto, are not, and should not in any event be offered or received as evidence of, a \npresumption, concession, or an admission of liability or of any misrepresentation or omission in \nany statement or written document approved or made by Defendant; provided, however, that \n3 \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-00552 Document #: 650 Filed: 03/04/11 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:16108\nreference  may  be  made  to  this  Agreement  and  the  settlement  provided  for  herein  m  such \nproceedings as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Agreement. \n7.  The  Court  finds  that  the  Mailed  Notice,  Published  Notice,  and  Notice  Plan \nimplemented  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  (i) constituted  the  best  practicable  notice; \n(ii) constituted notice that is reasonably calculated under the circumstances to apprise members \nof the  Settlement  Classes  of the  pendency  of the  Action,  their  right  to  object  or  exclude \nthemselves from the proposed settlement and to appear at the Final Approval Hearing, and their \nright to make a claim under the settlement; (iii) were reasonable and constituted due, adequate, \nand  sufficient  notice  to  all  persons  entitled  to  receive  notice;  and  (iv) met  all  applicable \nrequirements of due process and federal law. \n8.  The  Court  finds  that  Class  Counsel  and  the  Named  Plaintiffs  adequately \nrepresented  the  Settlement  Classes  for  the  purpose  of entering  into  and  implementing  the \nSettlement Agreement.  The Court further finds that Rust Consulting, Inc., the Court-appointed \nClaims Administrator,  has  met all  requirements of the  Court as  set forth  in  the  Preliminary \nApproval Order and Settlement Agreement. \n9.  The Court has considered all objections, including those that may not technically \nqualify  as  objections  and  those  that were  filed  after  the  objection  deadline.  This  includes \nobjections submitted by  James Harris  and Alicia Kimbrough-Hassan.  After considering the \nobjections, and all briefing and oral argument offered in support of or in opposition to same, and \nfor  the  reasons stated in open court at the  Final Approval Hearing, the  Court finds  that the \nobjections are without merit.  Accordingly, all objections are hereby overruled. \n10.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\nEASTERN DIVISION \nKIM YOUNG, et al.,  )\n)\nPlaintiffs, )\n)\nvs. ) Case No. 06 C 552\n)\nSHERIFF THOMAS DART,  )\n)\nDefendant. )\n      \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nMATTHEW F. KENNELLY, District Judge:\nThe defendant, Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart, has moved to stay\nproceedings in this Court pending his interlocutory appeal of a purported Eleventh\nAmendment issue, specifically, the Courtโs ruling denying his motion for judgment as a\nmatter of law at the recent jury trial.  Defendantโs interlocutory appeal is frivolous. \nAccordingly, the Court denies his motion to stay these proceedings.\nBackground\nPlaintiffs, on behalf of two certified classes, sued the defendant for constitutional\nviolations stemming from strip searches performed on incoming detainees at Cook\nCounty Jail (CCJ).  Some of the plaintiffsโ claims concerned whether any strip search\nwas appropriate; other claims concerned the manner in which strip searches were\nconducted.\nThe Court granted partial summary judgment in favor of one of the classes and a\nportion of the other class on the issue of liability.  See Young v. County of Cook, 616 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 834 (N.D. Ill. 2009).  Defendantโs interlocutory appeal does not concern that\nruling.  The plaintiffsโ remaining claims were tried to a jury in August 2009 on the issue\nof liability.  The claims that were tried did not involve whether defendant was permitted\nto conduct a strip search at intake.  Rather, the claims considered at the trial all\ninvolved the manner of intake strip searches conducted at the CCJ from February 2007\nthrough March 2009.\nDuring the trial, defendants filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50.  The motion included an argument that\nplaintiffsโ claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States\nConstitution.  See Dkt. No. 415.  Specifically, defendants contended that a provision of\nthe Illinois Administrative Code required them to conduct strip searches, thereby\ntransforming county officials into agents of the State of Illinois and conferring Eleventh\nAmendment immunity on them as state actors.  Id. at 11-12.  The Court denied that\nmotion in an oral ruling.  The jury subsequently found in favor of plaintiffs on each of\ntheir claims.  \nOn August 21, 2009, defendants filed a notice of appeal from the Courtโs denial\nof their Rule 50 motion.  The notice of appeal referenced only the denial of that\nparticular motion, not any other ruling by the Court.1  Defendants also filed a motion to\nstay proceedings in this Court during the pendency of their interlocutory appeal.  The\nCourt ordered expedited briefing on defendantsโ motion to stay.  \n1The notice of interlocutory appeal makes it clear that defendant is appealing\nonly from the Courtโs order denying his judgment as a matter of law at trial, and not\nfrom anything relating to the Courtโs summary judgment ruling.\n2\n\nDiscussion\nAn interlocutory appeal on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds typically\nrequires a stay of further proceedings in the district court.  See generally Apostol v.\nGallon, 870 F.2d 1335, 1337-40 (7th Cir. 1989).  Exceptions exist to the general rule. \nโ[A] notice of appeal may be so baseless that it does not invoke appellate jurisdiction.โ \nId. at 1339.  Thus this Court may decline to stay proceedings if defendantsโ\ninterlocutory appeal is frivolous.  Id.  Frivolousness that would justify denying a motion\nto stay includes when the decision concerning immunity โis so plainly correct that\nnothing can be said on the other side.โ  Id.  Additionally, a motion to stay may be denied\nwhere defendants โforfeitโ the right to a stay or where โthey use [a] claim[ ] of immunity\nin a manipulative fashion.โ  Id.  \nIn the current case, defendantsโ interlocutory appeal is frivolous, for at least two\nreasons.  First, defendants forfeited their Eleventh Amendment defense by failing to\nplead it or to assert it in timely fashion.  Second, the defense is plainly lacking in merit,\nbecause the trial in this case concerned the manner of the strip searches, not whether\ndefendant was entitled to conduct strip searches.  In reaching these conclusions, the\nCourt is cognizant that the Seventh Circuit has instructed district court judges to\nexercise โrestraintโ when using their power to find an interlocutory appeal concerning\nimmunity frivolous.  Id.  \n1. Forfeiture\nImmunity from suit is an affirmative defense.  See Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S.\n635, 640 (1980) (qualified immunity); cf. Baxter v. Vigo County Sch. Corp., 26 F.3d 728,\n3\n\n734 n.5 (7th Cir. 1994) (defendant bears burden of persuasion on Eleventh Amendment\nassertion).  โ[F]ailure to raise [an affirmative] defense in a timely manner will result in a\nforfeiture.โ  Cheeks v. Gaetz, 571 F.3d 680, 685 (7th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).2\nDefendant contends that he has not forfeited the Eleventh Amendment defense\nraised in his Rule 50 motion, which forms the basis for his interlocutory appeal,\nbecause it appeared in his answer and affirmative defenses to the third amended\ncomplaint.  The Court disagrees; that was a different Eleventh Amendment defense.  In\nthat answer, defendant asserted that he has โabsolute immunity from suit for monetary\ndamages under the Eleventh Amendment . . . because [he was] executing a valid Court\nOrder and therefore [has] judicial immunity.โ  Answer & Aff. Defs. to Pls.โ 3d Am.\nCompl. (dkt. no. 154) at 43 ยถ 6.  Execution of a court order is not the Eleventh\nAmendment defense that defendant later asserted in his Rule 50 motion and that forms\nthe basis for his interlocutory appeal.  Rather, the Rule 50 motion was expressly\npremised on the purported application of a provision of the Illinois Administrative Code. \nIn short, the Eleventh Amendment defense that defendant pleaded and the one that he\nasserted for the first time in his Rule 50 motion are not the same.\nDefendant did reference the Illinois Administrative Code in another affirmative\ndefense responding to the third amended complaint.  Specifically, defendant asserted\nthat the Illinois Administrative Code โspecifically mandates that the Sheriff conduct strip\n2 The Eleventh Amendment does not curtail federal courtsโ subject matter\njurisdiction.  See, e.g., Endres v. Indiana State Police, 349 F.3d 922, 925 (7th Cir.\n2003).\n4\n\nsearches as part of the admission of detainees.  20 Ill. Adm. Code 701.40 (2006).  As\nsuch, these Defendants cannot be held liable for enacting or supervising programs\nrequired under state law.โ  Answer & Aff. Defs. to Pls.โ 3d Am. Compl. (dkt. no. 154) at\n44 ยถ 8.  Defendant did not, however, identify this as implicating the Eleventh\nAmendment or any other sort of immunity.3\nEven if defendant had asserted in his pleadings the Eleventh Amendment\ndefense on which he now bases his interlocutory appeal, he forfeited the right to stay\nthese proceedings, because he did not seek a ruling on the defense before trial.  See\nApostol, 870 F.2d at 1339.  In this respect, this case is different from Bullock v. Dart,\nNo. 04 C 1051 (N.D. Ill.), which defendant cites in his motion to stay.  Defendant\ncorrectly notes that Judge Elaine Bucklo concluded that an interlocutory appeal based\non an Eleventh Amendment defense in that case was not frivolous.  The Bullock\ndefendants, however, raised the issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity in a summary\njudgment motion and began pursuing their interlocutory appeal as soon as Judge\nBucklo denied their motion for reconsideration of her summary judgment decision on\nthat issue.  The defendant in the present case acknowledges these facts about Bullock\nin his motion to stay.  See Defs.โ Mot. to Stay Proceedings ยถยถ 6-7.  Unlike Bullock, the\ndefendant in this case acted in the least expeditious manner possible:  he failed to\nplead the defense he now seeks to assert; he failed to bring it before the Court in a\ndispositive motion prior to trial; and he raised it for the first time near the end of a jury\n3Defendantsโ answer to the fifth amended complaint, filed on July 14, 2009,\ncontains the same defenses as the answer to the third amended complaint pertaining to\nthe Eleventh Amendment and the Illinois Administrative Code.  See Answer & Aff. Defs.\nto Pls.โ 5th Am. Compl. (dkt. no. 350) at 47 ยถยถ 6 & 8,\n5\n\ntrial.\nDefendantโs own motion demonstrates his tardiness in raising the Eleventh\nAmendment issue.  He contends that a stay is necessary โ[t]o obtain the full benefits of\nthis appeal, including immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.โ  Defs.โ Mot.\nto Stay Proceedings ยถ 5.  If defendant wanted the โfull benefitโ of an Eleventh\nAmendment defense, he could have and should have raised the issue in a motion to\ndismiss or, at the absolute latest, in a motion for summary judgment.  Instead, he sat on\nthe issue โ or did not think of its existence โ during three years of discovery and\nextensive motion practice.  He waited until nearly two weeks into a jury trial on liability to\nraise it for the first time.\nIt bears mentioning that defendant did assert yet another Eleventh Amendment\ndefense at an earlier point in the case.  After the Court ruled on the partiesโ summary\njudgment motions in late February 2009 (after the case had been pending for about\nthree years), defendant filed a motion for an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. ยง\n1292(b).  See Defendantsโ Joint Mot. for Interloc. Appeal (dkt. no. 281).  The motion\nlargely focused on the merits of the Courtโs summary judgment ruling.  Defendant also\nstated, however, that he had โraised Eleventh Amendment immunity as an affirmative\ndefense.  The grounds for Eleventh Amendment immunity are numerous.  Defendantsโ\nsearch process is mandated by state law and thus defendants were acting pursuant to\nstate law.โ  Id. at 10.  This argument, however, centered on the proposition that the CCJ\nhouses state prisoners in addition to local detainees.  See id.  Defendant also stated\nthat โthe issue of whether the defendants acted as an โarm of the stateโ in conducting\nvisual strip searches where state law mandates a โthoroughโ search is inextricably\n6\n\nintertwinedโ (he did not say what it is intertwined with).  Id. at 9.  But he cited nothing to\nsupport the proposition that state law mandated a โthoroughโ search, leaving this\nentirely to the imagination.  In any event, the purported requirement for a thorough\nsearch is not contained in the Illinois Administrative Code provision that defendant cited\nin his Rule 50 motion and that is the basis for his current interlocutory appeal.  In other\nwords, the purported Eleventh Amendment defense that defendant tried to assert in his\nmotion for interlocutory appeal back in March 2009 is not the Eleventh Amendment\ndefense he now raises.\nIn any event, defendantโs assertion of the Eleventh Amendment in his March\n2009 motion for an interlocutory appeal of the summary judgment ruling was utterly\nfrivolous, because defendant had not even hinted at an Eleventh Amendment issue\nduring the extensive summary judgment briefing.  When the Court called this glaring\nomission to the attention of defense counsel at the hearing on the motion, held on April\n1, 2009, counsel conceded that defendant had not raised the purported Eleventh\nAmendment defense as a basis for summary judgment.  The Court found that aspect of\nthe March 2009 motion for interlocutory appeal frivolous, and defendant did not pursue\nthe matter further.\nTo summarize, defendantโs current interlocutory appeal based on the Eleventh\nAmendment defense raised in his Rule 50 motion is frivolous because defendant did\nnot plead it, did not raise it in a motion for summary judgment, and only sought to raise\nit near the end of a two-week jury trial.  Under these circumstances, defendant has\n7\n\nforfeited the defense.4\n2. Nature of plaintiffsโ claims and the Eleventh Amendment\nEven had the defendant had not forfeited his contention that he was a state actor\nbecause Illinois law required him to perform strip searches, his interlocutory appeal on\nthat issue would still be frivolous.  The defense is utterly lacking in merit with respect to\nthe claims that were decided at the jury trial.\nโThe Eleventh Amendment does not apply to suits against counties or other local\ngovernment entities,โ including county sheriffs in Illinois.  Richman v. Sheahan, 270\nF.3d 430, 439 (7th Cir. 2001).  An exception to this rule exists when a county sheriff\nacts โas an arm of the state.โ  Id.  โIn determining whether the sheriff is an agent of\nIllinois government when performing particular functions, [courts] have looked to the\ndegree of control exercised by Illinois over the conduct at issue and whether the\nEleventh Amendment policy of avoiding interference with state (as opposed to county)\npolicy is offended by the lawsuit.โ  Id.  \nIn his Rule 50 motion, defendant relied upon a section of the Illinois\nAdministrative Code pertaining to jail procedures that states:\n701.40 Admission Procedures\n. . .\nf) Strip Search\n1) A strip search shall be performed in an area that ensures privacy and\ndignity of the individual. The individual shall not be exposed to the view of\nothers who are not specifically involved in the process.\n4  Defendant does not contend that the defense is non-forfeitable.\n8\n\n2) Strip searches shall be conducted by a person of the same sex.\n3) All personal clothing shall be carefully searched for contraband.\n4) The probing of body cavities may not be done except where there is\nreasonable suspicion of contraband. Intrusive searches may only be\nconducted:\nA) By a medically trained person who is not a detainee, for\nexample, a physician, physician's assistant, registered nurse,\nlicensed practical nurse, or paramedic; and\nB) In a private location under sanitary conditions.\n20 Ill. Admin. Code 701.40(f).\nAssuming this regulation, as defendant contends, requires a strip search โ  as\nopposed to prescribing how a strip search, if done, should be conducted โ it does not\nprovide an Eleventh Amendment defense to the claims that were tried before the jury\nand that were the subject of defendantโs Rule 50 motion.  At the trial, the plaintiffs never\ncontested defendantโs right to strip search them upon intake to the CCJ.  To the\ncontrary, the plaintiffs admitted during their testimony that it was appropriate to conduct\na strip search, and plaintiffsโ counsel so stated to the jury a number of times.\nRather, plaintiffsโ claims that were tried to the jury involved the manner of the\nstrip searches that defendant conducted on intake.  Nothing in the Illinois administrative\nregulation quoted above required defendants to search detainees in the manner\nplaintiffs alleged at trial โ nor does defendant so contend.  As a result, compliance with\nthe regulation was not and could not have been a defense to plaintiffsโ claim that were\ntried to the jury.\nDefendant plainly was not acting as an agent of the State of Illinois for the\nconduct that was the subject of the trial and the Rule 50 motion.  The State exercised\n9\n\nno control over the conduct found by the jury, specifically, strip searches performed\nwithout privacy, with the subjects of the search exposed to the view of others not\ninvolved in the process.  And the Eleventh Amendmentโs policy of avoiding interference\nwith state (as opposed to county) policy is not offended by a suit that could not have\nsucceeded had defendant actually followed the State regulation on which he belatedly\nsought to rely.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that defendantโs interlocutory\nappeal of the denial of his Rule 50 motion is frivolous and therefore denies his motion\nto stay proceedings in this Court pending that appeal [# 434].\n________________________________\nMATTHEW F.

BERSKY, individually and in his official capacity as Chief Operating\nOfficer of Cermak Health Services of Cook County, state as follows:\nIntroduction\n1. This is an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and state law challenging the use of\nseveral unjustified and sexually-intrusive search procedures on both men and women at the Cook\nCounty Jail (โCCJโ).  \n2. First, the CCJ maintains a blanket policy requiring that all women placed in its\ncustody undergo a vaginal swabbing, a procedure which involves the insertion of a probe into the\nvagina.  \n3.   There is no legitimate purpose for subjecting detainees to this procedure.  Rather,\nas explained below, it is used only to humiliate and dehumanize the women detainees. Whiel\nDefendants subject all women to this procedure upon their entry into Cook County Jail, it either\nceased performing, or significantly restricted the use of, the equivalent procedure on male\ndetainees several years ago, after being sued be a male detainee in the case of Thompson v.\nCounty of Cook, 03-C-7172.    \n4 In addition to lacking any legitimate purpose, the procedures are also performed in\na coercive, unsanitary, and dehumanizing environment.  The examiners often fail to change\ngloves between procedures or otherwise follow usual precautions against the spread of infection. \nMoreover, the women are provided no explanation of what is being done to them.  Indeed, asking\n2\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 3 of 26(cid:10)\nquestions is treated as a form of recalcitrance which can result in the use of physical force on the\nwoman. \n5.  For example, Plaintiff YOUNG was processed into the CCJ as part of a group of\napproximately 30 women, all of whom were required to undergo the vaginal swabbing.  After it\nbecame clear what was being done to the group, one of the women demanded to know if the\npersonnel performing the procedures were licensed.  In response to her questions, several jail\nguards assaulted this woman in front of the rest of the group.  Plaintiff herself asked what was\nabout to happen to her when she was ordered to place herself on a table and put her legs in\nstirrups.  Her question met with silence and she had to participate without an explanation.  \n6 The CCJ also requires both men and women to undergo strip and body cavity\nsearches when being processed into the jail.  For men, the procedure requires that they strip\nnaked and line up facing a wall shoulder-to-shoulder with tens of other men (and sometimes\nmore than 100) who are also being processed into the jail.  The men are then instructed as a\ngroup to bend over and spread their buttocks with their hands.  All of the men must remain in\nthis position as guards walk down the row and visually inspects each manโs anal cavity.  Often\nmen are forced to stand naked amongst each other in close proximity for thirty-minutes or more.\n7. Women are required to undergo a similar set of searches, but, at least, not in the\npresence of other detainees.  The women must strip naked, bend over and assume a crouched\nposition.  They are then instructed to cough several times as a guard or guards watch.   \n8 These strip and visual body cavity searches are conducted pursuant to a blanket\nprocedure that does not require any particularized suspicion that the detainee is concealing\nanything in his/her cavities.  Moreover, the CCJ requires that these searches be conducted on all\n3\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 4 of 26(cid:10)\ndetainees at the time they are first brought to the CCJ without regard to the nature of the crime\nfor which they are being held.  In other words, a person arrested for a traffic-related misdemeanor\nwho has not yet been able to raise bail will be subjected to the same invasive search as someone\narrested for much more serious offences.\n9 There was no constitutional justification for the CCJ to force PLAINTIFFS and\nthe members of the class to submit to these needlessly invasive searches or for forcing them to\nundergo the procedures in such humiliating ways.  Nevertheless, Cook Countyโs policymakers,\nincluding Defendant SHEAHAN, instituted these unconstitutional procedures and they have\nturned a blind eye to the dehumanizing way in which these searches are conducted.  \n10. Indeed, individuals have sued previously over these practices, but the relatively-\nsmall liability threatened by these individual suits has not been sufficient to cause the\npolicymakers to implement reforms.  Plaintiffs bring this class action to compensate those who\nhave been victimized by these sexually-invasive procedures and, hopefully, to bring change.  \nJurisdiction and Venue\n11. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1367 as\nPlaintiffs asserts claims under federal law and the state law claims all arise out of the same facts\nas the federal claims.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b) as Defendant, COUNTY OF\nCOOK, is physically situated in this judicial district, and the events giving rise to the claims in\nthis case all occurred here.\nParties\n12.

On the evening of January 13, 2005, Plaintiff YOUNG was driving to her cousinโs\nhouse in Chicago for a funeral.  Her daughter, sister and granddaughters were in the car with her.\n6\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 7 of 26(cid:10)\n21. Chicago police arrested her on a warrant that was issued after Plaintiff YOUNG\nhad failed to appear on a traffic ticket.\n22.  The police took her to the CCJ where she was processed in accordance with the\njailโs usual procedures.  Ms. Young participated in the intake with approximately 30 other\nwomen.  \n23.  First, the women were placed in a line and serially taken behind a partition.  When\nMs. Youngโs turn came, she was ordered to remove all of her clothes and underwear, and was\ntold to squat down in front of a guard.  The guard then told her to cough.  Ms. Young complied\nwith all of the guardโs instructions.  She was required to repeat this procedure three times before\nbeing allowed to dress again. \n24.   Later, the approximately 30 women were led to a hallway lined with chairs, where\nthey were ordered to sit and wait.  Periodically, a woman emerged from a room off the hallway to\ncall numbers assigned to the detainees.  When their numbers were called, the detainees were\nmade to enter the room.\n25.   When the woman called Ms. Youngโs number, she entered the room and was told\nto sit at one of three tables.  A woman, who was dressed in street clothes drew two tubes of blood\nfrom Ms. Youngโs arm. When Young asked the woman why her blood was being taken, the\nwoman did not respond.   \n26.   Ms. Young was then sent to sit in the hallway again.  Approximately twenty\nminutes later, she was called back into the room, but this time she was led behind a partition.  A\nwoman ordered Young to remove her clothes again saying, โweโre going to examine you.โ When\nYoung asked what she was being examined for, the woman responded โjust get on the table.โ\n7\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 8 of 26(cid:10)\nYoung protested, telling the woman that she expected to be bonded out of the jail soon.  Ms.\nYoung was ordered to climb on to the examining table and place her feet in stirrups.\n27.    The woman proceeded to perform a vaginal swab on Ms. Young which included \ninserting a speculum and other probes into Ms. Youngโs vaginal cavity.  \n28.   Ms. Young was never given any paper to read or sign before any of these\nprocedures were performed on her, nor was she asked any questions about her medical status or\nhistory.\n29.   After the procedure, Ms. Young was instructed to return to the hall, where she\nwaited while the other women underwent the same procedure.\n30.   At one point, while Ms. Young was sitting in the hallway, one of the female\ndetainees demanded to know if the person drawing blood was licensed.  When this person\nresponded that she was not licensed, the woman refused to enter the room with her. The woman\nresponded, โweโre going to show you.โ  Soon guards arrived, physically abused the protesting\ndetainee, and took her away.\n31.    Neither Ms. Young nor any of the other women in her presence were asked to\nconsent to these procedures nor were the nature or purpose of the procedures explained to them.\n32.    On information and belief, the persons administering these procedures were\nemployees or agents of the Cook County Department of Health and of Cermak Health Services.  \n33.   On January 15th, approximately 36 hours after being arrested, Ms. Young was\nbrought before a judge and was released from Cook County Jail.  While being checked out of the\njail, Ms. Young asked the woman processing her paperwork if she could see the results of the \nprocedures.  The woman laughed at this request, and said โyou better get out of here now.โ\n8\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 9 of 26(cid:10)\n34.   On April 18, 2005, Plaintiff JOHNSON was booked into CCJ after having been\ncharged with possession of a controlled substance, a false charge of which he was later acquitted. \n35.   Mr. Johnson went through the intake process with approximately 100 other men. \nThese men were all ordered into a crowded hallway and then instructed to strip naked as a group. \nThey remained naked in each otherโs presence for more than thirty minutes.  The ventilation was\ninsufficient and the air stank of body oder.\n36.   At one point they were told to face a wall, bend over, and spread their buttocks\nwith their hands.  They had to remain in that position as guards walked down the row visually\ninspecting them.  Several of the guards made comments that the men were un-bathed and stank.   \n37.   The following day, Mr. Johnson was released from CCJ and placed on home\nmonitoring.\n38.   On January 30, 2006, Plaintiff William Jones was riding in a friendโs car when the\nfriend was pulled over by Palatine police.  Upon checking the identity of the vehicles occupants, \nthe officers discovered an outstanding warrant for Mr. Jones, issued after he had failed to appear\nat a hearing regarding a traffic offense.  They therefore arrested him.\n39.   The police took Mr. Jones to CCJ where he was processed in accordance with the\njailโs usual procedures.  Mr. Jones participated in the intake with approximately 100 other men.\n  40.   These men were all ordered into a crowded hallway and then instructed to strip\nnaked as a group.  They remained naked in each otherโs presence for approximately 40 minutes. \nThere was no heat in the hallway, and the temperature felt to be less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\nMany of the men were shivering. In addition, the ventilation was insufficient and the air stank of\nbody oder.\n9\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 10 of 26(cid:10)\n  41.   At one point a guard  told the men to put their head on one of the hallway walls,\nwhich were filthy, bend over, and spread their buttocks with their hands.  They had to remain in\nthat position as a guard walked down the row visually inspecting them.    \n  42.   During the 40 minute period, the guards repeatedly engaged in โhazingโ behavior,\npoking fun at the men and trying to โput them in their placeโ with teasing commands. \nClass Allegations\n43.   Cook County Jail is one of the largest detention centers in the world.  Hundreds of\nmen and women are brought into Cook County Jail each day, amounting to approximately\n100,000 people per-year.  Each person booked into Cook County Jail is subjected to the intake\nprocedures described herein.\n44.   Named Plaintiffs YOUNG, JOHNSON and JONES (the โNamed Plaintiffsโ) seek\nto pursue claims both for themselves and for a class of others similarly situated.  Named\nPlaintiffs believe that the class should be organized into the following four subclasses.\n45.   Class I consists of:\nAll women who have been subjected to vaginal swabbing in connection with the\nintake procedures at the Cook County Jail at anytime on or after January 30, 2004. \nClass I brings claims pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Due Process Clause and the Equal\nProtection Clause.  Plaintiff YOUNG seeks to represent this class.\n46.   The individuals in Class I are so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpractical.  The Named Plaintiffs estimate that Class I numbers in at least the thousands.\na. On information and belief, approximately 200,000 persons have been\nbooked into the Cook County Jail during the Class Period.  A substantial percentage of these\npersons are women;\n10\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 11 of 26(cid:10)\nb.  On information and belief, all women booked into Cook County Jail\nduring the Class Period have been subjected to the challenged swabbing procedure; and\nc.  Ms. Young herself witnessed at least 30 women being subjected to the\nprocedure.\n47.   There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of Class I.  Among\nthese common questions are:\na. Whether there is any legitimate purpose for subjecting the female\ndetainees to the swabbing procedure;\nb . Whether there is any sufficient justification for continuing to subject\nwomen to the swabbing procedure, when the CCJ discontinued subjecting men to the equivalent\nprocedure;\nc.  Whether the use of the procedure and/or the way in which it is conducted\nis an  unreasonable search;\nd.  Whether the use of the procedure and/or the way in which it is conducted\nviolates the detaineesโ rights under the Due Process Clause;\ne.  Whether the use of the procedure on women when the equivalent\nprocedure on men has been discontinued violates the womenโs rights to Equal Protection; \nf.   Whether Cook County maintains an express policy or custom requiring\nthe swabbing procedure, and/or whether the procedure was instituted by a policymaker(s) of\nCook County, and/or whether the policymakers of Cook County condoned or were deliberately\nindifferent to the use of the procedure; \ng. Whether any of Defendants SHEAHAN, BAIRD, KURDOVICH,\n11\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 12 of 26(cid:10)\nROTHENSTEIN, MARTIN, and/or BERSKY failed in their supervisory responsibilities to have\nterminated this procedure; and\nh.  Whether the procedure violates the womenโs rights under state law.\n48.   Plaintiff YOUNGโs claims are typical of the claims of Class I.  Ms. Young was\ndetained at the CCJ and was subjected to the swabbing procedure in accordance with the CCJโs\nusual practices.  She seeks to prove that the procedure violates the Fourth Amendment, the Due\nProcess Clause and the Equal Protection Clause, as well as state law, and that each of the\nDefendants is liable. \n49.   Plaintiff Young will fairly and adequately represent the interests of Class I.  She\nhas retained skilled counsel with experience in constitutional and class action litigation to\nrepresent the Class.\n50.   The questions of law and fact common to Class I predominate over any individual\nissues.\n51.   Class II consists of:\nAll men who have been subjected to a strip and visual body cavity search pursuant\nto the uniform intake search procedures at the Cook County Jail at anytime on or\nafter January 30, 2004.\nClass II brings claims pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the Due Process Clause and the Equal\nProtection Clause.  Plaintiffs JOHNSON and JONES seek to represent this class.\n52.   The individuals in the Class II are so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpractical.  The Named Plaintiffs estimate that Class II numbers in at least the thousands.\na. On information and belief, approximately 200,000 persons have been\nbooked into the Cook County Jail during the Class Period.  A substantial portion of the persons\n12\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 13 of 26(cid:10)\nare male;\nb.  On information and belief, each man booked into Cook County Jail during\nthe Class Period has been subjected to the strip and visual body cavity search described herein; \nc.  Mr. Johnson himself witnessed approximately 100 men being subjected to\nthe procedure; and\nd.  Mr. Jones himself witnessed approximately 100 men being subjected to\nthe procedure.\n53.   There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of Class II.  Among\nthese common questions are:\na. Whether it is unreasonable to conduct group strip and visual body cavity\nsearches of the men in a manner which violates the Fourth Amendment;\nb.  Whether the use of group strip and visual body cavity searches violates the\nmenโs rights under the Due Process Clause;\nc.  Whether the use of a group strip and body cavity search procedure for men\nbut not for women violates the Equal Protection Clause;\nd.   Whether Cook County maintains an express policy or custom requiring\nthe group procedure for members of Class II, and/or whether the application of the procedure to\nmembers of Class II was instituted by a Cook County policymaker(s), and/or whether the\npolicymakers of Cook County condoned or were deliberately indifferent to the use of the\nprocedure on the members of Class II; \ne. Whether any of Defendants SHEAHAN and/or BAIRD failed in their\nsupervisory responsibilities to have avoided the use of a group strip and cavity search procedure\n13\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 14 of 26(cid:10)\nfor the members of Class II; and\nf.  Whether the procedure violates the state law rights of the members of\nClass II.\n54.   Plaintiffs JOHNSONโs and JONESโ claims are typical of the claims of Class II. \nBoth were booked into the CCJ and was subjected to the strip search and visual cavity search\nprocedure in accordance with the CCJโs usual practices for males.  Both seek to prove that the\nprocedure violates the Fourth Amendment, the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection\nClause as well as state law, and that Defendants COOK COUNTY, SHEAHAN, KURDOVICH\nand BAIRD are liable as a result. \n55.   Plaintiffs JOHNSON and JONES will fairly and adequately represent the interests\nof Class II.  They have retained skilled counsel with experience in constitutional and class action\nlitigation to represent the Class.\n56.   The questions of law and fact common to the Class II predominate over any\nindividual issues.\n57.   Class III consists of:\nAll persons who were arrested on failure to appear or bench warrants for traffic or\nmisdemeanor offenses and all persons arrested for traffic or misdemeanor offenses\nand who were subsequently subjected to a strip and/or visual cavity search at the\nCook County Jail at anytime on or after January 30, 2004 pursuant to the uniform \nintake search procedures. \nClass III brings claims pursuant to the Fourth Amendment and the Due Process Clause.  Plaintiffs\nYOUNG and JONES seek to represent this class.\n58.   The individuals in Class III are so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpractical.  The Named Plaintiffs estimate that Class III numbers in at least the thousands.\n14\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 15 of 26(cid:10)\na.

Mr. Jones himself witnessed approximately 100 men being subjected to\nthe procedure.\n. 59.   There are questions of law and fact common to the claims of Class III.  Among\nthese common questions are:\na. Whether there is any sufficient justification for subjecting the members of\nClass III to a blanket strip search procedure;\nb.  Whether the use of the procedure and/or the way in which it is conducted\nis an  unreasonable search;\nc.  Whether the use of the procedure and/or the way in which it is conducted\nviolates the detaineesโ rights under the Due Process Clause;\nd.   Whether Cook County maintains an express policy or custom requiring\nthe  procedure for members of Class III, and/or whether the application of the procedure to\nmembers of Class III was instituted by a Cook County policymaker(s), and/or whether the\npolicymakers of Cook County condoned or were deliberately indifferent to the use of the\n15\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 16 of 26(cid:10)\nprocedure on the members of Class III; \ne.

Whether Cook County maintains an express policy or custom requiring\nthe  procedure for members of Class IV, and/or whether the application of the procedure to\nmembers of Class IV was instituted by a Cook County policymaker(s), and/or whether the\n17\n\nCase 1:06-cv-00552     Document 16     Filed 02/27/2006     Page 18 of 26(cid:10)\npolicymakers of Cook County condoned or were deliberately indifferent to the use of the\nprocedure on the members of Class IV; \ne. Whether any of Defendants SHEAHAN, KURDOVICH and/or BAIRD\nfailed in their supervisory responsibilities to have avoided strip searching the members of Class\nIV; and\nf.  Whether the procedure violates the state law rights of the members of\nClass IV.\n66.   Plaintiffs YOUNGโs and Jonesโ claims are typical of the claims of Class IV.  Both\nwere arrested for a failure to appear for a traffic offense and she was then detained at the CCJ and\nboth were subjected to the visual cavity search procedure in accordance with the CCJโs usual\npractices.  Both seek to prove that the procedure violates the Fourth Amendment and the Due\nProcess Clause, as well as state law, and that Defendants COOK COUNTY, SHEAHAN,\nKURDOVICH and BAIRD are liable as a result. \n67.   Plaintiffs Young and Jones will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the\nClass IV.  They have retained skilled counsel with experience in constitutional and class action\nlitigation to represent the Class.\n68.   The questions of law and fact common to the Class IV predominate over any\nindividual issues.\nCount I - Class Iโs claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง1983\nfor violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\n69.   Plaintiffs re-allege each paragraph of this Complaint as if fully stated herein.\n70.

There is no proper or sufficient need or justification for discriminating between\nmen and women with regard to the swabbing procedure.\n78.   The continuation of the procedure for women, and/or the failure to limit it in the\nsame manner as for men, resulted from policies, customs and/or widespread practices of\nDefendant COOK COUNTY, and/or the express decisions of its policymaker(s).
