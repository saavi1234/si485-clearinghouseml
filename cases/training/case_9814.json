    "summary": "<p>On October 16, 1997, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Article 1, Section 12 of the New York State Constitution against the City of New York, the New York City Police Department, a Detective, unknown female officers, and Plaintiff's cousin in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked for compensatory and punitive damages, alleging she was falsely arrested, police used excessive force when arresting her, that she was strip-searched in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and that Defendants committed battery.  Plaintiff alleged claims against her cousin for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and intentional infliction of emotional distress because Plaintiff was arrested after her cousin filed a complaint against her.</p><p>On January 21, 1997, Defendant Detective arrested Plaintiff for a misdemeanor.  Plaintiff alleged Defendant used excessive force by bruising her arm when the Detective handcuffed her.  Plaintiff was subjected to a strip and body cavity search at Central Booking by two female Corrections Department employees, in accordance with a City policy of strip-searching all arrestees, and without any reasonable suspicion.  Plaintiff was released on her own recognizance the following day and the charges against her were eventually dropped.  Plaintiff was traumatized and humiliated, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, entered therapy, and took antidepressants.</p><p>On July 17, 1998, Defendants offered Plaintiff $25,001 plus reasonable attorney's fees accrued up to that date.  Plaintiff did not accept the settlement offer.</p><p>On April 26, 1999, Plaintiff settled her claims against her cousin for $2,500.</p><p>On May 7, 1999, the United States District Court (Judge Robert P. Patterson, Jr.) awarded plaintiff $19,645 in compensatory damages and $5,000,000 in punitive damages against the city according to a jury verdict following a three day jury trial.  The Court granted a directed verdict for Plaintiff regarding the strip-search.  The Court found that Defendant's strip-search policy violated the Fourth Amendment and there was no evidence the officers believed Plaintiff concealed contraband.  The jury found for Defendants on Plaintiff's claims of unlawful arrest, excessive force, and battery.</p><p>Defendant appealed award of punitive damages.</p><p>On June 15, 2000, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges Guido Calabresi, Robert Katzmann, Pierre N. Leval) reversed and remanded.  The Court held that the city was immune from punitive damages because municipalities are only responsible for punitive damages where taxpayers are directly responsible for perpetrating an outrageous abuse of constitutional rights.  Judges Calabresi and Katzmann filed separate concurring opinions. </p><p>Ciraolo v. City of New York, 216 F.3d 236 (2nd Cir. 2000).</p><p>Plaintiff moved for attorney's fees and costs.  Defendants cross-moved for costs incurred subsequent to their offer of pre-trial judgment.</p><p>On October 13, 2000, the District Court (Judge Patterson) granted these cross-motions.  The Court held that Plaintiff was liable for Defendants' costs from the date of their offer because their offer was more than her jury award.  Plaintiff was awarded attorney's fees and costs incurred prior to July 17, 1998, a total of $419,116.45.  Defendants were granted $8,038.40.  Ciraolo v. City of New York, No. Civ. 8208, 2000 WL 521180 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 13, 2000).</p><p>On November 13, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Plaintiff's petition for writ of certiorari.  Ciraolo v. City of New York, 531 U.S. 993 (2000).</p><p></p>",

Ms. Fontanella\nresides in the State of New York, County of New York at 220 West 13th Street, Apartment 3B.\n13. On March 7, 1997, Ms. Ciraolo filed a Notice of Claim with the Office of the\n¯\nComptroller of the City of New York. Said filing occurred within 90 days of the incidents giving rise\nto Ms. Ciraolo’s claims.\n14. On July l, 1997, Ms. Ciraolo presented herself for examination pursuant to General\nMunicipal Law § 50-h.\n15. At least thirty days have elapsed since Ms. Ciraolo filed her notice of claim pursuant\nto General Municipal Law § 50-e. To date, adjustment or payment thereof has been neglected or\n/I\nrefused.\n3\n\n16. This action is commenced within one year of the incidents giving rise to Ms. Ciraolo’s\nclaims.\nFACTS\n17. For the last seventeen years, plaintiffDebra Ciraolo has resided at 220\nWest 13th Street, Apartment 3D.\n18. In the fall of 1994, plaintiff learned that her cousin, defendant Julie Fontanella, had\nmisappropriated personal property that had belonged to plaintiff’s family. Plaintiff advised Ms.\nFontanella, in a telephone conversation, that she had learned of this. misappropriation, and that\nplaintiff did not desire to see Ms. Fontanella again.\n19. A year-and-a-half later, on or about March 27, 1996, defendant Fontanella moved into\n220 West 13~ Street, Apartment 3B, on the same floor as Ms. Ciraolo’s apartment. Ms. Fontanella\nappeared at Ms. Ciraolo\"s front door, informed her that she had just moved in, and stated that \"I’m\ngoing to get you.\"\n20. On March 28, 1996, Ms. Ciraolo went to the 6th Precinct, Which is located at 233 West\n10lh Street, New York, New York, and filled out a domestic incident report concerning Ms.\nFontanella’s threat. The report described the conduct as \"aggravated harassment.\" Ms. Ciraolo\nindicated that she did not want her cousin arrested. She was referredto Family Court of the State\nof New York, County of New York, for a possible order of protection, by Esther Ward, who, upon\ninformation and belief was then a Police Detective in charge of domestic cases at the 6th Precinct. Ms.\nCiraolo also consulted with Police Detective Paul Suarez, who was then assigned to the 6’h Precinct,\n!,,\nalOout bringing her complaint in Family Court.\n\n21. On April 19, 1996, plaintiff filed a petition with the Family Court alleging that defendant\nFontanella had harassed plaintiff by moving next door and threatening \"to get\" her. On that same\ndate, Family Court Judge Ruth Jane Zuckerman issued a Temporary Order of Protection on behalf\nof petitioner Ms. Ciraolo against respondent Ms. Fontanella, which specified that Ms. Fontanella \"is\nexcluded from apartment 3D at 220 West 13th Street.\"\n22. On April 30, 1996, Ms. Ciraolo went to the 6th Precinct and filled out another domestic\nincident report because a man standing by defendant Fontanella’s doorway, whom Ms. Ciraolo\nbelieved to be a friend of Ms. Fontanella, had glared at her in a threatening manner.\n23.    On May 17, 1996, Ms. Ciraolo and Ms. Fontanella appeared in Family Court\n---concerning Ms. Ciraolo’s Petition. The Order of Protection was extended until June 21, 1996.\nDefendant Fontanella also advised Police Detective Paul Suarez, that she would move out of 220\nWest 13th Street at the termination of Ms. Fontanella’s lease, in March 1997. Detective Suarez\nadvised Ms. Ciraolo of Ms. Fontanella’s statement to him.\n24. On or about May 18, 1996, Ms. Fontanella also advised Ms. Ciraolo that Ms. Fontanella\nwould move out of their apartment building, 220 West 13th Street.\n25. On June 21, 1996, Ms. Ciraolo agreed to withdraw her Petition in return for Ms.\nFontanella’s verbal agreement that Ms. Fontanella would move out of their apartment building, 220\nWest 13thStreet, by the end of March 1997. Ms. Fontanella stated her agreement to move in the\npresence of Judge Zuckerman’s assistant. Ms. ciraolo also prepared a document memorializing this\nagreement.\n¯ ’    26. Detective Suarez asked for and was provided with a copy of the agreement between Ms.\nCiraolo and Ms. Fontanella. On information and belief, he filed the document at the 6’h Precinct.\n5\n\n27. In January 1997, Ms. Ciraolo asked Ms. Fontanella whether.she would comply with her\nagreement to move out of their building. Ms. Fontanella became very agitated and told Ms. Ciraolo\nthat \"You are crazy.\" Ms. Ciraolo also placed a copy of the document memorializing the agreement\nin an envelope and slipped it under Ms. Fontanella’s apartment door.\n28. Thereat~er, during the week of January 10, 1997, Ms. Ciraolo called the 6’h Precinct to\nadvise that she had court papers to be served on Ms. Fontanella. The papers were for mediation at\na hearing to be conducted on January 27, 1997.\n29. Subsequently, on or about Friday, January 17, 1997~ Ms. Ciraolo received a message on\nher residential answering machine from defendant Detective Christin Morgillo asking Ms. Ciraolo to\n-~.call her.\n30. Ms. Ciraolo returned the call the same day. Detective Morgilio stated that \"There- ai~ ......... .\nsome things I need to speak to you about. I think you need to come down [to the 6th Precinct].\" She\nfurther indicated that the matter involved Ms. Fontanella and asked if Ms. Ciraolo had put something\nunder her cousin’s door. Ms. Ciraolo responded that the matter was known to the Precinct and\nknown to Family Court, and that it would not be convenient for her tO come to the precinct before\nthe following Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, January 20, 21 or 22\"~. ’Detective Morgillo said that\nshe would get back in touch with Ms. Ciraolo.\n31. On Tuesday, January 21, 1997, in the late at’ternoon, defendant Morgillo and another\npolice officer appeared at Ms. Ciraolo’s apartment door. Defendant Morgilio told Ms. Ciraolo to\naccompany them to the 6~’ Precinct. When Ms. Ciraolo refused to go, defendant Morgillo stated that\n\"If you don’t come, I am going to come back with a warrant. I am going to have a police car outside.\nI am going to have your neighbors see you taken out of the building.\" Defendant Morgillo tried to\n6\n\nplace her foot in plaintiff’s door and appeared to be trying to enter, while plaintiff.pressed the door\nshut. Defendant Morgillo further stated that \"I am going to put you in j~il with prostitutes and drug\naddicts. I am going to ruin your career. I am going to be back and ha~deuffyou and take you out\nof the building in front of your neighbors. I will have a police car outside waiting for you.\" Ms.\nMorgillo and the other officer then left.\n32. Ms. Ciraolo, who was shaken by this incident, telephoned a friend whom she was to meet\nfor dinner, Katherine Behrens. Ms. Behrens came to her apartment ~ at about 6:00 p.m.. At Ms.\nCiraolo’s suggestion, they drove to the 6th Precinct and arrived there a~t about 6:20 p.m.\n33. Ms. Ciraolo told a police officer at the precinct that Detective Morgillo had threatened\n.... to get an arrest warrant against her, and asked to see Detective Morgillo. Detective Morgillo came\ndownstairs and asked if Ms. Behrens was Ms. Ciraolo’s attorney. When she responded negatively,\nDetective Morgillo stated that \"’She doesn’t need any mouthpiece. She ain’t going nowhere tonight.\"\n34. At about 6:45 p.m. Ms. Ciraolo accompanied Detective Morgillo upstairs. Detective\nMorgillo directed here to empty her pockets and to take off.her coat. After Ms. Ciraolo complied,\nDetective Morgillo frisked her, and said that she was under arrest. Ms.:.Ciraolo asked what she had\nbeen arrested for. However, detective Morgillo did not respond. Rather, she asked Ms. Ciraolo for\npersonal information including her name, address, and social security number. Ms. Ciraolo provided\nthis information. Then Detective Morgil[o asked for her height and weight. Ms. Ciraolo refused to\nanswer. Detective Morgillo became very hostile and grabbed Ms. Ciraolo roughly by her fight arm,\nand pulled her from her seat. She said that \"You want to be difficult. I’ll make it difficult.\"\nDetective Morgillo locked Ms. Ciraolo in a holding cell in the precinct. Ms. Ciraolo remained locked\nin the cell for three hours, from about 7:00 p.m. to about 10:00 p.m.\n7\n\n35. After 10 p.m., Ms. Ciraolo was taken from the cell and photographed. Detective\nMorgillo handcuffed Ms. Ciraolo and brought her downstairs, where the h’andcuffs were removed and\nshe was fingerprinted. Then Detective Morgillo handcuffed Ms. Ciraol0 again.\n36. Then, with handcuffs on her, she was placed in a van and brought to 100 Centre Street.\nThere she was placed on a line with other women in handcuffs. The handcuffs were removed, and she\nwas taken to see a doctor, who questioned her about her medical background.\n37. Then Ms. Ciraolo was taken to a cell in which two female employees of the Police\nDepartment, Jane Does 1 and 2, asked her if she was carrying and drugs or weapons. When Ms.\nCiraolo responded in the negative, they\" threatened that \"If we find anything you are gonna be in\ntrouble.\"\n38. Jane Does 1 and 2 ordered Ms. Ciraolo to strip offall of her clothes, which she did under\nduress. They inspected her clothing.\n39. Jane Does 1 and 2 then ordered Ms. Ciraolo, who was naked, to squat and cough, which\nshe did. They thereby subjected her to a body cavity search.\n40. Ms. Ciraolo was permitted to put her clothing back on. She was taken to another cell\nwith a group of women with whom she remained for the rest of the nigh,t, and until she was released\nat about 3:30 p.m. on January 22, 1997.\n41: At no time between her arrest, and her release the next day, did any of the defendants\ninform Ms. Ciraolo of her Miranda rights or of what she had been arrested for.\n42. Ms. Ciraolo learned from her attorney Richard Rosencranz that her cousin, defendant\nF0ntanella had filed a complaint against her for harassment, and that was the basis for her arrest.\n43. The Court ordered Ms. Ciraolo to return and appear in Criminal Court in thirty days.\n\n44. At the end of the thirty days, in February 1997, Ms. Ciraolo and her counsel appeared\nin Criminal Court. The Assistant District Attorney requested another thirty day adjournment because\nhe allegedly had not finished investigating the matter. The Court granted the adjournment.\n45. On two separate occasions between January 21, 1997, a, nd March 19, 1997, Police\nOfficers came to Ms. Ciraolo’s apartment, and alleged that they had received anonymous complaints\nabout noise coming from her apartment. On both occasions the Police Officers leR after having\nspoken to Ms. Ciraolo, who indicated that she was alone and that there had been no such noise. In\nfact, there had been no disturbance or noise which warranted the Police Officers coming to her\napartment. Upon information and belief, defendant Julie Fontanella made false complaints to the\n¯ --Police Department that caused the Police Officers to go to Ms. Ciraolo’s apartment.\n46. On March 19, 1997, Ms. Ciraolo and her counsel made their third appearance in Criminal\nCourt. The Court dismissed the complaint against Ms. Ciraolo.\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Defendant Morgillo and Municipal Defendants and Defendant Fontanella --False Arrest)\n47. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 46,\nas if fully set forth herein.\n48. On January21, 1997, at the instigation of Julie Fontanella, Detective Christin\nMorgillo, arrested Ms. Ciraolo and placed her in handcuffs.\n49. Defendants Fontanella and Morgillo did not have probable cause to believe that Ms.\nCiraolo committed a crime. Ms. Ciraolo did not engage in any conduct that warranted her arrest or\ndetention¯\n9\n\n50.    As a result of the conduct of defendants, Ms. Ciraolo was detained, and at all times\nknew she was detained. Moreover, Ms. Ciraolo did not consent to her detention.\n51. Because defendants arrested Ms. Ciraolo without probable cause, their arrest of Ms.\nCiraolo was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution.                                   .~\n52. As a result of her arrest, Ms. Ciraolo suffered, and conti0ues to suffer, psychological\nharm and loss of earnings.\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Defendant Morgil!o--Excessive Force)\nPlaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 52 as\nif fully set forth herein.                                     ~\n54. On January 21, 1997, defendant Morgillo arrested Ms. Ciraolo and placed her in\nhandcuffs. In effectuating her arrest, defendant Morgillo used more force than Was necessary to place\nthe handcuffs on Ms. Ciraolo, and bruised her arm.\n55.    As Ms. Ciraolo’s behavior provided no justification for his conduct, the conduct of\ndefendant Morgillo was unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the United States Constitution.\n56. As a result of defendant Morgillo’s conduct, Ms. Ciraol’o suffered physical injury to\nher arm, as well as psychological injury.\n10\n\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Defendant Jane Does 1 and 2--Unlawful Search and Seizure)\n57.    Plaintiffrepeats and realleges the allegations Contained in paragraphs 1 through 56 as\nif fully set forth herein.\n58. On January 21, 1997 defendants Jane Roes 1 and 2 conducted a body cavity search\nof Ms. Ciraolo. In conducting the strip search of Ms. Ciraolo defendants knew, or should have\nknown, that said search was unlawful.\n59. Defendants Jane Roes knew, or should have known, that no circumstance existed to\nconduct a body cavity search of Ms. Ciraolo. Ms. Ciraolo was arrested solely for harassment. She\ndid not engage in any threatening behavior. She posed no risk to herself, any member of the NYPD,\nor any other person in police custody. ..................\n60.    Prior to conducting the strip search and body cavity search of Ms. Ciraolo, defendants\ndid not conduct any other less intrusive search in order to determine whether Ms. Ciraolo was armed\nor in the possession of contraband.\n61. As no reason existed to conduct the thoroughly intrusive invasion of Ms. Ciraolo’s\nperson, the conduct of defendants was unreasonable within the meaning o~ the Fourth and Fourteenth\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.                 .\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF\n(Municipal Defendants--Unlawful Search and Seizure)\n62.

One such policy authorizes strip searches and body cavity searchs of persons taken\ninto police custody as a result of an arrest.\n65. In causing the strip search and body cavity search of Ms. Ciraolo, defendants acted\npursuant to established policy of the Municipal Defendants.         ,..\n66. The established policy of the Municipal Defendants caused the violation of Ms.\nCiraolo’s constitutional rights protected by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution.\n-- 67.

Weiner, New York, NY, for Plaintiff-Appellee.\nJulian L. Kalkstein, Office of the Corporation Counsel of the City of New York, New York, N.Y. (Michael D. Hess,\nCorporation Counsel, and Larry A. Sonnenshein, on the brief), for Defendants-Appellants.\nBefore: LEVAL, CALABRESI, and KATZMANN, Circuit Judges.\nJudges CALABRESI and KATZMANN file separate concurring opinions.\nCALABRESI, Circuit Judge:\nAfter a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Robert P. Patterson, Jr., \nJ.), plaintiff-appellee Debra Ciraolo was awarded $19,645 in compensatory damages and $5,000,000 in punitive\ndamages against defendant-appellant the City of New York (the \"City\"), in her suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for, \ninter alia, an unlawful strip search of her person. The City now appeals the award of punitive damages, and, for\nthe following reasons, we reverse.\nI\nIn January 1997, following a complaint by her neighbor, with whom she was apparently having a legal dispute,\nDebra Ciraolo was arrested for aggravated harassment in the second degree, a misdemeanor. Ciraolo was taken\nto the police station and then to Central Booking, where she was subjected to a strip and body cavity search by\ntwo female Corrections Department employees. Ciraolo was ordered to strip naked and made to bend down and\ncough while she was visually inspected. After spending the night in jail, she was released on her own\nrecognizance; the charges against her were subsequently dismissed. Ciraolo was traumatized by the entire\nexperience, and particularly by the humiliation of the strip search. Diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder,\nshe entered therapy and began taking antidepressants.\nThe search of Ciraolo was not an isolated incident. Rather, it was in accordance with an established City policy of\nstrip-searching all arrestees, including misdemeanants, whether or not there was reasonable suspicion that the\narrestee possessed contraband. In July 1996, the City's Correction Department had adopted \"guidelines [for] the\nacceptance of all Police Cases for the Manhattan Court Division,\" providing that \"[a]ll police prisoners received\n238 shall be strip search[ed] by the officer assigned to the search post.\" In *238 October 1996, the Executive Officer\nof the Manhattan Detention Complex implemented the guidelines by sending a memo to all personnel ordering\nthat, \"[e]ffective immediately, all female police prisoners arriving at this facility . . . be strip searched.\" Accordingly,\nwhen Ciraolo was arrested in early 1997, she was strip-searched as a matter of course, despite the conceded\nlack of any reasonable suspicion for the intrusive and demeaning search.\nCiraolo brought suit under § 1983 against the City, the police department, and the individual police officers\ninvolved in her arrest and search, claiming that she had been falsely arrested, that the police had employed\n\nexcessive force during the arrest, and that her strip search violated the Fourth Amendment. She also alleged\nbattery, in violation of state law.\nThe district court found that the City's policy of strip-searching all arrestees regardless of the existence of\nreasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment, in contravention of the clearly established law of this\nCircuit that \"the Fourth Amendment precludes prison officials from performing strip/body cavity searches of\narrestees charged with misdemeanors or other minor offenses unless the officials have a reasonable suspicion\nthat the arrestee is concealing weapons or other contraband.\" Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.1986).\nBecause the parties had stipulated to the existence of the City's policy of strip-searching all arrestees, and\nbecause there was no evidence that Ciraolo was believed to be concealing contraband, the court instructed the\njury that the City was liable for any injuries the jury found to have been proximately caused by the strip search.\nAfter soliciting letter briefs from the parties on the issue of punitive damages, the district court concluded that, in\nthis case, punitive damages were available against the City because the strip search was pursuant to an official\nCity policy that was contrary to the settled law of the Circuit. Accordingly, over the City's objection, the court\ncharged the jury that punitive damages could be awarded against the City if they found that the City had acted\nmaliciously or wantonly. In doing so, the court told the jury to consider whether compensatory damages would be\nadequate to punish the City and to deter future unlawful conduct.\nThe jury found in favor of the defendants on Ciraolo's claims of unlawful arrest, excessive force, and battery. It\nconcluded, however, that the City had acted in wanton disregard of Ciraolo's rights when she was strip-searched,\nand awarded her $5,000,000 in punitive damages, as well as $19,645 in compensatory damages.\nII\nOn appeal, the City does not contest the district court's holding that the strip-search policy was clearly\nunconstitutional under this Circuit's decision in Weber. Nor does it challenge the award of compensatory\ndamages to Ciraolo. Rather, it contests only the award of punitive damages, arguing that the award was\nforeclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 101 S.Ct.\n2748, 69 L.Ed.2d 616 (1981), which held that, ordinarily, municipalities are immune from punitive damages under\n§ 1983. In her turn, Ciraolo argues that Newport, in a footnote, permitted municipalities to be charged punitive\ndamages in cases where \"the taxpayers are directly responsible for perpetrating an outrageous abuse of\nconstitutional rights,\" id. at 267 n. 29, 101 S.Ct. 2748, and that her case falls within this exception. We are, of\ncourse, bound by Newport. And we believe that the only fair reading of that decision, and of the footnote on which\nCiraolo relies, mandates a conclusion that punitive damages are not available to her.\nIn Newport, a musical concert promoter, Fact Concerts, Inc., brought suit against the City of Newport, Rhode\n239 Island, under § 1983 for a violation of its First Amendment rights. Fact Concerts had entered *239 into a contract\nwith Newport to present a jazz festival. Shortly before the festival, Fact Concerts hired the group Blood, Sweat\nand Tears to replace an act that had dropped out. See id. at 250, 101 S.Ct. 2748. Under the impression that\nBlood, Sweat and Tears was a \"rock\" group and that it might attract \"a rowdy and undesirable audience,\" id.,\nNewport tried to prevent the group from performing; eventually, the City Council voted to cancel the contract, a\ndecision reported in the local media, see id. at 250-52, 101 S.Ct. 2748. Although Fact Concerts obtained an\ninjunction from a state court allowing the festival to proceed, ticket sales were off substantially due to the adverse\npublicity. See id. at 252, 101 S.Ct. 2748. At trial, Fact Concerts won $200,000 in punitive damages against\nNewport, as well as other damages against the individual officials. See id. at 253, 101 S.Ct. 2748.\nThe Supreme Court reversed the award of punitive damages. See id. at 271, 101 S.Ct. 2748. In doing so, the\nCourt applied \"a two-part approach\" to interpreting § 1983. Id. at 259, 101 S.Ct. 2748. It considered, first, the\nextent of municipal immunity at common law and the legislative history relevant to § 1983, and, second, the\npolicies behind punitive damages and their compatibility with the purpose of § 1983. See id. at 258-59, 101 S.Ct.\n2748.\nIn its historical inquiry, the Court reviewed nineteenth-century tort cases, and concluded that by 1871, when §\n1983 was enacted, \"municipal immunity from punitive damages was well established at common law.\" Id. at 263,\n\n101 S.Ct. 2748. Proceeding on the premise that Congress would have been fully aware of this common-law\nimmunity and would have been explicit had it intended to abolish the immunity, the Court turned to the legislative\nhistory of § 1983 to see if any such intent could be divined. See id. at 263-64, 101 S.Ct. 2748. Because, in fact,\nthere was almost no legislative history surrounding the passage of § 1983 itself, the majority looked to the debate\nthat took place over the proposed Sherman amendment to the Civil Rights Act that included § 1983. The\nSherman amendment would have made municipalities liable for compensatory damages for injuries caused by\nmob violence. See id. at 264, 101 S.Ct. 2748. Noting that, as one supporter said on the floor of the House, the\namendment was not intended \"as a punishment for the county,\" but as \"mutual insurance\" to \"indemnify the\ninjured party,\" the Court concluded that \"a Congress having no intention of permitting punitive awards against\nmunicipalities in the explicit context of the Sherman amendment would [not] have meant to expose municipal\nbodies to such novel liability sub silentio\" (and more broadly) under § 1983. Id. at 265, 101 S.Ct. 2748.\nThe Court then turned to the question whether the two major policy arguments for punitive damages00deterrence\n97\nand retribution00would be advanced by assessing punitive damages against cities. It concluded that punitive\n97\ndamages against cities were not justified by a policy of deterrence because (1) it was unclear that municipal\nofficials would be deterred by the prospect of damages borne by the taxpayers; (2) voters would, nonetheless, be\nlikely to vote wrongdoing officials out of office absent punitive damages, both because they had done wrong and\nbecause of the possibility of compensatory damages; (3) punitive damages assessed directly against the\noffending officials would be a more effective means of deterrence; and (4) punitive damages could \"create a\nserious risk to the financial integrity\" of cities. Id. at 270, 101 S.Ct. 2748; see id. at 268-70, 101 S.Ct. 2748.\nNor, the Court opined, was the goal of retribution furthered by punitive damages, since such damages would\npunish only the innocent taxpayers. \"[P]unitive damages imposed on a municipality are in effect a windfall to a\nfully compensated plaintiff, and are likely accompanied by an increase in taxes or a reduction of public services\n240 for the citizens footing the bill. Neither reason nor justice suggests that *240 such retribution should be visited\nupon the shoulders of blameless or unknowing taxpayers.\" Id. at 267, 101 S.Ct. 2748. Accordingly, the Court held\nthat \"a municipality is immune from punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\" Id. at 271, 101 S.Ct. 2748.\nThe Court did, however, indicate that in some rare cases, the goal of retribution might be furthered by punitive\ndamages against a municipality. In a footnote, the majority mused, \"It is perhaps possible to imagine an extreme\nsituation where the taxpayers are directly responsible for perpetrating an outrageous abuse of constitutional\nrights. Nothing of that kind is presented by this case. Moreover, such an occurrence is sufficiently unlikely that we\nneed not anticipate it here.\" Id. at 267 n. 29, 101 S.Ct. 2748.\nCiraolo relies on footnote 29 for her claim that punitive damages are warranted in her case. She reads the\nfootnote as creating an \"outrageous abuse\" exception to the general municipal immunity established by Newport,\nand contends that the City's strip-search policy is sufficiently outrageous to fall within that exception. We believe\nthat Ciraolo misapprehends footnote 29.\nFootnote 29 must be read as part of the Court's discussion of the retributive function of punitive damages. As\nsuch, it elaborates on the Court's conclusion that it is unjust to punish the taxpayers for tortious conduct by\nmunicipal officials, because the taxpayers are not normally directly responsible for that conduct. The footnote\nsuggests that, in the rare case where the taxpayers are directly responsible for an outrageous violation of a\nplaintiff's constitutional rights, it may well be just for the taxpayers to bear the burden of punitive damages. To the\nextent that footnote 29 creates an exception to Newport's general rule against punitive damages, therefore, it is\nnot an exception for particularly outrageous abuses, as Ciraolo would have it, but rather an exception for\noutrageous abuses for which the taxpayers are directly responsible.\nThe footnote does not tell us when, in the Court's judgment, taxpayers could be held to be directly responsible for\na municipal policy. Although it could be argued that, to the extent that they are also voters who play a part in\nchoosing municipal officials, taxpayers are always responsible for municipal policies, such responsibility is clearly\ntoo indirect to give rise to liability for punitive damages under the logic of Newport. Footnote 29 seems, instead,\nto contemplate a much more immediate connection between the taxpayers' behavior and the unconstitutional\nmunicipal policy, perhaps00for example00as close a link as a referendum in which the taxpayers directly adopted\n97 97\nthe invalid policy.\n\nWe are, moreover, aware of no case in which a court of appeals has upheld an award of punitive damages\nagainst a municipality premised on footnote 29. Indeed, very few cases have even discussed the footnote,\nalthough the First and Fifth Circuits have offered considered analyses of it. See Webster v. City of Houston, 689\nF.2d 1220 (5th Cir.1982),rev'd on other grounds on reh'g,735 F.2d 838 (5th Cir. 1984) (en banc); Heritage\nHomes of Attleboro, Inc. v. Seekonk Water Dist., 670 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1982). In Heritage Homes, the First Circuit\nappeared to acknowledge that the footnote might apply in a case where the taxpayers voted in favor of an\nunconstitutional policy, but nevertheless declined to allow punitive damages where residents of the Seekonk\nWater District had engaged in \"blatantly raci[st] discussions\" before voting to exclude from access to water a\nhousing development owned by developers willing to sell houses to black families. Id. at 2. The court reasoned\nthat only a tiny minority of Water District members had actually voted to exclude Heritage Homes, and that\n\"[a]bsent widespread knowledgeable participation by taxpayers . . . to award punitive damages against the Water\n241 District would not serve the purposes of punishment or deterence. . . . *241 The actions of a small claque of\nvoters would burden several thousand non-participants, many of whom presumably were unaware of the entire\ncontroversy.\" Id.\nIn Webster, the Fifth Circuit addressed the potential applicability of footnote 29 in a § 1983 suit brought by the\nparents of Randy Webster, a seventeen-year-old boy shot and killed by Houston police after a car chase00while\n97\nhe was unarmed and attempting to surrender. The police had attempted to cover up the shooting by planting a\ngun in the boy's hand, and it came out at trial that the Houston police had an unwritten custom of carrying \"throw-\ndowns,\" guns or knives to be planted near suspects who had been shot in dubious circumstances. After trial, the\njury awarded the Websters, inter alia, $200,000 in punitive damages to be assessed on the city. See Webster,\n689 F.2d at 1223. Reversing this award of punitive damages, the court stated:\nThe plight of Randy Webster, however reprehensible, however tragic, does not rise to the level of\noutrageous conduct to which Justice Blackmun referred [in footnote 29]. . . . [Section 1983 was]\nenacted in a time of frightening violence, to ensure the most basic constitutional rights of citizens\nin southern states. If the members of Congress who drafted that Act did not intend to establish a\nrule of punitive damages, we believe that it would take a far more serious violation than that we\nconfront to ground punitive damages against Houston.\nId. at 1229. The Webster majority, in contrast to the First Circuit, thus focused on the outrageousness of the\nparticular conduct at issue, rather than the extent to which taxpayers could be held directly responsible for it.\nIn a powerfully written concurrence, Judge Goldberg disagreed with the majority's interpretation of footnote 29. In\nhis view, \"rather than creating an exception, this footnote precludes any exception.\" Id. at 1231 (Goldberg, J.,\nconcurring). He commented that \"[i]t might be possible to read footnote 29 as allowing an exception where the\nelectorate of a political unit votes affirmatively in favor of outrageous conduct,\" although \"[e]ven in that situation\nthere would be some difficulty in assessing damages where a minority of the electorate voted against the\noutrageous conduct.\" Id. at 1231 n. 1. Nevertheless, he took the thrust of the footnote to be essentially a\nbolstering of Justice Blackmun's argument that allowing punitive damages against a municipality would not\nfurther their traditional retributive purpose. See id. at 1231. Although he believed that the Supreme Court's\nholding in Newport swept too broadly, and was both unwarranted and unwise in a case like Randy Webster's, see\nid. at 1231-32, he therefore concurred in the judgment.\nWe are inclined, like the First Circuit, to the view that any exception envisioned in footnote 29 must be an\nexception for cases in which the taxpayers are directly responsible00in their role as voters00for the adoption of an\n97 97\nunconstitutional municipal policy, rather than an exception for especially outrageous abuses of constitutional\nrights. If, for example, a town adopted, by a unanimous vote, a referendum establishing an unconstitutional rule,\n[1]\nwe can see no reason in the policies discussed in Newport why punitive damages ought not to be awarded.\nBut such a case is not before us today. (And so nothing we here say about the applicability of footnote 29 to a\nreferendum can be binding on any future court presented with the question.) Rather, we are here faced with the\nmuch more common situation in which an unconstitutional policy has been adopted by municipal officials without\n242 any clear endorsement of the policy by the electorate. In such circumstances, while we emphatically deplore *242\n\nthe City's conduct in adopting a policy that this Circuit had earlier clearly held unconstitutional, the taxpayers\nthemselves cannot be held to be responsible for the policy under the reasoning of Newport.\nThe district court, while not relying explicitly on footnote 29, concluded that Newport did not preclude the award of\npunitive damages to Ciraolo because the Newport cause of action stemmed from one improper action by\nNewport officials, while in Ciraolo's case the City had adopted a policy contrary to the clearly established law of\nthis Circuit. We sympathize with the district court's desire to allow the jury to award punitive damages in this case.\nLike it, we are seriously troubled by the City's adoption of a policy we had previously held to be unconstitutional.\nNevertheless, we conclude that the district court misread Newport, and that the distinction drawn by the court has\nlittle force in this context.\nMunicipal liability under § 1983 occurs, if at all, at the level of policy-making, and cannot be premised on a theory\nof respondeat superior. See Monell v. Department of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d\n611 (1978) (\"[A] local government may not be sued under § 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or\nagents. Instead, it is when execution of a government's policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury that the government\nas an entity is responsible under § 1983.\"). As a result, the fact that Ciraolo's strip search occurred because of an\nestablished City policy in no way distinguishes her case from other § 1983 cases in which municipal liability is\nestablished, and cannot suffice to place this case within the seemingly narrow exception carved out by footnote\n29.\nAccordingly, and despite what might be the salutary effects of punitive damages in a case such as this, we are\n[2]\nconstrained by the Supreme Court's holding in Newport to reverse the award of punitive damages.\n* * * * * *\nThe award of punitive damages against the City is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED to the district court\nfor entry of judgment in accordance with this opinion.\nCALABRESI, Circuit Judge, concurring:\nAlthough the result the court reaches today is compelled by Supreme Court precedent, I respectfully suggest that\nthe policies behind punitive damages and the purpose of § 1983 would be better furthered by a different\noutcome. I write separately to explain why I believe this to be so. Cf. Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187, 196,\n79 S.Ct. 666, 3 L.Ed.2d 729 (1959) (Brennan, J., concurring in his own majority opinion).\nI\nThe purpose of § 1983 is \"not only to provide compensation to the victims of past abuses, but to serve as a\ndeterrent against future constitutional deprivations, as well.\" Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 651,\n100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980). Indeed, the Court in Newport\nrecognized that punitive damages serve the dual purpose of deterrence and retribution. See Newport, 453 U.S. at\n266-67, 101 S.Ct. 2748. Nevertheless, and as discussed above, the Court concluded that \"the deterrence\n243 rationale of § 1983 does not justify making punitive damages available against municipalities,\" id. at 268, *243\n101 S.Ct. 2748, because (1) it was unclear that municipal officials would be deterred by the prospect of damages\nborne by the taxpayers; (2) voters would still be likely to vote wrongdoing officials out of office absent punitive\ndamages, both because they had done wrong and because of the possibility of compensatory damages; (3)\npunitive damages assessed directly against the offending officials would be a more effective means of\ndeterrence; and (4) punitive damages could \"create a serious risk to the financial integrity\" of cities. Id. at 270,\n101 S.Ct. 2748; see id. at 268-70, 101 S.Ct. 2748.\nThe Court's analysis, however, neglected at least one aspect of the deterrence function of punitive damages00an\n97\naspect underscored by this case. Punitive damages can ensure that a wrongdoer bears all the costs of its\nactions, and is thus appropriately deterred from causing harm, in those categories of cases in which\n\ncompensatory damages alone result in systematic underassessment of costs, and hence in systematic\nunderdeterrence.\n[1]\nIt is easy to show why this is so. A rational actor  will undertake an activity when the benefits of doing so exceed\nthe costs. In doing so, it will make some sort of formal or informal, spoken or unspoken, cost-benefit analysis,\nbased on the information it possesses, to determine if a particular activity is worth its price. Such an analysis\ncannot be even roughly accurate unless approximately all the costs of the activity are borne by the actor. When\nthe perceived benefits of an activity accrue to the actor, but some significant part of the costs is borne by others,\nthe cost-benefit analysis will necessarily be distorted. In such a case, the actor will have an incentive to\nundertake activities whose social costs exceed their social benefits. In other words, the actor will not be\n[2]\nadequately deterred from undesirable activities. And society will suffer.\nOne goal of the tort system, therefore, is to ensure that actors bear the costs of their activities. See, e.g.,\nCalabresi, supra note 4. And that is also a goal of § 1983, which, as the Supreme Court has noted, was designed\nto deter constitutional torts by making the tortfeasors liable in damages to their victims. See Newport, 453 U.S. at\n258, 101 S.Ct. 2748; Owen, 445 U.S. at 651, 100 S.Ct. 1398.\nIn some circumstances, compensatory damages alone will be enough to promote an adequate cost-benefit\nanalysis. In other cases, however, compensatory damages will not come close to equaling all the costs properly\nattributable to the activity. Costs may not be sufficiently reflected in compensatory damages for several reasons,\nmost of which go to the fact that not all injured parties are in fact compensated by the responsible injurer. For\nexample, a victim may not realize that she has been harmed by a particular actor's conduct, or may not be able\nto identify the person or entity who has injured her. See, e.g., Polinsky & Shavell, supra note 4, at 888. Where the\ninjurer makes active efforts to conceal the harm, this problem is of course exacerbated. Moreover, even if a victim\nis aware of her injury and is able to identify its cause, she may not bring suit. A person will be unlikely to sue if the\ncosts of doing so00including the time, effort, and stress associated with bringing a lawsuit00outweigh the\n97 97\n244 compensation she can expect *244 to receive. A victim is especially unlikely to sue, therefore, in cases where the\nprobable compensatory damages are relatively low. See id. As a result, a harm that affects many people, but\neach only to a limited degree, will generally be given inadequate weight if only compensatory damages are\nassessed.\nIn addition, some victims will not sue even if the damages they could expect to receive would exceed the costs of\nsuing. Victims will differ greatly in their knowledge of and access to the legal process, and those who are\nrelatively poor and unsophisticated, as a practical matter, are frequently unable to bring suit to redress their\ninjuries even if those injuries are grave. A harm that disproportionately affects such victims, therefore, is also\nparticularly likely not to be accurately reflected in compensatory damages.\nFor these and other like reasons, compensatory damages are, in wide categories of cases, an inaccurate\nmeasure of the true harm caused by an activity, and, as a result, making an injurer bear only such damages does\nnot provide adequate deterrence against socially harmful acts. In such circumstances, additional damages,\nassessed in the cases that are brought, may be an appropriate way of making the injurer bear all the costs\nassociated with its activities.\nThis idea is far from new. Many years ago, in an influential article that was in part responsible for his receipt of\nthe Nobel Memorial Prize in economics, Professor Becker pointed out that charging a thief the cost of what he\nhad stolen would not adequately deter theft unless the thief was caught every time. Since thieves will not always\nbe caught, they must be penalized by more than the cost of the items stolen on the occasions on which they are\ncaught. This \"multiplier\" is essential to render theft unprofitable and properly to deter it. See Becker, supra note 4.\nMore recently, scholars have recognized that punitive damages can serve the same function in tort law. See, e.g.,\nThomas C. Galligan, Jr., Augmented Awards: The Efficient Evolution of Punitive Damages, 51 La. L.Rev. 3\n(1990); Polinsky & Shavell, supra note 4.\nProfessors Polinsky and Shavell, for example, have argued that punitive damages should be assessed whenever\na tortfeasor has a significant likelihood of escaping liability, and have even suggested a formula (simpler to state\nthan to apply) for calculating such damages: total damages should equal the amount of loss in a particular case,\n\n[3]\nmultiplied by the inverse of the probability that the injurer will be found liable. See id. at 889. Thus, if the injurer\ncauses harm of $10,000, but will be found liable only one-fifth of the time, total damages00according to Polinsky\n97\nand Shavell00should equal $50,000 ($10,000 in compensatory damages and $40,000 in punitive damages). See\n97\nid. Use of such a multiplier, they argue, will cause damages to equal the total harm caused, forcing the injurer to\ntake into account all the costs of its activity and thus decreasing the likelihood that socially harmful activities will\n[4]\npersist. See id.\n245 *245 Such a conception of punitive damages, again, is not new, and it has been recognized by courts as well as\nscholars. Indeed, the Supreme Court, considering punitive damages in a quite different context from that in \nNewport, acknowledged that in determining such punitive damages, it is proper to consider the extent to which\nthe tortfeasor might otherwise escape liability. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 582, 116\nS.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996) (noting that \"[a] higher ratio\" of punitive to compensatory damages \"may . . .\nbe justified in cases in which the injury is hard to detect\"); see also id. at 592-94, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring) (suggesting that \"punitive damages awards that, as a whole, would take from a wrongdoer the total\ncost of the harm caused\" might constrain potential arbitrariness and \"counsel[ ] more deferential review\" by\nappellate courts). In addition, the Seventh Circuit, in a § 1983 suit against an individual defendant, has explicitly\nendorsed the multiplier function of punitive damages. See Kemezy v. Peters, 79 F.3d 33, 35 (7th Cir.1996)\n(Posner, J.) (pointing out that \"[w]hen a tortious act is concealable, a judgment equal to the harm done by the act\nwill underdeter\" because the tortfeasor \"will not be confronted by the full social cost of his activity\"). Finally, Judge\nGoldberg, in his concurrence in Webster, offered a powerful critique of Newport's treatment of punitive damages\nand suggested that deterrence would be furthered by the assessment of punitive damages against municipalities\nin § 1983 actions where the municipal policy at issue is one that tends toward concealment of wrongdoing. See \nWebster, 689 F.2d at 1235-38 (Goldberg, J., concurring).\nAlthough widely accepted by economists and acknowledged by some courts, the multiplier function of punitive\ndamages has nonetheless been applied haphazardly at best. One reason this is so is that the twin goals of\ndeterrence and retribution are often conflated, rather than recognized as analytically distinct objectives. The term\n\"punitive damages\" itself contributes greatly to the confusion. For punitive damages, the term traditionally used\nfor damages beyond what is needed to compensate the individual plaintiff, improperly emphasizes the retributive\nfunction of such extracompensatory damages at the expense of their multiplier-deterrent function. It also fails\ntotally to explain the not unusual use of such damages in situations in which the injurer, though liable, was not\n[5]\nintentionally or wantonly wrongful.  A more appropriate name for extracompensatory damages assessed in\norder to avoid underdeterrence might be \"socially compensatory damages.\" For, while traditional compensatory\ndamages are assessed to make the individual victim whole, socially compensatory damages are, in a sense,\ndesigned to make society whole by seeking to ensure that all of the costs of harmful acts are placed on the liable\n[6]\nactor.\n246 *246 Indeed, it would not be inappropriate to disaggregate the retributive and deterrent functions of\nextracompensatory damages altogether and allow separate awards to further the two separate goals. In such a\nsystem, socially compensatory damages might be permitted in cases in which all the costs of a defendant's\n[7]\nactions were not before the court, whether or not the defendant's conduct was particularly blameworthy.  But a\nseparate award of punitive damages would be allowed only in cases where the defendant's conduct was\nsufficiently reprehensible to deserve punishment apart from whatever assessment was required to compensate\n[8]\nthe individual victim or society as a whole.\nThe majority in Newport raised the objection that \"punitive damages . . . are in effect a windfall to a fully\ncompensated plaintiff.\" Newport, 453 U.S. at 267, 101 S.Ct. 2748. It is likely that a feeling that such \"windfalls\"\nare not warranted00and are distributed arbitrarily among plaintiffs00lies, and properly so, behind much of the\n97 97\ncurrent distaste for punitive damages. Of course, socially compensatory damages will have an equivalent\ndeterrent effect on the injurer no matter whom they are paid to. As one commentator put it, \"[a]n efficient windfall\nis still efficient.\" Galligan, supra, at 58; see also Webster, 689 F.2d at 1237 n. 7 (Goldberg, J., concurring).\nNevertheless, the existence of such potential windfalls may well induce undesirable behavior on the part of\n247 victims and of their lawyers. And there is no good reason why socially compensatory damages should be *247\n\npaid to the individual plaintiff, at least beyond a relatively small part sufficient to induce the victim to undertake the\nexpense of pleading and proving them.\nIn fact, in order to achieve the goal of social compensation, as well as the goal of optimal deterrence, it would be\npreferable if such damages were paid into a fund that could then be applied to remedy some of the unredressed\nsocial harm stemming from the defendant's conduct. And some states have explicitly recognized this socially\ncompensatory function by mandating that at least a portion of punitive damages awards should go not to the\nplaintiff, but to the state treasury or to a specified fund. See BMW, 517 U.S. at 616-18, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (Ginsburg,\nJ., dissenting) (collecting state laws providing for allocation of punitive damages to state agencies). A similar\nmechanism could be employed in the case of socially compensatory damages assessed against municipalities.\n[9]\nII\nAs Judge Posner suggested in Kemezy, socially compensatory damages are anything but foreign to the goals of\n§ 1983. And the rationale for socially compensatory damages in the case of an individual defendant holds equally\ntrue where the defendant is a municipality. Indeed, the case before us shows especially vividly the possible utility\nof such socially compensatory damages. Here, the City of New York adopted a strip-search policy that it knew or\nclearly should have known was unconstitutional. Counsel for the City estimated at trial that about 65,000 people\narrested for misdemeanors had been subjected to strip searches under the policy. Under ordinary circumstances,\nvery few of those 65,000 victims would have been likely to sue, both because the compensatory damages they\nwould have received would have been relatively low and because they were no doubt, in the main, relatively poor\nand unsophisticated.\nAs one scholar has noted:\n[T]he conditions of constitutional tort litigation for harm caused by law enforcement officials are\nones in which the deterrent effect is likely to be on the low side. The potential plaintiffs, after all,\nare individuals who are in contact with the criminal justice system, generally as suspects or\ndefendants. Many are unlikely to bring suit for harm suffered, whether because of ignorance of\ntheir rights, poverty, fear of police reprisals, or the burdens of incarceration. Moreover, in many\ncases the harm suffered by individuals from the constitutional violation itself may be small, widely\ndispersed, and intangible, providing little incentive for potential plaintiffs to sue, especially given\n248 the lack of sympathy *248 that this group of plaintiffs can expect from the trier of fact.\nDaniel J. Meltzer, Deterring Constitutional Violations by Law Enforcement Officials: Plaintiffs and Defendants as\nPrivate Attorneys General, 88 Colum. L.Rev. 247, 284 (1988) (footnotes omitted). In such circumstances00which\n97\nare epitomized in the case before us00socially compensatory damages may well be necessary if, consistent with\n97\nthe goals of § 1983, constitutional violations are to be deterred adequately.\nSocially compensatory damages are, of course, not the only possible means of deterrence in such situations.\nTwo other approaches come readily to mind. Neither, however, is likely to suffice to achieve the purposes of §\n1983.\nFirst, one might think that an injunction, and the possibility of contempt sanctions for flouting it, would deter\nmunicipalities from engaging in repeated constitutional violations. Standing doctrine, however, generally\nprecludes a § 1983 plaintiff from obtaining injunctive relief unless she can demonstrate that she is likely to be\nsubjected to the same conduct in the future, a showing that can be very difficult to make. See City of Los Angeles\nv. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105-06, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (holding that a plaintiff injured on one\noccasion by a police chokehold has no standing to seek an injunction against such chokeholds).\nSecond, it is possible that where many people suffer a relatively small harm, they could bring a class action and\nobtain damages that would approximate the total harm caused by the constitutional violation. And, in fact, a class\naction has been brought against the City by the victims of the strip-search policy. See Benjamin Weiser, Strip-\nSearch Case Leaves City Facing a Bigger Liability, N.Y. Times, May 12, 1999, at A1. But class actions have their\n\nown limitations. For one thing, there are many situations in which the likelihood of escaping liability stems not\nfrom the high number of victims of an unconstitutional wrong, but from the municipal defendant's attempts to\nconceal that wrong. See Webster, 689 F.2d at 1235-38 (Goldberg, J., concurring). It may be, therefore, that a\nmunicipal defendant has a significant chance of escaping liability and yet the number of potential plaintiffs is not\ngreat enough to satisfy the numerosity requirement of Rule 23. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1). Moreover, use of the\nclass mechanism can result in compromising plaintiffs' autonomy and ignoring conflicts among class members.\nFinally, like individual plaintiffs, class-action plaintiffs face costs that might dissuade them from bringing suit,\nincluding the added cost of managing the class, and these may well offset the economies of scale achieved\nthrough a class action. All in all, there is little reason to think that class actions can, or should, be the sole or even\nthe principal vehicle for dealing with underdeterrence.\nOnce it is recognized that remedying underdeterrence is an appropriate function of extracompensatory damages\nagainst a municipality, and that it is a goal that can be separated from punishment, Newport's objections to\npunitive damages under § 1983 lose much of their force. First, the kind of socially compensatory damages I have\nbeen discussing would not punish \"blameless or unknowing taxpayers,\" Newport, 453 U.S. at 267, 101 S.Ct.\n2748, for they would not be punishment at all. Second, if deterrence is viewed not as an incidental byproduct of\npunishment, but as deriving instead from the placement of the relevant costs of a city policy on the city in order to\nencourage a more rational decisionmaking process, Newport's arguments that extracompensatory damages\nwould not be likely to deter cities also fall.\nThus, the Newport Court contended that it was unclear that municipal officials would be deterred by the prospect\nof damages borne by the taxpayers. See id. at 268-69, 101 S.Ct. 2748. But an analogous argument was long ago\n249 refuted with respect to corporations and to not-for-profit *249 institutions.[10] It is no more valid for governmental\nones. Assuming that a city is at least minimally rational in its decisionmaking, it will be better able to assess the\nrelative social costs and benefits of a particular municipal policy if it knows that it will bear all, rather than only\nsome, of the costs of that policy. Both a city's power to tax and its officials' ability to stay in office are limited by\npolitical considerations, and when taxpayers must pay more and get less in return they00like charitable donors or\n97\nbuyers of goods00will make their displeasure known.\n97\nSecond, the Court argued that voters would be likely to vote wrongdoing officials out of office even absent\npunitive damages, both because the officials had done wrong and because of the possibility of compensatory\ndamages. See id. at 269, 101 S.Ct. 2748. But, again, damages that are equal to the harm caused by a particular\nmunicipal policy would presumably encourage voters to call their elected representatives to account more often\nthan would damages that by definition represent only a small fraction of that harm.\nThird, the Court contended that punitive damages assessed directly against the offending officials would be a\nmore effective means of deterrence. See id. at 269-70, 101 S.Ct. 2748. But, in the case of a municipal policy for\nwhich no one official is primarily responsible, damages premised on individual guilt are unlikely to be efficacious. \nSee Webster, 689 F.2d at 1236-37 (Goldberg, J., concurring) (\"[A]t whom do we point the finger of guilt in the\ncase of tragic collective apathy?\"). Moreover, the incapacity of individual offending officials to pay significant\n[11]\ndamage awards inevitably limits such officials' responsiveness to the threat of suits.\n250 *250 Fourth, and finally, the Newport majority evinced concern that punitive damages could \"create a serious risk\nto the financial integrity\" of cities, in part because \"the unlimited taxing power of a municipality may have a\nprejudicial impact on the jury, in effect encouraging it to impose a sizable award.\" Newport, 453 U.S. at 270, 101\nS.Ct. 2748\n. I am not insensitive to the possibility that a very large award of damages could affect a city's finances. And it is\nfor that very reason00contrary to the Newport Court's first argument00that socially compensatory damages would\n97 97\nbe likely to prove an effective deterrent. See Webster, 689 F.2d at 1237 (Goldberg, J., concurring) (\"It is\nnecessary that the threatened damages cause some deprivation for the populace so that they will be nudged out\nof their blissful ignorance. . . .\"). Nevertheless, I emphasize that, in assessing the kind of damages that I have\nbeen discussing (in contrast to traditional punitive damages), it would not be proper for a trier of fact to take the\ncity's taxing power into account. The basis for socially compensatory damages is the multiplier effect, that is, the\nprobability that the city would otherwise escape liability for damages it actually caused, and not the depth of its\npockets. And this basis should be strictly enforced by the court in reviewing damage awards.\n\nBecause the Court in Newport focused on the difficulty with furthering the retributive goals of punitive damages in\nthe case of a municipality, and envisioned deterrence as an ancillary consequence of retribution, it did not\nexamine the possibility that socially compensatory, as opposed to traditional punitive, damages might comport\nboth with Congress's original intent and with the policies behind § 1983. As a lower court bound by Newport, it is\nnot for us to decide this question. Nevertheless, I respectfully suggest that the purpose of § 1983, to protect\nfederal constitutional rights against infringement by state actors, is not served when00as in the case before\n97\nus00the prospect of damages awarded pursuant to the statute manifestly fails to deter a municipality from\n97\nadopting a policy that it clearly knows or should know violates the Fourth Amendment.\nKATZMANN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part:\nI concur in the result reversing the award of punitive damages. I decline, however, to express a view as to the\nmeaning of footnote 29 in City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 267 n. 29, 101 S.Ct. 2748, 69\nL.Ed.2d 616 (1981), beyond the context of the case at hand. As my colleagues observe, the Supreme Court itself\nprovided little guidance as to what constitutes \"an extreme situation where the taxpayers are directly responsible\nfor perpetrating an outrageous abuse of constitutional rights.\" Id. I believe that there are too many complexities\nassociated with this idea to permit speculation with regard to a referendum situation not before us.\nAs my colleagues recognize, to the extent that footnote 29 creates an exception, any case justifying punitive\ndamages must satisfy a conjunctive, two-part test, both for direct responsibility and for outrageous abuse. Neither\nthe fact that Ciraolo's strip search occurred pursuant to an established policy adopted by the City of New York,\nnor that some taxpayers may have voted for the municipal officials responsible for adopting such policy, suffices\nto bring this case within the scope of any exception contemplated by footnote 29. See supra pages 241-42.\nAccordingly, I decline to join my colleagues in speculating, even with non-binding effect on future courts, as to the\nhypothetical circumstances under which taxpayers could be held directly responsible, whether in their role as\nvoters or otherwise, including with respect to referenda. Imagining such hypothetical circumstances raises a\nseries of fundamental questions about democratic theory, implicating a host of subtle variables in a system of\n251 non-compulsory voting-all *251 of which I believe are best considered, not in the abstract, but in the concrete.\nWhatever the nature of any exception created by footnote 29, I am guided here by the Supreme Court's view in \nNewport that \"such an occurrence is sufficiently unlikely that we need not anticipate it here.\" 453 U.S. at 267 n.\n29, 101 S.Ct. 2748. With that caution, I concur in the judgment.\n[1] We do not speculate on whether punitive damages would be proper if a substantial minority opposed the\nunconstitutional rule.\n[2] Because counsel conceded that he was not making an argument that the jury might have undervalued\ncompensatory damages given its belief that it could award punitive damages, we express no opinion on whether,\nabsent such a concession, a new trial on compensatory damages might be appropriate. Cf. Webster, 689 F.2d at\n1229-30 (reversing both punitive and compensatory damages and remanding for a new trial on damages where\nthe jury had awarded no compensation for damages sustained by the decedent or for the loss of his\ncompanionship to his parents, and noting that \"the jury, in awarding punitive damages, [may have erroneously]\nthought it had covered all bases\").\n[1] A municipality is unlikely always to act rationally. Nevertheless, it is fair to assume that its behavior will be\ninfluenced by the extent to which it is made to bear the costs associated with its behavior. Indeed, § 1983, and \nNewport itself, are premised on that very principle. See Newport, 453 U.S. at 266, 101 S.Ct. 2748; Owen, 445\nU.S. at 651-52, 100 S.Ct. 1398.\n[2] These basic principles of the economic theory of deterrence are widely accepted, and have been applied to\nboth tort and criminal law. See generally, e.g., Gary S. Becker, Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach,\n76 J. Pol. Econ. 169 (1968); see also Guido Calabresi, The Costs of Accidents (1970); A. Mitchell Polinsky &\nSteven Shavell, Punitive Damages: An Economic Analysis, 111 Harv. L.Rev. 870 (1998).\n\n[3] The formula is not unique to Professors Polinsky and Shavell. For a very similar analysis, see Robert Cooter &\nThomas Ulen, Law and Economics 311-15 (2d ed.1997). I note that I express no opinion as to the conclusions\nreached by Professors Polinsky and Shavell regarding the availability of punitive damages in specific cases.\n[4] It is possible that, in some circumstances, use of a multiplier formula might overdeter socially useful conduct.\nLitigation costs borne by the defendant themselves have a deterrent effect that may not be taken into account by\na simple multiplier formula. And, although in a legal system that works efficiently, litigation costs would generally\nbe a part of the social cost attributable to the harm caused by the defendant, unnecessary costs of administering\nsuch a system may properly be viewed as beyond the actual harm caused. Where a defendant is forced to bear\nsuch excess administrative costs, the multiplier formula might overdeter. Despite such failings, however, it seems\nlikely that, in many instances, use of a multiplier will produce more accurate cost allocation than currently occurs.\n[5] Punitive damages have frequently been awarded in strict products liability cases in which the premise for\nliability is the design and distribution of a defective product, rather than fault. See, e.g., Grimshaw v. Ford Motor\nCo., 119 Cal.App.3d 757, 174 Cal.Rptr. 348, 383 (1981) (upholding a jury award of punitive damages against\nFord for its manufacture of the Pinto, and holding that \"punitive damages are recoverable in a nondeliberate or\nunintentional tort where the defendant's conduct constitutes a conscious disregard of the probability of injury to\nothers\"); Fischer v. Johns-Manville Corp., 103 N.J. 643, 512 A.2d 466, 480 (1986) (upholding a jury award of\npunitive damages against an asbestos manufacturer on a failure to warn theory, and holding that punitive\ndamages were available in strict products liability actions when a manufacturer is \"culpably indifferent to an\nunnecessary risk of injury\" and \"refuses to take steps to reduce that danger to an acceptable level\").\n[6]Cf. Polinsky & Shavell, supra note 4, at 890-91 (\"[T]he adjective `punitive' may sometimes be misleading. . . .\n[E]xtracompensatory damages may be needed for deterrence purposes in circumstances in which the behavior of\nthe defendant would not call for punishment.\"); see also Galligan, supra, at 13 (preferring the term \"augmented\nawards\" for punitive damages based solely on considerations of deterrence).\n[7] In order to award such socially compensatory damages, the jury would have to calculate the probability that\nthe defendant would otherwise evade full liability for its act. Such a calculation would rarely be precise. A rough\nestimate, however, would not be more unlikely than many other estimates that courts currently ask juries to\nmake. Thus, juries are routinely required to estimate the monetary value of a plaintiff's pain and suffering, or of\nthe loss sustained by a family as a result of a wrongful death, a sum that \"defies any precise mathematical\ncomputation.\" Feldman v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 524 F.2d 384, 386 (2d Cir.1975) (quoting Floyd v. Fruit Indus.,\nInc., 144 Conn. 659, 136 A.2d 918, 927 (1957)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 392 (Friendly, \nJ., concurring dubitante) (noting the difficulties of making such an estimate). The dangers that might attach to\nletting fact-finders assess socially compensatory damages could be mitigated by permitting closer judicial control\nover these damages and by placing the burden on the party seeking such damages to introduce evidence as to\nthe likelihood of escaping liability00for example, proof that the defendant has tried to conceal its act, or evidence\n97\nof the number of times a particular wrongful act has occurred and the number of lawsuits brought against the\ndefendant. The case before us shows that, at least in some circumstances, it will be readily possible to ascertain\nhow often a particular violation has taken place. Here, records were kept that allowed the City to estimate that\nabout 65,000 arrestees were subjected to the strip-search policy.\n[8] One could argue that allowing both socially compensatory and punitive awards runs the risk of\noverdeterrence. But, once the goals of social compensation and punishment are disaggregated, allowing a\nseparate award of punitive damages could represent a societal judgment that, for certain conduct, a cost-benefit\nanalysis is inappropriate. That might be the case, for example, if the \"benefit\" resulting from the defendant's\nconduct is socially illicit00perhaps because it consists of pleasure in the victim's pain. This function of punitive\n97\ndamages renders them analogous to criminal penalties that seek not to achieve a socially optimal level of activity,\nbut to discourage or even eliminate a particular activity altogether. See Becker, supra note 4, at 191. \nOf course, to the extent that punitive awards were permitted in order to further this quasi-criminal function, it\nwould be appropriate to reconsider the procedural protections that should attach before such an award can be\nmade. Cf., e.g., Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968) (distinguishing between\ncivil and criminal contempt and holding that the Seventh Amendment required a jury trial for serious criminal\n\ncontempt). Indeed, one disadvantage of the current system, which conflates punitive and social deterrence goals,\nis that what are actually punitive damages rather than socially compensatory damages can be awarded without\nadequate procedural safeguards and imposed on defendants who are not intentionally wrongful. Cf. cases cited \nsupra note 7.\n[9] In the case of constitutional torts by municipalities, socially compensatory damages could appropriately be\npaid into a federally administered fund. In other suits against municipalities, however, it would not make much\nsense to require that the extracompensatory damages be placed into the general state treasury. For the\ndeterrence function would then be diluted, since some of the monies would likely return to the city. Rather, in\norder to preserve the desired deterrent effect, the damages would more properly be paid to a specific fund whose\npurpose, at least in theory, would be to attenuate the harm borne by those victims who did not receive\ncompensatory damages. Thus, in cases of environmental damage, the fund might serve environmental purposes,\nand in auto injury cases, road safety. Such a fund might also be used to compensate victims whose damages\nhad already been assessed to the defendant as a result of the multiplier and who, nevertheless, successfully\nsued later. \nIn establishing and controlling the use of such \"limited purpose\" funds, one should keep in mind the possible\nundesirability of having a significant part of general government revenues derive not from taxation, but from tort\njudgments. This problem is not, however, limited to or even primarily connected with awards of\nextracompensatory damages. See, e.g., Hanoch Dagan & James J. White, Governments, Citizens, and Injurious\nIndustries, 75 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 354, 364-77 (2000) (discussing the settlement between the states and tobacco\nproducts manufacturers, which will require the payment of over $200 billion to the states in the next twenty-five\nyears). It therefore must be addressed, if at all, at a more general level.\n[10] This argument is, in effect, the obverse of the Newport Court's assertion that punitive damages imposed on\nmunicipalities punish \"blameless or unknowing taxpayers.\" Newport, 453 U.S. at 267, 101 S.Ct. 2748. Both\ncontentions depend on an assumption that the municipality and the taxpayers who compose it are wholly distinct\nentities00an assumption that, as courts have recognized in the case of corporations, cannot withstand close\n97\nscrutiny. Thus, in Fischer v. Johns-Manville, the New Jersey Supreme Court, upholding an award of punitive\ndamages against an asbestos manufacturer, rejected defendant's argument that punitive damages \"unfairly\npunish[ed] innocent shareholders\" and declined its invitation to draw a distinction between a corporation and its\nshareholders, pointing out that shareholders have the power to affect corporate action: \nIt is the corporation, not the individual shareholders, that is recognized as an ongoing legal entity. . . . True,\npayment of punitive damage claims will deplete corporate assets, which will possibly produce a reduction in net\nworth and thereby result in a reduction in the value of individual shares. But the same is true of compensatory\ndamages. Both are possible legal consequences of the commission of harmful acts in the course of doing\nbusiness. To the same extent that damages claims may affect shareholders adversely, so do profitable sales of\nharmful products redound to their benefit (at least temporarily). These are the risks and rewards that await\ninvestors. Also, we would not consider it harmful were shareholders to be encouraged by decisions such as this\nto give close scrutiny to corporate practices in making investment decisions.\nFischer, 512 A.2d at 476.\nState courts rejected the doctrine of charitable immunity on similar grounds. See, e.g., Flagiello v. Pennsylvania\nHosp., 417 Pa. 486, 208 A.2d 193, 204 (1965) (repudiating charitable immunity as \"inconsistent with the principle\nthat `liability should fall upon the party best situated to adopt preventive measures and thereby reduce the\nlikelihood of injury'\") (quoting Italia Societa per Azioni di Navigazione v. Oregon Stevedoring Co., 376 U.S. 315,\n324, 84 S.Ct. 748, 11 L.Ed.2d 732 (1964)).\n[11] The Supreme Court has held that punitive damages are properly assessed against individual defendants in §\n1983 actions even for some unintentional violations of constitutional rights. See Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 41,\n51, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983) (holding that punitive damages can be obtained against individual\ndefendants in § 1983 cases \"without a showing of actual ill will, spite, or intent to injure\" where the defendant has\nexhibited \"reckless or callous disregard for plaintiff's rights\"). I note that, to the extent that municipalities indemnify\n\ntheir officials against such awards of punitive damages, the distinction drawn by the Newport Court between\ncities and individual city officials inevitably collapses.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
