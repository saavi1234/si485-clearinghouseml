    "summary": "<p>On January 31, 2002, three plaintiffs represented by private New York-based  attorneys filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  They alleged that the Orange County Sheriff's Department had an unconstitutional blanket policy and/or practice of strip searching all individuals who entered the Orange County Correctional Facility (jail), including those charged with misdemeanors or held on civil matters, regardless of the crime for which they were charged and without reasonable suspicion to believe that the individuals were concealing weapons or contraband.  Under the policy, each detainee was allegedly forced to strip naked, bend over and/or squat, lift his/her genitals and spread the cheeks of his/her buttocks so that jail guards could complete a visual search of his/her body.  Plaintiffs alleged that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  They sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, monetary damages, and class certification. </p><p>Defendants, the County and the Sheriff, answered by generally denying all allegations.    Defendants also moved to dismiss the request for injunctive relief on standing grounds, as a new strip search policy was adopted at the jail in August 2001.  The District Court (District Judge Colleen McMahon) denied the motion to dismiss and ordered a full evidentiary hearing.  Dodge v. County of Orange, 208 F.R.D. 79 (S.D. N.Y. 2002).  Following a hearing on June 24, 2002, the District Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification and issued a preliminary injunction. The injunction allowed defendants to conduct strip searches of newly-arrived inmates only when they had reason to believe the new arrival might be secreting contraband, based on (1) the nature of the crime charged; (2) the circumstances of the arrest; and (3) the particular characteristics of the arrestee.   Dodge v. County of Orange, 209 F.R.D. 65 (S.D. N.Y. 2002).  Judge McMahon ordered that the case proceed in two phases: (1) trial on liability (whether the policy was unconstitutional and whether a permanent injunction should be issued) and (2) damages.</p><p>On October 22, 2002, a second complaint, Rango v. County of Orange, 02 Civ. 8451 (S.D. N.Y. 2002) (\" Rango \") was filed. The Rango plaintiffs purported to represent a class of pre-trial detainees charged with felonies who were admitted to the Orange County Correctional Facility (\"OCCF\") from January 1, 1999, to the present and allegedly strip searched in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Rango plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction soon after filing their complaint.</p><p>The Court consolidated the Dodge and Rango cases so that a single trial could be conducted on plaintiffs' requests for permanent injunctive relief in both cases. The consolidated trial was conducted over four days, between May 19 and May 28, 2003.</p><p> The Court found that the strip search policy violated the Fourth Amendment to extent that it allowed strip searches without individualized reasonable suspicion.  Judge McMahon issued a permanent injunction against unconstitutional aspects of the county jail's policy.  Dodge v. County of Orange, 282 F. Supp.2d 41 (S.D. N.Y. 2003).  Orange County appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  The appeal was dismissed in a summary decision later amended by the court, and the case remanded to the District Court for a determination as to whether plaintiffs had standing (e.g., a likelihood of future harm from the wrongful official policy) to pursue injunctive relief.  Dodge v. County of Orange, 99 Fed. Appx. 347 (2nd Cir. 2004), opinion amended and superseded by Dodge v. County of Orange, 103 Fed. Appx. 688 (2nd Cir. 2004).  </p><p>   </p><p>On remand, plaintiffs withdrew their claim for injunctive relief. They sought decertification of the injunctive class and certification of a class, or classes, of plaintiffs for purposes of recovering damages.  Defendants opposed the new damages class request.  Judge McMahon bifurcated the liability and damages phases of the cases and certified the classes only on the issue of liability - the constitutionality of the strip search policy.  Dodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177 (S.D. N.Y. 2005).  Following certification, settlement negotiations ensued and the parties entered into a proposed Settlement Agreement.</p><p>Under the Settlement Agreement, Orange County agreed to pay $624,800 into a fund for payment of class claims.  Of that amount, $10,000 was to be divided among the class representatives.  Eligible felony detainees were to receive $100.00 each.  Eligible non-felony detainees were to receive  $1,000, unless they met certain reduction criteria, in which case they would receive $250.  The County also agreed to pay class counsel attorneys' fees in the amount of $600,000.</p><p>On March 2, 2006, the Court preliminarily approved the Settlement Agreement and set the matter for a fairness hearing on June 9, 2006.   Final approval was granted for the settlement by Judge McMahon on June 26, 2006.</p><p>We have no information that post-settlement activity occurred in the case.</p><p></p>",

They have narrowed the class period, apparently in view of certain findings this \ncourt made at the trial of their action for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. Dodge v. County of Orange, \n282 F.Supp.2d 41, 85–86 (S.D.N.Y.2003). Those findings are not binding on anyone any more, in view of the Second \nCircuit’s vacatur of that decision, but plaintiffs’ counsel appears to have given up the contention that all pre-trial \ndetainees who arrived at OCCF after August 6, 2002 were strip searched pursuant to a uniform policy. \n \n2  Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56 (2d Cir.2001)(“Shain I”); Wachtler v. County of Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77 (2d Cir.1994); Walsh \n  v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66 (2d Cir.1988); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986). I will frequently refer to these four \ncases together as “Weber/Walsh/Wachtler/Shain I.” \n \n3  Plaintiffs allege that this Court’s decision in Murcia put the County defendants on notice, as of the date of that \n  decision, that the indiscriminate strip searching of newly-arrived felony detainees was unlawful, and that the law, \nfor qualified immunity purposes, was “clearly established.” However, the Second Circuit has held that the law \ncannot be “clearly established” for qualified immunity purposes by district court opinions, but only by the decisions \nof the applicable circuit court or the Supreme Court. Shechter v. Comptroller of New York, 79 F.3d 265, 271 (2d \nCir.1996); Jermosen v. Smith, 945 F.2d 547, 550 (2d Cir.1991); Hawkins v. Steingut, 829 F.2d 317, 321 (2d Cir.1987); \nChipperini v. Crandall, 253 F.Supp.2d 301, 307 (D.Conn.2003). \n \n4  I recognize that Judge Hurley has, on multiple occasions, both before and after Visa Check was decided, refused to \n  certify a class in a similar case pending in the Eastern District, Augustin v. Jablonsky, 99 Civ. 3126(DRH), 2001 WL \n770839 (E.D.N.Y.2001), on the ground that common issues did not predominate. I am not familiar with the record in \n7 \n \n\n \n \nDodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177 (2005)   \n \n \nAugustin; perhaps I would have reached the same result on the record before Judge Hurley. Even the same court \ncan reach different conclusions in different cases; for example, I am today declining to certify classes in a companion \ncase involving the strip search policies at the Dutchess County Jail because, on a rather different fact pattern, \ncommon questions do not predominate. See Franklin v. County of Dutchess, No. 03 Civ. 719(CM), 225 F.R.D. 487 \n(S.D.N.Y.2005). But on the record before me—a record I know well—I do not find the reasoning of Augustin \npersuasive in view of Visa Check and Robinson, supra, and I respectfully decline to follow it. \n \n5  The principal reason why defendants wanted to have a quick trial on the merits of plaintiffs’ application for \n  permanent injunctive relief was so that, if the Second Circuit reversed itself (or the Supreme Court reversed the \nSecond Circuit) in Shain v. Ellison, the jail could “revert” to the policy of strip searching every new arrival, regardless \nof his individualized circumstances. OCCF officials were eager to strip search every new arrival for what they claimed \nwere security reasons. See Trial Transcript, Testimony of Captain Joseph G. Ryan, at 106–07; 115–16. It will be \ndifficult if not impossible for the County to retreat from its prior position on the existence of a uniform strip search \npolicy at the “old” OCCF, even though the findings made after the Dodge trial are no longer binding. \n \n6  As a purely practical matter, I must observe that, if thousands of individual plaintiffs brought individual actions in \n  this court ab initio, those actions would likely be assigned to me as “related cases,” and I would consolidate them for \nthe purpose of determining liability. \n \n7  I recognize that I cannot resolve merits issues as part of a decision on a motion for summary judgment. However, \n  this case carries a lot of “merits” history. Plaintiffs have already announced that they intend to move for summary \njudgment on the “existence of a policy” issue. Given the facts known to this court, it would be foolish not to \nacknowledge that plaintiff might well prevail on such a motion for the pre-August 2001 period—even if Lee does not \ncollaterally estop the County and Bigger from relitigating the issue. Defendants could just as easily have prevailed on \nsuch a motion for the period from and after August 2002 had plaintiffs not withdrawn their proposal to certify a \nclass for that period. \nI imagine that the parties will move for cross-motion for summary judgment on the existence of a policy issue for \nthe year between August 2001 and August 2002. I cannot stop anyone from making such a motion, but let me \nsuggest that summary judgment will not be an appropriate vehicle for resolving the question. In this regard, I \nremind the parties that Dodge I findings concerning the interim year were not based on undisputed facts. Many \nfacts concerning the existence or non-existence of a policy from August 2001–August 2002 were in dispute, and I \nresolved them by making, inter alia, credibility findings. Now that we are dealing only with an action for damages, \nI will not be the fact-finder and I would not be in a position to make credibility assessments or resolve evidentiary \nconflicts should they emerge from the record on a motion for summary judgment. If the record on such a motion \nis no different from the trial record, there is no question that there will be disputed issues of fact, which will be \ntried to a jury. Moreover, that jury will not be made aware of how the court ruled on those same issues after the \nfirst trial. \n \n8  In what the court interprets as an attempt to intimidate me from concluding that there are ways to manage \n  issue-oriented class certification, the County has intimated that it would not consent to have damages inquests for \nclass members held before one of our excellent magistrate judges. That, of course, is the County’s right. Fortunately, \nthere are many other ways of handling such matters. For example, if the County’s liability were established because \n8 \n \n\n \n \nDodge v. County of Orange, 226 F.R.D. 177 (2005)   \n \n \nthe trier of fact concluded that a uniform policy existed, I could appoint an out-of-district Article III judge whose \ndocket is not overcrowded to serve as a special master. That judge could then travel to New York—at the \ndefendants’ expense, of course—to supervise the damages trials. \n \n9  The fact that the parties treated these two periods differently during the Dodge I trial is a persuasive reason for \n  dividing the classes in this fashion. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n9 \n ",

Works.\n\n2002 WL 32809555 (S.D.N.Y.) Page 4\n(Cite as: 2002 WL 32809555)\nTWENTIETH: The plaintiffs' class seeks a declaratoryjudgment declaring that a strip\nsearch of a pre-trial detainee undertaken in the absence of a reasonable suspicion\nthat the detainee subjected to the search is concealing weapons or other contraband\nconstitutes an unreasonable search and is unconstitutional; an order enjoining de-\nfendants from conducting such unconstitutional strip searches; together with com-\npensatory damages for the injuries caused by defendants' unlawful policy and prac-\ntice of strip searching pre-trial detainees absent reasonable suspicion. Plaintiffs\nare suing on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated individuals, and\nseek to represent a class comprised of all persons who have been or will be placed\nin the custody of the Orange County Sheriff's Office and were or presumably will be\nstrip searched pursuant to the unlawful policy, practice, procedure and custom of\nthe defendants, County of Orange and Sheriff H. Frank Bigger.\nTWENTY-FIRST: The class period commences three years from the date on which this ac-\ntion has been filed with the Clerk of the Court for the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of New York and extends until such a date when the County\nof Orange and Sheriff H. Frank Bigger are enjoined from, or otherwise cease. enfor-\ncing the unconstitutional policy, practice, procedure and custom of conducting strip\nsearches of pre-trial detainees in the absence of reasonable suspicion.\nTWENTY-SECOND: The members of the class are so numerous as to renderjoinder imprac-\nticable. Upon information and belief, there exists thousands of persons who were and\nare arrested for misdemeanor or non-criminal offenses in the County of Orange during\nthe period in question, all of whom are members of the class, by reason of having\nbeen subject to violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights, as well\nas such other rights conferred by the Constitution, by the policy, practice, proced-\nure and custom of the defendants mandating uniform strip searches to be conducted of\nall pre-trial detainees after being placed in the custody of the Orange County Sher-\niff's office described herein.\nTWENTY-THIRD: In addition, upon information and belief, joinder is impracticable be-\ncause many members of the class may contain non-English speaking persons of low in-\ncome and socio-economic status who may likely have great difficulty in pursuing\ntheir personal rights and liberties individually.\nTWENTY-FOURTH: The questions oflaw and fact common to the class include that each of\nthe class members have common rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to\nbe free from unreasonable and unconstitutional strip searches. and that defendants'\npolicy, practice, procedure and custom in conducting strip searches of pre-trial de-\ntainees in the absence of reasonable suspicion violates those rights.\nTWENTY-FIFTH: The named plaintiffs, Anthony Dodge, Peter A. Machado and Joseph Pet-\nriello, are adequate representatives of the class. The violation of the law alleged\nby the named plaintiffs stems from the same course of conduct by defendants; namely,\nthat their uniform strip search custom, practice, procedure and policy has violated\nand continues to violate the rights of proposed class members. The legal theory un-\nder which the named plaintiffs seek relief are the same or similar to that upon\nwhich the class will rely. In addition, the harm suffered by the named plaintiffs\n© 2007 Thomson/West. No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt. Works.\n\n2002 WL 32809555 (S.D.N.Y.) Page 5\n(Cite as: 2002 WL 32809555)\nare typical of the harm suffered by the proposed class members.\nTWENTY-SIXTH: The named plaintiffs, Anthony Dodge, Peter A. Machado and Joseph Pet-\nriello, and each ofthem, have the requisite personal interests in the outcome of\nthis action and will fairly and adequately protect the in erests of the putative\nclass. The named plaintiffs are represented by the law firm of Dupee, Dupee & Mon-\nroe, P.C. Serving “of counsel” for the law firm of Dupee, Dupee & Monroe, P.C. will\nbe Mr. Robert N. Isseks, Esq. This law firm, together with Mr. Isseks, have the re-\nsources, expertise and experience to prosecute this action. The members of the law\nfirm for the plaintiffs do not have knowledge of any conflicts among members of the\nclass or between Dupee, Dupee & Monroe, P.C., Mr. Robert N. Isseks, Esq. and the\nmembers of this proposed class.\nTWENTY-SEVENTH: The class action is superior to other available methods for the fair\nand efficient adjudication of this controversy because: (i) the prosecution of thou-\nsands of separate actions would be inefficient and wasteful of judicial resources;\n(ii) the members of the class may be scattered throughout Orange County, the State\nof New York and the United States and are not likely to be able to vindicate and en-\nforce their constitutional and statutory rights unless this action is maintained as\na class action; (iii) the issues raised can be more fairly and efficiently resolved\nin the contexts of a single action rather than piece-meal litigation in the context\nof separate actions; (iv) the resolution of litigation in a single forum will avoid\nthe danger and resultant confusion of possible inconsistent determinations; (v) the\nprosecution of separate actions would create the risk of inconsistent or varying ad-\njudications with respect to individuals pursuing claims against defendants which\nwould establish incompatible standards of conduct for defendants; (vi) defendants\nhave acted and will act on grounds applicable to all class members, making final de-\nclaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of all members necessary and appropriate;\nand (vii) questions of law and/or fact common to members of the class especially on\nissues of liability predominate over any question, such as that of individual dam-\nages, that will effect individual class members.\nFACTS APPLICABLE TO THE CLASS GENERALLY\nTWENTY-EIGHTH: The United States Constitution prohibits municipalities and public\nofficials, such as the County of Orange and Sheriff H. Frank Bigger, from performing\nstrip searches of pre-trial detainees who have been charged with misdemeanors or\nother lesser offenses unless the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the detain-\nee is concealing a weapon, drugs or other contraband.\nTWENTY-NINTH: Defendants, County of Orange and Sheriff H. Frank Bigger, its of-\nficers, agents, servants and/or employees knew or should have known that they could\nnot lawfully institute, enforce, condone, affirm or permit the enforcement of a\npolicy or practice of conducting uniform strip searches of pre-trial detainees in\nthe absence of reasonable suspicion.\nTHIRTIETH: The defendant, Sheriff H. Frank Bigger and several employees of the Or-\nange County Sheriff's Office have testified in a separate proceeding on June 5,2001\nthat pre-trial detainees placed in the custody of the Orange County Sheriff's Office\n© 2007 Thomson/West.

Page 6\n(Cite as: 2002 WL 32809555)\nwere subjected to an unwritten strip search policy instituted, enforced, ratified\nand affirmed by all of the above named defendants regardless of the crime charged or\nwhether there was reasonable suspicion that the detainee was concealing weapons,\ndrugs, or other contraband.\nTHIRTY-FIRST: That the County of Orange and Sheriff H. Frank Bigger have continued\nto implement and enforce this illegal and unconstitutional policy, practice, proced-\nure and custom mandating strip searches of all pre-trial detainees in bad faith and\nin blatant disregard of clearly established law.\nTHIRTY-SECOND: Defendant, County of Orange, shares the responsibility with defend-\nant, Sheriff H. Frank Bigger, for the custody and control of all pre-trial detainees\nin the custody of the Orange County Sheriff's Office and participated and affirmed\nthe enforcement of the Orange County Sheriff's Office strip search policy and/or\nknowingly or recklessly failed to prevent the enforcement of a policy that was\nplainly unconstitutional.\nTHIRTY-THIRD: Defendants, County of Orange and Sheriff H. Frank Bigger's policy,\npractice, procedure and custom of uniform strip searches of its pre-trial detainees\nis not limited to male or female prisoners. Upon information and belief, the County\nof Orange and Sheriff H. Frank Bigger's policy, practice, procedure and custom man-\ndates that all detainees regardless of their gender be routinely strip searched,\nwholly absent reasonable suspicion.\nTHIRTY-FOURTH: Estimated conservatively, upon information and belief, thousands of\npersons have been and/or will be arrested and charged with misdemeanor and/or non-\ncriminal offenses and have been or will be strip searched, absent any inquiry into\nor the establishment of reasonable suspicion to justify the search, pursuant to the\nCounty of Orange and Sheriff H. Frank Bigger's policy, practice, procedure and cus-\ntom described above. Upon information and belief, and in every instance, the pre-\ntrial detainee subjected to the strip search by the Orange County Sheriff's office\npersonnel had or has already been subject to a search prior to being transported to\nthe supervision and/or custody of the Orange County Sheriff's Office\nTHIRTY-FIFTH: Pursuant to this uniform strip search policy, and knowing acquiescence\nof the same by the County of Orange, each member of the class, including the named\nplaintiffs, were the victims of a routine strip search policy, practice, or proced-\nure, conducted prior to or following their arraignment, without inquiry into or es-\ntablishment of reasonable suspicion.\nTHIRTY-SIXTH: As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conduc-\nted pursuant to this uniform strip search policy, each victim of these unlawful and\nunconstitutional strip searches and each member of the class, including these named\nplaintiffs, have suffered or will suffer emotional and psychological pain; suffering\nand mental anguish.\nEXPERIENCES OF NAMED PLAINTIFFS\nTHIRTY-SEVENTH: Plaintiffs, Anthony Dodge, Peter A. Machado and Joseph Petriello,\n© 2007 Thomson/West. No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt. Works.\n\n2002 WL 32809555 (S.D.N.Y.) Page 7\n(Cite as: 2002 WL 32809555)\nand and each of them, after being placed in the custody of the Orange County Sher-\niff's Office, were strip searched pursuant to the unlawful and unconstitutional\npolicy of the defendants, County of Orange and Sheriff H. Frank Bigger. After being\nplaced in the custody of the Orange County Sheriff's Office, each of the named\nplaintiffs were ordered to remove all of their garments for the visual inspection of\nthe Orange County Sheriff Office's personnel. During these unlawful and unconstitu-\ntional searches in the absence of reasonable suspicion that any of the above named\nplaintiffs were in possession of either weapons or contraband, the Orange County\nSheriff's Office personnel were able to view and examine the named plaintiffs'\nclothing and personal effects as well as their unclothed bodies. Each of the above\nnamed plaintiffs was also ordered to bend over while completely unclothed and spread\nhis buttocks to complete the visual inspection and search of his genitalia and anal\ncavity.\nTHIRTY-EIGHTH: There was no reasonable suspicion to believe that any of the above\nnamed plaintiffs were concealing a weapon or other contraband. Indeed, no inquiry\nwas made of any of the above named plaintiffs, and therefore it could not have given\nrise to the requisite reasonable suspicion required by law. Moreover, prior to the\nstrip search, each of the above named plaintiffs had been frisked for weapons by the\narresting officers prior to being placed in the custody of the Orange County Sher-\niff's Office. Accordingly, the personnel of the Orange County Sheriff's Office knew\nor should have known that each of the above named plaintiffs had already been sub-\njected to a search incident to arrest which would have revealed the presence of\nweapons or contraband.\nTHIRTY-NINTH: That as a direct and proximate result of the unlawful and unconstitu-\ntional strip searches conducted pursuant to defendants, County of Orange and Sheriff\nH. Frank Bigger's policy, practice, procedure and custom, each of the above named\nplaintiffs and other similarly situated individuals has suffered and continues to\nsuffer emotional and psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental anguish.\nAS AND FOR A FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION PURSUANT TO 42 U.S. §1983 (AGAINST ALL DEFEND-\nANTS)\nFORTIETH: Plaintiffs repeat, reiterate and reallege with the same force and effect\nas iffully set forth herein at length, each and every allegation hereinabove alleged\nand set forth in Paragraph “FIRST” through “THIRTY-EIGHTH” of this complaint.\nFORTY-FIRST: By implementing, promulgating, affirming, ratifying and continuing to\nenforce and/or effectuate a policy, practice, procedure and custom pursuant to the\nnamed plaintiffs and other members of the plaintiff class who were or will be strip\nsearched absent the requisite reasonable suspicion, or any other legally-sufficient\njustification, each of the above mentioned defendants have deprived and will contin-\nue to deprive each and every plaintiff and members of plaintiff's class of rights,\nliberties, freedoms, remedies, privileges and immunities guaranteed to every citizen\nof the United States, in violation of 42 U.S.C. §1983, and of the rights guarantee\nby the Fourth.

Frank Bigger, and each of them, acted by virtue and color of state law\nand in their individual and official capacities and within the scope of their em-\nployment. Said acts by these defendants were beyond the scope of their jurisdiction,\nin the absence of legal authority and in willful disregard of the clearly estab-\nlished law, and with the specific intent to deprive each of the above named\nplaintiffs and those individuals similarly situated, of their constitutional rights,\nsecured by 42 U.S.C. §1983 and by the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the\nUnited States Constitution.\nFORTY-THIRD: As a direct and proximate result of the misconduct and abuse of the de-\nfendants as set forth above, each and every plaintiff and members of plaintiffs'\nclass has suffered and continues to suffer emotional and psychological pain, humili-\nation, embarrassment, suffering and mental anguish.\nWHEREFORE, plaintiffs demand judgment as follows:\na. A court order certifying this class as a class action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(a) and (b) naming the aforementioned plaintiffs as the class representatives;\nb. A judgment declaring defendants' policy, practice, procedure and custom mandating\nthat a strip search be undertaken absent reasonable suspicion that the pre-trial de-\ntainee is concealing weapons or other contraband is unconstitutional;\nc.

Frank Bigger.\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW FOLLOWING TRIAL\nMCMAHON, District Judge.\nThis case began in January of 2002, when the complaint in Dodge v. County of Orange, 208 F.R.D. 79\n(S.D.N.Y.2002) (\"Dodge\") was filed. Plaintiffs brought suit pursuant 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (\"Section 1983\") and sought\nto represent a class of pre-trial detainees charged with misdemeanors who were admitted to the Orange County\nCorrectional Facility (\"OCCF\") from January 1, 1999 to the present and allegedly subject to strip searches upon\ntheir admission to the facility that they contend violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\nThe plaintiffs in Dodge moved for a preliminary injunction against further unconstitutional strip searches at OCCF\nin February of 2002, and defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint as moot. I denied defendants' motion\nto dismiss and granted plaintiffs' request for a hearing on their motion for a preliminary injunction. See Dodge v.\nCounty of Orange, 208 F.R.D. 79 (S.D.N.Y.2002). I also consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with a\nhearing to determine whether class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) was appropriate,\nor whether partial class certification under Rule 23(c)(4)(A) would be the best method for adjudicating plaintiffs'\ncase.\nA one-day hearing was held on June 24, 2002. Following the hearing, I granted plaintiffs motion for class\ncertification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) and issued a preliminary injunction. See Dodge v. County of Orange, 209\nF.R.D. 65 (S.D.N.Y.2002). The injunction enjoined defendants to conduct strip searches of newly-arrived inmates\nonly when they had reason to believe the new arrival might be secreting contraband, based on (1) the nature of\n\nthe crime charged; (2) the circumstances of the arrest; and (3) the particular characteristics of the arrestee. [DX\n33].\nOn October 22, 2002, a second complaint, Rango v. County of Orange, 02 Civ. 8451 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (\"Rango\")\nwas filed. The Rango plaintiffs purported to represent a class of pre-trial detainees charged with felonies who\nwere admitted to the Orange County Correctional Facility (\"OCCF\") from January 1, 1999 to the present and\nallegedly strip searched in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Rango\nplaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction soon after filing their complaint.\nAt oral arguments on the Rango plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, I deferred my decision on that\nmotion pending an evidentiary hearing. The parties then agreed to consolidate the Dodge and Rango cases so\nthat a single trial could be conducted on plaintiffs' requests for permanent injunctive relief in both cases. The\nconsolidated trial was conducted over four days, between May 19 and May 28, 2003. At the trial, I heard\ntestimony from twenty six witnesses and received into evidence voluminous exhibits from both parties. I was also\ngiven a personal tour of OCCF on May 29, 2003, at which I time I heard additional testimony from OCCF\ncorrections officers.\nUpon reviewing that evidence, together with the parties' post-trial submissions, I make the following findings of\nfact and conclusions of law.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nI. The Orange County Correctional Facility\n44 OCCF is a county jail located about sixty miles northwest of New York City, in *44 a county that contains two of\nthe poorest cities in New York State (Middletown and Newburgh), as well as a growing number of suburban\ndevelopments that are beginning to impinge on the county's extensive rural areas.\nFor many years, OCCF was housed in Goshen, New York at 40 Erie Street. OCCF officials and counsel were\nfrank in describing the jail as old and decrepit. On September 1, 2001, the County opened its new correctional\nfacility, which is located in Goshen at 110 Wells Farm Road. As part of the trial, I was given an extensive tour of\nthe facility, which is most impressive.\nOCCF is a county jail. In the jurisprudence of the Second Circuit, county jails are not considered \"prisons.\" Shain\n[1]\nv. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 65-66 (2d. Cir.2001) (hereafter \"Shain\").  However, at least in the more populous\ncounties (and I include Orange County00one of the fastest growing counties in terms of population in New York\n97\n[2]\nState00in that group ), the county jail is not the local pokey, either. Accordingly, a description of the facility is both\n97\nwarranted and relevant.\nOCCF is constructed as four separate modules, each of which contains three or four units. Each unit houses up\nto fifty-three inmates in a self-contained area, in which not only cells, but also recreation areas (both outdoor and\nindoor) and facilities for serving food are located. The facility has common areas for educational programs\nconducted by the Board of Co-operative Educational services (BOCES); medical treatment; personal grooming;\nand a common kitchen. It also houses administrative offices for jail personnel and the County Sheriff and\nrecreational facilities for use by corrections personnel. (A diagram of OCCF is attached to this opinion as Ex. 1.)\n[3]\nOCCF is surrounded by high metal fencing topped with barbed wire. It boasts guard towers and lights. It looks\nnothing whatever like a community lock-up; it is every bit as forbidding as the medium security federal prison I\nvisited some years ago.\nOCCF, like all county jails in New York, houses at least three classes of criminal inmates: persons accused of\nfelonies who have not been admitted to (or made) bail; persons convicted of misdemeanors who have been\nsentenced to terms of imprisonment of less than one year; and persons accused of misdemeanors who have not\n\n[4]\nmade bail.  Every criminal detainee who arrives at OCCF has been arraigned. Alien detainees and persons who\nhave been civilly committed are also housed in the facility. [Ryan Direct ¶ 21]. The County is presently negotiating\nwith federal authorities to house certain federal detainees.\n45 *45 When multiple inmates are being transported to the facility (generally by the Orange County Sheriff's\nDepartment), no effort is made to segregate accused felons from misdemeanants or civil committees. Similarly,\naccused felons are not necessarily segregated from accused misdemeanants, sentenced misdemeanants, or civil\ndetainees in the housing units. However, a person being detained for trial on a charge of rape or murder is\nunlikely to be housed in the same unit as a person who is delinquent on his child support, because New York\nState law requires that inmates be classified by perceived level of risk (high, medium, low) and housed with other\ninmates who share a similar risk assessment. Men and women are housed separately, and there is a separate\nhousing unit for juveniles.\nOCCF only accepts inmates after a court has issued a securing order that remands the inmate to OCCF until he\ncan either raise bail or be tried on the criminal charges against him. [Ryan Direct ¶ 8]. Approximately thirty seven\ndifferent local and municipal courts (and, on occasion, federal authorities) remand inmates to OCCF. The\narresting agencies include the New York State Police (who serve as the police force for significant parts of\nOrange County) and the police departments of the various municipalities within the County.\nOCCF has the capacity to house 786 inmates. [Ryan Direct ¶ 5]. At present its capacity is not taxed. An average\nof 530 inmates are housed at OCCF each day. The annual census filed with the State of New York show that just\nover 5,500 inmates passed through the institution in each of the years 2001 and 2002. In 2001, 36% of the\ninmates housed at OCCF were felony pre-trial detainees (2,009 inmates); in 2002, 42% were felony detainees\n(2,322 inmates). The rest are misdemeanants at various stages of the process (both pretrial and sentenced),\npersons secured under civil commitment orders, and immigration detainees. This contrasts with Rikers Island,\nNew York City's \"local jail.\" Rikers consists of several different buildings, some of which (such as the Anna M.\nKross Center) house up to approximately 3,000 inmates on any given day. [Tr. 182 (DeRosa Testimony)].\nThe record contains no data about how many new arrivals are/were received at either the old or the new facility\non any given day. According to Capt. Joseph Ryan, the current daytime shift commander at OCCF, there are\nsome days on which no new arrivals come to OCCF, while as many as thirty or more may show up on the five to\nten busiest days of the year. [Tr. 99-100]. Corrections Officer James Ognibene III testified that the average\nnumber of new pre-trial detainees who were in-processed on a given day was about fourteen or fifteen, with\nseven to ten of those on the day tour and fewer at night. I find that the booking and receiving officers at OCCF\n[5]\nare not heavily burdened with in-processing new detainees during the average tour of duty.\nII. Strip Searches\nI here emphasize that the only matter at issue in this case is the constitutionality of strip searching inmates who\nare arriving at OCCF for the first time post-arraignment or arrest. The case is not about the legality of strip\n46 searches conducted after contact visits, strip searches conducted after court appearances or work details, or *46\nstrip searches conducted during cell shake-downs or when violations of contraband rules are suspected.\n[6]\nTherefore, I will focus the rest of my findings of fact on that issue.\nFirst, however, it is necessary to define what a \"strip search\" is, because00as I have previously noted00the term\n97 97\nmeans different things to different people. See Sarnicola v. County of Westchester, 229 F.Supp.2d 259, 272 n. 5\n(S.D.N.Y.2002). According to the Orange County Correctional Facility Training Manual, a \"strip search\" is:\na search of the inmate's clothes, once they have been removed, and a visual inspection of the\ninmate's naked body. This should include the inmate opening his mouth and moving his tongue up\nand down and from side to side, removing any dentures, running his hands through his hair,\nallowing his ears to be visually examined, lifting his arms to expose his arm pits, lifting his feet to\nexamine the sole, spreading and/or lifting his testicles to expose the area behind them and\n\nbending over and/or spreading the cheeks of his buttocks to expose his anus. For females, the\nprocedures are similar except females must in addition, squat to expose the vagina. [PX 8, at 13].\nThe Facility Training Manual elaborates on the strip search procedures, providing, in part, that the strip searching\nofficer should \"[c]arefully examine the inmate's groin\"; that \"a flashlight should be used, making it unnecessary to\ntouch the prisoner at this point in the search\"; and that the officer should \"[r]equire the inmate to turn around,\nbend over and spread his buttocks\" and \"[t]hen, using the flashlight, look at the inmate's rectum to see if any\ncontraband has been placed there.\" [PX 8, at 15].\nA. The Penological Interest in Strip Searching\nOCCF houses inmates who present a wide variety of security risks. [Camp Direct ¶ 8; DX 5-11]. These range\nfrom maximum-custody inmates who are considered the most dangerous, to minimum-custody inmates who are\nconsidered to pose lesser security risks. [Camp Direct ¶ 8]. As both sides' experts testified, however, penal\ninstitutions must provide a perimeter security that addresses the maximum possible risk. [DX 50A (DeRosa Dep.\n101); Camp Direct ¶ 8]. They also agreed that one of the primary security objectives of any correctional facility\nmust be to prevent the introduction of \"contraband\" into a correctional facility due to the dangers that contraband\npresents in a correctional setting. [Tr. 432-33, 447 (Camp Testimony); Tr. 196-97 (DeRosa Testimony); DX 50A\n(DeRosa Dep. 17-18); DX 49B (Fraser Aff. ¶¶ 16-18)].\nIn a correctional setting, the term \"contraband\" means anything that an inmate is not permitted to have in a\ncorrectional facility. Items such as money, cigarettes, or other materials that individuals can possess legally\noutside a correctional facility may be considered contraband, even serious contraband, inside a correctional\nfacility. [Tr. 429, 433-34 (Camp Testimony)].\nBoth William Fraser and George Camp (defendants' expert) testified credibly about the harm that contraband can\n47 cause within a correctional facility. The dangers *47 posed by weapons, ammunition, or drugs are obvious. Less\napparent is the danger presented by money, cigarettes, or even excess prison issue items. All of the expert\nwitnesses testified, including plaintiffs' expert, that even this \"lesser\" contraband can increase the level of\nviolence and endanger the health, safety, and well-being of inmates, staff, and civilians in a correctional facility.\n[Camp Direct ¶¶ 8, 11; Tr. 433-34 (Camp Testimony); Tr. 196-97 (DeRosa Testimony); DX 50A (DeRosa Dep.\n17-18); Tr. 395 (Fraser Testimony)]. The danger results from the unique environment that exists inside a\ncorrectional facility. Even seemingly innocuous items like money, cigarettes, or excess issue (extra sets of items\nthat are issued to an inmate once he arrives at the jail, such as clothing or linens) can be used by inmates to\nbarter, and thus be held over the heads of other inmates. [Tr. 433-34 (Camp Testimony)]. Barter tends to disrupt\nprison operations by allowing certain inmates, or groups of inmates, to exercise authority in competition with\ncorrectional staff. The use of even seemingly innocuous contraband in this manner can have serious and\ndangerous consequences. This is why both experts and Mr. Fraser agreed that the introduction of contraband\ninto a correctional facility such as OCCF \"endangers the safety and security of the inmates, [correctional]\nemployees, visitors, and the surrounding community.\" [DX 49B (Fraser Aff. ¶ 16)].\nJail and prison administrators have the legal mandate and professional obligation to ensure that correctional\nfacilities maintain safe environments for those who reside at, work in, or visit them. [Camp Direct ¶ 7]. The\npresence of contraband in a correctional facility interferes with this mandate because it can allow inmates to\ndisrupt jail operations, escape, or harm themselves or others. [Camp Direct ¶ 8]. It also increases the level of\nviolence at the institution. [Tr. 196-97 (DeRosa Testimony); Tr. 395 (Fraser Testimony)]. At large correctional\nfacilities like OCCF, this dangerous threat places a premium on keeping contraband out, as both the experts and\ncorrectional staff agreed that it was extremely hard to find contraband at OCCF once it already had been\nintroduced into the facility. [Tr. 226 (DeRosa Testimony); Camp Direct ¶ 26; Tr. 356-57 (Ryan Testimony)].\nFor OCCF and other jail facilities, this means that the development of procedures, policies, and precautions that\nwill deter, and hopefully prevent, the introduction of contraband is a priority, because of the dangers that this\ncontraband presents to institutional security, safety, and stability. [Camp Direct ¶¶ 8, 11, 12; Tr. 196-97 (DeRosa\nTestimony); DX 50A, at 17-18 (DeRosa Dep.)].\n\nThe responsibility for stopping the introduction of contraband into OCCF falls on the administrators of that facility.\nThe experts agreed that no prudent correctional administrator could safely rely on security precautions taken by\nother law enforcement agencies, or even correctional facilities that may have had custody of the inmate before he\nor she arrived at OCCF. [Tr. 228-29 (DeRosa Testimony)]. The record of this case contains several instances\nwhere inmates who arrived at OCCF after spending considerable time in local custody and at arraignment\nnonetheless possessed dangerous items, such as razor blades, drugs, and bullets. [DX 1B (razor blades); DX 1I\n[7]\n(marijuana); DX 1A (bullet)].  As former-Commissioner Fraser explained, the police are good at making arrests\n48 but often fall short with respect *48 to thorough and effective searches. [Tr. 385].\nThe fact that OCCF is a jail, not a prison, does not necessarily make the contraband problem easier to manage.\nWhile the Second Circuit surmised in Shain that prisons might present more dangerous circumstances because\nthey house inmates convicted of serious crimes, that is only one aspect of the problem. Jails like OCCF primarily\nhouse pretrial detainees, some of whom are accused of serious crimes. [Camp Direct ¶¶ 47-50]. Statistics\nprovided by OCCF, and not disputed by plaintiffs, show that one third or more of the persons housed at that\nfacility in every year since 1999 are felony pre-trial detainees, while one-half or fewer of the inmates are either\n[8]\naccused or convicted misdemeanants.  Moreover, a sample of the inmate population drawn from the month of\nAugust in each of the years 2000-2002 reveals that a significant percentage of the post-arraignment pre-trial\ninmates admitted to OCCF (either the old or the new facility) after being charged with misdemeanors or civil\nviolations had prior felony criminal histories or gang affiliations, which might make them greater security risks\n[9]\nthan the charges pending against them indicated.\nJail officials rightly view gang affiliation as a serious security risk. During the past two years, OCCF has housed\napproximately 1,000 gang members from approximately 51 different gangs. [Hefferon Direct ¶ 12]. These have\nincluded members of gangs well-known for their violence, including the Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Netas,\nPagans, BBK (Bankard Barrio Kings), and Ching-a-lings. On any given day there are approximately 50 gang\nmembers incarcerated at OCCF. [Hefferon Direct ¶ 13]. In the years 2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively,\napproximately 42%, 40%, and 50% of those gang members were being held on misdemeanor or lesser charges.\nGang members are often more violent, dangerous, and manipulative than other inmates, regardless of the nature\nof the charges against them. [DX 50A, at 117; Hefferon Direct ¶ 15; Tr. 391-92 (Fraser Testimony)]. They are also\nmore likely than other inmates to attempt to coerce family members or to coerce, cajole, or intimidate lesser\nviolators into smuggling contraband into the facility. [DX 49B, at ¶ 32]. One of the best ways of identifying gang\nmembers is by examining markings and tattoos on their bodies. [Hefferon Direct ¶¶ 12-14].\nFinally, officials at a county jail like OCCF usually know very little about the new inmates they receive or the\nsecurity risks they present at the time of their arrival. Ironically, prison officials are often at an advantage here,\nsince sentenced inmates arrive after being convicted and after the preparation of a pre-sentence report (which is\n49 theoretically supposed to contain details about the inmate's past).[10]*49 Moreover, many inmates arrive at\nprisons from jails, where they have been incarcerated and already evaluated for potential security risks (a\nprocedure known as \"classification,\" which will be discussed extensively below).\nBoth experts and Mr. Fraser agreed that thorough Admission Searches of all arriving inmates are the best way to\nmaintain the security level necessary for keeping serious and dangerous contraband out of OCCF. [Tr. 339-450\n(Camp Testimony); Tr. 198, 218-19 (DeRosa Testimony); DX 50A, at 16-18 (DeRosa Dep.); Fraser Direct ¶ 4]. All\njail personnel who testified at this trial, including plaintiffs' expert, Robert Joseph DeRosa, testified that, if they\ncould, they would strip search every newly arrived inmate, regardless of what brought him or her to their facility,\nin order to minimize the risk of introduction of contraband. [Tr. 219 (DeRosa Testimony); Tr. 447 (Camp\nTestimony); Tr.]. So strongly do the corrections people feel about this that Fraser testified, credibly, that not until\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the motion for rehearing en banc in Shain did\nofficials at Rikers Island finally stop strip searching every new inmate who arrived at Rikers. [Tr. 393-94 (Fraser\nTestimony)]. Thereafter, Rikers personnel modified their strip search procedures for certain type of inmates to the\nextent of acquiring hospital gowns, which allows inmates to remain clothed while they squat and cough00a\n97\nprocess that, according to Mr. DeRosa, is generally sufficient to dislodge any contraband contained in the anal or\nvaginal areas. [Tr. 183].\n\nB. OCCF Strip Search Policies\nI find as a matter of fact that until the new jail opened in the summer of 2001, it was the policy at OCCF for each\nand every newly-arrived inmate to be subjected to an on-arrival strip search, in the manner described above,\nwithout regard to the nature of the charges against the inmate or any reason to suspect that he/she might be\ncarrying contraband. Indeed, defendants, through counsel, stipulated that prior to the time when OCCF moved to\nits present facility the policy was to conduct on-arrival strip searches on every newly-arrived inmate. [Tr. 16].\nMoreover, I credit the testimony of Corrections Officers Enos VanAmburgh, James Ognibene III, Christine\nMertens (for females), Thomas C. Hefferon, and Robert Crosby on this point. These officers were all assigned\nduring relevant periods to work in the jail's Booking and Receiving area. All of them testified, credibly, that every\nsingle new arrival at OCCF was strip searched without regard to the nature of the crime charged, the\ncircumstances of the arrest, or particular characteristics of the arrestee. Their testimony was confirmed by the\ndeposition testimony of defendant Bigger, who was the sheriff of Orange County from 1995 through the end of\n2002. [PX 22, at 5-22]. Sheriff Bigger's deposition revealed that new arrivals were strip searched even if they\nwere able to make bail and were not being admitted to the general population. [PX 22, at 20-21].\nIn or about March 2000, use of the term \"personal hygiene check\" began at OCCF. I find, based on the credible\ntestimony from Ognibene and the fair inferences drawn from the deposition of Bigger, that a \"personal hygiene\ncheck\" and a \"strip search\" were de facto the same. As Corrections Officer Ognibene testified, \"[t]he names\n[11]\nchanged, but the search remained the same.\" [Tr. 89].  I do not credit the testimony of Capt. Ryan or any other\nwitness who stated that there were differences between the \"strip search\" and the \"hygiene check\" as carried out\nat OCCF.\n50 *50 When OCCF moved to the new jail, new booking and receiving facilities, containing new and improved\ndevices for detecting contraband, were suddenly available. At that point, the County promulgated the \"August\n2001 Policy.\" [DX 29]. That policy provided that Admissions Searches \"may be conducted\" on all inmates charged\nwith felonies, and those inmates charged with misdemeanors or lesser offenses when any of the following factors\nwas present: \"(a) Committed sentenced inmate/weekenders; (b) Committed probation/parole violator; (c)\nWeapons or narcotics offenses; (d) Known gang affiliation; (e) Prior or current escape charges; (f) Committed for\na felony; (g) Prior or current contraband charges; (h) Known history of contraband charges; (i) Metal detector/\nboss chair activation; (j) Inmate that appears under the influence of drugs/alcohol; (j) Currently suicidal inmate;\n[12]\n(k) Prior suicidal history in past 10 years.\" Id.\nAt the preliminary injunction hearing in Dodge, both Captain Joseph Ryan, OCCF's Day Shift Commander, and\nhis subordinate Lieutenant Dominic De Marco testified00credibly00that the new policy was implemented to give\n97 97\ncorrections officers under their command as little discretion as possible about whether or not to conduct strip\nsearches. 209 F.R.D. 65, 73. Thus, while the August 2001 Policy purported (on its face) to list circumstances\nwhere an officer \"may\" conduct a strip search, the policy, in effect, listed the factors that mandated a strip search.\nAs a result, at least some strip searches were conducted that violated the reasonable suspicion rule of Shain.\nIndeed, this Court entered a preliminary injunction in Dodge after finding that newly arrived inmates were strip\nsearched, pursuant to the August 2001 Policy, without reasonable suspicion to believe that they might be\n[13]\nsecreting contraband.\nThe only inmate testimony concerning strip searches during the period when the August 2001 Policy was in effect\ncame from the three inmates who testified during the Dodge preliminary injunction hearing. Nonetheless, that\nstrip searches were carried out during that period without reasonable suspicion to believe that the inmate was\nsecreting contraband was confirmed by several corrections officers, who testified (credibly) that the policy of strip\nsearching all or virtually all new arrivals at OCCF did not really change until 2002. [Tr. 519-20 (Officer Jo-Ann\nMance); Tr. 545 (Officer Nancy Duryea); Tr. 549-50 (Officer Joseph Alvarado)]. Additionally, I have no basis to\nreconsider my findings, made in Dodge, that Wallace Babcock, who was arrested at the Orange County Court-\nhouse when he went there voluntarily to try to resolve arrearages in child support payments and transported to\nOCCF, was strip searched without reasonable suspicion to believe that he was carrying contraband. See209\n[14]\nF.R.D. at 70.\n\n51 After this Court entered the preliminary injunction in Dodge, OCCF again revised *51 its strip search policy. [DX\n30]. That new \"August 2002 Policy\" provides that a strip search \"may be conducted\" if any one of the following\nfactors exists: \"(A) Committed sentenced inmate/weekender; (B) Committed for Felony offense (Sentenced or\nUnsentenced); [and] (C) Weapons or Narcotics offenses.\" Id. Again, I find that \"may\" means \"must\" when used in\nthe August 2002 Policy with respect to those factors.\nIn addition, the policy provides that a strip search may be conducted when there is \"[r]easonable suspicion that a\nlegally committed inmate is concealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime charged, the particular\ncharacteristics of the arrestee, and/or circumstances of the arrest (if available).\" Id. The policy explicitly states\nthat the an officer may consider the following characteristics of the arrestee when determining whether\nreasonable suspicion exists: \"(1) Known Gang Member; (b) Prior or Current escape charges; (c) Inmate has prior\nor current contraband charges; (d) Metal Detector, Boss Chair, Hand held Magnetometer activation ...; (e) Inmate\nappears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol; (f) Currently suicidal inmate; (g) Inmate has history of\nsuicidal behavior; (h) Inmate displays assaultive behavior; [and] (i) Inmates disposition (nervous, fidgety,\nsweating, uncooperative, distracting).\" Id. The policy further provides that an officer who develops reasonable\nsuspicion that an unsentenced misdemeanor or violation arrestee is concealing contraband must obtain approval\nfrom a supervisor before performing a strip search. Id. By its terms, the August 2002 Policy does not require\nsupervisory approval before strip searching sentenced inmates or those accused of felonies or weapons or\nnarcotics offenses.\nC. OCCF Procedures\n1. Admitting\nThe process of admitting a newly arrived inmate takes place in an area of the facility known as Booking and\nReceiving. (A diagram of the Booking and Receiving Area is attached to this opinion as Ex. 2). Having toured this\narea, I find that it is a large00indeed, huge00open hall with a booking desk in the center. It is ringed with five\n97 97\nseparate holding cells, each of which can house multiple inmates.\nThe following constitutes my findings of fact concerning the procedures followed to admit new arrivals to OCCF\n[15]\nsince of August of 2002, after the short-lived preliminary injunction was entered in Dodge.\n52 *52 Inmates arrive at OCCF in shackles and restraints and are discharged at a sallyport outside the Booking and\nReceiving area. Usually, staff at OCCF are alerted that a vehicle transporting inmates will be arriving so they are\nprepared to process the inmates when they arrive. [Tr. 423-25 (Camp Testimony)]. The inmates typically are met\nby two OCCF Booking and Receiving officers, who review the inmates' securing orders to make sure that OCCF\nis authorized to receive them. If this paperwork is satisfactory, the OCCF officers escort them inside OCCF into\nthe Booking and Receiving area. [Tr. 424; Camp Direct ¶¶ 3-10].\nInside the OCCF Booking and Receiving area, the officer lines the arriving inmates up against an interior wall,\nasks them if they have anything in their pockets (such as drugs, weapons, or needles), and then conducts a pat-\nsearch. Any items taken from the inmate are placed in a plastic bag. [Tr. 424; Camp Direct ¶¶ 19-25]. At that\npoint, the inmate is issued an institutional jump suit and is taken to a semi-private \"changing room.\" It is at this\npoint that an inmate who is going to be strip searched is strip searched.\nAs described above, the August 2002 policy provides that the following categories of inmates are automatically\nsubjected to strip searches upon their arrival to OCCF: (1) all sentenced inmates, (2) all inmates who have been\ncommitted to OCCF for a felony offense (whether or not they have been sentenced, or even tried), (3) all inmates\ncharged with drug or weapons offenses, and (4) all inmates who are returning from court or work details\n(regardless of the nature of the charges lodged against them). [DX 30]. If a corrections officer concludes that an\ninmate falls into one of these categories and conducts a strip search, he must note that fact on a form called an\n\"Admissions Strip Search Report.\" [DX 20L].\n\nIf the new arrival is charged with a misdemeanor or violation or is civilly committed, and the offense does not\ninvolve drugs or weapons, the written policy states that the corrections officer on duty must assess the inmate's\nindividual circumstances to determine whether there is reasonable suspicion to conduct an Admission Search.\n[DX 30; DX 20L]. If a booking and receiving officer believes that such reasonable suspicion exists, the officer first\nmust then secure the approval of a supervisor before a strip search can be performed. [Tr. 280 (Ryan Testimony);\nDX 20L]. If the supervisor approves, then both the officer and the supervisor must execute an Admission Strip\nSearch Report, and the supervisor also must describe on that form the \"reasonable suspicion\" that provided the\n[16]\nbasis for the search. [DX 20L].\nAny strip search is conducted by an OCCF officer of the same sex in a semi-private changing room that has\nopaque glass on a portion of the window in the door. This prevents other inmates or staff from observing what is\nhappening. [Tr. 425, 481-82 (Camp Testimony); Camp Direct ¶ 35]. The officer never touches the inmate during a\nstrip search, which is carried out in the manner described above. As soon as the search is concluded, the inmate\nputs on the institutional jumpsuit. The balance of his or her belongings is placed in a plastic bag for deposit with\nthe OCCF property clerk. [Tr. 425].\nThere is no evidence in this record that any inmate has complained of being physically or sexually abused by\n53 OCCF staff *53 during an Admission Search, that any inmate has filed an internal grievance alleging such\nabuses, or that any such abuses have occurred.\nOnce the inmate has changed into the institutional jumpsuit, he or she then is walked through the metal detector\nand required to sit in the Body Orifice Security Scanner (\"BOSS\") chair. The BOSS chair is a non-intrusive, high\nsensitivity detector designed to detect metal objects hidden in body cavities. It is used to screen inmates for\nweapons and contraband objects that might be hidden in anal, oral, vaginal, and nasal cavities. [DX 20M]. It will\nnot pick up non-metallic items such as drugs, cigarettes, or money. The BOSS Chair is not foolproof, but it\nenhances any other search conducted on an arriving inmate. [Tr. 246-47 (DeRosa Testimony)].\nThe BOSS scan comes after most inmates who are going to be strip searched have already been strip searched.\n[17]\n[Tr. 425 (Camp Testimony)].  Though nothing in the record indicates as much, I presume that if an inmate who\nwas not previously subjected to a strip search sets off the BOSS chair, he or she is returned to the changing area\nand strip searched under the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard.\nAfter clearing the BOSS Chair, the inmate is placed in one of the OCCF's holding cells, usually directly opposite\nthe booking area so inmates can be observed by corrections officers. [Tr. 425; Camp Direct ¶¶ 9-17]. Later, the\ninmate is interviewed by an OCCF booking officer to obtain the pedigree information necessary to complete\nvarious forms and the answers to suicide screening questions. [Tr. 425; Camp Direct ¶¶ 1-6; DX 20-20-L,\n20N-20O]. All the pertinent information about the new inmates in these forms is self-reported. [Tr. 289 (Ryan\nTestimony)].\nAfter the inmate's paperwork has been completed, he is fingerprinted and, if he is charged with a crime (either\nfelony or misdemeanor), his fingerprints are forwarded to the New York State Department of Criminal Justice\nServices (\"NYSDCJS\") to confirm his true identity. Under New York law, OCCF is not permitted to forward to\nNYSDCJS the fingerprints of persons remanded for civil violations, persons remanded for family court non-\npayments, or immigration detainees. OCCF must destroy these fingerprints when the inmate is discharged. [Tr.\n281 (Ryan Testimony)].\nFinally, the inmate receives a medical assessment by one of the OCCF nurses.\n54 Once all the paperwork and assessments required during the booking and receiving *54 process are completed,\nthe inmate is escorted to a new housing unit, where he or she will remain pending completion of the classification\nand assessment process. [Hefferon Direct ¶ 6]. Inmates are housed as follows: Alpha 1 houses adult and juvenile\nmen without acute medical problems or a history of prior suicide attempt or current suicidal ideation; Bravo 4\nhouses suicidal males, adult and juvenile; Bravo 1 houses all newly-arrived females, adult and juvenile,\nregardless of suicidal ideation; Medical 1 houses adult and juvenile males with acute medical (non-psychiatric)\nproblems; and Medical 2 houses adult and juvenile females with acute medical (non-psychiatric) problems.\n\nOCCF believes that there is no need for a more elaborate housing assignment at the pre-classification stage\nbecause the new arrivals00regardless of the nature or severity of the charges pending against them00are kept\n97 97\n[18]\nconfined to their cells for twenty three hours a day until the classification process is complete.  They leave\ntheir cells only for one hour of daily recreation, a fifteen-minute shower, and necessary medical or legal visits.\n[19]\n[Ryan Direct ¶ 19; July 25, 2003 Letter to the Court]. Meals are taken in the cells.  As a result, newly-arrived\nand pre-classified inmates do not have the same opportunity that classified inmates do to intermingle with others\nin the housing unit00or, presumably, to pass contraband from one to another.\n97\n2. Classification\nUnder New York law, see N.Y. Correct. Law § 500-b (McKinney 2003), OCCF is required to classify inmates for\nhousing assignments and supervision levels according to the risks that they present. [Ryan Direct ¶ 21].\nThe classification process at OCCF begins shortly after the new inmate arrives. [Hefferon Direct ¶ 5]. The\npaperwork completed in Booking and Receiving is forwarded to the Classification Department so that it can start\nto assemble the information necessary to classify the inmate in accordance with New York law. Id. at ¶ 6.\nClassification requires an assessment of the inmate's criminal history, current charge(s), pending detainers,\ncurrent or prior disciplinary problems at OCCF or any other correctional institution, problems adjusting to\nconfinement, amount of bail, propensity for victimization, escape or contraband risk, aggressive behavior, history\nof bail jumping, or any other factor that may be required to properly evaluate the danger a particular inmate\npresents. [DX 40B-2, at 17 (Ryan Dep.)].\nClassification officers record their overall assessment on a worksheet to develop the security score that defines\nthe inmate's classification level: minimum custody, low medium custody, high medium custody, or maximum\ncustody. [DX 40B-2, at 17 (Ryan Dep.); Ognibene Direct ¶ 6; Van Amburgh Direct ¶ 6]. This custody level is used\nto ensure that the inmate only receives housing and work assignments that are compatible with the security risk\nthat he or she presents. [Tr. 93 (Ryan Testimony)].\nUnder New York law, the classification officers at OCCF have seven days to complete the classification of new\ninmates. [Hefferon Direct ¶ 10]. The testimony at trial indicated that the classification process at OCCF usually\nwas completed within three to five days. [Ryan Direct ¶ 21].\n55 OCCF obtains criminal history information about newly arrived inmates during *55 the classification process.\nCriminal history is derived from so-called \"File 15\" reports, also known as \"rap sheets.\" To obtain these reports,\nOCCF (or any other law enforcement facility) must have access to a NYSPIN terminal. At OCCF, the NYSPIN\nterminal is located in a secure room within the Classification Department, which is about 600 feet away from the\nBooking and Receiving area. Captain Ryan testified that the County has placed the NYSPIN terminal in the\nClassifications Department to control access to and the use of the rap sheets that are generated. According to\nCaptain Ryan, this is necessary due to New York State rules restricting dissemination of the File 15 reports\n[20]\nbecause of privacy and confidentiality requirements. [Ryan Direct ¶ 15].\nCriminal history information about an arriving inmate, in the form of a File 15, can be (and generally is) obtained\nexpeditiously. Former Corrections Officer Enos Van Amburgh worked for approximately eight and a half years in\nthe jail's Classification Department. It was his job to run rap sheets on every inmate processed at the Orange\nCounty Jail (the old facility). Van Amburgh did so as soon as he received the paperwork from booking. [Tr. 12].\nCustomarily it took him only a couple of minutes to generate a File 15 on an inmate. Id. Although, in Van\nAmburgh's experience, there were occasions where attempts to secure a File 15 were delayed, this did not\nhappen often. [Tr. 13]. In the eight and a half years that Van Amburgh worked in classification, the terminal\nprobably went down only \"five times, six times,\" [Tr. 15], and when the terminal was down, it could be back up in\nfive minutes. While it has happened that the terminal was down for up to three or four hours, [Tr. 13-14], I\nconclude, based on Van Amberg's testimony, that this happened no more than five times during an eight and a\nhalf year time span. The terminal was never down for as many as eight hours when Van Amburgh was there. [Tr.\n14].\n\nCapt. Ryan acknowledged that the time from when the NYSPIN terminal receives the inmate's name and social\nsecurity number to when it provides the File 15 could be as quick as the time it takes to log onto a website. [Tr.\n95]. All that is needed to generate a File 15 is the inmate's name, social security number, and date of birth. [Tr.\n320]. He also conceded that the terminal operates under normal conditions most of the time. [Tr. 95]. Capt. Ryan\ntestified that the system is \"booted,\" usually \"once or twice a month.\" Id. But there is no evidence in the record\ntending to show that this adversely affects the turnaround time to generate File 15's or otherwise delays the in-\nprocessing of inmates. I recognize that, hypothetically, a computer malfunction could slow the process down\nconsiderably. But on the record before me I cannot conclude that this happens with any frequency.\nRap sheets are generated based on self-reported information, and not until fingerprints have been compared is it\npossible to confirm that the arrestee is in fact the person he says he is. Fingerprint confirmation normally takes\nmore than a week to get to OCCF. [Ryan Direct ¶ 21]. Of course, some arrestees' identities cannot be confirmed\nvia fingerprint check. If an arrestee has not previously been finger-printed 00for example, if he or she has never\n97\nbefore been involved with the criminal justice system00then there is no way for corrections officers to obtain\n97\n56 absolute identity confirmation. Nonetheless, corrections *56 officers evaluate those inmates and make risk\nassessments about them, based on self-reported information.\nI conclude that corrections officers do rely on self-reported information in making classifications and risk\nassessments. Moreover, in the absence of data indicating that significant numbers of new arrivals at OCCF turn\nout to be lying about who they are00and there is no hard data on that issue in this record00I conclude that File 15s\n97 97\ngenerated on the basis of self-reported data are generally reliable. Lacking any evidence of how frequently new\narrivals at OCCF attempt to mask their identity, I cannot and do not conclude that rap sheets are per se unreliable\nor could not be used by corrections officers as one piece of information in making preliminary assessments\n[21]\nduring the booking and receiving process.\nNothing prevents the operator of the NYSPIN terminal from sharing with officers in Booking and Receiving\ninformation in a new arrival's File 15 criminal history during the booking and receiving process. As Capt. Ryan put\nit, \"There's no reason why anybody can't communicate any information to anybody.\" [Tr. 97]. However, booking\nofficers at OCCF do not receive criminal history information from Classification Officers during in-processing of\nnew arrivals.\nIn addition, Orange County maintains computerized \"prior commitment\" records that contain information about\npersons formerly admitted to the facility. These records are generated and maintained by the County as a part of\ntheir classification process. [PX 40].\nUpon completion of the classification process, the inmate is assigned to a more permanent housing unit, where\nhe or she dwells with other inmates who are similarly classified in terms of their security risk and who are not\nconsidered a threat to the new inmate. [Ryan Direct ¶ 21]. A typical housing unit, therefore, may contain inmates\ncharged with misdemeanors and/or felonies, inmates remanded under civil commitments, and immigration\ndetainees, as long as all of these inmates pose approximately the same security risk. Id.\n3. Information Available (or Not Available) at the Time of the Booking\nand Receiving Process\nAs noted above, a new arrival at OCCF brings with him a securing order from the court that arraigned him and\ncommitted him to OCCF's custody. This order contains minimal information about the inmate, typically consisting\nof only the name the arrested individual gave to the arresting agency, the charge pending against him, and\n57 information concerning bail (e.g., *57 the amount bail was set for). [DX 18]. Thus, securing orders generally do\nnot contain detailed information relevant to an assessment of whether there is reasonable suspicion to believe\nthat a new arrival at OCCF might be secreting contraband, except for the crime charged. [Tr. 236 (DeRosa\nTestimony)].\nBooking and receiving officers at OCCF, who are charged with in-processing new arrivals and making decisions\nabout matters like whom to strip search, receive no information other than the securing order that arrives with the\n\nprisoner. They are not provided with the File 15 \"rap sheet\" generated by OCCF's Classification Department.\nThey are not even provided with information about whether the new arrival had previously been incarcerated at\nOCCF, although that information is maintained at the jail.\nCaptain Ryan's testimony concerning why information generated within OCCF itself is not provided to officers in\nBooking and Receiving makes no sense. He testified that rap sheets are not made available to booking officers\nbecause the information contained therein is \"privileged\" (though he did not explain the nature of the privilege),\nand he indicated that it was undesirable for such information to be disseminated to staff members, lest they take\na dislike to a particular prisoner, which he deemed not \"beneficial to good operations.\" [Tr. 96-97]. He did not\nexplain why this particular concern overrode giving Booking and Receiving personnel information that would help\nthem do their job of evaluating arriving inmates for reasonable suspicion of contraband, or how it was that the use\nof this \"privileged\" information by the officers who work in Classifications did not give rise to the same concerns.\n[22]\nThere is also information elsewhere in the system that might be made available to the booking and receiving\nofficers who are in-processing new arrestees. For example, every arresting officer on a police force in the State\nof New York is required to prepare a police arrest report, containing information about the circumstances of the\narrest and information about a suspect. [Tr. 152]. These reports are not confidential [Tr. 153], and nothing in the\nlaw would prevent a police agency from giving a copy of an arrest report to whoever is transporting a detainee to\nOCCF or from faxing the arrest report to jail.\nThe City of Middletown is one of the largest jurisdictions within Orange County. According to its former police\nchief, Louis Ogden, officers of the Middletown Police Department routinely tell sheriff's deputies who arrive to\ntransport newly arraigned arrestees to OCCF about anything that the deputies ought to know concerning the\nindividuals they are transporting, including information about the perceived dangerousness of the detainee.\nPlaintiffs' expert witness, Robert DeRosa, testified credibly that when a new inmate arrived at Rikers Island, in\nNew York City, where he served as deputy warden and warden of the Anna M. Kross Center for approximately\nseven years, the inmate brought with him a File 15 rap sheet generated at Central Booking, as well as a securing\norder and arrest ticket (a form containing pedigree information and fingerprints). [Tr. 239-43 (DeRosa Testimony)].\nThe rap sheet was generated by classifications officers within New York City Corrections. Id. at 241. Of course,\n58 the situation at Rikers differs from *58 the situation at OCCF in two rather obvious particulars. First, Rikers is a\nmuch larger and busier institution. Furthermore, it receives all its prisoners from a single police department, not\nfrom thirty seven different jurisdictions. However, that police department00the NYPD00is a gigantic decentralized\n97 97\npolice department, with thousands of officers scattered over five separate counties, each of which is significantly\nlarger than Orange County in terms of population.\nPersonnel who transport prisoners from the various municipalities to OCCF and OCCF Corrections Officers are\nnot trained in how to gather information from other law enforcement agencies within Orange County. [Tr. 319\n(Ryan Testimony)].\nAt no time have OCCF officials asked the various municipalities that feed inmates into the jail to devise a system\nfor sharing information about new arrestees that could be used to make the kind of individualized assessment\nabout the risk of contraband carriage that is required by existing Second Circuit case law. Id. at 317-18.\nTherefore, no one knows whether it is possible to devise a workable information sharing system with the multiple\njurisdictions involved. Captain Ryan thinks it would be \"pretty much impossible,\" [Tr. 277], while Chief Ogden\nbelieves that if the County simply directed local law enforcement to provide it with information, the authorities\nwould readily comply. Chief Ogden testified credibly that, while he was Chief, he would have told his officers to\nprovide sheriff's deputies with File 15s and arrest reports if asked to do so. [Tr. 166-67].\nThe experience of New York City strongly suggests that it would be possible to devise procedures that would\nrequire local law enforcement agencies to transmit material in addition to the securing order with a prisoner who\nwas being sent to OCCF. Moreover, contrary to the testimony of OCCF officials, New York State regulations\nregarding NYSPIN security do not appear to bar the sharing of File 15s among law enforcement agencies. See\nN.Y. Comp.Codes R. & Revs. tit. 9, § 486.4 (2003).\n\n4. Compliance (or Non-Compliance) with the August 2002 Strip Search\nPolicy\nOn July 26, 2002, this Court entered a preliminary injunction in the Dodge case, in which I directed that OCCF\ncomply with the mandate of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as handed down in Shain. I\nthus enjoined the defendants in Dodge to conduct strip searches of newly-arrived inmates only when they had\nreason to believe the new arrival might be secreting contraband, based on (1) the nature of the crime charged;\n(2) the circumstances of the arrest; and (3) the particular characteristics of the arrestee. [DX 33]. The injunction\ndid not direct OCCF personnel to adopt any particular policies or procedures in order to effect this result, leaving\nall such matters to the sound discretion of experts in penology. The court simply and solely directed defendants\nto comply with the Constitution as interpreted by the Second Circuit in Shain.\nThe Dodge injunction expired ninety days later, pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"). See 18\nU.S.C. § 3626(a)(2) (\"Preliminary injunctive relief shall automatically expire on the date that is 90 days after its\nentry, unless the court makes the findings required under subsection (a)(1) for the entry of prospective relief and\n[23]\nmakes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period.\").\n59 *59 Shortly after the Dodge injunction was entered, OCCF adopted the August 2002 strip search policy. OCCF\ncontends that it voluntarily continues to follow this policy, even though the Dodge injunction has expired. Plaintiffs\ncontend that this is a paper policy only, and that it is routinely disregarded. Defendants demur.\nAt trial, plaintiffs presented testimony from ten witnesses, all of whom were arrested after the August 2002 policy\nwent into effect, and all of whom insisted that they had been strip searched upon their initial arrival at OCCF,\ndespite the fact that they were arrested for misdemeanors or civil violations and that officers had no probable\ncause to believe that they were carrying contraband. Defendants presented testimony from the corrections\nofficers who in-processed these individuals. What follows are my findings of fact concerning these incidents.\nBecause the individuals whose stories are told below are all members of the plaintiff class, and both sides have\nrequested a jury trial on the subject of damages, these findings of fact pertain solely to the injunctive phase of the\ncase.\na. Gary Luke\nGary Luke was admitted to the Orange County Jail on or about October 5, 2002, on a bench warrant arising out\nof a violation of probation and a charge of injuring an animal (a Class \"A\" Misdemeanor). Upon his arrival at the\nreceiving area, he was ordered by the corrections officers to remove all of his clothes, squat down, lift his\ngenitals, and spread the cheeks of his buttocks for the officers' visual inspection. The record does not indicate the\nnature of the underlying charge or the nature of the violation, but Luke testified without contradiction that it had\nnothing to do with either drugs or weapons. [PX 4; Tr. 19; DX 68]. Luke was admitted to the general population.\nThere is no dispute that Luke was strip searched on arrival at OCCF; the appropriate paperwork so indicates. [DX\n68]. The corrections officer who supervised Luke's admission to the jail was David Myers. Myers had no\nrecollection of Luke's arrival independent of his paperwork, although he knew Luke from prior incarcerations at\n[24]\nOCCF.  However, the Strip Search Report that is part of Luke's file indicates that Luke appeared to be under\nthe influence of \"drugs or alcohol\" when he arrived at the jail. He had eleven pull tabs on his person, and during\nquestioning Luke admitted to having a prior problem with alcohol. Based on his appearance and property\ninventory, Luke obtained supervisor consent to conduct a strip search and prepared the appropriate paperwork,\nwith supervisory sign-off as required by the policy.\n60 *60 I find that Officer Myers did not have reasonable suspicion to conclude that Luke might be secreting\ncontraband on his person, so as to justify an on-arrival strip search. Myers had no suspicion whatever that Luke\nwas under the influence of drugs. Eleven pop top cans does indeed suggest the influence of alcohol, but Luke\nappeared to be drunk, nothing more. There is no evidence in this record that alcohol abuse is correlated with\n\nefforts to introduce into the facility contraband of the sort that can be hidden in the anus or genitalia. See Dodge,\n209 F.R.D. at 76-77, and cases cited. Moreover, alcohol intoxication is not a per se reason to conduct a strip\nsearch; it is merely a factor that an officer can consider. In Luke's case, the evidence suggests that the officer\nsearched Luke simply and solely because he believed that the jail's policy allowed him to search any newly\n[25]\narrived inmates who appeared to by drunk. [Myers Direct ¶ 8].\nb. John MacChurch\nJohn MacChurch was admitted to the Orange County Jail on February 27, 2003 for failure to pay child support.\nUpon his arrival at the receiving area he claims he was brought to a separate room where he was ordered by the\ncorrections officers to remove all of his clothes, squat down, lift his genitals, and spread the cheeks of his\nbuttocks for the officers' visual inspection. None of the circumstances surrounding MacChurch's arrest involved\nthe use or possession of drugs or weapons. [PX 49; Tr. 25].\nDefendants contend that MacChurch was strip searched during a cell shakedown, not during MacChurch's\nadmission to OCCF. [Tr. 29-30]. The \"no search\" box on MacChurch's Admissions Strip Search Report was\nchecked off, [PX 60A], but no corrections officer testified about the MacChurch search or about his admission to\nOCCF.\nAfter hearing MacChurch testify, I find him to be a credible witness and conclude he was strip searched without\nreasonable suspicion in violation of OCCF's stated policy.\nc. Demorris Reed\nDemorris Reed was admitted to the Orange County Jail in February 2003 for failure to pay child support (Family\nArticle 4). His arrest did not involve the use or possession of drugs or weapons. [PX 46; Tr. 32]. Nonetheless, he\nclaims that, upon his arrival at the receiving area, he was ordered by the corrections officers to remove all of his\nclothes, squat down, lift his genitals, and spread the cheeks of his buttocks for the officers' visual inspection.\nReed was admitted to the general population.\nCorrections Officer William Proscia received Reed at OCCF. Proscia testified that he was going to strip search\nhim because high bail ($7,000) had been set for the prisoner, which caused Proscia to wonder if he might have\nbeen charged with a felony. [Tr. 537]. However, he stated that a supervisor overruled him, and so he did not\nconduct the search. I do not credit this testimony, largely because Officer Proscia testified that the strip search\npolicy at OCCF in 1999 and 2000 was otherwise than I have found it to be. [Tr. 533-34]. I find that Reed was in\nfact strip searched upon arrival at OCCF, without reasonable suspicion and in violation of jail policy.\nReed was again admitted on April 9, 2003 for endangering the welfare of a child (a Class \"A\" Misdemeanor). He\n61 claims that he was subjected to a strip search at the jail in the same manner as before. *61 Reed testified that the\nnotation in the Admission Strip Search Report, [DX 61B, 61C], which indicates that he was not strip searched, is\n\"wrong.\" [Tr. 38-39].\nThis time, Reed's admitting officer was Joseph Alvarado. Alvarado has no recollection of admitting him, and\ntestified only to the procedure that he should have followed, since he checked the \"no search\" box on the\nAdmissions Strip Search Report. Since Alvarado is not able to controvert Reed's testimony, I accept it as true.\nThere were violations of OCCF's strip search policy in Reed's case.\nd. Delacy Brandon-Abraham\nDelacy Brandon-Abraham was admitted to the Orange County Jail in February 2003 for violation of an Order of\nProtection (Family Article 4). She claims that, upon her arrival and before being placed in a cell, a female\ncorrections officer escorted her to a room and ordered her to remove all of her clothes; squat down; and expose\nher breasts, female genitalia, and anal cavity for visual inspection. None of the circumstances surrounding the\n\narrest involved the use or possession of drugs, weapons, or contraband. [PX 47; Tr. 40]. Brandon-Abraham\ntestified that the notation in the Admission Strip Search Report indicating that she was not strip searched, [DX\n53A], is not correct. [Tr. 45-46]. Brandon-Abraham was admitted to the general population.\nCorrections Officer Jo-Ann Mance-Saenz in-processed Brandon-Abraham, whom she recalls as a \"large woman\"\nwho \"arrived at the OCCF with a substantial amount of candy.\" [Mance-Saenz Direct ¶ 7]. After pat-searching\nBrandon-Abraham, she took her into a changing room, with a jump suit. Per standard procedure, she asked\nBrandon-Abraham to remove all of her clothing other than her undergarments, so she could do a routine check\nfor contraband under the armpits, between the toes, and in the hair. Apparently, Brandon-Abraham was not\nwearing any undergarments00a fact that Officer Mance-Saenz learned only when the inmate removed her outer\n97\nclothing. Officer Mance-Saenz told her to put on a jump suit and went in search of some underwear that would fit\nher. Since this was not an Admissions \"strip search\" as defined above, Officer Mance-Saenz filled out the\npaperwork accordingly.\nI credit the testimony of Officer Mance-Saenz. There was no violation of OCCF strip search policy in Brandon-\nAbraham's case.\ne. Jeremiah Westford\nJeremiah Westford (18 years old), Charles Toto (19 years old), and John Watson (17 years old) were admitted to\nOCCF in April 2003. Westford was admitted on charges of criminal possession of stolen property (a Class \"A\"\nMisdemeanor) and consumption of alcohol in a motor vehicle. Watson was charged with criminal possession of\nstolen property and petit larceny (both Class \"A\" Misdemeanors). Toto was charged with criminal possession of\nstolen property (a class \"A\" misdemeanor). Each testified that, upon his arrival at the receiving area, he was\nordered by the corrections officers to remove all of his clothes, squat down, lift his genitals, and spread the\ncheeks of his buttocks for the officers' visual inspection. None of the circumstances surrounding their arrest\ninvolved the use or possession of drugs or weapons. [PX 48; Tr. 174-75]. All testified that the notation in their\nAdmissions Strip Search Report indicating that they were not strip searched was \"a false statement,\" id. at\n176-77, or \"absolutely false,\" id. at 179, or \"wrong.\" Id. at 55-56. All three were bailed out of jail within hours of\ntheir arrival and before they were introduced into the general population.\n62 *62 A single corrections officers, Michael Pfleger, in-processed these three young men. Pfleger testified that upon\ntheir arrival he patted them (and a fourth companion) down, directed them to line up against the wall, and led\nthem, one at a time, to a changing room, where he gave them a plastic bag for their clothes and jump suits into\nwhich they had to change. Pfleger remained at the door of the changing room, looking outside to keep an eye on\nthe other three while one young man changed his clothes in the room. While I find that the young men had to\nremove their clothes (i.e., \"strip\") in the presence of Officer Pfleger, I credit Pfleger's testimony and do not believe\nthat they were \"strip searched\" as that term is used in this case.\nf. Patrick Crowe\nPatrick Crowe was admitted to the Orange County Jail on August 8, 2002 on a charge of petit larceny (a Class\n\"A\" Misdemeanor). He claims that upon his arrival at the receiving area he was ordered by the corrections\nofficers to remove all of his clothes, squat down, lift his genitals, and spread the cheeks of his buttocks for the\nofficers' visual inspection. Crowe testified that the notation in the Admission Strip Search Report that indicates\nthat he was not strip searched, [DX 52A], is \"wrong.\" [Tr. 68, 70]. Crowe was admitted to the general population.\nCorrections Officer William Proscia in-processed Crowe on August 8, 2002. He specifically recalls Crowe\nbecause Crowe was crying during the booking process and was placed on close watch as a potential suicide.\n(Crowe's step-sister had died the previous day.) Proscia claims that he did not strip search Crowe, and that the\ncontemporaneous paperwork confirms this.\nI conclude that Proscia did strip search Crowe. Moreover, he violated OCCF's newly-promulgated policy by not\nobtaining permission from a supervisor prior to conducting the strip search. Under OCCF's August 2002 policy,\n\nsuicidal ideation upon entry is a factor that an officer may consider in determining whether there is reasonable\ncause to believe that the new arrival is secreting contraband. But no single factor is determinative under that\npolicy (unlike the August 2001 Policy, where the presence of any single factor automatically led to a strip search),\nand Proscia did not testify that he had reason to believe that Crowe was secreting contraband on his person. He\nconducted the strip search simply and solely because it appeared to him that the inmate was suicidal. There is no\nevidence in the record from which I can conclude that suicidal ideation upon arrival correlates with likelihood of\ncarriage of contraband.\nThat said, I note that the August 2002 policy was instituted only two days prior to Crowe's arrival at the jail. Under\nthe August 2001 policy, suicidal ideation meant an automatic strip search, with no need to obtain supervisory\napproval. I can well imagine how confusing the whole situation was for corrections officers, who theretofore had\nbeen given00by design00little or no discretion in determining whether or not to strip search an inmate. And inmate\n97 97\nsuicide presents corrections officers with a nightmare scenario. So Proscia's decision to strip search Crowe was\nlikely an innocent mistake. Nonetheless, this strip search contravened both policy and the reasonable suspicion\nstandard.\nCrowe was again admitted to OCCF on August 22, 2002. At that time, he was asked by a corrections officer to\nremove all of his clothing prior to receiving a jump suit to change into. [PX 42; Tr. 57]. Crowe was admitted to the\ngeneral population.\n63 *63 This time the admitting officer was Corrections Officer Joseph Alvarado. Alvarado has no specific recollection\nof admitting Crowe independent of the paperwork, which indicates that no strip search was performed. However,\naccepting Crowe's unrebutted testimony as true, no \"strip search\" as that term is defined by OCCF (and this\nopinion), was performed on that day, although Crowe was required to \"strip.\"\ng. Christina Fabbro\nChristina Fabbro was admitted to the Orange County Jail in March 2003 for issuing a bad check (a Class \"B\"\nMisdemeanor). She claims that, upon her arrival and before being placed in a cell, a female corrections officer\nescorted her to a room and ordered her to remove all of her clothes; squat down; and expose her breasts,\ngenitalia, and anal cavity for visual inspection. During this time Fabbro was menstruating and, once she was\ncompletely naked, she was provided with a sanitary napkin. None of the circumstances surrounding this arrest\ninvolved the use or possession of drugs, weapons, or contraband. [PX 45; Tr. 167-68]. Fabbro testified that the\nnotation in the Admission Strip Search Report that indicates that she was not strip searched, [DX 56A], is \"not\ntrue, because we were strip searched.\" [Tr. 173-74].\nCorrections Officer Nancy Duryea was called out of other duty to in-process Ms. Fabbro on the night of March 27,\n2003. She testified, credibly, that she did not strip search Ms. Fabbro that night (see Admissions Strip Search\nReport dated 3/27/03, part of DX 56G), but did strip search her following a court visit on April 10, 2003. [DX 65, at\n¶¶ 9-10]. Ms. Fabbro was also strip searched following a court visit on April 16, 2003, by Corrections Officer\nDavis. [DX 56G]. Ms. Fabbro's use of the word \"we\" suggests that she is recalling instances when she was strip\n[26]\nsearched after arriving in the company of other inmates, which is consistent with a return from a court visit.\nI find that there was no violation of OCCF policy in Ms. Fabbro's case.\nh. Klaus Rice\nKlaus Rice was admitted to the Orange County Jail on November 14, 2002 for failure to pay child support. [DX\n54E; Tr. 264-65, 268]. Mr. Rice was taken into custody at the Orange County Family Court in Goshen. [Tr. 261].\nHe claims that upon his arrival at the receiving area he was brought to a separate room where he was ordered by\nthe corrections officers to remove all of his clothes, squat down, lift his genitals, and spread the cheeks of his\nbuttocks for the officers' visual inspection. None of the circumstances surrounding his arrest involved the use or\npossession of drugs or weapons. [PX 41; Tr. 260]. Rice testified that the Admissions Strip Search Report that\nindicates he was not strip searched, [DX 54A], is \"incorrect.\" [Tr. 265-266].\n\nCorrections Officer Rick Essig in-processed Mr. Rice. Essig was working as the \"court-prep\" officer that day,\npreparing inmates to go to court and processing those who returned. Apparently, Mr. Rice was taken to OCCF\nwith the inmates who were returning from court visits.\nEssig has no memory of admitting Rice and testified only to the procedures that he should have followed had he\n64 been acting in accordance with OCCF policy. As previously *64 noted, it was standard practice for OCCF\ncorrections officers to strip search any inmate who was returning from a court appearance. Since Rice arrived at\nthe jail with inmates who were returning from court, I find is entirely plausible that he was strip searched just as\nthey were. I find that DX 54A, to the extent it indicates otherwise, is in error.\n5. The Impact of the August 2002 Strip Search Policy on the Presence\nof Contraband at OCCF\nShortly after this court entered the Dodge injunction, stories about the case were published in the Middletown \nTimes Herald Record, which is the principal newspaper in Orange County. Defendants contend that, as the word\ngot out that not everyone who arrived at OCCF would be strip searched, massive amounts of additional\ncontraband were introduced into the facility during the booking and receiving process, thereby resulting in a\n[27]\ntremendous increase in the number of State Reportable Incidents of contraband.  Defendants blame the\nincrease in seizures of contraband within the facility on public disclosure of the Court's injunction, which they\nbelieve has led potential occupants of the jail to believe that they will be able to bring in contraband with impunity.\nPlaintiffs deny that the Dodge preliminary injunction has led to any increase in contraband.\nAfter extensive review of the voluminous materials submitted to me on this question, I side with plaintiffs and\nconclude that, per the credible evidence, there was no change in the number of incidents involving weapons or\ncontraband at OCCF00 at least, no change that can be traced to large amounts of contraband being smuggled\n97\ninto the facility by newly arriving inmates. While I believe that the Dodge injunction is \"responsible\" for the\nincrease in recovery of contraband, it is responsible only in the sense that OCCF officials stepped up their\ninternal surveillance following the issuance of that injunction and altered their policies concerning what they\nwould and would not report to the State. There is no credible evidence in the record indicating that more\ncontraband was smuggled into the facility during initial entry by persons arrested for misdemeanors and civil\nviolations who were not strip searched due to lack of reason to believe that they were carrying contraband.\nThe statistics that follow were compiled by plaintiffs. [PX 11, PX 12, PX 13, PX 14]. The Court re-counted and\narrived at substantially the same results; whatever small differences exist between plaintiffs' count and mine can\nbe accounted for by the fact that different people, working independently, did the classifying. While defendants'\ncounsel claimed during colloquy that the defense disputed the accuracy of plaintiffs' statistics [Tr. 144], they\noffered none of their own to rebut plaintiffs' showing, nor did they explain in what particulars plaintiffs' numbers\nwere not accurate.\nIn 199900at a time when every new arrival at OCCF was strip searched, regardless of reasonable suspicion00there\n97 97\nwere 5,752 inmates admitted. Officers filed 856 officer contraband reports concerning 940 items of contraband.\n65 61 of those items of contraband fell into the category \"Drugs, Alcohol, Meds,\" and 51 items qualified as *65\n[28]\n\"Weapons.\" A total of 17 items of contraband were found in Booking and Receiving.  In that year, the jail filed\nonly 5 S.R.I.\nIn 2000, when strip searches were still mandatory for everyone, 5,578 inmates were admitted to OCCF. Officers\nfiled 410 officer contraband reports covering 464 items of contraband. 62 items of contraband qualifies as \"Drugs,\nAlcohol, Meds,\" and 51 were \"Weapons.\" A total of 14 items of contraband were found in booking and receiving.\nOCCF filed only 4 S.R.I. reports that year.\nIn 200100a year when strip searching was still the rule rather than the exception, but when the new facility\n97\nopened00 5,599 inmates generated a total of 226 officer contraband reports concerning 262 items of contraband,\n97\n\nincluding 62 items of \"Drugs, Alcohol Meds\" and 44 \"Weapons.\" A total of 5 items of contraband were found in\nBooking and Receiving. That year, OCCF filed a mere 2 S.R.I. reports.\nFrom January 2002 through February 2003, there were 5,779 inmates admitted, 205 officer contraband reports\nand 213 items of contraband seized (35 \"Drugs, Alcohol, Meds\" and 31 \"Weapons\"). A total of 20 items of\ncontraband were found in Booking and Receiving. Only 5 S.R.I. reports were filed prior to July 26, 2002, the date\nthe Dodge injunction was entered. Over the next five and a half months, however, OCCF filed 34 S.R.I. reports.\nAs these statistics demonstrate, it is simply not true that there was any dramatic increase00or any increase at\n97\nall00in the amount of contraband at OCCF or in the amount that was recovered at Booking and Receiving (and\n97\nthus, hypothetically, could have come from new arrivals) after the Dodge injunction was entered. What these\nstatistics show is that there were significantly more incidents involving contraband during the time period when\nthe County was strip searching everyone, and that the number of incidents has gone down significantly since the\nnew jail opened and the county's written policy began to reflect the reality of Shain. The smallest amount of\ncontraband00either all contraband or dangerous contraband (drugs and weapons)00was recovered during the\n97 97\nperiod when the County changed its written policy in order to comply with Shain and increased its shakedown\nrate by 500% to 600%. Notably, the number of inmates admitted to the jail has remained relatively constant\nthroughout all the years.\nOf course, the statistics also show something else. During the automatic strip search years, when the number of\nincidents of state reportable contraband was relatively high, OCCF filed fewer than 10 S.R.I. reports a year. Only\nafter this Court issued the preliminary injunction in Dodge, and the parties began to prepare the injunction phase\nof this case for trial, did the number of S.R.I. reports increase to something approximating the number of\ninstances in which reportable contraband was seized. The inescapable inference is that OCCF policy regarding\n66 what to report and what not to report changed at *66 about the time OCCF had a motive to argue that reducing\non-arrival strip searched led to \"a direct, observable negative impact on security at the Facility.\" [PX 31C, at ¶ 29].\nFaced with this clear and compelling inference, Capt. Ryan testified that he had reviewed the internal officer\nreports and found that all incidents that should have been reported to the State since 1999 were in fact reported\n[29]\nto the state.  If Capt. Ryan is telling the truth, then out of the 1,879 officer-reported items of contraband from\nJanuary 1999 through July 26, 2002, only 16 met the state's criteria of a reportable incident. But given that the\nstate's criteria require an S.R.I. report for \"any quantity of marijuana,\" \"drugs other than marijuana that would\nconstitute a crime under the Penal Law,\" and \"any quantity of alcohol,\" [DX 31, at 5-6], the following data\ndemonstrate that Ryan is not telling the truth:\n1. During calendar year 1999, corrections officers at OCCF prepared 61 officer reports concerning\ndrugs, alcohol, and medication. Of this total, 15 reports concerned the recovery of marijuana; 3\nreports were filed concerning heroin; 6 reports were filed concerning cocaine; 3 reports were filed\nconcerning psychotropic medication; and 6 reports were filed concerning alcohol/hooch. All\nappear to be state reportable. As shown above, only 5 S.R.I. reports concerning contraband were\nfiled during 1999.\n2. During calendar year 2000, corrections officers at OCCF prepared 62 officer reports concerning\ndrugs, alcohol, and medication. Of this total, 25 reports concerned the recovery of marijuana; 5\nconcerned the recovery of cocaine/crack; 4 concerned the recovery of alcohol/hooch; and 1\nconcerned the recovery of heroin. During the same period, OCCF filed only 4 S.R.I. reports about\ncontraband.\n3. During calendar year 2001, OCCF corrections officers prepared 62 officer reports concerning\ndrugs, alcohol, and medication. Of this total, 15 reports concerned the recovery of marijuana; 5\nconcerned the recovery of cocaine; 1 concerned the recovery of heroin; and 1 concerned the\nrecovery of alcohol/hooch. OCCF filed 2 S.R.I. reports.\n4. From January 1 through July 26, 2002, officers prepared 35 officer reports concerning the\nrecovery of drugs, alcohol, and medication. Of this total, 10 reports concerned the recovery of\nmarijuana; 5 concerned the recovery of cocaine; 1 concerned the recovery of hashish; 2\n\nconcerned the recovery of paraphernalia (needles); and 1 concerned alcohol/hooch. Only 5 S.R.I.\nreports were filed in connection with these 18 reportable incidents.\nTo summarize: In 1999 there were 33 reportable incidents of drugs and alcohol and only 5 S.R.I. reports; in 2000\nthere were 35 reportable incidents of drugs and alcohol and only 4 S.R.I. reports; in 2001 there were 22\nreportable incidents of drugs and alcohol and only 2 S.R.I. reports; and in 2002 there were 18 reportable\n67 incidents of drugs and alcohol prior to *67 July 26 but only 5 S.R.I. reports. And this only counts drug and alcohol\nincidents. All weapons recoveries are also state reportable as well, and a total of 146 weapons were recovered\nduring the years 1999-2001 00years in which 5 or fewer S.R.I. reports were filed.\n97\nCapt. Ryan testified at trial that the reason for this rather startling discrepancy was officer error:\nDuring that time period, I believe we did have some new officers working in classifications. They\nmay not have been up to speed on what they should have been doing. A lot of times reports are\ninterpreted different ways and an officer may not interpret a report as a reportable incident or\ndidn't know and should have reported it.\n[Tr. at 325]. Thus, in mid-trial, Ryan did an about-face and suggested that the jail was underreporting the number\nof S.R.I.s during the periods prior to the preliminary injunction. [Tr. 347-48]. He attributed the County's past failure\nto report S.R.I.s to \"probably poor communication, judgment by the command staff on whether it was reportable\nor not. Receiving a field test, whether it was positive or negative, things like that.\" [Tr. at 336]. Despite the clear,\nobjective state mandate to report all marijuana and illegal drugs, Ryan pitched the idea that there is \"a fair\namount of senior officers' ... judgment and discretion that goes on in this state reporting process.\" [Tr. 337]. This\nexplanation contradicts Capt. Ryan's sworn testimony in PX 31 and his earlier testimony at trial, [Tr. 110-11], in\nwhich he stated that every State Reportable Incident was in fact reported.\nMoreover, Capt. Ryan acknowledged that at least one of the officers in classifications, Officer Hefferon, has been\nmaking determinations as to which incidents are state reportable in all the years from 1999 to the present.\nAccording to the Captain, Hefferon did not ever change the criteria by which he made (and still makes) those\ndeterminations. [Tr. at 325-326].\nI thus do not credit the explanation advanced at trial for the failure to report dozens of State Reportable Incidents.\nI do, however, accept the fact that there were dozens of State Reportable Incidents that in fact went unreported\nby OCCF during the period prior to the issuance of the Dodge injunction. The disparity between reported and\nreportable incidents in those years undermines, rather than supports, the County's claim that the post-injunction\nspike in S.R.I. reports correlates with a \"major increase\" in the amount of serious contraband entering the facility.\nAnd lest we forget, the only contraband with which we are concerned here is contraband that would have been\nuncovered during an on-arrival strip search of a newly arrived inmate00not contraband smuggled in after court\n97\nvisits or contact visits, or contraband supplied to inmates by errant corrections officers (which, unfortunately, has\nbeen known to happen [Tr. 350-52]). It is not possible to infer from the statistics before me that any significant\namount of additional contraband was being smuggled in by newly arrested and arraigned inmates. Indeed, none\nof the numbers provided to the Court by the parties suggests how much contraband that was recovered at\nBooking and Receiving was recovered from newly arrived inmates (the only group relevant to this proceeding)\nand how much came from inmates who were in-processed at Booking and Receiving after returning from court\nvisits or work details outside the facility.\nWhat it is possible to infer from plaintiffs' statistics is that the amount of contraband recovered at Booking and\nReceiving remained relatively constant over the four years under study:\n68 *68 In 1999, there were 17 instances of contraband recovered at Booking and Receiving.\nIn 2002, there were 14 instances of contraband recovered at Booking and Receiving.\nIn 2001, there were 5 instances of contraband recovered at Booking and Receiving.\nIn 2002, there were 13 instances of contraband recovered at Booking and Receiving.\n\n2001, not 2002 (when there was supposedly a tremendous increase in the amount of contraband being smuggled\ninto the jail), appears to be the atypical year.\nFurthermore, if an increase in contraband inside the facility were attributable to changes in the institution's ability\nto strip search new arrivals, one would expect the amount of contraband recovered at Booking and Receiving to\ngo down, not up, following the entry of the Dodge injunction and the corresponding decrease in on-arrival strip\nsearches. Precisely the opposite occurred0012 of the 13 instances of contraband recovered at Booking and\n97\nReceiving during 2002 came after the decision in Dodge and the change in strip search policy. This suggests that\nsomething other than the jail's ability to strip search all newly arrived inmates must be at work here.\nThe evidence reveals what that something is: In August and September 2002, there was a 500% to 600%\nincrease in the number of shakedowns that were conducted within a couple of weeks after the preliminary\ninjunction was issued. [Tr. 112, 352]. A shakedown is a thorough search of a particular housing unit or an\nindividual cell. [Tr. 111]. A shakedown of a cell consists of looking in every area in which an inmate could hide\ncontraband00under the mattress; in mattress seams; in the toilet bowl; in books, clothing, foot locker, or\n97\nwindowsills; under paper on the walls; \"virtually every spot.\" [Tr. 112]. One of the purposes of a shakedown is to\nfind contraband. [Tr. 112].\nThe record reveals that the dramatically increased shakedowns after July 26, 2002 achieved its purpose.\nRelatively speaking, large amounts of contraband were recovered during shakedowns in the last five months of\n2002, almost all of it from dorms and cells. [PX 11(D), 12(D)].\nHowever, there is also nothing in the record to correlate the contraband found with contraband that was\nsmuggled into the facility by new arrivals who were arrested for minor crimes and civil violations. Indeed, the\nCourt's own recount of officer reports filed after July 26, 200200 the date of the Dodge injunction00reveals that well\n97 97\nover half of the items of reported contraband recovered during that period (167 of 284) were so-called \"excess\nissue.\" Excess issue items are items that are issued to inmates in fixed quantities by the institution itself00towels,\n97\nclothing, cups, toiletries, and the like. If an inmate has more of such items than he or she should, the excess is\ncontraband. Such items could not possibly have been smuggled into the jail by newly-arraigned inmates and\nwould never have been recovered during an on-arrival strip search.\nThe remaining 117 items of contraband recovered included 34 instances of drugs, alcohol, or medicine; 31\nweapons; and 17 cigarettes/tobacco. From the information I have been given, there is no way to know whether\nany of those items were smuggled in upon entry by new arrivals to the facility. More than half of the weapons\nfound were makeshift weapons devised with materials found within OCCF. 9 of the weapons, for example, were\nsharpened pens, toothbrushes, toilet brushes, hairbrushes, or spoons; 3 were pens with sharpened wire, nails, or\n69 pins attached to them; one was a bent can lid; 7 were \"metal objects,\" *69 either unadulterated or somehow\nweaponized (by, for example, being sharpened or serrated); 4 were heavy gauge wires; and one was socks\n\"rolled up into a hard ball underneath the inmates bad, which constitutes possession of an item that could be\nused as a weapon.\"\nCapt. Ryan speculates that this wave of new contraband resulted from publicity about the Dodge injunction.\nHowever, there is nothing new about smuggling contraband into OCCF. Corrections Officer Cynthia Anne Fee\ntestified, credibly, that \"[t]he inmates at the OCCF regularly attempt to smuggle contraband into the facility despite\nthe knowledge that they will be subjected to a visual body search at the conclusion of a contact visit.\" [Tr. 374].\nMoreover, if post-July 26, 2002 newspaper publicity did encourage newly admitted detainees to take advantage\nof the preliminary injunction by trying to smuggle contraband into OCCF on arrival, then the data should show a\ncorrelation between the increase in contraband and the number of contraband items that were discovered during\nstrip searches of newly-arrived inmates (many of whom were still strip searched). But there is no such correlation.\nIndeed, the contraband reports in evidence reveal that, in the 50 months following January 1, 1999, contraband\nwas recovered from the body cavities or undergarments of only 5 detainees during admission strip searches or\n\"hygiene checks\":\n\na. Inmate Raymond Cintron was admitted to OCCF on June 15, 2000 following his arrest for\nmurder in the second degree. During the course of a \"hygiene check\" a plastic bag containing\ncocaine was recovered from his buttocks.\nb. Inmate Lee Rivera was admitted to OCCF on December 27, 2000 following his arrest for\naggravated unlicensed operation in the third degree and operating a motor vehicle left of the\npavement. While conducting a \"routine search,\" two packets of heroin fell to the ground while he\nwas removing his underwear.\nc. Inmate Edqin Guerrier was admitted to OCCF on July 7, 2001 following his arrest for driving\nwhile under the influence of drugs. While being searched in the Booking and Receiving area, he\nwas ordered to spread his buttocks, bend over, and cough. A plastic bag containing marijuana was\ndiscovered protruding from his rectum.\nd. Inmate Rasun King was admitted on November 20, 2002 following his arrest on a warrant for\ncriminal sale of a controlled substance. While under an \"admission search,\" a plastic bag\ncontaining cocaine fell from his boxer shorts.\ne. Inmate Anthony Wright was admitted to OCCF on December 14, 2002 following his arrest for\nfalse impersonation. At the time of his admission to the facility, the booking and receiving officer\nnoted that Mr. Wright appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol and requested\nauthorization to conduct a strip search. While Mr. Wright was exposing his buttocks for the officer's\nvisual inspection, two bags of marijuana fell to the floor.\nOf the approximately 23,000 inmates admitted to OCCF from January 1, 1999 through February 28, 2003, the\nCounty encountered three incidents of drugs recovered from an inmate's anal cavity and two incidents of drugs\nfalling from an inmate's underwear during the course of a strip search. Only two of those five incidents occurred\nafter the Dodge injunction and the resulting change in strip search policy. One of those two incidents involved an\narrest for a narcotics crime and the other involved an arrestee who appeared to be under the influence of drugs.\n70 Under the \"nature of crime charge\" and \"particular circumstances of the arrestee\" *70 tests, it is possible that\nneither search would violate the Constitution. See infra p. 84. Indeed, it appears that there may have been\nreasonable suspicion to strip search four of these five detainees, based upon either the nature of the offense or\nthe characteristics of the detainee.\nSo if the County had been in compliance with the Second Circuit's reasonable suspicion standard since 1999, it\nwould arguably have missed00as a result of its compliance 00only one item of contraband in the course of\n97 97\nadmitting 23,000 detainees. This nominal statistic is consistent with the experience of plaintiffs' expert, Robert\nDeRosa, who testified that, while drugs are found on a regular basis during the strip searches of inmates\nreturning from contact visits and in packages sent to prisoners, they are rarely, if ever, found during the new\nadmission strip and body cavity search. [PX 40; Tr. 181].\nDuring this same four year period, there was not one incident where a weapon was recovered from a newly\nadmitted detainee's vaginal/anal cavity or undergarments. Defendants make much of razor blades recovered\nfrom an arriving inmate, Julio Morant, who was charged with a civil violation (a Family Court offense under Article\n10). [Tr. 282-83]. An officer found a blade in the lining of Mr. Morant's sneaker while conducting a \"general\nadmissions search.\" [DX 1B]. Mr. Morant was then strip searched and three more blades were found in the left\nsleeve pocket of his jacket.\nDefendants' reliance on this incident is misguided for two reasons. First, the strip search of Mr. Morant was lawful\nbecause reasonable suspicion existed00an officer found a razor blade in Mr. Morant's shoe before conducting a\n97\nfull strip search. Moreover, Mr. Morant had been disciplined for assaultive behavior during previous incarcerations\n[30]\nat OCCF and also written up for various types of contraband. Id. Second, a strip search of Mr. Morant would\nnot have turned up any additional contraband than a less invasive search would have uncovered00no contraband\n97\nwas found upon searching Mr. Morant's private parts. All were concealed in his outer clothing00his shoes and coat\n97\nsleeve.\n\nThere is simply no evidence in this record from which I could conclude that newly arrived inmates were the\nsource of the massive amounts of contraband recovered during the increased shakedowns that followed Dodge.\nIn Shain, Judge Pooler suggested that newly-arrived inmates would be less likely than post-contact visit inmates\nto secret contraband, since they would have had no advance notice that they were going to end up at OCCF. \nShain, 273 F.3d at 64. From the statistics cited above, it would seem that her surmise was correct.\n6. Strip Searches other than On-Arrival Strip Searches\nBooking and Receiving is only the first time when an inmate at OCCF might be strip searched. OCCF policy\nprovides for strip searches under the following circumstances: (1) during a cell shakedown; (2) during a housing\nunit shakedown; (3) when an inmate is involved in an assault; (4) prior to an inmate's placement in disciplinary\nlockdown; (5) prior to an inmate's placement in the general population from the lockdown unit; (6) prior to an\n[31]\ninmate's placement in a suicide prevention cell; (7) after an inmate's return from outside work detail;  and (8)\n[32]\nafter contact visits.  [DX 30].\n71 *71 In addition, inmates are strip searched when officers have reason to believe that they may be secreting\ncontraband. [DX 30, at 5.31(N); DX 29, at 4.4]. In Murcia v. County of Orange, 226 F.Supp.2d 489\n(S.D.N.Y.2002), for example, a case also on my docket, OCCF officers strip searched plaintiff when they smelled\ncigarette smoke in the pen in which Murcia and others were housed. Because cigarettes are contraband,\neveryone in the area was strip searched when no one admitted to having the goods.\nThe legality of these types of strip searches is not contested in this proceeding and was not addressed in Dodge.\nSo if, in reliance on the Dodge preliminary injunction, individuals increasingly tried to smuggle contraband into the\nfacility after court visits, work details, or contact visits, their reliance was misplaced, since inmates could be strip\nsearched following these activities without running afoul of Shain.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin defendants from implementing their strip search policy insofar as it violates the\nConstitution. Defendants want no injunction, either because (1) their policies are not unconstitutional; or (2)\nplaintiffs have not demonstrated that injunctive relief is appropriate, particularly in light of the PLRA. In urging me\nnot to award plaintiffs an injunction, defendants seek the discretion to strip search all newly arrived inmates.\nPermanent injunctive relief is appropriate when a plaintiff (1) shows that an inadequate remedy is available at\nlaw, such as by showing that irreparable harm would result if an injunction were not granted, and (2) succeeds on\nthe merits of his claim. See Weizmann Institute of Science v. Neschis, 229 F.Supp.2d 234, 258 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).\nThus, the standard for a permanent injunction is essentially the same as for a preliminary injunction, except that\nthe plaintiff must actually succeed on the merits. See Amoco Production Co. v. Village of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531,\n546 n. 12, 107 S.Ct. 1396, 94 L.Ed.2d 542 (1987); Sierra Club v. Hennessy, 695 F.2d 643, 647 (2d Cir.1982); \nNeschis, 229 F.Supp.2d at 258.\nIn addition, where, as here, \"`public consequences' are implicated, it is incumbent upon a district court in\nexercising its discretion to `balance [] the conveniences of the parties and possible injuries to them according as\nthey may be affected by the granting or withholding of the injunction.'\" Sierra Club v. Hennessy, 695 F.2d 643,\n649 (2d Cir.1982) (quoting Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 311, 102 S.Ct. 1798, 72 L.Ed.2d 91\n(1982)). Congress codified this weighing of the hardships in the PLRA, which directs courts to give substantial\nweight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of the criminal justice system caused by the\nprospective injunctive relief. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2); see Smith v. Arkansas Dep't of Correction, 103 F.3d 637,\n646-47 (8th Cir.1996) (finding that the PLRA \"codifies existing law and does not change the standards for\n72 determining whether to grant an injunction\"); Gomez*72v. Vernon, 255 F.3d 1118, 1129 (9th Cir. 2001) (agreeing\nwith Smith).\n\nEven if plaintiffs meet their burden of proof on these issues, the PLRA limits the type and scope of prospective\ninjunctive relief that the Court may award plaintiffs. 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2) states that no injunction shall issue\nunless the court finds that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than is necessary to correct the\nconstitutional harm found, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. In a similar vein, the\nPLRA requires a court to apply principles of comity in fashioning relief that requires or permits a government\nofficial to exceed his or her authority under state or local law. See also Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 378, 96\nS.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976) (\"Where, as here, the exercise of authority by state officials is attacked, federal\ncourts must be constantly mindful of the `special delicacy of the adjustment to be preserved between federal\nequitable power and State administration of its own law.'\") (quoting Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U.S. 117, 120, 72\nS.Ct. 118, 96 L.Ed. 138 (1951)).\nI. Irreparable Harm\nPlaintiffs allege that defendants maintain a policy of strip searching detainees arriving at OCCF that violates their\nFourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The alleged violation of a\nconstitutional right suffices to show irreparable harm. See Brewer v. West Irondequoit Cent. Sch. Dist., 212 F.3d\n738, 744-45 (2d Cir.2000); Jolly v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 468, 482 (2d Cir.1996) (\"[T]he alleged violation of a\nconstitutional right [] triggers a finding of irreparable harm.\"); Covino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d 73, 77 (2d Cir.1992); \nMitchell v. Cuomo, 748 F.2d 804, 806 (2d Cir.1984) (\"When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is\ninvolved, most courts hold that no further showing of irreparable harm is necessary.\").\nII. The Merits of Plaintiffs' Claim\nAs I described more fully in the findings of fact, I find that the policy OCCF officers have followed to determine\nwhether to strip search a newly-admitted pretrial detainee has gone through three iterations: (1) a pre-August\n2001 policy of strip searching every detainee admitted to the facility, which I have called a \"blanket strip search\"\npolicy; (2) the policy from August 2001 until August 2002, pursuant to which newly-admitted detainees were\nautomatically strip searched if any one of a set of listed factors existed; and (3) the policy from August 2002 until\nthe present, where OCCF officers follow the written policy promulgated in response to the Dodge preliminary\ninjunction. [DX 30].\nDefendants argue that OCCF's pre-August 2001 blanket strip search policy00to which defendants openly profess\n97\nthey wish to revert00is constitutional. I disagree with defendants. Shain is controlling law in this Circuit, and the\n97\npre-August 2001 Policy to which defendants wish to revert clearly violates Shain. I also conclude that the two\npolicies followed since August 2001 are also unconstitutional, but to a much more limited degree.\nA. Second Circuit Jurisprudence on Strip Searches of Pre-Trial\nDetainees\nSecond Circuit decisions on the constitutionality of strip searches of pre-trial detainees have followed a course\nthat, to this reader, demonstrates considerable hostility to the practice of strip searching pre-trial detainees.\nThe journey starts with Wolfish v. Levi, 573 F.2d 118 (2d Cir.1978),rev'd sub nom Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520,\n73 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In that case, plaintiff *73 Louis Wolfish represented a class of all persons\nconfined at the recently-constructed Metropolitan Correctional Facility (MCC), a federal institution located in\ndowntown Manhattan that housed pre-trial detainees (unconvicted individuals awaiting trial who could not post\nbail), sentenced prisoners awaiting assignment to another prison facility or who had been designated to serve\ntheir term at the MCC, sentenced prisoners transferred to the MCC on writs to testify or stand trial, witnesses in\nprotective custody, and persons incarcerated for contempt of court. The plaintiffs' suit challenged a \"litany of woes\n[that] touched on almost all aspects of the institution's conditions and practices,\" id. at 123, including the\nconstitutionality of routinely strip searching inmates after receiving visitors. Id. at 131. Judge Frankel issued an\n\ninjunction, inter alia, prohibiting \"inspection of the genitals and anus unless there is probable cause to believe that\nthe inmate is concealing contraband.\" Id.\nOn appeal, the Second Circuit recognized that an incarcerated individual \"relinquishes some part of those rights\nto privacy and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures possessed by unincarcerated members of\nsociety,\" but found that \"the existence of a realm in which privacy is safeguarded is fundamental to decent\ntreatment of an inmate.\" Id. Thus, the court upheld Judge Frankel's order based on its determination that \"[t]he\ngross violation of personal privacy inherent in such a search cannot be outweighed by the government's security\ninterest in maintaining a practice of so little actual utility.\" Id.\nThe United States Supreme Court apparently shared the Court of Appeals' repugnance for strip searching00the\n97\nCourt stated that the practice \"instinctively gives us the most pause\"00but reversed the Second Circuit's ruling. \n97\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 558-60, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The Supreme Court assumed that upon their commitment to a\ncorrections facility convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees retain some Fourth Amendment rights to be free\nfrom unreasonable searches. It explained:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (citations omitted). The Court balanced \"the significant and legitimate security interests\nof the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates,\" and concluded that the MCC could conduct the\nchallenged strip searches00strip searching inmates after contact visits00\"on less than probable cause.\" Id. at 560,\n97 97\n99 S.Ct. 1861.\nEight years later, in Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986), the Second Circuit visited the issue of strip\nsearches in a different context. The plaintiff in Weber was a misdemeanor arrestee who was strip searched upon\nher arrival at the Monroe County Correctional Facility, pursuant to a policy \"calling for strip/body cavity searches\nof all arrested persons other than those placed in `holding cells,' which are the cells in which arrestees are\nsometimes placed when their release on bail is imminent.\" Id. at 799. After her release, she sued for damages\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Court of Appeals ruled that \"the Fourth Amendment precludes prison officials\nfrom performing strip/body cavity searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanors or other minor offenses\n74 unless the officials have a reasonable suspicion *74 that the arrestee is concealing weapons or other contraband\nbased on the crime charged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\"\nId. at 802. The Second Circuit also rejected the defendants' argument that qualified immunity shielded them from\nliability to plaintiff because (1) all the circuits that had addressed similar policies had found them to be\nunconstitutional, and (2) the Court had long stressed the intrusive nature of body cavity searches. Id. at 803.\nMoreover, the court ruled that Monroe County's policy would be unconstitutional even if it only called for\nconducting body cavity searches on a newly arrested person who could not immediately make bail, and who was\ntherefore moved from a holding cell to a cell near arraigned inmates. The court concluded that such a practice\n\"would still not provide that `particularized suspicion,' arising either from the nature of the charges and/or the\narrest, which the law requires for so intrusive and demeaning a procedure as a strip/body cavity search.\" Id. at\n802.\nIn rendering its decision, the Court of Appeals expressly found that Bell v. Wolfish did not \"suggest, much less\nrequire,\" the district court's conclusion that Monroe County's policy was not unconstitutional. Id. at 801. Bell v.\nWolfish did not \"read out of the Constitution the provision of general application that a search be justified as\nreasonable under the circumstances,\" the court explained, and \"[t]he imposition of a standard short of probable\ncause in determining the balance of interests at stake in Wolfish in no way dispensed with that requirement.\" Id.\nat 800. The Court of Appeals cited three factors that bore on the reasonableness of the strip search in Bell v.\nWolfish: plaintiffs had already been arraigned, they had failed to make bail (and so were part of the general\ninmate population); and they \"had presumably chosen to receive visitors and to enjoy physical contact with\n\nthem.\" Id. None of those factors was true of Weber, who was searched before she was ever admitted to the\nfacility.\nTwo years later, the Circuit reaffirmed Weber in Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66 (2d Cir.1988). There, plaintiff Walsh\nwas arrested pursuant to a bench warrant after not appearing at a hearing00albeit because the notice of hearing\n97\nwas sent to the wrong address00regarding his failure to pay parking tickets in Burlington, Vermont. Walsh was\n97\nbrought to the Chittenden County Correctional Center and processed in accordance with the jail's \"standard\nintake process,\" which included a strip search and visual body cavity search. \"There have been no doctrinal\ndevelopments altering the principles noted in Weber,\" the court explained, finding the \"blanket policy calling for\nstrip searches of all misdemeanor arrestees\" to be unconstitutional. Id. at 69.\nDespite the Walsh Court's pronouncement that there had been \"no doctrinal developments\" since Weber, the\nUnited States Supreme Court had issued a decision during the two years between Weber and Walsh that at least\none judge in this Circuit believes \"altered the principles\" noted in Weber. See Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 70\n(2d. Cir.2001) (citing Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)) (Cabranes, J.,\ndissenting). In Turner v. Safley, the Supreme Court articulated strict standards for determining the validity of a\nprison regulation claimed to impinge on an inmate's constitutional rights. The Court ruled that the relevant\nquestion was whether the regulation is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, and that this\nquestion applied in all cases in which a prisoner asserted that a prison regulation violated the Constitution. See \n75 Washington*75v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 223, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990) (citing Turner). The Turner\nCourt listed four factors for a court to consider in answering that question: whether there is a \"valid, rational\nconnection\" between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it;\nwhether there are alternative means of exercising the constitutional right in question that remain open to prison\ninmates; whether accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have an impact upon guards and other\ninmates and upon the allocation of prison resources generally; and whether there are reasonable alternatives\navailable to the prison authorities. 482 U.S. at 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254.\nBoth Weber and Walsh were commenced by persons who were strip searched after arrest but prior to their\narraignment. In 1994, the Weber/Walsh rule was extended (albeit sub silentio) to a misdemeanor arrestee who\nwas strip searched after his arraignment. See Wachtler v. County of Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77 (2d Cir.1994). The\nplaintiff in Wachtler was one of this State's more celebrated misdemeanor arrestees00 the then-Chief Judge of the\n97\nNew York Court of Appeals, who was arrested after an officer pulled him over for speeding and he refused to\neither answer any of the officer's questions without the presence of an attorney or produce a driver's license. The\nofficer took Wachtler before the nearest available judge, who set bail at $250 after Wachtler continued to refuse\nto identify himself. Though Wachtler had almost $1,000 in his possession, he refused to post bail and claimed\nindigency. He was then brought to the Herkimer County Jail, where he was strip searched and placed in solitary\nconfinement until a friend arrived to post bail approximately fourteen hours later.\nThe Court of Appeals did not reach the issue of whether the strip search of Wachtler was in fact unconstitutional,\nexplaining that such a determination would require a record detailing all the circumstances surrounding the strip\nsearch. However, recognizing the subtle but important distinction between its facts in Wachtler and those of \nWeber and Walsh, the Circuit granted qualified immunity to the individual officers involved in the strip search on\nthe ground that it could not find that the officers violated a clearly established right in strip-searching Wachtler\ngiven (1) the circumstances of the arrest00such as Wachtler's failure to identify himself at the scene of the arrest\n97\nor in court, and his possession of $1,000 in cash; and (2) the lack of legal authority \"that addresses the\nreasonable suspicion issue in circumstances even remotely similar to those in the instance case.\" Id. at 81-82.\nThe court nonetheless declined to dismiss Wachtler's claim against Herkimer County, because \"[i]f the standard\nprocedure included routine strip-searches of misdemeanor arrestees, absent reasonable suspicion of weapons or\ncontraband, and if no reasonable suspicion concerning Wachtler's possession of such items existed, then\nWachtler would prevail.\" Id. at 82.\nThe Weber/Walsh/Wachtler trilogy was interrupted by a case in which the Court of Appeals reached a different\nconclusion, but on facts that varied from those of Weber and Walsh in three important respects. In Covino v.\nPatrissi, 967 F.2d 73 (2d Cir.1992), the plaintiff was not challenging a search of his person on arrival following his\narrest for a minor offense. Having been arrested and detained pre-trial on a charge of kidnapping, Covino was\n\n76 incarcerated in Vermont's Northwest State Correctional Facility.[33] While a member of *76 the general\npopulation, Covino was twice randomly selected for a visual body cavity search during random cell searches at\nthe institution, and was then punished for refusing to consent to the searches. (Interestingly, Covino00whose\n97\ncircumstances might well have suggested that he represented a risk of carriage of contraband00 was not forced to\n97\nundergo the searches to which he objected, although he was disciplined for refusing). Covino brought an action\nseeking both Section 1983 damages and an injunction against the defendants' policy of conducting body cavity\nsearches of pre-trial detainees. His motion for a preliminary injunction was denied by then-District Judge Fred I.\nParker. Judge Parker's decision was affirmed on appeal, in a decision that never mentioned Weber or Walsh but\nrelied exclusively on an analysis of the four Turner factors. One could fairly assume that the decision in Covino\nlimited the reach of Weber and Walsh to what I will call \"on arrival\" searches00that is, searches conducted as part\n97\nof the in-processing of a newly arrived defendant at the facility, whether pre- or post-arraignment.\nFinally, the Second Circuit reaffirmed its adherence to Weber/Walsh/Wachtler00 at least where misdemeanor\n97\narrestees are concerned00in Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56 (2d. Cir.2001). Shain was basically Wachtler redux,\n97\n[34]\nexcept that it involved a much larger incarcerative facility.  The plaintiff was a post-arraignment misdemeanor\narrestee who was searched on his initial arrival at the Nassau County Correctional Facility (NCCF), and who\nsubsequently brought an action for damages and injunctive relief under Section 1983. The Second Circuit took \nShain as an opportunity to restate that the law in this Circuit relating to strip searches of post-arraignment\nmisdemeanor arrestees arriving at a New York county correctional facility was settled. Of particular significance\nfor the case at bar, the majority in Shain rejected the argument that Turner had impliedly overturned Weber,\nstating that the Supreme Court's 1987 decision was limited to regulations at prisons. It distinguished Turner and \nCovino from Weber/Walsh/Wachtler on the ground that the two lines of cases involved different types of\ninstitutions00the former cases all involved a \"state correctional facility or prison\" (\"a state or federal facility of\n97\nconfinement for convicted criminals, esp[ecially] felons\"), while the latter cases each involved a \"local correctional\n[35]\nfacility or jail\" (a \"place where persons awaiting trial or those convicted of misdemeanors are confined\").  The\ncourt also noted that, in New York, misdemeanor arrestees are required to be admitted to bail, which minimized\nthe penological significance of arraignment.\nJudge Katzmann concurred in the result in Shain, but only because he felt that the felony/misdemeanor and jail/\n77 prison distinctions *77 reflected in Second Circuit jurisprudence bound him. He specifically noted that he was not\nsure if he would make either distinction were the issue before him for the first time. Judge Cabranes wrote a\nforceful dissent, in which he took the view that Turner had indeed impliedly overruled Weber and insisted that the\nmajority's distinction between prisons and jails made no difference. Nassau County's request for certiorari was\ndenied by the United States Supreme Court, Nassau County v. Shain, 537 U.S. 1083, 123 S.Ct., 672, 154\nL.Ed.2d 582 (2002), leaving the district courts in this Circuit in the difficult position of having to determine the\nouter boundaries between Weber/Walsh/Wachtler/Shain and Turner/Covino 00that is, where one line of precedent\n97\nceases to control and the other begins.\nB. Background to this Particular Motion\nThis Court's docket contains, or at one time contained, at least six cases challenging strip searches by law\nenforcement personnel. Since the decisions in those actions led to the filing of the current lawsuit, it is necessary\nto review what those cases are about00and what they are not about.\n97\nThe first case was Lee v. Perez, 175 F.Supp.2d 673 (S.D.N.Y.2001). Plaintiff Lee was arrested for several\nmisdemeanors. He was arraigned in the City of Newburgh City Court and released on $250 bail. A sum greater\nthan $250 had been on his person when he was arrested and Lee should have been able to pay his bond and\nleave. However, a regulation in force at the time required him to post bail at OCCF. He was, therefore,\ntransported to OCCF by Newburgh police officers for the sole purpose of posting his bond. Upon arrival, he was\nstrip searched. He was never admitted to the general population, and he was released as soon as he posted his\nbail. The undisputed evidence at trial demonstrated that the corrections officer who conducted the search had no\nbasis to assume that Lee was carrying contraband. Under Shain, the strip search was illegal. This Court\n\noverturned a jury verdict in favor of the County, and I subsequently granted plaintiff's motion for summary\n[36]\njudgment.\nIn Maneely v. City of Newburgh, plaintiff Maneely represents a class of all pre-arraignment detainees who were\nstrip searched at the City of Newburgh Police Department between March 27, 1998 and August 24, 2000. See \nManeely v. City of Newburgh, 256 F.Supp.2d 204 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); Maneely v. City of Newburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69\n(S.D.N.Y.2002). I recently denied plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the City\nof Newburgh maintained an unconstitutional policy of strip searching all pre-arraignment inmates with or without\nhaving reasonable suspicion to believe that those persons were carrying or concealing weapons or contraband.\nDodge was the next case in which a decision was handed down. That decision is described above. See supra pp.\n50-51.\nLee, Maneely, and Dodge all dealt with persons who were accused only of misdemeanors, and who were strip\nsearched upon arrival at an institution that the Shain majority recognized as a \"local correctional facility or\njail\"00either a local lock-up (Maneely) or a county jail (Lee, Dodge). Thus, they all fell squarely within the\n97\nparameters of controlling Second Circuit law.\n78 *78 Subsequent cases went beyond Shain's factual parameters.\nIn Murcia v. County of Orange, 226 F.Supp.2d 489 (S.D.N.Y.2002), the plaintiff in Murcia did not arrive at the\ncounty jail accused of a misdemeanor. He was arrested on a federal warrant for bail jumping, which is a felony.\n[37]\n He, too, was strip searched on arrival at OCCF. He was subsequently strip searched two other times during\nhis brief stay in the general population at that facility. He challenged all three OCCF strip searches as\nconstitutionally infirm.\nAnalyzing the on-arrival search, this Court recognized that Shain did not address the precise fact pattern Murcia\npresented. Indeed, I noted that the Shain majority had stated in passing that \"a New York felony defendant's post-\narraignment detention may well be an indicator of an increased security risk.\" 273 F.3d at 65 (emphasis added).\nBut I concluded that the Second Circuit was likely to apply the same standard00no strip searches on arrival at a\n97\ncounty jail in the absence of reasonable suspicion to believe the defendant is carrying contraband00to felony\n97\narrestees. 226 F.Supp.2d at 494-95. I recognized that the mix of factors giving rise to reasonable suspicion might\nweigh differently in felony cases, but concluded that a felony arrest alone, without more, was insufficient to give\n[38]\nrise to the requisite reasonable suspicion.  In reaching my decision, I declined the County's suggestion that I\n[39]\nignore Shain in favor of their interpretation of Turner v. Safley.\nI did not apply the same analysis to a strip search of Mr. Murcia that occurred after he had been admitted to the\ngeneral population. The search was conducted when corrections officers smelled cigarette smoke in the pen in\nwhich Murcia and others were housed. Cigarettes are contraband, and everyone in the area was strip searched\nwhen no one admitted to having the goods. I denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on this claim,\nbecause he sought judgment against a policy maker pursuant to Monell v. Dep't of Social Services of City of New\nYork, 436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) but failed to establish that the strip search\noccurred pursuant to an unconstitutional policy. I drew a distinction between on-arrival searches and searches of\nindividuals who had been admitted to the general population. I concluded that plaintiff had erroneously conflated\nthe two. 226 F.Supp.2d at 500. That distinction is suggested by the different results reached in Covino (where the\nproposed searches would have occurred well after the inmate's arrival and incorporation into the population) and \nWeber/Walsh/Wachtler (all of which dealt with newly-arrived detainees). It is also expressly countenanced in \n[40]\nShain.\n79 The fifth case, Sarnicola v. County of Westchester, 229 F.Supp.2d 259 (S.D.N.Y. *79 2002), involved not just a\ndifferent county (Westchester as opposed to Orange) but a different type of facility (the local State Police\nBarracks as opposed to a county jail). Nicole Sarnicola was arrested on suspicion of having committed a felony\n(criminal sale of a controlled substance) after driving a drug supplier to a deal site. She was taken to the\nbarracks, strip searched, and then questioned. Sarnicola was never charged with a crime, let alone arraigned,\nand was released within hours of her arrest. At deposition, the officer who authorized the strip search admitted\n\nthat he had no reason to believe that Sarnicola was secreting contraband on her person, despite having arrested\nher for possible participation in a drug crime. Id. at 271-72. Moreover, the decision to strip search her violated\ncounty policy that all strip searches following arrests be justified by reasonable suspicion of carriage of\ncontraband 00no distinction being made in the policy statement between felony arrests and misdemeanor arrests,\n97\nor narcotics arrests and other arrests. I concluded that the strip search of Sarnicola, in a location where there was\nno conceivable penological interest (because she was in the equivalent of a police station), and in circumstances\nwhere the searching officer said he had no reason to believe that she was secreting contraband, was\n[41]\nunconstitutional 00even though she was taken into custody on suspicion of participating in a narcotics felony.\n97\nIn light of Murcia and Sarnicola, it came as no surprise when a group of plaintiffs, purporting to represent all\nfelony pre-trial detainees strip searched at OCCF absent reasonable suspicion, filed suit under the caption Rango\nv. County of Orange, 02 Civ 8451 (S.D.N.Y.2002). The Rango plaintiffs sought to recover damages as a result of\nwhat they believe were constitutionally infirm strip searches, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions on\nthe order of the preliminary injunction that had been entered in Dodge.\nIt is the consolidated trial of the Dodge and Rango plaintiffs' application for a permanent injunction that forms the\nbasis of this decision.\nC. Shain Controls the Disposition of This Case\nDefendants argue that I should decline to find Shain dispositive of plaintiffs' claims. They do not attempt to\ndistinguish Shain on its facts. See, e.g., DiRienzo v. Philip Serv. Corp., 294 F.3d 21, 32 (2d Cir.2002),cert.\ndenied,537 U.S. 1028, 123 S.Ct. 556, 154 L.Ed.2d 442 (2002) (distinguishing cases because facts differed).\nIndeed, it is undisputed that this case and Shain involve precisely the same type of facility (a county jail) and\nprecisely the same type of search (visual body cavity searches of newly-admitted post-arraignment pre-trial\ndetainees). The only distinction, which I address below, is that Shain's holding is limited to misdemeanor\narrestees and does not, by its express terms, apply to felony arrestees.\nDefendants couch their argument in terms of stare decisis, arguing that the doctrine of stare decisis is \"flexible\"\nand thus \"this Court need not be constrained by principles of stare decisis to follow that decision.\" [Defendants'\nPost-Trial Memorandum of Law 15]. Defendants fail to distinguish, however, between horizontal stare decisis\n(whereby a court binds itself) and vertical stare decisis (whereby a higher court's decision binds lower courts). \n80 See, e.g., Richard W. Murphy, Separation of Powers and the Horizontal Force of*80Precedent, 78 Notre Dame\nL.Rev. 1075, 1085-86 (2003); Charles J. Cooper, Stare Decisis: Precedent and Principle in Constitutional\nAdjudication, 73 Cornell L.Rev. 401, 410 n. 6 (1988). It is horizontal stare decisis that is flexible00i.e., it is not an\n97\n\"inexorable command\" or \"a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.\" Lawrence v. Texas, ___\nU.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 2483, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (internal citations omitted). In contrast, vertical stare\ndecisis provides little, if any, leeway for a district court judge to stray from Court of Appeals precedent.\nOne commentator has developed a three-part typology of how a lower court might refuse to follow a higher\ncourt's precedent: (1) a lower court might ignore a higher court's opinion because of the lower court's view that\nthe precedent was mistaken; (2) a lower court could conclude that the higher court's precedent has been\nundermined by later decisions to the point that it has been implicitly overruled by the higher court itself (or a court\nsuperior to the higher court), and is therefore no longer binding; and (3) a lower court might engage in predictive\nreasoning and refuse to follow a precedent the court believes the higher court would not still follow. Ashutosh\nBhagwat, Separate But Equal? The Supreme Court, the Lower Federal Courts, and the Nature of \"Judicial\nPower\", 80 Boston Univ. L.Rev. 967, 971-72 (2000). Though courts and commentators have largely rejected all\nthree of these as justifications for a lower court to not follow a superior court's precedent, defendants urge me not\nto follow Shain on all three bases.\n\n1. Allegedly Erroneous Factual and Legal Assumptions Do Not\nProvide a Basis to Reject Shain\nDefendants argue that I should reject Shain because the court there based its ruling on erroneous legal and\nfactual assumptions, in particular assumptions about (a) the differences between jails and prisons, (b) the\nsecurity risks misdemeanants pose to a correctional facility, and (c) the information that facilities have (and are\nable to obtain) about new inmates. In addition, defendants argue that there is no basis in the Constitution to\nimport a reasonable suspicion standard into the context of pretrial detainees. Put bluntly, defendants argue that\nthe Second Circuit made mistakes in Shain and I should therefore ignore that decision.\nA lower court must follow precedent that is on point, however, even if it thinks the precedential decision was\nwrongly decided. See, e.g., Jaffree v. Bd. of Sch. Comm'rs of Mobile County, 459 U.S. 1314, 1316, 103 S.Ct.\n842, 74 L.Ed.2d 924 (1983) (Powell, Circuit Justice). In Khan v. State Oil Co., 93 F.3d 1358 (7th Cir.1996), for\nexample, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court's holding, basing its decision on the\nSupreme Court's decision in Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 869, 19 L.Ed.2d 998 (1968). Chief\nJudge Richard Posner wrote for the majority and argued that the rule of antitrust law set forth in Albrecht was\nwrong as a matter of economic theory. 93 F.3d at 1361-62. The court of appeals felt itself compelled to follow \nAlbrecht, however, because \"Albrecht has not been expressly overruled (or, what would amount to the same\nthing, a later case, conceded to be indistinguishable, has not been expressly overruled).\" 93 F.3d at 1363. On\nappeal, the Supreme Court reversed the Seventh Circuit, accepting Judge Posner's criticism of Albrecht. The\nCourt stated, however, stated that \"[t]he Court of Appeals was correct in applying that principle despite\ndisagreement with Albrecht, for it is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.\" State Oil Co.\n81 v. Khan, 522 *81 U.S. 3, 20, 118 S.Ct. 275, 139 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997).\nThus if defendants are correct that the Shain Court based its ruling on erroneous assumptions, it is the Second\nCircuit that must rectify its own mistake. Absent that, the Supreme Court, which (regrettably) denied certiorari in \nShain, must speak to the issue.\n2. Overton Has Not Implicitly Overruled Shain\nTaking a different tack, defendants argue that Shain is not dispositive here because the Supreme Court implicitly\noverruled Shain in Overton v. Bazzetta, ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 2162, 156 L.Ed.2d 162 (2003). Again,\ndefendants are wrong.\nPlaintiffs in Overton were a class of prisoners (and their friends and family members) challenging Michigan's rules\nrestricting inmates' visitation rights. The Supreme Court applied the Turner factors and upheld the prison\nregulations, overruling the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nDefendants fail to explain how Overton affects Shain. To the extent that Overton reinforced the Supreme Court's\nruling in Turner v. Safley concerning judicial deference to prison regulations, that is precisely the issue on which\nthe Shain majority and the dissent differed. I, of course, must follow the majority.\nMoreover, Shain distinguished Turner by hewing to a carefully crafted set of what it perceived as critical factual\ndistinctions between the two cases. Overton did not involve a facility of the type the Shain Court termed a \"jail\"\n[42]\n; it did not involve rules specifically regarding pretrial detainees; and it most certainly did not involve strip\nsearches or plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights. Rather, the Supreme Court applied Turner to visitation rules\naffecting already-admitted inmates at a facility that fell within the parameters of what Shain defined as a prison.\nOverton no more provides me with a basis to ignore Shain than Turner provided the Shain majority with a reason\nto overrule the Weber/Walsh/Wachtler trilogy.\n\n3. I Can Not Anticipate Whether the Second Circuit Will \"Abandon\"\nShain\nFinally, defendants invite me to divine whether the Second Circuit will \"abandon\" its decision in Shain. They cite\nJudge Learned Hand's admonition that \"the measure of [a lower court's] duty is to divine, as best it can, what\nwould be in the event of an appeal . . . .\" Spector Motor Serv. v. Walsh, 139 F.2d 809, 823 (2d Cir.1943) (Hand,\nJ., dissenting).\nIn Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Exp., Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989),\nhowever, the Supreme Court explained that \"[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet\nappears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case\nwhich directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\" Id. at 484, 109 S.Ct.\n1917. I see no reason why a district court should not show the same deference to the Court of Appeals that the\nSupreme Court demands of intermediate appellate courts. See, e.g., Wisdom v. Intrepid Sea-Air Museum, 1992\n82 WL 168224, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 26, 1992) (\"[Rodriguez's] admonition to the circuit courts should apply with *82\nequal, if not greater, force to the district courts.\"); Priester v. Senkowski,\n2002 WL 1448303, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. July 3, 2002); see also Bloomer v. Costello, 2001 WL 62864, at *5 (S.D.N.Y.\nJan.24, 2001); Distribuidora Dimsa S.A. v. Linea Aerea Del Cobre S.A., 768 F.Supp. 74, 77 (S.D.N.Y.1991).\nThe circumstances of this case counsel against \"anticipating\" Shain's demise. First, it was decided only two years\nago, and there have been no intervening Second Circuit strip search decisions. Second, the Shain majority was\nclearly uncomfortable about the institutional implications of contradicting prior Second Circuit decisions (in Weber,\nWalsh, and Wachtler) absent those decisions' being overruled en banc or by the Supreme Court. See273 F.3d at\n65-66, 273 F.3d at 69-70 (Katzmann, J., concurring). To urge a district court to do what a panel of the Second\nCircuit would not is to display a fundamental misunderstanding of the hierarchical structure of the federal\njudiciary. See Steven G. Calabresi & Gary Lawson, Equity and Hierarchy: Reflections on the Harris Execution,\n102 Yale L.J. 255, 276 n. 6 (\"The hierarchical structure of Article III dictates that inferior courts faithfully apply the\nprecedents of superior courts, just as the hierarchical structure of Article II requires executive officials to follow\npresidential precedents.\").\nI agree that Judge Cabranes's dissent in Shain is most persuasive00the more so in view of the record in this case.\n97\nThe findings of fact set forth above suggest that at least some of the assumptions and distinctions made by the \nShain Court are questionable, if not just plain wrong, and that defendants face very real potential security\nconcerns from any new arrival. And it is hard for me to articulate a principled reason why an inmate cannot be\nstrip searched without reasonable suspicion of contraband carriage when he arrives at OCCF but can lawfully be\nstrip searched after a court date or during a cell shakedown on \"less than probable cause.\" See Bell v. Wolfish,\n441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861. But the panel majority in Shain rejected Judge Cabranes's argument00 which is,\n97\nin essence, defendants' argument to me00and no subsequent Second Circuit or Supreme Court decision has\n97\noverruled it. If the Court of Appeals wishes to \"abandon\" Shain, it must do so.\nHaving concluded that I may not ignore Shain, I turn to the constitutionality of OCCF's strip search policies.\nD. OCCF's Pre-August 2001 Policy\nOCCF's pre-August 2001 strip search policy00strip searching every arrestee admitted to the jail00violated the\n97 97\nFourth Amendment. It was precisely the same policy that was at issue in Shain, where the court found that\npersons charged with a misdemeanor and remanded to a local correctional facility have a right to be free of a\nstrip search absent reasonable suspicion that they are carrying contraband or weapons. Were defendants to\n[43]\nrevert to that policy, as they wish to do, they would be acting illegally.\n\nE. OCCF's August 2001 Policy\nThe August 2001 Policy, which was in effect until August 2002, is unconstitutional because it does not call for an\n83 officer to have individualized suspicion that a detainee *83 is secreting contraband on his person in order to strip\nsearch the detainee.\nUnder that policy, corrections officers strip searched arrestees who exhibited any one of a set of listed factors.\nNotwithstanding the use of the phrase \"may search\" rather than \"must search\" in the policy statement, the officer\nhad no discretion to omit the strip search if one of the factors was present. The idea of the policy was to limit, if\nnot eliminate, officer discretion. See Dodge, 209 F.R.D. at 67.\nAs I explained in Dodge, at least some of those factors, standing alone, were insufficient to establish reasonable\nsuspicion that an inmate was carrying contraband or weapons. 209 F.R.D. at 72-77. Pursuant to the policy, for\nexample, corrections officers could (and did) automatically strip search arrestees who appeared to be under the\ninfluence of alcohol. I fail to see how, all things being equal, a person who is under the influence of alcohol is\nmore likely to be carrying a weapon or contraband than a person who is not under the influence. I suppose\nalcohol intoxication might create reasonable suspicion that someone is secreting alcohol on his person, and\nalcohol is contraband. But a person would be hard pressed to hide a bottle of whisky or can of beer in the areas\nof his body that only an Admissions Search (as defined above) would uncover.\nSimilarly, the August 2001 Policy directed officers to strip search newly-admitted detainees arrested for violating\nparole. At the Dodge hearing, defendants offered no justification for categorically searching that class of\narrestees. 209 F.R.D. at 77. Unless a person violates his parole by using drugs or carrying weapons or being\ninvolved in some violent activity, I fail to see why he is more likely to be secreting contraband on his person than\nis any other person admitted to OCCF.\nOf course, some of the factors listed in the August 2001 Policy might well suffice to create reasonable suspicion\nstanding alone. Pursuant to the policy, for example, officers automatically strip searched arrestees who appeared\nto be under the influence of drugs. Someone who is under the influence of drugs while being admitted to OCCF\nprobably possessed drugs shortly before his arrest. In addition, drug intoxication can result from the ingestion of\na small (and thus easily concealable) quantity of drugs. Thus, an officer faced with an arrestee who appeared to\nbe under the influence of narcotics might well harbor reasonable suspicion that an arrestee may be secreting\ndrugs on their person.\nSimilarly, on the record as it stands now, setting off the BOSS chair may, without more, suffice to create\nreasonable suspicion. At the Dodge preliminary injunction hearing, the evidence showed that new admittees were\nsent through the metal detector and asked to sit on the BOSS chair before they removed their clothing00 or even\n97\nemptied their pockets. They were then strip searched if they set off the alarm. 209 F.R.D. at 68. Between August\n1, 2001 and February 14, 2002, 439 of the 731 documented strip searches at OCCF occurred because the\ninmate activated a metal detector. Id. at 73. Yet there was no evidence that contraband was recovered during any\nof those strip searches, let alone a significant number of them. Id. at 74. As a result, I found on a preliminary\nbasis that simply setting off the BOSS chair was insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion.\nThe statistics about contraband recoveries in Booking and Receiving that plaintiffs introduced at the hearing\ndemonstrate conclusively that little if any contraband was recovered in such searches00or put otherwise, the data\n97\n84 suggest that the BOSS chair, as originally used, was a wildly inaccurate detector of contraband. So if the *84\nsame procedure were being followed with the BOSS chair I would have no reason to revisit my earlier conclusion.\nAt the trial, however, I learned that plaintiffs have changed their procedures relating to the BOSS chair. New\nadmittees are no longer asked to sit on the BOSS chair while wearing their own clothes. Rather, inmates sit on\nthe BOSS chair only after they have changed into an institutional jumpsuit, shedding most if not all of the\nparaphernalia that might activate a metal detector. As a result, it is possible that activating the BOSS chair is now\n[44]\nsufficient to establish reasonable suspicion that an inmate is secreting contraband on his person.\n\nIn short, the defect in the August 2001 Policy is that it does not limit strip searches to situations in a which a\ncorrections officer makes an individualized assessment that a particular defendant presents a reasonably\napprehended risk of carrying contraband. To that extent the policy is unconstitutional.\nThe policy also called for automatically strip searching all newly-admitted detainees who had been arrested on\nsuspicion of a felony. The Dodge plaintiffs represented only misdemeanor arrestees, so I had no reason to\naddress the issue at the preliminary injunction stage. But approximately two months after the Dodge injunction\nissued, I decided the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment in Murcia v. County of Orange, 226 F.Supp.2d\n489, 493-95 (S.D.N.Y.2002). There, in the context of a Section 1983 action for damages, I concluded that it\nunconstitutional for OCCF to strip search newly-admitted inmates solely because they had been arrested for a\nfelony. I noted the Supreme Court's statement that the distinction between felonies and misdemeanors is \"minor\nand often arbitrary.\" Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 14, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (finding \"the\nassumption that a `felon' is more dangerous than a misdemeanant untenable\"); see also Kennedy v. Los Angeles\nPolice Dep't., 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir.1989) (finding Los Angeles Police Department policy requiring strip searches\nof all those arrested on suspicion of having committed a felony to be unconstitutional). And while the holding in \nShain was limited to misdemeanor arrestees, nothing in that decision00or in any other relevant Second Circuit\n97\ndecision00indicated that being arrested for a felony created reasonable suspicion that an arrestee is carrying\n97\nweapons or any other contraband. Indeed, the Second Circuit stopped short of addressing that issue. See Shain,\n[45]\n273 F.3d at 64.\nIn Murcia, the defendants had offered no evidence that would justify a policy for searching all felony detainees. \n226 F.Supp.2d at 496. They had not shown, for example, that felony arrestees were responsible for introducing\nmore contraband than misdemeanor arrestees. Id. Defendants here have had the benefit of developing a record\n85 at a trial on the merits. Yet they still have not demonstrated that a justification exists for strip searching *85 all\nnewly-arraigned felony arrestees. Indeed, defendants themselves argue that \"[t]he undisputed record in this case\ndemonstrates that misdemeanants and lesser violators may be more likely to secrete contraband\n[46]\n....\" [Defendants' Post-Trial Memorandum of Law 11] (emphasis in original). See also Kennedy, 901 F.2d at\n713 (\"A glaring omission from the LAPD's justification [for strip searching all felony arrestees] is any\ndocumentation (or even assertion) that felony arrestees have attempted to smuggle contraband into the jail in\ngreater frequency than misdemeanor arrestees.\"). Absent such evidence, there is no basis for me to depart from\nthe reasoning set forth in Murcia. I therefore find that defendants August 2001 policy was unconstitutional insofar\nas it called for strip searching all newly-admitted detainees arrested on suspicion of a felony.\nF. OCCF's August 2002 Policy\nThe August 2002 Policy that was implemented post-Dodge lists factors that an officer may consider in\ndetermining whether reasonable suspicion exists that an inmate is concealing weapons or other contraband.\nMany of the factors listed are the same factors that automatically called for a strip search under the August 2001\npolicy, such as being a known gang member or having prior escape charges.\nThis portion of the August 2002 Policy complies with Shain00and cures the defect in the August 2001\n97\nPolicy00because it does not direct officers to perform a strip search automatically when any one factor is present.\n97\nRather, it simply gives officers guidance about what they may want to think about in determining whether\nreasonable suspicion exists. Thus, insofar as OCCF officers comply with these written dictates of the August\n2002 Policy, defendants comport with the law's requirement that jail officers search only search newly-admitted\npre-trial detainees if they develop reasonable suspicion based on \"the crime charged, particular characteristics of\nthe arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\" 273 F.3d at 63.\nPlaintiffs did demonstrate that officers on occasion strip searched newly-admitted pretrial detainees without\nreasonable suspicion. See supra pp. 58-64. The evidence plaintiffs presented at trial does not establish, however,\nthat the August 2002 Policy exists only \"on paper.\" While OCCF officers have fallen short of complying with their\nwritten policy and have strip searched some arrestees absent reasonable suspicion, I cannot conclude that they\nhave fallen so short of their stated policy to suggest that they are systemically effectuating an unconstitutional\n\npolicy. I believe that Capt. Ryan and his staff are attempting to comply with the August 2002 Policy, even though\nthey do not like it.\nHowever, the August 2002 Policy mandates strip searches of all detainees who have been arrested on suspicion\n[47]\nof a felony, weapons, or narcotics offense.  [DX 30]. Plaintiffs do not contend that being arrested for a\nweapons or narcotics offense is insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion, but the Rango plaintiffs, who\nrepresent all pre-trial detainees strip-searched because they were arrested on suspicion of a felony, specifically\n86 challenge that portion *86 of the policy. I conclude, for the reasons stated above, that the August 2002 Policy is\nunconstitutional to the extent that it calls for an on-arrival strip search of every felony detainee without\nindividualized reasonable suspicion that the detainee is carrying contraband.\nIII. Plaintiffs' Request for an Injunction is Granted\nSuccess on the merits is necessary but not sufficient to establish plaintiffs' right to injunctive relief. Plaintiffs must\nalso show that the balance of hardships tips in their favor.\nMoreover, the PLRA mandates that I determine whether any injunctive relief I award plaintiffs is narrowly tailored.\nUnlike the requirement that the balance of hardships favor plaintiffs, however, the PLRA's tailoring requirement\ndoes not affect the availability of injunctive relief. Rather, it affects the scope of the equitable relief a court may\norder once that court determines that an injunction should issue. In other words, \"[a]lthough the PLRA\nsignificantly affects the type of prospective injunctive relief that may be awarded, it has not substantially changed\nthe threshold findings and standards required to justify an injunction.\" Gomez v. Vernon, 255 F.3d 1118, 1129\n(9th Cir.2001); see also Imprisoned Citizens Union v. Ridge, 169 F.3d 178, 188 (3d Cir.1999); Smith v. Arkansas\nDep't of Correction, 103 F.3d 637, 647 (8th Cir.1996); Handberry v. Thompson, 219 F.Supp.2d 525, 532-33\n(S.D.N.Y.2002); Jones `El v. Berge, 164 F.Supp.2d 1096, 1116 (W.D.Wis.2001).\nDefendants argue that no injunction should issue, regardless of my findings concerning Shain and the\nconstitutionality of OCCF's thereunder, because (1) the balance of hardship tips in OCCF's favor, and (2) it is not\npossible to fashion an injunction that complies with the PLRA. I address these arguments in turn.\nA. Balance of Hardships\nPlaintiffs would suffer a substantial hardship in the absence of an injunction. Having one's constitutional rights\nviolated is, a priori, a substantial hardship. Moreover, the nature of this particular constitutional violation, being\nstrip searched, represents a serious intrusion that is often humiliating, even when performed in the most\nprofessional manner. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 588, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (stating that a\nvisual body cavity search is a \"practice [that] instinctively gives us the most pause\"); id. at 576-77, 99 S.Ct. 1861\n(Marshall, J., dissenting) (asserting that visual strip searches \"represent one of the most grievous offenses\nagainst personal dignity and common decency\"); id. at 594, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (remarking\nthat visual body cavity searches are \"clearly the greatest personal indignity\"); Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\nCir. 1997) (\"Our circuit has `recognize[d], as have all courts that have considered the issue, the severe if not\ngross interference with a person's privacy that occurs when guards conduct a visual inspection of body cavities.'\")\n(quoting Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 887 (1st Cir.1983)); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395 (10th Cir.1993)\n(\"It is axiomatic that a strip search is an invasion of personal rights of the first magnitude.\"); Boren v. Deland, 958\nF.2d 987, 988 n. 1 (10th Cir.1992) (\"One's anatomy is draped with constitutional protection .... [A] strip search,\nregardless how professionally and courteously conducted, is an embarrassing and humiliating experience,\"); \nThompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1446 (9th Cir.1989) (\"The feelings of humiliation and\ndegradation associated with forcibly exposing one's nude body to strangers for visual inspection is beyond\ndispute.\"); Mary Beth G. v. Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983) (\"strip searches involving the visual\n87 inspection *87 of the anal and genital areas [are] demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying,\nunpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission\"). Preventing the deprivation of\nplaintiffs' constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches of this most intrusive form is of utmost\nimportance to this Court.\n\nAs for the possible injuries defendants would suffer if I were to award plaintiffs an injunction: The PLRA specifies\nthat I must give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of the criminal justice\nsystem. This case is somewhat unique in that defendants have for the most part been applying a constitutionally-\ncompliant reasonable suspicion standard since August of 2002 (with the exception of felony arrestees), so there\nis empirical evidence with which to assess any hardship defendants' would suffer by being enjoined to comply\nwith Shain.\nDefendants argue that they have suffered the following hardship since August of 2002:(1) substantially more\ncontraband has been smuggled into OCCF, increasing the danger to inmates, corrections officers, and staff; (2)\nOCCF has had to expend more resources to comply with the August 2002 Policy; (3) OCCF has had to\nimplement more pat searches in Booking and Receiving, which may increase the tension between inmates and\nofficers; (4) OCCF has had to increase the number of cell shakedowns, which has increased tensions between\nthe inmates and corrections officers and jeopardized officers' safety; and (5) OCCF is unable to comply with the\nreasonable suspicion standard.\nI can dismiss defendants' argument that more contraband has been smuggled into the facility as a result of the\nAugust 2002 Policy. As explained in the findings of fact, the data belies this contention.\nThe resources defendants have expended in order to comply with the OCCF Policy include spending $10,000 on\ngloves for performing pat searches and stationing an officer in Booking and Receiving to assist officers in\napplying reasonable suspicion standard. I am, of course, wary of diverting OCCF resources; jail officials are best\nable to optimally disburse their limited funds. But defendants have not demonstrated that these two additional\nexpenses have strained their budget or that the costs have been particularly onerous (at their new multi-million\ndollar facility).\nI note that defendants would suffer similar hardship even if I did not enter an injunction. Absent a court ruling that\nOCCF need not comply with Shain00and as I have explained I am in no position to issue such a ruling00OCCF\n97 97\nwould expose itself to punitive damages in individual Section 1983 actions if it reverted to its past policy of strip\nsearching all arrestees. Of course, one of the functions of punitive damages is to force a party to comply with the\nlaw. Thus, there exists a distinct possibility that OCCF would suffer the same hardship regardless of whether I\nissue an injunction.\nFar more troubling is defendants' claim that increased tensions have resulted from an increase in pat searches\nand cell shakedowns. This is a penological concern of the first order. However, in support of this potentially\ntroubling allegation defendants rely solely on (1) their expert's opinion that properly performed pat searches are\nintrusive in nature, [Tr. 444-45 (Camp Testimony)], and (2) Capt. Ryan's testimony that an officer was injured\nwhen an inmate attacked him during a cell shakedown in October of 2002. [Ryan Direct ¶ 35]. It a stretch and\nthen some to infer from this either that tensions between inmates and officers have risen markedly since August\n88 of 2002, or that instituting a constitutionally-compliant strip search policy *88 for new arrivals was the reason.\nThus while I take this evidence into account in balancing the hardships, I do not weigh it as heavily as I would\nhad defendants supported their allegation of increased tensions with more substantial evidence. And I note that\nthere is no evidence that newly-arrived post-arraignment inmates are the source of any amount, let alone a great\ndeal, of the contraband that is being recovered during shakedowns.\nAs for defendants' claim that they cannot comply with the reasonable suspicion standard: they argue that it is\nimpossible for them to make an individualized assessment of reasonable suspicion because the officers stationed\nat Booking and Receiving lack the sort of information that would enable them to make a Shain-type assessment\n00information about the nature of the crime, the circumstances of the arrest and the particular characteristics of\n97\nthe detainee. To the extent that they do have information, they argue that it is inherently unreliable because it is\nself-reported.\nAs my findings of fact demonstrate, the officers stationed in Booking and Receiving lack information largely\nbecause jail officials choose not to procure it for them. No effort has been made to obtain information about the\npending charges and about detainees from the arresting jurisdictions. While Capt. Ryan believes it would be\nimpossible, he has no basis for so believing because he has never tried to do it. More significantly, booking and\n\nreceiving officers are not even provided with information that is already available at OCCF00rap sheets and\n97\ninformation about prior commitment history at the jail00that would assist the officers to perform their constitutional\n97\nduty of assessment. There are none so blind as those who will not see.\nThe County's argument about the reliability of self-reported information is similarly unpersuasive. While there will\ndoubtless be occasions when self-reported information turns out to be wrong, the County has offered no\nevidence that this happens with the frequency necessary to make such information inherently unreliable in the\nvast majority of cases. Indeed, because some number of new arrivals will never have had contact with the\ncriminal justice system, OCCF will always have to rely on self-reported information to a certain extent, since there\nare no fingerprints in the system that can be used to check their identities.\nI can well understand Capt. Ryan's desire to minimize security risks by strip searching all new arrivals at OCCF.\nHe and his officers are charged with maintaining security. Security is a function of the information available. And\nno system can guarantee him perfect information about arriving inmates. But the way to minimize the risk is to\nmake the most of the information that is available. Clearly, officials at OCCF, by their own choice, do not make\nthe most of the information that is or could be made available to them. Until they do, they cannot complain about\nthe limitations of an imperfect information system.\nLast, I must address whether changing defendants' August 2002 Policy to extend the \"individualized reasonable\nsuspicion standard\" to newly-admitted accused felons would work an unreasonable hardship on defendants.\nSince no evidence before me suggests that felony arrestees are more likely than misdemeanants to attempt to\nsmuggle contraband into the facility (indeed, as noted above, defendants contend the opposite), I cannot find that\nan injunction to obey the law would create a hardship.\nI conclude that the balance of hardships tips in plaintiffs' favor.\nB. The Scope of the Injunction\n89 I reject defendants argument that the PLRA would be violated by issuance of an *89 injunction. I am mindful that\nthe PLRA requires me to find that the injunction is narrowly drawn, extends no further than is necessary to correct\nthe constitutional harm found, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct that harm. But the PLRA's\nmandate to narrowly tailor injunctive relief does not eliminate courts' ability to issue injunctions. See, e.g., \nImprisoned Citizens, 169 F.3d at 188 (\"Under the PLRA, courts retain authority to adjudicate constitutional\nchallenges and grant equitable relief to remedy constitutional violations.\").\nI hereby enjoin defendants from strip searching (as defined above) newly-arrived pre-trial detainees upon their\ninitial admission to OCCF unless officials have a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or\nother contraband based on the crime charged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the\ncircumstances of the arrest. I cannot imagine an injunction that is narrower, less extensive, or less intrusive (while\ncorrecting the constitutional harm). I am not mandating any specific actions defendants must take. Rather, I am\ntelling defendants that they must adhere to the reasonable suspicion standard set forth in Shain before strip\n[48]\nsearching any newly arrived inmate. It is entirely up to defendants how they will comply with the law.\nAs a practical matter, complying with the injunction will mean continuing to comply with the August 2002 Policy\nexcept in one respect: OCCF officers can no longer strip search newly admitted detainees simply and solely\nbecause they are charged with a felony. I leave it to defendants' discretion to change the written policy to reflect\nthis change, and to ensure that OCCF officers act accordingly.\nCONCLUSION\nPlaintiffs' request for an injunction is granted. My order granting plaintiffs an injunction is directly appealable to\nthe Second Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), even though the plaintiffs' claims for damages remain to\nbe tried to a jury. See Petereit v. S.B. Thomas, Inc., 63 F.3d 1169, 1175 (2d Cir.1995); 16 Charles A. Wright &\n\nArthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, § 3924, at 146 (1995). If defendants intend to take an appeal,\nthe Court will stay further proceedings pending the determination of that appeal.\nThis constitutes the decision and order of the Court.\n90 *90\n91 *91\n[1] While the Second Circuit in Shain did not consider a county jail to be a \"prison,\" the facility clearly falls within\nthe definition of the term \"prison\" as used by Congress in the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), which\ndefines \"prison\" as \"any Federal, State, or local facility that incarcerates or detains juveniles or adults accused of,\nconvicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(5).\n[2] According to the 2000 Census, Orange County is the eleventh most populous of New York's sixty two\ncounties. Between 1990 and 2000, its population grew by eleven percent. Only three other counties (Putnam,\nQueens, and Richmond) grew at a faster rate. This information is available online at http://\nwww.empire.state.ny.us/nysdc/census2000/pl94/ctytabl.pdf.\n[3] Due to security concerns, the diagrams provided by OCCF are incomplete and not to scale.\n[4] In New York State, all persons accused of misdemeanors must be admitted to bail pursuant to N.Y.Crim. Proc.\nL. § 170.10(7), as recognized in Shain.273 F.3d at 65.\n[5] New arrivals are not the only persons who are in-processed at Booking and Receiving. Inmates who are\ncoming in to serve weekend sentences, inmates returning from work details, and inmates returning from court are\nall in-processed at Booking and Receiving and should be distinguished from inmates00 whether accused of\n97\nmisdemeanors or felonies 00who are arriving at OCCF for the first time following arraignment.\n97\n[6] It is therefore not necessary for me to make detailed findings of fact about the wonderful educational and\nreligious programs that are conducted at OCCF, or for that matter about all the ways in which contraband\ncirculates among members of the general population. Proposed findings on these and other irrelevant subjects\ntake up numerous single-spaced pages of defendants' lengthy, argumentative, and heavily footnoted Proposed\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n[7] Significantly for this case, none of these items was found in or around an arrestee's anal, groinal, or vaginal\narea00i.e., areas where only an Admission Strip Search (as I have defined that term above) will uncover\n97\ncontraband.\n[8] In 1999, 32% of the pre-trial inmates at OCCF were felony detainees and 53% were misdemeanor detainees;\n36% were felony detainees and 50% were misdemeanor detainees in 2000; 36% were felony detainees and 49%\nwere misdemeanor detainees in 2001; and 42% were felony detainees and 44% were misdemeanor detainees in\n2002. [DX 5, 6, 8, 10].\n[9] In August of 2000, 33% of the pre-trial inmates admitted to OCCF after arraignment upon being charged with\na misdemeanor or civil violation had a felony history and 42% had a gang affiliation; 34% had a felony history and\n40% had a gang affiliation in August of 2001; and 26% had a felony history and 50% had a gang affiliation in\nAugust of 2002. [DX 7A, 7B, 9A, 9B, 11A, 11B].\n[10] As a former state court judge who spent three years trying felonies, I am constrained to note that pre-\nsentence reports in the New York State system00at least in New York City00are of wildly varying quality. Some\n97 97\ninclude considerable background information about a newly arrived prisoner; some tell the judge almost nothing.\n[11] The declaration and testimony of Officer Mertens also support this conclusion. [PX 34; Tr. 145-46].\n[12] The August 2001 Policy included additional circumstances that would warrant a strip search, but they applied\noutside the context of Admissions Searches00for example, after the violation of particular contact visiting rules.\n97\n\n[13] In Dodge, I found, based on a record that was far more limited than the one currently before me, that each of\nseveral factors that automatically led to a strip search under the August 2001 policy00specifically, activation of the\n97\nmetal detectors/BOSS chair (in the circumstances in which the chair was used at that time, which was prior to the\ninmate's removing his clothing and donning prison garb), the appearance of intoxication, or arrest for violation of\nprobation00was insufficient, standing alone, to establish the reasonable suspicion necessary to conduct strip\n97\nsearch. 209 F.R.D. at 73-77.\n[14] In Dodge I was unable to conclude whether Anthony Dodge had or had not been strip searched00the\n97\ncorrections officer who allegedly conducted the search denied it and it seemed quite possible that Mr. Dodge was\nconfusing his January 29, 2002 arrest with one of the many previous times when he was strip searched under the\nblanket policy. Nothing in the present record adds to my ability to make that determination. In order to recover for\nthis particular incident during the damages phase of this case, Mr. Dodge will have to prove to the satisfaction of\na jury that he was in fact strip searched in connection with this arrest. \nAs for Gordon Barnum, the third inmate whose strip search during the August 2001-2002 period was addressed\nin Dodge: Barnum was arrested for petit larceny. He was a frequent visitor to OCCF, and he had a history of\nusing drugs and stealing to support his drug habit. He even stole drugs00the arrest in question occurred when he\n97\nattempted to steal Tylenol from a convenience store. Barnum appeared to be under the influence of something\nwhen he arrived at OCCF and he told the booking officer that he had taken crack cocaine within the previous\ntwenty four hours. For reasons to be discussed below, I conclude that the officers had reasonable suspicion to\nconduct a strip search of Barnum00 an issue I did not need to reach in Dodge. See209 F.R.D. at 77.\n97\n[15] The injunction was entered on July 26, 2002, and defendants implemented their new policy soon after in\nAugust of 2002. As will be noted below, this intake procedure differed in at least one significant particular from the\nprocedure that was followed from August 2001 until August 2002.\n[16] See below for specific findings of fact concerning OCCF's compliance or non-compliance with this policy in\nparticular cases.\n[17] This is a significant difference from the policy that was described to me at the preliminary injunction hearing.\nThere, Lt DeMarco, the Records Supervisor at OCCF, testified that the inmates were put through the BOSS chair\nbefore being ordered to remove their own clothing and change into prison garb. Lt DeMarco also testified that no\ninmate was ever strip searched under the August 2001 policy before being placed in the metal detector/BOSS\nchair. Dodge, 209 F.R.D. at 68. The arriving inmates were asked to remove anything that might set off a metal\ndetector before being put through the machines, but of course items like jewelry, belts, shoe lasts and jeans studs\ncould well have set off the detectors as the BOSS chair was originally used. Lt. DeMarco's testimony was\nconfirmed by Capt. Ryan and Corrections Officers Fagan and Essig. Id.\nIssuing prison garb before putting someone through the metal detector/BOSS chair no doubt cuts down on the\nfalse positives that were the subject of much testimony and discussion in Dodge. Statistics introduced at the\npreliminary injunction hearing demonstrated that 60% of the strip searches that were conducted between August\n1, 2001 and February 14, 2002 were triggered by the inmate's setting off the metal detector/BOSS chair.\nUnfortunately, no one explained why strip searches for reasons other than setting off the BOSS chair were\nmoved to an earlier point in the booking and receiving process.\n[18] After classification, twenty-three hour a day confinement would be considered punitive in nature.\n[19] This is true at the post-classification stage as well.\n[20] Though Captain Ryan did not so specify, I assume that he was referring to the regulations concerning\nNYSPIN security set forth at N.Y. Comp.Codes R. & Revs. tit. 9, § 486.4 (2003).\n[21] I must observe that the judges and magistrates who sit in arraignment parts and make bail decisions at\narraignment hearings do not have the luxury of waiting several days for fingerprint confirmation to come in, and\nthus rely heavily on these very File 15 \"rap sheets\" to make decisions that affect the safety of the community.\nWhile I recognize that people do on occasion use aliases to try to mask their identity, I also recognize that\n\nNYSPIN rap sheets provide helpful information00sometimes the most helpful information00when time is of the\n97 97\nessence (for example, to satisfy constitutional arrest-to-arraignment standards). Indeed, OCCF corrections\nofficers make preliminary risk assessments about new prisoners in order to assign them appropriately within the\npre-classification housing bloc00 according to defendants, OCCF personnel assess each new arrival for identified\n97\ndirect contact problems (i.e., should the inmate by kept apart from some other particular inmate), propensity for\nvictimization, and risk of escape. Thus, it is simply silly for defendants to suggest that rap sheets are of no value\nwhatever until fingerprint confirmation comes in.\n[22] Presumably, the concern is that the Booking and Receiving officers would tell other corrections officers\n\"privileged\" information about arriving prisoners. Of course, officers working in Classifications, who have access\nto this \"privileged\" information, could do exactly the same thing.\n[23] The reason for this incomprehensible development is that neither side in Dodge so much as mentioned the\nPLRA until after the preliminary injunction expired. Apparently, neither plaintiffs' counsel nor the County's attorney\nwas aware that, pursuant to the PLRA, preliminary injunctive relief expires unless the court makes the order final,\nconsistent with § 3626(a)(1) (which requires a court to make findings as to whether prospective relief is narrowly\ndrawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive\nmeans necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right), within ninety days after the entry of the preliminary\ninjunction. Plaintiffs made no effort to have this Court timely make the findings necessary to permit continuance\nof the injunction. \nAfter the decision in Dodge came out, Orange County hired as outside counsel the law firm of Epstein, Becker &\nGreen, which has handled considerable PLRA litigation. Since Epstein Becker's entrance into the case, the PLRA\nand its requirements have been the focus of substantial litigation, and this trial was conducted with those\nrequirements very much in mind.\n[24] Luke was a frequent visitor to OCCF, having been arrested and strip searched on two prior occasions\npursuant to the blanket strip search policy. [Plaintiff's Proposed Finding of Fact 2-13].\n[25] Officer William Proscia also appears to share this misapprehension. [Tr. 534].\n[26] I recognize that it is also consistent with her having been transported to OCCF for the first time in the\ncompany of other inmates, but the record contains no information about the circumstances in which she was\ntransported to the jail. Moreover, I find Officer Duryea to be a credible witness.\n[27] The New York State Commission on Corrections (\"NYSCOC\") has issued regulations that require\ncorrectional facilities to report certain contraband that is found in a facility. [DX 31]. See N.Y. Comp.Codes R. &\nRevs. tit. 9, §§ 7022.1-7022.7 (2003). It is mandatory, for example, for a correctional facility to report the\ndiscovery of any amount of marijuana or alcohol. [DX 31, at 5-6]. When such a report is made, it is called a State\nReportable Incident (\"S.R.I.\").\n[28] As noted above, items recovered at \"Booking and Receiving\" are not limited to those recovered from new\narrivals00inmates returning from court visits or work details are strip searched in Booking and Receiving as well.\n97\nNeither side has suggested what proportion of the few items of contraband that were recovered in Booking and\nReceiving came from newly-admitted inmates and what proportion came from returning inmates, the propriety of\nwhose strip searches has not been called into question. However, items recovered at Booking and Receiving\nnecessarily account for the entire universe of contraband recovered from newly-admitted inmates during\nAdmissions Searches. Therefore, as a matter of logic, no more than 17 items of State reportable contraband\nwere recovered during Admissions Strip Searches during 1999.\n[29] Ryan testified: \nQ My question is: In your review of the records00let's say for the year 199900did you review those records?\n97 97\nA I think so, yes.\n\nQ In your review of the records, did you see whether or not there were any incidents of contraband that were\nreported by corrections officers internally00that is, within the facility00that were not in turn reported to the state, yet\n97 97\nthey were reportable incidents?\n* * * * * *\nA No. Not that I seen, no.\nQ So based on your review, all reportable incidents of contraband were, in fact, reported to the state?\nA As far as I could see, yes. [Tr. 110-11].\n[30] Although it is not clear when the officers who searched Mr. Morant learned of his history at OCCF (i.e.,\nbefore or after they searched him), it is clear that they had access to that information.\n[31] Whenever an inmate leaves the building and returns00whether to go out on a work detail or to go to court00he\n97 97\nor she is strip searched. As noted above, these strip searches take place in Booking and Receiving, and any\ncontraband recovered from them is chalked up to Booking and Receiving.\n[32] OCCF contains a visiting area in which inmates sit across tables from visitors (other than lawyers, for whom\nthere is a separate visiting area). Following all such visits, every inmate is strip searched. Such searches may be\nconducted on \"less than probable cause.\" See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447\n(1979).\n[33] The Covino Court did not mention the breakdown of the institution's inmate population; for example, whether\nit housed mostly convicted inmates or pretrial detainees.\n[34] The Monroe County Correctional Facility (Weber), the Nassau County Correctional Facility (Shain), and even\nOCCF (this case) are all rather large, multi-purpose correctional facilities serving populous counties. The\nHerkimer County Correctional Facility (Wachtler) serves one of the smallest counties in New York State. The\nHerkimer County Correctional Facility at any given time houses but a small fraction of those inmates residing in\nthe county jail serving suburban Long Island. (After a recent increase in its capacity, HCCF is now able to house\nan average of fifty inmates a day. See Melissa A. Chadwick, Herkimer County Approves Criminal-Monitoring\nDevices, Utica Observer-Dispatch, June 12, 2003.) This difference, and any legitimate penological implications it\nmight have, were not discussed in Shain.\n[35] The Shain majority failed to note that transfer to one of the state's prisons does not take place immediately\nupon conviction. Thus, New York's local correctional facilities also house convicted felons pending sentence.\n[36] It was necessary for plaintiff to move for summary judgment because there was no motion for a directed\nverdict, so the Court could not enter judgment in his favor at the time the jury's verdict was overturned.\n[37] The unfortunate twist in Mr. Murcia's case is that he was the wrong Mr. Murcia. He claims that he endured a\ntotal of four strip searches00one in the City of Newburgh and three at OCCF00before the mistake was uncovered.\n97 97\n[38] I nonetheless dismissed the complaint as to Sheriff Bigger, the promulgator of OCCF's strip search policy, on\nthe ground of qualified immunity, recognizing that Murcia extended the factual predicate for onarrival strip\nsearches to a group of arrestees not considered in Shain00felony arrestees. Plaintiffs have moved for reargument\n97\nof that decision.\n[39] Orange County first made this argument in Lee v. Perez. It has made the same argument (albeit in\nincreasingly more sophisticated terms) in every case since.\n[40] Although a third strip search of Murcia took place at OCCF, the parties were not able to agree whether it was\nconducted by state or federal officials. That issue remains for trial.\n[41] If the officer in Sarnicola had not testified that he had no reason to believe that Ms. Sarnicola was secreting\ndrugs on her person, the case might well have been decided differently. See infra p. 84.\n\n[42] Michigan law distinguishes between county jails and state penal institutions. Compare Mich. Comp. Laws §\n791.262 and Mich. Admin. Code r. 791.707 (2003) with Mich. Comp. Laws § 791.206 and Mich. Admin. Code r.\n791.1101 (2003). The visitation rules the Supreme Court addressed in Overton, Mich. Admin. Code r. 791.6609\n(2003), do not appear to apply to county jails.\n[43] In response to a query from the Court, defendants insist that they are not seeking a declaration that they can\nrevert to the old \"search `em all\" policy. However, they seem to feel that, if I decline to enter an injunction, they\nwould be free to revert to that policy. [September 3, 2003 Letter to the Court]. I do not understand the logic\nbehind their position. I could, for example, decline to enter an injunction because I found that the August 2001\nOCCF policy was constitutional. Such decision would hardly imply that the prior policy was similarly\nconstitutional.\n[44] The record does not contain any data that would allow me to draw any conclusion on that score.\n[45] In Shain, Judge Katzmann indicated his belief that Second Circuit jurisprudence distinguished between\nfelony and misdemeanor arrestees00a distinction he was not sure he would make if it had not already been made\n97\nfor him. 273 F.3d at 69-70 (Katzmann, J., concurring). I have looked for a definitive holding by the Court of\nAppeals to the effect that a felony defendant's post-arraignment detention is in fact an indicator of increased\nsecurity risk. I found no such holding. Saying that post-arraignment felony detainees \"may well\" present an\nincreased security risk is as far as the Circuit has gone.\n[46] Though I do not credit the data on which defendants rely, they also argue that \"the SRI reports at the OCCF\nshow that misdemeanants and lesser violators are primarily responsible for the majority of the contraband\nincidents during the admission process.\" [Defendants' Post-Trial Memorandum of Law 11].\n[47] The policy also mandates strip searches of all sentenced inmates (both felons and misdemeanants) admitted\nto the facility, as well as all \"weekenders\" returning to the facility from their time away. [DX 30]. Plaintiffs here are\nall pre-trial detainees and do not purport to challenge these strip searches.\n[48] As I learned at the trial, New York City has chosen to balance security concerns and comply with Shain by\nacquiring hospital gowns that inmates wear when they bend over and cough. The maneuver dislodges the\ncontraband while the gown protects privacy. [Tr. 393-94 (Fraser Testimony)]. I am not ordering OCCF to follow\nthis or any other procedure, but Capt. Ryan and his staff may wish to consider it as one alternative method of\ncomplying with this injunction.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

(Tr. at 98–99.) However, both Captain Ryan \nbe the more appropriate method of adjudicating this case.  and  Lieutenant  Dominic  De  Marco,  the  Records \nDodge  v.

(Tr. at 99–100, 117.)1 Nothing in the \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction preventing  written  policy  requires  a  corrections  officer  ask  a \nthe Orange County Jail from maintaining its current strip  supervisor before conducting a strip search, and officers \n  1 \n \n\nDodge v.

The defendants did not present  Plaintiffs  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  this  new \nthe Court with evidence of so much as a single instance  policy.  They  argue  that  its  non-discretionary  nature \nwhen a strip search was not conducted after one of the  renders it a per se violation of the constitution, since an \nSection  *68  5.3.1  triggers  was  met.
