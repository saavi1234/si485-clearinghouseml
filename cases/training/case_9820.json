    "summary": "<p>On February 10, 1988, two individuals filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the County of Los Angeles in the United States District  Court for the Central District of California, Western Division. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for injunctive and monetary relief, claiming that their Fourth Amendment rights had been violated. Specifically, they claimed that L.A. County's policy of strip searching them violated their constitutional rights.</p><p>On February 21, 1987, plaintiffs, a mother and daughter, were jewelry shopping. During lunch, across the street from one of the jewelers they had visited, the plaintiffs were accosted by the owner of the jewelry store, who accused the mother of stealing one of the rings she had handled in the store. The mother claimed she had been attacked by the jeweler, and escaped into a bathroom after the jeweler stole her purse. </p><p>The mother and daughter were both arrested by the LAPD, and transported to central station. The LAPD had a policy of strip and cavity searching all felony arrestees, regardless of charge. The plaintiffs were both subjected to a visual vaginal and anal inspection. The mother was transported to a hospital to have an x-ray, presumably to see if she had swallowed the missing ring. </p><p>Plaintiffs were then transported to the Sybil Brand Institute women's jail, where they were subjected to a second strip search. After being incarcerated for twelve hours, and after the searches revealed no drugs, merchandise, or any evidence of any crime, the plaintiffs were released on bail. Plaintiffs were never charged.</p><p>On March 8, 1989, the District Court (Judge A. Wallace Tashima) granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, finding that the police officers had reasonable cause to arrest the plaintiffs and that, reasonable cause notwithstanding, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. Plaintiffs appealed. </p><p>On October 1, 1990, in a published opinion written by Judge Harry Pregerson, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  (Judges Pregerson,  Cynthia Hall, and Stephen Reinhardt) found that the plaintiffs' unlawful arrest claim was properly dismissed at summary judgment, as the defendant officers were entitled to qualified immunity on that issue.  However, the Court found that the blanket policy of searching all arrestees arrested for felonies did not comport with Bell v. Wolfish and did not qualify as a search incident to arrest under Chimel v. California. However, the Court found that because the \"contours\" of the Bell v. Wolfish right were not apparent to a reasonable officer at the time of the search, , the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. The case was remanded to allow the charge against the City of Los Angeles to continue, but affirming the dismissals against the officers.</p><p>We have no information about the result on remand.</p><p>The case closed on October 8, 1992.</p><p></p>",

JEWELRY, Pravis Kashanian, Officer Liggett, Officer Parga, Officer Barham, City of\nLos Angeles, County of Los Angeles, Defendants-Appellees.\nNo. 89-55710.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.\nArgued and Submitted October 1, 1990.\nDecided December 11, 1991.\n11443389 *1438*1439 Edward M. Fox, Klass, Helman & Ross, Los Angeles, Cal., for plaintiffs-appellants.\nRichard W. Helgeson, Deputy City Atty., Los Angeles, Cal., for defendants-appellees.\nBefore PREGERSON, REINHARDT and HALL, Circuit Judges.\nPREGERSON, Circuit Judge:\nPlaintiffs-Appellants Annise and Roshaun Fuller were arrested on suspicion of grand theft of a ring from M.G.\nJewelry. Pursuant to their arrest, the Fullers were subjected to strip and visual body cavity searches, which\nrevealed no evidence of any crime. No charges were ever filed against them.\nAs a result of the arrest and searches, the Fullers brought a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the\nCounty of Los Angeles, the City of Los Angeles, and three individual police officers. The district court granted\nsummary judgment against the Fullers. The court concluded that probable cause existed to arrest and strip\nsearch the Fullers, and that, in any event, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. The district court also\ndenied the Fullers' motion for reconsideration.\nThe Fullers appeal both the grant of summary judgment and the denial of their motion for reconsideration. We\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nBACKGROUND\nOn February 21, 1987, Annise Fuller, her daughter Roshaun, and a companion named Helen Allen entered M.G.\nJewelry Store to return an item for repair. According to Appellee Pravis Kashanian, the jewelry merchant, Annise\nasked to see a ring (\"ring No. 1\") from the display case, which she examined and passed to Roshaun and Allen.\nAllen then asked to see another ring (ring No. 2\"), which she admired and passed to Annise. Kashanian reported\nthat while Annise placed ring No. 2 on her finger, she held ring No. 1 in her hand. Allen eventually decided to put\ndown a $20 deposit on ring No. 2 for lay-away.\nThe three women then left the store and continued shopping. According to the Fullers, they later returned to the\narea near the jewelry store to eat. Meanwhile, Kashanian noticed ring No. 1 was missing and determined to his\nsatisfaction that no one else in the store had it. Believing the Fullers had stolen the ring, Kashanian contends he\napproached the women, who were then across the street from M.G. Jewelry, and asked Annise to return to the\nstore. According to Kashanian, Annise became nervous and attempted to walk away, but he grabbed her wrist. A\nstruggle ensued between Kashanian, Annise, and Roshaun. Annise maintains that Kashanian pushed her into a\nnearby restaurant (Kashanian reported that Annise ran into the restaurant herself), demanded that she open her\npurse, then grabbed her purse and ran out. Annise says she then went to the bathroom to wipe her face, which\nhad been injured, while Roshaun ran after Kashanian.\n\nA witness who was in the bathroom when Annise entered told police that Annise ran to the front of the line and\nasked everyone to leave because she had to throw up. The witness reported Annise appeared to be choking and\ngagging to make herself throw up. Although only one bathroom stall was operational and approximately ten\nwomen were in line, they refused to relinquish the stall to Annise. Annise left the bathroom momentarily, then\nreturned and repeated her request. Her plea was ignored once again, but the witness reported that she seemed\nto get better and left.\nLos Angeles Police Officers Liggett, Parga, and Barham arrived at the scene and interviewed Kashanian, who\n1440 reported that *1440 the Fullers had stolen a ring valued at $800. The officers also spoke with a store employee\nnamed Ms. Barberena, with the unnamed rest room witness, with Allen, and with the Fullers, who denied they\ntook anything. Officer Judy Barham conducted a pat down search of the three women. She also searched their\npurses, and conducted a thorough search of the restaurant, including the trash cans, bathroom stalls, commodes,\nsinks and sink drains. Although no ring was ever found, Annise and Roshaun were arrested and booked for grand\ntheft.\nAfter their arrest, Annise and Roshaun were transported to the Los Angeles Police Department (\"LAPD\") central\nstation and subjected to a strip and visual body cavity search. Officer Barham took Annise into the bathroom,\nmade her undress, searched her clothing, and then visually inspected Annise's vagina and rectum. Barham\n[1]\nconducted a similar search of Roshaun.  Barham also searched the toilet after Roshaun had used it. Annise\nwas then transported to the hospital for an x-ray. None of the searches revealed any drugs, weapons, or stolen\nitems.\nAt the time the searches were conducted, the LAPD followed a policy that required strip and body cavity\n[2]\nsearches of all felony arrestees, regardless of the crime with which they were charged.\nThe Fullers were eventually transported to the Los Angeles County Sybil Brand Institute women's jail, where they\nwere booked and subjected to a second strip search by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department personnel. The\nFullers remained incarcerated for twelve hours before they were released on bail. No charges were ever filed\nagainst them.\nThe Fullers brought this action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the County of Los Angeles, the City of Los\nAngeles, and the three police officers based on their arrest and subsequent strip searches. They alleged, among\nother things, that the arrest and the searches conducted by LAPD officers and Sheriff's Department personnel\nviolated their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Before trial, the Fullers filed motions for\nsummary judgment against the County, City, and police officers on the issue of liability. All of the defendants filed\ncounter motions for summary judgment.\nOn March 8, 1989, the district court granted the summary judgment counter motion brought by both the City and\n[3]\nthe police officers (hereafter, \"Appellees\") and dismissed the action against those defendants on the merits.\nThe court concluded that the police officers \"had reasonable cause to arrest plaintiffs for grand theft of the\nmissing ring.\" The court also determined that the officers had \"reasonable cause or suspicion to justify a full body\ncavity search incident to arrest and booking.\" The court found that even if no probable cause existed for the\nsearch, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established at the time of arrest\nthat such a search would be unconstitutional.\nFinally, the court concluded that under Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct.\n2018, 2036, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), the City of Los Angeles could not be held liable because the officers had not\nviolated any of the Fullers' constitutional rights. The court determined that the City's policy regarding strip\n1441 searches *1441 of felony arrestees in other circumstances was irrelevant, because \"the search here was not\nunconstitutional.\"\nThe Fullers then filed a motion for reconsideration. On June 8, 1989, the district court denied the motion,\ndismissed private party defendants M.G. Jewelry and Kashanian, and ordered certification pursuant to\nFed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) to establish an appealable final judgment. On June 15, 1989, the Fullers appealed the\n\ngranting of summary judgment in favor of the City and police officers and the denial of their motion for\nreconsideration.\nAfter the Fullers filed their notice of appeal, Appellees brought a motion to dismiss based on a variety of\njurisdictional grounds. Appellees asserted that the district court's Rule 54(b) certification was invalid because the\ncourt failed to make any specific findings as to why there was \"no just reason for delay.\" Appellees also argued\nthat the Fullers' appeal was premature because the district court never entered judgment on its order on a\nseparate document as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 58. Finally, Appellees maintained that even if the parties could be\ndeemed to have waived the separate document requirement, the Fullers' appeal of the summary judgment order\nwas untimely under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 4(a). A motions panel of this court denied Appellees'\nmotion and granted them leave to file a late appellees' brief.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nA district court's denial of a motion for reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) is construed as a denial of relief\nunder Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). As such, it will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. Fiester v. Turner, 783\nF.2d 1474, 1475-76 (9th Cir.1986).\nWe review the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the City and officers de novo. Kruso v.\nInternational Telephone & Telegraph Corp., 872 F.2d 1416, 1421 (9th Cir.1989). We must determine, viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any genuine issues of material\nfact, and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law. Tzung v. State Farm Fire and\nCasualty Co., 873 F.2d 1338, 1339-40 (9th Cir.1989); Judie v. Hamilton, 872 F.2d 919, 920 (9th Cir.1989).\nDISCUSSION\nI. Jurisdiction\nWhile we give deference to motions panel decisions made in the course of the same appeal, we have an\nindependent duty to decide whether we have jurisdiction. Schlegel v. Bebout, 841 F.2d 937, 941 (9th Cir.1988). In\nthis case, we agree with the motions panel ruling.\nThe district court's Rule 54(b) certification order does not amount to a jurisdictional defect simply because the\ncourt did not include specific findings regarding the appropriateness of the certification. See Rutman Wine Co. v.\nE. & J. Gallo Winery, 829 F.2d 729, 732 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1987). While a separately entered judgment is not a\nprerequisite to appellate jurisdiction, such a judgment is in any case waived where, as here, parties fail to timely\n[4]\nobject to the appeal on that ground. Allah v. Superior Court, 871 F.2d 887, 890 and n. 1 (9th Cir.1989).\nII. The Motion For Reconsideration\nOn May 15, 1989, two months after the district court issued its summary judgment order, the Fullers brought a\nmotion for reconsideration \"under the local rules,\" claiming that neither party addressed the issue of probable\n1442 cause, and that there was *1442 a \"`manifest showing ... of a failure to consider material facts'\" regarding the\n[5]\nFullers' arrest.  The district court denied the motion without stating its reasons.\nAlthough the Fullers never indicated which Federal Rule of Civil Procedure governed their motion, a motion for\nreconsideration of summary judgment is appropriately brought under either Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b). Taylor v.\nKnapp, 871 F.2d 803, 805 (9th Cir.1989),cert. denied,493 U.S. 868, 110 S.Ct. 192, 107 L.Ed.2d 146 (1989).\nTreating the motion for reconsideration as one brought under Rule 59(e), the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying the motion, because the Fullers presented no arguments which the court had not already\nconsidered and rejected. See Taylor at 805. While it is true that the Fullers did not specifically address the issue\n\nof probable cause in their original opposition to Appellees' summary judgment motion, their discussion of the\nqualified immunity doctrine, as explained below, covered the same factual issues.\nThe motion was also properly denied if brought pursuant to Rule 60(b), which provides for reconsideration only\nupon a showing of (1) mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence; (3) fraud; (4) a\nvoid judgment; (5) a satisfied or discharged judgment; or (6) \"extraordinary circumstances\" which would justify\nrelief. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b); Backlund v. Barnhart, 778 F.2d 1386, 1388 (9th Cir. 1985). None of these factors was\npresent in this case.\nIII. Summary Judgment on the Warrantless Arrest Issue\nIn making the decision to arrest and search the Fullers, the LAPD officers relied heavily on Kashanian's report\nthat Roshaun and Annise had stolen the ring. The Fullers argue that Kashanian's report alone was insufficient to\nestablish probable cause, and that the officers had a duty to investigate further before arresting them. They\nemphasize that Kashanian never said he actually saw them take the ring, and that he testified at his deposition\nthat he told police he merely \"had a feeling\" the Fullers had stolen it. The Fullers also maintain there is no\nevidence that Roshaun ever touched the ring. Finally, the Fullers argue that the officers should have made further\ninquiry before arresting them without a warrant.\nThe Fullers cite various discrepancies between Kashanian's report to the police and his deposition testimony,\nincluding the fact that:\n1) The report only mentions two rings, while Kashanian testified that three rings were involved.\n2) The report indicates that Allen requested ring No. 2 and made a deposit on it, while Kashanian\ntestified that Annise made the request.\n3) While the report indicates that Kashanian was the last person to deal with the Fullers before\nthey left, Kashanian later testified that the owner, \"M.G.,\" was the last person to have contact with\nthem.\nThe Fullers argue that these discrepancies amount to genuine issues of material fact regarding the existence of\nprobable cause and qualified immunity that must be resolved by a jury, thereby precluding summary judgment.\nWe conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees on the arrest issue.\nWe do not reach the question whether the officers had probable cause to arrest because we hold that they were\nentitled to qualified immunity with respect to that issue.\n1443 Government officials performing discretionary functions are entitled to qualified *1443 immunity from damages if\ntheir conduct does not violate \"`clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\nwould have known.'\" Thorsted v. Kelly, 858 F.2d 571, 573 (9th Cir.1988), quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The doctrine of qualified immunity does not require that\nprobable cause to arrest exist. Even absent probable cause, qualified immunity is available if a reasonable police\nofficer could have believed that his or her conduct was lawful, in light of clearly established law and the\ninformation the searching officers possessed. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039,\n97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987).\nThus, even if the officers were mistaken that probable cause to arrest the Fullers existed, they are nonetheless\n[6]\nimmune from liability if their mistake was reasonable. Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039. The critical\ninquiry before us, therefore, is whether a reasonable police officer could have believed that his or her conduct\nwas lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information he or she possessed at the time. Id.\nThe purpose of qualified immunity is to \"avoid excessive disruption of government and permit the resolution of\nmany insubstantial claims on summary judgment.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738,\n73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). We have previously held that on a motion for summary judgment, where the evidence is\nundisputed, a district court may establish that a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. See\n\nThorsted v. Kelly, 858 F.2d 571, 575 (9th Cir. 1988). However, \"when there are triable issues of fact of a\nreasonable belief that a search is lawful, viewed in light of the settled nature of the law, these issues are for the\njury.\" Id. at 575. See also Bilbrey v. Brown, 738 F.2d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir. 1984).\n[7]\nHere the material facts are not in dispute.  The officers were told by Kashanian that the Fullers had handled the\nmissing ring before leaving the store and that no one else in the store had the ring. In addition, they learned from\nthe woman in the rest room that Annise Fuller had run into the rest room and asked everyone to exit, and that she\nappeared to be attempting to make herself throw up 00 conduct consistent with an attempt to dispose of the ring.\n97\nIn support of their argument that the officers should have conducted a further investigation, the Fullers cite \nMerriman v. Walton, 856 F.2d 1333 (9th Cir.1988),cert. denied, 491 U.S. 905, 109 S.Ct. 3188, 105 L.Ed.2d 696\n(1989), in which we concluded that police officers had a duty to inquire further before arresting an individual for\nkidnapping. The arrestee, Scott Merriman, brought a civil rights action after police arrested him, without a\n1444 warrant, for kidnapping his girlfriend, Wendy. The arresting *1444 officer acted on a report by Wendy's half-\nbrother that Wendy might have been kidnapped. The brother told police he had received a phone call from a\nfriend of Wendy's who had seen Merriman force Wendy into his car. At the time of the arrest, Wendy had returned\nhome, but the officer had not interviewed her. Merriman himself had contacted and cooperated with the police.\nThe arresting officer brought a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that he was entitled to qualified\nimmunity as a matter of law. The district court denied the motion, and on appeal, we affirmed. We concluded that\nthe officer was not entitled to qualified immunity because a \"reasonable police officer would have made further\ninquiry before effecting a warrantless arrest.\" Id. at 1335. See also Hutchinson v. Grant, 796 F.2d 288 (9th\nCir.1986) (police officer who mistook arrestee for a burglary suspect with the same name was not entitled to\nsummary judgment in connection with arrest where he took no steps to verify the arrestee's identity before\narresting him).\nThe Fullers argue that the police officers in this case should have made further inquiry before arresting them.\nSpecifically, the Fullers contend that the officers should have interviewed \"M.G.,\" the jewelry store owner who\n[8]\nwas, according to the Fullers, the last person to see Annise Fuller with the ring.\nAppellees contend that a reasonable police officer need not have made any further inquiry before arresting the\nFullers, because officers are entitled to rely on detailed reports by honest citizens such as Kashanian in\ndetermining whether probable cause to arrest exists. See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 233-34, 103 S.Ct. 2317,\n2329-30, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). Appellees also emphasize that \"information coming from private citizens who\nare witnesses to or victims of a criminal act is presumed reliable\" under California law, see People v. Kershaw,\n147 Cal.App.3d 750, 755, 195 Cal.Rptr. 311 (1983), and that where, as here, the citizen informant is the victim of\nthe crime in question, the report is entitled to even greater weight. See, e.g., Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143,\n147, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972). This is especially true, Appellees argue, because if\nKashanian's report had been false, he would have been subject to criminal liability. See Cal.Penal Code 148.5(a).\nWe decline to adopt Appellees' argument that merely because citizen witnesses are presumptively reliable, the\nofficers in this situation had no duty to examine further the basis of the witness' knowledge or talk with any other\nwitnesses. We agree with the California Supreme Court that the general proposition that private citizen witnesses\nor crime victims are presumed reliable does not \"dispense with the requirement that the informant ... furnish\nunderlying facts sufficiently detailed to cause a reasonable person to believe a crime had been committed and\nthe named suspect was the perpetrator.\" People v. Ramey, 16 Cal.3d 263, 269, 127 Cal.Rptr. 629, 545 P.2d 1333\n(1976),cert. denied,429 U.S. 929, 97 S.Ct. 335, 50 L.Ed.2d 299 (1976).\nNevertheless, in this case the officers did not rely solely on the uncorroborated testimony of a citizen witness\nbefore arresting the Fullers. After interviewing Kashanian, the officers investigated further by questioning: (1) a\nsecond store employee, who confirmed that the Fullers were the last people to be seen with the ring; (2) the\nwitness who allegedly saw Annise attempting to vomit in the rest room; and (3) the Fullers and their companion.\nThus, while we agree with the Fullers that the police officers had a duty to conduct an investigation into the basis\nof the witness' report, see Merriman, 856 F.2d at 1335, we hold that the officers conducted a sufficient\ninvestigation here. Based on all of the information they obtained, the officers could have reasonably believed that\n\n1445 there was probable cause to arrest the Fullers. *1445 Accordingly, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity\nfor the arrest.\nIV. Summary Judgment On The Visual Body Cavity Inspection Issue\nThe Fullers maintain that the strip and body cavity searches conducted by Officer Barham at the LAPD central\nstation violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches. They contend that the searches\nwere conducted pursuant to the LAPD's blanket policy then in effect which required a routine strip and body\ncavity search of all felony arrestees. Appellees argue that the searches were legal because they were conducted\npursuant to a lawful arrest, and were justified by the officer's individualized suspicion that the Fullers were\nharboring contraband 00 that is, a stolen ring.\n97\nAs we have previously observed, \"[t]he intrusiveness of a body cavity search cannot be overstated.\" Kennedy v.\nLos Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 711 (9th Cir.1989). Strip searches that involve the visual exploration of\nbody cavities are \"dehumanizing and humiliating.\" Id. In Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d\n447 (1979), the landmark case dealing with strip searches of prison inmates, Justice Marshall commented that\nvisual body cavity searches \"represent one of the most grievous offenses against personal dignity and common\ndecency.\" Id. at 576-77, 99 S.Ct. at 1893 (Marshall, J., dissenting). See also Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723\nF.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983) (finding few exercises of state authority that intrude on citizens' privacy and dignity\nas severely as visual anal and genital searches). With these observations in mind, we turn to the question of the\nconstitutionality of the visual body cavity searches performed by LAPD Officer Judy Barham on Annise and\nRoshaun Fuller.\nA. The LAPD Strip Search Policy\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 561, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1885, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court held that\nstrip and visual body cavity searches may, in certain instances, be conducted on prisoners and pretrial detainees\nin institutional settings with less than probable cause. In determining whether an institutional search policy is\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, a court must balance \"the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. In each case, a court must\nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it,\nand the place in which it is conducted. Id.\nIn Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir.1990) (as amended), we applied the Wolfish test\nto the LAPD's blanket policy of performing strip and body cavity searches on all felony arrestees, and found the\npolicy unconstitutional. The plaintiff in the case, Karen Kennedy, was arrested for grand theft after a dispute with\nher roommate over possession of a television set, which Kennedy intended to hold as security for money the\nroommate owed her. After her arrest, Kennedy was taken to jail and forced to submit to a body cavity search\npursuant to the LAPD strip search policy.\nKennedy later brought a civil rights action against the LAPD and two of its officers. The jury determined that the\ndepartment's strip search policy violated Kennedy's constitutional rights, and awarded Kennedy damages. In\naddition, United States District Judge Stephen V. Wilson held that the policy of conducting a visual body cavity\nsearch of all felony arrestees, regardless of any reasonable suspicion, violated the Fourth Amendment. Kennedy\nv. Los Angeles Police Dept., 667 F.Supp. 697 (C.D.Cal.1987).\nOn appeal, we affirmed, and held that the blanket policy could not withstand constitutional review under Wolfish.\nJudge Hall, writing for our court, emphasized that visual body cavity searches are \"dehumanizing and\nhumiliating,\" and that their intrusiveness \"cannot be overstated.\" Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 711. In light of the\nintrusiveness of such searches, we concluded that the LAPD failed to offer any serious justification for routinely\n1446 performing them on all felony arrestees; instead, the *1446 LAPD relied on \"improper assumptions and societal\njudgments\" about individuals who have been arrested. Id. at 713. We noted, however, that a body cavity search\ncould be justified where officials had \"reasonable suspicion\" to conduct a particular search. Id. at 715.\n\nApplying Kennedy, it is clear that the visual body cavity inspection cannot be justified based on the blanket strip-\nsearch policy. However, this does not end our inquiry. As we observed in Kennedy, \"a search, although not\nsupportable under an institutional policy, is not per se unconstitutional.\" 901 F.2d at 702. The fundamental\nquestion under the fourth amendment is whether \"the grounds for a search ... satisfy objective standards\" of\nreasonableness. Torres v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465, 471, 99 S.Ct. 2425, 2429, 61 L.Ed.2d 1\n(1979) (emphasis added). Quite apart from the blanket policy, the appellees offer two justifications for the visual\nbody cavity inspection. First, appellees argue that the inspection was authorized as a search incident to arrest. \nSee United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). Second, appellees maintain\nthat the search was justified by the officer's \"individual suspicion\" that the arrestees were hiding the missing ring\nin a body cavity. We examine each of these rationales in turn.\nB. Search Incident To Arrest\nIn Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), the Supreme Court ruled that a\npolice officer may lawfully search an individual incident to a lawful arrest to discover and seize the fruits or\nevidence of crime. In United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 476, 3 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973), the\nCourt held that the scope of a search incident to arrest includes a \"full search of the person,\" and that such a\nsearch is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment even without a warrant. Appellees argue that under Chimel\nand Robinson, the body cavity search of the Fullers, conducted pursuant to lawful arrest to discover a missing\nring, amounted to a \"full search\" that was both reasonable and lawful.\nWe rejected this very argument in Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 616 (9th Cir.1984),cert. denied,471 U.S.\n1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985). In Giles we held that the \"full search\" authorized by Robinson was\nlimited to a pat-down and an examination of the arrestee's pockets, and did not extend to \"a strip search or bodily\nintrusion.\" 746 F.2d at 616. While Giles involved a misdemeanor and the present case concerns a felony, this\ndistinction is of no consequence. The holding of Giles was that Robinson simply did not authorize the kind of\nsearch at issue in this case. See also Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983) (noting that \nRobinson \"simply did not contemplate the significantly greater intrusions\" involved in strip and visual body cavity\nsearches). Therefore, the visual body cavity inspection was not justified as a search incident to arrest.\nC. Search Conducted With Reasonable Suspicion\nWe explained in Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, that while the LAPD's general practice of\nperforming strip and visual body cavity searches on all felony arrestees without considering the crime charged\nand the circumstances surrounding the arrest was unconstitutional under Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct.\n1861, a visual body cavity search of a particular detainee for contraband or weapons may still be justified where a\npolice officer has reasonable suspicion to conduct such a search. Id. at 714-15.\nWe first adopted the reasonable suspicion standard for such searches in Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, where\nwe held that arrestees charged with minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials possess\na reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband. Id. at 617. Reasonable\nsuspicion may be based on factors such as the nature of the offense, the arrestee's appearance and conduct,\nand any prior arrest record. Id.\n1447 *1447 In Kennedy, we applied the Giles standard and concluded that the police officer had no reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that Karen Kennedy was concealing dangerous contraband, and that the body cavity search\nwas therefore unjustified. As Judge Hall explained:\nThe grand theft charge here centered around an ordinary disagreement between two roommates.\nNo weapons, no drugs, no contraband, no violent acts of any kind were involved. Nor were there\nany other circumstances that provided reasonable suspicion to believe that Kennedy concealed\ncontraband.\nKennedy at 716.\n\nAppellees argue that in this case, the body cavity searches of the Fullers were justified because the\ncircumstances surrounding their arrest provided grounds for reasonable suspicion that one of the suspects\nconcealed \"contraband\" 00 namely, the ring which they were accused of stealing.\n97\nAppellees' argument, however, ignores the fundamental principle embodied in the Supreme Court's holding in \nWolfish and reiterated in our holdings in Kennedy and Giles. The clearly-stated rationale underlying those\ndecisions, which allow body cavity searches of prisoners and detainees on less than probable cause, is to protect\nprisons and jails from smuggled weapons, drugs or other contraband which pose a threat to the safety and\nsecurity of penal institutions. See, e.g., Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884 (noting that a detention facility\n\"is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers\" and that prisoner strip searches were justified by\n\"balancing the significant security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates\"); \nKennedy, 901 F.2d at 712-14 (citing the problems inherent in maintaining prison security and noting that the\nexigencies of a prison setting demanded a departure from the traditional probable cause analysis); Giles, 746\nF.2d at 617 (holding that the county jail's blanket policy of strip searching all arrestees was not necessary to\nprotect institutional security); Tribble v. Gardner, 860 F.2d 321, 325-326 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that digital rectal\nsearches of prison inmates which were unrelated to security considerations would violate the Fourth\nAmendment).\nOther courts reviewing the legality of institutional strip searches have also concluded that intrusive detainee\nsearches are valid only when justified by institutional security concerns. See, e.g., Watt v. City of Richardson\nPolice Dept., 849 F.2d 195, 198 (5th Cir.1988) (concluding it was reasonable for police to strip search arrestees\nwhere their offenses \"posed the very threat of violence by weapons or contraband drugs that they must curtail in\nprisons\"); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 800 (2d Cir.1986),cert. denied,483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97\nL.Ed.2d 762 (1987); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1271 (7th Cir.1983); Holton v. Mohon, 684\nF.Supp. 1407, 1415 (N.D.Tex.1987) (purpose of strip and body cavity search is to look for weapons or contraband\nto protect inmates as well as jail personnel).\nThese decisions suggest that strip and body cavity searches of detainees may be conducted based on\nreasonable suspicion only where such searches are necessary to protect the overriding security needs of the\ninstitution 00 that is, where officials have a reasonable suspicion that a particular detainee harbors weapons or\n97\ndangerous contraband.\nIn this case, however, Appellees never contended that the search of the Fullers was necessary to maintain jail\nsecurity. In fact, Appellees emphatically denied that the search was conducted pursuant to the LAPD policy of\nstrip searching felony arrestees to discover hidden weapons or contraband which posed a threat to the security of\nthe jail. Instead, Appellees maintain that Officer Barham conducted the body cavity searches \"in order to discover\nand seize the fruits or evidence of crime\" 00 that is, the missing ring. Appellees have offered no evidence that the\n97\n[9]\nring itself posed any threat to the safety of other detainees, or to the security of the jail.\n1448 *1448 Moreover, there is no evidence that the Fullers were ever even incarcerated with the general jail population\nwhile being detained at the LAPD central station. In determining the constitutionality of strip searches of\narrestees, courts have distinguished between searches of detainees who were simply awaiting bail, and searches\nconducted on inmates admitted or about to be admitted to the general jail population. In Dobrowolskyj v.\nJefferson County, 823 F.2d 955 (6th Cir.1987), for instance, the Sixth Circuit upheld the strip search of a detainee\nin a county jail after finding that he \"was not searched until he was about to be moved into contact with the\ngeneral jail population.\" Id. at 958. The detainee was initially placed in a holding cell and subjected only to a \"pat\ndown\" search, but was later moved to the general jail area and strip searched. The court ruled that the county's\n\"more narrowly drawn policy\" of strip searching only those detainees intermingled with the inmate population had\n\"a less intrusive impact on the privacy interests of all detainees than a broader blanket search policy.\" Id. at 959.\nThe court noted that:\nThe security interests of the jail in conducting a search at this point were strong. Dobrowolskyj\nwas about to come into direct contact with the general jail population, including prisoners who\nwould then be moved into all sections of the jail. The jail had legitimate interests in preventing the\nflow of contraband into the other sections of the jail.\n\nId.\nThe court contrasted Dobrowolskyj's situation from the one presented in Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084 (6th\nCir.1983), where the detainee remained alone in an individual cell overnight and did not come into contact with\nthe general jail population. Dobrowolskyj at 958. See also Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1254 (6th Cir.1989)\n(fact that detainee was intermingled with other inmates has never alone been found to justify a strip search\nwithout considering the nature of the offense and whether the detainee might attempt to introduce weapons or\ncontraband into the institution); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir.1981) (finding strip search of\ndetainee unconstitutional where, among other things, detainee was never intermingled with the general jail\npopulation).\nHere, it is unclear whether the Fullers were ever intermingled with the general jail population while they were at\n[10]\nthe central station.  Indeed, the record is silent as to where the Fullers were held, how long they were held, or\nwhether they ever came into contact with other inmates. What is clear is that Appellees have offered no evidence\nwhich suggests that the body cavity searches of the Fullers were conducted to further jail security.\nTherefore, the rationale underlying Wolfish and Kennedy 00 which only allows strip searches of detainees with\n97\nless than probable cause where the objective is to discover weapons or contraband 00 does not apply to the\n97\ninstant case. We see no reason to extend the reasonable suspicion standard to body cavity searches for ordinary\nstolen property. Such an extension would be inconsistent with basic fourth amendment principles. In Schmerber\nv. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), the Supreme Court held that in order for the\npolice to draw blood from a defendant arrested for drunk driving, there must be, at the least, probable cause to\nbelieve that the blood test will reveal the presence of alcohol. The defendant in Schmerber, like the Fullers, was\nalready lawfully in custody when the police decided to conduct the \"search.\" The Court explained the relevant\nprinciple as follows:\n1449 The interests in human dignity and privacy which the Fourth Amendment protects *1449 forbid any\nsuch intrusions on the mere chance that desired evidence might be obtained. In the absence of a\nclear indication that in fact such evidence will be found, these fundamental human interests\nrequire law officers to suffer the risk that such evidence may disappear unless there is an\nimmediate search.\nId. at 769-70, 86 S.Ct. at 1835.\nIn our view, Schmerber governs all searches that invade the interior of the body 00 whether by a needle that\n97\n[11]\npunctures the skin or a visual intrusion into a body cavity.  \"The interests in human dignity and privacy\"\ninvaded when a public official peers inside a person's body cavity are at least as great as those invaded by a\nneedle piercing the skin. Therefore, a body cavity inspection cannot be justified by a lesser standard than that\napplied in Schmerber for a blood test.\nThe defendants would have us rule that the \"clear indication\" described in Schmerber refers to a standard less\nthan probable cause. This view has been expressly rejected by the Supreme Court. In a border detention case,\nthe Court stated that the \"clear indication\" language in Schmerber was \"used to indicate the necessity for\nparticularized suspicion that the evidence sought might be found within the body of the individual, rather than as\nenunciating still a third Fourth Amendment threshold between `reasonable suspicion' and `probable cause'.\" \nUnited States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 540, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 3310, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985). In\nshort, the \"clear indication\" language does not refer to a level of suspicion. Indeed, Schmerber itself makes clear\nthat the level of suspicion required for a search into the interior of a person's body is (at least outside the prison\nsecurity and border entry contexts), probable cause.\nAlthough the Court did not expressly state in Schmerber that probable cause is required for a search into the\ninterior of a person's body, this principle is implicit in the holding. After finding that there was probable cause to\nadminister the blood test, the Court went on to discuss the warrant requirement, stating:\n\nAlthough the facts which established probable cause to arrest in this case also suggested the\nrequired relevance and likely success of a test of petitioner's blood for alcohol, the question\nremains whether the arresting officer was permitted to draw these inferences himself, or was\nrequired instead to procure a warrant before proceeding with the test. Search warrants are\nordinarily required for searches of dwellings, and absent an emergency, no less could be required\nwhere intrusions into the human body are concerned.\n384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. at 1835. By the terms of the fourth amendment, a warrant may only issue \"upon\nprobable cause.\" In asking whether a warrant was required to search the interior of a person's body the Court\ntook for granted that probable cause was required. The probable cause requirement was a necessary component\nof the warrant inquiry. We therefore hold that 00 absent the circumstances justifying body cavity searches for\n97\nweapons or dangerous contraband on reasonable suspicion in the jail context 00 an arrestee may only be\n97\nsubjected to such a search if there is probable cause to believe that he has secreted the item sought in a body\ncavity.\nMoreover, the police were also required to obtain a warrant before conducting the body cavity searches. In \nSchmerber, the Court noted that the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement applied\nbecause during the time it would take to procure a warrant, the evidence of the defendant's intoxication would be\n1450 eliminated from his bloodstream. 384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. at 1835. But the Court made clear *1450 that absent\n[12]\nsuch an \"emergency\" a warrant would have been required. Id.\nIn the present case, we need not decide whether Officer Barham had probable cause to believe that Annise or\nRoshaun was hiding a stolen ring in her body, because the body cavity searches were not administered pursuant\nto a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate, and because no exigent circumstances existed. There was no risk\nthat the ring, if hidden in a body cavity, would have been discarded or destroyed. See, e.g., Bouse v. Bussey, 573\nF.2d 548 (9th Cir.1977) (invalidating the forced taking of a sample of inmate's pubic hair without a warrant where\nthere was no danger that the evidence might be destroyed before a warrant could be obtained). In a custodial\nsetting, the police could have easily guarded against the possibility that one of the Fullers would remove the ring\nfrom a body cavity by observing them while a warrant was obtained. Nor was the ring likely to pose any health\nrisk to an individual secreting it within her body. In sum, there were no exigent circumstances to excuse the\nfailure to obtain a warrant.\nWe conclude that the warrantless visual body cavity inspections were unconstitutional. We now must consider\nwhether the district court erred in finding Officer Barham was entitled to qualified immunity.\nD. Qualified Immunity\nOfficer Barham would enjoy qualified immunity from liability in connection with the body cavity searches of the\nFullers if a reasonable police officer could have believed the searches were lawful, in light of clearly established\nlaw and the information the officer possessed at the time. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at\n3039.\nAppellees point out that the Fullers were arrested and searched on February 21, 1987, six months before the\ndistrict court declared the LAPD blanket strip search policy unconstitutional in Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police\nDept., 667 F.Supp. 697 (C.D.Cal.1987). Appellees maintain that based on the law as it existed at the time of the\nsearch, Officer Barham reasonably could have believed that any strip search of a felony arrestee was lawful, and\nthat officers had no reason to anticipate the court's ruling to the contrary in Kennedy. In the alternative, Appellees\nargue that if any showing was necessary to justify the search, all that was required was an individualized\nsuspicion that the arrestees were carrying or concealing contraband.\nGiven the state of the law regarding institutional strip search policies in 1987, it can hardly be said that a\nreasonable police officer could have believed that any strip search conducted pursuant to felony arrest was\nlawful. In 1984, in Giles, for instance, we clearly stated that body cavity searches of minor offense arrestees were\n\nnot justified by arrest alone, and that such searches could only be conducted if jail officials possessed a\nreasonable suspicion that an arrestee was concealing contraband. See Giles, 746 F.2d at 614.\nIn 1986, in Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329 (9th Cir.1986),cert. denied,483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct.\n3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987), we reiterated that a blanket policy subjecting all minor offense arrestees to body\ncavity searches was unconstitutional, and held that the sheriff under whom such searches were performed was\nnot entitled to qualified immunity. We determined that even prior to Giles, the law was sufficiently clear at the time\nof the search to subject the sheriff to liability under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, if the policy proved unreasonable upon\nremand. Ward at 1333.\nBoth Giles and Ward held before the searches in this case were conducted that arrest alone was insufficient to\n1451 justify a body cavity search, and that such searches were lawful only if an officer had an individualized *1451\nsuspicion that a person was carrying or concealing contraband. Although Giles and Ward dealt with arrestees\ncharged with minor offenses, the reasoning in those cases applies equally to the present situation. The Fullers\nwere arrested for shoplifting a ring; they did not use coercion, violence, or weapons of any kind. See Kennedy at\n716. At the time of the body cavity searches, their mere status as arrestees was, as stated in Giles and Ward,\ninsufficient to justify a body cavity search without some reason to suspect they were actually harboring\ncontraband.\nAlternatively, Appellees maintain that given the circumstances surrounding the Fullers' arrest, a reasonable police\nofficer could have believed that either Annise or Roshaun was concealing the missing ring within her body, and\nthat a body cavity search was lawful.\nWe question whether in this situation, a reasonable police officer could have formed a reasonable suspicion that\none of the Fullers had secreted contraband in a body cavity. After leaving the jewelry store, the Fullers did not\nattempt to flee the scene. Rather, they continued shopping, and later returned to the area to eat. The Fullers'\nbehavior suggests that they did not anticipate their arrest. Unlike drug smugglers crossing the border, who know\nthey may be subject to a thorough search, see, e.g., United States v. Aman, 624 F.2d 911 (9th Cir.1980), the\nFullers would have had no motive to conceal the ring within their bodies after leaving the store. See also Giles at\n617 (an arrestee's confinement in county jail is an unplanned event, such that strip search policy \"could not\npossibly deter arrestees from carrying contraband\"). In addition, it appears that the Fullers were not out of the\nsight of other witnesses at any time after Kashanian confronted them, leaving them little opportunity to secrete\nthe ring in a body cavity.\nMoreover, as explained above, the case law at the time the searches took place suggested that a reasonable\nsuspicion by the officer that the Fullers were harboring a stolen ring was not enough to justify visual body cavity\nsearches where there was no evidence that the object sought posed any threat to jail security.\nNevertheless, we are not prepared to say that the rule we make explicit today 00 in particular, the warrant\n97\nrequirement 00 was clearly established at the time of the searches in question. The rationale underlying the\n97\ndecisions in Wolfish, Giles and Ward plainly evinced an overriding concern for maintaining the safety and security\nof penal institutions. The language appearing in those opinions, however, suggested that a body cavity search\ncould be justified if the official had reasonable suspicion that an arrestee was hiding \"contraband\" of any sort. \nSee, e.g., Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884 (concluding that body cavity searches of prisoners were\njustified to guard against \"smuggling of money drugs, weapons, and other contraband\"); Giles, 746 F.2d at 617\n(limiting body cavity searches to situations where jail officials have a reasonable suspicion that an arrestee is\n\"carrying or concealing contraband\").\nBefore a right may be found to be clearly established, the \"contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a\nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640, 107\nS.Ct. at 3039. We do not believe that a reasonable police officer would have necessarily understood at the time\nshe conducted the body cavity searches of the Fullers that the searches violated the Fullers' Fourth Amendment\nrights. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that Officer Barham was entitled to\nqualified immunity in connection with the body cavity searches.\n\nV. The City's Liability\nAccording to Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2036, 56 L.Ed.2d 611\n(1978), a municipality is liable for damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 when \"action pursuant to official municipal\npolicy of some nature caused a constitutional tort.\" The Fullers maintain that the City is liable for damages under \n1452 Monell because the searches at issue here were conducted pursuant to the City's *1452 policy of strip searching\nall felony arrestees.\nThe LAPD strip search policy is unconstitutional on its face. Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713-14. Moreover, as we noted\nabove, the body cavity search of the Fullers was unconstitutional because the warrant requirement was neither\nsatisfied nor excused by exigent circumstances. However, we cannot decide at this stage in the proceedings (as\nexplained in Section IV, supra) whether the search was conducted pursuant to the blanket policy, or whether it\nwas performed because of the officer's individualized belief that the Fullers were harboring contraband. Nor can\nwe decide whether, if the latter is the case, Officer Barham was acting pursuant to an LAPD policy or custom of\nconducting visual body cavity inspections in order to detect stolen property without probable cause and/or without\na warrant. The district court thus erred in granting summary judgment on this issue.\nWe therefore remand this matter to the district court to allow the trier of fact to determine whether the police\nofficer conducting the searches was in fact following an LAPD policy. If so, the City is liable for any damages the\nFullers may have sustained as a result.\nVI. Conclusion\nWe affirm the district court's ruling that the police officers who arrested the Fullers are entitled to qualified\nimmunity in connection with the arrest.\nOn the issue of the strip and visual body cavity searches, however, we reverse the grant of summary judgment in\nfavor of Appellees. We conclude that genuine issues of material fact remain in dispute regarding the police\nofficer's purpose in conducting the searches, which bear directly on the City's liability.\nIf the searches were conducted pursuant to the LAPD blanket strip search policy, the searches constituted a\nviolation of the Fullers' Fourth Amendment rights, and the City is liable to the Fullers for any resulting damages.\nWe therefore remand to the trier of fact for a determination of the police officer's motivation in conducting the\nsearches.\nIn regard to the police officer's liability in conducting the searches, we conclude that the visual body cavity\nsearches, if conducted to detect evidence of alleged shoplifting, were not justified by felony arrest alone. We hold\nthat searches conducted in such circumstances must be supported by probable cause to believe that the arrestee\nis harboring evidence of a crime within his or her body, and require a warrant unless exigent circumstances are\npresent.\nNonetheless, we conclude that a reasonable police officer could have believed at the time the Fullers were\nsearched that the searches were lawful. We therefore hold that the officer conducting the searches in this case is\nentitled to qualified immunity.\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. Each party to bear its own costs.\nCYNTHIA HOLCOMB HALL, Circuit Judge, concurring:\nThis case presents us with three substantive issues: First, whether summary judgment was properly granted in\nfavor of Officers Liggett, Parga, and Barham on the Fullers' claim that these officers unlawfully arrested them;\nsecond, whether summary judgment was properly granted in favor of Officer Barham on the Fullers' claims that\nOfficer Barham unlawfully subjected them to a visual body cavity search (\"strip search\"); third, whether summary\njudgment was properly granted in favor of the City of Los Angeles on the Fullers' claims that they were unlawfully\n\nstrip searched pursuant to city policy. Although I agree with the majority's ultimate resolution of each of these\nissues, I disagree with portions of its analysis. Accordingly, I write separately.\nI\nThe majority correctly concludes that qualified immunity shields officers Liggett, Parga, and Barham from liability\n1453 for the arrest of the Fullers. However, the majority's analysis is seriously flawed. In determining *1453 whether\nreasonable officers in the arresting officers' positions could have believed that they had probable cause to\nexecute a warrantless arrest, the majority asks whether the arresting officers fulfilled their \"duty to investigate\"\nbefore arresting the Fullers. In its analysis, the majority subtly promulgates the rigid rule that arresting officers\nhave a \"duty to conduct an investigation into the basis of\" an eyewitness report before making an arrest that is\nfounded on the report. Ante at 1444. The majority erroneously recognized an independent \"duty to investigate\" as\na vehicle for promulgating police procedures.\nIt is clearly established that the presence or absence of probable cause is a fact-specific, practical inquiry that\nturns on the \"totality of the circumstances.\" Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76\nL.Ed.2d 527 (1983); United States v. Lindsey, 877 F.2d 777, 781 (9th Cir.1989). \"Rigid legal rules are ill-suited to\nan area of such diversity.\" Gates, 462 U.S. at 232, 103 S.Ct. at 2329. It is equally well established that qualified\nimmunity applies if a reasonable police officer could have believed that his or her conduct was lawful, in light of\nclearly established law and the information the officers possessed. Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641,\n107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); Thorsted v. Kelly, 858 F.2d 571, 573 (9th Cir.1988); Merriman v.\nWalton, 856 F.2d 1333, 1335 (9th Cir.1988),cert. denied, 491 U.S. 905, 109 S.Ct. 3188, 105 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989).\nThus, to decide whether the arresting officers have qualified immunity we should consider only whether in the\n\"totality of the circumstances\" known to the arresting officers, these officers reasonably could have thought that\nthey possessed probable cause to arrest the Fullers. See Creighton, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039; \nThorsted, 858 F.2d at 573; Merriman, 856 F.2d at 1335.\nWe have never recognized, as the majority purports to recognize, a \"duty to investigate\" component of this\nprobable cause inquiry. The majority's sole support for its \"duty to investigate\" is Merriman v. Walton, 856 F.2d\n1333 (9th Cir.1988),cert. denied, 491 U.S. 905, 109 S.Ct. 3188, 105 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989). However, the majority's\nreliance on Merriman is completely misplaced. Indeed, in Merriman we closely analyzed the information known to\nthe arresting officer in order to decide what we considered to be the key question: \"Whether a reasonable police\nofficer, knowing what [the arresting officer] knew, could have believed there was probable cause for Merriman's\nwarrantless arrest. . . . Probable cause is determined by applying a `totality-of-the-circumstances' analysis\" Id. at\n[1]\n1335.  Given what the officer knew, we held that there was not enough information to support probable cause,\nand stated that \"[a] reasonable police officer would have made further inquiry before effecting a warrantless\narrest.\" The majority mistakenly relies on this statement because it was nothing more than an offhanded\nadmonishment. Id. Obviously, when the evidence does not support a finding of probable cause, the logical\nresponse is to say that the officers should have inquired further. In short, the majority's view that Merriman\ncreates an independent \"duty to investigate\" is baseless, and is inconsistent with both Ninth Circuit and Supreme\nCourt precedent.\nEven though the majority erroneously dwells on its \"duty to investigate,\" the majority correctly concludes that in\nthe instant case the arresting officers are entitled to qualified immunity. In light of the \"totality of the\ncircumstances,\" which are adequately described in the majority opinion, \"a reasonable police officer, knowing\nwhat [the arresting officers] knew, could have believed there was probable cause for [the Fullers'] warrantless\narrest.\" Merriman, 856 F.2d at 1335; see also Creighton, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039.\nII\n1454 The second major question before us is whether Officer Barham is entitled to qualified *1454 immunity from the\nFullers' claim that she unlawfully subjected them to a strip search. The majority has correctly described the\nstandards against which evidentiary strip searches are measured: such searches must be justified by probable\n\ncause, and a warrant must be obtained prior to the search in the absence of exigent circumstances. The majority\nalso correctly concludes that this standard was not clearly established at the time that the instant strip searches\ntook place. Thus, I agree with the majority's conclusion that Officer Barham is entitled to qualified immunity for the\nstrip searches. See Creighton, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039; The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) v. United\nStates, 870 F.2d 518, 526 (9th Cir.1989); Conner v. City of Santa Ana, 897 F.2d 1487, 1492 (9th Cir.) (holding\nthat the law was clearly established), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 59, 112 L.Ed.2d 34 (1990).\nUnfortunately, the majority goes considerably further than is necessary. The majority not only discerns the\nrelevant standard, but the majority goes on to apply this standard to the facts of the instant case. This latter step\nis simply unnecessary. As the majority itself concludes, the probable cause/warrant standard was not \"clearly\nestablished\" at the time of the searches in issue, and as a result Officer Barham is entitled to immunity. See \nCreighton, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039.\nMoreover, it is worth stressing that the probable cause/warrant standard that we recognize today operates in a\nvery limited sphere. Officer Barham's search for the ring is evaluated under the probable cause/warrant standard\nonly because the search cannot be justified by reference to the security needs of a detention facility; the\ndefendants have admitted that there was no reason to suspect that the Fullers were harboring drugs, weapons,\nor other contraband that would have posed a security threat to the facilities at which the Fullers were detained. If\nthe circumstances surrounding a strip search do justify a reasonable suspicion that a suspect is harboring\ncontraband that will pose a security threat to a detention facility, then the search is constitutionally valid. See \nKennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 712, 715-16 (9th Cir.1990) (holding that strip searches of\nfelony suspects are permissible if justified by a reasonable suspicion that drugs or weapons are being smuggled\ninto a detention facility; no warrant is required); Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329, 1332-1333 (9th Cir.\n1986) (holding that prison security related searches of misdemeanor arrestees are justified by reasonable\nsuspicion that the arrestees have weapons or contraband on their persons), cert. denied sub nom, Duffy v. Ward,\n483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir.1984)\n(holding that, in light of the jail's need for security, strip searches of person arrested for a minor traffic offenses\nare valid if undertaken on the basis of \"reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or concealing\ncontraband\"), cert. denied,471 U.S. 1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985).\nIII\nThe final issue in this case is whether summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the City of Los\nAngeles. While I agree with the majority that this case should be remanded in order for Los Angeles' liability to be\ndetermined at trial, the majority's analysis is incomplete in one respect and overbroad in another.\nA municipality is liable under Section 1983 only if \"action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature\ncaused a constitutional tort.\" Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2036,\n56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); see also City of Canton, Ohio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1205, 103\nL.Ed.2d 412 (1989). Thus, in order for Los Angeles to be liable for the actions of its officers three conditions must\nbe established: First, there must be a constitutionally infirm municipal policy in issue; second, this municipal\npolicy must have been applied to plaintiff; third, application of this policy must have resulted in the deprivation of\n1455 a constitutional right. See id. Although the majority's treatment of the *1455 first and second Monell conditions is\ngenerally adequate, the majority's casual onesentence discussion of the third Monell condition is inadequate. We\nmust determine whether the Fullers' Fourth Amendment interest in freedom from unreasonable searches was\nviolated in this case by the application of the City's facially invalid strip search policy.\nThe application of a facially unconstitutional search policy to an individual does not establish a \"per se\"\nconstitutional violation. See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 715. For the Constitution forbids only objectively\n\"unreasonable\" searches. See U.S. Const. amend. IV; Torres v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465,\n471, 99 S.Ct. 2425, 2429, 61 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979) (\"the grounds for a search must satisfy objective standards\"). If in\nthe circumstances of a particular case a search is objectively reasonable, there is no constitutional violation.\nThus, in order to decide whether the Fullers were deprived of their right to be free of unreasonable searches, we\n\nmust determine whether the searches in issue were justified by probable cause, and whether exigent\n[2]\ncircumstances rendered a warrant unnecessary. See Part II, supra.\nProbable cause does not require certainty. Rather, \"[t]his court must make a `practical, common-sense decision'\nwhether under the `totality of the circumstances' known to [Officer Barham] at the time . . . there was a `fair\nprobability' that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found. . . .\" Lindsey, 877 F.2d at 780 (quoting Gates,\n462 U.S. at 238-39, 103 S.Ct. at 2332 (1983)).\nContrary to the majority's intimations, there was probable cause to strip search the Fullers. The offense for which\nthe Fullers were arrested was theft of a small but valuable object, a ring. Obviously, a ring may easily be\nconcealed in a body cavity. Officer Barham had received an eyewitness report that the Fullers had taken the ring,\nand interviews with other witnesses at the scene confirmed this eyewitness report. One of the Fullers could have\nsecreted the ring in a body cavity during the interval between the time they left the jewelry store and the time that\nthey were fingered by the store keeper. During this period the Fullers were unobserved. Or the Fullers might have\nsecreted the ring in a body cavity during the substantial confusion that ensued after the store keeper accused\n[3]\nthem of stealing it.  Further, searches in the areas which the Fullers were known to have lingered did not turn\nup the ring, and these areas were searched before the Fullers were subjected to the strip searches. In these\ncircumstances, there was a \"fair probability\" that the ring would be found if the Fullers were strip searched.\nStill, in order for a warrantless strip search to be valid, the circumstances must establish exigency as well as\nprobable cause. \"Exigent circumstances are defined as `those circumstances that would cause a reasonable\nperson to believe that entry . . . [or other relevant prompt action] was necessary to prevent physical harm to the\nofficers or other persons, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of the suspect, or some other\nconsequence improperly frustrating legitimate law enforcement efforts.'\" Lindsey, 877 F.2d at 780-81 (quoting \nUnited States v. McConney, 728 F.2d 1195, 1199 (9th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied,469 U.S. 824, 105 S.Ct. 101,\n83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984)). We have recognized that exigent circumstances may be presented based solely on the\n1456 need to preserve evidence. See United States v. Wulferdinger, 782 F.2d 1473, 1475 (9th Cir.1986); *1456United\nStates v. Hicks, 752 F.2d 379, 384 (9th Cir.1985); United States v. Kunkler, 679 F.2d 187, 190 (9th Cir.1982).\nHowever, the government has the burden of establishing that the searching officers were confronted with exigent\ncircumstances. Lindsey, 877 F.2d at 781.\nIn the instant case, the City of Los Angeles has presented no evidence that it could not monitor the Fullers, who\nwere in custody, or otherwise prevent the Fullers from disposing of the ring. Absent some such presentation, we\ncannot say that exigent circumstances rendered a warrant unnecessary. See Bouse v. Bussey, 573 F.2d 548, 550\n(9th Cir.1977) (holding that exigent circumstances were not presented because there was no danger that the\nevidence would be destroyed). Cf. United States v. Suarez, 902 F.2d 1466, 1468 (9th Cir.1990) (holding that\nexigent circumstances were not presented because the government could have monitored the apartment house\nwhich contained evidence to prevent the evidence's destruction). Thus, Officer Barham's failure to obtain a\nwarrant rendered the strip searches that she conducted on the Fullers constitutionally \"unreasonable.\" As such,\nthe third Monell condition for municipal liability is met. I therefore agree that we must remand this case to the\ndistrict court so that a jury may determine whether the unconstitutional strip searches were conducted pursuant to\nthe City's automatic strip search policy.\nUnfortunately, the majority is not content to have the Fullers win on the basis on which they argued their case.\nThe majority states that there is a material issue of fact as to whether: \"Officer Barham was acting pursuant to an\nLAPD policy or custom of conducting visual body cavity inspections in order to detect stolen property without\nprobable cause and/or without a warrant.\" The Fullers have never argued that they were searched pursuant to\nany such municipal policy. And it is well established that a district court will not be reversed on a ground not\nraised before it. See Image Technical Service, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak, 903 F.2d 612, 615 n. 1 (9th Cir.1990)\n(holding that plaintiff's failure to raise an issue in opposition to a defendant's motion for summary judgment\nwaived the issue), cert. granted, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 2823, 115 L.Ed.2d 994 (1991); United States v. Munoz,\n746 F.2d 1389, 1390 (9th Cir.1984) (refusing to consider a tort theory not raised below in a contract action). Thus,\non remand the Fullers should be limited to arguing, as they have throughout this litigation, that they were strip\nsearched pursuant to the City's automatic strip search policy.\n\nWith these reservations, I concur.\n[1] Roshaun claims that she was menstruating at the time, and that Barham required her to remove her sanitary\nnapkin for inspection. The City and officers dispute this.\n[2] Although the LAPD's strip search policy on its face appears to distinguish between a skin search and a visual\nbody cavity search, we previously determined in Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 710-711\n(9th Cir. 1989) (as amended), that in practice, the searches are routinely conducted together and are considered\n\"`one and the same.'\"\n[3] On May 26, 1989, the district court granted the Fullers' motion for summary judgment against the County in\nconnection with the strip searches conducted by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department personnel. The court\nconcluded that the searches could not be justified by the County's strip search policy, were not supported by\nreasonable suspicion, and, therefore, violated the Fullers' Fourth Amendment rights. That part of the action has\nbeen settled, and the legality of those searches is not before us.\n[4] We also reject Defendants' argument that the Fullers' appeal of the summary judgment order is untimely\nunder Fed.R.App.P. 4(a). Although the Fullers did not file their appeal until June 15, 1989 (more than 30 days\nafter the district court issued its summary judgment order on March 8, 1989), the district court did not order\njudgment to be entered on the summary judgment order until June 8, 1989, the same day the court denied the\nFullers' motion for reconsideration. The Fullers notice of appeal was thus timely as to both the granting of\nsummary judgment in favor of Defendants and the denial of the motion for reconsideration.\n[5] Rule 7.16 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court, Central District, upon which the Fullers\napparently based their motion, provides in part: \nA motion for reconsideration of the decision on any motion may be made only on the grounds of ...\n(c) a manifest showing of a failure to consider material facts presented to the Court before such decision. No\nmotion for reconsideration shall in any manner repeat any oral or written argument made in support of or in\nopposition to the original motion.\n[6] It is unclear the extent to which the district court considered the issue of probable cause in granting summary\njudgment for Appellees. In their cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties focused on the issue of\nqualified immunity, and did not discuss probable cause. Nonetheless, the district court concluded that the officers\nhad \"reasonable cause\" to arrest the Fullers for grand theft, and that, in any event, the officers were entitled to\nqualified immunity in connection with both the arrest and strip search.\n[7] The Fullers maintain that other factual discrepancies surrounding their arrest precluded summary judgment,\nincluding: \n1) the differences between their version of the incident and the other witnesses' reports, and\n2) the differences between Kashanian's testimony in his deposition and in the police report.\nWe conclude that these minor discrepancies are immaterial and do not negate the officers' reasonable belief that\nprobable cause existed to arrest the Fullers for theft. The fact that Kashanian stated in his deposition that he \"had\na feeling\" the Fullers took the ring is immaterial because he firmly conveyed to the officers his sincere belief that\nthe Fullers took the ring, and described the underlying facts which formed the basis of his belief. He also stated in\nhis deposition that he had no doubt that Annise stole the ring. The minor discrepancy regarding the number of\nrings the Fullers examined was attributable to Kashanian's excitement and language difficulties, and in any case\nis immaterial.\n[8] Defendants maintain that although \"M.G.\" did talk to the Fullers, Kashanian, not \"M.G.,\" was the last person to\nsee the stolen ring.\n\n[9] Not only is it apparent that a ring is not dangerous contraband; it would appear that it is not contraband at all.\nThere is no reason to believe that a ring is the type of property that it is illegal to bring into a prison.\n[10]\nAlthough the record establishes that the Fullers were later transported to the Los Angeles County Sybil Brand\nInstitute, where they were again subjected to strip and body cavity searches and incarcerated for twelve hours\npending arraignment, that aspect of the Fullers' action, as we noted previously, has been settled and is not before\nus.\n[11] We are aware of the First Circuit's opinion to the contrary, see United States v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296 (1st\nCir.1975). In Klein, the court ruled that a strip and visual body cavity search of the defendant, who was arrested\nfor distribution of cocaine, was not governed by Schmerber because there was \"no piercing or probing of Klein's\nskin, nor forced entry beyond the surface of his body.\" Id. at 300. Our court has not followed Klein in limiting \nSchmerber's restrictions on \"intrusions into the body\" to cases in which skin is pierced or entry is forced. See \nGiles, 746 F.2d at 616.\n[12] At least two state courts to have considered the question have held that a warrant is required for a body\ncavity search of an arrestee. See State v. Whitley, 65 Hawaii 486, 654 P.2d 354 (1982); State v. Fontenot, 383\nSo.2d 365 (La.1980). A leading authority on the subject discusses Whitley and Fontenot without citing any state\ncases that reach a contrary conclusion. See generally W. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise ยง 5.3(c)\n(1987).\n[1] Merriman had been arrested for kidnapping. The arresting officer knew, inter alia, \"that Merriman . . . was [the\nalleged victim's] long-time boyfriend . . . [and that] the alleged victim of the kidnapping had returned.\" Id. We\nconcluded that \"[u]nder these circumstances, there is no probable cause.\" Id.\n[2] Although the majority fails to make this inquiry, the majority's views on the matter are clearly indicated by the\nmajority's conclusion, made in the course of its qualified immunity analysis, that Officer Barham violated the\nFullers' Fourth Amendment rights when she strip searched them.\n[3] The majority asserts that the Fullers had no opportunity to hide the ring in a body cavity after being confronted\nby the store keeper because \"it appears that the Fullers were not out of the sight of other witnesses at any time\nafter Kashanian confronted them. . . .\" Ante at 1451. This assertion is misleading. While the Fullers were\ngenerally in public areas during this period, they certainly were not under any surveillance.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
