    "summary": "<p>In 1981, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Bonneville County Sheriff, the County, and the County Commissioners, in the United States District Court for the District of Idaho.  Plaintiff, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief, claiming that that she was strip searched in violation of her fourth amendment rights and that Defendants' blanket policy to strip search all people booked into the county jail for minor offenses was unconstitutional.</p><p>The parties stipulated that on October 26, 1981, a Sheriff's Deputy stopped Plaintiff for an expired vehicle registration.  The officer arrested Plaintiff for an arrest warrant because of outstanding parking tickets.  The officer did not frisk Plaintiff or inspect her purse.  Plaintiff was taken to the Bonneville County Jail, where she was booked because she could not post bond.  Plaintiff was strip-searched because jail policy required that all persons booked into the jail be strip-searched.  Although the jail policy required a visual examination of body cavities, the officer only conducted a skin search of Plaintiff because the officer did not suspect that she was concealing contraband. </p><p>On February 9, 1983, the District Court (Chief Judge Marion J. Callister) entered summary judgment for Defendants.  The Court held Defendant's strip search policy was constitutional in order to provide jail security.  Furthermore, a jail policy giving officials discretion would result in claims of unequal treatment.  Additionally, legislation taking effect on March 1, 1983 decriminalized many traffic offenses.  Giles v. Ackerman, 559 F.Supp. 226 (D. Idaho 1983).  Plaintiff appealed.</p><p>On November 2, 1984, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Chief Judge James R. Browning and Judges Procter Hug, Jr. and Thomas Tang) reversed and held: (1) arrestees for minor offenses can only be strip-searched if jail officials have reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing contraband, and (2) Plaintiff's strip search was unconstitutional because there officers did not suspect that she was concealing contraband or threatening jail security.  Plaintiff's offense was minor and did not relate to drugs or weapons, and she had no prior record.  Furthermore, the Court found that there was minimal evidence of smuggling activity at the Bonneville County Jail.  Additionally, the policy did not deter arrestees from carrying contraband because arrestees do not plan on being arrested.  On appeal, Plaintiff asked that her claim for injunctive relief be dismissed.  The Court remanded Plaintiff's claim for declaratory relief.  Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984).</p><p>On April 22, 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Defendants' petition for writ of certiorari.  Ackerman v. Giles, 471 U.S. 1053 (1985).</p><p>Docket Number: 81-4151</p><p></p>",

Idaho.\nFebruary 9, 1983.\nHopkins, French, Crockett & Springer, Larry L. Goins, Idaho Falls, Idaho, American Civil Liberties Union, Stephen\nL. Pevar, Denver, Colo., for plaintiff.\nLund & Associates, Lynn J. Lund, Salt Lake City, Utah, Fanning & Radin, John Radin, Idaho Falls, Idaho, for\ndefendants.\nMEMORANDUM DECISION\nCALLISTER, Chief Judge.\nBefore the Court are cross-motions for summary judgment regarding plaintiff's claim of deprivation of\nconstitutional rights arising out of the strip search conducted by Bonneville County Sheriff's employees on\nOctober 26, 1981. Plaintiff's complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to fully explain bail procedures\nfollowing her arrest, but that issue is not addressed by the present motions.\nThe plaintiff in this action is a young, married woman. The gist of her complaint is that, when arrested pursuant to\na warrant for failure to appear and pay parking tickets, Bonneville County authorities failed to adequately explain\nbonding procedures and conducted a strip search. The parties have stipulated to certain facts which have been\nfiled of record. The parties have not asserted any material issues of fact involving the search of the plaintiff, and\nthe Court finds, as the record reflects, that none exist. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).\nThe starting point in any Fourth Amendment analysis is the standard of reasonableness. \"The essential purpose\nof the proscriptions in the Fourth Amendment is to impose a standard of `reasonableness' upon the exercise of\ndiscretion by government officials, including law enforcement agents ....\" Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648,\n653-54, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1395-96, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979).\nThe United States Supreme Court, in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1976), stated\n[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nIn Bell, the court further observed that\n227 *227 [a] detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers. Smuggling of\nmoney, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence. And inmate\nattempts to secrete these items into the facility by concealing them in body cavities are\ndocumented in this record, and in other cases.... That there has been only one instance where an\nMCC inmate was discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the institution on his person\nmay be more a testament to the effectiveness of this search technique as a deterrent than to any\n\nlack of interest on the part of the inmates to secrete and import such items when the opportunity\narises.\nWe do not underestimate the degree to which these searches may invade the personal privacy of\ninmates. Nor do we doubt, as the District Court noted, that on occasion a security guard may\nconduct the search in an abusive fashion. Such abuse cannot be condoned. The searches must\nbe conducted in a reasonable manner. But we deal here with the question whether visual body-\ncavity inspections as contemplated by the MCC rules can ever be conducted on less than\nprobable cause. Balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against\nthe privacy interests of the inmates, we conclude that they can.\nId., at 559-60, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85 (citations omitted).\nThe federal courts have at times sustained strip searches as a matter of routine, see, e.g., Inmates of Allegheny\nCty. Jail v. Pierce, 612 F.2d 754 (3rd Cir.1979); United States v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296 (1st Cir.1975); United States\nv. Bradford, 496 F.Supp. 366 (D.Conn.1980),aff'd645 F.2d 115 (2nd Cir. 1981); Armstrong v. Borie, 494 F.Supp.\n902 (E.D.Pa.1980), and at other times have limited strip searches as a matter of routine. Often, the courts have\nruled that the manner in which a strip search is conducted renders the search constitutionally impermissible.\nIn Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981)cert. denied,455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653\n(1982), cited by the plaintiff, the court noted that the strip search was conducted in an improper manner because\nit was conducted in a place open to the view of people who might be passing by the window of the room where\nthe search occurred. In Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wis.1979), also cited by plaintiff, the district court\nthere felt that, under all the circumstances, the search of non-misdemeanor defendants charged with traffic\noffenses who were incarcerated because they could not post bond was not justified without some probable cause\nto believe that the arrestees might have weapons or contraband on their person. The court did not discuss the\nsecurity problems of the jail or the problems facing the officers who managed the jail, but only the problems with\nthe manner of the strip searches.\nIn this case, the plaintiff has not argued that the manner in which she was searched was unreasonable. No\nsearch was conducted until it was determined that the plaintiff did not intend to make bond, and that she would\nbe entering the perimeter of the jail until her case came up for hearing. The Court notes that the search here did\nnot include a cavity search and that issue is not before the Court; that the search was conducted in privacy and\nthat there was no touching of the individual; and that every reasonable courtesy was extended to the plaintiff.\nThe Court recognizes that it is customary in this state, on all minor traffic violations, to permit the violator to sign\nthe citation in agreement to appear at the time specified, and be released upon that signature. The Court also\nrecognizes it is the practice to give those who are arrested on minor petty offenses the opportunity to post bond\nin a reasonable amount before they are processed or searched with regard to incarceration in the jail. In fact,\nIdaho has adopted a uniform bail schedule for misdemeanor offenses. Idaho Misdemeanor Criminal R. 13.\n228 *228 The Court recognizes the unusual conditions of this case. The plaintiff was arrested on a warrant for failure\nto pay parking ticket violations. Plaintiff maintains that she was unaware that the tickets had been issued because\nher husband, who was driving the car at the time, allowed them to accumulate and neglected to pay them.\nTherefore, the Court views these circumstances as unusual, and they tend to arouse the sympathy of the Court\nas well as others concerned with this matter.\nNevertheless, there are other very serious considerations. Courts have long recognized the special dangers\nassociated with jail and prison environments, even when faced with significant Fourth Amendment issues. As\nnoted above, the Supreme Court has observed that \"[a] detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious\nsecurity dangers.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Other courts\nhave observed likewise and concluded that strip searches may reasonably assist in minimizing these dangers.\n\"Jail authorities may reasonably act so as to exclude contraband from the jail environment.\" Inmates of Allegheny\nCounty Jail v. Pierce, 612 F.2d 754, 761 (3rd Cir.1979).\n[W]e find no basis for agreeing ... that the brief strip search ... conducted without abuse and in a\nprofessional manner was unconstitutional. A post-arrest search of the person ... may include\n\nrequiring a suspect to remove his clothes and a visual inspection of his person. [citations omitted]\n... If such procedures were not permissible, it would often be difficult to conduct a thorough search\nfor weapons and contraband.\"\nUnited States v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296, 300 (1st Cir.1975). The court in Klein further concluded that \"[t]he modesty\nof one lawfully arrested must give way to reasonable precautionary procedures designed to detect hidden\nevidence, drugs, or objects which might be used against others or to cause self-inflicted harm.\" 522 F.2d at\n300-01. See Armstrong v. Borie, 494 F.Supp. 902, 905 (E.D.Pa.1980). In addition to the danger of drugs or\ncontraband in a jail setting, jailers also face the possible problem of communicable diseases being spread in the\ninstitution.\nIn order to provide for jail security and safety, the Bonneville County Sheriff instituted a policy of strip searching\nevery person processed into the general jail population area. The necessity of providing jail security is obvious. A\nweapon of any kind in the hands of an inmate can be a serious threat to other inmates, to the guards and jail\npersonnel, and, in the event of an escape, to the general public. It is likewise true that placing a person with a\nserious communicable disease in close proximity to others in the crowded conditions of a jail can cause serious\nproblems to inmates as well as to jail personnel. The presence of drugs in the jail may result in uncontrollable\nbehavior by the user, thus presenting a danger to all others in the jail area.\nThe Court recognizes the chaotic situation which could result were the jail to adopt a policy of leaving the\ndecision to strip search totally in the discretion of jail personnel. In a jail which processes approximately 4,000\npeople each year, such a procedure would certainly result in multiple litigation arising out of claims of unequal\ntreatment of prisoners.\nPlaintiff argues that strip searches of many traffic offenders are not justified by the need for jail security. This\nargument assumes that all traffic offenders are otherwise law-abiding people. The Court is of the opinion that\narrested traffic offenders, as a group, could include people who have communicable diseases, people who use\ndrugs and might be carrying them in concealed areas on their body, or people who use weapons and might be\ncarrying them on their body. Traffic offenders cover the whole gamut of society. When it is necessary to arrest\ntraffic offenders, and they must therefore enter the perimeter of the jail because they cannot make bond, it\nappears to this Court that the security of the jail requires that these persons be searched just as any other\narrestee.\n229 In reaching a decision on this issue, the Court also recognizes the right of the other *229 inmates in the jail to be\nprotected from any danger that might result from an improper search allowing contraband of weapons or drugs,\nor communicable disease into the jail.\nPerhaps the issue would be best resolved by legislatively imposed standards rather than judicial intervention into\njails and prisons. Legislative bodies could pursue these matters after adequate investigation and debate,\nconsidering all aspects of the problem, unlike the Court which is limited to the matters in the record.\nThe Court notes that, although the law was not effective at the time this arrest and search occurred, Idaho\nrecently enacted legislation which reduces the likelihood of arrest for many traffic violations. In 1982, the Idaho\nlegislature passed the Idaho Traffic Infractions Act which creates a new classification of offense for many traffic\nviolations. Idaho Code §§ 49-3401 to -3412 (effective March 1, 1983). The Act defines an infraction as \"a civil\npublic offense, not constituting a crime, which is punishable by a penalty not exceeding one hundred dollars\n($100) and for which no period of incarceration may be imposed.\" Idaho Code 18-111. The Court recognizes that\nthis decriminalization of many traffic offenses should reduce the possibility of arrest and pre-trial incarceration\narising out of such minor offenses.\nWhen all of these matters are considered, the Court is of the opinion that the search in this case did not violate\nthe constitutional rights of the plaintiff. Accordingly, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on that\nissue.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The search was conducted pursuant to\na jail policy requiring that all persons booked into the jail be strip searched. The officer who searched Giles had\nno individualized suspicion that Giles was carrying contraband or that she in any way threatened jail security.\nWe hold that arrestees for minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials have a\nreasonable suspicion that the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or suffering from a\ncommunicable disease. Because no such suspicion existed in Giles's case, the officer who searched Giles\nviolated her rights under the fourth amendment.\nI\nThe parties stipulated to the following facts. Giles was stopped by a sheriff's deputy in Idaho Falls, Idaho because\nher vehicle registration had expired. A routine computer check revealed that an arrest warrant had been issued\n[1]\nfor Giles because of several outstanding parking tickets.  The officer arrested Giles and placed her in the patrol\ncar. He described her as cooperative and neither frisked her nor inspected the purse she carried.\nGiles was taken to the Bonneville County Jail. She waited approximately twenty minutes and was allowed to\nmove freely around the building. During this period, jail officials did not handcuff Giles, frisk her, or subject her to\na pat down search. She was permitted to keep her purse, which was not searched.\nGiles was unable to post a bond immediately because she did not have sufficient cash with her and could not\nreach her husband. She was booked into the jail, and in compliance with county policy she was required to\nremove her clothes and was strip searched. Within a few hours of her arrest, Giles posted bond and was\nreleased.\nGiles brought this action against the sheriff, the county, and the county commissioners (collectively, \"the County\")\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983. She claimed enforcement of the jail policy requiring that all arrestees be strip searched\nhad violated her fourth amendment rights. She sought a declaration that the policy was unconstitutional, an\ninjunction against its continued enforcement, and damages.\n\nAfter considering cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted judgment for the defendants. \nGiles v. Ackerman, 559 F.Supp. 226 (D.Idaho 1983). The court held that the strip search did not violate Giles'\nconstitutional rights. We reverse.\nII\nSection 501.03(5) of the jail's Policies and Procedures Manual provides as follows:\n616 *616 The subject will then be placed in the booking cell, and all items and clothing removed, strip\nsearched, and all property receipted for on the arrest record.\nThe policy is applied to all male and female arrestees who are to be placed in the general jail population. Jail\npersonnel are given instructions on the conduct of the search. The instructions require a visual examination of\nbody cavities. In Giles's case, however, the officer did not follow these instructions, but limited her examination to\na skin search. Giles contends the skin search violated her fourth amendment rights. She also claims that the\n[2]\ncavity search policy is unconstitutional on its face.\nThe County argues that the warrantless strip search of Giles was lawful because it was incident to her arrest. It\nrelies on United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973), which held that a \"full\nsearch of the person\" incident to arrest is per se reasonable under the fourth amendment. Id. at 235, 94 S.Ct. at\n477. However, the \"full search\" in that case was limited to a pat down and an examination of Robinson's pockets.\nThe search involved no strip search or bodily intrusion, and nothing in the opinion implies that the court intended\n\"full search\" to include such intrusions. That implication would be inconsistent with Schmerber v. California, 384\nU.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), which held the fourth amendment protected an arrestee's\nprivacy interests and thus barred intrusions into the body \"which are not justified in the circumstances, or which\nare made in an improper manner.\" Id. at 768, 86 S.Ct. at 1834. The taking of a blood sample from Schmerber\nwas not authorized as incident to his arrest, but required independent justification. Schmerber thus implies that\nintrusions into the arrestee's body, including body cavity searches as authorized by the County's policy, are not\nauthorized by arrest alone. See 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment § 5.3(c)\n(1978). Similarly, we see nothing in Robinson or Schmerber that authorizes the somewhat less intrusive strip\nsearch as incident to arrest. Accord Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1271 (7th Cir.1983).\nThe County next contends the policy is authorized by the Supreme Court's decision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S.\n520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In Bell, pretrial detainees housed in a custodial facility challenged a\npolicy requiring all inmates to submit to strip searches following contact visits with persons from outside the\ninstitution. The policy was designed to prevent visitors from smuggling weapons and contraband into the facility.\nThe Court characterized the issue raised by the inmates' challenge to the policy as \"whether visual body cavity\ninspections ... can ever be conducted on less than probable cause.\" Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885 (emphasis in\noriginal). To resolve this issue, the Court balanced the security interests of the institution against the privacy\ninterests of the inmates. \"Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is\nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nApplying those factors, the Court in Bell concluded that a standard less stringent than probable cause could\njustify strip searches or body cavity searches of inmates at a pretrial detention facility. Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at\n1885.\nWe reject the County's contention that Bell signifies that all strip searches are constitutionally acceptable.\nInstead, Bell employed a mode of analysis developed by the Court in Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654, 99\nS.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979):\n617 *617 Thus, the permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged by balancing its\nintrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate\ngovernmental interests. Implemented in this manner, the reasonableness standard usually\nrequires, at a minimum, that the facts upon which an intrusion is based be capable of\n\nmeasurement against \"an objective standard,\" whether this be probable cause or a less stringent\ntest. (Footnotes omitted.)\nWe must therefore balance the security needs of local jail facilities against the privacy interests of arrestees\ncharged with minor offenses to determine what objective standard authorizes strip searching of arrestees. See \nMary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273; Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668, 674 (8th Cir.1982).\nThe parties do not dispute the nature of the intrusion. They agree that Giles's privacy was invaded in a frightening\nand humiliating manner. They also agree that the search was conducted in an appropriate place and \"with all due\ncourtesy.\" At issue is the County's justification for the search policy.\nThe inmates in Bell were charged with offenses more serious than minor traffic violations, and they were\ntherefore detained for substantial pretrial periods. The Court observed that smuggling of drugs, weapons, and\nother contraband into the facility was common. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. The institution's strip\nsearch policy was designed to deter inmates from receiving contraband from visitors. Id.; see also Block v.\nRutherford, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 3231, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984). Officials at the facility had established\nthat smuggling of contraband constituted a serious risk to inmates and employees and had shown the policy was\nan effective deterrent. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nIn contrast, the County has not demonstrated that its security interests warrant the serious invasion of privacy\ninflicted by its policy. The record reveals that the incidence of smuggling activity at the Bonneville County Jail is\nminimal. Evidence before the trial court indicates that of approximately 3,500 persons searched at the jail in the\npreceding 18-month period, only eleven persons had concealed anything that warranted a report, including the\nconcealment of cigarettes. Defendants cite as significant only one discovery in the course of 3,500 strip\nsearches: a knife was found cradled in the small of the back of an arrestee. Defendants also cite two instances\nfrom other parts of the country (California and Mississippi) in which matches were concealed on the person of\ndetainees.\nMoreover, there is no indication whatsoever that the County's strip search policy could or did have any deterrent\neffect. Visitors to the detention facility in Bell could plan their visits and organize their smuggling activities. In\ncontrast, arrest and confinement in the Bonneville County Jail are unplanned events, so the policy could not\npossibly deter arrestees from carrying contraband.\nWe acknowledge the difficult security problems present in some local jail facilities. We recognize also that we are\nnot free to substitute our views on proper jail administration for that of the jails' actual administrators. Block, 104\nS.Ct. at 3232. We conclude, however, that strip searching of every arrestee booked into the Bonneville County\nJail is not necessary to protect the institution's security interest. Balancing that interest against the privacy\ninterests of arrestees, we hold that arrestees charged with minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only\nif jail officials possess a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband.\nReasonable suspicion may be based on such factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee's appearance and\nconduct, and the prior arrest record. See generally Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273; Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d\n1007, 1013 (4th Cir.1981),cert. denied,455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982); Hunt v. Polk\n618 County, 551 F.Supp. 339, 342-45 (S.D.Iowa 1982); Smith v. Montgomery County,*618 547 F.Supp. 592, 598-99\n(D.Md.1982); Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 490-91 (E.D.Wis.1979),aff'd.620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980).\nThis more limited use of strip searches will protect the privacy interests of arrestees who pose no security threat\nto the facility, but will enable jail officials to identify and search those who may pose such a risk. Of course, the\nCounty remains free to enhance its security by implementation of procedures that are less intrusive than strip\nsearches, including the use of pat down searches and metal detectors and the segregation of inmates to isolate\narrestees for minor offenses from the general jail population.\nApplying this standard to Giles's claims, we hold the search violated her rights under the fourth amendment. No\nsuspicion existed that Giles was carrying contraband. Her offense was minor and was related neither to drugs nor\nto weapons. She had no prior record. Both the arresting officer and the officer who conducted the search\nindicated Giles was cooperative and orderly. The officer who strip searched Giles stated she would not have\nconducted the search had the policy not required it, and she limited the scope of the search because Giles's\n\n[3]\nappearance and demeanor convinced the officer that no contraband would be found.  Weighing the\nintrusiveness of the strip search against the minimal showing of need we conclude that the indiscriminate search\nof Giles violated her fourth amendment rights.\nLogan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981), applied Bell to a very similar county jail strip search policy and\narrived at the same conclusion. Logan was arrested for drunk driving and for refusal to take a breathalyzer test\nwithout first being allowed to contact her attorney. She was transferred to the detention center where she\nrepeated her request to contact her attorney. In accordance with county policy she was allowed the phone call\nonly after she had been strip searched. The Fourth Circuit held the strip search policy \"conclusively ...\nunconstitutional under the standards laid out in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 [99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447] ....\" \n660 F.2d at 1013. The court continued:\nStrip searches of detainees are constitutionally constrained by due process requirements of\nreasonableness under the circumstances ... Logan's strip search bore no such discernible\nrelationship to security needs at the Detention Center that, when balanced against the ultimate\ninvasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably be thought justified.\nId.\nThe Logan court noted that Logan's offense 00 more serious than that of Giles 00 \"was nevertheless one not\n97 97\ncommonly associated by its very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband; ... when strip-searched\nshe had been at the Detention Center for one and one-half hours without even a pat-down search.\" Id. Although\n619 Giles was placed in the general jail population and Logan was not, another court has correctly pointed out that \n*619 \"[d]efendants' heavy reliance on the intermingling of its temporary detainees with the general [jail]\npopulation is misplaced ...\" because such intermingling is both limited and avoidable. Smith v. Montgomery\nCounty, 547 F.Supp. at 598-99.\nIII\nOur conclusion that Giles's constitutional rights were violated requires us to reverse the summary judgment for\nthe defendants and to remand the case for trial and determination of a remedy. As to the individual defendants,\nthere remain substantial questions of fact to be determined at trial concerning their liability and potential defenses\nof immunity and good faith. As to the County, it is apparent from our holding that the violation of Giles's\nconstitutional rights was a result of a fixed policy of the County. The liability of the County has thus been\nestablished as a matter of law. The remaining questions are the amount of damages to which Giles is entitled and\nwhether injunctive or declaratory relief should be granted.\nGiles's request for injunctive and declaratory relief does not raise the issue of standing considered by the\nSupreme Court in City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). In Lyons\nthe plaintiff's damages claim had been severed from his claim for injunctive relief. 461 U.S. at ___ n. 6, 103 S.Ct.\nat 1667 n. 6. The Court was thus required to consider whether his request for an injunction, standing alone,\npresented a case or controversy. Gonzales v. City of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468, 481-82 (9th Cir.1983). In contrast, it is\nclear that Giles has standing to bring her damages action, and there is no question that a live controversy exists\nbetween her and the County. The only question in her case is whether relief in addition to damages is\nappropriate. See id.\nOn appeal, Giles asks that her claim for injunctive relief be dismissed. However, she continues to seek a\ndeclaratory judgment. Whether declaratory relief is necessary and appropriate to prevent future violations of\nconstitutional rights is a matter to be considered in the first instance by the district court. We therefore remand\nGiles's claim for declaratory relief for consideration in light of the policies expressed in Lyons and Gonzales.\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\n[1] Giles indicates that the parking tickets were issued to her husband and that she had no knowledge of them.\n\n[2] As the district court pointed out, it is not necessary to consider whether the County's policy was constitutional\nas applied to body cavity searches since Giles' body cavities were not searched. 559 F.Supp. at 228. However,\nsince we hold that reasonable individualized suspicion is required before a strip search may be lawfully\nconducted, it is obvious that even more intrusive body cavity searches would require no less.\n[3] Officer Shumway testified on deposition as follows: \nQ Would you have strip searched Julie if you were not compelled to by the Policies Manual?\nA If we weren't compelled to, no, I probably would not have. If we'd had a facility which she could have gone in in\nher clothes; if we had that type of facility for people, where they could go in in their own clothing, there would be\nno problem at all.\nQ Okay, I have two questions based on what you just said. Number one, why wouldn't you have strip searched\nher if you didn't have to, what is it about Julie?\nA She was well dressed. She was clean and neat. Her charges weren't the type 00 you know, like I said, if we had\n97\na facility for that type of charge and for the minor people, it would be no problem.\nQ So you consider the nature of the charge in considering whether a strip search is advisable, among other\nconsiderations?\nA This would be the hypothetical thing that I am saying. Not with our policies and procedures it doesn't matter 00\n97\nQ Yes, I understand.\nA But if it were a case of whether you could or you couldn't, I would not have strip searched Julie Giles, no,\nbecause of the charges and from everything considered.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
