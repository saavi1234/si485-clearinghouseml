    "summary": "<p>On May 30, 2000, three Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state common law against the City of Schenectady and five Schenectady police officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.  Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked for compensatory and punitive damages, alleging they were strip-searched pursuant to an unconstitutional city policy in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p><p>On April 1, 1998, Plaintiff C.F. was in front of a store when two defendant officers called him over to their vehicle.  The officers asked what he was doing in the area and where the \"crack\" was.  Plaintiff responded that he did not use or know about crack.  One officer then searched plaintiff's pockets and found marijuana.  Plaintiff was taken to the police station where he was strip-searched.  Plaintiff was kept in a holding cell and released a few hours later.  He alleged that $100 was missing from his belongings.</p><p>On April 28, 1998, a Defendant Officer stopped Plaintiff G. for a traffic violation.  Plaintiff agreed to go to the police station to clear up an \"association hit\" on her name.  Plaintiff alleged she was strip-searched, but Defendants denied strip-searching her.  Plaintiff's fingerprints were then checked, revealing she was not wanted and she was released.</p><p>On May 30, 1999, a Defendant Officer responded to a fight call, arrested Plaintiff M.F., brought him to the police station, and charged him with disorderly conduct.  Plaintiff was issued an appearance ticket and released.  As Plaintiff was leaving the police station, he argued with a police officer.  Officers then grabbed him, returned him to the booking area, and then strip-searched him.  He was then released without additional charges.</p><p>On April 5, 2001, the District Court (Judge Thomas J. McAvoy) denied summary judgment to Defendants and granted summary judgment as to Plaintiff M.F.  The Court held: (1) city policy of strip-searching all detainees violated the Fourth Amendment because strip/body cavity searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanors or other minor offenses were unconstitutional unless officers had reasonable suspicion that arrestee concealed contraband, (2) fact question as to whether Plaintiff G. was strip-searched precluded summary judgment because defendant officer and the police matrons on duty denied strip-searching her, and (3) police did not have reasonable suspicion to strip-search either plaintiff.  The Court granted summary judgment to Plaintiff M.F. because Defendants admitted to strip-searching him and the Court found that Defendants did not have reasonable suspicion to strip-search him.  Plaintiff was not charged with a serious crime and Defendants did not initially strip-search Plaintiff. </p><p>Gonzalez v. City of Schenectady, 141 F.Supp.2d 304 (N.D.N.Y. 2001).</p><p>On May 31, 2001, the District Court (Judge McAvoy) held that the City's policy of strip-searching all non-felony detainees was unconstitutional.</p><p>On September 17, 2001, the District Court (Judge McAvoy) granted summary judgment for Defendants Officer B, Officer S, and City as to Plaintiff C.F.'s post-marijuana discovery detention claims.  The Court granted summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiff's claim that his strip-search was unconstitutional.  The Court found that the marijuana created a reasonable suspicion that Plaintiff concealed additional contraband, justifying the search.  Plaintiff alleged that Defendant S. took $100 frm him, so the Court dismissed this claim as to Officer B.  The Court dismissed Plaintiff's state law claims because Plaintiff did not file within the statute of limitations.</p><p>The Court denied summary judgment for Defendants as to Plaintiff's pre-marijuana discovery Fourth Amendment claims.  The Court found that a reasonable jury could conclude the officers detained Plaintiff for questioning without reasonable suspicion that a crime had occurred or was about to occur, Defendant engaged in procedures more intrusive than necessary under the circumstances, and Defendants seized and searched Plaintiff without probable cause.  Even if Defendants had reasonable suspicion, their search went beyond a permissible pat down of Plaintiff's outer clothing for weapons.</p><p>The Court granted Defendants' motion to sever Plaintiff's claims from the other two Plaintiffs because they involved separate arrests by different officers.  The Court granted Defendant Officer's motion to sever Plaintiff's claims against him from Plaintiff's claims against Defendant City and decided to try these cases back to back in front of one jury.</p><p>Gonzalez v. City of Schenectady, Case: 1:00-cv-0824, 2001 WL 1217224 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2001).</p><p>On April 16, 2002, a jury trial began on Plaintiffs G's and M.F.'s claims.  The jury found for Plaintiffs G. and M.F. on April 22, 2002.  The jury awarded Plaintiff G. $12,500 in actual damages on her Section 1983 and state law claims of an unjustifiable stop.  The jury awarded Plaintiff G. $2,500 on her state common law claim of false arrest arising from being detained and brought to the police station.  The City was liable for the state law damages under respondeat superior.  The jury found for Defendants on Plaintiff G.'s strip search claims.  The jury awarded $75,000 to Plaintiff M.F. in actual damages for his illegal strip search, $2,500 in punitive damages against one Defendant Officer, and $10,000 in punitive damages against Defendant Sergeant under supervisory liability.</p><p>On August 30, 2002, the District Court (Judge McAvoy) dismissed Plaintiff C.F.'s claims against Defendant Officer B.</p><p>On September 4, 2002, at the end of a two-day jury trial, Plaintiff C.F. settled with Defendants Officer S. and City and the District Court (Judge McAvoy) dismissed Plaintiff C.F.'s claims.</p><p>On December 30, 2002, the District Court (Judge McAvoy) granted Defendants' motion for a new trial on the issue of Plaintiff M.F.'s damages unless Plaintiff accepted a remittitur to $40,000 in compensatory damages.  The Court found that the strip search had insufficient effects on Plaintiff's life to justify the jury award.  The Court affirmed Plaintiff's punitive damages award.  Gonzalez v. City of Schenectady, Case: 1:00-cv-0824, 2002 WL 34682538 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 2002).</p><p>On January 13, 2003, Plaintiff M.F. accepted the remittitur to $40,000.</p><p>On April 7, 2003, the District Court (Judge McAvoy) awarded $94,138.83 in attorney fees to Plaintiffs G. and M.F.</p><p></p>",

In conclusion the Court determines as follows: \n     \nIn support of bifurcation, Defendant Barnett makes two  Defendants  City  of  Schenectady  and  Mr.  Barnett’s \narguments.

The case will be tried back to back to one  \t\r  \njury. \n  \n Footnotes \n \n1  At his deposition, Frisbee was asked who made this statement. He responded: “Siler and Barnett, pretty much Siler though.” Plf. \nDep. p. 66. \n \n \n2  The Amended Complaint asserts claims by Mr. Frisbee for false arrest and unlawful search arising from conduct by the City’s \npolice officers on April 1, 1998, April 8, 1998, and July 6, 1998. The Notice of Motion seeks dismissal of all claims by Frisbee \n \nwhereas the attorney affirmation in support of the pending motion explicitly limits the motion to the causes of action arising from \n  8 \n \n\nGonzalez v. City of Schenectady, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2001)   \n \nthe April 1, 1998 arrest. \n \n3  The elements of a cause of action for state common law false arrest are (1) the defendant intended to confine the plaintiff; (2) the \nplaintiff was conscious of the confinement; (3) the plaintiff did not consent to the confinement; and (4) the confinement was not \n \notherwise privileged. See Kirk v. Metropolitan Transp. Auth., 2001 WL 258605,*9 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (citing Weyant v. Okst, 101 F.3d \n845, 853 (2d Cir.1996); Broughton v. State, 37 N.Y.2d 451, 456 (1975)). Because false arrest is a type of false imprisonment, the \ntwo claims have identical elements. See Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, 63 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir.1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. \n1189 (1996). \n \n4  Barnett asserts that on the date in question, he and Siler were on routine patrol in an area of the City “known to [him] to be a \npopular location for drug dealings.” As he approached the corner where the store is located, he observed Frisbee “huddled with \n \nseveral younger black males. Based upon [his] experience, it looked [to him] as if they were engaged in a drug deal. As [the \nofficers] approached, a black gentleman ran into the adjacent store, and Mr. Frisbee began to walk away. Mr. Frisbee’s daughter \nwas not present at the time.” Barnett Aff. ¶ 3. \nAt his deposition, Frisbee said that there were “one or two [known drug houses] on every block” in the area in question; that \nthere were “a lot of [drug] users” in the area where the store is located; but denied that it was known to him as an area where \ndrugs were sold. Frisbee Dep., p. 154–155. Frisbee also states in his deposition that when he approached the store with his \ndaughter and her friend, there were four (4) or five (5) kids within a “half block radius” in front of the store who “scurried ... \nTook off when they seen [the police] pull up.” Frisbee Dep., p. 173–174. He asserts further, however, that he had no \ninvolvement with these individuals. \nBarnett asserts that Siler approached Frisbee and began asking him questions. When Plaintiff was asked about drugs, “he denied \nthat he ha[d] any and said to go ahead and search him.” That is when the police found the marijuana inside a cigarette package. \nBarnett denies taking any money after the strip search. He asserts that the stip search occurred pursuant to the policy of the City. \n \n5  Rule 21 provides: \nMisjoinder of parties is not ground for dismissal of an action. Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on \n \nmotion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just. Any claim against a party \nmay be severed and proceeded with separately. \n \n6  Other Courts have held that the test is: \n  “(1) whether the issues sought to be tried separately are significantly different from one another; (2) \nwhether the severable issues require the testimony of different witnesses and different documentary \nproof; (3) whether the party opposing the severance will be prejudiced if it is granted; and (4) whether \nthe party requesting the severance will be prejudiced if it is not granted.” \nBD ex rel. Jean Doe v. DeBuono, 2000 WL 249115, at *5 (S .D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2000). \n \n7  He argues that the only basis to join the three in the first place is because they all involved a single issue of whether the City’s strip \nsearch policy was unconstitutional. Now that the this issue has been decided against the City, Defendant Barnett argues that the \n \nonly issue left to be tried on the strip search issue is whether each plaintiff has made out a constitutional claim. \n \n8  See City of Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796, 799 (1986) and Pitchell v. Callan, 13 F.3d 545, 549 (2d Cir.1994), both standing \nfor the proposition that it is well-settled that a claim of negligent training or supervision under Monell lies against a municipality \n \nonly where there is a finding of a constitutional violation by one of its officers. \n \n \n \n \t\r  \n \n \n  \n  9 \n ",

This  action came  to trial or  hearing \nbefore  the  Court.  The  issues  have  been  tried  or  heard \nand  a  decision  has  been  rendered. \nIT  IS  ORDERED  AND  ADJUDGED  the  jury  found  in  favor  of  plaintiff \nElizabeth  Gonzalez  against  defendant  Eric  Hesch  and  awarded \nactual  damages  in  the  amount  of  $12,500.00  on  plaintiff's \nSection  1983  and  state  common  law  claims  of  false  arrest \narising  from  her  allegation  of  an  unjustifiable  stop  by \ndefendant  Eric  Hesch.  The  jury  found  no  basis  to  award \npunitive  damages  on  this  claim.  The  City  of  Schenectady  is \nliable  for  that much  of  the  damages  arising  under  the  state \ncommon  law  cause  of  action  under  the  theory  of  respondent \nsuperior. \n\nThe  jury found  in favor of defendant Eric Hesch upon the grounds of \nqualified immunity as to Elizabeth Gonzalez'  Section 1983  claim of \nfalse  arrest  arising  from  her  being  detained  and  brought  to  the \npolice  station. \nThe  jury  found  in  favor  of  plaintiff  Elizabeth  Gonzalez  on  her \nstate  common  law  claim  of  false  arrest  against  defendant  Eric \nHesch  arising  from  her  being  detained  and  brought  to  the  police \nstation.  The  jury awarded plaintiff Gonzalez  compensatory damages \nin the  amount  of  $2,500.00  on  this claim.  The  jury found  no  basis \nto award punitive damages  on this claim.  The City of Schenectady is \nliable for  that much  of the damages  arising under  the  state common \nlaw  cause  of  action under  the  theory  of  respondent  superior. \nThe  jury  found  no  cause  of  action  in  favor  of  the  defendants  on \nplaintiff Gonzalez's  section 1983  illegal strip search and battery \nclaims. \nThe  jury  found  no  cause  of  action  in  favor  of  defendant  Michael \nGlasser on plaintiff Michael  Fyvie's section 1983  and  state common \nlaw  claims  of  false  arrest. \nThe  jury  found  no  cause  of  action  in  favor  of  defendant  Michael \nGlasser  on  plaintiff  Michael  Fyvie's  state  common  law  claim  of \nbattery. \nIn  a  Memorandum,  Decision  and  Order  of  the  Court  dated  April  5, \n2001,  the  Court  ruled  as  a  matter  of  law  that  the  City  of \nSchenectady  had  a  unconstitutional  policy  related  to  strip \nsearching  pre-trial  detainees  charged  with  misdemeanor  and  minor \noffenses,  and that plaintiff  Michael Fyvie had been strip searched \nbased upon  this policy  and  violation  of  his  constitutional  rights \nthereby  entitling  him  to  summary  judgment  on  his  section  1983 \nillegal  strip  search  claim  against  the  city  of  Schenectady.  At \ntrial,  the  Court  determined  as  a  matter  of  law  that  defendants \nMarisela  Mosher  and  Thomas  Mattice  were  also  legally  responsible \nfor any actual damages  that arose from this strip search based upon \ntheir  participation  therein.  The  jury  further  determined  that \ndefendant  William  Lachanski  was  legal  responsible  for  any  actual \ndamages  that  arose  from  the  strip  search  under  a  theory  of \nsupervisory liability.  The  jury found  no cause of action in favor \nof  defendant  Michael  Glasser  on  plaintiff Michael  Fyvie's  section \n1983  illegal  strip  search.  The  jury  awarded  plaintiff  actual \ndamages  in the amount  of  $75,000.00  arising from  his illegal strip \nsearch.  The  jury further awarded plaintiff Michael  Fyvie punitive \ndamages  in  the  amount  of  $2,500.00  against  defendant  Marisela \nMosher  and  $10,000.00  against  defendant  William  Lachanski  on \nplaintiff's illegal strip search claim.  The  jury found  no  basis to \naward  punitive  damages  against  defendant  Thomas  Mattice  on  this \nclaim. \nLAWRE~~E K~J:JAERMAN \nDated:  April  23,  2002 \n_ <  - ~,.....,  i<\"'\"C-  ---\nBy: \n,  ~  ,-. \n- .',- f,.,'  ..... \n\nNOTICE TO LITIGANTS \nFILING NOTICE OF APPEAL \nThis notice is to inform you of the time limitations for filing a Notice of Appeal under Federal \nRules ?f Ap~e~late Procedure 4 (see below) and of the necessity of filing a timely motion for \nextensIOn withm the thirty-day extension period if the Notice of Appeal is untimely. \nLawrence K.

In  a \nseparate  Decision  and  Order  dated  September  14,  2001,  [Dkt.  #  86] \nthe  Court  ermined,  inter alia,  to  sever  the  claims  of  Mr. \nFrisbee  from  the  other  plaintiffs'  claims  pursuant  to  Rule  21  of \nthe  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure. \nThe  cl  of  Plaintiffs  Gonzalez  and  Fyvie  were  tried \ntogether  to  a  jury  in  April,  2002.1  On  p  intiff Michael  Fyvie's \nSection  1983  and  state  common  law  c  of  false  arrest,  the  jury \nfound  no  cause  of  action  in  favor  of  fendant  Michael  Glasser. \nLikewise,  t  jury  found  no  cause  action  in  favor  of  defendant \nMichael  Glasser  on  Fyvie's  state  common  law  aim  of  battery. \nHowever,  as  ed  above,  in  a  Memorandum,  Decision  and  Order \ndated  AprilS,  2001,  the  Court  ruled  as  a  matter  of  law  that  the \nCity  of  Schenectady  had  a  unconstitutional  policy  related  to  strip \nsearching  pre-tr  I  detainees  charged  with  misdemeanor  and  minor \n1 Inasmuch  as  Plaintiff Gonzalez's  jury award  is not  the  subject  of  this \nmotion,  the  jury's determination as  to her  claims  are  not  set  forth  in  this \nDecision  and Order. \n2 \n\noffenses,  and  that  plaintiff Michael  Fyvie  had  been  strip searched \nbased  upon  this  policy  in  violation  of  his  constitutional  rights. \nAt  trial,  the  Court  determined  as  a  matter  of  law  that  defendants \nMarisela  Mosher  and  Thomas  Mattice  were  also  legally  responsib \nfor  any  actual  damages  that  arose  from  this  strip  search  based  upon \ntheir participation  therein.  The  jury  furt  r  determined  that \ndefendant  William  Lachanski  was  legally  responsible  for  any  actual \ndamages  that  arose  from  the  strip  search  under  a  theory  of \nsupervisory  liabil  y.  The  jury  awarded  plaintiff actual  damages \nin  the  amount  of  $75,000.00  arising  from  his  illegal  strip  search, \nand  further  awarded  Fyvie  punitive  damages  in  t  amount  of \n$2,500.00  against  fendant  Ma  sela  Mosher  and  $10,000.00 \nagai~st \ndefendant  William  Lachanski.  The  jury  found  no  basis  to  award \npunitive  damages  against  defendant  Thomas  Mattice  on  this  claim. \nII.  Discussion \nDefendants  now  move  pursuant  to  Rules  50  and  59  of  the  Federal \nRules  of  Civil  Procedure  seeking  judgment  as  a  matter  of  ,  a  new \ntrial,  or  remittitur.  Defendants  focus  their  arguments  exclusively \non  the  damage  awards  obtained  by  pla  iff  Fyvie,  arguing  that  the \ncompensatory  damages  were  excess  and  that  t  punitive  damages \nwere  not  supported  by  the  evidence  at  trial.  Plaintiff  Fyvie \nopposes  the  motion. \n3 \n\n\nA.  Legal  Standards \n1.

Parties'  Arguments  regarding  compensatory  damages \nDefendants  have  cited to  cases  involving  Section  1983  strip \nsearch  claims  performed  pursuant  to  an  unconstitutional  policy  in \n8 \n\n\nwhich:  (1)  the  Second  Circuit  upheld  a  $1  award  of  nominal  damages, \nShain  v.  Ellison,  273  F.3d  56,  67  (2d  Cir.  2001):  (2)  a  jury \nawarded  $19,645  in  compensatory  damages,  Ciraolo  v.  City  of  New \nYork,  216  F.3d  236  (2d  Cir.  2000);  and  (3)  the  United  States \nDist  ct  Court  the  Southern  Dist  ct  of  New  York  ordered \nremittitur  from  the  j  's award  of  $125,000  to  $25,000.  Kelleher \n90  F.Supp.2d  354  (S.D.N.Y.  2000).  Defendants  argue  that \nPlaintiff  Fyvie  has  been  subjected  to  no  greater  emotional  damage \nthan  any  the  other  plaintiffs  subjected  to  a  strip  search  in  t \ncited  cases,  and  therefore  the  award  is  excessive. \nPlainti  argues  that  while  Kelleher  represents  one  end  of  the \nspectrum,  there  are  numerous  cases  which  have  awarded  substantially \nmore  than  awarded  to  Mr.  Fyvie  for  emotional  distress.  Some  the \ncase  cited by  the  plaintiff do  not  deal  with  strip  searches,  see \nSulkowska  v.  City  of  New  York,  129  F.Supp.  2d  274  (S.D.N.Y. \n2001) (in  non-jury  trial,  court  awards  $275,000  for  \"significant \nemotional  injury  which  has  requi  treatment\"  arising  from  false \narrest,  battery,  and  malicious  prosecution  by  police);  Noga  v. \n99-CV-0941  (N.D.N.Y.  2002) (Homer,  M.J.) (jury  awards \n$235,000  from  mainly  emotional  distress  arising  from  false  arrest \nand  mal  ious  prosecution),  while  the  ones  that  do  address  strip \nsearches  are  not  from  this  Circuit.  Joan  W.  v.  City  of \n~, \nChicago,  771  F.2d  1020,  1025  (7  Cir.  1985) (holding  reasonable  a \n$75,000  award  for  a  strip-search  pursuant  to  a  traffic  stop); \n9 \n\nBeth  G.  v.  City  of  Chicago,  723  F.2d  1263,  1276  n.  11  (7th  Cir. \n1983) (giving  a  range  of  $15,000  to  $112,500  in  str  search  cases) . \nC.  Emotional  Distress Damages \nIt  is  well  established  that  courts  may  award  emotional \ndistress  damages  in  section  1983  cases. \n~=-=.-\"<.,  999  F.2d  655,  662  (2d  Cir.  1993).  However,  \"t  mere  fact \nthat  a  constitutional  deprivation  has  occurred  does  not  justify the \naward  of  [compensatory]  damages;  the  plaintiff must  est  ish  that \nshe  an  actual  injury  caused  by  the  deprivation.\" \n310  F.3d  at  55  (citing \nPiphus,  435  U.S.  247,  263-64  (1978)).  Here,  there  is  no  dispute \nthat  P  iff  Fyvie's  damages  derive  wholly  from  the  emotional \nstress  contends  he  suffered  by  being  subjected  to  the \nunconstitutional  strip  search.  Thus,  the  first  question  to  address \nis  whet  r  t  plaintiff has  adequately  supported  s  compensatory \ndamages  award,  or  whether  he  is  entitled to  only  nominal  damages. \nIn  this  rcuit,  a  \"plaintiff's  testimony  of  emotional  injury \nmust  be  substantiated  by  other  evidence  that  such  an  injury \noccur  ,  such  as  the  testimony  of  witnesses  to  t  intiff's \ndistress,  or  the  objective  circumstances  of  the  violation  self.\" \nPatrolmen's  Benevolent  Ass'n.,  310  F.3d  at  55  (citations  omitted). \na  plaintiff has  sought  medical  treatment  for  the \nemotional  injury  is  not  necessarily  required.  (citing  Miner, \n999  F.2d  at  663). \n10 \n\nAt  trial,  plaintiff  offered his  own  subjective  testimony \nregarding  his  emotional  distress  damages,  as  well  as  that  of  his \nfather.  Fyvie  testified that  he  felt  humiliated  by  the  strip \nsearch,  was  embarrassed  to  tell his  parents  the  circumstances,  and \nIt  frightened  to  be  in  public  places  within  the  City  of \nSchenectady  for  r  that  he  would  be  arrested  and  stripped \nsearched  again.  's  father  testified to  the  outwardly  rent \nmanifestations  of  Fyvie's  distress,  including  the  father's \nobservation  that  his  son  became  sullen  uninterested  in \nsocializing with  friends. \nThe  actual  damage  award  is  supported  by  competent  evidence \nthe  nature  that  this  Circuit  has  found  sufficient  to  sustain  some \ncompensatory  damages  arising  from  the  unconstitutional  act. \n;  Annis  v.  County  of  Westchester,  136  F.3d  239,  249  (2d  Cir. \n1998).  Thus,  there  is  no  basis  to  stri  the  actual  damage  awarded \nor  to  impose  only  nominal  damages.  The  more  narrow  question  rai \non  this motion  is  whether  the  amount  of  e  damages  is  excessive. \nD.  Excessiveness  of Actual  Damage  Award \nOne  of  the  more  recent  cases  relied  upon  by  the  plaintiff as \nrepresenting  the  upper  range  of  justifi  emotional  distress \nawards,  99-CV-0941  (N.D.N.Y.  2002) (Homer,  M.J.), \nwas  itself  subjected  to  a  remittitur  decision  decided  after \nplaintiff  submitted  his  papers  on  this  motion.  See  Noga  v.  Potanza, \n11 \n\n\n221  F.Supp.2d  345  (N.D.N.Y.  2002),3  The  Noga  decision  underscores \nthe  fact  that  each  damage  award  must  be  assessed  for  excessiveness \nbased  upon  the  facts  of  the  case,  including  the  particularities  of \nthe  plaintiff  and  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  constitutional \ndeprivation  issue. 4  The  standard  is  whether  the  award  shoc \nthe  judicial  conscience.  This  standard  contemplates  a  we  ing  of \nthe  character  and  strength  of  the  evidence  of  damages  and  the \ne  s  on  the  plaintiff before  the  court.  Other  plaintiff's \nawards  are  only  a  point  of  reference. \nIndeed,  when  addressing  emotional  injuries,  a  comparative \nanalysis  using  other  similar  constitution  violations  has  a  somewhat \nlimited  utility because  the  emotional  impact  of  a  particular \n3 In  Magistrate  Judge  Homer  determined that  the  award  of  $235,000  for \nthe  emotional  distress  arising  from  plaintiff's  false  arrest  and  malicious \nprosecution was  excessive  and  should be  reduced  to  $91,500  upon  acceptance  of  a \nremittitur.  Id.  at  357-59.  The  $91,500  amount  represents  $40,000.00  for  false \narrest  and  $51,500  for malicious  prosecution.  Id.  at  359.  Mr.  Noga  paid his \nattorney  $1,500.00  in attorney's  fees,  and  therefore  it appears  that  the \nadditional  $50,000.00  on  the malicious  prosecution  claim was  for  emotional \ndistress  arising  from  the  prosecution. \n4 AS  Magistrate  Judge  Homer  noted,  Mr.  Noga,  was  born  in  Poland  in 1935  and \nemigrated  to  the  United  States  in  1965,  becoming  a  citizen in  1970.  Id.  at  357. \nOn  the  day  of  his  arrest,  Noga  was  for  a  birthday  for  his  son. \nHe  was  directed to  accompany  a  New  York  State  Police  Officer  to  the  State \nPolice  station where  he  was  photographed,  fingerprinted  and  then  transferred to \nDefendant  Potenza's  custody.  Id.  He  was  placed  in  a  cell  in the  City of \nSchenectady  Jail  and  held  overnight.  Id.  Apparently,  the  cell was  dirty and \nunsanitary,  and  the  constant  noise  in the  jail kept  from  sl  that \nnight.  Id.  at  357-58.  \"During  the  night,  Noga  recalled how  his  father  had  been \narrested  in  Poland  when  Noga  was  twelve  and  held  in custody  for  two  weeks.\"  rd. \nat  358.  Noga  was  released  in the  afternoon  of the  next  day  and,  although \nprosecuted,  made  no  appearances  in court.

He  testified that  he  was  very  distressed by  the  that \nwas  strip  searched  and  that  a  female  matron  was  present  during \nt  search.  Plaintiff  further  testi  ed  that  he  was  humil  and \nembarrassed  by  both  the  strip  search  the  fact  that  he  was  t \nand  insulted by  the  female  during  the  strip  search. \nIn  addressing  a  similar  claim,  Judge  McMahon  in  the \n5 As  Fifth Circuit  Judge  Dennis  noted  in his  concurring  opinion  in Thomas \nTexas  Dept.  of Criminal  Justice,  297  F.3d  361,  376  (5th Cir.  2002) (Dennis,  J., \n),  the  assessment  of  s  for  emotional  distress  is so  fact-driven \nand  so  largely a  matter  of  judgment  derived  from  weighing  the  character and \nof  the  evidence  presented in each  case  that  it does  not  yield itself to \na  son  of  prior written decisions  which  are  devoid  of  the  demeanor  of  the \nwitnessess  and  the  atmospher  of  the  court  room  upon  which  the  jury relied  in \nits verdict.  Id.  (\"Without  more  into the  nature  and  quality of \n[the]  testimony  [from  a  prior case],  ...  [  [u]nless  we  aim  to  create  an \naward  schedule  for  intangible  injuries  like  s,  marital difficulties, \nand  loss  of  prestige,  I  see  no  way  of  whether  a  subsequent  award  is \nexcessive based  on  the  factual  summary  in  [a  prior  case] ./1). \n13 \n\n\ncase  noted  that  the  plaintiff  in  that  case  did  not  produce  any \nevidence  of  medical  treatment  or  other  professional  expenses \nrelated  to  his  claim  of  emotional  distress,  finding  that  \"[tJhe \naward  of  $125,000  is  clearly  excessive  given  the  lack  of \ncorroborating  medical  testimony  concerning  Plaintiff's  emotional \ndistress.\"  Kelleher,  90  F.Supp.2d  at  364.  However,  Judge  McMahon \nnoted  that \nan  unlawful  strip  search,  in  and  of  itself,  is  an \negregious  violation  of  Plaintiff's  constitutional  right \nto  be  free  from  unwarranted  government  intrusion  of  his \nperson.  Moreover,  Plaintiff  testified that  he  was \ntouched  during  the  search  by  Trooper  Fearon,  which  is \ncontrary  to  State  Police  policy  for  conducting  a  strip \nsearch.  I  therefore  cannot  find  that  Plaintiff  is \nentitled to  no  damages. \nAfter  reviewing  other  damage  awards  in  numerous  other  strip \nsearch  cases  in  other  Circuits,  including  the  case  primarily  relied \nupon  by  the  plaintiff  here,  Judge  McMahon  concluded  that  remittitur \nto  $25,000.00  was  in  order.  Id. \nPlaintiff  in  this  case  argues  that  the  presence  of  the  female \ndefendant  during  his  strip  search  together  with  the  insults  and \ntaunting  that  occurred  during  search  constitutes  \"aggravating \ncircumstances\"  such  to  bring  this  case  out  the  realm  of  Kelleher \nand  into  the  realm  of  Joan  w.  v.  City  of  Chicago,  771  F.2d  1020 \n(7th  Cir.  1985).  The  Court  does  not  agree. \nJoan  W.  involved  a  physician  in  her  mid-thirties  practicing  in \nChicago  who  was  arrested  for  a  traffic  violation  on  January  28, \n14 \n\n\n1978.  Joan  W.,  771  F.2d  at  1021.  Pursuant  to  a  C  y  policy  that  was \nsubsequently  decl  unconstitutional  by  the  court,  five  female \npolice  department  employees  (lit  matrons\")  str  searched  her. \nSeventh  Circuit's  decision  scribed  the  procedure  of  the \nsea  ,  the  particulars  of  the  plaintiff,  and  search's \npsychological  impact  on  the  pI  iff.6  After  ewing  the \nrticulars  of  eight  other  cases  from  the  Nort  rn  District  of \nIllinois  which  were  tried before  juries,  the  Court  rever \ndistrict  court  and  remanded  case  with  directions  to  hold  a \nnew  trial  unless  iff accepted  the  entry  of  a  remittitur \nreducing  the  award  from  $112,000  to  $75,000. 7  In  doing  so,  the \n6  In  this  the  Seventh  Circuit  decision  in ~~~~ indicated: \nDuring  the  search,  Joan  was  forced  to  remove  her  clothing  and  to \nexpose  the  and  anal  areas  of  her  body.  The  matrons \nthreatened her  when  she  initially refused to  comply,  used  vulgar \nlanguage,  and  at  her.  Joan  testified that  the  incident \ncaused  her  emotional  distress  that  manifested  itself in  reduced \nsocializing,  poor  work  performance,  paranoia,  suicidal  feelings, \ndepression,  and  an  inability to disrobe  in any place other  than  a \ncloset.  She  introduced evidence  to  show  that  she  was \npeculiarly sensitive  to  the  kind  of  physical  violation she  had \nendured because  she  was  a  private person  who  even  during  school \ngym  classes  could  not  completely disrobe  in  front  of  others and  was \nconscious  of her physical  disabilities  caused by  her  chronic \narthritis. \n771  F.2d  at  1021-22. \n7 In  addressing  the  argument  on  appeal  that  the  award  of  $112,000  for  Joan \nW's  damages  was  excessive,  the  Seventh Circuit  noted that  the  e  test \nwas  \"severe,\"  and  cited the precedent  in  that  circuit that  allowed a  trial  judge \nto vacate  a  jury verdict  for  excessiveness  if it is  \"monstrously \nexcessive\"  or  if there  is  \"no  rational  connection  between  the  evidence  on \nand  the  verdict,\"  and  that  \"appellate  review  is  governed by  the \nextremely limited abuse  of discretion standard.\"  Id.  (citations  omitted).  The \nCourt  then  explained that  the  test,  like  in  New  York,  also  required comparison \nwith  other  similar  cases.  Id. \n15 \n\nSeventh  Circuit  noted  that  the  $112,000  award  was  \"flagrantly \nextravagant  and  out  of  line  with  the  other  strip  search  cases.\"  Id. \nSeventh  Circuit  continued,  stating  that  \"[hlowever \nreprehensible  the  City's  conduct,  the  jury does  not  have  discretion \nto  award  what  are  essent  lly punitive  damages  where  no  punit \ns  are  pled  or  permitted.  Id.  (citing \nIf \nConcerts,  Inc.,  453  U.S.  247  (1981) (munici  lities  are  immune  from \npunitive  damages  in  section  1983  actions)). \nHere,  while  the  plaintiff  and  his  father  did  testify to  the \nemotional  distress  that  arose  for  the  strip  ,  it was  not  of \nthe  magnitude  realized by  the  plaintiff  in  There  was  no \nindication  of  suicidal  thoughts,  poor  work  ormance,  or  other \nial  effects  on  Fyvie's  life beyond  his  humiliation  and \nreduced  socialization.  Further,  unlike  in  or  Noga,  the \ns  of  this  case  do  not  demonstrate  that  ntiff  had  any \nparticular  sensitivity  to  the  kind  of  physical  violation  he \nend~ \nwhich  would  warrant  any  increased damage  awa \nWhile  the  Second  Circuit  has  held  that  emotional  distress \ndamages  can  properly  range  from  $1.00  upwards  to  almost \n$600,000.00,  see  Patrolmen's  Benevolent  Ass'n.,  310  F.3d  at  56,  the \ncla  for  emotional  damages  that  exceed  $40,000.00  involve  either \nlong-term  harassment,  Phillips  v.  Bowen,  278  F.3d  103,  111-12  (2d \nr.  2002),  or  extreme  conduct  causing  severe  emotional  distress. \nHughes  v.  Patrolmen's  Benevolent  Ass'n  of  New  York,  Inc.,  850  F.2d \n16 \n\n\n876,  884  (2d  Cir.  1988).  s  is  not  such  a  case. \nHaving  viewed  the  as  it was  presented,  and  ng  had \nthe  opportunity  to  weigh  and  access  the  character  and  severity \nof  the  plaintiff's damages,  the  Court  is  left  with  the  f \nconviction  that  the  jury's  award  of  $75,000.00  to  the  a  iff  for \nthe  type  and  magnitude  his  emotional  distress  damages  was \nexcessive.  While  the  type  of  search  performed  here  const  s  a \ngreat  human  indecency,S  $75,000  for  the  ensuring  emotional  damages \nrealized  by  this  plaintiff  shocks  the  Court's  conscious.  The  upper \nend  of  the  scale  for  the  t  and  magnitude  of  emotional  distress \ndamages  suffered by  plaintiff  is  $40,000.  Therefore,  the \ndefendants'  motion  for  a  new  t  al  on  the  issue  of  Fyvie's  actual \ndamages  is  granted  unless  les  and  serves  a  written \nacceptance  of  remittitur  of  t  award  of  actual  damages  on  his \nstrip  search  claim  to  $40,000  on  or  before  January  28,  2003. \nE.  Punitive Damages \nRegarding  the  punit  s  awarded,  the  defendants \nthat  the  plaintiff  fai  to  sent  proof  that  defendants \nLachanski  or  Mosher  were  maliciously motivated  in  partic \nthe  strip  search,  or  that  acted  recklessly  or  with  callous \nindifference  to  the  federally  protected  rights  of  others.  Court \ndisagrees. \n8  In his  dissent  in ~~~~~~~~, 441  U.S.  520,  594  (1979)  (Stevens, \nJ.,  dissenting),  Justice  Stevens  described body  cavity searches  as  \"clearly the \ngreatest personal  indignity.\" \n17 \n\nFrom  the  evidence  presented  regarding  the  surrounding \ncircumstances  of  the  strip  search,  the  jury  could  well  have  found \nsufficient  facts  to  establish  both  defendants'  mali  ous  motives \nculpable  state  of  mind.  See  ~~=-~~===, 461  U.S.  30,  46 \n(1983) (Punitive  damages  are  available  in  a  section  1983  case  \"when \ndefendant's  conduct  is  shown  to  be  mot  by  1  motive  or \nintent,  or  when  it  involves  reckless  or  callous  i  to  the \nrally  protected  rights  of  others.\").  The  very  that \nfendant  Mosher,  a  female,  was  present  during  the  str  search \ncould  establish  the  requisite  elements  for  a  punit  damage  award \nboth  Mosher  and  Lachanski,  the  supervisor.  It  is  qu  e \npossible  that  the  jury determined  that  the  presence  of  a  female \nduring  the  degrading  situation was  intended  solely  purpose \nincreasing  Fyvie's  humiliation.  Further,  jury  could  well \nhave  drawn  their  conclusions  as  to maliciousness  and  the  culpable \nstate  of  mind  of  each  defendant  based  upon  the  defendant's \nknowledge  and  acquiescence  of  what  was  occurring,  and/or  from  the \ninsults  that  were  hurled  at  the  plaintiff during  the  search. \nis  no  basis  to  vacate  the  punitive  damage  awards  as  the \nfendants  argue.  Further,  as  plaintiff argues,  the  punit  damage \nawards  cannot  be  deemed  excessive  especially  in  these  circumstances \nwhere  the  defendants  put  on  no  evidence  in  mitigation  of  punit \ndamages.  Lee  v.  Edwards,  101  F.3d  805,  808-09  (2d  Cir.  1996); \n121  F.3d  808,  816  (2d  Cir.  1997).  There  is  no \n18 \n\n\nreason  to  disturb  jury's  determination  as  to  punitive  damages. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  scussed  above,  the  defendants'  motion  [133­\n1J  is  granted  in part and  denied in part.  The  defendants'  motion \nfor  a  new  trial  on  t  issue  of  Fyvie's  actual  damages  is  granted \nunless  Fyvie  files  and  serves  a  written  acceptance  of  remittitur  of \nthe  awa  of  actual  damages  on  his  strip search  claim  to  $40,000  on \nor  be  re  January  28,  2003.  The  motion  is denied  in  all  other \nrespects. \nIT  IS  SO  ORDERED. \nHon.  J.  McAvoy \nThoma~ \nU.S.  District  Judge \n19 \n",

Plaintiffs  also  asserted  various \nsupplemental \t state  law  causes  action. \nIn  a  Memorandum  Decision  and  Order  entered  on  April  5,  2001, \n1 \n\n\n[Dkt.  #  51],  this  Court  granted  parti  summary  judgment  in  r \nof  Plaintiff  Michael  Fyvie  as  to  s  aim  against  the  C  y  of \nSchenectady  alleging  that  he  was  st  searched  in  violation  of  his \nFourth  Amendment  rights  pursuant  to  an  unconstitutional  str \nsearch  policy.  The  Court  denied  PIa  iff Gonzales'  motion  and \nDefendants  City  of  Schenectady,  Thomas  Mattice,  Michael  Glasser, \nMarisela  Mosher,  William  Lachanski,  and  Eric  Hesch's  cross-motion \nfor  summary  judgment  pursuant  to  Rule  56  on  that  same  issue.  In  a \nseparate  Decision  and  Order  dated  September  14,  2001,  [Dkt.  #  86] \nthe  Court  ermined,  inter alia,  to  sever  the  claims  of  Mr. \nFrisbee  from  the  other  plaintiffs'  claims  pursuant  to  Rule  21  of \nthe  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure. \nThe  cl  of  Plaintiffs  Gonzalez  and  Fyvie  were  tried \ntogether  to  a  jury  in  April,  2002.1  On  p  intiff Michael  Fyvie's \nSection  1983  and  state  common  law  c  of  false  arrest,  the  jury \nfound  no  cause  of  action  in  favor  of  fendant  Michael  Glasser. \nLikewise,  t  jury  found  no  cause  action  in  favor  of  defendant \nMichael  Glasser  on  Fyvie's  state  common  law  aim  of  battery. \nHowever,  as  ed  above,  in  a  Memorandum,  Decision  and  Order \ndated  AprilS,  2001,  the  Court  ruled  as  a  matter  of  law  that  the \nCity  of  Schenectady  had  a  unconstitutional  policy  related  to  strip \nsearching  pre-tr  I  detainees  charged  with  misdemeanor  and  minor \n1 Inasmuch  as  Plaintiff Gonzalez's  jury award  is not  the  subject  of  this \nmotion,  the  jury's determination as  to her  claims  are  not  set  forth  in  this \nDecision  and Order. \n2 \n\noffenses,  and  that  plaintiff Michael  Fyvie  had  been  strip searched \nbased  upon  this  policy  in  violation  of  his  constitutional  rights. \nAt  trial,  the  Court  determined  as  a  matter  of  law  that  defendants \nMarisela  Mosher  and  Thomas  Mattice  were  also  legally  responsib \nfor  any  actual  damages  that  arose  from  this  strip  search  based  upon \ntheir participation  therein.  The  jury  furt  r  determined  that \ndefendant  William  Lachanski  was  legally  responsible  for  any  actual \ndamages  that  arose  from  the  strip  search  under  a  theory  of \nsupervisory  liabil  y.  The  jury  awarded  plaintiff actual  damages \nin  the  amount  of  $75,000.00  arising  from  his  illegal  strip  search, \nand  further  awarded  Fyvie  punitive  damages  in  t  amount  of \n$2,500.00  against  fendant  Ma  sela  Mosher  and  $10,000.00 \nagai~st \ndefendant  William  Lachanski.

However,  reliance  placed  too  heavily  on  a \ncomparative  analysis  has  been  subjected  to  criticism,  especially \nwhen  the  damages  are  wholly  from  emotional  distress,  as  are  the \ndamages  here.

Parties'  Arguments  regarding  compensatory  damages \nDefendants  have  cited to  cases  involving  Section  1983  strip \nsearch  claims  performed  pursuant  to  an  unconstitutional  policy  in \n8 \n\n\nwhich:  (1)  the  Second  Circuit  upheld  a  $1  award  of  nominal  damages, \nShain  v.  Ellison,  273  F.3d  56,  67  (2d  Cir.  2001):  (2)  a  jury \nawarded  $19,645  in  compensatory  damages,  Ciraolo  v.  City  of  New \nYork,  216  F.3d  236  (2d  Cir.  2000);  and  (3)  the  United  States \nDist  ct  Court  the  Southern  Dist  ct  of  New  York  ordered \nremittitur  from  the  j  's award  of  $125,000  to  $25,000.  Kelleher \n90  F.Supp.2d  354  (S.D.N.Y.  2000).  Defendants  argue  that \nPlaintiff  Fyvie  has  been  subjected  to  no  greater  emotional  damage \nthan  any  the  other  plaintiffs  subjected  to  a  strip  search  in  t \ncited  cases,  and  therefore  the  award  is  excessive. \nPlainti  argues  that  while  Kelleher  represents  one  end  of  the \nspectrum,  there  are  numerous  cases  which  have  awarded  substantially \nmore  than  awarded  to  Mr.  Fyvie  for  emotional  distress.  Some  the \ncase  cited by  the  plaintiff do  not  deal  with  strip  searches,  see \nSulkowska  v.  City  of  New  York,  129  F.Supp.  2d  274  (S.D.N.Y. \n2001) (in  non-jury  trial,  court  awards  $275,000  for  \"significant \nemotional  injury  which  has  requi  treatment\"  arising  from  false \narrest,  battery,  and  malicious  prosecution  by  police);  Noga  v. \n99-CV-0941  (N.D.N.Y.  2002) (Homer,  M.J.) (jury  awards \n$235,000  from  mainly  emotional  distress  arising  from  false  arrest \nand  mal  ious  prosecution),  while  the  ones  that  do  address  strip \nsearches  are  not  from  this  Circuit.  Joan  W.  v.  City  of \n~, \nChicago,  771  F.2d  1020,  1025  (7  Cir.  1985) (holding  reasonable  a \n$75,000  award  for  a  strip-search  pursuant  to  a  traffic  stop); \n9 \n\nBeth  G.  v.  City  of  Chicago,  723  F.2d  1263,  1276  n.  11  (7th  Cir. \n1983) (giving  a  range  of  $15,000  to  $112,500  in  str  search  cases) . \nC.  Emotional  Distress Damages \nIt  is  well  established  that  courts  may  award  emotional \ndistress  damages  in  section  1983  cases. \n~=-=.-\"<.,  999  F.2d  655,  662  (2d  Cir.  1993).  However,  \"t  mere  fact \nthat  a  constitutional  deprivation  has  occurred  does  not  justify the \naward  of  [compensatory]  damages;  the  plaintiff must  est  ish  that \nshe  an  actual  injury  caused  by  the  deprivation.\" \n310  F.3d  at  55  (citing \nPiphus,  435  U.S.  247,  263-64  (1978)).  Here,  there  is  no  dispute \nthat  P  iff  Fyvie's  damages  derive  wholly  from  the  emotional \nstress  contends  he  suffered  by  being  subjected  to  the \nunconstitutional  strip  search.  Thus,  the  first  question  to  address \nis  whet  r  t  plaintiff has  adequately  supported  s  compensatory \ndamages  award,  or  whether  he  is  entitled to  only  nominal  damages. \nIn  this  rcuit,  a  \"plaintiff's  testimony  of  emotional  injury \nmust  be  substantiated  by  other  evidence  that  such  an  injury \noccur  ,  such  as  the  testimony  of  witnesses  to  t  intiff's \ndistress,  or  the  objective  circumstances  of  the  violation  self.\" \nPatrolmen's  Benevolent  Ass'n.,  310  F.3d  at  55  (citations  omitted). \na  plaintiff has  sought  medical  treatment  for  the \nemotional  injury  is  not  necessarily  required.  (citing  Miner, \n999  F.2d  at  663). \n10 \n\nAt  trial,  plaintiff  offered his  own  subjective  testimony \nregarding  his  emotional  distress  damages,  as  well  as  that  of  his \nfather.  Fyvie  testified that  he  felt  humiliated  by  the  strip \nsearch,  was  embarrassed  to  tell his  parents  the  circumstances,  and \nIt  frightened  to  be  in  public  places  within  the  City  of \nSchenectady  for  r  that  he  would  be  arrested  and  stripped \nsearched  again.  's  father  testified to  the  outwardly  rent \nmanifestations  of  Fyvie's  distress,  including  the  father's \nobservation  that  his  son  became  sullen  uninterested  in \nsocializing with  friends. \nThe  actual  damage  award  is  supported  by  competent  evidence \nthe  nature  that  this  Circuit  has  found  sufficient  to  sustain  some \ncompensatory  damages  arising  from  the  unconstitutional  act. \n;  Annis  v.  County  of  Westchester,  136  F.3d  239,  249  (2d  Cir. \n1998).  Thus,  there  is  no  basis  to  stri  the  actual  damage  awarded \nor  to  impose  only  nominal  damages.  The  more  narrow  question  rai \non  this motion  is  whether  the  amount  of  e  damages  is  excessive. \nD.  Excessiveness  of Actual  Damage  Award \nOne  of  the  more  recent  cases  relied  upon  by  the  plaintiff as \nrepresenting  the  upper  range  of  justifi  emotional  distress \nawards,  99-CV-0941  (N.D.N.Y.  2002) (Homer,  M.J.), \nwas  itself  subjected  to  a  remittitur  decision  decided  after \nplaintiff  submitted  his  papers  on  this  motion.  See  Noga  v.  Potanza, \n11 \n\n\n221  F.Supp.2d  345  (N.D.N.Y.  2002),3  The  Noga  decision  underscores \nthe  fact  that  each  damage  award  must  be  assessed  for  excessiveness \nbased  upon  the  facts  of  the  case,  including  the  particularities  of \nthe  plaintiff  and  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  constitutional \ndeprivation  issue. 4  The  standard  is  whether  the  award  shoc \nthe  judicial  conscience.  This  standard  contemplates  a  we  ing  of \nthe  character  and  strength  of  the  evidence  of  damages  and  the \ne  s  on  the  plaintiff before  the  court.  Other  plaintiff's \nawards  are  only  a  point  of  reference. \nIndeed,  when  addressing  emotional  injuries,  a  comparative \nanalysis  using  other  similar  constitution  violations  has  a  somewhat \nlimited  utility because  the  emotional  impact  of  a  particular \n3 In  Magistrate  Judge  Homer  determined that  the  award  of  $235,000  for \nthe  emotional  distress  arising  from  plaintiff's  false  arrest  and  malicious \nprosecution was  excessive  and  should be  reduced  to  $91,500  upon  acceptance  of  a \nremittitur.  Id.  at  357-59.  The  $91,500  amount  represents  $40,000.00  for  false \narrest  and  $51,500  for malicious  prosecution.  Id.  at  359.  Mr.  Noga  paid his \nattorney  $1,500.00  in attorney's  fees,  and  therefore  it appears  that  the \nadditional  $50,000.00  on  the malicious  prosecution  claim was  for  emotional \ndistress  arising  from  the  prosecution. \n4 AS  Magistrate  Judge  Homer  noted,  Mr.  Noga,  was  born  in  Poland  in 1935  and \nemigrated  to  the  United  States  in  1965,  becoming  a  citizen in  1970.  Id.  at  357. \nOn  the  day  of  his  arrest,  Noga  was  for  a  birthday  for  his  son. \nHe  was  directed to  accompany  a  New  York  State  Police  Officer  to  the  State \nPolice  station where  he  was  photographed,  fingerprinted  and  then  transferred to \nDefendant  Potenza's  custody.  Id.  He  was  placed  in  a  cell  in the  City of \nSchenectady  Jail  and  held  overnight.  Id.  Apparently,  the  cell was  dirty and \nunsanitary,  and  the  constant  noise  in the  jail kept  from  sl  that \nnight.  Id.  at  357-58.  \"During  the  night,  Noga  recalled how  his  father  had  been \narrested  in  Poland  when  Noga  was  twelve  and  held  in custody  for  two  weeks.\"  rd. \nat  358.  Noga  was  released  in the  afternoon  of the  next  day  and,  although \nprosecuted,  made  no  appearances  in court.  Id.  \"Noga  offered no \nevidence  that,  for  example,  he  ever  suffered  loss  of  or nightmares  after \nthe  night  in  jail,  that  he  ever  sought  or  received  treatment  for  mental  or \nmedical  problems  caused by  the  arrest  or  prosecution,  or  that  he  suffered any \nphysical  injury,  loss  of  reputation,  inconvenience  or  any  other  such  injury.ff \n12 \n\n\nsituation  on  specific  person  is  a  result  of  a  constel  ion  of \nors  including  the  actual  conduct  that  occurred  during \nconstitutional  deprivation,  psychological  make-up  of  t \np  intiff before  the  incident,  and  the  ability of  the  plaintiff to \n1  with  the  situation  to  which  he  or  she  has  been  subject \n297  F.3d  361,  376 \nr.  2002) (Dennis,  J.,  concur  ).5  Different  people  subject  to \nsimilar  conduct  can  react  considerably different  ways. \nthe  justifiable damages  awarded  to  each  for  their  emotional \nstress  would  necessarily  dif  rent. \nHere,  the  jury's  award  cates  that  at  the  time  of  the  st \nsearch,  Plaintiff  Fyvie,  a  college-aged male,  was  lawfully  in \ncustody.  He  testified that  he  was  very  distressed by  the  that \nwas  strip  searched  and  that  a  female  matron  was  present  during \nt  search.  Plaintiff  further  testi  ed  that  he  was  humil  and \nembarrassed  by  both  the  strip  search  the  fact  that  he  was  t \nand  insulted by  the  female  during  the  strip  search. \nIn  addressing  a  similar  claim,  Judge  McMahon  in  the \n5 As  Fifth Circuit  Judge  Dennis  noted  in his  concurring  opinion  in Thomas \nTexas  Dept.  of Criminal  Justice,  297  F.3d  361,  376  (5th Cir.  2002) (Dennis,  J., \n),  the  assessment  of  s  for  emotional  distress  is so  fact-driven \nand  so  largely a  matter  of  judgment  derived  from  weighing  the  character and \nof  the  evidence  presented in each  case  that  it does  not  yield itself to \na  son  of  prior written decisions  which  are  devoid  of  the  demeanor  of  the \nwitnessess  and  the  atmospher  of  the  court  room  upon  which  the  jury relied  in \nits verdict.  Id.  (\"Without  more  into the  nature  and  quality of \n[the]  testimony  [from  a  prior case],  ...  [  [u]nless  we  aim  to  create  an \naward  schedule  for  intangible  injuries  like  s,  marital difficulties, \nand  loss  of  prestige,  I  see  no  way  of  whether  a  subsequent  award  is \nexcessive based  on  the  factual  summary  in  [a  prior  case] ./1). \n13 \n\n\ncase  noted  that  the  plaintiff  in  that  case  did  not  produce  any \nevidence  of  medical  treatment  or  other  professional  expenses \nrelated  to  his  claim  of  emotional  distress,  finding  that  \"[tJhe \naward  of  $125,000  is  clearly  excessive  given  the  lack  of \ncorroborating  medical  testimony  concerning  Plaintiff's  emotional \ndistress.\"  Kelleher,  90  F.Supp.2d  at  364.  However,  Judge  McMahon \nnoted  that \nan  unlawful  strip  search,  in  and  of  itself,  is  an \negregious  violation  of  Plaintiff's  constitutional  right \nto  be  free  from  unwarranted  government  intrusion  of  his \nperson.  Moreover,  Plaintiff  testified that  he  was \ntouched  during  the  search  by  Trooper  Fearon,  which  is \ncontrary  to  State  Police  policy  for  conducting  a  strip \nsearch.  I  therefore  cannot  find  that  Plaintiff  is \nentitled to  no  damages. \nAfter  reviewing  other  damage  awards  in  numerous  other  strip \nsearch  cases  in  other  Circuits,  including  the  case  primarily  relied \nupon  by  the  plaintiff  here,  Judge  McMahon  concluded  that  remittitur \nto  $25,000.00  was  in  order.  Id. \nPlaintiff  in  this  case  argues  that  the  presence  of  the  female \ndefendant  during  his  strip  search  together  with  the  insults  and \ntaunting  that  occurred  during  search  constitutes  \"aggravating \ncircumstances\"  such  to  bring  this  case  out  the  realm  of  Kelleher \nand  into  the  realm  of  Joan  w.  v.  City  of  Chicago,  771  F.2d  1020 \n(7th  Cir.  1985).  The  Court  does  not  agree. \nJoan  W.  involved  a  physician  in  her  mid-thirties  practicing  in \nChicago  who  was  arrested  for  a  traffic  violation  on  January  28, \n14 \n\n\n1978.  Joan  W.,  771  F.2d  at  1021.  Pursuant  to  a  C  y  policy  that  was \nsubsequently  decl  unconstitutional  by  the  court,  five  female \npolice  department  employees  (lit  matrons\")  str  searched  her. \nSeventh  Circuit's  decision  scribed  the  procedure  of  the \nsea  ,  the  particulars  of  the  plaintiff,  and  search's \npsychological  impact  on  the  pI  iff.6  After  ewing  the \nrticulars  of  eight  other  cases  from  the  Nort  rn  District  of \nIllinois  which  were  tried before  juries,  the  Court  rever \ndistrict  court  and  remanded  case  with  directions  to  hold  a \nnew  trial  unless  iff accepted  the  entry  of  a  remittitur \nreducing  the  award  from  $112,000  to  $75,000. 7  In  doing  so,  the \n6  In  this  the  Seventh  Circuit  decision  in ~~~~ indicated: \nDuring  the  search,  Joan  was  forced  to  remove  her  clothing  and  to \nexpose  the  and  anal  areas  of  her  body.  The  matrons \nthreatened her  when  she  initially refused to  comply,  used  vulgar \nlanguage,  and  at  her.  Joan  testified that  the  incident \ncaused  her  emotional  distress  that  manifested  itself in  reduced \nsocializing,  poor  work  performance,  paranoia,  suicidal  feelings, \ndepression,  and  an  inability to disrobe  in any place other  than  a \ncloset.  She  introduced evidence  to  show  that  she  was \npeculiarly sensitive  to  the  kind  of  physical  violation she  had \nendured because  she  was  a  private person  who  even  during  school \ngym  classes  could  not  completely disrobe  in  front  of  others and  was \nconscious  of her physical  disabilities  caused by  her  chronic \narthritis. \n771  F.2d  at  1021-22. \n7 In  addressing  the  argument  on  appeal  that  the  award  of  $112,000  for  Joan \nW's  damages  was  excessive,  the  Seventh Circuit  noted that  the  e  test \nwas  \"severe,\"  and  cited the precedent  in  that  circuit that  allowed a  trial  judge \nto vacate  a  jury verdict  for  excessiveness  if it is  \"monstrously \nexcessive\"  or  if there  is  \"no  rational  connection  between  the  evidence  on \nand  the  verdict,\"  and  that  \"appellate  review  is  governed by  the \nextremely limited abuse  of discretion standard.\"  Id.  (citations  omitted).  The \nCourt  then  explained that  the  test,  like  in  New  York,  also  required comparison \nwith  other  similar  cases.  Id. \n15 \n\nSeventh  Circuit  noted  that  the  $112,000  award  was  \"flagrantly \nextravagant  and  out  of  line  with  the  other  strip  search  cases.\"  Id. \nSeventh  Circuit  continued,  stating  that  \"[hlowever \nreprehensible  the  City's  conduct,  the  jury does  not  have  discretion \nto  award  what  are  essent  lly punitive  damages  where  no  punit \ns  are  pled  or  permitted.  Id.  (citing \nIf \nConcerts,  Inc.,  453  U.S.  247  (1981) (munici  lities  are  immune  from \npunitive  damages  in  section  1983  actions)). \nHere,  while  the  plaintiff  and  his  father  did  testify to  the \nemotional  distress  that  arose  for  the  strip  ,  it was  not  of \nthe  magnitude  realized by  the  plaintiff  in  There  was  no \nindication  of  suicidal  thoughts,  poor  work  ormance,  or  other \nial  effects  on  Fyvie's  life beyond  his  humiliation  and \nreduced  socialization.  Further,  unlike  in  or  Noga,  the \ns  of  this  case  do  not  demonstrate  that  ntiff  had  any \nparticular  sensitivity  to  the  kind  of  physical  violation  he \nend~ \nwhich  would  warrant  any  increased damage  awa \nWhile  the  Second  Circuit  has  held  that  emotional  distress \ndamages  can  properly  range  from  $1.00  upwards  to  almost \n$600,000.00,  see  Patrolmen's  Benevolent  Ass'n.,  310  F.3d  at  56,  the \ncla  for  emotional  damages  that  exceed  $40,000.00  involve  either \nlong-term  harassment,  Phillips  v.

The  upper \nend  of  the  scale  for  the  t  and  magnitude  of  emotional  distress \ndamages  suffered by  plaintiff  is  $40,000.  Therefore,  the \ndefendants'  motion  for  a  new  t  al  on  the  issue  of  Fyvie's  actual \ndamages  is  granted  unless  les  and  serves  a  written \nacceptance  of  remittitur  of  t  award  of  actual  damages  on  his \nstrip  search  claim  to  $40,000  on  or  before  January  28,  2003. \nE.  Punitive Damages \nRegarding  the  punit  s  awarded,  the  defendants \nthat  the  plaintiff  fai  to  sent  proof  that  defendants \nLachanski  or  Mosher  were  maliciously motivated  in  partic \nthe  strip  search,  or  that  acted  recklessly  or  with  callous \nindifference  to  the  federally  protected  rights  of  others.  Court \ndisagrees. \n8  In his  dissent  in ~~~~~~~~, 441  U.S.  520,  594  (1979)  (Stevens, \nJ.,  dissenting),  Justice  Stevens  described body  cavity searches  as  \"clearly the \ngreatest personal  indignity.\" \n17 \n\nFrom  the  evidence  presented  regarding  the  surrounding \ncircumstances  of  the  strip  search,  the  jury  could  well  have  found \nsufficient  facts  to  establish  both  defendants'  mali  ous  motives \nculpable  state  of  mind.  See  ~~=-~~===, 461  U.S.  30,  46 \n(1983) (Punitive  damages  are  available  in  a  section  1983  case  \"when \ndefendant's  conduct  is  shown  to  be  mot  by  1  motive  or \nintent,  or  when  it  involves  reckless  or  callous  i  to  the \nrally  protected  rights  of  others.\").  The  very  that \nfendant  Mosher,  a  female,  was  present  during  the  str  search \ncould  establish  the  requisite  elements  for  a  punit  damage  award \nboth  Mosher  and  Lachanski,  the  supervisor.  It  is  qu  e \npossible  that  the  jury determined  that  the  presence  of  a  female \nduring  the  degrading  situation was  intended  solely  purpose \nincreasing  Fyvie's  humiliation.  Further,  jury  could  well \nhave  drawn  their  conclusions  as  to maliciousness  and  the  culpable \nstate  of  mind  of  each  defendant  based  upon  the  defendant's \nknowledge  and  acquiescence  of  what  was  occurring,  and/or  from  the \ninsults  that  were  hurled  at  the  plaintiff during  the  search. \nis  no  basis  to  vacate  the  punitive  damage  awards  as  the \nfendants  argue.  Further,  as  plaintiff argues,  the  punit  damage \nawards  cannot  be  deemed  excessive  especially  in  these  circumstances \nwhere  the  defendants  put  on  no  evidence  in  mitigation  of  punit \ndamages.  Lee  v.  Edwards,  101  F.3d  805,  808-09  (2d  Cir.  1996); \n121  F.3d  808,  816  (2d  Cir.  1997).  There  is  no \n18 \n\n\nreason  to  disturb  jury's  determination  as  to  punitive  damages. \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  scussed  above,  the  defendants'  motion  [133­\n1J  is  granted  in part and  denied in part.  The  defendants'  motion \nfor  a  new  trial  on  t  issue  of  Fyvie's  actual  damages  is  granted \nunless  Fyvie  files  and  serves  a  written  acceptance  of  remittitur  of \nthe  awa  of  actual  damages  on  his  strip search  claim  to  $40,000  on \nor  be  re  January  28,  2003.

New York.\nApril 5, 2001.\n305 *305 Tobin and Dempf, Albany, NY (Kevin A. Luibrand, Adrienne Kerwin, of Counsel), for plaintiffs.\nOffice of Corporation Counsel, Schenectady, NY (Michael T. Brockbank, of Counsel), for Defendants City of\nSchenectady, Mattice, Glasser, Mosher, Lachanski, and Hesch.\nMEMORANDUM 00 DECISION & ORDER\n97\nMcAVOY, District Judge.\nPlaintiffs commenced the instant action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging violations of their Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendment rights arising out of their alleged arrests, detainments, and strip searches by Defendants.\nPlaintiffs also assert various pendent state law causes of action. Presently before the Court are Plaintiffs\nElizabeth Gonzalez and Michael Fyvie's motion for partial summary judgment pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 56 on\nthe issue of the City of Schenectady's liability for its strip search policy and Defendants City of Schenectady,\nThomas Mattice, Michael Glasser, Marisela Mosher, William Lachanski, and Eric Hesch's cross-motion for\nsummary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 on that same issue.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe Court will state only those facts relevant to the instant motions.\nA. The Strip Search Policy\nAt all times relevant hereto, the City of Schenectady (the \"City\") had an informal policy requiring that all detainees\n306 being held within the City cell block would be *306 strip searched regardless of the crime for which the detainee\nwas being held. Glasser Dep., p. 13; Mosher Dep., p. 9; Lachanski Dep., p. 6; Mattice Dep., p. 69; Hesch Dep., p.\n31-32; Def. Rule 7.1(a)(3) stmnt, no. 1.\nB. Elizabeth Gonzalez\nOn April 28, 1998, Defendant City of Schenectady Police Officer Eric Hesch stopped Gonzalez's vehicle for a\npurported traffic violation. Hesch obtained Gonzlez's driver's license, vehicle registration, and insurance card.\n[1]\nHesch returned to his car and learned that there was an \"association hit\" on Gonzalez.  Hesch explained the\nassociation hit to Gonzalez and asked her if she would come to the police station to resolve the matter. Gonzalez\n\n[2]\nagreed.  According to Gonzalez, Hesch ordered a female police matron at the police station to strip search her.\n[3]\nGonzalez contends that she was then strip searched.  Defendants deny having strip searched Gonzalez.\nThe matron then took Gonzalez's fingerprints. Hesch drove the fingerprints to Albany to check whether Gonzalez\nwas indeed a wanted individual. The fingerprint check revealed that Plaintiff was not one of the wanted\nindividuals. Plaintiff was then released without being charged with any crimes or being issued any tickets.\nC. Michael Fyvie\nOn May 30, 1999, Defendant City of Schenectady Police Officer Michael Glasser responded to a fight call. At that\ntime, Glasser arrested Fyvie, brought him to the police station, and charged him with disorderly conduct. After\nbeing held in a holding cell for a period of time, Fyvie was issued an appearance ticket and released. As he was\n[4]\nleaving the police station, Fyvie had some words with a police officer.  City police officers then grabbed him,\nreturned him to the booking area, and strip searched him. Fyvie was then placed in a cell for approximately one\nhour until his parents posted bail for his release. No further charges were leveled against Fyvie.\n307 Gonzalez and Fyvie then commenced the instant action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. *307 § 1983 alleging, among other\nthings, violations of their Fourth Amendment rights. Presently before the Court are: (1) Gonzalez and Fyvie's\n(collectively \"Plaintiffs\") motion for partial summary judgment pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 56 on the issue of the\nCity of Schenectady's liability for its alleged unconstitutional strip search policy; and (2) Defendants City of\nSchenectady, Thomas Mattice, Michael Glasser, Marisela Mosher, William Lachanski, and Eric Hesch's cross-\nmotion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 on that same issue.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. Summary Judgment Standard\nIn addressing the pending motions, the Court will apply the familiar standard for summary judgment, which need\nnot be restated here. Roman v. Cornell Univ., 53 F.Supp.2d 223, 232-33 (N.D.N.Y.1999); Phipps v. New York\nState Dep't of Labor, 53 F.Supp.2d 551 (N.D.N.Y.1999); Riley v. Town of Bethlehem, 44 F.Supp.2d 451, 458\n(N.D.N.Y.1999).\nB. The Constitutionality of the Strip Search Policy\nThe City admits that it had a policy of strip searching all detainees who were to be placed in the cell block. As\npreviously discussed, the undisputed evidence is that this was a blanket policy applicable to all detainees,\nregardless of their individual circumstances.\nIt is well-settled in this Circuit that \"the Fourth Amendment precludes prison officials from performing strip/body\ncavity searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanors or other minor offenses unless the officials have a\nreasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime charged,\nthe particular circumstances of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\" Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796\n(2d Cir.1986). Because the City of Schenectady had a policy of strip searching all persons to be detained,\nregardless of whether the police had the requisite reasonable suspicion, the policy at issue here violates the\nFourth Amendment. Id. The fact that the City did not search all arrestees, but only those to be held in the cell\nblock awaiting court action, does not insulate their policy from the fact that they conducted blanket searches on\nsuch individuals without first considering, on an individual basis, whether they had reasonable suspicion to do so.\nVarrone v. Bilotti, 123 F.3d 75, 79 (2d Cir.1997). Moreover, the City is liable for this official, although unwritten,\npolicy. Monell v. Department of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).\nThe City argues that the Second Circuit's reasonable suspicion requirement is inconsistent with the Supreme\nCourt's decisions in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), and Block v. Rutherford,\n\n468 U.S. 576, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984), and should, therefore, be rejected. The Second Circuit's\ndecision in Weber was decided after Block and Wolfish and fully took those decision into consideration. The\nholding in Weber has consistently been reaffirmed by the Second Circuit, see, e.g., Ciraolo v. City of New York,\n216 F.3d 236, 238 (2d Cir.2000), and is in accord with the precedent of other circuit courts. See, e.g., Swain v.\nSpinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997); Kelly v. Foti, 77 F.3d 819 (5th Cir.1996). The Court sees no basis upon which\nto depart from the clear law in this Circuit on this issue. The Court, therefore, finds that the City of Schenectady\nused an unconstitutional strip search policy.\n308 *308 This, however, does not end the inquiry. The Court must next examine whether Plaintiffs' constitutional\nrights were violated by this policy.\n1. Gonzalez\nGonzalez alleges in her deposition that Defendants required her to lower her pants (but not her underwear) and\nraise her shirt (but not take off her bra). Defendants deny this and point out that the policy only applied to\ndetainees placed in the cell block. Gonzalez was never charged with any crime. Defendants submitted the cell\nblock record for September 28, 1998, which does not include Gonzalez's name, thereby indicating that she was\nnot placed in the cell block. In fact, Gonzalez admits she was not placed in a cell. Gonzalez Dep., p. 46.\nDefendants also submit the affidavits of Rebecca Gage and Diane Updyke, the City police department matrons\nwho were on duty on the night in question, who state that Gonzalez was not placed in a cell or detention area and\nshe was not searched. Hesch also testified at deposition that Gage likely was the matron on duty that night, that\nhe gave no instructions to Gage, and that there was no reason for Gonzalez to be searched because she was not\narrested.\nBased on the above-discussed evidence, a fair-minded jury could reasonably conclude that Gonzalez was not\n[5]\nplaced in a cell and, therefore, not subjected to the City's policy.  The Court, therefore, finds a genuine issue of\n[6]\ntriable fact regarding whether Gonzalez was actually strip searched pursuant to the unconstitutional policy.\nDefendants argue that, assuming Gonzalez was searched, they had reasonable suspicion to do so because\nthere was an association hit on her indicating that she may have had a warrant on an illegal possession of a\nweapon charge and \"there was a reasonable basis to undertake that ... search ... particularly where Ms.\n309 Gonzalez was left unattended in an unsecure *309 portion of the facility.\" Def. Mem. of Law, at 8. Defendants'\nargument in this regard defies logic and, frankly, is absurd. Considering the totality of the circumstances,\nincluding the nature of the traffic stop, Gonzalez's compliance and cooperation with Hesch during his\ninvestigation of this matter, Gonzalez's agreement to accompany Hesch to the police station to resolve the\n[7]\nmatter, and the facts that Hesch did not see it fit to frisk or handcuff Gonzalez or to place her in a holding cell,  it\nis disingenuous at best for Defendants to now contend that they had a reasonable suspicion that she might have\npossessed weapons or contraband.\nAccordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion and Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment as to\nGonzalez.\n2. Fyvie\nDefendants admit that they strip searched Fyvie, who was placed in a cell. Fyvie thus falls squarely within the\nCity's unconstitutional policy. Defendants again argue, however, that they had reasonable suspicion to strip\nsearch Fyvie.\nFyvie was arrested for a violation of N.Y. PENAL LAW § 240.20, disorderly conduct, for his alleged involvement in\na fight. Disorderly conduct is a violation under New York Law. N.Y. PENAL LAW § 240.20. Fyvie did not offer\nmuch resistance, if any, to Glasser, the arresting officer, and was placed in handcuffs. Glasser frisked Fyvie but\ndid not find anything that caused concern. Glasser then brought Fyvie to the police station. At the station, Fyvie\nwas placed in a holding cell, without any further searches. After considering such factors as the extent of the\ncrime, the charge, and the extent of Fyvie's cooperation, Glasser Dep., p. 44., Glasser determined to issue Fyvie\n\nan appearance ticket and release him without the need to post bail. Id. at 34. Defendants released Fyvie. While in\n[8]\nthe process of being released, Fyvie apparently made some comments to the police regarding his arrest.\nDefendants then rescinded Fyvie's appearance ticketed and returned him to the holding cell area. Fyvie was then\nstrip searched, placed in the holding cell, and later released on bail.\nBased on these facts, and even assuming that Fyvie lunged at a police officer, there is no evidence upon which a\nfair minded jury could reasonably conclude that Defendants had reasonable suspicion to believe that Fyvie was\nconcealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime charged, his particular characteristics, and/or the\ncircumstances of the arrest. Weber, 804 F.2d at 802. While Fyvie may not have been the model prisoner, there is\nnothing in the record tending to suggest that he was in possession of contraband or weapons. The charge\nagainst Fyvie, disorderly conduct, is not particularly serious. Defendants point to no specifics of Fyvie's character\nor his arrest that would have led them to reasonably believe that he was in possession of weapons or\ncontraband. This is particularly so in light of the fact that Defendants did not initially strip search Fyvie upon\nplacing him in the holding cell. Defendants did not strip search him until after they had released him and decided\n310 to re-detain him. The fact that Defendants chose \"to rescind the appearance *310 ticket and take Fyvie back into\ncustody\" and make him await bail brings him precisely within the parameters of the unconstitutional strip search\npolicy. Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment for the violations of his Fourth Amendment rights\ncaused by the City's unconstitutional strip search policy. Issues of fact remain regarding any actual (as opposed\nto nominal) damages.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Gonzalez's motion for summary judgment is DENIED IN ITS ENTIRETY;\nPlaintiff Fyvie's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to his claim against the City of Schenectady that\nhe was strip searched in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights pursuant to an unconstitutional strip search\npolicy; and Defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] An association hit does not mean that the subject person is necessarily wanted, but that \"there is something\nclose, [there is a] similarity that that person is believed could possibly be the wanted person.\" Hesch Dep., p. 21. \nThe documents submitted by Defendants demonstrate that the association hits identified the following\ninformation:\n(1) Name: Betsy Gonzalez; Sex: Female; Date of Birth: 04/24/69; Height: 5'7\"; Weight: 176 lbs; wanted for a\nparole violation.\n(2) Name: Elizabeth Gonzalez; Sex: Female; Race: White; Date of Birth: 1/4/68; Height: 5'3\"; Weight: 120 lbs;\nwanted by the New York City Police Department for possession of a weapon.\n(3) Name: Elizabeth Gonzalez; Sex: Female; Race: White: Date of Birth: 4/12/70; Height: 5'4\"; Weight: 136 lbs;\nwanted by the New York City Police Department for larceny.\nGonzalez was born on April 25, 1968, is Hispanic, weighed approximately 130 pounds at the time in question,\nand is 5'3\" tall.\n[2] Hesch drove Gonzalez to the police station in his vehicle, apparently without frisking her or using handcuffs.\n[3] At deposition, Gonzalez testified that she was required to pull her pants down to her knees, exposing her\nunderwear. Gonzalez further testified that she was not required to bend over or show any body cavities.\nGonzalez then had to lift her shirt up, exposing her brassiere. Gonzalez Dep., pp. 55-56.\n[4] There is a dispute as to what Fyvie said at this time. Fyvie states he was merely asking questions about the\ncharge against him while Defendants contend that Fyvie stated he intended to return to the scene of the fight and\nfinish what he started and lunged at a police officer.\n\n[5] Gonzalez argues that the Court should disregard the Gage affidavit, which states that she was on duty on the\nevening in question and did not search Gonzalez, because the City's response to interrogatories indicate that: (1)\nthe City did not then know what \"police officer or police officers\" conducted a search of Gonzalez; (2) the City\nindicated that there were no known witnesses to the incident; and (3) the City failed to indicate that Gage was on\nduty on the night in question. In addition, Gonzalez points to Hesch's deposition testimony where he recounts a\nconversation he had with Gage whereby she apparently indicated she did not recall whether she was on duty on\nthe subject night and that she did not remember Gonzalez. \nAs to the first contention, Gage's affidavit reveals that she is not a \"police officer\" and, therefore, the interrogatory\ndid not apply to her. As to the second contention, it is unclear when the City knew of Gage's involvement in the\nmatter, although one would think it should have known she was on duty before preparing the responses to the\ninterrogatories. As to the third contention, it appears that the City only listed police officers, although the relevant\ninterrogatory question does ask for all police department employees. As to Hesch's deposition testimony, it is\nhearsay and, in any event, involves information that may have been discovered (by virtue of Hesch's testimony)\nafter the City prepared the responses to the interrogatories.\nEven if the Court were to exclude the Gage affidavit, it would still find genuine issues of triable fact based on: (1)\nHesch's deposition testimony that he did not order Gage to search Gonzalez and Gonzalez likely would not have\nbeen searched because she was not arrested; and (2) the fact that the policy applies only to persons placed in\nthe cell block and Defendants' evidence and Gonzalez's own admissions reveal that she was not placed in the\ncell block.\n[6] The only issue presently before the Court is whether Gonzalez was strip searched pursuant to an\nunconstitutional policy. The Court expresses no opinion on the merits of any claim Gonzalez may have for any\nstrip search of her person not a result of that policy.\n[7] In fact, Hesch left Gonzalez unsecured with the matron while he left to drive to Albany to run a check on her\nfingerprints. If Hesch truly believed Gonzalez to pose a risk to the security of the police station, one would think\nhe would have acted more prudently.\n[8] There is a factual dispute over what transpired at this point. Defendants contend that Fyvie was being\nbelligerent, lunged at a police officer, and stated he was going back to the scene to finish what he had started.\nFyvie, on the other hand, contends he was merely protesting his arrest.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
