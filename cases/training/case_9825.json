    "summary": "<p>This case was brought on March 15, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by a woman who was strip searched after being arrested as the chief aggressor in a domestic dispute with her estranged husband. Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, plead federal and state law claims. She sought damages for the search and for the conduct of a male officer who took her fingerprints in such a way as to make unecessary contact with her breasts and pelvis.</p><p>The District Court (Judge William C. O'Kelley, Jr.) denied the defendants' assertion of immunity and the defendants took an interlocutory appeal.</p><p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (Chief Judge Edmonson) held that the individual officer was not entitled to immunity and that further fact development was called for, and that although a blanket strip search policy is not constitutional, each search must be examined on its own facts. Here, the officers claimed to have reasonably believed that plaintiff was concealing a weapon.</p><p>The decision was thus reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded. </p><p>According to the docket, the case was voluntarily dismissed, though we have no information about a settlement. </p><p>We have no further information about this case.</p><p></p>",

Matthew Maguire, Jr., Balch & Bingham, LLP, Scott Dewitt Delius, Delius Law Firm, P.C., Atlanta, GA, for\nHicks.\n[*]\nBefore EDMONDSON, Chief Judge, HULL, Circuit Judge, and EDENFIELD , District Judge.\nEDMONDSON, Chief Judge:\nThis civil action for damages is, among other things, about a county jail's practice of strip searching all detainees\nwho were to be placed in the general jail population 00 regardless of whether reasonable suspicion existed for the\n97\nsearch of a particular pretrial detainee. Because we are overcome by this Circuit's precedent, we must agree with\nthe district court that such a general practice, for now at least, is an unlawful basis for the searches. But because\nthe Plaintiff's strip search in this case was supported by reasonable suspicion, we conclude that Defendants are\nentitled to summary judgment on that ground and accordingly reverse, in part, the district court's decision.\n1249 Background\n*1249\nPlaintiff-Appellee Janet M. Hicks was arrested in April 2001 by a corporal of the Habersham County, Georgia,\n[1]\nSheriff's Department after a domestic dispute with her estranged husband.  After investigating at the scene, the\nCorporal determined that Plaintiff 00 though exhibiting no violent behavior after the Corporal arrived 00 was the\n97 97\n[2]\nchief aggressor and charged her with family violence battery.  The Corporal took Plaintiff to the Habersham\nCounty Jail where he notified the jailers of the arrest charge and turned Plaintiff over to the custody of the jailers\nfor processing. No jailer who had contact with Plaintiff during her booking process testified that he suspected that\nPlaintiff was concealing weapons or contraband.\nPlaintiff arrived at the Jail between 5:30 and 6:15 p.m., the time during which shift changes at the Jail occurred.\nComing on duty for the night shift at about the same time was Shift Corporal John Taylor and Jail Officer Joshua\nHighfill. Also on duty from the day shift was Dispatcher Jennie Clouatre, who was to go off duty at about 6:30\np.m.\nUpon Plaintiff's arrival, she was placed in a holding cell. Plaintiff was allowed to come out of the cell to meet with\nher lawyer and was then put back in the holding cell. Corporal Taylor later retrieved Plaintiff from the cell; a\nwoman then took Plaintiff into a bathroom to perform a strip search. Plaintiff believes the woman may have been\n[3]\nDispatcher Clouatre, but she is not sure.\nAccording to Plaintiff, Clouatre took Plaintiff into a windowless bathroom 00 no one else was in the room 00 and\n97 97\ntold her to disrobe, lift her breasts, and cough three times while squatting. Never did Clouatre, during the search,\n\ntouch Plaintiff. The search lasted about five or six minutes. Plaintiff testified that Clouatre's demeanor was \"[j]ust\nbusinesslike\" and that Clouatre \"was just doing her job.\" Clouatre testified that she does not remember Plaintiff in\nparticular but that Clouatre, as a Dispatcher, has performed strip searches before at the request of the Shift\nCorporal when no female jailer was on duty. While Clouatre did not perform strip searches unless directed by the\nShift Corporal, she understood the Jail's practice was to strip search everyone who came to be jailed regardless\nof the charge.\n[4]\nAfter the search, Plaintiff was photographed and fingerprinted by Officer Highfill.  According to Plaintiff, Officer\nHighfill instructed her to stand directly behind him while he pulled each arm around his body when making\nPlaintiff's fingerprints. Plaintiff testified Highfill explained to her that this method ensured a more accurate printing.\n1250 Highfill pulled Plaintiff's arm around him with the rolling of each finger, causing Plaintiff's breasts *1250 and pelvis\nrepeatedly to touch Highfill's back.\nPlaintiff said she felt like she was being \"toyed with\" during the photograph and fingerprinting process. She\noffered two reasons: (1) she was scared and nervous, and she believed the officers could see that; and (2) the\nofficers had made light of the requirement to photograph Plaintiff's scar as a precaution against a possible\nescape attempt. But as with Clouatre, Plaintiff testified that, during the fingerprinting, Highfill was \"just doing his\njob\" and \"w[as not] mean to me.\" No officer in the Sheriff's department 00 including Taylor or Highfill 00 testified that\n97 97\nhe had ever fingerprinted a detainee by having a detainee stand directly behind the officer, and two officers\ntestified that such a method was inadvisable because it put the officer at risk.\nCorporal Taylor testified that, during the previous Sheriff's administration, he had questioned a superior officer\nabout the Jail's blanket strip-search practice after Taylor learned at jail school that \"we shouldn't strip search\neverybody that comes through the door.\" The superior had replied that he would look into it but that they were to\n\"fall back on department policy\" and that he thought they \"could get away with it.\" Officer Highfill also testified that\nhe was instructed to strip search every detainee that was to be held in the Jail. All Defendants who testified said\nthat the reason for such a practice was for the safety and security of the Jail Officers and the inmates.\nSheriff Richard Moore assumed the duties of his office in January 2001, at which time a written policy requiring\nreasonable suspicion for strip searches was in place at the Jail: a policy put there by a previous administration.\nSheriff Moore testified that he did not read the policy upon taking office and that he delegated the day-to-day\noperations at the Jail00including searches 00 to the Jail Administrator, Captain Brian Ausburn. Sheriff Moore\n97 97\ncontends he was unaware of the blanket strip-search practice until a lawsuit about a strip search performed in the\nprevious Sheriff's administration 00 a suit filed in October 2001 (after the search in this case) 00 prompted an\n97 97\ninvestigation into the Jail's search practice. The spouse of the plaintiff in that earlier lawsuit complained in\nJanuary 2001 (before the search in this case) to Sheriff Moore about the specific strip search in that case; and\nSheriff Moore said he would look into the matter. Some testimony in the record indicates that Sheriff Moore had\nbeen in the immediate vicinity when jailers were preparing to strip search other detainees.\nCaptain Ausburn testified that he also was unaware that a general strip search practice was being followed at the\nJail until he 00 at the behest of Sheriff Moore upon the filing of the October 2001 lawsuit 00 questioned jailers in the\n97 97\nfall of 2001 about strip searches. Captain Ausburn discovered that a former administration's practice, requiring\nindiscriminate strip searches, had been continued under Sheriff Moore's tenure. Plaintiff contends Sheriff Moore\ndid not instruct his deputies to stop the practice in the Jail until November 2001; that same month a pamphlet was\ndistributed to jailers containing a \"decision tree\" to aid jailers in the determination of reasonable suspicion for strip\nsearches.\nPlaintiff brought both federal and state-law claims in this case, only a few of which are presented for review in this\nappeal. On her federal claims before this Court, Plaintiff contends that her Fourth Amendment rights were\nviolated when she was strip searched pursuant to the Jail's general practice requiring the strip search 00 without\n97\n1251 regard for particularized reasonable *1251 suspicion 00 of all detainees to be housed in the Jail. Plaintiff brings\n97\nthis claim against Clouatre for performing the search, and against Sheriff Moore, Captain Ausburn and Sergeant\nGosnell alleging supervisory liability for failure to train. Plaintiff further claims that Highfill violated her\nconstitutional rights when he fingerprinted her in a way that caused her body to be pulled against his during the\nprocess. The state-law claim in this appeal is an assault and battery claim against Highfill for the fingerprinting.\n\nThe district court concluded that the indiscriminate strip-search practice at the Jail was unconstitutional under our\nCircuit's decision in Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2001), and also concluded that the circumstances\nhere did not support a determination of reasonable suspicion for the strip search performed on Plaintiff\nspecifically. The district court denied qualified immunity to Clouatre on the strip search itself and denied qualified\nimmunity to Moore, Ausburn and Gosnell on the failure-to-train claim. The court also denied qualified immunity to\nHighfill on the federal claim for the fingerprinting and denied Highfill official immunity on the state-law assault and\nbattery claim for the fingerprinting. Defendants took an interlocutory appeal on the denial of immunity.\nDiscussion\nI. Federal Claims\nWhen we consider the question of entitlement to qualified immunity, we first ordinarily ask whether the\nConstitution was violated at all.\nA. The Strip Search.\nPlaintiff contends Clouatre (pursuant to the Jail's practice) violated Plaintiff's rights under the Fourth Amendment\nby strip searching her without reasonable suspicion. She also claims that Sheriff Moore, Captain Ausburn, and\nSergeant Gosnell are liable to her based on a theory of supervisory liability because they failed to train jailers\nproperly about when to conduct strip searches, instead adhering to the general practice that required strip\nsearches of all detainees regardless of the charge or circumstances.\nWe will assume that it was the practice of Habersham County to strip search every detainee who was to be\n[5]\nplaced in the general population of the Jail.  And given the Circuit's precedent, we must conclude the search of\nPlaintiff cannot be justified under the Constitution on the single ground that Plaintiff was about to be placed in the\nJail's general population. See Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2001).\nThat conclusion, however, does not mean that Plaintiff's own constitutional rights were violated when she was\nsearched: just because she was strip searched at a jail that had a search practice that would generally violate the\nConstitution does not mean every search that was conducted actually violated the Constitution. Skurstenis v.\n1252 Jones, 236 F.3d 678, 682 (11th Cir.2000). We said in Skurstenis*1252 that \"`reasonable suspicion' may justify a\nstrip search of a pretrial detainee.\" Id. Because we conclude that reasonable suspicion existed for this particular\nstrip search, we also must conclude that no constitutional right was violated by the search.\n\"Whether an officer has a reasonable suspicion is an objective question viewed from the standpoint of a\nreasonable [ ] officer at the scene. It is based on the totality of the circumstances, and is a question of law to be\nreviewed de novo.\" Evans, 407 F.3d at 1280 (citations omitted).\nPlaintiff was arrested and charged with family violence battery under O.C.G.A. § 16-5-23.1, the elements of which\nare \"intentionally caus[ing] substantial physical harm or visible bodily harm\" to a \"past or present spouse.\" Id. §\n16-5-23.1(a), (f). This crime is obviously one of violence. We accept that a person's being charged with a crime of\nviolence is sufficient to evoke reasonable suspicion that the person may be concealing weapons or contraband. \nAccord Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989) (\"It is objectively reasonable to conduct a strip\nsearch of one charged with a crime of violence before that person comes into contact with other inmates.\").\nWe know that both the arresting officer and the jail shift supervisor testified that they 00 based on their interactions\n97\nwith Plaintiff that evening 00 did not subjectively suspect Plaintiff of possessing weapons or drugs. But whether\n97\nreasonable suspicion existed at the time is a question of law to be determined ultimately by judges, not\npolicemen or jailers. And the question we are faced with here is not whether a specific arresting officer or jailer\nactually and subjectively had the pertinent reasonable suspicion, but whether, given the circumstances,\nreasonable suspicion objectively existed to justify such a search. That no one, at the time, actually conducted a\n\"reasonable suspicion\" analysis is unimportant to whether reasonable suspicion objectively existed, given the\n\ncircumstances. The subjective intentions and beliefs of the jailers conducting the strip search \"are immaterial to\nthe Fourth Amendment analysis.\" Evans, 407 F.3d at 1280 n. 9, citing Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct.\n1865, 1872, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989).\nPlaintiff argues that the three cases cited by Defendants, Cuesta v. School Bd. of Miami-Dade County, 285 F.3d\n962 (11th Cir.2002); Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 678; and Justice v. Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11th Cir.1992), are\ninapposite to whether Clouatre had reasonable suspicion to strip search Plaintiff based solely on an arrest\ncharge: in those cases, this Court considered circumstances other than the arrest charge in determining that\nreasonable suspicion existed for the strip searches. Cuesta, 285 F.3d at 970-71 (violent and hateful language in\npamphlets distributed by school children included in arrest affidavit); Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 682 (.38 revolver in\ncar at time of arrest); Justice, 961 F.2d at 194 (suspicious drug-related activity at time of arrest made in drug-\nrelated location).\nWe agree that those cases are not controlling, but for another reason: none of those cases involved an arrest for\nan obvious crime of violence. Cuesta, 285 F.3d at 965 (plaintiff charged with distributing publications that \"tend to\nexpose persons to hatred, contempt, or ridicule\"); Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 680 (plaintiff charged with DUI); \nJustice, 961 F.2d at 190 (plaintiff charged with loitering and truancy).\n1253 We conclude that the strip search performed on Plaintiff violated no constitutional *1253 right.[6] Accordingly, we\nreverse the judgment of the district court denying summary judgment to Clouatre. Because we conclude that\nPlaintiff's constitutional rights were not violated by the search, Plaintiff cannot maintain a § 1983 action for\nsupervisory liability against Sheriff Moore, Captain Ausburn, or Sergeant Gosnell for failure to train. Rooney v.\nWatson, 101 F.3d 1378, 1381 n. 2 (11th Cir. 1996). We also reverse the district court's denial of summary\njudgment to Moore, Ausburn and Gosnell on that basis.\nB. The Fingerprinting.\nPlaintiff claims her Fourth Amendment rights were violated when Officer Highfill fingerprinted her in a way that\ncaused her body repeatedly to be pressed against Highfill's back. In her brief, Plaintiff contends Highfill's acts\nviolated the Fourth Amendment; the brief says that it is an obvious violation of the Fourth Amendment to \"fondle,\"\n\"grope\" and \"sexually assault\" a pretrial detainee. But in her complaint and deposition, Plaintiff herself never used\nsuch words and does not hint at sexual impropriety on Highfill's part; she describes Highfill's conduct during the\nfingerprinting process as \"just doing his job\" and that Highfill \"w[as not] mean to me.\" For example, no sexual\nlanguage (or even sexually suggestive language) accompanied the fingerprinting.\nAfter the dust has settled on this claim, what remains is that Plaintiff 00 an adult who was always fully clothed 00\n97 97\nwas uncomfortable when she was being fingerprinted because her body was pulled into the back of Officer\nHighfill with the rolling of each finger. Plaintiff, at the time, said nothing about her discomfort; nor did she claim 00\n97\nthen or in her complaint, deposition or brief 00 that she was hurt or injured physically.\n97\n[7]\nWe acknowledge that a Fourth Amendment  violation can occur without much force being applied during a\nseizure. The Amendment protects people from \"unreasonable\" seizures, and \"unreasonable\" contemplates \"more\nthan the unnecessary strike of a nightstick, sting of a bullet, [or] thud of a boot.\" Fontana v. Haskin, 262 F.3d 871,\n878 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding police officer's \"sexual verbal and physical predation against a handcuffed\narrestee\" on ride to police station was Fourth Amendment violation). Apart from excessive force, we recognize\nthat \"harassing and abusive behavior\" by an officer towards a detainee during a seizure can, in some cases, rise\n1254 to the level of \"unreasonable\" for Fourth Amendment purposes. See id. at 879. But we stress that not *1254 every\nintrusion, touching, discomfort or embarrassment during an arrest is actionable as a violation of the Fourth\nAmendment. Some of these acts may be provably accidental or just too insignificant and thus within the range of\nthe constitutionally reasonable. Id. at 880; cf. Vinyard v. Wilson, 311 F.3d 1340, 1344, 1348 n. 13 (11th Cir.2002)\n(concluding de minimis force when officer dragged plaintiff inside jail, following arrest, \"either by her shirt, her\narm, or her hair\"); Jones v. City of Dothan, Ala., 121 F.3d 1456, 1460 (11th Cir.1997) (concluding de minimis force\nwhen officers \"slammed\" plaintiff against wall). We conclude that the pertinent fingerprinting conduct is of that\nnature.\n\n\"The overriding function of the Fourth Amendment is to protect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted\nintrusion by the State.\" Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1834, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). We\naccept that Plaintiff was uncomfortable with the fingerprinting process when she was touching the back of Officer\nHighfill with her body. We also accept that Officer Highfill's subjective intentions are unimportant in determining\nwhether the complained-of touching was 00 objectively 00 too much of an affront to Plaintiff's personal privacy and\n97 97\ndignity in a constitutional sense and, therefore, unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \"What is reasonable,\nof course, depends on all of the circumstances surrounding the search or seizure and the nature of the search or\nseizure itself.\" Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 1414, 103 L.Ed.2d 639\n(1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that the touching complained of by Plaintiff 00 given the\n97\nbusiness-like circumstances surrounding the fingerprinting of an arrested person and the limited and coincidental\nnature of the touching 00 was too slight and was within the outside borders of what is reasonable under the Fourth\n97\nAmendment.\nII. State-Law Claim\nPlaintiff also brought a claim against Officer Highfill under Georgia law for assault and battery for the\nfingerprinting. Highfill denies ever using the fingerprinting method alleged and denies altogether taking Plaintiff's\nfingerprints. The district court properly left this factual dispute for a jury to decide.\nWe affirm the district court's denial of state-law official immunity to Officer Highfill on this state-law claim. The\nGeorgia Constitution immunizes state officials from suit for conduct performed in the line of duty if their acts are\n(1) discretionary and done without malice; or (2) ministerial and done without negligence. Ga. Const. art. I, § 2, ¶\n9(d) (amended 1991). Although the jury in this case may ultimately decide the facts differently, we conclude that\nevidence is in the record to support a finding00assuming at this stage that Highfill was the one that fingerprinted\n97\nPlaintiff00that Highfill acted with malice (Plaintiff said she felt \"toyed with\" during the booking process) and acted\n97\nnegligently (officers testified that the fingerprinting method used was inadvisable). Reading the record in Plaintiff's\nfavor, whether Highfill's fingerprinting of Plaintiff in the manner alleged was discretionary or ministerial makes no\ndifference; official immunity would protect him in neither case. Accordingly, Highfill is not entitled to summary\njudgment on this claim.\nConclusion\nGiven the circumstances, we see no constitutional violation in Plaintiff's strip search. So, we reverse the denial of\nsummary judgment to Dispatcher Clouatre on the Fourth Amendment claim; and we reverse the denial of\n1255 summary judgment to *1255 Sheriff Moore, Captain Ausburn and Sergeant Gosnell on the supervisory liability\nclaim. Given the circumstances, the contact with Plaintiff during the fingerprinting process was too slight to\namount to a constitutional violation; so, we reverse the denial of summary judgment to Officer Highfill on this\nfederal claim.\nWe affirm the denial of state-law official immunity to Officer Highfill on the assault and battery claim for the\nfingerprinting.\n[8]\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\n[*] Honorable B. Avant Edenfield, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Georgia, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] For this interlocutory appeal under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, we resolve all the properly disputed facts in accord with\nPlaintiff's version of the facts.\n[2] Georgia defines family violence battery as \"intentionally caus[ing] substantial physical harm or visible bodily\nharm\" to a \"past or present spouse[ ].\" O.C.G.A. § 16-5-23.1(a), (f). A first offense is a misdemeanor; a repeat\noffense is a felony. Id. § 16-5-23.1(f). Plaintiff had never before been charged or arrested under § 16-5-23.1.\n\n[3] Defendants do not dispute that a strip search was performed on Plaintiff or offer an alternative to Clouatre. We\nwill assume at this stage that Clouatre performed the strip search in this case.\n[4] Taylor and Highfill both maintain that Taylor, not Highfill, fingerprinted Plaintiff. Plaintiff contends Highfill\nfingerprinted her, and we assume that to be true on summary judgment.\n[5] We personally question that such a practice violates the Fourth Amendment. See Evans v. Stephens, 407 F.3d\n1272, 1278-79 (11th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (\"Most of us are uncertain that jailers are required to have a reasonable\nsuspicion of weapons or contraband before strip searching 00 for security and safety purposes 00 arrestees bound\n97 97\nfor the general jail population. . . . Never has the Supreme Court imposed such a requirement.\"). For background,\nsee Evans, 407 F.3d at 1284-96 (Carnes, J., concurring specially, joined by Dubina and Hull, JJ.). But we accept\nthat \"reasonable suspicion\" is required by the law of the Circuit.\n[6] Plaintiff does not argue that this search was performed in an abusive manner, and we see no evidence of\nabuse in the record. Cf. Evans, 407 F.3d at 1281.\n[7] \"Claims involving the mistreatment of arrestees or pretrial detainees in custody are governed by the\nFourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause,\" and require a showing of deliberate indifference to a substantial\nrisk of serious harm. Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1490 (1996). Plaintiff asserts protection under the Fourth\nAmendment standard, which is commonly an easier standard for a plaintiff to meet. At the time of the\nfingerprinting, Plaintiff had already been arrested, delivered to the Jail, and had begun 00 but not completed 00 the\n97 97\nbooking process. The original arresting officer had turned Plaintiff over to jailers, and he was not present during\nand did not participate in the events underlying the complaint. The precise point at which a seizure ends (for\npurposes of Fourth Amendment coverage) and at which pretrial detention begins (governed until a conviction by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment) is not settled in this Circuit. We underline that Defendants never argue that the strip\nsearch or fingerprinting was separate from Plaintiff's seizure; so we 00 will assume (for this case) Plaintiff was still\n97\nbeing seized and 00 analyze the claim under the Fourth Amendment.\n97\n[8] Today's decision, in effect, eliminates all federal claims in this case, leaving only Plaintiff's state-law claims.\nWe allow the district court to exercise its discretion, under the Gibbs doctrine, to decide whether or not to\nconsider Plaintiff's state-law claims on remand. See United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86\nS.Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966) (\"Certainly, if the federal claims are dismissed before trial, . . . the state\nclaims should be dismissed as well.\"); Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., 370 F.3d 1086, 1088-89 (11th Cir.2004) (\"The\ndecision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over pendant state claims rests within the discretion of the district\ncourt. We have encouraged district courts to dismiss any remaining state claims when, as here, the federal\nclaims have been dismissed prior to trial.\") (citation omitted).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

HICKS, \nPlaintiff, \nCIVIL ACTION \nvs.  NO. 202-cv-36-WCO \nRICHARD MOORE, individually and \nin his official capacity as Sheriff \nof Habersham County, MICHAEL \nLONG, Individually, JOSHUA \nHIGHFILL, Individually, JENNIE \nCLOUATRE, Individually, JOHN \nTAYLOR, Individually, RUSSELL  = \nGOSNELL, Individually, and BRIAN \nAUSBURN, Individually, \nDefendants. \nORDER \nThis case is before the court for consideration of defendants' motion \nfor summary judgment [33-1] .  Plaintiff Janet Hicks filed suit against \ndefendants, claiming that they subjected her to an illegal strip search in \nviolation of her rights under the Fourth Amendment.  Her complaint \nincludes seven counts.  Count I is a claim against Sheriff Richard Moore \nindividually for violation of plaintiffs civil rights.  Count II is against \ndefendant Habersham County for violation of plaintiffs civil rights. \nAO 72A  J_ \n(Rev.B/82) \n\nCount III is against defendants Long, Clouatre, Highfill, Taylor, Gosnell, \nand Ausburn in their individual capacities for violation of plaintiffs civil \nrights.  Count IV is  a state law claim for assault against defendant \nClouatre .  Count V is a state law claim of invasion of privacy against \ndefendants Long, Clouatre, Highfill,  and Taylor in  their  individual \ncapacities.  Count VI is a state law claim of assault and battery against \ndefendant Highfill in his individual capacity.  Count VII is a state law \nclaim of intentional infliction of emotional distress against defendants \nLong, Clouatre, Highfill, and Taylor.  Count VIII is a claim for injunctive \nrelief against all defendants in all capacities. \nIn her response to defendants'  motion for summary judgment, \nplaintiff withdraws the following claims the assault claims against \ndefendants Long and Taylor,  the invasion of privacy claims against \ndefendant Long, and the claim for intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress against all defendants.  Plaintiff filed a response to defendants' \nmotion on April 24, 2003, and defendants filed a reply on May 12, 2003. \nDefendants have also  filed a notice of their objection to  several of \nplaintiffs statements of material fact. \nz \nAO 72A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nI.  Factual Background \nThe following facts  are taken from the parties'  statements of \nmaterial facts, except where otherwise noted.  OnApril 21, 2001, plaintiff \nJanet Hicks (\"Janet Bryant\" in April 2001) was involved in a domestic \ndispute with her husband at the time, Craig Bryant.  Habersham County \nSheriffs Deputy Michael Long was dispatched to plaintiffs home on a \ndomestic violence call and was backed up by Sergeant John Ferguson. \nDuring his  investigation of the  incident,  Corporal Long questioned \nplaintiff,  Craig Bryant,  and the couple's  two children at the scene. \nCorporal Long also  photographed a scratch sustained by Craig Bryant \nand a cellular phone damaged by plaintiff.  Corporal Long determined \nthat  plaintiff was the  primary aggressor,  but plaintiff denies  this \nallegation,  stating  that the argument started  when Bryant pushed \nplaintiff, almost knocking her down.  Plaintiff claims she responded in \nself defense by hitting Bryant in the shoulder with the inside of her right \nforearm. \n3 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.B/B2) \n\nCorporal Long arrested plaintiff for family violence, battery, and \ninterference with a 911 call.'  Corporal Long did not pat down plaintiff \nduring the arrest, and he testified that he did not consider her to be a \nthreat to himself or to other officers or jail personnel.  (Long Dep.  p.  73.) \nHe then transported plaintiff to  the Habersham County Detention \nCenter, where he turned plaintiff over to the custody of the jailers on \nduty between 530 and 6:15 p.m.  This was about the time that the jailers \nat the detention center had a shift change.  Corporal Long prepared an \nincident.  report and had no further contact with plaintiff. \nPlaintiff was placed in a holding cell for more than thirty minutes. \nShe was later removed and permitted to see her attorney and was then \nreturned to the holding cell.  John Taylor and Joshua Highfill came on \nduty at 545 p.m.  on April 21, 2001.  Taylor was the shift corporal.  Taylor \nand Highfill  are  the  only  two jailers  with whom plaintiff recalls \ninteracting.  After an unspecified length of time, plaintiff was removed \nfrom the holding cell.  At that point, plaintiff was directed to a private, \nwindowless shower room where she was strip searched.  Plaintiff alleges \nThese charges were later dropped. \n4 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.B/B2) \n\nthat defendant Jennie Clouatre was the sheriff's department employee \nwho performed the strip search,  but this has not been conclusively \nestablished by the evidence.  (Clouatre Dep. p.  18> Hicks Dep.  pp.  94-95.) \nDuring the strip search, plaintiff was ordered to remove her clothing, lift \nher breasts, and cough three times while squatting on the floor.  The \nprocedure lasted approximately six minutes.  Plaintiff was then told that \nshe could get dressed and was returned to  the  holding cell.  The \ndemeanor of the woman who strip searched plaintiff was businesslike, \nand it appeared to plaintiff that she was \"just doing her job.\"  (Hicks Dep. \np.  102.) \nIn addition to  the dispute between the par ties  regarding the \nidentity of the woman who strip searched plaintiff, there is also a dispute \nover who gave the order to perform the strip search.  In her deposition \ntestimony, defendant Clouatre testified that she performs strip searches \nonly when instructed to do so by the \"shift corporal over dispatch.\" \n(Clouatre Dep.  p.  15.)  Jennie Clouatre worked as a dispatcher at the \nPlaintiffs Exhibit 2, attached to the deposition of Janet Hicks, is the time \nsheet of Lisa Rogers, another employee of the detention center.  The time \nsheet shows that Rogers was also on duty at the time that plaintiff was strip \nsearched and could have been the employee who strip searched plaintiff. \n5 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\ndetention center and went off duty at 630 p.m. on April 21, 2001 .  John \nTaylor was the shift corporal on April 21, 2001, but he does not recall if \nhe ordered plaintiff to be strip searched.  (Taylor Dep.  pp.  42-43.) \nAfter being strip searched and returned to the holding cell, plaintiff \nwas removed from the holding cell by defendant John Taylor, and she was \nphotographed,  fingerprinted,  and  questioned.  Defendant  Highfill \nobtained the photographs of plaintiff and stated that he was taking \npictures of her \"in case [she] escaped.\"  Plaintiff alleges that defendant \nHighfill laughed when he made this  statement.  In her complaint, \nplaintiff claims that defendant Highfill \"focused the camera on Plaintiffs \nobvious birth defect, making fun of her cleft lip and palate, and took \nseveral humiliating close-up pictures of the defect, supposedly in the \nevent that she \"escaped\" from jail.  (Compl.  120.)  Highfill testified that \nwhen he took the pictures of plaintiff s scar, he was not making fun of her \ncleft palate. \nPlaintiff also alleges  that defendant Highfill made her stand \ndirectly behind him and reach her arms around his midsection in order \nto provide her fingerprints.  Plaintiff claims that while she was giving her \nfingerprints, defendant Highfill pressed her breasts and pelvis against \n6 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\nhim in a way that made her feel uncomfortable.  (Compl.  JJ  21;  Hicks Dep. \npp.  113-114;  116-118.)  The record of plaintiffs fingerprints is signed by \ndefendant Taylor.  Defendant Highfill  testified  that the document \ncontaining an arrestee's fingerprints is always signed by the person who \ntook the  fingerprints.'  (Highfill Dep.  pp.  46,  48-49.)  In addition, \ndefendant Taylor testified that he believed that he was the person who \ntook plaintiffs fingerprints.  Taylor Dep.  p.  44.) Both defendants Taylor \nand Highfill testified that they never had inmates stand behind them \nwhile being fingerprinted.  (Taylor Dep.  p.  45;  Highfill Dep.  p.  48.) \nPlaintiff does not contend that defendants Moore, Ausburn, or \nGosnell were personally involved in her strip search.  Defendant Ausburn \nwas the captain in charge of the jail on April 21, 2001 .  Defendant Gosnell \nwas the jail sergeant on April 21, 2001 .  Plaintiff notes that Gosnell \ntestified that it was his understanding that \"anybody who came through \nthat door, out of that sally port, they were strip searched.\" (Gosnell Dep. \np.  13.) \nAt one point in his deposition testimony, defendant Highfill testified that he \nwas not sure if he had taken plaintiffs fingerprints.  (Highfill Dep.  pp.  46, \n49.)  Based on the signature of John Taylor on the fingerprint card, however, \nhe asserted that he did not take plaintiffs fingerprints.  (Highfill Dep.  pp.  46, \n49.) \n7 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.fl/82) \n\nDefendant Moore was the sheriff of Habersham County at the time \nof plaintiff's arrest and search, having taken office on January 1, 2001 . \nPrior to becoming sheriff, defendant Moore was employed as a deputy \nwith the Habersham County Sheriff's Office for approximately fifteen \nyears.  He was first hired in 1985 as a jailer and was a jailer for two \nyears.  In 1987 he became a certified pence officer and began patrol \nduties.  The Habersham County Sheriffs Office did not have a written \nstrip search policy or procedure when Moore served as a jailer, and Moore \nwas not aware of any strip searches being performed when he was a \njailer.  After Moore became a deputy in 1987 and was later promoted to \nchief investigator, he had no further involvement with the operation of \nthe jail prior to becoming sheriff on January 1, 2001.  When he took office \non January 1, 2001, defendant Moore did not change the written policies \napplicable to the jail that had been adopted by the prior sheriff and had \nbeen in effect since 1998.  Prior to the date of plaintiff s arrest and search, \ndefendant Moore had not reviewed the written policy concerning searches \nat the jail.  The written policy placed additional restrictions on when strip \nsearches could be performed. \n8 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nDefendants claim that Sheriff Moore had not discussed the strip \nsearch practice with any jailer or employee prior to plaintiffs arrest and \nalleged strip search on April 21, 2001 and was not aware that jailers were \nfollowing the unwritten practice of strip searching every detainee placed \nin a holding cell.  Defendants further contend that after the lawsuit was \nfiled in Snvder v.  Moore, et al.,  Case  No.  2:01-cv-181-WCO,  Sheriff \nMoore learned that the practice had begun prior to his taking office and \nhad continued thereafter.  Plaintiff objects to these claims and points out \nthat Sheriff Moore had promised in January 2001 to investigate a claim \nby Barry Lipsitz that he had been unlawfully strip searched.  In addition, \nplaintiff urges that Sheriff Moore was in the immediate vicinity when \nofficers were carrying out the illegal strip search policy.  As such, there \nis a significant dispute between the parties over whether Sheriff Moore \nhad notice of the way strip  searches were being performed at the \ndetention center. \nDefendants indicate that Sheriff Moore relied on Captain Brian \nAusburn, a jail administrator under a prior sheriff, to oversee operations \nin the jail and make sure proper procedures were followed.  When Sheriff \nMoore learned in September of 2001 of the strip search procedure being \nAO 72A \n(Rev.&82) \n\nfollowed in the jail, he instructed his deputies to stop the practice and \nmake sure that all jailers followed the written policy.  According to \nplaintiff, Sheriff Moore's testimony was that he did this in November of \n2001. \nII.  Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment  shall  be  granted  when  \"the  pleadings, \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together \nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any \nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a \nmatter of law.\"  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(c).  Only those claims for which there \nis no need for a factual determination and for which there is a clear legal \nbasis are properly disposed of through summary judgment.  See Celotex \nCorp.  v.  Catrett,  477 U.S.  317 (1986). \nIt is  well settled that a court evaluating a summary judgment \nmotion must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non- \nmovant.  See, e.g.,  Samples v City of Atlanta,  846 F.2d 1328, 1330 (11th \nCir.  1988);  Tinnens v Celotex Corp.,  805 F.2d 949, 953 (11th Cir.  1986), \nrehg denied,  815 F.2d 66 (11th Cir.  1987).  To survive a motion for \nsummary judgment, the non-moving party need only present evidence \n10 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nfrom which the trier of fact might return a verdict in his favor.  Samples, \n846 F.2d at 1330.  However, Rule 56, \"[b]y its very terms. . . .  provides \nthat the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the \nparties  will  not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for \nsummary judgment; the requirement is that there be no .genuine issue of \nmaterial fact.\"  Anderson v.  Liberty Lobby.  Inc.,  477 U.S.  242, 247-48 \n(1986).  The materiality of facts is governed by the relevant substantive \nlaw in the case.  Id.  at 248.  A dispute is genuine if the evidence is such \nthat the factual issues \"may reasonably be resolved in favor of either \nparty.\"  Id.  at 250. \nConsideration of a summary judgment motion does not lessen the \nburden on the non-moving party the non-moving party still bears the \nburden of coming forth with sufficient evidence.  See Earley v.  Champion \nInt'1 Corp.,  907 F.2d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir.  1990).  \"If the non-movant in \na summary judgment action fails to adduce evidence which would be \nsufficient, when viewed in a light most favorable to the non-movant, to \nsupport a jury finding for the non-movant, summary judgment may be \ngranted.\"  Herzog v.  Castle Rock Entertainment,  193 F.3d 1241, (11th \nCir.  1999) (citation omitted). \n11 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.&82) \n\nIn the instant case, defendants' motion can be divided into three \ncategories with several subparts.  The court will consider each one in turn. \nA.  Federal Claims Under Section 1983 \n1 .  Reasonable suspicion \nUnder current law, a strip search of a pre-trial detainee must be \nbased upon reasonable suspicion that the detainee possesses a weapon or \ncontraband.  Wilson v.  Jones,  251 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.  2001). \nDefendants argue that plaintiffs arrest for domestic violence provided \nreasonable  suspicion sufficient  to  allow  a  strip  search.  Therefore, \ndefendants contend that the search was not violative of the Fourth \nAmendment.  As support for this claim, defendants point to the Eleventh \nCircuit case of Cuesta v.  School Bd. of Miami-Dade County, 285 F.3d 962 \n(11th Cir.  2002),  where the  court held  that there was reasonable \nsuspicion to justify a strip search of a student who had participated in \nwriting a pamphlet containing \"violent and threatening language and \nimagery,\" including a reference to shooting the school principal in the \nhead.  Cuesta,  285 F.3d at 970.  Because the plaintiff in Cuesta failed to \nproduce any evidence indicating that the personnel involved in the strip \nt2 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nsearch lacked reasonable suspicion, the court found that her Fourth \nAmendment claim was without merit. Id.  at 970-71 . \nDefendants cite to other cases where the Eleventh Circuit has found \nreasonable suspicion in cases somewhat analogous to the one at issue, but \nthe court is not persuaded by defendants' reasoning because plaintiff \ncorrectly points out that all of the defendants involved in the strip search \nconceded that they did not suspect plaintiff to be in possession of a \nweapon or other contraband.  (Long Dep.  pp.  62-64;  Taylor Dep.  pp.  51 ; \nHicks Dep. pp.  35, 85-86.)  From the deposition testimony, it appears that \nthe sole reason for the strip search was to follow the unwritten practice \nof strip searching every detainee that came into the detention center. \n(Gosnell Dep.  p.  13.)  Defendants urge in their reply brief that plaintiff \nwrongly focuses on the subjective beliefs of the defendants in this case \nand cites the cases of Cuesta and Skurstenis v. Jones,  236 F.3d 678 (11th \nCir.  2000).  The court has reviewed these cases and does not agree with \ndefendants' argument.  The subjective belief of the person performing a \nstrip search is relevant to the reasonable suspicion analysis.  In Cuesta, \nthe court noted that \"[i]f jail officials have reasonable suspicion that an \narrestee is concealing weapons or contraband, then they do not infringe \n13 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.&B2) \n\non her constitutional rights by conducting a strip search.\" Cuesta,  285 \nF.3d at 968.  Furthermore, the court in Cuesta noted that plaintiffs § \n1983 action failed for the reason that the plaintiff \"failed to produce any \nevidence that [the defendants lacked reasonable suspicion that she was \nconcealing weapons or contraband.\" Id. at 970.  The opposite is true in the \ninstant case. \nAdditionally, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Wilson based \nits analysis in part on its determination that \"there [was] no evidence \nthat the officers at Shelby County Jail had reasonable suspicion that \nWilson was concealing weapons or any other type of contraband.\" Wilson, \n251 F.3d at 1343.  The Wilson court therefore concluded that \"because \nWilson was strip searched absent reasonable suspicion, we hold that the \nsearch  .  .  .  violated  the  Fourth Amendment prohibition  against \nunreasonable  searches  and seizures.\"  Id.  Contrary to  defendants' \nassertion,  the  court  thinks  it  entirely  appropriate  to  take  into \nconsideration the fact that none of the defendants who could recall the \nstrip search in this case testified that they had any reasonable suspicion \nthat  plaintiff  was  in  possession  of any  weapons  or  contraband. \nFurthermore, the court is satisfied that this case is  not analogous to \n14 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.B(82) \n\nCuesta,  where  reasonable  suspicion  was  based  on  \"violent  and \nthreatening language and imagery\" contained in a pamphlet.  Cuesta, 285 \nF.3d at 969.  Based on the deposition testimony and factual assertions \nviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, there was nothing \nsurrounding the circumstances of plaintiffs arrest to suggest that she \nmight become  violent  or  could  be  in  possession  of  a  weapon  or \ncontraband.  To the contrary, the evidence demonstrates that plaintiff \nwas cooperative with the detention center personnel and was never \nviolent in any way.  As such, the court is satisfied that plaintiff has \nsatisfied her burden of setting forth evidence to demonstrate the lack of \nreasonable suspicion.  The court declines to grant defendants' motion for \nsummary judgment on this basis. \n2.  Section 1983 supervisory liability claim against defendants \nHabersham County, Moore, Ausburn, and Gosnell \nDefendants point out that plaintiff asserts various theories of § 1983 \nliability against defendants who never personally interacted with her. \nThis includes defendants Moore, Ausburn, and Gosnell.  As defendants \ncorrectly point out, plaintiff must prove § 1983 liability based on failure \n15 \nA0 72A \n(Rev.fl/62) \n\nto train or supervisory liability because there is no responcleat superior \nliability under § 1983. \nCourts must apply a three-prong test to determine a supervisor's \nliability under §  1983 \"(1) whether, in failing adequately to train and \nsupervise subordinates, he was deliberately indifferent to an inmate's \n[constitutional  rights];  (2)  whether  a  reasonable  person  in  the \nsupervisor's position would know that his failure to train and supervise \nreflected  deliberate  indifference;  and (3)  whether his  conduct was \ncausally related to the constitutional infringement by his subordinate.\" \ntreason v.  Kemo,  891 F.2d 829, 836 (11th Cir.  1990).  Defendants first. \nargue that they cannot be liable for failure to train because there is no \nshowing of past constitutional violations or notice of any such violations \nand  that  plaintiff  therefore  cannot  show  that  defendants  were \ndeliberately indifferent to her constitutional rights. \nIn response, plaintiff contends that, as to defendant Moore, he was \nthe final policymaker for the detention center and knew that his officers \nwould have to conduct strip searches and in fact did so.  Rather than \ntesting jailers on their understanding of the written strip search policy, \ndefendant Moore never even posted the policy.  Additionally, plaintiff \n16 \nAO 72A \n(Fev.B/82) \n\nelsewhere contends that defendant Moore did in fact have notice of prior \nstrip searches as a result of a complaint made to Sheriff Moore by Barry \nLipsitz.  Sheriff Moore never investigated this claim.  The facts are \nsufficiently in dispute on this matter to preclude summary judgment in \nfavor of defendant Moore on a theory of supervisory liability. \nAs to  defendant Ausburn, plaintiff points out that,  under his \nsupervision, new jailers were not supervised or properly trained.  New \nemployee orientations \"fell by the wayside\" and stopped altogether in \n1999.  Similarly, plaintiff notes that defendant Gosnell, the jail sergeant \nin charge of all jail staff shifts at the jail, also failed to properly train his \nsubordinates.  Additionally, plaintiff alleges that Barry Lipsitz lodged his \ncomplaint regarding an improper strip search with defendants Ausburn \nand Gosnell as well as with defendant Moore.  Defendant Taylor testified \nthat he asked defendant Gosnell about the strip search practice two or \nthree times and that his response indicated that \"we were to fall back on \nour departmental policy and that he thought that we could get away with \nit.\"  Taylor Dep.  p.  20;  CTosnell Dep.  pp.  21-22.)  Plaintiff argues that all \nthree defendants ignored warning signs and allowed the strip searches \nto flourish.  The court is of the opinion that it is for a jury to decide \n17 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.flW) \n\nwhether these facts amount to deliberate indifference, but that it is clear \nthat a failure to train in this instance, if proven, is clearly connected to \nthe constitutional violation allegedly suffered by plaintiff.  Again, the \ncourt is satisfied that the facts in this case are such that it would not be \nappropriate to grant summary judgment in favor of defendants Ausburn \nand Gosnell under a theory of supervisory liability. \n3.  Section 1983 liability of defendants Taylor, Highfill, and Long \nDefendants take issue with plaintiffs contention that defendants \nTaylor, Highfill, and Long \"ordered or acquiesced in\" the strip search. \nAmend.  Verif.  Coinpl.  TT 19, 41-43.  Defendants assert that defendant \nTaylor did not order the strip search, nor did defendant Highfill.  Nor, \naccording to defendants, is there any evidence that defendant Long had \nany interaction with or any supervisory authority over any deputy. \nAs to the claim for failure to intervene, defendants argue that \nplaintiff has not set forth any evidence that defendants Taylor, Highfill, \nor Long were present or had the opportunity to intervene in the strip \nsearch.  Plaintiff does not respond to this assertion in her response and \ntherefore has not met her burden of showing evidence to the contrary. \nDefendants Taylor, Highfill, and Long are entitled to summary judgment \nis \nAO 72A \n(flev.8/82) \n\non plaintiff's claim that they are liable for violations of plaintiff s Fourth \nAmendment rights in their positions as supervisors or for failure to \nintervene.  The only federal claim advanced against defendants Long and \nTaylor is the instant claim for failure to intervene.  Because plaintiff has \nwithdrawn the state law claims against defendant Long, there are no \noutstanding claims remaining against him.  The only remaining claim \nagainst defendant Taylor is a state law claim of invasion of privacy. \n4.  Qualified immunity \nThe court must determine whether defendants Moore, Ausburn, \nGosnell,  Highfill,  and Clouatre4 are entitled to  qualified immunity. \nQualified  immunity  protects  government  officials  performing \ndiscretionary functions from civil liability if their conduct violates no \n\"clearly  established  statutory  or  constitutional  rights  of which  a \nreasonable person would have known.\"  Harlow v.  Fitzgerald,  457 U.S. \n500,  818 (1982).  First,  the official  must prove that the allegedly \nunconstitutional actions occurred while he was acting within the scope of \nhis discretionary authority.  Evans v.  Hightower,  117 F.3d 1318, 1320 \nAs the court noted above, there are no remaining federal claims against \ndefendants Taylor and Long. \n19 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.&B2) \n\n(11th Cir.  1997).  If the official meets this burden, the plaintiff must \nprove that the official's conduct violated clearly established law.  Id. \nTo establish that the challenged actions were within the scope of \ntheir discretionary authority, defendants must show that their actions \nwere (1) undertaken pursuant to the performance of their duties and (2) \nwithin the scope of their authority.  Harbert Int'1 .  Inc.  v. James,  157 F.3d \n1271, 1282 0 lth Cir.  1998).  To make this showing, defendants must \ndemonstrate \"objective circumstances that would compel [the] conclusion\" \nthat  the complained-of  actions  were undertaken pursuant  to  the \nperformance of their duties and within the scope of their authority.  Id. \n(quoting Barker v.  Norman,  651 F.2d 1107,1124-25 (5th Cir.  Unit A July \n1981)).  If a defendant demonstrates that the actions taken were within \nhis or her discretionary authority, then \"the plaintiff must prove that the \nofficial's conduct violated clearly established law.\" Harbert Intern..  Inc. \nv.  James,  157 F.3d 1271, 12810 1th Cir.  1998). \nDefendants urge  that Moore, Ausburn, Gosnell,  Clouatre,  and \nHighfill all acted within their discretionary authority.  Plaintiff claims \nthat none of these defendants acted within their discretionary authority. \nAs to defendants Moore, Ausburn, and (sosnell,  who are subject  to \n20 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\nplaintiff's  failure  to  train  claim,  the court takes  note of plaintiffs \nargument that although qualified immunity protects all \"but the plainly \nincompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,\" it does not protect \nthose who do not do their job at all.  Mallev v.  Briggs,  475 U.S.  335, 341 \n(1986).  The court employed this same reasoning in the Sn der case and \nfound that an utter failure to ensure proper training and supervision of \nsubordinates is not within a supervisor's discretionary authority.  See \nSnyder v.  Moore, et al.,  Case No.  2:01-cv-181-WCO  Order granting in \npart and denying in part Summary Judgment at 17.) The same reasoning \nis applicable in this case.  The evidence about Sheriff Moore's actions \nhave not changed since the Snyder case.  Additionally, the deposition \ntestimony viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff supports \nplaintiff s claim that defendant Gosnell did not act at all in overseeing the \noperations in the jail.  In fact, it appears from the facts as alleged by \nplaintiff that he was asked at least twice about the strip search policy \nand never did anything but defer to the sheriff. \nThe evidence as it pertains to discretionary authority is less clear \nwith regard to defendant Ausburn.  Plaintiff alleges that defendant \nAusburn \"did not act  at  all,  even when presented with the  clear \n21 \nAO 72A \n(pev.8/82) \n\nconstitutional duties that arise with daily strip searches,\" but does not \nexplain how this is  shown by the facts as they relate  to defendant \nAusburn.  Pl.'s  Resp.  to Defs.'  Mot.  for Summ.  J .  at  15.  Defendant \nAusburn's deposition testimony includes a discussion about Ausburn's \nrealization of the unlawful practice and his efforts to change it, but.  it \nappears from the testimony that this took place after the strip search \ninvolved in this case.  (Ausburn Dep.  pp.  44-55.)  Defendants, who are \ncharged with the burden of demonstrating evidence that defendant \nAusburn was acting within his discretionary authority, do not point to \nany evidence of his actions with regard to the strip search practice.  They \nsimply argue that it is improper to look to a failure to act as a basis for \ndenying qualified immunity.  Though the court agrees that it is  not \nlegally correct to base a determination regarding discretionary authority \non facts solely relevant to liability, defendants have ignored this court's \ndecision  on this very issue  in the  Snyder case.  While  the  term \n\"discretionary authority\" encompasses essentially every law enforcement \naction that could be \"done for a proper purpose,\" the term is meaningless \nif the defendant at issue has done nothing.  Harbert,  157 F.3d at 1282. \nIt is not within a law enforcement official's discretionary authority to \n22 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.fliB2) \n\nsimply fail to do his job, and it is on that basis that the court finds that \ndefendants Moore, Gosnell, and Ausburn lack discretionary authority for \npurposes of qualified immunity. \nThe court next turns to the question of whether defendants Clouatre \nand Highfill were acting within their discretionary authority for the \npurposes of qualified immunity.  As to defendant Clouatre, if the court \nassumes that she was in fact the person who carried out the strip search \nof plaintiff, it is clear that, had the strip search been \"done for a proper \npurpose\" (i.e .  had there been reasonable suspicion), it would have been \nreasonably related to the outer perimeter of her discretionary duties.  Id. \nAs to defendant Highfill, the remaining allegations against him \npertain to actions taken while allegedly fingerprinting plaintiff.'  If the \ncourt  assumes that  defendant Highfill  did  in  fact  take  plaintiffs \nfingerprints, then the question is whether his actions were reasonably \nrelated to or within the outer perimeter of his discretionary duties.  The \ncourt is satisfied that the \"method\" of fingerprinting alleged by plaintiff \nAs discussed above, the court will grant summary judgment on the claim \nagainst defendant Highfill stemming from his alleged involvement in the \nstrip search. \n23 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\nis not within defendant Highfill's discretionary authority.  The manner \nof fingerprinting alleged by plaintiff could not be reasonably related to \ndefendant Highfill's discretionary duties;  forcing a female detainee to \nwrap her arms around a jailer's midsection and therefore press her entire \nbody against him is egregious behavior and not at all necessary or related \nto the carrying out of an official duty.  Id.  Defendant Highfill is therefore \nnot entitled to qualified immunity on this basis. \nThe next issue is whether plaintiff has proven that the conduct of \ndefendant Clouatre violated clearly established law.  It is this issue over \nwhich the parties have a dispute.  Defendants claim that, as of April 21, \n2001, it was not clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity \nthat there must be reasonable suspicion that an arrestee is concealing \nweapons or contraband in order to justify a strip search.  The Wilson \ndecision which made this rule the law was decided after the strip search \nin this case took place.  It therefore does not operate to strip the officials \nin this case of qualified immunity.  The dispute is over whether \"dicta\" in \n`'  The court again notes that plaintiff is the only person who claims her \nfingerprints were taken this way.  Both defendants Taylor and Highfill claim \nthat. fingerprints are never obtained in this manner nor have they ever \nobtained an arrestee's fingerprints in this manner. \n24 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\nthe Skurstenis case asserting that strip searches absent reasonable \nsuspicion are unconstitutional can operate to make this rule \"clearly \nestablished\" for purposes of qualified immunity.  Defendants claim it \ncannot.  Plaintiff claims it can. \nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals \"has held that dicta cannot \nclearly establish the law for qualified immunity purposes.\"  Jones v. \nCannon,  174 F.3d 1271, 1288 n.  11 (11th Cir.  1999) (internal citations \nomitted).  In Skurstenis v.  Jones,  the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals \nwas faced with a blanket strip search policy like the one at issue in the \ninstant case and joined \"every other circuit which has had the occasion \nto review a similar policy and holds such policy to be unconstitutional.\" \nSkurstenis,  236 F.3d at 682.  The court went on, however, to find that \nthere was reasonable suspicion under the facts of the case and therefore \ndetermined that the strip search at issue was justified.  Id. \nIn Hope v.  Pelzer,  536 U.S.  730, 739 (2002), the Supreme Court \nnoted that, \"[f]or a constitutional right to be clearly established,  its \ncontours `must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official  would \nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right.  This is not to say \nthat an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very \n25 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.&B2) \n\naction in question has been held unlawful . . .  but it is to say that in light \nof the pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent.\"' Hone,  536 \nU.S. at 739 kiting Mitchell v.  Forsvth,  472 U.S.  511, 535 n.  12 (1985), and \nquoting Anderson v.  Creighton,  483 U.S.  635, 640 (1987)).  The Court in \nHoue quoted Anderson v.  Creighton for the proposition that \"general \nstatements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear \nwarning, and in other instances a general constitutional rule already \nidentified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the \nspecific conduct in question, even though `the very action in question has \n[not] been previously held unlawful.\"'  Hone,  536 U.S.  at 741 (quoting \nAnderson,  483 U.S.  at 640 (internal citation omitted)).  The Ho e court \nthen turned to the question of whether the respondents in that case had \n\"fair warning that their alleged treatment of Hope was unconstitutional.\" \nHope, 536 U.S.  at 741. \nIn reaching the conclusion that there was \"fair warning\" that the \n\"hitching post\" treatment at issue in Hoe was unconstitutional, the \nCourt relied on several authorities.  First, the court observed that the \nviolation in this case was so obviously unconstitutional that the Supreme \nCourt's Eighth Amendment cases should have been sufficient warning. \n26 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.B/g2) \n\nId.  Next, the Court found that \"binding Eleventh Circuit precedent, an \nAlabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) regulation,  and a DOJ \nreport informing the ADOC of the constitutional infirmity in its use of the \nhitching post\" were sufficient to allow the Court to conclude that the \n\"conduct violated `clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of \nwhich a reasonable person would have known.\"'  Id,  at  742 (quoting \nHarlow v.  Fitzgerald,  457 U.S.  800, 818 (1982)). \nAfter discussing the binding precedent.  of Gates v.  Collier,  501 F.2d \n1291 (5th Cir.  1974),' the Court also noted that \"[tlhe reasoning, though \nnot the holding, in a case decided by the Eleventh Circuit in 1987 sent the \nsame message to reasonable officers in that Circuit.\" Id.  (citing Ort v. \nWhite,  813 F.2d 318 Qlth Cir.  1987)).  The Court in Hope noted the \npremise in Ort that \"`physical abuse directed at [a]  prisoner after he \nterminates his resistance to authority would constitute an actionable \neighth amendment violation.\"  Id.  (quoting Ort, 813 F.2d at 324).  The \nCourt went on to find that, even though the facts of the two cases were \nnot  identical,  the  premise  stated  in  Ort  nonetheless  had  clear \nIn Bonner v.  City of Prichard,  661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.  1981) (en banc), \nthe Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former \nFifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. \n27 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\napplicability in Hone.  Id.  at 743.  The Court then concluded that \"Ort \ntherefore gave fair warning to the respondents that their conduct crossed \nthe line of what is constitutionally permissible.\" Id. \nThe Court in Hone therefore relied in part on the reasoning, rather \nthan the holding, of a case to find \"fair warning\" for purposes of qualified \nimmunity.  In Vinyard v.  Wilson,  the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals \npointed out that the  reasoning in  Ort along with the DOJ report \ncondemning the hitching post practice \"only strengthened the fair notice \nor warning which the Hope Court had already decided was given by \nGates v.  Collier; neither the DOJ report nor Ort's reasoning were held in \nHope to be sufficient, apart from Gates,  to afford officials the required \nfair and clear notice or warning.\" Vinvard v.  Wilson,  311 F.3d 1340, 1354 \nn.  27 U lth Cir. 2002). \nDespite the Eleventh Circuit's  assertion in  Vinyard that the \nreasoning in Ort standing alone was insufficient to afford fair and clear \nnotice  or warning,  this  court.  thinks  that  the  instant  situation  is \ndistinguishable.  The statement in Skurstenis that reasonable suspicion \nis required for a strip search is a clear statement of the law that reflects \nthe law as it stands in every other circuit to address this issue.  If the \n2a \nAO 72A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\ncourt were to view this  statement as unbinding dicta  for qualified \nimmunity purposes, then the result would be that the law would never \nbecome \"clearly established\" until a court in this circuit was presented \nwith a case in which there was no reasonable suspicion.  If this were the \ncase,  then a  finding of qualified  immunity would be predicated on \nwhether the facts of a case match a legal standard as stated in \"dicta\" or \nwhether the facts represent an exception to that standard.  In other \nwords, the effect would be that the \"dicta\" in Skurstenis could not become \n\"clearly established\" law until the Eleventh Circuit was presented in \nWilson with a case in which there was no reasonable suspicion even \nthough the legal principle guiding both cases was exactly the same.  The \ncourt is of the opinion that the interpretation of \"clearly established\" \nadvanced by defendants would improperly link qualified immunity to the \nway in which court opinions are worded, regardless of their obvious legal \nimplications.  The court therefore finds that defendants' contention on \nthis issue is without merit. \nIn addition, this court is not entirely convinced that the statement \nof the law in Skurstenis is dicta in the first place .  In order to reach its \ndecision that the search was justified based on reasonable suspicion, the \n29 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.&82) \n\ncourt had to first determine that reasonable suspicion was a prerequisite \nto a lawful strip search.  In that sense, the court views this statement as \nnecessary to the holding in Skurstenis and therefore not dicta.  In any \nevent, under the law as stated by the Supreme Court in Hope,  the court \nis satisfied that the rule announced in Skurstenis was sufficient to render \nthe law on strip searches clearly established at the time of plaintiff s strip \nsearch. \nBecause defendants have not demonstrated that defendants Moore, \nAusburn, and Gosnell were acting within their discretionary authority \nwhen they failed to train their subordinates, these three defendants are \nnot entitled to qualified immunity, and the failure to train claim against \nthem remains.  Defendant Clouatre was acting within her discretionary \nauthority but, at the time of the strip search of plaintiff, it was clearly \nestablished that strip searches were unconstitutional if performed absent \nreasonable suspicion that the person to be searched was in possession of \nweapons or contraband.  Therefore, she is  not entitled to  qualified \nimmunity on plaintiffs civil rights claim.  As to defendant Highfill, he \nwas not acting within his discretionary authority.  In addition, his alleged \nbehavior while taking plaintiffs fingerprints is  so egregious as to be \n30 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.&B2) \n\nviolative of plaintiffs clearly established rights.  See Hone,  536 U.S.  at \n739-41 .  Therefore, defendants Moore, Ausburn, Gosnell, Clouatre, and \nHighfill are not entitled to qualified immunity with regard to the federal \nclaims lodged against them. \nB.  State Law Claims \nThere are three state law claims that remain pending in this case. \n1.  Assault - Jennie Clouatre \nPlaintiff alleges that defendant Clouatre assaulted her when she \nrequired plaintiff to submit to an unconstitutional strip search.  The \nOfficial Code of Georgia provides that \"Ca]ny violent injury or illegal \nattempt to commit a physical injury upon a person is a tort for which \ndamages may be recovered.\" O.C.G.A.  § 50-1-14.  In addition, \"an actual \ntouching is not a necessary element of the tort of assault.\"  Wallace v. \nStringer,  250 Ga.  App.  850, 853 (2001).  In Georgia, an assault occurs \nwhen \"all the apparent circumstances, reasonably viewed, are such as to \nlead a person reasonably to apprehend a violent injury from the unlawful \nact of another . . . . ..  Capitol T.V.  Serv..  Inc.  v.  Derrick,  163 Ga.  App.  65, \n65 (1982).  Although the question of what a reasonable person might \napprehend from this situation is a question of fact for the jury, the court \n31 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.&82) \n\nstill finds it appropriate to grant summary judgment on this claim on the \nbasis of official immunity. \nThe Georgia Constitution provides that state officials being sued in \ntheir official capacities are immune from suit regarding discretionary acts \ndone without malice and ministerial acts that are not negligent.  GA \nCONST. art. I, § 2, c1.  9(e) (amended 1991);  Woodard v. Laurens County, \n265 Ga.  404,  406 (1995).  For purposes of  official  immunity, \"\"[a] \ndiscretionary act calls for the exercise of personal deliberation  and \njudgment, which in turn entails examining the facts, reaching reasoned \nconclusions, and acting on them in a way not specifically directed.\"' Dent \nof Corrections v. Lamaine, 233 Ga. App.  271, 273 (1998) (quoting Vertner \nv. Gerber,  198 Ga.  App. 645, 646 (1991)).  In contrast, a ministerial act is \none that is  \"simple, absolute,  and definite,  arising under conditions \nadmitted or proved to exist, and requiring merely the execution of a \nspecific duty.\"  Phillips v.  Walls,  242 Ga.  App.  309, 311 (2000).  In the \ninstant case, the facts demonstrate that when Clouatre allegedly strip \nsearched plaintiff, she was doing so under orders from a supervisor and \ndid not exercise any personal deliberation or judgment in doing so.  The \ncourt  is  satisfied,  therefore,  that  her  actions  were  ministerial. \n32 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.fl/82) \n\nAdditionally, although her actions may have been unlawful, there is no \nevidence to  show that the  strip search was performed negligently. \nAccordingly, defendant Clouatre is entitled to official immunity from \nplaintiffs claim of assault. \n2.  Assault and battery - Joshua Highfill \nPlaintiff contends that Joshua Highfill assaulted and battered her \nten times while taking her fingerprints.  Amend. Verif.  Compl.  1121, 56. \nPlaintiff alleges that she felt like  she was being \"toyed with\" when \ndefendant Highfill gratuitously pulled her breasts and pelvis into his \nback while fingerprinting her.  (Hicks Dep.  pp.  113-119.)  Defendant \ndismisses plaintiffs allegations as \"frivolous.\" Again, this factual dispute \nis more appropriately left for a jury and is not subject to resolution on \nsummary judgment because defendant Highfill is not entitled to official \nimmunity from this claim.  Assuming that defendant Highfill took \nplaintiffs fingerprints in the manner stated by plaintiff,  his decision to \naccomplish this task in a way different from the general practice renders \nthis action discretionary.  Assuming plaintiffs allegations are true, the \ncourt is unwilling to find at this time that a decision to take fingerprints \n33 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.fl/82) \n\nin such an invasive manner is without malice.  Defendant Highfill is not \nentitled to summary judgment on this claim. \n3.  Invasion of privacy \nPlaintiff alleges that defendants Clouatre, Highfill, and Taylor have \ninvaded her privacy by intruding into her seclusion in a manner that \nwould be offensive to a reasonable person.  The tort of intrusion most \ncommonly involves  an intrusion  that  is  \"physical,  analogous to  a \ntrespass.\"  See, e.g\u001e  Kobeck v.  Nabisco, Inc.,  166 Ga.  App.  652, 654 \n(1983).  Any \"intrusion\" by defendants Highfill or Taylor clearly was not \nphysical since they were not present when the search occurred.  There is, \nhowever, an \"extension of the tort beyond physical invasion to include \nprying and intrusion that wo uld be offensive or objectionable to  a \nreasonable person.\"  Pospicil v.  Burg Office, Inc.,  71 F.  Supp.2d 1346, \n1361 (N.D.  Ga.  1999) (citing Yarbray v. Southern Bell Tel.  & Tel.  Co.,  261 \nC=a.  703, 705 (1991)).  \"Thus, the tort includes unauthorized surveillance, \nsuch as eavesdropping or wiretapping.\"  Id.  (citation omitted).  There \nappear to be, however, \"no Georgia cases recognizing a cause of action for \nintrusion into `psychological sanctity' or an inner `sphere of privacy.\"' Id. \nThere is no evidence in this case, however, that defendants Taylor or \n34 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.8182) \n\nHighfill played any role in causing plaintiff to be strip searched.  Though \nit appears that someone gave an order for plaintiff to be strip searched, \nthere is no evidence to show who did this.  Absent any such evidence, the \ncourt will not allow the claim for invasion of privacy against defendants \nHighfill and Taylor to survive a motion for summary judgment. \nDefendant Clouatre claims that the is immune from suit on the \nclaim for invasion of privacy under the doctrine of official immunity.  For \nthe same reason that she is entitled to official immunity on the assault \nclaim, defendant Clouatre is entitled to official immunity on the invasion \nof privacy claim. \nC.  Injunctive relief \nDefendants claim in their motion for  summary judgment that \nplaintiff's request for injunctive relief, if granted, would be tantamount \nto an order that defendants \"obey the law\" as established by Wilson v. \nJones,  251 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.  2001).  Because they claim that \nsuch an injunction is  unnecessary, defendants request that summary \njudgment be granted on this claim.  Plaintiff has not responded to this \nargument, and the court is satisfied that defendants' argument on this \nissue is correct.  There is nothing presented in this case to show that \n35 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.8/B2) \n\ndefendants will commit the same constitutional violation against plaintiff \nin the future, and plaintiff may not seek injunctive relief in general.  At \nany rate, plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law in the form of this \nlawsuit for money damages.  Summary judgment will be granted on \nplaintiff's claim for injunctive relief. \nIII.  Conclusion \nDefendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED in part and \nGRANTED in part [33-1] .  Summary judgment is DENIED as to the \n§ 1983 claims against defendants Moore, Gosnell, Ausburn, Highfill, and \nClouatre.  Summary judgment is also DENIED as to the claim of assault \nand battery against defendant Highfill.  As to all other claims on which \ndefendants have moved for summary judgment, summary judgment is \nhereby GRANTED.  The clerk is directed to set this case for trial at the \nearliest possible date. \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this  2d day of June, 2003. \n\"n A . \nWilliam C.  O'Kelley \nSenior United States \n36 \nAO 72A \n(Rev.B/B2) ",
