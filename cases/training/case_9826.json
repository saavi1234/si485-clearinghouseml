      "text": "735 F.2d 391 (1984)\nCraig HILL, Plaintiff-Appellant,\nv.\nRobert BOGANS and The City and County of Denver, Defendants-Appellees.\nNo. 81-2503.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.\nMay 30, 1984.\n392 *392 David M. Berrett of Kleh, Himelspach, Berrett & Will, Denver, Colo., for plaintiff-appellant.\nTheodore S. Halaby, Denver, Colo. (Michael P. Bahr, Denver, Colo., with him on brief) of Halaby & Bahr, Denver,\nColo., for defendants-appellees.\n[*]\nBefore McWILLIAMS and LOGAN, Circuit Judges, and CHILSON, District Judge.\nLOGAN, Circuit Judge.\nPlaintiff Craig Hill sued police officer Robert Bogans and the City and County of Denver for damages under 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1983. Hill alleged violations of his rights protected under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments\nto the United States Constitution. He also asserted pendent claims under the Colorado Constitution.\nOn April 16, 1979, a county court judge in Denver issued a bench warrant for Hill's arrest for failure to appear on\ncharges of speeding and violating a license restriction. On June 25, 1979, Hill appeared in county court, pleaded\nguilty to a reduced charge of speeding, and paid an eighteen dollar fine.\nOn February 1, 1980, Bogans, a Denver police officer, stopped Hill for driving with an expired automobile\ninspection sticker. In accordance with police procedures, Bogans made a routine warrant check on Hill by calling\nthe police station. After being informed that there was an outstanding bench warrant on Hill, Bogans arrested Hill,\nhandcuffed him, and transported him to the police station.\nAt the time of his arrest, Hill told Bogans that he had cleared the speeding charge that was the subject of the\n393 warrant *393 and asked Bogans to verify the validity of the warrant. Bogans verified the warrant over the police\nradio and again upon arrival at the warrant desk. In fact, the warrant had been withdrawn in June 1979, and\npresumably Bogans would have learned that fact if he had contacted the county court.\nAfter Bogans delivered Hill to the jail, Hill was given a \"pat search\" by one of the sheriff's deputies. Hill was then\ntransferred to a holding area for fingerprinting and photographs. At the holding area Hill made several phone\ncalls, including calls to arrange for his bail. Notwithstanding Hill's assurance to one of the officers that bail was on\nthe way he was transferred \"upstairs\" to the prison area. When the elevator doors opened Hill stepped into a\nlobby area where he observed ten to twelve people in the immediate vicinity. A guard asked Hill to face the wall\nimmediately across from the elevators and to drop his pants and undershorts. The guards examined his backside\nand his pants, without touching him, and then permitted Hill to pull up his shorts and trousers. This search\n[1]\nprocedure was apparently in accordance with procedures applied to all prisoners in the jail.  Shortly thereafter\nHill was released when his wife arrived and posted bail. Five days later the county court called Hill and told him\nthat a mistake had been made and that he could come to the station and claim his bond.\nI\nHill argues that by failing to check the validity of the warrant when requested to do so, Officer Bogans violated his\ncivil rights. We disagree. Unless a warrant is facially invalid an officer has no constitutional duty to independently\ndetermine its validity. See Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 145-46, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2694-95, 61 L.Ed.2d 433\n\n(1979) (\"The Constitution does not guarantee that only the guilty will be arrested.... [W]e do not think a sheriff\nexecuting an arrest warrant is required by the Constitution to investigate independently every claim of innocence,\nwhether the claim is based on mistaken identity or a defense such as lack of requisite intent.\"). In judging the\nimmunity of Officer Bogans we use an objective standard of good faith. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,\n815-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2737-39, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Bogans acted reasonably in relying on routine police\nprocedures for establishing the existence of an outstanding warrant. Bogans should not be held responsible for\nthe failure of county personnel to clear the warrant from the records.\nII\nHill asserts against the City and County of Denver that the search at the jail violated his Fourth Amendment right\nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. In Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d\n447 (1979), the Supreme Court held that routine strip searching of pretrial detainees is not a per se violation of\nthe Fourth Amendment. The Court stated that determining the propriety of a strip search \"requires a balancing of\nthe need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must\n394 consider the scope of *394 the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for\ninitiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. Bell upheld the Metropolitan\nCorrectional Center's practice of subjecting each prisoner to a visual body cavity inspection after every contact\nvisit with a person from outside the institution. The Court noted that inmate attempts to smuggle money, drugs,\nweapons, and other contraband into the Metropolitan Correctional Center were documented in the record.\nAfter reviewing the circumstances surrounding the search in the case at bar, we reverse the trial court's ruling\nthat the search complied with the Fourth Amendment, and we remand for a determination of appropriate\ndamages against the City and County of Denver. In reaching this decision we agree with the analysis of the\nFourth Circuit in Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981),cert. denied,455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71\nL.Ed.2d 653 (1982). In Logan a female attorney, after being arrested on a charge of driving while intoxicated, was\ntaken into a holding cell and subjected to a visual strip search. The search was conducted pursuant to the\nArlington County Detention Center's established policy of routinely strip searching all persons held at the\ndetention center for weapons or contraband. Id. at 1010. In holding this practice unconstitutional the court wrote,\n\"On the undisputed and stipulated evidence, Logan's strip search bore no such discernible\nrelationship to security needs at the Detention Center that, when balanced against the ultimate\ninvasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably be thought justified. At no time would\nLogan or similar detainees be intermingled with the general jail population; her offense, though not\na minor traffic offense, was nevertheless one not commonly associated by its very nature with the\npossession of weapons or contraband; there was no cause in her specific case to believe that she\nmight possess either; and when strip-searched, she had been at the Detention Center for one and\none-half hours without even a pat-down search. An indiscriminate strip search policy routinely\napplied to detainees such as Logan along with all other detainees cannot be constitutionally\njustified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security consideration.\"\nId. at 1013. Accord Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 490-91 (E.D.Wis.1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980).\nAlthough Hill was detained in a separate jail cell, he was briefly intermingled with the prison population. However,\nintermingling is only one factor to consider in judging the constitutionality of a strip search. See Smith v.\nMontgomery County, Maryland, 547 F.Supp. 592, 598-99 (D.Md.1982). No other conceivable justification exists\nfor the strip search in this case. There were no circumstances here indicating that Hill might possess either a\nweapon or drugs. Hill was arrested while on his way to work at about 7:30 a.m. for an outstanding speeding ticket\nand violation of a restriction on his driver's license. These are not offenses associated with the concealment of\nweapons or contraband in a body cavity. In fact, a peculiar aspect of the strip search in this case is that the officer\ndid not carefully examine Hill's body cavities, but instead merely looked in his trousers and at his buttocks. Almost\nanything that the examining officer could have found through this procedure would already have been discovered\nduring the pat down search that had been conducted on Hill's arrival at the jail.\n\nIn addition to considering the justification for a strip search, Wolfish requires us to consider the scope of the\nparticular intrusion and the manner and place in which it is conducted. 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nAlthough the search conducted in this case was not as humiliating as a full body cavity search, Hill was required\nto submit to the search while standing and facing a wall in a room in which ten to twelve people were milling\n395 about. A jail's desire to maintain security, to avoid *395 charges of discriminatory treatment, and to promote\nadministrative convenience simply does not justify routine strip searches in a public area of persons detained for\nminor traffic offenses.\nWe affirm the trial court's judgment dismissing Hill's claim against Officer Bogans; we reverse the judgment\nagainst the City and County of Denver on the strip search count and remand for further proceedings. Bogans'\ncosts are to be paid by plaintiff Hill; the other costs are to be paid by the City and County of Denver. It is so\nordered.\n[*] The Honorable Hatfield Chilson, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Colorado, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] We note that Colo.Rev.Stat. ยง 16-3-405 now outlaws strip searches of the type performed in this case. Section\n16-3-405 provides, in pertinent part, \n\"(1) No person arrested for a traffic or a petty offense shall be strip searched, prior to arraignment, unless there is\nreasonable belief that the individual is concealing a weapon or a controlled substance or that the individual, upon\nidentification, is a parolee or an offender serving a sentence in any correctional facility in the state or that the\nindividual is arrested for driving while under the influence of drugs.\n(2) As used in this section, `strip search' means having an arrested person remove or arrange some or all of his\nor her clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of the genitals, buttocks, anus, or female breasts of such\nperson.\n(3) Any strip search that is conducted shall be performed by a person of the same sex as the arrested person and\non premises where the search cannot be observed by persons not physically conducting the search.\"\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
