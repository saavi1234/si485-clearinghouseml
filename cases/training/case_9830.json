Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked for compensatory and punitive damages.   One plaintiff claimed Defendant Officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights when they arrested him, searched him, and impounded and inventoried his car.  The second plaintiff claimed Defendant Officers violated her Fourth Amendment rights when they arrested her and ordered that she be stripped searched.  Plaintiffs claimed Peachtree City adopted a policy that caused the deprivation of their constitutional rights. </p><p>According to the 11th Circuit (Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11th Cir. 1992)), Defendants arrested plaintiffs for loitering and truancy.  Defendant patted down the male plaintiff and then brought both plaintiffs to the police station.  Two female officers then strip-searched the female, fourteen-year-old plaintiff.  The officers ordered her to strip down to her panties, found no contraband, and then released her.  Her charges were later dismissed.</p><p>On May 25, 1990, Defendants moved for summary judgment.</p><p>On October 9, 1990, the District Court (Judge G. Ernest Tidwell) granted summary judgment to Defendants on all issues except whether Plaintiff suffered compensatory damages from her strip search.  The Court found: (1) Defendants did not violate Plaintiffs' constitutional rights; (2) the City did not have a policy, custom, or ordinance that caused a deprivation of rights; (3) Defendant Officers were protected by qualified immunity; and (4) Defendant Officers' conduct was not callously indifferent to Plaintiffs' constitutional rights and therefore Defendants were not liable for punitive damages.  Plaintiffs and Defendants appealed.</p><p>On May 14, 1992, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges Joseph W. Hatchett, Joel F. Dubina and John C. Godbold) affirmed.  The Court found: (1) Officers searched Plaintiff in the least intrusive manner because female officers searched her in a private room and did not search her body cavities.  (2) Officers had reasonable suspicion to search Plaintiff because they suspected that drinking and drug activity regularly occurred where they arrested Plaintiffs; one Officer saw the male Plaintiff give the female Plaintiff something; Plaintiff appeared extremely nervous; Defendants thought that females were more likely than males to conceal contraband on their persons; Plaintiff's friend's mother suspected the friend was using drugs; and Defendants suspected Plaintiff might have contraband on her person.  Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11th Cir. 1992).</p><p></p>",

In so holding, we affirm the\ndistrict court.\nI. FACTS\nBefore February 8, 1989, the Peachtree City, Georgia Council and its mayor, Fred Brown, enacted a drug and\nalcohol abuse plan which the Peachtree City Manager, the Chief of Police, and the Mayor of Peachtree City\ndeveloped. The plan provided for increased vehicle stops with emphasis on teenage drug offenders. At the city\ncouncil meeting where Mayor Brown announced the plan, he stated: \"[W]e will take whatever steps are\nnecessary to obtain the desired results. We undoubtedly will inconvenience many law abiding citizens.\"\nAt approximately 1:30 p.m. on February 8, 1989, Officer Chris Matson of the Peachtree City Police Department\nobserved two cars parked in an otherwise empty parking lot behind a church. Matson turned his car into the\nchurch parking lot to investigate, and as he did so the cars attempted to leave. Recognizing that one of the cars\nbelonged to James Justice, a sixteen-year-old teenager, Matson stopped Justice's car, and upon approaching it,\nsaw Justice give something to the only other occupant in the car, Lazena Simon, a fourteen year old girl.\nWhen Matson asked Justice and Simon why they were not in school, they replied that they had their parents'\npermission to be absent from school. Matson also inquired as to why Justice and Simon were parked in the back\nof the church parking lot. Justice, a member of the church, informed Matson that he was in the church's parking\nlot because he had stopped to check a loose tire which the driver of the other recently departed car had told him\nabout. After hearing this explanation, Matson examined the tire, and it appeared that the tire had not been\nhandled recently. Matson radioed his headquarters and arranged for Juvenile Officer Keith Dryden to come to the\nchurch parking lot. After arriving at the parking lot, Dryden radioed Justice and Simon's high school, and school\nauthorities informed Dryden that Justice and Simon had told school authorities they were absent due to illness.\n190 Dryden radioed the police station and requested that a police officer contact Justice's and Simon's *190 parents\nand tell the parents to pick up their children at the police station.\n\nAfter Matson and Dryden informed the teenagers that they were under arrest for loitering and truancy, Matson\nconducted a pat-down search of Justice and placed him in the back seat of the patrol car. Additionally, Matson\narranged to have Justice's car impounded, towed to the police station, and inventoried. Although Matson\nsearched Simon's purse, neither Matson nor Dryden conducted a pat-down search of Simon before taking her to\nthe police station. The parking lot searches did not produce any incriminating evidence.\nAfter arriving at the police station, Dryden requested two female police officers to strip search Simon. Although\nSimon's mother had arrived at the police station before the strip search, the officers kept Simon from her mother.\nAfter carrying Simon to a room where no persons were present, the officers ordered Simon to strip down to her\npanties. Simon complied with the officers' instructions. The officers found no contraband, and released Simon\ninto her mother's custody. The charges of loitering and truancy were later dismissed \"in the best interest of\njustice.\"\nOn June 12, 1989, Charles Justice, as next friend of James Justice, and Keith Simon, as next friend of Lazena\nSimon, filed suit against Peachtree City, Keith Dryden, and Chris Matson in their individual and official capacities\n(the \"Peachtree group\"). The complaint alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and sought compensatory and\npunitive damages. Justice alleged that Matson and Dryden violated his constitutional rights when they arrested\nhim, searched him, and impounded and inventoried his car. Simon alleged that Matson and Dryden violated her\nconstitutional rights when they arrested her and ordered that she be stripped searched. Additionally, Justice and\nSimon alleged that Peachtree City, violated their constitutional rights when it adopted a policy that caused the\ndeprivation of their constitutional rights.\nThe Peachtree group moved for summary judgment arguing that: (1) its actions did not violate Justice or Simon's\nconstitutional rights; (2) the city did not have a policy, custom, or ordinance that caused a deprivation of rights; (3)\nqualified immunity protected Dryden and Matson; and (4) it cannot be liable for punitive damages because\nMatson and Dryden's conduct did not rise to the level of calloused indifference to constitutional rights. The district\ncourt granted summary judgment for the Peachtree group on all issues, except the Peachtree group's motion on\nthe issue of whether Simon suffered compensatory damages arising out of the strip search. The district court\nheard this final issue on March 26, 1991, and ruled for the Peachtree group.\nII. ISSUES\nOn appeal, Justice and Simon present the following issues: (1) whether the district court erred in ruling that the\nstrip search was reasonable; (2) whether the district court properly ruled that the police officers did not violate\nSimon and Justice's clearly established constitutional rights; and (3) whether the district court properly granted\nthe motion for summary judgment on the issue of the Peachtree group's liability for punitive damages.\nIII. CONTENTIONS\nThe Peachtree group contends that Simon's strip search was constitutionally permissible because the police\nofficers possessed a reasonable suspicion that Simon was concealing contraband. Additionally, the Peachtree\ngroup contends that the manner in which they conducted the strip search, the justification for initiating it, the\nplace in which they conducted it, and the limited scope of the intrusion supports their contention that the strip\nsearch was constitutional. The Peachtree group also contends that Simon failed to prove that the police officers'\nactions were pursuant to a policy or custom requiring the strip searching of juvenile females charged with truancy\nand loitering. The Peachtree group contends that the district court properly granted the motion for summary\n191 judgment because Officers Dryden and Matson acted in good faith and did not violate the *191 juveniles' clearly\nestablished constitutional rights. Thus, the officers are entitled to qualified immunity. In addition, the Peachtree\ngroup contends that the Supreme Court limited a city's liability under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to compensatory\ndamages.\nSimon argues that the district court erred in failing to rule that the strip search was per se unreasonable and\nviolative of the Fourth Amendment. She emphasizes that the officers lacked probable cause to conduct a strip\n\nsearch, and the circumstances surrounding the strip search did not fit into an established exception to the warrant\nrequirement. Specifically, Simon argues that because she is a juvenile arrested for minor offenses, she could\nhave only been subjected to a strip search if the officers had probable cause to believe she was concealing\nweapons or contraband which posed a threat to the safety and security of the jail.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides, in pertinent part: \"The right of the people to be\nsecured in their persons ... against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated....\" U.S. Const.\namend. IV. The Supreme Court, in interpreting the Fourth Amendment, has held that \"wherever an individual may\nharbor a reasonable `expectation of privacy' [the Fourth Amendment entitles the person] to be free from\nunreasonable governmental intrusion.\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1873, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).\nThe Supreme Court recognized in Terry v. Ohio that \"the specific content and incidents of this [Fourth\nAmendment] right must be shaped by the context in which it is asserted. For `what the Constitution forbids is not\nall searches and seizures, but unreasonable searches and seizures.'\" Terry, 392 U.S. at 9, 88 S.Ct. at 1873\n(quoting Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 222, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 1446, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960)). Thus, the\nFourth Amendment is violated when the government conducts an unreasonable search in an area where a\nperson has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nV. CONSTITUTIONALITY\nWe accept as axiomatic the principle that people harbor a reasonable expectation of privacy in their \"private\nparts.\" In Doe v. Calumet City, Illinois, 754 F.Supp. 1211 (N.D.Ill.1990), the court recognized that \"[d]eeply\nimbedded in our culture ... is the belief that people have a reasonable expectation not to be unclothed\ninvoluntarily, to be observed unclothed or to have their `private' parts observed or touched by others.\" Doe, 754\nF.Supp. at 1218. In this case, officers ordered Simon, a fourteen-year-old girl, to remove her outer garments,\nexpose her breasts, and stand before them clad only in her panties.\nTo begin our analysis, we assume that Simon was lawfully in the custody of the officers at the police station. With\nthat assumption, we direct our attention to Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In\nBell the Supreme Court considered the \"reasonableness\" of strip searches incident to the incarceration of\npersons awaiting trial, sentencing, or transportation to federal prisons. In Bell, the individuals at the short-term\ncustodial facility challenged the institution's practice of forcing them to submit to routine strip searches with visual\nbody cavity inspections after each contact visit with a person from outside the institution.\nThe Supreme Court held that \"convicted prisoners [or pretrial detainees] do not forfeit all constitutional\nprotections by reason of their ... confinement.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 545, 99 S.Ct. at 1877. After announcing this\nprinciple, the Supreme Court stated:\n`Lawful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and\nrights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.' ...\n[M]aintaining institutional security and preserving internal order and discipline are essential goals\nthat may require limitation or retraction of the retained constitutional rights of both convicted\nprisoners and pretrial detainees.\n192 Bell, 441 U.S. at 545-546, 99 S.Ct. at 1877-78 (citations omitted) (quoting Price v.*192Johnston, 334 U.S. 266,\n285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1060, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948)). The Supreme Court concluded in Bell that strip searches were\nnot per se unreasonable and could be performed in conformity with the Fourth Amendment on less than probable\ncause in some instances. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 559-560, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85. In order to determine the\nreasonableness of the search and the instances requiring less than probable cause, the Supreme Court set out\nthe following test:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\n\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nThe Bell balancing test for reasonableness requires \"at a minimum, that the facts upon which an intrusion is\nbased be capable of measurement against `an objective standard,' whether this be probable cause or a less\nstringent test.\" Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983) (quoting Delaware v. Prouse,\n440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979) (footnotes omitted)). Courts which have\nconsidered the strip search issue have applied \"objective standards\" ranging from \"reasonable suspicion\" to\n\"probable cause.\" See, e.g., Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir.1984) (holding that arrestees for minor\noffenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials have reasonable suspicion to believe that\narrestees are concealing weapons or contraband), cert. denied,471 U.S. 1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479\n(1985); Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir. 1980),aff'g,479 F.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wis.1979) (holding that\narrestees for minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials have probable cause to believe\nthat arrestees are concealing weapons or contraband). Courts considering the strip search issue have also\nrecognized that the more intrusive a search is upon personal rights, the more the government must demonstrate\njustification for conducting the search. See, e.g., Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273; Flores v. Meese, 681 F.Supp.\n665, 667 (C.D.Cal.1988),aff'd,942 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc), cert. granted, ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct.\n1261, 117 L.Ed.2d 490 (1992). Thus, our application of the Bell balancing test must begin with consideration of\nthe scope of the search and how much it intruded upon privacy.\nIt is axiomatic that a strip search represents a serious intrusion upon personal rights. In Mary Beth G., the court\nreferred to strip searches as \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant,\nembarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.\" Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272. Another court\ndescribed the indignity individuals arrested for minor offenses experience in the following manner:\nThe experience of disrobing and exposing one's self for visual inspection by a stranger clothed\nwith the uniform and authority of the state, in an enclosed room inside a jail, can only be seen as\nthoroughly degrading and frightening. Moreover, the imposition of such a search upon an\nindividual detained for a lesser offense is quite likely to take that person by surprise, thereby\nexacerbating the terrifying quality of the event.\nJohn Does 1-100 v. Boyd, 613 F.Supp. 1514, 1522 (D.C.Minn.1985). One commentator has gone so far as to\ndescribe strip searches as \"visual rape.\" See Shuldiner, Visual Rape: A Look at the Dubious Legality of Strip\nSearches, 13 J. Marshall L.Rev. 278 (1980).\nIn this case, the individual who suffered the state's intrusion into areas of personal privacy is a juvenile. The\ndistrict court noted in Flores that \"[c]hildren are especially susceptible to possible traumas from strip searches.... `\n[Y]outh is more than a chronological fact. It is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible\n193 to influence and to psychological damage.'\" Flores, 681 F.Supp. at 667 (quoting Edding v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. \n*193 104, 115, 102 S.Ct. 869, 877, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982)). In Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F.2d 91 (7th Cir.1980) (per\ncuriam), cert. denied,451 U.S. 1022, 101 S.Ct. 3015, 69 L.Ed.2d 395 (1981), the Seventh Circuit Court of\nAppeals held that the strip search of a thirteen-year-old female without \"reasonable cause\" to believe she\npossessed contraband on her person constituted an \"invasion of constitutional rights of some magnitude.\" Doe,\n631 F.2d at 93. The Seventh Circuit then stated that \"More than that: it is a violation of any known principle of\nhuman decency.... the conduct herein described exceeded the `bounds of reason' by two and a half country\nmiles.\" Doe, 631 F.2d at 93. Thus, the strip search of a juvenile based on less than probable cause \"instinctively\ngives us the most pause.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. Nevertheless, strip searches are valuable law\nenforcement tools in maintaining security and locating contraband in institutions.\nWe next examine the manner in which the officers conducted the strip search, the place in which it was\nconducted, and the justification for initiating it. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. In this case, the officer took\nSimon to an empty room and two uniformed female officers watched her disrobe to her panties. The officers did\nnot perform a body cavity search. The officers limited the search in the following manner: (1) having members of\n\nthe same sex perform the search, (2) using a room where only the participants were present to conduct the\nsearch, and (3) limited the search to exclude body cavities. Without doubt, the officers conducted the strip search\nin the least intrusive manner.\nFinally, we examine the officers' justification for conducting the strip search. The Supreme Court noted in Bell that\n\"maintaining institutional security and preserving internal order and discipline are essential goals that may require\nlimitation or retraction of the retained constitutional rights of ... detainees.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 546, 99 S.Ct. at 1878.\nDue to the extremely intrusive nature of a strip search, strip searches of arrestees based on less than probable\ncause have only been upheld \"where such searches were necessary to protect the overriding security needs of\nthe institution 00 that is, where officials have a reasonable suspicion that a particular detainee harbors weapons or\n97\ndangerous contraband.\" Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1447 (9th Cir.1991).\nA detention center, police station, or jail holding cell is a place \"fraught with serious security dangers.\" Bell, 441\nU.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. These security dangers to the institution are the same whether the detainee is a\njuvenile or an adult. The considerations regarding contraband are the same whether the detainee is a juvenile or\nan adult. Likewise, we see no reason to differentiate between strip searches to discover contraband to protect the\nsecurity of the institution and strip searches within the institution which may lead to contraband (drugs) to be used\nas evidence of a crime. The level of intrusion is the same.\nConsequently, we hold that law enforcement officers may conduct a strip search of a juvenile in custody, even for\na minor offense, based upon reasonable suspicion to believe that the juvenile is concealing weapons or\ncontraband. Although this result troubles us, our reading of Bell and our inability to find any substantial difference\nbetween the security and contraband considerations as they relate to an adult and to a juvenile lawfully in\ncustody mandate our holding.\nThis court has held that \"it is for the court ... ultimately to resolve whether, under the facts available to a law\nenforcement officer, the legal standard for reasonable suspicion was met.\" United States v. Glen-Archila, 677\nF.2d 809, 813-14 n. 7 (11th Cir.),cert. denied,459 U.S. 874, 103 S.Ct. 165, 74 L.Ed.2d 137 (1982). We must\ndetermine whether the officers, \"based on the totality of the circumstances, had a particularized and objective\nbasis for suspecting the particular person[] [searched] of criminal activity.\" United States v. Vargas, 643 F.2d 296,\n298 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981). The former Fifth Circuit recognized that \"reasonable suspicion should be evaluated in\n194 light of the officers' training and experience and may vary according to the *194 degree of intrusion into privacy\noccasioned by the stop or search.\" Vargas, 643 F.2d at 298. Thus, we review de novo whether the officers in this\ncase possessed a particularized and objective basis for suspecting Simon or hiding contraband. See Newell v.\nPrudential Ins. Co. of America, 904 F.2d 644, 649 (11th Cir.1990); Kirkland v. National Mortgage Network, Inc.,\n884 F.2d 1367, 1370 (11th Cir.1989).\nThe officers in this case believed they had a reasonable suspicion for the following reasons: (1) The officers\nsuspected that drinking and drug activity regularly occurred in the area in which they arrested the juveniles; (2)\nMatson saw Justice give Simon something; (3) Simon appeared extremely nervous; (4) Dryden thought that\nfemales were more likely than males to conceal contraband on their persons; (5) Simon had a friend whose\nmother suspected her daughter of using drugs; and (6) Dryden suspected that Simon might have contraband on\nher person. After reviewing the totality of the circumstances in light of what the officers believed as a result of\ntheir training and experience, we hold that the officers possessed a particularized and objective basis for\nsuspecting Simon of hiding contraband on her person. The facts of this case gave the officers a \"reasonable\n[1]\nsuspicion,\" and thus the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n[2]\nBecause we find the search constitutional, we do not address the other issues.\nAccordingly, the district court is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n[1] We are aware that at least one state in this circuit, Florida, permits strip searches only where law enforcement\nofficers have probable cause. Fla.Stat. ยง 901.211. States are free to provide its residents and visitors with more\nprotection than the United States Constitution requires.\n[2] Since this is an issue of first impression in this circuit, and research has not disclosed a case directly on point,\nit would be difficult for a court to find that the law on this issue was clearly established.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
