Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, alleged that her Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated. Specifically, plaintiff claims that detention by courthouse personnel and a strip search in a semi-private bathroom violated her constitutional rights. </p><p>On August 1, 1994, plaintiff, a landlord's attorney, was at Housing Court in the Bronx. Plaintiff grew impatient and repeatedly petitioned the Court for an immediate decision in her case, at which point the court officers handcuffed her. After holding her for two hours they released her, and she returned to the courtroom to address the court. She was then arrested and brought to a 'semi-private' bathroom and strip-searched.  She was then arrested, taken to the criminal court, and released without being held.</p><p>On October 7, 1996, the Court (Judge John Keenan) denied the Defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that if the plaintiff's allegations were true, it would constitute unlawful imprisonment and an unreasonable search. </p><p>On April 20th, 1998, the case went to trial. The jury found that a search had occurred, but that it was objectively reasonable. They awarded the plaintiff nominal damages. The Court denied a motion for new trial on the issue of damages only on June 12, 1998. Plaintiff appealed. </p><p>On April 1, 1999, in a per curiam opinion, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Judge Joseph McLaughlin, Judge Damon Keith, Judge John Walker) affirmed the jury's verdict and the denial of the motion for a new trial on the issue of damages. The case was closed.</p><p></p>",

Rivera, 173 F.3d 844 (1999)   \n \n \n  \n173 F.3d 844 \nUnpublished Disposition \nNOTICE: THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED OPINION. \n(The Court’s decision is referenced in a “Table of Decisions Without Reported Opinions” appearing in the Federal \nReporter. See Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and this court’s local Rule 32.1.1. for rules regarding the \ncitation of unpublished opinions.) \nUnited States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit. \nStacy KAUFMAN, Plaintiff-Appellant, \nv. \nCarlos RIVERA, Jr., U.C.O. (Shield No. 3075); Gloria Torres, C.O. Sgt., Defendants-Appellees, \nand \nU.C.O. John DOES; U.C.O. Jane Does, Defendants. \nNo. 98-7888. | April 1, 1999. \nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Keenan, J.). \nAttorneys and Law Firms \nDaniel R. Williams, Esq., Moore & Williams, LLP, New York, New York, for Appellant. \nLyssa M. Sampson, Assistant Attorney General of the State of New York, New York, New York, for Appellee. \nPresent WALKER, Jr., McLAUGHLIN, and KEITH,* Circuit Judges. \nOpinion \n \n*1 UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of said \ndistrict court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED. \n  \nStacy Kaufman brought this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging, inter alia, violations of her rights under the Fourth, \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The complaint was premised upon claims of false arrest \nagainst Officer Rivera and an alleged unlawful strip search incident to the arrest against Sgt. Torres. Only claims arising from \nthe allegedly illegal strip-search are before us on appeal. \n  \nA jury found that the strip search took place but that it was objectively reasonable, and awarded nominal damages in the \namount of $1. Relying on the jury’s finding that the search was objectively reasonable, judge Keenan granted Sgt. Torres \nqualified immunity and set aside the nominal damage award. Subsequent to the jury verdict, Kaufman moved for judgment as \na matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. The district court found that there was sufficient evidence in the record to \nsupport the verdict and denied the motion. Kaufman now appeals. \n  \nWe review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo. See Doctor’s Assocs., Inc. v. Weible, 92 F.3d 108, \n111 (2d Cir.1996). We will not reverse the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 unless \n“the evidence is such that, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the \nevidence, there can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable [people] could have reached.” Samuels v. Air \nTransport Local 504, 992 F.2d 12, 14 (2d Cir.1993) (quotations and citation omitted). We will only reverse where \n(1) there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury’s findings could \nonly have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture, or (2) there is such an overwhelming amount \nof evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded [people] could not arrive at a \nverdict against [Kaufman]. \nAhern v. County of Nassau, 118 F.3d 118, 120 (2d Cir.1997)(quotations and citation omitted). It is well established that an \narresting officer cannot perform a strip search of an arrestee charged with a misdemeanor offense “unless the [official has] a \nreasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime charged, the particular \n  1 \n \n\nKaufman v. Rivera, 173 F.3d 844 (1999)   \n \ncharacteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.” Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.1986). The \nreasonable suspicion test is objective, not subjective. See Cartier v. Lussier, 955 F.2d 841, 843 (2d Cir.1992). For the reasons \nstated by the district court, the evidence sufficed to establish reasonable suspicion. Sgt. Torres therefore enjoyed qualified \nimmunity. \n  \n*2 We have considered appellant’s remaining claims and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is \nAFFIRMED. \n  \nParallel Citations \n1999 WL 197199 (Table) \nFootnotes \n \n*  Honorable Damon J.
