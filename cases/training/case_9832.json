Schott, Mary Buelna, and Karen Houghton, Defendants.\nNo. CV 83-7050-SVW.\nUnited States District Court, C.D. California.\nAugust 14, 1987.\n698 *698 Pam Lawson, Las Vegas, Nev., for plaintiff.\nJames K. Hahn, City Atty., Greg Wolff, Deputy City Atty., Los Angeles, Cal., for defendants.\nAMENDED MEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nWILSON, District Judge.\nIn this opinion, the court discusses the constitutionality of a policy of the Los Angeles Police Department (\"LAPD\")\n[1]\nthat mandates a visual body cavity search for every pretrial detainee arrested on any felony charge.  This issue\narises in the following context: the plaintiff, Karen Kennedy, was arrested for grand theft and subjected to a body\ncavity search. The plaintiff sued for a violation of her civil rights. At trial, a jury found that the plaintiff had been\narrested without probable cause and that the body cavity search violated her constitutional rights. The defendants\nnow move for a new trial on the principal ground that the jury was improperly instructed regarding the law on\nwhen police officers may conduct body cavity searches of felony arrestees. Because the court finds that the\nvisual body cavity policy at issue here is unconstitutional, it denies the defendants' new trial motion.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nThis case arises out of the arrest and eventual body cavity search of the plaintiff, Karen Kennedy. The arrest was\nthe result of a dispute between Kennedy and her former roommate who shared a two bedroom apartment in the\nBrentwood area of Los Angeles. Kennedy and her roommate suffered a falling out after the roommate, without\nwarning, told Kennedy that she was moving out of the apartment leaving Kennedy with a rent she couldn't afford.\nKennedy alleged that the roommate owed her money (approximately $600) for apartment and refrigerator rent\nand telephone bills. When the roommate refused to pay the debt before departing, Kennedy, in a pique of anger,\nengaged in some self-help by hiding her roommate's portable television and some other minor items in various\nspots in the apartment as security until the debt was paid. The roommate called the police upon discovering\nduring the process of moving that she could not locate some of her belongings. The police responded by\ndemanding entry into the apartment and ordered Kennedy to remain on a sofa while they searched the entire\napartment for the roommate's belongings. The police had Kennedy under continuous observation, even to the\npoint of insisting that she leave the bathroom door open in her apartment when she had a bowel movement. The\njury in this case found that the search of the apartment was proper.\nAfter searching for but not finding the television or other items, the officers who had been called to the scene,\nOfficers King and Schott, arrested Kennedy for the felony of Grand Theft. Grand Theft is defined in part as the\ntheft of personal property valued at over $400. See Cal.Penal Code ยง 487(1) (West Supp.1986). The testimony at\ntrial revealed hostility and frustration on the part of the officers in not locating the roommate's items and in\nKennedy's failure to cooperate by telling the police where she had placed them. No serious effort was made to\n699 determine whether or not the missing *699 items had a aggregate value of over $400. The jury found that\nprobable cause did not exist for this arrest.\n\nFollowing her arrest, Kennedy was booked into the Van Nuys jail. During the booking process, she was subjected\n700 to a body cavity search.[2] The jury found that *700 this search was improper because it was conducted even\nthough the jail officials did not have a reasonable suspicion that she was carrying or concealing contraband or a\nweapon or that she was suffering from a communicable disease.\nDISCUSSION\nI. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE LAPD POLICY\nThe first ground of the defendants' motion for new trial ultimately depends on whether the court believes that the\nLAPD's policy requiring body cavity searches of all felony arrestees is unconstitutional. Below, then, the court\nexplains why the policy is unconstitutional before it addresses the contentions of each side's motion.\nThe standard for when a body cavity search of a pretrial detainee may be conducted is far from certain. At a\nminimum, however, the cases are clear that such searches cannot take place if they are arbitrary and\npurposeless.\nThe starting point of any analysis of the law in this area must be Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Bell addressed the general question of how to evaluate the constitutionality of conditions or\nrestrictions placed upon pretrial detainees and the specific question of whether body cavity searches of pretrial\ndetainees may ever be conducted on less than probable cause.\nIn Bell, Justice Rehnquist concluded that body cavity searches of pretrial detainees could be conducted on less\nthan probable cause. 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885, 60 L.Ed.2d at 482. That holding left open the question,\nhowever, of precisely when such searches become unconstitutional. Thus, a court must look to the general\nlanguage in the opinion in order to derive the standard. First, the court notes that Justice Rehnquist conceded\nthat in this area, the Fourth Amendment does protect both pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners from\nunreasonable searches. 441 U.S. at 558-59, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d at 481. He added that when evaluating\nwhether a particular intrusion is allowable, a court should consider \"the scope of the particular intrusion, the\nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" 441 U.S.\nat 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d at 481. This test thus becomes a standard by which the LAPD's policy\nregarding body cavity searches can be evaluated.\nBell is also helpful in determining when searches will clearly be permissible or impermissible. A spectrum of\ncircumstances exists under which a body cavity search might be justified. At one point on the spectrum,\nrepresented by the existence of probable cause, a body cavity search is always permissible because Bell\nteaches that such searches of pretrial detainees may be made on less than probable cause. In contrast, at the\nother end of the spectrum, a search may never take place. This second point is reached when a court determines\nthat the search is merely a restriction or condition that \"is arbitrary or purposeless.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 539, 99 S.Ct.\nat 1874, 60 L.Ed.2d at 468 (\"[I]f a restriction or condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal 00 if it is\n97\narbitrary or purposeless 00 a court permissibly may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is\n97\n[3]\npunishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees qua detainees.\").\n701 *701 In determining where to draw the line between permissible and impermissible searches, the court is\ncognizant of Bell's admonition that the courts should not unnecessarily interfere with the management of jails.\nPrison officials must be free to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of inmates and\ncorrections personnel and to prevent escape or unauthorized entry.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878, 60 L.Ed.2d at 473. See also Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 104 S.Ct.\n3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984). Block stresses that when a District Court reviews the practices of jail officials, it\nshould not substitute \"its view on the proper administration of [a jail] for that of ... experienced administrators of\nthat facility.\" Block, 468 U.S. at 589, 104 S.Ct. at 3234, 82 L.Ed.2d at 449.\n\nWith Bell to guide them, the lower courts have tried to define precisely when a body cavity search of an arrestee\nwould be permissible. One area of contention has been whether jail officials are allowed to have a policy\nrequiring strip or even body cavity searches of all arrestees. Knowing that Bell allows body cavity searches on\nless than probable cause, the courts have held that jail officials may not have a blanket policy that they will\nconduct body cavity searches of all arrestees for minor offenses. Rather, the courts have said that such searches\nmay not take place unless the jailers have some \"reasonable suspicion.\" For example, the Ninth Circuit in Giles v.\nAckerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984) held that an arrestee on a minor traffic offense may not be subjected to a\nstrip search (a less intrusive search than a visual body cavity search) upon being booked into a jail without \nreasonable suspicion that the particular arrestee was carrying contraband or in any way threatening jail security.\nThe blanket policy of the jailer in Giles requiring that all persons booked into that jail be strip searched regardless\nof any suspicion that the arrestee threaten jail security was held unconstitutional.\nIn Ward v. County of San Diego, 783 F.2d 1385 (9th Cir.1986) the court reaffirmed its holding in Giles. In Ward,\nthe blanket policy of the jailer went even further than in Giles since the arrestee, who was arrested on a\nmisdemeanor charge, was required to submit to a strip search that included a visual body cavity inspection.\nIn Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2nd Cir.1986), the court held \"that the Fourth Amendment precludes prison\nofficials from performing strip/body cavity searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanors or other minor\noffenses unless the officials have a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or other\ncontraband based on the crime charged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances\n702 of the arrest.\"[4]*702Id. at 802. Other circuits have come down with similar holdings. Id. at 801 n. 6.[5]\nUnlike the cases cited above, however, this case presents a unique fact pattern in that the plaintiff here was\nsubjected to a body cavity search pursuant to a blanket policy of the LAPD requiring body cavity searches of all\nfelony arrestees even if the jailers have no reason to suspect that an arrestee is harboring weapons or\ncontraband. All but one of the previous cases were limited to blanket policies regarding searches of arrestees for\n[6]\nminor offenses.  The question for the court is whether the Fourth (and perhaps Fifth) Amendment requires\nLAPD jailers to have reasonable suspicion before they may conduct a body cavity search of felony arrestees. The\ncourt concludes that they must.\nThe starting point for analyzing this question must be Bell, which, as stated above, dictates that in analyzing the\nreasonableness of any policy regarding searches, \"[c]ourts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion,\nthe manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted\n[cases].\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d at 481 (emphasis added). There can be no doubt\nthat body cavity searches are one of the most intrusive searches that law enforcement officials can carry out,\neven if they are conducted in private and in a courteous and professional manner. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 558, 99\nS.Ct. at 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d at 480 (\"Admittedly, this practice instinctively gives us the most pause.\"). See also441\nU.S. at 576-77, 99 S.Ct. at 1893, 60 L.Ed.2d at 492 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\"In my view the body-cavity\nsearches [required in Bell] represent one of the most grievous offenses against personal dignity and common\ndecency.\"). Thus the focus for the court must be the LAPD's justification for initiating this blanket policy with\nrespect to felony arrestees.\nThe justification for doing such searches was explained in Bell.\nA detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers. Smuggling of money,\ndrugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence. And inmate attempts to\nsecrete these items into the facility by concealing them in body cavities are documented in this\nrecord ... and in other cases.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, 60 L.Ed. at 481.\nThus the justification for such searches is real, but the only test the LAPD uses to determine whether contraband\n[7]\nis being harbored by a felony arrestee is the classification of the offense (i.e. felony or misdemeanor).  The\ncourt does not believe that the classification of an offense alone is sufficiently probative of the question of\nwhether a particular arrestee is harboring contraband. A cursory examination of the California statutes reveals a\n\nmultitude of felony offenses which do not in any way suggest drugs or dangerous weapons. In California, a felony\nis \"a crime which is punishable with death or by imprisonment in the state prison.\" Cal.Penal Code ยง 17 (West\nSupp.1987). Examples of felonies in this state include willful tax evasion, Cal. Rev. & Tax Code ยง 19406 (West\n1983), securities fraud, Cal.Corp.Code ยง 25541 (West 1977), conspiracy to restrain trade, Cal.Bus. & Prof.Code\nยง 16755 (West 1987), falsification of accounts by public officials, Penal Code ยง 424, fraudulently obtaining over\n$400 in telephone services, Penal Code ยง 502.7, and bribery of an officer in a financial institution, Penal Code ยง\n703 639. It is highly unlikely that anyone arrested for these felonies would be harboring weapons *703 or contraband\nin body cavities upon arrest. On the other hand, some misdemeanor offenses do involve drugs, violence and\nweapons. Examples of misdemeanors include assault, Penal Code ยง 241, disturbing the peace, Penal Code ยง\n415, being under the influence of a controlled substance in public, Penal Code ยง 647, and carrying a loaded\nfirearm, Penal Code ยง 12031.\nThis case provides a prime example of how the LAPD's sole reliance on the fact that an arrestee has been\ncharged with a felony rather than a misdemeanor tells the LAPD almost nothing about whether a suspect is\nharboring weapons or contraband. At the time Ms. Kennedy was searched, the jailer had, according to the\ncustom and practice of the jail, a booking slip which informed the jailer that Ms. Kennedy was being charged with\ngrand theft 00 a crime which in almost all instances does not involve weapons or drugs. Further, the jailer testified\n97\n[8]\nthat she did not have any suspicion that Ms. Kennedy had drugs or weapons.  Ms. Kennedy was compelled\nnonetheless to undergo the visual body cavity search simply because the policy compelled it. If for example the\narresting officer decided that the television set and other small items had a value of $399 and not $400, the\n[9]\nminimum required for grand theft,  Ms. Kennedy would not have been subjected to a visual body cavity search.\nNot only does the court believe that the LAPD's search policy with respect to felony arrestees cannot be justified\non the basis of its probative value, it also does not believe that the policy can be justified on the basis of\nadministrative necessity. The court notes the jailers are instructed to perform body cavity searches of arrestees\ncharged with misdemeanors only when those arrestees are suspected of harboring weapons or contraband.\nFurthermore, it appears that the number of arrests for misdemeanors in the City of Los Angeles far outweighs the\n[10]\nnumber of felony arrests here.  Thus the jailers have shown themselves capable of making these\ndeterminations, and the record shows that they do in fact make such determinations with respect to a substantial\npercentage of the individuals arrested in the City of Los Angeles.\nBecause a felony charge alone tells a jailer almost nothing about whether an arrestee is harboring weapons,\nmoney, drugs, or other contraband, the court believes that the LAPD's policy requiring body cavity searches of all\nfelony arrestees amounts to punishment of these individuals. As Bell points out, a restriction or condition upon an\narrestee in a jail which is not \"reasonably related to a legitimate goal,\" but is rather \"arbitrary or purposeless\" is\npunishment and prohibited by the fifth and fourteenth amendments. See Bell, 441 U.S. 535-39, 99 S.Ct. at 1874,\n60 L.Ed.2d 468. Thus the court believes that even under the broad guidelines set forth by Bell, this policy of the\nLAPD cannot pass constitutional muster.\nThe court has found only one opinion that arguably appears to draw a conclusion different from its own. See \nDufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084 (6th Cir.1983). In Dufrin, the court considered a fourth amendment challenge to a\n704 search that took place under a policy of a jailer that required *704 a strip search for all female arrestees\n\"regardless of the nature of the charges against them and regardless of the probability that they might be carrying\ncontraband.\" The court in that case, however, did not actually pass upon the policy itself. 712 F.2d at 1089\n(\"Since this is a purely individual claim under ยง 1983, we are not asked ... to make any rules of broad application\nor to lay down any bright line based upon the type of crime charged.\"). The court then went on to uphold that\nsearch, stressing that the felony involved there is one of violence.\nGiven the scope of what was decided in Dufrin, it is only fair to compare the two cases on their facts, and several\nsignificant facts distinguish Dufrin from the case at bar. First, the offense in Dufrin was felonious assault, which\nthe Dufrin court itself observed has violence as an element. Second, the matron was not made aware of the\nspecific charges against the prisoners committed to her custody. In the case at bar, the crime charged did not\nsuggest contraband or drugs and the matron as a matter of routine, was made aware of the crime for which the\narrestee was booked. It is clear that the Dufrin court placed great weight on the nature of the offense and noted\n\nthat the other strip search cases involved misdemeanor and minor offenses not normally associated with\nweapons or contraband.\nThus this court concludes that the policy of the LAPD requiring body cavity searches of all felony arrestees is\nunconstitutional because it is arbitrary and purposeless. Therefore, the court believes that it correctly instructed\nthe jury on the question of whether the search that took place in this case was proper. The instruction of the court\nwas as follows:\n[T]he jail officials must have had reasonable suspicion that she was carrying or concealing\ncontraband or a weapon or that she was suffering from a communicable disease. Factors for you\nto consider in determining whether the jail officials had reasonable suspicion include the nature of\nthe alleged offense, Ms. Kennedy's appearance and conduct at the time, whether she had a prior\nrecord and any other information the police had at the time she was booked.\nNote that this instruction includes the nature of the offense as an element that a jailer may consider in\ndetermining whether to conduct a search. The problem with the LAPD policy is it only depends on whether a\nfelony has been charged. Because the instruction comports with the requirements of Bell and its progeny, the\ncourt rejects the defendants' argument that the instruction was incorrect and denies its new trial motion.\nIn denying this new trial motion, the court is expressing the view that the fourth and fourteenth amendments\nrequire prison officials to determine under a minimal standard of reasonable suspicion whether a felony arrestee\nis carrying contraband or a weapon before conducting a body cavity search. The court stresses that it is not this\ncourt's purpose to superimpose its views of prison administration upon those professionals entrusted with the\nsafety of our prisons. We are not telling the prison officials how to perform this task or what factors they should\nconsider in evaluating reasonable suspicion. The factors listed in the jury instruction only provided suggestions to\nassist them in their task. The LAPD may, for example, find that the nature of the crime charged alone without\n[11]\nmore might suffice.  The court does conclude, however, that some determination of reasonable suspicion is\nrequired for persons initially booked on felonies as well as those booked on misdemeanors.\nII. QUESTIONING OF WITNESSES\nA second ground upon which defendants found their new trial motion involves the alleged abuse of discretion by\nthe court in questioning the defendant officers while they were testifying. This ground does not require a new trial.\n705 The *705 court may question witnesses on the stand. See, e.g., United States v. Articles of Device, 481 F.2d 434\n(10th Cir.1973); Beetler v. Sales Affiliates, Inc., 431 F.2d 651 (7th Cir.1970). Furthermore, the court notes that it\ncautioned the jury that any questions asked by the court were not to be construed as indicating that the court had\nany opinion regarding the issues at hand.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] By contrast, the policy of the Los Angeles Police Department with respect to persons detained on\nmisdemeanor charges is that the Department will only engage in body cavity searches of those arrestees if the\nDepartment suspects those arrestees of harboring weapons or contraband.\n[2] In her testimony, Kennedy described the cell to which she was taken: \n[Kennedy]: THEY JUST TOOK ME ARM-IN-ARM AND TOOK ME TO THIS PADDED CELL. I RECALL IT BEING\nLIKE A PADDED CELL WITH A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT AND A DRAIN IN THE CENTER, AND IT WAS JUST A\nVERY STENCH, SMELLY PLACE.\nUnder questioning from her attorney, Mr. Lawson, Kennedy also described to which she was subjected in her\ntestimony:\n\n[Kennedy]: ONE OF THE LADIES CAME INTO THE CELL WITH ME AND SHE STARTED TO RUN HER\nFINGERS THROUGH MY HAIR. AND I WAS ASKING HER WHY SHE WAS DOING THAT, AND SHE WAS\nTELLING ME THAT SHE WAS CHECKING ME FOR FLEAS AND FOR LICE.\nAND SHE HAD ALSO ASKED ME IF I HAD ANY VENEREAL DISEASE, AND I TOLD HER NO. AND SHE SAID,\nWELL, WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO IS TO TAKE EACH ARTICLE OF CLOTHING OFF AND TURN IT INSIDE\nOUT AND THEN GIVE IT TO US. SO I 00 I 00\n97 97\n[Lawson]: EXCUSE ME. DO YOU KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THIS OFFICER, THE WOMAN WHO TOLD YOU\nTHAT? WAS THAT MARY BUELNA?\n[Kennedy]: I 00 I 00 THE NAME SOUNDS 00 YES, IT SOUNDS 00\n97 97 97 97\n[Lawson]: BUT THERE WERE TWO LADIES?\n[Kennedy]: BUT THERE WERE TWO. THERE WERE TWO.\n[Lawson]: HOW WERE THEY DRESSED?\n[Kennedy]: IN UNIFORM.\n[Lawson]: FULL UNIFORM 00 BADGES, EVERYTHING?\n97\n[Kennedy]: I DON'T RECALL. I JUST REMEMBER THEY WORE UNIFORMS.\n[Lawson]: THAT WAS IT? JUST THE TWO OFFICERS AND YOU, NO ONE ELSE 00\n97\n[Kennedy]: Yes.\n[Lawson]: 00 IS THAT RIGHT?\n97\nALL RIGHT. NOW, WHAT HAPPENED, THEN, AFTER THEY 00 THEY TOLD YOUR THEY WANTED YOU TO\n97\nTAKE OFF EACH ITEM OF YOUR CLOTHING?\n[Kennedy]: I KEPT ASKING WHY I HAD TO DO THAT AND WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR, AND THEY\nJUST TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD JUST FOLLOW THE PROCEDURE AND DO AS THEY SAY.\nSO I 00 AFTER I HAD GOTTEN ALL OF MY CLOTHES OFF, THEY TOLD ME TO TURN AROUND AND 00 NO,\n97 97\nFIRST OF ALL, THEY TOLD ME TO BEND DOWN AND TOUCH THE FLOOR AND TO DO LIKE THESE HOPS\nLIKE 00 LIKE A 00 A 00 HOPS LIKE A RABBIT WOULD HOP. AND I TOLD 00\n97 97 97 97\n[Lawson]: WHILE YOU WERE BENT DOWN?\n[Kennedy]: YES.\nAND I TOLD THEM THAT I COULDN'T BEND DOWN, THAT I HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH MY BACK.\nAND THEY JUST TOLD ME, THEY SAID, LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO THE 00 YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHAT\n97\nWE'RE TELLING YOU TO DO. SO, YOU KNOW, I 00 I WAS SCARED AND I DID WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO.\n97\nTHEN THEY TOLD ME TO BEND DOWN AND TO SQUAT MY 00 OPEN MY LEGS APART AS FAR AS I COULD,\n97\nTO STICK MY FINGERS UP MY VAGINA, AND TO PROBE UP THERE TO, UMH, I WAS 00 I DIDN'T KNOW\n97\nWHAT FOR.\n[Lawson]: WHO WAS IT THAT TOLD YOU TO DO THAT, KAREN?\n[Kennedy]: I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IT WAS.\n[Lawson]: WAS ONE OF THE OFFICERS DOING MOST OF THE TALKING?\n[Kennedy]: YES.\n\n[Lawson]: WHAT WAS THE OFFICER DOING, THE OTHER OFFICER, AT THE TIME?\n[Kennedy]: JUST STANDING AND OBSERVING AND TELLING ME JUST TO DO AS THEY SAID. AND 00\n97\n[Lawson]: WERE THERE ANY COMMENTS MADE ABOUT YOUR BODY?\n[Kennedy]: JUST AS I TURNED AROUND AND STOOD UP, THEN THIS ONE00 I MEAN, HERE I AM,\n97\nHYSTERICAL, AND THIS LADY COMMENTS ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL BREASTS I HAD. AND I JUST\nCOULDN'T BELIEVE 00 (WITNESS CRYING.)\n97\nUMH, SO, ANYWAY, THEY TOLD ME TO TURN AROUND AND TO STICK MY BUTTOCKS IN THE AIR AND TO\nSTICK MY FINGERS UP MY ANUS AND TO PROBE AROUND IN THERE FOR THEM TO SEE IF ANYTHING\nWAS VISIBLE.\nAND IT WAS REALLY HUMILIATING, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THERE FOR,\nWHY YOU HAD TO BE PUT THROUGH THIS IN ADDITION.\n[Lawson]: KAREN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT WAS, ABOUT, THIS 00 ABOUT THAT TIME THAT ALL THAT\n97\nWAS HAPPENING TO YOU?\n[Kennedy]: I JUST KNOW THAT I WAS IN 00 IN JAIL FOR ABOUT 11 HOURS.\n97\n[Lawson]: DID THEY ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING ELSE WHEN YOU WERE IN THAT NUDE CONDITION?\n[Kennedy]: THEY ASKED ME TO 00 TO TOUCH THE FLOOR. WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT I COULDN'T TOUCH\n97\nTHE FLOOR WITH MY BUTTOCKS IN THE AIR, ONE OF THE POLICEMEN HAD NOTICED THAT I HAD THIS\nBIG SCAR. AND THEN WHEN SHE NOTICED THAT, THEN THEY SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T\nHAVE TO DO ANY MORE. SO 00\n97\n[3] This minimal standard of decency derives from the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth\namendments and not the eighth amendment. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 535 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. at 1872, 60 L.Ed.2d at\n466. \nThe Court of Appeals properly relied on the Due Process Clause rather than the Eighth Amendment in\nconsidering the claims of pretrial detainees. Due process requires that a pretrial detainee not be punished. A\nsentenced inmate, on the other hand, may be punished, although that punishment may not be cruel and unusual\nunder the Eighth Amendment. The Court recognized this distinction in Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 671-72\nn. 40, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 1412 n. 40, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977).\n[4] The Second Circuit pointed out in Weber that this result was not inconsistent with Bell.\nIn the portion of Bell v. Wolfish that applies directly to the issue before us, the Supreme Court held that probable\ncause is not necessary to justify routine strip/body cavity searches of arraigned pre-trial detainees after those\ninmates have had contact with visitors from outside the institution. Instead, the \"test of reasonableness\" requires\na \"balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" \nId.,441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. In the Wolfish setting, that test required the balancing of the institution\nagainst the privacy interests of \"the significant and legitimate security interests of the inmates.\" Id. at 560, 99\nS.Ct. at 1885. In concluding that the security interests of the prison in undertaking strip/body cavity searches after\n\"contact\" visits outweighed the privacy interests of the inmates 00 prisoners who had already been arraigned, had\n97\nfailed to make bail, and had presumably chosen to receive visitors and to enjoy physical contact with them 00 the\n97\nCourt recognized the need for \"mutual accommodation between institutional needs and objectives and the\nprovisions of the Constitution that are of general application.\" Id. at 546, 99 S.Ct. at 1878 (quoting Wolff v.\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2974, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)). It did not, however, read out of the\nConstitution the provision of general application that a search be justified as reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe imposition of a standard short of probable cause in determining the balance of interests at stake in Wolfish in\nno way dispensed with that requirement.\n\n[5] In this regard, Justice Powell's short opinion in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 563, 99 S.Ct. at 1886, 60 L.Ed.2d\nat 484 concurring in part and dissenting in part is curious when he states: \"In view of the serious intrusion on\none's privacy occasioned by such a search, I think at least some level of cause, such as reasonable suspicion,\nshould be required to justify the anal and genital searches described in this case.\"\n[6] The one case dealing with a felony was Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084 (6th Cir.1983), discussed below.\n[7] According to its policy, the LAPD may conduct body cavity searches of misdemeanor arrestees if it suspects\nthem of harboring weapons or contraband.\n[8] Evidently, even the arresting officers themselves had no suspicion that Ms. Kennedy was carrying drugs or\nweapons for they did not bother to search her. See Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wis.),aff'd,620 F.2d\n160 (7th Cir.1980). \nIn fact, there was hardly a need since she was arrested at her apartment and the officers watched her every\nmovement thereafter 00 even to the point of watching her go to the bathroom and have a bowel movement.\n97\nBecause she was under the control of the police officers at all times thereafter for alleged \"security reasons,\" the\nexamination of her anus at the jail was even more senseless. See Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, 740-41 (8th\nCir.1985).\n[9] The evidence at trial demonstrated that the officers merely made an educated guess at best as to their worth.\n[10] The court notes that in 1985, the total number of felony arrests in the city of Los Angeles was 61,282. The\nnumber of women arrested for felonies was 6,501. In contrast, the total number of misdemeanor arrests is\n99,614, and number women arrested for misdemeanors was 17,079. California Department of Justice, Division of\nLaw Enforcement, Bureau of Criminal Statistics and Special Services, 1985 Criminal Justice (Los Angeles\nCounty).\n[11] We do not suggest that this is the only means of evaluation or that the description of the crime itself is the \nsine qua non for conducting the search. See Clements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1304, 1310, 102 S.Ct. 284, 288, 70\nL.Ed.2d 461, 466 (1981).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

See, e.g.,Thompson\nv. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir.1989) (The felony of grand theft auto \"is\nsufficiently associated with violence to justify a visual strip search.\") (footnote omitted); ....\nThe full court has been advised of the suggestion for rehearing en banc and no active judge has requested a vote\non whether to rehear the matter en banc. (Fed.R.App.P. 35.)\nThe petition for rehearing is DENIED and the suggestion for rehearing en banc is REJECTED.\nOPINION\nCYNTHIA HOLCOMB HALL, Circuit Judge:\nKaren Kennedy brought a civil rights action under section 1983 against, among others, the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment and two of its officers, James J. King and Stanley A. Schott. The case reached the jury, who after\ndetermining that Kennedy's rights were violated, awarded her compensatory and punitive damages.\nI\nKaren Kennedy and Karen Houghton were roommates in a two-bedroom apartment. The two women had entered\ninto a two-year lease on November 15, 1982. On January 21, 1983, Houghton, without prior warning, left\nKennedy a note indicating that she would be vacating the apartment the following morning. According to\nKennedy, Houghton owed her a total of $694 for her portion of rent and utilities and for bounced checks.\n\nThe following morning Houghton, with her parents and grandparents, arrived at the apartment with a car trailer to\nretrieve her belongings. Kennedy testified that she unsuccessfully attempted to speak with Houghton about their\ndifferences. Houghton refused to pay the debt before departing and told Kennedy that she was moving to La\nJolla, California (although in fact she was moving to Beverly Hills). Houghton left no forwarding address.\nHoughton made several trips to complete her move. During one of the trips, Kennedy moved two of Houghton's\nwicker chairs into Kennedy's bedroom and Houghton's television into the living room behind some drapes.\nKennedy retained these items as \"security\" for the debt Houghton owed her. Kennedy then installed a lockout\ndevice on the front door to prevent Houghton from entering the apartment with her key. When Houghton returned,\nshe noticed that some of her belongings were missing. She called the police.\nOfficers King and Schott responded to the call. They demanded entry into the apartment. Kennedy was with her\ndaughter and a friend of her daughter. The officers then spoke with Kennedy, who explained that she intended to\nhold the property as security for money Houghton owed her. The officers ordered Kennedy to remain on the sofa\n[1]\nwhile they searched the apartment for the missing items.  The officers' search was unsuccessful.\nOfficers King and Schott arrested Kennedy for grand theft, a felony, and escorted her to the Van Nuys jail. At the\njail, Kennedy was forced to submit to a body-cavity search. After stripping off all her clothing, Kennedy was\nrequired to expose her vaginal and anal cavities so that the two women officers could determine whether\nKennedy was concealing drugs or weapons. She was not.\nIn a special verdict, the jury determined that King and Schott were not entitled to qualified immunity and had\nviolated Kennedy's constitutional rights when they arrested her. The jury awarded $5,000 in actual damages\n705 against each officer, as well as $3,000 in punitive damages against King and $1,000 in punitive damages against \n*705 Schott. The jury also determined that Kennedy's constitutional rights were violated because of the City of\nLos Angeles' policy to subject all those arrested for felonies to a body-cavity search. The jury awarded $25,000 in\nactual damages against the City.\nAppellants timely appeal from the jury's determination. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง\n1331, 1343(4). This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291.\nII\nAt the end of Kennedy's case, and at the end of trial, appellants moved for a directed verdict. On appeal, the\nofficers contend that the district court erred in failing to direct a verdict in their favor. They advance two bases to\nsupport this contention: (1) that probable cause to arrest was established as a matter of law; and (2) that they\nwere entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.\nA\nFor Kennedy to prevail under her section 1983 claim, she must establish that (1) she was deprived of a right\nsecured by the Constitution or laws of the United States; and (2) the deprivation was caused by state action. \nParratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1912, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981); Gorenc v. Salt River Project\nAgric. Improvement and Power Dist., 869 F.2d 503, 505 (9th Cir.1989). The appellants contend that the district\ncourt erred in denying their motions for a directed verdict on the ground that probable cause to arrest was\nestablished as a matter of law. Appellants thus conclude that the arrest did not violate the Constitution.\n\"A directed verdict ... should not be granted unless `the evidence permits only one reasonable conclusion as to\nthe verdict.' The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and all inferences\nmust be drawn in that party's favor.\" Flores v. Pierce, 617 F.2d 1386, 1389 (9th Cir.) (quoting Kay v. Cessna\nAircraft Co., 548 F.2d 1370, 1372 (9th Cir.1977)), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 875, 101 S.Ct. 218, 66 L.Ed.2d 96\n(1980). In a section 1983 action, probable cause generally is a jury question. McKenzie v. Lamb, 738 F.2d 1005,\n1008 (9th Cir.1984). However, a directed verdict on the issue of probable cause is proper if no reasonable jury\ncould determine that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest. Id. \"`Probable cause exists when facts\n\nand circumstances within the arresting officer's knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy\ninformation are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable caution and prudence in the belief that the defendant is\ncommitting or has committed a crime.'\" Floyd v. Farrell, 765 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting State v. Lemire, 121\nN.H. 1, 424 A.2d 1135, 1138 (1981)).\nThe officers arrested Kennedy for committing grand theft, a violation of California Penal Code ยง 487. Under\nCalifornia law, theft is defined in the following manner: \"Every person who shall feloniously steal, take, carry, lead,\nor drive away the personal property of another ... is guilty of theft.\" Cal.Penal Code ยง 484(a) (West 1988). Grand\ntheft occurs \"[w]hen the money, labor or real or personal property taken is of a value exceeding four hundred\ndollars ($400)....\" Id. at ยง 487.\nThe district court recognized, and the appellants do not contest, that an element of the crime of grand theft is the\nspecific intent permanently to deprive an owner of her property. See People v. Kageler, 32 Cal.App.3d 738, 745;\n108 Cal.Rptr. 235, 239 (1973). The court instructed the jury that if it determined that the officers reasonably\nshould have known that Kennedy \"merely intended to take temporary possession of the property belonging to\nHoughton, for example, as security for a debt owed by Houghton,\" they did not have probable cause. Appellants\ndo not challenge this instruction. Part of the probable cause analysis must be whether the officers could believe\nthat Kennedy had the necessary intent.\nAs part of the investigation, Schott discovered from Houghton that Kennedy had told Houghton that she was\n706 keeping her property as security until Houghton paid *706 Kennedy the money she was owed. Schott admitted\nthat he \"probably\" passed this information on to King when King arrived at the scene. And when King and Schott\nconfronted Kennedy in her apartment, Kennedy and a friend of her daughter explained to the officers that\nKennedy was holding the property as security until Houghton paid her debts.\nUpon reviewing the facts in this case, giving Kennedy the benefit of all reasonable inferences that may be drawn\nfrom the evidence presented at trial, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's\ndetermination that probable cause for an arrest was lacking. The officers do not contend on appeal (nor would\nthe record support) that they believed Kennedy was holding Houghton's property for any purpose other than as\nsecurity for a debt allegedly owed. Therefore, there was no reasonable basis from which anyone could believe\nthat Kennedy had the specific intent permanently to deprive Houghton of her property. On the contrary, the jury\nquite properly concluded that a prudent person would not have believed that Kennedy, who was entangled in an\nordinary neighborhood dispute, had committed grand theft. See United States v. Hoyos, 868 F.2d 1131, 1136 (9th\nCir.1989). Consequently, the district court properly refused to direct a verdict for the appellants.\nB\nThe appellants next contend that the district court erred in refusing to grant a directed verdict on the ground of\nqualified immunity. Police officers \"are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" \nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). It is clearly established, of\ncourse, that an arrest without probable cause violates the Constitution. See McKenzie, 738 F.2d at 1007. Thus,\nthe relevant question in this case is \"whether a reasonable officer could have believed [Kennedy's warrantless\narrest] to be lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information the [arresting] officers possessed.\" \nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3040, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); see Kraus v. County of\nPierce, 793 F.2d 1105, 1109 (9th Cir.1986),cert. denied,480 U.S. 932, 107 S.Ct. 1571, 94 L.Ed.2d 763 (1987); \nsee also Floyd, 765 F.2d at 5; Bilbrey v. Brown, 738 F.2d 1462, 1466-67 (9th Cir.1984). This court has stated that\nthis inquiry is a question for the trier of fact. Schlegel v. Bebout, 841 F.2d 937, 945 (9th Cir.1988). However, if\nthere is only one reasonable conclusion a jury could reach on this issue, a directed verdict would have been\nproper. Cf. Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3040 (qualified immunity issue can be argued as a matter of\nlaw on summary judgment).\nOur preceding discussion about the obvious lack of probable cause is dispositive of the qualified immunity\nquestion. The jury could have concluded that no reasonable officer in Schott's and King's position could have\nbelieved that Kennedy had the requisite criminal intent necessary to give rise to probable cause to arrest her for\n\ngrand theft. The only information the officers had about Kennedy's intent in taking Houghton's property was that\nKennedy was holding it as security. The officers heard this explanation from Houghton, Kennedy, and a friend of\nKennedy's daughter. There simply was no evidence to indicate any other intent. Accordingly, the district court did\nnot err in denying the appellants' motions for a directed verdict on qualified immunity.\nIII\nAppellants claim that the district court improperly instructed the jury on probable cause. Specifically, they contend\nthat the jury instructions improperly intertwined the standard for probable cause with the concept of sufficient\n[2]\nevidence to prove guilt.\n707 *707 This court reviews instructions to determine, viewing them as a whole, whether they adequately cover each\nissue and whether they are misleading or state the law incorrectly. Martinelli v. City of Beaumont, 820 F.2d 1491,\n1493 (9th Cir.1987). In the contested instruction, the court told the jury in part:\nA police officer may not arrest a person for the commission of a felony without an arrest warrant\nunless he has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed by the person arrested\nwhether or not a felony has in fact been committed. Probable cause exists if the facts and\ncircumstances known to the officer, and of which he had reasonable trustworthy information, are\nsufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing that the suspect has committed a felony. The\nhunch, guess, conjecture or surmise of an officer is not enough, and there must be enough actual\nevidence to reasonably lead to the conclusion that the suspect has committed a felony.\nIn the present case, to constitute \"probable cause\" for the arrest of plaintiff for the commission of\nGRAND THEFT, without an arrest warrant, the evidence must establish that defendant officers\nKING and SCHOTT must have had reasonable cause to believe ALL of the following:\n1. That plaintiff stole, took or carried away the personal property of defendant HOUGHTON; AND\n2. That plaintiff had the specific intent to PERMANENTLY DEPRIVE defendant HOUGHTON of\nher property; AND\n3. That the property had to have a reasonable and fair market value of more that [sic] $400.00 at\nthe time of the theft and the locality of the theft....\nAppellants suggest that this instruction improperly \"mandates a determination by the officers of plaintiff's guilt of\ntheft rather than the probability of criminal activity.\" This argument is meritless. The instruction properly stated\nthat probable cause exists if there were sufficient facts \"to warrant a prudent person in believing that the suspect\nhas committed a felony.\" This is in accord with the law. See Floyd, 765 F.2d at 5. The court never suggested that\nthe \"reasonable cause\" necessary for arrest was the same as the \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" needed for\na criminal conviction.\nIV\nAppellants contend that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's award of punitive damages: $3,000\nagainst King and $1,000 against Schott. We disagree.\nPunitive damages may be assessed in section 1983 actions \"when the defendant's conduct is shown to be\nmotivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected\nrights of others.\" Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 1640, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983). The decision to\nimpose such sanctions is within the exclusive province of the jury. Runge v. Lee, 441 F.2d 579, 584 (9th Cir.),\n[3]\ncert. denied,404 U.S. 887, 92 S.Ct. 197, 30 L.Ed.2d 169 (1971).\n708 *708 Appellants' insufficiency argument is meritless. There is no question that the officers knew that they were\nresponding to a neighborhood dispute. It is also clear that the officers had no reason to believe that Kennedy took\n\nHoughton's property for any reason other than as security. Yet they arrested her, even though they were aware of\n[4]\nthe specific intent requirement of grand theft.  Furthermore, although the officers testified that Kennedy's refusal\nto tell them the location of Houghton's television was a large factor in determining that probable cause existed to\narrest, Kennedy testified that the officers repeatedly told her to \"shut up\" when she tried to explain the situation.\nUnder all these circumstances, we conclude that the jury could determine that arresting Kennedy constituted\nreckless disregard for her right not to be arrested without probable cause. See Gagnon v. Ball, 696 F.2d 17 (2d\nCir.1982) (arresting someone requesting help from police without determining whether her complaint is justified\nevidences reckless disregard for rights of others). There is ample support in the record to justify the jury's\ndetermination.\nV\nAppellants also claim that the district court committed reversible error by questioning the police officers in such a\nway as to create the impression of partiality. In support of their claim, appellants quote the following line of court\ninquiry concerning the value of the property Kennedy had taken:\nThe Court: That's what [her roomate [sic]] said 00\n97\nKing: That's correct.\nThe Court: 00 Isn't that right? And you never did anything but accept what she said to you; isn't that\n97\ncorrect?\nKing: That's all I could really go on at that time. I mean, I had to make a reasonable decision....\nThe Court: Do you think you could have waited a few days and inquired further?\nKing: I had a victim and a father who were insistent.\nThe Court: So you arrest people because fathers of victims tell you to do so, is that your position?\nKing: No, sir. We hadn't even gotten to that point....\nThe Court: You're not a recovery agency, are you?\n. . . . .\nYou're a police department; isn't that right?\n. . . . .\nOther people worry about recovering property, not you; isn't that right?\nKing: No, sir. Part of our mission is the recovery of property....\nThe Court: You could have waited a couple of days, couldn't you have ...?\nKing: We did look into it further, your honor.\n. . . . .\nThe Court: But you arrested her that day, didn't you?\n. . . . .\nHow much time elapsed between the time you walked into her apartment and the time you placed\nher under arrest?\nKing: [Around] 20 to 30 minutes.\n\nCourt: So that was the extent of your investigation?\nAppellants quote another exchange to demonstrate improper judicial questioning:\nThe Court: Couldn't you have gone down to the city attorney's office and gotten a complaint\n[before arresting Kennedy]?\n. . . . .\nSchott: I would have been remiss in my responsibilities if I did that.\n709 *709 The Court: That's your view. But could you have done that?\n. . . . .\nYou could have investigated further before making an arrest, though, couldn't you have?\nSchott: I'm not quite sure how much further I could have investigated.\nThe Court: Could you have checked the value of the property?\nSchott: That's not normally our procedure....\nThe Court: In this case you didn't even see the television, did you?\nSchott: No....\nIn a federal courtroom, a district judge has the undeniable right to examine witnesses and call the jury's attention\nto important evidence. Shad v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 799 F.2d 525, 531 (9th Cir.1986). This may be\nnecessary to \"clarify[] the evidence, control[] the orderly presentation of the evidence, confine[] counsel to\nevidentiary rulings, and prevent[] undue repetition of testimony.\" United States v. Malcolm, 475 F.2d 420, 427 (9th\nCir.1973),quoted in United States v. Harris, 501 F.2d 1, 10 (9th Cir.1974). However, attached to this right is an\nimportant qualification: the judge must always remain fair and impartial. \"[A] trial court must be ever mindful of the\nsensitive role it plays in a jury trial and avoid even the appearance of advocacy or partiality.\" Harris, 501 F.2d at\n10; see also Pollard v. Fennell, 400 F.2d 421, 424 (4th Cir.1968) (\"[A]s one who, in the eyes of the jury, occupies\na position of preeminence and special persuasiveness, the district judge must be assiduous in performing his\nfunction as governor of the trial dispassionately, fairly and impartially.\"). Indeed, the sensitivity of the judge's role\nhas prompted us, on many occasions, to urge judicial restraint. See, e.g., Shad, 799 F.2d at 531 (9th Cir.1986)\n(quoting Warner v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 739 F.2d 1347, 1351 (8th Cir.1984)); Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc.,\n743 F.2d 1282, 1289 (9th Cir.1984),cert. denied,469 U.S. 1190, 105 S.Ct. 963, 83 L.Ed.2d 968 (1985); Harris,\n501 F.2d at 10-11.\nThe standard for reversing a verdict because of general judicial misconduct during trial is rather stringent. \nHandgards, 743 F.2d at 1289. We must determine whether the district court's inquiry rendered the trial unfair. Id.\nThis court has stated:\nA trial court will be reversed for excessive judicial intervention only if the record \"disclose[s] actual\nbias on the part of the trial judge [or] leave[s] the reviewing court with an abiding impression that\nthe judge's remarks and questioning of witnesses projected to the jury an appearance of advocacy\nor partiality.\"\nShad, 799 F.2d at 531 (quoting Warner, 739 F.2d at 1351). And we have noted: \"Very few cases outside of the\ncriminal law area support an appellate finding of general judicial misconduct during trial.\" Handgards, 743 F.2d at\n1289; see also In re Aircrash in Bali, Indonesia, 871 F.2d 812, 815 (9th Cir.1989).\nRegrettably, the trial court's questioning was not marked by complete indifference. Some of his questions instead\nwere quite pointed and intemperate. Nevertheless, viewing the trial record as a whole, we conclude that reversal\nis not warranted. It cannot be said that the court \"repeatedly and consistently\" was discontent to allow counsel to\nquestion witnesses. See Pollard, 400 F.2d at 424 (judge impeded counsel's interrogation repeatedly, assumed\n\nthe role of witness as well as advocate, and misstated factual accounts, requiring reversal). The court's\nquestioning and the responses fill only eight pages of the 400 page transcript. The court did not assume a role as\nwitness by introducing evidence at trial. See id. at 425-26. Nor did the court dominate questioning of the\nwitnesses so as to preempt counsel's function. See Sit-Set, A.G. v. Universal Jet Exchange, Inc., 747 F.2d 921,\n926 (4th Cir.1984) (finding \"judicial domination of the examination of witnesses so persistent [and yet\nunnecessary] throughout the trial that the result was an effective preemption of counsel's legitimate function in\nthe adversarial process\").\n710 *710 The court began questioning King because counsel repeatedly strayed to an area of questioning that the\ncourt had disallowed (strip search). The court's questions began as an attempt to get counsel back on track about\nthe value of the television. The court's questioning of Schott was prompted by Schott's statement that he would\nhave been negligent in his duties if he did not arrest Kennedy immediately, to which the court expressed\nunderstandable skepticism. Cf. Pollard, 400 F.2d at 424-25 (no apparent justification for judicial intervention); Sit-\nSet, 747 F.2d at 926 (same). Questions indicating skepticism are not improper if witnesses are permitted to\nrespond. Shad, 799 F.2d at 531. Moreover, the court explained to the jury that the court's questions were not\nindicative of its feelings about the case. Such a disclaimer is not a panacea for pervasive and biased judicial\naction. See Sit-Set, 747 F.2d at 926. But given the limited scope of the court's intervention in the present case,\nwe believe this explanation alleviated any appearance of impartiality the judge's questioning may have conveyed.\nSee Shad, 799 F.2d at 531; see also United States v. Laurins, 857 F.2d 529, 538 (9th Cir.1988),cert. denied,___\nU.S. ___, 109 S.Ct. 3215, 106 L.Ed.2d 565 (1989).\nVI\nThe Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has a policy requiring all those who are arrested on suspicion of\nhaving committed a felony to be subjected to a body-cavity search. The jury found that this policy, which resulted\nin Kennedy being searched, violated her rights. Kennedy was awarded $25,000 in actual damages against the\nCity of Los Angeles.\nAppellants challenge the district court's instruction that the body-cavity search of Kennedy would violate her\nfourth amendment rights unless the jail officials \"had a reasonable suspicion that she was carrying or concealing\n[5]\ncontraband or a weapon or that she was suffering from a communicable disease.\"  Appellants moved for a new\ntrial, which was denied. The district court issued an opinion holding that the LAPD's policy of conducting a visual\nbody-cavity search of all felony arrest detainees, regardless of reasonable suspicion, violates the fourth\namendment. Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Department, 667 F.Supp. 697 (C.D. Cal.1987).\nThis court reviews instructions to determine whether viewing them as a whole, they adequately cover each issue\nand whether they are misleading or state the law incorrectly. Martinelli, 820 F.2d at 1493. This court reviews de\nnovo questions of law. United States v. McConney, 728 F.2d 1195, 1201 (9th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied,469\nU.S. 824, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984).\nA\nThe City of Los Angeles has imposed a blanket policy that subjects all felony arrestees to a visual body-cavity\nsearch. The policy mandates in part:\nArrestees booked into Department facilities on all felony offenses, and misdemeanor offenses\nrelated to the use of narcotics, shall be given a skin search. Skin searches of arrestees booked on\nother misdemeanor charges shall be made when there is probable cause to believe that an\narrestee is concealing contraband or weapons.\nWhen there is probable cause to believe that an arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons\ninside a body cavity, a visual body-cavity search shall be conducted.\n\nFacially, the policy appears to acknowledge the difference in intrusiveness between a skin search and a body-\ncavity search, requiring probable cause only for the latter. However, the LAPD has eliminated this distinction in its\n711 construction and *711 implementation of the policy. A police officer of the City of Los Angeles testified that the\nbody-cavity search was part of a skin or strip search, and so the skin search, strip search, and visual body-cavity\nsearch were really \"one and the same.\" The litigants do not take issue with this characterization. Accordingly, for\npurposes of deciding this case, we must analyze the LAPD's policy as requiring perfunctory body-cavity searches\n[6]\nof all felony arrestees.  Our ultimate task is to determine whether the searches mandated by this policy are\nreasonable under the fourth amendment.\nB\nThe intrusiveness of a body-cavity search cannot be overstated. Strip searches involving the visual exploration of\nbody cavities is dehumanizing and humiliating. The Supreme Court has commented: \"Admittedly, this practice\ninstinctively gives us the most pause.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447\n(1979); see also id. at 576-77, 99 S.Ct. at 1893-94 (\"In my view the body-cavity searches ... represent one of the\nmost grievous offenses against personal dignity and common decency.\") (Marshall, J., dissenting). See generally\nShuldiner, Visual Rape: A Look at the Dubious Legality of Strip Searches, 13 J. Marshall L.Rev. 273 (1980).\nKennedy first was forced to strip off all her clothing. After exposing her naked body to two policewomen, Kennedy\nthen was required to insert her fingers into her vagina and anus so that the policewomen could check whether\nshe had concealed any drugs or contraband in these body cavities. In response to her lawyer's questioning,\nKennedy described this frightening experience:\nKennedy: One of the ladies came into the cell with me and she started to run her fingers through\nmy hair. And I was asking her why she was doing that, and she was telling me that she was\nchecking me for fleas and for lice.\n. . . . .\nLawyer: Then, after ... they wanted you to take off each item of clothing?\nKennedy: I kept asking why I had to do that and what they were looking for, and they just told me\nthat I should just follow the procedure and do as they say.\nSo I 00 after I had gotten all of my clothes off, they told me to turn around and 00 no, first of all, they\n97 97\ntold me to bend down and touch the floor and to do like these hops like 00 like a 00 a rabbit would\n97 97\nhop.\n. . . . .\nAnd I told them that I couldn't bend down, that I had a lot of problems with my back. And they just\ntold me, they said, look, you're going to the 00 you're going to do what we're telling you to do. So,\n97\nyou know, I 00 I was scared and I did what they told me to do.\n97\nThen they told me to bend down and to squat my 00 open my legs apart as far as I could, to stick\n97\nmy fingers up my vagina, and to probe up there to, umh, I was 00 I didn't know what for.\n97\n. . . . .\nLawyer: Were there any comments made about your body?\nKennedy: Just as I turned around and stood up, then this one 00 I mean, here I am, hysterical, and\n97\nthis lady comments about the beautiful breasts I had. And I just couldn't believe 00 (witness crying.)\n97\nUmh, so anyway, they told me to turn around and to stick my buttocks in the air and to stick my\nfingers up my anus and to probe around in there for them to see if anything was visible. And it was\n\n712 really humiliating, especially when you don't know what *712 you're there for, why you had to be\nput through this in addition.\n. . . . .\nLawyer: Did they ask you to do anything else when you were in that nude condition?\nKennedy: They asked me to 00 to touch the floor. When I told them that I couldn't touch the floor\n97\nwith my buttocks in the air, one of the policemen had noticed that I had this big scar. And then\nwhen she noticed that, then they said, well, you know, you don't have to do any more. So 00\n97\nAfter the search, Kennedy was placed in a cell until, hours later, bond was posted.\nIt is against this backdrop that we must test the constitutionality of the LAPD's body-cavity search policy. See \nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nC\nThe Supreme Court has emphasized \"the limited role\" of courts in the administration of detention facilities. Block\nv. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 584-85, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 3231-32, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984). Corrections officials\npossess special expertise in this area and must struggle regularly to maintain security in a most difficult and\npotentially explosive setting. Id. (citing Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 540-41 n. 23, 99 S.Ct. at 1874-75 n. 23). This sober\nunderstanding has led the judiciary to accord special deference to the judgments of administrators concerning the\nfunctioning of correctional facilities. Id.\nNevertheless, the judiciary does play a significant, albeit limited, role. Convicted prisoners, no less those\nsuspected of having perpetrated criminal activity, retain some constitutional liberties. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 545, 99\nS.Ct. at 1877 (\"[C]onvicted prisoners do not forfeit all constitutional protections by reason of their conviction and\nconfinement in prison.\"). \"There is no iron curtain drawn between the Constitution and the prisons of this country.\"\nWolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555-56, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2974-75, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974),quoted in Wolfish,\n441 U.S. at 545, 99 S.Ct. at 1877. When litigants petition the federal courts to review the application of an\ninstitutional policy, the courts must proceed cautiously; the Supreme Court has sounded this warning\nemphatically and with considerable wisdom. Yet, at the same time, we must be equally careful not to abdicate our\nfunction as the guardians of the Constitution. In the end, there must be a delicate balancing; \"[t]here must be a\n`mutual accommodation between institutional needs and objectives and the provisions of the Constitution that are\nof general application.'\" Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 546, 99 S.Ct. at 1877 (quoting Wolff, 418 U.S. at 556, 94 S.Ct. at\n2974).\nD\nIn attempting to arrive at a mutual accommodation between the institutional needs and objectives of the LAPD\nand the shield of the Constitution, we are without a mechanistic formula. Instead, the Supreme Court has\ncautioned:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nWe already have addressed the scope of the intrusion of a visual body-cavity search. Kennedy's testimony of her\nordeal illustrates all too well the personal invasion this search entails. Next, we examine the manner in which the\nsearch was conducted. It does not appear that Kennedy's search was performed abusively. In her brief, Kennedy\ndoes make passing reference in her factual statement that an inspecting officer \"commented about her breasts,\"\n\nbut fails to argue that the search in general was abusive. We then analyze the place in which the search was\n713 conducted. Here, the policewomen accompanied Kennedy to a room in the Van Nuys jail, where she was *713\nsearched. Kennedy does not complain that the room exposed her to passersby or in any other way made the\nsearch more humiliating.\nThe critical inquiry is whether the LAPD has sufficient justification for imposing its blanket search policy. The\nLAPD proffers that \"[concerns] for safety, security, and the proper administration of the jail system provided the\nfoundation for such a policy\" and that \"[p]rison officials have a legitimate penological interest in preventing drugs,\ncontraband weapons or other unlawful objects from entering penal facilities.\" These concerns and this interest no\ndoubt are weighty. As the Wolfish Court acknowledged:\nA detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers. Smuggling of money,\ndrugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence. And inmate attempts to\nsecrete these items into the facility by concealing them in body cavities are documented in this\nrecord and in other cases.\n441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884 (citations to the record and to other cases omitted).\nNevertheless, the enacted policy, if it is to be constitutional, must be \"reasonably related\" to the penal institution's\ninterest in maintaining security. Id. at 540, 99 S.Ct. at 1874; see Watt v. City of Richardson Police Dep't, 849 F.2d\n195, 198 (5th Cir.1988) (upholding a search policy limited to those offenders charged with or having criminal\nhistory of narcotics, shoplifting, or weapons charges); cf. Thornburgh v. Abbott, ___ U.S. ___, 109 S.Ct. 1874,\n1879, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989); Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2261-2262, 96 L.Ed.2d 64\n(1987). A ham-handed approach to policy making runs the serious risk of infringing upon detainees' constitutional\nrights. In the instant case, the LAPD fails to offer a serious justification for subjecting all felony arrestees to a\nbody-cavity search as a matter of course, whereas only those misdemeanor arrestees charged with offenses\nrelating to narcotics or suspected of concealing contraband or weapons are forced to undergo such a search.\nThe LAPD asserts:\nIt is not unreasonable for the legislature and the City's police department to assume that felony\nsuspects, because of the societal judgment respecting the greater reprehensibility of their crimes,\npose a correspondingly more substantial risk of also violating the security concerns of the City's\ndetention facility.\nThe principle that courts must provide wide latitude to prison policies needed to maintain institutional order and\nsecurity, Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878, necessarily presupposes that the administrators have crafted\nthose policies with careful deliberation. The LAPD's justification is devoid of any trace of such care; instead, it\nrests on \"assum[ptions]\" and \"societal judgment[s].\" A glaring omission from the LAPD's justification is any\ndocumentation (or even assertion) that felony arrestees have attempted to smuggle contraband into the jail in\ngreater frequency than misdemeanor arrestees.\nThe district court below convincingly demonstrated that the felony/misdemeanor classification is not reasonably\nrelated to the institution's objective of maintaining security. It conducted a thoughtful examination of California's\ncriminal scheme to show that a crime's classification as a felony or misdemeanor alone cannot reasonably\nforecast an arrestee's stealthful proclivities. The district court noted that the following crimes are considered\nfelonies in California: willful tax evasion, Cal.Rev. & Tax Code ยง 19406 (West 1983), securities fraud,\nCal.Corp.Code ยง 25541 (West 1977), conspiracy to restrain trade, Cal.Bus. & Prof.Code ยง 16755 (West 1987),\nfalsification of accounts by public officials, Cal.Penal Code ยง 424, fraudulently obtaining over $400 in telephone\nservices, Cal.Penal Code ยง 502.7, and bribery of an officer in a financial institution, Cal.Penal Code ยง 639. \nKennedy, 667 F.Supp. at 702. The district court contrasted these felonies, which by dint of classification would\ntrigger a routine body-cavity search, with the following crimes that are designated misdemeanors and yet do not\n714 automatically actuate such a search: assault, Cal.Penal Code ยง 241, disturbing *714 the peace, Cal.Penal Code\nยง 415, being under the influence of a controlled substance in public, Cal.Penal Code ยง 647, and carrying a loaded\nfirearm, Cal.Penal Code ยง 12031, Kennedy, 667 F.Supp. at 703.\n\nIndeed, as the district court insightfully noted, this case itself underscores the inherent failings of a search policy\npredicated solely on a felony/misdemeanor classification. The district court described the mechanics leading to\nKennedy's search:\nAt the time Ms. Kennedy was searched, the jailer had, according to the custom and practice of the\njail, a booking slip which informed the jailer that Ms. Kennedy was being charged with grand theft\n00 a crime which in almost all instances does not involve weapons or drugs. Further, the jailer\n97\ntestified that she did not have any suspicion that Ms. Kennedy had drugs or weapons. Ms.\nKennedy was compelled nonetheless to undergo the visual body cavity search simply because the\npolicy compelled it. If for example the arresting officer decided that the television set and the other\nsmall items had a value of $399 and not $400, the minimum required for grand theft, Ms. Kennedy\nwould not have been subjected to a visual body cavity search.\nId. (footnotes omitted). Kennedy's arrest involved an ordinary squabble between two roommates. Unfortunately\nfor Kennedy, the arresting officers, making \"an educated guess at best,\" id. at 703 n. 9, valued the missing items\nin excess of $399, and transmogrified this domestic squabble into an arrest for grand theft, a felony under\nCalifornia law necessitating a body-cavity search.\nIn short, the LAPD's felony/misdemeanor classification alone indicates little about the likelihood of the arrestee's\nconcealing drugs, weapons, or contraband, the basis for subjecting an arrestee to a visual body-cavity search.\nOn balance, the LAPD's policy cannot withstand the constitutional review articulated in Wolfish.\nE\nOur conclusion that the City's search policy is unconstitutional under Wolfish does not end the analysis. The\nCourt in Wolfish delineated the constitutional test for a broad-based policy to search pretrial detainees or\nconvicted inmates that is not premised on individualized suspicion. Accordingly, the possibility remains that the\nCity of Los Angeles had an alternative basis for subjecting Kennedy to a visual body-cavity search.\nI\nPreliminarily, the Court's analysis in Wolfish requires further reflection. Ordinarily, the propriety of a search under\nthe fourth amendment depends on the particular and individual circumstances surrounding the subject of the\nsearch. Those individual circumstances are carefully considered and then tested against an established\nstandard, such as probable cause or reasonable suspicion. The Wolfish Court did not follow this customary path;\nthe exigencies of a prison setting demanded a departure. The Court recognized the necessity of according\nconsiderable deference to policies enacted to manage these exigencies and sought to strike a balance between\nthe competing needs of the institution and those of the individual. Significantly, this balancing was performed in\nthe abstract; it did not focus on the particular circumstances of the individual searched to determine the\nconstitutionality of the policy as a whole.\nThis construction of the Wolfish analysis follows ineluctably from the Court's disposition of the fourth amendment\nclaims. Wolfish involved a class action that challenged, among other things, an institutional policy that mandated\nvisual body-cavity searches of all pretrial detainees after contact visits with outsiders. The Court examined the\nconstitutionality of this policy and rejected the contention that such searches required probable cause. After\nweighing the security needs of the institution against the privacy costs exacted from the inmates, the Court\nupheld the broad-based searches. The Court concluded:\n715 But we deal here with the question whether visual body-cavity inspections as *715 contemplated\nby the [institution's] rules can ever be conducted on less than probable cause. Balancing the\nsignificant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of the\ninmates, we conclude that they can.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885.\n\nThis passage is somewhat enigmatic. A possible interpretation is that the Court's balancing was merely prefatory\nto devising a standard against which to test a particular search. Under this interpretation, the balancing yielded a\nstandard less than probable cause in the Wolfish case. The Court's holding, however, cannot sustain this\nconstruction. Ultimately, the Court found the searches resulting from this policy 00 all of them 00 to be\n97 97\nconstitutional. Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. The Court did not proceed to define a standard short of probable\ncause, such as reasonable suspicion. The Court did not remand the case for further consideration in light of its\nbalancing approach. Nor did the Court pay momentary attention to the particular facts of each individual search. It\nis, therefore, conceivable that a member of the class met a visitor for brief seconds, was observed the entire time\nby a cadre of guards, and yet was searched pursuant to the policy, clearly without individualized suspicion.\nNevertheless, this search, assuming it took place, was permissible under Wolfish; on balance, such a search was\n\"reasonable.\" See Shuldiner, supra, at 285 (noting that the Court did not examine the \"justification for conducting\nthese searches arbitrarily and en masse\").\nThe only standard we discern from Wolfish in reviewing the constitutionality of an institutional policy is the two-\npronged balancing test. Justice Powell's pithy partial dissent in that case lends considerable support to our\nreading:\nI join the opinion of the Court except the discussion and holding with respect to body-cavity\nsearches. In view of the serious intrusion on one's privacy occasioned by such a search, I think at\nleast some level of cause, such as a reasonable suspicion, should be required to justify the anal\nand genital searches described in this case. I therefore dissent on this issue.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 563, 99 S.Ct. at 1886 (Powell, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). This passage is\nrevealing: the majority was not formulating a \"level of cause\" against which the constitutionality of the particular\nsearches were to be tested. That is, the majority was not focusing on the individual basis for each search; the\nmajority's constitutional inquiry instead centered around the soundness of the policy as a whole. Cf. Rickman v.\nAvanti, 854 F.2d 327 (9th Cir.1988) (upholding, under Wolfish balancing test, visual body-cavity searches of all\nsegregation unit inmates leaving their cells); Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328 (9th Cir.1988).\n2\nIn Wolfish, the Court held the search policy to be constitutional. Our review of the LAPD's policy, in contrast, has\nled to a different conclusion. Nevertheless, a search, although not supportable under an institutional policy, is not\nper se unconstitutional. We now must examine the particular circumstances surrounding Kennedy's arrest to\ndetermine whether there was reasonable suspicion to conduct a visual body-cavity search.\nThere is an initial question whether reasonable suspicion is the proper level of cause necessary to justify the\nsearch of a felony arrestee. Numerous cases have scrutinized search policies requiring arrestees on minor\noffenses to undergo a visual body-cavity search. See, e.g., Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir.1984),cert.\ndenied,471 U.S. 1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985). In Giles, the Ninth Circuit tested the\nconstitutionality of a county policy that required all arrestees for minor traffic violations to be subjected to a strip\n[7]\nsearch. Id. at 615. The court applied the Wolfish balancing test and found the county's policy of strip searching\n716 every *716 arrestee unnecessary to protect the institution's security interest. After concluding that the Wolfish test\ncould not sustain the search, the court held that \"arrestees charged with minor offenses may be subjected to a\nstrip search only if jail officials possess a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or\nconcealing contraband.\" Id. at 617; see also Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329, 1332-33 (9th Cir.1986)\n(no immunity for public officials who unreasonably subject misdemeanor arrestees to visual body-cavity\nsearches), cert. denied,483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802\n(2d Cir.1986) (striking down blanket body-cavity search policy of arrestees charged with misdemeanors or other\nminor offenses and requiring particularized reasonable suspicion), cert. denied,483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263,\n97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987).\nThat this case involves a felony arrest does not alter the level of cause required to justify a visual body-cavity\nsearch. Logically, the classification of the offense in some cases might inform the presence of suspicion, but it\n\ndoes not inform the level of suspicion required. Indeed, the reasonable suspicion standard established in Giles\nprudently invites the consideration of the nature of the crime charged in determining the constitutionality of an\nindividual search. The court emphasized: \"Reasonable suspicion may be based on such factors as the nature of\nthe offense, the arrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.\" 746 F.2d at 617 (citations\n[8]\nomitted).\nGrand theft, a felony, thus properly could be considered in deciding whether to search Kennedy. And in some\ncases, the charge itself may give rise to reasonable suspicion. See, e.g., Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885\nF.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir.1989) (The felony of grand theft auto \"is sufficiently associated with violence to justify a\n[9]\nvisual strip search.\") (footnote omitted); Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1089 (6th Cir.1983); Watt, 849 F.2d at\n197-98 (\"Reasonableness under the fourth amendment must afford police the right to strip search arrestees\nwhose offenses posed the very threat of violence by weapons or contraband drugs that they must curtail in\nprisons.\"). This is certainly not such a case. The grand theft charge here centered around an ordinary\ndisagreement between two roommates. No weapons, no drugs, no contraband, no violent acts of any kind were\ninvolved. Nor were there any other circumstances that provided reasonable suspicion to believe that Kennedy\nconcealed contraband. The City does not contend otherwise.\nF\nIn conclusion, the district court did not err in giving a reasonable suspicion instruction. The search of Kennedy\ncould not be justified by the LAPD's policy that subjects all felony arrestees to visual body-cavity searches.\nConsequently, the search's constitutionality hinged upon whether the officials had reasonable suspicion that\nKennedy was concealing contraband. The jury reasonably determined that they did not.\n717  VII\n*717\nAppellants next claim the district court erred in awarding attorney's fees because the court based its\ndetermination of the amount on hearsay: a computer printout of the time records kept by Kennedy's counsel.\nAppellants do not contest Kennedy's entitlement to fees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; they concede that she was the\nprevailing party below.\nIf the district court indeed relied upon an improper basis in determining the amount of attorney's fees, such as\nhearsay, it abused its discretion. Cf. SEC v. Carter Hawley Hale Stores, 760 F.2d 945, 947 (9th Cir.1985) (court\nabuses its discretion if it relies on clearly erroneous facts or misapplies the law). We must therefore determine\nwhether the district court improperly admitted into evidence Kennedy's attorneys' time records. We review for an\nabuse of discretion the admission of evidence. Gauthier v. AMF, Inc., 788 F.2d 634, 635 (9th Cir.),modified,805\nF.2d 337 (1986).\nA hearsay statement is admissible as a business record under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) if the following foundational\nfacts are shown by testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness: (1) the writing is made or transmitted\nby a person with knowledge at or near the time of the incident recorded; (2) the record is kept in the course of a\nregularly conducted business activity. See United States v. Ordonez, 737 F.2d 793, 805 (9th Cir.1983); see also \nUnited States v. Linn, 880 F.2d 209, 216 (9th Cir.1989); United States v. Catabran, 836 F.2d 453, 457 (9th\nCir.1988). However, the record is not admissible if the source of information or the method or circumstances of\npreparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness. See Ordonez, 737 F.2d at 805.\nOne of the attorneys who worked on the case stated in affidavits that she entered information from her husband's\nhandwritten time records into the computer that generated the printout presented to the district court. She swore\nthat the time records were maintained during the course of her firm's representation of Kennedy. She further\nswore that she and her husband reviewed the records before his death and determined that they were accurate.\nThese statements laid a proper foundation for admission of the time records. Appellants do not persuasively\nargue that there are indications of untrustworthiness. See United States v. Licavoli, 604 F.2d 613, 622-23 (9th\n\nCir.) (district courts have broad discretion regarding determination of trustworthiness), cert. denied,446 U.S. 935,\n100 S.Ct. 2151, 64 L.Ed.2d 787 (1979). The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this evidence.\nVIII\nThe decision below is affirmed, and Kennedy's request for attorneys' fees on appeal under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 is\ngranted, see Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d 628, 634 (9th Cir.1988).\n[*] Honorable Lloyd D. George, United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.\n[1] The jury found that the search of the apartment was lawful.\n[2] The appellee urges us not to address the merits of this issue, arguing that this objection was not raised at trial.\nHowever, the appellants sufficiently preserved this objection. They objected to the instruction in general and\nproposed an alternate instruction on probable cause. Moreover, the court was aware that the appellants did not\nagree with the instructions. Martinelli v. City of Beaumont, 820 F.2d 1491, 1493 (9th Cir.1987).\n[3] Appellants urge us to adopt a stringent standard for reviewing a jury's award of punitive damage 00 substantial\n97\nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellants acknowledge that Ninth Circuit case law does not support\nthis proffered standard. Brief of Appellant at 14. \nWe reject the appellants' novel standard. Initially, they ignore the well-established principle that we cannot\noverrule Ninth Circuit precedents without convening en banc. Christoffel v. E.F. Hutton, 588 F.2d 665, 667 (9th\nCir.1978). Furthermore, the appellants appear to confound the standard the jury must consider in determining\nwhether to impose punitive damages and that which we must employ upon review. The jury's discretion is\nconsiderable, see Kraus v. Santa Fe S. Pac. Corp., 878 F.2d 1193, 1200 (9th Cir.1989), and, if supportable, will\nnot be lightly disturbed, see Fountila v. Carter, 571 F.2d 487, 492 (9th Cir.1978); see also Kraus, 878 F.2d at 1200\n.\n[4] King's testimony shows that he was aware of the \"intent permanently to deprive\" element of grand theft. And\nSchott testified that he knew intent is a critical element of grand theft (although he also seemed to believe that\ntaking someone's property for any reason constitutes theft).\n[5] The court gave further guidance: \nFactors for you to consider in determining whether the jail officials had reasonable suspicion include the nature of\nthe alleged offense, Ms. Kennedy's appearance and conduct at the time, whether she had a prior record and any\nother information the police had at the time she was booked.\nKennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep't, 667 F.Supp. 697, 704 (C.D.Cal.1987).\n[6] We, therefore, have no occasion to pass upon the constitutionality of an official policy that subjects all felony\narrestees to strip searches that do not involve visual inspection of body cavities. Nor, of course, do we have\noccasion to assess the constitutionality of a blanket search policy that more narrowly focuses on particular types\nof felony arrests.\n[7] The policy specifically required visual examination of the appellant's body cavities. The appellant, however,\nwas spared this examination, as the officer failed to comply with this requirement. Her examination was confined\nto a skin search. Although the Giles decision did not, therefore, directly involve a visual body-cavity search, the\ncourt indicated that its holding logically would engulf the more intrusive search. 746 F.2d at 616 n. 2.\n[8] It is worth noting that, were we to depart from a reasonable suspicion standard for this part of the analysis, we\nwould be required to construct a new level of cause. Reasonable suspicion, the standard for minor offenses, is\nthe least protective constitutional standard. Because a felony denotes a more serious criminal classification, we\nwould be forced to design a standard lower than reasonable suspicion. See United States v. Montoya de\nHernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 540-41, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 3310-11, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985) (rejecting \"clear indication\"\n\nas a \"third verbal standard in addition to `reasonable suspicion' and `probable cause'\" and noting that \"subtle\nverbal gradations may obscure rather than elucidate the meaning of the provision in question\").\n[9] In Dufrin, appellee was subjected to a visual body-cavity search. The appellant had a policy requiring such\nsearches of all female prisoners to be incarcerated in the Oakland County jail, irrespective of the nature of the\ncrime or the probability that contraband has been concealed. 712 F.2d at 1085. The Sixth Circuit upheld the\nconstitutionality of the search, relying heavily on the fact that the appellee was arrested on felonious assault, a\nviolent felony.

King; Stanley A.\nSchott, Defendants-Appellants.\nNos. 87-6316, 87-6400 and 87-6602.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.\nArgued and Submitted August 3, 1988.\nDecided October 11, 1989.\n921 *921 Richard M. Helgeson, Asst. City Atty., Los Angeles, Cal., for defendants-appellants.\nJoan W. Howarth and Pamela R. Lawson, ACLU Foundation of Southern Cal., Los Angeles, Cal., for plaintiff-\nappellee.\n922 *922 Before HALL and LEAVY, Circuit Judges, and GEORGE[*], District Judge.\nCYNTHIA HOLCOMB HALL, Circuit Judge:\nKaren Kennedy brought a civil rights action under section 1983 against, among others, the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment and two of its officers, James J. King and Stanley A. Schott. The case reached the jury, which after\ndetermining that Kennedy's rights were violated, awarded her compensatory and punitive damages.\nI\nKaren Kennedy and Karen Houghton were roommates in a two-bedroom apartment. The two women had entered\ninto a two-year lease on November 15, 1982. On January 21, 1983, Houghton, without prior warning, left\nKennedy a note indicating that she would be vacating the apartment the following morning. According to\nKennedy, Houghton owed her a total of $694 for her portion of rent and utilities and for bounced checks.\nThe following morning Houghton, with her parents and grandparents, arrived at the apartment with a car trailer to\nretrieve her belongings. Kennedy testified that she unsuccessfully attempted to speak with Houghton about their\ndifferences. Houghton refused to pay the debt before departing and told Kennedy that she was moving to La\nJolla, California (although in fact she was moving to Beverly Hills). Houghton left no forwarding address.\nHoughton made several trips to complete her move. During one of the trips, Kennedy moved two of Houghton's\nwicker chairs into Kennedy's bedroom and Houghton's television into the living room behind some drapes.\nKennedy retained these items as \"security\" for the debt Houghton owed her. Kennedy then installed a lockout\ndevice on the front door to prevent Houghton from entering the apartment with her key. When Houghton returned,\nshe noticed that some of her belongings were missing. She called the police.\nOfficers King and Schott responded to the call. They demanded entry into the apartment. Kennedy was with her\ndaughter and a friend of her daughter. The officers then spoke with Kennedy, who explained that she intended to\nhold the property as security for money Houghton owed her. The officers ordered Kennedy to remain on the sofa\n[1]\nwhile they searched the apartment for the missing items.  The officers' search was unsuccessful.\nOfficers King and Schott arrested Kennedy for grand theft, a felony, and escorted her to the Van Nuys jail. At the\njail, Kennedy was forced to submit to a body-cavity search. After stripping off all her clothing, Kennedy was\nrequired to expose her vaginal and anal cavities so that the two women officers could determine whether\nKennedy was concealing drugs or weapons. She was not.\n\nIn a special verdict, the jury determined that King and Schott were not entitled to qualified immunity and had\nviolated Kennedy's constitutional rights when they arrested her. The jury awarded $5,000 in actual damages\nagainst each officer, as well as $3,000 in punitive damages against King and $1,000 in punitive damages against\nSchott. The jury also determined that Kennedy's constitutional rights were violated because of the City of Los\nAngeles' policy to subject all those arrested for felonies to a body-cavity search. The jury awarded $25,000 in\nactual damages against the City.\nAppellants timely appeal from the jury's determination. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง\n1331, 1343(4). This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291.\nII\nAt the end of Kennedy's case, and at the end of trial, appellants moved for a directed verdict. On appeal, the\nofficers contend that the district court erred in failing to direct a verdict in their favor. They advance two bases to\nsupport this contention:\n923 *923 (1) that probable cause to arrest was established as a matter of law; and (2) that they were entitled to\nqualified immunity as a matter of law.\nA\nFor Kennedy to prevail under her section 1983 claim, she must establish that (1) she was deprived of a right\nsecured by the Constitution or laws of the United States; and (2) the deprivation was caused by state action. \nParratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1912-13, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981); Gorenc v. Salt River\nProject Agric. Improvement and Power Dist., 869 F.2d 503, 505 (9th Cir.1989). The appellants contend that the\ndistrict court erred in denying their motions for a directed verdict on the ground that probable cause to arrest was\nestablished as a matter of law. Appellants thus conclude that the arrest did not violate the Constitution.\n\"A directed verdict ... should not be granted unless `the evidence permits only one reasonable conclusion as to\nthe verdict.' The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and all inferences\nmust be drawn in that party's favor.\" Flores v. Pierce, 617 F.2d 1386, 1389 (9th Cir.) (quoting Kay v. Cessna\nAircraft Co., 548 F.2d 1370, 1372 (9th Cir.1977)), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 875, 101 S.Ct. 218, 66 L.Ed.2d 96\n(1980). In a section 1983 action, probable cause generally is a jury question. McKenzie v. Lamb, 738 F.2d 1005,\n1008 (9th Cir.1984). However, a directed verdict on the issue of probable cause is proper if no reasonable jury\ncould determine that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest. Id. \"`Probable cause exists when facts\nand circumstances within the arresting officer's knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy\ninformation are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable caution and prudence in the belief that the defendant is\ncommitting or has committed a crime.'\" Floyd v. Farrell, 765 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1985) (quoting State v. Lemire, 121\nN.H. 1, 424 A.2d 1135, 1138 (1981)).\nThe officers arrested Kennedy for committing grand theft, a violation of California Penal Code ยง 487. Under\nCalifornia law, theft is defined in the following manner: \"Every person who shall feloniously steal, take, carry, lead,\nor drive away the personal property of another ... is guilty of theft.\" Cal.Penal Code ยง 484(a) (West 1988). Grand\ntheft occurs \"[w]hen the money, labor or real or personal property taken is of a value exceeding four hundred\ndollars ($400)....\" Id. at ยง 487.\nThe district court recognized, and the appellants do not contest, that an element of the crime of grand theft is the\nspecific intent permanently to deprive an owner of her property. See People v. Kageler, 32 Cal.App.3d 738, 745;\n108 Cal.Rptr. 235, 239 (1973). The court instructed the jury that if it determined that the officers reasonably\nshould have known that Kennedy \"merely intended to take temporary possession of the property belonging to\nHoughton, for example, as security for a debt owed by Houghton,\" they did not have probable cause. Appellants\ndo not challenge this instruction. Part of the probable cause analysis must be whether the officers could believe\nthat Kennedy had the necessary intent.\n\nAs part of the investigation, Schott discovered from Houghton that Kennedy had told Houghton that she was\nkeeping her property as security until Houghton paid Kennedy the money she was owed. Schott admitted that he\n\"probably\" passed this information on to King when King arrived at the scene. And when King and Schott\nconfronted Kennedy in her apartment, Kennedy and a friend of her daughter explained to the officers that\nKennedy was holding the property as security until Houghton paid her debts.\nUpon reviewing the facts in this case, giving Kennedy the benefit of all reasonable inferences that may be drawn\nfrom the evidence presented at trial, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's\ndetermination that probable cause for an arrest was lacking. The officers do not contend on appeal (nor would\n924 the record support) that they believed Kennedy was holding Houghton's property for any purpose other than as \n*924 security for a debt allegedly owed. Therefore, there was no reasonable basis from which anyone could\nbelieve that Kennedy had the specific intent permanently to deprive Houghton of her property. On the contrary,\nthe jury quite properly concluded that a prudent person would not have believed that Kennedy, who was\nentangled in an ordinary neighborhood dispute, had committed grand theft. See United States v. Hoyos, 868 F.2d\n1131, 1136 (9th Cir. 1989). Consequently, the district court properly refused to direct a verdict for the appellants.\nB\nThe appellants next contend that the district court erred in refusing to grant a directed verdict on the ground of\nqualified immunity. Police officers \"are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" \nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). It is clearly established, of\ncourse, that an arrest without probable cause violates the Constitution. See McKenzie, 738 F.2d at 1007. Thus,\nthe relevant question in this case is \"whether a reasonable officer could have believed [Kennedy's warrantless\narrest] to be lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information the [arresting] officers possessed.\" \nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039-40, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); see Kraus v. County\nof Pierce, 793 F.2d 1105, 1109 (9th Cir. 1986),cert. denied,480 U.S. 932, 107 S.Ct. 1571, 94 L.Ed.2d 763\n(1987); see also Floyd, 765 F.2d at 5; Bilbrey v. Brown, 738 F.2d 1462, 1466-67 (9th Cir.1984). This court has\nstated that this inquiry is a question for the trier of fact. Schlegel v. Bebout, 841 F.2d 937, 945 (9th Cir.1988).\nHowever, if there is only one reasonable conclusion a jury could reach on this issue, a directed verdict would\nhave been proper. Cf. Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. at 3039-40 (qualified immunity issue can be argued\nas a matter of law on summary judgment).\nOur preceding discussion about the obvious lack of probable cause is dispositive of the qualified immunity\nquestion. The jury could have concluded that no reasonable officer in Schott's and King's position could have\nbelieved that Kennedy had the requisite criminal intent necessary to give rise to probable cause to arrest her for\ngrand theft. The only information the officers had about Kennedy's intent in taking Houghton's property was that\nKennedy was holding it as security. The officers heard this explanation from Houghton, Kennedy, and a friend of\nKennedy's daughter. There simply was no evidence to indicate any other intent. Accordingly, the district court did\nnot err in denying the appellants' motions for a directed verdict on qualified immunity.\nIII\nAppellants claim that the district court improperly instructed the jury on probable cause. Specifically, they contend\nthat the jury instructions improperly intertwined the standard for probable cause with the concept of sufficient\n[2]\nevidence to prove guilt.\nThis court reviews instructions to determine, viewing them as a whole, whether they adequately cover each issue\nand whether they are misleading or state the law incorrectly. Martinelli v. City of Beaumont, 820 F.2d 1491, 1493\n(9th Cir. 1987). In the contested instruction, the court told the jury in part:\nA police officer may not arrest a person for the commission of a felony without an arrest warrant\nunless he has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed by the person arrested\n\n925 whether or not a felony has in fact been *925 committed. Probable cause exists if the facts and\ncircumstances known to the officer, and of which he had reasonable trustworthy information, are\nsufficient to warrant a prudent person in believing that the suspect has committed a felony. The\nhunch, guess, conjecture or surmise of an officer is not enough, and there must be enough actual\nevidence to reasonably lead to the conclusion that the suspect has committed a felony.\nIn the present case, to constitute \"probable cause\" for the arrest of plaintiff for the commission of\nGRAND THEFT, without an arrest warrant, the evidence must establish that defendant officers\nKING and SCHOTT must have had reasonable cause to believe ALL of the following:\n1. That plaintiff stole, took or carried away the personal property of defendant HOUGHTON; AND\n2. That plaintiff had the specific intent to PERMANENTLY DEPRIVE defendant HOUGHTON of\nher property; AND\n3. That the property had to have a reasonable and fair market value of more that [sic] $400.00 at\nthe time of the theft and the locality of the theft....\nAppellants suggest that this instruction improperly \"mandates a determination by the officers of plaintiff's guilt of\ntheft rather than the probability of criminal activity.\" This argument is meritless. The instruction properly stated\nthat probable cause exists if there were sufficient facts \"to warrant a prudent person in believing that the suspect\nhas committed a felony.\" This is in accord with the law. See Floyd, 765 F.2d at 5. The court never suggested that\nthe \"reasonable cause\" necessary for arrest was the same as the \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" needed for\na criminal conviction.\nIV\nAppellants contend that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's award of punitive damages: $3,000\nagainst King and $1,000 against Schott. We disagree.\nPunitive damages may be assessed in section 1983 actions \"when the defendant's conduct is shown to be\nmotivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected\nrights of others.\" Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 1640, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983). The decision to\nimpose such sanctions is within the exclusive province of the jury. Runge v. Lee, 441 F.2d 579, 584 (9th Cir.),\n[3]\ncert. denied,404 U.S. 887, 92 S.Ct. 197, 30 L.Ed.2d 169 (1971).\nAppellants' insufficiency argument is meritless. There is no question that the officers knew that they were\nresponding to a neighborhood dispute. It is also clear that the officers had no reason to believe that Kennedy took\nHoughton's property for any reason other than as security. Yet they arrested her, even though they were aware of\n[4]\nthe specific intent requirement of grand theft.  Furthermore, although the officers testified that Kennedy's refusal\nto tell them the location of Houghton's television was a large factor in determining that probable cause existed to\n926 arrest, Kennedy testified that the officers repeatedly *926 told her to \"shut up\" when she tried to explain the\nsituation.\nUnder all these circumstances, we conclude that the jury could determine that arresting Kennedy constituted\nreckless disregard for her right not to be arrested without probable cause. See Gagnon v. Ball, 696 F.2d 17 (2d\nCir.1982) (arresting someone requesting help from police without determining whether her complaint is justified\nevidences reckless disregard for rights of others). There is ample support in the record to justify the jury's\ndetermination.\nV\nAppellants also claim that the district court committed reversible error by questioning the police officers in such a\nway as to create the impression of partiality. In support of their claim, appellants quote the following line of court\ninquiry concerning the value of the property Kennedy had taken:\n\nThe Court: That's what [her roomate [sic]] said 00\n97\nKing: That's correct.\nThe Court: 00 Isn't that right? And you never did anything but accept what she said to you; isn't that\n97\ncorrect?\nKing: That's all I could really go on at that time. I mean, I had to make a reasonable decision....\nThe Court: Do you think you could have waited a few days and inquired further?\nKing: I had a victim and a father who were insistent.\nThe Court: So you arrest people because fathers of victims tell you to do so, is that your position?\nKing: No, sir. We hadn't even gotten to that point....\nThe Court: You're not a recovery agency, are you?\n. . . . .\nYou're a police department; isn't that right?\n. . . . .\nOther people worry about recovering property, not you; isn't that right?\nKing: No, sir. Part of our mission is the recovery of property....\nThe Court: You could have waited a couple of days, couldn't you have ...?\nKing: We did look into it further, your honor.\n. . . . .\nThe Court: But you arrested her that day, didn't you?\n. . . . .\nHow much time elapsed between the time you walked into her apartment and the time you placed\nher under arrest?\nKing: [Around] 20 to 30 minutes.\nCourt: So that was the extent of your investigation?\nAppellants quote another exchange to demonstrate improper judicial questioning:\nThe Court: Couldn't you have gone down to the city attorney's office and gotten a complaint\n[before arresting Kennedy]?\n. . . . .\nSchott: I would have been remiss in my responsibilities if I did that.\nThe Court: That's your view. But could you have done that?\n. . . . .\nYou could have investigated further before making an arrest, though, couldn't you have?\nSchott: I'm not quite sure how much further I could have investigated.\n\nThe Court: Could you have checked the value of the property?\nSchott: That's not normally our procedure....\nThe Court: In this case you didn't even see the television, did you?\nSchott: No....\nIn a federal courtroom, a district judge has the undeniable right to examine witnesses and call the jury's attention\nto important evidence. Shad v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 799 F.2d 525, 531 (9th Cir. 1986). This may be\n927 necessary to \"clarify[] the evidence, control[] the orderly presentation of the evidence, confine[] counsel to *927\nevidentiary rulings, and prevent[] undue repetition of testimony.\" United States v. Malcolm, 475 F.2d 420, 427 (9th\nCir.1973),quoted in United States v. Harris, 501 F.2d 1, 10 (9th Cir.1974). However, attached to this right is an\nimportant qualification: the judge must always remain fair and impartial. \"[A] trial court must be ever mindful of the\nsensitive role it plays in a jury trial and avoid even the appearance of advocacy or partiality.\" Harris, 501 F.2d at\n10; see also Pollard v. Fennell, 400 F.2d 421, 424 (4th Cir.1968) (\"[A]s one who, in the eyes of the jury, occupies\na position of preeminence and special persuasiveness, the district judge must be assiduous in performing his\nfunction as governor of the trial dispassionately, fairly and impartially.\"). Indeed, the sensitivity of the judge's role\nhas prompted us, on many occasions, to urge judicial restraint. See, e.g., Shad, 799 F.2d at 531 (9th Cir.1986)\n(quoting Warner v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 739 F.2d 1347, 1351 (8th Cir.1984)); Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc.,\n743 F.2d 1282, 1289 (9th Cir.1984),cert. denied,469 U.S. 1190, 105 S.Ct. 963, 83 L.Ed.2d 968 (1985); Harris,\n501 F.2d at 10-11.\nThe standard for reversing a verdict because of general judicial misconduct during trial is rather stringent. \nHandgards, 743 F.2d at 1289. We must determine whether the district court's inquiry rendered the trial unfair. Id.\nThis court has stated:\nA trial court will be reversed for excessive judicial intervention only if the record \"disclose[s] actual\nbias on the part of the trial judge [or] leave[s] the reviewing court with an abiding impression that\nthe judge's remarks and questioning of witnesses projected to the jury an appearance of advocacy\nor partiality.\"\nShad, 799 F.2d at 531 (quoting Warner, 739 F.2d at 1351). And we have noted: \"Very few cases outside of the\ncriminal law area support an appellate finding of general judicial misconduct during trial.\" Handgards, 743 F.2d at\n1289; see also In re Aircrash in Bali, Indonesia, 871 F.2d 812, 815 (9th Cir.1989).\nRegrettably, the trial court's questioning was not marked by complete indifference. Some of his questions instead\nwere quite pointed and intemperate. Nevertheless, viewing the trial record as a whole, we conclude that reversal\nis not warranted. It cannot be said that the court \"repeatedly and consistently\" was discontent to allow counsel to\nquestion witnesses. See Pollard, 400 F.2d at 424 (judge impeded counsel's interrogation repeatedly, assumed\nthe role of witness as well as advocate, and misstated factual accounts, requiring reversal). The court's\nquestioning and the responses fill only eight pages of the 400 page transcript. The court did not assume a role as\nwitness by introducing evidence at trial. See id. at 425-26. Nor did the court dominate questioning of the\nwitnesses so as to preempt counsel's function. See Sit-Set, A.G. v. Universal Jet Exchange, Inc., 747 F.2d 921,\n926 (4th Cir.1984) (finding \"judicial domination of the examination of witnesses so persistent [and yet\nunnecessary] throughout the trial that the result was an effective preemption of counsel's legitimate function in\nthe adversarial process\").\nThe court began questioning King because counsel repeatedly strayed to an area of questioning that the court\nhad disallowed (strip search). The court's questions began as an attempt to get counsel back on track about the\nvalue of the television. The court's questioning of Schott was prompted by Schott's statement that he would have\nbeen negligent in his duties if he did not arrest Kennedy immediately, to which the court expressed\nunderstandable skepticism. Cf. Pollard, 400 F.2d at 424-25 (no apparent justification for judicial intervention); Sit-\nSet, 747 F.2d at 926 (same). Questions indicating skepticism are not improper if witnesses are permitted to\nrespond. Shad, 799 F.2d at 531. Moreover, the court explained to the jury that the court's questions were not\nindicative of its feelings about the case. Such a disclaimer is not a panacea for pervasive and biased judicial\n\naction. See Sit-Set, 747 F.2d at 926. But given the limited scope of the court's intervention in the present case,\n928 we believe this explanation alleviated any *928 appearance of impartiality the judge's questioning may have\nconveyed. See Shad, 799 F.2d at 531; see also United States v. Laurins, 857 F.2d 529, 538 (9th Cir.1988),cert.\ndenied,___ U.S. ___, 109 S.Ct. 3215, 106 L.Ed.2d 565 (1989).\nVI\nThe Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has a policy requiring all those who are arrested on suspicion of\nhaving committed a felony to be subjected to a body-cavity search. The jury found that this policy, which resulted\nin Kennedy being searched, violated her rights. Kennedy was awarded $25,000 in actual damages against the\nCity of Los Angeles.\nAppellants challenge the district court's instruction that the body-cavity search of Kennedy would violate her\nfourth amendment rights unless the jail officials \"had a reasonable suspicion that she was carrying or concealing\n[5]\ncontraband or a weapon or that she was suffering from a communicable disease.\"  Appellants moved for a new\ntrial, which was denied. The district court issued an opinion holding that the LAPD's policy of conducting a visual\nbody-cavity search of all felony arrest detainees, regardless of reasonable suspicion, violates the fourth\namendment. Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Department, 667 F.Supp. 697 (C.D.Cal.1987).\nThis court reviews instructions to determine whether viewing them as a whole, they adequately cover each issue\nand whether they are misleading or state the law incorrectly. Martinelli, 820 F.2d at 1493. This court reviews de\nnovo questions of law. United States v. McConney, 728 F.2d 1195, 1201 (9th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied,469\nU.S. 824, 105 S.Ct. 101, 83 L.Ed.2d 46 (1984).\nA\nThe City of Los Angeles has imposed a blanket policy that subjects all felony arrestees to a visual body-cavity\nsearch. The policy mandates in part:\nArrestees booked into Department facilities on all felony offenses, and misdemeanor offenses\nrelated to the use of narcotics, shall be given a skin search. Skin searches of arrestees booked on\nother misdemeanor charges shall be made when there is probable cause to believe that an\narrestee is concealing contraband or weapons.\nWhen there is probable cause to believe that an arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons\ninside a body cavity, a visual body-cavity search shall be conducted.\nFacially, the policy appears to acknowledge the difference in intrusiveness between a skin search and a body-\ncavity search, requiring probable cause only for the latter. However, the LAPD has eliminated this distinction in its\nconstruction and implementation of the policy. A police officer of the City of Los Angeles testified that the body-\ncavity search was part of a skin or strip search, and so the skin search, strip search, and visual body-cavity\nsearch were really \"one and the same.\" The litigants do not take issue with this characterization. Accordingly, for\npurposes of deciding this case, we must analyze the LAPD's policy as requiring perfunctory body-cavity searches\n[6]\nof all felony arrestees.  Our ultimate task is to determine whether the searches mandated by this policy are\nreasonable under the fourth amendment.\nB\n929 The intrusiveness of a body-cavity search cannot be overstated. Strip searches involving *929 the visual\nexploration of body cavities are dehumanizing and humiliating. The Supreme Court has commented: \"Admittedly,\nthis practice instinctively gives us the most pause.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979); see also id. at 576-77, 99 S.Ct. at 1893-94 (\"In my view the body-cavity searches ...\nrepresent one of the most grievous offenses against personal dignity and common decency.\") (Marshall, J.,\n\ndissenting). See generally Shuldiner, Visual Rape: A Look at the Dubious Legality of Strip Searches, 13 J.\nMarshall L.Rev. 273 (1980).\nKennedy first was forced to strip off all her clothing. After exposing her naked body to two policewomen, Kennedy\nthen was required to insert her fingers into her vagina and anus so that the policewomen could check whether\nshe had concealed any drugs or contraband in these body cavities. In response to her lawyer's questioning,\nKennedy described this frightening experience:\nKennedy: One of the ladies came into the cell with me and she started to run her fingers through\nmy hair. And I was asking her why she was doing that, and she was telling me that she was\nchecking me for fleas and for lice.\n. . . . .\nLawyer: Then, after ... they wanted you to take off each item of clothing?\nKennedy: I kept asking why I had to do that and what they were looking for, and they just told me\nthat I should just follow the procedure and do as they say.\nSo I 00 after I had gotten all of my clothes off, they told me to turn around and 00 no, first of all, they\n97 97\ntold me to bend down and touch the floor and to do like these hops like 00 like a 00 a rabbit would\n97 97\nhop.\n. . . . .\nAnd I told them that I couldn't bend down, that I had a lot of problems with my back. And they just\ntold me, they said, look, you're going to the 00 you're going to do what we're telling you to do. So,\n97\nyou know, I 00 I was scared and I did what they told me to do.\n97\nThen they told me to bend down and to squat my 00 open my legs apart as far as I could, to stick\n97\nmy fingers up my vagina, and to probe up there to, umh, I was 00 I didn't know what for.\n97\n. . . . .\nLawyer: Were there any comments made about your body?\nKennedy: Just as I turned around and stood up, then this one 00 I mean, here I am, hysterical, and\n97\nthis lady comments about the beautiful breasts I had. And I just couldn't believe 00 (witness crying.)\n97\nUmh, so anyway, they told me to turn around and to stick my buttocks in the air and to stick my\nfingers up my anus and to probe around in there for them to see if anything was visible. And it was\nreally humiliating, especially when you don't know what you're there for, why you had to be put\nthrough this in addition.\n. . . . .\nLawyer: Did they ask you to do anything else when you were in that nude condition?\nKennedy: They asked me to 00 to touch the floor. When I told them that I couldn't touch the floor\n97\nwith my buttocks in the air, one of the policemen had noticed that I had this big scar. And then\nwhen she noticed that, then they said, well, you know, you don't have to do any more. So 00\n97\nAfter the search, Kennedy was placed in a cell until, hours later, bond was posted.\nIt is against this backdrop that we must test the constitutionality of the LAPD's body-cavity search policy. See \nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85.\n\nC\nThe Supreme Court has emphasized \"the limited role\" of courts in the administration of detention facilities. Block\nv. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 584-85, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 3231-32, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984). Corrections officials\n930 possess special expertise in *930 this area and must struggle regularly to maintain security in a most difficult and\npotentially explosive setting. Id. (citing Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 540-41 n. 23, 99 S.Ct. at 1875 n. 23). This sober\nunderstanding has led the judiciary to accord special deference to the judgments of administrators concerning the\nfunctioning of correctional facilities. Id.\nNevertheless, the judiciary does play a significant, albeit limited, role. Convicted prisoners, no less those\nsuspected of having perpetrated criminal activity, retain some constitutional liberties. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 545, 99\nS.Ct. at 1877 (\"[C]onvicted prisoners do not forfeit all constitutional protections by reason of their conviction and\nconfinement in prison.\"). \"There is no iron curtain drawn between the Constitution and the prisons of this country.\"\nWolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555-56, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2974-75, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974),quoted in Wolfish,\n441 U.S. at 545, 99 S.Ct. at 1877. When litigants petition the federal courts to review the application of an\ninstitutional policy, the courts must proceed cautiously; the Supreme Court has sounded this warning\nemphatically and with considerable wisdom. Yet, at the same time, we must be equally careful not to abdicate our\nfunction as the guardians of the Constitution. In the end, there must be a delicate balancing; \"[t]here must be a\n`mutual accommodation between institutional needs and objectives and the provisions of the Constitution that are\nof general application.'\" Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 546, 99 S.Ct. at 1878 (quoting Wolff, 418 U.S. at 556, 94 S.Ct. at\n1878).\nD\nIn attempting to arrive at a mutual accommodation between the institutional needs and objectives of the LAPD\nand the shield of the Constitution, we are without a mechanistic formula. Instead, the Supreme Court has\ncautioned:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nId. at 559, 94 S.Ct. at 2976.\nWe already have addressed the scope of the intrusion of a visual body-cavity search. Kennedy's testimony of her\nordeal illustrates all too well the personal invasion this search entails. Next, we examine the manner in which the\nsearch was conducted. It does not appear that Kennedy's search was performed abusively. In her brief, Kennedy\ndoes make passing reference in her factual statement that an inspecting officer \"commented about her breasts,\"\nbut fails to argue that the search in general was abusive. We then analyze the place in which the search was\nconducted. Here, the policewomen accompanied Kennedy to a room in the Van Nuys jail, where she was\nsearched. Kennedy does not complain that the room exposed her to passersby or in any other way made the\nsearch more humiliating.\nThe critical inquiry is whether the LAPD has sufficient justification for imposing its blanket search policy. The\nLAPD proffers that \"[concerns] for safety, security, and the proper administration of the jail system provided the\nfoundation for such a policy\" and that \"[p]rison officials have a legitimate penological interest in preventing drugs,\ncontraband weapons or other unlawful objects from entering penal facilities.\" These concerns and this interest no\ndoubt are weighty. As the Wolfish Court acknowledged:\nA detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers. Smuggling of money,\ndrugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence. And inmate attempts to\n\nsecrete these items into the facility by concealing them in body cavities are documented in this\nrecord and in other cases.\n441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884 (citations to the record and to other cases omitted).\n931 *931 Nevertheless, the enacted policy, if it is to be constitutional, must be \"reasonably related\" to the penal\ninstitution's interest in maintaining security. Id. at 540, 99 S.Ct. at 1874-75; see Watt v. City of Richardson Police\nDep't, 849 F.2d 195, 198 (5th Cir.1988) (upholding a search policy limited to those offenders charged with or\nhaving criminal history of narcotics, shoplifting, or weapons charges); cf. Thornburgh v. Abbott, ___ U.S. ___, 109\nS.Ct. 1874, 1879, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989); Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2261-62, 96\nL.Ed.2d 64 (1987). A ham-handed approach to policy making runs the serious risk of infringing upon detainees'\nconstitutional rights. In the instant case, the LAPD fails to offer a serious justification for subjecting all felony\narrestees to a body-cavity search as a matter of course, whereas only those misdemeanor arrestees charged\nwith offenses relating to narcotics or suspected of concealing contraband or weapons are forced to undergo such\na search. The LAPD asserts:\nIt is not unreasonable for the legislature and the City's police department to assume that felony\nsuspects, because of the societal judgment respecting the greater reprehensibility of their crimes,\npose a correspondingly more substantial risk of also violating the security concerns of the City's\ndetention facility.\nThe principle that courts must provide wide latitude to prison policies needed to maintain institutional order and\nsecurity, Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878, necessarily presupposes that the administrators have crafted\nthose policies with careful deliberation. The LAPD's justification is devoid of any trace of such care; instead, it\nrests on \"assum[ptions]\" and \"societal judgment[s].\" A glaring omission from the LAPD's justification is any\ndocumentation (or even assertion) that felony arrestees have attempted to smuggle contraband into the jail in\ngreater frequency than misdemeanor arrestees.\nThe district court below convincingly demonstrated that the felony/misdemeanor classification is not reasonably\nrelated to the institution's objective of maintaining security. It conducted a thoughtful examination of California's\ncriminal scheme to show that a crime's classification as a felony or misdemeanor alone cannot reasonably\nforecast an arrestee's stealthful proclivities. The district court noted that the following crimes are considered\nfelonies in California: willful tax evasion, Cal.Rev. & Tax Code ยง 19406 (West 1983), securities fraud,\nCal.Corp.Code ยง 25541 (West 1977), conspiracy to restrain trade, Cal.Bus. & Prof.Code ยง 16755 (West 1987),\nfalsification of accounts by public officials, Cal.Penal Code ยง 424, fraudulently obtaining over $400 in telephone\nservices, Cal.Penal Code ยง 502.7, and bribery of an officer in a financial institution, Cal.Penal Code ยง 639. \nKennedy, 667 F.Supp. at 702. The district court contrasted these felonies, which by dint of classification would\ntrigger a routine body-cavity search, with the following crimes that are designated misdemeanors and yet do not\nautomatically actuate such a search: assault, Cal.Penal Code ยง 241, disturbing the peace, Cal.Penal Code ยง 415,\nbeing under the influence of a controlled substance in public, Cal.Penal Code ยง 647, and carrying a loaded\nfirearm, Cal.Penal Code ยง 12031. Kennedy, 667 F.Supp. at 703.\nIndeed, as the district court insightfully noted, this case itself underscores the inherent failings of a search policy\npredicated solely on a felony/misdemeanor classification. The district court described the mechanics leading to\nKennedy's search:\nAt the time Ms. Kennedy was searched, the jailer had, according to the custom and practice of the\njail, a booking slip which informed the jailer that Ms. Kennedy was being charged with grand theft\n00 a crime which in almost all instances does not involve weapons or drugs. Further, the jailer\n97\ntestified that she did not have any suspicion that Ms. Kennedy had drugs or weapons. Ms.\nKennedy was compelled nonetheless to undergo the visual body cavity search simply because the\npolicy compelled it. If for example the arresting officer decided that the television set and the other\n932 small items had a value of $399 and not $400, the minimum required for grand *932 theft, Ms.\nKennedy would not have been subjected to a visual body cavity search.\n\nId. (footnotes omitted). Kennedy's arrest involved an ordinary squabble between two roommates. Unfortunately\nfor Kennedy, the arresting officers, making \"an educated guess at best,\" id. at 703 n. 9, valued the missing items\nin excess of $399, and transmogrified this domestic squabble into an arrest for grand theft, a felony under\nCalifornia law necessitating a body-cavity search.\nIn short, the LAPD's felony/misdemeanor classification alone indicates little about the likelihood of the arrestee's\nconcealing drugs, weapons, or contraband, the basis for subjecting an arrestee to a visual body-cavity search.\nOn balance, the LAPD's policy cannot withstand the constitutional review articulated in Wolfish.\nE\nOur conclusion that the City's search policy is unconstitutional under Wolfish does not end the analysis. The\nCourt in Wolfish delineated the constitutional test for a broad-based policy to search pretrial detainees or\nconvicted inmates that is not premised on individualized suspicion. Accordingly, the possibility remains that the\nCity of Los Angeles had an alternative basis for subjecting Kennedy to a visual body-cavity search.\n1\nPreliminarily, the Court's analysis in Wolfish requires further reflection. Ordinarily, the propriety of a search under\nthe fourth amendment depends on the particular and individual circumstances surrounding the subject of the\nsearch. Those individual circumstances are carefully considered and then tested against an established\nstandard, such as probable cause or reasonable suspicion. The Wolfish Court did not follow this customary path;\nthe exigencies of a prison setting demanded a departure. The Court recognized the necessity of according\nconsiderable deference to policies enacted to manage these exigencies and sought to strike a balance between\nthe competing needs of the institution and those of the individual. Significantly, this balancing was performed in\nthe abstract; it did not focus on the particular circumstances of the individual searched to determine the\nconstitutionality of the policy as a whole.\nThis construction of the Wolfish analysis follows ineluctably from the Court's disposition of the fourth amendment\nclaims. Wolfish involved a class action that challenged, among other things, an institutional policy that mandated\nvisual body-cavity searches of all pretrial detainees after contact visits with outsiders. The Court examined the\nconstitutionality of this policy and rejected the contention that such searches required probable cause. After\nweighing the security needs of the institution against the privacy costs exacted from the inmates, the Court\nupheld the broad-based searches. The Court concluded:\nBut we deal here with the question whether visual body-cavity inspections as contemplated by the\n[institution's] rules can ever be conducted on less than probable cause. Balancing the significant\nand legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of the inmates, we\nconclude that they can.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885.\nThis passage is somewhat enigmatic. A possible interpretation is that the Court's balancing was merely prefatory\nto devising a standard against which to test a particular search. Under this interpretation, the balancing yielded a\nstandard less than probable cause in the Wolfish case. The Court's holding, however, cannot sustain this\nconstruction. Ultimately, the Court found the searches resulting from this policy 00 all of them 00 to be\n97 97\nconstitutional. Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. The Court did not proceed to define a standard short of probable\ncause, such as reasonable suspicion. The Court did not remand the case for further consideration in light of its\nbalancing approach. Nor did the Court pay momentary attention to the particular facts of each individual search. It\nis, therefore, conceivable that a member of the class met a visitor for brief seconds, was observed the entire time\n933 by a cadre of guards, and *933 yet was searched pursuant to the policy, clearly without individualized suspicion.\nNevertheless, this search, assuming it took place, was permissible under Wolfish; on balance, such a search was\n\"reasonable.\" See Shuldiner, supra, at 285 (noting that the Court did not examine the \"justification for conducting\nthese searches arbitrarily and en masse\").\n\nThe only standard we discern from Wolfish in reviewing the constitutionality of an institutional policy is the two-\npronged balancing test. Justice Powell's pithy partial dissent in that case lends considerable support to our\nreading:\nI join the opinion of the Court except the discussion and holding with respect to body-cavity\nsearches. In view of the serious intrusion on one's privacy occasioned by such a search, I think at\nleast some level of cause, such as a reasonable suspicion, should be required to justify the anal\nand genital searches described in this case. I therefore dissent on this issue.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 563, 99 S.Ct. at 1886-87 (Powell, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). This passage is\nrevealing: the majority was not formulating a \"level of cause\" against which the constitutionality of the particular\nsearches were to be tested. That is, the majority was not focusing on the individual basis for each search; the\nmajority's constitutional inquiry instead centered around the soundness of the policy as a whole. Cf. Rickman v.\nAvaniti, 854 F.2d 327 (9th Cir.1988) (upholding, under Wolfish balancing test, visual body-cavity searches of all\nsegregation unit inmates leaving their cells); Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328 (9th Cir.1988).\n2\nIn Wolfish, the Court held the search policy to be constitutional. Our review of the LAPD's policy, in contrast, has\nled to a different conclusion. Nevertheless, a search, although not supportable under an institutional policy, is not\nper se unconstitutional. We now must examine the particular circumstances surrounding Kennedy's arrest to\ndetermine whether there was reasonable suspicion to conduct a visual body-cavity search.\nThere is an initial question whether reasonable suspicion is the proper level of cause necessary to justify the\nsearch of a felony arrestee. Numerous cases have scrutinized search policies requiring arrestees on minor\noffenses to undergo a visual body-cavity search. See, e.g., Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir.1984),cert.\ndenied,471 U.S. 1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985). In Giles, the Ninth Circuit tested the\nconstitutionality of a county policy that required all arrestees for minor traffic violations to be subjected to a strip\n[7]\nsearch. Id. at 615. The court applied the Wolfish balancing test and found the county's policy of strip searching\nevery arrestee unnecessary to protect the institution's security interest. After concluding that the Wolfish test\ncould not sustain the search, the court held that \"arrestees charged with minor offenses may be subjected to a\nstrip search only if jail officials possess a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or\nconcealing contraband.\" Id. at 617; see also Ward v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329, 1332-33 (9th Cir.1986)\n(no immunity for public officials who unreasonably subject misdemeanor arrestees to visual body-cavity\nsearches), cert. denied,483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802\n(2d Cir.1986) (striking down blanket body-cavity search policy of arrestees charged with misdemeanors or other\nminor offenses and requiring particularized reasonable suspicion), cert. denied,483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263,\n97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987).\nThat this case involves a felony arrest does not alter the level of cause required to justify a visual body-cavity\n934 search. Logically, the classification of the offense in *934 some cases might inform the presence of suspicion, but\nit does not inform the level of suspicion required. Indeed, the reasonable suspicion standard established in Giles\nprudently invites the consideration of the nature of the crime charged in determining the constitutionality of an\nindividual search. The court emphasized: \"Reasonable suspicion may be based on such factors as the nature of\nthe offense, the arrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.\" 746 F.2d at 617 (citations\n[8]\nomitted).\nGrand theft, a felony, thus properly could be considered in deciding whether to search Kennedy. And in some\ncases, the charge itself may give rise to reasonable suspicion. See, e.g., Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1089\n[9]\n(6th Cir.1983); Watt, 849 F.2d at 197-98 (\"Reasonableness under the fourth amendment must afford police the\nright to strip search arrestees whose offenses posed the very threat of violence by weapons or contraband drugs\nthat they must curtail in prisons.\"). This is certainly not such a case. The grand theft charge here centered around\nan ordinary disagreement between two roommates. No weapons, no drugs, no contraband, no violent acts of any\n\nkind were involved. Nor were there any other circumstances that provided reasonable suspicion to believe that\nKennedy concealed contraband. The City does not contend otherwise.\nF\nIn conclusion, the district court did not err in giving a reasonable suspicion instruction. The search of Kennedy\ncould not be justified by the LAPD's policy that subjects all felony arrestees to visual body-cavity searches.\nConsequently, the search's constitutionality hinged upon whether the officials had reasonable suspicion that\nKennedy was concealing contraband. The jury reasonably determined that they did not.\nVII\nAppellants next claim the district court erred in awarding attorneys' fees because the court based its\ndetermination of the amount on hearsay: a computer printout of the time records kept by Kennedy's counsel.\nAppellants do not contest Kennedy's entitlement to fees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; they concede that she was the\nprevailing party below.\nIf the district court indeed relied upon an improper basis in determining the amount of attorneys' fees, such as\nhearsay, it abused its discretion. Cf. SEC v. Carter Hawley Hale Stores, 760 F.2d 945, 947 (9th Cir.1985) (court\nabuses its discretion if it relies on clearly erroneous facts or misapplies the law). We must therefore determine\nwhether the district court improperly admitted into evidence Kennedy's attorneys' time records. We review for an\nabuse of discretion the admission of evidence. Gauthier v. AMF, Inc., 788 F.2d 634, 635 (9th Cir.),modified,805\nF.2d 337 (1986).\nA hearsay statement is admissible as a business record under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) if the following foundational\nfacts are shown by testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness: (1) the writing is made or transmitted\n935 by a person with *935 knowledge at or near the time of the incident recorded; (2) the record is kept in the course\nof a regularly conducted business activity. See United States v. Ordonez, 737 F.2d 793, 805 (9th Cir.1983); see\nalso United States v. Linn, 880 F.2d 209, 216 (9th Cir.1989); United States v. Catabran, 836 F.2d 453, 457 (9th\nCir.1988). However, the record is not admissible if the source of information or the method or circumstances of\npreparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness. See Ordonez, 737 F.2d at 805.\nOne of the attorneys who worked on the case stated in affidavits that she entered information from her husband's\nhandwritten time records into the computer that generated the printout presented to the district court. She swore\nthat the time records were maintained during the course of her firm's representation of Kennedy. She further\nswore that she and her husband reviewed the records before his death and determined that they were accurate.\nThese statements laid a proper foundation for admission of the time records. Appellants do not persuasively\nargue that there are indications of untrustworthiness. See United States v. Licavoli, 604 F.2d 613, 622-23 (9th\nCir.) (district courts have broad discretion regarding determination of trustworthiness), cert. denied,446 U.S. 935,\n100 S.Ct. 2151, 64 L.Ed.2d 787 (1979). The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this evidence.\nVIII\nThe decision below is affirmed, and Kennedy's request for attorneys' fees on appeal under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 is\ngranted, see Leer v. Murphy, 844 F.2d 628, 634 (9th Cir.1988).\n[*] Honorable Lloyd D. George, United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.\n[1] The jury found that the search of the apartment was lawful.\n[2] The appellee urges us not to address the merits of this issue, arguing that this objection was not raised at trial.\nHowever, the appellants sufficiently preserved this objection. They objected to the instruction in general and\n\nproposed an alternate instruction on probable cause. Moreover, the court was aware that the appellants did not\nagree with the instructions. Martinelli v. City of Beaumont, 820 F.2d 1491, 1493 (9th Cir.1987).\n[3] Appellants urge us to adopt a stringent standard for reviewing a jury's award of punitive damage 00 substantial\n97\nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellants acknowledge that Ninth Circuit case law does not support\nthis proffered standard. Brief of Appellant at 14. \nWe reject the appellants' novel standard. Initially, they ignore the well-established principle that we cannot\noverrule Ninth Circuit precedents without convening en banc. Christoffel v. E.F. Hutton, 588 F.2d 665, 667 (9th\nCir.1978). Furthermore, the appellants appear to confound the standard the jury must consider in determining\nwhether to impose punitive damages and that which we must employ upon review. The jury's discretion is\nconsiderable, see Kraus v. Santa Fe S. Pac. Corp., 878 F.2d 1193, 1200 (9th Cir.1989), and, if supportable, will\nnot be lightly disturbed, see Fountila v. Carter, 571 F.2d 487, 492 (9th Cir.1978); see also Kraus, 878 F.2d at 1200\n.\n[4] King's testimony shows that he was aware of the \"intent permanently to deprive\" element of grand theft. And\nSchott testified that he knew intent is a critical element of grand theft (although he also seemed to believe that\ntaking someone's property for any reason constitutes theft).\n[5] The court gave further guidance: \nFactors for you to consider in determining whether the jail officials had reasonable suspicion include the nature of\nthe alleged offense, Ms. Kennedy's appearance and conduct at the time, whether she had a prior record and any\nother information the police had at the time she was booked.\nKennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep't, 667 F.Supp. 697, 704 (C.D.Cal.1987).\n[6] We, therefore, have no occasion to pass upon the constitutionality of an official policy that subjects all felony\narrestees to strip searches that do not involve visual inspection of body cavities. Nor, of course, do we have\noccasion to assess the constitutionality of a blanket search policy that more narrowly focuses on particular types\nof felony arrests.\n[7] The policy specifically required visual examination of the appellant's body cavities. The appellant, however,\nwas spared this examination, as the officer failed to comply with this requirement. Her examination was confined\nto a skin search. Although the Giles decision did not, therefore, directly involve a visual body-cavity search, the\ncourt indicated that its holding logically would engulf the more intrusive search. 746 F.2d at 616 n. 2.\n[8] It is worth noting that, were we to depart from a reasonable suspicion standard for this part of the analysis, we\nwould be required to construct a new level of cause. Reasonable suspicion, the standard for minor offenses, is\nthe least protective constitutional standard. Because a felony denotes a more serious criminal classification, we\nwould be forced to design a standard lower than reasonable suspicion. See United States v. Montoya de\nHernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 540-41, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 3310-11, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985) (rejecting \"clear indication\"\nas a \"third verbal standard in addition to `reasonable suspicion' and `probable cause'\" and noting that \"subtle\nverbal gradations may obscure rather than elucidate the meaning of the provision in question\").\n[9] In Dufrin, appellee was subjected to a visual body-cavity search. The appellant had a policy requiring such\nsearches of all female prisoners to be incarcerated in the Oakland County jail, irrespective of the nature of the\ncrime or the probability that contraband has been concealed. 712 F.2d at 1085. The Sixth Circuit upheld the\nconstitutionality of the search, relying heavily on the fact that the appellee was arrested on felonious assault, a\nviolent felony.
