    "summary": "<p>A woman who was strip searched after refusing to take a breathalyzer test after an arrest for a DWI brought this action in the Eastern District of Virginia against Arlington County and various judicial, prosecutorial, and law enforcement officers to challenge the County&rsquo;s blanket strip search policy for all arrestees. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and the Fifth Amendment right to counsel based on a claim that she was not allowed to consult an attorney. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The case was assigned to Senior Judge Oren R. Lewis.</p>\r\n<p>The district court granted directed verdicts and summary judgments against the plaintiff on September 30, 1980. Judge Oren held that the plaintiff&rsquo;s right to counsel was not violated because she was allowed to call a lawyer after being formally charged and did not have a right to counsel prior to being strip searched. Further, the court held that the plaintiff failed to meet her burden to show that the County had exaggerated its response to genuine security consideration by activity the strip search practice. 500 F.Supp. 502.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part on October 7, 1981. The court held that the plaintiff&rsquo;s right to counsel had not been violated, but that the blanket strip search policy was unconstitutional and that, at a minimum, officers must have reasonable suspicion to believe a person is concealing contraband to warrant a strip search. 660 F.2d 1007.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and requested a stay of the mandate of the Fourth Circuit. The request was denied by the Chief Justice but granted in a reapplication addressed to Justice Rehnquist. On December 9, 1981 Justice Rehnquist issued a temporary stay pending consideration of the application for stay by the full court and wrote that strip search policies need not be conditioned on probable cause. 102 S.Ct. 284. Rehnquist&rsquo;s opinion did not persuade the rest of the court. The full court denied the application for the stay on December 11, 1981 and denied a petition for writ of certiorari on February 22, 1982. This case is closed.</p>",

LEWIS, Senior District Judge.\nThis § 1983 suit for damages and for declaratory and injunctive relief for violation of plaintiff's Constitutional rights\nby various present and former officers of Arlington County, Virginia grew out of her arrest and commitment for\ndriving while intoxicated, and her unreasonable refusal to take a breathalyzer test as provided for by § 18.2-268\n(c), (n) of the Code of Virginia.\nShe claims she was denied her Constitutional right to the assistance of counsel and to be free from unreasonable\nsearches, and has asked this Court to permanently enjoin and restrain the defendants from maintaining and/or\nenforcing any policy or practice which denies those charged with driving while intoxicated from consulting with\ntheir attorney upon request-and which subjects those so charged and committed to being strip-searched, unless\nthe Sheriff or his deputies have reasonable grounds to believe that contraband and/or weapons are being\nconcealed on such person.\nThe case was heard on the merits, and the claim for damages was dismissed-the claim for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief was deferred pending further briefing and argument of counsel-those briefs have now been filed\nand considered.\nThere was little, if any, dispute as to what happened on the day in question:\nThe plaintiff admits that she had had two drinks shortly prior to the time (about 7:30 p. m.) she\nbecame involved in a two-car accident just beyond the intersection of Courthouse Road and\nArlington Boulevard.\nOfficer Shortt, the investigating police officer, after interviewing and observing the plaintiff,\nsuspected she might be under the influence of intoxicating beverages.\nHe gave her the requisite field tests and told her that he would have to take her to the Violations\nBureau for the required breathalyzer test.\n504 She insisted upon first calling her lawyer friend, Lorelei Haig, whom she had *504 just dropped off\na few minutes before the accident.\n\nThe officer would not let her leave the scene to make the call-after some 30 minutes, she was\ntaken to the Violations Bureau in one of the police patrol cars-her automobile driven by the police\nfollowed.\nThey arrived at the Violations Bureau at about 8:15 p. m.-Officer Shortt got there about 8:20 p. m.\nHe again advised her of her rights and obligations under Virginia's \"implied consent\" law, and\nmade arrangements for one of the more experienced police officers to administer the required\nbreathalyzer test.\nThe plaintiff again insisted upon talking to Lorelei Haig before deciding whether to take the test-\nshe said she wanted somebody there on her side.\nShe was not allowed to make the requested telephone call.\nWhen she couldn't or wouldn't make up her mind, she was given a copy of §§ 18.2-266-68 of the \nVirginia Code to read.\nWhen she kept stalling for the better part of an hour, Officer Shortt had the Magistrate on duty\nadvise her of her rights and obligations under the law.\nWhen the Magistrate advised her of the law requiring the breathalyzer test, and the penalty for\nrefusal (revocation of driver's license for 90 days), she decided to take the test.\nInstead of so doing, she stalled for another ten minutes or so.\nOfficer Shortt (at approximately 9:55 p. m.) then obtained warrants from Magistrate Vance\ncharging her with DWI and unreasonable refusal under Virginia Code §§ 18.2-266-68.\nThe warrants were served upon her immediately-and she asked the Magistrate to release her on\nher personal bond-he told her that he would do so but that she would have to be detained for four\nhours or until some responsible person could come and get her-she said she could get someone\nto come if she could use the telephone.\nThe Magistrate wrote on the commitment papers that she be permitted to use the telephone to call\nher lawyer friend.\nShe was taken to the Sheriff's office at approximately 10:00 o'clock-a matron inventoried her\npersonal property and took her to one of the holding cells where she was strip-searched for\nconcealed weapons.\nThe strip-search was conducted in private, with no one being present but the matron and the\nplaintiff. She was asked to take off her clothes, one at a time, to hand them to the matron, and to\nturn around for visual inspection. She did so and her clothes were immediately returned to her.\nAfter the strip-search had been completed, which took less than five minutes, the plaintiff was\nallowed to use the telephone. She called her lawyer friend who came and got her about an hour\nlater.\nThe plaintiff is a practicing attorney in Arlington and was a former Assistant Commonwealth\nAttorney-she knew one of the Magistrates.\nThe record is silent as to whether she knew any of the policemen or deputy sheriffs who were on\nduty that night, or whether any of them knew her.\nNo one has a Constitutional right to leave the scene of an accident to call their lawyer while their sobriety is being\nchecked-or to have their lawyer present or to talk with her on the telephone in re whether or not she should take\nthe required breathalyzer or blood test.\n\nThe plaintiff knew, or should have known, as a practicing and former Assistant Commonwealth Attorney, that such\nblood or breath test must be taken within two hours from the time of the alleged offense.\nThe accident in question occurred at about 7:30 p. m. It took her until almost 10:00 o'clock to make up her mind\nas to whether or not she was going to take the breathalyzer test, after having been fully advised by both the\n505 arresting officer and *505 the Magistrate of the law requiring that a blood or breath test be taken and the penalty\nfor refusing.\nThe warrants for her arrest for DWI and unreasonable refusal were issued and served upon her at approximately\n10:00 p. m.\nOne's Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not accrue immediately on arrest pursuant to a warrant. See \nUnited States v. DuVall (2d Cir. 1976) 537 F.2d at p. 15-it does not accrue until \"at least at, or after the time\njudicial proceedings have been initiated-whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment,\ninformation or arraignment.\" See Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977).\nNo judicial proceedings were pending against Ms. Logan when she requested the investigating police officer to\nallow her to call her lawyer friend-she was allowed to call her lawyer within five or ten minutes from the time she\nwas formally charged.\nThe plaintiff conceded that Officer Shortt had probable cause to arrest her on the night in question. Her Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel on the night in question was not abridged-and the Court so holds.\nThe plaintiff does not question that the Sheriff of Arlington County adopted the policy in 1974-1975 (after one of\nhis deputies had been shot by a misdemeanant who had not been strip-searched), that all persons committed to\nhis custody would be strip-searched for concealed weapons and/or contraband-or that the policy had been\nadministered on a non-discriminatory basis since that date. She simply points out that she had been in custody\n[of the arresting officer] unsearched for more than an hour before she was strip-searched [by the matron]-that she\ncame into contact with no one who was not a law enforcement officer-and that she certainly did not expect to be\ndetained-thus she had no reason to attempt to smuggle contraband into the jail. She further points out that the\ncell in which she was held could have been constantly monitored by the correctional officers at the jail if they had\nany reason to believe that she might have any weapons or contraband concealed on her person.\nThe Supreme Court of the United States, in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979),\nin dealing with the question of whether visual body cavity inspections as contemplated by the Metropolitan\nCorrectional Center can ever be conducted on less than probable cause held:\n\"Balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy\ninterests of the inmates, we conclude that they can.\"\nIn reaching that conclusion, Justice Rehnquist said:\n\"Assuming for present purposes that inmates, both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees,\nretain some Fourth Amendment rights upon commitment to a corrections facility, we nonetheless\nconclude that these searches [strip] do not violate that Amendment. The Fourth Amendment\nprohibits only unreasonable searches, and under the circumstances, we do not believe that these\nsearches are unreasonable.\"\nThe plaintiff does not question that the Sheriff's \"strip search\" policy was adopted for the protection of the inmates\nand personnel in the jail or suggest that it was employed with an intent to punish the pretrial detainees housed\ntherein. She simply argues that those committed for Driving While Intoxicated need not be strip-searched, unless\nthe jailer has reason to believe they are carrying concealed weapons.\nShe offered no evidence to support her contention that intoxicated detainees should be treated differently than\nother detainees.\nAs was noted in Bell, supra:\n\n\"A detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers.\n* * * * * *\n\"Smuggling of ... weapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence.\n* * * * * *\n506 *506 \"Ensuring security and order at the institution, is a permissible non-punitive objective whether\nthe facility houses pretrial detainees, convicted inmates or both.\"\nThe burden is on the plaintiff of showing that the Sheriff of Arlington County has exaggerated his response to the\ngenuine security consideration that activated his strip-search practice.\nShe has failed to so prove-her cited cases were concerned with minor traffic offenses, punishable by fine only-her\ncharge was more than a minor traffic offense. DWI is a Class 2 misdemeanor, punishable by confinement for up\nto six months and a fine of $500.00, or both.\nUnreasonable refusal (§ 18.2-268) calls for mandatory suspension of a driver's license for 90 days for the first\noffense, and up to 6 months for the second and subsequent offenses.\nAlthough the detention center in Bell was a short-term federal custodial facility, the Supreme Court's decision\ntherein is binding on all state as well as federal custodial facilities.\nWhether the plaintiff should have been committed to the custody of the Sheriff for four hours, or until some\nresponsible person came to get her-need not be further answered (enough was said by the Court during the trial).\nAfter she was lawfully committed by the Magistrate on duty to the custody of the Sheriff, he was duty-bound to\ntreat her the same as he treated all other detainees. The deputy sheriff [matron] did just that.\nTherefore, her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches has not been abridged. She was\nlawfully strip-searched on the night in question, and\nThe Court so holds.\nHer prayer that the Sheriff of Arlington County be permanently enjoined from strip-searching those committed to\nhis custody on the charge of Driving While Intoxicated unless he has reason to believe they are carrying\nconcealed weapons on their person must be DENIED, and\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nThe Clerk will send a copy of this Memorandum Opinion and Order to all counsel of record.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "Clements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1304 (1981)   \n \n \n  \n102 S.Ct. 284 \nSupreme Court of the United States \nJ. Elwood CLEMENTS and Carol J. Sachtleben \nv. \nLucy N. LOGAN. \nNo. A–480. | Dec. 9, 1981. | Order Vacated Dec. 11, 1981. | See 454 U.S. 1117, 102 S.Ct. 961. \nThe application was filed for stay of mandate of Court of Appeals holding that policy of strip search implemented by county \ndetention center was unconstitutional. Justice Rehnquist, as Circuit Justice, issued temporary stay pending consideration of \nthe application for stay by the full court. \n  \nApplication granted. \n  \nOpinion \n*1304 **285 Justice REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice. \n \nApplicants, a former Sheriff of Arlington County, Va., and a Deputy Sheriff, ask that I stay the mandate of the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit remanding this case to the District Court following the Court of Appeals’ holding that \na policy of strip-searches implemented at the Arlington County Detention Center is unconstitutional. This request was denied \nby THE CHIEF JUSTICE, and a reapplication has been addressed to me. For the reasons that follow, I have referred the \nreapplication to the full Court at its next regularly scheduled Conference and I have temporarily stayed the mandate of the \nCourt of Appeals pending the Court’s disposition of the stay request. \n  \nThe events that prompted this suit began with respondent’s arrest on suspicion of driving while intoxicated following *1305 a \ntwo-car collision. Respondent failed several field tests for intoxication, and she was taken by police cruiser to the Arlington \nCounty Detention Center for administration of a breath-analysis examination. Respondent, an attorney, refused to take the \ntest until allowed to telephone a friend who was also an attorney. She persisted in this demand despite being informed by the \ninvestigating officer and a Magistrate before whom she appeared that she had no right to contact an attorney under Virginia’s \nimplied-consent statute, Va.Code § 18.2–268 (1975 and Supp.1981). The Magistrate issued two warrants against respondent, \none for driving while intoxicated and the other for refusing to submit to a breath-analysis test.1 The Magistrate authorized \nrespondent’s release on her own recognizance on the condition that a responsible person come to the Detention Center to \nassume custody. The Magistrate’s office did not **286 have a phone available for respondent’s use, but she was informed \nthat she could make a call upon commitment to jail. The arresting officer then transferred custody of respondent to applicant \nCarol Sachtleben, a Deputy Sheriff. \n  \nPrior to respondent’s arrest, applicant Clements, at that time the Sheriff, had instituted a policy requiring deputies to conduct \nvisual strip-searches of all persons held at the Center in order to discover whether weapons or contraband were being \nconcealed. This policy was adopted after the shooting of a deputy by a misdemeanant who had not been strip-searched. \nPursuant to this policy, applicant Sachtleben first inventoried respondent’s personal property and then took her *1306 to a \nholding cell where she conducted a visual strip-search.2 Respondent was then allowed to call her friend, and eventually was \nreleased into her friend’s custody. \n  \nRespondent subsequently brought suit for damages and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging an assortment of \nconstitutional violations. She complained of (1) denial of the assistance of counsel; (2) unjustified detention following \nestablishment of the conditions of release; and (3) the Sheriff’s policy of administering strip-searches of all persons held at \nthe Detention Center without reasonable cause to suspect concealment of weapons or contraband. The complaint named as \ndefendants the arresting officer, a correctional officer at the Detention Center, several Deputy Sheriffs (including applicant \nSachtleben), three Magistrates, the Commonwealth Attorney for Arlington County, applicant Clements, the current Sheriff \nGondles, and Arlington County. Several claims were dismissed prior to trial, directed verdicts were entered as to others in \nfavor of the defendants, and after post-trial briefing, the District Court entered judgment for defendants on those claims that \nremained. Logan v. Shealy, 500 F.Supp. 502 (EDVa.1980). In particular, the court held that the policy of conducting \n  1 \n \n\nClements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1304 (1981)   \n \nstrip-searches did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Id., at 506. \n  \nThe Court of Appeals for the most part affirmed, but it reversed on the issue of strip-searches. Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d \n1007 (C.A.4 1981). The court purported to rely on the standard for judging the reasonableness of searches expressed in Bell \nv. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1885, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), which requires consideration of “the scope of the \nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is \nconducted.” The court concluded: \n*1307 “On the undisputed and stipulated evidence, Logan’s strip search bore no such discernible relationship to security \nneeds at the Detention Center that, when balanced against the ultimate invasion of personal rights involved, it could \nreasonably be thought justified. At no time would Logan or similar detainees be intermingled with the general jail \npopulation; her offense, though not a minor traffic offense, was nevertheless one not commonly associated by its very \nnature with the possession of weapons or contraband; there was no cause in her specific case to believe that she might \npossess either; and when strip-searched, she had been at the Detention Center for one and one-half hours without even a \npat-down search. An indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied to detainees such as Logan along with all other \ndetainees  cannot  be  constitutionally  justified  simply  on  the  basis  of  administrative  ease  in  attending  to  security \nconsiderations.” 660 F.2d, at 1013. \n  \n**287 The court remanded with directions to enter a permanent injunction against enforcement of the policy.3 The court also \nreversed directed verdicts in favor of applicants and remanded with instructions that judgment be entered against them “for \nall damages determined by a jury to have been *1308 proximately caused by the strip search, unless those defendants can \nestablish before a jury their respective defenses of good faith immunity (or any others available to them) in accordance with \n[the court’s] opinion.” Id., at 1014. Applicants unsuccessfully sought a stay from the Court of Appeals. A similar request was \ndenied by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, and the present reapplication was delivered to me on December 8, 1981. Without a stay, \ntrial of the damages claims against applicants will commence on December 9. \n  \n[1] [2] Applicants for a stay bear a heavy burden of demonstrating the need for exercise of the equitable power conferred on a \nCircuit Justice by 28 U.S.C. § 2101(f). That burden is heavier still if the request for a stay has previously been denied by a \nMember of this Court. See, e. g., New York Times Co. v. Jascalevich, 439 U.S. 1331, 1337, 99 S.Ct. 11, 15, 58 L.Ed.2d 38 \n(1978) (MARSHALL, J., in chambers); Republican State Central Committee v. The Ripon Society, 409 U.S. 1222, 1227, 93 \nS.Ct. 1475, 1478, 34 L.Ed.2d 717 (1972) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers). While THE CHIEF JUSTICE is not entitled to a \npresumption that by virtue of his office he knows more law than the other Members of the Court, it is presumed that he \nknows at least as much, and his denial of relief “counsels circumspection.” Republican State Central Committee, supra, at \n1227, 93 S.Ct., at 1478. \n  \nAfter consideration of the reapplication and the response, I have concluded that the issues involved warrant consideration by \nthe full Court. This opportunity will arise at the next regularly scheduled Conference on Friday, December 11. Nevertheless, \nthat date is several days in the distance and, more importantly, the proceedings that applicants seek to stay will commence in \nthe interim in the absence of a stay. As a result, I think it is incumbent on me to exercise my authority as Circuit Justice to \ndetermine how the matter shall remain until it can be considered by the full Court. See Evans v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 429 \nU.S. 1334, 1335, 97 S.Ct. 544, 545, 50 L.Ed.2d 441 (1976) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers). \n  \n*1309 [3] In my view, the decision of the Court of Appeals is so at odds with this Court’s resolution of a similar issue in Bell \nv. Wolfish, supra, that its mandate ought to be stayed temporarily pending consideration by the full Court. Bell v. Wolfish was \na class action initiated by inmates of a federally operated short-term detention facility challenging the constitutionality of \nnumerous conditions of confinement and related administrative practices. The facility was primarily used to house persons \ncharged with a crime but not yet brought to trial. One of the challenged practices was the requirement that inmates submit to \na strip-search and visual inspection of their body cavities after every contact visit with someone from outside the institution. \nThis **288 Court ultimately held that under the circumstances, such searches were not unreasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment. 441 U.S., at 558–560, 99 S.Ct., at 1884–1885. Rather, they were “reasonable responses ... to legitimate security \nconcerns,” id., at 561, 99 S.Ct., at 1885, and could be conducted in the absence of probable cause, id., at 560, 99 S.Ct., at \n1884. \n  \nThe Court of Appeals recited from Bell v. Wolfish the general standard by which searches are judged under the Fourth \nAmendment, but it chose to ignore the Court’s application of that standard to the practice of conducting strip-searches of \npersons detained after being charged with a crime. Respondent in this case was arrested and charged by a Magistrate with \ndriving while intoxicated and unlawful refusal to submit to a breath-analysis examination.4 The Magistrate authorized her \nrelease from the Detention Center only when a responsible individual arrived to take custody. Until that time, respondent \n  2 \n \n\nClements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1304 (1981)   \n \nremained officially under arrest and subject to those measures adopted for the maintenance of internal security at the jail. Her \nposition was no different, for constitutional purposes, from the pretrial detainees in Bell v. Wolfish. If anything, the detainees \nin that case were subject to *1310 more onerous conditions, given the greater intrusiveness of a body-cavity search. The \nCourt nevertheless upheld such searches “in the light of the central objective of prison administration, safeguarding \ninstitutional security.” Id., at 547, 99 S.Ct., at 1878. \n  \nThe Court of Appeals gave little or no weight to that objective. The clear import of its decision is that strip-searches may not \nbe conducted without probable cause to believe that the subject of the search possesses weapons or contraband. No such \nrequirement attended the search policy upheld in Bell v. Wolfish, and indeed the Court expressly held that strip-searches need \nnot be conditioned on probable cause. Id., at 560, 99 S.Ct., at 1884. Nor was the result in Bell v. Wolfish predicated on a \nshowing that searches were limited to those persons whose alleged offenses were “commonly associated by [their] very \nnature with the possession of weapons or contraband.” 660 F.2d, at 1013. In short, the Court of Appeals decision reads as if \nBell v. Wolfish had never been decided. Much as that may have been the desire of the lower court, the decision is \nauthoritative precedent and I believe it clearly dictates a contrary result in this case. \n  \nIn view of the Court of Appeals’ attempt to distinguish a decision of this Court which to me seems clearly applicable to the \ncase before it, I believe there is substantial likelihood that the full Court will grant a stay pending disposition of the petition \nfor certiorari. A delay in the proceedings until the Court has an opportunity to consider the application will not prejudice \nrespondent, and it will forestall the expense and effort of a trial until the legal basis for further proceedings is clarified. \nAccordingly, the mandate of the Court of Appeals is hereby stayed temporarily, pending consideration of the application for a \nstay by the full Court at the next regularly scheduled Conference. \n  \nParallel Citations \n102 S.Ct. 284, 70 L.Ed.2d 461 \nFootnotes \n \n1  Under Virginia law, driving while intoxicated is a Class 2 misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for up to six months and a \n  fine of $500. Va.Code §§ 18.2–270, 18.2–11 (1975). Unreasonable refusal to submit to a breath-analysis test is punishable as a first \noffense by mandatory suspension of the driver’s license for 90 days. Repeat offenses are punishable by imprisonment for six \nmonths. § 18.2–268(n). \n \n2  Respondent was asked to remove her clothing, one garment at a time, to hand them to the deputy, and to turn around for visual \n  inspection. Respondent complied and her clothes were immediately returned to her. \n \n3  The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to order the issuance of a permanent injunction is, I think, open to serious question. \n  Although respondent has suffered an injury sufficient to establish her standing to seek damages, “[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct \ndoes not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief ... if unaccompanied by any continuing, present \nadverse effects.” O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495–496, 94 S.Ct. 669, 675–676, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). As O’Shea makes \nclear, standing to seek injunctive relief depends on a showing of “a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.” Id., at 496, 94 \nS.Ct., at 676. Respondent has not alleged that she anticipates being arrested again and again subjected to a strip-search at the \nArlington County Detention Center. Even if she had made such an allegation, it would “tak[e] us into the area of speculation and \nconjecture.” Id., at 497, 94 S.Ct., at 676. See Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 371–373, 96 S.Ct. 598, 604–605, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 \n(1976). \n \n4  See n. 1, supra. \n   \n \n \n \n  3 \n ",

We affirm the dismissal of all her claims except those related to the strip search\nof her person. As to those, we reverse and remand for further proceedings against certain of the defendants.\nI\nAt approximately 7:30 p. m. on March 6, 1979, Logan, an attorney, was involved in a two-car collision in Arlington\nCounty, Virginia. The investigating officer, Thomas Shortt, suspected Logan had been driving while intoxicated.\nAfter giving Logan field alcoholic tests which she failed, Officer Shortt placed Logan under arrest and told her that\nhe was taking her to the police station for a breathalyzer test. Logan asked to call her friend, Lorelei Haig, also an\nattorney, because the two had been together shortly before the accident and Haig knew how much alcohol Logan\nhad consumed. Officer Shortt refused to permit the call and had Logan transported to the Arlington County\nDetention Center in a police cruiser. Logan arrived at the Detention Center at approximately 8:20 p. m.; Officer\nShortt arrived shortly thereafter. Logan's car was impounded.\nThe exact sequence of events following Logan's arrival at the Detention Center is in some dispute on the\n[1]\ntestimony adduced at trial. Logan testified that she was taken before a magistrate,  who issued an arrest\n\n1010 warrant for driving while intoxicated (D.W.I.), Va.Code § 18.2-266 (Cum.Supp.1981); *1010 that Officer Shortt\nthen took her for a breathalyzer test; that she requested permission first to make a telephone call to Lorelei Haig\nwhich Officer Shortt refused to permit; and that Officer Shortt then took her back to the magistrate, who issued a\nsecond warrant for her refusal to take the test in violation of Virginia's implied consent law, Va.Code § 18.2-268\n(Cum.Supp.1981). Officer Shortt's version is somewhat different. He testified that Logan first was taken to the\nbreathalyzer unit, where she refused to take the test before calling Haig; that he refused Logan permission to\nmake the call because he understood that she had no legal right to contact an attorney at that time; that when\nLogan still refused to take the test, he took her before Magistrate Vance, who persuaded Logan to take the test;\nthat he, Officer Shortt, then took Logan back to the breathalyzer unit, where she again refused to be tested\nbefore calling Haig; and that he immediately returned her to the magistrate who issued the arrest warrant for\nD.W.I. and the second warrant for Logan's refusal.\nIn any event, after both warrants had been issued, Logan was booked and again went before the magistrate for a\nbond hearing. Logan testified that Magistrate Vance released her on her own recognizance, but then told Logan\nthat according to a policy she would be unable to leave the Detention Center for four hours or until a responsible\nperson came for her. Magistrate Vance denied that there was a firm policy to hold all D.W.I. arrestees for four\nhours to assure their sobriety. In this case, however, he directed that Logan was to be held for that length of time\nor until a responsible person took custody of her and she was then to be released upon personal recognizance.\nMagistrate Vance also did not permit Logan to call Haig because the magistrates' office did not have a phone\navailable for arrestees' use and he understood that the sheriff would permit the call; Vance therefore informed\nLogan that she could make a telephone call upon commitment to jail. Officer Shortt then turned Logan over to the\nsheriff's custody at approximately 9:50 p. m. and left.\n[2]\nLogan immediately asked Deputy Sheriff Carol Sachtleben  for permission to call Lorelei Haig. In accordance\nwith then Sheriff Clements' policy, however, Deputy Sachtleben first inventoried Logan's personal property and\nthen took her to a holding cell and conducted a visual strip search. Sheriff Clements had established this policy 00\n97\nto strip search all persons held at the Detention Center for weapons or contraband regardless of their offense 00\n97\nin 1974-75 after a deputy allegedly was shot by a misdemeanant who had not been strip-searched. Logan\ntestified that the window blinds in the holding cell were either open or broken and permitted anyone in the\nbooking area to observe her strip search. Deputy Sachtleben testified that the blinds were closed and no one\ncould see into or out of the holding cell during the search. Once the strip search was completed, Deputy\nSachtleben brought a telephone to the holding cell and Logan called Lorelei Haig. At 10:55 p. m., Logan was\nreleased to Haig.\nLogan subsequently brought this action for damages and for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. §\n[3]\n1983, alleging the deprivation of various civil rights.  Her § 1983 claims were basically three.\nThe first claim related to the denial of Logan's request to make a telephone call. The actions of Magistrates\nJohnson and Vance, Police Officer Shortt, Deputy Sheriffs Sachtleben and Turner, and Correctional Officer Nava\nin refusing her permission to call her attorney, Lorelei Haig, until after the strip search was completed even\n1011 though the two arrest warrants had issued earlier[4] were claimed to have violated her *1011 sixth amendment\nright to the assistance of counsel.\nThe second claim related to Logan's detention. She alleged that either Magistrate Johnson or Vance or both\nordered her to be committed to the Arlington County Detention Center for approximately four hours, after\nreleasing her on her personal recognizance, pursuant to a policy of Arlington County to detain all D.W.I. arrestees\nfor that length of time regardless of their individual circumstances. According to Logan's allegations, this policy\nwas promulgated by Chief Magistrate Norris Shealy and William Burroughs, who was the Commonwealth\nAttorney for Arlington County in March 1979 when Logan was arrested, while the three magistrates 00 Shealy,\n97\nJohnson, and Vance 00 continued to enforce it upon the advice of the present Commonwealth Attorney, Henry\n97\nHudson. Application of this detention policy was claimed to violate her fourth amendment right to be free from\nunreasonable seizure, her eighth amendment rights to be free from excessive bail and from cruel and unusual\npunishment, and her fourteenth amendment right not to be deprived of her liberty without due process of law.\nHudson was sued in his official capacity only; the other defendants were sued in their individual and official\ncapacities.\n\nLogan's third claim concerned the strip search. It was brought against Officer Shortt, Deputy Turner, and\nCorrectional Officer Nava, who escorted her to Deputy Sachtleben; against Sachtleben who allegedly conducted\nthe search in an area exposed to public view; against then Sheriff Clements who promulgated the policy; against\nMagistrate Shealy and then Commonwealth Attorney Burroughs who advised adoption of the policy; against\npresent Sheriff Gondles who continued to enforce the policy; and against Arlington County whose policy it was\nalleged to be. The policy as enforced was alleged to be unreasonable in scope and manner, being conducted\nwithout a warrant or probable cause, hence to violate unspecified fourth and fourteenth amendment rights, and to\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment. Gondles was sued in his official\ncapacity only; the other defendants were sued in their individual and official capacities. This claim as well as the\nsecond was asserted against Arlington County on the basis of Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 100\nS.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980), and Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56\nL.Ed.2d 611 (1978).\nIn addition to seeking compensatory and punitive damages from defendants Shealy, Johnson, Vance, Burroughs,\nClements, Shortt, Turner, Nava, Sachtleben, and Arlington County, Logan prayed for a declaration that the\ntelephone call, detention, and strip search policies were unconstitutional and for a permanent injunction\nrestraining Shealy, Johnson, Vance, Hudson, Gondles, and Arlington County from enforcing those policies.\nBefore trial, on Logan's motion, the district court dismissed the claims for monetary relief against the present\nCommonwealth Attorney, Hudson, and the present Sheriff, Gondles, and all claims against Deputy Turner and\nCorrectional Officer Nava. The remaining defendants moved for summary judgment, and the court granted partial\nsummary judgment to the three magistrates on the claims for monetary relief because of their judicial immunity,\nand summary judgment on all claims to ex-Commonwealth Attorney Burroughs. The other defendants' motions\nwere denied. At this point there remained for disposition the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief alleged in\nrespect of the telephone call, detention, and strip search policies variously against Magistrates Shealy, Johnson,\nand Vance, Commonwealth Attorney Hudson, Sheriff Gondles, and Arlington County and the claims for damages\nalleged against Officer Shortt on the denial of counsel claim, Arlington County on the four-hour detention claim,\nand Arlington County, Sheriff Clements, Deputy Sachtleben, and Officer Shortt on the strip search claim.\nThe case proceeded to trial before a jury on all the claims for monetary relief. At the close of the plaintiff's\n1012 evidence, the *1012 district court directed a verdict for Arlington County on the detention claim on the basis of a\nfailure to prove the existence of any policy under which magistrates were directed to hold all persons arrested for\nD.W.I. for four hours and on the basis that Logan's detention until Haig's arrival was, under the circumstances,\n[5]\nreasonable.  At the close of all the evidence, the district court directed verdicts for all the individual defendants.\nThe district court held that on the evidence presented, Officer Shortt's defense of good faith immunity to the\ndenial of counsel claim was established. Assuming Logan had a constitutional right to make the telephone call,\nOfficer Shortt had simply followed standard procedures, binding upon him, in denying it before she was\nprocessed.\nSimilarly it found that Deputy Sachtleben's good faith defense was established. She had relied in good faith on\nthe Sheriff's policy in conducting the strip search and had performed the search in accordance with that policy.\nEven if the blinds were open, there was no evidence that anyone had in fact looked into the holding cell during\nthe search.\nFinally, even though Sheriff Clements had stipulated that he had instituted the across-the-board strip search\npolicy, the court also directed a verdict for Clements on the stated, unelaborated basis that while he had instituted\n[6]\nthe policy, he was not liable for enforcing it.  Notwithstanding this disposition of the strip search damage claim\nagainst Sheriff Clements, the court nevertheless expressed concern whether the policy might require modification\nto pass constitutional muster, and instructed the parties to present additional authority on the constitutional issue\nin connection with Logan's remaining claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.\nAfter posttrial briefing and argument, the district court denied Logan's request for declaratory and injunctive relief\nas to both the telephone call, detention, and strip search policies. Logan v. Shealy, 500 F.Supp. 502\n(E.D.Va.1980). The court ruled that Logan's sixth amendment right to counsel was not abridged. She was allowed\n\nto call her attorney shortly after being formally charged and the right does not accrue immediately upon arrest. Id.\nat 505 (citing United States v. DuVall, 537 F.2d 15 (2d Cir. 1976)). The district court held that the strip search\npolicy was constitutional under Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), reasoning\nthat Logan had not shown that intoxicated detainees should be treated differently in this respect than other\ndetainees, and that she had failed to carry the burden of showing that Sheriff Clements' policy was an\nexaggerated response to genuine security considerations. Id. at 505-06.\nThis appeal followed. Logan challenges the district court's action in granting directed verdicts and summary\njudgments on the various monetary claims, in denying all declaratory and injunctive relief, and in excluding or\nlimiting some evidence.\nII\nWe find no reversible error in any of the district court's rulings except those related to the claims growing out of\n1013 the strip search. Specifically we affirm, on the *1013 basis of the district court's reasoning, its rulings that the\nevidence failed to show any violation of constitutional right in connection with Logan's detention pending arrival of\nHaig, or in connection with the refusal of permission to make telephone calls; that the magistrates were, in any\nevent, entitled to judicial immunity in respect of all monetary claims; that Officer Shortt was, in any event, entitled\nto a good faith immunity defense to the claim for monetary relief for denial of counsel; and that the evidence\nagainst Officer Shortt on the strip search was insufficient for submission to the jury.\nIII\nWith respect to the strip search claims, we find error requiring reversal and remand for further proceedings.\nSpecifically we hold that on the evidence stipulated and adduced at trial the strip search policy promulgated by\nSheriff Clements and enforced by his department was conclusively shown to be unconstitutional under the\nstandards laid out in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447.\nStrip searches of detainees are constitutionally constrained by due process requirements of reasonableness\nunder the circumstances.\nIn each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\npersonal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion,\nthe manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. On the undisputed and stipulated evidence, Logan's strip search bore no such\ndiscernible relationship to security needs at the Detention Center that, when balanced against the ultimate\ninvasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably be thought justified. At no time would Logan or similar\ndetainees be intermingled with the general jail population; her offense, though not a minor traffic offense, was\nnevertheless one not commonly associated by its very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband;\nthere was no cause in her specific case to believe that she might possess either; and when strip-searched, she\nhad been at the Detention Center for one and one-half hours without even a pat-down search. An indiscriminate\nstrip search policy routinely applied to detainees such as Logan along with all other detainees cannot be\nconstitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations. See \nTinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 490-91 (E.D.Wis.1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir. 1980).\nThe district court's contrary conclusion, reflected in its posttrial denial of all declaratory and injunctive relief, was\nin error. This necessitates reversal and remand for entry of an appropriate decree declaring unconstitutional the\npolicy as it was stipulated to exist at the time of Logan's strip search, and granting a permanent injunction against\nits future enforcement in that form by those responsible.\nIn this connection, we take notice from the record in another case, DeMier v. Arlington County, Civ. Action No.\n80-1086-A, slip op. at 2 (E.D.Va., May 12, 1981) (unpublished) that in December 1980, Sheriff Gondles revised\nthe strip search policy on a trial basis, making searches mandatory only when probable cause exists to believe a\n\nparticular detainee is concealing contraband. Notwithstanding that this revised policy or some other may be the\ncurrently existing one, Logan's claim and right to declaratory and injunctive relief are not thereby mooted. United\nStates v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953); United States v. Hunter,\n459 F.2d 205, 219 (4th Cir. 1972); Lankford v. Gelston, 364 F.2d 197, 202-03 (4th Cir. 1966); Tinetti v. Wittke, 479\nF.Supp. at 488-90.\nIV\nReversal and remand is also required in respect of the directed verdicts in favor of the defendants Arlington\nCounty, Sheriff Clements, and Deputy Sachtleben given during the jury trial of Logan's damages claims. Whether\n1014 the verdicts were directed in favor of the individual defendants, Clements and Sachtleben, on the basis that the \n*1014 strip search policy as applied to Logan was constitutional, or on the basis that as to each the defense of\n[7]\ngood faith immunity had been established,  the district court was in error. As we have indicated, the undisputed\nevidence established as a matter of law that the policy as applied was unconstitutional. That leaves only the good\nfaith defense as a possibly valid basis, and neither would it suffice as a basis for a directed verdict.\nIn this type § 1983 action, the good faith immunity of individual police officers is an affirmative defense to be\nproved by the defendant, Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980),\nunder the test of police officer immunity to monetary liability expressed, for example, in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S.\n547, 555-57, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1218-19, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967). Therefore verdicts properly could have been\ndirected for these two defendants on that basis only if the evidence established as a matter of law that each\nacted, the one in promulgating and maintaining, the other in carrying out, a policy that each, at the critical time,\n\"reasonably believed [was] valid, [though it] was later held unconstitutional, on its face or as applied.\" Pierson,\n386 U.S. at 555, 87 S.Ct. at 1218. We hold that the evidence did not conclusively establish this defense as to\neither Clements or Sachtleben, but that on the evidence adduced the issue of the good faith of each, in the\nspecial § 1983 sense, was one of fact for the jury under appropriate instructions as to the burden of proof and the\nsubstantive elements of the defense.\nThe issue as to Sheriff Clements is whether, given the knowledge of existing law with which he could fairly be\ncharged as chief law enforcement officer of the County, he could reasonably have believed his policy then to be\nconstitutionally valid. The issue as to Deputy Sachtleben is somewhat different. Had the evidence indisputably\nshowed that she simply applied Sheriff Clements' policy as promulgated, we agree that her justifiable assumption\nof its presumptive validity would have established her good faith immunity defense. See, e. g., Wallace v. King,\n626 F.2d 1157, 1161 (4th Cir. 1980). But the evidence was in dispute on this very issue. One of the critical, and\ncertainly most obvious, elements in the Bell v. Wolfish balancing inquiry into the reasonableness of a strip search\nis \"the place in which it is conducted.\" 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. It is apparently undisputed that the\npolicy as promulgated by Sheriff Clements contemplated that strip searches would be conducted in areas\neffectively screened from general view. While an enforcing officer might reasonably believe a policy with such a\nprivacy aspect valid simply because it was promulgated by a superior, the reasonableness of her belief in its\nvalidity if it was applied in violation of that privacy aspect would present quite a different issue. We think that, as a\nmatter of law, no police officer in this day and time could reasonably believe that conducting a strip search in an\narea exposed to the general view of persons known to be in the vicinity 00 whether or not any actually viewed the\n97\nsearch 00 is a constitutionally valid governmental \"invasion of [the] personal rights that [such a] search entails.\" Id.\n97\nWhether the room in which Logan was searched was so exposed to general view was, on the evidence adduced,\nin direct dispute.\nUpon remand, Logan is entitled to a judgment against defendants Clements and Sachtleben for all damages\ndetermined by a jury to have been proximately caused by the strip search, unless those defendants can establish\nbefore a jury their respective defenses of good faith immunity (or any others available to them) in accordance\nwith this opinion. In discussing these concededly difficult factual issues of \"good faith\" and holding them not\nsubject to resolution by directed verdict on the evidence adduced, we, of course, express no opinion on their\nmerits, either on the evidence as presented on the earlier trial or as it may be presented upon remand.\n\n1015 As earlier indicated, Logan's strip search claim for damages against Arlington *1015 County has not been\nformally disposed of by any order of the district court of which we are aware, and on appeal the parties have\ndisagreed as to whether it may have been formally abandoned in pretrial proceedings. Upon remand, this\nquestion must be addressed by the district court. First, it should rule whether, as a procedural matter, the claim\nhas been abandoned or otherwise procedurally defaulted by Logan. If it is determined that the claim has not been\nso lost, then the court must address the question whether the strip search policy as promulgated and maintained\nby Sheriff Clements at the critical time was directly chargeable under Virginia law to Arlington County as its own\npolicy. See Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. at 690-95, 98 S.Ct. at 2035-38. If it is found so\nchargeable, then Logan is entitled to a judgment against Arlington County for all damages proximately caused by\nthe strip search as determined by a jury, the County being entitled to no immunity defense. Owen v. City of\nIndependence, 445 U.S. at 638, 100 S.Ct. at 1409.\nV\nIn view of our disposition, it is unnecessary to consider Logan's challenge to certain evidentiary rulings of the\ndistrict court.\nWe find no merit in Arlington County's contention that all claims against it are barred by the one-year statute of\nlimitations in Va. Code § 8.01-248 (1977). The applicable statute is Va. Code § 8.01-243 A (1977) under whose\ntwo-year period the claims are not barred. Johnson v. Davis, 582 F.2d 1316, 1318-19 (4th Cir. 1978).\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part for further proceedings in\nconformity with this opinion.\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\n[1] Logan could not remember the magistrate before whom she appeared. Chief Magistrate Shealy was not\npresent on March 6, 1979, and Magistrate Johnson, who knew Logan, asked Magistrate Vance to process her.\n[2] According to her amended complaint, Logan was turned over to Deputy Sheriff Robert Turner and Correctional\nOfficer Henri Nava, who escorted her to Deputy Sheriff Carol Sachtleben.\n[3] Logan also asserted various pendent state claims which were later dismissed.\n[4] In her brief on appeal, Logan also asserts this claim against Arlington County. We decline to address the\ncontention because Arlington County was not included as a defendant with respect to this claim in Logan's\namended complaint, no evidence was presented at trial, and we find the claim to be without merit.\n[5] Though the strip search claim for damages against Arlington County had not been formally dismissed before\ntrial, it was not addressed by the court at trial. On appeal the County has contended that the claim was formally\nabandoned by Logan in pre-trial conference, a contention not conceded by Logan. We cannot resolve that on the\nrecord before us, and the question will have to be addressed by the trial court on the remand we direct.\n[6] The exact basis for the court's directed verdict in favor of Sheriff Clements is not clear from the record.\nTheoretically it could have been on either of two grounds: that the strip search policy was, as a matter of law, not\nshown to be unconstitutional, or that, assuming its unconstitutionality, the evidence conclusively established\nClements' good faith in promulgating it, hence his immunity to the monetary claim. While the good faith defense\nis not directly adverted to, the district court's subsequent consideration of the claim for declaratory and injunctive\nrelief in respect of the strip search policy strongly suggests that good faith rather than constitutionality was the\nbasis for the directed verdict ruling at the time it was made. In view of our disposition, the exact basis is\nimmaterial.\n[7]See note 6 supra.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
