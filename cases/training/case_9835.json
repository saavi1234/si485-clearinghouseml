    "summary": "<p>Three women who had been subjected to strip and cavity searches in accordance with a blanket policy to strip search all female arrestees regardless of the charges or the likelihood that they are concealing contraband were part of a class action to challenge the constitutionality of the policy, filed on March 1, 1979. Jane Does v. City of Chicago, No. 79 C 789 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 12, 1982) That case resulted in a settlement in which the City of Chicago was permanently enjoined from instituting strip searches or body cavity searches on women and not on similarly situated men, and from performing strip searches of any person charged with a traffic, regulatory, or misdemeanor offense unless police reasonably believed that the arrestee was concealing weapons or contraband.</p><p>The three women were selected by the parties as typical cases to separate out for trial on the issue of damages. Jury trials were held and the women were awarded damages in the amounts of $25,000 and $60,000. Two of these cases, <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9859\">Tikalski v. City of Chicago</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9970\">Hoffman v. City of Chicago</a> are also in the Clearinghouse.</p><p>In one case, after a plaintiff prevailed, the district court granted the City a new trial on the grounds that one of the jury instructions was improper. The plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which reversed the district court and reinstated the plaintiff's victory on August 2, 1982. 687 F.2d 175.</p><p>The City later appealed all their losses, but on November 29, 1983, the Seventh Circuit upheld the awards and the finding that the policy was unconstitutional. 723 F.2d 1263.</p><p>This case is now closed.</p>",

      "text": "687 F.2d 175 (1982)\nMary Ann TIKALSKY, Plaintiff-Appellant,\nv.\nCITY OF CHICAGO, et al., Defendants-Appellees.\nNo. 81-2822.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit.\nArgued April 16, 1982.\n[*]\nDecided August 2, 1982.\n176 *176 Mary Rita Luecke, Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff-appellant.\nJerome A. Siegan, Corp. Counsel, Chicago, Ill., for defendants-appellees.\n[**]\nBefore CUMMINGS, Chief Judge, GIBSON,  Senior Circuit Judge, and CUDAHY, Circuit Judge.\n177 *177 CUMMINGS, Chief Judge.\nOn the morning of February 15, 1978, Mary Ann Tikalsky rushed, coatless, out of the Greater Grand Boulevard\nMental Health Center, where she was employed as a city social worker, and began berating two Chicago\npolicemen who were ticketing her car. Miss Tikalsky's wrath had been stirred by two circumstances: on the\nsnowbound streets around her office parking of any kind 00 legal or illegal 00 was hard to find; and she thought the\n97 97\npolice department was exhibiting more zeal writing parking tickets than it had shown the week before\ninvestigating a robbery in which she had been the victim. Miss Tikalsky's outburst cost her dearly.\nShe was arrested for disorderly conduct and taken to the Second District Police Station at 51st Street and\nWentworth Avenue. There a female detention aide subjected her to a visual strip search. First Miss Tikalsky had\nto bare her body from the waist up; then she had to lower her slacks and underwear, squat and bend from the\nwaist several times, and alternately face toward and away from the matron. After the search Miss Tikalsky was\nkept in the women's detention center. Although she had money with her, she did not know that she could post\nbond. She remained in the detention area for four hours, until a friend arrived and paid the $35 bond. On March\n3, 1978, Miss Tikalsky was tried and acquitted on the disorderly conduct charge.\nThese events generated a Section 1983 suit. Count I of the complaint as amended charged the arresting officers\nwith false arrest and malicious prosecution; Count II charged one of the arresting officers with the use of\nexcessive force and the other with failure to intervene; Count III charged the City of Chicago, the police chief, his\nsubordinates, the watch commanders at the Wentworth Avenue station, the arresting officers, and the matron\nwith equal protection, privacy, and Fourth Amendment violations based on the strip search. After a ten-day trial in\nDecember 1980, the jury awarded Miss Tikalsky damages of $30,000 against the City of Chicago and Second\nDistrict Watch Commander Norman Schmiedeknecht. The verdict was not broken down by counts and\ndefendants, but the parties agree that it must have been based on the strip-search count. There is no telling\nwhich constitutional right the jury thought the strip search infringed.\nThe City and Norman Schmiedeknecht presented the following post-trial motion on January 8, 1982 (Tikalsky\nApp. 9-10):\n1. Defendants seek a judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Rule 50 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure for the following reasons:\n(a) As a matter of law the searching policy utilized in lockup facilities was constitutional. Bell v.\nWolfish, [441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447] * * *.\n\n(b) When all the evidence is viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, it still overwhelmingly\nfavors these defendants and no other verdict than one in defendants' favor can stand.\n2. In the alternative, defendants seek a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure for the following reasons:\n(a) The issue of the constitutionality of the searching policy utilized in the lockup facilities is a\nquestion of law and should not have been submitted to the jury.\n3. In the alternative, the judgment against Norman Schmiedeknecht is illogical and erroneous with\nrespect to the verdicts against the remaining individuals and a judgment notwithstanding the\nverdict should be entered.\nIn her January 26, 1981, memorandum in opposition to the defendants' motion, Miss Tikalsky met head-on the\ncontention that Bell v. Wolfish put the City's strip-search policy beyond challenge. One of the cases she relied on\nwas People v. Seymour, 80 Ill.App.3d 221, 35 Ill.Dec. 241, 398 N.E.2d 1191 (1st Dist. 1979) (henceforth Seymour\nI). However, in the two-week interval between the filing of her memorandum and the filing of the defendants'\n178 reply, the Illinois *178 Supreme Court reversed that case, 84 Ill.2d 24, 48 Ill.Dec. 548, 416 N.E.2d 1070 (February\n3, 1981) (henceforth Seymour II). The defendants' reply memorandum placed great emphasis on the Illinois\nSupreme Court decision.\nOn February 20, 1981, Judge Perry granted the City's motion for a new trial and entered a judgment n.o.v. in\n[1]\nfavor of Norman Schmiedeknecht.  The correctness of the judgment n.o.v. is not an issue in this appeal. In\njustification of his new-trial ruling, the district judge wrote:\nThe court * * * finds * * * that a new trial for defendant City of Chicago should be granted on the\nbasis that the jury was incorrectly informed by the court as to what the law was, and this fact might\nvery well have contributed to the jury's finding against the City of Chicago. * * The court gave to\nthe jury certain instructions that might have confused the jurors, 00 particularly plaintiff's Instruction\n97\nNumber 41, which the court gave on the authority of People v. Seymour, 80 Ill.App.3d 221 [35\nIll.Dec. 241, 398 N.E.2d 1191] (1st Dist. 1979), which has since been reversed (on February 3,\n1981) by a unanimous Illinois Supreme Court save for Justice Simon, who did not participate in\nthe consideration or decision of the case for the reason that he wrote, while on the lower court, the\n[2]\nopinion that was reversed.\n[3]\nMiss Tikalsky has appealed the district court's grant of a new trial on both substantive and procedural grounds.\nShe maintains that the district court abused its discretion in ordering a new trial based on error that was at most\n[4]\nharmless.  She also contends that the district judge erred in granting the motion for reasons that were not\n[5]\napparent on its face, without affording her notice and a hearing before he did so.  Because we agree with the\nfirst contention, we need not reach the second. We reverse the grant of a new trial and remand to the district\ncourt with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict.\nI\nWe begin with an examination of the Seymour cases, because they were central to the district judge's decision.\n179 Seymour was arrested for unlawful use of a weapon, *179 a bondable misdemeanor in Illinois. He was indicted,\nhowever, for possession of cocaine. The issue was whether the cocaine had to be suppressed because it had\nbeen discovered during an improper strip search. The trial court granted Seymour's motion to suppress; the\nappellate court affirmed; and the Supreme Court reversed.\nThe appellate court reasoned that misdemeanor arrestees, like Seymour, must be informed orally of their right to\npost bond. 80 Ill.App.3d at 228, 35 Ill.Dec. 241, 398 N.E.2d 1191. If Seymour could post bond, there was no need\nto put him into a lockup. He could be detained in less restrictive quarters while the police completed their\ninvestigation. Id. at 229, 35 Ill.Dec. 241, 398 N.E.2d 1191. Since the search was the result of police failure to tell\n\nSeymour that he could post bond, the cocaine it revealed was properly suppressed. Id. An independent basis for\n[6]\ninvalidating the search was that it was unreasonable under Article I, Section 6 of the Illinois Constitution:  \"when\nthe defendant is charged only with a misdemeanor and may gain his release immediately, his modesty and\nprivacy must be made inviolate.\" Id. at 230, 35 Ill.Dec. 241, 398 N.E.2d 1191.\nThe Illinois Supreme Court rejected Seymour I's per se rule. There is no statutory requirement that misdemeanor\narrestees be informed orally that they may post bond 00 written notification is enough. 84 Ill.2d at 31, 48 Ill.Dec.\n97\n548, 416 N.E.2d 1070. On the facts of the case, Seymour could properly be detained for a considerable time\nwhile the police investigated his previous felony conviction, an event which might upgrade the weapons offense\nfor which he was arrested from a misdemeanor to a Class 3 felony. Id. at 32, 48 Ill.Dec. 548, 416 N.E.2d 1070.\nDuring the detention, Seymour could be placed in the lockup; hence he could also be strip-searched for security\nreasons. Id. at 38-39, 48 Ill.Dec. 548, 416 N.E.2d 1070. Moreover, he could also have been searched as an\nincident of his arrest, and under the circumstances the search incident to arrest could have been a strip search. \n[7]\nId. at 38, 40-41, 48 Ill.Dec. 548, 416 N.E.2d 1070.\nIt is apparent that Seymour II precludes reliance on the rule of Seymour I 00 i.e., that a strip search is per se\n97\nunreasonable unless a misdemeanor arrestee has been told that he can post bond and fails to do so. It is also\napparent that Seymour II does not authorize strip searches in all circumstances.\nII\nWe review the district judge's grant of a new trial here only for abuse of discretion. Hahn v. Becker, 588 F.2d 768,\n771 (7th Cir. 1979). But Rule 61 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (quoted in note 4 supra) sets some\nboundaries on that discretion by requiring that the error or defect upon which the grant of new trial is based be\nsuch that it \"affect[s] the substantial rights of the parties.\" Cf. Juneau Square Corp. v. First Wisconsin National\nBank, 624 F.2d 798, 807 (7th Cir. 1980), certiorari denied, 449 U.S. 1013, 101 S.Ct. 571, 66 L.Ed.2d 472.\nThe question then is whether the district judge exceeded his discretion in deciding that the per se rule of \nSeymour I played a sufficiently important role in the trial of Miss Tikalsky's suit to warrant starting over again.\n180 Although Judge Perry was understandably nonplussed at the news *180 that the case had been reversed, a\nreview of the record convinces us that he overestimated its importance.\n[8]\nIt appears that Miss Tikalsky's lawyers adverted to Seymour I four times, never in the presence of the jury.\n(1) It was cited in the plaintiff's pretrial memorandum. Tr. 36.\n(2) It was mentioned as one of several reasons that a 1965 photograph of contraband obtained\nfrom strip searches of female arrestees should not be admitted in evidence. The proffer of the\nphotograph, the colloquy about its evidentiary value, and the judge's decision to admit it all took\nplace out of the jury's presence. Tr. 32-38.\n(3) Seymour I was summarized in the plaintiff's memorandum in opposition to the defendants'\npost-trial motion. The jury had been discharged by this time.\n(4) Seymour I was cited as plaintiff's authority for Instruction Number 41, the partial text of which\nwas read to the jury. The jury did not have access to copies of the instructions and their supporting\nauthority during its deliberations.\nOf these four instances, only the instruction could have had any influence on the jury. We therefore examine it in\nmore detail.\nPlaintiff's proposed Instruction Number 41 read as follows:\nBy Illinois Supreme Court rule, bond for the municipal offense of disorderly conduct is $35.00.\nPolice officers are required to inform arrestees who have been charged with bondable offenses of\ntheir right to post bail and be released. Police officers can detain arrestees a reasonable time to\n\ncomplete their investigation and to fill out their arrest reports [; but during this reasonable\ndetention police cannot incarcerate the arrestee. Because there is no justification for taking the\narrestee into the lock-up, there is no need to search for contraband].\nThe court did not give the instruction as proposed, however. The bracketed language, which is derived directly\nfrom the reversed holding of Seymour I, was refused. The remainder of the instruction is not inconsistent with \nSeymour II 00 provided the word \"inform\" is not limited to oral advice but includes conveying information by written\n97\nnotice or poster. Thus the instruction as given does not misstate the applicable law, although it gives the jury\nvirtually no guidance on the search issue.\nEven if Instruction Number 41 were clearly wrong, the district judge's inquiry (and ours as a reviewing court)\nwould not be at an end.\nAlleged errors in jury instructions are considered in the light, not only of the instructions as a\nwhole, but of the allegations of the complaint, the opening statement, the evidence, and the\nclosing arguments. Beard v. Mitchell, 604 F.2d 485, 497-98 (7th Cir. 1979); Musgrave v. Union\nCarbide Corp., 493 F.2d 224, 231 (7th Cir. 1974) * * *. We consider all that the jury heard and * * *\ndecide \"not whether the charge was faultless in every particular but whether the jury was misled in\nany way and whether it had understanding of the issues and its duty to determine those issues.\" \nBorel v. Fibreboard Paper Products Corp., 493 F.2d 1076, 1100 (5th Cir. 1973) (Wisdom, J.), cert.\ndenied,419 U.S. 869, 95 S.Ct. 127, 42 L.Ed.2d 107 * * *.\nAlloy International Co. v. Hoover-NSK Bearing Company, Inc., 635 F.2d 1222, 1226-1227 (7th Cir.\n1980)\nUnder that standard, the jury verdict must be reinstated. The complaint did not mention the bondable nature of\n181 Miss Tikalsky's *181 offense or the impropriety of putting her in the lockup. It merely alleged (amended Count III,\n¶¶ 32 and 33) that the strip search was not justified on any of the traditional grounds 00 suspicion of concealed\n97\nweapons or contraband, fear that Miss Tikalsky might escape, or fear that she might harm herself, the police, or\nothers in the police station. The City put on extensive evidence to demonstrate the need to strip search all female\narrestees 00 including all misdemeanants 00 none of which was excluded in reliance on Seymour I. Finally, the 82\n97 97\ninstructions that were read to the jury did not allude to the Seymour I theory. Instead they presented a\ncomprehensive and correct statement of the law the jury had to be guided by in considering the strip-search\nclaim. For example, the jury should consider the charge as a whole, and not single out any one instruction (Pl. 1\n& 4). Search incident to arrest does not require a warrant but cannot be unreasonable (Pl. 36). Reasonableness\nstandards are applicable to all searches without a warrant, including searches incident to traffic arrests and to\narrests for bondable misdemeanors (id.). In evaluating the equal protection claim, the jury should consider the\nCity's interest in lockup security (Def. 25 & 26). A visual strip search is not necessarily violative of the\nconstitutional rights of a detainee (Def. 29). Less than probable cause would justify such a search (Def. 30). The\ntest of reasonableness requires a balancing of the \"significant and legitimate security interests of the City against\nthe private interest of the plaintiff\" (Def. 26). Against this background, the fact that Instruction Number 41\noriginally contained Seymour I language, which was stricken before the instruction was read to the jury, pales into\n[9]\ninsignificance.\nBut for the fortuitous timing of Seymour II, the City's post-trial motion would have been summarily 00 and properly\n97\n00 denied. Its main contentions are essentially frivolous. This is certainly not a case to be reversed for insufficient\n97\nevidence, i.e., because no rational jury could have found plaintiff's case proved by a preponderance of the\n[10] [11]\nevidence. Nor is Bell v. Wolfish the panacea the City claims.  If the balancing test prescribed in Wolfish\n182 were as predestined in outcome as the City contends, a *182 number of post-Wolfish cases would have been\n[12]\nwrongly decided.\nFinding that the jury verdict against the City of Chicago ought not to have been disturbed, we remand to the\ndistrict court with directions that the verdict and the award be reinstated. Costs to appellant.\n\n[*] This appeal was originally decided by an unpublished order on August 2, 1982 pursuant to Circuit Rule 35.\nThe Court has subsequently decided to issue that decision as an opinion.\n[**] The Honorable Floyd R. Gibson, Senior Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth\nCircuit, is sitting by designation.\n[1] Because the verdict was a general one (see p. 177 supra), different standards applied to the two actions\nsought by defendants' motion. The judgment n.o.v. was proper only if none of the alternative theories of liability\nmade out a case against Schmiedeknecht. The new trial order was proper if prejudicial error could be shown as\nto any of the theories. See King v. Ford Motor Co., 597 F.2d 436, 439 (5th Cir. 1979), cited in 5A Moore's Federal\nPractice ¶ 49.02 (1982 pocket part).\n[2] The district judge found a symptom of confusion in the acquittal of police officer Pepper who made the arrest\nthat led to the strip search. On the contrary, the arresting officer had no actual involvement with or supervisory\nresponsibility for the strip search. His acquittal seems indicative of jury acumen rather than jury confusion.\n[3] An order granting a new trial is not ordinarily appealable. 6A Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 59.15[1] at 59-275\n(1982). Accordingly Miss Tikalsky first sought a writ of mandamus directing the district judge to restore the\njudgment in her favor. Subsequently she sought and obtained a certification from the district judge under 28\nU.S.C. § 1292(b) and we accepted the appeal.\n[4] Rule 61 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: \nNo error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in\nanything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside\na verdict or for vacating, modifying or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action\nappears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every stage of the proceeding must\ndisregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\n[5] She relies on Rule 59(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides in part: \"After giving the\nparties notice and an opportunity to be heard on the matter, the court may grant a motion for a new trial, timely\nserved, for a reason not stated in the motion.\" She argues that the Seymour issue, which was raised only in the\ndefendants' last memorandum, to which she could not respond, amounts to \"a reason not stated in the motion.\"\n[6] Article I, Section 6 states: \"The people shall have the right to be secure in their persons * * against\nunreasonable searches, seizures, invasions of privacy or interceptions of communications by eavesdropping\ndevices or other means.\" The Seymour I court specifically did not reach Seymour's federal constitutional grounds.\n80 Ill.App.3d at 231, 35 Ill.Dec. 241, 398 N.E.2d 1191.\n[7] The Seymour II court took pains to limit its holding to the circumstances of Seymour's search. \"[W]e here\nacknowledge that a strip search may be entirely unreasonable and a violation of constitutional rights when\nconducted incident to custodial arrests in certain situations. We are here saying only that the arrest in this case\nwas not one of those situations.\" Id. 84 Ill.2d at 38, 48 Ill.Dec. 548, 416 N.E.2d 1070; cf. 40-41, 48 Ill.Dec. 548,\n416 N.E.2d 1070.\n[8] The record on appeal contains only one volume of transcript of in-court proceedings (examination of Ms.\nSmolinski, a police matron). This Court issued a sua sponte order requesting that any other transcripts be\ntransmitted to us, but we are informed that no others were prepared. At oral argument, however, counsel for Miss\nTikalsky represented that she never argued to the jury that the per se rule of Seymour I had direct application to\nthis case. Counsel for the City did not contradict this assertion at oral argument or in his brief, and we accept it as\ntrue.\n[9] As Miss Tikalsky has pointed out, \"it would be a terrible irony * * * if the District Court were allowed to strike\nthe language of an instruction which relied on the supporting authority, and then grant a new trial because the\nsupporting authority on which the stricken language was based was reversed\" (Reply Br. 3).\n\n[10] Note, too, that the City's theory of the rule of Bell v. Wolfish in paragraph 1(a) of its post-trial motion (supra,\npp. 177-178) differs markedly from the theory espoused in its own Instruction Number 26 which was given and\nprovides as follows: \nThe test of reasonableness of a search under the 14th Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of personal rights that the search entails.\nThus if after balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the City against the private interest of the\nplaintiff, you determine that the searching policy of which the plaintiff complains is rationally relative to the said\nsecurity interests of the Lockup facility, then you must find this search to be reasonable and not in violation of\nplaintiff's constitutional rights.\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559-560, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884-1885, 60 L.Ed.2d 447, 481-482\nThis Instruction correctly analyzes Wolfish: the case did not validate strip searches per se as claimed in the City's\nmotion.\n[11] \"The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical\napplication. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\npersonal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in\nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" 441 U.S. at 559, 99\nS.Ct. at 1884. In Wolfish, the Court applied the test to find no constitutional violation in visual body-cavity\nsearches of federal pretrial detainees in New York City's Metropolitan Correctional Center. It is noteworthy that\n\"[u]nder the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3146, a person in the federal system is committed to a detention facility\nonly because no other less drastic means can reasonably ensure his presence at trial.\" Id. at 524, 99 S.Ct. at\n1866.\n[12]E.g., Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1981), certiorari denied, 455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71\nL.Ed.2d 653 (visual strip search of woman charged with driving while intoxicated \"conclusively shown to be\nunconstitutional under the standards laid out in Bell v. Wolfish * * *,\" 660 F.2d at 1013); Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d\n160 (7th Cir. 1980) (unconstitutional to conduct visual strip searches of people arrested for non-misdemeanor\ntraffic offenses). Cf.

The strip searches were conducted in accordance with a policy of the City that existed from 1952 to\n1980. That policy required a strip search and a visual inspection of the body cavities of all women arrested and\ndetained in the City lockups, regardless of the charges against the women and without regard to whether the\narresting officers or detention aides had reason to believe that the women were concealing weapons or\ncontraband on their persons. The policy did not apply to men, who were subjected to a thorough hand search.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThree of the plaintiffs-appellees, Mary Beth G., Sharon N., and Hinda Hoffman, were plaintiffs in a class action\nsuit, Jane Does v. City of Chicago, No. 79 C 789 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 12, 1982), filed on March 1, 1979. Plaintiffs in that\ncase alleged that the strip search policy of the City of Chicago was unconstitutional. The parties subsequently\nentered into an agreement and stipulation in settlement of the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief whereby the\nCity was permanently enjoined from instituting strip searches or body cavity searches on women and not on\nsimilarly situated men and from performing strip searches of any person charged with a traffic, regulatory, or\nmisdemeanor offense unless police reasonably believed that the arrestee was concealing weapons or\n[1]\ncontraband.  The terms of the agreement and stipulation, set out in an order filed with the district court on\nMarch 26, 1980, made clear that the change in policy was not an admission of liability on the part of the\ndefendants.\n\nThereafter, the plaintiffs moved to sever the issues of the defendants' liability and the constitutionality of the strip\nsearch policy; the district court granted this motion. Plaintiffs then moved for partial summary judgment,\nmaintaining that the strip search policy was unconstitutional on its face. The district court agreed with plaintiffs\nand held that the search policy of the City violated the fourth amendment, as incorporated by the fourteenth\namendment, and the equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment and the Illinois constitution. Jane\nDoes v. City of Chicago, No. 79 C 789 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 12, 1982). The court ordered that the parties select typical\ncases to separate out for trial on the issue of plaintiffs' damages. Pursuant to this order, jury trials on the issue of\ndamages were held, and verdicts of $25,000 were returned for plaintiffs Mary Beth G. and Sharon N., and an\naward of $60,000 was returned for Hinda Hoffman. The City appeals from the district court's determination that\nthe strip search policy was unconstitutional and contests the size of the damage awards.\n1267 *1267 The remaining plaintiff-appellee, Mary Ann Tikalsky, commenced her suit on August 16, 1978, naming as\ndefendants two Chicago police officers. Her complaint alleged false arrest and the use of excessive force in\nviolation of the Civil Rights Act. On June 15, 1979, after commencement of the Jane Does class action suit,\nplaintiff amended her complaint to include a charge of unlawful search and seizure. Named as additional\ndefendants were the City of Chicago and various other officials and officers of the Chicago Police Department.\nAfter a jury trial, the defendant police officers were acquitted of the false arrest and use of excessive force\ncharges, but plaintiff prevailed against the City and one individual defendant on the illegal search claim. Plaintiff\nreceived compensatory damages in the amount of $30,000. Immediately thereafter, the district court granted\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of the individual defendant. The district court also ordered a new\ntrial for the City after the court concluded that the jury had been improperly instructed. The plaintiff appealed the\norder granting the new trial to this court, and we held that the jury instructions were proper. Tikalsky v. City of\nChicago, 687 F.2d 175 (7th Cir.1982). We ordered that the case be remanded to the district court and that the\nverdict and award against the City be reinstated. On remand, the district court reinstated judgment on the verdict\nagainst the City and subsequently awarded plaintiff $2,000 in attorney's fees and $2,426.85 in costs. The City\nappeals the judgment, and plaintiff cross-appeals from the district court's order respecting the award of attorney's\nfees and costs.\nAlthough the circumstances surrounding the arrests and detentions of each of the plaintiffs-appellees in these\nconsolidated cases are not identical, the situations involve the following common elements: each woman was\n[2]\narrested for a misdemeanor offense  and each was subjected to the strip search policy of the City of Chicago.\n[3]\n That policy, as described by the City, required each woman placed in the detention facilities of the Chicago\nPolice Department and searched by female police personnel to:\n1) lift her blouse or sweater and to unhook and lift her brassiere to allow a visual inspection of the\nbreast area, to replace these articles of clothing and then\n2) to pull up her skirt or dress or to lower her pants and pull down any undergarments, to squat\ntwo or three times facing the detention aide and to bend over at the waist to permit visual\n[4]\ninspection of the vaginal and anal area.\n1268 *1268 The strip search policy was not applied to males. Male detainees were subject to a strip search only if the\narresting officers or detention aides had reason to believe that the detainee was concealing weapons or\ncontraband. Otherwise, men were searched thoroughly by hand. The male detainee would place his hands\nagainst the wall and stand normally while the searching officer, with his fingers, would go through the hair, into\nthe ears, down the back, under the armpits, down both arms, down the legs, into the groin area, and up the front.\nThe officer would also search the waistband and require the detainee to remove his shoes and sometimes his\nsocks. Originally, women detainees were also searched in this manner, but in 1952 the City changed its policy\nand began conducting the strip searches.\n\nII. CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS\nThe district court in the Jane Does case found that, as a matter of law, the strip search policy conducted by the\nCity violated the fourth amendment, as applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment, and the equal\nprotection clause of the fourteenth amendment. The court also determined that the policy violated the equal\n[5]\nprotection provision of the Illinois constitution respecting gender. Ill. Const. (1970), art. I, sec. 18.  The federal\nconstitutional grounds were also raised in the jury trial of plaintiff-appellee Tikalsky and served as a basis for the\nverdict insofar as the jury relied on them. Because the equal protection provision of the Illinois constitution\nrespecting gender is at least coextensive with the requirements of the fourteenth amendment, People v. Ellis, 57\nIll.2d 127, 311 N.E.2d 98 (1974), we need only discuss the federal constitutional grounds for challenging the strip\nsearch policy, as we find both grounds have merit.\nA. Fourth Amendment Ground.\nThe fourth amendment of the United States Constitution, deemed incorporated into the fourteenth amendment\nand applicable to the states, provides that:\n[t]he right of the people to be secured in their persons ... against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause....\nBecause the prohibition announced by the fourth amendment extends to \"unreasonable\" searches, our task is to\ndecide whether the strip search policy of the City as applied to these plaintiffs-appellees was unreasonable under\nestablished fourth amendment principles.\nThe Supreme Court has adopted the position that searches of the person are generally impermissible absent a\nsearch warrant, which is to issue only on probable cause. New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 457, 101 S.Ct. 2860,\n2862, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1980) (\"It is a first principle of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that the police may not\nconduct a search unless they first convince a neutral magistrate that there is probable cause to do so.\"). The\ncourt has recognized, however, that a warrantless search may be reasonable if the exigencies of the situation\ncompel an exception. Id.\nThe City argues that its strip search policy is valid under two recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement.\nOne exception allows warrantless searches incident to custodial arrests. New York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 101\nS.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981); United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771\n(1974); United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973); Chimel v. California, 395\nU.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). A second exception permits warrantless searches incident to the\ndetention of persons lawfully arrested. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); \n1269 United States v.*1269Edwards, 415 U.S. at 804-05, n. 6, 94 S.Ct. at 1238 n. 6. The two exceptions are related;\nboth stem from the arrest process for which the Supreme Court has recognized several exceptions to the warrant\nrequirement. The Supreme Court has observed, however, that \"the factors justifying a search of the person and\npersonal effects of an arrestee upon reaching a police station but prior to being placed in confinement are\nsomewhat different from the factors justifying an immediate search at the time and place of arrest.\" Illinois v.\nLafayette, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 2609, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983).\nThe search incident to arrest exception arose because of the need \"to remove any weapons that [the arrestee]\nmight seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape\" and the need to prevent the concealment or\ndestruction of evidence. Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. at 763, 89 S.Ct. at 2040. Initially, the Supreme Court\nattempted to tie strictly the scope of the search to \"`the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible,'\" \nid. at 762, 89 S.Ct. at 2039 (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1878, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)),\nbut the Court subsequently rejected that position in United States v. Robinson. The majority in Robinson was\nunwilling to place on the arresting officer the burden of deciding in each case \"whether or not there [is] present\none of the reasons supporting the authority for a search of the person incident to a lawful arrest.\" 414 U.S. at\n235, 94 S.Ct. at 476. It recognized that a \"police officer's determination as to how and where to search the person\n\nof a suspect ... is necessarily a quick ad hoc judgment,\" and that the danger of concealed weapons alone\nprovides \"an adequate basis for treating all custodial arrests alike for purposes of search justification.\" Id.\nConsequently, the Court held that once an arrest based on probable cause has been made, no further\nexamination into probable cause for the scope of the search is necessary; it concluded that the foundation of the\nsearch incident to arrest exception flows automatically from the fact of arrest:\nA custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the\nFourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no\nadditional justification. It is the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search,\nand we hold that in the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an\nexception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a \"reasonable\" search\nunder that Amendment.\nId.\nRobinson establishes, therefore, that a police officer does not have to assess the likelihood that the individual\narrestee is possessing a weapon or concealing evidence but may undertake a \"full search\" of an arrested person\naimed toward the discovery of weapons, instruments of escape, and evidence that could otherwise be concealed\nor destroyed. It is worth noting, however, that in reaching this conclusion the Court was concerned mainly with \nwhether a search calculated to disarm the suspect and to preserve evidence on the suspect's person could be\nundertaken, regardless of the reason for the arrest, not with the intensity of the particular search itself. The Court\ndid not suggest that a person validly arrested may be subject to any search the arresting officer feels is\n[6]\nnecessary.  The majority merely concluded that because each arrest brings with it certain factors 00 dangers to\n97\nand the need for ad hoc judgments by the police 00 the application of a straightforward rule that always permits a\n97\nconcomitant \"full search\" incident to custodial arrest aimed toward the discovery of weapons and contraband\nwould conclusively be presumed to be a reasonable one. Police thus would be relieved of the responsibility of\n1270 having to decide whether they could search a particular *1270 arrestee for weapons or contraband in the first\ninstance. Under Robinson, a \"full search\" is the maximum intensity of the search allowable to achieve that end,\nunless specific reasons exist that justify intensifying the search. In characterizing what constitutes a full search\nincident to arrest, the Robinson Court quoted with approval language from Terry that describes a reasonable\nsearch incident to arrest as one involving \"a relatively extensive exploration of the person,\" Terry v. Ohio, 392\nU.S. at 25, 88 S.Ct. at 1882,quoted in United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. at 227, 94 S.Ct. at 473. The majority\nspecifically noted that it would be willing to find unconstitutional a search that was \"extreme or patently abusive.\" \n414 U.S. at 236, 94 S.Ct. at 477.\nAlthough the time at which the plaintiffs-appellees in the cases before us were searched extends beyond what\nlaypersons would probably consider \"incident to the arrest,\" the Supreme Court has defined the arrest procedure\nbroadly enough to include searches at the place of detention, since \"that is no more than a continuation of the\ncustody inherent in the arrest status.\" Illinois v. Lafayette, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 2609, 77 L.Ed.2d 65\n(1983). Thus, in United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974), the Court held\nthat authorities could exchange and search, with or without probable cause, the clothing of an arrestee who\nremained in custody overnight. The Court stated that exchanging and searching the arrestee's clothing and\nsubjecting it to laboratory tests on the day after his arrest \"was no more than taking from [him] the effects in his\nimmediate possession that constituted evidence of crime. This was and is a normal incident of a custodial arrest,\nand reasonable delay in effectuating it does not change the fact that [the arrestee] was no more imposed upon\nthan he could have been at the time and place of the arrest or immediately upon arrival at the place of detention.\"\nId. at 805, 94 S.Ct. at 1238. The Court also observed that not only was the search a normal incident of a\ncustodial arrest, but that it followed \"the established and routine custom of permitting a jailer to search the person\nwho is being processed for confinement under his custody and control\" and that \"little doubt has ever been\nexpressed about the validity or reasonableness of such searches incident to incarceration.\" Id. at 804-05 n. 6, 94\nS.Ct. at 1238 n. 6. In fact, the Court more recently has stated that\n[t]he governmental interests underlying a station house search of the arrestee's person and\npossessions may in some circumstances be even greater than those supporting a search\nimmediately following arrest. Consequently, the scope of a stationhouse search will often vary\n\nfrom that made at the time of arrest. Police conduct that would be impractical or unreasonable 00\n97\nor embarrassingly intrusive 00 on the street can more readily 00 and privately 00 be performed at the\n97 97 97\nstation. For example, the interests supporting a search incident to arrest would hardly justify\ndisrobing an arrestee on the street, but the practical necessities of routine jail administration may\neven justify taking a prisoner's clothes before confining him, although the step would be rare. This\nwas made clear in United States v. Edwards. ...\n103 S.Ct. at 2609. In Lafayette, however, the Court stated that \"[w]e were not addressing in Edwards, and do not\ndiscuss here, the circumstances in which a strip search of an arrestee may or may not be appropriate.\" Id. at n. 2.\nIndeed, the focus in Edwards, as in Robinson, once again seems to have been on the permissible scope of\nsearches incident to arrest; the Court accepted the proposition that the scope of the search at the stationhouse\ncould be at least as broad as that at the time of the arrest, thus approving the search of items that were on the\narrestee at the time of arrest. Edwards, however, also reaffirms the controlling principle that custodial searches\nincident to arrest still must be reasonable ones: \"Holding the Warrant Clause inapplicable in the circumstances\npresent here does not leave law enforcement officials subject to no restraints. This type of police conduct `must\n1271 [still] be tested *1271 by the Fourth Amendment's general proscription against unreasonable searches and\nseizures.'\" 415 U.S. at 808 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. at 1239 n. 9 (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. at 20, 88 S.Ct. at 1879).\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court explicitly explored the\nscope of permissible searches incident to incarceration. The challenged searches in Wolfish involved visual body\ncavity searches of federal pretrial detainees at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. The\nsearches were made after every contact visit a detainee had with a person from outside the institution. To\nevaluate the reasonableness of these searches, the Court employed a balancing test that has now become a\ntouchstone for fourth amendment analysis:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. Recognizing that a detention facility is a \"unique place fraught with serious security\ndangers,\" id., and that the strip search policy might act as an effective deterrent to the smuggling of weapons or\ncontraband into the institution, the Court held that the searches, in this instance, could be conducted on less than\nprobable cause despite the significant privacy interests of the inmates. Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885.\nAbsent precedent that is clearly controlling, it is incumbent on us to examine independently the searches\nconducted here in light of the requirement of the fourth amendment that they not be \"unreasonable.\" We cannot\nsay that the breadths of the exceptions relied on by the City clearly extend to the circumstances that exist in\nthese cases. In none of the arrest situations presented here was a routine search incident to arrest conducted by\nthe arresting officers; evidently, the arresting officers felt these women did not pose a danger to their safety. Even\nif a routine search incident to arrest had been undertaken, we believe that it would have been limited to the \"full\nsearch\" approved in Robinson, such as the thorough hand search performed there; the Robinson Court simply\ndid not contemplate the significantly greater intrusions that occurred here. Similarly, the searches in the cases\nbefore us are qualitatively different from the delayed custodial searches upheld in Edwards. The authorities who\nexchanged and searched the arrestee's clothing in Edwards had probable cause to believe the articles of clothing\nthe arrestee was wearing were themselves material evidence of the crime for which he had been arrested. United\nStates v. Edwards, 415 U.S. at 805, 808 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. at 1238, 1239 n. 9. Although Edwards also confirms the\nauthority of the police to exchange the arrestee's clothing for jail clothes and to keep the arrestee's clothing in\nofficial custody and search it even without probable cause, id. at 804, 94 S.Ct. at 1237, the intensity of such an\nintrusion 00 exchanging and searching one's clothes 00 is substantially less than that associated with the strip\n97 97\n[7]\nsearches involved here.\n1272 *1272Wolfish is also not controlling because the particularized searches in that case were initiated under\ndifferent circumstances. We have observed previously that the balancing test prescribed in Wolfish does not\n\nvalidate strip searches in detention settings per se. Tikalsky v. City of Chicago, 687 F.2d 175, 181-82 & n. 10 (7th\nCir.1982); Bono v. Saxbe, 620 F.2d 609, 617 (7th Cir.1980); see also Salinas v. Breier, 695 F.2d 1073, 1085 n. 1\n(7th Cir.1982) (Cummings, C.J., concurring). But see Clements v. Logan, 102 S.Ct. 284, 70 L.Ed.2d 461\n(Rehnquist, Circuit Justice, 1981) (temporary stay pending hearing on cert. petition), cert. denied,455 U.S. 942,\n102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982). Although the majority in Wolfish did uphold the strip searches conducted\nthere on less than probable cause, the detainees were awaiting trial on serious federal charges after having failed\nto make bond and were being searched after contact visits. In the cases before us, however, plaintiffs-appellees\nare minor offenders who were not inherently dangerous and who were being detained only briefly while awaiting\n[8]\nbond.  In light of the substantial nature of the intrusions involved, we believe these differences are sufficiently\nsignificant to compel our own inquiry as to whether the strip searches conducted by the City were \"reasonable\"\nunder the fourth amendment.\nOur starting point is the balancing test announced in Wolfish, beginning with the magnitude of the invasion of\npersonal rights. In Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980), we adopted the opinion of Judge Warren, 479\nF.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wis.1979), who quoted language from an oral decision, Sala v. County of Suffolk (E.D.N.Y.\nNov. 28, 1978) (unpublished decision), describing strip searches involving the visual inspection of the anal and\ngenital areas as \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing,\nrepulsive, signifying degradation and submission....\" 479 F.Supp. at 491. The testimony given by the plaintiffs-\nappellees in the district courts here ratifies this description. Even the Supreme Court has stated that a strip\nsearch and visual inspection \"instinctively gives us the most pause.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at\n1884; see also441 U.S. at 576-77, 99 S.Ct. at 1892 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\"the body cavity searches of MCC\ninmates represent one of the most grievous offenses against personal dignity and common decency\"); 441 U.S.\nat 594, 99 S.Ct. at 1902 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"The body-cavity search 00 clearly the greatest personal\n97\nindignity 00 may be the least justifiable measure of all [the security practices at the institution].\"). In short, we can\n97\nthink of few exercises of authority by the state that intrude on the citizen's privacy and dignity as severely as the\nvisual anal and genital searches practiced here.\nBalanced against this invasion of personal privacy is the governmental interest in conducting the particular\nsearches in question. 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. In these cases, the governmental interest alleged by the\nCity to justify these particular strip searches was the need to maintain the security of the City lockups by\npreventing misdemeanor offenders from bringing in weapons or contraband; the need was apparently felt to be\nso great that women misdemeanants were strip searched even when there was no reason to believe they were\nhiding weapons or contraband on their persons.\nThe evidence the City offered to demonstrate the need for requiring strip searches of women minor offenders to\nmaintain jail security, however, belies its purported concerns. The affidavits of the lockup personnel, which lack\nspecificity, suggest that only a few items have been recovered from the body cavities of women arrested on minor\ncharges over the years. In the only analytical survey submitted by the City, conducted over a thirty-five day period\n1273 in June and *1273 July of 1965, all of the items found in the body orifices[9] of the 1,800 women searched during\nthat period were taken from women charged with either prostitution (7 items), assault (1 item), or a narcotics\nviolation (1 item) (Ex. 7). These are the kinds of crimes, unlike traffic or other minor offenses, that might give rise\nto a reasonable belief that the woman arrestee was concealing an item in a body cavity. Although a detention\ncenter may be a place \"fraught with serious security dangers,\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884,\nthe evidence does not support the view that those dangers are created by women minor offenders entering the\nlockups for short periods while awaiting bail. Here, the \"need for the particular search,\" id., a strip search, is\nhardly substantial enough, in light of the evidence regarding the incidence of weapons and contraband found in\nthe body cavities of women minor offenders, to justify the severity of the governmental intrusion.\nBalancing the citizen's right to be free from substantial governmental intrusions against the mission of law\nenforcement personnel to ensure a safer society is often a difficult task. While the need to assure jail security is a\nlegitimate and substantial concern, we believe that, on the facts here, the strip searches bore an insubstantial\nrelationship to security needs so that, when balanced against plaintiffs-appellees' privacy interests, the searches\ncannot be considered \"reasonable.\" Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981),cert. denied,455 U.S. 942,\n102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982). The reasonableness standard usually requires, \"at a minimum, that the\n\nfacts upon which an intrusion is based be capable of measurement against `an objective standard,' whether this\nbe probable cause or a less stringent test.\" Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59\nL.Ed.2d 660 (1979) (footnotes omitted). The more intrusive the search, the closer governmental authorities must\ncome to demonstrating probable cause for believing that the search will uncover the objects for which the search\nis being conducted. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 18 n. 15, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1878 n. 15, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Based\non these principles, we agree with the district court in Jane Does that ensuring the security needs of the City by\nstrip searching plaintiffs-appellees was unreasonable without a reasonable suspicion by the authorities that either\nof the twin dangers of concealing weapons or contraband existed. Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F.2d 91, 93 (7th Cir.1980)\n(per curiam), cert. denied,451 U.S. 1022, 101 S.Ct. 3015, 69 L.Ed.2d 395 (1981) (strip search of a minor student\nwithout reasonable cause to believe she possessed contraband on her person violates \"any known principle of\nhuman decency\" and \"exceed[s] the `bounds of reason' by two and a half country miles\"); Tinetti v. Wittke, 620\nF.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980) (per curiam) (strip searches of persons arrested and detained overnight for\nnonmisdemeanor traffic offenses without probable cause to believe that detainees are concealing contraband or\nweapons on their bodies are unconstitutional). Accordingly, because the court and jury below could reasonably\nconclude that the strip search policy of the City as applied in these cases was unreasonable under the fourth\namendment, we uphold their determinations on this issue.\nB. Equal Protection Ground.\nThe policy of the City of Chicago under which female arrestees were routinely subjected to strip searches while\nsimilarly situated males were not established a significant disparity in treatment based on gender. Accordingly,\nthe policy is subject to scrutiny under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment, which requires\nthat the party seeking to uphold a policy that expressly discriminates on the basis of gender must carry the\nburden of showing an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" for the differing treatment. Mississippi University for\nWomen v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 102 S.Ct. 3331, 3336, 73 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1982). The burden is met \"only by\n1274 showing at least that the classification *1274 serves `important governmental objectives and that the\ndiscriminatory means employed' are `substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.'\" Id. (quoting \nWengler v. Druggists Mutual Insurance Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150, 100 S.Ct. 1540, 1545, 64 L.Ed.2d 107 (1980)); \nPersonnel Administration of Massachusetts v. Feeny, 442 U.S. 256, 273, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 2293, 60 L.Ed.2d 870\n(1979). For the reasons that follow, we believe the City has failed to carry its burden.\nThe City argues initially that the strip searches conducted on women were no more intrusive than the thorough\nhand search used on men and that both sexes were therefore subjected to equal treatment. This assertion runs\ncontrary to common experience. As we have already observed, the visual cavity searches conducted by the City\nare one of the more humiliating invasions of privacy imaginable, and we find those searches to be substantially\nmore intrusive than the thorough hand searches.\nThe City also argues that the strip searches of women detainees served the important governmental interest of\nensuring the integrity and safety of the City lockups. It maintains that the decision to search men and women\ndifferently was not arbitrary but based on the documented ability of women arrestees to secrete weapons and\ncontraband in the vaginal cavity and the inability to discover such items by a thorough hand search. The City\nintroduced several affidavits of security personnel and one statistical survey in an attempt to show that weapons\nand contraband can be and have been concealed in the vagina. Although the affidavits lacked specificity, the\ndistrict court in Jane Does concluded that, for the purpose of summary judgment, the documents demonstrated\nthat weapons can be concealed on or within the body cavities of females. The court also concluded, however,\nthat the evidence also showed that weapons can be secreted on or within the bodies of males. It thus found that\nthe policy of the City under which only the body cavities of female, but not male, arrestees were visually\ninspected violated the women's rights to equal protection.\nThe problem with the City's position, of course, is that it has failed to show why the presence of the vaginal cavity\nmade it necessary to strip search only women to achieve its objective of ensuring the security of the City lockups\nand unnecessary to search the body cavities of males, which can be and occasionally are used to conceal\n[10]\nweapons or contraband.  The equal protection clause, of course, does not proscribe gender as a basis for\nclassification when the situations of men and women are in fact different. Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma\n\nCounty, 450 U.S. 464, 101 S.Ct. 1200, 67 L.Ed.2d 437 (1981). Here, however, the City has failed to show that\nmen and women minor offenders are not similarly situated. Nowhere has the City demonstrated that the\nincidence of items found in the vaginal cavities of women was so much greater than that associated with items\nsecreted in the anal cavities of men to justify the grossly disparate search treatment. Because the City has\noffered no comparative data to suggest that women arrested for minor offenses conceal items in their vaginas to\nsuch a degree as to justify strip searching only women and not men arrested for similar offenses, it cannot show\na \"substantial relation between the disparity and an important state purpose.\" Lehr v. Robertson, ___ U.S. ___,\n103 S.Ct. 2985, 2996, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983). Under these circumstances, we must agree with the district court\nin Jane Does that the City has not met its burden of demonstrating that the difference in gender alone justified the\ndisparate search treatment accorded men and women. We therefore affirm the decisions below on the additional\nground that the strip search policy instituted by the City violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth\namendment.\n1275  III. JURY AWARDS\n*1275\nThe City argues that the jury awards in each of the cases before us are excessive and that we should order\nremittiturs. The awards for plaintiffs-appellees Mary Beth G. and Sharon N. were $25,000 each, while plaintiff-\nappellee Mary Ann Tikalsky received $30,000. The remaining plaintiff-appellee, Hinda Hoffman, received an\naward of $60,000. In determining whether an award is excessive, we are to accord substantial deference to the\ndecision of the jury and will not disturb an award unless we are convinced that it is \"monstrously excessive\" or \"so\nlarge as to shock the conscience of the court.\" Huff v. White Motor Corp., 609 F.2d 286, 296 (7th Cir.1979); \nGalard v. Johnson, 504 F.2d 1198, 1199 (7th Cir.1974).\nAfter having carefully appraised the evidence bearing on damages, we believe that the evidence submitted by\neach of the plaintiffs-appellees is sufficient to support the awards. The testimony offered by each woman\nregarding emotional and mental distress resulting from the searches was adequately corroborated by persons\nwho knew the women best. The testimony revealed, inter alia, instances of shock, panic, depression, shame,\nrage, humiliation, and nightmares, with lasting effects on each woman's life. Under these circumstances, we are\nnot in a position to second guess the juries' findings on the actual measurement of damages. Whitley v. Seibel,\n676 F.2d 245 (7th Cir.1982).\nWe recognize that while three of the awards are generally consistent with one another, the award of $60,000 to\nplaintiff-appellee Hinda Hoffman is at least twice as great as the others. In the past, we have sometimes reduced\ndamage awards when they have been out of line with a clear trend of awards at lesser amounts. See, e.g., \nPhillips v. Hunter Trails Community Association, 685 F.2d 184 (7th Cir.1982) (housing discrimination award of\n$25,000 made by trial judge reduced to $10,000 in part because original award was more than twice as much as\nreceived by any other victim of housing discrimination for intangible injuries in litigation over a 14 year period).\nHere, the award is greater than most other awards given by the juries for damages in similar strip search cases\ninvolving the City of Chicago so as to be out of step with nascent trends, although at least one award has gone\n[11]\nnearly as high.  One explanation for the higher award may be that plaintiff-appellee Hoffman alleged\naggravating circumstances associated with the strip search that the jury was free to find as having been\nproximately caused by the policy of the City and therefore compensable against it. Plaintiff-appellee Hoffman\ntestified that two male police officers were within view when she was strip searched, and that a group of\nprostitutes jeered at her as the search was conducted. A jury could reasonably infer that the magnitude of\nplaintiff-appellee Hoffman's intangible injuries were significantly affected by these circumstances. Still, at least\none of the other plaintiffs-appellees also believed she was being viewed by male police personnel while she was\nbeing searched, Brief of Plaintiff-Appellee Mary Beth G. at 4, and the manifestations of plaintiff-appellee\nHoffman's psychic and emotional injuries do not appear to us to be significantly different from those of the other\nplaintiffs-appellees; the record reveals that each woman described the emotional and psychic effect of the search\nin similar language, each woman still thinks about the strip search, and each woman's attitudes and relationships\nwith others have been colored by the experience. In addition, some elements of plaintiff-appellee Hoffman's\n1276 claimed damages appear at least tenuous when measured *1276 against the usual damage standard of\ncausation and foreseeability. For example, her own evidence discloses that part of her distress resulted from her\n\ndissatisfaction with the way her brother, an attorney, responded to her situation and handled her traffic violation\ncase; despite her insistence that her brother tell the traffic judge about her strip search, her brother thought it best\nnot to mention the incident. Even her breakup with her boyfriend six months after the strip search was attributed\nto the search, although her boyfriend testified that it was hard from him to say exactly what caused the breakup.\nDespite this not uncommon attempt to load every injury possible onto the back of the wrong in an effort to\nincrease the damage award, there nonetheless remains in this case, considering the nature of the constitutional\nwrong suffered, sufficient evidence of humiliation and mental distress to support the jury's damage award.\nWhatever misgivings we may have about the size of the award to plaintiff-appellee Hoffman must give way to our\nrecognition of the function of the jury as the primary finder of fact. The jury is the collective conscience of the\ncommunity, and its assessment of damages must be given particular weight when intangible injuries are involved.\nAlthough a jury's perceptions may vary from our own, we will not disturb its assessment of compensatory\ndamages \"unless in our judgment it can aptly be described as `grossly excessive' or `monstrous' or with similar\nperjorative adjectival terms.\" Huff, 609 F.2d at 297. Thus, although the amount awarded to plaintiff-appellee\nHoffman is significantly greater than the amount awarded to the other plaintiffs-appellees, it is not so \"grossly\nexcessive\" under these particular circumstances as to require a reduction. Accordingly, we affirm the amount of\nthe verdicts in each of these cases.\nIV. ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS\nPlaintiff below Mary Ann Tikalsky cross-appeals from the decision of the district court regarding plaintiff's motion\nfor an allowance of attorney's fees. Tikalsky v. City of Chicago, No. 78 C 3260 (N.D.Ill. March 30, 1983). The\nmotion was brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (1976), which authorizes a court in its discretion to grant\n[12]\nreasonable attorney's fees as part of the costs to all \"prevailing parties\" in a section 1983 action.  Both\nplaintiffs and defendants may be considered \"prevailing parties\" for purposes of section 1988, although the\nstandard for defendants is different from that for plaintiffs.\nThe district court rejected plaintiff's request for attorney's fees for the whole trial, which amounted in plaintiff's\n[13]\nestimate to $146,568.75.  In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on the fact that plaintiff had prevailed on\nonly one of her three claims. Plaintiff's original complaint, filed on August 16, 1978, charged two Chicago police\nofficers with false arrest and excessive force in connection with plaintiff's arrest for disorderly conduct. The\ncomplaint was subsequently amended on June 15, 1979, to include a third count alleging various constitutional\nviolations relating to the strip search of plaintiff. Named as additional defendants were the City of Chicago and\nother personnel of the Chicago Police Department. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the arresting officers on\nthe false arrest and excessive force claims and in favor of all of the defendants except the City and one individual\n1277 defendant on the strip search claim. The verdict against the *1277 individual defendant was subsequently\ndismissed by the court.\nThe district court considered our decision in Lenard v. Argento, 699 F.2d 874 (7th Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S.\n___, 104 S.Ct. 69, 78 L.Ed.2d 84 (1983), to be the guide for determining what fees are available to a prevailing\nplaintiff. In that case, we stated that \"attorney's fees should be awarded only for the preparation and presentation\nof claims on which the plaintiff has prevailed. `[T]he amount of attorney's fees they receive [prevailing plaintiff]\nshould be based on the work performed on the issues in which they were successful.'\" Id. at 899 (quoting \nNadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 279 (1st Cir.1978)). The district court termed \"preposterous\" plaintiff's\nargument that the issues raised by the false arrest and excessive force counts were so intertwined with the\nissues relating to the strip search that plaintiff should have attorney's fees awarded to her for the whole trial. The\ncourt also found, without explanation, that the individual defendants were \"prevailing parties\" under the statute\nand that the amount plaintiff was entitled to recover in attorney's fees from the City was equal to the amount in\nattorney's fees that all of the defendants except the City were entitled to recover from plaintiff:\nThe Court finds that those amounts are equal. It is utterly impossible for the Court to identify item\nby item and hour by hour the amount of attorney's fees due for each of the parties hereto. This\ncase has been before this Court for all of the discovery and preliminary proceedings as well as the\n\nwhole trial, and the Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff and defendants, except the City of\nChicago, should both have the same amount of attorney's fees assessed against them.\nTikalsky v. City of Chicago, No. 78 C 3260, slip op. at 14-15 (N.D.Ill. March 30, 1983). Recognizing that the City\nwould ultimately receive any fees paid by plaintiff to the individual defendants and that this amount would equal\nthe amount the City would pay to plaintiff, the trial court assessed no attorney's fees against any party in\nconnection with the district court proceedings. The court also denied fees to plaintiff for work on the petition for\nmandamus compelling the trial court to set aside its order for a new trial for the City. However, the court did\npermit plaintiff to recover $2,000 for attorney's fees because of her success on the appeal of the district court's\norder granting a new trial to the City. The court based this amount on \"[the court's] knowledge of how much time\nwould be required for preparing an interlocutory appeal and arguing the same before the Court of Appeals.\" Id. at\n16. In addition, the court awarded court costs to plaintiff in the amount of $2,426.85.\nPlaintiff maintains that the district court committed the following legal errors: (1) it awarded attorney's fees to\ncounsel for each of the individual defendants (i.e., all defendants except the City of Chicago); (2) it discounted\nplaintiff's request for time spent litigating the liability of the defendants in supervisory capacities on the strip\nsearch claim; (3) it denied plaintiff fees for work on the petition for mandamus; (4) it awarded fees for the appeal\nwithout regard to plaintiff's time sheets. Brief of Plaintiff-Appellant (Tikalsky) at 27-28. Plaintiff also contends that\nthe district court failed to properly exercise its discretion in adjusting the rates and hours of plaintiff's attorneys\nand in awarding only certain costs.\nWe will discuss separately the award of attorney's fees to the individual defendants, the award of attorney's fees\nto plaintiff, and the award of only certain costs to plaintiff. We review the district court's actions only for abuse of\ndiscretion. Sanchez v. Schwartz, 688 F.2d 503 (7th Cir.1982).\nA. Award Of Attorney's Fees to the Individual Defendants.\nFor a defendant to be considered a \"prevailing party\" and entitled to attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988\n(1976), the court must find that the plaintiff's action was \"vexatious, frivolous, or brought to harass or embarrass\n1278 the defendant.\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. *1278 1933, 1937 n. 2, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); \nHughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 14, 101 S.Ct. 173, 178, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980); Badillo v. Central Steel & Wire Co.,\n717 F.2d 1160 at 1163 (7th Cir.1983). Although the plaintiff's subjective bad faith is not a prerequisite to a fee\naward in favor of the defendant, the merit of the plaintiff's claim should be judged without regard to the fact that\nthe plaintiff has lost on it. Only actions that are groundless or without foundation will give rise to an attorney's fee\naward for the defendant. Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. at 14, 101 S.Ct. at 178.\nThe district court found that \"in this case the facts are such that all of the defendants except the City of Chicago\nare entitled to recover attorney's fees against the plaintiff.\" Tikalsky v. City of Chicago, No. 78 C 3260, slip op. at\n14 (N.D.Ill. March 30, 1983). The court did not explain what \"the facts\" were that led to its conclusion that the\nindividual defendants were entitled to attorney's fees, nor did it refer to the legal standard for awarding attorney's\nfees to defendants. In reaching its conclusion, however, the district court necessarily held, albeit implicitly, that\nplaintiff's false arrest and excessive force claims against the arresting officers and her strip search claim against\nthe defendants other than the City were without foundation.\nIn order to facilitate review of district judges' discretion in awarding attorney's fees, it is necessary that the district\njudge \"make sufficient factual findings to enable the appellate court to track his decision.\" Sanchez v. Schwartz,\n688 F.2d 503, 506 (7th Cir.1982). See also Hensley v. Eckerhart, 103 S.Ct. at 1941 (\"It remains important ... for\nthe district court to provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award.\"). The district judge\nmade no finding that plaintiff's claims against the individual defendants were frivolous, unreasonable, or without\nfoundation. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court properly \"exercised its discretion\nsquarely within the permissible bounds of [the statute].\" Christianburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission, 434 U.S. 412, 424, 98 S.Ct. 694, 701, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).\nWe find it unnecessary, however, to issue a remand so that the district court can explain why the facts, when\njudged against the appropriate legal standard, warrant recovery of attorney's fees by each of the individual\n\ndefendants. Only recently we observed that generally cases in which fees have been assessed against a plaintiff\n\"have been limited to situations where plaintiff's conduct was abusive, or merely a disguised effort to harass or\nembarrass the defendant.\" Badillo v. Central Steel & Wire Co., 717 F.2d 1160 at 1164. We cannot say, after a\nthorough review of the record, that plaintiff's conduct in bringing these three claims arose to such a level; the\nfacts simply cannot support a conclusion that plaintiff's claims against the individual defendants were\nunreasonable, vexatious, or frivolous. Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 101 S.Ct. 173, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980).\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court awarding attorney's fees to the individual defendants.\nB. Award of Attorney's Fees to Plaintiff.\nA plaintiff will be considered a \"prevailing party\" and entitled to reasonable attorney's fees under section 1988 if\nthe plaintiff has succeeded \"`on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the part[y]\nsought in bringing the suit.'\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983)\n(quoting Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir.1978)). That has been the standard adopted in this\ncircuit, Lenard v. Argento, 699 F.2d 874, 899 (7th Cir.),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 69, 78 L.Ed.2d 84\n(1983); Busche v. Burkee, 649 F.2d 509, 521 (7th Cir.),cert. denied,454 U.S. 897, 102 S.Ct. 396, 70 L.Ed.2d 212\n(1981), and we believe the district court correctly applied it in this case. The plaintiff was successful on her\ncentral claim for relief and thus is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.\n1279 *1279 The considerations for determining the amount of reasonable attorney's fees were only recently described\nby the United States Supreme Court in Hensley v. Eckerhart, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40\n(1983), a case decided after the district court here issued its opinion. In determining what constitutes a\nreasonable attorney's fee, the trial judge is to have considerable discretion. Certain adjustments, however, are\nrequired as a matter of law. One of these requirements, announced in Hensley, is that if the plaintiff has\nsucceeded on only some of his or her claims for relief, the plaintiff may not recover fees for time expended on\n\"distinctly different claims for relief that are based on different facts and legal theories\" than the successful claims.\n103 S.Ct. at 1940. Work on unsuccessful, unrelated claims for relief\ncannot be deemed to have been \"expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved.\" Davis v.\nCounty of Los Angeles, 8 E.P.D. ¶ 9444, at 5049 (CDCal.1974). The congressional intent to limit\nawards to prevailing parties requires that these unrelated claims be treated as if they had been\nraised in separate lawsuits, and therefore no fee may be awarded for services on the\nunsuccessful claim.\nId. (footnote omitted).\nBecause Hensley only disapproves of awarding attorney's fees for time spent on unsuccessful claims for relief\nthat are unrelated to successful claims, however, time spent on unsuccessful, related claims may be\n[14]\ncompensated. 103 S.Ct. at 1940. Hensley recognizes that \"there is no certain method of determining when\nclaims are `related' or `unrelated.'\" Id. at 1941 n. 12. The case instructs, however, that the starting point for\nseparating an unrelated, unsuccessful claim from a related, unsuccessful claim is to determine whether a\nparticular unsuccessful claim shares a \"common core of facts\" with the successful claim or is based on a \"related\n[15]\nlegal theory.\" Id. We believe a useful tool for making this determination is to focus on whether the claims seek\nrelief for essentially the same course of conduct. Under this analysis, an unsuccessful claim will be unrelated to a\nsuccessful claim when the relief sought on the unsuccessful claim is intended to remedy a course of conduct\nentirely distinct and separate from the course of conduct that gave rise to the injury on which the relief granted is\npremised.\nWe believe that plaintiff's unsuccessful false arrest and excessive force claims requested relief for courses of\nconduct independent of plaintiff's strip search claim. The first two claims requested relief only from the two\n1280 arresting officers, not *1280 from the City, for damages flowing from the conduct surrounding the arrest itself; the\nchallenged conduct was that the arrest was undertaken without probable cause and was accomplished with\nexcessive force. The strip search claim, on the other hand, challenged only the conduct relating to the search,\nnamely, that the strip search was constitutionally unreasonable and discriminatory. Because the relief requested\n\non the false arrest and excessive force claims corresponds to courses of conduct \"distinctly different\" from that\nrelating to the strip search claim, the hours spent on these unsuccessful claims must be excluded in considering\n[16]\nthe amount of a reasonable attorney's fee. 103 S.Ct. at 1943. We therefore uphold the district court's\ndetermination that no fees should be awarded for time spent on the unsuccessful and unrelated false arrest and\n[17]\nexcessive force claims for relief.\nWe believe the district court erred, however, in not allowing plaintiff to recover fees for the time spent litigating the\nstrip search claim against the individual defendants. Regardless which of the various definitions of \"claim\" courts\n[18]\nadopt for use in the attorney's fees context,  we believe that the award of attorney's fees for time expended in\nremedying illegal conduct should not turn on whether only some or all of the defendants named in connection\nwith the conduct are ultimately held liable. Hensley clearly permits attorney's fees to be awarded for time spent\nrelating to matters not \"distinctly different\" from those on which the plaintiff ultimately succeeds. When defendants\nare not named frivolously in connection with the same illegal conduct, it follows that the matters involving the\ndifferent defendants will always be \"related.\" Here, for example, plaintiff's strip search claim sought relief for the\nsame constitutionally infirm course of conduct vis-a-vis the individual defendants as the City. The only difference\nin the tenor of the claim against the individual defendants was that the individual defendants were sued under a\ndifferent standard of liability than the City.\nAlthough the Supreme Court in Hensley did not specifically address situations in which a plaintiff brings a claim\nagainst several defendants but obtains relief from only some of them, we have already observed that the Court's\n1281 discussion of awards of attorney's fees is structured in *1281 terms of compensable \"claims for relief.\"[19] This\nlanguage suggests that all time spent in pursuit of relief for the same illegal conduct should be considered in\nawarding attorney's fees once the relief sought is obtained, regardless whether the plaintiff has succeeded in\nobtaining the relief from only some and not all of the defendants named in connection with the conduct. Once the\nrelief sought is obtained, the plaintiff will have succeeded. It would therefore be illogical to define compensable\n\"claims for relief\" in terms of defendants, because once the plaintiff's claim succeeds against one defendant, the\nplaintiff will have achieved full relief for the illegal course of conduct notwithstanding the plaintiff's failure to obtain\nrelief from each and every defendant. A recovery against more than one of the defendants will not enhance the\namount of the damage award. We hold that when, as here, a plaintiff raises a claim for relief that relates to\nseveral defendants, not all of whom are held liable, the total time expended on the claim for relief should be\ncounted in awarding the plaintiff attorney's fees so long as the defendants from whom plaintiff did not obtain relief\nwere not named frivolously. In these circumstances, the total time expended on the claim can thus be said to\nhave been \"in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved\" of obtaining relief on the claim, 103 S.Ct. at 1940 (quoting \nDavis v. City of Los Angeles, 8 E.P.D. ¶ 9444, at 5049 (C.D.Cal.1974)), and it matters not that the plaintiff was\nunsuccessful as to some of the defendants. The plaintiff will have obtained all the relief sought in connection with\nthe illegal conduct.\nWe have already determined that plaintiff's strip search claim against the individual defendants was not brought\nfrivolously; plaintiff should therefore be compensated by the City for all time expended in litigating the strip search\nclaim, since the plaintiff was completely successful in obtaining relief for the illegal conduct connected with the\n[20]\nclaim.  Services at all stages of the litigation on this claim are compensable, including time expended on the\npetition for mandamus, since that effort was intimately connected with the interlocutory appeal of the new trial\norder on which plaintiff was successful. See Tikalsky v. City of Chicago, Nos. 81-1492, 81-8071 (7th Cir. Nov. 2,\n1981) (Order).\nBecause the district court has a \"superior understanding of the litigation,\" Hensley v. Eckerhart, 103 S.Ct. at\n1941, and can best assess the experience and skill of plaintiff's attorneys, we remand the case to the district\ncourt for recalculation of the award in light of the views expressed above. The determination of the amount of\nreasonable attorney's fees is left to the sound discretion of the district court. We offer but a few more guidelines.\nAs we suggested in Muscare v. Quinn, 614 F.2d 577, 581 (7th Cir.1980), the court might well begin by\ndetermining the number of hours actually worked that were reasonably necessary to the successful claim,\nthereby excluding excessive or redundant time, and then multiplying this figure by a reasonable hourly rate for\neach attorney who worked on the case. The reasonableness of the hourly rate \"should be measured according to\nthe normal rate in the legal community for substantially similar work by competent practitioners.\" McCann v.\n\nCoughlin, 698 F.2d 112, 130 (2d Cir.1983). The resulting amount can then be adjusted according to several\nfactors, see Hensley v. Eckerhart, 103 S.Ct. at 1937 n. 3; Johnson ex rel. Johnson v. Brelje, 701 F.2d 1201, 1212\n(7th Cir.1983), including the experience of the attorneys, the difficulty of the questions presented, the customary\nfee, and whether the fee is fixed or contingent. In particular, Hensley emphasizes that courts must give\nconsiderable attention to \"the relationship between the extent of success and the amount of the fee award,\" 103\n1282 S.Ct. at 1942, especially when the plaintiff has succeeded *1282 on only some of his or her claims. If the trial\ncourt determines that the amount of the fee after the initial calculations is \"unreasonable\" in light of the level of\nsuccess, then it should make an upward or downward adjustment. Finally, the court should provide a clear\nexplanation of its reasons for the amount of the award it grants. Here the district court gave an explanation for\nsome of its findings but failed to discuss others adequately.\nC. Award of Costs to Plaintiff.\nPlaintiff Tikalsky also asserts that the district court abused its discretion in failing to award her certain costs she\n[21]\nrequested.  She requests reimbursement for all of the costs that she incurred pursuant to Rule 54(d),\n[22] [23] [24]\nFed.R.Civ.P.,  and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920 (1976 & Supp. IV 1980)  and 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (1976).\nThese costs are awarded to the prevailing party. Lenard v. Argento, 699 F.2d 874, 900 (7th Cir.),cert. denied,___\nU.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 69, 78 L.Ed.2d 84 (1983). In reviewing the district court's determinations, we are to focus first\non whether the expenses are recoverable \"costs\" and second on whether the costs are reasonable, both in\namount and necessity. Illinois v. Sangamo Construction Co., 657 F.2d 855, 864 (7th Cir.1981). We have observed\nthat \"[o]ur inquiry is much broader with respect to the first question than the second,\" because \"the trial court is in\nthe best position to determine the reasonableness of the cost.\" Id.\nWe believe that each of the expenses the district court denied 00 charges by the official court reporter, certain\n97\nexpenses relating to the depositions of five of the defendants, and exemplification expenses 00 are all recoverable\n97\n\"costs\" under the applicable provisions. See, e.g., Illinois v. Sangamo Construction Co., 657 F.2d at 867; Lenard\nv. Argento, 699 F.2d at 900. However, we are unable to review whether the costs denied were unreasonable\ncosts because the district court failed to make any such findings. The court gave no reasons whatsoever for its\ndecision to deny the costs requested here. However, we need not remand this issue to the district court; after\nexamining all of the facts and after assessing plaintiff's arguments, to which the City did not respond in its brief or\nat oral argument, we believe the costs requested by plaintiff were reasonable and were necessary to plaintiff's\nlitigation of the case. Accordingly, we reverse the determination of the district court denying the costs.\nV. SUMMARY\nThe judgments and damage awards against the City in Nos. 82-1894 (Mary Beth G.), 82-1920 (Sharon N.),\n82-2605 (Tikalsky), and 83-2203 (Hoffman) are affirmed. The judgment in No. 83-1618 (Tikalsky) respecting the\n1283 award of attorney's *1283 fees to the individual defendants is reversed; the judgment in No. 83-1618 (Tikalsky)\nrespecting the award of attorney's fees to plaintiff-appellant is vacated and the case is remanded to the district\ncourt to award plaintiff-appellant reasonable attorney's fees for all time expended in connection with the strip\nsearch claim for relief; the judgment in No. 83-1618 (Tikalsky) denying plaintiff-appellant certain costs is reversed.\nThe City shall bear the costs of these appeals.\n[*] The Honorable Edward R. Neaher, Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, is sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] Prior to this stipulation and agreement, the disclosure of the strip search policy of the City moved the Illinois\nlegislature to amend the Illinois statute governing \"Rights on Arrest\" to prohibit strip searches of persons arrested\nfor traffic, regulatory, or misdemeanor offenses absent a reasonable belief that the arrestee is concealing\nweapons or controlled substances on his or her person. Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, § 103-1(c) (eff. Sept. 2, 1979).\n[2] Mary Beth G. and Sharon N. were stopped for traffic violations; they were arrested and taken to detention\ncenters because there were outstanding parking tickets on their cars. Hinda Hoffman was stopped for making an\n\nimproper left turn and was arrested and taken to the police station when she failed to produce her driver's\nlicense. These plaintiffs-appellees were all members of the proposed plaintiff class in the Jane Does v. City of\nChicago case. The definition of the proposed class was: \nall female persons who were detained by the CPD [Chicago Police Department] for an offense no greater than a\ntraffic violation or a misdemeanor, including all females who were never charged with any offense and who were\nsubjected to a strip search in situations where there was no reason to believe that weapons or contraband had\nbeen concealed on or in their bodies. (R. 1, pp. 2-3).\nThe district court found that the class met the requirements for certification under Rule 23(b)(2) but not 23(b)(3),\nFed.R.Civ.P. 23. Therefore, the damages issue did not proceed as a class action, but rather by individual trials for\ndamages. (R. 44).\nPlaintiff-appellee Tikalsky was arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct, which was subsequently dismissed,\nand brought to the women's lockup at the police station.\n[3] The specific facts surrounding the searches of each plaintiff-appellee vary. Each woman, however, was\nsubjected to a strip search that included the admitted procedures of the official City policy.\n[4] In the description of the policy given by the City, the City claims that all searches were conducted in a closed\nroom away from the view of all persons except the person conducting the search. Defendant's Brief (Tikalsky) at\n14. This portion of the description was variously contradicted by the testimony of plaintiffs-appellees. We need\nnot consider these additional allegations, however, because we believe the policy even as described is\nunconstitutional for the reasons we explain.\n[5] Section 18 of the Bill of Rights of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 (Ill. Const. (1970), art. I, sec. 18) provides: \nThe equal protection of the laws shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex by the State or its units of\nlocal government and school districts.\n[6] Commentators have recognized that the \"reasonableness\" requirement extends to both the scope and the\nintensity of the search. See generally Shuldiner, Visual Rape: A Look at the Dubious Legality of Strip Searches,\n13 J.Mar.L.Rev. 273 (1980); Dix, Means of Executing Searches and Seizures as Fourth Amendment Issues, 67\nMinn.L.Rev. 89 (1982).\n[7] Another case cited by the City, United States v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296 (1st Cir.1975), in which a visual rectal\nsearch conducted incident to arrest was found to be constitutional, is also distinguishable. In Klein, the arrestee\nwas arrested for distribution of cocaine. We have previously upheld such searches conducted under similar\ncircumstances, Salinas v. Breier, 695 F.2d 1073 (7th Cir.1982) (limited strip search and visual inspection\nconducted incident to valid arrest is permissible when there is probable cause to believe the arrestee is hiding a\ncontrolled substance on his or her person), and the district court in the Jane Does cases specifically noted in\ndictum that such circumstances would provide reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a strip search and visual\ninspection, Jane Does v. City of Chicago, No. 79 C 789, slip op. at 8 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 12, 1982). In the cases here,\nhowever, plaintiffs-appellees are only misdemeanor offenders and there was no reasonable belief that any of\nthem were secreting contraband on their persons.\n[8] The majority in Wolfish indicated that strip searches conducted after contact visits could serve as an effective\ndeterrent to the importation of weapons or contraband. No deterrence effect could have resulted from the strip\nsearch policy of the City, however, because none of the women were aware that such a policy even existed.\n[9] The survey does not detail in which body orifice the items found were concealed.\n[10] The decisional literature readily confirms this fact. See, e.g., United States v. Park, 521 F.2d 1381 (9th\nCir.1975); Daugherty v. Harris, 476 F.2d 292 (10th Cir.),cert. denied,414 U.S. 872, 94 S.Ct. 112, 38 L.Ed.2d 91\n(1973); Huguez v. United States, 406 F.2d 366 (9th Cir.1968); Hodges v. Klein, 412 F.Supp. 896 (D.N.J.1976).\n[11]Compare Susan B. v. City of Chicago, 83 C 228 (N.D.Ill. Nov. 16, 1983) ($15,000 verdict); Stella S. v. City of\nChicago, 82 C 1912 (N.D.Ill. Dec. 23, 1983) ($15,000 verdict) with Levka v. City of Chicago, 83 C 2283 (N.D.Ill.\n\nNov. 21, 1983) ($50,000 verdict). See also Sala v. County of Suffolk, 75 C 486 (E.D.N.Y. Judgment Order of Feb.\n1981) ($25,000 settlement); Saunders v. City of Orlando, 78-6682 (9th Jud.Cir., Orange Cty., Fla., Oct. 1980)\n($50,000 jury award for strip search and false arrest); Harrison v. County of El Paso, EP 82 CA 57 (El Paso,\nTexas 1983) ($112,500 settlement).\n[12] The Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976 provides in relevant part: \nIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1986 of this title, ... the\ncourt, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as\npart of the costs.\n42 U.S.C. § 1988 (1976).\n[13] Plaintiff's request was presented as follows: \nEdward T. Stein    (270.80 hrs. x $125/hr.)   $ 33,850.00\nCecile Singer      ( 12.50 hrs. x $125/hr.)      1,562.50\nMary Rita Luecke   (542.40 hrs. x $100/hr.)     54,240.00\nSusan Kaplan       ( 37.05 hrs. x $100/hr.)      3,705.00\nJames Strnal       ( 43.55 hrs. x $100/hr.)      4,355.00\n                                              ___________\n                                  Subtotal    $ 97,712.50\n                            50% Multiplier         x 1.50\n                                              ___________\n   Total Fees Plus Multiplier Requested       $146,568.75\n[14] By specifically approving an award of attorney's fees for time spent litigating unsuccessful claims for relief\nthat are related to successful claims, Hensley implicitly rejects our opinion in Lenard v. Argento that \"attorney's\nfees should be awarded only for the preparation and presentation of claims on which the plaintiff has prevailed.\" \n699 F.2d at 899.\n[15] This bifurcated approach reflects the two-part nature of a \"claim,\" which, under the Federal Rules, is\ngenerally understood to comprise \"the aggregate of operative facts which give [sic] rise to a right enforceable in\nthe court.\" Original Ballet Russe, Ltd. v. Ballet Theatre, Inc., 133 F.2d 187, 189 (2d Cir.1943). We recognize,\nhowever, that the way courts have used the term \"claim\" in the attorney's fees context has been less precise than\nin other areas of the law. Compare Hensley v. Eckerhart, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941, 76 L.Ed.2d 40\n(1983) (\"[H]ad respondents prevailed on only one of their six general claims, for example the claim that\npetitioners' visitation, mail, and telephone policies were overly restrictive, ... a fee award based on the claimed\nhours would have been excessive.\") with Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 24 comment a (1982) (\"`Claim'\nin the context of res judicata has never been broader than the transaction to which it related.... The present trend\nis to see claim in factual terms and to make it coterminous with the transaction regardless of the number of\nsubstantive theories, or variant forms of relief flowing from those theories, that may be available to the\nplaintiff....\"). \n\"Claims\" in the attorney's fees context are often loosely defined in terms of grounds or theories of recovery or in\nterms of particular \"wrongs\" bottomed on the same legal theory. Whichever definition is adopted, however, we\nnote that Hensley's emphasis on \"claim for relief\" (emphasis added), suggests a useful method for determining\nthe \"relatedness\" of claims. This method we describe in the text.\n[16] Plaintiff maintains that some hours relating to the false arrest claim should be considered in awarding\nattorney's fees. Plaintiff argues that if the arrest had been found illegal, the search could be considered an\nelement of damages flowing from it. Brief of Plaintiff-Appellant (Tikalsky) at 33 n. 24. \nWe agree with the general proposition plaintiff advances. Plaintiff is not advocating that hours relating solely to\nthe false arrest claim be considered, but only time that relates to both the false arrest and strip search claims.\n\"[A]n award of attorney's fees may include `time spent on unsuccessful claims to the extent such time would have\n\nbeen spent in connection with the successful claims even if the unsuccessful claims had not been brought.'\" \nJohnson ex rel. Johnson v. Brelje, 701 F.2d 1201, 1211 (7th Cir.1983) (quoting Busche v. Burkee, 649 F.2d 509,\n521 (7th Cir.),cert. denied,454 U.S. 897, 102 S.Ct. 396, 70 L.Ed.2d 212 (1981)). Consequently, any time spent\non assessing and proving the emotional and mental trauma suffered by plaintiff as a result of the strip search, so\nlong as the hours relate to plaintiff's successful strip search claim against the City and are not excessive or\nduplicative, should be considered in assessing attorney's fees for time spent on that claim. This includes time\nspent researching damages relating to the strip search that was expended before the complaint was amended to\ninclude the strip search claim. Johnston v. Jago, 691 F.2d 283, 287-88 (6th Cir.1982).\n[17] The unsuccessful claims here are unlike those in Hensley, in which the Court, while apparently adopting a\nnarrow view of \"claim,\" see103 S.Ct. at 1941, appeared to conclude that the unsuccessful claims were \"related\"\nto the successful claims, id. All the successful and unsuccessful claims in Hensley challenged the constitutionality\nof treatment and conditions at a state hospital housing persons involuntarily committed who were considered\ndangerous to themselves and to others. Id. at 1936 & n. 1. Although the specific facts underlying each claim\nvaried according to the discrete deprivation alleged, id., the claims were related because the plaintiffs pursued\nthem to remedy the same general injurious course of conduct, i.e., the denial of minimally adequate treatment.\n[18]See supra note 15.\n[19]See supra note 15.\n[20]Hensley instructs that if the plaintiff \"has obtained excellent results, his attorney should recover a fully\ncompensatory fee.\" 103 S.Ct. at 1940.\n[21] The following list summarizes the costs requested, allowed, and disallowed: \nDescription of Cost         Requested   Allowed  Disallowed\n1.
