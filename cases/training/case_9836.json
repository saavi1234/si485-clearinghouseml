Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, requested damages, alleging false arrest, unconstitutional search, and denial of due process.</p><p>On May 8, 1997, Defendant Officer arrested Plaintiff on an outstanding warrant for a traffic violation and took her to the Second Precinct.  Plaintiff alleged Defendant Court Clerk failed to carry out her duties because Plaintiff was arrested pursuant to a warrant that had been recalled on October 9, 1996, but had remained in the active warrant list.  At the precinct, Defendant Officer searched Plaintiff.  Plaintiff was asked to remove her clothing and reposition her underwear.  Plaintiff alleged she was searched at the Fourth Precinct and the Central Islip courthouse but Plaintiff did not identify the officers who conducted these searches.  Plaintiff alleged the officer searched her without reasonable suspicion that she concealed contraband.  Plaintiff alleged the County was liable because the searches were performed pursuant to County policy.</p><p>The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on August 7, 2000.</p><p>On December 20, 2000, the District Court (Judge Leonard D. Wexler) granted summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiff's false arrest and due process violation claims.  The Court granted summary judgment to Plaintiff as to the illegality of her search.  The Court held: (1) mistaken arrest on recalled warrant was not due process violation because a County employee must have been deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's rights in order to be a Constitutional violation, rather than a mistake; (2) arresting officer had qualified immunity against false arrest claim because the officer acted pursuant to an arrest warrant; but (3) partial strip search violated Fourth Amendment, since neither nature of offense nor circumstances of arrest created suspicion that would justify the search. The Court left for trial issues of damages on strip-search, qualified immunity and municipal liability.  The Court did not have sufficient information to decide whether the search was conducted pursuant to County policy.  Mason v. Village of Babylon, 124 F.Supp.2d 807 (E.D.N.Y. 2000).</p><p>On November 30, 2001, the parties filed a stipulation of discontinuance, dismissing the case without costs or attorney's fees to either party.

Zwilling, Hauppauge, NY, for Defendants Laurie Ann\nMcManus and County of Suffolk.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nWEXLER, District Judge.\nThis is a civil rights lawsuit commenced by Plaintiff Renee Mason (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Mason\") alleging claims sounding\nin denial of due process, false arrest and unconstitutional search. Named as defendants are the Village of\nBabylon (\"Babylon\" or the \"Village\"), Elizabeth Meyer, Court Clerk of the Babylon Village Court, Suffolk County\n[1]\nPolice Officer Laurie Ann McManus (\"McManus\") and the County of Suffolk (collectively \"Defendants\").\nPlaintiff's claim arises out of her arrest pursuant to a warrant that had been recalled but remained on the active\nwarrant list. Presently before the court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons that\nfollow the defense motion to dismiss the claims alleging false arrest and due process violations are granted.\nPlaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to the illegality of the search is granted. The parties will proceed to\ntrial on the issue of damages attributable to this claim as well as the issues of qualified immunity and municipal\nliability.\nBACKGROUND\nI. Factual Background\nThe facts forming the basis of Plaintiff's claims are set forth in Plaintiff's complaint and have been amplified by the\ndeposition testimony taken prior to the making of the motions presently before the court.\nA. Plaintiff's Arrest and the Warrant\nOn May 8, 1997, Plaintiff was traveling in her car and was pulled over by defendant Police Officer Laurie\nMcManus. Once Plaintiff was pulled over, McManus communicated with a police dispatcher and was informed\n\nthat there was an outstanding warrant for Plaintiff's arrest. Upon learning of the warrant, McManus took Plaintiff\ninto custody and transported her to the Second Precinct. According to McManus, the arrest was mandatory once\nthe warrant was discovered.\nMcManus testified that shortly after the arrest she became aware that the warrant upon which the arrest was\neffected was issued for failure to pay a fine issued in connection with a violation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law,\nspecifically, a broken tail light. Upon the arrest, McManus told Mason that she was being brought to the precinct\nfor traffic violations. McManus testified that at the time of the arrest Mason posed no threat of bodily harm. She\nfurther testified that she looked into Mason's car and neither saw nor smelled anything that might be contraband.\nFinally, she testified that she placed Mason under arrest with no difficulty.\nAs events unfolded it became clear that the warrant upon which Plaintiff was arrested, which had been issued by\nthe Village Court for the Town of Babylon in October of 1996, had been recalled and was not in effect at the time\nof the arrest. The recall of the warrant, however, was not known to Officer McManus who relied solely on the\n811 information communicated to *811 her when informing the police dispatcher of Mason's identity.\nThe circumstances and procedures governing the recall of warrants in general, and the warrant in this case in\nparticular, were reviewed at the deposition of Defendant Meyer, the Babylon Village Court Clerk. Meyer testified\nthat if an individual came to court to pay an unpaid fine that had resulted in the issuance of a warrant, it was\nMeyer's practice to give the person a receipt indicating that payment had been made. Meyer further stated that\nonce payment was received, she would telephone the Warrant Control Department of Suffolk County (\"Warrant\nControl\") and ask that they recall the warrant.\nMeyer explained at her deposition that it was the procedure of her office to place a \"warrant recalled\" stamp on\nthe copy of the warrant retained at the Babylon Village Court after the telephone call recalling the warrant was\nmade to Warrant Control. The stamp on the warrant at issue here indicated that it had been recalled on October\n9, 1996 00 seven months prior to Plaintiff's arrest. That stamp also indicated that the Babylon Village employee\n97\nwho made the call regarding Mason's warrant spoke to a woman named \"Iris\" at Warrant Control.\nDespite the fact that the stamping of the warrant indicates that Warrant Control was, indeed, called, with respect\nto the warrant for Plaintiff's arrest, it is clear that the warrant was not cancelled, but remained active. This must\nhave been so because Officer McManus was informed that the warrant was active when she pulled over Mason\nin 1997. Obviously, some mistake was made with respect to the recall of the warrant. Meyer testified that in the\nseven years that she had been with the Babylon Village Court, this case was the first time she became aware\nthat a warrant that was requested to be recalled remained active.\nB. The Search of Plaintiff While in Police Custody\nUpon her arrest, Mason was transported to the Second Precinct. Mason testified as to the following events that\ntranspired there. Upon her arrival at the precinct, Mason told McManus that she wanted to use the bathroom.\nMcManus escorted Mason to the bathroom and conducted a search of Mason prior to allowing her to use the\nfacilities. While the search performed is referred to in Plaintiff's complaint as a \"strip search,\" Plaintiff's deposition\ntestimony makes clear that the search conducted by McManus, as described below, was not a search where\nPlaintiff was required to remove all of her clothes. Plaintiff was, however, subject to a search aimed at uncovering\ncontraband that may have been concealed in her undergarments.\nUpon entering the bathroom, in the presence only of McManus, Plaintiff was frisked and patted down. She was\nasked to raise her shirt and expose her bra. She was asked to pull out, but not remove, her bra, so as to dislodge\nanything that might be hidden therein. Plaintiff was also asked to lower her pants to her thighs. She was not\nasked to remover her underwear, but to reposition it; again to dislodge anything that might have been concealed.\nPlaintiff was subject to a visual inspection only of the areas she was asked to expose; she was not touched and\nwas patted down only on areas of her body that were covered with clothes.\nPlaintiff's complaint alleges that on the night of her arrest she was transferred from the Second Precinct to the\nFourth Precinct and held there in a detention area. Plaintiff's complaint alleges that she was subject to \"strip\n\nsearches\" upon her arrival at the Fourth Precinct and later, upon her arrival at the Central Islip court-house.\nThese searches, however, were not conducted by Defendant McManus and Plaintiff has never identified the\n812 individuals who allegedly conducted these searches. Plaintiff's testimony indicates, *812 however, that the search\nconducted at the Fourth Precinct was similar to the search conducted at the Second Precinct. It appears that the\nsearch conducted at the Central Islip courthouse was limited to a \"pat down\" search.\nII. Plaintiffs' Complaint\nPlaintiff's complaint states a cause of action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. While not clearly articulated, Plaintiff's\ncivil rights claims sound in: (1) a violation of due process (asserted against Babylon and Meyers and stemming\nfrom alleged deficiencies in the warrant recall procedure); (2) false arrest (asserted against McManus and Suffolk\nCounty stemming from her arrest on the recalled warrant) and (3) unreasonable search (asserted against\nMcManus and Suffolk County based upon the search performed before Plaintiff was permitted to use the\nbathroom at the Second Precinct).\nPlaintiff's claims against Babylon and Meyer assert that actions taken with respect to the recall of the warrant\nwere \"careless, negligent, reckless\" and that Meyer failed to carry out her duties \"to such a degree of care which\na reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.\" Although not\nspecifically set forth in the complaint, Plaintiff appears to argue that the procedures in place at the Babylon\nVillage Court failed to comply with the requirements of due process.\nPlaintiff's false arrest claim argues that because the warrant upon which she was arrested had been recalled,\nthere was no probable cause to effect the arrest. Plaintiff's unreasonable search claim alleges that Officer\nMcManus and the County are liable for subjecting Plaintiff to intrusive searches where there was neither probable\ncause nor reasonable suspicion to believe that Plaintiff was concealing contraband. The County of Suffolk is\nsought to be held liable on the theory that the searches were performed pursuant to official County policy.\nIII. The Motions for Summary Judgment\nAll Defendants move for summary judgment. The Village and Meyer allege that Plaintiff can show nothing more\nthan negligence, at best, in the warrant recall procedure and that such conduct cannot form the basis of a due\nprocess violation. The County and Officer McManus seek judgment on the false arrest claim on the ground that\nno such claim is stated where, as here, the arrest is effected pursuant to a warrant that appeared to be valid to\nthe arresting officer. Finally, the County and Officer McManus seek judgment on the unreasonable search claim\non the ground that the searches were not unconstitutional. McManus argues that even assuming the illegality of\nthe search that she performed, she is entitled to qualified immunity and dismissal of the claim. Setting forth the\nopposite arguments, Plaintiff moves for summary judgment in her favor.\nDISCUSSION\nI. General Legal Principles\nA. Summary Judgment Standards\nTo obtain summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the party seeking\nsummary judgment must demonstrate that \"there is no genuine issue of any material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Donahue v. Windsor Locks Bd. of Fire Comm'rs, 834 F.2d 54, 57 (2d\nCir.1987).\n\nB. Municipal Liability\nTo establish the liability of entities such as the Village of Babylon and the County of Suffolk, Plaintiff must show\nthat \"deliberate action attributable to the municipality itself is the `moving force' behind the plaintiff's deprivation of\n813 federal *813 rights.\" Board of County Commissioners of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 400, 117 S.Ct.\n1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997), quoting, Monell v. Dep't of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56\nL.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Thus, Plaintiff must show that municipal action was taken with \"the requisite degree of\nculpability and must demonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal\nrights.\" Id. at 404, 117 S.Ct. 1382.\nWhere a plaintiff claims that the municipality has caused an employee to make decisions depriving plaintiff of his\nConstitutional rights, \"rigorous standards of culpability and causation must be applied\" to ensure that liability is\nnot imposed simply upon a respondeat superior theory. Brown, 520 U.S. at 415, 117 S.Ct. 1382. Inadequate\ntraining of municipal employees may form the basis of municipal liability in limited circumstances such as the\nexistence of an insufficient training program that applies over time to multiple employees. Continuing adherence\nto an approach that consistently results in unconstitutional acts by employees may establish such deliberate\nindifference as to trigger municipal liability. On the other hand, proof only of a one-time negligent administration of\na program cannot be relied upon to establish municipal liability. Id. at 407-08, 117 S.Ct. 1382.\nC. Qualified Immunity\nThe doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability. \nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Such officials are immune from\nliability if their conduct does not violate clearly established constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\nwould have known and/or it was objectively reasonable for the official to believe that this was the case. Anderson\nv. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). The objective reasonableness standard was\nestablished to \"permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims on summary judgment.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); see Mozzochi v. Borden, 959 F.2d 1174, 1177 (2d\nCir.1992).\nA law enforcement officer seeking summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity bears the burden of\nproving that it was \"objectively reasonable\" for the defendant to believe that his behavior did not violate plaintiff's\nclearly established constitutional rights. Lennon v. Miller, 66 F.3d 416, 418 (2d Cir.1995) (quoting, Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)). Objective reasonableness is established\nwhere \"officers of reasonable competence could disagree as to the legality of the defendant's actions.\" Malley v.\nBriggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986). An officer's actions will be found objectively\nunreasonable, and summary judgment will be denied only if \"no officer of reasonable competence could have\nmade the same choice in similar circumstances.\" Lennon, 66 F.3d at 420-21; see, e.g., Santiago v. Semenza,\n965 F.Supp. 468, 473 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (granting summary judgment on ground of qualified immunity on excessive\nforce claim); Steiner v. New York, 920 F.Supp. 333, 339 (E.D.N.Y.1996) (granting summary judgment on claim of\nlack of probable cause to arrest).\nA defendant seeking summary judgment need not show that all reasonable police officers would have acted\nsimilarly under the circumstances presented, but only that reasonable officers might disagree as to the legality of\nthe defendant's conduct under the circumstances. If this court determines that the only conclusion that a rational\njury could reach is that reasonable officers might differ as to the propriety of defendant's conduct, summary\njudgment should be granted. Lowth v. Town of Cheektowaga, 82 F.3d 563, 569 (2d Cir. 1996); Steiner, 920\nF.Supp. at 338.\n814  II. Disposition of the Motions\n*814\nA. Due Process Claims Against Babylon and Meyer\n\n1. Elements of the Claim\nDue process has both a procedural and substantive component. Procedural due process requirements are\ngenerally satisfied by appropriate notice and an opportunity to be heard. See Natale v. Town of Ridgefield, 170\nF.3d 258, 262 (2d Cir.1999). Procedures in place \"must be reasonable and responsive to the particular situation\nat hand.\" Dillon v. Boyce, 1995 WL 116476 *3 (E.D.N.Y.1995), citing, Toure v. United States, 24 F.3d 444, 445 (2d\nCir.1994). Substantive due process, on the other hand, refers not to particular hearing procedures, but\ncircumscribes an \"outer limit\" on permissible governmental action. Natale, 170 F.3d at 263. Substantive due\nprocess rights are violated only by conduct \"so outrageously arbitrary as to constitute a gross abuse of\ngovernmental authority.\" Natale, 170 F.3d at 263.\n2. Disposition\nPlaintiff's claims against Babylon and Meyer allege negligent and reckless procedures in connection with the\nrecall of outstanding warrants. While Plaintiff may find some fault with the existing procedures and, indeed, may\nhave some valid suggestions as to how to improve those procedures, she can point to no facts supporting the\nnotion that the procedure was so recklessly applied or so deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's rights as to\nconstitute a violation of the Constitution. In view of Myers' testimony that in the seven years she had been with\nthe Village court, the system in place failed on only this single occasion, there is no evidence of an ongoing\nunconstitutional practice.\nAt best, Plaintiff has shown a possibility either that a Babylon Village Court employee (not necessarily Meyers)\nfailed to call the appropriate individual at Suffolk County warrant control or that some mistake was made at the\nCounty level in failing to properly recall the warrant. Such facts are plainly insufficient to constitute a violation of\nPlaintiff's Constitutional rights. Accordingly, the court grants summary judgment to the Village of Babylon and\nMeyers on any claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. To the extent that Plaintiff has any state law claims against\nthese defendants, the court declines to exercise pendent jurisdiction over such claims.\nB. False Arrest Claim\n1. Elements of the Claim\nThe elements of a federal civil rights claim based upon an allegation of false arrest are the same as the elements\nof a false arrest claim under New York law. See Weyant v. Okst, 101 F.3d 845, 852 (2d Cir.1996); Jenkins v. City\nof New York, 1999 WL 782509 * 8 (S.D.N.Y. September 30, 1999), aff'd, 216 F.3d 1072 (2d Cir.2000). The\nelements of such a claim are: (1) defendant had intended to confine the plaintiff; (2) the plaintiff was conscious of\nthe confinement; (3) the plaintiff did not consent to the confinement and (4) the confinement was not otherwise\nprivileged. Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, 63 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir.1995); see Weyant, 101 F.3d at 853.\nA showing of probable cause to arrest defeats the claim, whether brought pursuant to State or Federal law. \nSinger, 63 F.3d at 118; Tucker v. Gross, 39 F.Supp.2d 244, 249-50 (E.D.N.Y.1999). Thus, to prevail on a claim for\nfalse arrest, plaintiff must demonstrate the absence of probable cause to arrest. Labensky v. County of Nassau, 6\nF.Supp.2d 161, 176 (E.D.N.Y.1998), citing Zanghi v. Incorporated Village of Old Brookville., 752 F.2d 42, 45 (2d\nCir.1985),aff'd, 173 F.3d 845 (2d Cir.1999). Probable cause to arrest exists where officers have knowledge of, or\nreasonably trustworthy information about, facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant a reasonable belief that\nan offense has been or is being committed. Steiner, 920 F.Supp. at 338.\n815 *815 Where an arrest is effected pursuant to an arrest warrant, a presumption of probable cause is created. \nGolino v. City of New Haven, 950 F.2d 864, 870 (2d Cir.1991); Jenkins v. City of New York, 1999 WL 782509 * 8\n(S.D.N.Y. September 30, 1999), aff'd, 216 F.3d 1072 (2d Cir.2000); Hibbard v. Gallivan, 1999 WL 782174 *1\n(W.D.N.Y. September 15, 1999). That presumption is defeated only if a plaintiff can show that the arresting officer\n\"knowingly, intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth,\" made a false statement upon which the officer\n\nissuing the warrant relied. Id. In the face of a valid warrant where there is no showing of fraud, misrepresentation\nor falsification of evidence, there is no claim for false arrest, either under New York law or as a matter of Federal\nCivil Rights. Martinetti v. Town of New Hartford Police Department, 112 F.Supp.2d 251, 252 (N.D.N.Y.2000); \nCoakley v. Jaffe, 72 F.Supp.2d 362, 364 (S.D.N.Y.1999),aff'd., 2000 WL 1552258 (2d Cir.2000).\nAn arresting officer is entitled to qualified immunity from a claim of false arrest if it was either: (1) objectively\nreasonable for him to believe that probable cause existed or (2) reasonably competent officers could disagree as\nto the existence of probable cause. McSween v. Edwards, 91 F.Supp.2d 513, 522 (E.D.N.Y.2000), quoting, \nGolino, 950 F.2d at 870.\n2. Disposition of the Claim\nAlthough the warrant upon which Plaintiff was arrested was recalled prior to the arrest, that fact was not known to\nOfficer McManus on the night of Mason's arrest. Indeed, the only information available to the arresting officer at\nthe time of the arrest was communicated to her by the police dispatcher who informed McManus that there was\nan active warrant for the arrest of Mason. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for McManus to take\nMason into custody.\nIt matters not that the warrant was for a minor offense. An outstanding warrant required the action taken by\nMcManus. Even assuming that Mason protested the validity of the warrant at the time of the arrest makes no\ndifference. At the very least, McManus is clearly entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest claim. McManus\nwas informed of an outstanding warrant and acted thereupon. She was under no obligation to do otherwise and it\ncannot be said that no reasonable officer would have made the same choice under the same circumstances. See\nLennon, 66 F.3d at 420-21. Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the claim of false arrest is granted.\nC. Unreasonable Search Claim\n1. Elements of the Claim\nThe Constitution requires that searches of individuals, even those arrested or incarcerated, be reasonable under\nthe circumstances. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). The\nreasonableness of any given search is determined by balancing the need for the search against the \"invasion of\nthe personal rights that the search entails.\" Id.\nIt is the clear law in this circuit that the Fourth Amendment precludes prison officials from performing strip\nsearches of arrestees charged with misdemeanor or minor offenses absent a reasonable suspicion that the\nperson being searched is concealing weapons or other contraband. Shain v. Ellison, 53 F.Supp.2d 564, 566\n(E.D.N.Y.1999). See Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir. 1986),cert. denied,483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct.\n3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987); see also Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 69-70 (2d Cir.1988).\nIn Weber and Walsh, the Second Circuit made clear that strip searches may be justified only by focusing on the\nparticular arrest 00 whether it be the nature the crime charged or the circumstances surrounding the arrest 00 and\n97 97\n816 not on factors *816 relating to the correctional facility. The Second Circuit has specifically rejected the argument\nthat the mixing of arrestees along with the general jail population justifies a blanket strip search policy. Thus, it\nhas been held that \"the risk of a misdemeanor arrestee's introducing contraband into the general jail population\nsimply did not warrant a strip search of all arrestees ....\" Walsh, 849 F.2d at 69.\nAs the foregoing makes clear, any policy authorizing blanket strip searches of inmates charged with\nmisdemeanors, without regard to the nature of the crime charged or any other fact regarding a reasonable\nsuspicion of concealed contraband, is unconstitutional. Wachtler v. County of Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77, 81 (2d\nCir.1994), quoting, Weber, 804 F.2d at 802. A county that is found to have such a policy will be liable for a\nconstitutional violation and, by virtue of the fact that it is a county, cannot claim any defense of qualified immunity.\nSee Wachtler, 35 F.3d at 82, citing, Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 638, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63\nL.Ed.2d 673 (1980). Moreover, the unconstitutionality of a blanket strip search policy is so well established that,\n\nabsent a finding of reasonable suspicion, the individual or officer carrying out the policy is not entitled to a\nqualified immunity defense. Weber, 804 F.2d at 803.\nWhile the search at issue here was not a full strip search, the principles of reasonableness under the\ncircumstances are equally applicable. Ultimately, the court must apply the Wolfish standards and determine\nwhether the nature of the search is balanced by its need. In making this determination, the court considers the\ncrime charged and the facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest, as well as the scope of the search, the\nmanner in which it is conducted, and the place where the search is conducted. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct.\n1861.\nAt least one court in this circuit has held that the constitutionality of a no-contact strip search, similar to the\nsearch at issue here, was enough of an open question to afford the arresting officer qualified immunity. See \nLopez v. City of New York, 901 F.Supp. 684, 693 (S.D.N.Y.1995). That court also held, however, that the\nmunicipality enforcing the policy was not entitled to summary judgment dismissing the claim and, indeed, might\nbe held liable for a Fourth Amendment violation after consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding\nthe search at issue. Id.\n2. Disposition of the Claim\nThe deposition testimony cited above makes clear that Plaintiff was not subject to a full strip search. Instead, she\nwas asked to lift her shirt, lower her pants and, as put by the County, \"rearrange her undergarments.\" The County\nmakes much of this distinction, arguing that it leads to the inescapable conclusion that the search did not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment. The court disagrees.\nWhen seeking to justify the search at issue, the County fails to engage in the reasonableness inquiry and the\nbalancing required by the Supreme Court of the United States and the Second Circuit. As noted, this approach\nrequires consideration of the crime charged and the facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest as well as\nthe scope of the search, the manner in which it is conducted, and the place where the search is conducted. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861.\nPlaintiff here was arrested on an outstanding warrant for a traffic violation. Clearly, the nature of crime charged\ncannot be relied upon to raise any suspicion whatever that Plaintiff was concealing contraband sufficient to justify\na search of her undergarments. Nor can the search be justified by reference to any facts or circumstances\nsurrounding Plaintiffs arrest. Officer McManus testified regarding no conduct that led to any suspicion,\nreasonable or otherwise, that Plaintiff was concealing contraband either on her person or in her car. While they\n817 would probably be *817 insufficient in any event, the County has not tried to justify the search conducted based\nupon any institutional concern. In short, the court finds absolutely no facts to justify the intrusive, albeit not full\n\"strip,\" search conducted. Under the circumstances here, the search of Plaintiff violated the Fourth Amendment.\nFinding that the search failed to comport with the reasonableness requirements of the Fourth Amendment does\nnot, however, end the matter. The court must consider whether Officer McManus is entitled to qualified immunity.\nAdditionally, the court must consider whether the search was conducted pursuant to a custom or policy of the\nCounty sufficient to justify the imposition of liability pursuant to Monell v. Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658,\n694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).\nThe court concludes that the record is insufficient to decide these issues. The parties have submitted neither\ndocuments nor testimony indicating the County policy, at the time of Mason's arrest, regarding searches of\nindividuals taken into custody. While there is testimony that McManus was acting pursuant to \"standard\nprocedure,\" the basis for this characterization is unclear. Rather than decide the remaining issues of immunity\nand municipal liability on the basis of this insufficient record, the court reserves decision on these matters for trial.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, The court grants the defense motion for summary judgment regarding the claim\nof false arrest and dismisses this claim as against all defendants. Additionally, all claims against the Village of\nBabylon and Elizabeth Meyers are dismissed. These defendants are no longer a part of this case.\nThe court holds, as a matter of law, that the search conducted upon Plaintiff violated the Fourth Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution. The court reserves for trial of this matter the issues of damages, qualified\nimmunity and municipal liability.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Also named as defendants are \"Jane\" and \"John Doe,\" described, respectively, as a matron of Suffolk County\nand a Suffolk County Corrections Officer. Discovery is closed in this matter and Plaintiff has made no effort to\nidentify these defendants. More importantly, however, the statute of limitations has run on Plaintiff's claims (which\naccrued more than three years ago). Accordingly, even if Plaintiff could identify additional defendants, it is now\ntoo late to amend her complaint to assert causes of action against any additional parties. Such claims are\ntherefore, sua sponte, dismissed. Tapia-Ortiz v. Doe, 171 F.3d 150, 151-52 (2d Cir.1999); Fulton v. Litwin, 2000\nWL 1159319 *4 (E.D.N.Y.
