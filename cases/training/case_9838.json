    "summary": "<p>On September 24, 2002, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit under K.S.A. 22-2521, K.S.A. 22-2522, and K.S.A. 22-2523 against the City of Lawrence and Lawrence police officers in the Douglas District Court. Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked for actual damages and costs, alleging that Lawrence police officers illegally subjected him to a strip and body cavity search.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, Plaintiff alleged that on June 9, 1999, Lawrence police officers arrested him and put him in the back of a patrol car. Plaintiff alleged he was then removed from the car, ordered to remove his clothing and lie in a body bag, and the officer used a vacuum to vacuum and touch his genitals and buttocks. Plaintiff alleged his strip search violated Kansas law because the strip search was conducted so that others could observe it and the officers did not write a report of the strip search. Furthermore, Plaintiff alleged his body cavity search was conducted without a warrant specifically authorizing a body cavity search and the search was not conducted by a doctor or nurse.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In May 2003, the Douglas District Court (Judge Robert W. Fairchild) dismissed suit on statute of limitations grounds. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\r\n<p>On May 14, 2004, the Court of Appeals of Kansas (Judges G. Joseph Pierron, Jr., Christel E. Marquardt, and Henry W. Green, Jr.) affirmed. The Court held that the suit was outside the statute of limitations because Plaintiff's claims existed under common law and were not created by statute. McCormick v. City of Lawrence, 89 P.3d 657 (Kan. Ct. App. 2004).</p>\r\n<p>On January 21, 2005, the Supreme Court of Kansas (Justices Marla J. Luckert and Robert L. Gernon and Judge Edward Larson) reversed the judgments of the Court of Appeals and District Court and held that Plaintiff's complaint was within the statute of limitations that applies when a statute creates a new, substantive right not recognized at common law. Plaintiff's claim that police violated state law was different from a 4th Amendment 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 claim because a strip-search could violate state law without being unreasonable under the 4th Amendment. Furthermore, the state statutes created substantive rights not recognized at common law that strip-searches must be conducted in private and body-cavity searches must be performed by a licensed health care provider. McCormick v. City of Lawrence, 104 P.3d 991 (Kan. 2005).</p>",

SEC. 1983\nCOlVIPLAINT\n1~    Plaintiffs are natural persons and civil rights advocates who reside at 1001 Columbine\nCourt, Lawrence, Kansas (66049).\n2. Mark Knight is an individual person and resident of Kansas who acted under color of law at\nall times material hereto, as an assistant district attorney, in an investigative capacity thereof\nand/or in the c~apacity of a eomplaimml; but never having \"probable cause\" for his actions and so\nnever acting as an \"advocate for the State\" at any time material hereto. All remaining individual\ndefendants arc individual persons and residents of Douglas County, Kansas, who acted under\ncolor of state or local law at all times material hereto, being employed as police officers of the\nCity of Lawrence, Kansas, Police Dept. at all times during the same. The City of Lawrence, Ks.,\nis a Kansas municipal corporation, and is a ’~person\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. See. 1983.\n3. This action arises under the United States Constitution, particulmly under the First, Fourth,\nFitih and Fourteenth Amendments to such Constitution, and pursuant to the statutory law of the\nUnited States, particularly Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1988.\n4. The claims made and remedies sought herein are juristic to this Court pursuant to Title 28\nU.S.C. Soc. 1331 and Scc. 1343, and by the common law oft.he United States and the State of\n\nBACKGROUND FACTS\nPla~tiffs are civil rights activists and aifics of the pcacfices and policies of the contemporary\n’law-enforcement growth industry.’\nBetween 8/18/01 and 7/13/02 plaiutiff McCormick (plaintiff) verbally protested police activity\nand/or recorded police activity with audio or video recording devices in Lawrence, Ks., on\napproximately 50 occasions, almost always from a public sidewalk. On approximately 25 of\nthese occasions plaintiff made his presence known to Lawrence police officers by criticizing or\nverbally challenging Lawrence police officers from a public sidewalk, pursuant to Houston v.\nHill, 482 U.S. 451. In general, at least 20 times, Lawrence police officers have retaliated\nagainst plaintiff’s verbal challenges and criticism by threatening to plaintiff McCormick that he\nwould be arrested if he did not stop expressing his opinion in such a mmmer. Said agents of the\nCity of Lawrence (police officers) so threatened plaintiff McCormick with arrest at least 20\ntimes during said time-frame, generally any time plaiutiff verbally criticized or challenged the\nofficers’ avtions. Also du~ing said time-frame, plaintiff has been physically attacked by\nLawrence police officers on three occasions for making protected expressions; and on two of\nthese occasions, which are ~iescdbed below, plaintiff has been robbed and kidnapped by\nLawrence pofice officers in response to plaintiff’s making of protected speech from a public\nsidewalk.\nOn 7/13/02 plainfi~s, for the purpose of making documentary videos about police activity and\ntrying to protect against violations of plaintiffs’ constitutional fights, procured, among other\nthiags, one (1) Sony \"DCR-TRV340 Digital Camcorder,\" one (1) Olympus \"$711, Voice\nActivated Pearlcorder~ (micro-cassette recorder), and one (1) Sony \"ICD-B25 tC Recorder\"\ndigital, personal recording device, on behalf of themselves and shadowave.org. Shadowave.org\nis a non-profit organization operated by plaintiffs and their associates, which exists for the\npurpose of \"exposing government corruption and resisting government oppression.\" Said\nrecording devices cost plaintiffs and shadowave.org approximately $1100.\nOn or about 7/13/02 plaintiffs and other persons ass~ with plaintiffs made a resolution to,\nwhen~er practicable, protest police activity in the City of Lawrence on either or both Friday\nand Saturday of each week of each month of each year into the foreseeable future, including\nFriday, 7/19/02, and Saturday, 7/20/02, and all weeks thereafter.\n¯\nOn 7/13/02, at or about 11:45 P.M., plainti~ were preparing to buy some ~’Fren~h-fries\" from\nthe Mc~Donalds \"~staurant\" at 33rd and S. Iowa Streets, Lawrence. At that time plaintiffs\n2\n\nwitnessed a \"traffic stop\" being initiated by officer Scott Hofer of the Lawrence Police\nDepartment on said 33rd Street approximately one hundred feet West of said Iowa Street,\ndirely south of said McDonalds. Plaintiff McCormick began recording with said digital\ncamcorder and protesting the said traffic stop being conducted by said Hofer from the parking\nlot of said McDonalds. While so protesting plaintiff McComfick self-censored his expressions\ndue to his prior knowledge that Lawrence Police officers are predominantly of a patently\nlawless nature where .First Amendment expressive rights are concerned.\n10. Shortly after plaintiff M~-Cormick (plaintiff) initiated his said First Amendment protest on\n7/13/02 Mik (pronounced Mike) Shanks of the Lawrence Police Department arrived on the\nscene of said traffic stop. Before 7/13/02, plaintiff had prior experiences with Shanks on or\nabout 6/27/02 when saict Shanks interfered with plainti~s making of protected expressions\nwhile aOing under color of law. (Plaintiff has a video-tape of the 6/27/02 incident with Shanks\nwhich shows the same interfering with plaintiff’s video-taping and making of protected\nexpressions.) Plaintiff began verbally criticizing and h~g said Shanks as soon as the same\nexited his vehicle, in order to express plaintiff’s strc~ disapproval of an officer with whom\nplaintiff already had a ’Yen in\" and knew therefrom was an agent of oppression and\ntransgressor of the Constitution. Moments later, Shanks returned to his vehicle and directed\ntwo spot-lights upon plaintiff Said lights were so bright that plaintiff’s camera was not abIe to\nmake a quality recordingof the \"traffic stop\" while said lights were shining upon it, thereby\ninterfering with plaintiff’s journalistic purpose of taking documentary film and otherwise\nmaking a record of the incident for various purposes.\n11. After said Shanks shone said spot-fights upon plaintiff, ptaintiff clumged his position\napproximately ten feet so his camera wasn’t ’blinded’ by said spot-lights, then dmaged his\nposition again; however said Shank~ redirected ~he said lights upon plainfiffwherever plaintiff\naied to fiIm from. Plaintif~ perturbed by Shank’s attempt to thwart plaintiff’s ftlming and\nprotesting of the incident, then moved out of the McDonalds parking tot and assumed a stance\nupon the public side-walk, which is an open public forum, approximately 20 feet from said\ntraffic stop. At this same time said Shanks began walking from his vehicle towards the pick-up\ntruck that had been stopped by said Hofer. Prior to this point said Shanks had not participated\nin the said \"traffic stop\" in any way at all Also, prior to this point said Hofer had not said a\nword to plaintiff and had proceeded to conde~t the \"traffic stop\" without making any attempt\nwhatever to interfere with plaintiff’s speech (i.e. adhered to the law). Shanks threatened at that\n¯ time, when approximately half-way between his car and the vehicle stopped by Hofer, that he\nwould arrest plaintiff if plaintiff ’interfered’ with Shanks, even though Shanks was doing\n\nnothing at the traffic stop up to that point but interfering with pl~ntifrs filming and protesting\nof the incident. Plainliff then said words to the effect of: ~Was that a threat to arrest me?’ In\nresponse to said comment by plaintiff~ Shanks stopped walking towards the cab of s~Ad track\nand then said words to the effect of: ’Are you interfering with my investigation? I think you\nare. You’re under arrest.’ Shanks then rushed at plaintiff and Mr. Kastl, who had assumed a\nstance on said sidewalk approximately five feet from plaintiff. Prior to this point plaintiffKastl\nhad said and done nothing but stand on the sidewalk in sofidarity with plaintiff McCormick\nShanks then violently attacked and started trying to grab plaintiffs, with said Hofer immediately\njoining in said attack, all while both officers were armed.with deadly weapons, to wit: firearms\nand clubs. Plaintiffs were placed in immediate fear and apprehension of suffering bodily injury\nby the defendants\" said conduct. Plaintiff filmed the scene with said camcorder to the point\nShank’s said attack began, but during said attack plaintiff lost control of said camcorder and\ndoes not know when the same stopped filming. Plaintiffs also recorded the incident on the two\naforesaid audio recording devices.\n12. After commencing the aforesaid attack upon plaintiffs said Shanks and Hofer physically seized\nplaintiffs in a very violent fashion, grabbing, wrenching, pushing and taclding plaintiffs in a\nmanner that was rude, aggressive and violent, and in such a way that great bodily injury was a\nlikely result. Plaintiff McCormick suffered substantial abrasions and contusions as a reselt of\nShanks tackling plaintiff on the sidewalk. Thereafter Shanks on several occasions maliciously\nand deliberately inflicted excruciating pain upon plaintifi~ specifically driving his knee or some\nother part of his body into plaintiff’s back repeatecUy while plaintifl~was face-down, handcuffed\nand helpless on the ground. Plaintiff screamed his telephone number during such barbarism,\nand thereby caused one of the crowd of.witnesses.Uans~ed by the attack upon plainfi~ to\nleave a horrified message upon plaintiff’s answering machine from his cellular telepl~one.\nShanks drove his knee into plaintiff several more times while t~lling plaintiff to stop yelling\nplaintiff’s phone number. Shanks then took plaintiff to the trunk of Shanks’ patrol car, bent\nplain,tiff over such trunk, then began wrenching down on the inward facing portion of the\nhandcvSfs on plaintiff’s wrists, in a manner that was rude, aggressive and violent, and all in a\ndeliberate effort to inflict bodily injury to plaintiff. Shanks continued thrusting his massive,\nclinically obese bulk downward upon such handcuffs for approximately thirty seconds while\nplaintiff was literally.screaming at the top of his lungs in agony. Said barbarism by said Shanks\neaused substantial, temporary nerve damage in plaintiff’s right hand, specifically a feeling that\nsuch hand was ’asleep\" for more than a week after said Shank’s attack. Said barbarism also\ncaused other damages to plaintiff’s right wrist which plaintiff has photographic and video-tape\n\nevidence of. Thereafter said Shanks and said Hofer took plaintiffs to the Douglas County Jail\nand had plaintiffs charged with \"obstra~ion\" of a ~’traffic violation\" under K.S.A. 21-3808\n(even though K,S.A. 21-3808 does not apply to \"traific hfraclions\"). Plaintif~ mindful that\nLawrence police agents are utterly and patently lawless in terms of the First Amendment, had\n$3350 in cash on him for bail money in case he happened upon police activity on 7/13/02 o\n7/14/02 and again had his First Amendment rights blatantly transgressed by the City of\nLawrence. Plaintiffs. were each forced to pay a $500 (c~sh) bond before being released from\nthe Doughs County jail. Plaintiffs then had to pay $172.50 to roe’love Mr. Kastt’s car from an\nimpound lot (the car was for c~’tain burglarized, apparently by the police, and searched,\napparently by the police, and towed from McDonaIds’ parking lot, apparently by the police,\nwhile plaintiffs wer~ at the jail).\n13. On 7/13/02, dm’ing their violent attack on plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, said\nShanks and Hofer violently took from plaintiffs, against plaintiffs’ will, the recording devices\ndoserihed in paragraph 7; all without a warfare, without exigent circumstances, without\nplaintiff’s consent, and without probable cause to believe such devices were contraband or\nevidenc(cid:128) of any crime committed by plaintiffs (although such devices were ovid~ce of the\naggravated robbery, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and aggravated kidnapping\npeq~’ated against plaintiffs by the officers). Theroaik:r said Shanks searched ~h of said\nr~.,ording devices without a warrant, without plaintiffs’ consent, against plaintiffs’ will, without\n¢xigom ciroums~ces, and without probable oaus~ to beli~we the same were contraband or\nevidence of any crime (except the crimes committed by the officers during and al~ the taking\nof such devices). Upon learning that ~eir said property had been invaded in said manner\nplaintiffs were, and Stitl are, provoked to wrath, oppresse~ humiliated and disgusted by such\ninvasion; and plaintiffs further felt violated and invaded in their privacy and sanctity and\ninsecure at keeping propmy frec from such invasions.\n14. Plaintiffs have not protested or filmed polic.(cid:128) activity since 7/13/02 because plaintiffs (and thdr\nassociates) are afraid to continue their schedule of making protected protests of police a~tivity\neach Friday and Saturday for the foreseeable futm’(cid:128) dtm, in addition to the obvious reasons, to\nthe following: (i) plaintiffs are fi-ightened they will again he arrested for exercising such First\nAmendment rights; (ii) plaintiffs are afraid of suffering further violence at the hands of agents\nof th© Lawrence Poligo Department for exercising such rights; (’lii) the iccording devices\nplaintiffs need to conduct such protests and mk¢ documonUay footage of the same were taken\n’ by agents of the City of Lawrence on 7/14/01 and have not been returned as of the date fil~-\nstamped abovo; (iv) plaintiffs do not have the financial means to pay $1000 in bond money\n\nevery time they exercise their First Amendment rights to protest police activity, and so could\nget stuck in jail for a considembt~ length of time ffthey continue to protest as th~ .wish (i.¢.\nnot be able to make bail); (v) plaintiffs do not have the financial meatus to buy $1100 worth of\nreceding ~quipm~nt ev~/time they want to exercise their First Amendm~t rights, mak~\ndocumentary footage for public distribution, or make a record of First Amendment activities;\n(vi) plaintiffs do not have the financial means to pay $172.50 to retrieve Other of their cars\ne~ry time they protest police activity, and so could have their cars impounded on a long term\nbasis (i.e. might not be able to pay impound fees to retdeve their car(s)) ff they continue to\nexmo~se First Amendment rights; and, lastly, because nearly every time plaintiff has verbally\nprotested police activity in Lawrence he has either been arrested or.threntened with arrest by\nagents of the City of Lawrence.\n15. On or about 7/14/02 defendant Shanks swore two purported probable cause affidavits, and\ndefendant Knight swor~ two purported probable cause complaints, against plaintiffs, stating as\nfact that plaintiffs had violated K.S.A. 21-3808, all while knowing said instrmneuts did not on\ntheir face support probable cause to believe a~ crime had occurred under Kansas law, thereby\ninstigating Douglas County district court cas~ numbe~ 02-cr-1284 and 02-cr-1285 asainst\nplaintiffs McCormick and Kastl, respectively, all without probable camse to justify such cases.\nSuch insmtments caused plaintiffs to be seized and hailed into court by said pending court-\ncases from 7/14/02 ~ntil 4/8/03, when said cas~s were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on the\nsecond day of trial.\n16. On 6/28/02, at or about 11:45 P.M., plaintiff began protesting a \"sobriety checkpoint\" being\nperpctr~ed by agents of the City of Lawrence at approximately the 1200 Block of\nMassachusetts Street, Lawrence, Kansas. Def.enda~ Kirk Fultz was in charge of said \"check-\npoint.\" Two minutes and ’one second into plaintiff’s protest said Fultz approached plaintiff and\nsaid: \"You ne~ to make sure you don’t bother any of my officers. Do you understand?\" To\nwhich plaintiff responded: \"This is Kirk Fultz. This is the officer that repeatedly assaulted,\nbattered and fln~atened to arrest me on 8/15/00.\" (Plaintiff meant to say 8/18/01). Fultz then\nrep~ed his demand that plaintiff not \"bother\" any of \"my officers,\" to which plaintiff\nresponded: \"Frick yon That’s protected expressio~ I can quote a case to you if you want.\" A\nshort time lat~, at Nine minutes and 13 seconds into plainti~s protest, said Fullz again\napproached plaintiffund the following exchange took place:\n\"Fultz: Don’t walk past me.\nPlaintiff: Don’t walk past you?\nF: Don’t get any closer than right there (pointing to line on sidewalk).\n6\n\np: Are you going to arrest me ff I do?\nF: Yes.\nP: Can I say anything to them?\nF: No.\nP: I can’t say anything to them? (Referring to police officers on sidewalk.)\nF: No. They’re doing an investigation.\nP: Are you going to arrest me ifI say something to them?\nF: If you impede the investigation.\nP: No, ifI say something to them, are you going to arrest me?\nF: You heard what I said.\nP: Well, I just want to know. I want to say something to them and I want to know if I can or noL\noffioally?\nF: No, you can’t say anything to them.\nP: I can’t say anything to them, and that’s the ofti~ial position of the Lawrence Police Departm~at right\nhere right now7\nF: You heard what I said.\nSaid threats of arrest by said Fultz were in direct and immediate response to and in retaliation\nagainst plaintiffs making ofproteoted expressions, would have chilled an ordinary person from\ncontinuing to engage in such protected activity, caused plaintiff to fear continuing to engage in\nsuzh activity, caused plaintiff to self-censor his said expressive activity, caused fear in plaintiff,\noppressed plaintiff undex color of law, violated plaintiff’s clearly established fights of\n¯ .expression, and caused oaxiety and consternation in plaintiff.\n17. On or about 8/1/02, mLaWrenco, Ks.,\" Justin Stipanovich and Dean Brown, acting under color\nof law, knowingly and intentionally searched plaintiffs’ property, to wit: the video camera\ndescribed in paragraphs 7-12 above and the video-tape that was withia such camera when the\nsame were s,~zed from plaintLffs on 7/13/02, without plaintiffs’ permission, against plaintiffs’\nwill without a wammt, without exigent circumstances present, and without probable caase to\nbelieve the same was contraband or was or contained evidence of any crime. Upon learning\nthat their said propmy had beta invaded in said mmmer plaintiffs were, and still are, provoked\nto wrath, oppressed, humiliated and disgusted by such invasion; and plaintiffs fixthec felt\nviolated and invaded in their privacy and sanctity and insecure at keeping property free from\n¯ such invasions.\n7\n\n18.

On 1/10/02 plaintiff McCormick was arrested for makin__g protected expressions of police\nactivity from a public sidewalk. (Plaintiff has claims pending against the 1/10/02 arresting\nof~iocrs in case no. 02-2135-JWL before this Court.) During said patently illegal 1/10/02 arrest\nof plainti~ a micro-cassette recorder, which plaintiff was using to record the incident, was\ntaken from plaintiffby agents of the City of Lawrence.\n20. On or about 5/7/02, in Lawrence, Kansas, Warren Burket and Justin Stipanovich searched\nplaintiff’s property, to wit: a micro-cassette recorder and micro-cassette unlawfiflly taken from\nplaintiff by agents of the City of Lawrence on 1/10/02, as said in ¶ 19 above, said search being\nperformed without a wamant, without plaintiff’s permission, against plaintiff’s will, without\nexigent circumstances present, and without probable cause nor any legitimate cause whatever to\nbelieve the same contained or was evidence of a crime. Said Burket then made copies of\nplaintiff’s said propzrty and distributed the same to other unknown persons without plaintiff’s\npermission.

The City of Lawrence is also an \"enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect,\ninterstate or foreign commerce\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c).\n\n3. This action arises under the United States Constitution, particularly under the First, Fourth,\nFiPth and Fourteenth Amendments to such Constitution, and pursuant to the statutory law of the\nUnited States, particularly Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1988.\n4. The claims made and remedies sought herein are juristic to this Court pursuant to Title 28\nU.S.C. See. 1331 and Sec. 1343, and by the common law of the United States and the State of\nKansas.\nBACKGROUND FACTS\nPlaintiffs are civil rights activists and critics of the practices and policies of the contemporary\n’law-enforcement growth industry.’\nBetween 8/18/01 and 7/13/02 plaintiff McCormick (plaintiff) verbally protested police activity\nand/or recorded police activity with audio or video recording devices in Lawrence, Ks., on\napproximately 50 occasions, almost always from a public sidewalk. On approximately 25 of\nthese occasions plaintiff made his presence known to Lawrence police officers by criticizing or\nverbally challenging Lawrence police officers from a public sidewalk, pursuant to Houston v.\nHill, 482 U.S. 451. In general, at least 20 times, Lawrence police officers have retaliated\nagainst plaintiff’s verbal challenges and criticism by threatening to plaintiff McCormick that he\nwould be arrested if he did not stop expressing his opinion in such a manner. Said agents of the\nCity of Lawrence (police officers) so threatened plaintiff McCormick with arrest at least 20\ntimes during said time-frame, generally any time plaintiff verbally criticized or challenged the\nofficers’ actions. Also during said time-frame, plaintiff has been physically attacked by\nLawrence police officers on three occasions for making protected expressions; and on two of\nthese occasions, which are described below, plaintiff has been robbed and kidnapped by\nLawrence police officers in response to plainfifs making of protected speech from a public\nsidewalk.\n6a.    Police Chief Ron Olin and the City of Lawrence have failed to correctly, adequately or\nproperly train Lawrence police officers that (1) citizens have First Amendment rights of\nexpression and association which the officers cannot lawfully interfere with or terminate, (2) that\nsuch First Amendment rights include directing profanity, criticism and insults at the government\nand its agents, including the police, (3) that when verbal criticism, insults and/or profanity is\ndirected at police officers from an open public forum police officers may not arrest or threaten to\narrest persons unless such speech incites immediate lawless action (and that lawless police\nactions do not qualify), (4) to error on the side of caution where rights of expression are\n2\n\nconcerned, (5) that fights of expression need \"breathing space\" in order to survive, and (6) that\npolice officers may not arrest citizens for defying unlawful police orders which interfere with or\nterminate rights of expression. Ron Olin’s failure to train Lawrence police officers in the\nforegoing regards was a proximate cause of plaintiffs’ injuries enunciated elsewhere in this\nComplaint, in that plaintiffs’ said injuries would not have been suffered by plaintiffs were the\nCity’s police officers properly trained about plaintiffs’ First Amendment right to criticize police\nofficers from public sidewalks. This failure to train persists to the date this Complaint was filed\nwith the Court, years after plaintiffMcCormick brought such failure to light, and a year and a half\natter plaintiff McCormick first sued the City for maintaining a practice of unlawfully retaliating\nagainst plaintiffs criticism of police officers from public sidewalks.\nOn 7/13/02 plaintiffs, for the purpose of making documentary videos about police activity and\ntrying to protect against violations of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, procured, among other\nthings, one (1) Sony \"DCR-TRV340 Digital Camcorder,\" one (1) Olympus \"$711, Voice\nActivated Pearlcorder\" (micro-cassette recorder), and one (1) Sony \"ICD-B25 IC Recorder\"\ndigital, personal recording device, on behalf of themselves and shadowave.org. Shadowave.org\nis a non-profit organization operated by plaintiffs and their associates, which exists for the\npurpose of \"exposing government corruption and resisting government oppression.\" Said\nrecording devices cost plaintiffs and shadowave.org approximately $1100.\nOn or about 7/13/02 plaintiffs and other persons associated with plaintiffs made a resolution to,\nwhenever practicable, protest police activity in the City of Lawrence on either or both Friday\nand Saturday of each week of each month of each year into the foreseeable future, including\nFriday, 7/19/02, and Saturday, 7/20/02, and all weeks thereafter.\nOn 7/13/02, at or about 11:45 P.M., plaintiffs were preparing to buy some \"’French-fries\" from\nthe McDonalds \"restaurant\" at 33rd and S. Iowa Streets, Lawrence. At that time plaintiffs\nwitnessed a \"traffic stop\" being initiated by officer Scott Hofer of the Lawrence Police\nDepartment on said 33rd Street approximately one hundred feet West of said Iowa Street,\ndirectly south of said McDonalds. Plaintiff McCormick began recording with said digital\ncamcorder and protesting the said traffic stop being conducted by said Hofer from the parking\nlot of said McDonalds. While so protesting plaintiff McCormick self-censored his expressions\ndue to his prior knowledge that Lawrence Police officers are predominantly of a patently\nlawless nature where First Amendment expressive rights are concerned.\n10. Shortly after plaintiff McCormick (plaintiff) initiated his said First Amendment protest on\n7/13/02 Mik (pronounced Mike) Shanks of the Lawrence Police Department arrived on the\n\nscene of said traffic stop. Before 7/13/02, plaintiff had prior experiences with Shanks on or\nabout 6/27/02 when said Shanks interfered with plaintiff’s making of protected expressions\nwhile acting under color of law. (Plaintiff has a video-tape of the 6/27/02 incident with Shanks\nwhich shows the same interfering with plaintiff’s video-taping and making of protected\nexpressions.) Plaintiff began verbally criticizing and heckling said Shanks as soon as the same\nexited his vehicle, in order to express plaintiff’s strong disapproval of an off~cer with whom\nplaintiff already had a \"run in\" and knew therefrom was an agent of oppression and\ntransgressor of the Constitution. Moments later, Shanks returned to his vehicle and directed\ntwo spot-lights upon plaintiff. Said lights were so bright that plaintiff’s camera was not able to\nmake a quality recording of the \"traffic stop\" while said lights were shining upon it, thereby\ninterfering with plaintiff’s journalistic purpose of taking documentary film and otherwise\nmaking a record of the incident for various purposes.\n11. After said Shanks shone said spot-lights upon plaintiff, plaintiff changed his position\napproximately ten feet so his camera wasn’t ’blinded’ by said spot-lights, then changed his\nposition again; however said Shanks redirected the said lights upon plaintiff wherever plaintiff\ntried to film from. Plaintiff, perturbed by Shank’s attempt to thwart plaintiff’s filming and\nprotesting of the incident, then moved out of the McDonalds parking lot and assumed a stance\nupon the public side-walk, which is an open public forum, approximately 20 feet from said\ntraffic stop. At this same time said Shanks began walking from his vehicle towards the pick-up\ntruck that had been stopped by said Hofer. Prior to this point said Shanks had not participated\nin the said \"traffic stop\" in any way at all. Also, prior to this point said Hofer had not said a\nword to plaintiff and had proceeded to conduct the \"traffic stop\" without making any attempt\nwhatever to interfere with plaintiff’s speech (i.e. adhered to the law). Shanks threatened at that\ntime, when approximately half-way between his car and the vehicle stopped by Hofer, that he\nwould arrest plaintiff if plaintiff ’interfered’ with Shanks, even though Shanks was doing\nnothing at the traffic stop up to that point but interfering with plaintiff’s filming and protesting\nof the incident. Plaintiff then said words to the effect of: ’Was that a threat to arrest me?’ In\nresponse to said comment by plaintiff, Shanks stopped walking towards the cab of said truck\nand then said words to the effect of: ’Are you interfering with my investigation? I think you\nare. You’re under arrest.’ Shanks then rushed at plaintiff and Mr. Kasfl, who had assumed a\nstance on said sidewalk approximately five feet from plaintiff. Prior to this point plaintiffKastl\nhad said and done nothing but stand on the sidewalk in solidarity with plaintiff McCormick.\nShanks then violently attacked and started trying to grab plaintiffs, with said Hofer immediately\njoining in said attack, all while both officers were armed with deadly weapons, to wit: firearms\n4\n\nand clubs, Plaintiffs were placed in immediate fear and apprehension of suffering bodily injury\nby the defendants’ said conduct. Plaintiff filmed the scene with said camcorder to the point\nShank’s said attack began, but during said attack plaintiff lost control of said camcorder and\ndoes not know when the same stopped filming. Plaintiffs also recorded the incident on the two\naforesaid audio recording devices.\n12. After commencing the aforesaid attack upon plaintiffs said Shanks and Hofer physically seized\nplaintiffs in a very violent fashion, grabbing, wrenching, pushing and tackling plaintiffs in a\nmanner that was rude, aggressive and violent, and in such a way that great bodily injury was a\nlikely result. Plaintiff McCormick suffered substantial abrasions and contusions as a result of\nShanks tackling plaintiff on the sidewalk. Thereafter Shanks on several occasions maliciously\nand deliberately inflicted excruciating pain upon plaintiff, specifically driving his knee or some\nother part of his body into plaintiffs back repeatedly while plaintiff was face-down, handcuffed\nand helpless on the ground. Plaintiff screamed his telephone number during such barbarism,\nand thereby caused one of the crowd of witnesses transfixed by the attack upon plaintiffs to\nleave a horrified message upon plaintiff’s answering machine from his cellular telephone.\nShanks drove his knee into plaintiff several more times while telling plaintiff to stop yelling\nplaintiff’s phone number. Shanks then took plaintiff to the trunk of Shanks’ patrol car, bent\nplaintiff over such trtmk, then began wrenching down on the inward facing portion of the\nhandcuffs on plaintiff’s wrists, in a manner that was rude, aggressive and violent, and all in a\ndeliberate effort to inflict bodily injury to plaintiff. Shanks continued thrusting his massive,\nclinically obese bulk downward upon such handcuffs for approximately thirty seconds while\nplaintiff was literally screaming at the top of his lungs in agony. Said barbarism by said Shanks\ncaused substantial, temporary nerve damage in plaintiff’s right hand, specifically a feeling that\nsuch hand was ’asleep’ for more than a week after said Shank’s attack. Said barbarism also\ncaused other damages to plaintiff’s right wrist which plaintiff has photographic and video-tape\nevidence of. Thereafter said Shanks and said Hofer took plaintiffs to the Douglas County Jail\nand had plaintiffs charged with \"obstruction\" of a \"traffic violation\" under K.S.A. 21-3808\n(even though K.S.A. 21-3808 does not apply to \"traffic infractions\"). Plaintiff, mindful that\nLawrence police agents are utterly and patently lawless in terms of the First Amendment, had\n$3350 in cash on him for bail money in case he happened upon police activity on 7/13/02 -\n7/14/02 and again had his First Amendment rights blatantly transgressed by the City of\nLawrence. Plaintiffs were each forced to pay a $500 (cash) bond before being released from\nthe Douglas County jail. Plaintiffs then had to pay $172.50 to retrieve Mr. Kastl’s car from an\nimpound lot (the car was for certain burglarized, apparently by the police, and searched,\n5\n\napparently by the police, and towed from McDonalds\" parking lot, apparently by the police,\nwhile plaintiffs were at the jail).\n13. On 7/13/02, during their violent attack on plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights, said\nShanks and Hofer violently took from plaintiffs, against plaintiffs’ will, the recording devices\ndescribed in paragraph 7; all without a warrant, without exigent circumstances, without\nplaintiff’s consent, and without probable cause to believe such devices were contraband or\nevidence of any crime committed by plaintiffs (although such devices were evidence of the\naggravated robbery, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and aggravated kidnapping\nperpetrated against plaintiffs by the officers). Thereatter said Shanks searched each of said\nrecording devices without a warrant, without plaintiffs’ consent, against plaintiffs’ will, without\nexigent circumstances, and without probable cause to believe the same were contraband or\nevidence of any crime (except the crimes committed by the officers during and after the taking\nof suoh devices). Upon learning that their said property had been invaded ha said manner\nplaintiffs were, and still are, provoked to wrath, oppressed, humiliated and disgusted by such\ninvasion; and plaintiffs further felt violated and invaded in their privacy and sanctity and\ninsecure at keeping property free from such invasions.\n13a. After their said attack upon and robbery of plaintiffs the defendants Shanks and Hofer\nmade an agreement to destroy, erase or steal the video recording of the 7/13/02 incident which\nplaintiffs made on their video-camera, the audio recording which plaintiff McCormick made on\nthe said micro-cassette recorder, and the audio recording plaintiff Kastl made on the said digital\nrecording device, and to lie about such destruction in court in order to conceal their own\nmisconduct. Plaintiffs estimate the commercial value of said recordings at somewhere between\n$10,000 and $10,000,000, depending on market response. One or both of the said defendants\nthen so destroyed the said recordings, in order to conceal evidence of their own misconduct, in\norder to deprive plaintiffs of such evidence and the ability to publish and distribute the same, and\nin order to allow defendants to commit perjury about the events of 7/13/02 to facilitate the\nconcealment of defendants’ misconduct. The defendants also erased other recordings from the\nsaid digital recording device that were stored upon the same prior to the 7/13/02 incident between\nthe parties. Said recordings were each destroyed by the defendants prior to plaintiffs publishing,\nreproducing, distributing or copyrighting the same. As a result of defendants’ destruction of the\nsaid recordings plaintiffs were not able to publish, reproduce, copyright or distribute such\nrecordings as plaintiffs originally intended to do.\n6\n\n14. Plaintiffs have not prot~ted.or fi!me o!icc, ,,,~,,,L~ ~H ...........,~,,~,~ v,,,,,~,,,~ ~,~,,~ ,,~tr\nassociates) are afraid to continue their schedule of malting protected protests of police activity\neach Friday and Saturday for the foreseeable future, due, in addition to the obvious reasons, to\nthe following: (i) plaintiffs are frightened they will again b.e arrested for exercising such First\nAmendment rights~ (ii) plaintiffs are afraid of suffering fur~er violence at the hands of agents\nof the Lawrence Police Department fol exercising such Tights; (iii) the recording devices\nplaintiffs need to conduct such protests and take documentary tbotage of the same were taken\n-by agents of the-Cit~- of Lawrence on 7/14/01 and have not been returned as of the date file-\nstamped above; (iv).plaintiffs do not have the financial means to pay $1000 in bond money\nevery time they exercise their First Amendment rights to protest police activity, and so could\nget stuck in jail for a considerable length of time if they continue to protest as they wish (i,e.\nnot be able to make bail); (v) plaintiffs do not have the financial means to buy $1100 worth of\nrecording equipment every time they want to exercise their First Amendment rights, make\ndocumentary footage for public distribution, or make a record of~irst Amendment activities;\n(vi) plaintiffs do not have the fmancial means to pay $172.50 to retrieve either of their ears\nevery time they protest police activity, and so could have their cars impounded on a long term\nbasis (i.e. might not be able to pay impound fees to retrieve their car(s)) if they continue to\nexercise First Amendment rights; and, lastly, because nearly every time plaintiff has verbally\nprotested police activity in Lawrence he has either been arrested or threatened with arrest by\nagents of the City of Lawrence.\n15. On or about 7/14/02 defendant Shanks swore two purported probable cause affidavits, and\ndefendant Knight swore two purported probable cause complaints, against plaintiffs, stating as\nfact that plaintiffs had violated K.S.A. 21-3808, all while knowing said instruments did not on\ntheir face support probable cause to believe any crime had occurred under Kansas law, thereby\ninstigating Douglas County district court case numbers 02-cr-1284 and 02-cr-1285 against\nplaintiffs McCormick and Kastl, respectively, all without probable cause to justify such cases.\nSuch instruments caused plaintiffs to be seized and hailed into court by said pending court-\ncases from 7/14/02 until 4/8/03, when said cases were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on the\nsecond da_v of trial.\n16. On 6/28/02, at or about 11:45 P.M., plaintiff began protesting a \"sobriety checkpoint\" being\nperpetrated by agents of the City of Lawrence at approximately the 1200 Block of\nMassachusetts Street, Lawrence, Kansas. Defendant Kirk Fultz was in charge of said \"check-\npoint.\" Two minutes and one second into plaintiffs protest said Fultz approached plaintiff and\nsaid: \"You need to make sure you don’t bother any of my officers. Do you understand?\" To\n7\n\nwhich plaintiff responded: \"This is Kirk Fultz. This is the officer that repeatedly assaulted,\nbattered and threatened to arrest me on 8/18/00.\" (Plaintiff meant to say 8/18/01). Fultz then\nrepeated his demand that plaintiff not \"bother\" any of \"my officers,\" to which plaintiff\nresponded: \"Fuck you. That’s protected expression. I can quote a case to you if you want.\" A\nshort time later, at Nine minutes and 13 seconds into plaintiff’s protest, said Fultz again\napproached plaintiff and the following exchange took place:\n\"Fultz: Don’t walk past me.\nPlaintiff: Don’t walk past you?\nF: Don’t get any closer than fight there (pointing to line on sidewalk).\nP: Are you going to arrest me ifI do?\nF: Yes.\nP: Can I say anything to them?\nF: No.\nP: I can’t say anything to them? (Referring to police officers on sidewalk.)\nF: No. They’re doing an investigation.\nP: Are you going to arrest me ifI say something to them?\nF: If you impede the investigation.\nP: No, ifI say something to them, are you going to arrest me?\nF: You heard what I said.\nP: Well, I just want to know. I want to say something to them and I want to know if I can or not,\nofficially?\nF: No, you can’t say anything to them.\nP: I can’t say anything to them, and that’s the official position of the Lawrence Police Department right\nhere right now?\nF: You heard what I said.\nSaid threats of arrest by said Fultz were in direct and immediate response to and in retaliation\nagainst plaintiff’s making of protected expressions, would have chilled an ordinary person from\ncontinuing to engage in such protected activity, caused plaintiff to fear continuing to engage in\nsuch activity, caused plaintiff to self-censor his said expressive activity, caused fear in plaintiff,\noppressed plaintiff under color of law, violated plaintiff’s clearly established rights of\nexpression, and caused anxiety and consternation in plaintiff.\n17. On or about 8/1/02, in Lawrence, Ks., Justin Stipanovich and Dean Brown, acting under color\nof law, knowingly and intentionally searched plaintiffs’ property, to wit: the video camera\n\ndescribed in paragraphs 7-12 above and the video-tape that was within such camera when the\nsame were seized from plaintiffs on 7/13/02, without plaintiffs’ permission, against plaintiffs’\nwill, without a warrant, without exigent circumstances present, and without probable cause to\nbelieve the same was contraband or was or contained evidence of any crime. Upon learning\nthat their said property had been invaded in said manner plaintiffs were, and still are, provoked\nto wrath, oppressed, humiliated and disgusted by such invasion; and plaintiffs further felt\nviolated and invaded in their privacy and sanctity and insecure at keeping property free from\nsuch invasions.\n18. On or about 9/5/02, in Lawrence, Ks., Mike Pattrick and Dean Brown, acting under color of\nlaw, knowingly and intentionally searched plaintiffs’ property, to wit: the video camera\ndescribed in paragraph 11 above and the video-tape that was within such camera when the same\nwere seized from plaintiffs on 7/13/02, without plaintiffs’ permission, against plaintiffs’ will,\nwithout a warrant, without exigent circumstances present, and without probable cause to\nbelieve the same was contraband or was or contained evidence of any crime. Upon learning\nthat their said property had been invaded in said manner plaintiffs were, and still are, provoked\nto wrath, oppressed, humiliated and disgusted by such invasion; and plaintiffs further felt\nviolated and invaded in their privacy and sanctity and insecure at keeping property free from\nsuch invasions.\n19. On 1/10/02 plaintiff McCormick was arrested for making protected expressions of police\nactivity from a public sidewalk. (Plaintiff has claims pending against the 1/10/02 arresting\nofficers in case no. 02-2135-JWL before this Court.) During said patently illegal 1/10/02 arrest\nof plaintiff, a micro-cassette recorder, which plaintiff was using to record the incident, was\ntaken from plaintiff by agents of the City of Lawrence.\n20. On or about 5/7/02, in Lawrence, Kansas, Warren Burket and Justin Stipanovich searched\nplaintiff’s property, to wit: a micro-cassette recorder and micro-cassette tmlawfully taken from\nplaintiff by agents of the City of Lawrence on 1/10/02, as said in ¶ 19 above, said search being\nperformed without a warrant, without plaintiff’s permission, against plaintiff’s will, without\nexigent circumstances present, and without probable cause nor any legitimate cause whatever to\nbelieve the same contained or was evidence of a crime. Said Burket then made copies of\nplaintiff’s said property and distributed the same to other unknown persons without plaintiff’s\npermission. Upon learning that his said property had been invaded in said manner plaintiff\nwas, and still is, provoked to wrath, oppressed, humiliated and disgusted by such invasion; and\nplaintiff further felt violated and invaded in his privacy and sanctity and insecure at keeping\nproperty free from such invasions.\n9\n\n21. Between 8/18/01 and the present the following individuals: Kirk Fultz, Leo Souders, James\nWhite, Scott Hofer, and Mik Shanks, who are each employed by the City of Lawrence, which is\nan \"enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, did\nconduct said City’s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity, to wit: (1) on 8/18/01 Kirk\nFultz did, while possessing a deadly weapon, to wit: a handgun, repeatedly place plaintiff\nMcCormick in immediate apprehension of bodily harm and cause an offfensive, rude and\naggressive touching of plaintiff by standing within inches of plaintiff McCormick while\nscreaming profanities at plaintiff, repeatedly bumping his chest into plaintiff in an offensive and\naggressive manner, challenging plaintiff to fight, threatening to \"take\" plaintiff \"down,\" and\notherwise acting in an assaultive manner while so bumping his chest into plaintiff, all for the\npurpose of interfering with a political function, to wit: criticizing the Lawrence Police\nDepartment, its agents, and the lawless manner in which such agents repeatedly act, all of\nwhich constituted \"aggravated assault\" within the meaning of K.S.A. 21-3410 and/or\n\"aggravated battery\" within the meaning of K.S.A. 21-3414;

(3) on or\nabout 3/18/02 James White knowingly swore a materially false affidavit to institute a phony\ncriminal case against plaintiff McCormick regarding the said 1/10/02 incident, which material\nfalsity included omitting from such affidavit the fact that plaintiff made a micro-cassette\nrecording of the 1/10/02 incident, that White took such recording from plaintiff, and that such\nrecording refutes the purported \"facts\" in White’s said affidavit, all of which constitutes\n\"perjury\" within the meaning of K.S.A. 21-3805;

      "text": "278 Kan. 797 (2005)\n104 P.3d 991\nSHAWN P. McCORMICK, Appellant,\nv.\nCITY OF LAWRENCE, KANSAS, et al., Appellees.\nNo. 90,853.\nSupreme Court of Kansas.\nOpinion filed January 21, 2005.\nTheodore J. Lickteig, of Law Offices of Theodore J. Lickteig, of Overland Park, argued the cause and was on the\nbriefs for appellant.\nGerald L. Cooley, of Gilliland & Hayes, P.A., of Lawrence, argued the cause, and Randall F. Larkin, of the same\nfirm, was with him on the briefs for appellees.\nThe opinion was delivered by\nLUCKERT, J.:\nShawn P. McCormick sued the City of Lawrence (City) and various police officers for violating the strip and body\ncavity search statutes, K.S.A. 22-2521 and K.S.A. 22-2522, which are made actionable by K.S.A. 22-2523. The\ndistrict court dismissed McCormick's lawsuit, ruling that it was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations.\nThe district court found that McCormick's cause of action was a general tort covered by the 2-year statute of\nlimitations set forth in K.S.A. 2003 Supp. 60-513, not an action based upon a liability created by a statute covered\nby the 3-year statute of limitations set forth in K.S.A. 60-512(2). The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that either\nthe 1-year statute of limitations in K.S.A. 60-514 or the 2-year statute of limitations in K.S.A. 2003 Supp. 60-513\napplied but not the 3-year statute of limitations in K.S.A. 60-512(2). McCormick v. City of Lawrence, 32 Kan. App.\n2d 817, 818, 820, 89 P.3d 657 (2004).\nThis court granted McCormick's petition for review. The sole issue before us is whether the 3-year statute of\n798 limitations found in K.S.A. 60-512(2) applies to actions brought under K.S.A. 22-2523, *798 which by its terms\nincorporates K.S.A. 22-2521 and K.S.A. 22-2522. We conclude that the 3-year limitation period of K.S.A. 60-512\n(2) does apply, and we therefore reverse the Court of Appeals and the district court.\nThe issue of whether the statute of limitations barred the action arose at the district court level on a motion to\ndismiss filed by the City and the individual police officers who were named as defendants. The parties agree that\nif a 3-year statute of limitations applies, McCormick's petition was timely, but if a 2-year or 1-year statute of\nlimitations applies, his petition was untimely. McCormick, in his petition, alleges that the events which gave rise to\nthis lawsuit occurred on June 9, 1999. On June 4, 2002, McCormick filed a K.S.A. 12-105b(d) letter stating his\nclaim that Lawrence police officers illegally subjected McCormick to a strip and body cavity search. McCormick's\nclaim was denied by the City on September 23, 2002. On September 24, 2002, McCormick filed the petition\nwhich is the subject of this appeal.\nThe Court of Appeals applied the correct standard of review for an order granting a motion to dismiss based upon\na determination that the action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations:\n\"The standard of review for a motion to dismiss under K.S.A. 60-212(b)(6) requires us to\ndetermine whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in the\nplaintiff's favor, the petition states any valid claim for relief. University of Kansas Mem. Corp. v.\nKansas Power & Light Co., 31 Kan. App. 2d 177, 179, 61 P.3d 741 (2003). Further, when the issue\nbefore us requires interpretation of a statute, we are faced with a question of law, and an appellate\ncourt's review of a question of law is unlimited. In this case, review of the trial court's ruling\n\nrequires us to interpret the meaning and potential applicability of statutes of limitation. See Stark v.\nMercantile Bank N.A., 29 Kan. App. 2d 717, 721, 33 P.3d 609 (2001).\" McCormick, 32 Kan. App.\n2d at 818.\nIn particular, our review of the district court's ruling requires us to interpret the meaning and potential applicability\nof the limitation period of K.S.A. 60-512(2), which establishes a 3-year time limit for \"[a]n action upon a liability\ncreated by a statute other than a penalty or forfeiture.\" The 3-year statute of limitations \"applies when a statute\ncreates a new, substantive right not recognized at common law, but not when a statute merely affords relief for\n799 certain *799 violations of existing common-law rights.\" Kelly v. Primeline Advisory, Inc., 256 Kan. 978, 983, 889\nP.2d 130 (1995). Stated another way, K.S.A. 60-512(2) applies when a statute creates a liability where liability\nwould not exist but for the statute. If the statute merely provides a procedure for obtaining relief, it does not\ntrigger K.S.A. 60-512(2). Wright v. Kansas Water Office, 255 Kan. 990, 997, 881 P.2d 567 (1994).\nThe district court applied these principles and concluded that K.S.A. 22-2523 was remedial and not substantive\nand did \"not establish any elements not found in a common law action for breach of privacy.\" Therefore, the\ndistrict court concluded, the action was based upon a right existing at common law and did not implicate the 3-\nyear statute of limitations which applies to \"a liability created by statute other than a penalty or forfeiture\" under\nK.S.A. 60-512(2). Instead the district court applied the 2-year limitations period of K.S.A. 60-513(a)(4) which\napplies to actions \"for injury to the rights of another, not arising on contract, and not herein enumerated.\"\nThe Court of Appeals also concluded that the 3-year statute of limitations did not apply; however, it did so on the\nbasis that McCormick's claim fell within the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and\nseizures. The court stated:\n\"In general, strip searches are discussed within the framework of the common law under the\nFourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. See \nRankin v. Colman, 476 So. 2d 234, 236 (Fla. Dist. App. 1985). The Fourth Amendment constrains\nState search intrusions made in an improper manner. This includes procedures employed by the\nauthorities to conduct a search involving intrusion into the body. 68 Am. Jur. 2d, Searches and\nSeizures § 250, p. 817. We believe it cannot be debated that the Fourth Amendment concept of\nprotection against unreasonable search and seizure is implicitly ingrained in our common-law\nsystem of justice.\n\"The Fourth Amendment, which codifies deeply held common-law notions of privacy, already\ngrants substantive rights protecting against government intrusion in the form of inappropriate\nsearches. The Kansas Tort Claims Act has made these rights actionable. Therefore, there is no\nnew liability created by K.S.A. 22-2523. Given that fact, K.S.A. 60-512(2) and its 3-year statute of\nlimitations would not apply to McCormick's situation. The action would have a 1-or 2-year\nlimitation period.\" McCormick, 32 Kan. App. 2d at 820.\n800 *800 In his petition for review, McCormick emphasizes that his claims are not based upon breach of privacy or\nthe Fourth Amendment but are based solely upon violations of K.S.A. 22-2521 and K.S.A. 22-2522. McCormick\nargues the district court and Court of Appeals erred in ignoring the specific elements stated in an action brought\nunder these statutes, elements which are not required in a breach of privacy or other action at common law or by\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000).\nIn analyzing this argument, we must view McCormick's allegations in a light most favorable to him. Our inquiry\nnecessarily starts with a consideration of the nature of those allegations. In Count I of his petition, McCormick\nalleges that various Lawrence police officers pulled McCormick out of a car and conducted a \"strip search,\" as\nthat phrase is defined in K.S.A. 22-2520(a). McCormick further alleges that the strip search violated K.S.A.\n22-2521(b).\nK.S.A. 22-2521 provides:\n\"(a) No person detained or arrested solely for the violation of a statute, resolution or ordinance\ninvolving a traffic, regulatory or nonviolent misdemeanor offense shall be strip searched unless\n\nthere is probable cause to believe that the individual is concealing a weapon or controlled\nsubstance.\n\"(b) Every strip search conducted by law enforcement officers or employees of a law enforcement\nagency or department shall be conducted by persons of the same sex as the person being\nsearched and shall be conducted so that the search cannot be observed by any person other than\nthe persons conducting the search, unless the right to privacy is waived by the person being\nsearched.\n\"(c) Every law enforcement officer or employee of a law enforcement agency or department\nconducting a strip search shall prepare a report of the strip search. The report shall include:\n(1) The name and sex of the person searched;\n(2) the name and sex of the persons conducting the search;\n(3) the time, date and place of the search; and\n(4) a statement of the results of the search.\"\nSpecifically, McCormick alleges the strip search \"was conducted so that it could be and was observed by others\nbesides the person who conducted the search.\" McCormick also alleges that the officers did not prepare a report\nof the strip search.\nIn Count II of his petition, McCormick alleges the search included a \"body cavity search\" as defined in K.S.A.\n22-2520(b) and that this search violated K.S.A. 22-2522. That statute provides:\n801 *801 \"(a) A body cavity search shall be conducted only under the authority of a search warrant\nspecifically authorizing a body cavity search.\n\"(b) Every body cavity search shall be conducted by a licensed physician or registered nurse. No\nperson authorized by this subsection to conduct a body cavity search or any person assisting in\nthe performance of such search shall be liable in any civil or criminal action when such search is\nperformed in a reasonable manner according to generally accepted medical practices in the\ncommunity where performed.\n\"(c) Law enforcement officers may be present during the search, but only those of the same sex\nas the person on whom a body cavity search is being conducted.\" K.S.A. 22-2522.\nAccording to McCormick's allegations, this provision was violated because there was no warrant specifically\nauthorizing a body cavity search and the search was not conducted by a licensed physician or registered nurse.\nIn Count III of the petition, McCormick also claims damages because of a civil conspiracy to violate his statutory\nrights.\nMcCormick alleges that the court has jurisdiction of his claims under K.S.A. 22-2523 which provides in part:\n\"(a) If liability is established in any civil action brought under the Kansas tort claims act for\nviolation of subsections (a) or (b) of K.S.A. 22-2521, or K.S.A. 22-2522, the plaintiff shall be\nentitled to an amount equal to the sum of the following:\n(1) Actual damages sustained by the plaintiff;\n(2) punitive damages, if the violation was willful, wanton or malicious;\n(3) the costs of the action, at the discretion of the court; and\n(4) a civil penalty in an amount set by the court of not more than $2,000 for each violation.\"\nMcCormick seeks actual damages and costs but does not seek either punitive damages or a civil penalty.\n\nEmphasizing the specific allegations he made and the language of these statutes, McCormick contends that a\ncause of action under K.S.A. 22-2521, K.S.A. 22-2522, and K.S.A. 22-2523 is a unique cause of action in the\nuniverse of possible causes of action for police misconduct. While he concedes that the alleged police\nmisconduct in his case might give rise to a number of causes of action under state law or pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n1983, he argues his statutory cause of action is different. He points out that the statutes at issue do not define the\n802 limits of civil liability for unreasonable searches *802 and seizures under the Fourth Amendment; rather, they\ndefine the manner in which strip searches and body cavity searches must be conducted and create a cause of\naction when the procedures set out therein are not followed.\nThe City counters that not every statute which describes a liability creates a cause of action, citing Kirtland v. Tri-\nState Ins. Co., 220 Kan. 631, 556 P.2d 199 (1976) (holding that K.S.A. 66-1,128, which permits a plaintiff to bring\nsuit against a motor carrier's insurer, is remedial rather than substantive), and Farmers Ins. Co. v. Farm Bureau\nMut. Ins. Co., 227 Kan. 533, 608 P.2d 923 (1980) (K.S.A. 40-3113 provides for recoupment by the insurer of\npersonal injury protection benefits paid to its insured from the tortfeasor and tortfeasor's insurer through\nsubrogation; statute was not meant to create new statutory cause of action). However, in those cases, the\nstatutes at issue did not set out the damages recoverable for specific violations as does K.S.A. 22-2523.\nK.S.A. 22-2523, which incorporates K.S.A. 22-2521 and K.S.A. 22-2522, is substantive and provides a cause of\naction when a search is conducted in violation of these statutes. Because there are unique elements for an action\nbrought for violation of these statutes, McCormick argues that the fact there are other theories of recovery\nrecognized at common law does not mean the 3-year limitation period does not apply. Support for McCormick's\nargument can be found in Kelly v. Primeline Advisory, Inc., 256 Kan. 978, 983, 889 P.2d 130 (1995), and Haag v.\nDry Basement, Inc., 11 Kan. App. 2d 649, 732 P.2d 392,rev. denied241 Kan. 838 (1987).\nKelly held that because fraud-based actions under the Kansas Securities Act are different from common-law\nactions for fraud, the Act creates liability and the 3-year statute of limitations applies. 256 Kan. at 983.\nHaag involved a claim under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act (KCPA). The defendant argued that because\nan action under the KCPA is an action based on fraud, the 2-year statute of limitations contained in K.S.A. 60-513\n(a)(3) barred the plaintiff's action. The Court of Appeals disagreed:\n803 *803 \"[A] plaintiff pursuing a cause of action under the KCPA may establish a supplier's liability\nwithout proof that the supplier intended to injure the consumer. This difference clearly\ndistinguishes the KCPA action from the common-law fraud action. A violation of the KCPA is not\nthe same as a common-law action for fraud such as is contemplated by the provisions of K.S.A.\n60-513[(a)](3).\" Haag, 11 Kan. App. 2d at 651.\nThe defendant in Haag also argued that the 1-year statute of limitations for an \"action upon a statutory penalty or\nforfeiture\" contained in K.S.A. 60-514(3) (Ensley 1983) barred the plaintiff's claim because a claim under the\nKCPA might give rise to a statutory penalty. Again, the Court of Appeals disagreed finding that \"`[t]he nature of\nplaintiff's action was to recover upon a liability created by statute and not upon a statutory penalty.'\" 11 Kan. App.\n2d at 651. See also Alexander v. Certified Master Builders Corp., 268 Kan. 812, 819-24, 1 P.3d 899 (2000)\n(further clarifying the issue of whether different statutes of limitation should apply depending upon whether an\naction under the KCPA seeks damages or a statutory penalty; holding that where the plaintiff sought both civil\npenalties and actual damages, the action was subject to the 3-year limitations period).\nFinally, the Haag court noted that \"`where there is doubt as to which statute of limitations should apply, the longer\nstatute should be chosen.' [Citation omitted.]\" 11 Kan. App. 2d at 652. The court concluded that because an\naction under the KCPA is an action upon a liability created by statute, the applicable statute of limitations was the\n3-year period provided by K.S.A. 60-512(2). 11 Kan. App. 2d at 652.\nThus, in both Kelly and Haag common-law causes of action existed, but the statutes created liability and in each\ncase the elements were different from the common-law action. Relying on these cases and noting the unique\nrequirements of K.S.A. 22-2520 et seq., McCormick argues that the Court of Appeals erred in relying on a Fourth\nAmendment analysis to find that his cause of action already existed at common law and was not created by\nstatute.\n\nThe City concedes there are differences between the statutes and the Fourth Amendment requirements but\n804 argues such differences *804 are irrelevant. Essentially, the City's argument is that the appropriate test to be\napplied is whether McCormick would have had any cause of action at common law regardless of whether it is a\ndifferent cause of action, while McCormick argues the appropriate test is whether he would have had the same\ncause of action at common law as he does under K.S.A. 22-2523.\nThe City's argument is erroneous. As discussed above, Kelly held that a fraud-based cause of action under the\nKansas Securities Act was not the same as a common-law fraud action; therefore, the Act created liability and the\n3-year statute of limitations applied. 256 Kan. at 983. Haag held that a claim under the Kansas Consumer\nProtection Act was different from a common-law fraud claim because the element of intent to defraud was not\nnecessary to establish a violation of KCPA; therefore, the KCPA created the cause of action and the 3-year\nstatute of limitations applied. 11 Kan. App. 2d at 650-51. Under Kelly and Haag, the applicable test is whether a\nplaintiff would have had the same cause of action at common law, not any cause of action.\nAre there differences, then, as McCormick suggests, between a cause of action pursuant to K.S.A. 22-2523 and\nother possible causes of action which McCormick might pursue based upon the facts he alleges? Beginning with\nclaims based upon a violation of McCormick's constitutional rights, McCormick could have brought an action\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. To state a valid claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, McCormick would be required\nto allege two essential elements: (1) that the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under\ncolor of state law and (2) that this conduct deprived him of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\nConstitution or federal law. Purvis v. Williams, 276 Kan. 182, 198, 73 P.3d 740 (2003).\nClearly, there is a difference between a § 1983 claim that police violated a plaintiff's Fourth Amendment right by\nconducting an unreasonable strip search or body cavity search and a claim that police violated K.S.A. 22-2521 or\nK.S.A. 22-2522 by failing to follow the procedures set out in those statutes when conducting a strip search or\nbody cavity search. First, a strip search or body cavity search could violate K.S.A. 22-2521 or K.S.A. 22-2522\n805 without *805 being unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. See Agustonelli v. Springer, 2004 WL 825300\n(unpublished opinion) (D. Kan. 2004); Allen v. Board of Com'rs of the County of Wyandotte, 773 F. Supp. 1442\n(D. Kan. 1991). In Agustonelli and Allen, plaintiffs filed claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claiming that police had\nviolated their Fourth Amendment rights to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures by subjecting them to\nstrip searches in violation of K.S.A. 22-2521. In each case, the district court ruled the plaintiff's reliance on the\nstate statute was misplaced because § 1983 does not provide redress for violations of state law, only for\nviolations of federal law done under color of state law. Thus, the only issue in each case was whether the strip\nsearch had violated the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights. See 2004 WL 825300, *6; 773 F. Supp. at 1447.\n\"[The] determination of the constitutionality of a strip search `requires a balancing of the need for\nthe particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must\nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification\nfor initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.' Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 60 L. Ed.\n2d 447, 99 S. Ct. 1861 (1979) (emphasis added).\" Farmer v. Perrill, 288 F.3d 1254, 1259-1260\n(10th Cir. 2002).\nThus, there are differences between an action brought for violations of K.S.A. 22-2521 and K.S.A. 22-2522 and\nan action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nAccording to the City, even if the Court of Appeals erred in comparing McCormick's cause of action to a Fourth\nAmendment claim, the court reached the correct conclusion because an injured party has always had the\ncommon-law right to bring a state law claim for damages caused by law enforcement officers. See Monroe v.\nDarr, 221 Kan. 281, 559 P.2d 322 (1977) (breach of privacy action for unlawful search of residence); Busalt v.\nDoidge, 91 Kan. 37, 136 Pac. 904 (1913) (action for assault against arresting officer). The district court compared\nthe elements required to state a cause of action for a violation of the statutes in question with the elements\nrequired to state a cause of action for breach of privacy. The court noted that in Monroe v. Darr, 221 Kan. 281,\n806 this court had upheld the right of a plaintiff to bring a cause of action for breach of privacy *806 where police had\nsearched the plaintiff's residence without a warrant. The court also cited Kedra v. City of Philadelphia, 454 F.\nSupp. 652 (E.D. Pa. 1978), which held that an illegal search is most analogous to the tort of intrusion upon a\n\nperson's seclusion. The district court reasoned that if a breach of privacy action can be brought for an\nunreasonable search of a person's property, such an action could also be brought for an unreasonable search of\nthe person himself or herself.\nThe district court concluded that K.S.A. 22-2523 does not establish any elements not found in a common-law\naction for breach of privacy. Breach of privacy includes an unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another,\nwhich is described as follows:\n\"`One who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of\nanother, or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his\nprivacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable man.'\" Dotson v. McLaughlin,\n216 Kan. 201, 207, 531 P.2d 1 (1975) (quoting Restatement [Second] of Torts § 652).\nThe district court found the only difference between a cause of action for breach of privacy and a cause of action\nunder K.S.A. 22-2523 was that the statute imposes a civil penalty in addition to damages. Accordingly, the district\ncourt held that McCormick's cause of action existed prior to the enactment of the statutes at issue; thus, the 2-\nyear statute of limitations for general tort actions applied and barred his action. However, as McCormick notes,\nthe statutory cause of action may be stated for violations of the statutory requirements such as conducting a strip\nsearch so that it can be observed by persons not involved in the search or not having a body cavity search\nperformed by a licensed health care provider. These violations are among those claimed by McCormick.\nThus, although one can imagine several common-law tort claims which might be brought based upon the facts\nalleged in this case 00 assault, battery, outrageous conduct causing severe emotional distress, and breach of\n97\nprivacy 00 those torts involve different elements than what must be shown to establish a violation of the strip\n97\nsearch and body cavity search statutes. K.S.A. 22-2521 and K.S.A. 22-2522 create substantive rights not\n807 recognized at common law. Consequently, we hold that an action brought for damages under K.S.A. *807\n22-2523, which incorporates K.S.A. 22-2521 and K.S.A. 22-2522, is subject to the 3-year period of limitations of\nK.S.A. 60-512(2).\nJudgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the district court is reversed.

      "text": "32 Kan.App. 2d 817 (2004)\n89 P.3d 657\nSHAWN P. McCORMICK, Appellant,\nv.\nCITY OF LAWRENCE, KANSAS, et al., Appellees.\nNo. 90,853.\nCourt of Appeals of Kansas.\nOpinion filed May 14, 2004.\nTheodore J. Lickteig, of Overland Park, for the appellant.\nGerald L. Cooley and Randall F. Larkin, of Gilliland & Hayes, P.A., of Lawrence, for the appellees.\nBefore Marquardt, P.J., Pierron and GREEN, JJ.\nPIERRON, J.\nShawn P. McCormick filed suit against the City of Lawrence and various police officers, claiming they had\nviolated his rights by subjecting him to both an improper strip search and an unauthorized body cavity search.\nMcCormick appeals the trial court's denial of his petition on grounds that the action was commenced after the\napplicable statute of limitations had expired.\nDue to the procedural history, the record in this case is quite sparse. The only account we have of the underlying\nfacts comes from McCormick's initial petition. According to McCormick, police officers \"converged\" on him on\nJune 9, 1999, with a search warrant for his residence. McCormick was placed in the back of a patrol car, but was\nsubsequently removed due to a \"disturbance.\" McCormick alleges he was pushed to the ground and kicked by\nseveral officers.\nMcCormick claimed that the officers ordered him to remove his clothing and lie on the ground in a body bag.\nMcCormick alleged that an officer used a portable vacuum to \"vacuum, touch and probe\" his genitals and\nbuttocks. The officers allegedly told McCormick that he should get used to that type of treatment because it would\noccur frequently in prison.\n818 *818 McCormick filed a K.S.A. 12-105b(d) letter on June 4, 2002, which was denied by the City on September\n23, 2002. On September 24, 2002, McCormick filed the petition which is the subject of this appeal. In the petition,\nMcCormick brought claims of an improper strip search and an unauthorized body cavity search. McCormick also\nclaimed damages from a civil conspiracy.\nThe City of Lawrence and the named police officers (City) responded by filing a motion to dismiss. The City\nclaimed that McCormick's petition failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Specifically, the City\nargued that McCormick's petition was filed outside the relevant statute of limitations. The motion was never set\nfor a hearing. In May 2003, the trial court decided the matter from the pleadings and ruled that McCormick's\npetition was not timely filed and, thus, was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. McCormick timely\nappeals the trial court's decision. We affirm.\nMcCormick presents this court with a detailed argument concerning the applicable statute of limitations. However,\nhis claim may be distilled into one argument 00 K.S.A. 22-2523(a)(1)-(3), which by its terms incorporates K.S.A.\n97\n22-2521 and 22-2522, creates liabilities other than a penalty or forfeiture, meaning claims based on 22-2523\ncome under the auspices of K.S.A. 60-512(2) and grant a 3-year limitations period.\nThe standard of review for a motion to dismiss under K.S.A. 60-212(b)(6) requires us to determine whether, in the\nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in the plaintiff's favor, the petition states any\nvalid claim for relief. University of Kansas Mem. Corp. v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 31 Kan. App. 2d 177, 179,\n\n61 P.3d 741 (2003). Further, when the issue before us requires interpretation of a statute, we are faced with a\nquestion of law, and an appellate court's review of a question of law is unlimited. In this case, review of the trial\ncourt's ruling requires us to interpret the meaning and potential applicability of statutes of limitation. See Stark v.\nMercantile Bank N.A., 29 Kan. App. 2d 717, 721, 33 P.3d 609 (2001).\nUnder K.S.A. 2003 Supp. 60-513, an action in tort would usually have a limitations period of 2 years, or 1 year if it\nis an action described in K.S.A. 60-514.\n819 *819 K.S.A. 22-2523 reads, in relevant part:\n\"(a) If liability is established in any civil action brought under the Kansas tort claims act for\nviolation of subsections (a) or (b) of K.S.A. 22-2521, or K.S.A. 22-2522, the plaintiff shall be\nentitled to an amount equal to the sum of the following:\n(1) Actual damages sustained by the plaintiff;\n(2) punitive damages, if the violation was willful, wanton or malicious;\n(3) the costs of the action, at the discretion of the court.\"\nK.S.A. 22-2521 addresses procedures to be followed in police strip searches. K.S.A. 22-2522 covers the\nprocedure to be used when executing a body cavity search.\nK.S.A. 60-512 reads, in relevant part: \"The following actions shall be brought within three (3) years: ... (2) An\naction upon a liability created by a statute other than a penalty or forfeiture.\"\nThe question we have before us is whether damages incurred due to violations of K.S.A. 22-2521 and K.S.A.\n22-2522 fall under K.S.A. 60-512(2).\nA liability is \"created by statute\" for purposes of K.S.A. 60-512(2) where liability for resultant damages would not\narise but for the statute. A statute that merely provides a procedure for obtaining relief does not trigger K.S.A.\n60-512(2); it must provide a new substantive right that does not otherwise exist at common law. Wright v. Kansas\nWater Office, 255 Kan. 990, 997, 881 P.2d 567 (1994).\nA statute creates no liability, as regards the applicability of K.S.A. 60-512(2), unless it discloses an intention,\nexpress or implied, that from disregard of the statutory command a liability for resultant damages shall arise \nwhich would not exist except for the statute. Clearly, an action is not based upon a liability created by statute if\nthe right is one which exists at common law in the absence of statute. Pecenka v. Alquest, 6 Kan. App. 2d 26, 28,\n626 P.2d 802,rev. denied229 Kan. 670 (1981).\nFor example, the obligation to afford women equal opportunity in employment did not exist at common law. That\nobligation was imposed by the passage of the Kansas Act Against Discrimination. See Wagher v. Guy's Foods,\nInc., 256 Kan. 300, 305, 885 P.2d 1197 (1994). Consequently, there is a liability created by statute, and K.S.A.\n820 60-512(2) applies to cases where a woman claims she *820 has been discriminated against at her place of\nemployment. 256 Kan. at 308.\nIn general, strip searches are discussed within the framework of the common law under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth,\nNinth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. See Rankin v. Colman, 476 So. 2d 234,\n236 (Fla. Dist. App. 1985). The Fourth Amendment constrains State search intrusions made in an improper\nmanner. This includes procedures employed by the authorities to conduct a search involving intrusion into the\nbody. 68 Am. Jur. 2d, Searches and Seizures § 250, p. 817. We believe it cannot be debated that the Fourth\nAmendment concept of protection against unreasonable search and seizure is implicitly ingrained in our\ncommon-law system of justice.\nThe Fourth Amendment, which codifies deeply held commonlaw notions of privacy, already grants substantive\nrights protecting against government intrusion in the form of inappropriate searches. The Kansas Tort Claims Act\nhas made these rights actionable. Therefore, there is no new liability created by K.S.A. 22-2523. Given that fact,\nK.S.A. 60-512(2) and its 3-year statute of limitations would not apply to McCormick's situation. The action would\n\nhave a 1- or 2-year limitation period. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by granting the City's motion to\ndismiss.\nAffirmed.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
