    "summary": "<p>On February 2, 2000, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the City of Newburgh and Orange County, New York in the United States Court for the Southern District of New York, White Plains Division. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel asked the court for damages, alleging that his Fourth Amendment rights had been violated, along with state tort law claims. Specifically, plaintiff alleged that the blanket strip search policy of strip violated his constitutional rights.</p><p>On February 19, 1999, Plaintiff was arraigned because he had been arrested during a routine traffic stop. The arresting officers had run his license and discovered an outstanding federal warrant from the State of Florida. The warrant was not for the plaintiff, but instead for another person with the same name. Plaintiff was held at the Orange County Correctional Facility while awaiting transfer of custody to the U.S. Marshals. Plaintiff was strip-searched three times: once upon arrival as part of a blanket policy of searching all arriving detainees; once in a 'bullpen' when officer suspected someone in the bullpen had cigarettes; and once prior to transfer to the U.S. Marshals on February 22.</p><p>On October 2, 2002, the Court (Judge Colleen McMahon) found the sheriff of Orange County was entitled to qualified immunity from damages in regard to the first of the three strip searches, but that material questions of fact remained on whether or not reasonable suspicion existed to justify the second and third strip searches.</p><p>The case settled just before trial on May 15, 2006. We have no further information on the details of the settlement. The case was formally dismissed on September 6, 2006.</p><p></p>",

New York.\nOctober 4, 2002.\n490 *490 Edward H. Gersowitz, Gersowitz, Libo & Korek, P.C., New York, NY, for Plaintiff.\nChristina Sanabria, County Attorney for Orange County, Goshen, NY, for Orange County.\nJames Fedorchak, Poughkeepsie, NY, for Defendant Sheriff H. Frank Bigger.\nDavid Posner, McCabe & Mack LLP, Poughkeepsie, NY, for Defendant City of Newburgh.\nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER DISPOSING OF CROSS-\nMOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGEMENT\nMCMAHON, District Judge.\nPlaintiff Jamie Murcia was involved in an automobile accident in the City of Newburgh. When Newburgh Police\nOfficer John Perez arrived at the scene of the accident, he arrested plaintiff because a Federal arrest warrant for\na person with the same name was outstanding. Plaintiff was unable to convince either Newburgh police officers\nor their counterparts at the Orange County jail that he was not the man named in the arrest warrant. According to\nplaintiff, as a result, he was subjected to four separate strip searches 00 one in Newburgh and three at the Orange\n97\nCounty Correctional Facility (\"OCCF\") 00 before he was turned over to the Federal authorities, who recognized the\n97\nerror and released plaintiff.\nPlaintiff brought this action in June of 2000 for violation of his civil rights, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and for\nnegligence. In November, 2001, Plaintiff sought leave of the Court to amend his complaint to include Defendant\nH. Frank Bigger, the Sheriff of Orange County. The Court granted this request. Plaintiff served an Amended\nComplaint in January, 2002.\n491 *491 Plaintiff now moves for partial summary judgment against defendants County of Orange and Sheriff Frank\n[1]\nBigger (\"defendants,\" for the purpose of this motion)  pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure on the grounds that the OCCF violated plaintiff's constitutional rights by strip searching him pursuant\nto an unconstitutional policy of strip searching all detainees upon arrival at the facility. Plaintiff also moves to\nstrike certain affirmative defenses raised by defendants pursuant to Rule 12(f). Defendants oppose plaintiff's\nmotion for summary judgment and cross-move for summary judgment on the claims alleging that the OCCF\n[2]\nmaintained an unconstitutional policy of strip searching all inmates upon arrival at the facility.\nFACTS\nPlaintiff was involved in a traffic accident in the City of Newburgh, New York. (Rule 56.1 Statement at ยถ 15, 16.) A\nNew York State DMV check of plaintiff's driver's license revealed that there was an outstanding warrant for his\narrest from the State of Florida, for a federal charge of Bond Jumping. (Id. at ยถ 17; Perez Dep. at 42, Exh. H to\nGersowitz Aff; Cert. of Lt. DiMarco.) Plaintiff was arrested and booked by City of Newburgh Police Officers. (Rule\n\n56.1 Statement at ยถ 17.) On February 19, 1999, after arraignment before a Newburgh City Court Judge, plaintiff\nwas remanded to the custody of the OCCF. (Id. at ยถ 19.)\nCorrections Officers at the OCCF conducted a visual body search (or \"hygiene check\" as Sergeant Zappolo\nreferred to it) of plaintiff upon his admission. (Id. at ยถ 26.) Sergeant Zappolo stated that the hygiene check was\nthe routine procedure at the OCCF. (Zappolo Dep. at 11-12, Exh. I to Gersowitz Aff.) According to Sergeant\nZappolo, hygiene checks of inmates include \"a check of their personal artifacts, their clothing, jewelry, and a\ncheck of their body.\" (Id. at 13.) \"Body searches\" consists of:\nThe lifting of their arms, checking under their arms. Opening their mouth, lifting up their tongue.\nTurning their head from side to side, looking in the inside of their ears. Bending their ears forward,\nlooking behind their ears. Running their fingers through their hair. Lifting up their genitals. Turning\naround. Picking up both feet, to check the bottoms of their feet. Bending over and a visual check\nof the rectum.\n(Id. at 13-14.) Sergeant Zappolo testified that this procedure was performed on every new inmate at the OCCF:\n\"if they come into the facility, they're searched.\" (Id. at 14.)\nThe second strip search of Mr. Murcia occurred after he was placed in the bullpen with other inmates. According\n492 to defendants, while plaintiff was in the book *492 ing/receiving \"bullpen\" along with other inmates awaiting his\nassignment to a housing unit, Jail personnel smelled cigarette smoke coming from the bullpen area. (Zappolo Aff.\nat ยถ 5.) Because cigarettes are contraband in the OCCF, Officers asked the inmates who had been smoking the\ncigarette. (Id. at ยถ 6.) None of the inmates admitted to having any cigarettes, hence the Officers removed them\nfrom the bullpen and conducted body searches on all of them in order to find the contraband. (Id. at ยถยถ 7-8.)\nOn February 22, the U.S. Marshals came to pick up plaintiff. Plaintiff was strip searched again on this day. (Rule\n56.1 Statement at ยถ 30.) Defendants claim that the U.S. Marshals conducted this third strip search of plaintiff.\nPlaintiff was released from the custody of the U.S. Marshals later that day after they discovered that he was not\nthe Jamie Murcia who was wanted for Bond Jumping.\nSTANDARDS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), the court will grant summary judgment if the evidence offered shows\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movants are entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Furthermore, where a\nplaintiff cannot establish an essential element of his claim, \"there can be `no genuine issue as to any material\nfact,' since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily\nrenders all other facts immaterial.\" Id. at 322-33, 106 S.Ct. 2548. On a motion for summary judgment, the court\nviews the record in the light most favorable to the non-movants and resolves all ambiguities and draws all\nreasonable inferences against the movants. See United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993,\n8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962); Donahue v. Windsor Locks Bd. of Fire Com'rs, 834 F.2d 54, 57 (2d Cir.1987).\nDISCUSSION\nI. The First Strip Search of Mr. Murcia Upon Arrival at the OCCF\nA. At all relevant times, the OCCF had a policy of strip searching all\nnew arrivals at the jail.\nPlaintiff claims that the OCCF had an unconstitutional policy of strip searching every inmate who arrived at the\nfacility. Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on his ยง 1983 claim relating to the first strip search he was subjected to\nat the OCCF.\n\nDefendants respond that plaintiff offers no evidence to support his claim that the OCCF had a policy of strip\nsearching all arriving inmates, noting that plaintiff did not depose Sheriff Bigger. Defendants acknowledge,\nhowever, that plaintiff has submitted the testimony of Sergeant Michael Zappolo in support of his claim that the\nOCCF had a blanket strip search policy in force at the time that plaintiff was admitted to the facility. Sergeant\nZappolo stated that it was the Sheriff's Department's policy to conduct visual body cavity searches of each and\nevery person who entered the OCCF: \"if they come into the facility, they're searched.\" (Zappolo Dep. at 14, Exh. I\nto Gersowitz Aff.) Defendants offer no contradictory evidence.\nIt is hard to read Defendants' arguments with a straight face, given their history in front of this Court on this issue.\nSee Dodge v. County of Orange, 208 F.R.D. 79 (S.D.N.Y.2002); Lee v. Perez, 175 F.Supp.2d 673, 681\n(S.D.N.Y.2001). However, limiting myself to the record before me, I conclude that no reasonable trier of fact could\n493 reach the conclusion sought by defendants because no evidence supports it. The only evidence in the record \n*493 on the subject is Sergeant Zappolo's testimony that every inmate who arrived at the OCCF was subjected to\nthe same \"hygiene check\" (read 00 strip search) that Mr. Murcia endured. Defendants offer no evidence whatever\n97\nthat raises a genuine issue of fact on the point.\nI therefore conclude that defendants maintained a blanket strip search policy for arriving inmates as a matter of\nundisputed fact.\nB. Despite the existence of this policy, defendants are entitled to\nsummary judgment dismissing plaintiff's claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง\n1983.\nDespite the existence of this policy, Sheriff Bigger asserts that he is not liable to plaintiff. He first asserts that the\nsearch of Murcia was constitutional, even if the policy was not, because Murcia was arrested for a felony.\nSecond, he argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity because the constitutionality of strip searching newly-\narrested felons without making a particularized assessment of the risk they pose was not sufficiently settled law\nto permit the imposition of liability.\n(1) A policy of strip searching all new felony arrivals would be\nunconstitutional\nBigger's first argument is that there was no constitutional violation, because to the extent OCCF's on-arrival strip\nsearch policy reached accused felons, it was constitutional. I disagree.\nThe Second Circuit has held that blanket policies subjecting all newly-arrested misdemeanor detainees in a local\ncorrectional facility to visual body cavity searches are unconstitutional. Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64-65 (2d\nCir.2001); Wachtler v. County of Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77, 82 (2d Cir.1994); Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66 (2d\nCir.1988); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.1986). In order for a visual body cavity search to be found\nreasonable under the circumstances, there must be some \"`particularized suspicion,' arising either from the\nnature of the charge or specific circumstances relating to the arrestee and/or the arrest.\" Weber, 804 F.2d at 802\n(citing United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 540, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985)).\nSergeant Zappolo's testimony establishes that the OCCF officials made no particularized assessment of the need\nto strip search new arrivals. From this, plaintiffs argue that OCCF's strip search policy pertaining to new arrivals in\nunconstitutional.\nDefendants first argue that this line of cases is no longer good law, because Supreme Court \"impliedly\" overruled \nWeber in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). In Turner, the Supreme Court\narticulated the standard for reviewing the constitutionality of prison regulations as whether \"[the regulation] is\nreasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" 482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254.\n\nAs this Court has noted several times before, the Second Circuit ruled long ago that Weber was not inconsistent\nwith Turner because the former involved local jails and the latter dealt with prisons. See Dodge v. County of\nOrange, 209 F.R.D. 65, 75 (2002). Indeed, the dissent in Shain argued, as defendants do here, that Turner\nimpliedly overruled Weber. But the majority rejected that argument, and refused to extend Turner to apply to local\ncorrectional facilities. Shain, 273 F.3d at 65. While I understand that Orange County presses this point again and\nagain to preserve its rights, I am in no position to make any ruling that runs counter to the clear holding of the\nmajority in Shain, and I decline to do so.\n494 Furthermore, even adoption of a deferential posture to the decisions of jail administrators, *494 as required by \nTurner, does not dispense with the Fourth Amendment requirement that all searches, even searches of inmates,\nbe reasonable. \"Prison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the\nConstitution.\" Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). It is difficult to fathom what\nlegitimate penological interest is served by strip searching an arriving detainee when there is no individualized\nreasonable suspicion to believe that he is secreting contraband on his person.\nDefendants' next line of argument is different. They point out that the Second Circuit cases deal specifically with \nmisdemeanor arrestees. Mr. Murcia, however, was arrested for a felony. Defendants argue that it is\nconstitutionally permissible to strip search anyone brought into the facility on a felony charge.\nThe Second Circuit has never spoken to this issue. However, pronouncements by the United States Supreme\nCourt in analogous contexts do not support OCCF's position that reasonable suspicion to strip search accused\nfelons upon arrival at the facility always exists.\nIn the context of Fourth Amendment searches and seizures, the Supreme Court has stated that the distinction\nbetween felonies and misdemeanors \"is minor and often arbitrary.\" Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 14, 105\nS.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985). As explained by the Supreme Court, \"[m]any crimes classified as\nmisdemeanors, or nonexistent, at common law are now felonies,\" and \"numerous misdemeanors involve conduct\nmore dangerous than many felonies.\" Id. The Court found \"the assumption that a `felon' is more dangerous than\na misdemeanant untenable.\" Id.\nCoupling these words with the Second Circuit's strong statements about constitutional protections for strip\nsearches of accused misdemeanants, I conclude that the law in this Circuit does not countenance a policy\nmandating strip searches of all felony arrestees simply because they stand accused of felonies. The\n\"individualized reasonable suspicion\" rule should apply to accused felons as well as misdemeanants upon arrival\nat a local correctional facility. Of course, I do not expect the Court of Appeals to state that strip searches of newly-\narrived felons should be the exception rather than the rule, as it did in Shain. See Shain, 273 F.3d at 63; Dodge,\n209 F.R.D. at 72. Felonies being what they are, I imagine that some combination of the circumstances of the\narrest, nature of the crime charged, and the particular characteristics of the arrestee will render strip searches of\nmany more accused felons legitimate. But not all. For example, forgery and securities fraud are felonies under\nNew York law. N.Y. Penal Law ยง 170.15 (McKinney 1998) (forgery); N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law ยง 352-c(5) (McKinney\n2002) (securities fraud). It is hard to imagine why being accused of these crimes would automatically provide\n[3]\nreasonable suspicion to believe that a detainee was concealing contraband.\n495 This conclusion comports with a post-Turner ruling in one other circuit. In *495Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police\nDep't., 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir.1990), the Ninth Circuit held that a blanket policy requiring visual body cavity\nsearches of all felony detainees was unconstitutional. 901 F.2d at 714. See also Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d\n1437, 1445-46 (9th Cir.1991) (reiterating the unconstitutionality of blanket policy requiring body cavity searches of\nall felony detainees). The Kennedy Court found that \"a felony arrest [did] not alter the level of cause required to\njustify a visual body cavity search\" because the distinction between felony and misdemeanor detainees failed to\naddress the likelihood that an arrestee would be concealing drugs, weapons, or contraband. Kennedy, 901 F.2d\nat 714, 716. The Ninth Circuit noted that officers should consider the nature of the crime charged, not whether the\ncrime is a felony or a misdemeanor. Officers should evaluate whether the crime charged involves violence, drugs,\nor some other feature from which an officer could reasonably suspect that an arrestee was hiding weapons or\n[4]\ncontraband in a body cavity. Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 714.\n\nDefendants offer no evidence that would justify a policy for searching all felony detainees. They do not argue that\nthe OCCF is frequently confronted with contraband smuggled into the facility. There is no testimony that\nunsuspecting arrestees have typically secreted contraband or weapons in their bodies in the past, let alone that\nfelony arrestees are responsible for a greater amount of contraband than misdemeanor arrestees. Defendants'\nargument that the strip search of Mr. Murcia was constitutional as a matter of law, solely and simply because he\nwas arrested for a felony, is unpersuasive. See Kennedy, supra., 901 F.2d at 713 (9th Cir.1990) (\"A glaring\nomission from the [defendant's] justification is any documentation (or even assertion) that felony arrestees have\nattempted to smuggle contraband into the jail in greater frequency than misdemeanor arrestees.\")\nBecause I disagree with defendants that a felony charge automatically provides reasonable suspicion to conduct\na strip search, I also disagree with defendants' argument that plaintiff lacks standing to sue because he was\naccused of a felony. See Shain, 273 F.3d at 66-67 (rejecting defendants' argument that plaintiff did not have\nstanding to sue because the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search of the plaintiff).\n(2) Bigger Is Entitled to Qualified Immunity Because the Law On this\nPoint Was Unsettled at the Time of the Search\nConcluding that a constitutional violation has been established is only the first step in a two-step inquiry. Saucier\nv. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). Sheriff Bigger asserts that he is entitled to\nqualified immunity for Murcia's federal claims arising from the first strip search because reasonable officers in his\nposition would not have known that a policy of strip searching all newly-arrested felons was unconstitutional.\nAlthough the matter is not free from doubt on the unusual facts of this case, I conclude that he is correct.\n496 *496 A government official making a policy decision is entitled to qualified immunity if the law was not clearly\nestablished at the time the determination was made. Poe v. Leonard, 282 F.3d 123 (2d Cir.2000). If the law is\nunclear, \"an official could not reasonably be expected to anticipate subsequent legal developments, nor could he\nfairly be said to `know' that the law forbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.\" Harlow, 457 U.S. 800,\n818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); see also Koch v. Town of Brattleboro, Vermont, 287 F.3d 162,\n165-66 (2d Cir.2002). Furthermore, a supervisor or policy-maker in Bigger's position is only entitled to qualified\nimmunity unless both the law violated by the underling and the supervisory liability doctrine under which plaintiff\nseeks to hold the supervisor liable were clearly established at the time of the violation. Poe, 282 F.3d at 135, and\ncases cited. Plaintiff cannot hold Bigger liable merely by showing that Zappolo committed a constitutional\nviolation by strip searching him without reasonable suspicion. Rather, the focus of the inquiry must be on the\nbehavior of the officer in question, which in this case is Sheriff Bigger. \"Just as [Bigger's] liability depends in part\nupon his action and choices, his eligibility for immunity must depend upon those same choices.\" Poe, 282 F.3d at\n135.\nTo the extent that Bigger's sweeping policy of searching all new arrivals at OCCF swept newly arrested\nmisdemeanor defendants into its ambit, it was clearly unconstitutional 00 if not when made, then at least by the\n97\ntime the last of the Weber-Walsh-Wachtler trilogy was decided in 1994. Shain, 273 F.3d at 59, 66. Maintenance of\nthe policy after that date, insofar as it applied to misdemeanants, could not be shielded by qualified immunity. \nSee, e.g., Murcia, 185 F.Supp.2d at 291; see also Lee v. Perez, 175 F.Supp.2d 673 (S.D.N.Y.2001).\nBut insofar as the policy applied to accused felons, the law was not clear. If Bigger had promulgated a policy that\nmandated strip searching all new arrivals at OCCF who had been arrested for felonies, he would be entitled to\nqualified immunity, on the ground that the law relating to his officers' conduct was and is unsettled. \"[E]ven if the\ninterest asserted by the plaintiff was clearly of a type generally protected by federal law, the defendant is entitled\nto [qualified] immunity as a matter of law if it was not clear at the time of the acts at issue that an exception did\nnot permit those acts.\" Robison v. Via, 821 F.2d 913, 920 (2d Cir.1987).\nOf course, Bigger did not promulgate such a policy. His policy, which Zappolo and other corrections officers\nfollowed to the letter, was to strip search every new arrival at OCCF. Zappolo had no idea whether plaintiff had\n\nbeen arrested for a felony or a misdemeanor. He searched Murcia because he searched everyone, no questions\n[5]\nasked.\nSo Bigger's policy sweeps within its ambit searches that would be both constitutional (or at least arguably\nconstitutional) and clearly unconstitutional if they had been conducted after individualized evaluation. The\nquestion before me 00 which appears to be of first impression 00 is whether Bigger can claim the benefits of\n97 97\nqualified immunity to the extent the policy implicates searches of arriving felony arrestees 00 searches, in other\n97\n497 words, that were *497 not the subject of settled constitutional pronouncement.\nI conclude that Bigger is entitled to qualified immunity in this situation.\nIn essence, plaintiff argues that Bigger cannot acquire qualified immunity by accident. Murcia happened to be an\narrested felon, yes, but he correctly points out that his status played no part in the decision to strip search him. In\nother words, Murcia urges that Bigger cannot enjoy qualified immunity just because his officers might have had\nreasonable suspicion to conduct a strip search, when it is clear that in fact they did not have reasonable\nsuspicion. They were not performing a discretionary act while under a reasonable misapprehension about the\nlaw; they were adhering to a non-discretionary policy of searching everyone.\n[6]\nMurcia's argument is both clever and troubling.  Ultimately, however, it begs the question, which is whether a\nreasonable person in Bigger's position would have known, by virtue of clearly established law, that a search of\nMurcia would violate his constitutional rights 00 not whether Sheriff Bigger should have acted differently in order to\n97\nprotect the clearly established constitutional rights of others. While I conclude that Murcia's Fourth Amendment\nrights were indeed violated by the automatic on-arrival strip search, those rights were not clearly established at\nthe time the search was conducted. The clearly established rights of others are, it seems to me, beside the point.\nI reach this result with some misgivings. Only a few months ago, in Hope v. Pelzer, ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 2508,\n153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002), the United States Supreme Court ruled that conduct could violate clearly established law\neven if the allegedly unconstitutional conduct had not been the subject of a prior court case. I do not think it a\ngreat leap from prior cases to conclude that invasive searches of all new arrestees who arrive at local\ncorrectional facilities 00 whether arrested for a misdemeanor or a felony 00 should be supported by reasonable\n97 97\nparticularized suspicion. Fourth Amendment jurisprudence concerning the reasonableness of strip searches has\nbeen rather consistent for many years.\nHowever, the Supreme Court has also held that the right allegedly violated must be defined at an appropriate\nlevel of specificity before a court can conclude that it was clearly established. Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615,\n119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999),citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97\nL.Ed.2d 523 (1987). In Shain, the Second Circuit at least suggested that there could be a difference between\nstrip searches of felony and misdemeanor arrestees, although is did so only in passing and in the post-\n498 arraignment context. Shain, 273 F.3d at 65 (\"Although a New York felony defendant's post-arraignment detention \n*498 may well be an indicator of an increased security risk. . . .\"). Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, Bigger\nis entitled to the benefit of any doubt about the state of the law. Caldarola v. Calabrese, 298 F.3d 156 (2d\nCir.2002).\nI am especially troubled by the notion that Sheriff Bigger could be entitled to qualified immunity on these facts,\nbecause the blanket policy pursuant to which Murcia was unthinkingly strip searched should have been off the\nbooks years ago. The doctrine of qualified immunity is supposed to protect public officials from being sued for\nconduct that they could not have known was unlawful. Maintenance of OCCF's blanket on-arrival strip search\npolicy was unlawful and no reasonable law enforcement officer could have thought otherwise. But I fail to see\nwhy Murcia 00 who could not recover against Sheriff Bigger if OCCF had timely altered its policy to eliminate\n97\nautomatic strip searches of arriving misdemeanor defendants 00 should reap a windfall based on a knowing\n97\nviolation of someone else's constitutional rights.\nAccording to plaintiff, the County's Monell liability is predicated on its deliberate indifference to the existence of a\nclearly unconstitutional policy. In Shain, the Second Circuit stated that the illegality of the Nassau County sheriff's\npolicy provided the necessary basis for attaching liability to the County. Shain, 273 U.S. at 66; see also Weber,\n804 F.2d at 803. The converse ought to be true as well. Orange County can hardly be liable for being deliberately\n\nindifferent to a policy that had arguably constitutional elements 00 or, more properly, that had elements whose\n97\nunconstitutionality was not clearly established. The claim against the County arising out of Murcia's on-arrival\nsearch is therefore dismissed.\nThe Orange County defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the First Cause of Action is granted to\nthe extent it addresses the first of the three strip searches.\nII. The Second Strip Search of Plaintiff (After Contraband Was\nSuspected in the Bullpen)\nIn Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Support of Summary Judgment, he states that \"the facts establish that\nplaintiff was strip searched as a result of official policy without reasonable cause to conduct the searches.\" (Id. at\n5., emphasis added) However, the circumstances of the second strip search are markedly different from those of\nthe first, and plaintiff cannot conflate them.\nThe undisputed facts reveal that the second strip search occurred because the unnamed corrections officers who\nwere guarding the bullpen area smelled cigarette smoke. Cigarettes are contraband in the facility. No one in the\nbullpen would admit to having a cigarette, so all the occupants of that area were strip searched. Plaintiff alleges\nthat this search, too was conducted pursuant to an unconstitutional \"policy\" of strip searching inmates without\nreasonable cause.\nIt is true, as plaintiff notes, that, \"[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the\nprotections of the Constitution.\" Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). The\nConstitution requires that searches be reasonable under the circumstances, even if performed on individuals who\nare incarcerated. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). If plaintiff had sued\nthe corrections officers who conducted the search of his person, a jury might well have to determine whether they\nhad reasonable suspicion to strip search plaintiff. Controlling contraband is a legitimate penological interest, and\n499 corrections officials generally have the right and duty to control *499 property and possessions within the facility\nunder their supervision. Gittens v. Coughlin, 184 A.D.2d 812, 584 N.Y.S.2d 670 (3d Dep't 1992); see also Jenkins\nv. Senkowski, 221 A.D.2d 779, 634 N.Y.S.2d 224 (3d Dep't 1995); Jarrett v. Westchester County Dep't of Health,\n169 Misc.2d 320, 646 N.Y.S.2d 223 (Sup.Ct. Westchester Co.1996) (holding that there is no constitutional right to\nsmoke in prison). However, plaintiff had been strip searched only a short time before, and no contraband\n(including cigarettes) had been found on his person. Whether it was constitutionally appropriate to strip search\nhim again would depend on a number of factors as to which the record before me is barren of evidence: how long\nafter the first search the officers smelled smoke; how many people were put into the bullpen after plaintiff was\nwhether those individuals had been strip searched before being put in the bullpen; and so on.\nBut plaintiff has not sued the corrections officers who conducted the second strip search on him. They are\nmentioned in the caption as John Doe defendants, but they have are neither been identified nor served, so they\nare not before the Court. The only persons Murcia has named and served with process 00 and hence, the only\n97\nOrange County defendants in this action 00 are Sheriff Bigger and the County. Plaintiff does not contend that\n97\nSheriff Bigger was personally involved in strip searching him; he charges Bigger with making the policy pursuant\nto which he was searched. And he seeks to hold the County liable for the acts of its policy-maker, under Monell.\nSo plaintiff was required, in support of his motion for summary judgment, to establish the existence of some\nunconstitutional policy pursuant to which the second strip search was carried out. If he cannot establish that\nessential element of his claim, \"there can be `no genuine issue as to any material fact,' since a complete failure of\nproof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other facts\nimmaterial.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-33, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).\nPlaintiff has not offered any evidence that would permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that the second strip\nsearch was conducted pursuant to any policy at all. Plaintiff states, in conclusory fashion, that OCCF maintained\na policy of strip searching inmates without reasonable cause; but the only policy for which he offers evidence\n(through Officer Zappolo, his star witness) is the previously-discussed policy of searching every inmate upon\narrival. The second strip search of Murcia at OCCF was not carried out pursuant to that policy; it was conducted\n\nafter plaintiff had been in-processed. Plaintiff offers no evidence of a broader OCCF policy of strip searching\ninmates without individualized reasonable suspicion after that initial search. Indeed, in his Reply Memorandum,\nplaintiff notes that his star witness, Officer Zappolo, \"failed to indicate the terms of the policy, if any, that required\ncavity searches in such circumstances. In fact, he does not even state that such searches were done as a matter\nof policy.\" (Pl.'s Reply Br. at 8.)(emphasis added).\nOf course, as Murcia points out, Defendants' June 13, 2002 memorandum of law, filed prior to the Reply\nMemorandum cited above, asserts (without evidentiary support) that the second search was conducted pursuant\nto facility policy. (See Memo of Law at 17.) So perhaps there is some policy at OCCF that mandates strip\nsearches of inmates who are present in areas where the presence of contraband is detected. But on the present\nrecord I would only be guessing that such a policy exists, and if it does, I know nothing about its terms. Indeed,\n500 plaintiff does not purport *500 to know the policy's terms; in a further reply memorandum of law prepared at the\nrequest of the Court, plaintiff admits \". . . the terms of this policy remain unknown and the policy itself has not\nbeen identified specifically.\" Plaintiff's September 23, 2002 Memorandum at n. 3. Since I do not know what the\npolicy is, I cannot possibly decide that it is unconstitutional 00 especially as many strip searches of inmates are\n97\nconstitutional. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 546-48, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (jail's policy of\nconducting visual, no contact body cavity strip searches of pre-trial detainees following visits with outsiders does\nnot violate the Fourth Amendment).\nOn this record, I cannot even make the first determination required in a qualified immunity analysis: whether\nplaintiff's allegations establish a constitutional violation. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. Plaintiff sought\nsummary judgment against a policy-maker; plaintiff carries the burden of proving the existence of the policy; and\nplaintiff must demonstrate that the policy is unconstitutional. By conflating the second (and third) strip searches\nwith the on-arrival search, plaintiff has failed to discharge his burden. I must, therefore, deny plaintiff's motion for\nsummary judgment of liability to the extent of the second search.\nThe fact that plaintiff's motion is denied does not mean that I can grant defendants' cross motion, either on the\nmerits or on the ground of qualified immunity. A cross-movant bears the same obligation as the movant 00 to\n97\nsupport its claim to summary judgment with specific evidence. Aside from the unsupported remark of counsel\nquoted above 00 and it should go without saying that counsel is not competent to testify 00 there is nothing in the\n97 97\nrecord that would permit me to decide (1) whether there is a policy or (2) what the policy is. I simply cannot\n[7]\nperform the Saucier analysis on this record.  Thus, defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the second\nsearch is also denied.\nIII. The Third Search: Prior to his transfer to Federal Custody\nPlaintiff claims that he was strip searched a third time before he was transferred to the custody of the U.S.\nMarshals. The Defendants contend that it was the U.S. Marshals who conducted this search, after plaintiff was\ntransferred to their custody. Because there is an issue of fact about who conducted the third strip search, plaintiff\nhas withdrawn his motion for summary judgment regarding that search.\nHowever, unless plaintiff establishes at trial that the third search was not only conducted by OCCF officers, but\nwas carried out pursuant to some unconstitutional policy promulgated by Sheriff Bigger 00 such as a policy of strip\n97\nsearching all departing inmates, or all inmates who are being transferred to other institutions 00 it appears to this\n97\nCourt that Sheriff Bigger and the County will be entitled to a directed verdict, for the reasons discussed above. I\nmention this so that no one will be under any misapprehension about Murcia's burden at trial.\nIV. Unidentified Claims Arising Under State Law\nThe above rulings deal only with the Federal claims in this action. However, in his complaint, plaintiff asserts that\n501 his First Cause of Action arises under the *501 Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution \"and the\nLaws of the United States and the State of New York.\" Plaintiff does not identify the laws of the State of New York\non which he relies.\n\nArt. I, Sec. 12 of the New York State Constitution parallels the Fourth Amendment in prohibiting unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. A brief search of New York case law does not suggest that its protections extend beyond\n[8]\nthose of the Federal constitution in the area of strip searches of arrestees or prisoner.  All the New York cases I\n[9]\nhave found (none of which deals with a situation similar to plaintiff's) either follow  or assume without deciding\n[10]\n that the State law applicable to strip searches of persons arrested for crimes requires reasonable cause\nbefore a strip search can be conducted. Earlier this year, the New York Court of Appeals, in People v. More, 97\nN.Y.2d 209, 738 N.Y.S.2d 667, 764 N.E.2d 967 (2002), suppressed evidence collected from the rectum of an\nindividual who was searched incident to a lawful arrest on a felony narcotics charge, because the police failed to\nobtain a warrant and identified no exigent circumstances that dispensed with the warrant requirement. Schmerber\nv. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). The Court relied extensively on federal case\nlaw interpreting the Fourth Amendment and gave no indication that the State Constitution gave rise to greater\nprotection against custodial strip searches than did the Federal Constitution.\nHowever, the instant case is in an odd posture. The only named Orange County defendants are the Sheriff and\nthe County. Sheriff Bigger did not conduct the search; he made the policy. There being no doctrine of qualified\nimmunity under state law, Sheriff Bigger cannot be absolved of responsibility for the first strip search (which was\nconducted pursuant to his policy) on that ground. Micalizzi v. Ciamarra, 206 F.Supp.2d 564, 581 (S.D.N.Y.2002).\nSimilarly, there is respondeat superior liability for municipalities under State law, so if Sheriff Bigger is liable for a\nviolation of State law, the County is also liable. Hacker v. City of New York, 26 A.D.2d 400, 275 N.Y.S.2d 146\n(N.Y.App.Div.1966),aff'd20 N.Y.2d 722, 283 N.Y.S.2d 46, 229 N.E.2d 613 (N.Y.1967)cert. denied390 U.S. 1036,\n88 S.Ct. 1436, 20 L.Ed.2d 296 (1968). Unfortunately, no one 00 not plaintiff, not defendants 00 has briefed any\n97 97\nState law issues, despite their mutual request that I grant them summary judgment.\nI asked the parties to address questions of state law in supplemental briefs. Plaintiff responded with the following\nfootnote:\nPlaintiff withdraws these claims from consideration in this motion given that the New York State\nConstitution's proscription regarding unreasonable searches and seizures is generally interpreted\nin concert with the Fourth Amendment requirements and prohibitions. It remains however, that\n502 enlargements of the Fourth Amendment's protections *502 have been enacted under the New\nYork Constitution where a compelling state interest has been shown. As such, Plaintiff does not\nwish to voluntarily withdraw these claims so as to retain an opportunity to perfect an appeal and\nan accompanying request for certification of the question (i.e., New York State's own protections\nagainst cavity searches by government officials) to the Court of Appeals.\nI assume that plaintiff refers to the New York Court of Appeals, not the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit.\nPlaintiff correctly (if obliquely) identifies the forum in which issues of New York constitutional law ought to be\nlitigated 00 the courts of the State of New York. Of course, plaintiff has the ability to raise those issues in Federal\n97\ncourt, but he has not only declined my invitation to address these issues on their merits but expressed a clear\ninterest in having the issue decided in the proper forum. I am happy to oblige him. I decline to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff's First Cause of Action to the extent it purports to arise under the\nConstitution and law of the State of New York, on the ground that these claims, by plaintiff's own admission, raise\na novel issue of State law as to which the New York's courts should speak in the first instance. 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367\n(c)(1).\nV. The Motion to Strike Defendants' Affirmative Defenses is Denied\nUnder Rule 12(f), \"a court may order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant,\nimmaterial, impertinent or scandalous matter.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f). This action should not be taken lightly.\nHowever, it may be appropriate where the defense shown is totally insufficient as a matter of law. Lipsky v.\nCommonwealth United Corp., 551 F.2d 887, 893 (2d Cir.1976) (citing Gleason v. Chain Serv. Rest., 300 F.Supp.\n\n1241 (S.D.N.Y.1969)). Upon a showing that there exist no questions of law or fact that would allow the defense to\nsucceed and that inclusion of the defense would be prejudicial, such defenses must be stricken. Salcer v.\nEnvicon Equities Corp., 744 F.2d 935, 939 (2d Cir.1984),vacated on other grounds,478 U.S. 1015, 106 S.Ct.\n3324, 92 L.Ed.2d 731 (1986); see also Byas v. New York City Dept. of Correction, 173 F.R.D. 385, 388\n(S.D.N.Y.1997) (citing Salcer, 744 F.2d at 939); SEC v. Toomey, 866 F.Supp. 719, 722 (S.D.N.Y.1992).\nPlaintiff moves to strike defendants' defenses of reasonable suspicion, constitutional compliance, and good faith,\n[11]\nall of which apply to the First Cause of Action.  Since issues of reasonable suspicion, constitutional\ncompliance and qualified immunity are very much to be considered as we evaluate plaintiff's right to recover for\nthe second and third strip searches, I deny plaintiff's motions to strike these affirmative defenses.\nVI. Plaintiff's Second Cause of Action\nFinally, Murcia pleads a second cause of action, in negligence. The parties have not briefed this issue, although it\nappears to the Court that the claim may be legally insufficient. I have no basis to address it at this time, although I\nwill of course entertain a motion on the law made at the end of plaintiff's case.\nThis constitutes the decision and order of the Court.\n[1] The City of Newburgh contests that Mr. Murcia was strip searched while in its custody. Because there is a\nclear issue of fact on this question, neither the plaintiff nor the City of Newburgh (or Officer Perez) has brought a\nsummary judgment motion related to the strip search at the Newburgh police station.\n[2] In a letter dated July 12, 2002, defendants asked that the Court consider their opposition to plaintiff's summary\njudgment motion as a cross-motion for summary judgment because of plaintiff's \"strong reliance on cases from\nthe Ninth Circuit in furtherance of their motion for partial summary judgment against Orange County and Sheriff\nBigger.\" I granted defendants' request to convert their opposition into a cross-motion for summary judgment with\nrespect to plaintiff's claims that he was strip searched upon arrival at the OCCF pursuant to an unconstitutional\nstrip search policy. I also interpreted this letter as a motion for summary judgment based on Sheriff Bigger's\nqualified immunity from claims based on this strip search.\n[3] In this regard, the fact that Murcia was arrested for bail jumping is unenlightening. Whether that particular\nfelony arrest gave rise to reasonable suspicion would depend, it seems to me, on the nature of the underlying\ncrime. In Murcia's case, the underlying charge was drug-related; while it appears that Officer Zappolo was\nunaware of that fact 00 and while it played no part in the decision to strip search Murcia 00 I recognize that a strip\n97 97\nsearch of a bail jumping drug defendant might well be constitutionally compliant. It is not necessary for me to\nreach this issue, however, because I conclude that qualified immunity cloaks Bigger, and hence the County, from\nliability.\n[4]Kennedy is generally cited as having been \"impliedly overruled\" by the United States Supreme Court in Hunter\nv. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991). However, Kennedy was not overruled on the\npoint at issue in this case, which is the propriety of automatically strip searching persons arrested for felonies.\nHunter had the effect of overruling the other part of the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Kennedy, which addressed the\npropriety of submitting qualified immunity questions to a jury. The issue I am deciding in this opinion was not even\nraised in Hunter.\n[5] This is consistent with the state of the record in Lee v. Perez, 175 F.Supp.2d 673 (S.D.N.Y.2001), in which\nanother Orange County Corrections Officer testified that he conducted strip searches of all arriving inmates\nwithout checking paperwork to see what charges had been lodged against them, because everyone who arrived\nat OCCF got strip searched.\n[6] It has also been lurking in the background in my prior OCCF and City of Newburgh strip search cases. The\nissue was not squarely raised until now because the plaintiffs in all the other cases before me were arrested for\nmisdemeanors, not felonies. Also, we have not yet gotten beyond general constitutional questions and into the\nparticulars of specific searches in cases like Dodge v. County of Orange, supra, and Maneely v. City of\n\nNewburgh, 208 F.R.D. 69 (S.D.N.Y.2002). I have no doubt that when the defendants in those actions assert that\nthe circumstances of particular cases gives rise to reasonable suspicion that those misdemeanor arrestees\nshould be strip searched, plaintiffs will counter that defendants ought not escape liability because of what they \nmight have done but did not do 00 make an individualized assessment in each arrestee's case. Whether \"what\n97\nmight have been\" proves a bar to liability or merely goes to damages is a fascinating question. Fortunately, I need\nnot consider it today.\n[7] Just so it is clear, I am not denying Sheriff Bigger qualified immunity. The state of the record precludes me\nfrom reaching the question, because the state of the record precludes me from determining what Saucier\nidentifies as the predicate issue 00 whether any constitutional violation was committed.\n97\n[8] In a recent decision, the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, asserted that the New York court of Appeals\nhad interpreted the State Constitution to \"impose[] some limits on such searches [incident to a lawful arrest] not\nfound under the Fourth Amendment, particularly in the area of minor traffic violations. ...\" People v. Taylor, 294\nA.D.2d 825, 741 N.Y.S.2d 822 (4th Dep't 2002), citing People v. Marsh, 20 N.Y.2d 98, 101, 281 N.Y.S.2d 789, 228\nN.E.2d 783, ___, (N.Y.1967). I find Marsh completely consonant with Second Circuit jurisprudence concerning\nstrip searches of misdemeanor arrestees.\n[9]See, e.g., Young v. Coombe, 227 A.D.2d 799, 642 N.Y.S.2d 443 (3d Dep't 1996).\n[10]People v. Martinez, 268 A.D.2d 266, 701 N.Y.S.2d 377 (1st Dep't 2000)(\"Assuming, without deciding, that\nreasonable suspicion was required to conduct the search at issue, ...\") citing Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d\nCir.1986)\n[11] Sheriff Bigger has withdrawn his affirmative defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. (Def's. Mem. in Opp. to\nPl's Motion for Partial Summ.
