    "summary": "<p>On July 22, 1992, nine pre-trial detainees who had been arrested in connection with a non-violent civil disobedience protest filed a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, challenging the conditions of their confinement at the Schuylkill County Prison.  Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that they suffered violations of their constitutional rights in that: (1) they were subjected to strip and body cavity searches pursuant to a blanket strip search policy implemented by Schuylkill County; (2) they were required to double-up in cells designed for one inmate and were forced to sleep on mattresses on cell floors; and (3) they had restricted access to telephones during an initial 48-hour \"lockdown\" period.</p><p>Discovery ensued and, on August 3, 1993, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  On September 16, 1993, the District Court (Judge Franklin S. Van Antwerpen) granted Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment with respect to the strip search and \"double-celling\" claims and granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the restricted telephone use claim.  Specifically, with respect to the strip search claim, the Court found that (a) the County's blanket strip and body cavity search policy violated Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights, (b) the County was liable for adopting the policy, and (c) the individual defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to these claims.  Similarly, with respect to the double-celling claim, the Court found that (a) the practice violated Due Process and (b) qualified immunity was not a viable defense.  With respect to the restricted telephone use claim, however, the Court found that the practice did not violate constitutional rights.  Newkirk v. Sheers, 834 F.Supp. 772 (E.D.Pa. 1993).</p><p>Shortly after the Court's ruling, the parties entered into a Consent Decree, which the Court approved on January 12, 1994.  Details of the Decree were not reflected by the PACER docket, and we have no further information regarding its terms.</p><p></p>",

Pennsylvania. \nSeptember 16, 1993. \n773*773 774*774 Steve D. Shadowen, Gordon A. Einhorn, Schnader, Harrison, Segal & \nLewis, Harrisburg, PA, for plaintiffs. \nDavid L. Schwalm, Thomas, Thomas & Hafer, Harrisburg, PA, for defendants. \nOPINION AND ORDER \nVAN ANTWERPEN, District Judge. \nThis 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 action is brought by nine plaintiffs,[1] against local government \ndefendants in their official and individual capacities.[2] The plaintiffs instituted this civil rights \naction by filing a Complaint on July 22, 1992. Following the filing of a Motion to Dismiss by \ndefendants, plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on October 6, 1992. On November 13, \n1992, Defendants filed their Answer to the plaintiffs' Amended Complaint. \nAfter completing discovery, the parties reached an agreement and stipulated to the \ndismissal of various claims. In the parties' court approved Stipulation filed on August 3, \n1993, plaintiffs agreed to dismiss with prejudice Counts II, IV, VII, VIII, IX and X of the \nAmended Complaint. The parties also decided to dismiss with prejudice Count I of plaintiffs' \nAmended Complaint except for the claims relating to plaintiffs sleeping on mattresses on \nthe floor of single inmate cells. Finally, the parties were able to reach a tentative agreement \nwith respect to Count XI of the Amended Complaint. \nAccordingly, based upon the Stipulation of the parties, the only remaining claims to be \nresolved by this court are the claims in Count I relating to plaintiffs sleeping on mattresses \non cell floors, Count III relating to restrictions on plaintiffs' use of the telephone during a 48-\nhour \"lockdown\" period immediately following their arrest, and Counts V and VI relating to \nplaintiffs' claims regarding the strip search procedures adopted and followed at the \nSchuylkill County Prison. With respect to these claims, the parties have entered into a \nStipulated Statement of Facts. \nBefore the court now are the parties' cross summary judgment motions, which were both \nfiled on August 3, 1993. Both parties maintain in their briefs that there are no outstanding \nmaterial issues of fact. Based upon the parties' Stipulated Statement of Facts and for the \n\n \nreasons that follow, we will grant plaintiffs' motion in part and deny it in 775*775 part and \ngrant defendants' motion in part and deny it in part. \nI. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD \nThe court shall render summary judgment \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is \nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \nas a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). An issue is \"genuine\" only if there is a sufficient \nevidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party. Anderson \nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A \nfactual dispute is \"material\" only if it might affect the outcome of the suit under governing \nlaw. Id. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510. All inferences must be drawn and all doubts resolved in \nfavor of the non-moving party. United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. \n993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962); Gans v. Mundy, 762 F.2d 338, 341 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, \n474 U.S. 1010, 106 S.Ct. 537, 88 L.Ed.2d 467 (1985). \nOn motion for summary judgment, the moving party bears the initial burden of identifying for \nthe court those portions of the record that it believes demonstrate the absence of material \nfact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 \n(1986). To defeat summary judgment, the non-moving party must respond with facts of \nrecord that contradict the facts identified by the movant and may not rest on mere denials. \nId. at 321 n. 3, 106 S.Ct. at 2552 n. 3 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)); see First Nat. Bank v. \nLincoln Nat. Life Ins. Co., 824 F.2d 277, 282 (3d Cir.1987). The non-moving party must \ndemonstrate the existence of evidence that would support a jury finding in its favor. See \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 248-49, 106 S.Ct. at 2510-11. \nII. STIPULATED FACTS \nThe parties to this case filed a Stipulated Statement of Facts on August 3, 1993. These \nStipulated Facts are set forth in their entirety and may be summarized as follows. \nPlaintiffs were arrested on September 2, 1991, in connection with a non-violent civil \ndisobedience protest at the Hegins Pigeon Shoot, an annual event held each Labor Day \nweekend since 1934 in Hegins, Pennsylvania. Statement of Stipulated Facts [\"Stip.Facts\"], \nยถยถ 1, 2. Pigeons are placed in boxes from which they are catapulted in the air and then shot \nby contestants. Stip.Facts, ยถ 1. Plaintiffs were arrested after going onto the shooting field in \norder to release pigeons from their boxes and to rescue wounded pigeons that had fallen to \nthe ground. Stip. Facts, ยถ 13. All of the plaintiffs were charged with criminal trespass; \nplaintiffs Prescott and Woods were also charged with theft and receiving stolen property.[3] \nStip. Facts, ยถยถ 15, 16. \nFollowing the arrests, plaintiffs were taken before a District Justice, who ordered those \nplaintiffs refusing to post bail incarcerated as pretrial detainees in the Schuylkill County \nPrison.[4] Stip.Facts ยถ 17. Seven of the plaintiffs remained in the prison from September 2, \n1991 until September 16, 1991, at which time they entered guilty pleas, were fined and/or \nsentenced to time served and released. Stip.Facts, ยถ 18. \n\n \nDuring plaintiffs' detention, they were subjected to various conditions that they allege \nviolated their constitutional rights, including (1) being subjected to strip and body cavity \nsearches pursuant to a blanket strip search policy implemented by Schuylkill County, Stip. \nFacts, ยถยถ 20-36, (2) being required to double-up in cells designed for one inmate and being \nforced to sleep on mattresses on cell floors, Stip.Facts, ยถยถ 37-55, and (3) having restricted \naccess to telephones during an initial 48-hour \"lockdown\" period, Stip.Facts ยถยถ 56-68. \nThe parties have stipulated that we should base our decision upon the following facts: \n1. For 60 years the town of Hegins, Pennsylvania, has hosted an annual contest 776*776 \nshoot of live pigeons on Labor Day. Plaintiffs oppose the pigeon shoot for the following \nreasons: \nEach year the shooters kill or injure more than 6,000 pigeons. The birds are placed inside \nsmall boxes (\"traps\") from which they are catapulted. They are then shot by the contestants. \nMany of the birds are killed outright; the wounded ones are picked up by town children, \nknown as \"trapper boys,\" who twist off the birds' heads or stomp them to death. \nDefendants are not responsible for the pigeon shoot and have not participated in the pigeon \nshoot and are therefore not able to stipulate to the accuracy of the Plaintiffs' reasons. \n2. The Plaintiffs, all of whom were arrested during a protest at the 1991 Hegins Pigeon \nShoot, are Ingrid Newkirk, age 43, Laura Yanne, age 38, Robin Lord, age 41, Heidi \nPrescott, age 35, Robin Walker, age 27, Sue Brebner, age 42, Teresa Gibbs, age 30, Jenny \nWoods, age 31 and Dana Forbes, age 38. \n3. Plaintiffs were aware that a confrontation could occur during which they could be \narrested. Some of the Plaintiffs had previously been arrested and pled guilty to similar \ncharges during similar animal rights protests. \n4. Defendants Paul Sheers, Franklin L. Shollenberger and Mary Ann Conway are the \ncurrent County Commissioners of Schuylkill County. Mary Ann Conway was not a County \nCommissioner during the period of the Plaintiffs' imprisonment and was sworn into office on \nJanuary 6, 1992. She was not responsible for any prison policy making decisions prior to \nthat time. \n5. Defendants the Honorable Joseph F. McCloskey, Claude Shields, Timothy Holden, and \nDonald Kerns are members of the Schuylkill County Prison Board. Louis Wallaver was the \nCourt Administrator but not a member of the Prison Board. \n6. Defendant David Kurtz is Warden of the Schuylkill County Prison. \n7. Defendant Raymond Lorent is Deputy Warden of Schuylkill County Prison. Deputy \nWarden Lorent served as acting Warden during a portion of the period from September 2, to \nSeptember 16, 1991, when Warden Kurtz was absent from Schuylkill County Prison. \n\n \n8. Defendants Elmer Cutler, John Kling, and William Nasados are supervisors at the \nSchuylkill County Prison. They were not involved in any policy making decisions with \nrespect to the Schuylkill County Prison. \n9. Defendants Hilda Laubach, Sandy Medinsky, Linda Neidig, Bernadine DeAngelo, Patricia \nHeckman, Barbara Schwartz, and Carol A. Mickalowski are corrections officers at the \nSchuylkill County Prison and held those positions in September of 1991. Defendant \nKathleen Shartzer was a corrections officer at the Schuylkill County Prison in September of \n1991. They were not involved in any policy making decisions with respect to the Schuylkill \nCounty Prison. \n10. Defendant DeAngelo has been a certified corrections officer since 1985. \n11. Defendant Neidig has been a certified corrections officer since 1985. \n12. Plaintiffs were arrested on various summary offense or misdemeanor charges on \nSeptember 2, 1991, during their participation in a civil disobedience protest at the annual \npigeon shoot in Hegins, Pennsylvania. \n13. Plaintiffs were arrested after going onto the shooting field in order to release pigeons \nfrom their boxes and to rescue wounded pigeons laying on the ground. \n14. Plaintiffs were all charged with criminal trespass as either a summary offense or \nmisdemeanor. \n15. The citation for criminal trespass issued to Plaintiff Lord stated that, in part, the nature of \nthe charge against her was carrying the American flag without privilege to do so. \n16. Plaintiffs Prescott and Woods were also charged with theft and receiving stolen \nproperty. The property involved in both offenses was the pigeons that they were attempting \nto rescue. \n17. Following their arrests, each of the Plaintiffs was taken before a district justice at which \ntime bail was set. Failing to post 777*777 bail, each Plaintiff was then incarcerated as a \npretrial detainee in the Schuylkill County Prison. Some of the Plaintiffs chose not to post bail \nas part of their protest against the pigeon shoot. \n18. Plaintiffs Ingrid Newkirk, Heidi Prescott, Robin Walker, Sue Brebner, Teresa Gibbs, \nJenny Woods and Dana Forbes remained in the Prison from September 2, 1991, until \nSeptember 16, 1991, at which time they entered guilty pleas, were fined and/or sentenced \nto time served, and released. Plaintiff Laura Yanne posted bail and was released from \nprison on September 3, 1991, and subsequently entered a guilty plea. \n19. Plaintiff Robin Lord was released on bail on September 3, 1991. The charges against \nher were eventually dismissed. \nStrip and Visual Body Cavity Searches \n\n \n20. Upon their arrival at the Prison on September 2, 1991, between the hours of 5:30 p.m. \nand 9:15 p.m., each Plaintiff was subjected to a \"pat\" search followed by a strip and visual \nbody cavity search performed by a female corrections officer. This search was performed as \npart of the admission process that included obtaining medical information, photographing, \nfingerprinting and providing each Plaintiff with prison clothes. \n21. Each Plaintiff was taken by a female corrections officer into the Prison Property Room, \ninstructed to remove all her clothing, and ordered to turn her back to the corrections officer, \nbend over at the waist, and spread her buttocks. \n22. The strip and visual body cavity searches of Plaintiffs Newkirk, Brebner, Gibbs, Lord, \nPrescott, Walker and Woods were conducted by corrections officer Bernadine DeAngelo. \nThe strip and visual body cavity searches of Dana Forbes and Laura Yanne were \nconducted by either corrections officer Linda Neidig or corrections officer Bernadine \nDeAngelo. Neidig performed at least one of those searches. \n23. The strip and visual body cavity searches were performed pursuant to the officially \nadopted policy of Schuylkill County requiring that all individuals admitted as prisoners into \nSchuylkill County Prison, including pretrial detainees, undergo strip and visual body cavity \nsearches. Pursuant to this policy, all pretrial detainees undergo this search without regard to \nthe offense with which they have been charged, their prior record, or any specific suspicion \nof concealment of contraband. \n24. This strip search policy is set forth in the Policy and Procedures Manual of the Schuylkill \nCounty Prison. This manual was revised by Warden Kurtz. The policy also appears in the \nRules and Regulations handbook of the Schuylkill County Prison. The handbook was \nwritten by Warden Kurtz. Both of these documents were approved by the Schuylkill County \nPrison Board and the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. \n25. The Schuylkill County Prison Rules and Regulations provide: \nD. You will undergo search procedures as follows: \n1. Full search of all clothing and personal articles โ including dismantling if necessary. \n2. Full body (strip) search of your person for the purpose of locating contraband, identifying \ninjuries, and marks of identification. \n26. The strip searches were also conducted in reliance upon 37 Pa.Code ยง 95.222(b)(1), \nwhich provides: \nThe following are the recommended guidelines concerning the admission process: \nEach prisoner admitted shall be stripped and searched for weapons and contraband. The \nsearch should also include a check for body vermin, and for cuts, bruises, needle scars, and \nother injuries. The strip search should be conducted in a professional non-humiliating \nmanner, and for security and privacy reasons, the search should be conducted in an area \nwhere the prisoner is in view of only those officers in charge of the search. \n\n \n27. The purpose of the strip search is to search for weapons, contraband and check for any \ninjuries or marks on the body. \n28. The searches of the Plaintiffs were conducted solely on the basis of Prison policy and \nwere not based upon any specific suspicion 778*778 that any of the Plaintiffs was \nconcealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband. \n29. Plaintiffs were given copies of the Rules and Regulations handbook upon their arrival at \nthe Prison. \n30. None of the Plaintiffs has ever been arrested for offenses involving weapons or drugs. \n31. At the time Plaintiffs were processed into the Prison, Defendants did not know whether \nor not Plaintiffs had prior criminal records. \n32. Prior to September 2, 1991, inmates had attempted to smuggle contraband into the \nSchuylkill County Prison in body cavities on several occasions. \n33. Pursuant to prison policy, Plaintiffs Woods, Forbes, Prescott, Brebner, Newkirk, and \nGibbs underwent a second strip search when they returned from their court hearings of \nSeptember 16, 1991. These searches were performed by Defendant Barbara Schwartz. \n34. None of the Plaintiffs were physically touched during the strip searches that were \ncarried out. \n35. Defendants Neidig and DeAngelo acknowledge that they know there is a difference in \nlegal status between convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees. \n36. During the search of Plaintiff Prescott on September 2, 1991, corrections officer \nDeAngelo ordered her to remove her tampon and to place the soiled tampon in a bag held \nby DeAngelo. \nMattresses on the Floor \n37. Each of the Plaintiffs was housed in Cell Block A, the women's cell block at Schuylkill \nCounty Prison. \n38. Cell Block A contains 12 cells, each of which has one bed. \n39. The inmate population of Cell Block A on the night of September 2, 1991, was 26 \ninmates. \n40. Between September 3 and September 16, 1991, the inmate population of Cell Block A \nranged from 16 to 22 persons. \n41. During their detention, all but two of the Plaintiffs were at some time required to sleep on \nPrison mattresses placed on the floor. These mattresses are six feet long by three feet wide \n\n \nand four inches thick. On the night of September 2, 1991, the mattresses were placed either \non the floor of the single-occupant cells or on the floor of the Day Room of the Cell Block. \nSubsequent to September 2, all mattresses were placed in cells. \n42. The need for use of mattresses existed because of the unanticipated influx of female \ninmates on September 2, 1991. During prior years, the prison had not received pretrial \ndetainees as a result of any protest of the Hegins Pigeon Shoot. \n43. Plaintiff Newkirk spent 1 night on a mattress on the floor in the Day Room and 13 nights \non a mattress on the floor in a cell; Plaintiff Gibbs spent 14 nights on a mattress on a cell \nfloor; Plaintiff Woods spent 14 nights on a mattress on a cell floor; Plaintiff Forbes spent 1 \nnight on a mattress on the floor in the common area and thereafter in a cell bed; Plaintiff \nYanne spent 1 night on a mattress on the floor in the common area and was released the \nfollowing day; Plaintiff Walker spent approximately 6 nights on a mattress on the cell floor \nand thereafter in a cell bed; Plaintiff Brebner spent approximately 6 nights in a cell bed \nfollowed by approximately 8 nights on a mattress on a cell floor. \n44. Plaintiffs who slept on mattresses placed on the cell floors had a choice of sleeping with \ntheir heads toward the back wall or toward the cell toilet. \n45. On or prior to September 2, 1991, the Prison obtained 25 canvas cots from Emergency \nManagement Services at Indiantown Gap. The cots were designed so that an inmate slept \ndirectly on the canvas. \n46. The canvas cots obtained were initially set up in the Prison gymnasium to accommodate \nthe expected arrival of male arrestees from the protest at the Hegins Pigeon Shoot. \n47. On the evening of September 2, 1991, only six male detainees were housed in the \ngymnasium. \n779*779 48. On the evening of September 2, 1991, there were 19 unused canvas cots in \nthe Prison gymnasium. \n49. After September 2, 1991, the male arrestees housed in the gymnasium were either \nmoved into cell blocks or released and thereafter no cots were required for the use of male \nprisoners. \n50. After September 2, 1991, the 25 canvas cots were placed in storage at the Prison, and \nthey remained there for the duration of the Plaintiffs' incarceration. \n51. None of the canvas cots obtained by the Prison was made available to Plaintiffs. \n52. Defendants made no effort to obtain additional canvas cots between September 2 and \nSeptember 16, 1991. \n53. There are no physical limitations that prevented placing canvas cots in the cells or the \nDay Room of Cell Block A. \n\n \n54. Warden Kurtz was aware that certain Plaintiffs were sleeping on mattresses on the floor. \n55. Deputy Warden Lorent knew that certain Plaintiffs were sleeping on the floor and that \ncanvas cots were in storage at the prison. He did not have the canvas cots taken to Cell \nBlock A because, \"no one asked for them.\" \nAccess to Telephones \n56. After their hearings before the District Justice on September 2, 1991, at which bail was \nset, Plaintiffs had no opportunity to use the telephone before being taken to the prison. \n57. Upon their arrival at the Prison, the Plaintiffs were placed in \"48-hour lock-up.\" A \nprisoner in 48-hour lock-up is locked in her cell for 48 hours except for an orientation \nmeeting with a counselor and a medical screening. The 48-hour lock-up is done for the \npurpose of quarantining inmates for medical reasons and psychological reasons for the \nprotection of the inmate, other inmates, and prison employees. \n58. During Plaintiffs' 48-hour lock-up, Defendants Neidig, DeAngelo, Laubach, Medinsky, \nSchwartz and Shartzer worked in Cell Block A. \n59. Pursuant to Prison policy, prisoners in 48-hour lock-up do not have access to the \ntelephone in the cell block. \n60. Prisoners in 48-hour lock-up may only use the telephone in the cell block in the case of \nan emergency and in the discretion of the supervisor. During this time, non-emergency calls \nare not permitted on the cell block phones. \n61. The Rules and Regulations handbook issued to all prisoners, including Plaintiffs, states \nas follows: \nAny individual committed to Schuylkill County Prison will be placed in a 48-hour lock-up \nstatus until an orientation is done with him by the counselor, and he is medically screened. \nWhile in this status, prior to his releases (sic) in population, he will be granted only the \nfollowing: \na. Personal phone call for bail or emergency. \nb. Shower afforded every other day. \n62. The prisoner's first phone call generally occurs during the prisoner's orientation session \nwith the counselor. \n63. The Schuylkill County Prison Rules and Regulations provides: \n2. Telephone \n\n \nA. Admission โ You may make calls for bail and attorney, and family notification when \ninterviewed by Treatment staff. Bail calls prior to this contract may be made with permission \nof Supervisor. All long distance calls are made \"collect\". \nB. Regular Status โ Upon release into regular population, you will be eligible for \nparticipation in the Inmate Collect Call System available in all dayroom areas. Any abuse of \nphone or use of abusive language will result in loss of phone privileges. This privilege is \nrevoked automatically if confined for disciplinary infractions. Hours are posted. \nC. Emergency Calls โ Permission for special phone calls must be made by the Supervisor, \nDeputy Warden or Warden only!! These are for only the most urgent circumstances. \n780*780 D. Incoming Calls โ The Prison will not accept phone messages for inmates. \nExceptions are made for verifiable emergencies concerning an inmate's family or from a \nlegal agency. \n64. Each Plaintiff (other than Lord and Yanne who were released on September 3, 1991) \nhad an orientation session with a Prison counselor during her second day of detention. \nDuring their orientation sessions, Plaintiffs Prescott, Walker, Brebner, Gibbs, Woods, and \nForbes were permitted to complete one telephone call. In cases where a Plaintiff received a \nbusy signal or no answer, she was permitted to call other numbers until one call was \ncompleted. Plaintiffs were given no indication that additional calls would be permitted. \n65. In her orientation session, Plaintiff Newkirk made one call to her attorney and was \npermitted to return a call to a reporter. \n66. The prison does not prohibit attorney visits during 48-hour lock-up status. When \nPlaintiffs were in 48-hour lock-up status in September of 1991, Plaintiff Prescott was \npermitted to meet with an attorney on one occasion and Plaintiff Newkirk was permitted to \nmeet with an attorney on two occasions. \n67. The Defendant corrections officers told Plaintiffs that they could not use the telephone \nlocated in the cell block until their 48-hour lock-up status had ended. Plaintiffs made no \nphone calls during 48-hour lock-up other than those calls permitted during the orientation \nsession. \n68. None of the Plaintiffs filed a complaint with prison official regarding use of the telephone. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nMindful of plaintiffs' allegations and the standard of review under which we must review \nthem, we now turn to the plaintiffs' case. \nPlaintiffs' Constitutional Rights \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides redress only for infringements of rights \"secured by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States.\" Davidson v. O'Lone, 752 F.2d 817, 821 (3d \nCir.1984) (en banc), aff'd sub. nom., Davidson v. Cannon, 474 U.S. 344, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 \n\n \nL.Ed.2d 677 (1986). A threshold requirement in virtually every ยง 1983 action is the \nidentification of which constitutional right a plaintiff seeks to vindicate. \nThe remaining claims in this ยง 1983 action rely on the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments. Additionally, in some of plaintiffs' papers, reference is made to the Eighth \nAmendment. It is beyond dispute, however, that the eighth amendment does not apply to \npretrial detainees. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1872 n. 16, 60 \nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979); Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 671 n. 40, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 1412 n. \n40, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977). Accordingly, if any of plaintiffs' constitutional rights were \nimplicated in this case, they must have arisen under the first, fourth, or fourteenth \namendments. \nCriteria for evaluating the conditions of a pretrial detainee's confinement were established in \nBell. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that a government can, in accordance with due \nprocess, incarcerate an individual charged with a criminal offense prior to an adjudication of \nguilt so long as the conditions of pretrial detention do not amount to punishment of the \ndetainee. Id. 441 U.S. at 535, 99 S.Ct. at 1871-72. Where punishment of a detainee is \nmanifest, however, the detainee has been deprived of liberty without due process of law. Id. \nIn deference to valid considerations of prison administration, the Bell court acknowledged \nthat \"not every disability imposed during pretrial detention amounts to `punishment' in the \nconstitutional sense.\" Id. at 537, 99 S.Ct. at 1873. Accordingly, a district court evaluating the \nconstitutionality of the conditions of a person's pretrial confinement \"must decide whether [a] \ndisability is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some \nother legitimate governmental purpose.\" Id. at 538, 99 S.Ct. at 1873. \"[I]n the absence of a \nshowing of intent to punish,[5] a court must look to see if a particular restriction or condition, \nwhich may on its face appear to be 781*781 punishment, is instead but an incident of a \nlegitimate nonpunitive governmental objective.\" Id. at 539, n. 20, 99 S.Ct. at 1874, n. 20. \n[I]f a particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention is reasonably related to a \nlegitimate governmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to `punishment.' \nConversely, if a restriction or condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal โ if it is \narbitrary or purposeless โ a court permissibly may infer that the purpose of the \ngovernmental action is punishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees \nqua detainees. \nId. at 539, 99 S.Ct. at 1874 (citation omitted). \nCourts determining whether conditions and restrictions imposed on pretrial detainees are \nreasonably related to a legitimate government purpose: \nmust heed [the Supreme Court's] warning that \"[s]uch considerations are peculiarly within \nthe province and professional expertise of corrections officials, and, in the absence of \nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their \nresponse to these considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in \nsuch matters.\" \n\n \nId. at 540, n. 23, 99 S.Ct. at 1875, n. 23 (quoting Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 827, 94 \nS.Ct. 2800, 2806, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974)). Even when limitations on a pretrial detainee's \nfreedom are rationally related to a legitimate nonpunitive governmental purpose, they will \namount to punishment if \"they appear excessive in relation to that purpose.\" Bell, 441 U.S. \nat 561, 99 S.Ct. at 1886. \nThe rights of pretrial detainees announced by the Supreme Court in Bell were recognized \nand applied in the Third Circuit long before the incarceration of these ten female plaintiffs at \nSchuylkill County Prison. In Union County Jail Inmates v. Di Buono, 713 F.2d 984 (3d \nCir.1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1102, 104 S.Ct. 1600, 80 L.Ed.2d 130 (1984), the Third \nCircuit strictly adhered to the teachings of Bell when it described the following procedure for \ndetermining whether conditions imposed on a pre-trial detainee amounted to punishment: \nin determining ... whether conditions ... are such as to amount to punishment, which would \nviolate the due process rights of pre-trial detainees, we must ask, first, whether any \nlegitimate purposes are served by these conditions, and, second, whether these conditions \nare rationally related to these purposes. In assessing whether the conditions are reasonably \nrelated to the assigned purposes, we must, further, inquire as to whether these conditions \ncause [inmates] to endure [such] genuine privations and hardship over an extended period \nof time, that the adverse conditions become excessive in relation to the purposes assigned \nfor them. \nId. at 992 (quotations and citations omitted). \nIf a restriction appears to be unrelated to a legitimate governmental objective, and is, for \nexample, arbitrary or purposeless, then a court may infer that it is intended to be \npunishment. Bell, 441 U.S. at 538, 99 S.Ct. at 1874. Legitimate governmental interests \ninclude ensuring the detainee's appearance at trial, as well as maintaining security and \norder at the prison facility. Id. at 540, 99 S.Ct. at 1874. However, even if the restrictions \nwere reasonably related to a legitimate purpose, but yet excessive in relation to that \npurpose, the court may infer an intent to punish. Id. at 538, 99 S.Ct. at 1873-74. \nWe now turn to the particular conditions at issue in this case: \nA. Adequacy of Sleeping Space \nIn the remaining outstanding claim in Count I of the plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, plaintiffs \ncharge that defendants, acting under color of state law, forced seven of the plaintiffs both to \ndouble-up in cells designed for a single inmate and to sleep on mattresses on the floor of \nthose cells for differing periods of time throughout their incarceration at Schuylkill County \nPrison.[6] 782*782 Five of the seven plaintiffs were forced to sleep adjacent to the cell \ntoilets, and although plaintiffs did not stipulate to the exact measurements of the cells, the \nparties' description leaves us with the impression that it was quite a small area. Stip.Facts, ยถ \n44. Moreover, prison officials double-celled[7] these seven plaintiffs even though the Prison \nhad available a supply of canvas cots and had, in fact, set up the cots in the Prison \ngymnasium with the expectation that a sudden influx of male prisoners might be admitted \nfrom the planned protest at the Hegins Pigeon Shoot. Stip.Facts, ยถยถ 45, 46. \n\n \nPrison officials had a sufficient supply of cots to set up for the newly admitted female \ninmates but had made no similar arrangement for the women as they had prepared for male \ninmates. Prison officials agreed that there were no physical limitations preventing them from \nsetting up these cots in the female cell block's Day Room. Stip. Facts, ยถยถ 48, 53. \nThe Supreme Court has held that \"double-bunking\" does not constitute a per se violation of \na pretrial detainee's due process rights. Bell 441 U.S. at 541, 99 S.Ct. at 1875. The Court \nleft open the possibility, however, that \"confining a given number of people in a given \namount of space in such a manner as to cause them to endure genuine privations and \nhardship over an extended period of time might raise serious questions under the Due \nProcess Clause as to whether those conditions amounted to punishment....\" Id. at 542, 99 \nS.Ct. at 185-76. \nIn Lareau v. Manson, 651 F.2d 96 (2d Cir.1981), the Second Circuit held that double-\nbunking of pretrial detainees was constitutionally permissible for a period of no more than \nfifteen days, but the use of floor mattresses constituted punishment \"without regard to the \nnumber of days for which a prisoner is so confined.\" Id. at 105. The Third Circuit echoed \nthis sentiment in Di Buono, 713 F.2d at 996-97, stating that the \"unsanitary and humiliating\" \npractice of forcing detainees to sleep on mattresses on the floor does not pass \nconstitutional muster. In that case, the Third Circuit concluded that \"of all the various \nconditions challenged as being unconstitutional, the most significant, and indeed the only \ncondition not meeting constitutional standards, was the practice of placing a mattress on the \nfloor for the second occupant of a cell designed for but one inmate.\" Id. at 994. The clear \nimplication of the court's language was that double-celling would only be constitutionally \npermissible if it were used in exigent circumstances for extremely brief periods of time. With \nrespect to the use of floor mattresses in prisons, see also Anela v. Wildwood, 790 F.2d \n1063 (3d Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 949, 107 S.Ct. 434, 93 L.Ed.2d 384 (1986) \n(absence of mattresses unconstitutional in light of Lareau and Di Buono, supra, finding floor \nmattresses unconstitutional for pretrial detainees); Lyons v. Powell, 838 F.2d 28 (1st Cir. \n1988) (pretrial detainee's allegation that he was forced to sleep on floor mattress sufficient \ncondition to show deprivation of due process); Young v. Keohane, 809 F.Supp. 1185 \n(M.D.Pa.1992) (overcrowded conditions, including being confined to a room housing eleven \ninmates and being forced to sleep on cots on the floor, amounted to punishment); Inmates \nof Allegheny County Jail v. Wecht, 565 F.Supp. 1278 (W.D.Pa.1983), aff'd in rel. part, 754 \nF.2d 120 (3d Cir.1985) (totality of conditions at prison resulting from overcrowding, including \nuse of floor mattresses, rose to level of constitutional violation for both pretrial detainees \nand inmates). \nAccording to the stipulated facts in this case, plaintiffs Newkirk, Gibbs and Woods spent \nbetween thirteen and fourteen nights on a mattress on a cell floor, while plaintiffs Walker \nand Brebner spent between six and eight nights under the same conditions. We feel that the \nevidence does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation with regard 783*783 to \nplaintiffs Yanne and Forbes because they spent only one night on a mattress on a floor and \nthe mattress was not located in a cell. As explained above, the Third Circuit clearly has \nprovided that subjecting pretrial detainees to the use of floor mattresses for anything other \nthan brief emergency circumstances may constitute an impermissible imposition of \npunishment, thereby violating the due process rights of such detainees. Di Buono, 713 F.2d \nat 994. See also, Anela, supra. In the present case, prison officials knew of the possibility of \n\n \na sudden influx of new prisoners and had attempted to accommodate prisoners adequately, \nhowever, these modifications were made only for male prisoners. No attempt was made to \nmodify accommodations for female prisoners even after prison officials became aware that \nno overcrowding in the male cell block would result from the Hegins protest. \nThe fact that prison officials prepared cots in the gymnasium to accommodate a sudden \ninflux of male inmates clearly indicates that officials were concerned about double-celling \ninmates. Despite this concern, prison officials made no adjustments to accommodate the \nnewly admitted female prisoners. Defendants provide the court with no explanation for this \nfailure except that the female prisoners had not \"asked for\" modified accommodations, such \nas the use of cots in a larger space like the gymnasium. Stip.Facts, ยถ 55.[8] \nBased on the foregoing considerations, we hold that by housing five plaintiffs with other \ninmates in cells designed for a single person and forcing five plaintiffs to sleep on \nmattresses on the floors of these cells, defendants violated the rights under the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of these five plaintiffs. We find no such \nviolation with regard to the other plaintiffs Yanne, Forbes, Prescott, and Lord. \n1. Personal Liability of Warden Kurtz and Deputy \nWarden Lorent \nPlaintiffs have brought claims against defendants Kurtz and Lorent in both their official and \nindividual capacities. Personal capacity suits seek to impose personal liability upon a \ngovernment official; damages are recoverable from the official's personal assets. Kentucky \nv. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3105, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985). In order to \nestablish personal liability in a ยง 1983 action, \"it is enough to show that the official, acting \nunder color state of law, caused the deprivation of a federal right.\" Id., at 166, 105 S.Ct. at \n3106, and plaintiffs here have so shown. However, individual defendants are entitled to, and \ndo, raise the defense of qualified immunity. \nRecently, the Supreme Court has clarified the procedural framework for determining the \napplicability of this doctrine. In Hunter v. Bryant, ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d \n589 (1991), the Court emphasized that qualified, or \"good faith,\" immunity is a question of \nlaw to be decided by the judge, not a question of fact for the jury. In a per curiam opinion, \nthe Court stated that \"[i]mmunity should be decided by a court long before trial.\" Id. at ___, \n112 S.Ct. at 537. In an earlier opinion, the Court concluded that questions of immunity \nshould be resolved \"at the earliest possible stage of the litigation.\" Anderson v. Creighton, \n483 U.S. 635, 646, n. 6, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3042, n. 6, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). \nIn applying the doctrine of qualified immunity to the facts of a given case, a court must grant \nimmunity to a government official performing discretionary functions \"insofar as [her] \nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of 784*784 \nwhich a reasonable person would have known.\" Brooks v. Andolina, 826 F.2d 1266, 1268 \n(3d Cir.1987) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 \nL.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). In some cases, the qualified immunity issue also has rested on \"the \ncomplementary question of whether defendant had a clearly established duty towards \n\n \nplaintiff.\" Ryan v. Burlington County, 860 F.2d 1199, 1205 (3d Cir.1988), cert. denied, \nFauver v. Ryan, 490 U.S. 1020, 109 S.Ct. 1745, 104 L.Ed.2d 182 (1989). \nTo determine whether the right allegedly violated was clearly established when the \nchallenged conduct took place, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has \nendorsed the following guidelines: \n[T]he standard to which we look ... states that the contours of that right must be sufficiently \nclear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. \nThis does not mean, however, that an official will be protected from suit unless the very \naction in question has previously been held unlawful; rather, the unlawfulness must be \napparent in light of existing law. \nId. at 1208 (citations and quotations omitted). The official's state of mind is generally not a \nfactor in determining whether immunity is available.[9] Harlow, 457 U.S. at 815-17, 102 S.Ct. \nat 2736-38. Instead, the immunity question is resolved by examining the objective \nreasonableness of the defendant's conduct in light of clearly established federal law. Malley \nv. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 345, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1098, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986); Schrob v. \nCatterson, 948 F.2d 1402, 1421 (3d Cir.1991); Brown v. Grabowski, 922 F.2d 1097, 1109 \n(3d Cir.1990), cert. denied, Roselle v. Brown, ___ U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 2827, 115 L.Ed.2d \n997 (1991). Consequently, \"arguments that the defendants desired to handle or subjectively \nbelieved that they had handled the incidents properly are irrelevant.\" Stoneking v. Bradford \nArea School Dist., 882 F.2d 720, 726 (3d Cir.1989), vacated on other grounds sub nomine \nSmith v. Stoneking, 489 U.S. 1062, 109 S.Ct. 1333, 103 L.Ed.2d 804 (1989). \nApplying these standards to the facts in this case, we feel it is clear that the defendants \nKurtz and Lorent are not protected by qualified immunity with regard to the double-celling \nclaims of the five plaintiffs. In resolving this question in plaintiffs' favor, the court finds \nWarden Kurtz and Deputy Warden Lorent should have known conduct similar to that which \nindisputably occurred in this instance had been declared unconstitutional in cases \nemploying well-reasoned Bell analyses like Di Buono and Anela in our own Third Circuit and \nLareau and Powell in other Courts of Appeal. \"Although officials need not `predict the future \ncourse of constitutional law,' they are required to relate established law to analogous factual \nsettings.\" People of Three Mile Island ex rel. Three Mile Island Alert, Inc. v. Nuclear \nRegulatory Commrs., 747 F.2d 139, 144 (3d Cir.1984) (citations omitted). On this record, \nthe contours of plaintiffs' rights were clear. \nWe hold, therefore, that the law prohibiting the doubling-up of pretrial detainees in a cell \ndesigned for one inmate and forcing detainees to sleep on mattresses on cell floors for a \nperiod greater than a few days was clearly established in September 1991 when this activity \ntook place. As the Supreme Court noted in Harlow, \"a reasonably competent public official \nshould know the law governing his conduct.\" 457 U.S. at 819, 102 S.Ct. at 2738. Thus, we \ngrant summary judgment for the plaintiffs against the individual defendants Warden Kurtz \nand Deputy Warden Lorent for double-celling plaintiffs as such conduct was stipulated in \nthis case. \n\n \nWe will grant summary judgment in favor of all other defendants named in the plaintiffs' \nAmended Complaint on this issue since no allegations were specifically brought against \nthem by plaintiffs. \n2. Liability of Schuylkill County \nThe plaintiffs also seek to hold both Warden Kurtz and Deputy Warden Lorent 785*785 \nliable in their official capacities[10] for forcing plaintiffs to sleep on mattresses on cell floors. \nTo the extent the plaintiffs are suing these two defendants in their official capacities, their \nclaims against Kurtz and Lorent are the equivalent of claims brought against the County \nitself. Will, 491 U.S. at 71, 109 S.Ct. at 2311. \nThe Supreme Court in Monell v. Department of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 691-94, 98 \nS.Ct. 2018, 2036-38, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), established that a ยง 1983 complaint against a \nmunicipality must allege first, the existence of a custom or policy of the municipality which is \nof such long standing as to have the force and effect of law; and second, that one or more \nof the municipality's employees violated an individual's civil rights while acting pursuant to \nthis custom or policy. The Monell Court overruled the decision in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. \n167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), in which municipalities were held not to be \n\"persons\" subject to suit under the meaning of the terms in ยง 1983. \nThe Supreme Court held in Monell that when a municipal policy of some nature is the cause \nof certain unconstitutional actions taken by municipal employees, the municipality itself will \nbe held liable. Liability was found to exist where the unconstitutional action implements or \nexecutes a policy, statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and \npromulgated custom even though such a custom has not received formal approval. The \nMonell Court defined \"custom\" as the \"persistent and widespread discriminatory practice of \nstate officials,\" Monell, 436 U.S. at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2036. A policy or custom does not need \nto be made by respective lawmakers, but can be created by \"those whose edicts or acts \nmay fairly be said to represent official policy.\" Id. at 694, 98 S.Ct. at 2037. \nIn Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986), the \nSupreme Court reaffirmed the proposition that municipal liability may be imposed for a \nsingle decision by municipal lawmakers. The Court in St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, \n108 S.Ct. 915, 99 L.Ed.2d 107 (1988) further defined the \"policy\" criteria of Monell. The \nCourt's decision in Praprotnik refines the criteria under which ยง 1983 liability will be found \nagainst municipalities. The Court, in a plurality decision, held that a municipality will only be \njudged liable under ยง 1983 if the final policymaker is the individual who takes the \nunconstitutional action. \nAlthough the Praprotnik Court further established the \"final policymaker\" standard, it also \ncarved out two \"exceptions\" where municipal liability could be found even if the action is \ntaken by an individual other than the final policymaker. First, the Court suggested that \n\"whatever analysis is used to identify municipal policymakers, egregious attempts by local \ngovernment to insulate themselves from liability for unconstitutional policies are precluded \nby a separate doctrine ... the most deliberate municipal evasions of the Constitution will be \nsharply limited.\" Praprotnik, 485 U.S. at 125-27, 108 S.Ct. at 925-26 (quoting Adickes v. \nS.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 167-68, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1613-14, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970)). \n\n \nSecond, the Court proposed that \"when a subordinate's decision is subject to review by the \nmunicipality's authorized policymakers ... and the authorized policymakers approve a \nsubordinate's decision and the basis for it, their ratification [will] be chargeable to the \nmunicipality....\" Id., 485 U.S. at 127, 108 S.Ct. at 926. The Praprotnik Court added the \nexpressed requirement that municipal liability can attach only where the challenged actions \nare those of municipal officers \"who have `final policymaking authority'.\" Id., 485 U.S. at \n123, 108 S.Ct. at 924 (quoting from Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 480, 106 S.Ct. at 1298). In other \nwords, only those municipal officers and employees who have final policymaking authority \ncan by their actions subject their municipal employers to ยง 1983 liability. Id. \nPlaintiffs' attempt to state a basis for Schuylkill County's liability under the latter theory on \nthe premise that Warden Kurtz 786*786 and Deputy Warden Lorent[11] were \"the highest \npolicy-making official[s] for the act in question.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Support of \nMotion for Summary Judgment, 21. The Supreme Court in Pembaur did hold that a county \nprosecutor's single decision, taken as an official policymaker, made the county liable. \nPembaur, 475 U.S. at 469, 106 S.Ct. at 1292. In Praprotnik, however, the Supreme Court \nmade it clear that \"the authority to make municipal policy is necessarily the authority to \nmake final policy.\" 485 U.S. at 127, 108 S.Ct. at 926. There can be no de facto final \npolicymaking authority. Id. at 131, 108 S.Ct. at 928. \nThe Supreme Court instructed us further in Pembaur that \"whether an official had final \npolicymaking authority is a question of state law.\" 475 U.S. at 483, 106 S.Ct. at 1300. We \nbelieve that Warden Kurtz and Deputy Warden Lorent do not possess final policymaking \nauthority under state law, even if sometimes their decisions are final in practice. Plunto v. \nWallenstein, 1989 WL 95390, at *3, 1989 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 9579, *7 (E.D.Pa.1989) (holding \nthat decision of Bucks County Prison Board in Pennsylvania is final for purposes of ยง 1983 \naction and is needed to ratify Warden's decision to hold County liable). Schuylkill County \nemploys both County Commissioners and a County Prison Board as official policymaking \nbodies within the County. Stip.Facts, ยถยถ 4, 5. The existence of these bodies as overseers of \nthe County prison system undermines the contention that the power to make final policy can \nbe removed from them. Id. Moreover, no evidence has been offered under the facts of this \ncase that the County Prison Board or County Commissioners had knowledge of the double-\ncelling of plaintiffs and had either ratified or deferred to this practice. Following the \ninstruction of Pembaur and Praprotnik, therefore, this Court finds that Warden Kurtz and \nDeputy Warden Lorent were not \"final policymaking authorit[ies]\" acting on behalf of the \nSchuylkill County Prison Board or County Commissioners. \nThe plaintiffs also put forward the argument that defendants' Kurtz and Lorent acted with \n\"deliberate indifference\" to the constitutional rights of plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' Memorandum of \nLaw in Support of Motion of Summary Judgment, 21-22. Their argument is based on the \nSupreme Court's ruling in Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 \n(1989), which held that a municipality's failure to train its police officers can give rise to a \nconstitutional violation only when that failure \"amounts to deliberate indifference to the \nrights of persons with whom the police come into contact.\" Id., 489 U.S. at 388, 109 S.Ct. at \n1204. \nThe plaintiffs' reliance on this standard, however, is misplaced in this case. The Canton \nstandard expanded upon the Court's ruling in Monell, in which the Court conditioned the \n\n \ndirect liability of a local governmental entity under ยง 1983. Monell's holding suggests that \nplaintiffs, as an element of establishing the County's policy or custom of deliberate \nindifference, must have presented evidence of such indifference on the part of lawmakers or \nother officials with the authority to make municipal policy. As we determined above, acts by \nWarden Kurtz and Deputy Warden Lorent cannot \"fairly be said to represent official policy.\" \nMonell, 436 U.S. at 691, 98 S.Ct. at 2037. Moreover, plaintiffs have failed to introduce any \nevidence showing that the Warden and Deputy Warden's actions are indicative of \n\"persistent and widespread discriminatory practice\" within the County. Id., at 694, 98 S.Ct. \nat 2037. Therefore, plaintiffs have not met their burden of establishing the County's policy or \ncustom of deliberate indifference to plaintiffs' constitutional rights. \nWe will deny the plaintiffs' motion with regard to the claim against defendants' Kurtz and \nLorent in their official capacities, and also against Schuylkill County, on this issue.[12] \n787*787 B. Blanket Strip and Body Cavity Searches \nIn Counts V and VI of their Amended Complaint, all nine plaintiffs challenge their forced \nsubmission to strip and visual body cavity searches at Schuylkill County Prison. Stip.Facts, \nยถ 20. They contend that Schuylkill County Prison procedures constitute unlawful searches in \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment and also that the searches conducted by Officers Neidig \nand DeAngelo violated plaintiffs' rights to due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \nThe County concedes that as a matter of County policy, all new admittees to the County \nprison must undergo strip and visual body cavity searches. Stip.Facts, ยถ 23. The defendants \nargue that the searches conducted in this case did not violate plaintiffs' due process and \nfourth amendment rights because prison officials acted in response to legitimate \ngovernmental concerns and were careful to perform the searches in the least intrusive \nmanner to the privacy interests of the detainees. \nIn recognition of the principle that pretrial detainees retain their Fourth Amendment rights \nwithin the prison walls, the Supreme Court has held that searches of pretrial detainees in \nprison must be reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Bell, supra. To \nevaluate the reasonableness of the search challenged in Bell, the Court employed a \nbalancing test which has now become a centerpiece of Fourth Amendment analysis in the \nprison context: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise \ndefinition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the \nparticular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must \nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \nId. 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. See Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393 (10th \nCir.1993) (Bell standard employed in deciding validity of automatic strip search policy as \napplied to arrestees for traffic violations); Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437 (9th \nCir.1991) (Bell reasonableness standard applied to determine constitutionality of policy \nrequiring visual body cavity searches of all felony arrestees); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 \n\n \n(2d Cir.1986) (Bell test applicable in case challenging constitutionality of automatic strip and \nbody cavity searches of arrestees charged with misdemeanors or other minor offenses), \ncert. denied, 483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987); DiLoreto v. Oaklyn, \n744 F.Supp. 610 (D.N.J.1990) (Bell standard used to analyze constitutionality of officer's \nvisual inspection of detainee's bathroom use); Deborah El v. Williams, 1990 WL 65717, \n1990 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 6045 (E.D.Pa. May 15, 1990) (Bell test determined appropriate \nstandard governing prison searches).[13] \nWe agree with the defendants' and the Ninth Circuit in their assertion that \"the prevention of \nthe introduction of weapons or other contraband into the prison [] is indeed an extremely \nweighty government interest.\" Thompson v. Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1446 (9th \nCir.1989); see also Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85 (prevention of smuggling of \nmoney, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is significant and legitimate prison 788*788 \nsecurity interest). On the other hand, the privacy interest at stake in a strip search, \nespecially one including visual inspection of body cavities, cannot be understated.[14] \nThe feelings of humiliation and degradation associated with being forced to expose one's \nnude body to strangers for visual inspection is beyond dispute. See Mary Beth G. v. \nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983) (finding few exercises of state authority that \nintrude on citizens' privacy and dignity as severely as visual anal and genital searches). \nIn weighing these same competing governmental and private interests, no less than eight \nUnited States Courts of Appeals have invalidated blanket strip search policies under similar \ncircumstances. See Fuller, supra; Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.1989), cert. \ndenied, Frey v. Masters, 493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct. 503, 107 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989); Walsh v. \nFranco, 849 F.2d 66 (2d Cir.1988); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir.1985); Stewart \nv. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153 (5th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1066, 106 S.Ct. \n1378, 89 L.Ed.2d 604 (1986); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir.1984); Mary Beth G., \nsupra; Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981), cert. denied, Clements v. Logan, 455 \nU.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982).[15] We look to other Courts of Appeals for \nguidance on this issue since our own Third Circuit has not spoken directly on the issue.[16] \nIn each of the above cases, the task was, as prescribed in Bell, to balance the \ngovernmental interest in maintaining safe detention facilities against the privacy rights of the \ndetainee to be free from a most humiliating and degrading experience. The eight Courts of \nAppeal that have invalidated strip search policies as applied to nonviolent misdemeanor \noffenders have generally held that in order to strip search such detainees, the arresting \nofficers must have reasonable individualized suspicion that a detainee is carrying or \nconcealing contraband. See e.g., Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446; Walsh, 849 F.2d at 69; Mary \nBeth G., 723 F.2d at 1273. Individualized suspicion sufficient to warrant a strip search of \nsuch detainees may be based on such factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee's \nappearance and conduct, and any prior arrest record. Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446. \nThe Sixth Circuit has, in contrast, upheld the strip search of a detainee charged with the \nmisdemeanor offense of menacing, Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955, 957-\n59 (6th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1059, 108 S.Ct. 1012, 98 L.Ed.2d 978 (1988), and \nfelonious assault, Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1089 (6th Cir.1983), based primarily on \nthe fact that the charged offenses were sufficiently associated with violence and contraband \n\n \nand that the detainees would be intermingled with the general prison population. See also \nMasters, 872 F.2d at 1255 (\"It is objectively reasonable to conduct a strip search of one \ncharged with a crime of violence before that person comes into contact with other \ninmates.\"). \nAlthough plaintiffs, like the detainees in Dobrowolskyj and Dufrin, were placed into contact \nwith the general prison population, such a factor by itself cannot justify a strip search. See \nMasters, 872 F.2d at 1254-55 (\"the fact of intermingling alone has never been found to \njustify [a strip search] without consideration of the nature of the offense and the question of \nwhether there is any reasonable 789*789 basis for concern that the particular detainee will \nattempt to introduce weapons or other contraband into the institution\"); Giles v. Ackerman, \n746 F.2d 614, 618 (9th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d \n479 (1985) (fact that detainee may ultimately be intermingled with general prison population \ndoes not, by itself, justify strip search as such intermingling is \"both limited and avoidable\"). \nThus, the reasonableness determination in this case hinges upon the nature and \ncircumstances surrounding the particular offense with which plaintiffs were charged. \nIn this case, plaintiffs were charged with criminal trespass which can be punished in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania as a misdemeanor or as a summary offense. 18 Pa. C.S.A. \nยงยง 1104 and 1105 (1983). In either case, a conviction could have resulted in imprisonment. \nId. More specifically, plaintiffs entered prison as part of an orderly mass protest against the \nmistreatment of pigeons during the Hegins annual pigeon shoot. Stip.Facts, ยถยถ 1, 2. The \nrecord gives no indication that plaintiffs reacted violently against anyone at the pigeon shoot \nor to law enforcement officials upon arrest. \nDefendants provide no evidence to support a belief that these plaintiffs were dangerous or \nthreatening to the security of the prison. In fact, they stipulated that the strip searches of \nplaintiffs \"were not based upon any specific suspicion that any of the plaintiffs was \nconcealing weapons, drugs, or other contraband.\" Stip.Facts, ยถ 28. Defendants, instead, \ndefend the strip searches on the grounds of maintaining prison security from the dangers of \narrestees \"who commit actions intending or expecting to go to prison.\" Defendants' Brief in \nSupport of Motion for Summary Judgment, 18. Their allegation, however, was a general one \nthat did not reflect upon the particular circumstances and nature of the offense of this case. \nThere are no specific allegations in the record suggesting that the arresting officers had \nsuspected these animal rights activists to be harboring weapons or concealing contraband \nor drugs at the time they were subjected to the strip searches. \nDefendants also claim that the strip searches in this case were conducted in a professional \nmanner as required by Bell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. That the search of plaintiffs \nwere performed in a reasonable manner and in the presence of a person of the same sex \ndoes not affect the complete absence of reasonable suspicion to believe any contraband or \nweapons would be found on these plaintiffs. See Jones v. Bowman, 694 F.Supp. 538, 546 \n(N.D.Ind.1988). \nAlthough a prison may be a place \"fraught with serious security dangers,\" Bell, 441 U.S. at \n559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, the stipulated facts in this case do not support the view that these \ndangers are created by women minor offenders entering the prison for short periods. Here, \nthe \"need for a particular search,\" id. (emphasis in original) โ a strip search โ is hardly \n\n \nsubstantial enough, in light of the facts presented and the circumstances surrounding the \nplaintiffs' arrest, to justify the severity of the governmental intrusion.[17] \nWhile the need to ensure prison security is a legitimate and substantial concern, we believe \nthat, on the facts here, the strip searches bore an insubstantial relationship to security \nneeds so that, when balanced against plaintiffs' privacy interests, the searches cannot be \ndeemed \"reasonable.\" Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 \nU.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982). The reasonableness standard requires, \n\"at a minimum, that the facts upon which an intrusion is based be capable of measurement \nagainst `an 790*790 objective standard,' whether this be probable cause or a less stringent \ntest.\" Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979) \n(footnotes omitted). The more intrusive the search, the closer governmental authorities must \ncome to demonstrating probable cause for believing that the search will uncover the objects \nfor which the search is being conducted. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 18 n. 15, 88 S.Ct. 1868, \n1878 n. 15, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Based on these principles, and a balancing of the \nfactors in Bell, we are compelled to find that ensuring the security needs of the Schuylkill \nCounty Prison by strip searching plaintiffs was unreasonable without a particularized \nsuspicion by the authorities that either of the twin dangers of concealing weapons or \ncontraband existed. \nWe therefore hold that plaintiffs' constitutional rights were violated when they were strip \nsearched at the Schuylkill County Prison. \n1. Personal Liability of Defendants Kurtz, Neidig, and \nDeAngelo \nWe turn again to the issue of whether individual defendants are protected by qualified \nimmunity. We have determined above that whether an official may prevail in a qualified \nimmunity defense depends upon the \"objective reasonableness of [her] conduct as \nmeasured by reference to clearly established law.\" Harlow, 457 U.S. at 800, 102 S.Ct. at \n2727. \nThe qualified immunity defense is not available to individual defendants here because the \nlaw concerning the unconstitutionality of blanket strip searches without particularized \nreasonable suspicion was so clearly established by September 1991 that no reasonable \nofficer could have believed that defendants' conduct was constitutional. \nThe Supreme Court refined its clearly established law standard in Anderson v. Creighton: \nThe operation of this standard, however, depends substantially upon the level of generality \nat which the relevant \"legal rule\" is to be identified. For example, the right to due process of \nlaw is quite clearly established by the Due Process Clause, and thus there is a sense in \nwhich any action that violates that Clause (no matter how unclear it may be that the \nparticular action is a violation) violates a clearly established right. \nSupra, 483 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. at 3038. The Supreme Court in Anderson went on to \nexplain: \n\n \nour cases establish that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been \n\"clearly established\" in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The \ncontours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand \nthat what he is doing violates that right. \nId. 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. at 3039. \nCourts within the Third Circuit have debated the issue as to when the law prohibiting blanket \nstrip/body cavity searches of inmates was clearly established according to the above \nstandards. In Davis v. Camden, 657 F.Supp. 396 (D.N.J.1987), where the events took place \nin May 1984, the court held that the law at issue \"was not, in May 1984, so clearly \nunconstitutional that the defendants reasonably should have known that they were obligated \nnot to implement it.\" 657 F.Supp. at 401-02. The court in that case noted the \"relatively \nrecent vintage of most strip search cases,\" id., and the fact that the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals had not yet ruled on the constitutionality of blanket strip search policies. Id. By \ncontrast, in O'Brien, supra, the defendants \"had a minimum of eighteen months more than \nthe defendants in Davis to inform themselves of the prevailing case law outlawing the \nsearches in question.\" Id. at 435. By the time the conduct in this case took place, eight U.S. \nCourts of Appeal had ruled blanket strip search policies unconstitutional in addition to the \naforementioned district courts within the Third Circuit. See also, DiLoreto v. Oaklyn, supra. \nIn Anderson, the Supreme Court interpreted earlier cases to mean that it is unnecessary for \na particular act previously to have been ruled unlawful: \"This is not to say that an official \naction is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question 791*791 has \npreviously been held unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of preexisting law the \nunlawfulness must be apparent.\" Id. 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. at 3039. The Third Circuit \nhas found that \"Anderson thus supports our precedent interpreting the `clearly established' \nstandard as `requiring some but not precise factual correspondence [between the relevant \nprecedents and the conduct at issue] and demanding that officials apply general well \ndeveloped legal principles.'\" Stoneking v. Bradford Area School Dist., supra (citing People \nof Three Mile Island ex rel. Three Mile Island Alert, Inc. v. Nuclear Regulatory Commrs., 747 \nF.2d 139, 144 (3d Cir.1984)), vacated on other grounds sub nomine Smith v. Stoneking, \n489 U.S. 1062, 109 S.Ct. 1333, 103 L.Ed.2d 804 (1989). See also Ryan v. Burlington Cty., \n708 F.Supp. 623, 628 (D.N.J.), aff'd, 889 F.2d 1286 (3d Cir. 1989). \nIn the wake of several district court decisions within the Third Circuit as well as decisions by \neight United States Courts of Appeal, we hold that the law was clearly established in \nSeptember 1991 such that reasonable officials would have realized that blanket strip \nsearches, as were conducted here, were unconstitutional. Qualified immunity is not \navailable as a defense based on the stipulated facts in this case. \nThis court, therefore, finds that defendants Kurtz, Neidig, and DeAngelo are liable for \nunreasonable strip searches conducted against plaintiffs. \n2. Liability of Schuylkill County \nThe plaintiffs also seek to hold Warden Kurtz and the current members of the Schuylkill \nCounty Prison Board[18] liable in their official capacities for adopting and executing blanket \n\n \nstrip/body cavity searches of pretrial detainees. Referring back to our earlier discussion on \nthe issue of official capacity liability, we again note that claims against defendants in their \nofficial capacities are the equivalent of claims against the County itself. Will, supra. \nIt is beyond doubt that the officially adopted policy of Schuylkill County requiring all \nindividuals admitted to Schuylkill County Prison, including pretrial detainees, undergo strip \nand visual body cavity searches, does not pass constitutional muster to the extent that the \npolicy permits the indiscriminate strip search of a detainee without requiring a particularized \nreasonable suspicion that the detainee is concealing a weapon or harboring contraband or \ndrugs. \nAs mentioned previously, the Supreme Court in Monell has instructed us that: \nLocal governing bodies [] can be sued directly under ยง 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or \ninjunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements \nor executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decisions officially adopted and \npromulgated by that body's officers. \nMonell, 436 U.S. at 690, 98 S.Ct. at 2035. We therefore hold Schuylkill County liable under \nยง 1983 for promulgating and implementing the strip search policy at issue here. \nC. Restrictions on Telephone Use \nAll nine plaintiffs allege that Schuylkill County Prison policy denied them reasonable access \nto the use of telephones during the first 48-hour period of their detention. Plaintiffs claim that \nthis policy violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. As discussed in an earlier \nsection of this decision, the Bell court has recognized that since a pretrial detainee may not \nbe punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with law, see Bell, 441 U.S. at \n535, 99 S.Ct. at 1872, a court faced with a due process challenge to a particular regulation \nmust determine whether the policy is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is \nbut an incident of some other legitimate governmental purpose. Id. at 538, 99 S.Ct. at 1873. \nThe Court pronounced that \"if a particular condition or restriction of pretrial detention is \nreasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective, it does not, without [a showing of \nintent to punish on 792*792 the part of prison or other government officials] amount to \n`punishment'.\" Id. at 539, 99 S.Ct. at 1874. \nWhile many courts have concluded that detainees are entitled to communicate by \ntelephone, the courts do not agree on the minimum level of access required for \nconstitutional purposes.[19] Case law suggests that so long as there is not an outright policy \nthat prohibits telephone use by pretrial detainees, any restriction or limitations that serve a \nlegitimate governmental purpose, and are not punitive, are constitutional under the Due \nProcess Clause. See e.g., Feeley, 570 F.2d at 373. At the same time, the courts recognize \nthat all inmates should be granted \"reasonable and equitable access to the telephones.\" \nWooden, 637 F.Supp. at 546. \nHere, plaintiffs were not permitted to make any phone calls, except for bail calls with \npermission of the supervisor and cases of emergency, before their interview with a prison \n\n \ncounsellor, which was to be scheduled sometime during, or immediately after, the first 48-\nhour period of their detention (the \"lockdown period\") Stip.Facts, ยถ 59. Defendants allege \nthat this restriction is necessary during the lockdown period in the interests of security. The \nprison uses this initial 48-hour period for the purpose of quarantining inmates to allow time \nfor medical screening and to schedule interviews with prison counsellors. After the initial \nlockdown period, the prison imposed no restrictions on the use of the telephones during \ngeneral population time. Stip.Facts, ยถ 63. Moreover, in this case, each plaintiff, who did not \npost bail, had a counselling session on the day after their arrest and actually made at least \none phone call at this time.[20] Stip.Facts, ยถ 64. \nPursuant to these findings, we believe that the procedures taken by the County in this case \nwere reasonable responses to legitimate prison concerns. In the absence of any evidence \nsuggesting that the County had adopted its telephone policy with an intent to punish pretrial \ndetainees, we must hold that there was no constitutional violation against the plaintiffs on \nthis issue. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons outlined in the foregoing memorandum, the court will grant the summary \njudgment motion of the five plaintiffs Newkirk, Gibbs, Woods, Walker, and Brebner, against \ndefendants Kurtz and Lorent in their individual capacity for the unconstitutional action of \ndouble-celling plaintiffs and forcing them to sleep on mattresses on cell floors as set forth in \nCount I. We will grant defendants' summary judgment motion on behalf of defendants Kurtz \nand Lorent with regard to the claims of the remaining plaintiffs, Yanne, Lord, Prescott, and \nForbes, as set forth in Count I. We also grant summary judgment on this same claim in \nfavor of all named defendants, other than defendants Kurtz and Lorent, with regard to all \nnine plaintiffs. Additionally, we grant defendants' motion for summary judgment with regard \nto this issue as to all nine plaintiffs' claims against defendants in their official capacities and \nalso as against Schuylkill County. \nWe grant summary judgment for all nine plaintiffs with regard to the claims in Counts V and \nVI against defendants Kurtz, Shields, Holden, Kerns and McCloskey, in their official \n793*793 capacities and against Schuylkill County for the unconstitutional strip and body \ncavity searches. We also grant summary judgment for all nine plaintiffs against defendants \nKurtz, Neidig and DeAngelo in their individual capacities for the strip and body search \nclaims. We grant summary judgment in favor of defendants Shields, Holden, Kerns, and \nMcCloskey, and against all nine plaintiffs for claims in Counts V and VI against these four \ndefendants in their individual capacities. We grant summary judgment in favor of defendants \nNeidig and DeAngelo, and against all nine plaintiffs for claims in Counts V and VI against \nthese two defendants in their official capacities. We grant defendants' motion for summary \njudgment in favor of all named defendants other than Kurtz, Shields, Holden, Kerns, \nMcCloskey, Neidig, DeAngelo and Schuylkill County against all nine plaintiffs with regard to \nthe claims in Counts V and VI. \nFinally, the court grants the motion of all defendants for summary judgment with regard to \nall claims in Count III surrounding the restricted use of telephones during the prison's \nrequired 48-hour lockdown period. The court, therefore, also denies plaintiffs' summary \njudgment motion on this issue. \n\n \nWe note that there has been no demand for a jury trial and if the parties wish to present any \nadditional evidence, a non-jury trial or hearing will be scheduled to award further \nappropriate relief. An appropriate order follows. \nORDER \nAND NOW, this 16th day of September, 1993, it is ORDERED that the plaintiffs' Motion For \nSummary Judgment, filed on August 3, 1993, and the defendants' Motion for Summary \nJudgment filed on August 3, 1993 are each granted in part and denied in part consistent \nwith the foregoing opinion. Accordingly, the court orders, ascertains, and specifies as \nfollows: \n1. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in favor of the five plaintiffs \nNewkirk, Walker, Brebner, Gibbs, and Woods, against defendants Kurtz and Lorent in their \nindividual capacities as to the claim in Count I relating to plaintiffs being forced to sleep on \nmattresses on cell floors. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is specifically \nDENIED with regard to these plaintiffs and these defendants in their individual capacities on \nthe claim in Count I relating to plaintiffs being forced to sleep on mattresses on cell floors. \n2. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in favor of all nine named plaintiffs \nand against defendants Kurtz, Shields, Holden, Kerns, and McCloskey in their official \ncapacities and against Schuylkill County as to the claims in Counts V and VI relating to \nplaintiffs' strip and body cavity searches. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is \nspecifically DENIED with regard to all nine plaintiffs and these individual defendants in their \nofficial capacities and Schuylkill County on the claims concerning strip and body searches in \nCounts V and VI. \n3. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in favor of all nine named plaintiffs \nand against defendants Kurtz, Neidig, and DeAngelo in their individual capacities as to the \nclaim in Counts V and VI relating to plaintiffs' strip and body cavity searches. Defendants' \nMotion for Summary Judgment is specifically DENIED with regard to all nine plaintiffs and \nthese defendants in their individual capacities on the claims concerning strip and body \nsearches in Counts V and VI. \n4. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED in all other respects. \n5. To the extent that we have not specifically denied defendants' Motion for Summary \nJudgment in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, said motion is GRANTED as set forth in the conclusion \nof the foregoing opinion. \n6. If the parties wish to present any additional evidence, a non-jury trial or hearing shall be \nscheduled by the Deputy Clerk to determine further appropriate relief and enter final \njudgment. \n[1] Ingrid Newkirk, Laura Yanne, Robin Lord, Heidi Prescott, Robin Walker, Sue Brebner, Teresa Gibbs, Jenny \nWoods, and Dana Forbes. In the parties' Stipulation filed on August 3, 1993, the claims of plaintiff Ann Koons were \ndiscontinued. \n\n \n[2] Defendants include: Paul Sheers, Franklin L. Shollenberger, Mary Ann Conway, the current County \nCommissioners of Schuylkill County; the Honorable Joseph F. McCloskey, Claude Shields, Timothy Holden, and \nDonald Kerns, members of the Schuylkill County Prison Board; Louis Wallaver, the Schuylkill County Court \nAdministrator; David Kurtz, Warden of the Schuylkill County Prison; Raymond Lorent, Deputy Warden of the \nSchuylkill County Prison; Elmer Cutler, John Kling, and William Nasados, supervisors at the Schuylkill County Prison; \nHilda Laubach, Sandy Medinsky, Linda Neidig, Bernadine DeAngelo, Patricia Heckman, Barbara Schwartz, and Carol \nA. Mickalowski, corrections officers at the Schuylkill County Prison; and Kathleen Shartzer, former corrections officer \nat the Schuylkill County Prison. The claims against defendant Mary Ann Conway in her individual capacity were \ndismissed pursuant to the parties' Stipulation filed on August 3, 1993. \n[3] In each of the theft offenses, the items involved were the pigeons the animal rights protestors were attempting to \nrescue. Stip.Fact ยถ 16. \n[4] Plaintiffs Laura Yanne and Robin Lord posted bail and were released from prison on September 3, 1991. \nStip.Facts, ยถ 18, 19. \n[5] The plaintiffs have not suggested that defendants affirmatively intended to punish them. \n[6] Plaintiff Newkirk was forced to sleep thirteen nights on a mattress on the floor of a single occupancy cell; plaintiffs \nGibbs and Woods were similarly confined for fourteen nights; plaintiffs Forbes and Yanne slept one night on a \nmattress on the floor in the common area; plaintiff Walker slept \"approximately\" six nights on a mattress on the floor \nof a cell; and plaintiff Brebner was forced to sleep \"approximately\" eight nights on a mattress on a cell floor. \nStip.Facts, ยถ 43. \n[7] We use the term \"double-celled\" to mean the confinement of two inmates in a single occupancy cell, without \nproviding a second bed. We use the term \"double-bunked,\" however, to mean the confinement of two inmates in a \nsingle occupancy cell, with each inmate being provided with a permanent bunk-type bed of her own. \n[8] Defendants argued in their Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment that the \"evidence does not \nestablish that [the available] cots would be any more comfortable than the use of a standard prison mattress on the \nfloor.\" Defendants' Brief in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, 9. This argument fails to respond \nto the real concerns of the Third Circuit. In Di Buono, the Third Circuit pointed to \"the unsanitary and humiliating \npractice of forcing detainees to sleep on mattresses placed either on the floor adjacent to the toilet and at the feet of \ntheir cellmates, or elsewhere in the Jail,\" Di Buono, 713 F.2d at 996, as its justification for raising this condition to the \nlevel of punishment for purposes of due process analysis. The fact that the mattresses provided by prison officials \nmay have been more comfortable than the use of canvas cots is not responsive to the concerns that sleeping on the \nfloor in a cell designed for one person but housing two is \"unsanitary and humiliating.\" Id. \n[9] Harlow marked a significant shift from the prior two part test of Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 \nL.Ed.2d 214 (1975), which required a subjective analysis of the defendants' motivations. \n[10] States are protected against such suits by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution while \npolitical subdivisions of the state such as municipalities are not protected. Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 \nU.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). \n[11] Deputy Warden Lorent served as acting Warden during a portion of the incarceration period of the plaintiffs. \nStip.Facts, ยถ 7. \n[12] As discussed above, ยง 1983 also refers to deprivations under color of a state \"custom or usage,\" and the Court in \nMonell noted accordingly that \"local governments, like every other ยง 1983 `person,' ... may be sued for constitutional \ndeprivations visited pursuant to governmental `custom' even though such a custom has not received formal approval \nthrough the body's official decisionmaking channels.\" 436 U.S. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. at 2035-36. A ยง 1983 plaintiff thus \nmay be able to recover from a municipality without adducing evidence of an affirmative decision by policymakers if \nable to prove that the challenged action was pursuant to a state \"custom or usage.\" Because there is no allegation \nthat the action challenged here was pursuant to a local \"custom,\" this aspect of Monell is not at issue in this case. \n[13] We note that like the case before this court, the Supreme Court's analysis in Bell was applied specifically to \nprison practices and policies directed at pretrial detainees. Although the Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of \n\n \nroutine strip/body cavity searches of convicted prisoners, other circuits have applied the Bell analysis to such \nsearches and found them constitutional. See e.g., Goff v. Nix, 803 F.2d 358, 370-71 (8th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 484 \nU.S. 835, 108 S.Ct. 115, 98 L.Ed.2d 73 (1987); Campbell v. Miller, 787 F.2d 217, 228 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 \nU.S. 1019, 107 S.Ct. 673, 93 L.Ed.2d 724 (1986); Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 888 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. \n999, 104 S.Ct. 502, 78 L.Ed.2d 693 (1983). \n[14] Plaintiff Prescott was ordered during the visual body cavity search to remove her tampon for the inspecting \nofficer. Stip.Facts, ยถ 36. Defendants admit that the removal of tampons and sanitary napkins are part of the County's \npolicy for maintaining prison security. Defendants' Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, 19. \n[15] The facts of many of these opinions involve strip and body cavity searches of arrestees charged with \nmisdemeanors or other minor offenses. See especially, Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446 (strip search unconstitutional after \narrest for grand theft). See also Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272 (strip search unconstitutional after arrest for traffic \noffenses and other nonviolent misdemeanors). \n[16] District courts within the Third Circuit, however, have held blanket strip search policies unconstitutional. See \nErnst v. Ft. Lee, 739 F.Supp. 220 (D.N.J.1990) (strip search policy unconstitutional on traffic offender); O'Brien v. \nWoodbury Heights, 679 F.Supp. 429 (D.N.J.1988) (strip search unconstitutional after arrest for disorderly conduct). \n[17] The parties have stipulated that prior to the plaintiffs' arrest, \"inmates had attempted to smuggle contraband into \nthe Schuylkill County Prison in body cavities on several occasions.\" Stip.Facts, ยถ 32. This fact standing alone, \nhowever, does not permit prison officials to strip search all arrestees when the search is not supported by \nparticularized reasonable suspicion. Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73 (affidavits of lockup personnel suggesting a \nfew items had been recovered in the past from the body cavities of minor offenders are insufficient to support blanket \nstrip search policy). Moreover, the general fact that \"inmates,\" as opposed to pretrial detainees at issue in this case, \nhad been caught smuggling contraband in body cavities \"on several occasions\" in the County prison does not give \nrise to a reasonable belief that the women arrestees here were concealing any items in body cavities. \n[18] The current Schuylkill County Prison Board consists of defendants: Shields, Holden, Kerns, and McCloskey. \n[19] As explained in Wooden v. Norris, 637 F.Supp. 543, 555 (M.D.Tenn.1986):  \nA number of courts have stated that prison officials are required to provide inmates with at least some access to \ntelephonic communication. See, Feeley v. Sampson, 570 F.2d 364, 373 (1st Cir.1978); Dawson v. Kendrick, 527 \nF.Supp. 1252, 1276, 1314 (S.D.W.Va.1981). Other courts have recognized this right and have specified a certain \nlevel of telephone service to be provided [especially in the case of pretrial detainees]: See e.g., Mitchell v. Untreiner, \n421 F.Supp. 886 (N.D.Fla.1976) (detainees must be allowed to make local calls daily during stated hours). However, \nseveral courts have found that particular restrictions on inmate telephone use were reasonable in light of other means \nof access to the courts provided by the prison administration, or in light of the legitimate interests of prison officials in \nadministration of the prison. See Lock v. Jenkins, 464 F.Supp. 541, 551 (N.D.Ind. 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 641 \nF.2d 488 (7th Cir.1981) (restricting detainee to one collect call per week to attorney and immediate family, not \nunconstitutional in light of security concerns of prison officials). \n[20] Plaintiff Newkirk made two phone calls during her interview session with a prison counsellor.
