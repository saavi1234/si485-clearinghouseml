    "summary": "<p>On May 21, 1999, plaintiff, who was arrested by Rhode Island State Police relying in error upon a withdrawn body attachment order from a family court, filed a class action lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. He alleged he was subjected to an unconstitutional strip search and body cavity search incident to his post-arrest detention at the Adult Correctional Institution (ACI) in Cranston, Rhode Island. Represented by private counsel, plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees and class certification.</p>\r\n<p>The District Court (District Judge Mary M. Lisi) denied plaintiff's motion for class certification. Roberts v. Rhode Island, 2000 WL 33671759 (D. R.I. Jan. 06, 2000). Discovery followed and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Judge Lisi granted partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff, finding that the strip searches of pre-arraignment detainees, if not based upon reasonable suspicion that a particular detainee was concealing weapons or contraband, violated the Fourth Amendment. The Judge enjoined the defendants from conducting strip and visual body cavity searches pursuant to their unconstitutional policies. Roberts v. Rhode Island, 175 F. Supp.2d 176 (D. R.I. 2000). Rhode Island appealed and the First Circuit affirmed, noting that administrative ease and institutional security concerns were insufficient justifications to apply an indiscriminate strip search policy to those accused of minor offenses. Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107 (1st Cir. 2001) (Circuit Judge Juan R. Torruella).</p>\r\n<p>Following the appeal, a settlement conference was set for May 21, 2001 before Magistrate Judge Jacob Hagopian. The docket does not reflect the results of the settlement conference. It does, however, reflect that the District Court awarded, to plaintiffs' two attorneys, fees in the amount of $745.00 and $4,789.10. We have no additional information about this case.</p>\r\n<p>Note that a separate class action lawsuit challenging the ACI strip search policy was filed after the decision in the Roberts case. In this database, that separate case is <a href=\"../../../../case/9845/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Savard v. Rhode Island.</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Rhode Island.\nMarch 16, 2000.\nOpinion Amending Decision, March 24, 2000.\n177 *177 Thomas W. Kelly, Newport, RI, Gregory A. Belzley, Frost Brown Todd, LLC, Louisville, KY, for plaintiff.\nRebecca Tedford Partington, Attorney General's Office, Providence, RI, for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND DECISION\nLISI, District Judge.\nThis case is before the Court on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. The plaintiff has moved for\npartial summary judgment as to the issue of liability on Counts One and Two of his First Amended Complaint. The\n178 State has also moved for summary judgment. For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants *178 the plaintiff's\nmotion and denies the defendants' motion.\nI. Standard of Review\nSummary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). An issue is \"genuine\" if the evidence\nwould permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-movant, and a fact is \"material\" if it has the potential\nto sway the outcome of the litigation under the applicable law. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).\nWhere the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the standard of review does not buckle. See \nBlackie v. State of Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 721 (1st Cir. 1996)(\"The happenstance that both parties move\nsimultaneously for brevis disposition does not, in and of itself, relax the taut line of inquiry that Rule 56\nimposes.\"). The trial court must consider each motion separately, viewing the facts and drawing all inferences in a\nlight that is most favorable to the non-movant. See Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., 126 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1997).\n[1]\nII. Undisputed Facts\n\nA. The Searches\nIn the early morning hours of April 20, 1999, the plaintiff, Craig Roberts (\"Roberts\"), was a passenger in a vehicle\ndriven by an individual named Steven Rizzo (\"Rizzo\"). State police troopers John Gibbs and John Allen stopped\nthe vehicle on Bellevue Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island, because the registration stickers on its license plate\nhad expired. The troopers checked the occupants' identification, and allowed the vehicle to pull away after Rizzo\nproduced the proper registration stickers.\nAs the vehicle pulled away, the troopers stopped it again and asked Roberts to exit the car. The troopers advised\n[2]\nRoberts that the computer had revealed that he was subject to an outstanding body attachment.  The troopers\nperformed a patdown frisk, which revealed no weapons, and placed Roberts in the back of the cruiser. Roberts\nthen produced a carbon-copy of a family court order issued by magistrate George DiMuro, dated September 1,\n1998, withdrawing the body attachment. After relaying this information to dispatch, the troopers declined to\nrelease Roberts and transported him to the Intake Services Center (\"ISC\") at the Adult Correctional Institution\n(\"ACI\") in Cranston, Rhode Island.\nUpon arriving at the ISC, the troopers transferred Roberts to the correctional officer on duty. He was placed in a\ntemporary holding cell and the committing officer completed a \"New Inmate Committing Sheet.\" The officer\nphotographed Roberts, took his fingerprints, and requested that he submit to a blood test. Roberts refused the\nblood test.\n179 *179 At some point during the committing procedure, a member or members of the ISC staff subjected Roberts to\na strip search in accordance with two policies promulgated by the Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"). Pursuant\nto those policies, Roberts was told to remove his clothing one item at a time for inspection. The member or\nmembers of the ISC staff completed a \"Scars and Tattoo Sheet.\" The ISC staff member or members ordered\nRoberts to run his fingers through his hair. They then inspected the inside of his mouth, the inside of his nose, his\nhands, and his feet. Roberts was also ordered to spread his buttocks, whereupon the officer or officers visually\ninspected his body cavity. Noone touched Roberts during the course of the search. The ISC staff member or\nmembers then gave Roberts prison garments and placed him in a segregated cell because he had refused the\nblood test.\nThe ISC staff subjected Roberts to a similar search before transporting him to the Garrahy Judicial Complex later\nthat morning. It is unclear from the deposition transcripts and Rule 12.1 submissions whether the area in which\nRoberts was searched was secluded from public view, although Roberts's deposition does suggest that another\nindividual was next to him during the second strip search procedure. After showing the carbon-copy of the order\nwithdrawing the body attachment to a sheriff in the Garrahy Complex, Roberts was released from custody. He\nwas not presented before a judicial officer.\nB. The Policies\nThere are two policies in issue in this case, both of which were in effect at the time of Roberts's search. The first\npolicy, dated June 15, 1984, is located in a DOC \"Operational Memorandum\" numbered 5.15.05-2. The subject of\nthe memorandum is the \"Reception and Identification for Awaiting Trial and Newly Sentenced Inmates.\" Part V.B.\nof that policy provides as follows:\nB. SEARCH OF INMATE AND BELONGINGS:\nEach new commitment's person, clothing, and personal belongings shall be thoroughly searched\nfor contraband.\n\n1. The commitment officer shall thoroughly search the inmate's body to include examination of\nhair, arms, hands, ears, mouth, nose; visual examination of groin and rectum; toes and soles of\nfeet.\n(a) Any artificial limbs, dentures, or bandages shall be carefully examined.\n2. The new commitment's clothing and belongings shall be thoroughly searched to include\nexamination of all pockets, cuffs, seams, hat bands, waistbands, zippers, and collars; all clothing\nshall be turned inside-out and linings checked; soles, heels, socks, and inside of all shoes shall be\nexamined; the contents of any and all luggage, packages, bags, etc. shall be thoroughly\nexamined.\nThe second policy in issue derives from a DOC \"Policy and Procedure\" dated January 27, 1997, numbered\n9.14-1. The subject of the memorandum is \"Procedures for Detecting and Controlling Contraband On or In the\nPossession of Inmates.\" Part III.B.2. of that policy provides as follows:\n2. Strip Searches\na. Strip searches of inmates will always be conducted for objective purposes only and will always\nbe carried out in an expeditious and efficient manner. They will never be done for punitive\npurposes or as a form of harassment.\n180 (1) Strip searches shall be conducted under the direction of the Shift Supervisor *180 or other\nSuperior Officer, or as required by policy.\n(2) Two (2) Correctional Officers shall be assigned to conduct a strip search.\n(3) Strip searches shall be conducted by officers of the same sex as the inmates being searched,\nexcept during emergencies.\n(4) The following search plan shall be followed when conducting a strip search. The officer will\nexamine:\n(a) All pockets;\n(b) Run fingers over linings, seams, collars, cuffs, waistbands, and fly;\n(c) Shoes, inside soles and heels;\n(d) Socks, turning them inside out;\n(e) False teeth, artificial limbs, plaster casts;\n(f) Inmates will run their fingers through their hair. Officers will check for wigs and hairpieces;\n(g) Inmates ears will be checked inside and out;\n(h) The officer will look inside the inmate's nose;\n(i) Inmates will open their mouths, lift their tongues and roll each lip, for the officer's view;\n(j) Inmates will lift their penises and testicles on the officer's command to provide a clear view of\nthe groin area;\n(k) Inmates will then lift their feet so that the officer can clearly see between the toes and the\nsoles;\n(l) Inmate's hands will be visually inspected;\n\n(m) Inmates will be required to bend over and spread the rectum to provide a clear view of the\narea.\nRoberts's summary judgment motion asks this Court to declare these policies unconstitutional; the state seeks\nprecisely the opposite.\n[3]\nC. The ISC\nThe DOC operates the ACI, which currently consists of seven facilities with a total capacity of 3,858 beds. One of\nthe seven facilities that the DOC operates is the ISC. The ISC serves as the receiving facility for all males\ncommitted to the care, custody, and control of the DOC. The Rhode Island State Police, sheriffs, local police\ndepartments, United States Marshals Service, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service all bring\ncommitments to the ISC.\nCommitments housed at the ISC fall into several categories. Some are pretrial detainees, some are newly\nsentenced inmates who await classification to other facilities, some are pretrial protective custody detainees, and\nothers are sentenced protective custody inmates. The length of time an inmate remains committed to the ISC is\napproximately 16.8 days.\nIt is a standard policy at the ISC to strip search each male processed as a commitment. Nevertheless, if\n[4]\nsomeone bails a commitment out of the facility within a very short  period of time, he does not enter the general\npopulation and is not subjected to the routine strip search. The correctional officers at the ISC search inmates in\n181 accordance with the aforementioned DOC policies. Those officers *181 receive training about the strip search\nprocedure in video and lecture form.\nRhode Island has a unified prison system. This means that there are no regional facilities to house pretrial\ndetainees before they are tried and sentenced. The ISC is, therefore, considered a maximum security prison. The\naffidavit suggests that the strip search policies ensure the facility's security, which consists of an integrated\ngeneral population. The ISC's commitments are out of their cells for approximately eight hours each day, during\nwhich time they commingle with the other commitments in different areas of the facility. The strip searches have\nresulted in the discovery of contraband in the past. Although none of the incident reports supplied by the\ndefendants indicates that contraband was found during visual body cavity searches, one report did discuss an\ninmate who had secreted cocaine in a plastic bag in his mouth. The strip search of Roberts yielded no weapons\nor contraband.\nIII. Discussion\nThe question that this Court must answer is whether the DOC's policies requiring all of the ISC's commitments to\n[5]\nundergo a visual strip and body cavity search  comports with the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against\nunreasonable searches. Upon careful review of the stipulated facts and relevant policies, the Court finds those\npolicies to be unconstitutional.\nAny analysis of the policies in issue necessarily begins with Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In that case, the Supreme Court of the United States considered whether a policy requiring\npretrial detainees at a federal detention facility to expose their body cavities to visual inspection after contact\nvisits with persons outside the institution was constitutional. Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. In holding that the policy\ndid not violate the petitioners' Fourth Amendment rights, the Supreme Court defined the parameters of the\nreasonableness inquiry in these kinds of cases:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\n\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861.\nSince the Court's decision in Wolfish, the courts of appeals have addressed myriad strip search policies applied\nto arrestees and detainees. See, e.g., Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986)(holding unconstitutional blanket\njail policy of subjecting all arrestees to strip and visual body cavity searches); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago,\n723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983)\n182 (holding unconstitutional city policy of subjecting all females arrested and detained to strip and visual body cavity \n*182 searches); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981)(finding policy to strip search all detainees for\nweapons or contraband unconstitutional). But see, e.g., Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, Ky., 823 F.2d 955 (6th\nCir.1987)(upholding as constitutional strip search policy requiring strip and visual body cavity search of all\ninmates being moved from one security area of a prison to another). The United States Court of Appeals for the\nFirst Circuit has also addressed a similar policy.\nIn Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir.1983), the court of appeals considered a strip search policy that provided\nfor routine strip searches of certain maximum security inmates after the inmates had left the prison law library\nand infirmary, and after they had received visitors in the maximum security unit's visiting rooms. Recognizing the\n\"severe if not gross interference with a person's privacy that occurs when guards conduct a visual inspection of\nbody cavities,\" a divided court of appeals upheld the policy in question due in large part to the nature of the\nfacility and the \"particularly dangerous prisoners\" confined therein. Id. at 887 (noting that 83% of inmates\nconfined to the facility \"were serving maximum sentences of more than 10 years\").\nAlmost fourteen years after Arruda, the court of appeals revisited Bell in Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st\nCir.1997). In Swain, the court addressed anew the standard set forth in Wolfish. Noting that other courts of\nappeals had concluded that \"to be reasonable under Wolfish, strip and visual body cavity searches must be\njustified by at least a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons,\" the First\nCircuit adopted the reasonable suspicion standard as well. Id. at 7 (\"Accordingly, it is clear that at least the\nreasonable suspicion standard governs strip and visual body cavity searches in the arrestee context as well.\"). \nSee also Weber, 804 F.2d at 802 (adopting reasonable suspicion standard), quoted in Wachtler v. County of\nHerkimer, 35 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.1994).\nThe facts in Swain were different from the facts in the case now under consideration. In Swain, 117 F.3d at 1,\npolice officers arrested the plaintiff (\"Swain\") and her boyfriend for possession of marijuana and theft. Police pat-\nfrisked the plaintiff at the scene and then transported her and her boyfriend to the police station. Swain was taken\nto a booking area and her information was processed by a female employee. During the booking process, Swain\nwas permitted to use the bathroom unobserved. She then made a telephone call to her lawyer. Upon concluding\nthe conversation, she was again pat-frisked and placed in a holding cell. Id. at 3.\nSwain was in the cell for approximately twenty minutes when a male officer entered the cell to interrogate her\nabout her boyfriend's criminal activities. The officer became angry when Swain insisted that she knew nothing\nabout those activities. The officer then departed. Five to ten minutes later, a female employee of the department\nentered the cell and informed Swain that she would have to submit to a strip search. The subsequent strip and\nvisual body cavity search revealed no contraband or weapons. Id. at 3-4.\nAlthough the facts of Swain are different from the facts in the case at bar, this Court must adhere to the standard\npropounded by the court of appeals. To pass muster under that standard, a strip and visual body cavity\nconducted in this circuit must be based at least upon a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing\ncontraband or weapons.\n183 Even the most cursory glance at the policies propounded by the DOC for use at *183 the ISC indicates that they\nare constitutionally deficient. Policy number 5.15.05-2, the policy that governs the admission of new commitments\nto the ISC, contains no language concerning what factors might give rise to the reasonable suspicion that would\npermit a constitutional strip and visual body cavity search. Policy number 9.14-1 states that strip searches for\ncontrolling contraband in the facility shall \"be conducted for objective purposes only.\" Nevertheless, it does not\n\nprovide any guideposts respecting which objective criteria might give rise to reasonable suspicion, which would\npermit a constitutional strip and visual body cavity search. See, e.g., Weber, 804 F.2d at 802 (dicta suggesting\nthat particularized suspicion might arise from the nature of the charge and the specific circumstances surrounding\nthe arrest); Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1087 (6th Cir.1983)(holding strip search constitutional where police\narrested the plaintiff for felonious assault); Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (finding blanket search policy unconstitutional\nas applied to plaintiff where, inter alia, offense of drunken driving was \"one not commonly associated by its very\nnature with the possession of weapons or contraband\"). In fact, the policies evidence no exceptions to the firm\nrule that all commitments to the ISC are to be subjected to a strip and visual body cavity search.\nWhile this Court is mindful of the DOC's need to implement and maintain policies that will promote order within\nthe ACI and particularly the ISC, the Court is also aware of \"the severe if not gross interference with a person's\nprivacy that occurs when guards conduct a visual inspection of body cavities.\" Arruda, 710 F.2d at 887. As the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit admonished in Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013: \"An indiscriminate\nstrip search policy routinely applied to detainees such as [Roberts] along with all other detainees cannot be\nconstitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.\" Thus,\nwhile some strip and visual body cavity searches at the ISC will, no doubt, be constitutionally permissible, the\ncurrent indiscriminate practice of subjecting all commitments to those searches cannot pass Fourth Amendment\nscrutiny.\nBased upon the stipulated statement of facts, the facts submitted by the defendants in support of their motion for\nsummary judgment, and a careful survey of the precedential landscape, this Court concludes that DOC policies\n5.15.05-2 and 9.14.1 do not comport with Swain's reasonable suspicion standard and are therefore\nunconstitutional. In light of this determination, the Court also concludes that those policies, as applied to Roberts,\nviolated his right to be free from an unreasonable search in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\nIV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons stated herein, the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on Count One of the First\nAmended Complaint is GRANTED. The Court hereby declares DOC policy number 15.5.05-2 and DOC policy\nnumber 9.14-1 unconstitutional because they violate the Fourth Amendment. Furthermore, the Court restrains\nand enjoins the defendants' from conducting strip and visual body cavity searches in accordance with those\npolicies.\nThe plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on Count Two of the First Amended Complaint is moot. It\nrelates to a class action, and by a Memorandum and Order dated January 6, 2000, the Court denied the plaintiff's\nmotion to certify a class.\nThe defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\n184 AMENDED DECISION\n*184\nOn March 16, 2000, this Court issued a Memorandum and Decision (\"March 16 Decision\") in this action. That\nMemorandum and Decision enjoined the defendants from conducting certain strip and visual body cavity\nsearches and declared two Department of Corrections policies relating to those searches to be unconstitutional.\nOn March 22, 2000, the defendants moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 for a clarification of that decision.\nI. Discussion\n\nA. The Caption\nThe defendant's first request for clarification concerns the case caption included in the Court's March 16\nDecision. On January 5, 2000, the Court granted the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint. The plaintiff filed\nhis First Amended Complaint on January 28, 2000. That complaint substituted new defendants for the Jane and\nJohn Doe defendants included in the caption of the initial complaint.\nThe defendants have asked this Court to amend its March 16 Decision to reflect the caption as it appeared in the\ninitial complaint. Defendants assert that they were never served with a copy of the First Amended Complaint; the\nCourt's file supports that assertion. The Court therefore grants the defendants' motion to amend on this ground,\nand amends the March 16, 2000, decision to include the caption listed in this Amended Decision.\nB. The Substantive Clarification\nThe defendants next ask for a clarification of the scope of the Court's declaration and the injunctive relief\nrewarded. Particularly, the defendants argue that the March 16 Decision, as written, nullifies DOC policies\n15.5.05-2 and 9.14-1 in toto, thus prohibiting the use of other security procedures contained within those\ndocuments. The Court amends its March 16 Decision and declares unconstitutional the strip and visual body\ncavity search provisions of policies 15.5.05-2 and 9.14-1 insofar as those policies are universally applied to pre-\narraignment detainees without any prior determination that there is a reasonable suspicion that the individual may\nbe carrying weapons or contraband.\nFinally, the defendants have asked this Court to amend the March 16 Decision to narrow the scope of the\ninjunctive relief granted. The defendants aver that, as written, the March 16 Decision enjoins all strip and visual\nbody cavity searches at the Department of Corrections. To clarify this confusion as to the scope of the injunctive\nrelief afforded in the March 16 Decision, the Court amends it to enjoin the Department of Corrections from\nconducting strip and visual body cavity searches of pre-arraignment detainees that are not found upon a\n[1]\nreasonable suspicion that the particular detainee is concealing weapons or contraband.\nII. Conclusion\nThe Court hereby amends its March 16, 2000, Memorandum and Decision to be consistent with the text of this\nAmended Decision.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] In support of their motions for summary judgment, the parties submitted a joint factual stipulation pursuant to\nD.R.I. Loc. R. 12.1. Unless otherwise stated, the Court draws the relevant facts from that document and the\nexhibits that accompany it.\n[2] Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 8-10-3.1(c)(8), a duly appointed master of the family court has the power to\nissue a \"capias and/or body attachment.\" Black's Law Dictionary defines the term \"capias,\" also termed \"body\nexecution,\" as \"[a]ny of various types of writs that require an officer to take a named defendant into custody.\"\nBlack's Law Dictionary 199 (7th ed.1999).\n[3] The Court draws the following facts from the affidavit of A.T Wall II (\"Wall\") and the documentation that\naccompanied it. At the time of the filing, Wall was Interim Director of the DOC. The defendants submitted his\naffidavit in support of their motion for summary judgment.\n[4] Neither policy in issue defines a \"very short\" period of time.\n\n[5] In support of their motion for summary judgment, the defendants seek to classify the searches in question as\nstrip searches. Clearly, the searches in issue involved visual body cavity searches as well. As the court of\nappeals noted in Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n. 3 (1st Cir.1985): \nA \"strip search,\" though an umbrella term, generally refers to an inspection of a naked individual, without any\nscrutiny of the subject's body cavities. A \"visual body cavity search\" extends to visual inspection of the anal and\ngenital areas. A \"manual body cavity search\" includes some degree of touching or probing of body cavities.\n[1] The Court will not revisit the paramenters of the reasonable suspicion calculus, as the March 16 Decision\nalready addresses the issue.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

ROBERTS, Sr., individually \nv. \nTWO UNKNOWN RHODE ISLAND STATE TROOPERS whose names will become known in the course of \npretrial discovery \nNo. 99โCVโ259. | Jan. 6, 2000. \nOpinion \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nLISI, District J. \n*1 On November 3, 1999, the plaintiff, Craig L. Roberts, Sr. (โRobertsโ), filed a motion for class certification pursuant to \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). See also D.R.I. Loc. R. 30. The defendants filed a timely objection and the matter is now in order for \ndecision. For the reasons outlined below, Robertsโs motion for class certification is denied. \n  \n \nI. Facts1 \nIn the late evening or early morning hours of April 19 and 20, 1999, two Rhode Island State Police troopers stopped a vehicle \ndriven by Stephen Rizzo (โRizzoโ) because the registration stickers on the vehicleโs license plates had expired. Roberts was a \npassenger in the vehicle. The troopers approached the vehicle and requested identification from both Rizzo and Roberts. The \ntwo men complied with the troopersโ requests and Rizzo retrieved the appropriate registration stickers from the vehicleโs \nglove compartment. The troopers then concluded the encounter and permitted the vehicle to pull away. \n  \nAs Rizzo drove away the same troopers again stopped his vehicle. The troopers approached the vehicle and informed Roberts \nthat a computer check had revealed the he was subject to an outstanding body attachment. Roberts produced a copy of an \norder  signed  by  Rhode  Island  Family  Court  Magistrate  George  DiMuro.  The  order  withdrew  the  body  attachment. \nNevertheless, the troopers arrested Roberts and transported him to the Adult Correctional Institutions (โACIโ). \n  \nThe troopers brought Roberts to the ACIโs Intake Services Center. At some point in time, Roberts was placed in the center of \na cell where he was ordered to disrobe completely. Someone then visually examined his body but did not touch him. He \nreceived a prison uniform and was thereafter placed in a segregated cell because he refused to submit to a blood test. \n  \nSeveral hours later, Roberts was transported to the Garrahy Judicial Complex in Providence, where he was released upon \nshowing a sheriff the copy of Magistrate DiMuroโs order withdrawing the body attachment. Roberts claims that he was not \npresented to a judicial officer prior to his release. \n  \n \n  1 \n \n\nRoberts v. Rhode Island, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2000)   \n \nII. Discussion \nRoberts has moved for certification of a class pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2). According to his formulation, the purported \nclass consists of: \n[A]ll persons arrested for misdemeanors, non-criminal offenses or held on civil body attachments who \nwere processed at the Intake Services Center or the Womenโs [sic] Prison at the Adult Correctional \nInstitution who were strip searched pursuant to the uniform policy, practice and custom of the \nDepartment of Corrections of the State of Rhode Island when there was no probable cause to believe \nthe individual was in possession of weapons or contraband. \nIn this Courtโs estimation, the proposed class definition does not satisfy the strictures of Rule 23. \n  \nRule 23 provides in pertinent part: \n(a) Prerequisites to a Class Action. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf \nof all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the \nclass, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \n*2 (b) Class Actions Maintainable. An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision (a) are \nsatisfied, and in addition: \n.... \n(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making \nappropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole .... \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23. With this legal framework in place, the Court proceeds to a fact-specific application of the Rule 23 criteria. \n  \n \nA. Rule 23(a) \nโTo obtain class action certification, [Roberts] must establish that all four requisites of Rule 23(a) and at least one part of \nRule 23(b) are met.โ Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 55 (3d Cir.1994). Because the plaintiff has not established that each \nrequirement of Rule 23(a) is met, the Court denies his motion for class certification. \n  \n \n1. Rule 23(a)(1) Numerosity \nIn order to satisfy Rule 23(a)(1), the plaintiff must show that โthe class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.โ Roberts attempts to satisfy this prong of the Rule 23(a) test by averring in a legal memorandum that \napproximately 16,000 people are processed by the Intake Services Center each year. From that gross figure, the plaintiff \nextrapolates that โit is obvious that there are thousands of people affected by the strip search policy.โ He supplies no evidence \nto support this assertion. \n  \nThe United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has affirmed a denial of class certification where the plaintiffโs \nclaims as to numerosity of the class were purely speculative. See Makuc v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 835 F.2d 389, 394โ95 (1st \nCir.1987); cf. Yaffe v. Powers, 454 F.2d 1362, 1366 (1st Cir.1972) (noting that where claimant seeks certification of class \npursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), number of actual class members is often โincapable of specific enumeration.โ). As one federal \ndistrict court in this circuit has recognized, the policies underlying Rule 23(a) โdo not require certifying a class of unknown \nsize, location, or character. The Court may properly deny a motion for class certification when the plaintiffโs contention as to \nthe size of the class is purely speculative.โ Vigue v. Ives, 138 F.R.D. 6, 8 (D.Me.1991) (citing Makuc, 835 F.2d at 394). \nBecause Roberts has failed to provide any evidence concerning the numerosity of the purported class, his motion for class \ncertification fails the Rule 23(a)(1) test. \n  \n \n2. Rule 23(a)(3) Typicality \n  2 \n \n\nRoberts v. Rhode Island, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2000)   \n \nAlthough the plaintiffโs failure to satisfy the Rule 23(a)(1) numerosity criterion is sufficient to defeat the motion for class \ncertification,  the  Court  will  address  another,  independently  sufficient  reason  for  denying  the  motionโthe  typicality \nrequirement of Rule 23(a)(3). \n  \nIn Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 57, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit defined the parameters of the typicality \nrequirement: โThe typicality criterion is intended to preclude certification of those cases where the legal theories of the \nnamed plaintiffs potentially conflict with those of the absentees by requiring that the common claims are comparably central \nto the claims of the named plaintiffs as to the claims of the absentees.โ In other words, the โnamed representativesโ claims \nmust have the same essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.โ Retired Chicago Police Assโn v. City of \nChicago, 7 F.3d 584, 597 (7th Cir.1993) (quotations omitted). \n  \n*3 Applying these legal standards, it is evident that Robertsโs definition of the purported class is self-defeating. The proffered \nclass would be comprised of โthousandsโ of persons who were strip-searched โwhen there was no probable cause to believe \nthe individual was in possession of weapons or contraband.โ The plaintiffโs reference to a โprobable causeโ standard does not \naccurately portray the fact-intensive inquiry that the Court would have to undertake with respect to each purported class \nmember. \n  \nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 560 (1979), the Supreme Court of the United States rejected an argument that the existence \nof probable cause was the sine qua non to a finding that a visual body-cavity search of a pre-trial detainee was constitutional \nfor purposes of the Fourth Amendment. Instead, the Court concluded that the test governing such searches was a test of \nreasonableness. Id. at 559. In assessing a particular search under that standard, the Supreme Court instructed lower courts to \nโconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the \nplace in which it is conducted.โ Id. The inquiry is both subject-specific and fact-intensive. In fact, the Bell Court stated: โThe \ntest of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each \ncase it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search \nentails.โ Id. In light of this analysis, absent some affirmative showing that Roberts and the other purported class claimants \nenjoy nearly identical factual circumstances, the Court cannot apply Bell precisely to the purported class without undertaking \nmyriad individual hearings as to the reasonableness of the particular intrusion. This fact alone subverts the salutary designs of \nboth the Rule 23 typicality requirement and the class action device. \n  \nBecause there is no indication that Robertsโs claims have the โsame essential characteristics as the claims of the class at \nlarge,โ  Retired Chicago Police Assโn,  7  F.3d  at  597  (quotations  omitted),  and  because  Bell  provides  an  inherently \ncase-specific standard, the Court denies the plaintiffโs motion for class certification. \n  \n \nB. Rule 23(b)(2) \nBecause the Court has determined that the plaintiff has not satisfied at least two of the four requirements of Rule 23(a), an \nanalysis of Rule 23(b)(2) is unnecessary. See Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 55 (โTo obtain class action certification, [Roberts] must \nestablish that all four requisites of Rule 23(a) and at least one part of Rule 23(b) are met.โ ). \n  \n \nIII. Conclusion \nFor the reasons outlined above, the plaintiffโs motion to certify a class of plaintiffs pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) is \ndenied. \n  \nSO ORDERED. \nParallel Citations \n45 Fed.R.Serv.3d 1072 \nFootnotes \n \n  3 \n \n\nRoberts v.

Belzley, Frost Brown Todd, LLC, Louisville, KY, for plaintiff.\nRebecca Tedford Partington, Attorney General's Office, Providence, RI, for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND DECISION\nLISI, District Judge.\nThis case is before the Court on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. The plaintiff has moved for\npartial summary judgment as to the issue of liability on Counts One and Two of his First Amended Complaint. The\n178 State has also moved for summary judgment. For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants *178 the plaintiff's\nmotion and denies the defendants' motion.\nI. Standard of Review\nSummary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). An issue is \"genuine\" if the evidence\nwould permit a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the non-movant, and a fact is \"material\" if it has the potential\nto sway the outcome of the litigation under the applicable law. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).\nWhere the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the standard of review does not buckle. See \nBlackie v. State of Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 721 (1st Cir. 1996)(\"The happenstance that both parties move\nsimultaneously for brevis disposition does not, in and of itself, relax the taut line of inquiry that Rule 56\nimposes.\"). The trial court must consider each motion separately, viewing the facts and drawing all inferences in a\nlight that is most favorable to the non-movant. See Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., 126 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1997).\n[1]\nII. Undisputed Facts\n\nA. The Searches\nIn the early morning hours of April 20, 1999, the plaintiff, Craig Roberts (\"Roberts\"), was a passenger in a vehicle\ndriven by an individual named Steven Rizzo (\"Rizzo\"). State police troopers John Gibbs and John Allen stopped\nthe vehicle on Bellevue Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island, because the registration stickers on its license plate\nhad expired. The troopers checked the occupants' identification, and allowed the vehicle to pull away after Rizzo\nproduced the proper registration stickers.\nAs the vehicle pulled away, the troopers stopped it again and asked Roberts to exit the car. The troopers advised\n[2]\nRoberts that the computer had revealed that he was subject to an outstanding body attachment.  The troopers\nperformed a patdown frisk, which revealed no weapons, and placed Roberts in the back of the cruiser. Roberts\nthen produced a carbon-copy of a family court order issued by magistrate George DiMuro, dated September 1,\n1998, withdrawing the body attachment. After relaying this information to dispatch, the troopers declined to\nrelease Roberts and transported him to the Intake Services Center (\"ISC\") at the Adult Correctional Institution\n(\"ACI\") in Cranston, Rhode Island.\nUpon arriving at the ISC, the troopers transferred Roberts to the correctional officer on duty. He was placed in a\ntemporary holding cell and the committing officer completed a \"New Inmate Committing Sheet.\" The officer\nphotographed Roberts, took his fingerprints, and requested that he submit to a blood test. Roberts refused the\nblood test.\n179 *179 At some point during the committing procedure, a member or members of the ISC staff subjected Roberts to\na strip search in accordance with two policies promulgated by the Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"). Pursuant\nto those policies, Roberts was told to remove his clothing one item at a time for inspection. The member or\nmembers of the ISC staff completed a \"Scars and Tattoo Sheet.\" The ISC staff member or members ordered\nRoberts to run his fingers through his hair. They then inspected the inside of his mouth, the inside of his nose, his\nhands, and his feet. Roberts was also ordered to spread his buttocks, whereupon the officer or officers visually\ninspected his body cavity. Noone touched Roberts during the course of the search. The ISC staff member or\nmembers then gave Roberts prison garments and placed him in a segregated cell because he had refused the\nblood test.\nThe ISC staff subjected Roberts to a similar search before transporting him to the Garrahy Judicial Complex later\nthat morning. It is unclear from the deposition transcripts and Rule 12.1 submissions whether the area in which\nRoberts was searched was secluded from public view, although Roberts's deposition does suggest that another\nindividual was next to him during the second strip search procedure. After showing the carbon-copy of the order\nwithdrawing the body attachment to a sheriff in the Garrahy Complex, Roberts was released from custody. He\nwas not presented before a judicial officer.\nB. The Policies\nThere are two policies in issue in this case, both of which were in effect at the time of Roberts's search. The first\npolicy, dated June 15, 1984, is located in a DOC \"Operational Memorandum\" numbered 5.15.05-2. The subject of\nthe memorandum is the \"Reception and Identification for Awaiting Trial and Newly Sentenced Inmates.\" Part V.B.\nof that policy provides as follows:\nB. SEARCH OF INMATE AND BELONGINGS:\nEach new commitment's person, clothing, and personal belongings shall be thoroughly searched\nfor contraband.\n\n1. The commitment officer shall thoroughly search the inmate's body to include examination of\nhair, arms, hands, ears, mouth, nose; visual examination of groin and rectum; toes and soles of\nfeet.\n(a) Any artificial limbs, dentures, or bandages shall be carefully examined.\n2. The new commitment's clothing and belongings shall be thoroughly searched to include\nexamination of all pockets, cuffs, seams, hat bands, waistbands, zippers, and collars; all clothing\nshall be turned inside-out and linings checked; soles, heels, socks, and inside of all shoes shall be\nexamined; the contents of any and all luggage, packages, bags, etc. shall be thoroughly\nexamined.\nThe second policy in issue derives from a DOC \"Policy and Procedure\" dated January 27, 1997, numbered\n9.14-1. The subject of the memorandum is \"Procedures for Detecting and Controlling Contraband On or In the\nPossession of Inmates.\" Part III.B.2. of that policy provides as follows:\n2. Strip Searches\na. Strip searches of inmates will always be conducted for objective purposes only and will always\nbe carried out in an expeditious and efficient manner. They will never be done for punitive\npurposes or as a form of harassment.\n180 (1) Strip searches shall be conducted under the direction of the Shift Supervisor *180 or other\nSuperior Officer, or as required by policy.\n(2) Two (2) Correctional Officers shall be assigned to conduct a strip search.\n(3) Strip searches shall be conducted by officers of the same sex as the inmates being searched,\nexcept during emergencies.\n(4) The following search plan shall be followed when conducting a strip search. The officer will\nexamine:\n(a) All pockets;\n(b) Run fingers over linings, seams, collars, cuffs, waistbands, and fly;\n(c) Shoes, inside soles and heels;\n(d) Socks, turning them inside out;\n(e) False teeth, artificial limbs, plaster casts;\n(f) Inmates will run their fingers through their hair. Officers will check for wigs and hairpieces;\n(g) Inmates ears will be checked inside and out;\n(h) The officer will look inside the inmate's nose;\n(i) Inmates will open their mouths, lift their tongues and roll each lip, for the officer's view;\n(j) Inmates will lift their penises and testicles on the officer's command to provide a clear view of\nthe groin area;\n(k) Inmates will then lift their feet so that the officer can clearly see between the toes and the\nsoles;\n(l) Inmate's hands will be visually inspected;\n\n(m) Inmates will be required to bend over and spread the rectum to provide a clear view of the\narea.\nRoberts's summary judgment motion asks this Court to declare these policies unconstitutional; the state seeks\nprecisely the opposite.\n[3]\nC. The ISC\nThe DOC operates the ACI, which currently consists of seven facilities with a total capacity of 3,858 beds. One of\nthe seven facilities that the DOC operates is the ISC. The ISC serves as the receiving facility for all males\ncommitted to the care, custody, and control of the DOC. The Rhode Island State Police, sheriffs, local police\ndepartments, United States Marshals Service, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service all bring\ncommitments to the ISC.\nCommitments housed at the ISC fall into several categories. Some are pretrial detainees, some are newly\nsentenced inmates who await classification to other facilities, some are pretrial protective custody detainees, and\nothers are sentenced protective custody inmates. The length of time an inmate remains committed to the ISC is\napproximately 16.8 days.\nIt is a standard policy at the ISC to strip search each male processed as a commitment. Nevertheless, if\n[4]\nsomeone bails a commitment out of the facility within a very short  period of time, he does not enter the general\npopulation and is not subjected to the routine strip search. The correctional officers at the ISC search inmates in\n181 accordance with the aforementioned DOC policies. Those officers *181 receive training about the strip search\nprocedure in video and lecture form.\nRhode Island has a unified prison system. This means that there are no regional facilities to house pretrial\ndetainees before they are tried and sentenced. The ISC is, therefore, considered a maximum security prison. The\naffidavit suggests that the strip search policies ensure the facility's security, which consists of an integrated\ngeneral population. The ISC's commitments are out of their cells for approximately eight hours each day, during\nwhich time they commingle with the other commitments in different areas of the facility. The strip searches have\nresulted in the discovery of contraband in the past. Although none of the incident reports supplied by the\ndefendants indicates that contraband was found during visual body cavity searches, one report did discuss an\ninmate who had secreted cocaine in a plastic bag in his mouth. The strip search of Roberts yielded no weapons\nor contraband.\nIII. Discussion\nThe question that this Court must answer is whether the DOC's policies requiring all of the ISC's commitments to\n[5]\nundergo a visual strip and body cavity search  comports with the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against\nunreasonable searches. Upon careful review of the stipulated facts and relevant policies, the Court finds those\npolicies to be unconstitutional.\nAny analysis of the policies in issue necessarily begins with Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In that case, the Supreme Court of the United States considered whether a policy requiring\npretrial detainees at a federal detention facility to expose their body cavities to visual inspection after contact\nvisits with persons outside the institution was constitutional. Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. In holding that the policy\ndid not violate the petitioners' Fourth Amendment rights, the Supreme Court defined the parameters of the\nreasonableness inquiry in these kinds of cases:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\n\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861.\nSince the Court's decision in Wolfish, the courts of appeals have addressed myriad strip search policies applied\nto arrestees and detainees. See, e.g., Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986)(holding unconstitutional blanket\njail policy of subjecting all arrestees to strip and visual body cavity searches); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago,\n723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983)\n182 (holding unconstitutional city policy of subjecting all females arrested and detained to strip and visual body cavity \n*182 searches); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981)(finding policy to strip search all detainees for\nweapons or contraband unconstitutional). But see, e.g., Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, Ky., 823 F.2d 955 (6th\nCir.1987)(upholding as constitutional strip search policy requiring strip and visual body cavity search of all\ninmates being moved from one security area of a prison to another). The United States Court of Appeals for the\nFirst Circuit has also addressed a similar policy.\nIn Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir.1983), the court of appeals considered a strip search policy that provided\nfor routine strip searches of certain maximum security inmates after the inmates had left the prison law library\nand infirmary, and after they had received visitors in the maximum security unit's visiting rooms. Recognizing the\n\"severe if not gross interference with a person's privacy that occurs when guards conduct a visual inspection of\nbody cavities,\" a divided court of appeals upheld the policy in question due in large part to the nature of the\nfacility and the \"particularly dangerous prisoners\" confined therein. Id. at 887 (noting that 83% of inmates\nconfined to the facility \"were serving maximum sentences of more than 10 years\").\nAlmost fourteen years after Arruda, the court of appeals revisited Bell in Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st\nCir.1997). In Swain, the court addressed anew the standard set forth in Wolfish. Noting that other courts of\nappeals had concluded that \"to be reasonable under Wolfish, strip and visual body cavity searches must be\njustified by at least a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons,\" the First\nCircuit adopted the reasonable suspicion standard as well. Id. at 7 (\"Accordingly, it is clear that at least the\nreasonable suspicion standard governs strip and visual body cavity searches in the arrestee context as well.\"). \nSee also Weber, 804 F.2d at 802 (adopting reasonable suspicion standard), quoted in Wachtler v. County of\nHerkimer, 35 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.1994).\nThe facts in Swain were different from the facts in the case now under consideration. In Swain, 117 F.3d at 1,\npolice officers arrested the plaintiff (\"Swain\") and her boyfriend for possession of marijuana and theft. Police pat-\nfrisked the plaintiff at the scene and then transported her and her boyfriend to the police station. Swain was taken\nto a booking area and her information was processed by a female employee. During the booking process, Swain\nwas permitted to use the bathroom unobserved. She then made a telephone call to her lawyer. Upon concluding\nthe conversation, she was again pat-frisked and placed in a holding cell. Id. at 3.\nSwain was in the cell for approximately twenty minutes when a male officer entered the cell to interrogate her\nabout her boyfriend's criminal activities. The officer became angry when Swain insisted that she knew nothing\nabout those activities. The officer then departed. Five to ten minutes later, a female employee of the department\nentered the cell and informed Swain that she would have to submit to a strip search. The subsequent strip and\nvisual body cavity search revealed no contraband or weapons. Id. at 3-4.\nAlthough the facts of Swain are different from the facts in the case at bar, this Court must adhere to the standard\npropounded by the court of appeals. To pass muster under that standard, a strip and visual body cavity\nconducted in this circuit must be based at least upon a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing\ncontraband or weapons.\n183 Even the most cursory glance at the policies propounded by the DOC for use at *183 the ISC indicates that they\nare constitutionally deficient. Policy number 5.15.05-2, the policy that governs the admission of new commitments\nto the ISC, contains no language concerning what factors might give rise to the reasonable suspicion that would\npermit a constitutional strip and visual body cavity search. Policy number 9.14-1 states that strip searches for\ncontrolling contraband in the facility shall \"be conducted for objective purposes only.\" Nevertheless, it does not\n\nprovide any guideposts respecting which objective criteria might give rise to reasonable suspicion, which would\npermit a constitutional strip and visual body cavity search. See, e.g., Weber, 804 F.2d at 802 (dicta suggesting\nthat particularized suspicion might arise from the nature of the charge and the specific circumstances surrounding\nthe arrest); Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1087 (6th Cir.1983)(holding strip search constitutional where police\narrested the plaintiff for felonious assault); Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (finding blanket search policy unconstitutional\nas applied to plaintiff where, inter alia, offense of drunken driving was \"one not commonly associated by its very\nnature with the possession of weapons or contraband\"). In fact, the policies evidence no exceptions to the firm\nrule that all commitments to the ISC are to be subjected to a strip and visual body cavity search.\nWhile this Court is mindful of the DOC's need to implement and maintain policies that will promote order within\nthe ACI and particularly the ISC, the Court is also aware of \"the severe if not gross interference with a person's\nprivacy that occurs when guards conduct a visual inspection of body cavities.\" Arruda, 710 F.2d at 887. As the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit admonished in Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013: \"An indiscriminate\nstrip search policy routinely applied to detainees such as [Roberts] along with all other detainees cannot be\nconstitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.\" Thus,\nwhile some strip and visual body cavity searches at the ISC will, no doubt, be constitutionally permissible, the\ncurrent indiscriminate practice of subjecting all commitments to those searches cannot pass Fourth Amendment\nscrutiny.\nBased upon the stipulated statement of facts, the facts submitted by the defendants in support of their motion for\nsummary judgment, and a careful survey of the precedential landscape, this Court concludes that DOC policies\n5.15.05-2 and 9.14.1 do not comport with Swain's reasonable suspicion standard and are therefore\nunconstitutional. In light of this determination, the Court also concludes that those policies, as applied to Roberts,\nviolated his right to be free from an unreasonable search in violation of 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\nIV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons stated herein, the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on Count One of the First\nAmended Complaint is GRANTED. The Court hereby declares DOC policy number 15.5.05-2 and DOC policy\nnumber 9.14-1 unconstitutional because they violate the Fourth Amendment. Furthermore, the Court restrains\nand enjoins the defendants' from conducting strip and visual body cavity searches in accordance with those\npolicies.\nThe plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on Count Two of the First Amended Complaint is moot. It\nrelates to a class action, and by a Memorandum and Order dated January 6, 2000, the Court denied the plaintiff's\nmotion to certify a class.\nThe defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\n184 AMENDED DECISION\n*184\nOn March 16, 2000, this Court issued a Memorandum and Decision (\"March 16 Decision\") in this action. That\nMemorandum and Decision enjoined the defendants from conducting certain strip and visual body cavity\nsearches and declared two Department of Corrections policies relating to those searches to be unconstitutional.\nOn March 22, 2000, the defendants moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 for a clarification of that decision.\nI. Discussion\n\nA. The Caption\nThe defendant's first request for clarification concerns the case caption included in the Court's March 16\nDecision. On January 5, 2000, the Court granted the plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint. The plaintiff filed\nhis First Amended Complaint on January 28, 2000. That complaint substituted new defendants for the Jane and\nJohn Doe defendants included in the caption of the initial complaint.\nThe defendants have asked this Court to amend its March 16 Decision to reflect the caption as it appeared in the\ninitial complaint. Defendants assert that they were never served with a copy of the First Amended Complaint; the\nCourt's file supports that assertion. The Court therefore grants the defendants' motion to amend on this ground,\nand amends the March 16, 2000, decision to include the caption listed in this Amended Decision.\nB. The Substantive Clarification\nThe defendants next ask for a clarification of the scope of the Court's declaration and the injunctive relief\nrewarded. Particularly, the defendants argue that the March 16 Decision, as written, nullifies DOC policies\n15.5.05-2 and 9.14-1 in toto, thus prohibiting the use of other security procedures contained within those\ndocuments. The Court amends its March 16 Decision and declares unconstitutional the strip and visual body\ncavity search provisions of policies 15.5.05-2 and 9.14-1 insofar as those policies are universally applied to pre-\narraignment detainees without any prior determination that there is a reasonable suspicion that the individual may\nbe carrying weapons or contraband.\nFinally, the defendants have asked this Court to amend the March 16 Decision to narrow the scope of the\ninjunctive relief granted. The defendants aver that, as written, the March 16 Decision enjoins all strip and visual\nbody cavity searches at the Department of Corrections. To clarify this confusion as to the scope of the injunctive\nrelief afforded in the March 16 Decision, the Court amends it to enjoin the Department of Corrections from\nconducting strip and visual body cavity searches of pre-arraignment detainees that are not found upon a\n[1]\nreasonable suspicion that the particular detainee is concealing weapons or contraband.\nII. Conclusion\nThe Court hereby amends its March 16, 2000, Memorandum and Decision to be consistent with the text of this\nAmended Decision.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] In support of their motions for summary judgment, the parties submitted a joint factual stipulation pursuant to\nD.R.I. Loc. R. 12.1. Unless otherwise stated, the Court draws the relevant facts from that document and the\nexhibits that accompany it.\n[2] Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 8-10-3.1(c)(8), a duly appointed master of the family court has the power to\nissue a \"capias and/or body attachment.\" Black's Law Dictionary defines the term \"capias,\" also termed \"body\nexecution,\" as \"[a]ny of various types of writs that require an officer to take a named defendant into custody.\"\nBlack's Law Dictionary 199 (7th ed.1999).\n[3] The Court draws the following facts from the affidavit of A.T Wall II (\"Wall\") and the documentation that\naccompanied it. At the time of the filing, Wall was Interim Director of the DOC. The defendants submitted his\naffidavit in support of their motion for summary judgment.\n[4] Neither policy in issue defines a \"very short\" period of time.\n\n[5] In support of their motion for summary judgment, the defendants seek to classify the searches in question as\nstrip searches. Clearly, the searches in issue involved visual body cavity searches as well. As the court of\nappeals noted in Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 561 n. 3 (1st Cir.1985): \nA \"strip search,\" though an umbrella term, generally refers to an inspection of a naked individual, without any\nscrutiny of the subject's body cavities. A \"visual body cavity search\" extends to visual inspection of the anal and\ngenital areas. A \"manual body cavity search\" includes some degree of touching or probing of body cavities.\n[1] The Court will not revisit the paramenters of the reasonable suspicion calculus, as the March 16 Decision\nalready addresses the issue.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

      "text": "239 F.3d 107 (2001)\nCraig L. ROBERTS, Sr., Plaintiff, Appellee,\nv.\nState of RHODE ISLAND, George Vose, in His Capacity as Director of the Rhode Island\nDepartment of Corrections, Defendants, Appellants.\nNo. 00-1752.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, First Circuit.\nHeard December 8, 2000.\nDecided February 13, 2001.\n108 *108 Rebecca Tedford Partington, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Sheldon Whitehouse, Attorney\nGeneral, was on brief, for appellants.\nGregory A. Bรถlzle, with whom Brown, Todd & Heyburn, PLLC and Thomas W. Kelly, were on brief, for appellee.\n[*]\nBefore TORRUELLA, Chief Judge, BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, and SARIS,  District Judge.\nTORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\nTwo Rhode Island Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") policies provide that all males committed to the state\n[1]\nprison be subject to a strip search and a visual body cavity search  upon incarceration as a matter of routine\nprocedure. Appellee Craig Roberts challenged these policies as unconstitutional. The district court agreed that\nthe policies were unconstitutional, holding that this Court's decision in Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st\nCir.1997), required that corrections officers have a reasonable suspicion that an individual was concealing\ncontraband prior to conducting a strip and visual body cavity search. Roberts v. Rhode Island, No. 99-259ML, slip\nop. at 13-17 (D.R.I. March 16, 2000). Rhode Island now appeals. Because we find that the Rhode Island policy\ndoes not meet the reasonableness test of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447\n(1979), we affirm the holding of the district court.\nBACKGROUND\nOn April 20, 1999, Roberts was a passenger in a car stopped for expired registration stickers. After a computer\n[2]\ncheck revealed that Roberts was the subject of an \"outstanding body attachment,\"  the officers performed a\npat-down frisk and placed him in custody. Although Roberts produced a September 1, 1998 order withdrawing the\nattachment, he was not released. Instead, he was transported to the Intake Services Center (\"Intake\") at the\nAdult Correctional Institution (\"ACI\") in Cranston, Rhode Island.\nUpon reaching Intake, Roberts was photographed, fingerprinted, and asked to submit to a blood test, which he\n109 refused. Officers then performed a strip search and visual bodily cavity search, pursuant to two *109 DOC\n[3]\npolicies.  As part of the search, corrections officers inspected the inside of Roberts' mouth and nose and the\nsoles of his feet. Roberts was also ordered to spread his buttocks, at which time officers visually inspected his\nbody cavity. At no time during the search did an officer touch Roberts. No contraband was found on Roberts'\nperson. Roberts was subjected to a second similar search the same day before being transferred and ultimately\nreleased from police custody.\nAppellants argue that the strip and visual body cavity search is necessary because of the unique nature of the\nIntake facility. Unlike many jurisdictions, Rhode Island does not have regional facilities to house pretrial detainees\nprior to trial and sentencing. Intake acts as the receiving facility for all male inmates committed to the care and\ncustody of the DOC, including those arrested on an outstanding warrant, ordered held without bail, or unable to\n\n[4]\npost bail.  Because Rhode Island has a unified prison system, pretrial detainees held at Intake mix with the\ngeneral prison population. Intake is itself considered a maximum security prison.\nDISCUSSION\nBoth convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees retain constitutional rights despite their incarceration, including\nbasic Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. Bell, 441 U.S. at 545, 99 S.Ct.\n110 1861. *110 However, those rights may be subject to restrictions and limitations based on the fact of confinement,\nthe legitimate goals and policies of the penal institution, and the need of the institution to maintain security and\ninternal order. Id. at 545-46, 99 S.Ct. 1861. \"When an institutional restriction infringes a specific constitutional\nguarantee,\" 00 here, the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches, 00 \"the practice must be\n97 97\nevaluated in the light of the central objective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional security.\" Id. at\n546, 99 S.Ct. 1861. This evaluation is a deferential one, giving due regard to the \"professional expertise of\ncorrections officials,\" id. at 548, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (citing Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 827, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41\nL.Ed.2d 495 (1974)), and the limited role of the judiciary in operating and supervising correctional facilities, see\nid. (citing Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 405, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974)).\nIn Bell, the Supreme Court specifically addressed a strip and visual body cavity search conducted of all inmates\nafter every contact with an outside visitor. Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Although the Court admitted that the practice\nof examining inmates' body cavities \"instinctively [gave it] the most pause,\" the Court upheld the search. Id. In\ndetermining that the search was reasonable, the Court balanced \"the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. More specifically, the Court\ninstructed courts to \"consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Id. After weighing these considerations, the\nCourt found that \"visual body cavity searches [in the prison context] can `be conducted on less than probable\ncause.'\" Swain, 117 F.3d at 6 (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861).\nThis Court held in Swain that, at least in the context of prisoners held in local jails for minor offenses, the Bell\nbalance requires officers to have a reasonable suspicion that a particular detainee harbors contraband prior to\nconducting a strip or visual body cavity search. Swain, 117 F.3d at 7. Appellants argue that the heightened\nsecurity concerns of the Intake facility allow for per se searches of committed inmates even absent individualized\nsuspicion. Appellants also suggest that the requirement of judicial intervention (i.e., either an outstanding warrant\nor a judicial order) to commit an inmate to Intake changes the Bell calculation. We reconsider the Bell factors in\nlight of these distinctions to determine if the Rhode Island policies are unreasonable searches prohibited by the\nFourth Amendment.\nWe begin with the \"scope of the particular intrusion.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. In Swain, we\nrecognized that visual body cavity searches \"impinge seriously upon\" Fourth Amendment values. 117 F.3d at 7.\nWe had previously termed such searches a \"severe if not gross interference with a person's privacy.\" Arruda v.\nFair, 710 F.2d 886, 887 (1st Cir.1983). And although our language has not been as strident as that of the Seventh\nCircuit, see Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983) (describing such searches as,\namong other things, \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, embarrassing and repulsive\"), we consider such\nsearches an \"extreme intrusion\" on personal privacy and \"an offense to the dignity of the individual,\" Wood v.\nClemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1996). The search required by Rhode Island DOC policy is no exception:\nalthough Roberts was admittedly not touched by corrections officials, he was forced to display his genitals, as\nwell as to spread his legs so that officials could observe his body cavity.\nWe next turn to the government interest at stake here, that is, the \"justification for initiating\" the search. Bell, 441\nU.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. In this case, that interest is primarily a concern for institutional security. This Court\n111 has recognized *111 that institutional security is a legitimate need of law enforcement, and may provide a\ncompelling reason for a warrantless strip search absent reasonable suspicion of individual wrongdoing. Swain,\n117 F.3d at 7. Indeed, in Bell, the Supreme Court allowed searches of all inmates who had entertained visitors,\neven if there was no suspicion that an individual inmate had received contraband from a visitor. In Arruda, we\nupheld a search of all inmates returning from the law library and infirmary, as well as those inmates receiving\n\nvisitors. 710 F.2d at 888. We focused on the fact that the prison was a maximum-security one, that the inmate in\nquestion had been confined to a \"special security area\" for particularly dangerous inmates, and that the \"record\n[contained] a lengthy history of prison contraband problems.\" Id. In contrast, we were unconvinced by institutional\nsecurity concerns in Swain, because the arrestee there was held in a local jail and posed \"no risk\" of contact with\nother prisoners. 117 F.3d at 8.\nThe institutional security concerns in play here fall somewhere between those exhibited in Swain, which were\ninsufficient to support a search, and those in Arruda and Bell, which made broad-based searches without\nindividual suspicion reasonable. For the reasons detailed below, we think that the Rhode Island policies fall on\nthe Swain side of the constitutional line.\nFirst, unlike in Bell or Arruda, Rhode Island does not limit its searches to prisoners who have had contact with\noutside visitors. Courts have given prisons far more leeway in conducting searches of inmates with outside\ncontact than in searching everyone, simply because such visits often allow smuggling of contraband. See Bell,\n441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861; Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253 (6th Cir.1989) (citing the \"obvious risk\"\nthat visits may be used to introduce contraband); Arruda, 710 F.2d at 888. Although inmates such as Roberts\ncertainly have the opportunity to introduce contraband to the prison, and may have even done so in the past, it is\nfar less likely that smuggling of contraband will occur subsequent to an arrest (when the detainee is normally in\nhandcuffed custody) than during a contact visit that may have been arranged solely for the purpose of introducing\ncontraband to the prison population. Furthermore, after an arrest the Rhode Island authorities should be able to\ndetect contraband on the person of a detainee without the need for a body cavity inspection. In addition, the\ndeterrent rationale for the Bell search is simply less relevant given the essentially unplanned nature of an arrest\nand subsequent incarceration. See Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir.1984).\nSecond, although the Intake facility is maximum security, it is not a \"prison within a prison\" like that where Arruda\nwas held. Arruda, 710 F.2d at 887. Prison officials had no reason to believe that Roberts was one of the \"most\ndangerous inmates ... whose continued retention in the general institution population is detrimental to the\nprogram of the institution,\" id. at 887 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 127 ยง 39), nor did Rhode Island differentiate\nits search to focus on such inmates. Unlike in Arruda, everyone at Intake was searched upon admission to the\nfacility. While it is a reasonable approach to safeguarding institutional security to engage in extra efforts to ensure\nthat the most dangerous inmates do not have access to weapons or contraband, the extension of the intrusion to\nfar less dangerous inmates (such as Roberts) is a severe incursion on privacy frowned upon by the Bell\nbalancing test. The fact that it requires some type of judicial order for an inmate to be committed to Intake does\nnot change this assessment: the temporary incarceration of Roberts for his failure to appear indicates that both\n[5]\nhighly dangerous and relatively harmless offenders may be incarcerated with judicial approval.\n112 *112 Third, courts have given prisons latitude to premise searches on the type of crime for which an inmate is\nconvicted or arrested. The reasonable suspicion standard may be met simply by the fact that the inmate was\ncharged with a violent felony. See Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1087 (6th Cir.1983). However, when the\ninmate has been charged with only a misdemeanor involving minor offenses or traffic violations, crimes not\ngenerally associated with weapons or contraband, courts have required that officers have a reasonable suspicion\nthat the individual inmate is concealing contraband. See Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.1986)\n(misdemeanors); Stewart v. County of Lubbock, 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir. 1985) (misdemeanors); Giles, 746\nF.2d at 617 (traffic violations and other minor offenses); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394 (10th Cir.1984) (traffic\nviolations); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73 (misdemeanors); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th\nCir.1981) (DWI). Roberts was picked up on an outstanding warrant from a family court; no evidence was adduced\nto indicate that his offense was the type normally associated with weapons or contraband. Moreover, Rhode\nIsland has made no effort to engage in this sort of particularized approach, preferring to search all entrants to\nIntake.\nFourth, a policy of searching all inmates is more reasonable when the record indicates a \"lengthy history of\ncontraband problems.\" Arruda, 710 F.2d at 887. Although the record here does indicate a lengthy history of\ncontraband problems, a close examination of that record indicates that a body cavity search was (with possibly\n[6]\none exception) entirely unnecessary to discover that contraband. Cf. Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272-73 (only a\nfew items recovered from body cavities). The lack of specific instances where a body cavity search was\n\nnecessary to discover contraband supports a finding that the policy of searching all inmates is an unreasonable\none. Furthermore, the record indicates that less invasive (and less constitutionally problematic) searches would\nhave been equally as effective in revealing contraband. For example, lacking reasonable suspicion that an\nindividual is hiding contraband, Rhode Island could still search that person's clothes, a far less intrusive\nprocedure than a full-scale strip and body cavity search. See id. at 1271.\nIn short, although appellants have cited \"institutional security\" as a sufficient reason not to require reasonable\nsuspicion for inmate body cavity searches, their only justification for this severe invasion is that Intake is a\nmaximum security facility where arrestees mingle with the general population. Intermingling of inmates is a\nserious security concern that weighs in favor of the reasonableness, and constitutionality, of the search. See \nDobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, 823 F.2d 955, 959 (6th Cir.1987) (upholding \"a more narrowly drawn policy\" of\nsearching those to be moved into the general jail population); Dufrin, 712 F.2d at 1087 (inmate would come into\ncontact with general population); Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (noting lack of intermingling). Several courts, however,\nhave held that intermingling alone is insufficient to justify a search without reasonable suspicion. Chapman v.\nNichols, 989 F.2d 393, 396 (10th Cir.1993); Masters, 872 F.2d at 1254. Another has noted that intermingling is a\n113 dubious reason for a strip search because it is inherently \"limited and avoidable.\" Giles, 746 F.2d at 619*113\n(citing Smith v. Montgomery County, 547 F.Supp. 592, 598-99 (D.Md.1982)). We agree with these courts that the\nunified nature of the Rhode Island prison system is not, in itself, dispositive of the reasonableness of the search.\nTo place so much weight on one (potentially alterable) characteristic of the state prison system would gut the\nbalancing approach endorsed by the Supreme Court in Bell and applied by this Court in Swain and Arruda.\nThe Bell balancing test also instructs us to consider the place in which the search is conducted and the manner in\nwhich it is conducted. 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Neither aspect of this search is problematic. The policy\nrequires the search to be conducted by officers of the same sex of the inmate. It appears from the record that the\n[7]\nsearch is generally conducted in private.  Moreover, the search is entirely visual and there have been no\naccusations of abuse. Given the intrusive nature of a strip and visual body cavity search, Rhode Island has\nendeavored to perform these searches in a relatively private manner. See Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961\nF.2d 188, 193 (11th Cir.1992).\nCONCLUSION\n\"Bell has not been read as holding that the security interests of a detention facility will always outweigh the\nprivacy interests of the detainees.\" Dobrowolskyj, 823 F.2d at 957. Our previous decisions have also indicated\nthat the Fourth Amendment balance cannot be shifted so quickly. See Swain, 117 F.3d at 7-8. This is not to say\nthat prison officials are hamstrung in their efforts to protect the security of penal institutions. Both the Supreme\nCourt in Bell and this Court in Arruda have suggested that an individualized reasonable suspicion is not\nnecessary to search certain groups of inmates, such as those who receive visitors; other circuits have suggested\nthat broad-based strip search policies may be appropriate in other circumstances. See, e.g., Giles, 746 F.2d at\n617. Of course, officers may meet the reasonable suspicion standard based on their observations of a particular\ninmate during a less invasive pat-down frisk and clothing search, or based on contraband found during that\nsearch. However, \"[a]n indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied ... can not be justified simply on the\nbasis of administrative ease in attending to security considerations.\" Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013. Standing alone,\nthe security concerns of the Intake facility cannot support the search policy here as it applies to minor offenses.\nThe policy is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment.\nAffirmed.\n[*] Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n[1] A \"strip search\" involves a visual inspection of the naked body of an inmate. A \"visual body cavity search\" is a\nstrip search that includes the visual examination of the anal and genital areas. Security & Law Enforcement\nEmployees v. Carey, 737 F.2d 187, 192 (2d Cir.1984).\n\n[2] Under R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 8-10-3.1(c)(8), a magistrate has the power to issue a \"body attachment\" upon the\nfailure of a party to appear for a judicial proceeding. Such a writ allows officers to take the defendant into custody\nif the family court is not in session. See Roberts, slip. op. at 3.\n[3] The first policy, Operational Memorandum 5.15.05-2 Part V.B. (dated June 15, 1984), provides (in relevant\npart) that: \nEach new commitment's person, clothing, and personal belongings shall be thoroughly searched for contraband.\n1. The commitment officer shall thoroughly search the inmate's body to include examination of hair, arms, hands,\nears, mouth, nose; visual examination of groin and rectum; toes and soles of feet.\n(a) Any artificial limbs, dentures, or bandages shall be carefully examined.\n2. The new commitment's clothing and belongings shall be thoroughly searched to include examination of all\npockets, cuffs, seams, hat bands, waistbands, zippers, and collars; all clothing shall be turned inside-out and\nlinings checked; soles, heels, socks, and inside of all shoes shall be examined; the contents of any and all\nluggage, packages, bags, etc. shall be thoroughly examined.\nThe second policy, Policy and Procedure 9.14-1 Part III.B.2. (dated January 27, 1997), provides that:\na. Strip searches of inmates will always be conducted for objective purposes only and will always be carried out\nin an expeditious and efficient manner. They will never be done for punitive purposes or as a form of harassment.\n(1) Strip searches shall be conducted under the direction of the Shift Supervisor or other Superior Officer, or as\nrequired by policy.\n(2) Two Correctional Officers shall be assigned to conduct a strip search.\n(3) Strip searches shall be conducted by officers of the same sex as the inmates being searched, except during\nemergencies.\n(4) The following search plan shall be followed when conducting a strip search. The officer will examine:\n(a) All pockets;\n(b) Run fingers over linings, seams, collars, cuffs, waistbands and fly;\n(c) Shoes, inside soles and heels;\n(d) Socks, turning them inside out;\n(e) False teeth, artificial limbs, plaster casts;\n(f) Inmates will run their fingers through their hair. Officers will check for wigs and hairpieces;\n(g) Inmates ears [sic] will be checked inside and out;\n(h) The officer will look inside the inmate's nose;\n(i) Inmates will open their mouths, lift their tongues, and roll each lip, for the officer's view;\n(j) Inmates will lift their penises and testicles on the officer's command to provide a clear view of the groin area;\n(k) Inmates will then lift their feet so that the officer can clearly see between the toes and the soles;\n(l) Inmate's hands will be visually inspected;\n(m) Inmates will be required to bend over and spread the rectum to provide a clear view of the area.\n\n[4] No inmate is sent to Intake without judicial authority, i.e., without an outstanding warrant or other judicial\naction. Most arrestees charged with minor offenses are committed briefly to local jails.\n[5] Moreover, this assessment does not even account for the fact that in Roberts' specific case, the body\nattachment had been revoked and his incarceration was apparently unwarranted.\n[6] Attached to the Affidavit of A.T. Wall II, the Interim Director of the Rhode Island DOC, are numerous incident\nreports of contraband discovery during the Intake admission process. With only one exception (where the inmate\nhad hidden cocaine in his mouth), all the contraband was found in the inmate's clothing. Appellants have\nadduced no evidence of contraband that would not have been discovered without the visual body cavity search.\n[7] The DOC policy provides for searches to be \"conducted in a private area, away from public view.\"\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
