Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, alleged his constitutional rights were violated when Defendants strip-searched him four times.  Plaintiff alleged the strip-searches were unreasonable, violated his privacy and equal protection rights, and were cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  Plaintiff additionally alleged state law claims of negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Plaintiff later dropped his claims relating to three of the strip searches.</p><p>The parties stipulated that on September 7, 1993, Plaintiff was taken to the Fayette District Court for arraignment.  Plaintiff was strip-searched according to Defendants' policy to strip-search all pretrial detainees after arraignment who would be remaining in their facility.  Plaintiff alleged that strip-searching him without individualized reasonable suspicion violated his rights and that strip-searching detainees after arraignments was unjustified because officers maintained control over detainees during the arraignment process.</p><p>On September 30, 1996, the District Court (Judge Karl S. Forester) granted summary judgment for Defendants on Plaintiff's federal claims and declined jurisdiction over Plaintiff's remaining state law clams.  The Court held that Defendant's policy of strip-searching pretrial detainees, even those held for minor, nonviolent traffic offenses, upon their return from the courtroom to the general population of the detention center was reasonable.  The Court found that (1) Defendant's policy of searching detainees who were arraigned and then returned to the detention center was sufficiently narrow, and was distinguishable from searches as part of initial booking procedures; and (2) there were sufficient opportunities for detainees to get contraband during the arraignments to justify Defendant's strip-search policy.

RICHERSON, Plaintiff,\nv.\nLEXINGTON FAYETTE URBAN COUNTY GOVERNMENT, et al., Defendants.\nCivil Action No. 94-337.\nUnited States District Court, E.D. Kentucky.\nSeptember 30, 1996.\nGregory A. Bolzle, Woodward, Hobson & Fulton, Louisville, KY, Mark K. Gray, O'Koon, Menefee & Gray,\nLouisville, KY, Christina R.L. Norris, Louisville, KY, for Robert L. Richerson.\nEdward W. Gardner, Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, Michael H. Baker, Gallion, Baker & Bray,\nP.S.C., Lexington, KY, for defendants.\nOPINION AND ORDER\nFORESTER, District Judge.\nPlaintiff filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 claiming that his civil rights were violated when he was strip\nsearched by the defendants. Originally plaintiff complained of four separate strip searches. Plaintiff alleges in his\ncomplaint that these strip searches were unreasonable under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, violated\nhis right to privacy under the Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments, violated his right to equal\nprotection under the Fourteenth Amendment, and constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth\nand Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiff also alleges state law causes of action for negligence and intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress.\nA pretrial conference was held in this matter on November 13, 1995, at which time the plaintiff advised the Court\n300 that he only intends *300 to pursue his claim pertaining to the strip search conducted after his arraignment in\nFayette District Court on September 7, 1993. The parties were given until November 20, 1995, to file pretrial\nmemoranda on the plaintiff's claim regarding this post-arraignment strip-search. The Court having received the\nparties' memoranda, which are construed as cross-motions for summary judgment, this matter is now ripe for\nreview.\nI. BACKGROUND\nAccording to the joint stipulations submitted by the parties pursuant to the Court's order of November 13, 1995,\nplaintiff Robert L. Richerson was arrested at approximately 1:37 a.m. on September 5, 1993 for a nonviolent\ntraffic offense and taken to the Fayette County Detention Center, where he was held as a pretrial detainee. On\nSeptember 7, 1995, plaintiff was taken to the Fayette District Court for misdemeanor arraignment.\nArraignments are held in Courtroom 5, located on the second floor of the Fayette District Court building, while\nhearings are held on the same floor in Courtroom 3. Pretrial detainees are taken to arraignments or hearings in\nFayette District Court through an enclosed pedway connecting the Fayette County Detention Center with the\nFayette District Court Building. The pedway is considered a secure area of the jail. A door in the pedway opens\ninto a holding cell which is adjacent to Courtroom 5. Another door leads from the holding cell into the Courtroom.\nPrior to bringing detainees into the holding cell adjacent to Courtroom 5 and/or into the courtroom, detention\ncenter officers check the entire area for contraband and weapons.\nIn addition to supervisor Barry Lindsay, a minimum of two male detention center officers are present during the\n[1]\narraignments held in Courtroom 5.  There is also a minimum of one Court bailiff who is employed by the\n\nSheriff's Department. One detention center officer normally stands by the door from the holding area into the\ncourtroom, while the second officer and Lt. Lindsay are stationed in the courtroom. The detention center officers\nposition themselves in such a way as to quarantine off the small area where the detainees are brought into the\ncourtroom. At no time are there more than three detainees in the courtroom at one time, two detainees in the\nchairs located by the detention center officers, and one at the microphone for arraignment. The corrections\nofficers maintain the care, custody, and control of the detainees at all times during the arraignment process, and\nwatch the detainees while they are in the courtroom.\nAttorneys have access to the detainees while they are in the holding area and in the courtroom, but no other\nindividuals have access to the detainees during the arraignment process or in the holding cell. The detainees are\nnot handcuffed during these events. After arraignment, the detainees are placed back into the holding cell until\nthe arraignments are completed.\nThe strip search consists of the detainees removing their jumpsuits and any other clothing they have on. Once\nnaked, the detainees are made to lift up their arms, open their mouths, lift their tongues, run their fingers through\ntheir hair, turn from side to side, lift their genitals and turn around, bend over and spread their buttocks for\ninspection, and show the bottoms of their feet. Plaintiff was strip searched in this manner following his\narraignment.\nII. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\nWhen the parties file cross motions for summary judgment, \"the court must evaluate each party's motion on its\nown merits, taking care in each instance to draw all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is\nunder consideration.\" Lansing Dairy, Inc. v. Espy, 39 F.3d 1339, 1347 (6th Cir.1994),cert. den.,___ U.S. ___, 116\nS.Ct. 50, 133 L.Ed.2d 15 (1995), quoting Taft Broadcasting Co. v. U.S., 929 F.2d 240, 248 (6th Cir.1991), quoting,\nMingus Constructors, Inc. v. U.S., 812 F.2d 1387, 1391 (Fed.Cir.1987).\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the moving party establishes that there is no genuine issue of material fact\n301 for trial and *301 that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The Court must consider all pleadings, depositions,\naffidavits, and admissions on file and draw reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing the motion. \nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); see \nSmith v. Hudson, 600 F.2d 60 (6th Cir.),cert. dismissed,444 U.S. 986, 100 S.Ct. 495, 62 L.Ed.2d 415 (1979).\nOnce the moving party shows that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case, the\nnonmoving party has the burden of coming forward with evidence raising a triable issue of fact. Celotex Corp.,\n477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. at 2553. To sustain this burden, the nonmoving party may not rest on the mere\nallegations of his pleadings. Instead, he must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for\ntrial. Potters Med. Center v. City Hosp. Ass'n., 800 F.2d 568 (6th Cir.1986). Ultimately, the standard for\ndetermining whether summary judgment is appropriate is \"whether the evidence presents a sufficient\ndisagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter\nof law.\" Booker v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., 879 F.2d 1304, 1310 (6th Cir.1989) (quoting Anderson v.\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511-12, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).\nIII. THE MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nAlthough the defendants do not dispute that it is their policy to strip search all pretrial detainees returning from\narraignment court who will be remaining in the facility, plaintiff contends that the defendants' policy is actually to\nstrip search all detainees regardless of whether or not an individual detainee has secured release. According to\nplaintiff, the defendants' policy therefore amounts to nothing more than a blanket policy of strip searching all post-\narraignment misdemeanor detainees. Plaintiff argues that under the applicable law, such a policy of strip\nsearching all pretrial detainees charged with non-violent, misdemeanor traffic offenses is unconstitutional absent\nan individualized reasonable suspicion that the detainee is concealing weapons or contraband. Thus, because\n\nthere was no individual assessment of reasonable suspicion in this case, plaintiff argues that the defendants\nviolated plaintiff's rights when they subjected him to a strip search following his arraignment.\nFurthermore, plaintiff argues that a blanket strip search policy cannot be justified on the basis of administrative\nease in maintaining institutional security and preventing the introduction of contraband into the facility. Such a\npolicy precludes an individualized assessment and determination of reasonable suspicion. Moreover, plaintiff\ncontends that the mere fact that a pretrial detainee might be intermingled with the general population of the\ndetention center is insufficient to support a policy of strip searching pretrial detainees. Finally, although\ndefendants allege that contraband is a problem within the facility, plaintiff argues that the facts demonstrate that\nthere is no problem with pretrial detainees introducing contraband into the facility following their arraignment. At\nmost, plaintiff calculates that pretrial detainees returning from arraignment are involved in an estimated twelve\n[2]\nincidents involving contraband per year.\nPlaintiff also argues that the fact that some detainees may speak with an attorney prior to arraignment does not\nmake the defendants' policy or the strip search of plaintiff reasonable. In this case, plaintiff maintains that he did\nnot speak with an attorney prior to his arraignment. Furthermore, while plaintiff acknowledges that it is possible,\nalbeit improbable, that an attorney might pass contraband while speaking to a detainee, imputing the \"contact\n302 visit\" on one detainee to all detainees is illogical and unreasonable. *302 Furthermore, in light of the fact that\ndetention center officers maintain control of the detainees at all times before, during, and after the arraignment\nprocess, plaintiff contends that it is impossible for a detainee to obtain contraband in the courtroom. Thus, plaintiff\ncontends that the mere fact that pretrial detainees leave the \"secure area\" of the detention center when they\nenter the courtroom does not provide a reasonable justification for the defendants' strip search policy in this case.\nFinally, even if the defendants did make an individualized assessment as to whether plaintiff was concealing\ncontraband prior to subjecting him to the strip search, plaintiff maintains that reasonable suspicion did not exist\nfor such a search.\nThe defendants contend that the crucial issue in this case is the extent to which opportunity for outside contact\nexists when pretrial detainees are taken to the Fayette District Court building for arraignments or hearings. The\ndefendants do not dispute that a blanket policy allowing strip searches of all pretrial detainees, including those\ndetained on minor misdemeanor charges or traffic offenses, is unconstitutional. The defendants also\nacknowledge that the Sixth Circuit has held that authorities may not strip search a person arrested for a traffic\nviolation or other nonviolent minor offense solely because such person ultimately will intermingle with the general\njail population when there are no circumstances to support a reasonable belief that the person will smuggle\ncontraband into the facility. Nevertheless, the defendants contend that the combination of factors in this case\ninvolving intermingling of detainees with the general jail population and the opportunity for outside contact\nsupport the reasonableness of their strip search policy.\nThe defendants argue that all the cases which have held strip search policies unconstitutional involved blanket\npolicies which resulted in the search of all pretrial detainees at the time they initially came into the facility. The\ndefendants thus argue that those cases are distinguishable from the present case, which involves outside contact\nafter the detainee was already in the facility. Furthermore, the defendants identify three opportunities for outside\ncontact while in the Fayette District Court Building. First, attorneys are allowed contact with detainees while they\nare in the holding room. In order for the attorneys to confer with their clients in confidence, no guard is present in\nthe room during these conversations.\nThe second opportunity for contact occurs when the detainee is taken from the holding area into the courtroom\nfor arraignment. Members of the general public are allowed in the courtroom, although they are not permitted in\nthe area where the detainees are seated. While the defendants admit that there are generally three detention\ncenter guards present in the courtroom to observe the detainees and prevent contact, and it is acknowledged that\nthe courtroom and holding area are searched for contraband prior to the detainees being brought to the holding\narea, the defendants argue that there is no guarantee that no mistakes will be made or contraband overlooked.\nThus, defendants contend that the possibility exists, however unlikely, for contact at this stage of the proceeding.\nFinally, the defendants contend that the third opportunity for contact and the transfer of contraband occurs when\nthe inmates brought over from the detention center for arraignment come in contact with the detainees returning\n\nfrom hearings in Courtroom 3. Both the arraignment detainees and the hearing detainees walk over together from\nthe detention center to the Fayette District Court building through the enclosed pedway connecting the two\nbuildings. In order to reach Courtroom 3, those individuals with hearings must pass through public hallways often\ncrowded with individuals, including family members, who are present for arraignments or hearings. In returning\nfrom Courtroom 3 to the holding area, it is again necessary for the hearing detainees to pass through these public\nhallways. While passing through the public hallways, the defendants contend that the hearing detainees have the\nopportunity to come in contact with members of the general public, and it is therefore possible for a hearing\n303 detainee to obtain contraband which can be passed to an *303 arraignment detainee and/or smuggled back into\nthe detention center when both groups of detainees are led back to the detention center through the pedway.\nThe defendants therefore insist that a pretrial detainee has opportunities to obtain contraband because of his own\noutside contacts as well as the outside contacts of other pretrial detainees. Thus, if the detention center had a\npolicy of not strip searching post-arraignment detainees charged with minor or non-violent offenses despite the\nfact that they were exposed to outside contact and were to be placed in the general population, it is argued that\nthe smuggling of contraband into the facility would be relatively easy. For instance, the defendants argue that a\nhearing detainee who obtains contraband while passing through the public hallway, knowing that he would be\nstrip searched upon his return to the detention center, could simply pass the contraband to an arraignment\ndetainee on the way back to the facility, knowing that the arraignment detainee would not be searched. While\nplaintiff might dismiss the seriousness of this problem, the defendants counter that attempts to smuggle\ncontraband into detention facilities are well documented. Furthermore, while the plaintiff might argue that the\npolicy is unnecessary in light of the few occasions when contraband was actually found on detainees returning\nfrom the Fayette District Court building, the defendants maintain that the incident reports document numerous\ninstances when contraband was found in the detention center. While it is not always possible to determine how or\nwhen the contraband entered the facility, it is well recognized that when an inmate has an opportunity for outside\ncontact, the possibility of contraband being smuggled into the detention center increases. Furthermore, the actual\nnumber of times contraband is found is not determinative because in addition to discovering contraband, the\npolicy is also intended to deter the smuggling of contraband into the facility. Thus, the defendants assert that it is\nentirely reasonable for the detention center to implement a policy that calls for the strip search of those detainees\nwho leave the facility and who either directly have outside contact or are exposed to other detainees who have\nhad outside contact.\nIV. ANALYSIS\nAs correctly pointed out by the parties, the Supreme Court considered a Fourth Amendment challenge to strip\nsearches involving pretrial detainees in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In\nreviewing the many alleged constitutional violations in that case, the Supreme Court recognized that:\nthe problems that arise in the day-to-day operation of a corrections facility are not susceptible of\neasy solutions. Prison administrators therefore should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the\nadoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve\ninternal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security. Such considerations are\npeculiarly within the province and professional expertise of corrections officials, and, in the\nabsence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their\nresponse to these considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such\nmatters.\nId. at 547-58, 99 S.Ct. at 1878-79 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nTurning to the question of whether strip searches could be conducted following every contact visit between an\ninmate, including a pretrial detainee, and a person from outside the institution absent probable cause to believe\nthat a particular inmate was concealing contraband, the Court employed the following balancing test in finding\nthat the searches were not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\n\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\n304 the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for *304 initiating it,\nand the place in which it is conducted.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85. The Court further noted, \"A detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious\nsecurity dangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence.\"\nId. In addition, the Court pointed out that the fact that only one inmate had been \"discovered attempting to\nsmuggle contraband into the institution on his person may be more a testament to the effectiveness of this search\ntechnique as a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmates to secrete and import such items\nwhen the opportunity arises.\" Id. Thus, after balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the\ninstitution against the privacy interest of the inmates, the Court determined that probable cause was not needed\nprior to conducting the strip searches.\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has also considered cases involving strip searches of pretrial detainees. In \nDobrowolskyj v. Jefferson County, KY., 823 F.2d 955 (6th Cir.1987), plaintiff-appellant Jaroslaw Dobrowolskyj was\narrested on a misdemeanor charge of menacing and held at the Jefferson County Jail awaiting a lawyer to post\nhis $100 bond. When other detainees arrived, causing the holding cell to become overcrowded, six prisoners,\nincluding Dobrowolskyj, had to be moved into the rear security area where the general jail population was\nhoused. Dobrowolskyj challenged the department policy of strip searching prisoners prior to their move to the\nrear area.\nIn considering the strip search policy in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Bell v. Wolfish, the Sixth Circuit\nstated:\nBell has not been read as holding that the security interests of a detention facility will always\noutweigh the privacy interests of the detainees. The balancing test must be applied in each case\nand the particular search must still be reasonable under the fourth amendment. The majority of\nthe circuits have held unconstitutional blanket strip search policies of all inmates including those\ndetained only on minor misdemeanor charges or traffic offenses. These courts have held that\nautomatic strip searches of all detainees violate the fourth amendment without a reasonable\nsuspicion, based on the nature of the charge, the characteristics of the detainee, or the\ncircumstances of the arrest, that the detainee is concealing contraband.\nDobrowolskyj, 823 F.2d at 957.\nTurning to Dobrowolskyj's argument that it should hold that blanket searches of all misdemeanor detainees are\nunreasonable under the fourth amendment, the Court applied the balancing test from Bell v. Wolfish and found\nthat the search was not unreasonable. The Court distinguished cases from other circuits finding such blanket\nsearches of those detained on misdemeanor charges unconstitutional on two grounds. First, the Court found that\nthe nature of the menacing charge against Dobrowolskyj could give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the\ndetainee was concealing contraband or weapons, and was, therefore, different from those cases involving\nsearches of persons detained on minor traffic offenses and misdemeanors not normally associated with weapons\nor contraband. Id. at 958. The Court continued:\nSecond, and more important, Jefferson County's policy was not a blanket search of all detainees\nas in the policies held unconstitutional in the above cases, but a more narrowly drawn policy of\nsearching only those detainees who were required, by force of circumstances, to be moved into\nthe general jail population.\nId. at 959. Thus, noting that the jail \"had legitimate interests in preventing the flow of contraband into the other\nsections of the jail,\" the Court found that the jail's security interests in conducting a search at that point strong.\nMore recently, in Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.),cert. denied,493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct. 503, 107\nL.Ed.2d 506 (1989), the Sixth Circuit considered whether the strip search of a detainee arrested on a bench\nwarrant for failure to appear in court on charges relating to a non-violent traffic offense violated the Fourth\nAmendment. The Court noted that it \"found no authority approving a practice of conducting a strip search of a\n\n305 person arrested for a simple *305 traffic violation in the absence of at least reasonable suspicion that the person\nmight be carrying a weapon, illegal drugs, or other contraband.\" Id. at 1253. The Court continued:\nthe Supreme Court approved a policy of conducting strip searches of pretrial detainees under\ncertain circumstances in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nThese searches were conducted following every contact visit by a detainee with a person from\noutside the institution. There is an obvious risk that such a visit may be used to introduce\ncontraband into a penal institution. While the Court emphasized the wide-ranging deference to be\naccorded the decisions of correction officials with respect to institutional security, it clearly\nprescribes a test of reasonableness based upon a balancing of competing interests....\nId. While the Court pointed out that Bell v. Wolfish does not validate a blanket policy of strip searching pretrial\ndetainees, it does authorize \"particularized searches where objective circumstances indicate such searches are\nneeded to maintain institutional security.\" Id. at 1253-54.\nIn considering the defendants' argument that the strip search was justified because Masters was being moved\nfrom the holding area to a cell on a different floor of the justice center, the Court noted that \"several cases have\nrecognized imminent mingling with other inmates as a consideration in the decision whether to strip search a\ndetainee. However, the fact of intermingling alone has never been found to justify such a search without\nconsideration of the nature of the offense and the question of whether there is any reasonable basis for concern\nthat the particular detainee will attempt to introduce weapons or other contraband into the institution.\" Id. In\nconclusion, the Court noted that:\nall the federal courts of appeals that have considered the issue reached the same conclusion: a\nstrip search of a person arrested for a traffic violation or other minor offense not normally\nassociated with violence and concerning whom there is no individualized reasonable suspicion\nthat the arrestee is carrying or concealing a weapon or other contraband, is unreasonable.... The\nsingle fact that Mrs. Masters, for some reason, would come into contact with other prisoners was\nnot sufficient justification for the search in this case. It did not outweigh the other factors negating\nany claim that such a search was reasonable in this case.\nId. at 1255. Thus, citing Bell v. Wolfish, the Court concluded that a pretrial detainee has the right not to be\nsearched unless the reasonableness of such a search is established by balancing the need for the particular\nsearch against the invasion of personal rights occasioned by the search. Furthermore, the Court concluded that it\nwas clearly established that a person charged with a traffic violation or other nonviolent minor offense may not be\nsubjected to a strip search unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that the particular person might be\ncarrying or concealing contraband.\nIn this case, the parties have stipulated that plaintiff was strip searched following his arraignment in Fayette\nDistrict Court. Plaintiff relies primarily on Masters v. Crouch in urging the Court to find that, because he was only\ncharged with a nonviolent traffic offense, the defendants were precluded from subjecting him to a strip search\nabsent an individualized reasonable suspicion that he was carrying weapons or contraband. However, as pointed\nout by defendants, the search in Masters v. Crouch was part of the initial booking procedure. Masters was first\nfrisked and made to open her blouse while being detained in a \"holding room.\" After being moved to the third floor\n[3]\nof Jefferson County Jail, she was then subjected to a full strip search. Id. at 1250.  Therefore, while plaintiff in\nthis case was charged with a nonviolent traffic offense, the facts and circumstances surrounding the strip search\n306 here following plaintiff's arraignment are distinguishable *306 from those in Masters v. Crouch.\nMoreover, the Court is not presented in this case with a policy of strip searching all pretrial detainees, regardless\nof the charges against them, or solely because they are to be intermingled with the general population of the\ndetention center. In fact, the defendants acknowledge that such a policy of strip searching all detainees, including\nthose held on minor misdemeanor and traffic charges, is unconstitutional, as is a policy of searching a detainee\ncharged with a nonviolent minor offense solely on the basis that the detainee is to be placed in the general\npopulation of the jail. Here, the strip search challenged took place after the plaintiff was returned to the detention\ncenter following his arraignment. Thus, the Court finds that the strip search policy in this case, rather than being a\nblanket policy of strip searching all detainees, is instead a more narrowly drawn policy of searching only those\n\n[4]\ndetainees who are arraigned and then returned to the detention center.  Therefore, the issue before the Court is\nwhether the search here was reasonable under the balancing test set forth in Bell v. Wolfish.\nIt is clear that a detention center has a legitimate interest in preventing the flow of contraband into the facility. As\npreviously pointed out, the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish noted that the smuggling of contraband is \"all too\ncommon an occurrence.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85. While the plaintiff argues that the\nactual number of times contraband is found in the detention center is relatively insignificant, the Court is\nunprepared to discount the seriousness of any occurrence of contraband in a detention center. The Court is also\nmindful of the Supreme Court's suggestion that the lack of contraband \"may be more testament to the\neffectiveness\" of a search policy \"as a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of inmates\" to smuggle\ncontraband when given the opportunity. Id. Thus, the Court is unimpressed by any argument based on the\nperceived lack of documented incidents involving contraband found within the detention center.\nThe plaintiff endeavors in his memorandum to show that the possibility of contraband being passed in the\ncourtroom during arraignment is virtually non-existent due to the ever watchful eyes and presence of the\ndetention center officers. Plaintiff also argues that to the extent contraband is passed by attorneys meeting their\nclients prior to arraignment, it is unlikely that such an occurrence happens with any frequency. While the plaintiff\nmay be correct that the possibility of contraband being passed in the courtroom during arraignment is slight, the\npossibility exists nonetheless. Moreover, the defendants contend that there is a real danger in contraband being\npassed to detainees as they travel the public hallways on their way to hearings in Courtroom 3. It is clear to the\nCourt that such exposure to the general public creates a grave danger of contraband being passed to detainees.\nIt is also clear to the Court that contraband passed to the hearing detainees could easily be passed to\narraignment detainees, even those charged with minor, nonviolent offenses. Thus, while the documented number\nof occurrences may be small, there is a clear risk that contraband will be passed to detainees while in the Fayette\nDistrict Court building. The defendants' search policy is intended to address this potential problem and to deter\ndetainees from such conduct.\nIn applying the balancing test for reasonableness from Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court has counseled wide-\nranging deference to prison officials in security matters. Nevertheless, the security interests of a detention center\nwill not always outweigh the privacy interests of detainees. Moreover, although intermingling is a factor which is\nto be considered in determining the reasonableness of a search policy, as stated numerous times throughout this\n307 opinion and order the mere fact that a person charged with a nonviolent, *307 minor offense is placed in the\ndetention facility's general population does not in and of itself justify a policy of strip searching pretrial detainees.\nHowever, in circumstances like those presented here, where pretrial detainees, including those charged with\nminor, nonviolent offenses, are kept in a detention center's general population prior to arraignment, and are\nthereafter offenses, are kept in a detention center's general population prior to arraignment, and are thereafter\nput in a position where exposure to the general public presents a very real danger of contraband being passed to\na detainee, a policy of strip searching the detainees upon their return from the courthouse and prior to their being\nplaced back in the general population of the detention center is both justified and reasonable. The detention\ncenter's legitimate security interests outweigh the detainees' privacy interests in such a situation.\nV. CONCLUSION\nHaving considered the parties' arguments, reviewed the applicable law, and balanced the need for the particular\nsearch against the invasion of the plaintiff's personal rights, the Court finds that the post-arraignment strip search\nwas reasonable in light of the defendants' legitimate security interest in preventing contraband from being\nsmuggled into the detention center by detainees returning from arraignments and hearings in the Fayette District\nCourt building. The Court further concludes that this finding that the post-arraignment strip search was\nreasonable is dispositive of plaintiff's remaining claims. Finally, having disposed of plaintiff's federal claims, the\nCourt declines to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiff's remaining state law claims. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY\nORDERED that:\n(1) the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's post-arraignment strip search claim [DE # 53] is\nDENIED;\n\n(2) the defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's post-arraignment strip search claim [DE # 54] is\nGRANTED; and\n(3) summary judgment will be entered contemporaneously with this opinion and order in favor of the defendants.\n[1] When female detainees are to be arraigned, there is also one female officer present.\n[2] Plaintiff states that the 1993 executive summaries provided by the defendants show no instances during the\ncalendar year where contraband was found during the strip search of an individual returning from arraignment\ncourt, although cigarettes were found on two felony offenders returning from circuit court and on one individual\nreturning from work release.\n[3] The Court also notes that Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983), cited in Masters v.\nCrouch and by the defendant, involved strip searches of women arrested on misdemeanors who were searched\nwhile awaiting the arrival of bail money.\n[4] Although the plaintiff argues that the defendants' policy is to strip search all detainees following arraignment,\nincluding those who are to be released, the defendants contend that they only search those who will be returned\nto the general population. Nevertheless, as pointed out by the defendants, the issue in this case is whether the\npolicy was unreasonable as applied to plaintiff. Here, plaintiff was returned to the general population following his\narraignment.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
