On May 17, 2000 (the day the District Court issued its injunctive order in the Roberts case), Rhode Island abandoned the challenged policy. Thereafter, on May 30, 2000, the plaintiffs in this case, a group of individuals who had been arrested for non-violent, non-drug related misdemeanors and had been subjected to the proscribed strip and body cavity search policy before its abolition on May 17, 2000, filed this 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. Plaintiffs alleged that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated when they were subjected to the ACI's pre-May 17, 2000 blanket policy of conducting strip and body cavity searches of all new entrants to the facility (including misdemeanant arrestees), despite the absence of reasonable suspicion. Plaintiffs claimed that, as a result of the constitutional violations, they were entitled to monetary damages.</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, Craig L. Roberts, Sr., the plaintiff in the Roberts case, was also among the plaintiffs seeking monetary damages in this subsequently filed lawsuit. The District Court, at the request of Defendants, dismissed Roberts's claim on grounds of res judicata. The defendant jail officials then moved for summary judgment against the remaining plaintiffs on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity because, prior to the Roberts decision, it was not clearly established that the ACI policy violated the Constitution. The District Court (Judge Mary M. Lisi) agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>Initially, a First Circuit panel reversed the District Court's judgment. Savard v. Rhode Island, 320 F.3d 34 (1st Cir. 2003). Upon granting rehearing en banc, however, a divided First Circuit reversed the panel decision and affirmed the District Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants. The en banc Court reasoned that the jail officials were entitled to qualified immunity since, at the time the searches were conducted (prior to the Roberts decision), it was not yet clearly established that the blanket strip search policy at issue was unconstitutional. Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs subsequently sought but were denied Certiorari by the United States Supreme Court. Savard v. Rhode Island, 540 U.S. 1109 (2004). The case now appears to be closed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "text": "338 F.3d 23 (2003)\nAngela SAVARD, et al., Plaintiffs, Appellants,\nv.\nState of RHODE ISLAND, et al., Defendants, Appellees.\nNo. 02-1568.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, First Circuit.\nHeard November 6, 2002.\nDecided August 4, 2003.\n2245 *24*25 Gregory A. Belzley, with whom Dinsmore & Shohl LLP and Thomas W. Kelly were on brief, for appellants.\nRebecca Tedford Partington, Deputy Chief, Civil Division, with whom Patrick C. Lynch, Attorney General, was on\nbrief, for appellees.\nBefore BOUDIN, Chief Judge, COFFIN and BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judges, TORRUELLA, SELYA, LYNCH,\nLIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.\nJUDGMENT AND OPINIONS EN BANC\nThis appeal having been considered by the court en banc, the judgment of the district court is affirmed by an\nequally divided court. The opinions that follow reflect the views of the participating judges.\nSELYA, Circuit Judge (with whom BOUDIN, Chief Judge, and LYNCH and HOWARD, Circuit Judges, join).\nThe plaintiffs, all of whom were arrested in Rhode Island for non-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanors, were\nsubjected to unconstitutional searches of their persons incident to their detention at the Adult Correctional\nInstitutions (the ACI). These searches, conducted pursuant to a longstanding institutional policy, encompassed\nboth strip searches (i.e., visual inspections of the naked body) and visual body cavity searches (i.e., inspections\n[1]\nof the anal and genital areas).  After the courts struck down the strip search policy, the plaintiffs sued the State\nof Rhode Island and a number of prison officials for damages sustained as a result of the illegal intrusions.\nThe plaintiffs' suit invoked 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000). Because the State is immune from suits for damages under\nsection 1983, see Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); \nJohnson v. Rodriguez, 943 F.2d 104, 108-09 (1st Cir.1991), the controversy before us focuses on the liability vel\nnon of the individual defendants. After some preliminary skirmishing, the district court entered summary judgment\nin favor of those defendants on the basis of qualified immunity. A panel of this court reversed that ruling, but the\nfull court subsequently granted rehearing en banc and (as is customary in such instances) ordered the panel\nopinion withdrawn. The court now divides equally and thus affirms the district court's ruling. The judges who\nsubscribe to this opinion believe that affirmance is fully warranted: upon a broad review of the preexisting law and\nits application to the unusual situation at the ACI, we conclude that, when the underlying events occurred,\nprudent prison officials reasonably could have believed that Rhode Island's strip search policy was constitutional.\nI. BACKGROUND\n26 In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we rehearse the facts in the light *26 most sympathetic to the non-\nmoving parties (here, the plaintiffs), indulging all reasonable inferences in their favor. See, e.g., Suarez v. Pueblo\nInt'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2000). Here, however, that praxis has little bearing, for the facts upon which our\ndecision turns are largely undisputed.\n\nUnlike other states, Rhode Island has no regional or county detention facilities. It operates only a single, all-\npurpose penitentiary: the ACI. Centrally located in Cranston, Rhode Island, the ACI comprises seven separate\nmaximum security facilities. Two of those units 00 one for women and the other for men 00 receive all persons\n97 97\ncommitted to the custody of the Department of Corrections regardless of the nature of their offenses. At the times\nmaterial hereto, these intake facilities housed an array of prisoners ranging from newly sentenced felons to\nconvicts under protective custody to pretrial detainees to arrestees. All of these individuals, except for detainees\nheld in protective custody, were commingled while in various parts of the intake facilities. Detainees held in\nprotective custody used the same areas as other inmates but at different times.\nDuring the currency of this arrangement, Rhode Island maintained written policies that required all new entrants\ninto the ACI, including misdemeanant arrestees, to undergo strip and body cavity searches. In 1999, Craig\nRoberts ran afoul of this policy. Local police, having made a routine stop of a motor vehicle in which Roberts was\na passenger, learned that the Rhode Island Family Court had issued a body attachment 00 the functional\n97\nequivalent of a writ of arrest 00 addressed to him. Although Roberts protested that the body attachment had been\n97\nwithdrawn and produced what purported to be documentation to that effect, the police detained him.\nIn accordance with the customary procedure, the police transported Roberts to the ACI. Upon his admission, he\nwas twice subjected to strip and body cavity searches. These searches uncovered no drugs, weapons, or other\ncontraband. Shortly thereafter, a sheriff verified that the body attachment had been withdrawn. Roberts was\nreleased.\nRoberts was gone but not forgotten. He brought suit in the federal district court alleging that the strip searches\nhad violated his constitutional rights. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled that the\nstrip searches had offended Roberts's rights under the Fourth Amendment and enjoined the State from\ncontinuing to enforce the written policies then in effect. Roberts v. Rhode Island, 175 F.Supp.2d 176, 183\n(D.R.I.2000) (Roberts I). We affirmed. Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 113 (1st Cir. 2001) (Roberts II).\nRhode Island abandoned the proscribed policy from and after the date of the district court's decision (March 17,\n2000). Thereafter, eighteen plaintiffs 00 all of whom had been arrested for non-violent, non-drug-related\n97\nmisdemeanors and subjected to strip and body cavity searches prior to that date 00 brought a new action in the\n97\nfederal district court on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. In their class-action complaint, the\nplaintiffs alleged that the searches violated their constitutional rights and sought money damages.\nThe suit named as defendants the State and a galaxy of prison officials. Upon the defendants' motion, the district\ncourt dismissed Roberts's claim for damages based on the doctrine of res judicata. See, e.g., Allen v. McCurry,\n449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980) (stating that res judicata precludes a plaintiff from\n27 relitigating issues that were or could have *27 been raised in an earlier action against the same defendant\nprescinding from the same set of operative facts); Kale v. Combined Ins. Co., 924 F.2d 1161, 1165-66 (1st Cir.\n1991) (same). The court thereafter entered summary judgment against the remaining plaintiffs. The court\nreasoned that, prior to the decision in Roberts I, it was not clearly established that prison officials needed some\nparticularized suspicion before strip-searching misdemeanant arrestees who were about to be introduced into the\ngeneral population at a maximum security prison (and, therefore, that the defendants enjoyed the protection of\nqualified immunity). This appeal followed.\nII. ANALYSIS\nWe review orders granting summary judgment de novo. Plumley v. S. Container, Inc., 303 F.3d 364, 369 (1st\nCir.2002). Where, as here, a party's entitlement to summary judgment hinges on a claim of qualified immunity, we\nmust balance the need to vindicate constitutional rights against the need to insulate public officials from civil\nlitigation that might unduly inhibit the assiduous discharge of their duties. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S.\n635, 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). In balancing those competing needs, we employ a three-part\nalgorithm. Suboh v. Dist. Att'y's Office, 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.2002); Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth and Their\nFamilies, 274 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir.2001). The threshold question is whether the plaintiffs have established a\nconstitutional violation. Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 736, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002); Saucier v.\n\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). The second question deals with fair warning; it\nasks whether the law was clearly established at the time of the constitutional violation. Hope, 536 U.S. at 739-41,\n122 S.Ct. 2508; Anderson, 483 U.S. at 638-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034. The final question is whether a reasonable\nofficial, situated similarly to the defendant(s), would have understood that the conduct at issue contravened the\nclearly established law. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151.\nIn this case, the first part of the algorithm need not detain us. We acknowledge that strip searches are intrusive\nand degrading (and, therefore, should not be unreservedly available to law enforcement officers). The Roberts\ndecisions exemplify this thinking; they hold unequivocally that the ACI's policy of strip-searching persons arrested\nfor non-violent, non-drug-related misdemeanors, in the absence of particularized suspicion, violated the\nConstitution. See Roberts II, 239 F.3d at 113; Roberts I, 175 F.Supp.2d at 183. The questions on which this\nappeal turns, therefore, involve the second and third branches of the qualified immunity algorithm. We must\ndetermine whether the law was clearly established, prior to March 17, 2000, to the effect that prison officials need\nat least reasonable suspicion before subjecting misdemeanant arrestees to strip searches when introducing them\ninto the general population of a maximum security prison, and whether a reasonable prison official, situated\nsimilarly to the defendants, would have understood at that time that the policy in place at the ACI transgressed\nthe Constitution.\nAlthough the bases for these determinations often overlap, the instant plaintiffs cannot prevail unless we\ndetermine both questions favorably to them. Thus, we begin our analysis with an examination of whether the law\n28 can be said to have been \"clearly established\" at or before the critical time (March 17, 2000).[2] The degree *28\nto which the law was clearly established as of a particular date is a matter for the court to determine. Elder v.\nHolloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516, 114 S.Ct. 1019, 127 L.Ed.2d 344 (1994); Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232, 111\nS.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991); Diaz v. Martinez, 112 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1997).\nThe fundamental justification for the qualified immunity defense is that public officials performing discretionary\nfunctions should be free to act without fear of punitive litigation except when they fairly can anticipate that their\nconduct will give rise to liability for damages. Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 195, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 82 L.Ed.2d\n139 (1984). That anticipation depends, in large part, on the extent to which legal rules are clearly established. \nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The standard is an objective\none. Anderson, 483 U.S. at 639, 107 S.Ct. 3034; Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir.1999). It follows,\nthen, that an inquiry into the reasonableness of an officer's conduct must focus on the discernible contours of the\nlaw at the time of the alleged act or omission. Hatch, 274 F.3d at 22-23.\nTo attain the necessary perspective, an inquiring court must look back in time and conduct the juridical equivalent\nof an archeological dig. The court must canvass controlling authority in its own jurisdiction and, if none exists,\nattempt to fathom whether there is a consensus of persuasive authority elsewhere. See Wilson v. Layne, 526\nU.S. 603, 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999); Brady v. Dill, 187 F.3d 104, 116 (1st Cir.1999).\nThis exploration is not limited to cases directly on point. Because \"officials can still be on notice that their conduct\nviolates established law even in novel factual circumstances,\" Hope, 536 U.S. at 741, 122 S.Ct. 2508,\novercoming a qualified immunity defense does not require a plaintiff to show that either the particular conduct\ncomplained of or some materially indistinguishable conduct has previously been found unlawful. See United\nStates v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 268-71, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S.\n511, 535 n. 12, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). Still, the relevant legal rights and obligations must be\nparticularized enough that a reasonable official can be expected to extrapolate from them and conclude that a\ncertain course of conduct will violate the law. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201-02, 121 S.Ct. 2151. Consequently, if the\noperative legal principles are clearly established only at a level of generality so high that officials cannot fairly\nanticipate the legal consequences of specific actions, then the requisite notice is lacking. The bottom line is that\nthe qualified immunity defense prevails unless the unlawfulness of the challenged conduct is \"apparent.\" \nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034.\nAgainst this backdrop, we turn to the degree of clarity in the law relevant to this case. In conducting our appraisal,\nwe have endeavored to take into account all the decisional law, in and out of our own circuit, that was on the\n\nbooks at the time of the events in question. See Lanier, 520 U.S. at 268-69, 117 S.Ct. 1219; Hatch, 274 F.3d at\n23.\nAt the margins, the lines are easily plotted. On the one hand, courts long have viewed blanket strip searches as\nextreme intrusions upon Fourth Amendment rights. See, e.g., Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861,\n29 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983). On the other *29\nhand, security is a paramount concern in prison environments, and courts long have recognized that unpleasantly\nintrusive security measures, up to and including blanket strip searches, may be proper in such settings. See Bell,\n441 U.S. at 560-62, 99 S.Ct. 1861; Bonitz v. Fair, 804 F.2d 164, 170 (1st Cir.1986). The constitutional line that\nseparates permissible from impermissible uses of these methods is imprecise and context-specific. In the last\nanalysis, plotting that line requires a determination of what is reasonable under a given set of circumstances. \nBell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861; United States v. Chamorro, 687 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1982).\nThe difficulty, of course, is that this formulation, while legally respectable, does not go very far toward curing the\nimprecision with which decisionmakers must grapple. This is inevitable 00 or nearly so 00 given the subject matter.\n97 97\nIn the best of circumstances, \"[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise\ndefinition or mechanical application.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself has\nacknowledged, in a qualified immunity case, \"the difficulty of determining whether particular searches or seizures\ncomport with the Fourth Amendment.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 644, 107 S.Ct. 3034. And that difficulty is\ncompounded where, as here, the determination involves gauging whether a serious intrusion is reasonable in an\nincarcerative environment. See Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1997).\nWith these basic tenets in mind, we examine the two First Circuit decisions that bear most closely on this case.\nNeither comparison is very exact.\nWe start with Swain. There, police arrested a woman on suspicion of narcotics possession and temporarily held\nher in a jail cell by herself. Id. at 8. The officers, following institutional practice, strip-searched her. Id. at 4-5. We\ndeclared the strip search unconstitutional, holding that strip-searching an arrestee ordinarily requires at least\nreasonable suspicion that the person arrested is concealing contraband or weapons. Id. at 7. We pointed out\nthat, in Swain's case, there was no basis for any such suspicion. Id. at 8-9. Moreover, she was being held in\nvirtual isolation, so there was no risk that she would come in contact with other prisoners (and, thus, succeed in\nsmuggling contraband or weapons into the jail). Id. at 8.\nThe plaintiffs contend that Swain clearly established the law relevant to this case. It is, however, an\noversimplification to say that, because we applied the reasonable suspicion standard to strip searches in a\nparticular custodial context, the handwriting was on the wall that the same standard would apply to the ACI as\nwell. There are important differences between detaining an arrestee in virtual isolation and introducing an\narrestee into the general population of a maximum security prison.\nMaking this point brings us to our second case 00 a decision that the defendants insist has decretory significance\n97\nhere. That case is Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir.1983) (Breyer, J.). There, we upheld a blanket strip search\npolicy with regard to prison inmates. Id. at 888. We reasoned that because the searches involved the most\ndangerous of prisoners as they departed from, and entered into, a particularly sensitive area of a maximum\nsecurity prison, security concerns provided a compelling justification for the institution's policy. Id. at 887-88.\nAs in Arruda, the defendants in this case attempt to justify their blanket strip search policy as a necessary (or, at\nleast, reasonable) means of ensuring institutional security. They maintain that the unique nature of the ACI's\n30 intake facilities, in *30 which arrestees are intermingled with maximum security prisoners, raises concerns similar\nto those raised in Arruda and warrants the implementation of such a policy. This argument has considerable\nforce, for Arruda reasonably can be read as saying that the risk that any prisoner in a maximum security facility\nmight receive weapons or contraband from visitors, renegade guards, or others is enough to justify a blanket strip\nsearch policy. But despite its broad language, Arruda involved strip searches of convicted felons, not\nmisdemeanant arrestees 00 and that disparity cannot idly be brushed aside.\n97\nIn the end, we recognize that both Swain and Arruda offer valuable insights, but that neither is a very exact\nmatch. While Swain makes clear that strip searches ought not lightly to be indulged, the factual context of the\n\ncase presented rather minimal security concerns. And while Arruda makes clear that institutional security needs\nmay require intrusive measures in a maximum security setting, that case dealt not with persons arrested for\nrelatively innocuous misdemeanors, but, rather, with hardened criminals. So long as the facts in these cases are\ndistinguishable in a fair way from the facts at hand 00 and we believe that they are 00 then neither of them can be\n97 97\nsaid to have clearly established the law for purposes of a qualified immunity determination in the instant case. \nSee Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202-03, 121 S.Ct. 2151.\nWe recognized much the same point in Roberts II, 239 F.3d at 111 (noting that \"[t]he institutional security\nconcerns in play here fall somewhere between those exhibited in Swain, which were insufficient to support a\nsearch, and those in Arruda and Bell, which made broad-based searches without individual suspicion\nreasonable\"). To be sure, we ultimately placed the case \"on the Swain side of the constitutional line.\" Id. But our\nacknowledgment that the ACI's strip search policy fell into the gray area between Swain and Arruda carries more\nweight for present purposes than our actual holding. A holding on the merits is not dispositive on the issue of\nqualified immunity. See Cookish v. Powell, 945 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir.1991); Morales v. Ramirez, 906 F.2d 784,\n787 (1st Cir.1990). The law does not expect a public official, faced with the need to make an objectively\nreasonable real-world judgment, to anticipate precisely the legal conclusions that will be reached by a panel of\nfederal appellate judges after briefing, arguments, and full-fledged review. See Wilson, 526 U.S. at 617, 119 S.Ct.\n1692.\nThe plaintiffs, ably represented, go beyond Swain and Arruda in an effort to convince us that reasonable\ncorrectional officials should have realized the unconstitutionality of the ACI's strip search policy prior to March 17,\n2000. They point to a line of cases stating that blanket strip searches of misdemeanant arrestees, conducted\nwithout particularized suspicion, are unconstitutional. See, e.g., Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th\nCir.1989); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 804 (2d Cir. 1986); Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th\nCir.1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 618-19 (9th Cir. 1984); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391, 394-95 (10th\nCir.1984). These cases come as no surprise; we cited many of them in Roberts II, 239 F.3d at 111-13. For\nqualified immunity purposes, however, there are important distinctions between these cases and the case at\nhand.\nIn the first place, all the cases upon which the plaintiffs rely deal with detentions in local jails and police stations.\nIn contrast, the case before us involves detentions in a maximum security prison. This distinction is quite\n31 meaningful: the case law emphasizes that prison regulations *31 may constitutionally impinge upon fundamental\nrights so long as such regulations are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. See, e.g., Overton v.\nBazzetta, ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 2162, 2167, 156 L.Ed.2d 162 (2003); Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 87, 107\nS.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). Within the walls of a maximum security prison, the need to preserve internal\nsecurity is compelling. Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526-27, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); Wood v.\nClemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1996). We think it follows that Rhode Island correctional officials reasonably\ncould have regarded the stark differences between local lockups and maximum security prisons as pivotal in\ndeciding whether a particular security-oriented policy was necessary. We explain briefly.\nThe population of a maximum security prison tends to be much more volatile and much less transient than that of\na county jail. See Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 65 (2d Cir.2001). Thus, it is fairly debatable whether inmates in\nsuch a facility may be likely to arrange for an outsider to bring them weapons or other contraband by being\narrested for a minor offense. Compare, e.g., Watt v. City of Richardson Police Dep't, 849 F.2d 195, 198 (5th\nCir.1988) (declaring that \"a suspect jailed even temporarily on a minor offense could have the opportunity, if not\nsearched, to smuggle in weapons or contraband,\" so that strip-searching such suspects \"is not an irrational\nattempt to foster ... security\"), with, e.g., Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 69 (2d Cir.1988) (declaring that \"the risk of\na misdemeanor arrestee's introducing contraband into the general jail population simply d[oes] not warrant a strip\nsearch of all arrestees\"). The debatable nature of the question argues in favor of qualified immunity. See Goyco\nde Maldonado v. Rivera, 849 F.2d 683, 688 (1st Cir.1988) (stating that an official \"need show no more than that\n[the question is close] to prevail on his qualified immunity defense\"); Vazquez Rios v. Hernandez Colon, 819 F.2d\n319, 328 (1st Cir.1987) (noting that \"the closeness of the call suggests that [the law] could not have been `clearly\nestablished'\").\n\nThe cases upon which the plaintiffs rely are distinguishable in yet another salient respect. Those cases do not\ngainsay that the security concerns arising out of the intermingling of inmates are a significant counterweight in the\nbalance that must be struck between personal rights and practical necessities. Read for all they are worth, the\nplaintiffs' cases at most deny that this counterweight is a sufficient justification in particular circumstances\n(invariably, circumstances attending an arrestee's detention at facilities such as jails and police stations). See,\ne.g., Masters, 872 F.2d at 1255; Hill, 735 F.2d at 394; Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981).\nGiven the unique features of the ACI's intake facilities, the composition of the inmate population, and the fact that\nthe misdemeanant arrestees generally were not searched prior to their arrival at the ACI, it was hardly\nunreasonable for Rhode Island correctional officials to calibrate the balance differently.\nIn point of fact, a separate line of cases has emphasized the need to defer to the judgment of correctional officials\nin addressing institutional security needs. See, e.g., Overton, 123 S.Ct. at 2167; Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S.\n396, 404-05, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974); Hay v. Waldron, 834 F.2d 481, 486 (5th Cir.1987); see also \nBell, 441 U.S. at 547-48, 99 S.Ct. 1861. After all, institutional security is \"perhaps the most legitimate of all\npenological goals.\" Overton, 123 S.Ct. at 2168; accord Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 823, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 41\nL.Ed.2d 495 (1974).\n32 *32 In an opinion that is closer to this case than any other, the Second Circuit upheld a policy in which a prison\nfacility conducted random strip searches of all inmates, including pretrial detainees. See Covino v. Patrissi, 967\nF.2d 73, 80 (2d Cir.1992). Adverting, among other things, to the fact that the plaintiff (a pretrial detainee)\ncommingled with sentenced inmates who had histories of violence and substance abuse, the court concluded\n[3]\nthat the prison's policy was a reasonable response to the officials' concerns. Id. at 78-79.\nThe short of the matter is that, throughout the last quarter of the twentieth century, courts had pursued two\ndivergent lines of precedent. This case, as we said in Roberts II, 239 F.3d at 111, fell along neither axis, but,\nrather, into the tenebrious middle. We are mindful that there is a distinction for qualified immunity purposes\nbetween an unconstitutional but objectively reasonable act and a blatantly unconstitutional act. Saucier, 533 U.S.\nat 206, 121 S.Ct. 2151; Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034. Here, the lack of any direct precedent and\nthe undulating contours of the law during the relevant period combine to persuade us that the constitutional\nviolation was not obvious; the defendants reasonably could have thought, prior to Roberts I, that there was room\nin the law for the ACI's strip search policy.\nThe plaintiffs pose one last challenge to the assertion of a qualified immunity defense. They note that, rather than\nstrip-searching all arrestees, officials at the ACI could have employed less extreme measures such as conducting\npat-down searches or segregating misdemeanant arrestees from the rest of the prison population. In support of\nthis view, they point to our conclusion that the search policy was almost entirely unnecessary to control the entry\nof contraband into the ACI. See Roberts II, 239 F.3d at 112. But this too involves a judgment call. In the relevant\ntime frame, some cases indicated that blanket strip searches are never constitutional when the security needs\nthey address could be met by less intrusive means. E.g., Giles, 746 F.2d at 617; Sostre v. Preiser, 519 F.2d 763,\n764 (2d Cir. 1975). Other cases suggested that the availability of less intrusive means is irrelevant to the analysis\nso long as officials reasonably could have concluded that such measures were more burdensome and less\nefficacious than blanket strip searches. See, e.g., Bell, 441 U.S. at 559 n. 40, 99 S.Ct. 1861; Hay, 834 F.2d at 485\n; Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 566 (1st Cir. 1985); see also Turner, 482 U.S. at 90-91, 107 S.Ct. 2254\n(emphasizing that \"prison officials do not have to set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative\n[4]\nmethod of accommodating the claimant's constitutional complaint\").  Given this split in authority, we find that the\nlaw on this matter was also not clearly established. Therefore, the defendants reasonably could have believed\n(until the federal court declared Rhode Island's blanket strip search policy unconstitutional) that they were under\nno legal obligation to resort to alternative measures.\nOur brethren suggest that we require an exact match with the facts of previously decided cases before we will\n33 deny a defendant *33 the shield of qualified immunity. That is simply not so. What is so is that \"[t]he meaning of\nreasonableness [of a search] for Fourth Amendment purposes is highly situational\" and requires \"a balancing of\nthe need to search against the invasion which the search entails.\" Wood, 89 F.3d at 928 (citations and internal\nquotation marks omitted). The cases that our brethren cite in an effort to show that reasonable suspicion was\n\nclearly established as a condition precedent to a strip search of a person in custody are no more on point than\nthe cases, cited above, that authorize various exceptions to that generality. Given this cacophony of voices, a\nreasonable prison official, faced with the novel factual situation that confronted those who were in charge of the\nACI, had no way of knowing which voice should guide him in drawing the Fourth Amendment balance. It is the\nabsence of clear guidance, not the absence of a perfect precedential match, that makes qualified immunity\nappropriate here.\nIn this regard, our colleagues reprove us for attributing significant weight both to the dangers inherent in\ncommingling violent felons with misdemeanant arrestees and to distinctions between jails and maximum security\nprisons. We plead guilty to that charge. But we attach weight to those factors because of our respect for those\nwho must maintain institutional security in the most difficult of settings. Correctional officials charged with the\noperation of maximum security prisons have an unenviable task 00 and courts should be reluctant casually to\n97\nimpose on them personal liability for damages in the absence of \"standards sufficiently clear and simple to be\napplied with a fair prospect of surviving judicial second-guessing months and years [later].\" Atwater v. City of\nLago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 349, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001).\nTo sum up, the district court mortally wounded the ACI's blanket strip search policy in Roberts I, and we\nadministered the last rites in Roberts II. That policy is now dead and buried. While we have found the defendants'\nresolution of the Fourth Amendment balance incorrect, see Roberts II, 239 F.3d at 112-13, we conclude that,\ngiven the mixed signals sent by the case law, the difficulties inherent in Fourth Amendment balancing in the\nprison context, the special features of the ACI, and the wide berth called for by the qualified immunity doctrine,\nthe defendants, prior to March 17, 2000, reasonably could have believed the ACI's policy to be both justified and\nconstitutional. Put another way, the defendants did not have fair warning, prior to March 17, 2000, that their\nconduct was unlawful. If judges can span the spectrum on this sort of constitutional question, it would certainly be\nunfair to hold the defendants liable for doing nothing more blameworthy than guessing incorrectly about how the\ncourts ultimately would resolve the issue. See Wilson, 526 U.S. at 618, 119 S.Ct. 1692.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nWe need go no further. This is a close case, but we do not require public officials to foretell the course of\nconstitutional law with absolute accuracy in order to obtain the balm of qualified immunity. Id. at 617, 119 S.Ct.\n1692. To the contrary, the doctrine of qualified immunity is designed to protect \"all but the plainly incompetent or\nthose who knowingly violate the law.\" Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986)\n. Concluding, as we do, that the law as it existed when the events at issue occurred did not clearly establish that\nthe ACI's policy authorizing blanket strip and body cavity searches violated the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment\n34 rights, we would uphold the entry of summary judgment in the defendants' *34 favor on the basis of qualified\nimmunity.\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, with whom COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge, TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, and\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge, join.\nThe defendants in this case were granted qualified immunity because, according to the district court, the law did\nnot \"clearly establish\" that reasonable suspicion was needed to strip search people arrested for non-violent, non-\ndrug related minor offenses. Our four respected colleagues agree with this analysis. We do not. The opinion of\nour colleagues is wrong on the law, the logic that they adopt is at odds with recent Supreme Court precedent\nregarding qualified immunity, and we believe their reasoning will put constitutional rights at risk.\nIt is important to keep in mind what we are dealing with in this case. The strip searches conducted here are\n\"perhaps `the greatest personal indignity' searching officials can visit upon an individual.\" Blackburn v. Snow, 771\nF.2d 556, 564 (1st Cir. 1985) (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 594, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)).\nAccording to Rhode Island's written policies, these searches included a \"visual examination of [the] groin and\nrectum.\" Male arrestees were required to \"lift their penises and testicles on the officer's command to provide a\nclear view of the groin area.\" Both male and female arrestees were required \"to bend over and spread the rectum\nto provide a clear view of the area.\" Moreover, these searches were conducted against harmless individuals. All\nof the plaintiffs in this case were arrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses. By way of example,\n\none of the plaintiffs, George Barber, loaned his car to his son in 1993 and the son received a traffic ticket that was\nnever paid. Six years later, Barber was arrested because of the unpaid ticket, held at the Adult Correctional\nInstitutions (\"the ACI\") overnight and strip searched twice. Another plaintiff, Stephanie Clark, called police for\nassistance after an auto accident and was arrested because a computer check showed an outstanding arrest\nwarrant for her failure to appear at a probation review. Clark had already finished her probation and the warrant\nwas issued in error. She was taken to the ACI and strip searched twice.\nWith these facts in mind, we turn to the legal issues in this case. We begin with whether it was the \"clearly\nestablished\" law in this circuit, as of March 17, 2000, that prison officials needed reasonable suspicion to strip\n[5]\nsearch non-violent, non-drug related minor offense arrestees.  \"One tried and true way of determining whether\n[a] right was clearly established ... is to ask whether existing case law gave the defendants fair warning that their\nconduct violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\" Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office of the Suffolk Dist., 298 F.3d\n35 81, 93 (1st Cir.2002). Our colleagues describe this inquiry as an archeological dig, yet focus on *35 only the top\nand bottom layers of the excavation. See Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997); Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d\n886 (1st Cir.1983). Our colleagues choose to ignore the cases that lie in the layers in between, thereby omitting\nconsideration of relevant precedent. A proper qualified immunity analysis requires a court to look \"at all available\ncase law.\" Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth and Their Families, 274 F.3d 12, 23 (1st Cir. 2001). We will therefore\nbriefly trace the development of this circuit's reasonable suspicion standard as it applies to strip searches.\nThe place to start is the Supreme Court's decision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447\n(1979). In that case, the Court upheld a strip and visual body cavity search of pretrial detainees who had contact\nwith prison visitors. Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861. In doing so, the Court conducted an analysis that balanced the\nneed for the searches against the invasion of personal rights. Id. Although the Court said that the practice of strip\nsearching individuals \"instinctively gives us the most pause,\" it found the searches constitutional because of the\nsecurity needs of the prison, i.e., the realistic possibility that contraband could pass from visitor to detainee. Id. at\n558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. But the Court was clear to delineate the scope of its holding:\n[W]e deal here with the question whether visual body-cavity inspections ... can ever be conducted\non less than probable cause. Balancing the significant and legitimate security interests of the\ninstitution against the privacy interests of the inmates, we conclude that they can.\nId. at 560 (emphasis in original). In other words, Bell established the ceiling; it made clear that prison officials did\nnot necessarily need probable cause to strip search pretrial detainees. But Bell left the floor undefined. Still\nunanswered was the question of whether prison officials needed any level of particularized suspicion that\ndetainees were carrying contraband or weapons or in a position to receive them from others before conducting\nstrip searches.\nOur early cases applying Bell to the prison environment dealt largely with situations involving prison visitors. In\none of our first prison visitor cases, Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556 (1st Cir.1985), we held that:\n[T]he Constitution requires a more particularized level of suspicion to justify the humiliating and\nintrusive searches conducted here. While we need not define here precisely what level of\nindividualized suspicion is required ... a rule unabashedly requiring none cannot be reconciled with\nthe Fourth Amendment.\nId. at 567; see also Cochrane v. Quattrocchi, 949 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1991). It is also noteworthy that we\nsurveyed the legal landscape as it existed at the time and grouped arrestees into the category of strip search\nscenarios in which particularized suspicion was necessary. See Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 565. This grouping was\nmerely a foreshadowing of things to come.\nIn Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922 (1st Cir.1996), we clarified that the level of particularized suspicion required\nbefore subjecting prison visitors to strip searches was \"reasonable suspicion.\" Id. at 929. We said that \"a strip\nsearch cannot be justified absent some quantum of individualized suspicion. In determining the level of\nindividualized suspicion ... courts have converged upon one common benchmark: the standard of `reasonable\nsuspicion.'\" Id. at 928 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).\n\nOur cases addressing the reasonable suspicion standard in the context of strip and visual body cavity searches\n36 were not *36 limited to prison visitors. We required reasonable suspicion for strip searches at border crossings. \nSee United States v. Uricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir.1991). And most significantly for this case,\nwe held in Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997), that there must be reasonable suspicion to conduct strip\nsearches of arrestees. Id. at 7.\nIn Swain, we examined our prior cases dealing with prison visitors and border searches, as well as relevant\ncases from other circuits. We concluded that \"it is clear that at least the reasonable suspicion standard governs\nstrip and visual body cavity searches in the arrestee context as well.\" Id. This ruling was consistent with cases\n[6]\nfrom numerous other circuits.\nOur brethren mischaracterize the holding in Swain. They paraphrase Swain as holding that reasonable suspicion\nis \"ordinarily\" required for arrestees and that strip searches \"ought not lightly to be indulged.\" We respectfully\ndisagree with our colleagues' description of Swain's holding. Swain's holding is clear and unqualified. Swain does\nnot say that reasonable suspicion is only sometimes required. Rather than paraphrase the words of Swain, we\nshall quote its holding directly: \"A strip and visual body cavity search of an arrestee must be justified, at the least,\nby a reasonable suspicion.\" 117 F.3d at 5. It is hard to imagine a more clear statement of the law.\nOur colleagues fail to mention that Swain contained another holding that is especially relevant to this case. When\nanalyzing the issue of qualified immunity we stated:\nFurthermore, while some courts have suggested that a higher standard may be necessary to\njustify a strip search and visual body cavity inspection, it was clearly established at the time of the\nsearch [May 18, 1993] that the Fourth Amendment requires at least a reasonable suspicion to\nconduct these types of searches.\n[7]\nId. (emphasis in original). This ruling too was in accord with decisions by other circuits.\n37 *37 In short, Swain states unequivocally that reasonable suspicion is required to strip search arrestees and that\nthis requirement was clearly established as early as 1993, well before the dates in question here. These rulings\nwere in conformity with circuits across the country.\nDespite this overwhelming precedent, our colleagues claim that Swain's holdings could not have given the\ndefendants fair warning that the reasonable suspicion standard would apply to them. They say that Swain\ninvolved an arrestee who was held alone in a single cell, whereas the plaintiffs in this case were commingled with\nother prisoners. Admittedly, our precedent does not speak to commingling specifically. But that fact does not\nmean that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. See Hatch, 274 F.3d at 23 (although \"[o]ur own\nprecedents are ... inconclusive,\" the law was clearly established by \"an emerging body of decisional law outside\nour own circuit\"). Commingling may not always pose a security risk. It is not commingling, per se, that presents a\nsecurity problem; it is commingling that involves a risk of illegal traffic among the commingled inmates.\nAs early as Blackburn, we rejected the argument that \"the security needs of a prison can, standing alone,\nproperly justify the `complete withdrawal' of Fourth Amendment rights from all who enter [a prison].\" 771 F.2d at\n563 (emphasis in original); see also Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013 (\"An indiscriminate strip search policy routinely\napplied to detainees ... cannot be constitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending\nto security considerations.\").\n[8]\nCases from other circuits are more explicit in rejecting the commingling argument advanced by the defendants.\nMost notable is the Sixth Circuit's holding in Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.1989):\n[T]he fact of intermingling [with other prison inmates] alone has never been found to justify such a\nsearch without consideration of the nature of the offense and the question of whether there is any\nreasonable basis for concern that the particular detainee will attempt to introduce weapons or\nother contraband into the institution.\n\nId. at 1254. In short, the cases from other circuits, when read in conjunction with our own precedent, would not\npermit a reasonable prison official to conclude that minor offense arrestees could be strip searched without\nreasonable suspicion simply because the prison officials decide to mix the arrestees with other prisoners.\nOur colleagues say that Swain could not have provided fair warning for another reason. According to our\nbrethren, Swain, as well as the cases from other circuits upon which it relied, involved local jails rather than\n38 prisons, like the ACI. The distinction between jails and maximum security prisons is a crucial leg upon which *38\nour colleagues' opinion rests. It is here that their incomplete archeological excavation which we mentioned earlier\nbecomes important. The cases that our colleagues ignored involved the early development of our reasonable\nsuspicion standard as it applied to strip searches of prison visitors. At issue in those cases were both jails and\nprisons. See Wood, 89 F.3d at 925 (prison); Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 559 (county jail).\nEven more relevant is the fact that one of those cases dealt with the ACI. See Cochrane, 949 F.2d at 12. In \nCochrane, we vacated a judgment granting directed verdicts for ACI officials defending the strip search of an\ninmate's daughter. We said that:\n[A]bsent any evidence that appellant ever violated a prison visitation rule, or even supplied\nCochrane with drugs, a reasonable juror could have concluded that Cochrane's contraband drugs\nwere supplied by prison officials or other inmates. Thus, the jury could have found that the strip\nsearch of appellant was unreasonable because it was based on no \"individualized suspicion.\"\nId. at 13 (emphasis in original). Our colleagues maintain that the defendants were justified in believing that no\nreasonable suspicion was required in this case in part because the defendants \"must maintain institutional\nsecurity in the most difficult of settings.\" Yet the same setting and security considerations were not enough to\ndefeat the requirement for individualized suspicion in Cochrane. We do not understand on what legal basis our\ncolleagues can now say that those same security needs made the defendants' unconstitutional strip searches\nreasonable. Certainly the defendants had fair warning that the reasonable suspicion standard would be applied to\nthem because, in fact, they had already been held to that standard in the past.\nOf course, one difference between Cochrane and the present case is that Cochrane involved prison visitors, not\nminor offense arrestees. But this fact does not help the defendants; if anything, it further highlights why the\ndefendants had fair warning that their strip search policies were unreasonable.\nThe Supreme Court has explained that prison visitors \"invite a host of security problems\" because they can pass\nweapons and contraband \"to an inmate unnoticed by even the most vigilant observers.\" Block v. Rutherford, 468\nU.S. 576, 586, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984). It is well recognized, however, that individuals arrested for\nnon-violent, non-drug related minor offenses do not present the same security risk as prison visitors. See Roberts\nII, 239 F.3d at 111; Giles, 746 F.2d at 617. This is because arrests, unlike visits, are not planned events. They are\nrandom and do not afford an arrestee the opportunity to hatch a scheme to smuggle contraband into a prison. As\nthe Second Circuit has explained:\nIt is far less obvious that misdemeanor arrestees frequently or even occasionally hide contraband\nin their bodily orifices. Unlike persons already in jail who receive contact visits, arrestees do not\nordinarily have notice that they are about to be arrested and thus an opportunity to hide\nsomething. For the exceptions 00 for example, a person who is allowed to visit the bathroom\n97\nunescorted before an arrest 00 reasonable suspicion may well exist.\n97\nShain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2001). Our brethren overlook the important fact that the Court in Bell\nauthorized strip searches of detainees only after the detainees had come into contact with prison visitors. See\n39 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. *39 1861. The present case involves people brought to the ACI because they were\narrested, sometimes mistakenly as the record reveals, for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses. They did\nnot come into contact with prison visitors.\nOur colleagues concoct a hypothetical situation in which an inmate arranges for an outsider to bring weapons or\ncontraband inside the prison by staging an incident that would lead to the outsider being arrested for a minor\noffense. With due respect, this is chimerical. The only case our colleagues have exhumed to support their\n\nscenario is Watt v. City of Richardson Police Dep't, 849 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1988). They claim Watt stands for the\nidea that \"a suspect jailed even temporarily on a minor offense could have the opportunity, if not searched, to\nsmuggle weapons or contraband.\" Id. at 198. The very next sentence from Watt, however, shows that the quote\nupon which they rely is applicable only to those arrestees charged with weapons, shoplifting or drug offenses or\nthose with a history of such offenses. See id. (\"Limiting the searches generally to those offenders charged with or\nhaving a criminal history of narcotics, shoplifting or weapons charges is not an irrational attempt to foster jail\nsecurity....\"). Watt does not support our colleagues' theory that non-violent, non-drug related minor offense\narrestees will conduct coordinated smuggling schemes to infiltrate prisons with contraband and weapons.\nPerhaps more importantly, there is no evidence in the record to support our colleagues' hypothetical. In fact, the\nrecord undermines it. At no time has the ACI ever found weapons or contraband in an arrestee's rectum or genital\narea. Roberts II, 239 F.3d at 112 n. 6. Only on one occasion has the ACI found contraband in the body cavity of a\nminor offense arrestee. Id. In that instance, the arrestee was hiding a bag of drugs in his mouth. Id. All the other\ncontraband that the ACI has found on minor offense arrestees has been discovered in their clothing. It is obvious\nthat the intrusive and degrading searches that the ACI chose to institute were not required to find this contraband.\nId.\nNo historical analysis of our strip search cases would be complete without a close examination of our holding in \nArruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir.1983). Our colleagues say that Arruda is a case with \"considerable force\"\nbecause it \"reasonably can be read as saying that the risk that any prisoner in a maximum security facility might\nreceive weapons or contraband from visitors, renegade guards, or others is enough to justify a blanket strip\nsearch policy.\" (emphasis added). Characterized in this manner, Arruda forms another critical leg upon which our\ncolleagues' opinion stands. Their expansive reading of Arruda is unwarranted. Arruda is a totally different case\nthan what we face here. It is so different that no reasonable official could have read Arruda to authorize\nsuspicionless strip searches of minor offense arrestees. This is true for three reasons.\nFirst, Arruda was decided twenty years ago and, as we have already discussed, our cases since Arruda have\nmade clear that reasonable suspicion is required to strip search arrestees. See Swain, 117 F.3d at 7.\nSecond, Arruda was a case involving \"particularly dangerous prisoners.\" 710 F.2d at 887. These prisoners were\nconvicted felons assigned to a special cell block, which we described as a \"`prison within a prison,' designed to\nhold the most dangerous inmates.\" Id. The plaintiff himself was assigned to this special cell block for assaulting\n40 another prisoner. Id. In addition, the plaintiff testified that, while a prisoner, he possessed drugs and a weapon. \n*40Id.\nat 888. It is beyond comprehension how the defendants can equate extraordinarily violent convicted felons with\npeople who have been arrested for minor offenses.\nThird, and most pertinently, what we identified in Arruda as the \"closest question,\" id., most analogous to the\ninstant case, was whether prisoners who were convicted felons needed to be searched en route from cell to\nlibrary or infirmary, even though accompanied by a guard. Like the misdemeanor arrestees here, there would\nseem to be no basis for any suspicion that such inmates would possess contraband. The record in Arruda,\nhowever, revealed a number of instances when guards were found to be involved in smuggling drugs to\nprisoners. This caused us to hold, \"[G]iven the problem of prison employee involvement with contraband, the\ndistrict court's conclusion is not unreasonable.\" Id.; but see id. at 891, 890 (Maletz, J., dissenting in part) (\"When\none of the primary justifications for strip searches in these circumstances rests on the institution's inability to\ncontrol its own staff the scales tip decidedly in favor of the inmate.... I am constrained to conclude that routine\nvisual strip searches before and after visits to the prison library and prison hospital are unreasonable, absent\nsome level of cause.\").\nTwenty years have passed since we decided Arruda and the case law barring suspicionless strip searches of\nminor offense arrestees has proliferated. And Swain, with its clear recognition that a strip search requires\nreasonable suspicion, has been on the books of this circuit since 1997. The record in this case does not reveal a\nprison employee drug smuggling problem. There remains only the speculative risk that a non-violent, non-drug\nrelated misdemeanant, randomly arrested, might fortuitously be a bearer of contraband. That is not enough, in\nour view, to permit the defendants to escape liability for their unconstitutional acts.\n\nThe only similarity between Arruda and the present case is that the correctional facilities in both cases are\nmaximum security prisons. This is the vital similarity upon which the defendants' argument relies. Despite the key\ndifferences I have described above, our colleagues are persuaded by this single similarity. Our colleagues say\nthat prison officials cannot be expected to anticipate precisely the legal conclusions that we judges will make after\nfull briefing and argument. We agree with that statement as a general matter. But that is not to say that prison\nofficials have no responsibility to analyze the law. All of the individual defendants here are high level prison\n[9]\nofficials.  They are not entry-level prison guards who have no access to legal advice and have superiors who\nhave failed to supply any training on constitutional law whatsoever. The defendants in this case are the superiors\nand should be held to the standard of a \"reasonably competent public official [who] should know the law\ngoverning his conduct.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 819, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The\nqualified immunity analysis is based on an objective standard. See Suboh, 298 F.3d at 95. This necessarily\nimplies some informed and professional analysis. Merely to take refuge in the concept that the ACI is a maximum\nsecurity prison, without identifying any realistic distinction between the situation in Arruda and the situation that\n41 the defendants were confronted with at the ACI, falls far short of *41 any credible analysis of the state of the law\nboth within and outside this circuit.\nWe close our review of the relevant legal history regarding strip searches with an important observation. Our\ncolleagues do not cite to a single case which permits suspicionless strip searches of non-violent, non-drug\nrelated minor offense arrestees. It is quite amazing that they can claim the law is ambiguous but fail to provide a\nsingle case that directly supports their position. The only case our colleagues offer is Covino v. Patrissi, 967 F.2d\n73 (2d Cir.1992). But that case, as our colleagues readily admit, is not on point. The plaintiff in Covino was not\narrested for non-violent, non-drug related minor offenses like the plaintiffs in this case. He was arrested for\nkidnaping a child under the age of sixteen and was ultimately sentenced to 20 to 35 years in prison. Id. at 75 n. 1.\nIn addition, the prison superintendent in Covino testified that \"occasionally contraband and drugs were found\nsecreted in an inmate's rectum.\" Id. at 79. As we have already explained, the evidence in this case is to the\ncontrary.\nWithout direct legal support, our brethren are forced to argue that generalized statements from certain cases\nmade the law so ambiguous that the defendants could not have had fair warning. Our colleagues argue, for\nexample, that there exists \"a separate line of cases [that] has emphasized the need to defer to the judgment of\ncorrectional officials in addressing institutional security needs.\" If these types of sweeping statements are enough\nto shield prison officials from liability for their illegal actions, then there is the significant risk that qualified\nimmunity will always attach.\nIt is this concern that brings us to our final point. Up to now, we have argued that our colleagues analysis of our\nlegal history is incomplete and untenable. This is not the only flaw in their opinion. We are deeply troubled by the\nweight our colleagues give to our statement in Roberts II that institutional security concerns in this case \"fall\nsomewhere between\" those exhibited in Swain and Arruda.239 F.3d at 111. Our colleagues describe this\nstatement as an acknowledgment that the ACI's strip search policy fell into a \"gray area\" of the law. We\nrespectfully disagree. The Roberts II statement merely recognizes the obvious: that the facts of the present case\nfall somewhere between those of Swain and Arruda. Such an observation is not surprising. Indeed, most cases\nwill fall somewhere between Swain and Arruda because those two cases represent the opposite ends of the\nspectrum. Swain was a case involving an arrestee who was placed in a cell in a local police station. In contrast, \nArruda involved extraordinarily violent convicted felons who were confined to a special security section of a\nmaximum security prison. What our colleagues have done is to construe a dictum probably intended to soften\ncriticism of the prison officials into a sweeping carte blanche, protecting officials for a wide swath of conduct\nelsewhere long since forbidden.\nPlacing so much weight on the Roberts II statement runs the risk of creating an impenetrable defense for\ngovernment officials. Our colleagues' reliance on the Roberts II statement implies that qualified immunity will only\nbe denied in this circuit when the facts of the case at bar are the same as those in previously decided cases. This\nrisk is compounded by our colleagues' statement that Swain could not give the defendants fair warning because\nit is not \"a very exact match\" to the facts of this case.\n\nSuch reasoning flouts the Supreme Court's holding in Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d\n42 666 (2002). In Hope, the Court admonished the Eleventh Circuit for finding the law *42 clearly established only\nwhen the facts of previous cases were \"fundamentally similar\" to the present case. Id. at 739, 122 S.Ct. 2508.\nThe Court said that such an approach was a \"rigid gloss on the qualified immunity standard ... [that] is not\nconsistent with our cases.\" Id. The Court explained that \"officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates\nestablished law even in novel factual circumstances,\" and that \"[a]lthough earlier cases involving `fundamentally\nsimilar' facts can provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established, they are\nnot necessary to such a finding. The same is true of cases with `materially similar' facts.\" Id. at 741, 122 S.Ct.\n2508.\nOur colleagues respond by saying that \"[i]t is the absence of clear guidance, not the absence of a perfect\nprecedential match, that makes qualified immunity appropriate here.\" In short, they reject Swain as giving \"clear\nguidance\" because of factual differences, while claiming allegiance to Hope's ruling that \"fundamentally similar\"\nfacts are not necessary. This seems to us an attempt to have it both ways.\nOur colleagues may well be correct that the strip search policy at issue in this case, and others like it, are \"dead\nand buried.\" But their qualified immunity analysis will live on; it will undoubtedly be used in future cases involving\nother important constitutional rights. The qualified immunity defense is \"an attempt to balance competing values:\nnot only the importance of a damages remedy to protect the rights of citizens ... but also `the need to protect\nofficials who are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in encouraging the vigorous\nexercise of official authority.'\" Harlow, 457 U.S. at 807, 102 S.Ct. 2727 (quoting Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478,\n504-06, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978)). By finding ambiguity in our cases where there is none, and by\nimplying that previous cases must be \"a very exact match\" before they can give fair warning for purposes of the\nqualified immunity analysis, our brethren have tipped the balance away from the Constitution. They have gone far\ntoward granting absolute immunity under the cloak of qualified immunity. We believe that this court is obliged not\nonly to give due deference to the judgment of government officials but to insist that the constitutional rights of\nindividuals be vigilantly protected.\nIf the bar to a remedy is set too high, then constitutional rights are in jeopardy. Government officials will have less\nincentive to change their illegal policies on their own accord because the deterrent effect of damages is lacking.\nAggrieved individuals will have less incentive to challenge those policies because monetary compensation for\ntheir harms is unavailable. In the end, unconstitutional government action is more likely to go unchanged. That is\nour ultimate concern.\n[1] For ease in reference, we sometimes use the shorthand term \"strip search\" to describe both practices.\n[2] Because we answer this question in the negative, see text infra, we need not address the final prong of the\nqualified immunity algorithm.\n[3] Of course, the plaintiff there had been arrested for an offense more serious than those attributed to the\nplaintiffs in this case. Covino, 967 F.2d at 75 n. 1. The Second Circuit did not base its decision on this distinction,\nhowever, nor did it limit its holding to blanket strip searches of \"major\" offenders.\n[4] Indeed, the Bell Court suggested that the lack of a history of discovered contraband on inmates' bodies might\nattest to the effectiveness of this search modality as a deterrent. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861.\n[5] We note at the outset that the reasonable suspicion standard is not particularly demanding. Reasonable\nsuspicion is \"something stronger than a mere hunch, but something weaker than probable cause.\" Wood v.\nClemons, 89 F.3d 922, 929 (1st Cir.1996) (citation and quotation marks omitted). It is a standard that can be\nsatisfied by a wide range of circumstances, including \"the crime charged, the particular characteristics of the\narrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\" Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 802 (2d Cir.1986); see also \nRoberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 113 (1st Cir.2001) (Roberts II) (stating that reasonable suspicion can be\nbased on \"observations of a particular inmate during a less invasive pat-down frisk and clothing search, or based\non contraband found during that search\").\n\n[6]See Justice v.
