That policy required that each inmate be strip searched by a same sex jail staff member before being placed in a cell or detention room.  </p><p>Plaintiff alleged that  following her arrest and booking at the Jail, she was ordered to disrobe, to turn and face the wall, and to squat and cough in the presence of a female officer.  The following morning prior to her release, a male nurse assistant at the Jail  took a blood sample, ordered to pull down her pants and searched her pubic region for lice.   Plaintiff alleged that both searches violated her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p><p>After discovery was conducted, defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.</p><p>The District Court (Judge William M. Acker, Jr.) granted defendants' motion in part, denied it in part, and certified its order for appeal.  Skurstenis v. Jones,  81 F.Supp.2d 1228 (N.D.Ala. 1999).  Judge Acker held that the initial strip search was unconstitutional, but that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the strip search claim.  He denied the motion as to the lice inspection.  Both parties appealed.  </p><p>The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ( District Judge Vining) affirmed in part reversed in part and remanded the case.  The Court found that the Jail's blank strip search policy of searching all inmates, without any reasonable suspicion, was unconstitutional.  The initial strip search of plaintiff, however, was found to be justified as plaintiff was in possession of an unregistered handgun at the time of her arrest.  Possession of a weapon provided the ``reasonable suspicion'' necessary to conduct a strip search.   The Court also held that it was not inappropriate for medical personnel to conduct a strip</p><p>search of an inmate of the opposite sex, and determined that the lice inspection of plaintiff was therefore not unconstitutional. Skurstenis v. Jones,  236 F.3d 678 (11th Cir. 2000).</p><p>On remand,. the District Court (Judge Acker) dismissed plaintiff's remaining federal claims with prejudice and declined to further exercise jurisdiction over plaintiff's state-law claim for invasion of privacy and assault battery against the nurse assistant, dismissing those claims without prejudice. Skurstenis v. Jones,  139 F.Supp.2d 1291 (N.D.Ala. 2001).</p><p></p>",

      "text": "81 F.Supp.2d 1228 (1999)\nSandy SKURSTENIS, Plaintiff,\nv.\nSheriff James JONES, et al., Defendants.\nCivil Action No. 98-AR-2295-S.\nUnited States District Court, N.D. Alabama, Southern Division.\nDecember 20, 1999.\n11222390 *1229*1230 Jeffrey W. Bennitt, Robyn G. Bufford, Bennitt & Bufford, LLC, Birmingham, AL, for Plaintiff.\nK. Claire White, Ferguson Frost & Dodson LLP, Mark W. Lee, Dorothy A. Powell, Parsons Lee & Juliano,\nBirmingham, AL, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nACKER, District Judge.\nPresently before the court is a motion for summary judgment filed by defendants, James Jones, Sheriff of Shelby\nCounty, Alabama (\"the Sheriff\"), Wayne Watts, a captain in the Sheriff's office (\"Watts\"), Jason Smitherman, an\nofficer in the Sheriff's office (\"Smitherman\"), and Stacey Blankenship, an officer in the Sheriff's office\n(\"Blankenship\"). All are sued under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, as individuals and not in their official capacities.\nDefendants seek judgment as a matter of law on all claims asserted against them by plaintiff, Sandy Skurstenis\n(\"Skurstenis\"). Skurstenis claims that her Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated,\nfirst by a strip-search to which she was subjected while she was being admitted to the Shelby County Jail, and\nsecond, by a crotch search for lice just before her release. Skurstenis appends not unexpected state law claims.\nFor the reasons hereinafter discussed, defendants' motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\nBackground\nOn May 8, 1998, an officer in the Sheriffs office, not a defendant here, arrested Skurstenis for driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol. A .38 special handgun with an expired permit was found on the floorboard of Skurstenis' car.\nAfter an intoxilyzer reflected a blood alcohol level of .18, Skurstenis was taken to the Shelby County Jail, where,\nbecause of her degree of intoxication, she was required to stay overnight. She was told that she could have\nsomeone pick her up the next day at 11:00 a.m. She does not complain about her arrest or about her overnight\nstay. She does complain vociferously about what happened to her while she was in custody.\nAfter being booked, Skurstenis was taken to a restroom adjacent to the booking area by Blankenship, a female\nofficer. Skurstenis was told to disrobe, to turn and face the wall, and to squat and cough. This procedure arguably\nconstitutes a relatively mild form of body cavity search, but it is nevertheless unpleasant. How a woman as\ninebriated as Skurstenis allegedly could squat without toppling is a scientific question worthy of exploration at\nsome other time and place. Skurstenis was next given a jail uniform, was walked by defendant Smitherman\nthrough an area where other female inmates were sleeping, and was placed in a solitary cell. This was\nSmitherman's only contact with Skurstenis.\nAt approximately 10:30 a.m., after having spent the night \"sleeping it off,\" Skurstenis was instructed to go to the\ninfirmary, where she found three female inmates and a male in jeans and a t-shirt. Skurstenis did not know who\nthe man was or what his position was. He wore no badge or other identification. He has since been identified as\nT.O. Richey, an employee of Shelby Baptist Medical Center (\"Shelby Baptist\"). He was later made a defendant\nand has only recently filed his answer. Shelby Baptist had a contract with the Sheriff to perform certain medical\n\nservices in relation to the jail inmates. A copy of the contract is conspicuously absent from the record. The court\ncannot know who, if anybody, might be helped or hurt by the terms of that contract.\nRichey asked the other persons in the room to leave. He then informed Skurstenis that, pursuant to Shelby\nCounty law, he was required to run some tests on her. This court is unaware of any difference between the law of\n1231 Shelby County, Alabama, and the law of Alabama generally, insofar as the law that governs the *1231 situation in\nwhich Richey and Skurstenis found themselves. Richey took a blood sample from Skurstenis and then told her to\nstand up in front of him and to pull down her pants so that he could check her for \"crabs.\" She pulled her pants\ndown below her pubic hair, whereupon Richey ran his fingers back and forth through her pubic hair eight or ten\ntimes, looking for lice. A short period of time later Skurstenis was booked out and left the jail with her husband.\nDiscussion\nSkurstenis was searched twice, each time for a different purpose. In this suit she claims that each search\nconstituted a constitutional deprivation.\nStrip-Search Upon Entry Into Jail\nSkurstenis first claims that her Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search was violated when\nshe was strip-searched upon entry into the jail. That search was performed pursuant to the Sheriff's policy of\nstrip-searching all detainees, regardless of any individualized suspicion, whenever a detainee was to be\n\"intermingled\" with the jail's general population. Both the brief submitted by plaintiff and the brief submitted by\ndefendants refer to policies and procedures of the \"Shelby County Jail.\" The Shelby County Jail is, in fact and in\nlaw, the Sheriff himself.\nIn defining the contours of the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Court held in Terry v. Ohio:\n[W]herever an individual may harbor a reasonable expectation of privacy, he [or she] is entitled to\nbe free from unreasonable governmental intrusion. Of course, the specific content and incidents of\nthis right must be shaped by the context in which it is asserted. For what the Constitution forbids is\nnot all searches and seizures, but unreasonable searches and seizures.\nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1873, 20 L.Ed.2d 889,(1968)(internal quotations and citations\nomitted).\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court applied the Terry principles in a prison context as follows:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nEarlier in the Bell opinion the Court had acknowledged:\nThe fact of confinement as well as the legitimate goals and policies of the penal institution limits\n[any] retained constitutional rights.\n* * * * * *\nPrison administrators therefore should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and\nexecution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order\nand discipline and to maintain institutional security.\nId. at 546-47, 99 S.Ct. at 1878.\n\nLooking at the evidence under the focus of defendants' Rule 56, F.R. Civ. P., motion, the court must give plaintiff\nthe benefit of the doubt on the facts. Skurstenis is entitled to any fair interpretation of the evidence, including all of\nits favorable nuances. The court must examine the strip-search at issue here to check its reasonableness under\nthe totality of the circumstances.\nIn the Eleventh Circuit and elsewhere the law of strip-search is surprisingly undeveloped, considering the\n1232 invasiveness of the procedure and the frequency of its *1232 occurrence. There is precious little helpful\nprecedent. Nonetheless, the court will address the cases that provide whatever guidance there is, comparing the\nfacts of those cases with the facts of the Skurstenis case.\nIn Bell, quoted supra, all pre-trial detainees were required to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as\npart of an automatic strip-search conducted after every contact with a person from outside the penal institution\nbefore detainees could be returned to the general population. The Supreme Court balanced the prison's security\nconcerns against the invasion of an individual's privacy, and concluded that a strip-search can sometimes be\nconducted on less than probable cause. Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. The Bell court also found that the search\nthere being reviewed was justified not only because weapons or contraband might be discovered by such a\nroutine, but because such a search might deter prisoners from attempting to smuggle contraband into the jail. Id.\nat 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nWhile Bell is helpful in certain respects, several of its important facts are different from those here. The main\ndifference is that Skurstenis had no contact with anyone \"outside the institution\" after she was arrested,\nsomething essential to the decision in Bell. Skurstenis was stopped by the police as she was leaving a\nconvenience store. She failed her field sobriety test and was arrested, without any need whatsoever for an\nexercise of force. She was not out of law enforcement supervision from the first moment she was approached by\nthe arresting officer, until her eventual release. She did not meet with any \"visitor,\" nor did she have any\nopportunity to acquire or to hide a weapon or other contraband. See Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th\nCir.1984). The only reason she might have had for hiding contraband is that before she left home and began to\nimbibe, she had decided to secrete contraband in a body cavity anticipating that she might be arrested and want\nthe contraband in jail. Hardly a likely scenario. In balancing the security needs of the institution against the\nprivacy rights of the individual, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to justify the extreme invasion of Skurstenis'\nprivacy on the infinitesimal possibility of finding contraband. The circumstances of the present case are quite\ndifferent from the situation in Bell, where the inmate was searched after meeting a visitor who had time to plan a\nsmuggling attempt. Moreover, as to the deterrent value, the lesson to be taught Skurstenis, if that was the\nSheriff's purpose, was too cruel a lesson, as well as an unnecessary lesson under the circumstances. The\npurpose of a body cavity search should not be to teach women generally not to hide contraband in their body\ncavities before shopping at convenience stores while under the influence of alcohol. \"Cookie-cutter\" justice may\nbe \"equal\" justice, but it is not always real justice. To enforce an invariable rule of strip-searching all detainees\nbooked into jail, because of its alleged deterrent effect, is, in the opinion of this court, taking an otherwise\ntolerable idea beyond its logical limits. See Giles, 746 F.2d at 617.\nThere is another crucial difference between this particular detainee and the detainee in Bell. The inmate in Bell\nwas truly intermingled with the jail's \"general population.\" Here, Skurstenis was due to be released the next\nmorning. She was held for the night in solitary. She had no physical contact with other inmates. She was\nintroduced into the \"general population\" only to the extent that she was escorted by a prison official to her single-\noccupant cell through an area where other female prisoners were sleeping. This was not enough contact to\nprovide the Sheriff with a legitimate basis for contending that Skurstenis was introduced into the \"general\npopulation.\" This is a real and substantive difference between Skurstenis' situation and that in Bell.\n1233 The lack of intermingling with the general population is not a minor distinguishing *1233 feature. On virtually\nidentical facts, except for the lack of \"intermingling\" with the \"general population,\" the Fourth Circuit found a strip-\nsearch to be unconstitutional. The Fourth Circuit held:\n[T]he strip search policy promulgated by Sheriff Clements and enforced by his department was\nconclusively shown to be unconstitutional under the standards laid out in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S.\n520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447.... On the undisputed and stipulated evidence, Logan's strip\n\nsearch bore no such discernible relationship to security needs at the Detention Center that, when\nbalanced against the ultimate invasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably be thought\njustified. At no time would Logan or similar detainees be intermingled with the general jail\npopulation; her offense, though not a minor traffic offense, was nevertheless one not commonly\nassociated by its very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband; there was no cause\nin her specific case to believe that she might possess either.... An indiscriminate strip search\npolicy routinely applied to detainees such as Logan along with all other detainees cannot be\nconstitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security\nconsiderations.\nLogan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir.1981)(emphasis added).\nThe subsequent procedural history of Logan is as instructive as its above quoted language. The Supreme Court\nwas asked to stay the mandate of the Fourth Circuit. Justice Rehnquist, the author of Bell, acting in his capacity\nas Circuit Justice, issued a temporary stay pending consideration of the application for stay by the full Court. \nClements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1304, 102 S.Ct. 284, 70 L.Ed.2d 461. In issuing his stay, the future Chief Justice\nfound that the Fourth Circuit, while purporting to apply the standards of Bell, failed to consider \"the central\nobjective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional security.\" Id. at 1310, 102 S.Ct. at 288. Justice\nRehnquist, who spoke only for himself, said:\nThe clear import of [the Fourth Circuit's] decision is that strip-searches may not be conducted\nwithout probable cause to believe that the subject of the search possesses weapons or\ncontraband. No such requirement attended the search policy upheld in Bell v. Wolfish, and indeed\nthe Court expressly held that strip-searches need not be conditioned on probable cause. Id., at\n560, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. Nor was the result in Bell v. Wolfish predicated on a showing that searches\nwere limited to those persons whose alleged offenses were \"commonly associated by [their] very\nnature with the possession of weapons or contraband.\" 660 F.2d at 1013. In short, the Court of\nAppeals decision reads as if Bell v. Wolfish had never been decided.\nClements v. Logan, 454 U.S. at 1310, 102 S.Ct. at 288.\nUpon consideration by the full Supreme Court, Justice Rehnquist's stay was vacated. Clements v. Logan, 454\nU.S. 1117, 102 S.Ct. 961, 71 L.Ed.2d 105,(1981). Later, when the original Logan v. Shealy was brought up on\napplication for writ of certiorari, the writ was denied. Justice Rehnquist's expressions may or may not reflect what\nthe present Supreme Court would say under the same or similar circumstances, but what he said in granting a\ntemporary stay is not binding precedent.\nIf defendants here mean only to argue that strip-searches without \"probable cause\" are sometimes permissible,\nthis court cannot disagree. But a line must be drawn. It is drawn here against the Sheriff by holding that strip-\nsearches are not permissible without \"probable cause\" when a non-felony detainee is held without being\n\"intermingled with the general population.\"\nAn additional aspect of the Skurstenis situation troubles this court greatly and calls for the drawing of another\n1234 line. If *1234 there were doubt on the other grounds discussed, an additional fact would tip the balance against\nthe Sheriff on the question of the reasonableness of his strip-search of Skurstenis. The Sheriff concedes that only\nfemale detainees in Skurstenis' position were subjected to strip-searches. When males were brought in on a DUI\nand are required to \"sleep it off,\" they were provided with a holding cell outside the \"general population\" and were\nnot required to undergo a strip-search. This court has no reason to doubt the Sheriff when he explains that his\novercrowded jail simply has \"no space available ... to hold intoxicated female inmates without housing them in\n[what the Sheriff refers to as] the general population.\" Nonetheless, this disparate treatment of the sexes gives\npause to any thinking person. We are taught that under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, \"[p]arties who seek to defend gender-based government action must demonstrate an `exceedingly\npersuasive justification' for that action.\" U.S. v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 2274, 135 L.Ed.2d\n735 (1996). Although the instant case is not an Equal Protection case, the Fourth and the Fourteenth\namendments become inexorably linked under the unique set of facts in this case.\n\nThe court credits the Sheriff's argument that his was not a \"gender-based government action,\" and, instead, was\none based on the physical realities arising from the fact of limited resources. The court understands the Sheriff's\nproblem, but cannot accept such a facile answer for what happened here. This court believes that a way could\nhave been found within the Sheriff's fiscal and physical constraints to provide equal treatment to the sexes\ninsofar as their being exposed to strip-searches in the Shelby County Jail. Strip-searches are universally\nregarded as \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive,\nsignifying degradation and submission.\" Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 192 (11th Cir. 1992).\nNeither males nor females should be singled out for such a degrading experience. The court agrees with the\nfollowing portion of Judge Posner's dissent in Johnson v. Phelan, a case dealing with a male pretrial detainee's ยง\n1983 action seeking damages based on the fact that female guards had monitored him while he was naked:\nThere are different ways to look upon the inmates of prisons and jails in the United States in 1995.\nOne way is to look upon them as members of a different species, indeed as a type of vermin,\ndevoid of human dignity and entitled to no respect... I do not myself consider the 1.5 million\ninmates of American prisons and jails in that light....[W]e should have a realistic conception of the\ncomposition of the prison and jail population before deciding that they are a scum entitled to\nnothing better than what a vengeful populace and a resource-starved penal system choose to give\nthem. We must not exaggerate the distance between \"us,\" the lawful ones, the respectable ones,\nand the prison and jail population; for such exaggeration will make it too easy for us to deny that\npopulation the rudiments of humane consideration.\nJohnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 151-52 (7th Cir.1995)(Posner, J., dissenting).\nJustice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 192 (11th Cir.1992), is the only Eleventh Circuit opinion that\nprovides any guidance for this case. At least it is the only such decision found by this court. There, a municipality\nenacted a drug and alcohol abuse plan calling for increased vehicle stops with emphasis on teenage drug\noffenders. Pursuant to the plan, a police officer pulled into a church parking lot to investigate two parked cars.\nThe cars attempted to leave. The officer recognized one of the cars as belonging to a sixteen-year-old male. The\n1235 officer pulled him over. As the officer approached the car, he saw the boy give something to his *1235 passenger,\na fourteen-year-old girl. Upon determining that the teenagers were truants, the officer arranged for a juvenile\nofficer to come to the church parking lot. Both teenagers were arrested and taken to the police station. There, an\nofficer directed two female officers to strip-search the juvenile female. No contraband was found. The juvenile\nfemale sued the city and the officers in their individual and official capacities, challenging the constitutionality of\nthe strip-search. The Eleventh Circuit determined that the officers had \"reasonable suspicion\" that the girl was\ncarrying contraband. The Eleventh Circuit considered the totality of the circumstances and found:\n[L]aw enforcement officers may subject a juvenile who is lawfully in custody to a strip search\nbased on reasonable suspicion that the juvenile is concealing a weapon or contraband, when the\nstrip search is conducted in the least intrusive manner, even when the juvenile is in custody after\nbeing arrested for an offense that is not a felony.\nId. at 189.\nPeachtree City became the focus of a subsequent case in the Middle District of Alabama. Chief Judge Albritton\nconsidered Peachtree City's requirement that there be at least \"reasonable suspicion\" before a strip-search. He\nwrote:\nPlaintiffs have asked this court to hold the searches unconstitutional because the Defendants had\nno probable cause or reasonable suspicion for the search. In Peachtree City, the Eleventh Circuit\nappears to place some emphasis on the idea that the officer had `reasonable suspicion' for the\nsearch.... It is not certain from a fair reading of the opinion whether this requirement is present\nonly because the case involved a juvenile arrestee. Indeed, given that the juvenile in that case\nwas not going to be placed in a cell, Peachtree is not exactly persuasive authority on this issue. In\nany event, however, this court will not read the Eleventh Circuit's decision to require that some\n\nheightened justification be present for a jail official to search a new inmate before they are placed\nin lockup with other prisoners.\nMagill v. Lee County, 990 F.Supp. 1382, 1390 (M.D.Ala.1998), aff'd. 161 F.3d 22 (11th Cir.Ala. Sept. 30, 1998).\n(Table, No. 98-6144).\nThe Skurstenis case is quickly distinguishable from Magill. In Magill the new inmates were to be \"intermingled\"\nwith the \"general population.\" As already discussed ad nauseam, Skurstenis was not \"intermingled\" in the way\nthe word \"intermingled\" is used in the cases. With respect to the \"reasonable suspicion\" question, this court does\nnot reach the same conclusion that Judge Albritton reached on his set of facts. As far as this court can tell, the\nEleventh Circuit in Peachtree City gave no indication that it required \"reasonable suspicion\" only where a juvenile\nis involved. Rather, the Peachtree City court held:\nThe Bell balancing test for reasonableness requires at a minimum, that the facts upon which an\nintrusion is based be capable of measurement against an objective standard, whether this be\nprobable cause or a less stringent test. Courts which have considered the strip search issue have\napplied objective standards ranging from reasonable suspicion to probable cause. See, e.g., Giles\nv. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir.1984) (holding that arrestees for minor offenses may be\nsubjected to a strip search only if jail officials have reasonable suspicion to believe that arrestees\nare concealing weapons or contraband), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d\n479, (1985); Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980), aff'g, 479 F.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wis.1979)\n(holding that arrestees for minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials\nhave probable cause to believe that arrestees are concealing weapons or contraband).\n* * * * * *\n1236 *1236 Due to the extremely intrusive nature of a strip search, strip searches of arrestees based on\nless than probable cause have only been upheld where such searches were necessary to protect\nthe overriding security needs of the institution 00 that is, where officials have a reasonable\n97\nsuspicion that a particular detainee harbors weapons or dangerous contraband. Fuller v. M.G.\nJewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1447 (9th Cir.1991).\nPeachtree City, 961 F.2d at 192-93 (internal quotations omitted). The Eleventh Circuit's words give no indication\nthat the court is applying its holdings only to juveniles, and none of the three cases it cited with approval involved\na juvenile. In fact, Peachtree City expressly says that the \"security dangers to the institution are the same\nwhether the detainee is a juvenile or an adult.\" If the Eleventh Circuit wishes to elaborate upon its expressions in \nPeachtree City or to revisit the issues discussed in that case, it will do so in its own good time.\nThis court has taken perhaps too much time attempting to explain its conclusion that the objective need for a\nstrip-search under some circumstances cannot justify subjecting Skurstenis and other similarly situated female\ndetainees to a strip-search without \"reasonable suspicion\" of something that might prompt such a search.\nDefendants argue that, even if the first search of Skurstenis was unconstitutional, they are entitled to \"qualified\nimmunity.\" With this proposition the court reluctantly agrees. As the Eleventh Circuit has held, \"[u]nless a\ngovernment agent's act is so obviously wrong, in the light of pre-existing law, that only a plainly incompetent\nofficer or one who was knowingly violating the law would have done such a thing, the government actor has\nimmunity from suit.\" Lassiter v. Alabama A & M University, Bd. of Trustees, 28 F.3d 1146, 1149 (11th Cir.1994).\nAlthough this court finds that this strip-search was unconstitutional, the Sheriff had no compelling reason to reach\nthe same conclusion before the strip-search. He certainly had no reason to analyze the prior jurisprudence as this\ncourt has just done.\nA two-step analysis is required to determine whether a public actor is entitled to qualified immunity in a ยง 1983\ncase. Zeigler v. Jackson, 716 F.2d 847, 849 (11th Cir.1983). The first inquiry is whether the government official\nwas acting within the scope of discretionary authority. This element is conceded in the present case. The burden,\ntherefore, was placed on plaintiff to prove that some target defendant violated \"clearly established\" law. Id. With\nrespect to this second element, the court agrees with defendants Blankenship and Jones that at the time of the\nfirst search to which they were parties there was no \"clearly established\" law in this circuit adequately describing\n\nthe contours of constitutionally permissible strip-searches. While this court finds that this particular strip-search\nwas, in fact and law, unconstitutional, the law on the subject was, and still is, so undeveloped in this circuit that\nthe court cannot say that \"only a plainly incompetent officer or one who was knowingly violating the law would\nhave done such a thing.\" Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1149.\nThe court wonders aloud whether its solo conclusion that what the Sheriff did here upon plaintiff's entry into the\nShelby County Jail was unconstitutional will \"clearly establish\" anything for the future. A district court opinion,\neven if it is published, only binds the parties. It probably will not \"establish the law\" for any jailer except, perhaps,\nthe Sheriff of Shelby County until the Eleventh Circuit agrees or disagrees. This is a good enough reason to hope\nthat the Eleventh Circuit will take this case on interlocutory appeal and will expand upon the approach it recently\ntook in Hartley v. Parnell, 193 F.3d 1263 (11th Cir.1999). If the Eleventh Circuit considers an appeal by Skurstenis\nof this court's finding of qualified immunity for the Sheriff and Blankenship against her Fourth Amendment\n1237 objection to the first *1237 search while considering the Sheriff's anticipated appeal from the denial of his claim of\nqualified immunity as to the later lice inspection, the parties in this case, and other in cases just around the\ncorner, should be grateful.\nThe court finds that the defendants who had any connection with the strip-search conducted upon entry into the\njail are qualifiedly immune. The other defendants are entitled to summary judgment because they had no\n[1]\nconnection at all to that search. Therefore, summary judgment for Jones, Watts, Smitherman,  and\nBlankenship, constituting all defendants, will be granted as to the strip-search upon entry into the jail.\nThe Inspection To Prevent Lice From Escaping From the Jail\nIf the second aspect of this case constitutes a viable Fourth Amendment claim, the \"reasonableness\" of the last\nminute inspection for lice is to be judged by the same standard upon which the strip-search upon entry into the\njail was judged. It is entirely possible that because the presence of a louse cannot prove criminal conduct, there\nis no Fourth Amendment implication in searching for a louse. The Fourth Amendment was designed by the\nauthors of the Bill of Rights as a limitation on governmental searches for, and seizures of, possible incriminating\nevidence or contraband. As an alternative to the Fourth Amendment as a basis for plaintiff's ยง 1983 complaint\nabout the lice inspection, Skurstenis invokes the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process, which, in\n[2]\nthis case would have to refer to \"substantive\" due process.  Defendants urge the court to analyze this second\nclaim, like the first claim, only under the Fourth Amendment. This court is not sure of what category of potential\nconstitutional violation an unknown male's search for lice in a female's pubic hair fits into, if it fits into any\nconstitutional category, but the court is positive in its disagreement with defendants' hopeful assertion that plaintiff\nhas no avenue of constitutional attack. One or both of plaintiff's theories get her somewhere, which is the gist of\nthe rest of this opinion.\nIf this is a Fourth Amendment case, Bell requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of the personal rights that the search entails. Richey was, after all, \"searching\" for lice, even if only as a\nmatter of public sanitation. Courts must consider the scope of a particular intrusion, the manner in which it is\nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at\n1884. As the Peachtree City court observed:\nThe Bell balancing test for reasonableness requires at a minimum, that the facts upon which an\nintrusion is based be capable of measurement against an objective standard, whether this be\nprobable cause or a less stringent test.\nPeachtree City, 961 F.2d at 192 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\nIn the present case, the physical touching and inspection of the exposed pelvic region of a female non-felony\ndetainee was conducted by an unidentified male dressed in blue jeans and a t-shirt. He was \"searching\" for\nthings that are neither weapons nor other forms of contraband, with no \"probable cause\" in the traditional sense,\n1238 and no reasonable suspicion of *1238 wrongdoing by the person being inspected. Arguably, there is always a\nsuspicion that a louse may be present in the pubic hair of a human being.\n\nThis particular intrusion on Skurstenis' privacy cannot hold up to measurement by any objective standard, either\nunder Fourth Amendment analysis or under Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process analysis. There was\nsimply no legitimate basis for this pelvic inspection, which becomes absolutely uncivilized when conducted by an\nunknown male. At the time of her release, Skurstenis was hardly about to introduce lice into the jail. The test for\nthe reasonableness of any \"search\" requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the\ninvasion of personal rights. Skurstenis was in the process of leaving the jail when she was required to expose\nherself to a hands-on search by a male. Because the invasion of her privacy was extreme, this \"search\" fails the\nreasonableness test by, as another court has described it, \"two and a half country miles.\" See, e.g., Peachtree\nCity, 961 F.2d at 193.\nDefendants have anticipated this court's criticisms of the lousy search with three arguments. First, they contend\nthat this \"search\" was reasonable because lice infestations are a serious problem at this jail. Second, defendants\nargue that this search, even if unreasonable, was not attributable to the Sheriff because his only policy was that\nlice \"searches\" be carried out. He says that the Shelby Baptist Medical Center actually performed the searches\nand determined how they were to be conducted. Third, defendants argue that even if such \"searches\" are found\nto be unconstitutional and are attributable to the Sheriff, he and his employees are protected by qualified\nimmunity.\nWith respect to defendants' first argument, the seriousness of the lice problem cannot justify a search that occurs\nminutes before a detainee is to be released. Any lice that might have made it into the jail with the detainee will\nhave already made it. Sheriffs may have an obligation to prevent the escape of prisoners but not to prevent the\nescape of bugs. If the Sheriff is responsible to the outside populace not to let a louse loose, such is not a\ncompelling enough public health obligation to justify a hands-on pubic hair search of a female detainee by an\nunknown male moments before her discharge. Having this \"crab\" check performed by an unidentified male in\nblue jeans and a t-shirt was bound to increase the distress suffered by Skurstenis, without providing any\nmeasurable improvement in public sanitation. Any competent jailer should understand the importance of having\nsearches performed by same-sex jail staff members. In fact, in this jail's own policy on Search At Time Of\nAdmission, Policy Number B-103, this point is made twice, both at the original pat-down stage and at the\n\"complete search\" stage. \"Complete search\" is the jail's euphemism for \"strip-search.\" All strip-searches are\nrequired to be performed by a \"same sex jail staff member.\" In the lice inspection under consideration here, if it\nwas a \"search\" for Fourth Amendment purposes, as defendants seem to concede, there was no excuse for an\nunidentified male in jeans and a t-shirt to run his fingers through plaintiff's pubic hair eight to ten times. The gross\nunconscionability of this \"search\" is, or should be, self-evident.\nThe fact that what happened here may have been an aberrational occurrence does not insulate the Sheriff from ยง\n1983 liability. The Sheriff's argument that if this particular lice search was unreasonable, it cannot be attributed to\nhim because he did not establish the procedure for the search, which was actually performed by Shelby Baptist in\naccordance with policies and procedures devised by it, is rejected by this court. The Alabama Code provides:\nThe sheriff has the legal custody and charge of the jail in his county and all prisoners committed\n1239 thereto, except in cases otherwise provided by law, and *1239 may appoint a jailer for whose acts\nhe is civilly responsible.\nAlabama Code, ยง 14-6-1.\nThis statute obviates the applicability of Monell v. Department of Social Services of City of New York, 436 U.S.\n658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), by establishing that a sheriff in Alabama is invariably the decision\nmaker and the policy maker vis-a-vis the jail population and is the ultimately responsible party. A sheriff has more\nthan mere custody. He controls every movement of a prisoner, every meal, every inspection, every aspect of\nprison existence. It is difficult to comprehend, much less to agree with, the Sheriff's contention that he can\nphysically hand a prisoner over to an independent contractor and immunize himself from ยง 1983 liability for\nwhatever thereafter happens to that person. The Sheriff wisely does not try to argue Monell. Eleventh Circuit law\nconfirms the inability of the Sheriff to abdicate his statutory responsibility. That court said:\n\nThe federal courts have consistently ruled that governments, state and local, have an obligation to\nprovide medical care to incarcerated individuals... This duty is not absolved by contracting with an\nentity such as Prison Health Services. Although Prison Health Services has contracted to perform\nan obligation owed by the county, the county itself remains liable for any constitutional\ndeprivations caused by the policies or customs of the Health Service. In that sense, the county's\nduty is non-delegable.\nAncata v. Prison Health Services, Inc., 769 F.2d 700, 705 (11th Cir.1985).\nAlthough Ancata is a medical care case and not a search case, the principle is the same, namely, that an entity\n[3]\nthat is legally responsible for the custody of a prisoner cannot get rid of that responsibility by contract.\nFinally, the Sheriff argues, as he successfully did with respect to the strip-search upon entry, that even if he did\nviolate Skurstenis' constitutional rights in the lice inspection, he is shielded by qualified immunity. He points out\nthat there is no decision by the Supreme Court or by the Eleventh Circuit forbidding what Skurstenis here\ncomplains of, namely, the search of a woman's pubic hair for lice by a man in a t-shirt moments before the\nwoman departs the jail. He does not add the fact of the detainee's ethnicity or day of the week when the\ninspection occurred. The Sheriff says that without unambiguous prior instructions from the Eleventh Circuit, or\nfrom the Supreme Court, he could not have been expected to know that his prospective action was\nunconstitutional. This court has already speculated that a lower federal court's very graphic and detailed\npublished opinion probably would not constitute an effective warning for qualified immunity purposes. But, what if\nthe Supreme Court of Alabama had written a very detailed \"red flag\" opinion in a prior ยง 1983 case, warning\nAlabama sheriffs not to do what this sheriff did to Skurstenis? After all, state courts have concurrent jurisdiction\nwith federal courts over ยง 1983 cases. If, before the subject event, the Supreme Court of Alabama had issued a\nsharp reprimand to a sheriff for having allowed a male to conduct a lice search of a female shortly before she\ndeparted from his jail, could a reasonable Alabama sheriff ignore that warning with impunity and obtain qualified\nimmunity in a subsequent identical situation? Fortunately, this is only a hypothetical question. The Eleventh\n1240 Circuit has held that \"preexisting law must dictate, that is, truly *1240 compel (not just suggest or allow or raise a\nquestion about), the conclusion for every like-situated, reasonable government agent that what defendant is\ndoing violated federal law in the circumstances.\" Lassiter v. Alabama A & M University, Bd. of Trustees, 28 F.3d\n1146, 1150 (11th Cir.1994). The Eleventh Circuit suggests that public officials are only deemed to be familiar with\nthe published opinions of their particular federal Circuit Court of Appeals and the opinions of the Supreme Court\nof the United States. And everybody knows, ostensibly even sheriffs, that an unpublished opinion by the Eleventh\nCircuit on an identical set of facts would have no precedential value, and ostensibly could safely be ignored.\nThe necessity of a virtually identical set of facts is emphasized by the Eleventh Circuit. In Harbert Intern., Inc. v.\nJames, 157 F.3d 1271 (11th Cir.1998), the Eleventh Circuit made clear that a general principle of constitutional\nlaw, no matter how easily anticipated and understood, cannot substitute for precise precedential instruction. The\nEleventh Circuit put it this way:\nBecause [plaintiff] has pointed to no factually analogous case which establishes that the\ndefendants' conduct was a deprivation of property without due process of law, it has failed to\ndischarge its burden [of proving that the unconstitutionality of the act is clearly established].\nId. at 1285.\nIf Skurstenis must meet this unattainable standard in order to avoid the Sheriff's qualified immunity defense, she\nloses. This court has combed the books looking for a case sufficiently like this one to constitute that unmistakable\n\"red flag\" and cannot find such a case decided either by the Eleventh Circuit or by the Supreme Court. Could this\nbe because no male jailer has ever thought that he could get away with checking an exiting female's pubic hair\nfor \"crabs\"?\nThe availability of qualified immunity for what the Sheriff allowed here cannot turn on the ability of the Sheriff to\nhave found an Eleventh Circuit case or a Supreme Court case just like this one before the unfortunate event took\nplace. When a violation of a fundamental right is so obvious that no half-way intelligent public official could\n\nconclude in good faith that his proposed action is constitutional, a public official who does it anyway cannot claim\nqualified immunity. In such a scenario, qualified immunity is surrendered, notwithstanding the absence of \"all-\nfours\" pre-existing, binding precedent. This rather obvious concept was very well expressed by Judge Black in\nher special concurrence in Gonzalez v. Lee County Housing Authority, 161 F.3d 1290, 1311 (11th Cir.1998), as\nfollows:\nThe purpose of qualified immunity is to protect government officials from liability for conduct they\ncould not reasonably have known was unlawful. Much of federal constitutional law and statutory\nlaw is unpredictable and unclear in its application to particular circumstances. Thus, as the Court\nstates, we require materially similar case law or a very specific statute before saying that a\ngovernment official should have known her conduct was unlawful. [FN3] There is no specific pre-\nexisting case law applicable to this case. FN3. See Opinion at 1301 (\"Ordinarily, a plaintiff who\nseeks to overcome a state official's affirmative defense of qualified immunity must cite case law, in\nforce at the time of the defendant's actions, that would have made it absolutely clear that the\ndefendant's conduct violated federal law [and] we have acknowledged the possibility that some\nfederal statutory provisions will be sufficiently clear on their own to provide defendants with fair\nnotice of their obligations under the law.\"). On the other hand, we have recognized that in the\nextremely rare case a government official's conduct may be so egregious, in fact evil, as to be\n1241 obviously contrary to federal law, so that no case law or statute *1241 needs to have recognized\npreviously that materially similar conduct is unlawful. The facts alleged here, if true, make this that\nextremely rare case.\nId. at 1311.\nIn a recent ยง 1983 case,Martin v. Baugh, 156 F.3d 188, Appeal No. 96-6111 (11th Cir.1998) (unpublished), the\nEleventh Circuit found that this court committed error when it concluded that an earlier Eleventh Circuit decision\nhad \"clearly established\" that the particular conduct there under scrutiny was protected by the First Amendment\nfrom interference by a supervisory public official. The Baugh court found that the case which had been cited by\nthis court, namely Martinez v. City of Opa-Locka, 971 F.2d 708 (11th Cir.1992), was not \"sufficiently similar\" to the\nfact situation in Baugh to constitute an effective warning to a First Amendment violator that he must not punish a\nwhistleblowing subordinate. If a pre-existing earlier Eleventh Circuit holding on absolutely indistinguishable facts\nis necessary before a person acting under color of law can be stripped of his qualified immunity, this court\nhesitates to mention two foreign precedents that are, in this court's opinion, \"sufficiently similar\" to the instant\ncase to have provided fair warning to the Sheriff here, if he had read them. In Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F.2d 91 (7th\nCir.1980), the Seventh Circuit found that the strip-search of a 13-year-old female student was improper, even\nwithout prior Seventh Circuit precedent directly on point. The Seventh Circuit, without employing Judge Black's\nrationale from Gonzalez, found it impossible to find qualified immunity. In Draper v. Walsh, 790 F.Supp. 1553\n(W.D.Okla. 1991), a district court found that a detainee could not be subjected to a visual strip-search after a\nminor traffic violation, again, because no good faith was possible under the circumstances. These two cases are\njust as likely to have been studied by the Sheriff of Shelby County before this particular incident as the Sheriff\nwas likely to have studied similar opinions by the Eleventh Circuit, if any had existed. These preceding\nprecedents from the Seventh Circuit and the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, would, under\nEleventh Circuit precedent, not have constituted effective warnings to the Sheriff not to allow a male to conduct a\ncrotch examination of a female inmate minutes before her release from custody, but what these courts said in \nRenfrow and Draper do illustrate that anybody with walking around sense would know not to do what the Sheriff\ndid here. Justice Potter Stewart, when discussing his inability precisely to define pornography, observed: \"I know\nit when I see it.\" Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 1683, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964)\n(Stewart, J. concurring). Similarly, this court is unable precisely to explain what constitutes the constitutionally\nproscribed conduct that Judge Black was describing in Gonzalez, 161 F.3d at 1311, without \"all fours\" precedent,\nbut even without such precedent, this court \"know[s] it when [it] see[s] it.\" And this court sees it in this case. A\nreasonable sheriff could not possibly in good faith believe that what the Sheriff did or failed to do vis-a-vis\nSkurstenis just before she left the jail was constitutionally permissible. And this is true whether the conduct is\nevaluated under Fourth Amendment scrutiny or under Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny.\n\nState Law Claims\nAlabama grants sovereign immunity to its executive officers in Article I, Section 14 of the Alabama Constitution of\n1901. Section 14 states that \"the State of Alabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or\nequity.\" Both sheriffs and deputy sheriffs are considered executive officers of the state, immune from suit under\nSection 14. Tinney v. Shores, 77 F.3d 378, 383 (11th Cir.1996). Alabama law affords Section 14 immunity to state\nofficers whether sued in their official capacities or in their individual capacities. McMillian v. Johnson, 101 F.3d\n1242 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.1996). Accordingly, summary *1242 judgment on all state law claims, as to all defendants,\nwill be granted. Richey, who was not a state official, may be a target for plaintiff's state law claims for assault and\nbattery and invasion of privacy. He has not filed a motion for summary judgment.\nFourteenth Amendment Claims\nAs stated, plaintiff's claim of a violation of her rights under the Fourteenth Amendment can only be a claim that\nher right to \"substantive\" due process was violated. She makes no attempt to describe a denial of \"procedural\"\ndue process. The Supreme Court has held that where an enumerated constitutional right specifically applies to a\nclaimed violation, that claim should be looked at only as a possible violation of the enumerated right and not as a\nmatter of substantive due process. For example, in a Fourth Amendment case, where the claim was an allegedly\nillegal seizure, the Supreme Court held: \"Because the Fourth Amendment provides an explicit textual source of\nconstitutional protection against this sort of physically intrusive governmental conduct, that Amendment, not the\nmore generalized notion of `substantive due process,' must be the guide for analyzing these claims.\" Graham v.\nConnor, 490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1871, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). Here, the claim involving the body\nsearch upon plaintiff's entry into the jail can be examined only under the Fourth Amendment. While this court\nbelieves that that search was unconstitutional, the court has already held that the involved defendants enjoy\nqualified immunity because of an absence of \"sufficiently similar\" precedent.\nThe \"search\" for lice has been analyzed both as a Fourth Amendment violation and as a Fourteenth Amendment\nviolation. Under either of these constitutional approaches, or under both of them, there was a violation of\nplaintiff's constitutional rights, and there is no qualified immunity because of the obviousness of the violation.\nConclusion\nA separate and appropriate order in conformity with the foregoing opinion will be entered. Because the Sheriff\nshould, and undoubtedly will, appeal from the denial of qualified immunity as to the lice inspection, and because\nthis court could be wrong in granting him qualified immunity with respect to the initial strip-search, the court will\ncertify that ruling under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b) for an application by Skurstenis to the Eleventh Circuit for\ninterlocutory appeal.\n[1] The court takes particular notice of the fact that Smitherman's total involvement in this case is that he escorted\nSkurstenis to her holding cell for the night. The naming of Smitherman as a defendant borders on the frivolous.\n[2] As the Eleventh Circuit recently observed: \"The substantive element of the Due Process Clause protects\nthose rights that are `fundamental' 00 rights that are `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' The Supreme Court\n97\nhas deemed that most, but not all, of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights are fundamental. Certain\nunenumerated rights, such as the right to privacy, also merit protection.\" Skinner v. City of Miami, Fla., 62 F.3d\n344, 347 (11th Cir.1995) (internal citations omitted).\n[3] Only Sheriff Jones and Captain Watts are named as defendants with respect to the lice inspection, so Officers\nBlankenship and Smitherman are not involved. The court finds that under Alabama Code ยง 14-6-1, it is the Sheriff\nwho is given responsibility for the legal custody of the detainees, not Captain Watts, and it is the Sheriff who is\nresponsible for policy, not Captain Watts. Accordingly, with respect to all claims against Captain Watts relating to\nthe lice search, summary judgment is due to be granted.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Powell, Parsons Lee & Juliano, Birmingham, AL, for Defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nACKER, District Judge.\nThis court has now received the mandate following the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d\n678 (11th Cir.2000). The court is, of course, obligated to follow that mandate.\nWhen plaintiff, Sandy Skurstenis, first filed her complaint, she invoked 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 as her basis for access\nto this court, claiming that defendants had violated a federal statute, namely, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. T.O. Richey, a\nlater added defendant, is the man in blue jeans and a T-shirt who the Eleventh Circuit called a \"multi-functional\ntechnician\", but who did not so describe himself to plaintiff when he thoroughly examined her pubic hair for lice as\nshe exited the Shelby County Jail. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a), plaintiff appended state-law claims to her ยง\n1983 claim against the defendants, including Richey, for alleged invasion of privacy and assault and battery.\nRichey filed a motion for summary judgment in which he asserted, first, that his conduct did not violate\nconstitutional norms, but, if it did fail constitutional muster, that he nevertheless enjoyed qualified immunity\nbecause he had no reason to believe under then existing law that he had done anything violative of plaintiff's\nconstitutional rights. In his supporting brief Richey argued, inter alia:\nBecause the Defendant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law as to the Plaintiff's ยง\n1983 claim, this Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the Plaintiff's state law claims.\nThis court thereupon simply denied Richey's motion for summary judgment without separating what it thought\nabout the viability of the ยง 1983 claim from what it thought about the viability of the state-law claims. This meant,\nof course, that the case would proceed to trial unless Richey perfected an appeal under Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472\nU.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411(1985). Richey took his appeal as a matter of right from the denial of his\nchallenge to the ยง 1983 claim, but he neither sought a 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b) certification nor obtained leave of the\nEleventh Circuit to appeal from the denial of his motion for summary judgment insofar as the motion can be\nconstrued to assert an absolute defense to the state-law claims.\nIt is quite clear from the opinion of the Eleventh Circuit that to the extent any federal claims were not dismissed\nby this court before defendants took their interlocutory appeals those federal claims are now due to be dismissed.\nHowever, the dismissal of all federal claims does not end the matter, because it does not dispose of the pendent\nstate-law claims against Richey, who, as noted, appealed from this court's denial of his motion for summary\njudgment only as against the ยง 1983 claim. Richey had the absolute right to appeal from this court's refusal to\nrecognize his defense of qualified immunity to the ยง 1983 claim, but he had no right to appeal from the denial of\nhis motion for summary judgment as against plaintiff's state-law claims, that is, without special dispensation. The\nfact that his notice of appeal from the denial of his summary judgment motion did not make this distinction did not\nsomehow create appellate jurisdiction over both federal and state claims.\n\nBecause the Eleventh Circuit had no jurisdiction over the question of the viability of plaintiff's state-law claims,\n1293 this court rejects Richey's post-mandate contention *1293 that the Eleventh Circuit intended to instruct this court\nto dismiss all of plaintiff's claims against Richey, even the claims for invasion of privacy and assault and battery.\nThis court respectfully declines to construe the Eleventh Circuit's desultory expression on this subject as a\ndispositive order about something over which that court was never asked to speak. This court refuses to believe\nthat the Eleventh Circuit would purport to address an issue over which it had no jurisdiction. Despite what Richey\nnow urges upon this court, the fact that Richey's conduct vis-a-vis Skurstenis has now passed federal\nconstitutional muster does not mean that that same conduct cannot constitute an invasion of privacy and/or an\nassault and battery under Alabama law. When this court denied Richey's motion for summary judgment, this court\nwas holding, rightly or wrongly, that plaintiff's state-law claims are jury triable. At that time this court was\nassuming pendent jurisdiction over state-law claims. Now that there is no longer any federal question upon which\nto append plaintiff's state-law claims, what should the court do with them?\nThe dismissal of all federal claims does not automatically deprive the federal court of supplementary jurisdiction\nover remaining state-law claims. See Palmer v. Hospital Authority of Randolph County, 22 F.3d 1559, 1568 (11th\nCir.1994). However, when federal claims are dismissed before trial, the preferred course for a federal court to\nfollow is to decline jurisdiction over the state-law claims, especially when the plaintiff, as in this case, can refile\nher complaint in the state court within thirty (30) days without exposing her state-law causes of action to a statute\nof limitations defense. 28 U.S.C ยง 1367(c) and (d); See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v.

In accordance with the tenets of federalism and of comity, state\ncourts should be the primary deciders of questions of state-law. See Hardy v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 954 F.2d\n1546, 1553, (11th Cir.1992). This is exactly what Richey himself suggested when he filed his motion for summary\njudgment. This court now joins Richey in expressing a preference for the state court to pass on Skurstenis's\nclaims of invasion of privacy and assault and battery.\nAn appropriate separate order will be entered.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The first search, for weapons and contraband, occurred\nwhen the detainee was booked into the jail and was conducted by a female deputy; the second search, for lice,\ntook place the following morning and was conducted by a male nurses assistant. The district court held that both\nsearches were unconstitutional but that the sheriff and deputy sheriff were entitled to qualified immunity with\nrespect to the initial search; the district court further held that neither the sheriff nor the nurses assistant was\nentitled to qualified immunity with respect to the second search. Concluding that both searches were\nconstitutional, we affirm in part, albeit on different grounds, and reverse in part.\nI. BACKGROUND\nOn the evening of May 8, 1998, a Shelby County, Alabama, deputy sheriff arrested Sandy Skurstenis for driving\nunder the influence of alcohol. Her blood alcohol registered .18 on the deputy's portable Breathalyzer and\nregistered .15 on an intoxilyzer test administered shortly thereafter. At the time of her arrest, Skurstenis had a .38\nspecial handgun, for which she had an expired permit, in the floorboard of her car.\nAfter her arrest, Skurstenis was taken to the Shelby County Jail, where, because of her blood alcohol level, she\n[1]\nwas to remain until around 11:00 a.m. the following morning.  After being booked into the jail, Skurstenis was\ntaken to a restroom adjacent to the booking area by Deputy Stacy Blankenship, a female officer. Skurstenis was\ntold to disrobe, to turn and face the wall, and to squat and cough. After doing this, she was given a jail uniform,\nwas escorted by Deputy Jason Smitherman through an area where other female inmates were sleeping, and was\nplaced in a solitary cell.\nThe next morning, at approximately 10:30 a.m., Skurstenis was instructed to go to the infirmary, where she\n[2]\nencountered three other female inmates and one male, T.O. Richey, a nurses assistant,  employed by the\nShelby Baptist Medical Center. Richey worked part-time at the jail pursuant to a contract between the sheriff's\n\n681 office and the medical center. When he *681 was finished with the other inmates, Richey asked them to leave\nand then informed Skurstenis that pursuant to the jail's policy, he was required to run certain tests on her. After\nSkurstenis signed a consent form, Richey took some blood samples from her and then told her to pull her pants\ndown so that he could check for lice. Richey ran his fingers through the hair on her head and also through her\npubic hair. At no time did he touch her genitalia. When the examination was completed, Skurstenis left the\ninfirmary and a short time thereafter was discharged from the jail and left with her husband, who had come to get\nher.\nSkurstenis subsequently filed this action against Sheriff James Jones, Chief Jailer Captain Wayne Watts,\nDeputies Jason Smitherman and Stacy Blankenship, and T.O. Richey in their individual capacities, and asserted\n[3]\nclaims under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for constitutional violations  and under state law for invasion of privacy, assault,\n[4]\nand battery.\nIn ruling on the defendants' motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment to\nCaptain Watts and Deputy Smitherman on the basis that they had no real connection to the strip search that\noccurred when Skurstenis was booked into the jail and that her complaint, therefore, failed to state a claim\nagainst them. The district court further held that the initial strip search violated the Skurstenis's constitutional\nrights but that Sheriff Jones and Deputy Blankenship were entitled to qualified immunity. Finally, the district court\nheld that the infirmary search violated Skurstenis's constitutional rights, that Sheriff Jones was not entitled to\nqualified immunity, that Richey had no standing to assert qualified immunity, and that, even if he did, he would not\n[5]\nbe entitled to qualified immunity.  Recognizing that only the denials of qualified immunity would be appealable\nas a matter of right, the district court certified its order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(b), and this court granted\npermission for Skurstenis to appeal those portions of the district court's order which granted qualified immunity.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA district court's grant or denial of summary judgment is subject to de novo review by this court. Hamilton v. Allen-\nBradley Co., 217 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir.2000).\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court held that routine strip\nsearching of pretrial detainees was not a per se violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against\nunreasonable searches and seizures. In articulating the balancing test applicable to such searches, the Court\nstated:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\n682 mechanical application. *682 In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular\nsearch against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the\nscope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating\nit, and the place in which it occurred.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nThe Bell balancing test for reasonableness requires, at a minimum, that the facts upon which the intrusion is\nbased be capable of measurement against an objective standard. Although one appellate court initially suggested\nthat probable cause might be required to justify a strip search, Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980) (\"The\nsearches were conducted despite the absence of probable cause to believe that the detainees were concealing\ncontraband or weapons on their bodies.\"), the courts of appeal now recognize that \"reasonable suspicion\" may\njustify a strip search of a pretrial detainee. See, e.g., Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997); Warner v.\nGrand County, 57 F.3d 962 (10th Cir.1995); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986)Stewart v. Lubbock County,\nTexas, 767 F.2d 153 (5th Cir.1985); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983). Indeed, in\nupholding the strip search of a juvenile, this court specifically held that law enforcement officers \"may conduct a\nstrip search of a juvenile in custody, even for a minor offense, based upon reasonable suspicion to believe that\nthe juvenile is concealing weapons or contraband.\" Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th\nCir.1992).\n\nIt is undisputed that Policy Number B-103 of the Shelby County Jail requires that each inmate be strip searched\nby a same sex jail staff member before being placed in a cell or detention room. This policy, which does not\nrequire any reasonable suspicion, does not comport with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. This court\nthus joins every other circuit which has had occasion to review a similar policy and holds such policy to be\nunconstitutional. See Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393 (10th Cir.1993) (citing cases from other circuits holding\nsame).\nBecause of one significant factor, however, this holding does not mean that the initial strip search performed on\nSkurstenis was ipso facto unconstitutional. When she was arrested and taken into custody, Skurstenis had a .38\nspecial handgun in her possession. Recognizing, as did the Bell court, that a detention center is a place \"fraught\nwith serious security dangers,\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, and, because of the deference that should\nbe afforded in matters of institutional security, see, e.g., Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 101 S.Ct. 173, 66 L.Ed.2d\n163 (1980), this court holds that possession of a weapon by a detainee provides the \"reasonable suspicion\"\nnecessary to authorize a strip search.\nHaving concluded that the search was justified, the court must now consider the other Bell factors, viz., the\nmanner in which the search was conducted and the place in which it was conducted. Skurstenis was taken to a\nbathroom and was observed only by Deputy Blankenship, a female officer; no body cavity search was\nundertaken. Under similar facts, this court concluded, \"Without a doubt, the officers conducted the strip search in\nthe least intrusive manner.\" Justice, 961 F.2d at 193. Consequently, this court concludes that Skurstenis's\nconstitutional rights were not violated by the strip search performed when she was booked into the jail.\nThe court now turns to the strip search performed on Skurstenis by T.O. Richey, the morning after she was\nincarcerated. A sheriff in Alabama \"has the legal custody and charge of the jail in his county and all prisoners\ncommitted thereto.\" Alabama Code ยง 14-6-1 (1975). Thus, for purposes of Monell v. Department of Social\n683 Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), the *683 sheriff is the final decision maker with\nrespect to jail policy.\nThe Alabama legislature has mandated that sheriffs \"exercise every precaution to prevent the spread of disease\namong the inmates.\" Alabama Code ยง 14-6-95. Pursuant to this mandate, the Shelby County jail instituted a\npolicy of searching all inmates who have been admitted to the general jail population for communicable diseases\nat the earliest possible time during their incarceration. Because of the prevalence of head and body lice among\ninmates and because of the difficulty in sanitizing an area after lice have been found, one of the prime objectives\nof this search is to determine if an inmate has such lice.\nThe Shelby County Commission contracted with the Shelby Baptist Medical Center [\"SBMC\"] to provide medical\nservices within the Shelby County jail. Under this contract, SBMC provided a nurses assistant and a registered\nnurse to the jail; those individuals generally worked Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. In\nexchange for these services, Shelby County reimbursed SBMC on an expense reimbursement basis, consisting\nof the salaries of the nurses assistant and registered nurse, supplies purchased by SBMC, and any services\nprovided directly by SBMC. SBMC is a not-for-profit corporation, and the contract between SBMC and Shelby\nCounty was performed on a not-for-profit basis.\nAlthough Sheriff Jones has adopted a policy requiring inmates to undergo a body search for communicable\ndiseases at the earliest possible time, he has not promulgated any regulations with respect to how this search is\nto be performed. Instead, the manner in which this kind of search is to be conducted is controlled by procedures\npromulgated by SBMC and conveyed by SBMC to its employees. Under these procedures, when there is a body\nsearch for lice, cranial and pubic hair both are examined, but there is no unnecessary contact with the inmate,\nnor are the inmate's genitals touched.\nAs with the booking search, this court applies the Bell balancing factors of scope, manner, justification and place\n[6]\nwith respect to this communicable disease search. Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. The search took\nplace in the infirmary, with no one present except Skurstenis and the nurses assistant. The intrusion was minimal,\nand, because of the threat of the transmission of body lice among inmates, the search was certainly justified. This\nleaves only the consideration of the manner in which the search was conducted. It was this factor which was of\n\nthe greatest concern to the district court, and it found the search highly offensive because it was conducted by a\nmale upon a female. The district court failed to give proper weight, however, to the fact that the male was part of\nthe medical staff of a hospital and was a nurses assistant.\nAlthough courts seem virtually unanimous in condemning strip searches conducted by prison personnel of the\nopposite sex except in the most extreme of circumstances, they are not so outspoken when it comes to strip\nsearches by medical personnel. Indeed, on those rare occasions when courts have discussed strip searches by\nmedical personnel, it is to point out that body cavity searches should be performed by medical, not jail, personnel.\nThe sex of the medical person conducting the search is either not identified or is mentioned only for informational\npurposes. See, e.g., Torres v. Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services, 859 F.2d 1523 (7th Cir.1988)\n684 (en banc) (recognizing, in a Title *684 VII suit brought by male officers challenging a decision to permit only\nfemale officers in the living units of an all-female prison, that the Wisconsin Administrative Code requires strip\nsearches to be performed \"in private by an officer of the same sex\" and that \"[b]ody cavity searches are only\nperformed by medical personnel in emergencies\"); Bonitz v. Fair, 804 F.2d 164 (1st Cir.1986) (finding body cavity\nsearches by prison officers unconstitutional and noting that the officers conducting the searches \"did not follow\nprison instructions that required internal examination of body cavities to be conducted by medical personnel\"), \noverruled on other grounds, Unwin v. Campbell, 863 F.2d 124 (1st Cir.1988); Daughtery v. Harris, 476 F.2d 292\n(10th Cir.1973) (upholding rectal searches \"carried out by trained paraprofessional medical assistants\"); Tribble v.\nGardner, 860 F.2d 321 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that prison officials were not entitled to qualified immunity when\ndigital rectal searches were not reasonably related to legitimate penological concerns and were conducted for\npunitive purposes but also noting that the searches were conducted by a \"physician's assistant\"); Hurley v. Ward,\n584 F.2d 609 (2d Cir.1978) (holding visual searches of the anal and genital areas of prisoners without probable\ncause to be unconstitutional but quoting New York law as follows: \"If there is reasonable cause to believe\ncontraband has been concealed in a body cavity, the inmate shall be immediately examined and/or x-rayed by a\nfacility health staff member\").\nHolding that it is not inappropriate for medical personnel to conduct a strip search of an inmate of the opposite\nsex and determining that the examination of Skurstenis for body lice was otherwise reasonable, this court\nconcludes that Sheriff Jones and Richey did not violate Skurstenis's constitutional rights. Consequently, the\ndistrict court's orders denying them summary judgment are reversed.\nIII. SUMMARY\nIn these consolidated appeals, Skurstenis has alleged that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the\nbooking and infirmary strip searches performed on her while she was a detainee in the county jail following her\narrest. Having found that Skurstenis's constitutional rights were not violated by either the booking search or the\ninfirmary search, this court AFFIRMS, although on different grounds, the district court's order granting summary\njudgment to Sheriff Jones, Captain Watts, Deputy Blankenship, and Deputy Smitherman with respect to the\nbooking search; this court AFFIRMS the district court's order granting summary judgment to Captain Watts as to\nthe infirmary search; and this court REVERSES the district court's order denying qualifying immunity to Sheriff\nJones and Richey with respect to the infirmary search and directs that Skurstenis's claims against them with\nrespect to the infirmary search be dismissed with prejudice on remand.\nAFFIRMED in part; REVERSED and REMANDED in part.\n[*] Honorable Robert L. Vining, Jr., U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia, sitting by designation.\n[1] Individuals arrested for driving under the influence cannot be released on bond but must be detained in jail for\na number of hours, depending on the degree of intoxication. Alabama Code ยง 31-5A-191 (1975).\n[2] His official title is \"multi functional technician.\"\n[3] In her complaint Skurstenis alleged that her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated. Since\nshe did not contend that any procedural due process rights were violated, the district court correctly analyzed her\nclaims as being under only the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has held that, where an enumerated\n\nconstitutional right specifically applies to a claimed violation, the claim should be analyzed only as a possible\nviolation of that enumerated right, not under the generalized notion of substantive due process. Graham v.\nConnor, 490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989).\n[4] Skurstenis also sued Shelby County and Shelby Baptist Medical Center. The district court, however,\ndismissed Skurstenis's claims against those entities, and those dismissals are not challenged in this appeal.\n[5] The district court also granted summary judgment to Captain Watts with respect to the infirmary search, since\nthe claim against him was based on the fact that he was the chief jailer. The district court correctly noted that\nunder Alabama Code ยง 14-6-1, the sheriff, not the jailer, is the person given legal responsibility for the legal\ncustody of inmates and that, consequently, the sheriff, not the chief jailer, is the final decision maker about jail\npolicy.\n[6] Both Skurstenis and the district court emphasized that this search was conducted a short time before\nSkurstenis was released from the jail, intimating that the search was some kind of \"exit\" search. However, the\nsearch was conducted at the first opportunity by medical personnel and was conducted the morning that\nSkurstenis was released only because the medical personnel did not arrive until that time. The fact that the\nsearch preceded Skurstenis's release from custody by just a few minutes was merely coincidental.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
