    "summary": "<p>In May, 1982, Vivian Smith filed a class action lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, alleging that the blanket strip search policy of the Montgomery County Detention Center, which required strip searching of all temporary detainees, violated the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  The policy in question required strip searching of every person housed at the Detention Center, regardless of the offense charged or whether there was reasonable suspicion that the search would yield weapons or contraband.  Represented by private counsel, Smith sought monetary damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and class certification.</p><p>The District Court (District Judge Shirley B. Jones) issued a preliminary injunction on September 13, 1982, enjoining the practice of visual strip searches of temporary detainees, except upon probable cause to believe such detainee has weapons or contraband concealed on his or her person, and then only in private.  Smith v. Montgomery County, 547 F.Supp. 592, 595 (D. Md. 1982).</p><p>The case was later reassigned to District Judge Joseph H. Young, who, by order dated October 26, 2003, dissolved the preliminary injunction for lack of standing, but certified the case as a damages class action, defining the class as:  all persons who were 'temporary detainees' (held for 24 hours or less) at the Montgomery County Detention Center (\"MCDC\") since May 20, 1979, and were strip searched absent probable cause to believe that they possessed either weapons or contraband.  Smith v. Montgomery County, 573 F.Supp. 604, 608 (D. Md. 1983).  An appeal was taken but dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Smith v. Montgomery County, Md., 740 F.2d 963 (4th Cir. 1984). Defendants later moved for reconsideration and for summary judgment in light of  subsequent Supreme Court decisions, Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984) and Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576 (1984).  Judge Young denied reconsideration and summary judgment, finding that the Supreme Court cases cited by the defendants did not change the Court's finding that the blanket strip search policy of Montgomery County was unconstitutional.  Smith v. Montgomery County, 607 F.Supp. 1303, 1306 (D. Md. 1985).</p><p>Later, Judge Young modified the class definition to reflect the adoption of a standard requiring \"reasonable suspicion\" of temporary detainees' possession of weapons or contraband (rather than the stricter \"probable cause\" standard) to justify strip searching, and redefined the class as follows: \"all persons who were temporary detainees at the Montgomery County Detention Center since May 20, 1979, and were strip searched absent a reasonable suspicion that they possessed either weapons or contraband. The term temporary detainee is defined to include all persons arrested and held for 24 hours or less.\"  Judge Young also ordered the defendants to produce a written statement to the Court for each temporary detainee arrested for a minor offense for which they believed that they had individualized grounds for a reasonable belief that the detainee was concealing weapons or contraband. The Court also entered an award of nominal damages in the amount of $200 for all members of the class whose Fourth Amendment rights were violated.  Plaintiffs were awarded reasonable attorney's fees.   Smith v. Montgomery County, 643 F.Supp. 435, 437 (D. Md. 1986).</p><p>The District Court later vacated the award of nominal damages and granted plaintiffs' request for a jury trial on their claims for compensatory and punitive damages by letter to counsel dated January 27, 1987.  The Court also directed the parties to finalize the class membership lists.  After the lists were finalized, both sides sought to modify the class definition, but the Court refused.  Smith v. Montgomery County, Md., 117 F.R.D. 372 (D. Md. 1987).</p><p>We have no further information and do not know the ultimate disposition of the case.</p><p></p>",

Maryland.\nApril 30, 1985.\nRobert H. Symonds, Lanham, Md., Clausen Ely, Jr., Ellen J. Flannery, Arthur B. Spitzer and Elizabeth Symonds,\nWashington, D.C., for plaintiffs.\nCarole A. Jeffries, Suzanne Levin, Silver Spring, Md., Robert G. Tobin and Jennifer Evans, Rockville, Md., for\ndefendants.\nMEMORANDUM\nJOSEPH H. YOUNG, District Judge.\nI. BACKGROUND\n1304 This case involves the constitutionality of the policy of conducting indiscriminate *1304 strip searches, with or\nwithout probable cause, of all persons detained at the Montgomery County, Maryland Detention Center. The\nplaintiff, Vivian Smith, originally brought this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of herself and\npurportedly as a representative of two classes of similarly situated persons alleging that the County Detention\nCenter's policy of across the board strip searches violates the Fourth Amendment. Plaintiff and the class she\n[1]\ncurrently represents  initially sought declaratory and injunctive relief and damages against defendants Paul\nMcGuckian, County Attorney for Montgomery County; Charles Gilchrist, County Executive of Montgomery\nCounty; Gary Blake, Director of the Department of Correction and Rehabilitation of Montgomery County, Denise\nDodson, a guard at the Center who conducted a strip search of the plaintiff; and Montgomery County. All\nindividual defendants are being sued in both their individual and official capacities.\nThis case initially was assigned to Judge Jones, formerly of this District. In a Memorandum and Order dated\nSeptember 17, 1982, Judge Jones summarized the relevant facts as follows:\n[2]\nVivian Smith was arrested  at her home at about 10:00 p.m. on November 12, 1981 for contempt\nof court, in failing to appear in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on October 28, 1981 in\n[3]\nconnection with a child support action originating in Essex County, New Jersey.  She was taken\nto the Rockville District police station, where she was photographed and an arrest report was filed.\nShe was then taken, at about 11:40 p.m., to the Montgomery County Detention Center (MCDC),\nwhere she remained overnight. The next day she was transported to the Circuit Court for\nMontgomery County and, after some delay, appeared before a judge, who dismissed the charge\nagainst her.\nUpon arriving at the detention center, plaintiff was taken to the women's receiving and discharge\narea, an open room approximately 15 feet by 20 feet containing a shower, desk, and one cell\nnormally used as a holding cell. She was ordered to, and did, remove all her clothing. She then\nhad to move her arms, open her mouth, bend over and squat, while a female correctional officer\nconducted a visual inspection of her body, including her oral, vaginal and anal cavities. This\nsearch took place in the presence of another female detainee, who was in the cell in the room. No\n\nweapon or contraband was found. Ms. Smith then showered and was placed in the holding cell\nwith the other female detainee overnight.\nSmith v. Montgomery County, 547 F.Supp. 592, 593-94 (D.Md.1982) (Jones, J., hereinafter \"Smith I\").\nIn the same Memorandum and Order, Judge Jones granted plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction which\nstated:\nThat defendants are enjoined during the pendency of this litigation, from permitting, promulgating\n1305 a policy permitting, *1305 and enforcing the present policy permitting, a visual strip search of a\ntemporary detainee at the Montgomery County Detention Center, as defined herein, except upon\nprobable cause to believe such detainee has weapons or contraband concealed on his or her\nperson. Defendants are likewise enjoined from permitting, promulgating a policy permitting, and\nenforcing the present policy to the extent that it permits the conducting of visual searches other\nthan in private.\nSmith I, 547 F.Supp. at 599.\nThereafter, plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that the Center's strip\nsearch policy is unconstitutional and an order permanently enjoining defendants from strip searching short-term\ndetainees absent probable cause to believe that they are concealing weapons or contraband and from strip\nsearching short-term detainees other than in private. This motion for partial summary judgment was denied by\nthis Court in a subsequent Memorandum Opinion and Order, Smith v. Montgomery County, 573 F.Supp. 604, 614\n(D.Md.1983) (Young, J.) (hereinafter \"Smith II\"), because the plaintiff lacked standing to receive either\ndeclaratory, id., at 607-609 (citing Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 89 S.Ct. 956, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969), or\ninjunctive relief. Smith II, 573 F.Supp. 607-609 (citing Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1665,\n75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976); O'Shea v. Littleton,\n414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974)). Accordingly, this Court dissolved the preliminary injunction\nagainst the defendants and declared plaintiff's motion for compliance with the preliminary injunction moot. Smith\nII, 573 F.Supp. at 609.\nWhile this Court refused to grant plaintiffs permanent injunctive relief, it did, nonetheless, concur with Judge\n[4]\nJones' determination that Logan v. Shealy,  660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981), is controlling on the merits of this\ncase and consequently that the strip search policy at the Montgomery County Detention Center is\nunconstitutional. Smith II, 573 F.Supp. at 609-10. The Court noted, in certain terms, that:\n[when] squarely faced with the issue of the constitutionality of the Center's indiscriminate strip\nsearch policy and failure to conduct strip searches in private ..., the Court holds that, based on \nLogan, the Center's indiscriminate strip search policy and failure to conduct strip searches in\nprivate is unconstitutional.\n[5]\nDefendants subsequently have moved, pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  for this\nCourt to reconsider its determination that the Montgomery County Detention Center's across the board strip\nsearch policy is unconstitutional in light of Hudson v. Palmer, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393\n(1984) and Block v. Rutherford, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984), two recently decided\n1306 Supreme Court cases. Defendants also seek summary judgment in *1306 their favor and an award of costs\nbased on Hudson. However, the Court finds that Hudson does not require the reversal or modification of its prior\nholding that the detention center's strip search policy is unconstitutional and, thus, defendants' request for relief\nfrom this holding and summary judgment in their favor will be denied.\nII. DISCUSSION\nDefendants contend specifically that this Court's prior holding is erroneous because \"[i]n two recent cases, the\nSupreme Court of the United States examined the parameters of the Fourth Amendment rights of persons\n[6]\nincarcerated in the nation's prisons and held that none exist.\"  In the Court's view, this is neither a correct\n\ncharacterization of the Supreme Court's recent decisions nor is it a correct statement of prior Fourth Amendment\nlaw.\nA.\nIn Hudson, the Supreme Court dealt directly with the question of whether a \"shakedown\" search of an inmate's\ncell violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court held that\nit did not and \"that the Fourth Amendment has no applicability to a prison cell.\" 104 S.Ct. at 3205 (emphasis\nadded). This holding comports with the Supreme Court's prior indication that a prisoner may not have had a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in his cell, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 556-57, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1883-84, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979), but it does not follow therefrom that the prisoner is unprotected from unreasonable invasions\n[7]\nof his or her personal privacy.  In Wolfish, the Supreme Court expressly permitted irregular and unannounced\nshakedown searches. The Court acknowledged the plausibility of the argument that \"a person confined in a\ndetention facility has no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to his room or cell ...\" 441 U.S. at 556-57,\n99 S.Ct. at 1883 (emphasis added). Clearly, this proposition recognized by the Court in Wolfish and the holding in\nHudson applies to the search of a prisoner's papers, effects, and property located in the cell and not to the most\nintimate searches of the inmate's person. Id.; see Hudson, 104 S.Ct. at 3200-3201 and n. 8; 104 S.Ct. at 3216 n.\n31 (Stevens, J., dissenting opinion joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackman, JJ.). Hudson does not evicerate\nthe requirement articulated by the Supreme Court in Wolfish that personal body searches of inmates be\nreasonable under the circumstances and therefore provides no basis for defendants' conclusion that the Fourth\nAmendment is ineffective in preventing unreasonable searches of a prisoner's person. Id.104 S.Ct. at 3216 n. 31\n.\nAlthough the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment protections do not extend to a prisoner's property,\nit did not hold that prisoners have no constitutional rights. The Court explicitly acknowledged that prisoners retain\na variety of express rights guaranteed under the Constitution, including the right of due process, Hudson, 104\nS.Ct. at 3198 (citing Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2974, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)) and the\n1307 Eighth Amendment guarantee that they not be subject to \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" *1307104 S.Ct. at\n3198. More significantly, the Court also reaffirmed the principles it announced in Wolfish where, inter alia, it\napplied a balancing test to determine whether strip searches of inmates and pre-trial detainees were\n[8]\nunreasonable in light of the circumstances and therefore violative of the Fourth Amendment.  Thus, defendants\n[9]\nhave incorrectly characterized Hudson as holding that inmates and pre-trial detainees  00 or temporary\n97\ndetainees as in this case 00 retain no Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable strip and body cavity\n97\nsearches.\nB.\nDefendants have similarly misconstrued Block v. Rutherford, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438\n(1984). In Block, the Supreme Court, consistent with its holdings in Hudson and Wolfish, upheld the Los Angeles\nCounty Jail practice of conducting random, irregular \"shakedown\" searches of cells. The Court found that this\npractice did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. 104 S.Ct. at 3229. Moreover, Block did not overrule the\nbalancing test applied or the reasonableness requirement announced in Wolfish. The Court in Block simply did\nnot engage in a Fourth Amendment analysis because plaintiffs' claim of a right to observe from a distance\nshakedown searches of their cells was brought under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See\n104 S.Ct. at 3235. In the instant case, plaintiffs' claim of unconstitutional strip searches must be analyzed under\nthe Fourth Amendment balancing test of Wolfish. Finally, the Supreme Court noted with some emphasis in Block\nthat the detainees involved there had been denied bail pending trial and therefore would not be released before\n[10]\ntrial. See id.104 S.Ct. at 3228, 3221, 3222. In contrast, the instant case involves \"temporary detainees\" who\nare held at the Montgomery County Detention Center for 24 hours or less, during which time they will have an\n[11]\nopportunity to post bail, and, if not released beforehand will have their first appearance before a judge.\n\nConsequently, neither Hudson or Block provide any basis for setting aside this Court's prior decision that the\nMontgomery County Detention Center's policy of conducting indiscriminate and nonprivate strip searches is\nunconstitutional. Instead, these recent decisions reaffirm the principles of Wolfish which were construed and\napplied by the Fourth Circuit in Logan, 660 F.2d at 1107, 1013 and followed by this Court in both Smith I, 547\nF.Supp. at 598 and Smith II, 573 F.Supp. at 609-610. Thus, the Fourth Circuit's use of the balancing test\nprescribed by the Supreme Court in reaching its determination that an indiscriminate strip search policy applied to\n1308 temporary detainees is unconstitutional, *1308Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013,[12] remains good law[13] and controls\nthe resolution of the instant case.\nFinally, defendants contend that the county detention center's policy of conducting across the board strip\nsearches of all detainees is constitutional because temporary detainees are intermingled with the general\npopulation of convicted inmates and pre-trial detainees and because information from other jurisdictions indicates\nthat such searches have revealed weapons and contraband. Nonetheless, the Court finds that in light of the\nrecord now before it, these contentions do not justify the center's indiscriminate strip search policy and this policy\nis, therefore, unconstitutional. See Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013.\nAn indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied to detainees such as the named plaintiff here and all other\ndetainees \"cannot be constitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to security\nconsiderations.\" Id. (citing Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 490-91 (E.D.Wisc.1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th\nCir.1980)). In determining whether such policies are reasonable in light of the significant governmental interest in\nmaintaining security and order within a correctional facility or detention center, courts must remain mindful that\nsuch considerations are primarily within the province and professional expertise of corrections officials. Cf. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 554-55, 99 S.Ct. at 1882-83; Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, 433 U.S. 119,\n97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 827, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2806, 41 L.Ed.2d 495\n(1974) (these cases deal with an assessment of the reasonableness of various institutional policies and\nrestrictions under the due process clause). However, where there is substantial evidence in the record which\nindicates that officials have exaggerated their response to legitimate institutional concerns, courts need not defer\nto their judgment. See Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 540-541 n. 23, 99 S.Ct. at 1874-1875 n. 23 (quoting Pell, 417 U.S. at\n827, 94 S.Ct. at 2806).\nAs the record in this case sufficiently demonstrates, newly arrived detainees, both male and female, are housed\n[14]\nin areas that are physically separate from the housing areas for the general population.  Although the existing\n1309 administrative practice in the women's section of the Montgomery *1309 County facility is such that a temporary\ndetainee may have some limited access to the general population during meals or early morning hours before the\ntemporary detainee is taken to court, this access may easily be eliminated by leaving the temporary detainees in\ntheir cells. See Dodson Deposition, pp. 77-78. Moreover, the fact that weapons or contraband might sometimes\nbe found during strip searches of pre-trial detainees or convicted inmates does not justify an indiscriminate strip\nsearch policy that includes strip searches of temporary detainees. Indeed, other local jurisdictions have\nsuccessfully implemented policies which prohibit strip searches of temporary detainees in the absence of\n[15]\nprobable cause.\nThese considerations inevitably lead this Court to conclude that, like Logan, the indiscriminate strip searches of\ntemporary detainees bear no reasonable relationship to security needs at the detention facility that, when\nbalanced against the \"ultimate invasion of personal rights involved,\" would justify it. Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013.\nAdditionally, the recent decisions of the Supreme Court in Hudson and Block do not vitiate the Fourth\nAmendment analysis utilized by the Court of Appeals in Logan nor do they demand reversal of this Court's prior\ndetermination in this matter.\n[1] Plaintiff's motion for class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) for injunctive relief eventually was denied by this\nCourt in an Opinion and Order dated October 23, 1983. Smith v. Montgomery County, 573 F.Supp. 604, 615\n(D.Md. 1983) (Young, D.J.). However, a class for damages was certified under Rule 23(b)(3) and was defined to\ninclude: \n\nAll persons who were \"temporary detainees\" at the Montgomery County Detention Center since May 20, 1979\n(the date the strip search policy became effective), and were strip searched absent probable cause to believe\nthat they possessed either weapons or contraband. The term \"temporary detainees\" is defined to include all\npersons arrested and held for 24 hours or less.\nId. (parenthetical added).\n[2] Ms. Smith was taken into custody by two officers of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department on a civil\nbody attachment issued to answer a contempt charge. Affidavit of James A. Young, Sheriff, ¶ 7 and Attachment\nA-2. She was arrested and booked on a charge of contempt. Affidavit of James A. Young, Sheriff, ¶ 10 and\nAttachment A-3. Smith v. Montgomery County, 547 F.Supp. 592, 593 n. 3 (D.Md.1982) (Jones, J.).\n[3] Smith had failed to appear because she believed, correctly as things eventually turned out, that the\nproceeding had been dismissed in New Jersey. Smith, 547 F.Supp. at 593 n. 4.\n[4] In Logan, a DWI arrestee sought damages and injunctive and declaratory relief for having been strip searched\nat the Arlington County, Virginia Detention Center pursuant to a policy which required that all persons being held\nat the center be strip searched for weapons or contraband regardless of the offense, the circumstances or\nprobable duration of their detention. Logan, 660 F.2d at 1010. The Fourth Circuit held that this strip search policy\npromulgated by the Sheriff's Department was unconstitutional under the standards enunciated by the Supreme\nCourt in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), and that the plaintiff's strip search\n\"bore no discernable relationship to security needs at the Detention Center that, when balanced against the\nultimate invasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably [be] thought justified.\" 660 F.2d at 1013.\n[5] Defendants have based their motion for reconsideration on Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nHowever, Rule 60(b) applies only to a final judgment or order, see Rule 60(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. (relief \"from a final\njudgment, order, or proceeding\"); Advisory Committee Notes, 1946 Amendment, and the Fourth Circuit has\nalready determined that this Court's decision was an interlocutory order. Smith v. Montgomery County, 740 F.2d\n963 (4th Cir. 1984). Nonetheless, the Court will exercise it's inherent power to reconsider it's prior interlocutory\nruling and will resolve defendants' motion on it's merits.\n[6] Defendant's Memorandum at 1.\n[7] Indeed, defendants' argument to the contrary proves too much, and if applied vigorously could have so\nundiscriminating an appetite for justifying the exercise of excessive and intrusive executive and police power and\nauthority, that it could readily consume well established notions of privacy in Anglo-American law. There are many\nplaces in which an individual may not enjoy a legitimate expectation of privacy and where his property may not be\ninsulated from search and seizure, see, e.g., United States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83, 95, 100 S.Ct. 2547, 2554, 65\nL.Ed.2d 619 (1979) (case remanded to determine if defendant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in\napartment belonging to his mother); Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 149, 99 S.Ct. 421, 433, 58 L.Ed.2d 387\n(1978) (passenger had no legitimate expectation of privacy in car driven by owner). However, it does not follow\ntherefrom that an individual's mere presence in these areas suspends Fourth Amendment protections entirely\nand subjects them to unreasonable searches of their physical person without constitutional recourse.\n[8] In Wolfish, the Court reasoned that: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical\napplication. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of\npersonal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in\nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. [citations omitted].\n441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\n[9] The plaintiff in Hudson was a convicted prisoner at a state prison and not a pre-trial or temporary detainee.\n[10] Defendants contend that all arrestees taken to the Montgomery County Detention Center are \"pre-trial\ndetainees\" in that they are \"committed to the detention facility only because no less drastic means can\n\nreasonably assure [their] presence at trial.\" Defendants' Memorandum, at 8 (quoting Wolfish); but see Plaintiff's\nMemorandum at 6-7 (\"temporary detainees\" are distinguishable from pre-trial detainees in that they have not yet\nhad a full opportunity to post bond and secure their release, and there has been no determination by a judge that\nthey must be committed to the detention center pending trial).\n[11] Many persons taken to the county detention facility were released within a few hours of their arrival but were\nnonetheless subjected to an intrusive strip search. Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to\nReconsider (\"Plaintiffs' Memo.\") at 4 n. 4. (citing as example the deposition of defendant Gary Blake,\nMontgomery County Director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation).\n[12] In applying its dispositive Fourth Amendment analysis, the Logan court noted specifically that the strip search\nof the plaintiff, who like the named plaintiff here was a temporary detainee, had no \"discernable relationship to\nsecurity needs at the Detention Center that, when balanced against the ultimate invasion of personal rights\ninvolved, ... [could justify it].\" 660 F.2d at 1013.\n[13] In addition to the recent Supreme Court decisions in Hudson and Block which this Court views as having\nsubstantiated the validity of the Fourth Amendment analysis employed by the Fourth Circuit in Logan, there is\nfurther indication that Logan was correctly decided. This Court noted in Smith II that; \nJustice Rehnquist in his capacity as Circuit Justice, in staying the Fourth Circuit's mandate in Logan stated that \nLogan was incorrectly decided. Clements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1304 [102 S.Ct. 284, 70 L.Ed.2d 461] (1981).\nHowever, the alacrity with which the full Supreme Court vacated the stay entered by Justice Rehnquist is strong\nindication that the full Court believes that Logan was correctly decided. Clements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1117 [102\nS.Ct. 961, 71 L.Ed.2d 105] (1981) (stay vacated two days after it was imposed).\nSmith II, 573 F.Supp. at 610 n. 5.\n[14] Newly arrived female detainees are held in one of three intake cells designated for that purpose. Plaintiff's\nMemorandum at 7; Stipulation of Facts ¶ 20. These three intake cells are on one side of a hall in the intake area\nand are separated from other cells used to house pre-trial detainees and sentenced inmates by a locked gate\nand sally port. Plaintiffs' Memorandum at 8; see deposition of defendant Denise Dodson, pp. 75-83. Thus, cells\nused to house newly arrived detainees are physically separate from those set aside for pre-trial detainees and\nsentenced inmates. Additionally, this cell block area is physically separate from the dormitory area that houses\npre-trial detainees and sentenced inmates. Plaintiffs' Memorandum at 8. Newly arriving male detainees are held\nin an \"intake section\" that is far removed from the cell blocks that house the general jail population. Stipulation of\nFacts ¶ 20. Both male and female temporary detainees may also be held in holding cells which are themselves\nseparate from the general intake section itself. Plaintiffs' Memorandum at 8.\n[15] Most recently strip searches of temporary detainees have been prohibited by court order and local ordinance\nin Prince George's County. Alexander v. Prince George's County, Law No. 95, 517 (Prince George's County\nCir.Ct. Jan. 26, 1983). The District of Columbia has also entered into a judicially supervised agreement which\nbars strip searches of temporary detainees except upon probable cause. Morgan v. Barry, Civ. No. 81-1419 (D.C.\nJuly 22, 1981); and Arlington County, Virginia, whose strip search policy was held to be unconstitutional in Logan,\nhas limited strip searches to those instances where there is probable cause.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Maryland.\nSeptember 8, 1986.\n436 *436 Robert H. Symonds, Lanham, Md., Clausen Ely, Jr., Ellen J. Flannery, Arthur B. Spitzer, Elizabeth Symonds,\nWashington, D.C., and Edward L. Genn, Rockville, Md., for plaintiffs.\nCarole A. Jeffries, Silver Spring, Md., and Robert G. Tobin, Rockville, Md., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM\nJOSEPH H. YOUNG, District Judge.\nOn November 12, 1981, at approximately 10:00 p.m., two officers of the Montgomery County Sheriff's\nDepartment arrested plaintiff Vivian Smith at her home for failing to appear before the Circuit Court for\nMontgomery County in a child support action. The officers took Smith to the Rockville District police station, and\nthen to the Montgomery County Detention Center (\"MCDC\"). Upon Smith's arrival at MCDC, a female\ncorrectional officer took Smith into a holding cell, where in the presence of another female inmate, the officer\nordered Smith to remove her clothing, which was searched, and to squat for a visual body cavity (\"vbc\") search.\nMs. Smith then showered and was placed in the holding cell overnight. A magistrate dismissed the charge\nagainst her the next day.\nSmith brought this suit against Montgomery County and several of its officials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming\nthat the Detention Center's policy of strip searching all temporary detainees was unconstitutional. She sought\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and damages for past constitutional violations, both for herself and for persons\nsimilarly situated. In a Memorandum and Order dated September 17, 1982, Judge Jones of this Court found\nMCDC's indiscriminate strip search policy unconstitutional, and issued a preliminary injunction which stated:\nDefendants will be enjoined from permitting, promulgating a policy permitting, or enforcing a policy\npermitting the visual strip search of a temporary detainee ... except upon probable cause to\nbelieve such detainee has weapons or contraband concealed on his or her person and from\npermitting, promulgating a policy permitting or enforcing a policy permitting the conducting of such\nsearches other than in private.\nSmith v. Montgomery County, 547 F.Supp. 592, 599 (D.Md.1982) (Smith I).\nAfter Judge Jones' resignation, this case was re-assigned. In a Memorandum and Order dated October 26, 1983,\nthe Court dissolved the preliminary injunction and denied declaratory relief because plaintiff did not have standing\nto challenge the prospective application of Montgomery County's strip search policy. However, the Court granted\nMs. Smith's motion for certification of a retrospective damages class. The class was defined as:\n437 All persons who were `temporary detainees' at the Montgomery County Detention *437 Center\n(\"MCDC\") since May 20, 1979 [the date Montgomery County adopted the strip search policy], and\nwere strip searched absent probable cause to believe that they possessed either weapons or\ncontraband. The term `temporary detainees' is defined to include all persons arrested and held for\n24 hours or less.\nSmith v. Montgomery County, 573 F.Supp. 604, 611 (D.Md.1983) (Smith II).\n\nThe Fourth Circuit subsequently dismissed defendants' appeal from the Court's October 1983 order for lack of\nappellate jurisdiction. Smith v. Montgomery County, 740 F.2d 963 (4th Cir.1984) (unpublished opinion).\nDefendants moved this Court to reconsider its determination that the strip search policy was unconstitutional, and\nthe Court denied that motion in a Memorandum and Order dated April 30, 1985. Smith v. Montgomery County,\n607 F.Supp. 1303 (D.Md.1985) (Smith III).\nDefendants have obtained addresses through the Motor Vehicle Administrations of Maryland, Virginia, and the\nDistrict of Columbia for persons detained less than 24 hours at MCDC from May 20, 1979 until Judge Jones\nissued the original injunction in this case and mailed notice to these potential class members, giving them the\nopportunity to \"opt in\" to the class. Counsel for the defendants persist in their assertions that the strip search\npolicy is constitutional, and have argued that probable cause existed to strip search every person who has opted\nin to the class. The Court must set some broad guidelines and procedures to determine membership in the class.\nTo begin, Smith II followed Judge Jones' initial determination that the defendants required probable cause to strip\nsearch temporary detainees. See Smith II, 573 F.Supp. at 609, n. 4; Smith I, 547 F.Supp. at 596, n. 9. However,\nin light of the Supreme Court's recent emphasis on deference to jail administrators, see Hudson v. Palmer, 468\nU.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d\n438 (1984), and the unanimous developments in this area in the lower federal courts, this Court will adopt a\nreasonable suspicion standard and redefine the class as follows:\nAll persons who were temporary detainees at the Montgomery County Detention Center since\nMay 20, 1979, and were strip searched absent a reasonable suspicion that they possessed either\nweapons or contraband. The term temporary detainee is defined to include all persons arrested\nand held for 24 hours or less.\nSee Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1885, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); Stewart v.

Snow,\n771 F.2d 556 and cases listed at 565 (1st Cir.1985); but cf. Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 491\n(E.D.Wisc.1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980) (probable cause required to strip search non-misdemeanor\ntraffic offenders).\nArticulating the reasonable suspicion standard is easier than applying it. In the context of this class action lawsuit,\nthe Court must draw bright lines according to the offenses that class members were arrested for, or embroil itself\nin hundreds of individual evidentiary disputes. And bright lines are necessary to guide the future decisions of jail\npersonnel, who cannot be expected to ponder the niceties of Fourth Amendment law every time they admit a\npotentially dangerous inmate into their facilities.\n438 At first blush, categorizing temporary detainees according to the offenses they *438 were arrested for may\nappear philosophically at odds with the presumption of innocence. Recent arrestees have not been convicted of\n[1]\nthe crimes for which they are being held,  and many are housed overnight before a magistrate has had the\nopportunity to determine if probable cause existed for their arrests. But however necessary the presumption of\ninnocence may be in the courtroom to protect defendants from arbitrary government actions, it does not prevent\njail personnel from protecting themselves against violent defendants. Recent arrestees at MCDC are thrown into\na stressful, and often desperate situation; a police officer or a magistrate has previously determined that probable\ncause exists to believe they have already committed one crime.\nIt is no answer, of course, that we deal here with restrictions on pretrial detainees rather than\nconvicted criminals. For, as we observed in Wolfish, in this context, \"[t]here is no basis for\nconcluding that pretrial detainees pose any lesser security risk than convicted inmates.\" 441 U.S.\n\nat 546, n. 28 [99 S.Ct. at 1878 n. 28]. Indeed, we said, \"it may be that in certain circumstances\n[detainees] present a greater risk to jail security and order.\" Ibid.\nBlock v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 3233, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984) (other citations omitted).\nDetermining reasonable suspicion based upon broad categories of criminal charges may also appear at odds\nwith traditional Fourth Amendment jurisprudence requiring individualized suspicion. Of course, individualized\nsuspicion often means that the individual has followed a pattern of behavior characteristic of a broad class of\npersons engaged in similar criminal activity. And a police officer's determination of probable cause to believe that\na detainee has already committed a serious crime is sufficient to raise a reasonable suspicion that the detainee is\nhiding weapons or contraband, especially in light of the government's compelling interest in maintaining safety in\njail security.\nTo determine whether a jail administrator's suspicion and subsequent decision to strip search a temporary\ndetainee was reasonable, the Court must balance the \"intrusion on the [detainee's] Fourth Amendment interest\nagainst [the] promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\" Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct.\n1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). In weighing that balance, the courts have consistently recognized that the\ngeneral threats posed by classes of offenders in the jail context may outweigh an individual detainee's Fourth\nAmendment interests. See Bell v. Wolfish, supra, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884 (\"A detention facility is a\nunique place fraught with serious security dangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband\nis all too common an occurrence.\"); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir.1984),cert. denied,471 U.S.\n1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985) (\"the County has not demonstrated that its security interests\nwarrant the serious invasion of privacy inflicted by its policy\"00 implicitly recognizing class versus individualized\n97\nsuspicion analysis); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir.1983) (same); Jeffries v. Reed,\n439 631 F.Supp. 1212, 1216-17 (E.D.Wash.1986)*439 (Denying constitutional challenge to practice of strip searching\ndeath row inmates every time they left their cells00\"Death row inmates present particular and heightened security\n97\nrisks.\"); Simenc v. Sheriff of DuPage County, Westlaw memo. op. at p. 5, No. 82-C-4778 (N.D.Ill.

See John Does 1-100 v. Boyd, 613 F.Supp. 1514, 1523, n. 13\n(D.Minn.1985) (testimony of one incident where a minor offender on work release had smuggled a gun to a major\noffender in a detention center); Logan v. Shealy, 500 F.Supp. 502, 505 (E.D. Va.1980),rev'd in part,660 F.2d\n1007 (4th Cir.1981),cert. denied,455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982) (\"the Sheriff of Arlington\nCounty adopted the [across the board strip search] policy in 1974-75 (after one of his deputies had been shot by\na misdemeanant who had not been strip searched) ...\").\nOn the other side of the Fourth Amendment balance, strip searches are a particularly strong and offensive dose\nof preventive medicine. Strip searches have been described as \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified,\nhumiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission....\" Tinetti v.\nWittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 491 (E.D. Wisc.1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir. 1980),quoting Sala v. County of\nSuffolk, (E.D.N.Y. 11/28/78) (unpublished opinion). One commentator described them as \"visual rape.\" Shuldiner,\nVisual Rape: A Look at the Dubious Legality of Strip Searches, 13 J.Marsh.L.Rev. 273 (1980). And strip searches\n[2]\noften appear strikingly inappropriate in individual cases.\nIn the end, balancing this serious intrusion against the government's compelling interest in jail security is\nunsusceptible of precise evidentiary resolution, undiscernible in the language of the Constitution or the intent of\nits framers. But the Court has the duty to draw the line somewhere. The Court holds that reasonable suspicion\nexists to strip search all felony arrestees, and all temporary detainees arrested for misdemeanor offenses that\ninvolve weapons or contraband. Reasonable suspicion also exists to strip search all temporary detainees with\nprior records of convictions or unresolved arrests for felony offenses, or for misdemeanors involving weapons or\ncontraband.\n\nOther federal courts appear to have uniformly drawn the line in the same place. The courts have upheld strip\nsearches of detainees arrested on serious charges, or charges involving weapons or contraband. See United\nStates v. Duncan, 586 F.Supp. 1305, 1311 (W.D.Mi.1984),aff'd,763 F.2d 220 (6th Cir.1985) (\"[D]efendant was\narrested by state authorities some time after he had allegedly delivered a quantity of drugs to an undercover\ninformant....

See Mary Beth G.,\nsupra, at 1266, n. 2. (\"[T]he disclosure of the strip search policy of [Chicago] moved the Illinois legislature to\namend the Illinois statute governing `Rights on Arrest' to prohibit strip searches of persons for traffic, regulatory,\nor misdemeanor offenses absent a reasonable belief that the arrestee is concealing weapons or controlled\nsubstances on his or her person. Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, § 103-1(c) (eff. Sept. 2, 1979\")); Hill v. Bogans, supra, at\n393, n. 1 (citing recent Colorado statute banning strip searches of traffic or petty offenders absent reasonable\nbelief that they are concealing weapons or drugs).\nOther courts have held that a detainee's prior record is relevant. See Giles v. Ackerman, supra, 746 F.2d at 617\n(\"Reasonable suspicion may be based on such factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee's appearance\nand conduct, and the prior arrest record\"); Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668, 671 (8th Cir.1982); Weber v. Dell, 630\nF.Supp. 255, 257 (W.D.N.Y.1986); John Does 1-100 v. Boyd, supra, at 1525 (Reasonable suspicion \"could be\nbased on the nature of the offense, the detainee's criminal history, the demeanor of the individual, and the results\nof any other search ... which the defendants may choose to conduct\"); John Does 1-100 v. Ninneman, supra, at\n1071; Simenc v. Sheriff of DuPage County, supra, at 8 (\"Reasonable suspicion to believe that an individual\narrestee may be concealing a weapon or contraband may be based on factors such as appearance and conduct\nof the arrestee, and any prior arrest record\").\nThe Court also believes that drawing the line at felonies and misdemeanor charges associated with weapons or\ncontraband is consistent with the leading Fourth Circuit case in this area, Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th\n443 Cir.1981),cert. denied,455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982). *443 In Logan, the Fourth Circuit\nheld unconstitutional a strip search of a woman arrested for driving while intoxicated, a misdemeanor punishable\nby imprisonment up to six months. The Fourth Circuit wrote at 1013:\nLogan's strip search bore no ... discernible relationship to security needs at the Detention Center\nthat, when balanced against the ultimate invasion of personal rights involved, it could reasonably\nbe thought justified. At no time would Logan or similar detainees be intermingled with the general\njail population; her offense, though not a minor traffic offense, was nevertheless one not\ncommonly associated by its very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband; there was\nno cause in her specific case to believe that she might possess either; and when strip-searched,\nshe had been at the Detention Center for one and one-half hours without even a pat-down search.\nAn indiscriminate strip search policy routinely applied to detainees such as Logan along with all\nother detainees cannot be constitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in\nattending to security considerations.\nLogan's statement about offenses associated \"by [their] very nature with the possession of weapons or\ncontraband\" lends clear support to this Court's decision that reasonable suspicion exists to strip search detainees\narrested for misdemeanors involving weapons or contraband. And while many felonies do not \"by [their] very\nnature involve weapons or contraband,\" the Court does not read that sentence from the Logan opinion as an\nunalterable requirement that would apply to serious offenses as well. Other courts have read the reasoning of \nLogan as limited to minor offenses. See Jones v. Edwards, supra, at 741; Giles v. Ackerman, supra, at 618-19; \nDufrin v. Spreen, supra, at 1087 (\"It is not necessary for us to determine whether Tinetti and Logan were correctly\ndecided,\" distinguishing both cases because they involve minor offenses while Dufrin was arrested for felonious\nassault); Hunt v. Polk County, Iowa, supra, at 343-44 (Difference in results of cases upholding searches and\ncases like Logan holding searches unconstitutional \"is based largely on a difference in the degree of likelihood\nthat the persons to be searched would be concealing contraband.... \"[T]here is little reason to suspect that newly-\narrested traffic violators are concealing contraband or weapons\"); see also descriptions of Stewart, supra; Fann,\nsupra; and John Does 1-100 v. Boyd, supra, at pp. 441-42 above.\nAccordingly, the Court will leave it to the parties to determine which members of the class of temporary detainees\nwere strip searched in violation of their Fourth Amendment rights under the terms of the Court's ruling. If\ndefendants believe that they had individualized grounds for a reasonable belief that a detainee arrested for a\nminor offense was concealing weapons or contraband, the defendants shall submit a written statement of those\n\nindividualized reasons to the Court. If any of those statements of reasonable suspicion create issues of fact, brief\nevidentiary hearings may be necessary.\nFor all members of the class whose Fourth Amendment rights were violated, the Court will enter an award of\nnominal damages in the amount of $200. The Court believes that its ruling will deter defendants from future\nviolations, and thus fully vindicate the interests of the class. See Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668, 677 (8th\nCir.1982); John Does 1-100 v. Boyd, supra, at 1531; John Does 1-100 v. Ninneman at 1072; Safley v. Turner, 586\nF.Supp. 589, 597 (W.D.Mo.1984).\nAs the prevailing party and representative of the class in this civil rights suit, plaintiff is entitled to an award of\nreasonable attorney's fees.\n[1] Some members of the class of temporary detainees have been convicted. They are housed in the\nMontgomery County Detention Center pending court appearances, or are in transit between other jail facilities.\nStrip searching those members of the class is justified because of their contacts with the outside world, see Bell\nv. Wolfish, supra, 441 U.S. at 558-60, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85; Simenc v. Sheriff of DuPage County, No. 82-C-4778\n(N.D.Ill.1985) Westlaw memo. op. at 5, and the need to deter planned smuggling of weapons and contraband\nduring outside contacts. Wolfish, supra, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884; cf. Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago,\n723 F.2d 1263, 1272 n. 8 (7th Cir.1983); John Does 1-100 v. Boyd, 613 F.Supp. 1514, 1523 n. 13 (D.Minn.1985); \nJohn Does 1-100 v. Ninneman, 612 F.Supp. 1069, 1071 (D.Minn.1985); Hunt v. Polk County, Iowa, 551 F.Supp.\n339, 344 (S.D. Iowa 1982) (all holding that strip searches of detainees recently arrested on minor charges were\nunconstitutional, partly because arrests are unforeseen events and it would be unlikely for arrestees to plan to\nsmuggle contraband; contra Weber v. Dell, 630 F.Supp. 255, 261 (W.D. N.Y.1986).\n[2] It is troubling to consider how much of our visceral reactions to strip searches, pro and con, may rest upon\nperceptions of class and sex. See Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1088 (6th Cir. 1983): \"In directing a verdict for\nDufrin, the trial judge observed that he did not like the idea of police routing `middle-class housewives' out of their\nbeds' at 11:30 at night' and forcing those housewives to submit to strip-searches.... We cannot believe from these\ncomments that the trial court was implying that a different rule ought to exist for a female who was not middle-\nclass, or who was not a housewife, or who was not from the suburbs. Any suggestion [otherwise] is in our view\nneither legally nor morally supportable.\"\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Maryland.\nSeptember 13, 1982.\n593 *593 Clausen Ely, Jr., Donna M. Murasky, Ellen J. Flannery, Covington & Burling, Washington, D.C., Robert H.\nSymonds, Lanham, Md., for plaintiff; Arthur B. Spitzer, Elizabeth Symonds, American Civil Liberties Union Fund of\nthe Nat. Capital Area, Washington, D.C., Edward L. Genn, Rockville, Md., of counsel.\nRobert G. Tobin, Jr. Deputy County Atty., Suzanne Levin, Carole A. Jeffries, Jennifer Evans, Asst. County Attys.,\nRockville, Md., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nSHIRLEY B. JONES, District Judge.\n[1]\nVivian Anderson Smith brought this action against Montgomery County and several individual defendants,  on\nbehalf of herself and similarly situated persons, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. She\n[2]\nchallenges the practice of performing nonprivate, visual strip searches on persons detained temporarily  at the\nMontgomery County Detention Center, absent probable cause to believe these detainees possess weapons or\ncontraband. She does not challenge the county's right to perform a less intrusive search of all persons detained\nat the center, nor does she challenge its right to perform a visual strip search when there is probable cause to\nbelieve a temporary detainee has concealed a weapon or contraband on his or her person. She does, however,\nseek to have even visual strip searches based on probable cause performed in private.\nPlaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction, asking that temporary detainees not be subjected to visual strip\nsearch except upon probable cause and that such searches be conducted in private. Memoranda, affidavits, and\na stipulation of facts were filed, and testimony was taken and oral argument was heard on July 13, 1982.\nAlthough there is little factual dispute on the issues material to the motion, this opinion constitutes my findings of\nfact and conclusions of law.\nThe Search of Vivian Anderson Smith\n[3]\nVivian Smith was arrested  at her home at about 10:00 p. m. on November 12, 1981 for contempt of court, in\nfailing to appear in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on October 28, 1981 in connection with a child\n594 support action originating in Essex County, New Jersey.[4] She was taken to the *594 Rockville District police\nstation, where she was photographed and an arrest report was filed. She was then taken, at about 11:40 p. m., to\nthe Montgomery County Detention Center (MCDC), where she remained overnight. The next day she was\ntransported to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and, after some delay, appeared before a judge, who\ndismissed the charge against her.\nUpon arrival at the detention center, plaintiff was taken to the women's receiving and discharge area, an open\nroom approximately 15 feet by 20 feet containing a shower, desk and one cell normally used as a holding cell.\nShe was ordered to, and did, remove all her clothing. She then had to move her arms, open her mouth, bend\nover and squat, while a female correctional officer conducted a visual inspection of her body, including her oral,\nvaginal and anal cavities. This search took place in the presence of another female detainee, who was in the cell\n\nin the room. No weapon or contraband was found. Ms. Smith then showered and was placed in the holding cell\nwith the other female detainee overnight.\nThe Detention Center and the Strip Search Policy\n[5]\nAll persons  held or detained in the MCDC undergo the same preliminary procedures. They are made to\nremove their clothing, which is checked for weapons and contraband, and their body cavities 00 mouth, nose,\n97\nears, anus, and genital area 00 are visually inspected. Areas such as the soles of the feet, armpits and hair are\n97\nalso inspected. The guard performing the search does not normally touch the detainee in the inspection.\nAccording to Gary Blake, Montgomery County Director of Correction and Rehabilitation, strip searches are\nnormally performed in private, although the MCDC written policy does not state that they must or should be. If\nthere is insufficient space in other women's areas, a female detainee may be housed in the holding cell in the\nwomen's reception area. Screens are available to give some privacy, but Blake conceded that they may not\nalways be used and agreed that it would probably be a good idea to state the privacy requirement in the MCDC\nwritten policy.\nThe strip search is part of initial proceeding of all MCDC detainees, temporary or permanent. All are taken first to\na receiving area. In the case of females, this is the receiving room previously described. After processing, newly\narrived females who have not yet appeared before a judge are placed in one of three individual cells in the\nwomen's wing used for this purpose. Stipulation ¶ 20. After a short period in this area, they are assigned to the\ndormitory area of the women's wing or to an individual cell. Normally, females are assigned to the dormitory area.\nMen proceed first to a receiving area, where new arrivals are processed and searched, then to an intake\ndormitory area containing 20 beds, where they usually remain for 24 to 72 hours until they are classified for\nplacement in the general population. They are then assigned to a cell-block.\nThe MCDC houses convicted offenders sentenced to less than 18 months' imprisonment, see Md.Ann.Code art.\n595 27, § 605 (1982), convicted offenders awaiting sentence, pretrial detainees[6] and temporary *595 detainees\n[7]\nsuch as plaintiff.  The strip search policy applies to all detainees, regardless of whether there is probable cause\nto believe they may be concealing weapons or contraband, regardless of where they are housed and regardless\nof whether they are being held overnight pending a court appearance the next day or for a longer period.\nLegal Discussion\nDefendants contended at oral argument that plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief is moot. Smith was subjected to\nthe strip search policy once and, except in the unlikely event she might again be a temporary detainee at MCDC,\nwill not be subjected to it again. Her claim for damages has not been mooted, however, and the claim for\ninjunctive relief presents an archetypical situation for application of the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\"\ndoctrine. See, e.g., Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 526 n.5, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1867 n.5, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). The\npolicy continues to be applied to temporary detainees, however, and it is impossible for the policy to be applied\ncontinuously to any individual temporary detainee, who is by definition only in the MCDC for a very short period of\ntime and perhaps only subjected to strip search once. Class relief has been requested, but this Court has not yet\nhad the opportunity to rule on the class certification motion. There is certainly an Article III case or controversy\nbetween the class members and the defendants who are continuing to apply the strip search policy.\nInjunctive relief concerning a general policy is not barred because a class action is not certified. Evans v. Harnett\nCounty Bd. of Education, 684 F.2d 304, 306 (4th Cir. 1982); Sandford v. R.L. Coleman Realty Co., 573 F.2d 173,\n178 (4th Cir. 1978). Preliminary injunctive relief has been granted in sufficiently compelling cases. Henry v.\nGreenville Airport Comm'n, 284 F.2d 631, 633 (4th Cir. 1960) (per curiam); see Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486,\n488 (E.D.Wis. 1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir. 1980) (per curiam).\nThe customary standard for deciding whether to issue preliminary injunctive relief is a balancing of hardships test,\ninvolving four factors: (1) the likelihood of irreparable harm to plaintiff without the injunction, (2) the likelihood of\n\nharm to defendant with the injunction, (3) plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits and (4) the public interest. \nBlackwelder Furniture Co. v. Seilig Mfg. Co., 550 F.2d 189 (4th Cir. 1977). The first step in analyzing the factors is\nto weigh the respective harm to the parties. Telvest, Inc. v. Bradshaw, 618 F.2d 1029, 1032-33 (4th Cir. 1980). If\nthe potential harm to plaintiff greatly outweighs the harm to the defendant, plaintiff need not show a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits, only a serious question. Wetzel v. Edwards, 635 F.2d 283, 287 (4th Cir. 1980); Telvest,\n618 F.2d at 1032-33. As the harm to the plaintiff, compared with that to defendant decreases, the likelihood of\nsuccess becomes increasingly important. Id. at 1033.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has held that a district court \"has no discretion to deny\nrelief by preliminary injunction to a person who clearly establishes by undisputed evidence that he is being denied\na constitutional right.\" Henry v. Greenville Airport Comm'n, 284 F.2d 631, 633 (4th Cir. 1960) (per curiam). Henry\nwas a black civilian employee of the Air Force who was required to sit in a segregated waiting area in the\n596 Greenville, South Carolina airport. He *596 had sued on behalf of himself and similarly situated persons to enjoin\nthe practice. The trial court denied a preliminary injunction on the grounds that plaintiff had failed to show\nirreparable harm to himself and that the injunction would change the status quo. The Fourth Circuit reversed.\nHenry is not inconsistent with later Fourth Circuit cases analyzing the standards for granting injunctive relief. \nHenry may simply represent the end of the balance that the Court described in Telvest, when it said that as the\nlikelihood of harm to the plaintiff decreases, the likelihood of success becomes increasingly important. Denial of a\nconstitutional right continued, and Henry had demonstrated certainty of success.\nAlthough Smith herself will presumably suffer no further harm from the strip search policy, other plaintiffs whom\nshe seeks to represent will be harmed as it continues in the future. Violation of constitutional rights may constitute\nsufficient irreparable harm to justify preliminary relief. Cf. Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74, 96 S.Ct. 2673,\n2689-90, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976) (loss of First Amendment rights constitutes irreparable harm). Once rights are\nviolated by the strip search, later injunctive relief cannot restore them.\nThe harm from enjoining the strip search policy differs with respect to the two aspects of the policy challenged,\nthe privacy and the probable cause issues. The defendants have advanced no reasons why performing the\nsearches in private will be harmful; indeed, they claim that is the normal practice. The searches of both males\nand females are performed in rooms separate from the area where others are held. Only the women's receiving\narea has a holding cell in which another detainee might sometimes be present, and there are screens available to\nuse if that is the case. Blake testified that the searches are supposed to be private, although he conceded that\nthere may be occasional lapses. No harm of any kind will result if the strip searches are required to be done in\nprivate.\nThe harm relating to the second aspect of the policy challenged requires more discussion. The strip search policy\nis designed generally to prevent weapons and contraband from entering the MCDC. With respect to a weapon,\nthe purpose is to prevent a detainee from injuring himself, another inmate or a correctional officer and to prevent\nhim from giving a weapon to another inmate who might do the same. Similarly, a purpose of the policy is to\nprevent a detainee from using contraband or giving it to another to use. The question raised at this point,\nhowever, is what harm will occur if the MCDC must change its policy so as to require probable cause for\nperforming strip searches on temporary detainees only. The narrowness of that question must be emphasized.\nApplication of the current policy to those other than temporary detainees is not at issue. In addition, there is no\nquestion of not searching temporary detainees at all, nor are strip searches of temporary detainees precluded in\nall cases. The issue is simply what harm is caused at the present time if MCDC is required to adopt other means\n[8]\nof searching temporary detainees in the first instance,  conducting a strip search only if there is probable cause\n597 [9] to *597 believe that a temporary detainee has concealed a weapon or contraband on his person.\nThe county has pointed to the relative ineffectiveness of other search methods, compared with the present\nprocedure, the difficulty of application of an individualized standard of probable cause, and the fact that all\n[10]\ntemporary detainees have contact with the institution's \"general population.\"  Little evidence was presented on\nhow effective other methods of search, including a search of clothing, a patdown search, and use of metal\ndetectors, may be, as compared with the present policy. It may perhaps be conceded that these methods would\nnot reveal small non-metal items concealed on the person, for example, in body cavities. How often such items\n\nhave been found in these locations, particularly on temporary detainees, was not indicated. Blake testified in\ngeneral terms that quite a few prohibited items have been found, but he conceded that a thorough patdown\nsearch would probably have found most of the items. The visual strip search was justified as a faster, surer\nmethod of search.\nAlthough Blake testified that new detainees were placed in the general population, it was stipulated that new\nfemale detainees who have not yet appeared before a judicial officer are, as a matter of general practice, held in\none of three cells in the women's wing designated for that purpose. As plaintiff's case illustrates, apparently they\nmay also be kept in the holding cell in the reception room. Each cell is a separate, enclosed unit. The cells in the\nwomen's cellblock area, including the three normally used for new arrivals who have not appeared before a\njudicial officer, are customarily locked only from 11:00 p. m. to 6:00 a. m., so that detainees and inmates have\naccess to each other and a cellblock day area at other times. A temporary detainee in one of the three \"intake\"\ncells does have access to other temporary detainees and possibly to some non-temporary inmates, if the present\npractice of leaving the cells open during the daytime continues.\nNewly arrived males, including temporary detainees, are placed in a dormitory intake section of the men's area of\nthe center. Even inmates serving short sentences are apparently kept there for a short period of time until they\nare classified for placement. A male temporary detainee thus has access to all detainees in the dormitory area.\nThe men's intake area has a 20-bed capacity, although it was not developed at the hearing how many men are\nnormally in the area at any particular time.\nIt must be noted, in considering the issue of access to the general population, that the detainees who are serving\nshort sentences and the detainees who have appeared before a judicial officer and are unable to secure pretrial\nrelease may be strip-searched themselves, so that the danger inherent in the comingling of the temporary\ndetainees with them is that a temporary detainee may be able to smuggle in an item that has eluded search\nmethods less stringent than a visual strip search, either to use on a person in the general population or to give to\none. The facts presented as to the present intake system indicate that even this limited danger could be\neliminated by segregating temporary detainees from others.\nTo sum up the balancing of the hardships, the harm to plaintiff and future members of the class she seeks to\nrepresent is, although intangible, irreparable. The harm is the embarrassment and indignity suffered by one\nsubjected unnecessarily to a rather offensive procedure; it cannot be measured in economic terms. In reaching\nthis conclusion, I do bear in mind that plaintiff's case represents an extreme, in that she was taken into custody\ninitially, and consequently subjected to the strip search, on a civil body attachment, not an arrest warrant on\ncriminal charges. Most others temporarily detained at the MCDC are presumably taken into custody, with or\n598 without a warrant, on criminal charges, the *598 nature of which may vary widely. The harm to defendants\noccasioned by the narrow relief requested is slight. I do not discount the important interests of MCDC in\nprotecting the safety of its employees and inmates and keeping contraband out of the center. As previously\nnoted, however, the issue here is only what harm will be caused if MCDC is required to change its search policy\nwith regard to temporary detainees. The chief harm adduced is that performing another kind of search may take\nslightly longer and that some discretion will have to be used to determine whether a strip search is justified in\nparticular cases. No new physical facilities would be required, and the present intake system could be adapted\nfairly readily, if necessary, to segregate temporary detainees from others. The balance of hardships does not\nweigh heavily in favor of defendants.\nLikelihood of success is a very important factor in this case. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit held in Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1981), ___ U.S. ___, 102 S.Ct. 1935, 72 L.Ed.2d 330\n(1982), that a very similar across-the-board strip search policy of the Arlington County, Virginia Detention Center\nwas unconstitutional under the Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), test of\nreasonableness under the circumstances. 660 F.2d at 1013. The search of plaintiff Logan, when balanced\nagainst the invasion of her rights involved, did not have such a discernible relationship to security needs at the\n[11]\ndetention center that it could reasonably be thought to be justified. Id. The Court continued:\nAt no time would Logan or similar detainees be intermingled with the general jail population; her\noffense, though not a minor traffic offense, was nevertheless one not commonly associated by its\n\nvery nature with the possession of weapons or contraband; there was no cause in her specific\ncase to believe that she might possess either; and when strip-searched, she had been at the\nDetention Center for one and one-half hours without even a pat-down search. An indiscriminate\nstrip search policy routinely applied to detainees such as Logan along with all other detainees\ncannot be constitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative ease in attending to\nsecurity considerations.\nId. (citing Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 490-91 (E.D.Wis.1979)). This passage has been quoted in its entirety\nbecause it supplies the basis of some of the county's arguments.\nLogan, for all the defendants' efforts to distinguish it, is controlling. The strip search in Logan was an\nindiscriminate one, performed on all detainees upon arrival at the county detention center. Id.; see 500 F.Supp.\n502, 506 (E.D.Va.1980). Ms. Logan had appeared before a magistrate who released her on her own\nrecognizance but also committed her to the custody of the sheriff for four hours or until someone came to pick her\nup. Whatever her technical status, she was treated as a pretrial detainee in the detention center by the sheriff\nand by the trial and appellate courts. Although the Logan opinions refer to commitment to the custody of the\nsheriff and to his strip search policy, 660 F.2d at 1013, 500 F.Supp. at 506, it is apparent, upon close reading, that\nthe search was performed at a county center, which was apparently run by, or came under the jurisdiction of, the\nsheriff's department. Logan was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the Fourth Circuit's analysis was not\nbased on the nature of the offense, except that it was not one by its very nature commonly associated with\nweapons or contraband. But cf. Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 490-91 (E.D.Wis. 1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160\n(7th Cir. 1980) (per curiam) (case restricted to non-misdemeanor traffic offenses, pretrial detainees charged with\ncriminal offenses distinguished).\n599 Defendants' heavy reliance on the intermingling of its temporary detainees with *599 the general population is\nmisplaced on legal and factual grounds. That was only one of several factors mentioned by the Court of Appeals\nin Logan, 660 F.2d at 1013, and the combination of the factors led it to conclude not only that the indiscriminate\nstrip search policy was unconstitutional, but also that it could not reasonably even have been thought to be\njustified. Moreover, as discussed above, the intermingling of temporary detainees with the \"general population\" at\nMCDC is limited, and even the limited extent could be avoided.\nThe likelihood of success on the merits in this case is high. With respect to conducting a strip search in private,\neven if all defendants' arguments were accepted, there is no reason why the initial search of incoming detainees\ncannot be done in private. The county conceded as much. The likelihood of success on the probable cause\naspect of the merits is also high. Although the factual presentation at the preliminary injunction hearing was brief,\nthe key factual issues 00 the policy as now applied, the present receiving procedures, and the physical setting of\n97\nthe men's and women's receiving and intake areas 00 do not seem likely to change. For the reasons previously\n97\nelaborated, this Court finds that Logan is controlling on the merits.\nThe final factor to be considered in connection with the preliminary injunctive relief is the public interest. There is\nsome interest of the public in Montgomery County in security at MCDC, but even that narrow interest is not\ndisserved by the limited relief sought here. Montgomery County residents and others who may be temporarily\ndetained have at least as much interest, in this narrow sense, in not being subjected unnecessarily to humiliating,\ndegrading strip searches. The public with whose interest this Court must be concerned is not either of these\nnarrowly defined \"publics,\" but a broader, more general one. To the extent that the public interest is a factor, it\nweighs in favor of restricting searches of temporary detainees to the extent necessary to protect penal security.\nThis Court is mindful that preliminary injunctive relief that changes, rather than simply maintains, the status quo is\nto be afforded sparingly. E.g., Wetzel v. Edwards, 635 F.2d 283, 286 (4th Cir. 1980). However, for all the reasons\npreviously discussed, this case is one that merits such relief. Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction is\ngranted. Defendants will be enjoined from permitting, promulgating a policy permitting, or enforcing a policy\npermitting the visual strip search of a temporary detainee, as that term has been defined herein, except upon\nprobable cause to believe such detainee has weapons or contraband concealed on his or her person and from\npermitting, promulgating a policy permitting or enforcing a policy permitting the conducting of such searches other\nthan in private. Nothing in this opinion is to be construed as preventing the MCDC from performing other kinds of\nsearches of temporary detainees or from performing a visual strip search of a temporary detainee when probable\n\ncause, as that term is defined in the search context, exists to believe that a temporary detainee may have\nweapons or contraband concealed on his or her person.\n[1] The individual defendants are Paul A. McGuckian, County Attorney; Charles W. Gilchrist, County Executive;\nGary R. Blake, Director of the County Department of Correction and Rehabilitation; Bernard D. Crooke, Jr., Chief\nof Police; and Jane Doe, a guard at the Montgomery County Detention Center. All but Doe are alleged to have\nsome responsibility for promulgating or enforcing the strip search policy that is challenged here. See Stipulation\nof Facts ¶¶ 3-6. \nReferences have been made in this opinion to \"the County\" and the \"Montgomery County Detention Center,\"\nreferring in a general way to the county itself and the individuals responsible in their official capacities for\npromulgating or enforcing the strip search policy. These references, particularly with respect to the discussion of\nlikelihood of success on the merits, are not intended to be comments on the liability in this action of particular\nindividuals, but only references to the strip search policy itself.\n[2] \"Temporary detainees\" includes persons arrested and held overnight or for another short period before\nappearing before a judicial officer and those waiting to be released while bond is posted, a relative comes, or the\nlike. It does not include all pretrial detainees, for example, those who are unable to make bond and are being\nheld for a matter of weeks or months until trial.\n[3] Ms. Smith was taken into custody by two officers of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department on a civil\nbody attachment issued to answer a contempt charge. Affidavit of James A. Young, Sheriff, ¶ 7 and Attachment\nA-2. She was arrested and booked on a charge of contempt. Affidavit of James A. Young, Sheriff, ¶ 10 and\nAttachment A-3.\n[4] She had failed to appear because she believed, correctly as things turned out, that the proceeding had been\ndismissed in New Jersey.\n[5] The general procedures are the same for males and females. The physical layout of the rooms where they are\nsearched differs.\n[6] The term \"pretrial detainees\" refers herein to persons who have been arrested, charged and taken before a\njudicial officer for an initial appearance pursuant to M.D.R. 723 or Md. R. 720(d), but remain in custody because\nthey cannot post bond or otherwise secure release. \"Temporary detainees\" refers to persons who have been\narrested on criminal charges or otherwise detained to appear before a court but have not yet appeared before a\njudicial officer or are awaiting release shortly. \nThe County's definition of a \"pretrial detainee\" as including anyone about whom a judicial determination has been\nmade, i.e., a person arrested on a warrant, has not been used. Counsel for the county stated at oral argument\nthat persons arrested without a warrant are taken before a district court commissioner before they are brought to\nthe MCDC. If so, apparently individuals arrested on a warrant may be held overnight before their initial\nappearance. The Maryland rules require that persons arrested with or without a warrant be taken before a district\ncourt official within 24 hours of arrest. A judicial determination of probable cause to arrest is not the same as a\ndetermination to commit to MCDC.\n[7] There may be other categories of persons detained in the MCDC from time to time, such as prisoners brought\nfrom elsewhere on writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum, but they were not mentioned.\n[8] It should perhaps be noted that a person remains a \"temporary detainee\" for only a short period of time. Some\nsuch persons may appear before a judicial officer and be released, others may be committed to the MCDC. The\nlatter persons then fall into the category of \"pretrial detainees,\" and no question is raised about searching them\nafter they have been committed to the MCDC.\n[9] Defendants correctly point out that the general test for searches of pretrial detainees is reasonableness under\nthe circumstances. The point of \"probable cause\" requirement for searches of temporary detainees is that if other\nconsiderations such as contact with the general inmate population are found to be absent or minimal, the highly\nintrusive nature of the strip search can only be justified in terms of prison security when applied to a temporary\n\ndetainee if there is some cause or reason to believe that a particular person has concealed a weapon or\ncontraband on his or her person. \nBecause there are various legal meanings of the term \"probable cause,\" it should be noted that the appropriate\nstandard is probably that of searches incident to arrest. See Tinetti, 479 F.Supp. at 490. Factors include the kind\nof offense charged, the nature of the offender and possibly the circumstances of arrest.\n[10] This term refers herein to all detainees or inmates except temporary detainees.\n[11] In reaching this conclusion, the Court disposed of the sheriff's good faith defense, as well as the issue of\nconstitutionality.

Tobin, Jr., Rockville, Md., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nJOSEPH H. YOUNG, District Judge.\nPlaintiff Vivian Smith brought this suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of herself and as a purported\nrepresentative of two classes of similarly situated persons alleging that the Montgomery County Detention\nCenter's policy of indiscriminately strip searching all persons detained at the Center violates the Fourth\nAmendment. Plaintiff and the classes she purports to represent seek declaratory and injunctive relief and\ndamages. Named as defendants are Paul McGuckian, County Attorney of Montgomery County; Charles Gilchrist,\nCounty Executive of Montgomery County; Gary Blake, Director of the Department of Correction and\n[1]\nRehabilitation of Montgomery County; Jane Doe,  a guard at the Center who conducted a strip search of\n[2]\nplaintiff; and Montgomery County.  All the individual defendants are being sued in both their individual and\nofficial capacities.\nThis case was previously assigned to Judge Jones of this District. In a Memorandum and Order dated September\n17, 1982, Judge Jones summarized the relevant facts:\nVivian Smith was arrested at her home at about 10:00 p.m. on November 12, 1981 for contempt of\ncourt, in failing to appear in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on October 28, 1981 in\nconnection with a child support action originating in Essex County, New Jersey. She was taken to\nthe Rockville District police station, where she was photographed and an arrest report was filed.\nShe was then taken, at about 11:40 p.m. to the Montgomery County Detention Center (MCDC),\nwhere she remained overnight....\nUpon arrival at the detention center, plaintiff was taken to the women's receiving and discharge\narea, an open room approximately 15 feet by 20 feet containing a shower, desk and one cell\nnormally used as a holding cell. She was ordered to, and did, remove all her clothing. She then\nhad to move her arms, open her mouth, bend over and squat, while a female correctional officer\nconducted a visual inspection of her body, including her oral, vaginal and anal cavities. This\nsearch took place in the presence of another female detainee, who was in the cell in the room. No\n607 weapon or contraband was found. Ms. Smith then showered *607 and was placed in the holding\ncell with the other female detainee overnight.\nAll persons held or detained in the MCDC undergo the same preliminary procedures. They are\nmade to remove their clothing, which is checked for weapons and contraband, and their body\ncavities 00 mouth, nose, ears, anus, and genital area 00 are visually inspected. Areas such as the\n97 97\n\nsoles of the feet, armpits and hair are also inspected. The guard performing the search does not\nnormally touch the detainee in the inspection.\nAccording to Gary Blake, Montgomery County Director of Correction and Rehabilitation, strip\nsearches are normally performed in private, although the MCDC written policy does not state that\nthey must or should be.... The strip search policy applies to all detainees, regardless of whether\nthere is probable cause to believe they may be concealing weapons or contraband, regardless of\nwhere they are housed and regardless of whether they are being held overnight pending a court\nappearance the next day or for a longer period.\nSmith v. Montgomery County, 547 F.Supp. 592, 593-95 (D.Md.1982) (captions and footnotes omitted). In the\nsame Memorandum and Order, Judge Jones granted plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The\npreliminary injunction states:\nThat defendants are enjoined, during the pendency of this litigation, from permitting, promulgating\na policy permitting, and enforcing the present policy permitting, a visual strip search of a\ntemporary detainee at the Montgomery County Detention Center, as defined herein, except upon\nprobable cause to believe such detainee has weapons or contraband concealed on his or her\nperson. Defendants are likewise enjoined from permitting, promulgating a policy permitting, and\nenforcing the present policy to the extent that it permits the conducting of visual searches other\nthan in private.\nBy letter dated August 3, 1983, this Court advised counsel that marginal orders had been entered: 1) denying\nplaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment; 2) dissolving the preliminary injunction; 3) declaring plaintiff's\nmotion for compliance with the preliminary injunction moot; 4) granting in part and denying in part defendant\nMcGuckian's motion to dismiss and alternative motion for summary judgment; 5) denying defendants' motion to\ndismiss and alternative motion for summary judgment; and 6) granting plaintiff's second motion for order\n[3]\ncompelling discovery.  This Memorandum and Order sets forth the reasons for these marginal orders and\nresolves the motion for class certification.\nPLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nIn her motion for partial summary judgment, plaintiff seeks a declaration that the Center's strip search policy is\nunconstitutional and an order permanently enjoining defendants from strip searching short-term detainees absent\nprobable cause to believe that they are concealing weapons or contraband and from strip searching short-term\ndetainees other than in private. Because, as discussed below, plaintiff lacks standing to seek either declaratory or\ninjunctive relief, this motion must be denied.\nTo invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court, a plaintiff must satisfy the threshold requirement of an actual \"case or\ncontroversy\" imposed by Article III of the Constitution. Los Angeles v. Lyons, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 103 S.Ct. 1660,\n1665, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983); Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 94-101, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1949-1953, 20 L.Ed.2d 947. In\norder to satisfy the case or controversy requirement, a plaintiff must demonstrate \"such a personal stake in the\noutcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues\n608 upon which the court so largely depends...\" *608Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d\n663 (1962). In a series of recent cases the Supreme Court has elaborated on the requisite personal stake\nrequired to assert a claim for injunctive relief. Lyons, supra; Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46\nL.Ed.2d 561 (1976); O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). \"The plaintiff must\nshow that he `has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury' as the result of the\nchallenged official conduct and the injury or threat of injury must be both `real and immediate,' not `conjectural' or\n`hypothetical.'\" Lyons, ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1665 (emphasis added). In Lyons, the Court reaffirmed the\nstatement previously made in both Rizzo and O'Shea that \"[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself\nshow a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief ... if unaccompanied by any continuing, present\nadverse effects.\" ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1665. The Lyons Court defined \"continuing, present adverse\neffects\" as a \"real and immediate threat of repeated injury...\" Id. Moreover, \"speculation is insufficient to establish\n\nthe existence of a present live controversy.\" ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1666. Standing to seek injunctive relief,\ntherefore, depends on whether plaintiff is likely to suffer future injury as a result of the conduct sought to be\nenjoined.\nBased on these principles, the Court in Lyons held that a plaintiff who had sustained injury as a result of a\nchokehold applied by a police officer did not have standing to enjoin the use of chokeholds despite the fact that\nhe had standing to sue for damages. The Court stated that because the plaintiff did not credibly allege that there\nwas a real and immediate threat that he would be the victim of another chokehold, the plaintiff could not sue to\nenjoin the use of chokeholds. Lyons compels the conclusion that plaintiff in the case at bar lacks standing to seek\ninjunctive relief against the Center's strip search policy. Plaintiff does not allege, nor could she credibly allege,\nthat she will be arrested in the future and strip searched without probable cause to believe she is carrying\nweapons or contraband.\nPlaintiff contends that the instant case is distinguishable from Lyons on the ground that the plaintiff in Lyons,\nunlike the plaintiff in the instant case, sought to enjoin conduct which was not officially authorized by the\ngovernmental defendant. This contention is misplaced. Although the Lyons Court did state that the plaintiff in that\ncase did not have standing to seek injunctive relief because the conduct sought to be enjoined was not\nauthorized by the governmental defendant, the Court made clear that failure to credibly allege threat of future\ninjury, regardless of whether that injury would result from the exercise of official governmental policy, precluded a\nplaintiff from seeking injunctive relief. In other words, the likelihood of future injury is an inquiry separate and\napart from the inquiry of whether or not the conduct sought to be enjoined is authorized by official governmental\npolicy. In § 1983 cases against governmental entities, such as the instant case and Lyons, both inquiries must be\nanswered in the affirmative. A plaintiff must first show that he is likely to sustain injury in the future from the\nconduct sought to be enjoined. Only after plaintiff has credibly alleged threat of future injury does a court concern\nitself with whether the conduct sought to be enjoined was based on official governmental policy. In the case at\nbar, plaintiff's failure to credibly allege threat of future injury from the Center's strip search policy precludes her\nfrom seeking to enjoin that policy even though defendants concede that the policy is officially authorized by\nMontgomery County.\nThe instant case is readily distinguishable from Kolender v. Lawson, ___ U.S. ___, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d\n903 (1983), where the Court in a case decided after Lyons held that a plaintiff had standing to seek injunctive\nrelief. Lawson sought to enjoin the application of a California criminal statute pursuant to which he had been\n609 arrested or detained approximately fifteen times. Thus, the Court stated that \"there *609 is a `credible threat' that\nLawson might be detained again under\" the statute sufficient to permit him to seek injunctive relief. ___ U.S. at\n___, n. 3, 103 S.Ct. at 1857, n. 3.\nPlaintiff also lacks standing to seek declaratory relief. The Declaratory Judgment Act is expressly limited to cases\ninvolving an \"actual controversy.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2201. In Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 89 S.Ct. 956, 22\nL.Ed.2d 113 (1969), the Court held that a congressman who had once been convicted under a statute lacked\nstanding to seek a declaration about the constitutionality of that statute. The Court said that since it was \"wholly\nconjectural\" that the congressman would again be prosecuted under the statute, the congressman could not\nestablish threat of injury of \"sufficient immediacy and reality\" to seek a declaration on the constitutionality of the\nstatute. 394 U.S. at 109, 89 S.Ct. at 960. Significantly, Golden was cited with approval in Lyons as \"a case arising\nin an analogous situation\" which is \"directly apposite.\" ___ U.S. at ___, 103 S.Ct. at 1666.\nDISSOLUTION OF THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\nThe Court's holding that plaintiff lacks standing to seek injunctive relief requires that the preliminary injunction\nissued by Judge Jones be dissolved. The Court cautions the defendants that, although they are no longer under\ncourt order prohibiting them from engaging in an indiscriminate strip search policy, it would be unwise for them to\ndo so in light of the Court's holding which is discussed infra that defendant's indiscriminate strip search policy is\nunconstitutional. Thus, although defendants are technically free to resume the strip search policy that was in\neffect prior to the issuance of the preliminary injunction, to do so may subject them to both compensatory and\n[4]\npunitive damages.\n\nPLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRELIMINARY\nINJUNCTION\nThe dissolution of the preliminary injunction moots this motion.\nDEFENDANT McGUCKIAN'S MOTION TO DISMISS AND ALTERNATIVE\nMOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nDefendant McGuckian, the County Attorney of Montgomery County, put forth four reasons in support of his\nmotion to dismiss or, in the alternative, motion for summary judgment. Each of these reasons will be addressed in\nturn.\nFirst, McGuckian contends that he was not personally involved in the alleged deprivation of the constitutional\nrights of plaintiff. Liability under § 1983 extends only to those persons who are personally involved in the\ndeprivation of the federal rights of other persons. Vinnedge v. Gibbs, 550 F.2d 926 (4th Cir.1977). McGuckian,\nhowever, acknowledges that he and his staff gave legal opinions to the Center's staff regarding the legality of the\nCenter's strip search policy. Giving legal advice which serves as the basis for actions which violates the rights of\nothers is sufficient personal involvement to support liability under § 1983. See Donovan v. Reinbold, 433 F.2d 738\n(9th Cir.1970); Gilbert v. School District, 485 F.Supp. 505 (D.Colo. 1980). Accordingly, McGuckian's first reason\nmust fail.\nMcGuckian's second reason why the claims against him should be dismissed is that the attorney-client privilege\n\"would prevent proof of communications between defendant McGuckian and other named defendants\" and thus\nplaintiff would not be able to establish any liability against McGuckian. Underlying this reason as well as the\ndefendants' opposition to plaintiff's second motion for an order compelling discovery is defendants' belief that the\n610 legal opinions given by McGuckian and his *610 staff on the legality of the Center's strip search policy are\nprivileged under the attorney-client privilege. Assuming arguendo that the attorney-client privilege attached to the\nlegal opinions by McGuckian and his staff, see Community Savings and Loan Association v. Federal Home Loan\nBank Board, 68 F.R.D. 378 (E.D.Wis.) (legal opinions based on public information as opposed to confidential\ninformation are not privileged), the privilege has been waived by the numerous statements made by the\ndefendants about the legal advice they received on the Center's strip search policy. See, e.g., depositions of\ndefendants Gilchrist and Blake; see also defendant McGuckian's Reply Memorandum to Plaintiff's Supplemental\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant McGuckian's Motion to Dismiss and Alternative Motion for Summary\nJudgment. Consequently, because of defendants' voluntary disclosures about the legal opinions issued by\nMcGuckian and his staff, see 8 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure 127 (1970), McGuckian's\nsecond reason also fails.\nMcGuckian's third reason for seeking to have the claims against him dismissed is that he is absolutely immune\nfrom damages under § 1983. However, because McGuckian does not exercise any quasi-judicial authority nor is\nhe engaged in any prosecutorial activities, he is not clothed with absolute immunity under § 1983. Imbler v.\nPachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); Donovan, supra; Gilbert, supra.\nLastly, McGuckian contends that even if he is not clothed with absolute immunity, the claims against him must be\ndismissed because he is immune from damages under the defense of qualified immunity. Under the defense of\nqualified immunity, McGuckian is \"shielded from liability insofar as [his] conduct does not violate clearly\nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The Supreme Court has stated that,\nin determining whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, a court must \"determine, not only the\ncurrently applicable law, but whether that law was clearly established at the time an action occurred.\" 457 U.S. at\n818, 102 S.Ct. at 2739. As previously noted by Judge Jones, Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981) \"is\ncontrolling on the merits\" of this case. Smith, 547 F.Supp. at 599. In Logan, the Fourth Circuit held that an across-\nthe-board policy of strip searching pre-trial detainees violates the Fourth Amendment. The Court concludes that \n\nLogan is both the currently applicable law as well as the \"clearly established law ... of which a reasonable person\nwould have known\" on the constitutionality of across-the-board strip search policies such as that employed at the\n[5]\nCenter as of the date, October 7, 1981, it was decided.  Prior to Logan, however, it cannot be said that the law\non the legality of across-the-board strip search policies was clearly established. Compare Logan v. Shealy, 500\nF.Supp. 502 (E.D.Va.1980),rev'd,660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981)with Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486\n(E.D.Wis.1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980); see also Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60\nL.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Accordingly, McGuckian is immunized from liability prior to the date Logan was decided by\nthe Fourth Circuit, but is precluded from asserting the defense of qualified immunity for any action he took after\nthe Fourth Circuit's decision in Logan.\n611  DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS AND ALTERNATIVE MOTION\n*611\nFOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nIn this motion, defendants argue that the entire complaint must be dismissed because the Center's across-the-\nboard strip search policy is constitutional. Defendants argue that the Fourth Circuit's opinion in Logan is\ndistinguishable on the grounds that Logan only applies to strip searches conducted by law enforcement officers\nprior to the commitment of arrestees to a detention facility. This argument has previously been rejected by Judge\nJones. This Court fully agrees with Judge Jones that Logan is controlling on the merits of the instant case.\nIndeed, squarely faced with the issue of the constitutionality of the Center's indiscriminate strip search policy and\nfailure to conduct strip searches in private raised in this motion, the Court holds that, based on Logan, the\nCenter's indiscriminate strip search policy and failure to conduct strip searches in private is unconstitutional.\nTherefore, defendants' motion must be denied.\nPLAINTIFF'S SECOND MOTION FOR ORDER COMPELLING\nDISCOVERY\nIn this motion, plaintiff seeks an order compelling defendant McGuckian and one of his staff attorneys to answer\nquestions about the Fourth Circuit's decision in Logan. Defendants oppose this motion on the grounds of\nattorney-client privilege and work product privilege. As previously indicated, any attorney-client privilege that\nMcGuckian and his staff may have been able to assert regarding their legal opinions on the effect of Logan has\nbeen waived by the statements of the defendants made during the course of this litigation. In addition, the work\nproduct privilege is inapplicable since the defendants have not shown that the legal opinions sought to be\ndiscovered were given in contemplation of litigation. See Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed.\n451 (1947); Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 864 (D.C.Cir.1980).\nPLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\nPlaintiff moves for certification of two classes, one for purposes of injunctive relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2),\nand one for purposes of damages under Fed.R. Civ.P. 23(b)(3). In light of the Court's denial of standing for\nplaintiff, the Court will deny the motion for a class for injunctive relief and grant the motion for a damages class.\nHowever, the class is redefined as follows:\n\"All persons who were `temporary detainees' at the Montgomery County Detention Center\n(\"MCDC\") since May 20, 1979, and were strip searched absent probable cause to believe that\nthey possessed either weapons or contraband. The term `temporary detainees' is defined to\ninclude all persons arrested and held for 24 hours or less.\"\nUnder Fed.R.Civ.P. 23, a class must meet not only the four prerequisites listed in 23(a), but also the additional\nprerequisite that the class be ascertainable and identifiable. 7 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and\nProcedure 590. Moreover, 23(b)(3) establishes two additional requirements for class certification. As discussed\nherein, the class defined by the Court meets all of these requirements.\n\n1. Definite class\nThe prerequisite of an ascertainable and definable class stems from the concern that \"at the time of judgment the\nindividual members of the class will be readily identifiable.\" Hammond v. Powell, 462 F.2d 1053, 1055 (4th\nCir.1972). Defendants assert that since MCDC records do not explicitly detail the existence of probable cause or\nlack thereof, a class defined as those searched without probable cause is too indefinite to support class\ncertification. However, the Court concludes that the existence of probable cause can be determined from MCDC\ndata detailing the nature of the charge, the reason for release from MCDC, and the subsequent history of the\ndetainee.\n612 *612 Plaintiffs have requested the Court to certify a 23(b)(3) class defined as follows:\n\"All persons who were `temporary detainees' at the Montgomery County Detention Center\n(\"MCDC\") since May 20, 1979, and were strip searched absent probable cause to believe that\nthey possessed either weapons or contraband. The term `temporary detainees' is defined to\ninclude all persons arrested and held overnight or for another short period of time either (1) prior\nto an appearance before a judicial officer or (2) after an appearance before a judicial officer and\nwhile waiting to be released while bond is posted, a relative comes, or some similar condition of\nrelease is satisfied. It does not include `pretrial detainees,' a term that includes persons who were\nbeing held for a matter of weeks or months until trial because they were unable to make bond.\"\nThe Court, however, concludes that such a definition sweeps too broadly. It would include persons commingled\nwith the general detention center population while, for example, they were awaiting the posting of bond. Such a\nresult would contradict the Fourth Circuit's ruling in Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (1981). Thus the Court will\nnarrow the class to those held for 24 hours or less. See generally, Koen v. Long, 302 F.Supp. 1383, 1389\n(E.D.Mo.1969),aff'd,428 F.2d 876 (8th Cir.1970).\n2. Numerosity\nAs previously observed by this Court, impossibility of joinder is not necessary to meet the numerosity requirement\nof Rule 23(a). \"Rather, difficulty or impracticability of joinder is sufficient.\" Smith v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co.,\n473 F.Supp. 572, 581 (D.Md.1979). Defendants have not estimated the number of persons detained for 24 hours\nor less, however they have stated that since 1979 at least 15,000 persons have been strip searched pursuant to\ndetention center policy. The Court is confident that out of this figure the number who were searched without\nprobable cause is sufficiently large to render joinder impracticable. Indeed, the Fourth Circuit has found 18 to be\na sufficient number of persons to permit class certification. Cypress v. Newport News General and Nonsectarian\nHospital, 375 F.2d 648 (4th Cir.1967).\n3. Commonality\nRule 23 also requires that one or more issues of law and fact are common to members of the class. In light of this\nCourt's determination that defendant's indiscriminate strip search policy was unconstitutional, this action clearly\nraises a common question of law as to defendants' liability.\n4. Typicality\nThe typicality requirement of Rule 23 addresses whether the representatives' claims and interests are in fact\nconsistent and harmonious with the rest of the class. Smith v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 473 F.Supp. at 58.\nIn this case the basic claims of the class members are identical as to the legal theory of liability as well as to the\nunderlying facts. That members of the class may make additional claims based on privacy concerns for strip\nsearches conducted in non-public places does not render the claims atypical. As this Court has already observed:\n\"Factual differences will not necessarily render a claim atypical if the representative's claim arises from the same\n\nevent, practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of the class, and is based on the same legal\ntheory.\" Id.\n5. Adequacy of Representation\nRule 23(a) also requires that the representative party demonstrate that she will fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class. This requirement addresses the legal capacity of plaintiff's counsel to represent the class\nas well as to the representative's own ability to pursue a course of conduct beneficial to the absent class\nmembers. Id. In determining whether a proposed representative meets this standard, courts look to such factors\n613 as whether the representative's interests are *613 sufficiently identical to those of the absent class members so\nthat she will diligently and vigorously pursue the claims of all members of the class; whether the representative's\ncounsel is competent to conduct the litigation; and whether there is an antagonism of interest between the named\nplaintiff and members of the class. See generally 3B J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 23.07[1]-[5] (2 ed.\n1982). The named plaintiff in this case clearly satisfies the adequacy of representation requirement of Rule 23:\nher interests are coextensive with, not antagonistic to, those of the class, and her counsel have vigorously and\ndiligently pursued her claim.\n6. Class Certification Pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3)\nBesides the four prerequisites enumerated in 23(a), a damage class must also satisfy two additional\nrequirements listed in 23(b)(3): \"that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other\navailable methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\" \"The fundamental question to decide\nis whether the group aspiring to class status is seeking to remedy a common legal grievance.\" Bennett v.\nGravelle, 323 F.Supp. 203, 218 (D.Md.1971). As previously stated, this case presents a common question of law\nwhich is predominant over any additional individual claims. Moreover, resolution of the liability and damages\nissues within the context of a class action is far more efficient than individual prosecution of damages actions. A\nclass action is also the fairest means to settle this controversy since it is unlikely that most class members would\npursue these claims on their own. Thus, because all the requirements of Rule 23 have been satisfied, the Court\nfinds the certification of a class for the purpose of both damages and liability entirely appropriate.\n7. Notice\nRule 23(c)(2) requires individual notice to class members who can be identified with reasonable effort. Pursuant\nto these notice provisions the Court directs defendants to send notice to all persons detained at MCDC for 24\nhours or less since May 20, 1979. Notice shall be made by first class mail to each person within the group\nidentified above, and directed to the last known address. Defendants shall also publish notice once a week for 3\nweeks in local newspapers in Montgomery County, counties contingent to Montgomery County (i.e., Prince\nGeorges, Fairfax, Howard, and Frederick), and the District of Columbia.\n8. Scheduling\nTo streamline further litigation in this case, the Court directs the parties to adhere to the following schedule:\n1. Within thirty days of receipt of this Order, defendants shall complete the mailing and publication of notice. Once\nthis is completed, defendants shall file with the Court a list of the names and addresses of all detainees to whom\nnotice was mailed. The Court will seal this list.\n2. Within thirty days from the date of completion of notice under the preceding paragraph, members of the class\nmust notify defendants that they wish to be included within the suit. This \"opt-in\" provision will enable the Court\nand the parties to determine the scope of the litigation at an early stage. See Philadelphia Electric v. Anaconda\nAmerican Brass Co., 43 F.R.D. 452, 459 (E.D.Pa.1968).\n\n3. Upon receipt of all responses, defendants will supply this Court with a list of the names and addresses of those\npersons who have responded. The Court will then disclose this list to plaintiff under a protective order directing\nthat disclosure is for the limited purposes of this litigation and that no disclosure shall be made to any third\nparties.\n4. Within thirty days from the last day upon which responses will be accepted defendants must establish whether\nprobable cause existed for the search of any particular detainee. The Court allocates the burden of proof for\n614 probable cause to defendants *614 since the Court concludes that it is more likely than not that probable cause\ndid not exist. Moreover, fairness considerations dictate this allocation since the very data which will prove the\nexistence of probable cause is in defendants' control. See generally F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedures §\n7.9 (2d ed. 1977). This burden should not prove particularly onerous to the defendants. Once they introduce\nevidence raising a genuine issue of fact as to the existence of probable cause, the burden will shift to plaintiff to\nrebut this evidence. See Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d\n207 (1980) (allocation of burden in Title VII actions). Plaintiffs will have thirty days from the date by which\nprobable cause must be shown for rebuttal. Where there is a genuine dispute as to the existence of probable\ncause, the Court will hold a hearing.\n5. The class members remaining at the end of the thirty days for rebuttal will constitute the damages class.\nPLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY OF NAMES AND\nDEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER\nPlaintiff moves to compel discovery of the name of the detainee who was present during the strip search of\nplaintiff as well as the names of other temporary detainees who have been strip searched without probable\ncause. Defendants move for a protective order for these names. The Court finds that defendants should disclose\nthe name of the co-detainee directly to plaintiff. In reviewing the statutes and provisions cited by defendants, the\nCourt finds that contrary to defendants' assertions, they do not prohibit discovery. The co-detainee is obviously a\nmaterial witness with respect to defendants' liability for conducting the strip search in a non-public place. The\nCourt, however, instructs plaintiff that the name is disclosed for the limited purposes of this litigation and that it\ncannot be disclosed to any third party. In light of the above notice provisions, the motion to compel discovery of\nthe names of the other temporary detainees is moot. As already stated, plaintiffs will receive the names and\naddresses of those responding to defendants' notice.\nPLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES UNDER FED.R.CIV.P. 37\n(a)(4)\nThe Court denies plaintiff's motion for reasonable costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred in obtaining orders\ncompelling discovery. Rule 37(a)(4) authorizes the award of reasonable costs to the party moving to compel\ndiscovery unless the court finds that the \"opposition was substantially justified.\" Opposition to a motion is\n\"`substantially justified' if the motion raised an issue about which reasonable men could genuinely differ on\nwhether a party was bound to comply with a discovery rule.\" 8 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and\nProcedure 790 (1970). As defendants' subsequent motion for a protective order demonstrates, there were\nsignificant privacy grounds for objecting to disclosure of the detainees' names. Moreover, it was not unreasonable\nfor defendants to assert the attorney-client privilege as to legal opinions of defendant McGuckian and his staff. In\nshort, it cannot be said that defendants acted in bad faith in failing to comply. See Canron, Inc. v. Plasser\nAmerican Corp., 474 F.Supp. 1010 (D.C.Va.1978),aff'd,609 F.2d 1075 (4th Cir.1979),cert. denied,446 U.S. 965,\n100 S.Ct. 2942, 64 L.Ed.2d 824. Thus, the Court finds this to be an inappropriate case for the award of attorneys'\nfees.\nAccordingly, for the reasons stated herein, it is this 26th day of October, 1983, by the United States District Court\nfor the District of Maryland, ORDERED:\n\n1. That plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment BE, and the same IS, hereby DENIED;\n2. That plaintiff's motion for compliance BE, and the same IS, hereby MOOT;\n3. That defendant McGuckian's motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment BE, and the same\n615 IS, hereby *615 GRANTED in part and DENIED in part;\n4. That defendant's motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment BE, and the same IS, hereby\nDENIED;\n5. That plaintiff's motion to compel discovery of legal opinions BE, and the same IS, hereby GRANTED;\n6. That plaintiff's motion for class certification BE, and the same IS, hereby DENIED as to a 23(b)(2) class for\ninjunctive relief;\n7. That plaintiff's motion for class certification BE, and the same IS, hereby GRANTED as to a 23(b)(3) damages\nclass defined as follows:\n\"All persons who were \"temporary detainees' at the Montgomery County Detention Center\n(\"MCDC\") since May 20, 1979, and were strip searched absent probable cause to believe that\nthey possessed either weapons or contraband. The term `temporary detainees' is defined to\ninclude all persons arrested and held for 24 hours or less.\"\n8. That defendants shall mail notices in accordance with this Opinion;\n9. That plaintiff's motion to compel discovery BE, and the same IS, hereby GRANTED as to the name of the co-\ndetainee;\n10. That plaintiff's motion to compel discovery BE, and the same IS, hereby MOOT as to the names of temporary\ndetainees;\n11. That defendant's motion for a protective order BE, and the same IS, hereby GRANTED as to the name of the\nco-detainee;\n12. That plaintiff's motion for attorneys fees BE, and the same IS, hereby DENIED; and\n13. That the time for the parties to file an appeal, if any, shall be determined as of the date of this Order.\n[1] Discovery has revealed that the guard who conducted the strip search of plaintiff was Denise Dodson. Plaintiff\nwill be granted leave to amend her complaint to substitute Denise Dodson for Jane Doe.\n[2] Bernard Crooke, Montgomery County Police Chief, was also named as a defendant in the complaint.\nSubsequently, however, the parties have entered into a stipulation dismissing all claims against Crooke.\n[3] In the August 3, 1983 letter, the Court reserved ruling on plaintiff's motion for class certification, plaintiff's\nsupplemental motion for order compelling discovery and defendant's motion for a protective order.\n[4] It should be noted that although the Court is dissolving the preliminary injunction, it has adopted all of the legal\nanalysis in Judge Jones's opinion, in particular footnote 9. The Court declines to adopt a reasonable suspicion\nstandard for strip searches. See, e.g., Hunt v. Polk, 551 F.Supp. 339 (S.D.Iowa, 1982).\n[5] The Court recognizes that Justice Rehnquist, in his capacity as a Circuit Justice, in staying the Fourth Circuit's\nmandate in Logan, stated that Logan was incorrectly decided. Clements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1304, 102 S.Ct. 284,\n70 L.Ed.2d 461 (1981). However, the alacrity with which the full Supreme Court vacated the stay entered by\nJustice Rehnquist, is a strong indication that the full Court believes that Logan was correctly decided. Clements v.\nLogan, 454 U.S. 1117, 102 S.Ct. 961, 71 L.Ed.2d 105 (1981) (stay vacated two days after it was entered). In any\nevent, by virtue of the Court's decision to deny certiorari, 455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982), \n\nLogan is the law in this Circuit and accordingly must be followed by this Court as well as those persons in the\nstates included within the Fourth Circuit.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
