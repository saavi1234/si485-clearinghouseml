      "text": "337 F.3d 961 (2003)\nLolita STANLEY and Larry Stanley, Plaintiffs-Appellants,\nv.\nAnita HENSON, female employee of Vigo County Sheriff's Department, William R. Harris,\nin his official capacity as Vigo County Sheriff, and Jeffrey Ennen, Lieutenant, Defendants-\nAppellees.\nNo. 02-2806.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit.\nArgued May 28, 2003.\nDecided July 28, 2003.\n962 *962 Marilyn A. Moores (argued), Cohen & Malad, Indianapolis, IN, for Plaintiffs-Appellants.\nCraig M. McKee (argued), Wilkinson, Goeller, Modesitt, Wilkinson & Drummy, Terre Haute, IN, for Defendants-\nAppellees.\nBefore EASTERBROOK, MANION, and KANNE, Circuit Judges.\nKANNE, Circuit Judge.\nOn the night of January 30, 1998, Lolita Stanley was arrested by Terre Haute, Indiana police officers, facing\nmisdemeanor charges of battery on a police officer and resisting arrest. She was taken to the Vigo County jail,\nwhere jail officer Anita Henson guided her through the jail's admission procedures. Officer Henson first conducted\na pat-down search of Ms. Stanley while she was fully clothed; that search turned up no weapons or other\ncontraband. Officer Henson took down Ms. Stanley's personal information, photographed and fingerprinted her.\nMs. Stanley was then required to go through the jail's clothing-exchange procedure. Officer Henson directed her\nto a small, doorless room near the booking area. The room was partially divided by a cinder-block wall\napproximately four feet in height, behind which a toilet was located. Mounted on the wall near the booking area\nwas a video camera, which Ms. Stanley initially believed was filming the area in which she was changing (she\nsubsequently learned that the camera does not film that area). Officer Henson provided Ms. Stanley with a jail-\nissued uniform and told her to remove all her street clothing, except for her underpants, to change into the\nuniform. Ms. Stanley was not wearing a brassiere at that time, requiring her to expose her breasts as she\nchanged. While Ms. Stanley disrobed (in the front portion of the room, not behind the cinder-block wall), Officer\nHenson remained in the room, continuously observing her until she was dressed in the jail uniform, but at no time\ndid Officer Henson touch Ms. Stanley nor did she conduct any visual inspection of Ms. Stanley's body cavities.\nThe entire exchange process took approximately two minutes. Ms. Stanley was then taken to a cell where she\nremained with several other women, but she was never introduced into the jail's general population.\nLater that morning, superior officers of the Terre Haute Police Department reviewed Ms. Stanley's arrest and\nordered her immediate release from custody; all criminal charges against her were eventually dropped. Ms.\nStanley then was permitted to change back into the clothes in which she had arrived at the jail, but in the same\nroom and under substantially the same procedures and conditions as when she had originally changed into the\njail uniform00that is, in the small, doorless room under the continuous observation of a female jail officer known\n97\nonly as \"Joanie.\"\nMs. Stanley and her husband Laurence Stanley subsequently brought this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nseeking damages for being subjected to the clothing-exchange procedure, which Ms. Stanley claims violated her\n963 rights under the *963 Fourth Amendment.[1] She contends that the jail's clothing-exchange policy subjected her\nto an intrusive strip search without regard to the particular charges against her (which she says were minor) or to\nher individual circumstances: she had no previous arrest record, an earlier pat-down search uncovered no\n\nweapons or other contraband, and jail officials had no suspicion that she was concealing any weapons or drugs.\nSubjecting her to a strip search on such grounds, she says, amounted to a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\nAfter the parties submitted a joint stipulation of facts and briefed their arguments, the district court granted\nsummary judgment in favor of the defendant officials. The court first held that while the clothing exchange\nprocedure employed by the Vigo County jail did constitute a search, it was not a \"strip search\" as the district court\ndefined that term. Stanley v. Gentry, 2002 WL 1821793, at *4, No. 00-0053-C-T/H, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14710,\nat *14 (S.D.Ind. Jun. 5, 2002). The court then found the search to be reasonable under the circumstances and\ntherefore constitutional. Id. at 2002 WL 1821793 at *6, *19.\nANALYSIS\nWe review the grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing all the facts in the light most favorable to the\nnonmoving party. See Doe v. Heck, 327 F.3d 492, 508 (7th Cir.2003).\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth\nAmendment's due process guarantee, protects individuals against unreasonable searches of their persons,\nhomes, and effects. See U.S. CONST. amend. IV. Included within the Amendment's protection is the right to be\nfree from unreasonable searches of one's unclothed body. See Doe v. Calumet City, Illinois, 754 F.Supp. 1211,\n1218 (N.D.Ill.1990) (recognizing that \"deeply imbedded in our culture ... is the belief that people have a\nreasonable expectation not to be unclothed involuntarily, to be observed unclothed or to have their `private' parts\nobserved or touched by others\"). While the Fourth Amendment generally requires that the issuance of a warrant,\nsupported by probable cause, precede any search, the Supreme Court has recognized several exceptions to the\nwarrant requirement, including so-called \"stationhouse\" searches of individuals arrested by the police. See Illinois\nv. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 645-46, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77 L.Ed.2d 65 (1983); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723\nF.2d 1263, 1270 (7th Cir.1983). As this Court has stated, however, \"custodial searches incident to arrest must still\nbe reasonable ones.... This type of police conduct must [still] be tested by the Fourth Amendment's general\nproscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.\" Id. at 1270-71 (quotations omitted).\nAs an initial matter, we address the question of whether the observed clothing-exchange process at issue in this\ncase was a \"strip search.\" In finding that Ms. Stanley had not been subjected to a \"strip search\" (rather, merely a\ngeneric \"search\") as that term had been used by this Court, the district court focused on the fact that she was\nnever fully naked during the clothing exchange00the jail's policy was to require inmates to remove clothing down\n97\nto their undergarments before donning the jail uniform00and that it was merely by chance that she was not\n97\n964 wearing a brassiere *964 at the time of her admission into the jail. In response, Ms. Stanley has brought to our\nattention a number of cases which define a strip search as something less than full nudity, see, e.g., Justice v.\nCity of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 190 (11th Cir.1992) (treating as a strip search the police order to \"strip down\nto her panties,\" with no inspection of body cavities), as well as the statutes defining a \"strip search\" from 14\nstates00all but two of which include within their definition an inspection of a person's undergarments. See, e.g.,\n97\n725 ILL. COMP. STAT. 5/103-1(d) (2003) (defining \"strip search\" as \"having an arrested person remove or\narrange some or all of his or her clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of the genitals, buttocks, anus,\nfemale breasts or undergarments of such person\" (emphasis added)).\nThe defendant officers contend that the clothing exchange was not a \"strip search\" but rather a \"routine security\nand admission procedure at a detention facility.\" (Appellee's Br. at 9.) The presence of a jail officer who\ncontinuously observed Ms. Stanley as she exchanged her clothing, however, suggests that this was more than an\nadministrative procedure for changing into a jail uniform; it implies that the officer's purpose was to watch over\nMs. Stanley to ensure that nothing illicit was brought into or out of the jail. See Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144,\n145 (7th Cir.1995) (noting that \"[o]bservation is a form of search\"); see also Heck, 327 F.3d at 510 (\"When the\nFourth Amendment was ratified, as now, to `search' meant `to look over or through for the purpose of finding\nsomething; to explore; to examine by inspection....'\" (quoting Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 33 n. 1, 121\nS.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001))). The observed clothing exchange thus must be viewed as a search (for\nweapons or other contraband) of Ms. Stanley. Whether we further label this process a \"strip search\" or merely a\n[2]\n\"search\" is unimportant, as the analysis remains the same.\n\nIn Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court identified the\nframework in which searches of pretrial detainees in custody are to be analyzed. In that case, the plaintiffs\nchallenged the detention facility's policy of conducting strip searches, including visual inspection of the inmates'\nbody cavities, following every contact visit with a person from outside of the facility. Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861.\nWhile acknowledging that \"this practice instinctively gives us the most pause,\" the Court held that such searches\nwere reasonable given the circumstances, and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In so holding, the\nCourt noted that balancing the \"significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the privacy\ninterests of the inmates\" led to the conclusion that such searches were fully consistent with the Constitution, even\nwhen based on less than probable cause. Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The Court then outlined a general test for\nreasonableness:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case, it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\n965 Id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (citations omitted). Because Ms. Stanley was a pretrial detainee *965 subject to a\nsearch, we turn to an examination of these factors as they relate to her case.\nWe first consider the nature of the intrusion involved. The district court called the intrusion \"narrow,\" describing\nkey aspects of the clothing exchange process:\nThough Ms. Stanley was required to expose her breasts, she remained partially clothed as she\nkept on her underpants at all times. There is nothing to suggest that anyone other than the jail\nofficer, of the same sex as Ms. Stanley, viewed her as she changed her clothes. So, the search\nwas conducted in private. The time of exposure was brief, and nothing about the observation\nsuggests that its purpose extended beyond monitoring the clothing exchange. Ms. Stanley was\nnot required to turn around or bend for a visual inspection; nor was she required to lift her breasts\nto allow inspection. She was not touched during the search.\nStanley, 2002 WL 1821793, at *5, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14710, at *15-16.\nWe believe the district court's characterization of the intrusion is sound. The scope of the intrusion here was not\nexcessive: Ms. Stanley was not required to disrobe completely (she was, in fact, allowed to keep her\nundergarments on; the fact that she was not wearing a brassiere, thus requiring her to expose her breasts, does\nnot by itself transform the exchange into a gross intrusion); she was allowed to undress in a semi-private setting\nwith only one same-sex officer present to witness the exchange; and she was not required to submit to a visual\ninspection of any body cavities or to any touching by the jail officer. The search was apparently conducted in a\nprofessional manner00Ms. Stanley was neither manhandled nor treated rudely at any point during the clothing\n97\nexchange. The search was conducted in a semi-private area00while there was no door to the room in which Ms.\n97\nStanley was required to disrobe, there was a video camera that appeared to be observing that area, and Ms.\nStanley was not allowed to disrobe behind the partial wall, there is no evidence that the setting for the clothing\nexchange allowed anyone other than the observing Officer Henson to witness Ms. Stanley disrobing.\nThe intrusion involved in this particular clothing exchange is thus distinguishable from the more intrusive\nsearches in the cases cited in the Stanleys' briefs. For example, in Mary Beth G., we held that the City of\nChicago's policy of subjecting women (but not men), who had been arrested and detained, to a strip search\nregardless of the charges against them or whether detention officers had any reasonable suspicion that a\nparticular woman was concealing weapons or other contraband, violated the Fourth Amendment. 723 F.2d at\n1273. In that case, the detainees were \"minor offenders who were not inherently dangerous and who were being\n[3]\ndetained only briefly while awaiting bond.\" Id. at 1272. Despite this, the City's policy required visual inspections\nof the women's anal and genital cavities, a practice the Court called \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified,\nhumiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.\" Id. (quotation\nomitted). We ultimately held that such a policy violated the Fourth Amendment: \"In light of the substantial nature\n\n966 of the intrusions involved, we believe *966 these differences [from the searches upheld by the Supreme Court in \nBell v. Wolfish] are sufficiently significant to compel our own inquiry as to whether the strip searches conducted\nby the City were `reasonable' under the fourth amendment.\" Id. (emphasis added). In contrast to the searches\nconducted in Mary Beth G., Ms. Stanley was subjected only to a two-minute observation by one same-sex officer\nwhile she changed clothes. She was not required to remove her undergarments (had she been wearing a\nbrassiere, she could have left it on), subjected to any inspection of her body cavities, or touched by jail officers. \nSee also Stanley, 2002 WL 1821793 at *3-4, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14710, at *9-13 (distinguishing other cases\ncited by Stanley).\nAgainst this relatively minimal intrusion into the privacy interest held by Ms. Stanley, we balance the justifications\nfor conducting the particular search challenged here. See Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272 (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at\n559, 99 S.Ct. 1861). The Vigo County defendants offer two reasons for the clothing exchange policy: first, the\nneed to prevent the introduction of weapons or contraband into the jail population, and second, the need to\ninventory a detainee's clothing and personal effects. We note that when considering the justifications offered by\nthe jail, we are to give the decisions of prison officials substantial (though not complete) deference: \"Prison\nadministrators therefore should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies\nand practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain\ninstitutional security.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (quotations omitted).\nFirst, the defendant officers emphasize the need for observed clothing exchanges to \"minimize risk to offenders\nand security personnel. This includes the confiscation of weapons and contraband that might pose a serious risk\nto others in a jail.\" (Appellee's Br. at 8.) The Vigo County Jail policy on searches notes that, \"Searches may be\nunpleasant, but are necessary to control and locate contraband which may have entered the jail. Staff should\nconsider every inmate as a potential carrier of contraband.\" (Pl. Comp. Exhibit C at 1.) Maintaining institutional\nsecurity as well as the safety of jail officers and inmates has been recognized as a significant interest and valid\njustification for strip searches. The Supreme Court has observed that a \"detention facility is a unique place\nfraught with serious security dangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too\ncommon an occurrence.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The Court also noted that, \"maintaining\ninstitutional security and preserving internal order and discipline are essential goals that may require limitation or\nretraction of the retained constitutional rights of both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees.\" Id. at 546, 99\nS.Ct. 1861. This Court has joined in these observations, concluding that \"the need to assure jail security is a\nlegitimate and substantial concern.\" Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273. We believe that the observed clothing-\nexchange policy employed by the jail is a rational approach to achieving the objective of preventing the\nsmuggling of weapons or other contraband into (or, for that matter, out of) the general jail population00a rather\n97\nsubstantial concern given the nature of the jail system.\nAs for the second justification offered by the defendant officials, the practice of inventorying the clothing and other\npersonal effects of a detainee before committing that person to the general jail population has also been held\n967 constitutional by the United States Supreme Court. See Lafayette,*967 462 U.S. at 648, 103 S.Ct. 2605. The\ndefendant officials here contend that continuous observation of a detainee as he or she changes into a jail\nuniform is required to ensure that a full and complete inventory is accomplished00otherwise, they argue, a\n97\ndetainee may simply transfer certain items from their street clothes to the jail uniform. While we agree that\nensuring a complete inventory is an important goal, we believe this justification is not as significant as the first.\nEffective inventories may well be accomplished without the need for continuous observation. In any event, this\njustification, while less persuasive than the need to preserve jail security, nonetheless adds to the case justifying\nthe intrusion involved in an observed clothing exchange.\nFinally, in balancing the relatively minimal intrusion suffered by Ms. Stanley against the justifications offered by\nthe defendants, we agree with the district court that the search here was reasonable. Ms. Stanley disagrees with\nthis balancing, however, arguing that while the justifications may be valid, the intrusion she suffered in this case\n(even if narrow), viewed in light of the circumstances of her arrest, bore no reasonable relationship to promoting\n[4]\nthose interests.  She contends that, as a first-time offender, arrested on a relatively minor charge, who gave\nneither the police nor the jail officials any reason to suspect she was concealing weapons or other contraband,\nthe jail officials could not have had probable cause or even a reasonable suspicion that she would present some\nsort of danger once admitted to the jail population. Without some reason to suspect such a threat, she continues,\n\nthe officers were not justified in engaging in the search. See, e.g., Jones v. Bowman, 694 F.Supp. 538, 545\n(N.D.Ind.1988) (\"Without reasonable articulable grounds to suspect a pretrial detainee brought in on a minor\ncharge is secreting contraband on their person, a strip search is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\").\nThis Court has noted that \"[t]he more intrusive the search, the closer governmental authorities must come to\ndemonstrating probable cause for believing that the search will uncover the objects for which the search is being\nconducted.\" Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273. We have already noted that we find the intrusion here to be\nrelatively minimal. Against that, we note that jail officials must view any person entering the jail system with at\nleast a minimal amount of suspicion00especially someone just brought in on a charge of battery on a police officer\n97\n(we question whether such a charge can ever be called \"minor\"), when officials may have little information at the\ntime regarding the circumstances giving rise to the arrest. Given this, we believe that the relatively narrow\nintrusion involved in an observed clothing exchange like the one at issue in this case does not tip the scales in\nfavor of finding such a procedure unreasonable and unconstitutional.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Vigo County Jail's observed clothing-exchange procedure is a reasonably and fairly designed process for\npromoting the legitimate goals of institutional security and accurate inventories. Our review of the particular\nclothing exchange conducted with respect to Ms. Stanley leads us to conclude that the relatively narrow intrusion\nto which she was subjected was outweighed by the jail's needs. We find that the search was reasonable and\n968 therefore *968 did not violate Ms. Stanley's Fourth Amendment rights. Summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendants is AFFIRMED.\n[1] As the district court correctly noted, Laurence Stanley's claim (apparently for loss of consortium caused by the\ndistress suffered by his wife) is entirely dependent on the success of his wife's claim.\n[2] Whether the procedure at issue here was a \"strip search\" or just a \"search\" more appropriately goes to the\nquestion of the scope or manner of the intrusion involved.\n[3] Two of the named plaintiffs in the case had been detained after being stopped for traffic violations, when\npolice learned that they each had outstanding parking tickets. A third named plaintiff was detained for making an\nimproper left turn and then failing to produce her driver's license. Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1267 n. 2.\n[4] Ms. Stanley especially objects to the observed clothing exchange performed before she left the jail. We note\nthat smuggling contraband out of a jail may present security concerns as great as those arising from smuggling\ncontraband into a jail setting.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
