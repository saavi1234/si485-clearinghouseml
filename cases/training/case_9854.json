    "summary": "<p>On April 13, 1995, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 12, ยงยง 11H and 11I against police lieutenant, police officer, and the Town of North Reading in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.  Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked for compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that the officer's strip search, pursuant to the lieutenant's orders, violated her constitutional rights.  Plaintiff alleged that the town had a policy of conscious indifference to the legal rights of arrestees.</p><p>On May 18, 1993, police stopped Plaintiff and her boyfriend for shoplifting.  Police allegedly saw Plaintiff drop a bag of marijuana on the ground.  Plaintiff was patted down, and then brought to the police station.  An officer pat-frisked Plaintiff and found rolling papers.  Defendant-Lieutenant tried to interrogate her.  She refused to answer him, and the Lieutenant became angry.  The Lieutenant then ordered Defendant-Officer to search Plaintiff.  Plaintiff was strip searched and subjected to a visual body cavity search.  Plaintiff's boyfriend was not strip-searched.  </p><p>On July 5, 1996, the United States District Court (Judge George A. O'Toole, Jr.) granted summary judgment for Defendants.  The court held: (1) the search was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment because an officer saw Plaintiff try to discard marijuana and found rolling papers in her purse, (2) Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, and Defendant Lieutenant's subjective purpose in ordering Plaintiff's strip search was irrelevant to this inquiry, (3) search did not violate Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because this standard was the same as the federal standard, and (4) Plaintiff failed to show that the Town was deliberately indifferent to her rights.  Swain v. Spinney, 932 F.Supp. 25 (D. Mass. 1996).</p><p>On June 25, 1997, the First Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges Sandra Lynch, Norman H. Stahl, and Hugh H. Bownes) affirmed summary judgment for the Town and reversed summary judgment for Defendant Officer and Lieutenant.  The Court held: (1) A jury could find that Defendants did not have the required reasonable suspicion that Plaintiff concealed contraband in order to strip-search Plaintiff.  (2) Issues of fact as to basis for search precluded summary judgment for Defendants Lieutenant and Officer.  Defendant Lieutenant may have ordered the strip search in retaliation for Plaintiff not cooperating during her interrogation because Plaintiff was allowed to use the bathroom unobserved before being searched, Plaintiff's search was not justified by institutional security because she was the only person in her cell, and her boyfriend was not searched despite his criminal record.  (3)  Town was not liable under ยง 1983 for alleged failure to train police because the Town gave officers policy guidelines stating that they could only strip-search arrestees if they had probable cause to believe arrestee concealed contraband and a search warrant was required for a body cavity search.  (4) Massachusetts search and seizure provision did not provide less protection than federal constitution.  (5) Lieutenant's conduct could count as \"intimidation\" or \"coercion\" within meaning of Massachusetts civil rights statute.</p><p>Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997).</p><p>The case settled and was dismissed on September 19, 1997.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "117 F.3d 1 (1997)\nKelli SWAIN, Plaintiff, Appellant,\nv.\nLaura SPINNEY, Edward Hayes, and the Town of North Reading, Defendants, Appellees.\nNo. 96-2035.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, First Circuit.\nHeard February 5, 1997.\nDecided June 25, 1997.\n2 *2 Michael Tyler, with whom Michael Edward Casey, Beverly, MA, was on brief, for appellant.\nDouglas I. Louison, Boston, MA, with whom Regina M. Gilgun and Merrick & Louison were on brief, for appellees.\nBefore STAHL, Circuit Judge, BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge, and LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.\nKelli Swain was subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity inspection, while being held in a cell in the\nNorth Reading, Massachusetts police station. This search occurred after Swain had been in the cell for twenty\nminutes, and more than an hour after she was arrested. She was arrested with her boyfriend as a result of his\nshoplifting; she was suspected of having possessed a small baggie of marijuana. The search was ordered, she\nsays, by a police officer immediately after he had interrogated her, while knowing she was represented by\ncounsel. He had become angry with Swain for saying she knew nothing about her boyfriend's shoplifting. Swain's\nboyfriend, who was also in custody, whose shoplifting had triggered the arrests, and who had an extensive\ncriminal record, including drug crimes, was not stripsearched. The charges against Swain were eventually nol\nprossed.\nSwain brought suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, ยงยง 11H, 11I, alleging that the search\nhumiliated her and caused lasting emotional damage. The district court granted summary judgment for the\ndefendants. The court held that there were no material facts in dispute which would support Swain's claims that\nthe search was not reasonable under the Fourth Amendment and that the officers were not entitled to immunity.\nWe hold that, as alleged by Swain, a jury could find that the search was not justified by a reasonable suspicion,\nand that the jury should have the opportunity to resolve the factual disputes pertinent to the issue of whether the\nofficers were entitled to the protections of qualified immunity. Swain fails, however, to meet the exacting\nstandards for municipal liability under ยง 1983, even on her version of the facts. Accordingly, the judgment of the\ndistrict court with respect to the individual defendants is reversed, but the grant of summary judgment as to the\nTown of North Reading is affirmed.\nI.\nWe review the facts in the light most favorable to Swain, the party opposing summary judgment. On May 18,\n1993, Kelli Swain and her boyfriend, Christopher Milbury, went apartment hunting in the Danvers, Massachusetts\narea. Around 10:00 a.m., after the couple had been driving for a little while, Milbury told Swain that he needed to\npick up some things at Moynihan Lumber. Swain waited in the car while Milbury went into the store; he was gone\nabout ten minutes. When Milbury got back, he placed a bag behind the seat and started to leave the parking lot.\n3 As they drove out of the *3 parking lot, Swain saw Moynihan Lumber employees pointing at the car; she also saw\na police cruiser pulling into the lot just as she and Milbury were pulling out.\nSwain became very upset. She began questioning Milbury about what was going on. Then, after they had driven\n200 or 300 yards, the police cruiser, which had been following the couple since the parking lot, turned on its blue\nlights and its siren; Milbury pulled their car over. Officer Robert Marchionda then approached the vehicle and\n\nMilbury got out of the car. Swain remained in the car for a minute or two, and then got out when she saw Milbury\nbeing handcuffed. As Swain got out, she dropped a baggie of marijuana on the ground about three feet away\nfrom the car. Officer Marchionda had seen Swain put her hands behind her back and drop an object onto the\ngrass, but could not, at that point, identify the object. Officer Marchionda radioed for backup, and another officer,\nOfficer Romeo, arrived soon thereafter. Swain then approached the officers, but was stopped by one of them,\nwho restrained her with his hands. She asked what was going on, and was told that Milbury was suspected of\ntaking things from Moynihan Lumber. Officer Marchionda then arrested Swain and handcuffed her. While he was\nhandcuffing her, he saw that the dropped object was a baggie of marijuana. He retrieved it. Swain was pat frisked\nat the scene, but nothing was found on her person.\nWhen the police searched the car, they found $400 worth of hardware in the trunk, which had been taken from\nanother store in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and another $400 worth of sawblades, wrapped in a hardware flyer,\nunder the front seat. Swain was surprised to see the merchandise there. The police implied that she was an\naccomplice to Milbury's theft; she kept saying that she did not know anything about it. Milbury also told the police\nthat Swain was innocent.\nNeither of the officers ever asked her about the marijuana on the ground. Swain did not see anyone pick up the\nmarijuana and did not know if anyone had seen her drop it.\nAfter about thirty minutes at the scene, Swain and Milbury were transported in a police cruiser to the North\nReading Police Station. When she got to the station, her handcuffs were removed. Swain was seated at a\nbooking desk, and an officer had her sign a rights card. Matron Laura Spinney, the chief of police's secretary, was\ncalled to the booking desk because a female was under arrest.\nWhile in the booking area, Swain asked to go to the bathroom. Matron Spinney escorted her to a bathroom, but\ndid not come in with her. Swain was allowed to close the door almost all of the way, leaving it open just a little.\nSpinney stood outside the door to the room, where she could hear Swain using the facilities, but could not see\nSwain.\nSwain then returned to the booking area, and was told that she could make a phone call. She was shown to a\nsmall office, and a police officer stood outside. She called her attorney and spoke with him for five to ten minutes.\nWhile Swain was seated in the booking area, her pocketbook was searched by Spinney. Spinney found cigarette\nrolling papers in the pocketbook. No one discussed these papers with Swain. At that point, one of the officers\nadvised Swain that marijuana had been found at the scene and that she was going to be charged in connection\nwith it. Swain denied that it was her marijuana.\nSwain was then fingerprinted and photographed. Officer Ed Hayes, the prosecuting officer and detective\ndepartment supervisor, ordered Matron Spinney to take Swain to a cell. Spinney pat frisked Swain before taking\nher to the cell and found nothing on her. Swain was left alone in the cell for about twenty minutes. According to\nSwain, Sergeant Hayes then came to her cell and attempted to question her about Milbury's criminal activities.\nHayes yelled at Swain, telling her that she was lying, and that she should tell him what was going on. Swain, who\nwas crying hysterically, kept repeating that she honestly knew nothing. According to Swain, Hayes' questioning\nlasted approximately fifteen minutes and then he \"walked out in a huff.\"\nHayes states that he only stayed with Swain in the cell area for approximately one minute. He has no recollection\n4 of what he *4 discussed with Swain, but asserts that it would be normal procedure for him to talk to detainees to\nadvise them about their arraignments. He does not recall interrogating Swain about Milbury's activities, but\ncannot state that he did not do so. Milbury, who was located in another cell where he could hear but not see\nSwain, stated that he heard Hayes talking to her and also heard Swain crying and saying that she was innocent.\nAbout five to ten minutes after Hayes' departure, Spinney returned and apologetically informed Swain that Hayes\nhad ordered her to strip search Swain. It is Hayes' testimony that he believes he would have ordered such a\nsearch prior to speaking with Swain. Spinney does not know whether the search was ordered before or after\nHayes spoke with Swain, but knows that Hayes did not order a strip search when he originally told Spinney to\ntake Swain to the cell. Spinney states, however, that the order to strip search came almost immediately after she\nbrought Swain to the cell, and not a significant amount of time later.\n\nSwain could not understand why she was being searched and began crying again. Spinney then ordered Swain\nto remove all of her clothing except for her bra. Spinney shook out each item as Swain took it off. Spinney then\nmade Swain bend over and spread her buttocks. Swain was very upset and shaking uncontrollably the entire\ntime. Swain was then told she could get dressed. Spinney found nothing during her search. The entire procedure\nlasted fifteen minutes. Hayes had not told Spinney what to look for, but Spinney knew that marijuana had been\nfound at the scene, and assumed that she was looking for drugs.\nSwain asserts that, before she was asked to strip, Spinney assured Swain that the video camera in the cell area\nwas already off. Swain did not see her turn the camera off. Chief of Police Henry Purnell testified, however, that\nthe station cameras, including the one in the female cell, are constantly left on. Videotapes are sometimes made\nfrom these cameras, but the Department has no policies or procedures concerning the making, storage, or\nretention of these tapes. Matrons are instructed to turn the cell camera off, by pressing a button, when conducting\na search. Spinney states that she turned the camera off with a wall switch before searching Swain, but does not\nrecall telling Swain that the camera was off or making any comments about the camera at all.\nMilbury, who had an extensive criminal record, was never strip searched. Hayes was aware of Milbury's history of\ndrug convictions and knew that Milbury was on probation, having pulled the records while booking Milbury. Swain\nhad no prior criminal convictions.\nOfficer Hayes, for his part, tells a different story. He asserts that he ordered the strip search of Swain immediately\nupon his arrival at the booking desk, which occurred as soon as he was informed that the arrests had been\nmade, and, he believes, before he spoke with her. According to Hayes, he ordered the search because the\narresting officer showed him the marijuana and informed him that Swain was a principal suspect in a narcotics\nincident. He also asserts that he suspected Swain of carrying a concealed weapon, although he acknowledges\nthat this was a generalized suspicion of narcotics suspects, rather than a suspicion based on any characteristics\nof Swain.\nLater that day, Milbury and Swain were arraigned in Woburn District Court and released on their own\nrecognizance. All charges against Swain were eventually \"nol prossed\" or continued without a finding. Swain\nsuffered continuing emotional trauma as a result of the search and sought counseling.\nThe Town of North Reading's policy on strip searches is outlined in a memo on \"Inventory Search Policy,\"\nprepared in 1989 by training officer Lieutenant Edward Nolan. The Policy states that: \"A strip search of the\narrestee is warranted only if the police have probable cause to believe that the arrestee is concealing contraband\nor weapons on his body.\" Chief Purnell testified that, in any arrest involving drugs, all arrestees are strip\nsearched. The shift commander 00 normally the highest-ranking officer on duty 00 makes the determination of\n97 97\nwhen a strip search is warranted.\n5 *5 The Municipal Police Institute (MPI), a statewide police association, publishes a book called \"Police Manual:\nPolicies & Procedures.\" Chief Purnell testified that the North Reading police adhere to the MPI policies. The\nrelevant MPI policy is as follows:\nA strip search of an arrestee is warranted only if officers have reasonable suspicion to believe that\nthe arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons on his body.\n1. All body strip-searches must be approved by the officer-in-charge, who shall consider the\nfollowing question:\nIs the crime one that is normally associated with weapons or contraband?\nOnly if the answer to this question is yes and there is a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee has\nweapons or contraband on his person will a body strip-search be authorized.\n2. Body cavity searches should not be conducted without the express approval of the officer-in-\ncharge, and require a search warrant signed by a judge.\n\nHowever, both Sergeant Hayes and Matron Spinney testified that they were unaware that North Reading had any\npolicy with regard to strip searches. Hayes testified that it was his policy to strip search individuals whenever\nnarcotics were involved in the case. Nonetheless, he did not order a strip search of Milbury.\nII.\nSwain claims, under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, ยงยง 11H, 11I, that Laura Spinney, Edward\nHayes, and the Town of North Reading violated her rights under the United States and Massachusetts\nConstitutions by subjecting her to an unreasonable search. On defendants' motion for summary judgment, the\ndistrict court held that, under United States v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296 (1st Cir.1975), the search of Swain was within\nthe bounds of the Fourth Amendment. It thought Klein unaffected by Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861,\n60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). The district court further held that the individual defendants were, in any event, entitled to\nqualified immunity from suit. As to the Massachusetts law claims, the court found that, in this area,\nMassachusetts constitutional law tracked the federal standards. Finally, the district court found that Swain had\nfailed to meet the exacting standards for municipal liability under ยง 1983.\nSwain argues on appeal that the police must have probable cause to believe that an arrestee is concealing\nweapons or contraband in order to strip search that arrestee. She further argues that, even if the search needed\nonly to be supported by a reasonable suspicion, no such suspicion was present and that the officers are thus not\nentitled to the protections of qualified immunity.\nWe review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. EEOC v. Amego, Inc., 110 F.3d 135, 141 (1st\nCir.1997).\nIII.\nA strip and visual body cavity search of an arrestee must be justified, at the least, by a reasonable suspicion.\nBecause a jury could find that Officer Hayes acted without a reasonable suspicion that Swain was concealing\ndrugs or weapons, we find that Swain has stated a claim against the individual defendants sufficient to withstand\na motion for summary judgment. Furthermore, while some courts have suggested that a higher standard may be\nnecessary to justify a strip search and visual body cavity inspection, it was clearly established at the time of the\nsearch that the Fourth Amendment requires at least a reasonable suspicion to conduct these types of searches.\nSignificant factual disputes remain, rendering it impossible to resolve conclusively the immunity question on\nsummary judgment.\nA. Strip Searches, Visual Body Cavity Inspections, and the Fourth\nAmendment\n\"[I]n the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant\nrequirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a `reasonable' search under that amendment.\" United States v.\nRobinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). Thus, under Robinson, if the arrest was\n6 lawful, a *6 searching officer does not need to have any further justification for performing a full body search of an\narrestee. See United States v. Bizier, 111 F.3d 214, 217 (1st Cir. 1997). Moreover, a search incident to arrest\nneed not occur at the scene of the arrest, but \"may legally be conducted later when the accused arrives at the\nplace of detention.\" United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 803, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 1237, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974).\nHowever, Robinson did not hold that all possible searches of an arrestee's body are automatically permissible as\na search incident to arrest. To the contrary, any such search must still be reasonable:\nHolding the Warrant Clause inapplicable to the circumstances present here does not leave law\nenforcement officials subject to no restraints. This type of police conduct \"must [still] be tested by\nthe Fourth Amendment's general proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.\"\n\nEdwards, 415 U.S. at 808 n. 9, 94 S.Ct. at 1239 n. 9 (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879,\n20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). In Robinson itself, the Court noted that the search at issue, while thorough, did not have\n\"extreme or patently abusive characteristics.\" 414 U.S. at 236, 94 S.Ct. at 477 (citing Rochin v. California, 342\nU.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952)). Later, in Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 103 S.Ct. 2605, 77\nL.Ed.2d 65 (1983), the Court explicitly stated that \"[w]e were not addressing in Edwards, and do not discuss here,\nthe circumstances in which a strip search of an arrestee may or may not be appropriate.\" Id. at 646 n. 2, 103\nS.Ct. at 2609 n. 2. \"Robinson simply did not authorize\" a strip and visual body cavity search. Fuller v. M.G.\nJewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1446 (9th Cir. 1991); see also Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1271 (7th\nCir. 1983)(\"[T]he Robinson court simply did not contemplate the significantly greater intrusions that occur[]\" in a\nvisual body cavity inspection.).\nA strip and visual body cavity search thus requires independent analysis under the Fourth Amendment. In Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), the Supreme Court noted that \"[t]he test of\nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.\" Id.\nat 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. Rather, the evaluation of the constitutionality of a warrantless search\nrequires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights\nthat the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in\nwhich it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\nId. In Wolfish, the Supreme Court applied this balancing test to a prison policy that required arraigned pre-trial\ndetainees to \"expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every\ncontact visit with a person from outside the institution.\" Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. Noting that \"this practice\ninstinctively gives [the Court] the most pause,\" id. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, the Court found only that visual body\ncavity searches can \"be conducted on less than probable cause.\" Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. In so holding, \nWolfish \"did not, however, read out of the Constitution the provision of general application that a search be\njustified as reasonable under the circumstances.\" Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 800 (2d Cir.1986).\nIn applying the Wolfish balancing test to searches of the type to which Swain was subjected, courts have\nrecognized that strip and visual body cavity searches impinge seriously upon the values that the Fourth\nAmendment was meant to protect. These searches require an arrestee not only to strip naked in front of a\nstranger, but also to expose the most private areas of her body to others. This is often, as here, done while the\nperson arrested is required to assume degrading and humiliating positions. Our circuit has \"recognize[d], as have\nall courts that have considered the issue, the severe if not gross interference with a person's privacy that occurs\nwhen guards conduct a visual inspection of body cavities.\" Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 887 (1st Cir.1983). The\nSeventh Circuit has described \"strip searches involving the visual inspection of the anal and genital areas as\n7 demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, *7 embarrassing, repulsive, signifying\ndegradation and submission.\" Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1272 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Wood\nv. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[A] strip search can hardly be characterized as a routine procedure\nor as a minimally invasive means of maintaining prison security. Indeed, a strip search, by its very nature,\nconstitutes an extreme intrusion upon personal privacy, as well as an offense to the dignity of the individual.\"); \nKennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 702, 711 (9th Cir.1990)(\"Strip searches involving the visual\nexploration of body cavities are dehumanizing and humiliating.\").\nOn the other side of the scales, courts must weigh the legitimate needs of law enforcement. Institutional security\nhas been found to be a compelling reason for conducting warrantless strip and visual body cavity searches. See,\ne.g., Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884 (prisoner strip searches after contact visits justified because\ndetention facility \"is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers\"). Some courts have held that a\nwarrantless strip search may also be justified by the need to discover and preserve concealed evidence of a\ncrime. See, e.g., Justice v. Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 193 (11th Cir.1992). But see Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446\n(strip and visual body cavity search with less than probable cause only permitted to protect institutional safety\nand security; search for evidence must be justified by probable cause).\nBalancing these interests, courts have concluded that, to be reasonable under Wolfish, strip and visual body\ncavity searches must be justified by at least a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing contraband or\n\n[1]\nweapons. See, e.g, Justice, 961 F.2d at 192; Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989); Weber,\n804 F.2d at 802; Stewart v. Lubbock County, 767 F.2d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614,\n615 (9th Cir.1984); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1273. This court has held that the reasonable suspicion standard is\nthe appropriate one for justifying strip searches in other contexts. See Wood, 89 F.3d at 929 (prison visitors); \nUnited States v. Uricoechea-Casallas, 946 F.2d 162, 166 (1st Cir.1991)(non-routine border searches); cf. Burns v.\nLoranger, 907 F.2d 233, 236-38 (1st Cir.1990) (officers protected by qualified immunity for warrantless strip\nsearch of arrestee where there were exigent circumstances and probable cause to believe controlled substance\nwould be found on arrestee's person). Accordingly, it is clear that at least the reasonable suspicion standard\ngoverns strip and visual body cavity searches in the arrestee context as well.\nDefendants, and the court below, rely upon United States v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296 (1st Cir.1975). In that case, the\ndefendant, who was arrested after a sale of cocaine, was subjected to a strip search, including a visual inspection\nof his rectum. Id. at 299. This court approved that search as \"[a] post-arrest search of the person, plainly\napproved by Edwards,\" and found that a lack of individualized suspicion that the suspect was harboring evidence\ndid not render the search unreasonable. Id. at 300 & n. 2.\nKlein was decided before significant Supreme Court precedent in the area, and we are bound by the Supreme\nCourt's developing doctrine. Klein predates Lafayette, decided in 1983, where the Supreme Court stated that \nEdwards did not answer the question of when a strip search was appropriate. Lafayette, 462 U.S. at 646 n. 2,\n103 S.Ct. at 2609 n. 2. Klein also predated Wolfish, with its explicit recognition of the invasiveness of strip and\nvisual body cavity searches. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. Subsequent to Klein, and sensitive to the\ndeveloping doctrine, this circuit has repeatedly recognized that strip and/or visual body cavity searches are not\nroutine, and must be carefully evaluated. See Burns, 907 F.2d at 236-37; Bonitz v. Fair, 804 F.2d 164, 170-72 (1st\nCir.1986); Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 564 (1st Cir.1985); Arruda, 710 F.2d at 887. Accordingly, to the\nextent that Klein held that strip and visual body cavity searches are simply searches incident to arrest, and do not\n8 need to be further tested for *8 reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, it does not survive Lafayette,\nWolfish, and this court's subsequent strip search decisions.\nB. The Search of Swain\nTurning to the particular search at issue, we conclude, taking all the facts in the light most favorable to Swain,\nthat a jury could find that the search was unreasonable and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, we\nfind that Swain has stated a trialworthy claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. On these facts, there appears to be the\ndistinct possibility that Officer Hayes ordered the strip search in retaliation for his failed interrogation of Swain in\nher cell, imposing sexual humiliation on her as a punishment for what he perceived as her non-cooperation.\nHayes' angry response to Swain's inability to provide information about Milbury's activities and the timing of the\nsearch raise this inference. This possibility distinguishes this case from Klein, where the court found that there\n[2]\nwas \"no evidence that the stripping was a pretext to humiliate or degrade.\" Klein, 522 F.2d at 300.\nWe must thus examine whether, on these facts, an objective officer would have had a reasonable suspicion that\nSwain was concealing drugs or contraband on her person. Three factors suggest that there were not adequate\ngrounds to justify the strip and visual body cavity search of Swain. First, there is the timing of the search. Swain\nhad been alone in the cell for some period of time before she was searched and no one thought it important to\nsearch her before she angered Hayes by not giving him the information he sought. Perhaps more importantly,\nshe had been allowed to go to the bathroom by herself, unobserved, prior to being taken to her cell. This also\nindicates that no one thought she had secreted drugs in her private parts. Cf. Burns, 907 F.2d at 238 (common\nknowledge that drug users and dealers with controlled substances on their persons often attempt to flush drugs\ndown the toilet). If a warrantless strip search may be justified by the need to avoid the destruction of concealed\nevidence, Swain already had had ample opportunity to destroy any such evidence. To the extent there was any\nreason to believe such evidence still existed, further delay to obtain a warrant would not have significantly\nincreased the risk of destruction. This was particularly true because Swain was kept under observation and\nrecorded by video camera while in the holding cell.\n\nSecond, as noted, the most compelling justification for warrantless strip and visual body cavity searches is\ninstitutional security. It is uncontroverted that, prior to her arraignment, Swain was the only person in the women's\nholding cell of the North Reading Police Station. Her arraignment was later the same afternoon, and she was\nthen released, on her own recognizance. There was no risk that she would come into contact with other\nprisoners, or be able to smuggle contraband or weapons into a secure environment. Hayes stated that he\nbelieved that Swain, as a narcotics suspect, might have been carrying a concealed weapon but he did not assert\nthat Swain posed a threat to his safety or that of others in the police station. The institutional security justification\nthus appears to be absent from this case.\nThird, there is the differential treatment by the police of the young woman and her boyfriend. Swain and Milbury\nwere first pulled over because of Milbury's shoplifting activities. Officer Hayes stated that, prior to searching\n9 Swain, he had examined both *9 Swain's and Milbury's records. Officer Hayes knew that Milbury was on\nprobation and had a history of drug convictions. By contrast, Swain did not have a criminal record. Milbury had\ntold officers, including Hayes, that the marijuana was his. Yet Milbury was not strip searched. If there was an\nobjective basis 00 apart from retaliation 00 for stripping Swain, it would have been objectively reasonable, and\n97 97\nmore so, to search Milbury as well.\nOn the other hand, Swain did drop a baggie of marijuana at the scene of the crime. Officer Hayes expressed the\nview (belied by his failure to strip search Milbury) that a strip search was justified whenever narcotics are involved\nin the case. This is not consistent with either the Town policy, which requires probable cause, or the MPI policy,\nwhich requires an individualized suspicion, even where the crime involves contraband or weapons. The record\ndoes not reveal how much marijuana was in the baggie Swain dropped, nor does it reveal whether possession of\nthat amount constitutes a misdemeanor or a felony under Massachusetts law. Nothing in the record suggests that\nSwain was suspected of being a distributor of marijuana. The fact that Swain may have possessed some\nunspecified amount of marijuana is not enough to overcome, as a matter of law, the factors, discussed above,\nunder which a jury could find the search of Swain unreasonable.\nAccordingly, we hold that a jury could lawfully find that there was no objectively reasonable basis for strip\nsearching Swain and that, on these facts, Swain has stated a claim for violation of her Fourth Amendment right to\nbe free from unreasonable searches that survives defendants' motion for summary judgment.\nC. Qualified Immunity\nDefendants assert that they are, in any event, entitled to qualified immunity from suit. There are two prongs to the\nqualified immunity analysis. First, was the constitutional right in question clearly established at the time of the\nalleged violation? St. Hilaire v. Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1995). That is a question of law for the court. Elder\nv. Holloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516, 114 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 344 (1994). Second, would a reasonable,\nsimilarly situated official understand that the challenged conduct violated that established right? St. Hilaire, 71\nF.3d at 24.\nThe Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable strip searches has long been clearly established in\nthis circuit, as elsewhere. See Burns, 907 F.2d at 236; Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 569 (\"It can hardly be debated that\n... in 1977, [there was] a `clearly established' Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches.\"). As\ndiscussed above, Klein's holding that such a search is a reasonable search incident to arrest had been abrogated\nby subsequent Supreme Court and First Circuit cases, and had been squarely rejected by the other circuit courts\nto consider the issue. See Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446, 1449 n. 11 (holding that strip search with visual body cavity\ninspection was not justifiable as a search incident to arrest but was governed by higher standard, and rejecting \nKlein); Mary Beth G., 723 F.2d at 1271 n. 7 (searches like the one in Klein are only constitutional where there is a\nreasonable belief that arrestee is concealing contraband; routine post-arrest strip search of misdemeanants is\nunconstitutional); see also Weber, 804 F.2d at 801 nn. 6 & 7, 803 (holding that it was, in 1986, \"clearly\nestablished\" that policy of routine strip and visual body cavity searches of arrestees was unconstitutional, and\nciting \"ten opinions from seven circuits\" that refused to condone such searches). Defendants themselves agree\nthat the search must be evaluated under the reasonableness standard articulated by the 1979 Supreme Court\ndecision in Wolfish.\n\nThe question is thus whether an objectively reasonable officer would understand that a strip search of Swain\nwas, under these circumstances, unreasonable. This prong of the inquiry, while requiring a legal determination, is\nhighly fact specific, and may not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment when material facts are\nsubstantially in dispute. 2 Nahmod, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Litigation: The Law of Section 1983 ยง 8.08, at\n136-39 (3d ed.1991).\n10 *10 The ultimate question of whether a reasonable police officer, on the basis of information\nknown to him, could have believed his actions were in accord with constitutional rights is a\nquestion of law, subject to resolution by the judge not the jury. But if there is a factual dispute, that\nfactual dispute must be resolved by a fact finder.\nSt. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 24 n. 1 (internal citations omitted); Figueroa-Rodriguez v. Aquino, 863 F.2d 1037, 1041 (1st\nCir. 1988)(\"While the qualified immunity inquiry is ultimately a question of law, it may also necessitate determining\ncertain of the essential facts.\")(citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523\n(1987)); see also Consolo v. George, 58 F.3d 791, 794 (1st Cir.) (where law is clearly established, and there is\nample evidence that officers acted unreasonably, proper to submit issue of objective reasonableness to the jury\non special interrogatories), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 520, 133 L.Ed.2d 428 (1995).\nWe recognize that the immunity question should be resolved, where possible, in advance of trial. See, e.g., \nVeilleux v. Perschau, 101 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1996). However, disposition of the question on summary judgment is\nnot always possible. Here, some material facts are significantly in dispute. Swain's story and that of Officer Hayes\nconflict on the timing of the relevant events. Some proffers are supported or contradicted by other witnesses,\nincluding Spinney and Milbury. Hayes contends that, as the officer in charge of the investigation, he ordered the\nsearch immediately upon being informed that a narcotics violation had occurred. The timing of when the search\nwas ordered is essential to a determination of whether defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable. There\nare thus factual issues, potentially turning on credibility, that must be resolved by the trier of fact. Only after the\n[3]\nresolution of these conflicts may the trial court apply the relevant law on objective reasonableness.\nWe also recognize that police officers are protected in close cases by the doctrine of qualified immunity, and that\nimmunity serves to protect law enforcement from the chilling threat of liability. Vargas-Badillo v. Diaz-Torres, 114\nF.3d 3, (1st Cir.1997); Joyce v. Town of Tewksbury, 112 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.1997) (patent violation of law\nnecessary to strip police officers of qualified immunity). On the other hand, qualified immunity does not protect\n\"those who knowingly violate the law.\" Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1096, 89 L.Ed.2d 271\n(1986). Here, further resolution of the facts is necessary to determine whether or not this case falls into the\ncategory of \"close cases\" in which the police are accorded \"a fairly wide zone of protection.\" Roy v. Inhabitants of\nthe City of Lewiston, 42 F.3d 691, 695 (1st Cir.1994). On the facts as related by Swain, Officer Hayes used a\nwarrantless strip search and visual body cavity inspection as a tool to humiliate and degrade her in retaliation for\nher refusal to respond to interrogation.\nIndependently of the issue of allegations that Officer Hayes deliberately violated the law in order to retaliate, as\nforbidden by Malley, Swain also asserts the search is not, on its facts, objectively reasonable. This search, on\nSwain's allegations, occurred after she had ample opportunity to dispose of any hidden evidence and when she\nwas alone in a monitored cell, posing no danger to others that might justify hastily proceeding without a warrant.\nSuch allegations, if true, do not represent a \"close case\" but a flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment's\nguarantee against unreasonable searches. Whether those allegations are true or not must be resolved by the\nfinder of fact.\nD. Municipal Liability\nSwain claims that the Town of North Reading is liable for the injuries that she suffered. The Supreme Court has\nrecently clarified the necessary showing for a claim of municipal liability under ยง 1983:\n11\n\n*11 [I]n Monell and subsequent cases we have required a plaintiff seeking to impose liability on a\nmunicipality under ยง 1983 to identify a municipal \"policy\" or \"custom\" that caused the plaintiff's\ninjury.\n....\nAs our ยง 1983 municipal liability jurisprudence illustrates, however, it is not enough for a ยง 1983\nplaintiff merely to identify conduct properly attributable to the municipality. The plaintiff must also\ndemonstrate that, through its deliberate conduct, the municipality was the \"moving force\" behind\nthe injury alleged. That is, a plaintiff must show that the municipal action was taken with the\nrequisite degree of culpability and must demonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal\naction and the deprivation of federal rights.\nBoard of the County Comm'rs v. Brown, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 1388, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997)\n(discussing Monell v. New York City Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978),\nand progeny).\nHere, Swain predicates municipal liability on a failure to properly communicate to the police force a uniform policy\non when strip searches are appropriate and who may authorize them. This failure to train, Swain alleges, rose to\nthe level of conscious indifference to the constitutional rights of arrestees. Swain accurately notes that the various\npolice personnel, including the police chief, expressed some confusion as to when strip searches are warranted.\nThe Supreme Court addressed failure to train claims in Brown:\nWe concluded in Canton that an \"inadequate training\" claim could be the basis for ยง 1983 liability\nin \"limited circumstances.\" We spoke, however, of a deficient training \"program,\" necessarily\nintended to apply over time to multiple employees. Existence of a \"program\" makes proof of fault\nat least possible in an inadequate training case. If a program does not prevent constitutional\nviolations, municipal decisionmakers may eventually be put on notice that a new program is called\nfor. Their continued adherence to an approach that they know or should know has failed to\nprevent tortious conduct by employees may establish the conscious disregard for the\nconsequences of their action 00 the \"deliberate indifference\" 00 necessary to trigger municipal\n97 97\nliability.\nId. at ___, 117 S.Ct. at 1390 (discussing and citing Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d\n412 (1989)).\nSwain does not, however, point to any other incidents in which the North Reading police force violated the rights\nof arrestees through strip and visual body cavity searches. There was thus \"no notice to the municipal\ndecisionmaker, based on previous violations of federally protected rights, that his approach is inadequate.\" Id.\nThe Supreme Court has left open the possibility that a failure-to-train claim can succeed without showing a\npattern of constitutional violations. \"[I]n a narrow range of circumstances, a violation of federal rights may be a\nhighly predictable consequence of a failure to equip law enforcement officers with specific tools to handle\nrecurring situations.\" Id. at 1391.\nThis is not that case. Officer Hayes and Chief Purnell agreed that every officer was supplied with policy\nguidelines, including periodic updates. Lieutenant Nolan's memo requiring strip searches to be justified by\nprobable cause was such an update. The police officers also agreed that the MPI, colloquially known as the\n\"police manual,\" was to be followed by, and was available to, the North Reading force. Apparently, not all the\nofficers had a consistent understanding of those materials. However, it is undisputed that North Reading did have\nan appropriate policy that was distributed to the force; absent prior claims, it cannot be reasonably inferred that\nChief Purnell knew, or should have known, that his officers were not executing that policy. Accordingly, Swain\ncannot make the requisite showing of \"deliberate indifference\" to her constitutional rights. We affirm the grant of\nsummary judgment as to the Town of North Reading.\n\nE. State Law Claim\n12 The Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, article 14, gives every person the *12 right to be free from\n\"unreasonable searches.\" The Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, ยงยง 11H, 11I, provides a\nprivate right of action for persons who are deprived of rights protected by either federal or state law. The district\ncourt concluded that the protections of article 14 tracked the Fourth Amendment protections of the federal\nConstitution, and that the search of Swain was reasonable under both federal and state law. We agree that cases\nlike Rodriques v. Furtado, 410 Mass. 878, 575 N.E.2d 1124 (1991), indicate that the state constitution provides at\nleast the level of protection against strip and visual body cavity searches as does the federal Constitution.\nHowever, in some instances, the Supreme Judicial Court has concluded that \"art[icle] 14 provides more\nsubstantive protection to criminal defendants than does the Fourth Amendment.\" Commonwealth v. Upton, 394\nMass. 363, 476 N.E.2d 548, 556-57 (1985) (rejecting federal standard for determining probable cause based on\nconfidential informant tips); see also Commonwealth v. Blood, 400 Mass. 61, 507 N.E.2d 1029 (1987). The\nSupreme Judicial Court has also noted that the Massachusetts law on body cavity searches under article 14\nremains uncharted territory. Rodriques, 410 Mass. at 884 n. 8, 575 N.E.2d 1124. The SJC did remark, however,\nthat the federal cases on searches in prisons were not \"germane\" to a body cavity search of a suspect for\nevidence \"because of the `diminished' Fourth Amendment rights of prisoners and their visitors.\" Id. (citations\nomitted). This remark certainly suggests the possibility that Massachusetts law might place greater limitations on\nthe use of strip and visual body cavity searches of arrestees than the federal Constitution does.\nWe need not attempt to predict fully what course Massachusetts law will take. The Massachusetts Constitution\ncertainly does not provide less protection than federal law. Having found that the search of Swain may have been\nobjectively unreasonable under the federal Constitution, we conclude that the law of the Commonwealth would at\nleast view the search similarly, and we therefore reinstate her state law claim against the individual defendants.\nDefendants contend that Swain cannot prove that her injuries were perpetrated by \"threats, intimidation, or\ncoercion\" as required under Massachusetts law. See, e.g., Planned Parenthood League v. Blake, 417 Mass. 467,\n631 N.E.2d 985, 990 (1994). The Supreme Judicial Court has accepted that a \"threat\" may be defined as an\n\"exertion of pressure to make another fearful or apprehensive of injury or harm\"; that \"intimidation\" may be\ndefined as \"putting [a person] in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct\"; and that \"coercion\" may\nbe defined as the application of physical or moral force so as to force someone to do something she would\notherwise not have done. Id. On the facts here, a jury could find that Officer Hayes used the strip search to\nhumiliate or punish Swain and as a means of exerting moral or psychological pressure designed to weaken her\nperceived resistance to her questioning. This could indeed constitute \"intimidation\" or \"coercion\" within the\nmeaning of the statute.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed with respect to the Town of North Reading, and reversed with respect\nto the individual defendants.\n[1] As noted above, the Ninth Circuit has held that, absent a threat to institutional security, the higher showing of\nprobable cause is required to justify such a search. Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1446.\n[2] We also recognize that, under Whren v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996),\na police officer's subjective motivations do not serve to invalidate a search for exclusionary rule purposes, so long\nas the search was objectively reasonable under the circumstances. Whren, however, also stressed that \"the\nConstitution prohibits selective enforcement of the law based on considerations such as race,\" id. at ___, 116\nS.Ct. at 1774, and, we would assume, gender. The exclusionary rule, as the Supreme Court recognized in Malley\nv. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 344, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1097-98, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986), balances different interests than\nthose in a ยง 1983 action. (\"While we believe the exclusionary rule serves a necessary purpose, it obviously does\nso at a considerable cost to the society as a whole, because it excludes evidence probative of guilt.... On the\nother hand, a damages remedy for [a Fourth Amendment violation] imposes a cost directly on the officer\nresponsible ..., without the side effect of hampering a criminal prosecution.\").\n\n[3] In St. Hilaire, we noted that the proper division of functions between judge and jury on the objective\nreasonableness inquiry may be accomplished either through special interrogatories or through carefully\nstructured jury instructions. St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 24 n. 1; see also Nahmod, supra, ยง 8.08, at 137. We leave that\ndecision here to the trial court.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

In each case it requires a balancing of the need for\nthe particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts\nmust consider the scope of particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. Id. 558, 99 S.Ct. at\n1884.\nIn view of the facts of the case at bar, it is clear that upon performing a balancing test of\nthe needXor_the_search, against her personal rights, the need to search outweighed her privacy\nrights. The plaintiffhad thrown, in an attempt to conceal it from the police officer, illegal\ncontraband.\nFurther, when considering the scope_oLtheSntrusion, the fact that the search was\nconducted by a female and the plaintiffwas allowed to keep her bra on suggests that the least\nintrusive approach possible was used. Furthermore, the plaintiff testified herself that Matron\nSpinney never touched her person during the search.\nWith regard to the manner in which the strip_searclt_w_as_conducted, it is clear that it was\nconducted in a most professional fashion. The plaintiff testified at her deposition that Matron\nSpinney was very kind during the search and never touched her.\nFurther, tbe_sear_eh.3y.as_clearly_j_stified as the plaintiff was an arrestee charged with\npossession of marijuana and with shoplifting. Both of these offenses would create a reasonable\nsuspicion\\probable cause to the officers that she was concealing either a weapon or contraband.\nEven more so, the fact that the plaintiffthrew the bag of marijuana when she exited the motor\nvehicle contributes to the officer's heightened suspicion that the plaintiff was concealing\nevidence.\nLastly, with regard to the plac,e in which the_earch wass.,onducted, as it was conducted in\na female holding cell with the door shut and solely in the presence of the matron, the defendants\n\ncouldnothaveprovidedamoreprivateandappropriateplacetoconductthesearch.\nBasedonthisapplicationofthe_W_alfisbhalancingtestitisclearthatthestripsearchof\ntheplaintiffwas warrantedandconstitutional.Id.\nB. Massachusetts__ghtsAct,_G.L._c.A 2_e_tion_la__and_I\nAs the plaintiffhas failed to substantiate a claim against the defendants for violation of\nher Federal Civil Rights, the plaintiff's claim against the defendants pursuant to the\nMassachusetts Civil Rights Act must also fail.\nThe Massachusetts counterpart to the Federal Civil Rights Act, requires the additional\nburden on the plaintiff'to prove a violation of her rights by threats, intimidation and coercion,\nand as the plaintiffhas failed to articulate any such conduct by the defendants, such action must\nfail. G.L. c 12, Section 11H and I, _[its..x._Koman_Catholic Archbishop of Boston, 411 Mass.\n202, 210 (1991). Generally, relief under the MCRA will be granted where the threat,\nintimidation, or coercion involves either a physical confrontation accompanied by a threat of\nharm, or the loss of a contract right. WALLits,supra at 210; B.aUv v. Northeastern University, 403\nMass. 713, 719 (1989). The plaintiff has failed to present any evidence to support her claim that\nthe defendants, Town, Spinney or Hayes, engaged in acts that constituted threats, intimidation or\ncoercion, let alone in the context of a physical confrontation or resulting in the loss of a contract\nright.\n2. The_D_efend ant s.Spinney_AndMay_eir_I ndiv_id uaLCapacity_Must_e\nQaiali_d lyJ.mm une_Er_om_Liabilit y\nIn the case of Siege_t_x._le_, 500 U.S. 226 (199 I), the defendant raised as here the\ndefense of qualified immunity and the Supreme Court held that it was not necessary to address\nthe defense of qualified immunity as the claim failed at analytically earlier stage. As in the case\n\natbar,theplaintiff failedtoestablishaclaimfortileviolationofanyrightssecuredbythe\nConstitutionasdiscussedaboveandthereforetileclaimsagainstSpinneyandHayesmustbe\ndismissed,andaqualifiedinununityanalysisisnotnecessary.\nIf,however,thisCourtfindsthattheplaintiff's constitutionalrightswereviolated,then\nthedefendantsarestill qualifiedlyimmunefromliability astherightnottobestripsearchedwas\nnotclearlyestablishedatthetimeofthesearchQ. ualifiedimmunityprotectsgovernment\nofficials,suchasthedefendantsH, ayesandSpinney,\"tยฅomliability forcivil damagesinsofaras\ntheirconductdoes not violate clearly_established_statutor_nstitutionala'ights of which a\nreasonable person would have known\". Har.[o_.__FStzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). Thus,\n\"[e]ven defendants who violate constitutional rights enjoy a qualified immunity that protects\nthem from liability for damages unless it is further demonstrated that their conduct was\nunreasonable under the applicable standard\". Day.is__:._Schexe_, 468 U.S. 183, 190 (1984).\nIt must be determined whether the right at issue was \"clearly established\" at the time of\nthe alleged violation. In this context, a right is \"clearly established\" if\"[t]he contours of the right\n[are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates\nthat fight.\" An.derson_ยฅ._CJ:eighton, 482 U.S. 635,640 (1987). Next, the Court must \"determine\nwhether Defendants reasonably should have comprehended that their specific actions\ntransgressed those 'clearly established' rights\". Amsden_v_._Moxa.n, 904 F. 2d 748, 752 (lst Cir.\n1990).\nThe state of the law surrounding the constitutionality of strip searches at the time the\nplaintiffwas searched was such that the defendants acted properly in conducting the search based\non Klein and Wx_tsh. If it is determined that the law has since changed, the defendants,\nSpinney and Hayes must be qualifiedly immune from liability.\n?\n\nContrary to plaintiff's argument that the Court erred by dismissing the pendent state civil\nrights claim, G.L.c 12, Section 1IH, based on the ruling in Rodriques_w_Eurtado, 410 Mass. 878\n(1991), the defendants Spinney and Hayes were properly dismissed based on qualified immunity.\nThe facts of Rodriqu.es differ drastically from the case at bar. In R.Qdnques, the plaintiff was\nsubjected to an internal cavity search. Id. The plaintiff, Swain, was not subjected to such an\nintrusion, but instead to a visual strip search. The plaintiff's argument that the individual\ndefendants can not be qualifiedly immune from liability based on the holding in Ro_driques is\nclearly misplaced.\nFurther, the plaintiff alleges that Lt. Hayes acted with a malicious state of mind when he\nordered the strip search. This Court has stated, the \"applicable standard\" when applying the\ndefense of qualified immunity requires a an objective analysis and therefore:\n\"Because qualified immunity does not address the substantive viability of a section 1983\nclaim, but rather the objective reasonableness of a defendant's actions, a plaintiff who is\nentitled to prevail on the merits is not necessarily entitled to prevail on the issue of\nqualified immunity.\" Amsden_y_._Moran, 904 F. 2d 748, 751 (lst Cir. 1990).\nTherefore, Lt. Hayes' state of mind would not be at issue.\n3. The_Plaintiff_Has_Eailed_to_State_a_Claim_Against_Tda_t'tlLReading\nThe Court properly dismissed the defendant, Town of North Reading, from this action as\nthe plaintiff has failed to allege anything which would give rise to liability under 42 U.S.C.\nSection 1983. The plaintiff merely stated broad claims against the defendant, Town of North\nReading without setting forth the basis thereof.\nThe plaintiff asserts that her Federal Constitutional rights were violated as the Town was\nnegligent in training and supe_,ising defendants, Spinney and Hayes.\nInitially, to prevail on a Section 1983 claim, \"a plaintiff must show that he or she was\n\ndeprivedof a right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution or laws of the United\nStates by a person acting under color of state law\". P_ittsley_v.._Wafish, 1927 F. 2d 3, 6 (lst Cir.),\nceaxlenied, 112 S. Ct. 226 (1991) (citations omitted). A plaintiffmay not sue a local\ngovernment or its officials under a theory of respondeat superior pursuant to Section 1983.\nMonell_pt._of_SociakSery_ices, 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978). The plaintiff may not, therefore,\nsimply include the Town of North Reading as a defendant and hope to impute the actions of\nindividual police officers to it through resgondeat_superior.\nMoreover, the civil rights violation asserted against the Town of North Reading merely\nalleges negligence in supervising and training its employees which is not enough to escalate to a\ncivil rights violation. Only where a municipality's failure to train its employees in a relevant\nrespect evidences a \"deliberate indifference\" to the rights of its inhabitants can such a\nshortcoming be properly thought of as a city \"policy or custom\" that is actionable under Sec.\n1983. Only where a failure to train reflects a deliberate or conscious choice by a municipality\ncan a city be liable for such a failure under Sec. 1983. Cites, 489 U.S. 378,\n389 (1985).\nFurther to succeed against a municipality in a Section 1983 case, a plaintiff must prove\nthat the alleged constitutional injury directly resulted from an official policy or well settled\npractice. MoneiL__D_ept,_oยฃ.Somal_Sezy2c.es, 436 U.S. 658, 690-694 (1978).\nThe evidence and facts as asserted by the plaintiff fall far short of substantiating a custom\nor policy creating a constitutional injury by the Town of North Reading. In fact, after a review of\nthe policies and procedures of the Town of North Reading it is clear that they are constitutional\nbased on the above _WoLfish balancing test.\nFurthermore, the plaintiff's claim of a violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act\n9\n\nagainsttheTownofNorthReading,isnotviableforaclaimbasedonthedoctrineof respondeat\nsuperior. Iy_ons__:._Nat/onakCar_entakS_ystems,An_ 30 F.3d 240, 245-247 (Ist Cir 1994).\nTherefore, Swain's claim against the defendant must be predicated on the Town's failure to\nadequately train, supervise, and discipline its police officers. The plaintiff fails, however, to\nallege any facts which indicate that the Town negligently trained, supervised, or disciplined its\npolice officers. Even if she had, mere negligence in employing and supervising police officers\ndoes not constitute threats, intimidation, or coercion. Hathawa_Stone, 687 F. Supp. 708, 711\n(D.Mass. 1988).\nCONCLUSION:\nFor the above stated reasons, the defendants move that this Court affirm the decision of\nthe District Court as the plaintiff has failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted.\nRespectfully submitted\nDefendants- Appellees\nBy their attorney,\nBBO# 545191\nRegina M.

The Plaintiff,\nKelly Swain, alleges that the Defendants, Edward Hayes and\nLaura Spinney, two police officers employed by the Defendant,\nTown of North Reading, without justification or excuse, violated her\nconstitutional and civil rights of privacy and to be free from\nunreasonable searches and seizures, when they forced her to\nundergo an illegal strip search and body cavity search while-she\nwas detained as an arrestee at the Defendants' police station,\nawaiting transport to the local Court for arraignment.\nThe Defendants moved for summary judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56,\nupon the following, respective grounds: the individual Defendants,\nHayes and Spinney, alleged that the strip search was legal and\nthat, in any case, they are protected from liability by the qualified\nimmunity vouchsafed such public officers in the performance of\ntheir official duties. The Defendant Town alleged, in essence, that\nthe Plaintiff had failed to allege a set of facts upon which municipal\nliability could be found. The Plaintiff opposed the motion and\nargument was heard by Judge O'Toole. Ultimately, Judge O'Toole\nallowed the Defendants' โขmotion in its entirety, and entered a final\njudgment dismissing all โขcounts of the complaint. This appeal\nfollowed.\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nI. The police must have probable cause to believe that the arrestee\nis concealing weapons or contraband upon her person before\nthey may strip-search her. A strip-search is not a routine search,\nand thus requires a greater threshold showing in order to justify\nsuch an invasive procedure. Moreover, under Massachusetts\nconstitutional law, any search must be supported by full probable\ncause. Further, the Defendant Town's own regulations require\nprobable cause in order to conduct a strip-search. Finally,\nprobable cause was required in this case because the strip search\nincluded a visual body cavity search. (PP. 13-19)\nII. The Defendants did not have adequate grounds for conducting\nthe strip-search of Kelli Swain. The facts of record did not even\nsupport a reasonable suspicion that Kelli Swain may have been\nconcealing contraband or weaponry upon or within her physical\nperson. (PP. 19-22)\nII1. The qualified immunity afforded police officers in the\nperformance of their official duties does not entitle the individual\nDefendants at bar to summary judgment dismissing the case\nagainst them. Keili Swain's right to be secure from the strip search\ncum body cavity search was firmly established as a matter of both\nfederal and state law. Moreover, the objective facts in the record\nbelied any contention that the strip search cum body cavity search\nwas objectively reasonable. (PP. 23-27)\n\n4\nIV.The record raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\nthe Defendant Town may also be liable in this case. The record\nwas sufficient to raise the issue of whether the Town's agents\nacted with conscious indifference to the _ersonal civil rights of the\nPlaintiff. (PP. 27-29)\nFACTS\nAgreed Upon Facts\nThe parties stipulated to the following facts in their pretrial\nmemorandum:\n\"The plaintiff, Kelli Swain, was arrested on May 18, 1993 for illegal\npossession of a Class D substance, receiving stolen property and\nshoplifting. All of the criminal charges against the plaintiff were\nultimately continued without a finding or nol prossed.\nThe arrest of the plaintiff was prompted by a call from employees\nat Monahan Lumber that an individual, later identified as\nChristopher Milbury, the plaintiff's boyfriend, was shoplifting. There\nis no evidence that Kelli took part in the shoplifting activities.\nOfficer Marchionda followed Mr. Milbury's motor vehicle in which\nthe plaintiff was a passenger and directed it to pull over to the side\nof the road. After the motor vehicle came to a stop, Officer\nMarchionda found a bag of marijuana on the grass beside the\npassenger side of the motor vehicle. The plaintiff and her\nboyfriend were placed in a cruiser and transported to the North\nReading Police Station.\n\n5\nAt the North Reading Police Station, the plaintiff was fingerprinted,\nphotographed and asked to sign a card pertaining to her rights.\nAlso, the plaintiff's pocketbook was searched by one of the\nofficers. At the station, Kelli was subjected to a routine inventory\nsearch. As a result of the inventory, no stolen property or\ncontraband were discovered on Kelli or in her purse. While\nconducting the search of her pocketbook, rolling papers were\ndiscovered. The plaintiff was then placed in a holding cell at the\nNorth Reading Police Station by Matron Laura Spinney.\nLt. Hayes had a conversation with the plaintiff and subsequently\nMatron Laura Spinney advised the plaintiff that she would be strip\nsearched.\nIn instructing the plaintiff on the procedure of the strip search,\nMatron Spinney asked the plaintiff to remove her clothing, leaving\nher bra on, and bend over and spread her buttocks. Matron\nSpinney never touched the plaintiff during the procedure.\nLater that day, the plaintiff was transported to the Woburn District\n(Court).\"\n(Appendix, pp. 62-63, hereinafter A. 62-63. See also Judge's\nMemorandum and Decision, in the Supplement hereto, pp. 1-3,\nhereinafter S. 1-3)\nAlthough not part of the stipulation of the parties, the Defendants\nnever contested the following facts: at no time did the North\nReading Police have a warrant authorizing a strip-search or a\n\n6\nbody-cavity search of Kelli Swain; and at no time did the North\nReading Police attempt to obtain a warrant authorizing a strip-\nsearch or a body-cavity search of Kelli Swain. (A. 118)\nAdditional Facts on the Record\nAt the station, the Police permitted Kelli to call her attorney, and\nshe did so. (Swain deposition, pp. 34; 51-52) _\nAt the conclusion of the booking procedure, Kelli was placed in a\ncell for approximately an hour. (Swain, p. 42)\nDuring this time, the Defendant Hayes appeared outside Kelli's\ncell and, despite the fact, that the police knew that she had retained\ncounsel, began to interrogate her in a fashion that caused her to\nbreak down and cry. (Swain, pp. 42-47; accord: Judge's\nMemorandum and Order, S. 2)\nHaving gotten nothing from her, Defendant Hayes left, visibly\nangry. (Swain, p. 45; accord: Judge's Memorandum and Order, S.\n2)\nLt. Hayes testified that he cannot recall whether or not he\ninterrogated Kelli. (Hayes, p. 28)\nHowever, Officer Marchionda, who was the arresting officer on this\ncase, testified that Hayes must have spoken to Kelli, because he\n(Hayes) told Marchionda that Kelli had told him (Hayes) that\ncertain stolen property had come from a store in Gloucester, MA.\n' All of the depositions in their entirety have been reproduced in the Transcript\nVolume submitted by the Plaintiff-Appellant.\n\n7\n(Marchionda, p. 39)\nA short time later, the Defendant Spinney appeared at Kelli's cell,\nand informed her that she was under orders to subject her to a\nstrip search. (Swain, p. 47; accord: Judge's Memorandum and\nOrder, S.2)\nBoth Matron Spinney and Lt. Hayes testified that it was Lt. Hayes\nwho gave the order to strip-search Kelli Swain. (Spinney, p. 34;\nHayes, p.29; accord:Judge's Memorandumand Order, S. 2)\nThere was a closed-circuit monitor in Kelli's cell, and Kelli had no\nway of knowing whether it was on or off. (Swain, p. 48, Spinney,\npp. 32-33; accord: Judge's Memorandum and Order, S. 3)\nAccording to Chief Purnell, the cameras are always on. (Purnell, p.\n10.) 2\nKelli was then ordered to completely disrobe (except for her bra)\nand then to bend deeply at the waist and spread her buttocks.\n(Swain, pp. 48-49; accord: Judge's Memorandum and Order, S. 2-\n3)\nOfficer Marchionda testified that strip-searches do not always\ninvolve ordering the subject to spread, and that it depends upon\nthe facts of the particular case. (Marchionda, p. 29)\nShe complied reluctantly, tearfully, and fearful that the whole affair\nwas being photographed. (Swain, p. 49; accord: Judge's\nThis statement in the record is at odds with the Court's finding that, \"Swain\noffered noevidence that the camera was actually operating ....\" (S. 3, note 2)\n\n8\nMemorandum and Order, S. 3)\nAt no time was Kelli's boyfriend, Chris Milbury, subjected to a strip-\nsearch. (Milbury, p. 42)\nAccording to the \"Revised Inventory Search Policy\" issued to North\nReading Police Officers by Lt. Edward Nolan on or about August\n18, 1989, and still in force and effect within the said Department,\n\"(a) strip search of an arrestee is warranted only if the police have\nprobable cause to believe that the arrestee is concealing\ncontraband or weapons on his body.\" (See: \"Inventory Searches\nof Arrestees - Procedures and Guidelines, par. 4, A. 105)\nAccording to the \"Police Manual Policies and Procedures\"\npublished by the Municipal Police Institute and adhered to by the\nNorth Reading Police Department,\n\"A strip search of an arrestee is warranted only if Officers have\nreasonable suspicion to believe that an arrestee is concealing\ncontraband or weapons on his body.\n1. All body strip-searches must be approved by the officer in\ncharge, who shall consider the following question: Is the crime one\nthat is normally associated with weapons or contraband? Only if\nthe answer to this question is yes and there is a reasonable\nsuspicion that the arrestee has weapons or contraband on his\nperson will a bodystrip-search be authorized.\n2. Body cavity searches should not be conducted without the\nexpress approval of the officer in charge, and require a search\n\n9\nwarrant signed by a judge.\"\n(See: \"Booking Procedures and the Holding Facility, par. H, pp.\n660-13 and 660-14, A. 110-111)\nChief Henry Purnell testified on deposition that the North Reading\nPolice Dept. was governed by the aforementioned \"Revised\nInventory Search Policy\" and \"Police Manual Policies and\nProcedures.\" (Purnell, pp. 17-18, and exhibits)\nChief Purnell also testified that it is Department policy to strip-\nsearch all arrestees when drugs are in any way involved. (Purnell,\npp. 44-45; 60)\nYet, the Chief also admitted that the mere presence of drugs\nsomewhere in the circumstances surrounding the arrest is not\nsufficient basis for a strip-search. (Pumell, pp. 60-61)\nYet, both Lt. Hayes and Matron Spinney testified at their\ndepositions that they were completely unaware of any policies and\nprocedures governing strip-searches. (Hayes, pp. 12-13; Spinney,\npp. 23-24, 41).\nIndeed, Lt. Hayes went so far as to intimate that every officer is\nfree to follow his own \"policy\" as to whether or not arrestees ought\nto be searched! (Hayes, p. 52)\nOfficer Marchionda testified that he is unaware of any official policy\nmandating the strip-searching of all drug-related arrestees;\nhowever, he said that that is usually done. (Marchionda, pp. 24-\n\n10\n25)\nChief Purnell testified that the \"officer in charge\" or the \"shift\ncommander\" has the authority to order the strip-search of an\narrestee. (Purnell, pp. 30-31)\nBut Officer Marchionda's understanding is that any police officer\nwho suspects that an arrestee is concealing contraband may order\na strip-search. (Marchionda, p. 31)\nLt. Hayes was not involved in the arrest or booking of Kelli Swain.\n(Hayes, pp. 17-18)\nFor himself, Lt. Hayes testified that he orders strip-searches of all\nfemale arrestees where drugs are involved in the arrest - even,\ne.g., where the only drugs found were in the car in which the\narrestee was riding. (Hayes, pp. 33-34)\nLt. Hayes has never discussed \"his\" policy of strip-searching all\nfemale arrestees whenever drugs are in any way involved in the\narrest with Chief Purnell, and he has no idea of whether the Chief\nis aware of the policy. (Hayes, pp. 44-45)\nIt. Hayes also testified that he would have ordered a strip-search\nof Kelli Swain even if the drugs had been found only on Chris\nMilbury. (Hayes, p. 44).\nYet, apparently, the reverse is not true, for as we have seen, Chris\nMilbury was never strip-searched. (Milbury, p. 42)\n\n11\nChief Purnell does not believe that a strip-search is invasionary.\n(Pumell, p. 48)\nLt. Hayes does not consider strip-searching a female to be\nunusual, and he does not know whether it is demeaning. (Hayes,\np. 46)\nYet, Matron Spinney testified that only a small minority of female\narrestees are strip-searched. (Spinney, p. 52)\nChief Purnell testified that a strip-search is warranted only out of\nconcern for concealed weapons or contraband, and that it should\noccur immediately after the booking. (Purnell, pp. 30, 39)\nIndeed, Chief Purnell stated that it would be a violation to place an\narrestee in a cell for an hour and then strip-search him or her.\n(Purnell, p. 47)\nChief Purnell has no knowledge about Kelli Swain's having been\nin the cell for forty-five minutes or more before being strip-\nsearched. (Purnell, p. 39)\nYet, Matron Spinney testified that Lt. Hayes did not order her to\nstrip-search Kelli when she first took her to the cell. (Spinney, p.\n37)\nMatron Spinney also testified that when she discussed the results\nof the inventory of Kelli's pocketbook with Lt. Hayes, Hayes did not\norder the strip-search. (Spinney, p. 43)\n\n12\nLt. Hayes admitted that at the time he ordered the strip-search of\nKelli Swain, he knew that she had been arrested for possession of\nmarijuana, but that no contraband had been found on her person.\n(Hayes, pp. 30-31)\nMatron Spinney testified that since this lawsuit hit, she has had no\ndiscussions about the case with Lt. Hayes, and no discussions\nabout strip-searches with other officers. (Spinney, pp. 47, 51)\nLt. Hayes testified that he has had no discussions with Chief\nPurnell about strip-search policies and procedures either before or\nsince this lawsuit hit. (Hayes, pp. 52-53)\nLt. Hayes also testified that since this lawsuit hit, there have been\nno investigations of this incident by anyone within the Department.\n(Hayes, p. 56)\nChief Purnell testified that since this lawsuit hit, he had one (1)\ndiscussion\" with Lt. Hayes, and one (1) discussion with the Town\nManager about the suit, and that nobody has requested any\nwritten reports about this incident. (Hayes, pp. 41-42)\nWhen provided with the fact pattern surrounding Kelli Swain's\narrest, detention, and strip-search, and asked what in that fact\npattern gave rise to probable cause to believe that weapons or\ncontraband might be found on or within Kelli Swain's body, Chief\nPurnell replied, \"1really can't answer.\" (Pumell, pp. 59-64)\n\n13\nARGUMENT\nh The police must have probable cause to believe that\nthe arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband upon\nher person before they may strip-search her.\n\"The development of the law regarding strip searches of persons\narrested by the police reflects a trend toward the view that a lawful\narrest standing alone will not entitle the police to conduct a strip\nsearch; some additional foundation, ranging under the various\ndecisions anywhere from a reasonable suspicion to probable\ncause to believe that the arrestee possesses weapons or\ncontraband or is concealing evidence on his or her person, must\nsupport the strip search before it will be found reasonable under\nthe Fourth Amendment.\" Annotation: Fourth Amendment as\nProhibiting Strip Searches of Arrestees or Pretrial Detainees, 78\nALR Fed. 201, sec. 2.\nThere are four (4) grounds for holding that probable cause is the\nproper standard to be applied at bar:\nFirst, United States v. Montoya de Hemandez, 472 U.S. 531\n(1985), observed that, \"the Fourth Amendment's balance of\nreasonableness is qualitatively different at the international border\nthan in the interior,\" id., at 538, and went on to hold that, \"the\ndetention of a traveler at the border, beyond the scope of a routine\ncustoms search and inspection, is justified at its incePtion if\ncustoms agents, considering all the facts surrounding the traveler\nand her trip, reasonably suspect that the traveler is smuggling\ncontraband in her alimentary canal\"; id, at 541.\n\n14\nIn a footnote, the Court added that, \"(i)t is also important to note\nwhat we do not hold. Because the issues are not presented today\nwe suggest no view on what level of suspicion, if any, is required\nfor nonroutine border searches such as strip, body cavity, or\ninvoluntary x-ray searches\"; id., at 541, footnote 4.\nCf. United States v. Braks, 842 F.2d 509, 512-513 (1988)\n(characterizing strip searches and body cavity searches as non-\nroutine and thus outside the scope of the \"no suspicion\" standard\ngoverning routine border checks).\nNow, then: if a traveler entering this country enjoys a lesser\ndegree of Fourth Amendment protection than a citizen in the\ninterior; and if a non-routine detention of such a traveler must be\nsupported by a reasonable suspicion; it must necessarily follow\nthat the citizen - who enjoys the full measure of Fourth Amendment\nprotection - may not be subjected to a police procedure as\nhumiliating and invasive as a strip-search on anything less than a\nshowing of full probable cause.\nIndeed, the police should have obtained a warrant before\nsubjecting the Plaintiff to a strip-search, for \"'(o)nce the suspect is\nin custody ... the reasons that justify dispensing with the\nmagistrate's neutral judgment evaporate. There no longer is any\ndanger that the suspect will escape or commit further crimes while\nthe police submit their evidence to a magistrate. And, while the\nState's reasons for taking summary action subside, the suspect's\nneed for a neutral determination of probable cause increases\nsignificantly. The consequences of prolonged detention may be\n\n15\nmore serious than the interference occasioned by arrest .... When\nthe stakes are this high, the detached judgment of a neutral\nmagistrate is essential if the Fourth Amendment is to furnish\nmeaningful protection from unfounded interference with liberty.'\nGerstein v oPugh, 420 U.S., at 114 ..... \"quoted in United States v.\nMontoya de Hernandez, supra, at 553, footnote 21 (Brennan, J.,\ndissenting).\nSecondly, even if federal constitutional law did not require a\nshowing of probable cause prior to performing the strip-search,\nArticle Twelve of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides\nbroader coverage for the citizen in search and seizure situations\nthan does the Fourth Amendment. Commonwealth v. Upton, 394\nMass. 363, 369-377 (1985). See also Rodriques v. Furtado, 410\nMass. 878, 884, footnote 8 (1991), wherein the Supreme Judicial\nCourt questioned whether body cav!ty searches would be\npermissible at all under Article Fourteen.\n\"The requisite for a search and seizure in this Commonwealth is\nprobable cause, and not the 'articulable suspicion' of Terry.\"\nCommonwealth v. Borges, 395 Mass. 788, 798 (1985)\n(Hennessey, C.J., concurring).\nLangton v. Commissioner of Correction, 404 Mass. 165 (1989),\ndealing with the right of prison officials to routinely strip-search\ninmates, cited by the I_efendants in their memorandum, is wholly\ninapplicable to the matter at bar. Cf. Rodriques v. Furtado, supra,\nat 884, footnote 8 (\"We do not think that those cases are germane\nto the present case because of the 'diminished' Fourth\n\n16\nAmendment rights of prisoners\").\n.Thirdly, the Defendant Town's own rules and regulations\nacknowledge a requirement of probable cause in order to strip-\nsearch an arrestee. According to the \"Revised Inventory Search\nPolicy\" issued to North Reading Police Officers by Lt. Edward\nNolan on or about August 18, 1989, and still in force and effect\nwithin the said Department, \"(a) strip search of an arrestee is\nwarranted only if the police have probable cause to believe that\nthe arrestee is concealing contraband or weapons on his body.\"\n(See: \"Inventory Searches of Arrestees -Procedures and\nGuidelines, par. 4, A. 105)\nThe Town's own rules and regulations thus modify the \"Police\nManual Policies and Procedures\" published by the Municipal\nPolice Institute, which require only a showing of \"reasonable\nsuspicion. ''3\nFinally and crucially: It is indisputable that probable cause was\nrequired for the search that was performed upon Kelli Swain\nbecause that search included a body cavity search.\nNote, however, that even the MPI manual does not endorse the proposition that\nwhenever there is adrug-related arrest, there is, ipso facto,justification for astrip-\nsearch. Thus the manual's two-pronged test:\n\"All body strip-searches must be approved by the officer in charge, who shall\nconsider the following question: Isthe crime one that is normally associated with\nweapons or contraband? Only if the answer to this question is yes and there is a\nreasonable suspicio n that the arrestee has weapons or contraband on his person\nwill a body strip-search be authorized.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n17\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), correctly cited by the\nDefendants as the lead case in this area of the law, expressly\ndealt with, and distinguished, visual body cavity searches :\n\"Inmates at all Bureau of Prisons facilities ... are required to\nexpose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip\nsearch conducted after every contact visit with a person from\noutside the institution. Corrections officials testified that visual\ncavity searches were necessary not only to discover but also to\ndeter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other contraband into\nthe institution .... The District Court upheld the strip-search\nprocedure but prohibited the body-cavity searches, absent\nprobable cause to believe that the inmate is concealing\ncontraband .... (T)he Court of Appeals affirmed.\"\nId., at 558.\nThe Wolfish Court expressly acknowledged that the question\nbefore it was, \"whether visual body-cavity inspections as\ncontemplated by the MCC rules can ever be conducted on less\nthan probable cause\"; id., at 560.\nIn its Rodriques decision, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\nCourt acknowledged that Wolfish was a body-cavity-search case:\nThere is a large body of law on the constitutionality of body cavity\nsearches in prisons. See, e.g., Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.So 520\n(1979); Langton v. Commissioner of Correction, 404 Mass. 165\n(1989); Blackbum v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556 (1st Cir. 1985); Arruda v.\nFair, 710 F.2d 886 (1st Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 999\n(1984). We do not think that those cases are germane to the\npresent case because of the 'diminished' Fourth Amendment\nrights of prisoners ....\nRodriques v. Furtado, supra, at 884, footnote 8.\n\n18\nWith knowledge of this \"large body of law on the constitutionality of\nbody cavity searches,\" the Court forthrightly and categorically held\nthat,\nat the very least, in the future, under the exercise of our general\nsuperintendence powers, we shall deem a warrant authorizing the\nsearch of a body cavity to be invalid unless issued by the authority\nof a judge, on a strong showing of particularized need supported\nby a high degree of probable cause.\nId., at 888.\nIn Arruda v. Fair, 710 F.2d 886, 887 (1st Cir. 1983), the Court of\nAppeals acknowledged, \"as have all courts that have considered\nthe issue, the severe if not gross interference with a person's\nprivacy that occurs when guards conduct a visual inspection of\nbody cavities.\"\nAccord: Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 564 (1985): \"As the\nSeventh Circuit has recently noted, body cavity searches are\n'demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying,\nunpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and\nsubmission.'\" Quoting from Marybeth G. v. City of Chicago, 723\nF.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir. 1983), quoting from Tinettiv. Wittke, 479\nF.Supp. 486, 491 (E.D.Wisc. 1979).\nAt bar, Officer Marchionda acknowledged that a strip-search did\nnot necessarily involve asking the subject to spread.\nThus, it is clear: the strip-search performed upon Kelli Swain\nincluded a visual body cavity search within the meaning and\nholdings of Wolfish and Rodriques. It is equally clear that, since\n\n19\nthe Rodriques decision (August, 1991), any body-cavity search\nhas required a warrant signed by a judge in order to be lawful?\nFor all of the above reasons, the applicable standard in judging\nthe legality of the strip-search cum body-cavity search at issue\nherein is probable cause.\nII.The Defendants did not have adequate grounds for\nconducting the strip-search of Kelii Swain.\nIf, as argued hereinabove, the strip-search included a body-cavity\nsearch, the lawfulness of which was dependent upon a warrant\nsigned by a judge, then no further argument on this point is\nnecessary, since it is uncontested that the Defendants did not\nhave a warrant signed by a judge. Therefore, the following\nargument is offered in the event that this Court declines to find that\na body cavity search was performed.\nStrip searches of persons arrested for drug offenses and not\nsupported by full, probable cause, have been typically justified by\nthe need to insure that the suspect is not smuggling contraband\n' At bar, the Defendants argued that the strip-search did not involve a body-cavity\nsearch because it did not involve any touching of, or intrusion into, the body\nCavity. While is ittrue that the facts in Rodtiques comprised the most intrusive and\nprobing of body-cavity searches, of a sort admittedly not practiced upon the\nPlaintiff at bar, nonetheless, as we have seen, the Court decided the case in light\nof their knowledge of the existing law on body-cavity searches, including visual\nbody cavity searches exactly like that performed upon the Plaintiff at bar. Thus,\nhad the Court had full knowledge of both physically intrusive body cavity\nsearches and visual body cavity searches, and could have limited its holding to\nthe former variety, had that been its wish. That it did not do so - that its decision\nimposed the warrant requirement upon \"body cavity searches,\" without\nqualification, should be dispositive of the issue at bar. Judge O'Toole's own\ndiscussion of the point is ambiguous and inconclusive; see: S.6, text and\nfootnote 4.\n\n2O\ninto the jail or prison, or is not concealing on her person a\nweapon or other implement with which she might harm herself or\nothers. See: Annotation: Fourth Amendment as Prohibiting Strip\nSearches of Arrestees or Pretrial Detainees, 78 ALR Fed. 201,\nsec. 4 and cases cited therein. United States v. Klein, 522 F.2d\n296 (1st Cir. 1975), upheld such a strip-search on precisely these\ngrounds, s\nAt bar, Chief Purnell acknowledged that these were the only\ngrounds which could support a strip-search.\nYet, the facts at bar belie any contention that the strip-search was\nmotivated by any concerns that Kelli may have been smuggling\ncontraband into the jail or prison, or concealing on her person a\nweapon or other implement with which she might harm herself or\nothers:\nItem: The inventory search of Kelli's clothing and handbag\ndisclosed no contraband.\nItem: The strip-search was not performed immediately after\ninventory and prior to incarceration; rather, it was performed only\nafter Kelli had been in the cell for approximately one hour.\nItem: Chief Purnell himself - while denying any knowledge of the\nspecific facts of Kelli Swain's strip search nonetheless\nacknowledged that a strip-search performed an hour after\n5Judge O'Toole rested his decision that the Defendants violated no federal\nconstitutional rights ofthe Plaintiff entirely uponthe Klein decision - even while\nacknowledging that it predated Bell v. Wolfish, supra, and its progeny. See:\nMemorandum andOrder,S.3-5.\n\n21\nincarceration constitutes a violation.\nItem: When the strip-search was performed, Kelli was never told to\nremove her bra - the most likely repository of any concealed\ncontraband!\nItem: The strip-search was not ordered by any arresting or\nbooking officer, or by the \"officer in charge,\" as required by the\nDefendants' own regulations. It was ordered by a detective\nsergeant (now Lieutenant) who came along after the arrest and\nbooking and was investigating the facts of the case.\nItem: Kelli's male companion and co-Defendant was never strip-\nsearched.\nThus, had Kelli been concealing contraband on or in her person,\nshe had ample opportunity to swallow it, flush it down the toilet, or\notherwise dispose of it, by the time that Lt. Hayes ordered her strip-\nsearched.\nIn other words, viewed objectively (see part III, infra), the search at\nbar could not have advanced any of the concerns which the well-\nsettled law has recognized as supporting such a search. Cf. New\nJersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 341 (1985) (the scope of a search\nmust comport with the justification for its inception).\nThese facts - at a bare minimum - raise a genuine issue of material\nfact as to whether concerns for the internal security of the jail\nwarranted the strip-search that was performed upon Kelli Swain.\n\n22\nAnd as for the Defendants' argument that no liability can attach\nunder the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act because the wrong was\nnot perpetrated by means of \"threats, intimidation or coercion,\" one\nmay reply by asking: what is more threatening, intimidating or\ncoercive than to be arrested and incarcerated?\nPlanned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. v. Blake, 417 Mass.\n467, 474-475 (1994), explained that, as used in the Act, a \"threat\"\ninvolves the exertion of pressure to make another fearful or\napprehensive of injury or harm; \"intimidation\" includes putting a\nperson in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct;\nand \"coercion\" is the application of force, physical or moral, to\nanother so as to constrain her to do something against her will\nwhich she would not otherwise have done.\nBy these definitions, and on the factual record established in this\ncase, the Defendants certainly \"coerced\" her into the strip search;\narguably, they also \"threatened\" and \"intimidated\" her. Compare:\nCommonwealth v. Borges, 395 Mass 788 (1985), defining \"arrest\"\nas an official show of authority sufficient to compel compliance. 6\n' Judge O'Tcole's abbreviated discussion (and rejection) of the Plaintiff's state\nclaim (S. 6-7) failed to address this argument raised by the Defendants. He simply\nconcluded that no violation of Rodriques v. Furtado, supra, had occurred,\nbecause the visual body cavity search performed by the Defendants was not as\nintrusive as the physical body cavity search condemned in that case. Judge\nO'Toole failed entirely to address the issue of whether Rodriques required a\nwarrant signed by ajudge for any sort of body cavity search (as argued by the\nPlaintiff) - inwhich case the acts of the Defendants would have amounted to a per\nse violation of the Plaintiff's state constitutional rights (unless protected by the\ndoctrine of qualified immunity, discussed infra.)\n\n23\nIII. The qualified immunity afforded police officers in the\nperformance of their official duties does not entitle the\nindividual Defendants at bar to summary judgment\ndismissing the case against them.\n\"(G)overnment officials performing discretionary functions\ngenerally are shielded from liability from civil damages insofar as\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nโข constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.\"\nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).'\nThus, for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment, an\nobjective standard is applied: was the official's action โขobjectively\nreasonable in the light of the facts and the law as then known?\nSee: Judge's Memorandum and Order, S. 5-6.\nAt bar, the objective standard affords the individual Defendants\nlittle succor. As previously noted hereinabove, the strip-search\nincluded a body-cavity search, the lawfulness of which was\ndependent upon a warrant signed by a judge, and it is\nuncontested that the Defendants did not have a warrant signed by\na judge. Therefore, it is clear beyond peradventure that the actions\nof the individual Defendants were per se unreasonable - at the\nvery least, under state constitutional and decisional law.\n7In Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 322 (1975), the Court had held that the\nstandard for qualified immunity had both an objective and a subjective\ncomponent. I.e., in addition to the objective reasonableness of the official's\naction, inquiry was also to be made into his motives. The Harlow Court eliminated\nthe subjective component from the qualified immunity standard for purposes of\ndeciding a motion for summary judgment. This is not to say, however, that the\nofficial's motives are wholly irrelevant.Should the case proceed to tdal, ashowing\nof malice or bad faith will be pertinent, inter alia, to the question of whether\npunitive damages ought to beawarded.\n\n24\nEven if this Court concludes that a body cavity search requiring a\nwarrant signed by a judge was not performed upon Kelli Swain, it\nmust still conclude that the strip-search was objectively\nunreasonable, under clearly-established law, based upon the\nfacts, authorities, and argument set forth in part II hereof, supra.\nAnd, because the strip-search was objectively unreasonable, the\nindividual Defendants may not have summary judgment based\nupon the doctrine of qualified immunity.\nAt bar, Judge O'Toole, in barely more than a page of discussion,\nheld that the facts of record established, that the Defendants\nenjoyed qualified immunity; with citations omitted, the entirety of\nthe judge's discussion, appearing at pp. S. 5-6, was as follows:\nIn any event, the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from\nSwain's lawsuit. A police officer has the benefit of qualified\nimmunity unless the plaintiff can establish that the right she asserts\nwas clearly established at the time of the alleged violation .... That\nis certainly not the case here. Swain did not have a clear right in\nthe circumstances not to be subjected to a strip search. Rather,\nKlein stood (and stands) for the opposite proposition .... Swain\nplausibly asserts that Hayes may have had a malicious state of\nmind when he ordered the strip search and did so to punish her for\nrefusing to answer his questions. Assuming in her favor that a jury\ncould find those facts, they are nonetheless \"insufficient to pierce\n... (his) defense of qualified immunity .... Lt. Hayes's subjective\npurpose in ordering the suit (sic.) is irrelevant given the objective\nstandards of the qualified immunity inquiry ....\nThe judge then went on to dismiss the claim under the\nMassachusetts Civil Rights Act as well, apparently upon the basis\nthat the holding in Rodriques v. Furtado, supra, did not apply to the\nfacts of this case (see discussion at S.6).\n\n25\nTo the foregoing, the Plaintiff responds as follows:\nIt is simply incredible that the judge, \"review(ing) the record and\ndraw(ing) all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most\nfavorable to (the Plaintiff) (S. 1, footnote 1), could hold that no\nreasonable fact-finder could conclude that the strip-search-cum-\nvisual-body-cavity-search that was performed upon Kelli Swain\nwas objectively illegal - i.e. was not supported either by probable\ncause or even by articulable facts giving rise to a reasonable\nsuspicion, given that:\n-The inventory search of Kelli's clothing and handbag disclosed\nno contraband.\n- The strip-search was not performed immediately after inventory\nand prior to incarceration; rather, it was performed only after Kelli\nhad been in the cell for approximately one hour.\n- Chief Purnell himself - while denying any knowledge of the\nspecific facts of Kelli Swain's strip search - nonetheless\nacknowledged that a strip-search performed an hour after\nincarceration constitutes a violation.\n- When the strip-search was performed, Kelli was never told to\nremove her bra - the most likely repository of any concealed\ncontraband!\n-The strip-search was not ordered by any arresting or booking\nofficer, or by the \"officer in charge,\" as required by the Defendants'\nown regulations. It was ordered by a detective sergeant (now\n\n26\nLieutenant) who came along after the arrest and booking and was\ninvestigating the facts of the case.\nKelli's male companion and co-Defendant was never strip-\nsearched.\n- Had Kelli been concealing contraband on or in her person, she\nhad ample opportunity to swallow it, flush it down the toilet, or\notherwise dispose of it, by the time that Lt. Hayes ordered her strip-\nsearched.\nEven assuming that Klein remains good law, unmodified by\nWolfish and its progeny, Klein, itself, never stood for the blanket\nproposition that any suspect arrested for a drug-related offense\nmay automatically be subjected to a strip-search-cum-visual-body-\ncavity-search. Even under Klein, the authorities had to have some\nfactual basis for suspecting that the suspect might be smuggling\ncontraband into the jail or prison, or might be concealing on her\nperson a weapon or other implement with which she might harm\nherself or others.\nMoreover, in the aftermath of Wolfish, et al, to the extent that Klein\nmight be construed as conferring a blanket authority to strip-\nsearch drug arrestees, it is doubtful that it does remain good law.\nFurther, the District Court's facile willingness to assume that the\npersonal rights of simple arrestees are analogous to, and no\ngreater than, those of persons who have been convicted of crime\n\n27\nand subject to incarceration in a penal institution 8is troubling. An\narrestee has not been convicted of anything - indeed, may not at\nthe time of the arrest have even been formally charged with\nanything (as was the case at bar). To hold that a simple arrestee\nmay be subjected to the degradations and humiliations that are\nthe lot of the convict makes a mockery out of the presumption of\ninnocence.\nFinally, the judge's dismissal of the pendant state claim is the most\ntroubling of all. Whatever may have been the case under the\nfederal law, at the time of the incident in question, Rodriques v.\nFurtado, supra, was the law in Massachusetts. The reasons why\nthat case governed the matter at bar have been fully expounded\nhereinabove. If nothing else, the Plaintiff's state claim should\ntherefore have survived the Defendants' motion for summary\njudgment.\nIV. The record raises a genuine issue of material fact as\nto whether the Defendant Town may also be liable in\nthis case.\nMunicipalities are not entitled to assert the defense of qualified\nimmunity. Owen v. Independence, 445 U.S. 622 (1980).\nA municipality may be held liable under 42 U.S.C. sec. 1983 on\nthe basis of a conscious indifference to the rights of persons within\nits domain. Fiacco v. Rensselaer, 783 F.2d 319 (2d Cir. 1986).\n8cf. the Court's citation to Langton v. Commissioner of Correction, 533 N.E.2d\n1375, 1376 (Mass. 1989) at S. 6-7.\n\n28\nA failure to properly train and supervise its employees which\nreflects a conscious indifference on the part of the municipality\nmay suffice to establish municipal liability. Canton v. Harris, 489\nU.S. 378 (1989).\nUnder 42 U.S.C. sec. 1983, a municipality is responsible for the\ndecisions of its policymakers which violate the constitutional or\nlegal rights of those within its domain, whether the act or omission\noccurs once or repeatedly. Pembauer v. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469\n(1986).\nThe record at bar is ample to establish that the Town of North\nReading, and its Police Chief, were following a \"policy\" of\nconscious indifference toward the legal rights of arrestees within\nits domain:\nItem: No apparent efforts were made to communicate a uniform\npolicy regarding when and by whom strip searches may be\nauthorized.\nItem: There was throughout the Department a laissez faire attitude\non the part of the officers - from the Chief on down to the patrolmen\n- as to when and by whom strip searches may be authorized.\nItem: The commencement of this lawsuit, and the serious\nallegations made herein, occasioned virtually no investigation on\nthe part of Town officials into underlying facts and the possible\nmerits of the complaint.\n\n29\nInsum, virtually nobody - beforeor afterthe commencement of the\npresent lawsuit - considered the matter of a strip-search -\n\"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, terrifying,\nunpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and\nsubmission\" - to be anything out-of-the-ordinary, governed by any\nparticular standards or requiring any particular knowledge or\ntraining.\nSuch willful indifferenceto the rightsof the citizen risesto the level\nof a \"constitutional tort\" under the authorities hereinbefore cited,\nandsuffices - atthe very least- to raisea genuine issueof material\nfact as tothe potential liabilityofthe Townon this case.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff, Kelli Swain, prays\nthat this Honorable Court will vacate the judgment for the\nDefendants entered by the District Court, remand this case to the\nDistrict Court for trial on the merits, and award the Plaintiff such\nother and further relief as may be appropriate.\nRespectfully submitted\nKelli Swain, Plaintiff,\nBy Her Attorneys,\nMichael E.

SWAIN,\nPlaintiff\nVo\nLAURA SPINNEY, EDWARD HAYES and\nTHE TOWN OF NORTH READING,\nDefendants\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nJuly_, 1996\nO'TOOLE, D.J.\nIn this action, the plaintiff Kelli Swain asserts that the\ndefendants Police Officer Laura Spinney and Lieutenant Edward\nHayes violated her federal and state rights by conducting a strip\nsearch and visual body cavity examination of her following her\narrest for shoplifting and possession of marijuana. Swain also\nclaims that the Town of North Reading, the individual defendants'\nemployer, had a policy of conscious indifference to the legal\nrights of those within its domain. All defendants have moved for\nsummary judgment, and the Court now grants their motion.\nMost of the facts of this case are undisputed. I On May 18,\n1993, North Reading police responded to a call that Christopher\nMilbury had been shoplifting at Moynihan Lumber Company in North\nReading. Officer Robert Marchionda located and followed\ni Where the parties are not in agreement, of course, Swain, as\nthe non-moving party, is entitled to the familiar requirement that\nthe Court review the record and draw all reasonable inferences\ntherefrom in the light most favorable to her. Commonwealth v.\nBlackstone Valley Elec. Co., 67 F.3d 981, 986 (Ist Cir. 1995).\n\nMilbury's car, in which Milbury and Swain, who was Milbury's\ngirlfriend, were driving. Officer Marchionda directed the car to\npull\nover. After the car had stopped, Marchionda saw Swain get\nout of the passenger side, place her hands behind her back, and\ndrop an item on the ground. Marchionda retrieved the item and\ndiscovered it to be a bag of marijuana. He then arrested both\nMilbury and Swain, placed them in his police cruiser, and\ntransported them to the North Reading Police Station.\nAt the station, Swain was fingerprinted, photographed and\nasked to sign a card acknowledging that she had been advised of\nher rights. A routine inventory search of Swain revealed no\nstolen property or contraband, although police did find cigarette\nrolling papers in her pocketbook. Officer Spinney then placed\nSwain in a holding cell.\nAfter Swain had been alone in her cell about twenty minutes,\nLt. Hayes came to see her. According to Swain, Hayes tried to\ninterrogate her about the incidents surrounding the arrest, even\nthough he knew that Swain was already represented by counsel.\nHayes' questioning led Swain to break down and cry, but she\napparently did not answer his questions or give a statement.\nHayes left her cell visibly angry. The interview lasted about\nfifteen minutes.\nShortly after Hayes' visit, Spinney reappeared and told\nSwain that she was under orders to subject Swain to a strip\nsearch. Both sides agree that Hayes, Spinney's superior officer,\nordered the search. Spinney told Swain to remove her clothing,\n\nexcept for her brassiere. Having disrobed, Swain was instructed\nto bend deeply at the waist and spread her buttocks. Swain\ncomplied but did so reluctantly and tearfully. Swain was also\nafraid that, because of the presence of a video monitor in the\ncell, the whole search was being photographed. Spinney told her,\nhowever, that the camera was not turned on. 2\nSwain claims, under 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1983 and Mass. Gen. L.\nch. 12, ยงยง IIH, llI, that the defendants violated her rights\nunder the United States and Massachusetts constitutions by\nsubjecting her to an unreasonable search. She seeks compensatory\nand punitive damages, as well as attorney's fees.\nInsofar as Swain seeks to establish the search was\nunconstitutional under federal law, her argument seems foreclosed\nby the First Circuit's decision in United States v. Klein, 522.\nF.2d 296 (ist Cir. 1975). In that case, Klein was arrested for\nselling cocaine. Following his arrest, he was taken to a federal\nbuilding and ordered to strip. After stripping almost\ncompletely, Klein removed fourteen $i00 bills -- money that\ncorresponded to funds federal agents had provided for a cocaine\npurchase -- from his underwear. Klein then continued to strip.\nOnce naked, Klein was instructed to bend over and was examined\nvisually. The Court concluded that such a post-arrest search\nfell fully within the bounds of the Fourth Amendment.\n2 Swain offers no evidence that the camera was actually\noperating, and the defendants have denied that it was.\n\nThe facts of Klein are similar enough to the present case\nto require a similar result. Here, a police officer witnessed\nSwain try to discard concealed contraband. After her arrest,\npolice legitimately discovered rolling papers -- useful for\nmaking marijuana cigarettes -- in her pocketbook. A short time\nafter she was place in the holding cell, she was searched in a\nprofessional manner. Such a search is not unconstitutional. _\nSee Id. at 300.\nAlthough Klein predates the premiere Supreme Court\ncase on\nstrip searches, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), it remains\nvalid First Circuit law. Moreover, the standards and method of\nanalysis of Wolfish, to the extent they are at all different,\ndictate the same outcome. In Wolfish, the Supreme Court noted\nthat\nIt]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment\nis not capable of precise definition or mechanical\napplication. In each case it requires a balancing of\nthe need for the particular search against the invasion\nof personal rights that the search entails. Courts\nmust consider the scope of the particular intrusion,\nthe manner in which it is conducted, the justification\nfor initiating it, and the place in which it is\nconducted.\n441 U.S. at 559. The search in this case passes muster under\nthat scrutiny. Swain had been arrested for possession of\ncontraband, and the police were warranted in subjecting her\nperson to a thorough search. The search itself was conducted out\nof public view in front of only one person of the same sex who,\n3As in Klein, \"[t]here was no piercing or probing of [Swain's]\nskin nor forced entry beyond the surface of bier] body. There was\nnot even any touching of h[er] body.\" Klein, 522 F.2d at 300.\n\naccording the plaintiff's own deposition\ntestimony, acted in a\nfully professional manner. The search was done in connection\nwith the placing of Swain into a detention facility. And, as\nnoted earlier, Swain was never touched during this procedure, a\nfact that distinguishes this search from other, more invasive\nones. C__ff.Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 565 n.5 (Ist Cir.\n1985).\nIn any event, the defendants are entitled to qualified\nimmunity from Swain's lawsuit. A police officer has the benefit\nof qualified immunity unless the plaintiff can establish that the\nright she asserts was clearly established at the time of the\nalleged violation. St. Hilaire vl City of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20,\n24-25 (ist Cir. 1995), cert. denied, No. 95-1653, 1996 WL 206127\n(June 24, 1996). That is certainly not the case here. Swain did\nnot have a clear right in the circumstances not to be subjected\nto a strip search. Rather, Klein stood (and stands) for the\nopposite proposition. See als_____o,Dobrowolskyj v. Jefferson\nCounty, Ky., 823 F.2d 955, 957-59 (6th Cir. 1987), cert. denied,\n484 U.S. 1059 (1988); Durfin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1086-88\n(6th Cir. 1983). Swain plausibly asserts that Hayes may have had\na malicious state of mind when he ordered the strip search and\ndid so to punish her for refusing to answer his questions.\nAssuming in her favor that a jury could find those facts, they\nare nonetheless \"insufficient to pierce [his] defense of\nqualified immunity.\" Tauvar v. Bar Harbor Congreqation, 633 F.\nSupp. 741, 750 (D. Me. 1985), aff'd, 787 F.2d 579 (Ist Cir.\n1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1038 (1987). Lt. Hayes's\nsubjective purpose in ordering the suit is irrelevant given the\n5\n\nobjective standards of\nthe qualified immunity inquiry. See\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641 (1987); Harlow v.\nFitzqerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982); c__ff.Whren v. United\nStates, 116 S. Ct. 1769 (1996).\nTurning to Swain's rights under Massachusetts law,\nArticle 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides\nthat \"[e]very subject has a right to be secure from all\nunreasonable searches of his person .... \" Although\nSwain does not make an extended argument on this point, she seems\nto suggest that Article 14 requires substantially more of police\nofficers in the context of a strip search than does the Fourth\nAmendment. That argument is unavailing. To be sure, the Supreme\nJudicial Court has ruled that a warrant authorizing the search of\na body cavity shall be invalid \"unless issued by the authority of\na judge, on a strong showing of particularized need supported by\na high degree of probable cause.\" Rodriques v. Furtado, 575\nN.E.2d 1124, 1131 (Mass. 1991). Indeed, Rodriques even\nquestioned whether body cavity searches were completely precluded\nunder Article 14, although it declined to reach the issue. 4 Id.\nat 1129 n. 8. But the case also recognized that different\nconsiderations and interests apply once a person has been\narrested and placed in custody. Id. at 1128 n.8. That different\nsituation is the one involved here, and no other Massachusetts\n4 Rodriques concerned the defendants' physical probing of a\nplaintiff's vagina in a search for cocaine. Without in any way\ndiminishing the seriousness of the intrusion into Swain's privacy\nin this case, the Rodriques facts were clearly more egregious. The\ntype of search Rodriques hinted might be entirely prohibited was the\nphysical body-cavity search, not the visual search executed in the\npresent case.\n\ncase suggests any divergence from comparable federal standards.\nCf.\nLanqton v. Commissioner of Correction, 533 N.E.2d 1375, 1376\n(Mass. 1989) (declining to address the standards for strip\nsearches of prisoners under the Massachusetts Constitution). In\nthe absence of any law specifying a different standard, the Court\nis inclined to assume the applicability of Klein, especially\ngiven Rodriques' overall reliance on federal case law. And even\nif Massachusetts did opt for a different standard, qualified\nimmunity would necessarily attach here as well. See Rodriques,\n575 N.E.2d at 1127.\nSwain's case against the Town is even weaker. A\nmunicipality faces liability under ยง 1983 only where a violation\nresults from the municipality's policy or custom. Bordanaro v.\nMcLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1155 (ist Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S.\n820 (1989). To be actionable, the policy or custom must either\ndirectly authorize and encourage the violation of a right or must\npermit it through \"gross negligence amounting to deliberate\nindifference\" to the right at issue. Id; see also City of\nCanton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389-90 (1989) .\nOf course, Swain's argument fails at the outset because of\nthe Court's determination that Hayes and Spinney violated none of\nher rights by respectively ordering and conducting the search.\nEven if her rights were violated by the individual defendants,\nSwain still cannot show why the Town should be held liable.\nSwain admits that North Reading's published policy regarding\nsearches of arrestees was constitutionally adequate. Her claim\n\nthus depends largely on the failure of the Town to communicate\nthe policy adequately to several of the officers involved in this\ncase or to investigate Swain's charges sufficiently. But those\nalleged deficiencies, if true, simply do not establish that North\nReading was deliberately indifferent to its citizens'\nconstitutional rights. Rodriques v. Furtado, 950 F.2d 805, 813\n(ist Cir. 1991); Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 239 (ist Cir.\n1990); Bordanaro, 871 F.2d at 1156.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendants' motion for\nsummary judgment is GRANTED.\nSO ORDERED.\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDISTRICT OF MASSACHUSEqTS\nKelli J.

Swain also claims that the\nTown of North Reading, the individual defendants' employer, had a policy of conscious indifference to the legal\nrights of those within its domain. All defendants have moved for summary judgment, and the Court now grants\ntheir motion.\n[1]\nMost of the facts of this case are undisputed.  On May 18, 1993, North Reading police responded to a call that\nChristopher Milbury had been shoplifting at Moynihan Lumber Company in North Reading. Officer Robert\nMarchionda located and followed Milbury's car, in which Milbury and Swain, who was Milbury's girlfriend, were\ndriving. Officer Marchionda directed the car to pull over.

A short time after she was place in the\n97 97\n[3]\nholding cell, she was searched in a professional manner. Such a search is not unconstitutional. See Id. at 300.\nAlthough Klein predates the premiere Supreme Court case on strip searches, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99\nS.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), it remains valid First Circuit law. Moreover, the standards and method of\nanalysis of Wolfish, to the extent they are at all different, dictate the same outcome. In Wolfish, the Supreme\nCourt noted that\n[t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.

And, as noted earlier, Swain was\nnever touched during this procedure, a fact that distinguishes this search from other, more\ninvasive ones. Cf. Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 565 n. 5 (1st Cir.1985).\nIn any event, the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from Swain's lawsuit. A police officer has the\nbenefit of qualified immunity unless the plaintiff can establish that the right she asserts was clearly established at\nthe time of the alleged violation. St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24-25 (1st Cir.1995),cert. denied,___\nU.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 2548, 135 L.Ed.2d 1068 (1996). That is certainly not the case here. Swain did not have a\nclear right in the circumstances not to be subjected to a strip search. Rather, Klein stood (and stands) for the\nopposite proposition. See also, Dobrowolskyj v.

Swain plausibly asserts that Hayes may have had a malicious state of mind when he ordered the strip\nsearch and did so to punish her for refusing to answer his questions. Assuming in her favor that a jury could find\nthose facts, they are nonetheless \"insufficient to pierce ... [his] defense of qualified immunity.\" Tauvar v.

Hayes's subjective purpose in ordering the suit is irrelevant\ngiven the objective standards of the qualified immunity inquiry. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641,\n107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039-40, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738,\n73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982); cf. Whren v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996).\nTurning to Swain's rights under Massachusetts law, Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights\nprovides that \"[e]very subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches ... of his person....\"\nAlthough Swain does not make an extended argument on this point, she seems to suggest that Article 14\nrequires substantially more of police officers in the context of a strip search than does the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThat argument is unavailing.

Indeed, Rodriques even questioned whether body cavity searches were completely\n[4]\nprecluded under Article 14, although it declined to reach the issue. Id.575 N.E.2d at 1129 n. 8. But the case\nalso recognized that different considerations and interests apply once a person has been arrested and placed in\ncustody. Id.575 N.E.2d at 1128 n. 8. That different situation is the one involved here, and no other\nMassachusetts case suggests any divergence from comparable federal standards. Cf. Langton v. Commissioner\nof Correction, 404 Mass. 165, 533 N.E.2d 1375, 1376 (1989) (declining to address the standards for strip\nsearches of prisoners under the Massachusetts Constitution). In the absence of any law specifying a different\nstandard, the Court is inclined to assume the applicability of Klein, especially given Rodriques' overall reliance on\n29 federal case law. And even if Massachusetts did opt for a different standard, qualified immunity *29 would\nnecessarily attach here as well. See Rodriques, 575 N.E.2d at 1127.\nSwain's case against the Town is even weaker. A municipality faces liability under ยง 1983 only where a violation\nresults from the municipality's policy or custom. Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1155 (1st Cir.),cert.\ndenied,493 U.S. 820, 110 S.Ct. 75, 107 L.Ed.2d 42 (1989). To be actionable, the policy or custom must either\ndirectly authorize and encourage the violation of a right or must permit it through \"gross negligence amounting to\ndeliberate indifference\" to the right at issue. Id; see also City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389-90, 109 S.Ct.\n1197, 1205-06, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989).\nOf course, Swain's argument fails at the outset because of the Court's determination that Hayes and Spinney\nviolated none of her rights by respectively ordering and conducting the search. Even if her rights were violated by\nthe individual defendants, Swain still cannot show why the Town should be held liable. Swain admits that North\nReading's published policy regarding searches of arrestees was constitutionally adequate. Her claim thus\ndepends largely on the failure of the Town to communicate the policy adequately to several of the officers\ninvolved in this case or to investigate Swain's charges sufficiently. But those alleged deficiencies, if true, simply\ndo not establish that North Reading was deliberately indifferent to its citizens' constitutional rights. Rodriques v.\nFurtado, 950 F.2d 805, 813 (1st Cir.1991); Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 239 (1st Cir.1990); Bordanaro, 871\nF.2d at 1156.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] Where the parties are not in agreement, of course, Swain, as the non-moving party, is entitled to the familiar\nrequirement that the Court review the record and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most\nfavorable to her. Commonwealth v. Blackstone Valley Elec. Co., 67 F.3d 981, 986 (1st Cir.1995).\n[2] Swain offers no evidence that the camera was actually operating, and the defendants have denied that it was.\n[3] As in Klein, \"[t]here was no piercing or probing of [Swain's] skin nor forced entry beyond the surface of h[er]\nbody. There was not even any touching of h[er] body.\" Klein, 522 F.2d at 300.\n[4]Rodriques concerned the defendants' physical probing of a plaintiff's vagina in a search for cocaine. Without in\nany way diminishing the seriousness of the intrusion into Swain's privacy in this case, the Rodriques facts were\nclearly more egregious. The type of search Rodriques hinted might be entirely prohibited was the physical body-\ncavity search, not the visual search executed in the present case.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
