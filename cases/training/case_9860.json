      "text": "479 F.Supp. 486 (1979)\nJill TINETTI, Plaintiff,\nv.\nLee WITTKE, Sheriff Racine County, Jane Doe, a Racine County Matron whose name is\nunknown, County of Racine, Defendants.\nNo. 79-C-447.\nUnited States District Court, E. D. Wisconsin.\nOctober 31, 1979.\n487 *487 Terry W. Rose, Cotton, Rose & Rose, Kenosha, Wis., for plaintiff.\n488 *488 Richard H. Kjeldgaard, Asst. County Corp. Counsel, Racine, Wis., for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\nWARREN, District Judge.\nPlaintiff brought this civil action on June 19, 1979, for declaratory and injunctive relief restraining defendants from\nstrip searching persons arrested for non-misdemeanor traffic violations absent probable cause to believe the\noffender is concealing weapons or contraband on his body. The facts are not in dispute and have been stipulated\nto by the parties.\nOn August 17, 1978, plaintiff, a resident of Colorado, was driving with her four children north on Highway I-94 in\nRacine County to her mother's home in New Berlin, Wisconsin. Plaintiff was arrested by a state police officer at\nabout 11:30 p. m. for speeding. Because she did not reside in Wisconsin, plaintiff was informed by the officer that\nshe would have to post a $40.00 cash bond. Plaintiff was unable to post the $40.00 cash bond, and the officer\nrequested that she follow him to the Racine County Jail.\nAt the Racine County Sheriff's Department, plaintiff was booked, photographed and then taken to a room by\ndefendant Jane Doe. Defendant Doe told plaintiff to remove her clothes, whereupon plaintiff refused, responding\nthat she was not a common criminal but was being held solely due to her inability to post bail for her traffic\noffense. Defendant Doe then again told plaintiff to \"strip,\" explaining that defendant would be performing a body\nsearch for contraband. Plaintiff complied, and when naked, was asked to bend over and spread her buttocks\nwhile defendant Doe visually inspected her genital and anal areas. Only plaintiff and defendant Doe were present\nin the room during the strip search. When defendant Doe had completed her examination, plaintiff was\nincarcerated in a cell for about two hours until her uncle posted the $40.00 cash bail.\nDefendant Doe's strip search of plaintiff was executed pursuant to a written policy of the Racine County Sheriff's\nDepartment that all persons detained in the Racine County Jail, regardless of the offense, be subject to a strip\nsearch. The policy provided that no touching of detainees would occur, and that the searches would be\nconducted by guards of the same sex as the detainees. The policy was based on procedures recommended by\nnational and state-wide organizations experienced in problems occurring in jails.\nThis Court issued a preliminary injunction on August 10, 1979, enjoining the defendants from undertaking,\nexploring, maintaining or adopting any policies, procedures, practices or acts of strip searching persons charged\nwith non-misdemeanor traffic offenses, except where law enforcement officials have probable cause to believe\nthat contraband or weapons are being concealed on the offender's body. In response to this injunction, the Sheriff\nof Racine County modified the policy of the Racine County Jail to prohibit strip searching non-misdemeanor traffic\nviolators held in jail before arraignment or trial unless there is probable cause to believe that contraband or\nweapons are being concealed. The Sheriff approved the same policy as applicable to a new jail facility in Racine\n\nCounty which, when opened in November, 1979, will house non-misdemeanor traffic violators awaiting a court\nappearance in a holding cell rather than with the general prison population.\nDefendants filed a motion for summary judgment on August 28, 1979. Plaintiff had earlier, on August 15, 1979,\nalso filed a motion for summary judgment. Summary judgment is appropriate only if, after viewing all of the\npleadings, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories and affidavits, this Court finds that there is no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Poller v.\nColumbia Broadcasting Corp., 368 U.S. 464, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962).\nDefendants contend, in support of their motion, that this case is moot because the strip-search policy challenged\n489 by plaintiff *489 has been stopped and there is no reasonable likelihood of its reoccurrence. While no case or\ncontroversy generally exists when allegedly illegal conduct has ceased, a case may be considered as not moot\nwhen the issue is \"capable of repetition yet evading review.\" Southern Pacific Terminal Company v. Interstate\nCommerce Commission, 219 U.S. 498, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911); see Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S.\n147, 96 S.Ct. 347, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975). The plaintiff must show, however, that there is some cognizable\ndanger of recurrent violations that is more than a mere possibility. United States v. W. T. Grant Company, 345\nU.S. 629, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953). Specifically, the challenged action must be too short in duration to\nbe fully litigated prior to its cessation, and there must be a reasonable expectation that the complaining party\nwould be subject to the same action again. Weinstein v. Bradford, supra; Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 95\nS.Ct. 2330, 45 L.Ed.2d 272 (1975).\nThis Court finds, from the undisputed evidence, that the present situation is one capable of repetition yet evading\nreview. Although the Racine County Sheriff has changed the strip search policy in conformance with this Court's\npreliminary injunction, the former policy could be reinstated by the Sheriff at any time. Furthermore, if a new\nSheriff is elected, nothing would preclude him, absent the present preliminary injunction, from reverting to the\nroutine practice of strip searching detainees. And while the new Racine jail facility purports to segregate traffic\nviolators from the general prison population, economic or spatial limitations could cause such policy to be ignored\nuntil further challenge. The resulting mixture of prisoners could cause an inadvertent reversion to the strip\nsearching of all detainees.\nThe occurrence of citations for traffic violations is certainly not a rarity in this society. Accordingly, the arrest of\ntraffic violators for unpaid fines or other minor offenses will occur frequently. In addition, the possibility of\nnonresident traffic violators being unable to post the required bond is also high. As such, there is more than a\nmere possibility that plaintiff, or any other traffic violator, would be subject to a strip search while awaiting an\narraignment or the posting of bail.\nIn addition to being capable of repetition, the present situation is one which may also evade review. While the\ntotal time involved in a strip search is minimal, the humiliation and embarrassment experienced by the offender\nare much more long lasting. If this Court holds the case moot, thus precluding plaintiff from being heard on the\nmerits, there is nothing to prevent defendants from reinstating the strip search policy until another challenge\narises. \"Where . . . state action or its imminence adversely affects the status of private parties, the courts should\nbe available to render appropriate relief and judgments affecting the parties' rights and interests.\" Super Tire\nEngineering Company v. McCorkle, 416 U.S. 115, 125, 94 S.Ct. 1694, 1699, 40 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974).\nFurthermore, \"the voluntary abandonment of a practice does not relieve a court of adjudicating its legality,\nparticularly where the practice is deeply rooted and long standing.\" Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 376, 83 S.Ct.\n801, 806, 9 L.Ed.2d 821 (1963).\nThe challenged practice has been in effect for several years. It was based on procedures recommended by\nreputable organizations, familiar with prison problems, which are based in New York, Washington, D. C., as well\nas Madison, Wisconsin. Defendants did not alter their policy until a preliminary injunction was issued against its\nmaintenance. Indeed, the defendants argued in their brief opposing the preliminary injunction that the policy was\nconstitutional and should be continued. Because of the long-standing use of the strip search procedure and\ndefendants' repeated earlier claim that the policy should be continued, the voluntary cessation of its use should\nnot leave the defendants \"free to return to . . . [their] old ways.\" United States v. W. T. Grant Company, 345 U.S.\n490 at 632, 73 S.Ct. at 897. Defendants' motion for summary *490 judgment must be and is hereby denied.\n\nProceeding to the plaintiff's claim, this Court agrees with plaintiff that, as a matter of law, the strip searching of\nplaintiff, a non-misdemeanor traffic violator who was incarcerated due to the inability to post cash bail, was an\nunconstitutional denial of the personal liberty guaranteed her by the United States Constitution. The Fourth\nAmendment of the United States Constitution provides that:\n[t]he right of the people to be secured in their persons . . . against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported\nby oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or\nthings to be seized.\nAlthough the prevalent rule is thus that searches or seizures may not be made without a warrant, an exception\nexists allowing a warrantless search incident to a lawful custodial arrest. United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800,\n94 S.Ct. 1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974); United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427\n(1973); Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). The mere fact that a person is\nvalidly arrested, however, does not mean that he may be subject to any search which the arresting officer feels is\nnecessary. United States v. Mills, 153 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 472 F.2d 1231 (D.C.Cir. 1972). Such searches have\ntraditionally been justified by the reasonableness of the discovery of, (1) weapons or instruments of escape; or\n(2) evidence which could be otherwise concealed or destroyed. United States v. Edwards, supra; United States v.\nMills, supra.\nNeither of these justifications are present in the instant case. Plaintiff was not searched by the arresting officer,\nwho apparently felt that there was no reason to believe plaintiff carried any weapons on her person or in her\nmotor vehicle. Plaintiff's offense itself, a non-misdemeanor traffic violation, generally does not involve the use of a\nweapon.\nFurthermore, the discovery of evidence was not a sufficient justification for the search of plaintiff, given the type\nof offense she committed. The only materially probative pieces of evidence as to plaintiff's exceeding of the\nspeed limit were the reading on the speedometer of the plaintiff's automobile, as remembered by plaintiff or her\npassengers, and the reading on the officer's speed-measuring device. As such, plaintiff had no reason to conceal,\nand the officer had no reason to suspect, the existence of any evidence which could be discovered through a\nstrip search of plaintiff.\nIn evaluating the propriety of an act alleged to have constituted an \"unreasonable\" search within the meaning of\nthe Fourth Amendment:\n[T]he permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged by balancing its intrusion on\nthe individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate government\ninterests . . . the reasonableness standard usually requires, at a minimum, that the facts upon\nwhich an intrusion is based be capable of measurement against an \"objective standard,\" whether\nthis be probable cause or a less stringent test. Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct.\n1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660, 667-8 (1979).\nThe undisputed facts show that plaintiff was strip searched as a part of a routine, long-standing policy of\ndefendants, without consideration as to whether probable cause existed to believe that she was concealing\nweapons or contraband. While law enforcement personnel do have a legitimate interest in discovering weapons\nor contraband, that interest cannot be indiscriminately satisfied by the strip searching of non-misdemeanor traffic\nviolators where there is no reason to believe that the violators have concealed any such articles. The intrusion on\none's personal dignity occasioned by such searches requires that some justifiable basis exist.\n491 The basic error in defendants' across-the-board use of strip searches was *491 recently articulated in Sala v.\nCounty of Suffolk, (E.D.N.Y. 11/28/78) (unpublished decision), which involved a fact situation very similar to that\nof the present case. One of the plaintiffs in Sala had been arrested for failure to pay a $15 speeding fine. The\nother plaintiff had been arrested for failure to respond to a summons which had been sent to the wrong address.\nBoth had been strip searched in the same manner as plaintiff, and pursuant to a policy of routine searches. In\nholding the policy unconstitutional, the court, in an oral decision, stated:\n\nHere on one side of the balance scale we have the intrusion into personal dignity and privacy in a\nway that for some people at least might cause serious emotional distress. A search of [this] . . type\n. . . including the visual inspection of the anal and genital areas, has been characterized by\nvarious witnesses here, and by judges in some other cases, as demeaning, dehumanizing,\nundignified, humiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and\nsubmission . . .. The search procedure is unconstitutional, because, while it is rationally related to\nthe objective sought, discovering weapons, it is not the least intrusive means which could\naccomplish the same result . . balancing all of [the] factors, the defendant's application of the\nsearch procedure . . . as a matter of routine, to all persons brought to the Happaque detention\nfacilities on warrants to appear before a district court judge on petty offenses, has no reasonable\nnor rational basis, constitutes a denial of liberty without due process of law, violates the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments, and also constituted an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth\nand Fourteenth Amendments of the constitution. Sala v. County of Suffolk (E.D.N.Y.1978),\ntranscript pp. 715(a), 717(a), 719(a).\nUnlike pretrial detainees charged with a criminal offense, there is little reason to suspect that traffic violators will\nconceal contraband or weapons, particularly when they are incarcerated solely due to their inability to post cash\nbail. Defendants' blanket strip search policy cannot be maintained when to do so intrudes into the personal\ndignity of traffic violators without any relation to the likelihood of his concealment of weapons or contraband. For\nthe foregoing reasons, the policy, as a matter of law, violates the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of\nthe United States Constitution. Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment must be and is hereby granted.\nPlaintiff seeks not only declaratory relief adjudging defendants' strip search policy unconstitutional as applied to\nher, but also permanent injunctive relief. Although plaintiff brought her claim as an individual rather than as part of\na class action, the general rule is that where requested injunctive relief is appropriate when it will benefit the\nclaimant and all others subject to the practice under attack. Sandford v. Coleman Realty Company, Inc., 573 F.2d\n173 (4th Cir. 1978). Thus, a permanent injunction may issue from this Court applying to plaintiff as well as other\nnon-misdemeanor traffic violators who might be affected by defendants' strip search policy.\nAccordingly, for the reasons given, this Court declares that the defendants' subjection of plaintiff, a non-\nmisdemeanor traffic violator incarcerated only due to the inability to post cash bond, to a strip search without\nprobable cause to believe that she was concealing weapons or contraband on her body was a violation of the\nplaintiff's rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\nFurthermore, this Court permanently enjoins and restrains defendants from undertaking, enforcing, maintaining or\nadopting any policies, procedure, practices or acts of strip searching persons charged with traffic offenses which\nare not misdemeanors except where law enforcement officers have probable cause to believe that contraband or\nweapons are being concealed on the person of the traffic violator.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The searches were conducted upon all such offenders who were detained \novernight in the Racine County jail due to an unwillingness or inability to post bond before \ntheir initial appearance in court.[1] The searches were conducted despite the absence of any \nprobable cause to believe that the detainees were concealing contraband or weapons on \ntheir bodies.
