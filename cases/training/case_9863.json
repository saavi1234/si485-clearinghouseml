The Plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for damages, claiming that his Fourth Amendment rights had been violated. Specifically, plaintiff claimed that being required to submit to strip-searches when he was visiting his father in prison was an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.</p><p>On March 8, 1989, plaintiff's father was incarcerated at the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility managed by the Department of Correctional Services in the state of New York.  When the plaintiff was visiting his father on March 8, one corrections officer ordered him into a side room where he was visually strip and cavity searched. He was then detained in the Special Housing Unit, a solitary confinement area of the jail for 27 hours, so the corrections officers could investigate the content of his feces.  On a subsequent visit, the plaintiff was strip searched again, but this time he was required to sign a consent form, and there were signs posted that informed visitors that strip searches could be made a condition of visitation. </p><p>On October 6, 1994, The Court (Judge John Bartels) ruled, granting the plaintiff's motion to amend his complaint and denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment. (867 F.Supp. 1145). The Court found that the plaintiff retained an expectation of privacy when in the Arthur Kill facility, that he had not waived his rights by signing a consent form, and that the defendants had failed to show there was any objective fact to suggest the plaintiff had been smuggling drugs. There was therefore a genuine issue of material fact regarding the reasonable suspicion for the search under Bell v. Wolfish.  </p><p>On May 10, 1996, after another round of denial of motions for summary judgment, the defendants filed in interlocutory appeal on the basis of qualified immunity to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p><p>On August 18, 1997, Judge Daniel Friedmann, writing for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Judge Friedmann, Judge Amayla Kearse, Judge Jon Ormand) found that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. (123 F.3d 75). The Court reasoned that because a District Attorney for Kings' County had communicated that they had received reliable information that plaintiff would attempt to smuggle drugs into the jail, the corrections officers were acting on reasonable suspicion, even though the source of the tip was unknown. Therefore, because the law was not clearly established on the question of whether or not an attorney communicating unsourced information about drug smuggling constitutes reasonable suspicion, defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The case was remanded to the district court, with an Order to dismiss the case.</p><p></p>",

Lambeson, Assistant Attorney General, New York City (Dennis C. Vacco, Attorney General of New\nYork, on the brief), for Defendants-Appellants-Cross Appellees.\n77 Thomas E. Butler, New York City (Chadbourne & Parke, Bernard W. McCarthy, *77 Sankar Suryananayan, New\nYork City, on the brief), for Plaintiff-Appellee-Cross Appellant.\n[*]\nBefore: NEWMAN, KEARSE and FRIEDMAN , Circuit Judges.\nFRIEDMAN, Circuit Judge:\nI\nA. In March 1989, Kings County Assistant District Attorney Eric Seidel, then Deputy Chief of the Narcotics\nBureau, telephoned Brian Malone, Inspector General for the New York State Department of Correctional Services\n(the \"Department\") and told him that \"he had received information from what he believed to be a reliable source\nthat Anthony Varrone and Claire Varrone would be visiting Joseph Varrone, their father and husband, then an\ninmate at the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility (\"Arthur Kill\") in the near future and that, at such time, they would be\nbringing heroin into the facility.\" Seidel no longer remembers the source of this information, but stated that \"the\ninformation either came from a person who was a confidential informant of ours or electronic surveillance,\" and\n\"was reliable enough to be passed on to the Department of Corrections.\" Seidel did not tell Malone the source of\nthe information, and Malone did not ask.\nUpon reviewing the information in the Department's computers on Joseph Varrone, Malone learned that he was\nincarcerated for selling a controlled substance. Malone was aware that his office was investigating other alleged\ninstances of drug smuggling into Arthur Kill. Malone directed his immediate subordinate, Deputy Inspector\nGeneral Thomas Mansfield, to determine whether Joseph Varrone's wife or son had visited Arthur Kill on March\n3, 1989. He also directed Mansfield to strip search Claire and Anthony Varrone on their next visits. Mansfield,\nwho had no recollection about the details of what occurred, assigned the matter to Investigator Juan Ramos.\nRamos stated that, when given such a task, he would customarily conduct \"some sort of background\ninvestigation.\" Although Ramos could not recall the details of his investigation, he remembered \"at the very least\"\nrunning a background check on Joseph Varrone and cross referencing all available information. Such a\nbackground check reveals the inmate's complete history, including the reason for the incarceration, as well as\nknown co-defendants. A background check on Joseph Varrone would have disclosed that he was incarcerated for\n\na drug-related crime, and that Anthony Varrone was a co-defendant with his father in the criminal case that\nresulted in Joseph Varrone's incarceration.\nRamos sent a memorandum to the Deputy Superintendent of Security at Arthur Kill, Gerald Wells, requesting that\nWells ensure that any person seeking to visit Joseph Varrone submit to a strip search as a condition of visitation.\nWells stated that he knew nothing about the information or its reliability, and that he \"did absolutely nothing to\nimplement the strip search order.\"\nWells delegated the matter to his immediate subordinate, Thomas Eisenschmidt, who had no specific memory of\nthe strip search of Varrone. He ordered Henrique Frett, a lieutenant at Arthur Kill, to make the strip searches.\nFrett testified that he did not know the reason for the searches, but he directed Corrections Sergeant John\nMatthews to search Joseph Varrone's visitors.\nInmate Joseph Varrone was strip searched on March 8, 1989. On March 9, 1989, Claire Varrone agreed to a strip\nsearch as a condition of visiting her husband, and on March 10, 1989, Anthony Varrone similarly consented, and\nMatthews strip searched him. None of these searches uncovered any drugs.\nB. Anthony Varrone (hereinafter \"Varrone\") filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York seeking damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the state officers for strip searching him.\n78 As finally amended, the complaint named as defendants the appellants Matthews, Ramos, Eisenschmidt, Wells, \n*78 Mansfield, Malone and Frett. Varrone's suit subsequently was consolidated with similar actions filed by\nJoseph Varrone and Claire Varrone, but the district court dismissed the latter claims as untimely. Varrone v.\nBilotti, 851 F.Supp. 54 (E.D.N.Y.1993).\nMatthews moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, which the district court denied. It held\nthat, for purposes of qualified immunity, it was clearly established at the time that strip searches of prison visitors\ncould be made only when based upon reasonable suspicion. Varrone v. Bilotti, 867 F.Supp. 1145 (E.D.N.Y.1994).\nThe court stated that a visitor's signed consent to a search, which is a condition of visitation and hence\ninvoluntary, did not constitute a waiver of Fourth Amendment rights.\nBoth sides then cross moved for summary judgment 00 the defendants on the ground of qualified immunity and\n97\nthe plaintiff on the ground that no reasonable trier of fact could find that the defendants' search was based on\nreasonable suspicion. The district court denied both motions. Noting that it had previously held that, for purposes\nof qualified immunity, a correctional officer must have \"reasonable suspicion\" before making a prison visitor\nsubmit to a strip search, the court ruled that none of the officials was entitled to qualified immunity because none\nhad assessed whether reasonable suspicion existed to search Varrone. With respect to Frett and Matthews, the\nofficers who conducted the search, the court stated that their actions were ministerial and ruled that qualified\nimmunity \"is not available to government employees in the discharge of ministerial tasks.\"\nThe court also denied Varrone's motion for summary judgment, stating that \"[t]he inquiry into whether an official's\nactions were objectively reasonable and, therefore, qualifiedly immune, is separate from the determination of\nwhether the actions resulted in a violation of a plaintiff's constitutional rights.\" Because of unanswered questions\nabout the reliability of the information on which the search was based, the court concluded that genuine issues of\nmaterial fact existed regarding whether the correctional officers violated Varrone's rights.\nThe correctional officers appeal from the order denying them qualified immunity. To the extent it turns solely on\nissues of law, such an order is immediately appealable. See Behrens v. Pelletier, ___ U.S. ___, ___ U.S. ___,\n___, 116 S.Ct. 834, 841, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). Varrone cross-appeals from the denial of summary judgment in\nhis favor, requesting this court to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction.\nII\nA. The doctrine of qualified immunity generally provides\ngovernment officials performing discretionary functions with a qualified immunity, shielding them\nfrom civil damages liability as long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent\n\nwith the rights they are alleged to have violated. Somewhat more concretely, whether an official\nprotected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawful official\naction generally turns on the \"objective legal reasonableness\" of the action, assessed in light of\nthe legal rules that were \"clearly established\" at the time it was taken.\nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638-639, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3038-39, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (citations\nomitted). See also Hathaway v. Coughlin, 37 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.1994),cert. denied,513 U.S. 1154, 115 S.Ct.\n1108, 130 L.Ed.2d 1074 (1995). Since qualified immunity is an affirmative defense, the defendants bear the\nburden of showing that the challenged act was objectively reasonable in light of the law existing at that time. See \nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2736, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).\nThe district court here correctly stated that at the time of the strip search, under the \"law of the United States\nSupreme Court, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the other circuit courts of appeals,\" a search of\nprison visitors without reasonable suspicion violated clearly established law. Varrone v. Bilotti, 867 F.Supp. at\n1153. The district court noted that although neither the Supreme Court nor this court had explicitly applied the\n79 reasonablesuspicion *79 standard to strip searches of prison visitors, see id., \"under certain circumstances, the\nabsence of specific authority directly on point will not preclude a finding that the law was clearly established.\" \nShabazz v. Coughlin, 852 F.2d 697, 701 (2d Cir. 1988). The law was \"clearly established\" if the circuit's decisions\n\"clearly foreshadow\" a particular ruling on the issue. Id. Decisions of other circuits also may indicate whether the\nlaw was clearly established. See Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 803-804 (2d Cir.1986) (relying upon decisions of\nother circuits in making a qualified immunity determination), cert. denied,483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97\nL.Ed.2d 762 (1987).\nPrior to the strip search on March 10, 1989, three other circuits had established a \"reasonable suspicion\"\nstandard for strip searches of prison visitors. See Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 569 (1st Cir.1985); Thorne v.\nJones, 765 F.2d 1270, 1277 (5th Cir.1985),cert. denied,475 U.S. 1016, 106 S.Ct. 1198, 89 L.Ed.2d 313 (1986); \nHunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668, 674 (8th Cir.1982). Decisions of this court also foreshadowed that standard. See \nSecurity and Law Enforcement Employees v. Carey, 737 F.2d 187, 205 (2d Cir.1984) (relying on Hunter v. Auger\nin applying the reasonable suspicion standard to strip searches of prison guards, by analogizing them to the\nprison visitors in Hunter). See also Weber, 804 F.2d at 804 (adopting the reasonable suspicion standard for strip\nsearches of misdemeanor arrestees); Black v. Amico, 387 F.Supp. 88, 92 (W.D.N.Y.1974) (applying \"real\nsuspicion\" test to prison visitor strip search). Accordingly, we agree with the district court that the law was clearly\nestablished that correctional officers needed reasonable suspicion to strip search prison visitors without violating\ntheir constitutional rights. The question, therefore, is whether the information the officers had when they directed\nand conducted the strip search of Varrone created a reasonable suspicion that he was bringing drugs into the\nprison.\n\"A `reasonable suspicion' of wrongdoing is something stronger than a mere `hunch,' but something weaker than\nprobable cause.\" Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 929 (1st Cir.1996) (citations omitted). To establish reasonable\nsuspicion, \"prison officials must point to specific objective facts and rational inferences that they are entitled to\ndraw from those facts in light of their experience.\" Hunter, 672 F.2d at 674. The standard requires \"individualized\nsuspicion, specifically directed to the person who is targeted for the strip search.\" Id. at 675. In determining\nwhether reasonable suspicion existed, the factors that may be considered include: \"(1) the nature of the tip or\ninformation; (2) the reliability of the informant; (3) the degree of corroboration; and (4) other factors contributing to\nsuspicion or lack thereof.\" Security and law Enforcement Employees, 737 F.2d at 205.\nIn making that determination, it is important to keep in mind that \"[t]he day-to-day problems of administering and\noperating correctional facilities are demanding and complex and this reality must be accorded some weight by\nfederal courts even when confronted with constitutional challenges.\" Id.; see also Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520,\n547, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1878, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).\nB. The information that Seidel gave Malone, coupled with the additional information Malone learned and had,\nvery likely sufficed to provide reasonable suspicion that Varrone would attempt to bring drugs into Arthur Kill, and,\nin any event, it was objectively reasonable for Malone to believe that he was acting on the basis of reasonable\nsuspicion which suffices to confer qualified immunity. See Doe v. Marsh, 105 F.3d 106, 109-10 (2d Cir.1997) (a\ngovernment official is entitled to qualified immunity if it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that his\n\nactions did not violate an established right); Wachtler v. County of Herkimer, 35 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.1994)\n(qualified immunity protects an official \"`if it was \"objectively reasonable\" for him to believe his acts were lawful'\")\n(quoting Magnotti v. Kuntz, 918 F.2d 364, 367 (2d Cir.1990) (citation omitted)). The information was given to\nMalone by an assistant district attorney who was deputy chief of the narcotics bureau. The information was\nprecise, specific and detailed. It stated that Seidel had \"received information from what he believed to be a\n80 reliable source\" that Varrone and his mother would be visiting *80 Joseph Varrone (his father and her husband) at\nArthur Kill \"in the near future\" and that at that time they \"would be bringing heroin into the facility.\" The information\nidentified the smugglers by name, stated where and when they would commit the offense and specified the\nparticular drug they would attempt to smuggle.\nUpon checking the records, Malone discovered that Joseph Varrone was imprisoned for the sale of drugs.\nMalone also was aware that his office was investigating other alleged instances of drug smuggling into Arthur Kill.\nContrary to Varrone's contention, Malone thus did not rely solely upon a wholly uncorroborated \"tip\" in ordering\nthat Varrone be strip searched the next time he visited his father at Arthur Kill. To the contrary, the specific\ninformation Malone had was sufficient to create reasonable suspicion that Varrone would attempt to smuggle\nheroin into Arthur Kill in the near future.\nIn concluding that Malone was not entitled to qualified immunity, the district court stressed that Malone himself\nhad not made any independent investigation of the reliability of the informant or of the information Seidel had\nsupplied. We reject any requirement that information about an impending crime cannot constitute reasonable\nsuspicion unless the recipient of the information personally has independently investigated its reliability. The\ndistrict court's requirement improperly would import into the standards governing reasonable suspicion the more\nstringent standards governing probable cause. As the Supreme Court has pointed out:\nReasonable suspicion is a less demanding standard than probable cause not only in the sense\nthat reasonable suspicion can be established with information that is different in quantity or\ncontent than that required to establish probable cause, but also in the sense that reasonable\nsuspicion can arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show probable\ncause.\nAlabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990).\nVarrone relies upon Daugherty v. Campbell, 33 F.3d 554 (6th Cir.1994), to support his contention that because\nMalone did not independently assess or investigate the reliability of the information Seidel gave him, that\ninformation was insufficient to create reasonable suspicion. That decision, which is not binding precedent in this\ncourt, is distinguishable.\nIn that case a prison corrections officer told the warden (Campbell) that Lenora Daugherty was smuggling drugs\non her person into the prison where her husband was an inmate, when she visited him. The warden also received\ntwo letters 00 one anonymous and the other bearing the signature of a non-existent person 00 indicating that\n97 97\nDaugherty was smuggling drugs into the prison. Relying solely on the information the corrections officer had\nsupplied, the warden ordered that Daugherty be strip searched prior to visiting her husband. When she was so\nsearched, no drugs were found.\nDaugherty filed suit against the warden and others under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, alleging that the strip search violated\nher rights under the 4th and 14th Amendments. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants\non the 14th Amendment claim, holding that they were entitled to qualified immunity, and the jury found for the\ndefendants on the 4th Amendment claim. Id. at 555.\nA divided Sixth Circuit reversed. The court held that the warden's \"reliance on a wholly uncorroborated tip is,\nunder the facts on this case, insufficient to constitute reasonable suspicion.\" Id. at 557. \"[W]e hold, as a matter of\nlaw, in this case, where no independent objective information existed, the information upon which Campbell relied\nwas insufficient to warrant a strip search.\" Id.\nIn the present case, as we have shown, Malone acted on more than \"a wholly uncorroborated tip\" in ordering that\nVarrone be strip searched. Seidel, the assistant chief of the narcotics bureau, told Malone that the information\n\nsupplied came from what \"he believed to be a reliable source.\" There is no indication that the corrections officer\nin Daugherty provided similar attestation. In addition to the information Seidel provided, Malone ascertained that\n81 Joseph Varrone was *81 incarcerated on a drug conviction and knew that his office was investigating other\nalleged instances of drug smuggling into Arthur Kill 00 two facts not present in Daugherty.\n97\nWe conclude that here Malone, at a minimum, was objectively reasonable in believing that he had \"`reasonable\ngrounds for suspecting' that a search of a particular person w[ould] reveal the particular items sought.\" Id. at 560\n(dissenting opinion, citation omitted). Malone's decision to order that Varrone be strip searched on his next visit to\nhis father was protected by qualified immunity.\nC. After Malone obtained the foregoing information, he instructed his immediate subordinate, Deputy Inspector\nGeneral Mansfield, to strip search Varrone on his next visit to Arthur Kill. Mansfield assigned the matter to\ninvestigator Ramos, who made a background check on Joseph Varrone that would have disclosed that his son,\nthe appellee Varrone, was a co-defendant with his father in the drug case that resulted in Joseph Varrone's\nimprisonment. Ramos then requested Wells, the deputy superintendent of security at Arthur Kill, to strip-search\nanyone seeking to visit Joseph Varrone. Wells delegated the strip-search instruction to his immediate\nsubordinate, Eisenschmidt, who in turn delegated the order to officers Frett and Matthews, who conducted the\nstrip search.\nExcept for the background check on Joseph Varrone that Ramos made, none of these officers did anything more\nthan pass on the order to strip search Joseph Varrone's visitors and, in the case of Frett and Matthews, execute\nthe order. None of them attempted to determine the basis for the order or the reliability of the information upon\nwhich it was based.\nThe district court held that the first four of these officials 00 Mansfield, Ramos, Wells and Eisenschmidt 00 were not\n97 97\nentitled to qualified immunity because they had not independently investigated the basis for the strip search order\nand the reliability of the information upon which it was based; and that Frett and Matthews, who conducted the\nactual strip search, were not entitled to qualified immunity because they performed only a ministerial act that\ninvolved no exercise of discretion. We disagree with both rulings.\n1. As we hold, the information Malone possessed gave him a reasonable basis for believing that there was\nreasonable suspicion that Varrone would attempt to smuggle heroin into Arthur Kill when he visited his father\nthere and gave Malone qualified immunity for his decision to direct that Varrone be strip searched. Since the four\nsubordinate officers were merely carrying out Malone's instruction and that of their immediate superior when they\nordered the strip search, they were entitled to the same immunity Malone had. There is no claim that the order\nwas facially invalid or obviously illegal; prison strip searches are not uncommon. To require the four officers\nindependently to investigate the basis for the apparently valid order they received, as a condition to having the\nsame qualified immunity that the source of the order (Malone) had, would create serious problems in the\nadministration of a prison and be detrimental to the maintenance of proper order and discipline there.\nIn view of the problems and realities that face prison officers, including dealing with drugs in those institutions,\nand the deference and discretion given those officers' day-to-day decisions relating to prison safety, security and\ndiscipline, Bell, 441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878 each of these officials had qualified immunity for carrying out\nhis supervisor's directive, even though he did not independently investigate the basis and reason for the order. \nSee Illinois v. Andreas, 463 U.S. 765, 771-72 n. 5, 103 S.Ct. 3319, 3324 n. 5, 77 L.Ed.2d 1003 (1983) (\"[W]here\nlaw enforcement authorities are cooperating in an investigation ... the knowledge of one is presumed shared by\nall.\"); Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo. State Penitentiary, 401 U.S. 560, 568, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 1036, 28 L.Ed.2d 306\n(1971) (\"[P]olice officers called upon to aid other officers in executing arrest warrants are entitled to assume that\nthe officers requesting aid [had properly determined the existence of] probable cause.\"). See also Wood, 89 F.3d\nat 930 (superintendent of a correctional facility may rely on the investigations of other corrections officers without\n82 having to conduct an independent inquiry). Each of these four officers was protected by *82 qualified immunity in\ndirecting his subordinate to strip search Varrone.\n2. The district court held that the two officers who actually conducted the search, Frett and Matthews, did not\nhave qualified immunity because their actions were ministerial and did not involve any exercise of discretion. The\ncourt relied on cases holding that qualified immunity covers only discretionary acts of government officials. See,\n\ne.g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 816, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2737, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). That general\nprinciple, however, cannot properly be applied here to deny those two corrections officers qualified immunity.\nThe continued validity of the ministerial-discretionary function distinction in determining qualified immunity has\nbeen questioned. See Gagne v. City of Galveston, 805 F.2d 558, 559-60 (5th Cir.1986) (the ministerial duty\nexception to qualified immunity is extremely narrow and police officers have such immunity for all actions\nperformed in the course of their official duties), cert. denied, Gagne v. Putnal, 483 U.S. 1021, 107 S.Ct. 3266, 97\nL.Ed.2d 764 (1987); Coleman v. Frantz, 754 F.2d 719, 727 (7th Cir.1985) (noting the difficulty in applying the\nministerial-discretionary distinction and stating that to determine immunity based on such a distinction \"would do\nlittle to forward the purposes of immunity\"). Both the Supreme Court and this court, however, have continued to\narticulate the distinction. See Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 194 n. 14, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 3020, 82 L.Ed.2d 139\n(1984); Harlow, 457 U.S. at 816, 102 S.Ct. at 2737; Walz v. Smithtown, 46 F.3d 162, 169 (2d Cir.1995). We need\nnot here decide whether the distinction continues to have validity because we conclude that even if these two\nsubordinate officers performed solely a ministerial function in conducting the strip search, they still have qualified\nimmunity for carrying out the order, not facially invalid, issued by a superior officer who is protected by qualified\nimmunity.\nThe reasons set forth in Part II(B)(1) for granting qualified immunity to the four officers are equally applicable to\nthe two subordinate officers who conducted the strip search. Realistically, those two officers had no choice but to\ncarry out the order they received, which was facially valid. It would be anomalous to provide qualified immunity to\nthe higher ranking officers who ordered the strip search, but to deny it to the subordinates who carried out the\norder. See Williamson v. City of Virginia Beach, 786 F.Supp. 1238, 1260-61 n. 28 (E.D.Va.1992) (eliminating the\nministerial-discretionary distinction for qualified immunity in Section 1983 actions \"remedies the perverse notion\nthat high ranking officials with discretionary and policy-making powers (and likely access to counsel) are immune\nfrom suit when similar immunity from suit is unavailable to lowly functionaries who have little, if any, choice in\ncarrying out their ministerial functions\"), aff'd.,991 F.2d 793 (4th Cir.1993) (table).\nThose two subordinate officers are entitled to qualified immunity for conducting the strip search of Varrone\npursuant to the facially lawful order of their superior officer, even if making the search involved the performance\nof a ministerial function.\nIII\nIn view of our decision that all the appellants are entitled to qualified immunity, the issue raised by Varrone's\ncross appeal 00 whether the district court should have granted him summary judgment instead of setting the case\n97\nfor trial 00 is moot. Moreover, it is doubtful whether we would have jurisdiction over the cross-appeal. See Swint v.\n97\nChambers County Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 43-51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 1208-12, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995). The cross-\nappeal will be dismissed.\nCONCLUSION\nThe order of the district court denying the defendants' motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity\nis reversed, and the case is remanded to that court to dismiss the complaint on that ground. The cross appeal is\ndismissed as moot.\n[*] Daniel M.

      "text": "851 F.Supp. 54 (1993)\nJoseph, Claire, and Anthony VARRONE, Plaintiffs,\nv.\nM. BILOTTI, et al., Defendants.\nNo. 92-CV-1290 (JRB).\nUnited States District Court, E.D. New York.\nSeptember 22, 1993.\n55 *55 Bernard W. McCarthy, Chadbourne & Parke, New York City, for plaintiffs.\nRobert Abrams, Atty. Gen. of the State of New York by Frederic L. Lieberman, New York City, for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER\nBARTELS, District Judge.\nThe defendants Michael Bilotti, John Matthews, Bert Ross, and Francisco Berrios move under Rule 12(c) of the\n[1]\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure for judgment on the pleadings.  The defendants seek dismissal of two of three\nconsolidated actions, each brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, on the grounds that the claims asserted therein\nare barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\nBy order dated October 26, 1992, this Court consolidated three Section 1983 actions entitled Joseph Varrone v.\nBilotti, 92-CV-1290, Claire Varrone v. Bilotti, 92-CV-1408, and Anthony Varrone v. Bilotti, 92-CV-1409. Each of the\nabove-named actions asserted that the defendants violated each of the plaintiffs' civil rights on separate but\nrelated occasions.\nBACKGROUND\nAt the time of the events precipitating this consolidated action, the plaintiff Joseph Varrone (\"Joseph\") was\nincarcerated at the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility in New York (the \"Facility\"). On or about March 8, 1989,\nJoseph's son, plaintiff Anthony Varrone (\"Anthony\"), and Susan Wight (not a party to this action) spent what\nprison officials term a \"contact visit\" with Joseph at the Facility during regular visitation hours. Following their\ndeparture, prison officials (presumably including one or more of the defendants) subjected Joseph to a \"strip\nfrisk.\" The defendants apparently contend that such frisks are performed routinely on inmates after contact visits.\nJoseph alleges that immediately following the strip frisk defendant Berrios, a correctional officer at the Facility,\ninformed him that he would be placed in the Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\"), an area of solitary confinement within\nthe Facility, because Berrios suspected Joseph and Anthony of having exchanged certain unidentified contraband\nduring their contact visit. Defendant Berrios admittedly placed Joseph in an SHU \"drug watch\" cell, where the\nparties agree that Joseph was held for a period of twenty-seven hours. Plaintiff's SHU confinement thus extended\nfrom March 8 through March 9, 1989. While Joseph was confined in the drug watch cell, the defendants\ninspected his bowel movement, which proved negative for contraband. Joseph asserts that the twenty-seven-\nhour SHU confinement constitutes a violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\nThe Section 1983 claim asserted by Joseph's wife, the plaintiff Claire Varrone (\"Claire\"), is founded upon events\noccurring on March 9, 1989 when Claire went to visit her husband. Upon Claire's arrival at the Facility, the\ndefendant Bilotti, a correction sergeant assigned to the visiting room of the Facility at the time in question,\n56 informed her that before she would be permitted to see Joseph she was required to submit to a strip *56 search.\nThe defendants admit that defendant Johnson, a corrections officer at the Facility, escorted Claire to a private\nroom where she then conducted a strip search that uncovered no contraband. Defendant Johnson then escorted\n\nClaire to SHU, where the defendants permitted her a non-contact visit with Joseph. Claire avers that the\ndefendants violated her civil rights by wrongfully subjecting her to the strip search.\nThe plaintiff Anthony alleges that the defendants violated 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 on March 10, 1989 when he again\nvisited his father at the Facility. Upon Anthony's arrival, defendant Matthews, a Facility correction sergeant\nassigned to the visiting room at the relevant time, informed Anthony that he, too, must submit to a strip search\nbefore he would be granted visitation privileges. Anthony admits having signed a Consent to Search form before\ndefendant Matthews escorted him to a private room where a full-body search proved negative for contraband.\nThis strip search serves as the foundation of Anthony's Section 1983 claim.\nAlthough the plaintiffs currently are represented by counsel, at the time they filed their respective complaints,\neach of the plaintiffs was proceeding pro se. Joseph presented his complaint against the defendants to the pro se\noffice on March 10, 1992, and his complaint thereafter was filed with the Clerk of this Court on March 19, 1992.\nSimilarly, plaintiffs Claire and Anthony presented complaints to the pro se office on March 10, 1992, which\nsubsequently were filed with the Court on March 25, 1992. The present motion challenges only the timeliness of\nplaintiffs Joseph and Claire's Section 1983 claims.\nDISCUSSION\nA Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings \"may be interposed after the answer is filed, as a vehicle for\nraising defenses enumerated in Rule 12(b).\" Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. Time, Inc., 785 F.Supp. 371, 375 n. 11\n(S.D.N.Y.1992). Thus, a statute of limitations defense properly is the subject of a Rule 12(c) motion. See, e.g., \nOrtiz v. Cornetta, 867 F.2d 146, 148 (2d Cir.1989); Viacom Int'l, Inc., 785 F.Supp. at 375 n. 11.\nThe federal courts generally \"`have followed a fairly restrictive standard in ruling on motions for judgment on the\npleadings,'\" McNeill v. New York City Housing Authority, 719 F.Supp. 233, 256 (S.D.N.Y.1989) (quoting 5 C.\nWright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, ยง 1368, p. 689 [1969]), granting such motions only \"where\nmaterial facts are undisputed and ... judgment on the merits is possible merely by considering the contents of the\npleadings.\" Sellers v. M.C. Floor Crafters, Inc., 842 F.2d 639, 642 (2d Cir.1988). On Rule 12(c) motions, the court\nis compelled to accept as true \"all of the well pleaded facts alleged\" by the nonmoving party, Bloor v. Carro,\nSpanbock, Londin, Rodman & Fass, 754 F.2d 57, 61 (2d Cir.1985), and must draw all reasonable inferences\ntherefrom in his favor. DeSantis v. United States, 783 F.Supp. 165, 168 (S.D.N.Y.1992). Where, as here,\ndefendant alleges that the plaintiff's claims are untimely, dismissal is improper unless it \"appears beyond doubt\"\nthat the plaintiff's claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Egelston v. State University College, 535\nF.2d 752, 754 (2d Cir.1976).\nThe parties do not dispute that the three-year statute of limitations provided in Section 214(5) of the New York\nCivil Practice Law and Rules applies to actions brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235,\n109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985).\nThe Second Circuit has applied this limitations period strictly. See Day v. Morgenthau, 909 F.2d 75, 79 (2d Cir.),\namended on reh'g, 17 Fed.R.Serv.3d 1420 (2d Cir.1990). The parties also agree that the plaintiffs' Section 1983\nclaims accrued for limitations purposes at the time that each of the plaintiffs knew or had reason to know of the\ninjury forming the basis of his or her action. Cullen v. Margiotta, 811 F.2d 698, 725 (2d Cir.),cert. denied,483\nU.S. 1021, 107 S.Ct. 3266, 97 L.Ed.2d 764 (1987). Thus, the parties concur that for plaintiffs Joseph and Claire's\n57 civil rights claims, the statute began to run, at the very *57 latest, on March 9, 1989.[2]\nAlthough the parties dispute whether the plaintiffs Joseph and Claire's actions were commenced on March 19,\n1992 and March 25, 1992, respectively (the dates upon which the plaintiffs filed their complaints with the Court),\nor whether, as the plaintiffs contend vehemently, the actions were deemed commenced on March 10, 1992 upon\ntheir presentation to the pro se office, the Court finds it unnecessary to resolve this issue because, in either case,\nthe plaintiffs' claims are untimely.\nThe plaintiffs' opposition to the present motion centers exclusively on their appeal to this Court to grant them\nleniency and to apply a less stringent standard to the plaintiffs as pro se litigants. This Court is sympathetic to the\nplight of the unrepresented and is mindful of the clearly announced principle that encourages the federal courts to\n\naccord pro se litigants greater leniency with respect to certain procedural requirements more easily fulfilled by\nmembers of the bar. See, e.g., Mount v. Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc., 555 F.2d 1108, 1112 (2d Cir.1977) (\"A\nlayman representing himself ... is entitled to a certain liberality with respect to procedural requirements\"); Stewart\nv. United States Postal Service, 649 F.Supp. 1531, 1535 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (\"the law downplays the strict application\nof harsh procedural rules when a party is pro se\"). Moreover, the Court has given careful consideration to the\ngeneral rule that where, as here, \"pro se papers implicate the vindication of civil rights or civil liberties,\" they are\nto receive a particularly liberal construction. Stewart, 649 F.Supp. at 1535. Accord Branum v. Clark, 927 F.2d 698,\n705 (2d Cir. 1991); Williams v. King, 796 F.Supp. 737, 739 (E.D.N.Y.1992).\nHowever, the net effect of the principles cited above does not require that the courts disregard completely\nprocedural requirements or rules of substantive law whenever a pro se litigant alleges a civil rights violation.\nRather, although the courts have \"an obligation to make reasonable allowances to protect pro se litigants from\ninadvertent forfeiture of important rights ... `[t]he right of self-representation does not exempt a party from\ncompliance with the relevant rules of procedural and substantive law.'\" Clarke v. Bank of New York, 687 F.Supp.\n863, 871 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (internal citation omitted) (quoting Birl v. Estelle, 660 F.2d 592, 593 [5th Cir.1981]). See\nalso Michelson v. Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 619 F.Supp. 727, 741-42 (S.D.N.Y.1985) (\"pro se\nlitigants ... like all parties to a litigation, cannot rely upon [their] pro se status as a shield from all mistakes but\nmust at some point bear the consequences of [their] procedural errors\").\nThe plaintiffs correctly note that the courts of this Circuit generally have accorded pro se litigants latitude with\nrespect to meeting procedural requirements. One way in which this liberal approach has manifested itself is in the\ndevelopment of the principle that a pro se complaint filed beyond the statutory bar may be considered\ncommenced timely if received by the pro se clerk's office when the statute of limitations has not yet expired. See,\ne.g., Toliver v. County of Sullivan, 841 F.2d 41, 42 (2d Cir.1988). However, even granting the plaintiffs the latitude\nthey request and according them the benefit of this approach does not render their claims timely, as both Joseph\nand Claire's complaints were not presented to the pro se clerk's office until March 10, 1992, one day beyond the\nstatutory bar. Thus, because the plaintiffs failed to present their complaints to the pro se clerk before the\nexpiration of the limitations period, application of the commencement rule articulated in Toliver, supra, is\nunavailing.\nThe plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate circumstances warranting greater judicial leniency than that already\nafforded them under the law. Accordingly, the Court finds that the plaintiffs Joseph and Claire's Section 1983\nclaims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n58 *58 The Court must address one final issue regarding dismissal of the Section 1983 claims asserted by Joseph,\nClaire, and Anthony Varrone against one of the defendants, Cynthia Johnson. Because the plaintiffs never\neffected service of the summons and complaint upon the defendant Johnson within 120 days of the filing thereof,\npursuant to Rule 4(j) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court, upon its own initiative, dismisses without\nprejudice this consolidated action as against defendant Johnson.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings dismissing the claims\nasserted by plaintiffs Joseph and Claire Varrone hereby is GRANTED, and all of the claims asserted by the\nplaintiffs Joseph, Claire, and Anthony Varrone against the defendant Cynthia Johnson hereby are DISMISSED\nwithout prejudice pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 4(j).\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] The defendant Cynthia Johnson does not join in the present motion.\n[2] Because the parties are in agreement that Joseph's confinement ended and defendant Johnson conducted\nthe strip search of plaintiff Claire on March 9, 1989, and because both parties apparently calculate the three-year\nlimitations period from this date, for purposes of this motion the Court will treat March 9, 1989 as the accrual date\nof the plaintiffs' Section 1983 claims.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

New York.\nOctober 6, 1994.\n1146 *1146 Bernard W. McCarthy, Nancy L. Woodhouse, Chadbourne & Parke, New York City, for plaintiffs.\nRobert Abrams, Atty. Gen. by Frederic L. Lieberman, New York City, for defendants.\nMEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER\nBARTELS, District Judge.\nDefendant John Matthews moves this Court under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for summary\n1147 judgment. Plaintiff Anthony Varrone moves under Rule 15 for an order granting him leave to amend *1147 the\ncomplaint to name six additional known defendants and ten unidentified \"John Doe\" defendants. For the reasons\nset forth below, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied and the plaintiff's motion to amend is\ngranted.\nBACKGROUND\n[1]\nAt the time of the events precipitating this action,  Joseph Varrone was incarcerated at the Arthur Kill\nCorrectional Facility in New York (the \"Facility\"). On March 8, 1989, Joseph's son, plaintiff Anthony Varrone, and\nhis companion, Susan Wight, spent what prison officials term a \"contact visit\" with Joseph at the Facility during\nregular visitation hours. This visit prompted prison security to subject Joseph to a strip search, a procedure they\ncontend is performed routinely on inmates after contact visits. Although the strip search proved negative for\ncontraband, security personnel placed Joseph in the Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\"), an area of solitary\nconfinement within the Facility, where he was held for a period of twenty-seven hours. While Joseph was\nconfined in SHU, authorities failed to uncover the presence of any contraband during an inspection of his bowel\nmovement.\nPlaintiff alleges that defendant violated 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 on March 10, 1989, when he again visited his father at\nthe Facility. Upon his arrival, defendant Matthews, a Facility correction sergeant assigned to the visiting room at\nthe relevant time, informed plaintiff that he must submit to a strip search before he would be granted visitation\n[2]\nprivileges.  A sign posted outside the Facility expressly warns that \"[a]ll visitors are subject to searches as a\ncondition of visitation.\" (See Affidavit of Brian Malone, sworn to November 24, 1993 [the \"Malone Aff.\"], Exhibit C.)\nMore importantly, plaintiff admits having signed a \"Consent to Search\" form (id., Ex. E) before defendant\nMatthews escorted him to a private room, where a full-body search proved negative for contraband.\nThe account offered by defendant Matthews tells virtually the same story with a few important elaborations.\nMatthews claims that on March 3, 1989, Kings County Assistant District Attorney Eric Seidel telephoned Brian\nMalone, the Inspector General for the New York State Department of Correctional Services (\"DOCS\"), to notify\nhim that ADA Seidel had received information regarding possible drug trafficking by Joseph, Claire, and Anthony\nVarrone. Specifically, ADA Seidel stated that he had been told by a \"reliable source\" that Anthony and Claire\nVarrone planned to visit Joseph within the near future, and that they would attempt to transport heroin into the\nFacility at that time.\n\nAfter reviewing records pertaining to Joseph Varrone's conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance, and\narmed with the knowledge that DOCS currently was investigating allegations of instances of drug smuggling at\nthe Facility (none of which implicated Joseph Varrone, however), Malone directed Deputy Inspector General\nThomas Mansfield to ensure that prison personnel subjected both Claire and Anthony Varrone to a strip search\nbefore their next visit. Deputy Inspector Mansfield then assigned the matter to Investigator Juan Ramos with\ninstructions to contact senior security staff at the Facility. On March 6, 1989, Investigator Ramos provided Gerald\nWells, Deputy Superintendent for Security at the Facility, with Malone's orders to search any visitor before\n1148 allowing them to see Joseph Varrone. (See Malone Aff., Ex. B.) Apparently, this order *1148 eventually was\ncarried out by defendant Matthews.\nDISCUSSION\nA. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\nUnder Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate where the record\ndemonstrates clearly that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). See also Trans-Orient Marine Corp. v. Star Trading & Marine,\nInc., 925 F.2d 566, 571-73 (2d Cir.1991). The party seeking summary disposition bears the burden of\ndemonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106\nS.Ct. 2548, 2558, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The court's function on such a motion is to \"assess whether there are\nany factual issues to be tried, while resolving ambiguities and drawing reasonable inferences against the moving\nparty.\" Coach Leatherware Co., Inc. v. AnnTaylor, Inc., 933 F.2d 162, 167 (2d Cir.1991).\nDefendant's motion launches a multi-tiered attack, arguing that Anthony Varrone has failed to state a violation of\nhis constitutional rights because he retained no legitimate expectation of privacy once he entered the Facility.\nAlternatively, Matthews asserts that even if plaintiff did enjoy a legitimate privacy expectation, he expressly\nconsented to the strip search and thereby waived any Fourth Amendment protections he may have had. In any\nevent, Matthews claims the search was based on reasonable suspicion, and thus passes constitutional muster. A\nsecond line of defense asserts that Matthews himself cannot be held liable should the Court find that the strip\nsearch was constitutionally unreasonable. First, Matthews relies on the principle that in order to establish liability\nin a Section 1983 action, plaintiff must demonstrate personal involvement on the part of a defendant. Matthews\nargues further that even if he were involved personally in the search, the doctrine of qualified immunity shields\nhim from liability. Each of defendant's contentions here will be dealt with separately.\n1. Plaintiff Retained a Legitimate Expectation of Privacy While Visiting\nthe Facility\nPlaintiff did not abandon his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable government intrusion when he\nentered the Facility to visit his father. While the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has recognized that\n\"[c]ontacts between inmates and noninmates may justify otherwise impermissible intrusions into the noninmates'\nprivacy,\" United States v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 21 (2d Cir.1988),cert. denied,488 U.S. 1033, 109 S.Ct. 846,\n102 L.Ed.2d 978 (1989), neither that court, nor any other circuit court, has held that the need to maintain prison\nsecurity justifies wholesale abrogation of rights protected by the United States Constitution. Indeed, the circuit\ncourts generally agree that a prison visitor retains a Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. See, e.g., Boren v. Deland, 958 F.2d 987 (10th Cir.1992); Cochrane v. Quattrocchi, 949\nF.2d 11 (1st Cir.1991),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 2965, 119 L.Ed.2d 586 (1992); Daugherty v.\nCampbell, 935 F.2d 780 (6th Cir.1991),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 939, 117 L.Ed.2d 110 (1992); \nSmothers v. Gibson, 778 F.2d 470 (8th Cir.1985); Thorne v. Jones, 765 F.2d 1270 (5th Cir.1985),cert. denied,\n475 U.S. 1016, 106 S.Ct. 1198, 89 L.Ed.2d 313 (1986).\nAlthough plaintiff retained a legitimate expectation of privacy while in the Facility, the Court agrees with defendant\nthat any such expectation necessarily was diminished. The Second Circuit has recognized that noninmates\n\npossess legitimate expectations of privacy; the court has noted, however, that \"in light of the difficult burdens of\nmaintaining safety, order and security,\" these privacy expectations diminish when one enters a correctional\nfacility. Security and Law Enforcement Employees v. Carey, 737 F.2d 187, 204 (2d Cir.1984). As stated by the\nCourt of Appeals for the First Circuit, \"[t]o be sure, those visiting a prison cannot credibly claim to carry with them\n1149 the full panoply *1149 of rights they normally enjoy. But neither may they constitutionally be made to suffer a\nwholesale loss of rights....\" Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 563 (1st Cir.1985). Accordingly, once inside the\nFacility plaintiff enjoyed a legitimate, albeit diminished, expectation that he would be free from unwarranted\ngovernment intrusion into his bodily privacy.\n2. Whether the Strip Search of Plaintiff Was Supported by Reasonable\nSuspicion Raises an Issue of Material Fact\nThe Court finds that defendant Matthews has failed to demonstrate that, as a matter of law, the gross invasion of\nplaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights was supported by reasonable suspicion. The Fourth Amendment \"vests\nindividuals with the right to be free from `unreasonable government intrusions into their legitimate expectations of\nprivacy.'\" Carey, 737 F.2d at 201 (quoting United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1, 7, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 2481, 53\nL.Ed.2d 538 [1977]). Having concluded that Anthony Varrone enjoyed a legitimate privacy expectation while a\nvisitor at the Facility, it now is incumbent upon defendant to establish that the government's intrusion on that\nprivacy right was reasonable. The United States Supreme Court has held that to determine the reasonableness\nof a strip search conducted at a correctional facility, \"the court must balance the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861,\n1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Application of this balancing test has led the courts to adopt a reasonable suspicion\nstandard to govern the conduct of strip searches of prison visitors. See, e.g., Boren, 958 F.2d at 988; Cochrane,\n949 F.2d at 13; Daugherty, 935 F.2d at 784; Thorne, 765 F.2d at 1277; Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668, 674 (8th\nCir.1982).\nIn weighing the severity of the intrusion involved here against its alleged justification, the Court is mindful that a\nstrip search involves a grave violation of bodily privacy. See, e.g., Cochrane, 949 F.2d at 13 (a strip search\n\"`constitutes an extreme intrusion upon personal privacy, as well as an offense to the dignity of the individual'\")\n(quoting Burns v. Loranger, 907 F.2d 233, 235 n. 6 [1st Cir.1990]); Hunter, 672 F.2d at 674 (\"a strip search,\nregardless how professionally and courteously conducted, is an embarrassing and humiliating experience\").\nThus, although the courts are bound to accord great weight to the interest prison officials have in intercepting\ncontraband and maintaining prison security, Bell, 441 U.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878; Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 564,\nthe inherently invasive nature of a strip search requires a greater showing of necessity to justify its conduct.\nMatthews's proof falls short of making the requisite showing of necessity. Defendant contends that the\ninformation provided by ADA Seidel's unidentified \"reliable source\" and general suspicions of drug smuggling at\nthe Facility alone warranted a search of plaintiff. However, \"`[t]o justify the strip search of a particular visitor ...\nprison officials must point to specific objective facts and rational inferences'\" that establish particularized\nreasonable suspicion directed specifically to that visitor. Thorne, 765 F.2d at 1277 (quoting Hunter, 672 F.2d at\n674). Where, as here, authorities rely on information provided by a confidential informant, the tip must possess\nsome \"indicia of reliability sufficient to give prison officials reasonable grounds to suspect drug smuggling activity\"\non the part of the individual searched. Hunter, 672 F.2d at 676. Reasonable suspicion exists only when \"the\ninformation contained in the tip is linked to other objective facts known by correctional authorities.\" Id. (citing \nAdams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 147, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1924, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 [1972]).\nDefendant has cited no objective fact or rational inference implicating Anthony Varrone as a probable drug\nsmuggler. Indeed, the general suspicions of drug trafficking at the Facility in no way implicated Joseph, Claire, or\nAnthony Varrone, and prison authorities discovered no evidence buttressing the informant's tip or specifically\nimplicating plaintiff in any drug trafficking activity. Rather, prison authorities apparently subjected plaintiff to one of\n1150 the most demeaning and humiliating forms of government intrusion *1150 on the basis of nothing more than an\nuncorroborated confidential informant's tip.\n\nAlthough defendant urges that the strip search was required to thwart a reasonably suspected attempt by plaintiff\nto smuggle drugs into the Facility, several facts belie this contention. First, on March 8, 1989, five days after\nauthorities had received the tip from ADA Seidel's informant, prison officials permitted Anthony Varrone and\n[3]\nSusan Wight to visit Joseph without first subjecting them to a search for contraband.  According to Brian\nMalone, ADA Seidel purportedly notified DOCS authorities on March 3, 1989 of his receipt of the tip that Anthony\nor Claire Varrone likely would attempt to transport drugs into the Facility within the near future. (Malone Aff., ยถ 3.)\nA memorandum sent by Investigator Ramos to Gerald Wells, the Deputy Superintendent of Security at the\nFacility, confirms that Facility security personnel clearly were apprised of ADA Seidel's tip as early as March 6,\n1989. (Malone Aff., Ex. B.) Noticeably absent, however, is any explanation for why prison personnel, admittedly\narmed with the information provided by ADA Seidel and faced with the directive to strip search Anthony, Claire,\nand \"anyone that is with them\" on \"their next attempt to visit\" Joseph (id.), neglected to conduct any search of\nplaintiff and his companion on March 8, 1989.\nDefendant does not allege that prison authorities received corroborative information between March 8 and March\n10 that could have bolstered the reliability of the tip or provided independent justification for a strip search of\nplaintiff on March 10. Rather, examination of the surrounding circumstances reveals that all evidence received by\nauthorities after learning of ADA Seidel's tip actually points away from Joseph, Claire, and Anthony Varrone as\nsuspects in any illegal drug trafficking at the Facility. For example, immediately after the March 8 contact visit with\nplaintiff, prison authorities strip-searched Joseph and then held him in isolation in a fruitless attempt to uncover\nsecreted contraband. Similarly, authorities again failed to intercept any illicit drugs during a strip search of Claire\nVarrone conducted before her visit on March 9, 1989. Viewing collectively the authorities' failure to search plaintiff\nand his companion before their March 8 visit with the absence of any evidence of drug trafficking uncovered\nduring previous searches of both Joseph and Claire, it appears that authorities were less justified in searching\n[4]\nplaintiff on March 10 than they would have been prior to the March 8 visit.\nThe issue of whether prison authorities properly were justified in subjecting plaintiff to a strip search renders\ninappropriate a grant of summary judgment on the basis of the present record. Indeed, as noted above, the\ninformation received by prison authorities subsequent to their learning of the tip not only failed to bolster, but\nactually questioned, the veracity of the information provided about the Varrones. Viewing, as it must, these facts\nin the light most favorable to plaintiff, the Court holds that the confidential informant's tip, absent some measure\nof corroboration, fails to demonstrate as a matter of law that the strip search of plaintiff was warranted. The\nevidence presently before the Court leaves open to question whether there existed at the time of the search\nindependent, articulable grounds to suspect plaintiff of an attempt to smuggle drugs into the Facility, and the\nreasonableness of defendant's conduct thus is a question of fact best left for the jury. See Keeler v. Hewitt, 697\n1151 F.2d 8, 12 (1st Cir.1982) (jury properly determines the reasonableness of a *1151 search in a Section 1983\n[5]\naction).\n3. Plaintiff Did Not Waive his Fourth Amendment Protections by\nConsenting to the Search\nBecause the Court has held that there remains a question of fact concerning the reasonableness of the strip\nsearch at issue, it becomes necessary to determine whether, as a matter of law, plaintiff's alleged consent to the\nsearch effectively waived his Fourth Amendment protections.\nMatthews argues that Anthony Varrone cannot contest the reasonableness of the strip search because plaintiff\nknowingly consented to the conduct of that search. On this point Matthews bears the \"burden of proving that\nconsent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given.\" Carey, 737 F.2d at 202 n. 23 (citing Schneckloth v.\nBustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 222, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2045, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 [1973]). Defendant points first to a sign\nposted outside the Facility 00 which warns would-be visitors that the right of visitation may be contingent upon a\n97\nsearch 00 as grounds for implying plaintiff's consent. More importantly, defendant relies heavily on the \"Consent to\n97\nSearch\" form plaintiff signed as evidence of an express waiver of plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights. It is\nundisputed that absent his consent to the search, plaintiff would have been denied visitation privileges.\n\nThe Court finds neither of defendant's arguments persuasive. In Cochrane v. Quattrocchi, supra, the Court of\nAppeals for the First Circuit held invalid consent obtained from a prison visitor where the would-be visitor was put\nto the choice of either consenting to a strip search or leaving the prison. The court rejected the argument that the\nvisitor's right to choose to decline visitation rendered her consent constitutionally meaningful. Rather, the court\nconcluded that \"a prison visitor confronted with the choice between submitting to a strip search or foregoing a\nvisit cannot provide a `legally cognizable consent,'\" because it \"`is the very choice to which she was put that is\nconstitutionally intolerable.'\" 949 F.2d at 14 (quoting Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 569, 568 [emphasis in original]). The\nCourt here agrees that plaintiff \"was confronted with a similar, and no less `constitutionally intolerable,' choice\nbetween being denied prison visitation access ... or waiving [his] constitutional right to be free from [an]\nunreasonable search.\" Id. at 14-15. Where, as here, access to a prison is \"impermissibly conditioned\" on\nsubmission to a strip search, consent is constitutionally deficient as a matter of law. Blackburn, 771 F.2d at 567.\nThe Court also finds no merit in defendant's suggestion that the posting of the warning sign outside the Facility\nrendered permissible an invasion of plaintiff's privacy rights. A similar argument was advanced in Thorne v.\nJones, supra, where the court rejected the defendant's assertion that plaintiff had consented to a strip search by\nexecuting a prison visitor form and by passing through the prison gates, at which warning notices were posted.\nThe court cautioned that \"[i]f accepted, this argument would render reasonable a strip search of any such prison\nvisitor\" irrespective of the need for the particular intrusion. 765 F.2d at 1276. Accordingly, the Court finds invalid\nany alleged express or implied consent to the search in question.\n4. Matthews was Personally Involved in Conducting the Search of\nPlaintiff\n1152 Defendant Matthews correctly notes that Section 1983 liability requires a showing *1152 of a defendant's\npersonal involvement in the alleged unconstitutional behavior. See Moffitt v. Town of Brookfield, 950 F.2d 880,\n886 (2d Cir.1991); McKinnon v. Patterson, 568 F.2d 930, 934 (2d Cir.1977),cert. denied,434 U.S. 1087, 98 S.Ct.\n1282, 55 L.Ed.2d 792 (1978). However, the Court finds wholly unconvincing defendant's attempt to distance\nhimself from the alleged infraction involved here. While admitting that he actually performed the strip search in\nquestion, defendant Matthews argues that because he was not involved in making the decision to subject plaintiff\nto a strip search, he cannot be held liable under Section 1983. Defendant has cited no legal authority in support\nof this position, and the Court finds the argument meritless.\n5. Whether the Doctrine of Qualified Immunity Shields Defendant\nMatthews From Civil Liability Raises a Question of Material Fact\nThe defense of qualified immunity shields government officials from civil liability \"`insofar as their conduct does\nnot violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\" \nPrue v. City of Syracuse, 26 F.3d 14, 17 (2d Cir.1994) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct.\n2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 [1982]). Whether the doctrine of qualified immunity properly applies is a question of\nlaw to be decided by the court. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2817, 86 L.Ed.2d 411\n(1985).\nTo establish this defense on motion for summary judgment, defendant bears the burden of showing upon\nundisputed facts either that it was not clear at the time he conducted the search that \"the interest asserted by the\nplaintiff was protected by federal law,\" Richardson v. Selsky, 5 F.3d 616, 621 (2d Cir.1993), or that it was\n\"objectively reasonable\" for defendant to believe that his conduct did not violate plaintiff's clearly established\nrights. Prue, 26 F.3d at 17. When examining whether a right was clearly established at the time a defendant\ncommitted an alleged violation, the court must consider:\n(1) whether the right in question was defined with \"reasonable specificity\"; (2) whether the\ndecisional law of the Supreme Court and the applicable circuit court support the existence of the\n\nright in question; and (3) whether under preexisting law a reasonable defendant official would\nhave understood that his or her acts were unlawful.\nSoares v. Connecticut, 8 F.3d 917, 922 (2d Cir.1993). See also Calhoun v. New York State Div. of Parole Officers,\n999 F.2d 647, 654 (2d Cir.1993). \"If the law was clearly established, the immunity defense ordinarily should fail,\nsince a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his conduct.\" Harlow, 457 U.S. at\n819, 102 S.Ct. at 2738.\nThe Court holds that in March 1989, the decisional law of the United States Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit, and the other circuit courts of appeals collectively had established that \"the search of\nprison visitors without at least reasonable suspicion violated clearly established law.\" Daugherty, 935 F.2d at 784.\nAs early as 1979, the Supreme Court had announced that strip searches conducted at correctional facilities 00 in\n97\nparticular strip searches of prison inmates, who logically enjoy fewer rights within a penal institution than do\nnoninmates 00 must be reasonable, and that this reasonableness determination requires the court to balance \"the\n97\nneed for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at\n559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884.\nThe Second Circuit, elaborating upon the rule set forth in Bell, then defined the parameters of Fourth Amendment\nprotection in the context of a penal institution in terms of the reasonable suspicion standard. In Security and Law\nEnforcement Employees v. Carey, supra, the court firmly established that the strip search of a corrections officer\nworking in a correctional facility was constitutionally deficient absent reasonable suspicion. In adopting the\nreasonable suspicion standard, the Second Circuit relied in part on Hunter v. Auger, supra, a case that earlier had\n1153 applied that standard to strip searches of prison visitors. In its discussion of Hunter,*1153 the Second Circuit\ntook great pains to detail the \"significant parallels between visitors to correctional facilities and correction officers\nwho work in them.\" 737 F.2d at 204. Then, in United States v. Willoughby, supra, the Second Circuit expressly\nrecognized development of the rule that prison visitors may be subject to strip searches upon a showing of\nreasonable suspicion. 860 F.2d at 22 (emphasis added).\nAlthough in March 1989 the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit had not explicitly adopted the reasonable\nsuspicion standard in the context of a prison visitor search, existing case law addressing the \"predicate\nrequirement of reasonable suspicion for the search of prison visitors provided `an authoritative, `clearly\nestablished' rule forewarning'\" the defendant that his actions violated plaintiff's constitutional rights. Daugherty,\n935 F.2d at 787 (quoting Ohio Civil Serv. Employees Ass'n v. Seiter, 858 F.2d 1171, 1177 [6th Cir.1988]). Indeed,\neach circuit court to have spoken on the issue by 1989 had declared that in order to be constitutionally sound, the\nstrip search of a prison visitor must meet the reasonable suspicion test. See, e.g., Smothers, 778 F.2d 470\n(Eighth Circuit); Blackburn, 771 F.2d 556 (First Circuit); Thorne, 765 F.2d 1270 (Fifth Circuit); Hunter, 672 F.2d\n668 (Eighth Circuit).\nThe rules promulgated by the Department of Correctional Services bolster the conclusion that the rights asserted\nby plaintiff were delineated clearly at the time of the March 1989 search. See Duamutef v. Leonardo, 1994 WL\n86700, at *10-11, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2904 at *35-36 (N.D.N.Y. March 7, 1994). The applicable regulation in\neffect in March 1989, DOCS Directive 4403, section IV.D.2., expressly required corrections officers first to make a\nfinding of reasonable suspicion based on \"specific objective facts and rational inferences\" before subjecting\nprison visitors to strip searches. See note 5, supra.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that by March 1989, the law clearly established \"the contours of the\nprison visitor's right to be free from a [strip] search in the absence of reasonable suspicion that he or she is\ncarrying contraband.\" Daugherty, 935 F.2d at 787. Consequently, unless defendant can demonstrate that as a\nmatter of law it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that his actions did not violate plaintiff's rights, his\nqualified immunity defense must await resolution at trial.\nIn this respect, defendant has failed to make the showing necessary to succeed on the present motion. The\ndoctrine of qualified immunity shields officials from suit if a reasonable official could have believed his conduct\n\"`to be lawful, in light of clearly established law and the information [he] possessed.'\" Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S.\n224, 227, 112 S.Ct. 534, 537, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641, 107\nS.Ct. 3034, 3040, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 [1987]). Accord Castro v. United States, 34 F.3d 106, 112 (2d Cir.1994). In\n\ndefense of his actions, Matthews urges that it was objectively reasonable for him to follow an order he had\nreceived from his superior directing him to perform a search of Anthony Varrone before granting him entry to the\nFacility. Matthews correctly notes that his position required him to obey the orders of his superiors. However,\ndefendant's position also presumably required him to follow the directives issued by the Department of\nCorrectional Services. Here, DOCS Directive 4403 tracked the language typically employed by the courts when\ndiscussing the reasonable suspicion standard, and set forth with utmost clarity the conditions that justify the strip\nsearch of a visitor at the Facility. Defendant's proof fails to \"proffer details from which ... the factual\nreasonableness of [his] actions would have been established,\" Castro, 34 F.3d at 112, and there remain factual\nquestions precluding summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.\nB. Plaintiff's Motion to Amend\nPlaintiff moves to amend the complaint to name ten unidentified \"John Doe\" defendants and six additional known\ndefendants, including Henrique Frett, Thomas Eisenschmidt, Gerald Wells, Juan Ramos, Thomas Mansfield, and\n1154 Brian Malone.[6] Absent *1154 written consent from the adverse party, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)\nrequires leave of court to amend a pleading once service of a responsive pleading has been effected. While the\ncourt enjoys \"considerable discretion in deciding whether to grant leave to amend, as a rule leave to amend `shall\nbe freely given when justice so requires.'\" New York v. Storonske Cooperage Co., Inc., 144 F.R.D. 179, 182\n(N.D.N.Y. 1992) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 15[a]). This liberal policy advises that requests to amend be granted\nabsent a showing of undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory tactics. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9\nL.Ed.2d 222 (1962).\nPlaintiff seeks to assert claims that indisputably are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Rule 15(c)\nprovides that an otherwise stale claim relates back to the original pleading if: (1) the proposed claim arises out of\nthe conduct or transaction set forth in the original pleading; (2) each new defendant received notice of the action\nsuch that he will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense; and (3) each new defendant \"knew or should have\nknown that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought\"\n[7]\nagainst him.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(2), (3). Because the claims plaintiff now seeks to add clearly arise out of the\nsame events set forth in the original pleading, the real issue before the Court is proper notice.\nPlaintiff urges that the newly-added defendants received notice of the pendency of the action through common\nrepresentation by the Attorney General of the State of New York (the \"Attorney General\"). Plaintiff correctly notes\nthat the courts of this Circuit have held that \"when both the old and new defendants are state officials and are\nrepresented by the same lawyers ... a court is entitled to find that the new defendants received constructive\nnotice which satisfies Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c).\" Afrika v. Selsky, 750 F.Supp. 595, 599\n(S.D.N.Y.1990). Defendant Matthews and the defendants previously dismissed from the action are and were\nrepresented by the Attorney General. The Attorney General likewise would represent both the known and the\n\"John Doe\" defendants plaintiff proposes to add. The Court's inquiry cannot end here, however, because before\nthe Attorney General's knowledge of the action can be imputed to the proposed defendants, it also is incumbent\nupon plaintiff to demonstrate that \"the attorney(s) knew that the additional defendant[s] would be added to the\nexisting suit.\" Gleason v. McBride, 869 F.2d 688, 693 (2d Cir.1989). The appropriate standard by which to assess\nwhether counsel possessed the requisite knowledge is whether he \"knew or should have known\" that the\nproposed defendants would be added. Id. \"If counsel is on notice to prepare a defense for additional defendants,\nthen such defendants will not be prejudiced by being named at a later date.\" Felix v. New York City Police Dep't,\n811 F.Supp. 124, 128 (S.D.N.Y.1992).\nThe Court agrees with plaintiff that the Attorney General should have known that additional defendants would be\nadded to the existing lawsuit. In Hood v. City of New York, 739 F.Supp. 196 (S.D.N.Y.1990), plaintiff inmate\ncommenced a pro se action alleging Section 1983 liability against the City of New York and two corrections\nofficers he claimed assaulted him in the Bellevue Hospital Prison Ward. Six months after counsel was appointed,\nplaintiff filed an amended complaint adding as defendants the Commissioner of the New York City Department of\nCorrections and the Commanding Officer of the Bellevue Hospital Prison Ward. The proposed defendants\ncontested the amendment, urging that the claims asserted therein were untimely.\n\nThe court in Hood held that common representation by Corporation Counsel imputed to defendants knowledge of\n1155 the pending suit *1155 sufficient to satisfy the notice requirements of Rule 15(c). Rejecting the contention that\nplaintiff intentionally excluded the proposed defendants from the original pro se complaint, the court stated that\n\"Corporation Counsel should have known that the omission of [the proposed defendants] was likely due to\nplaintiff's lack of knowledge of the identity of the persons he alleges were responsible, not a result of a conscious\ntactical decision.\" 739 F.Supp. at 199. The court stressed that plaintiff's addition of \"supervisory municipal\nemployees\" 00 whose identity presumably was more difficult for plaintiff to ascertain00to a suit originally naming\n97 97\nonly the city and the officers who allegedly beat plaintiff should have come as no surprise. Id.\nSimilarly, in Hodge v. Ruperto, 739 F.Supp. 873 (S.D.N.Y.1990), the court permitted plaintiff to amend his Section\n1983 action to add several new municipal defendants. Although at the time of the amendment plaintiff was\nrepresented by counsel, plaintiff had filed the original complaint pro se. Like the court in Hood, the Hodge court\nconcluded that Corporation Counsel's joint representation of several members of the New York City Police\nDepartment placed counsel and the newly-added defendants on notice that they would be added to the pending\nsuit. The court noted that plaintiff's failure to name the new defendants in the original complaint did not appear to\nbe the result of dilatory tactics, but rather likely was \"due to plaintiff's unfamiliarity with the causes of action\navailable to him and his lack of knowledge of the identity of the persons he alleges were responsible.\" 739\nF.Supp. at 881.\nPlaintiff's original pro se complaint named only defendant Bara, the Superintendent of the Facility at the relevant\ntime, and defendant Matthews, the correction sergeant who actually performed the strip search of plaintiff. Like\nthe plaintiffs in Hodge and Hood, Anthony Varrone apparently was ignorant of the identity of the other players\ninvolved in the alleged infraction, and accordingly named only those Facility employees he knew or believed to\nhave participated directly in ordering and conducting the search. Because plaintiff filed his original complaint\nwithout the benefit of legal representation, the Court finds excusable his failure to sue less easily ascertainable\nsupervisory employees. Furthermore, no prejudice will result from permitting plaintiff to amend, as the facts giving\nrise to the claims sought to be added mirror those asserted in the original complaint. Accordingly, the Court finds\nnotice through shared representation sufficient to confer knowledge for Rule 15(c) purposes, and plaintiff's\namendment properly relates back to the original complaint.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, defendant's motion for summary judgment hereby is DENIED, plaintiff's motion\nto amend the complaint hereby is GRANTED, and plaintiff hereby is directed to file with the Court an amended\ncomplaint within thirty (30) days of the date of this order.\nSO ORDERED.\n[1] By order dated October 26, 1992, this Court consolidated three separate actions brought pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1983. On September 22, 1993, the Court dismissed as untimely all of the claims asserted by plaintiffs\nJoseph and Claire Varrone. Plaintiff Anthony Varrone then voluntarily dismissed his claims against defendants\nMichael Bilotti, Francisco Berrios, and Bert Ross. Because defendant Raymond Bara died prior to\ncommencement of the present action, the only claims left remaining are those asserted by plaintiff against\ndefendant John Matthews.\n[2] Claire Varrone had attempted to visit her husband Joseph on March 9, 1989, when, upon her arrival at the\nFacility, she too was told that before she would be permitted to see Joseph she must submit to a strip search.\nAlthough the search of Claire Varrone uncovered no illegal contraband, authorities allowed only a non-contact\nvisit. Claire Varrone's Section 1983 claim was based on this strip search.\n[3] Whether Anthony Varrone actually visited Joseph on March 8 cannot logically be contested. Although\ndefendant's motion papers here make no mention of the March 8, 1989 visit, this visit and the subsequent strip\nsearch and SHU confinement of Joseph Varrone formed the basis of Joseph's Section 1983 claim and were, in\n\npart, the subject of this Court's September 22, 1993 order dismissing the claims asserted by plaintiffs Joseph and\nClaire Varrone.\n[4] The Court draws the distinction between the knowledge possessed by security personnel on March 8 and\nMarch 10 for purposes of comparison only, and makes no finding with respect to whether any search of plaintiff\nwould have been supported by reasonable suspicion if it had been conducted on March 8, 1989.\n[5] The search involved here failed even to meet the standards the Department of Correctional Services sets for\nitself. DOCS Directive 4403, section IV.D.2., as it existed in March 1989, provides that \"[i]n order to justify a strip\nsearch of a particular visitor, the Superintendent or his designee, must point to specific objective facts and\nrational inferences that he is entitled to draw.... In other words, [he] must have reasonable cause to believe that\ndrugs or other contraband is concealed upon the person of the visitor. Generalized suspicion of smuggling activity\nis insufficient.\" That section also cautions officials that \"[s]trip searches may not be ordered based on\nuncorroborated tips merely stating that visitors would attempt to introduce contraband into a facility where the\ninformant's reliability cannot be assessed and observations of visitors upon arrival at the facility do not contribute\nto reasonable suspicion of contraband. Reasonable suspicion exists only if the tip can be linked to other objective\nfacts.\" (Emphasis added.)\n[6] The newly-added \"John Doe\" defendants comprise the chain of command between Gerald Wells, Deputy\nSuperintendent for Security at the Facility, and defendant Matthews, the corrections officer who actually carried\nout the search.\n[7] Although Rule 15(c) purports to apply only to those cases wherein a party has been misnamed, the courts of\nthis Circuit have not limited its application to mistaken identity cases. See Hood v. City of New York, 739 F.Supp.\n196, 198 n. 1 (S.D.N.Y.1990) (and cases cited therein).\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
