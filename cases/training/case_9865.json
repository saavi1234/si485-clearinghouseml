Plaintiff proceeded pro se and claimed violations against nineteen defendants of his First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. Specifically, plaintiff claimed that his arrest for speeding and obstruction of governmental administration, and his subsequent strip search and detention, violated his constitutional rights.</p><p>On August 11, 1990, plaintiff was driving through the town of Winfield when he was pulled over for speeding. He asked the officer if he was under arrest, and when the officer informed him that he was technically under arrest, Plaintiff immediately invoked his Miranda right to counsel, and refused to identify himself. He was taken in front of a judge, and further refused to identify himself, and refused to post bail. He was detained in the Herkimer County Jail overnight, where he was strip-searched.</p><p>On October 1, 1993, the Court (Judge Thomas McAvoy) dismissed plaintiff's amended complaint and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the basis of judicial, qualified immunity, or failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Plaintiff appealed.</p><p>On September 9, 1994, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, (Judge Ralph K. Winter, then-Judge Stephen Breyer, and Judge Frank X. Altimari) issued an opinion written by Judge Winter.  (35 F.3d 77). The Court found that the arresting officer was entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest charge; the specific officers involved in the strip search were entitled to qualified immunity because the contours of reasonable suspicion in these circumstances is not clearly established federal law; that absolute immunity attached to judicial and prosecutorial defendants. However, the Court found that Herkimer County was not entitled to qualified immunity.</p><p>On January 11, 1995, a jury trial was held between the plaintiff and defendant Herkimer County. At the close of plaintiffs case, the Court granted the Defendant's motion to dismiss, and judgment was entered for Herkimer County.</p><p></p>",

Wachtler, pro se, appeals from Chief Judge McAvoy's order dismissing his amended complaint. The\ncomplaint asserted numerous federal claims against nineteen defendants, all arising out of an incident in which\nWachtler was pulled over for speeding, refused to produce any identification, was subsequently arrested, strip-\nsearched, and spent a night in jail. The district court dismissed or granted summary judgment for the defendants\non each of Wachtler's claims. We affirm except as to the County of Herkimer. As to the County, we reverse on\nWachtler's claim that he was illegally strip-searched.\nBACKGROUND\nAssuming Wachtler's factual allegations to be true, the following events gave rise to his claims. At around 11 p.m.\non August 26, 1990, as he drove through the Town of Winfield, New York, he was pulled over for speeding by\nGary L. Greene, a state police officer in a marked car. Wachtler asked Greene whether he was under arrest.\nWhen Greene responded that \"technically\" Wachtler was under arrest, Wachtler \"immediately protected [him]self\nby invoking his rights,\" and refused to answer any further questions without the presence of an attorney. Wachtler\n[1]\ndid not produce a driver's license when asked.  Greene then arrested Wachtler for obstructing governmental\nadministration in violation of New York Penal Law ยง 195.05.\nAfter conducting a pat-down search and handcuffing Wachtler, Greene immediately took Wachtler before Judge\nJohn F. Skinner, the nearest available judge, in the adjacent Town of Columbia, New York. After learning the\n\nnature of the charge, Judge Skinner asked Wachtler to identify himself. When Wachtler again refused to identify\nhimself, Judge Skinner set bail at $250 and warned Wachtler that he would be sent to the county jail if he did not\npost bail. Judge Skinner told Greene to have Wachtler's car towed, and Chuck's Towing removed the car.\nAlthough Wachtler had close to $1000 in cash at the time, he refused to post bail and claimed indigency. After\nWachtler completed an indigency form (and thereby identified himself), Greene copied Wachtler's name from the\nform onto the traffic ticket and handed him a copy of the ticket, which charged Wachtler with violating New York\nVehicle & Traffic Law ยง 1180(d) by driving at 47 m.p.h. in a 30 m.p.h. zone.\nUpon Wachtler's arrival at the State Police Barracks, Trooper Harry C. Schlesier fingerprinted Wachtler. Wachtler\nwas then taken to Herkimer County Jail where jailhouse officials Panko, House, Allan, and Epps took his\nphotograph. Wachtler was strip-searched in a private location by one male guard. Wachtler was then placed in\n\"solitary confinement\" where he stayed until a friend arrived to post bail some fourteen hours later.\nUpon his release, Wachtler retrieved his car from Chuck's Towing without incident. Wachtler was subsequently\nprosecuted for speeding, but the matter was dismissed on May 29, 1991 by Judge James W. Smith, Town Justice\nfor the Town of Winfield, because of a violation of the Speedy Trial Act.\nWachtler filed a complaint alleging deprivation of his First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendment rights,\nand naming as a defendant every person with any connection to these events. Wachtler seeks declaratory relief,\nas well as compensatory and punitive damages. Chief Judge McAvoy, in an opinion delivered from the bench,\ndismissed all of Wachtler's claims. Wachtler now appeals that ruling.\nDISCUSSION\nWachtler, referencing papers submitted to the district court, apparently challenges every aspect of the district\n80 court's order. However, as explained by Chief Judge McAvoy in his oral ruling, most of Wachtler's *80 allegations\neither do not state a claim for relief or were properly dismissed on the defendants' motions for summary judgment\nbased on qualified and absolute immunity. We affirm the district court's order for substantially the reasons stated\nby Chief Judge McAvoy as to all but three issues that merit further discussion.\n1. False Arrest\nWachtler claims that the district court's grant of summary judgment to Officer Greene on the ground of qualified\nimmunity was improper. An arresting officer is entitled to qualified immunity from a claim for unlawful arrest if\n\"either (a) it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that probable cause existed, or (b) officers of\nreasonable competence could disagree on whether the probable cause test was met.\" Golino v. City of New\nHaven, 950 F.2d 864, 870 (2d Cir.1991) (citing Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1096, 89\nL.Ed.2d 271 (1986)), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 3032, 120 L.Ed.2d 902 (1992). Greene is entitled to\nqualified immunity as a matter of law so long as he shows that \"`no reasonable jury, looking at the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to, and drawing all inferences most favorable to, the plaintiffs, could conclude that it was\nobjectively unreasonable for the defendant[]' to believe that he was acting in a fashion that did not clearly violate\nan established federally protected right.\" Robison v. Via, 821 F.2d 913, 921 (2d Cir.1987) (quoting Halperin v.\nKissinger, 807 F.2d 180, 189 (D.C.Cir.1986)).\nGreene's belief that he had probable cause to arrest Wachtler was entirely reasonable. After having been lawfully\npulled over, Wachtler failed to identify himself or to provide any pedigree information necessary for Greene to\ncomplete the speeding ticket. Faced with Wachtler's baseless invocation of his \"rights,\" United States v. Adegbite,\n846 F.2d 834, 838-39 (2d Cir.1988) (Fifth Amendment rights not implicated by questions concerning pedigree\ninformation); United States ex rel. Hines v. LaVallee, 521 F.2d 1109, 1112-13 (2d Cir.1975) (same), cert. denied,\n423 U.S. 1090, 96 S.Ct. 884, 47 L.Ed.2d 101 (1976), Greene had no choice but to arrest Wachtler or\nirresponsibly let him depart without even a citation for the traffic violation. See People v. Ellis, 62 N.Y.2d 393, 396,\n477 N.Y.S.2d 106, 107-08, 465 N.E.2d 826, 827-28 (1984) (\"[o]nce it became evident that defendant could not be\n\nissued a [traffic] summons on the spot because of his inability to produce any identification, the officers were\nwarranted in arresting him to remove him to the police station\").\nGreene's belief that he had probable cause to arrest Wachtler was well-grounded, although he relied upon the\nwrong statutory provision. Greene arrested Wachtler for obstructing governmental administration in violation of\nSection 195.05 of the New York Penal Law. Wachtler may be correct that under New York law he could not be\nsuccessfully prosecuted for a violation of Section 195.05 absent a showing that he obstructed governmental\nadministration through \"physical interference.\" See People v. Case, 42 N.Y.2d 98, 101, 396 N.Y.S.2d 841, 843,\n365 N.E.2d 872, 874 (1977). This, however, is a different question from whether it was objectively reasonable for\nGreene to believe that he had probable cause to arrest Wachtler.\nWachtler was legally obligated to show his driver's license to Officer Greene or else be treated as operating a\nvehicle without a license. N.Y. Vehicle and Traffic Law ยง 507[2] (McKinney 1986). As the New York courts have\nrepeatedly held,\n[A driver's] failure, upon demand by the officer, to produce a driver's license, [is] presumptive\nevidence that he was not duly licensed (see, Vehicle and Traffic Law ยง 507[2]; People v. Griffin,\n116 Misc.2d 751, 758, 456 N.Y.S.2d 334). Driving without a license is a traffic infraction which\njustifies a police officer's immediate arrest of the unlicensed operator.\nPeople v. Abrams, 119 A.D.2d 682, 683, 501 N.Y.S.2d 110, 111-12 (2d Dep't 1986); see also People v. Copeland,\n39 N.Y.2d 986, 986-87, 387 N.Y.S.2d 234, 355 N.E.2d 288 (1976). See also N.Y. Vehicle and Traffic Law ยง 401[4]\n(McKinney 1986) (when asked for registration, \"operator shall furnish to ... police officer any information\n81 necessary for the identification of such vehicle and its owner\"). Therefore, even if Wachtler could not *81 be\narrested for obstructing governmental administration, it was objectively reasonable for Greene to arrest Wachtler,\nand Greene is entitled to qualified immunity. Kaminsky v. Rosenblum, 929 F.2d 922, 925 (2d Cir.1991).\n2. Strip-Search\nAs government officials performing discretionary functions, the individual defendants Panko, House, Allan and\nEpps, are entitled to plead qualified immunity as an affirmative defense. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815,\n102 S.Ct. 2727, 2736, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). They are shielded from liability \"insofar as their conduct does not\nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Id.\nat 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738. Moreover, \"[e]ven where the permissible scope of activity is clearly defined, the\nqualified immunity defense protects an official if it was `objectively reasonable' for him to believe his acts were\nlawful.\" Magnotti v. Kuntz, 918 F.2d 364, 367 (2d Cir.1990) (citing Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641, 107\nS.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)).\nWachtler's amended complaint alleges that he was unlawfully strip-searched \"without a Court Order\" as a \"matter\nof custom and policy\" before being placed in the Herkimer County Jail. Chief Judge McAvoy granted the\nindividual defendants' motion for summary judgment on this claim on the ground of qualified immunity.\nIn Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. 1986),cert. denied,483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762\n(1987), we held that\n[T]he Fourth Amendment precludes prison officials from performing strip/body cavity searches of\narrestees charged with misdemeanors or other minor offenses unless the officials have a\nreasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing weapons or other contraband based on the\ncrime charged, the particular characteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the\narrest.\nId. at 802. See also Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 395 (10th Cir.1993); Walsh v. Franco, 849 F.2d 66, 68-69\n(2d Cir.1988). As noted, it is undisputed that Wachtler was arrested only for a misdemeanor. See N.Y. Penal Law\nยง 195.05; N.Y. Vehicle & Traffic Law ยง 1800(a).\n\nWe have held that the Fourth Amendment proscription of strip-searches of misdemeanor arrestees without\nreasonable suspicion is clearly enough established to preclude the defense of qualified immunity. See Weber,\n804 F.2d at 803-804; Walsh, 849 F.2d at 69. However, we cannot say on the somewhat unique facts before us\nthat it is clearly established that no \"reasonable suspicion\" justified a strip-search in this case.\nWeber holds that a strip-search of a misdemeanor arrestee is unlawful where there is no \"reasonable suspicion\nthat the arrestee is concealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime charged, the particular\ncharacteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\" Weber804 F.2d at 802. In the present\ncase, we may assume that the crime charged could not give rise to such a suspicion. With regard to the\ncharacteristics of the arrestee, the police had, as a result of Wachtler's own conduct, precious little information\nabout him at the time of the strip-search. Indeed, they did not even have the pedigree information to which they\nwere entitled. Wachtler was thus different from the typical misdemeanor-arrestee about whom much is known or\nis learned from pedigree information. The circumstances of the arrest might arguably have given a reasonable\nofficer cause to suspect that Wachtler was engaged in illegal conduct of a more serious nature than driving\nwithout a license. Wachtler's failure to identify himself at the scene of the arrest or in court might have been\nviewed as evidence of a consciousness of guilt of some unidentified criminal activity. His possession of $1,000 in\ncash might have seemed a ground for suspecting drug trafficking and the possible presence of contraband. See \nUnited States v. 785 St. Nicholas Ave., 983 F.2d 396, 403 (2d Cir.) (large quantity of cash is a factor in linking\nmoney to drug transactions), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 113 S.Ct. 2349, 124 L.Ed.2d 258 (1993).\nWe have found no caselaw that addresses the reasonable suspicion issue in circumstances even remotely\n82 similar to those in the instant case. Given those circumstances *82 and the lack of legal authority, we cannot say\nthat the individual officers violated a clearly established right in strip-searching Wachtler. Thus, the individual\n[2]\ndefendants involved in the strip-search are entitled to qualified immunity.\nHerkimer County, however, does not have qualified immunity, Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 638,\n100 S.Ct. 1398, 1409, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980), and the absence of pertinent caselaw does not allow us to dismiss\nthe County as a defendant. Wachtler has alleged that he was strip-searched as a matter of County policy. See \nMonell v. Department of Social Serv., 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). The district\ncourt held that Wachtler failed to state a claim against the County because he did not \"specify the policy or\ncustom being followed.\" However, the district court also stated that the individual defendants \"simply followed\nstandard procedures for admitting a person to the jail under the order of a judge.\" If the standard procedure\nincluded routine strip-searches of misdemeanor arrestees, absent reasonable suspicion of weapons or\ncontraband, and if no reasonable suspicion concerning Wachtler's possession of such items existed, then\nWachtler would prevail. See Weber, 804 F.2d at 802-03. Thus, we cannot say that there is no set of facts\nprovable under Wachtler's complaint that would support his Section 1983 claim regarding the strip-search. \nConley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). We therefore reverse the dismissal\nof the County of Herkimer as a defendant.\n3. Claim Against Judge Smith\nWachtler claims also that Chief Judge McAvoy improperly dismissed the claim against Judge Smith because\nJudge Smith was apparently served with process, but never filed an appearance or moved for dismissal of the\ncase. We disagree. \"The district court has the power to dismiss a complaint sua sponte for failure to state a\nclaim,\" Leonhard v. United States, 633 F.2d 599, 609 n. 11 (2d Cir.1980),cert. denied,451 U.S. 908, 101 S.Ct.\n1975, 68 L.Ed.2d 295 (1981), so long as the plaintiff is given notice and \"an opportunity to be heard.\" Thomas v.\nScully, 943 F.2d 259, 260 (2d Cir.1991) (per curiam); see also Perez v. Ortiz, 849 F.2d 793, 797 (2d Cir.1988);\nWright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 1357, at 301 & n. 3. Wachtler was given notice that the\n\"defendants\" were moving to dismiss or for summary judgment, was allowed to respond by submitting a 150-\npage legal memorandum in response to the motions, and was given an opportunity for oral argument. Judge\nSmith's only involvement was to dismiss the speeding case against Wachtler, and there is thus no allegation that\nJudge Smith caused any injury to him. Moreover, it is absolutely clear that Judge Smith would have been\nshielded by judicial immunity if Wachtler were injured by his actions in Wachtler's case. Stump v. Sparkman, 435\n\nU.S. 349, 355-56, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1104, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978); Green v. Maraio, 722 F.2d 1013, 1016 (2d\nCir.1983). There was therefore no procedural or substantive error in granting the motion to dismiss.\nCONCLUSION\nWe therefore affirm as to all defendants except the County of Herkimer. We reverse as to the County.\n[*] The Honorable Stephen G. Breyer, who was Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the First\nCircuit, sitting by designation at the time of argument, has since been appointed Associate Justice, Supreme\nCourt of the United States. \nJustice Breyer has been relieved from the panel. Pursuant to this court's Rule ยง 0.14 the appeal has accordingly\nbeen heard and decided by the remaining two judges of the panel, who constitute a quorum.\n[1] Wachtler has subsequently admitted that he did not possess a valid driver's license at the time of his arrest.\nHowever, he maintains that he has a right to operate his vehicle in a \"not-for-profit\" capacity without a driver's\nlicense.\n[2] We do not reach the issue of whether the strip-search of Wachtler was in fact unconstitutional. We believe that\nthis cannot be determined without a record detailing all the circumstances surrounding the strip-search.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
