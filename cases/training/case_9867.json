    "summary": "<p>This case was filed against the County of San Diego and its Sheriff by a woman who was strip searched at a county detention facility after her 1981 arrest on a misdemeanor offense. Plaintiff filed the case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, claiming the search, (including a visual body cavity search) conducted prior to a determination whether she could be released on her own recognizance violated her fourth amendment rights. </p><p>In February 1983, the District Court (Judge Gordon Thompson, Jr.) granted plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the sheriff from conducting strip searches. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Judge Tang) vacated the injunction in March 1984 for lack of standing, and remanded the case for further proceedings. Ward v. San Diego County, 732 F.2d 165 (9th Cir. 1984).</p><p>On remand, the District Court (Judge Thompson) granted the sheriff's motion for summary judgment, finding that at the time of the search the law was not clearly established and so the sheriff enjoyed qualified immunity.</p><p>Plaintiff requested reconsideration, the District Court denied the request and the plaintiff appealed. Defendants claimed the Ninth Circuit lacked jurisdiction, because plaintiff's appeal was not from a final judgment, but rather a denial of a request for reconsideration. The appellate court disagreed, and treated the appeal as a timely appeal of the District Court's entry of judgment. The Court held that the law was clear enough that the sheriff could not claim qualified immunity, and that if the policy was found to be unreasonable, liability attached.</p><p>On June 16, 1986, the Circuit Court amended its earlier decision to address the jurisdictional issue and remanded for a determination whether the sheriff's blanket strip-search policy was reasonable. Ward v. San Diego County, 791 F.2d (9th Cir. 1986).</p><p>We have no further information about this case.</p><p></p>",

WARD, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants,\nv.\nCOUNTY OF SAN DIEGO, et al., Defendants-Appellees.\nNo. 84-6362.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.\n[*]\nSubmitted November 4, 1985 .\nDecided March 3, 1986.\nAmended June 16, 1986.\n1330 *1330 George Weingarten, San Diego, Cal., Fred Okran, Los Angeles, Cal., for plaintiffs-appellants.\nPhillip L. Kossy, San Diego, Cal., for defendants-appellees.\n1331 *1331 Before GOODWIN, TANG, Circuit Judges, and JAMESON[**], District Judge.\nTANG, Circuit Judge:\nAppellant Judith Ward initiated this action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to recover damages sustained from being strip\nsearched at a San Diego County detention facility. She appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment to\nappellee John Duffy and the denial of her petition for attorney fees. We reverse in part, affirm in part, and\nremand.\nFACTS\nOn May 30, 1981 Ward was arrested for the misdemeanor offense of refusing to sign a promise to appear. She\nwas taken to Los Colinas Womens Detention Facility for booking. In accordance with facility policy, and before a\ndetermination was made as to whether she was eligible for an own recognizance (O.R.) release, Ward was\nrequired to submit to a strip search that included a visual body cavity inspection.\nWard alleged that the strip search performed under Sheriff John Duffy's authority violated her fourth amendment\nrights. She filed for preliminary injunction under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. In February 1983 the district court enjoined\nDuffy's policy of conducting strip searches. We vacated the injunction in March 1984 on the ground that Ward\nlacked standing to seek injunctive relief. City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d\n675 (1983). The case was remanded for further proceedings.\nUpon remand, the district court granted Duffy's motion for summary judgment holding that because the law was\nnot clearly established at the time of the strip search, Duffy enjoyed qualified, good faith immunity from personal\nliability under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. The district court also denied Ward's motion for attorney fees. It held that its\ninitial preliminary injunction, vacated by this court, had no precedential force or effect and that Ward could not be\nconsidered a prevailing party entitling her to attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988.\nDISCUSSION\nJURISDICTION\nDuffy contends initially that this court lacks jurisdiction because rather than appealing from the order entering\njudgment, Ward appealed from the denial of her motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment award. We\ndisagree.\n\nA federal rule of civil procedure 59(e) motion for reconsideration tolls the filing period for an appeal from an order\nentering judgment. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4)(iii). Properly labeled, Ward's attempted notice of appeal from entry of\njudgment would have been timely filed.\nWard, however, mistakenly appealed from the district court's denial of Ward's motion for reconsideration. Unless\nthe opposing party can show prejudice, courts of appeal may treat an appeal from a postjudgment order as an\nappeal from the final judgment. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 181, 83 S.Ct. 227, 229, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); Poe\nv. Gladden, 287 F.2d 249, 251 (9th Cir.1961); Daily Mirror v. New York News, Inc., 533 F.2d 53, 56 (2d Cir.1976).\n\"The Federal Rules reject the approach that pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be\ndecisive to the outcome and accept the principle that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on\nthe merits.\" Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. at 181-82, 83 S.Ct. at 230.\nBecause Duffy was neither misled nor prejudiced by Ward's mislabeled appeal, we treat Ward's appeal from the\ndenial of her motion for reconsideration as a timely appeal from the district court's entry of judgment.\n1332  QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\n*1332\nGovernment officials performing discretionary functions are shielded from liability for civil damages if their\nconduct does not violate \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would\nhave known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The Harlow\ntest examines the \"objective reasonableness\" of the official's conduct.\nIn Capeoman v. Reed, 754 F.2d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir.1985), this court interpreted the meaning of Harlow's \"clearly\nestablished\" rights standard. We concluded that in the absence of binding precedent, a court should look at all\navailable decisional law including decisions of state courts, other circuits, and district courts to determine whether\nthe right was clearly established. Id. An additional factor is the likelihood that the Supreme Court or the Ninth\nCircuit would have reached the same result as courts that had already considered the issue. Id. at 1515.\nThe question of reasonable searches turns on a balancing of the interests and facts in particular circumstances. \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Although a less stringent standard than\nprobable cause may perhaps justify strip searches of minor offense arrestees, see id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885,\nthe facts upon which a strip search is based must be capable of of measurement against some objective\nstandard. Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979).\nWe first note that Capeoman places the responsibility for keeping abreast of constitutional developments in\ncriminal law squarely on the shoulders of law enforcement officials. Given the power of such officials over our\nliberty, and sometimes even over our lives, this placement of responsibility is entirely proper. Law enforcement\nofficials must be cognizant not only of how far their authority extends, but also of the point at which their authority\nends. At the same time, however, we do not read Capeoman to require of most government officials the kind of\nlegal scholarship normally associated with law professors and academicians. A reasonable person standard\nadheres at all times.\nWith the foregoing in mind, we survey the legal landscape in May of 1981 and we conclude that the law was\nsufficiently clear in early 1981 so as to expose a public official who unreasonably authorized blanket strip\nsearches of minor offense arrestees to civil liability under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\nAs to the strip search policy itself, no published state or federal case since Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757,\n86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966) (test of reasonableness under fourth amendment requires a balancing of\nthe need for particular search against the invasion of personal rights the search entails) upholds the\nconstitutionality of a blanket policy of strip searches of minor offense arrestees. In balancing arrestees' fourth\namendment rights against the security problems in detention facilities, courts upheld the practice of strip\nsearches on two sometimes overlapping grounds. First, a strip search could be justified if the arrest was\ncustodial. See e.g., United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973) (full\nsearch incident to custodial arrest for probable cause is reasonable); Logan v. Shealy, 500 F.Supp. 502\n(E.D.Vir.1980) (strip search of DWI arrestee held for four hours or until some responsible person could pick\n\narrestee up is reasonable), reversed,660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. October 1981),cert. denied,455 U.S. 942, 102\nS.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982); People v. Seymour, 84 Ill.2d 14, 48 Ill.Dec. 556, 416 N.E.2d 1078 (1981)\n(strip search incident to custodial arrest where officers reasonably suspected arrestee possessed both a weapon\nand contraband is reasonable).\nSecond, a strip search could be justified if the arresting officer had at least a reasonable suspicion that the\n1333 arrestee possessed a weapon or contraband. United*1333States v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296 (1st Cir.1975) (probable\ncause that arrestee possessed contraband justified strip search). Armstrong v. Borie, 494 F.Supp. 902\n(E.D.Penn.1980) (reasonable suspicion that arrestee possessed dangerous object (keys) justified strip search). \nSee also Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (strip search of pre-trial detainees\nafter contact visit is reasonable).\nIn Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 490 (E.D.Wis.1979),aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980), a case similar to our\nown, both the district court and the Seventh Circuit found unconstitutional a strip search of a person arrested for a\nnon-misdemeanor traffic violation who was unable to post a $40 cash bond. There, as here, no reasonable\nsuspicion existed that a weapon or contraband would be discovered on the arrestee. We find the fact that the\narrestee in Tinetti was charged with a non-misdemeanor traffic violation whereas Ward was charged with a\nmisdemeanor of refusing to sign a promise to appear to be a distinction of little consequence.\nWe note too that the district court below in the first instance found the law sufficiently clear and granted Ward's\nmotion for a preliminary injunction against Duffy's policy of strip searches. We vacated the injunction because of\nthe Lyons teaching on standing and not on a determination as to the reasonableness of the policy.\nPre-1981 strip search cases, including Tinetti, harbinged our decision in Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 619\n(9th Cir.1984). In Giles we established that strip searches of arrestees for a minor offense are unconstitutional\nabsent individualized suspicion that such arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or is suffering from a\ncommunicable disease.\nIn many ways the facts before us suggest the easiest possible case. First, Duffy's policy subjected Ward and\nother minor offense arrestees to a strip search even before an own recognizance (O.R.) release determination\nwas made. Second, it was unlikely that arresting officers reasonably suspected that Ward possessed a weapon\nor contraband. In most instances the unreasonableness of a strip search conducted prior to an O.R. release\ndetermination is plain.\nDuffy argues that he is shielded from civil liability because nine months prior to the search of Ward he was told by\nthe Superior Court of California in Hudler v. Duffy, No. 404148 (Aug. 14, 1980), that the strip search policy was\nconstitutional. The record indicates, however, that Hudler was a class action suit brought by custodial detainees.\nThere is no suggestion that the Hudler decision involved arrestees awaiting own recognizance (O.R.) release\ndetermination.\nSecond, assuming arguendo that Hudler did speak to O.R. eligible detainees, the pronouncement of one state\ncourt on a constitutional issue does not necessarily shield a government official from liability. See Capoeman v.\nReed, 754 F.2d at 1514 (in the absence of binding precedent, a court should look at all available decisional law\nincluding state courts, other circuits, and district courts to determine whether a right was clearly established). In\nlight of contrary authority from federal courts, the decision by the California Superior Court did not ipso facto\nvindicate Duffy's policy.\nIf no reasonable ground existed for Duffy's blanket strip search policy as applied to Ward, we hold that the law in\nMay of 1981 was sufficiently clear to subject Duffy to liability for civil damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. We\nremand to the district court to determine the reasonableness of the strip search policy. A finding of liability would\nnecessitate a determination of damages.\n\nATTORNEY FEES\nWard argues entitlement to attorney fees in that the dissolved injunction put Duffy on notice that the strip\nsearches in question could again be held unconstitutional. Even if true, the district court's determination that\nWard did not achieve prevailing party status was not clearly erroneous.\n1334 *1334 A \"prevailing party\" for ยง 1988 purposes does not necessarily have to obtain formal relief. Maher v. Gagne,\n448 U.S. 122, 129, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2575, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980). A party can achieve \"prevailing party\" status by\nestablishing a \"clear, causal relationship between the litigation brought and the practical outcome realized.\" \nRutherford v. Pitchess, 713 F.2d 1416, 1419 (9th Cir.1983).\nWard's lack of standing in her original challenge rendered illusory the practical outcome she temporarily received\n(the preliminary injunction). A party may be awarded attorney fees as a prevailing party at an interlocutory stage\nof the proceeding if the party prevails on the merits as to one or more of his or her claims. Hanrahan v. Hampton,\n446 U.S. 754, 757-58, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 1989, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980). An erroneously granted injunction cannot be\nthe basis for an award of attorney fees as the prevailing party.\nREVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n[*] The panel unanimously agrees that this case is appropriate for submission without oral argument.\nFed.R.App.P. 34(a); 9th Cir. 3(f).\n[**] Honorable William J.

A reasonable person standard\nadheres at all times.\nWith the foregoing in mind, we survey the legal landscape in May of 1981 and we conclude that the law was\nsufficiently clear in early 1981 so as to expose a public official who unreasonably authorized blanket strip\nsearches of minor offense arrestees to civil liability under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\nAs to the strip search policy itself, no published state or federal case since Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757,\n86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966) (test of reasonableness under fourth amendment requires a balancing of\nthe need for particular search against the invasion of personal rights the search entails) upholds the\nconstitutionality of a blanket policy of strip searches of minor offense arrestees. In balancing arrestees' fourth\namendment rights against the security problems in detention facilities, courts upheld the practice of strip\nsearches on two sometimes overlapping grounds. First, a strip search could be justified if the arrest was\ncustodial. See e.g., United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 476, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973) (full\nsearch incident to custodial arrest for probable cause is reasonable); Logan v. Shealy, 500 F.Supp. 502\n(E.D.Vir.1980) (strip search of DWI arrestee held for four hours or until some responsible person could pick\n\narrestee up is reasonable), reversed,660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. October 1981),cert. denied,455 U.S. 942, 102\nS.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982); People v. Seymour, 84 Ill.2d 24, 48 Ill.Dec. 548, 416 N.E.2d 1070 (1981)\n(strip search incident to custodial arrest where officers reasonably suspected arrestee possessed both a weapon\nand contraband is reasonable).\nSecond, a strip search could be justified if the arresting officer had at least a reasonable suspicion that the\narrestee possessed a weapon or contraband. United States v. Klein, 522 F.2d 296 (1st Cir.1975) (probable cause\nthat arrestee possessed contraband justified strip search). Armstrong v. Borie, 494 F.Supp. 902 (E.D.Penn.1980)\n(reasonable suspicion that arrestee possessed dangerous object (keys) justified strip search). See also Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) (strip search of pre-trial detainees after contact visit\nis reasonable).\nIn Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486, 490 (E.D.Wis.1979), aff'd, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980), a case similar to our\nown, both the district court and the Seventh Circuit found unconstitutional a strip search of a person arrested for a\nnon-misdemeanor traffic violation who was unable to post a $40 cash bond. There, as here, no reasonable\nsuspicion existed that a weapon or contraband would be discovered on the arrestee. We find the fact that the\n1389 arrestee in Tinetti was charged with a non-misdemeanor *1389 traffic violation whereas Ward was charged with a\nmisdemeanor of refusing to sign a promise to appear to be a distinction of little consequence.\nWe note too that the district court below in the first instance found the law sufficiently clear and granted Ward's\nmotion for a preliminary injunction against Duffy's policy of strip searches. We vacated the injunction because of\nthe Lyons teaching on standing and not on a determination as to the reasonableness of the policy.\nPre-1981 strip search cases, including Tinetti, harbinged our decision in Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 619\n(9th Cir.1984). In Giles we established that strip searches of arrestees for a minor offense are unconstitutional\nabsent individualized suspicion that such arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or is suffering from a\ncommunicable disease.\nIn many ways the facts before us suggest the easiest possible case. First, Duffy's policy subjected Ward and\nother minor offense arrestees to a strip search even before an own recognizance (O.R.) release determination\nwas made. Second, it was unlikely that arresting officers reasonably suspected that Ward possessed a weapon\nor contraband. In most instances the unreasonableness of a strip search conducted prior to an O.R. release\ndetermination is plain.\nIf no reasonable ground existed for Duffy's blanket strip search policy as applied to Ward, we hold that the law in\nMay of 1981 was sufficiently clear to subject Duffy to liability for civil damages under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. We\nremand to the district court to determine the reasonableness of the strip search policy. A finding of liability would\nnecessitate a determination of damages.\nATTORNEY FEES\nWard argues entitlement to attorney fees in that the dissolved injunction put Duffy on notice that the strip\nsearches in question could again be held unconstitutional. Even if true, the district court's determination that\nWard did not achieve prevailing party status was not clearly erroneous.\nA \"prevailing party\" for ยง 1988 purposes does not necessarily have to obtain formal relief. Maher v. Gagne, 448\nU.S. 122, 129, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2575, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980). A party can achieve \"prevailing party\" status by\nestablishing a \"clear, causal relationship between the litigation brought and the practical outcome realized.\" \nRutherford v. Pitchess, 713 F.2d 1416, 1419 (9th Cir.1983).\nWard's lack of standing in her original challenge rendered illusory the practical outcome she temporarily received\n(the preliminary injunction). A party may be awarded attorney fees as a prevailing party at an interlocutory stage\nof the proceeding if the party prevails on the merits as to one or more of his or her claims. Hanrahan v. Hampton,\n446 U.S. 754, 757-58, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 1989, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980). An erroneously granted injunction cannot be\nthe basis for an award of attorney fees as the prevailing party.\n\nREVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n[*] The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument.
