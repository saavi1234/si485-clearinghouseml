    "summary": "<p>On June 19, 2001, a female arrestee, who had been subjected to a strip search with body cavity inspection upon being booked on misdemeanor charge of being under the influence of cocaine or methamphetamine in violation of California state law filed suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, challenging the Ventura County Jail strip search policy.  Plaintiff alleged that her search involved a visual inspection of her unclothed body cavities by a female deputy.  The deputy found no contraband, weapons or drugs. Plaintiff claimed the search  deprived her of her civil rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p><p>Both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, with the defendants arguing that they were entitled to qualified immunity.  The District Court (Judge Consuelo B. Marshall) granted plaintiff's motion, finding that the strip search of plaintiff, done pursuant to the County's policy, violated the Fourth Amendment.  The Court denied defendants' qualified immunity defense.  The defendants appealed.  The appeal was initially dismissed as premature.  Way v. County of Ventura, 348 F.3d 808 (9th Cir. 2003) (Circuit Judge John Clifford Wallace).  When the issue was eventually decided on appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, in part, on the issue that the search was unconstitutional, but determined that the individual defendant deputies were entitled to qualified immunity.   (That defense was not available to Ventura County.)  Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157  (9th Cir. 2006) (Circuit Judge Pamela Ann Rymer).  Certiorari was denied by Ventura County, Cal. v. Way, 127 S.Ct. 665, 166 L.Ed.2d 513 (2006).</p><p>On remand, the case was settled after three days of mediation.  The parties filed a stipulated dismissal with prejudice on May 2, 2007, where plaintiff expressly agreed to waive all of her rights, including the right to recovery in the companion class action case, Gamino v. County of Ventura.  [See JC-CA-53 for a case summary].   The terms of the settlement were private and not made part of the court record.</p><p></p>",

Plaintiff was working at the Red Cove in Ventura.  She was a bartender at this \n3  establishment. \n4  12.  Earlier on August 7, 2000, plaintiff had asked a customer to leave the Red \n5  Cove because he had too much to drink.  The customer left the area at first but after the bar \n6  closed he returned and sat in front ofthe bar. \n7  13.  Officers from the Ventura Police Department saw the individual sitting outside \n8  the door and went to talk to him.  The Officers knocked on the door of the bar to ask plaintiff, \n9  the bartender, why the man was there.  Plaintiff spoke to the officers and at that time they \n10  determined that she was under the influence of methamphetamine. \n11  14.  Plaintiff was arrested for Health and Welfare Code Section 11550, and put in a \n12  patrol car. While she was silting in the patrol car the officers searched her purse that WaS in \n13  the bar and took her keys. \n14  15.  Plaintiff was then taken to the hospital for blood tests and then to the Ventura \n15  County jail.  She was in jail for approximately 12 hours. \n16  16.  While waiting in the holding cell, plaintiff was taken into the \"changing \n17  room/women's shower\"at the Ventura County main jail and stripped searched including a \n18  body cavity search.  This search involved plaintiff having to remove a tampon and tearing it \n19  apart for the deputies inspection. \n20  17.  Plaintiff was verbally harassed by deputies while in jail.  She was called a \n21  \"street walker\", \"ronk\" and \"whore\". \n22  18.  Plaintiffs bail was initially $5,000 and then raised to $10,000.  Her ex-husband \n23  appeared and produced bail for her and she was released. \n24  19.  On November 6, 2000, the blood tests came back negative and the district \n25  attorney declined to file charges against plaintiff. \n26  II II \n27  II II \n28  II II \n3 \n\n- -\nII  I  . \nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 13      Filed 12/12/2001     Page 4 of 10\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n2  Against Defendants Officer Robert Ortiez and The County or Ventura and Does 1-9 \n3  Civil Rights Violation 4th and 14th Amendments, \n4  Right To Be Free From Illegal Search And Seizure. \n5  20.

Plaintiff did not consent to this search \n10  of her personal property and the seizure of her keys. \nII  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n12  Against Defendants Officer Ortiez, The County of Ventura and Does \n13  Civil Rights Violation 4th and 14th Amendments, \n14  Illegal Arrest and False Imprisonment \nIS  22.  The allegations set forth in paragraphs I through 21 inclusively in this \n16  complaint are incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n17  23.  Plaintiff was cooperative with Officer Ortiez when he came to her place of \n18  business.  She fully answered all of his questions. \n19  24.  Plaintiff assured the officer that she had not been drinking and does not do \n20  drugs. \n21  25.  When asked why she was sweating plaintiff responded that she had just \n22  restocked the bar.  She also told him that her pulse was fast because she had been drinking \n23  coffee all night. \n24  26.  Officer Ortiez decided to arrest plaintifffor Health and Welfare Code Section \n25  11550, suspicion of being under the influence of a controlled substance. There was no \n26  probable cause to arrest plaintiff. \n27  27.

The allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 27 inclusively in this \n7  complaint are incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n8  29.  While waiting in the holding cell at the Ventura County Main Jail, plaintiff was \n9  stripped searched which included a body cavity search. \n10  30.  Plaintiff was a pretrial detainee who was given bail and made bail. \nII  31.  Plaintiff was indiscriminately strip searched. There was no probable cause to \n12  believe that a weapon or contraband was secreted on plaintiffs body.  Plaintiff was arrested \n13  without probable cause and definitely without probable cause that she was in possession of \n14  drugs or weapons. \n15  33.  Without specific facts as to why plaintiff was to undergo a body cavity search, \n16  Officer K. Hanson proceeded to strip search plaintiff. \n17  34.  Plaintiff had to remove her tampon while being stripped searched in order for \n18  the Deputy to perform a body cavity search.  Plaintiff was also required to tear apart her \n19  tampon to show that there was nothing hidden in it.  This intrusion was not reasonable under \n20  the circumstances in particular, the plaintiff was charged with suspicion of being under the \n21  influence of a controlled substance and was released on bail. \n22  35.  Plaintiffundcrwent an extremely intrusive unreasonable stiplbody cavity \n23  search when there was no probable cause to believe that plaintiff was carrying contraband in \n24  her genital area/within her body.

While in the Ventura County Jail plaintiff was stip searched and body cavity \n12  searched. \n13  49.  Plaintiff was a pretrial detainee and had bail posted.

The allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 49 inclusively in this \n19  complaint are incorporated herein as if fully set forth. \n20  51.  Plaintiff was arrested without probable cause by officers of the Ventura Police \n21  Department.  The arresting Ventura Police Officers also illegally searched and removed \n22  property from her purse The County of Ventura has failed to train and supervise its officers on \n23  the probable cause standards required to arrest a citizen in particular, the ability to point to s \n24  specific articulable facts. \n25  52.  Deputies at the Ventura County Jail illegally stip searched and performed a \n26  body cavity search on plaintiff. \n27  53.  Penal Code Section 4030 did not authorize a striplbody cavity search on \n28  plaintiff and therefore the search was performed illegally. \n7 \n\n..  .. \nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 13      Filed 12/12/2001     Page 8 of 10\nI  โข \n54.  Sheriff Bob Brooks is the supervisor of the Ventura County Jail and is \n2  therefore liable for failing to train and supervise his deputies on the procedures and laws of \n3  strip searching a pretrial detainee. \n4  55.  The County of Ventura developed and maintained policies or customs \n5  exhibiting deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of person in the County of \n6  Ventura, which caused the violations of plaintiff's rights. \n7  56.  It was the policy and/or custom of the County of Ventura to inadequately and \n8  improperly train and supervise their Deputies on the laws pertaining to stip searching and body \n9  cavity searches of pretrial detainees. \n10  57.  The above described policies and customs demonstrated a deliberate \n11  indifference on the part of policy makers of the County of Ventura to the constitutional rights \n12  of persons within the County, and were the cause of the violations of plaintiff's rights alleged \n13  herein. \n14  58.  With no specific articulable facts that would lead a reasonable officer to believe \n15  that plaintiff was concealing a weapon or contraband on her body, defendants condoned her to \n16  be not only strip searched but to undergo a body cavity search as well. \n17  59.  The way the above referenced Defendants were trained and supervised \n18  regarding when and to whom to do body cavity searches, was so inadequate that it showed \n19  deliberate indifference to the alleged offensive \n20  practices. \n21  60.  The supervisor of the jail, Sheriff Bob Brooks, who also supervises the \n22  Deputies involved in strip searches at the County jail,  reasonably should have known that \nsuch actions by his Deputies would cause Plaintiff constitutional injury. \n23 \n61.  Sheriff Bob Brooks failure to train his subordinate Deputies in the necessary \n24 \nconstitutional policies of strip searching forms an affirmative causal link between the \n25 \ndefendants actions in this case and the particular \n26 \nconstitutional injuries suffered by the plaintiff. \n27 \n62.  This is a blatant failure to exercise his duty to supervise/train the Deputies \n28 \nunder his control, this subjects the supervisor, Sheriff Bob Brooks, to be vicariously liable. \n8 \n\n..  .. \nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 13      Filed 12/12/2001     Page 9 of 10\nWHEREFORE, plaintiff demands the following relief, jointly and severally against \n2  all the defendants: \n3  1.

Marshall, Chief \n19  Judge, presiding, is Defendants Karen Hanson and Sheriff Robert Brooks' \n20  Motion for Summary Judgment based on qualified immunity.  The parties \n21  appeared before this Court for oral argument on January 29,2004.  Upon \nI \n22  consideration of the papers submitted and the arguments presented, the Court \n23  DENIES Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. \n24  JURISDICTION \n25  This Court has jurisdiction pursuantto 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343, and \n26  42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n27  DOC}(ETED ON eM \n28 \nFEB 202004 \n'to \nBY  \\1./  006 \n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 2 of 12\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n,  III \n2  Plaintiff Noelle Way (\"Plaintiff') was arrested on September 6, 2000':'by \n3  City of San Buenaventura Police Officer Robert Ortiz for being under the, \ni /1 \n4  influence of a controlled substance in violation of California Health and Safety \n5  Code ยง 11550(a), a misdemeanor.  Plaintiff was taken to the Ventura County \n6  MedicalCenter so that she could provide a blood sample, and then to the pretrial \n7  detention facility (\"county jail\") to be booked on the charge.  Pursuant to \n8  Ventura County Sheriffs Department's policy of performing visual body cavity \n9  searches of every pretrial detainee arrested for an alleged ยง 11550 violation, \n10  Deputy Sheriff Karen Hanson perfornled a visual unclothed body cavity search \n11  of Plaintiff.  After being in jail for approximately 12 hours, Plaintiff was released \n12  after her ex-husband produced the $10,000 bail for her.  On November 6, 2000, \n13  plaintiffs blood tests were returned and the district attorney declined to file \n14  charges. \n15  In her First Amended Complaint, filed December 12,2001, Plaintiff \n16  alleges Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations arising out of the search \n17  against the County of Ventura; the Sheriff of Ventura County, Robert Brooks; \n18  and the deputy sheriff who performed the search, Karen Hanson.  Plaintiff also \n19  sues Ortiz for false arrest under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and other state law claims. \n20  On July 22, 2002, this Court ruled on summary judgment that Ventura \n21  County's strip search policy allowing the visual unclothed body cavity search of \n22  Plaintiff without her ever being released into the general prison population and \n23  without a determination of reasonable suspicion, violated Plaintiffs \n24  constitutional rights.  The Court did not reach the issue of whether a strip search \n25  of a plaintiff who was released into the general prison population would also \n26  constitute a constitutional violation.  At the conclusion of this Court's Order \n27  denying Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment in the Way case, the Court \n28  invited the Defendants to file briefs as to whether they were entitled to qualified \n-2 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 3 of 12\nimmunity.  Prior to filing any briefs on this issue, Defendants appealed this. \n, . \n~ \n2  Court's decision regarding the constitutionality of the search to the Ninth i~ \n3  Circuit.  On November 26, 2003, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal holding \n,.I', \n4  that the District Court had only reached the first issue under Saucier v. Katz, 533 \n5  U.S. 194 (2001) - whether a constitutional right had been violated - and had not \n6  reached the second issue as to whether the right was clearly established.  The \n7  Ninth Circuit held that this Court's decision was not a final, appealable order and \n8  that the County must wait to appeal until the Court rules upon the second prong \n9  of Saucier. \n10  As a result of the Ninth Circuit's dismissal of the appeal, Defendants \n11  Deputy Karen Hansen and Sheriff Bob Brooks now move this Court for \n12  Summary Judgment Based on Qualified Immunity.  Plaintiff filed a timely \n13  opposition. \n14  LEGAL STANDARD \n15  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides for summary judgment \n16  against a party when  \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and \n17  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \n18  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a \n19  judgment as a matter oflaw.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  A party seeking summary \n20  judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its \n21  motion and of identifying those portions of the pleadings and discovery \n22  responses which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  See \n23  Celotex Corp. v.  Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  In judging evidence at the \n24  summary judgment stage, the Court docs not make credibility determinations or \n25  weigh conflicting evidence and draws all inferences in the light most favorable \n26  to the nonmoving party.  See T W Elec. Svc., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors \n27  Ass 'n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987).  The evidence presented by the \n28  parties must be admissible.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  Conclusory, speculative \n-3 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 4 of 12\ntestimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine \ni~~ues \n11; \n2  of fact and defeat summary judgment.  See Thornhill Pub. Co., Inc. v.  GTE.~~ \n-'1 \n3  Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).  '. . \n.1 \n.. , ~, \n4  DISCUSSION \n5  I.  Defendants' Motion for Qualified Immunity \n6  A.  Test for Qualified Immunity \n7  Qualified immunity provides public officials sued in their individual \n8  eapacities with \"immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.\" \n9  Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985) (emphasis in original).  In \n10  determining whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, the court must \n11  first consider whether, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, do the \n12  facts as alleged show the officers' conduct violated a constitutional right. \n13  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001).  If a constitutional violation exists \n14  \"on a favorable view of the parties' submissions, the next, sequential step is to \n15  ask whether the right was clearly established.\"  Id.; see Martinez v. Stanford, 323 \n16  FJd 1178, 1183 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating the two-part test for qualified immunity \n17  as: \"(1) whether the facts alleged 'show [that] the officer[s'] conduct violated a \n18  constitutional right;' and (2) whether the constitutional right in question was \n19  'clearly established' such that 'it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his \n20  conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted. '''). \n21  Whether the law was clearly established is a pure question oflaw for the \n22  Court to decide.  See Mendoza v.  Block, 27 FJd 1357, 1360 (9th Cir. 1994). \n23  This inquiry \"must be undertaken in light of the speeifie eontext of the case, not \n24  as a broad general proposition.\"  Id. at 201.  The Ninth Circuit has noted that, in \n25  order to find a clearly established right, \"we need not find a prior case with \n26  identieal, or even 'materially similar,' facts.  Our task is to determine whether the \n27  preexisting law provided the defendants with 'fair warning' that their conduct \n28  was unlawful.\"  Flores v. Morgan Hill Unified School District, 324 FJd 1130, \n-4 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 5 of 12\n1  1137 (9th Cir. 2003) citing Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730 (2002).  \"Precedent \nIl! \n2  directly on point is not necessary to demonstrate that a right is clearly \n4 \n3  established.  Rather, if the unlawfulness is apparent in light of preexisting law, \n, \n,) \n4  then the standard is met.  In addition, even ifthere is no closely analogous caSe \n5  law, a right can be clearly established on the basis of 'common sense.'\"  Giebel v. \n6  Sylvester, 244 FJd 1182, 1189 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). \n7  B.  Whether the Acts Committed By Defendant Constitute a \n8  Violation of Plaintiff's Constitutional Rights \n9  In this Court's July 22,2002 Order Granting in Part Plaintiff's Motion for \n10  Summary Judgment, the Court held that \"the visual unclothed body cavity search \n11  of Plaintiff was unconstitutiona1.\"  Under the circumstances of this case, where \n12  the undisputed facts show that the only basis for her body cavity search was that \n13  she had been charged with violating Health and Safety Code Section 11550 and \n14  she was released on bail prior to ever having been placed in the general jail \n15  population, the search was umeasonable and violated Plaintiff's constitutional \n16  rights. \n17  Therefore, the Court has already ruled upon the first prong of the qualified \n18  immunity inquiry, finding that Defendants' acts were unconstitutiona1. \n19  C.  Whether the Constitutional Right At Issue Was Clearly \n20  Established At the Time of the Violation \n21  In the present motion, Defendants Karen Hansen and Bob Brooks seek \n22  qualified immunity on the grounds that the constitutional right in question was \n23  not clearly established at the time of Plaintiffs search.  Defendants contend that \n24  the law was not clearly estahlished that prohibited the blanket search policy to \n25  which Plaintiff was subjected primarily because the acts of Defendants were \n26  permissible under the law. \n27 \n28 \n-5 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 6 of 12\n1.  Established Law Regarding Body Cavity Searches;:1 \nIU \n2  a.  Justification for Body Cavity Searches on Less~Than \n,1' \n3  Probable Cause  I j \n1,/, \n4  It is important to first note that the intrusiveness of a body cavity search, \n5  no matter what the circumstances, cannot be overstated.  \"Strip searches \n6  involving the visual exploration of body cavities is dehumanizing and \n7  humiliating.\"  Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 711 (9th Cir. \n8  1990).  In Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 561 (1979), after balancing the \n9  significant security interests of the institution against the privacy interests of the \n10  inmates, the Supreme Court held that visual body-cavity inspections could be \n11  conducted on less than probable cause.  In evaluating whether or not a search \n12  was permissible, \"Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the \n13  manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in \n14  which it is condueted.\"  Id. at 559.  The \"clearly-stated rationale underlying\" the \n15  decisions in which body-cavity searches of prisoners and detainees are allowed \n16  on less than probable cause, \"is to protect prisons and jails from smuggled \n17  weapons, drugs or other contraband which pose a threat to the safety and security \n18  of penal institutions.\"  Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1447 (9th Cir. \n19  1991); see also Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713 (\"The critical inquiry is whether the \n20  LAPD has sufficient justification for imposing its blanket search policy.\") \n21  Because ofthis underlying rationale, \"courts have distinguished between \n22  searches of detainees who were simply awaiting bail, and searches conducted on \n23  inmates admitted or about to be admitted to the general jail population.\"  Id. at \n24  1448. \n25  b.  Circumstances Allowing Body Cavity Search On \n26  Less Than Probable Cause \n27  In Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984), the Ninth Circuit \n28  applied the rule in Bell to hold that \"arrestees for minor offenses may be \n-6 \n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 7 of 12\nsubjected to a strip search only if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion that \n! I' \n2  the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband ...\"   Giles, 746:F.2d \n,.-\n\"1-\n3  at 614 (holding that strip searching every arrestee booked into County Jaih~ not \n\" , \n4  necessary to protect the institution's security interest).  \"Reasonable suspicion \n5  must be based on such factors as the nature of the offense, the arrestee's \n6  appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.  [d.  at 617 (emphasis \n7  added).  The Ninth Circuit applied this reasonable suspicion test in holding the \n8  Los Angeles Police Department's policy of requiring a perfunctory body-cavity \n9  search of all felony arrestees unconstitutional.  Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 716 (strip \n10  search of grand theft arrestee was unconstitutional where circumstances of arrest \n11  provided no reasonable suspicion to believe that arrestee concealed contraband); \n12  see also Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1446 (9th Cir. 1991) (\"Applying \n13  Kennedy, it is clcar that the visual body cavity inspection cannot be justified \n14  based on the blanket strip-search policy\").  The Ninth Circuit summarized its \n15  jurisprudence in this area by pointing out that prior cases had held \"such \n16  searches were lawful only if an officer had an individualized suspicion that a \n17  person was carrying or concealing contraband.\"  Fuller, 950 F. 2d at 1451. \n18  c.  Relevant California Law Regarding Body Cavity \n19  Searches \n20  California Penal Code Section 4030 was passed in 1984 by the California \n21  Legislature with the intention of protecting the constitutional rights of California \n22  citizens.  See Cal. Pen. Code ยง 4030.  This section provides that \n23  No person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor or \ninfraction offense, except those involving weapons, controlled \n24  substances or violence. ..  shall be subjected to a strip search or \nvisual body cavity search prior to placement in the general jail \n25  population, unless a peace officer has determined tfiere is reasonable \nsuspicion based on specific and articulablc facts to believe such \n26  person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and a stip search will \nresult in the discovery of tne weapon or contraband. \n27 \nCal. Pen. Code ยง 4030(f). \n28 \n-7 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 8 of 12\nIn People v.  Wade,  208 Cal. App. 3d 304, 307-08 (1989), the California \n.  1--\nLU \n2  Court of Appeals upheld the warrantless body cavity search of an arrestee eyen \n3  though it did not entirely comply with Section 4030.  The court noted that  . \n'/,1 \n4  Section 4030 was passed in an attempt to codify existing federal constitutional \n5  law regarding searches.  The court found the fruits of the search need not be \n6  suppressed because the search was constitutional under federal law based on the \n7  circumstances of the arrest in this case, where the arrestee was visibly under the \n8  influence of an opiate and the police who stopped the vehicle in which he was a \n9  passenger noticed him rise in his seat several times and his right shoulder dipped, \n10  as though he were trying to adjust something in his waist.  See id. at 307-08.  In \n11  People v. Pifer, 216 Cal. App. 3d 956, 962 (1990), the court evaluated the \n12  constitutionality of an X-ray search of a state prison inmate and held that the \n13  search \"under all the ambient circumstances of this case was reasonable within \n14  the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\"  Id.  The court in Pifer also included, \n15  \"[w]e hasten to add, however, that we do not suggest prison authorities could \n16  conduct a body cavity search on prisoners merely because they are prison \n17  inmates without more.  There must be some circumstance or information in \n18  addition to the mere fact of imprisonment to justify such an invasive procedure.\" \n19  Id. \n20  2.  Relevant Facts in the Body Cavity Search Declared \n21  Unconstitutional In This Case \n22  Defendants contend that, based on federal constitutional and state law, a \n23  reasonable officer would believe the search in this case was not violating \n24  Plaintiff's constitutional rights and was, in fact, in accordance with the law. \n25  Defendants cite to California Penal Code Section 4030 and the decision in \n26  People v.  Wade, in which body cavity searches are allowed under certain \n27  circumstances.  Defendants contend that Plaintiff's arrest on a drug-related \n28  charge, alone, was sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion to perform this \n-8 \n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 9 of 12\nI  c, \nsearch.  PlaintifT responds and argues that the law was clear at the time of the \n'~d \nLU \n2  search in question in September 2000 that a strip search could not be perfoqned \n> \n3  without reasonable suspicion based on specific articulable facts.  The partie_s \n'\",.oJ \n4  stipulate that the only basis for the search in this case was Plaintiffs arrest for \n5  the misdemeanor charge of violation of Health and Safety Code Section 11550 \n6  and Defendant County of Ventura Sheriff s Department policy of searching all \n7  arrestees for Section 11550 violations. \na.  Purpose of Search \n8 \n9  Defendants contend that this search was justified under current law \n10  because the purpose of the policy is to ascertain the presence or absence of \n11  concealed narcotics or narcotics paraphernalia.  According to Defendants, the \n12  policy is exclusively designed and necessary to maintain jail security by ensuring \n13  the safety of such individuals who might otherwise ingest the drugs or destroy \n14  evidence of the commission of a crime, attempt suicide, or get high.  See Defts' \n15  Mot. for Summ. Judg. at 7.  Defendants argue that searching all Section 11550 \n16  arrestees serves this policy. \n17  In considering the asserted justification for the search in question, it is \n18  important to note that this search was performed on an arrestee who was never \n19  actually released into the general jail population.  Plaintiff Way posted bail \n20  before being released into the jail population, but the search was performed on \n21  her regardless of this fact.  The clearly established rationale for body cavity \n22  searches on less than probable cause has been the protection of jail security by \n23  preventing the smuggling of weapons, narcotics, and other contraband into the \n24  jail facility.  See Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1447.  If an arrestee is not released into the \n25  general jail population, then the security justification for this search is not \n26  present and such a harsh and humiliating search should not be performed absent \n27  probable cause, consistent with clearly established Fourth Amendment \n28  jurisprudence of the Supreme Court and this Circuit.  Defendants also do not \n-9 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 10 of 12\nprovide any evidence of seizure of contraband during searches performed c, \nUJ \n2  pursuant to this policy to provide justification for this blanket policy. \n'1' \n3  Additionally, in examining the actual policy that was implemented by the \n(.\"! \n4  Sheriff's Department and followed by the deputy here, the purported justification \n5  is also absent.  The policy allows body cavity searches of misdemeanor arrestees \n6  involving weapons, controlled substances or violence without any articulable \n7  reasonable suspicion that is based on specific facts to believe such person is \n8  concealing a weapon or contraband.  However, with respect to allfelony arrests, \n9  a strip search \"should not be done unless a reasonable suspicion exists that the \n10  person is concealing a weapon or contraband. (I.) Reasonable suspicion may be \n11  based upon the nature of the offense, the arrestees appearance and conduct, and \n12  the prior arrest record.\"  Jt. Stmt. of Uncontroverted Facts, Exh. Cat 14.  A \n13  cursory examination of this written policy demonstrates that the Ventura County \n14  Sheriff's Department allows the body cavity strip search to be performed absent \n15  an articulable reasonable suspicion on misdemeanor drug or weapon arrestees, \n16  but requires a showing of reasonable suspicion on all felony arrestees.  Tfthe \n17  Defendants' justification for the blanket seareh of certain misdemeanor arrestees \n18  were jail security, then the felony arrest policy should mirror the misdemeanor \n19  arrest policy.  This incongruence between the policy for certain misdemeanor \n20  arrests and the policy for felony arrests casts severe doubt upon the need for this \n21  blanket search policy and Defendants' justification for this policy. \n22  The policy in this case both (a) failed to recognize a difference between \n23  detainees who were released on bail and those who entered the general \n24  population and (b) unexplainably provided a higher standard to perform this \n25  same search on felony drug or weapons arrestees who, under Defendants' theory, \n26  should provide the same (ifnot greater) risk of contraband as misdemeanor \n27  arrestees.  A reasonable officer reviewing the policy and knowing the established \n28  law in this area would have recognized that the policy of the Sheriffs \n- 10 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 11 of 12\nDepartment was unconstitutional because the policy did not serve to further,any \nL .... o \n2  legitimate penalogical interests. \n3  b.  Basis for Search In This Case \n4  Defendants contend that, based on California law, a fresh misdemeanor \n5  charge of violating Health and Safety Code Section 11550 supplies the basis for \n6  a visual unclothed body cavity search.  Plaintiff asserts that established law \n7  requires that more than a misdemeanor charge of being under the influence of a \n8  controlled substance to provide reasonable suspicion that the arrestee has \n9  concealed contraband. \n10  The parties have stipulated that the sole basis for the visual body cavity \n11  search of the plaintiff was that she was charged with violating Health and Safety \n12  Code Section 11550.  The parties have also stipulated that there is no waiting \n13  period to see if an inmate arrested on charges ofviolating Section 11550 will be \n14  released on bailor will enter the general jail population.  Since 1991 and the \n15  Ninth Circuit decision of Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1446 (9th Cir. \n16  1991), it has been clearly established that a body cavity search cannot be \n17  justified on the basis of a blanket strip search policy alone.  This Circuit has \n18  repeated that an officer conducting a body cavity search without probable cause \n19  must have reasonable suspicion based on such factors as the nature of the \n20  offense, the arrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record. \nVentura's blanket search policy does not allow for individualized suspicion, but \n21 \n22  instead subjects all arrestees, merely because of their status as arrestees, to this \n23  highly invasive search.  This is inconsistent with both California and Ninth \n24  Circuit law.  See, e.g., People v. Pifer, 216 Cal. App. 3d 956, 962 (1990); Fuller \n25  v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437 (9th Cir. 1991); Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police \n26  Dept., 901 F.2d 702, 712 (9th Cir. 1990).  A reasonable officer searching \n27  Plaintiff in this case should have known that this invasive search violated Ms. \n28  Way's constitutional rights ifthere was no particular belief that Ms. Way was \n- 11 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 90      Filed 02/18/2004     Page 12 of 12\n!

Wisotsky and Jeffrey Held, Law Offices of Alan E. Wisotsky, Oxnard, CA, for the defendants-\nappellants.\nEarnest C.S. Bell, Law Offices of Earnest C.S. Bell, Ventura, CA, for the plaintiff-appellee.\n[*]\nBefore RYMER and WARDLAW, Circuit Judges, and EDWARD C. REED, JR.,  District Judge.\nRYMER, Circuit Judge.\nWe must decide whether Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks and Deputy Karen Hanson are entitled to qualified\nimmunity for conducting a strip search with a visual cavity inspection of Noelle Way during the booking process at\na pre-trial detention facility on a misdemeanor charge of being under the influence of cocaine or\nmethamphetamine in violation of California Health & Safety Code ยง 11550(a). This requires us first to decide\nwhether a strip search with a visual cavity inspection can be justified based on Ventura County's blanket strip-\nsearch policy allowing such a search for arrestees charged with any controlled substance offense before\nplacement in the general jail population. The district court held that the search was unconstitutional, and we\nagree. However, it was not clearly established at the time of Way's booking that strip searching persons arrested\non drug charges is unreasonable. As the district court thought otherwise on this issue, we reverse.\nI\nOn September 6, 2000, Ventura Police Officer Ortiz encountered Way at her work place, the Red Cove Bar,\nwhere she was a bartender. He observed that she had dilated pupils, a rapid pulse rate, a nervous attitude and\nrapid speech. Based on these observations, he suspected that she was under the influence of cocaine or\nmethamphetamine, a misdemeanor violation of California Health & Safety Code ยง 11550(a), and arrested her at\n2:10 A.M. A blood sample taken from Way at a hospital the night of the arrest revealed that the officer's suspicion\nwas incorrect.\nMeanwhile, Ortiz took Way to Ventura County's pretrial detention facility for booking. The booking policy of the\nVentura County Sheriff's Department provided for a visual body cavity search of all persons arrested on fresh\nmisdemeanor drug charges. The search must be performed by a deputy of the same sex as the detainee, and it\ninvolves no touching. The person arrested was to be searched immediately upon booking, without a waiting\nperiod for posting bail.\n1159 *1159 Pursuant to the policy, Hanson sought and obtained her supervisor's approval to perform a body cavity\nsearch upon Way. The sole justification was that Way had been arrested for violating California Health & Safety\nCode ยง 11550(a). According to Hanson, \"the nature of the charges is viewed as providing the reasonable\nsuspicion required under the law to perform a visual strip search.\"\nThe search involved a visual inspection of Way's unclothed body cavities, and it took place in a private room with\nonly Hanson present. Hanson directed Way to remove all her clothing. She then directed Way to remove her\n\ntampon and to tear it and discard it in a wastebasket. Pursuant to the search policy, Way was required to \"bend\nforward, spread the buttocks, and cough to allow for a visual inspection of the anal area\" as well as to \"spread\nher labia at the same time to allow a check of the vaginal area.\" The search yielded no contraband, weapons or\ndrugs.\nThe booking process lasted 26 minutes, from 3:10 A.M. to 3:36 A.M. Within 20 minutes after the completion of the\nbody cavity search, Way learned the amount of her bail. She was placed in a holding cell with five or six other\nwomen, where she was allowed to make phone calls. She remained there for several hours. She then posted\nbail, and was released without entering the jail's general population.\nWay brought this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against Brooks and Hanson, as well as the County of\nVentura, alleging that they violated her civil rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by subjecting\nher to a body cavity search following her arrest. The parties both filed motions for summary judgment. The district\ncourt held that the search violated Way's constitutional rights because individualized suspicion is required for\narrestees who are not admitted to the general jail population. It denied qualified immunity to Brooks and Hanson\non the basis of Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 616-17 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam), overruled on other grounds\nby Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n. 1 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc); Kennedy v. Los Angeles\nPolice Dep't, 901 F.2d 702, 711 (9th Cir.1990) (as amended), implied overruling on other grounds recognized by \nAct Up!/Portland v. Bagley, 971 F.2d 298, 301 (9th Cir.1992); and Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1446 (9th\nCir.1991), holding that a reasonable officer reviewing Ventura's policy and the established law would have\nrecognized that the Sheriff Department's policy was unconstitutional because it did not further any legitimate\n[1]\npenological interests.  That ruling is the subject of this appeal.\nII\nWe analyze qualified immunity using the two-step inquiry set forth in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct.\n2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). The first step of the Saucier analysis requires us to decide whether this body\ncavity search violated Way's constitutional rights. Id. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. If so, \"the next, sequential step is to\nask whether the right was clearly established.\" Id. For a right to be clearly established, its contours \"`must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates the right.'\" Id. at 202,\n121 S.Ct. 2151 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987)). The\n1160 protection afforded *1160 by qualified immunity \"safeguards `all but the plainly incompetent or those who\nknowingly violate the law.'\" Brewster v. Bd. of Educ. of the Lynwood Unified Sch. Dist., 149 F.3d 971, 977 (9th\nCir.1998) (quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986)).\nA\nBrooks and Hanson argue that the visual body cavity search violated no constitutional rights because Sheriff's\nDepartment officials are entitled to deference on jail security matters, and their interest in securing this jail during\nthe booking process outweighs Way's right to be free from a compulsory visual inspection of her genitalia and\nanus. They also contend that the Sheriff Department's strip search policy complies with state law as set out in\n[2]\nCalifornia Penal Code ยง 4030.  Way responds that drug charges alone are insufficient to justify such an\nextreme intrusion, where she was merely a misdemeanor arrestee charged with being under the influence of a\ncontrolled substance, who was detained for only a few hours and was never housed with the jail's general\npopulation.\nWe assess the constitutionality of a search by balancing \"the need for the particular search against the invasion\nof personal rights that the search entails.\" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447\n(1979). This requires us to weigh \"the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the\njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" Id.\nThe scope of the intrusion here is indisputably a \"frightening and humiliating\" invasion, even when conducted\n\"with all due courtesy.\" Giles, 746 F.2d at 617. Its intrusiveness \"cannot be overstated.\" Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 711\n\n; see also Kirkpatrick v. City of Los Angeles, 803 F.2d 485, 489-90 (9th Cir.1986) (\"[T]he fact that a strip search is\nconducted reasonably, without touching and outside the view of all persons other than the party performing the\nsearch, does not negate the fact that a strip search is a significant intrusion on the person searched.\n. . .\" (citation omitted)); Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1446 (9th Cir.1989) (\"The feelings of\nhumiliation and degradation associated with forcibly exposing one's nude body to strangers for visual inspection\nis beyond dispute.\").\n1161 The parties agree that the search took place in a private room, behind closed *1161 doors, with no one present\nbut Way and Hanson, and there is no issue about how it was conducted.\nThis leaves the question whether the intrusion was justified. We recognize the difficulty of operating a detention\nfacility safely, the seriousness of the risk of smuggled weapons and contraband, and the deference we owe jail\nofficials' exercise of judgment in adopting and executing policies necessary to maintain institutional security. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. at 546-47, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. However, this does not mean that a blanket policy is\nconstitutionally acceptable simply by virtue of jail officials' invocation of security concerns. Giles, 746 F.2d at 616.\nRather, the policy must be \"`reasonably related' to the [detention facility's] interest in maintaining security.\" \nKennedy, 901 F.2d at 713 (citing Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 540, 99 S.Ct. 1861).\nBrooks and Hanson failed to show any link between their blanket strip search policy and legitimate security\nconcerns for detainees such as Way. See Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (imposing burden on officials to demonstrate\nthat security interests warrant the serious invasion of privacy inflicted by a strip search policy). They made only a\nconclusory submission that the purpose of the search protocol is \"to provide facility security and to ensure the\ninmate's health and safety,\" and that inmates have \"sometimes\" ingested drugs to evade detection. Nor did they\nadduce evidence of any deterrent effect on persons such as Way who are spontaneously arrested and detained\n[3]\ntemporarily at the facility for being under the influence. Cf. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (noting\nevidence in the record documenting detainees' attempts to secrete money, drugs, weapons and other contraband\nin body cavities). In effect, they ask us to take security implications on faith. This we cannot do. See Kennedy,\n901 F.2d at 713 (declining to accept the Los Angeles Police Department's justification for a blanket strip search\npolicy as it rested only on assumptions and societal judgments without documentation of risk).\nBrooks and Hanson maintain that all drug offenses inherently heighten security concerns because of the risk that\npersons arrested on drug charges will bring drugs with them. Perhaps with respect to other types of drug\noffenses 00 about which we express no opinion 00 but the record shows us nothing about this jail (or any other\n97 97\njail's) experience with those arrested on ยง 11550(a) charges. We do not disagree that in some cases, the charge\nitself may give rise to reasonable suspicion; indeed, we so held in Thompson, where the felony charged was\ngrand theft auto and the offense was \"sufficiently associated with violence to justify a visual strip search.\" 885\nF.2d at 1447. We have also been careful to distinguish charges that involve drugs and contraband as well as\nviolence when invalidating blanket strip search policies applied in other contexts. See Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 716\n(holding unconstitutional a strip search policy applied to person arrested for stealing a roommate's belongings,\nobserving that \"[n]o weapons, no drugs, no contraband, no violent acts of any kind were involved\"); Giles, 746\nF.2d at 618 (declaring unconstitutional a policy requiring that all persons booked on minor traffic offenses be strip\nsearched, while noting that the \"offense was minor and was related neither to drugs nor to weapons\"). However,\n1162 we have never said that all offenses of any particular nature support reasonable suspicion. To the contrary, *1162\nthe charge in Kennedy was for grand theft as it was in Thompson, but we held that a strip search policy was\nunconstitutional as applied to Kennedy because the grand theft charge there arose out of an ordinary\ndisagreement that did not in itself pose a threat of violence in jail.\nWe cannot see how the charge of being under the influence of a drug necessarily poses a threat of concealing\n(and thereby using or trafficking) additional drugs in jail during the limited time between booking and bail, or\nbooking and placement in the general population. If not, it was unreasonable to assume that Way harbored drugs\n[4]\nin some cavity or other.  \"Reasonable suspicion may be based on such factors as the nature of the offense, the\narrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.\" Giles, 746 F.2d at 617. Way was under the\ncontrol of the arresting officer from the time she was taken into custody at work until booking. The officer\nperceived no indication that she was carrying drugs or contraband. Compare, e.g., People v. Wade, 208 Cal.\nApp.3d 304, 306-07, 256 Cal.Rptr. 189, 190-91 (Cal.Ct.App.1989) (holding that a body cavity search was justified\n\nby the arresting officers' observation of the suspect apparently trying to put something beneath his waistband).\nHanson conducted a pat down search before obtaining permission for the visual cavity search, and it turned up\n[5]\nnothing.  Way was held with several other detainees, but was not in the facility for long and was never put into\nthe general jail population. See Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1448 (\"In determining the constitutionality of strip searches of\narrestees, courts have distinguished between searches of detainees who were simply awaiting bail, and searches\nconducted on inmates admitted or about to be admitted to the general jail population.\"); Ward v. County of San\nDiego, 791 F.2d 1329, 1333 (9th Cir.1986) (\"In most instances the unreasonableness of a strip search conducted\nprior to an [own recognizance] release determination is plain.\"). In these circumstances, we conclude that an\narrest for being under the influence of a drug does not supply reasonable suspicion that drugs are concealed in a\nbodily cavity.\nAs there is no evidence that security concerns require strip searching all arrestees on all drug offenses before\nplacement in the general jail population, and none that all persons arrested for being under the influence of a\ndrug are likely to have concealed more drugs in a bodily cavity, the Sheriff Department's blanket policy cannot be\na proxy for reasonable suspicion. There was no individualized suspicion that Way concealed drugs in a bodily\ncavity. Therefore, subjecting her to a strip search with visual cavity inspection offended her constitutional right to\nbe free of an unreasonable search.\nB\nHaving determined that Way's constitutional rights were violated, the remaining question is whether it was clearly\nestablished at the time of the search that the search was unconstitutional. See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201, 121\n1163 S.Ct. 2151. \"If *1163 the law did not put [Brooks and Hanson] on notice that[their] conduct would be clearly\nunlawful, summary judgment based on qualified immunity is appropriate.\" Id. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151.\nWe had held prior to Way's search that performing a strip search with visual cavity inspection before determining\nwhether the person was eligible for release on his own recognizance could not be justified based on a blanket\npolicy of subjecting all minor offense arrestees to a strip search, Ward, 791 F.2d 1329; that a visual body cavity\nsearch of a person arrested on an offense that did not involve violence could not be justified by a blanket policy of\nsubjecting all those arrested for felonies to such a search, Kennedy, 901 F.2d 702; and that a strip and body\ncavity search of all felony arrestees could not be justified based on the jail's blanket search policy regardless of\nthe crime with which they were charged, Fuller, 950 F.2d 1437. However, we had never previously addressed the\nconstitutionality of a body cavity search policy premised on the nature of this or any other drug offense. More\nimportantly, we had held that the nature of the offense alone may provide reasonable suspicion, Thompson, 885\nF.2d at 1447, and twice pointed to charges involving drugs, contraband and violence as the kind of offense that\nmight give rise to reasonable suspicion. Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 716; Giles, 746 F.2d at 618. In these\ncircumstances, we cannot conclude that a reasonable officer would necessarily have realized that relying on a\nDepartment policy that excepted arrestees being held on controlled substance offenses from the general\nprohibition on strip searches, and subjecting Way to a strip search with visual cavity inspection pursuant to it, was\nunconstitutional.\nThe district court came to a different conclusion by analogy to the Tenth Circuit's decision in Foote v. Spiegel, 118\nF.3d 1416 (10th Cir.1997). There, a highway patrol officer arrested Foote for being under the influence of\nmarijuana. Id. at 1420. She was strip searched when booked at the county jail and was released without being\nplaced in the general jail population. Id. at 1421. The court held that the search was unconstitutional, and that the\nofficers were not entitled to qualified immunity. However, Foote's qualified immunity analysis turned on the fact\nthat before the Foote search was conducted, Cottrell v. Kaysville City, 994 F.2d 730, 734-35 (10th Cir.1993),\nclearly established that merely being arrested for driving under the influence of drugs does not justify a strip\nsearch. Foote, 118 F.3d at 1421. Our law was not so clear (until now), hence our reluctance to hold Brooks and\nHanson personally liable for damages.\nWe therefore conclude that subjecting Way to a strip search with visual cavity inspection during the booking\nprocess on a misdemeanor charge of being under the influence of a drug was not justified by the jail's blanket\npolicy of strip searching all those arrested on charges involving a controlled substance. Undocumented security\n\nneeds of the jail facility do not outweigh the invasion of Way's personal rights. Nor is such an intrusive search\nwarranted solely on account of the nature of the charge in this case, as being under the influence of a drug does\nnot necessarily indicate that the person has concealed more drugs in a body cavity. This said, a reasonable\nofficial in the position of Brooks and Hanson would not have understood that following the jail's policy violated\nWay's rights because the unconstitutionality of the search they conducted was not clearly established at the time.\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\n1164 *1164 WARDLAW, Circuit Judge, concurring:\nI concur with all but part B of the well-written majority opinion. I depart from the majority because I believe that at\nthe time of Way's body cavity search, the Fourth Amendment principles governing blanket searches prohibited\nstrip and body cavity blanket searches and required individualized reasonable suspicion based on specific and\narticulable facts before such a search could be conducted on a misdemeanor arrestee. I particularly disagree with\nthe majority's parsimonious approach to the analysis of our precedent, which focuses on the application of clearly\nestablished Fourth Amendment principles to each penal code section we have addressed and not on the well-\nestablished principles themselves. The fact of the matter is that Ventura County had an unconstitutional blanket\nstrip search policy which permitted such searches based upon no specific, articulable facts at all 00 a policy we\n97\nhave repeatedly held unconstitutional. I cannot go so far as to say that under the circumstances the individual\nofficers acted objectively unreasonably, however, only because reasonable officers in Brooks' and Hanson's\nposition could have believed that the Ventura County Sheriff's Department policy comported with the Constitution.\nTherefore I concur in holding that the officers are entitled to qualified immunity.\nI\nI disagree that we can find clearly established law in this case only if we have previously addressed the\nconstitutionality of a strip and body cavity search of a misdemeanor drug arrestee. To the contrary, a\nconstitutional right may be clearly established when \"[t]he reasoning, though not the holding\" of a prior decision\napplies to a set of facts, Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 743, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002), and\n\"officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances,\" id.\nat 741, 122 S.Ct. 2508. \"Otherwise, officers would escape responsibility for the most egregious forms of conduct\nsimply because there was no case on all fours prohibiting that particular manifestation of unconstitutional\nconduct.\" Deorle v. Rutherford, 272 F.3d 1272, 1286 (9th Cir.2001). The Supreme Court has rejected this\nparsimonious approach to the Fourth Amendment principle of reasonableness, stating that the balancing test\nfashioned in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), is \"not capable of precise\ndefinition or mechanical application.\"\nThe clearly established general Fourth Amendment principle of reasonableness, which we have applied to strip\nand body cavity searches of arrestees, see Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1445 (9th\nCir.1989), rendered the Ventura County blanket strip and body cavity search policy unconstitutional. We have\ninterpreted the principle of reasonableness in the context of misdemeanor pretrial detainees to require application\nof a standard of individualized reasonable suspicion, such that \"arrestees . . . may be subjected to a strip search\nonly if jail officials have a reasonable suspicion that the particular arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband or\nsuffering from a communicable disease.\" Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 615 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam)\n(emphasis added), overruled in part on other grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1040 n. 1\n(9th Cir.1999) (en banc). Only consideration of the multiplicity of factors giving rise to individualized reasonable\nsuspicion, such as \"the nature of the offense, the arrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest\nrecord,\" properly balances the \"intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against [the] promotion\n1165 of legitimate governmental interests.\" Id. at 617 (emphasis added). Moreover, \"[i]n most instances *1165 the\nunreasonableness of a strip search conducted prior to an [own recognizance] release determination is plain.\" \nWard v. County of San Diego, 791 F.2d 1329, 1333 (9th Cir.1986). We have routinely struck down blanket strip\nsearch policies as applied against misdemeanor arrestees, and we have gone so far as to state that \"no\npublished state or federal case since Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908\n\n(1966) . . . upholds the constitutionality of a blanket policy of strip searches of minor offense arrestees.\" Ward,\n791 F.2d at 1332.\nWhile the majority broadly asserts that we held in Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447, that the nature of the charge\nalone, when it involves drugs, contraband, or violence, warrants a departure from the standard of individualized\nreasonable suspicion, I read our holding in Thompson much more narrowly. First, we explicitly limited Thompson\nto the facts of the case, stating that \"our decision is extremely narrow and only applies to theft of an automobile.\" \nId. at 1447 n. 6. Second, the Thompson case does not control Way's case because Thompson was strip\nsearched not at the time of booking, but rather when he entered the general county jail population, where he\nremained for five days. Id. at 1442. While this additional factor alone will not justify a strip search, id., \"[i]n\ndetermining the constitutionality of strip searches of arrestees, courts have distinguished between searches of\ndetainees who were simply awaiting bail, and searches conducted on inmates admitted or about to be admitted\nto the general jail population,\" Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437, 1448 (9th Cir.1991). The majority bolsters its\nargument by pointing out that in Giles, 746 F.2d at 618, and Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 702,\n716 (9th Cir. 1990),implied overruling in part on other grounds recognized by Act Up!/Portland v. Bagley, 988\nF.2d 868, 872 (9th Cir.1993), we pointed to charges involving drugs, contraband, and violence as the kind of\noffenses that might give rise to reasonable suspicion. However, our holdings in those cases considered the\nnature of the charge only in combination with other specific and individualized factors.\nDeparture from the standard of individualized reasonable suspicion in deference to the security concerns of\nprison officials, see Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, is appropriate only when there is \"sufficient justification\nfor [the] blanket search policy,\" Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 713. We struck down a blanket policy similar to the Ventura\nCounty Sheriff's Department's in Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861), because no\nsecurity concerns comparable to those in Bell had been demonstrated. Demonstration of legitimate security\nconcerns is required because the Court in Bell \"did not . . . read out of the Constitution the provision of general\napplication that a search be justified as reasonable under the circumstances.\" Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 800\n(2nd Cir.1986). As the majority concludes, there is no documentation of security concerns in this case which are\nserious enough to justify a departure from the general rule requiring individualized reasonable suspicion. The\nfacts of this case amply demonstrate the perils of such a blanket search policy, because all of the circumstances\nsurrounding Way's arrest and detention negate the conclusion that Way, a detainee who had no chance to\nsecrete drugs, was to post bail shortly after her arrest, and who would never be mingled with the general jail\npopulation, was concealing contraband. At the time the search was performed, it was clearly established that\nabsent a showing of serious security concerns tipping the balance in favor of the government interest, the Fourth\nAmendment required application of the standard of individualized reasonable suspicion.\n1166  II\n*1166\nWhile it is generally the case that \"[i]f the law was clearly established, the immunity defense ordinarily should fail,\nsince a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his conduct,\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), in measuring the \"objective reasonableness\" of\nthe officer's conduct we have looked beyond the existing body of case law to whether the officer relied on a state\nstatute, regulation, or official policy that explicitly sanctioned the conduct in question, see Wilson v. Layne, 526\nU.S. 603, 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999); Grossman v. City of Portland, 33 F.3d 1200, 1209 (9th\nCir. 1994). While reliance upon a statute does not render the officer's conduct per se reasonable, Roska v.\nPeterson, 328 F.3d 1230, 1252 (10th Cir.2003), \"the existence of a statute or ordinance authorizing particular\nconduct is a factor which militates in favor of the conclusion that a reasonable official would find that conduct\nconstitutional,\" because \"police officers on the street are ordinarily entitled to rely on the assumption that the\n[legislature] ha[s] considered the views of legal counsel and concluded that the ordinance is a valid and\nconstitutional exercise of authority,\" Grossman, 33 F.3d at 1209.\nIn this case, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department policy authorized the conduct in question. Officers Brooks\nand Hanson complied with that policy. In addition, California Penal Code ยง 4030(f) specifically exempts those\narrested on misdemeanor \"weapons, controlled substances or violence\" charges from the general prohibition on\nstrip and body cavity searches of persons arrested for misdemeanors. Because the policy and the state statute\n\nhad not fallen into desuetude, Grossman, 33 F.3d at 1209 n. 19, nor were they \"patently violative of fundamental\nconstitutional principles,\" id. at 1209, it was objectively reasonable for officers Brooks and Hanson to rely on the\npolicy and the state statute in performing the strip search on Way. I therefore concur with the majority in finding\nthat the officers are entitled to qualified immunity.\n[*] The Honorable Edward C. Reed, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by\ndesignation.\n[1] Brooks and Hanson previously filed an appeal from the district court's order denying qualified immunity, which\nwe dismissed as premature because the court had not also determined whether Way's constitutional rights were \nviolated. Way v. County of Ventura, 348 F.3d 808 (9th Cir.2003).\n[2] California Penal Code ยง 4030(a) provides: \nThe Legislature finds and declares that law enforcement policies and practices for conducting strip or body cavity\nsearches of detained persons vary widely throughout California. Consequently, some people have been arbitrarily\nsubjected to unnecessary strip and body cavity searches after arrests for minor misdemeanor and infraction\noffenses. Some present search practices violate state and federal constitutional rights to privacy and freedom\nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures.\nIt is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to protect the state and federal constitutional rights of the\npeople of California by establishing a statewide policy strictly limiting strip and body cavity searches.\nSubsection (f) provides that \"[n]o person arrested and held in custody on a misdemeanor . . . offense, except\nthose involving weapons, controlled substances or violence . . . shall be subjected to a strip search or visual body\ncavity search prior to placement in the general jail population\" without \"reasonable suspicion based on specific\nand articulable facts to believe such person is concealing a weapon or contraband, and a strip search will result\nin the discovery of the weapon or contraband.\" To conduct such a search requires authorization of the\nsupervising officer on duty, which \"shall include the specific and articulable facts and circumstances upon which\nthe reasonable suspicion determination was made by the supervisor.\" Cal.Penal Code ยง 4030(f).\n[3] Counsel suggested at oral argument that the facility had experienced difficulties since the district court's ruling\nin this case, but the record contains no evidence of whatever they might be.\n[4] We have no occasion to comment on any other kind of drug offense, which may have different characteristics\nthat might lead to a different analysis on a different record. See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez-Rincon, 36 F.3d\n859, 861, 864 (9th Cir.1994) (discussing narcotics smuggler who carried 73 balloons of cocaine in her rectum and\nalimentary canal).\n[5] At argument, counsel suggested that LSD, for example, can be smuggled on postage stamps or the like that\nare not readily discoverable during a pat down search. However, there is no evidence to this effect in the record\nand it is not self-evident that cocaine or methamphetamine (which is what Way was suspected of being under the\ninfluence of) are routinely concealed in this way.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

No Reply has been filed to date. \n11  BACKGROUND \n12  The parties submit that the legal issues that the Court needs to resolve are the following: \n13  I.  What constitutes the reasonable suspicion required to conduct a visual unclothed body \n14  cavity search of a pretrial detainee? \n15  2.  Can the arresting agency's charge that the pretrial detainee violated Health and Safety Code \n16  Section 11550, without more, equal the reasonable suspicion needed to justify a visual \n17  unclothed body cavity search? \n18  3.  Is a policy of performing visual unclothed body cavity searches ofp retrial detainees arrested \n19  for being under the influence of an illegal controlled substance, in violation of Health and \n20  Safety Code Section 11550, constitutional? \n21  4.  Constitutionally, before conducting a visual unclothed body cavity search, should a pretrial \n22  detainee be given an opportunity to post bail? \n23  5.  Was the visual unclothed body cavity search of the plaintiff in accordance with California \n24  Penal Code Section 4030? \n2S  The Court finds that the issues that have been briefed and are before the Court are whether \n26  the policy of conducting visual unclothed body cavity searches of pretrial detainees not placed \n27 \n28  Robert Brooks is the Sheriff ofthe County of Ventura. \n-2 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 55      Filed 07/22/2002     Page 3 of 12\n1  within the general jail population based solely on the fact that they have been charged with a \n2  violation of Health and Safety Code Section 115502 is constitutional and whether the visual \n3  unclothed body cavity search ofthe plaintiff was in accordance with California Penal Code Section \n4  4030. \n5  The parties have stipulated to the following facts for purposes of the present motions: \n6  1.  Plaintiff Noelle Way was arrested on September 6,2000, at approximately 2:10 a.m. by \n7  non-movant defendant Robert Ortiz. \n8  2.  Robert Ortiz was acting in the capacity of a City of San Buenaventura police officer when \n9  he arrested the plaintiff. \n10  3.  Officer Ortiz's arrest of the plaintifftook place at her place of employment, the Red Cove \n11  bar, located at 1809 East Main Street in the City of San Buenaventura. \n12  4.  Officer Ortiz arrested the plaintiff for being,  in his opinion, under the influence of a \n13  controlled substance in violation of California Health and Safety Code Section 11550(a) at \n14  the time of her arrest. \n15  5.  The offense for which Officer Ortiz arrested the plaintiff was a misdemeanor. \n16 \n17 \nSection 11550(a) provides as follows: \n18 \nNo person shall use, or be under the influence of any controlled substance which is \n19 \n(1) specified in subdivision (b), (c), or (e), or paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of \nSection 11054, specified in paragraph (14), (15), (21), (22), or (23) of subdivision (d) \n20 \nof Section 11054, specified in subdivision (b) or (c) of Section 11055, or specified \n21  in paragraph (I) or (2) of subdivision (d) or in paragraph (3) of subdivision (e) of \nSection 11055, or (2) a narcotic drug classified in Schedule ill, IV, or V, except when \n22 \nadministered by or under the direction of a person licensed by the state to dispense, \nprescribe, or administer controlled substances.  It shall be the burden of the defense \n23 \nto show that it comes within the exception.  Any person convicted of violating this \n24  subdivision is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be sentenced to serve a term of not \nless than 90 days or more than one year in a countyjail. The court may place a person \n25  convicted under this subdivision on probation for a period not to exceed five years \nand, except as provided in subdivision (c), shall in all cases in which probation is \n26 \ngranted require, as a condition thereof, that the person be confined in a county jail for \n27  at least 90 days. Other than as provided by subdivision (c ), in no event shall the court \nhave the power to absolve a person who violates this subdivision from the obligation \n28  of spending at least 90 days in confinement in a county jail. \n-3 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 55      Filed 07/22/2002     Page 4 of 12\n1  6.  After transporting the plaintiff to the Ventura County Medical Center to obtain a blood \n2  sample, Officer Ortiz took the plaintiff to the pretrial detention facility (county jail) to be \n3  booked on the stated charge. \n4  7.  Plaintiff was a pretrial detainee at all times relevant to  her contact with the moving \n5  defendants. \n6  8.  Defendant Deputy Karen Hanson is a female custody deputy employed by the Ventura \n7  County Sheriffs Department who was the booking officer and deputy who performed all \n8  activities relating to the plaintiffs booking on September 6, 2000, including reception \n9  booking, master booking, and the visual unclothed body cavity search ofthe plaintiff at the \n10  Ventura  County Jail;  Deputy  Hanson  has  worked  for  the  Ventura  County Sheriffs \n11  Department for 21 years. \n12  9.  Approximately an hour after her arrest, at about 3: 10  a.m., the plaintiff arrived at the pretrial \n13  detention facility and her booking process began. \n14  10.  During the plaintiff s booking process, as part of routine procedure, Officer Ortiz prepared \n15  and submitted two documents to Karen Hanson, the custody deputy handling plaintiffs \n16  booking: \n17  (a)  One document was the booking information sheet in which Officer Ortiz stated that \n18  he had arrested the plaintiff for misdemeanor violation of Health and Safety Code \n19  Section  11550(a) at 2:10 a.m.  on September 6, 2000,  at the Red Cove bar in \n20  Ventura, among other information; \n21  (b)  The second document prepared by Officer Ortiz was a declaration for probable \n22  cause hearing, which he signed under penalty of peIjury on September 6, 2000, in \n23  which Officer Ortiz stated that he was a peace officer employed by the Ventura \n24  Police Department; that at 2: 10 a.m. on September 6, 2000, he developed probable \n25  cause to form the opinion that the plaintiff was violating Health and Safety Code \n26  Section 11550; that he observed the plaintiff exhibit certain symptoms on September \n27  6,2000, in Ventura indicative of being under the influence of a controlled substance \n28  stimulant; that he prepared a police report; and that the plaintiff had been given a \n-4-\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 55      Filed 07/22/2002     Page 5 of 12\n1  chemical test whose results were pending; \n2  II.  While defendant Karen Hanson does not recall any particulars about this case or the \n3  plaintiff, her custom and practice would be to read the two documents prepared by Officer \n4  Ortiz during the course of booking the plaintiff. \n5  12.  The Ventura County Sheriffs Department, in the operation of its pretrial detention facility, \n6  contends that a fresh misdemeanor charge of violating Health and Safety Code Section \n7  11550 supplies the basis for a visual unclothed body cavity search. \n8  13.  Under the policy of the Ventura County Sheriffs Department, a visual unclothed body \n9  cavity search is performed by a custody deputy of the same sex as the pretrial detainee and \n10  does not involve any touching of the person of the pretrial detainee by the custody deputy. \n11  14.  The plaintiff was booked between 3:10 a.m. and 3:36 a.m. by Deputy Hanson. \n12  15.  Deputy Hanson obtained permission to perform the visual unclothed body cavity search \n13  upon the plaintiff from Senior Deputy Dave Brantley, who authorized Deputy Hanson to \n14  conduct the strip search of the plaintiff. \n15  16.  Approximately 20 minutes transpired between the time the plaintiff was informed of the \n16  amount of her bail and the time of the performance by Deputy Hanson of the visual \nl7  unclothed body cavity search of the plaintiff. \n18  17.  Deputy Hanson performed a visual-only unclothed body cavity search of the plaintiff. \n19  18.  The visual unclothed body cavity search took place in a private room in the women's \n20  booking area of the pretrial detention facility with only Deputy Hanson and the plaintiff \n21  present. \n22  19.  During the search, defendant Hanson observed that the plaintiffhad a tampon and required \n23  the plaintiff to remove, tear, and discard the tampon in the adjacent wastebasket. \n24  20.  If a pretrial detainee is having a menstrual period, she will be required to remove her \n25  tampon, pull it  apart during the strip/visual body cavity search, and discard it in the \n26  wastebasket. \n27  21.  Deputy Hanson performed the visual unclothed body cavity search of the plaintiff solely \n28  because the plaintiff was charged by Officer Ortiz with violating Health and Safety Code \n-5 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 55      Filed 07/22/2002     Page 6 of 12\n1  Section 11550; Deputy Hanson did not have any other information leading her to believe \n2  that the plaintiff was concealing contraband in her body cavities. \n3  22.  It is the policy of the Ventura County Sheriffs Department in the operation of its pretrial \n4  detention facility to perform visual unclothed body cavity searches ofe very pretrial detainee \n5  arrested for alleged violation of Health and Safety Code Section 11550, a misdemeanor. \n6  23.  Upon the plaintiffs arrival at the pretrial detention facility, in women's booking, Deputy \n7  Hanson performed a pat-down search of plaintiff, during which Deputy Hanson did not see \n8  or feel anything which would lead her to believe that the plaintiff was concealing drugs or \n9  weapons on her person or in her body cavities. \n10  24.  There is no waiting period to see if an inmate arrested on charges of Health and Safety Code \n11  Section 11550 will be able to post bail before performing the visual unclothed body cavity \n12  search of such pretrial detainee. \n13  25.  The strip search ofthe plaintiff did not yield any contraband, weapons, or drugs hidden on \n14  or in her person.3 \n15  26.  No charges were ever filed against the plaintiff. \n16  27.  The blood sample obtained from the plaintiff at the Ventura County Medical Center and \n17  analyzed by the Ventura County Sheriff s Department Criminalistics Laboratory did not \n18  reveal the presence of any controlled substances or drugs in the plaintiffs blood - the test \n19  was negative for controlled substances. \n20  28.  The plaintiff contends that while naked, she was called derogatory and insulting names by \n21  defendant Deputy Hanson, such as \"raunch\" and \"whore.\" \n22  Defendants supplemented the Joint Statement with additional facts, to which Plaintiffs have \n23  not stipulated.  Defendants provide declarations stating that the purpose of conducting visual \n24  unclothed body cavity searches is to provide facility security and ensure the health and safety ofthe \n25  individuals, that mUltiple female arrestees may be held in the same holding cell while they are being \n26  booked, and that the purpose of searching Plaintiff was to ascertain whether she had concealed \n27 \n28  efendants dispute the relevance of Facts 26-29. \n-6 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 55      Filed 07/22/2002     Page 7 of 12\n1  drugs or drug paraphernalia. \n2  DISCUSSION \n3  I.  Cross Motions for Summary Judgment as to Defendants County, Brooks, and Hanson \n4  A.  Standard of Law \n5  Summary judgment against a party is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers \n6  to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \n7  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter \n8  of law.\"  FED. R. Cry. P. 56(c) (emphasis added). \n9  initial burden ofinforming the court of the basis for its motion and of identifying those portions of \n10  the pleadings and discovery responses which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue ofm  aterial \n11  fact.  Celotex Corp.  v.  Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553 (1986).  Where the \n12  nonmoving party will have the burden of proof at trial, the movant can prevail merely by pointing \n13  out that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.  See id.  If the \n14  moving party meets its initial burden, the nonmoving party must then set forth, by affidavit or as \n15  otherwise provided in Rule 56, \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\" FED. \n16  R. Cry. P. 56(e); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250,106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511 (1986). \n17  In judging evidence at the summary judgment stage, the Court does not make credibility \n18  determinations or weigh conflicting evidence and draws all inferences in thc light most favorable \n19  to the nonmoving party.  T. W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass 'n, 809 F.2d 626, \n20  630ยท31 (9th Cir. 1987).  The evidence presented by the parties must be admissible. FED. R. Cry. P. \n21  56(e).ยท- .  affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise \n22  genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment.  See Thornhill Pub. Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp., \n23  594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979). \n24  B.  Analysis \n25  1.  Constitutionality of Visual Unclothed Body Cavity Search \n26  The Supreme Court addressed visual unclothed body cavity inspections of pretrial detainees \n27  in institutional settings in Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S. Ct. 1861 (1979), holding that such \n28  inspections could be conducted on less than probable cause without violating the reasonableness \nยท7ยท \n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 55      Filed 07/22/2002     Page 8 of 12\n1  standard of the Fourth Amendment.  See Bell, 441 U.S. at 559-60.  \"ill detennining whether an \n2  institutional search policy is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, a court must balance 'the \n3  need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. '\"  Fuller \n4  v. M.G. Jewelry, 950F.2d 1437, 1445 (9th Cir. 1991)(quotingBell, 441 U.S. at 559). The Supreme \n5  Court set forth factors to be considered in detennining reasonableness: the scope of the intrusion, \n6  the mamler in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is \n7  conducted.  See id. at 559.  The Ninth Circuit has held that such searches must be supported by \n8  reasonable suspicion that the arrestee \"is carrying or concealing contraband.\" See Kennedy v. Los \n9  Angeles Police Department, 901 F.2d 702 (9th Cir. 1990) (citing Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 \n10  (9th Cir. 1984)). ill detennining whether there is reasonable suspicion, courts should consider the \n11  nature of the offense, the arrestee's appearance and conduct, and the prior arrest record.  See Giles, \n12  746 F.2d at 716.  The rationale for allowing visual unclothed body cavity searches of pretrial \n13  detainees supported by less than probable cause \"is to protect prisons and jails from smuggled \n14  weapons drugs or other contraband which pose a .threat to  the safety and security of penal \n15  institutions.\" Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1447. \n16  To hold the County liable, the Plaintiff must show that the County maintained a custom, \n17  policy, or practice that caused a violation of her federal constitutional rights.  Monell v. New York \n18  City Department o/Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978). The parties have stipulated that the \n19  visual unclothed body cavity search of Plaintiff was conducted pursuant to the County's policy. \n20  The parties have stipulated that the only fact supporting the search of Plaintiff was that she \n21  had been charged with violating Health and Safety Code Section 11550.  Defendants argue that \n22  their search policy is justified because it ensures that arrestees do not injure themselves by ingesting \n23  drugs or their containers and to make sure that they do not injure or pass drugs to other arrestees \n24  who are also being held at the pretrial detention facility.  Defendants provide the declaration of \n25  BOffilie Gatling, facility administrative sergeant in charge oft raining custody deputies at the Ventura \n26  County Pretrial Detention Facility in support of this proposition.  She states that \"imnates have \n27  occasionally managed to evade our facility security protocols and ingested drugs or their containers, \n28  usually balloons.\" Gatling Dec!. at  8.  Defendants provide no evidence regarding whether these \n~ \n- 8 -\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 55      Filed 07/22/2002     Page 9 of 12\n1  inmates were charged with violating Health and Safety Code Section 11550, or whether visual \n2  unclothed body cavity searches of pretrial detainees charged with violating Health and Safety Code \n3  Section 11550 have resulted in the discovery of concealed drugs or contraband or prevented injury \n4  to the detainees.  Therefore, Defendants have not established that the policy of conducting visual \n5  unclothed body cavity searches of pretrial detainees charged with violating Health and Safety Code \n6  Section 11550 effectively promotes the stated justification for the search.4 \n7  The present case is analogous a Tenth Circuit case, Foote v. Spiegel, 118 FJd 1416 (10th \n8  Cir. 1997).  In Foote, a highway patrol officer arrested Foote for being under the influence of \n9  marijuana. A search of Foote's vehicle and a thorough pat-down search of Foote's person disclosed \n10  no drugs.  In addition, Foote did not engage in any behavior consistent with an attempt to hide \n11  something beneath her clothing.  Foote was booked at the County Jail and strip searched, which \n12  revealed no drugs. Foote was never placed in the general jail population and was released on bond \n13  shortly after her confinement.  The Tenth Circuit held as follows: \n14  [B]ecause Foote had no opportunity to hide anything beneath her clothing after [the \nhighway patrol officer] had stopped her vehicle and a thorough pat-down search at \n15  the jail had revealed no drugs, the strip search could be justified only if it were \n16 \n17  The Court notes the concerns expressed by the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit that courts not \n...  .  ..  .  for those ofthe jails' administrators.  See Giles, \n18  46 F.2d at 617 (citing Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 584-85, 104 S.Ct. 3227, 3232 (1984ยป. \nhe deference accorded j ail administrators does not exempt Defendants from showing that the jail's \n19  'nterests warrant the level of intrusion caused by their policy.  See Giles, 746 F.2d at 617 (holding \n20  hat the policy of strip searching all persons booked into the jail was unconstitutional because the \nounty had not demonstrated that its security interests warranted \"serious invasion of privacy \n21  nflicted by its policy\").  Although in Giles the Ninth Circuit required that the County make such a \nhowing, in Thompson v. City ofL os Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir. 1989), the Ninth Circuit \n22  id not.  See Thompson, 885 F.2d at 1447 (holding, without considering the effectiveness of the \n23  earch, that the offense of grand theft auto is \"sufficiently associated with violence to justify a visual \ntrip search\"). The two cases are distinguishable, however, in that in Giles, the pretrial detainee was \n24  ot placed within the general jail population whereas in Thompson, the pretrial detainee was placed \nithin the general jail population.  This suggests that jail administrators are afforded greater \n2S  eference when a pretrial detainee is intermingled with the general jail population than when a \n26  retrial detainee is not placed within the general jail population, however greater deference will not \ne afforded absent a showing that such intermingling was unavoidable. See Giles, 746 F.2d 618-19 \n27  stating that heavy reliance on the intermingling of temporary detainees with the general jail \n0pulation was misplaced because such intermingling was \"limited and avoidable\") (internal \n28  uotations omitted). \n-9-\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 55      Filed 07/22/2002     Page 10 of 12\n1  reasonable to believe persons driving while Wlder the influence of marijuana, who \nhave no particular reason to expect they will be searched, routinely carry a personal \n2  stash in a body cavity.  That belief is unreasonable. \n3  Foote, 118 FJd at 1426 (distinguishing cases in which possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia \n4  provided reasonable suspicion for strip search). \n5  Similarly, the facts before the Court in the instant case indicate that Officer Ortiz arrested \n6  Plaintiff for being under the influence of a controlled substance.  Deputy Hanson conducted a pat-\n7  down search of Plaintiff, during which Deputy Hanson did not see or feel anything that would lead \n8  her to believe that the Plaintiff was concealing drugs or weapons on her person or in her body \n9  cavities.  There is no evidence that Plaintiff engaged in any behavior consistent with an attempt to \n10  hide  something beneath her clothing, and Defendants do  not contend that Plaintiff had any \nII  opporlWlity to hide drugs from the time she was stopped by Officer Ortiz Wltil the time she \n12  underwent the visual unclothed body cavity search.  As part of the booking process of Plaint iff at \n13  the pretrial detention facility, Deputy Hanson conducted a visual unclothed body cavity search of \n14  Plaintiff, which revealed no contraband, weapons, or drugs. There is no evidence that Plaintiffwas \n15  ever placed in the general jail popUlation.  Plaintiff was released on bond approximately five to \ns \n16  eight hours after her arrival at the pretrial detention center. Thus, the Court finds that under these \n17  circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe that a person under the influence of a controlled \n1 \n18  substance in violation ofH  ealth and Safety Code Section 11550 \"routinelycarr[ies a personal stash \n19  in a body cavity.\"  The Court holds that the visual Wlclothed body cavity search of Plaintiff was \n20  Wlconstitutional. \n21  In evaluating the necessity of a strip search, courts have consistently recognized a distinction \n22  between detainees awaiting bail and those entering the jail popUlation.  Fuller, 950 F.2d at 1448; \n23  see also Cottrell v. Kaysville City, 994 F.2d 730, 735 (10th Cir. 1993) (\"We agree that the security \n24  concerns inherent in a bail situation are very different from those present when the detainee will \n25  enter the jail for a greaterlength of time.\"); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981) \n26 \n27  Plaintiff s counselrepresented to the Court at the hearing that Plainti ff was released five to six hours \nfter her arrival.  Defendants' counsel represented to the Court at the hearing that Plaintiff was \n28  eleased eight hours and ten minutes after her arrival. \n- 10-\n\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 55      Filed 07/22/2002     Page 11 of 12\n1  (considering fact that detainee would not be intermingled with the jail population as one of many \n2  factors in determining that strip search was not justified).  in this case, counsel for Plaintiff and \n3  Defendants represented to the Court at the hearing that Plaintiff posted bail, and there is no evidence \n4  that she was housed with the general j ail population. Therefore, the Court expresses no opinion on \n5  the constitutionality of a visual unclothed body cavity search of an arrestee charged with violating \n6  Health and Safety Code Section 11550 who is searched prior to entering the general jail population. \n7  The Court rejects Plaintiffs contention that the reasonable suspicion determination must \n8  always be made on a \"case-by-case\" basis.  In Kennedy, the Ninth Circuit stated that in certain \n9  instances, \"the charge itself may give rise to reasonable suspicion.\"  Kennedy, 901 F.2d at 716 \n10  (citing Thompson v. City olLos Angeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1447 (9th Cir. 1989), which held that the \n11  offense of grand theft auto is sufficiently violent to authorize a blanket strip search policy applicable \n12  to arrestees charged with it who are to be intermingled with the general jail population). \n13  2.  California Penal Code Section 4030 \n14  Plaintiff argues that \"the visual unclothed body cavity search of Plaintiff was not in \n15  accordance with California Penal Code Section 4030.\"  Plaintiff argues that the California Penal \n16  Code Section 4030 requires that misdemeanor arrestees must be given a minimum ofthree hours \n17  to post bail before being placed in the general jail population.  California Penal Code Section \n18  4030(g) exempts from this requirement arrestees who have been charged with offenses involving \n19  controlled substances. Further, there is no evidence before the Court that Plaintiff was ever placed \n20  into the general j ail popUlation.  Accordingly, there is no evidence before the Court from which it \n21  could conclude that California Penal Code Section 4030 was violated. \n22  CONCLUSION \n23  Based on the foregoing, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED, and \n24  Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is GRANTED IN PART.  The Court finds that \n25  the search of Plaintiff was conducted pursuant to the County's strip search policy, that the search \n26  III \n27  III \n28  III \n- 11 -\n\n--------- -----------------\nCase 2:01-cv-05401-CBM-E     Document 55      Filed 07/22/2002     Page 12 of 12\n1  constitutes a violation of Plaintiffs Fourth Amendment rights, and that the Defendants are liable \n2  for damages proximately caused by the search.

Wisotsky and Jeffrey Held, Law Offices of Alan E. Wisotsky, Oxnard, California, for the defendants-\nappellants.\nEarnest C.S. Bell, Ventura, California, for the plaintiff-appellee.\nBefore: J. Clifford WALLACE, RYMER, Pamela Ann Rymer, and Richard C. TALLMAN, Circuit Judges.\n[*]\nSubmitted October 9, 2003.  Pasadena, California.\nOPINION\nWALLACE, Senior Circuit Judge:\nRobert Brooks, Karen Hanson, and County of Ventura (together, County) appeal from an order (Order) denying\ntheir motion for summary judgment and granting in part Noelle Way's motion for partial summary judgment.\nBecause we lack appellate jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.\n810 *810 Subject to certain exceptions not relevant here, we have jurisdiction only to hear appeals from \"final\ndecisions of the district courts.\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291. An order is final under section 1291 \"if it (1) is a full\nadjudication of the issues, and (2) clearly evidences the judge's intention that it be the court's final act in the\nmatter.\" United States v. Lummi Indian Tribe, 235 F.3d 443, 448 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). The Order here falls short of this standard. By inviting the County at the end of the Order to\n\"file motions addressing whether they are entitled to qualified immunity,\" the district court's intention clearly was \nnot that the Order \"be the court's final act in the matter,\" but rather that the court would entertain additional\narguments. See Nat'l Distrib. Agency v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 117 F.3d 432, 434 (9th Cir.1997) (\"A district\ncourt ruling is not final if the court reserves the option of further modifying its ruling.\").\nThe County argues that we nonetheless have jurisdiction to hear \"immediate interlocutory appeals from district\ncourt decisions adjudicating any of the [two] qualified immunity component inquiries.\" The Supreme Court's\nanalysis in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), requires us to address\nqualified immunity defenses as follows: \"the first inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would have been\nviolated on the facts alleged; second, assuming the violation is established, the question whether the right was\nclearly established must be considered on a more specific level.\" Id. at 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151. In this case, the\ndistrict court decided the first inquiry, and the County seeks to appeal this ruling before the second is reached.\nBy not considering the second inquiry in Saucier's analysis, however, the district court did not arrive at a final,\nappealable decision on the County's qualified immunity. It is well-settled that \"a district court's denial of a claim of\nqualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law, is an appealable `final decision' within the\nmeaning of 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.\" Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511,\n530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). It is likewise beyond dispute that multiple appeals are possible in\ncertain circumstances: \"Mitchell clearly establishes that an order rejecting the defense of qualified immunity at \neither the dismissal stage or the summary judgment stage is a `final' judgment subject to immediate appeal.\" \n\nBehrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 307, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). It is decidedly not true, however,\nthat we can exercise appellate jurisdiction midway through the qualified immunity analysis, before the district\ncourt makes a complete, final ruling on the issue. The County has not cited, nor are we able to find, any authority\nproviding for appellate jurisdiction in this situation.\nThe County seeks to support its novel proposition by focusing on the rationale underlying Saucier's direction that\ncourts conduct the required inquiry in sequence: the court's answer to the first inquiry, if it does not relieve the\nCounty of the pending lawsuit immediately, at least serves the important function of clarifying the implicated\nconstitutional right and thus informing law enforcement conduct going forward. See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201, 121\nS.Ct. 2151. It is hard to see, though, how this objective would be materially advanced by the multiple appeals\nadvocated by the County. After all, in deciding the first Saucier inquiry (i.e., whether a constitutional right was\nviolated), the district court has gathered all the legal materials necessary to decide the second: whether the law\n811 affording that right was \"clearly *811 established.\" See id. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151 (\"In the course of determining\nwhether a constitutional right was violated on the premises alleged, a court might find it necessary to set forth\nprinciples which will become the basis for a holding that a right is clearly established.\"). The minimal amount of\nadditional time needed to conduct the second inquiry deprives neither the County of a swift end to a lawsuit from\nwhich it may be immune nor law enforcement of timely judicial guidance on constitutional rights. In fact, multiple\ninterlocutory appeals might only prolong the County's exposure to unmeritorious litigation.\nIn its response to an order to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the\nCounty also invoked the \"Gillespie doctrine,\" referring to what we derived from Gillespie v. United States Steel\nCorp., 379 U.S. 148, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964), and have come to call the \"practical finality\" or\n\"pragmatic finality\" doctrine. To fit under this \"very narrow exception to the final judgment rule\" and thereby qualify\nto appeal a partial summary judgment, the County must satisfy four factors:\n(1) the case was a marginally final order, (2) disposed of an unsettled issue of national\nsignificance, (3) review implemented the same policy Congress sought to promote in ยง 1292(b),\nand (4) the finality issue was not presented to the appellate court until argument on the merits,\nthereby ensuring that policies of judicial economy would not be served by remanding the case with\nan important unresolved issue.\nWilliamson v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., 160 F.3d 1247, 1250 (9th Cir.1998); see also In re Subpoena Served on\nCal. Pub. Utils. Comm'n, 813 F.2d 1473, 1479 (9th Cir.1987) (cautioning that the doctrine \"must be sparingly\nused\"), citing Gillespie, 379 U.S. at 152-53, 85 S.Ct. 308. The County does not make it past the first criterion:\nleaving half of the qualified immunity inquiry pending is hardly \"marginal.\" Cf. Wabol v. Villacrusis, 958 F.2d 1450,\n1454 (9th Cir.1990), (\"The challenged order is `marginally final' because the pending proceedings have little\nsubstance and will not affect the potentially dispositive and obviously central issue....\").\nAppeal DISMISSED.\n[*] This panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument.
