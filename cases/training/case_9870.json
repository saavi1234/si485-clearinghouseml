    "summary": "<p>Plaintiffs filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action against the City of Rochester in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, Rochester Division. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked for damages for the violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. Specifically, they alleged that the blanket strip-search policy of the Monroe County Jail was unconstitutional. </p><p>On June 18, 1983, plaintiffs attended their daughter's wedding and hosted a party at their house afterwards.  At approximately 3 A.M., the plaintiffs' son left the house with a friend to buy cigarettes. The two were assualted by a man with a baseball bet. Thye were not injured, but the car was badly damaged. They returned to the house, and Plaintiffs called the police. When help did not arrive, they called again, this time, claiming there had been a shooting, as they were informed by the dispatcher that only a shooting would resuly in an emergency response. The plaintiffs were arrested for filing a false report and resisting arrest, and taken to Monroe County Jail. Once there, because the holding cells were overfilled, one plaintiff was brought into the area for pretrial detainees.  Once there, she was strip and cavity searched. The plaintiffs were acquitted of all charges.</p><p>On March 11, 1986, the Court (Judge Michael A. Telesca) granted summary judgment in favor of the county and defendants, finding that the blanket strip search policy satisfied reasonable suspicion. (630 F.Supp. 255) Plaintiffs appealed.</p><p>On November 6, 1986 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Judge Mahoney, Judge Meskill, Judge Oakes) issued an opinion written by Judge Mahoney (804 F.2d 796). The Court found that the blanket search policy did not satisfy reasonable suspicion, and that the Sheriff and County were not entitled to qualified immunity. The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and ordered judgment for the Plaintiffs on the question of the Sheriff and County's liability. </p><p>We have no further information on the case.</p><p></p>",

Counsel for the City of\nRochester (Michele DiGaetano, Asst. Corp. Counsel, of counsel), Rochester, N.Y., for defendants.\nDECISION and ORDER\nTELESCA, District Judge.\nThis is an action brought by plaintiffs against the City of Rochester, several of its police officers and one of its\npolice dispatchers, for injuries arising out of their arrest. Plaintiffs also seek damages from the County of Monroe\nand its Sheriff, Andrew Meloni for the alleged violation of plaintiff Ann Weber's constitutional rights as a result of\nher being forced to undergo an illegal strip search and body cavity search at the Monroe County Jail on June 19,\n1983. Pending before me are motions by the County and the Sheriff for summary judgment, and a cross-motion\nby the plaintiffs for partial summary judgment against those defendants. I hold that the plaintiffs' constitutional\nrights were not violated by the County or the Sheriff as claimed, and therefore grant the County's and the Sheriff's\nmotions for summary judgment and deny the plaintiffs' cross-motion for partial summary judgment.\nFACTS\nFor purposes of this motion, I rely upon the following limited description of the facts of the case which are\ngleaned from the papers and affidavits supplied by the parties. The City of Rochester chose not to participate in\nthese motions presumably because they dealt only with defendants County of Monroe and Sheriff Meloni.\nOn June 18, 1983 Ann Weber was arrested for charges of resisting arrest and for making a false report of a\nshooting. Her husband Gary Weber was arrested at the same time and charged with obstruction of governmental\n[1]\nadministration.\nThe alleged false report was made in order to induce the police to answer a call for assistance when a previous\ncall reporting an episode of malicious mischief went unanswered. For the purposes of this motion it is relevant to\npoint out only that Mrs. Weber was taken by the police at approximately 3:00 A.M. to the Monroe County lockup\nwhere she was placed in a holding cell, then booked.\nEarlier that evening Ann Weber's daughter, Marilyn Mogenhan had been married in the City of Rochester. When\nplaced in the lockup, Mrs. Weber was still wearing the formal wedding attire she had worn to her daughter's\nwedding earlier that evening. After she was booked, she was not taken back to the holding cell where arrestees\nawaiting bail are normally kept. Instead, apparently because the holding area was full, she was taken to a cell in\nan area of the Monroe County Jail where arraigned pre-trial detainees are housed.\n257\n\n*257 A jail matron then ordered Mrs. Weber to remove all of her clothing. After she did so, she was ordered to\nalternately face toward and away from the female jailer and bend at the waist. While bending, she was ordered to\n\"spread her cheeks\" while the jailer visually inspected her rectal and vaginal areas. After this search, she was\nplaced in a cell for less than 30 minutes until her daughter arrived to post bail. Prior to this episode, she had\nnever been arrested.\nAfter Mr. Weber was booked he was taken to a hospital where he was treated for wounds to his face.\nThe strip search of Mrs. Weber had been conducted pursuant to a County Jail policy under which any arrestee\nplaced in the County Jail (other than those in the holding area) was strip searched and body cavity searched. The\nCounty and the Sheriff claim that this blanket strip/cavity search policy was required by 9 NYCRR § 7502.1(a),\nwhich states that, \"Before being placed in a cell or detention room, the clothing and person of each prisoner shall\nbe thoroughly searched.\" At oral argument, the County attorney conceded that the phrase \"thoroughly searched\"\ndid not necessarily require a strip/cavity search, but that the County Sheriff had interpreted the regulation in that\nmanner, as had other jail administrators in the State.\nPlaintiff originally instituted this action against Elizabeth Dell, the City, the police officers, and Monroe County.\nAfter the County moved for summary judgment, in part because New York Constitution Article XIII, § 13 forbids\nimposing liability upon the County for the acts of the Sheriff (see Barr v. County of Albany, 50 N.Y.2d 247, 428\nN.Y.S.2d 665, 406 N.E.2d 481 (1980)), plaintiffs moved for leave to add the County Sheriff as a defendant, which\nleave was granted. The County has renewed its motion for summary judgment based on Article XIII, and also\nargues that the strip search policy was constitutional, and that (if the policy was not constitutional) the County is\nnevertheless immune from damage liability because the Sheriff adopted the policy in good faith reliance upon \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). The Sheriff has also moved for summary\njudgment, raising the same arguments raised by the County (except Article XIII). Plaintiffs have cross-moved for\npartial summary judgment against the County and the Sheriff, relying on cases from several circuit courts of\nappeals holding that a blanket strip search policy is unconstitutional.\nAs set forth below, I hold that the strip search policy implemented by the Sheriff is constitutional under the\nauthority of Bell v. Wolfish and its progeny, and I grant summary judgment to the County and the Sheriff on that\nauthority.\nDISCUSSION\nThe plaintiffs in Bell v. Wolfish challenged numerous conditions of their confinement at the pre-trial detention\nfacility in New York City and various policies and practices of that institution. The Supreme Court sustained\nagainst a Fourth Amendment challenge the practice of conducting routine body cavity searches of these pretrial\ndetainees following contact visits, even though there had been only one reported attempt to smuggle contraband\ninto the facility in a body cavity. 441 U.S. at 558-60, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85. Although the Court admitted that the\npractice of conducting these searches \"instinctively [gave it] the most pause,\" id., it balanced this against the\nprison's interest in maintaining security, and concluded that this practice did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\nThe balancing test it applied is worth quoting at length:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\n258 place in which it is conducted. A detention *258 facility is a unique place fraught with serious\nsecurity dangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common\nan occurrence. And inmate attempts to secrete these items into the facility by concealing them in\nbody cavities are documented in this record, and in other cases. That there has been only one\ninstance where an MCC inmate was discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the\ninstitution on his person may be more a testament to the effectiveness of this search technique as\na deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmates to secrete and import such items\nwhen the opportunity arises.\n\n441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85 (citations omitted).\nThe Court stated specifically that probable cause was not required before a body cavity search could be\nconducted on these inmates. 441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. The Court also stated that the existence of less\nintrusive and equally effective alternatives to body cavity inspections did not render such inspections\nunconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, as long as the alternative chosen by the prison administrators was\nnot irrational or unreasonable. 441 U.S. 559, n. 40, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85, n. 40.\nThe Court added a gloss to Bell v. Wolfish in the 1984 case of Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 104 S.Ct. 3227,\n82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984). Block was a Fourteenth Amendment case rather than a Fourth Amendment case,\nbecause in Block the prison administrators had chosen to ban contact visits entirely, rather than conduct any\nsearches of inmates returning from contact visits. In Block, the Court again emphasized that it was unwilling to\nsubstitute its judgment on the difficult and sensitive matters of institutional administration and security for that of\nthe persons who were actually charged with and trained in the running of such facilities. 104 S.Ct. at 3233. It took\njudicial notice that the unauthorized use of narcotics is a problem that plagues virtually every penal and detention\ncenter in the country, then reversed the District Court's decision holding that a limited program of contact visits\nwas constitutionally required:\nOn this record, we must conclude that the District Court simply misperceived the limited scope of\njudicial inquiry under Wolfish. When the District Court found that many factors counseled against\ncontact visits, its inquiry should have ended. The Court's further \"balancing\" resulted in an\nimpermissible substitution of its view on the proper administration of Central Jail for that of the\nexperienced administrators of that facility. Here, as in Wolfish, \"[i]t is plain from [the] opinions that\nthe lower court simply disagreed with the judgment of [the jail] officials about the extent of the\nsecurity interests affected and the means required to further those interests.\" 441 U.S., at 554, 99\nS.Ct., at 1882.\n104 S.Ct. 3234.\nRegardless of my personal feelings concerning the strip search and cavity search performed in this case and the\npolicy established which led up to that search, I am compelled to follow the direction announced by the Supreme\nCourt in deferring to the judgment of those entrusted with administering the jail, in this case the Sheriff of Monroe\nCounty. The Supreme Court has very recently reaffirmed that policy of deference to the decisions of prison\nadministrators on security matters in Whitley v. Albers, ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). The\nmessage from the Supreme Court is clear: a district court should not substitute its view on the proper\nadministration of a jail \"... for that of the experienced administrators of that facility\" simply because the Court may\ndisagree with the \"judgment of [the jail] officials ...\". Block v. Rutherford, supra, 104 S.Ct. at 3234.\nPlaintiffs rely on a host of cases from circuit courts other than the Second Circuit (most of which predated Block v.\n259 Rutherford), in which the balancing test of Bell v. Wolfish was applied, and in which the circuit *259 courts\nconcluded that blanket strip/body cavity searches of all pre-trial detainees were unreasonable. Tinetti v. Wittke,\n479 F.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wisc.1979),affd.,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980); Tikalsky v. City of Chicago, 687 F.2d 175\n(7th Cir. 1982); Logan v.

Lubbock County v.\nStewart, ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 1378, 89 L.Ed.2d 604 (1986); Levka v. City of Chicago, 748 F.2d 421 (7th\nCir.1984); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir.1984); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir.1984),cert.\ndenied,___ U.S. ___, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985); and Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir.1985)\n; see also Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084, 1088 (6th Cir.1983).\nIn all of these cases, the circuit courts refused to condone strip/body cavity searches of all arrestees entering a\njail. These courts refused to allow searches of misdemeanants (or even felony offenders) unless there was\n\"reasonable suspicion\" or other circumstances (such as the nature of the crime with which the arrestee had been\ncharged) which would lead a reasonable prison administrator to suspect that the particular arrestee might be\nconcealing contraband in a body cavity.\n\nAfter Bell and Block I cannot adopt the reasoning of these circuit courts. Instead, I am led to the inescapable\nconclusion that, once a person becomes a prison inmate, he or she loses any Fourth Amendment protection from\nstrip/body cavity searches if prison administrators have reasonable grounds for concluding that the inmate is in a\nposition to be carrying contraband. In this case, County Sheriff Meloni testified that it was his experience and that\nof his deputies that approximately 70% of the arrestees who are strip-searched prior to admission to the County\nJail are carrying material that is classified as contraband, either on their clothing or on their persons. Although the\nSheriff's figures were only rough estimates, and did not differentiate between items found in the clothing and\nitems found in body cavities, his figures are sufficient to indicate that there is a considerable problem with\narrestees carrying contraband. Moreover, in the experience of other courts, see, e.g., Bell v. Wolfish, supra, 441\nU.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85; Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, supra, 723 F.2d at 1272-73, there is indeed a\nproblem with at least some arrestees concealing contraband in body cavities. Given that assumption, I cannot,\nafter Block v. Rutherford, substitute my view on the proper administration of the County Jail for that of Sheriff\nMeloni.\nAlthough the balancing test in Bell v. Wolfish used words such as \"each case,\" \"particular search,\" and \"particular\nintrusion,\" the Court evidently was not so much concerned with each individual's search as with the prison's\npolicy of searching a given group of inmates (in that case, inmates returning from contact visits). This emphasis is\neven more evident in Block v. Rutherford, in which the Court refused to require prison administrators to\ndifferentiate among candidates for contact visitation, identifying those inmates with propensities for violence,\n[2]\nescape or drug smuggling.  I read these cases as holding that, once I have determined that the Sheriff has\nproperly concluded that a given group of inmates (here recent arrestees) poses a threat of smuggling\n260 contraband, I must determine that he is justified in searching any individual member of that group, *260 even\n(after Bell v. Wolfish) through means as intrusive as a visual body cavity search.\nThis reading of the cases is supported by Justice Rehnquist, the author of the Bell v. Wolfish majority decision, in\nhis decision temporarily restraining the Fourth Circuit from enforcing its Logan v. Shealy decision, supra. In \nClements v. Logan, 454 U.S. 1304, 102 S.Ct. 284, 70 L.Ed.2d 461 (1981), Justice Rehnquist described the\nFourth Circuit's decision as \"so at odds with this Court's resolution of a similar issue in Bell v. Wolfish\" that the\nextraordinary remedy of a temporary stay should be granted, even though a request for the same stay had\nalready been denied by Chief Justice Burger. 454 U.S. at 1308-09, 102 S.Ct. at 287. Justice Rehnquist stated\nthat the position of Ms. Logan (who was awaiting release after having been arrested for driving while intoxicated)\nwas no different, for constitutional purposes, from that of the pretrial detainees in Bell v. Wolfish. 454 U.S. at\n[3]\n1309, 102 S.Ct. at 287-88.  More importantly, he also stated that the result in Bell v. Wolfish was not predicated\non a showing that searches were limited to those individuals whose alleged offenses were commonly associated\n[4]\nby their very nature with the possession of weapons or contraband. 454 U.S. at 1310, 102 S.Ct. at 288.\nThis view is also supported to some extent by the Second Circuit's holding in Security and Law Enforcement\nEmployees, District Council 82 v. Carey, 737 F.2d 187 (2d Cir.1984). In upholding strip-searches of corrections\nofficers in that case, the Second Circuit held that the individualized \"reasonable suspicion\" standard applied by\nthe other circuits to strip/body cavity searches of inmates should govern strip searches of corrections officers\nworking in correctional facilities. Id. at 204. The Second Circuit analogized the Fourth Amendment rights of\ncorrection officers to those of visitors to penal institutions, as recognized in Hunter v. Auger, 672 F.2d 668 (8th\nCir.1982). See also, Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556 (1st Cir.1985); Smothers v. Gibson, 778 F.2d 470 (8th\nCir.1985). The Second Circuit noted that corrections officers as unincarcerated persons should possess higher\nexpectations of privacy than incarcerated individuals, 737 F.2d at 201; see also, Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517,\n104 S.Ct. 3194, 3198-3202, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), and Blackburn v. Snow, supra, 771 F.2d at 563, implying that\nincarcerated individuals are not entitled to the protection of a \"reasonable suspicion\" standard (at least\n[5]\nindividually, rather than as a group).\n261 *261 Mrs. Weber argues that she should not be treated like the pre-trial detainees in Bell and Block because she\nwas an arrestee who had not even been arraigned. She argues that arrestees such as she do not ordinarily plan\ntheir daily lives with the expectation of being arrested, and thus are far less likely to have concealed contraband\nin a bodily cavity than are those already detained persons who have just been able to visit with someone from\n\noutside the walls. See Giles v. Ackerman, supra, 746 F.2d at 617. She argues that a woman such as she, clad in\nan evening dress from her daughter's wedding and arrested on unjustified charges of resisting arrest, can never\nbe reasonably expected to have concealed contraband in a bodily cavity. See Dufrin v. Spreen, supra, 712 F.2d\nat 1088.\nThe fact remains, however, that experience shows that there are arrestees who conceal contraband in body\ncavities and once inside the jail, these inmates pose a threat to security. A blanket strip/body cavity search\nprogram is an unquestionably effective way of stemming this flow of contraband. Despite my belief that less\nintrusive measures could be equally effective, I am precluded from substituting my judgment for that of Sheriff\nMeloni. Bell v. Wolfish, supra, 441 U.S. at 559, n. 40, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85, n. 40; Block v. Rutherford, supra.\nI note once again that all arrestees are not ordinarily searched in this manner. It appears from the record that\narrestees for whom release on bail is imminent are ordinarily returned to the holding cell, after having been only\npat-down searched before their initial admission to the holding cell. (Meloni Deposition at 24-25; Craven\nDeposition at 16-18.) Only if an arrestee cannot make bail immediately and cannot be returned to the holding cell\nfor some reason (such as overcrowding) is she placed in a cell near the already-arraigned inmates and thus strip-\nsearched in the interest of jail security. If this were not the case, I cannot say that my holding would be the same.\nCONCLUSION\nThis holding should not be construed to give free license to implement a strip search/cavity search policy with no\nconcerns for the Fourth Amendment rights of arrestees. Indeed, jail administrators should always be sensitive to\nthe highly intrusive and demeaning nature of the strip search/body cavity search, and should keep in mind that\nnothing in the established law prohibits the exercise of discretion and restraint. Because of the deference given to\nprison administrators in this area, they have a greater obligation to be particularly sensitive to exercising\ndiscretion and restraint. Even in the context of preventing the introduction of contraband into the general prison\npopulation, the jail personnel in applying the rule should be made to be especially aware of the tremendous\npotential for arbitrary or invidious infliction of unnecessary intrusions into a person's privacy and the ultimate\n[6]\neffect it can have on his or her dignity.\nAccordingly, summary judgment is granted to defendants County of Monroe and Monroe County Sheriff Andrew\nP. Meloni, dismissing the complaint against them, and plaintiffs' cross-motion for partial summary judgment is\ndenied.\nALL OF THE ABOVE IS SO ORDERED.\n[1] Both plaintiffs were later acquitted of all charges after trial in Rochester City Court.\n[2] This same distinction (between inmates as a group, instead of individually) is also noted by the First Circuit in\nits interpretation of Bell v. Wolfish. See Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 564-65 (1985). \nThe First Circuit, in dicta, indicates that it considers arrestees merely awaiting bail to have the same Fourth\nAmendment rights as prison guards, jail visitors, and other unincarcerated persons. Id., at 565. As is evident from\nmy decision, I disagree, at least when the arrested person must be housed in a cell near other inmates.\n[3] The opinion of the Fourth Circuit indicates that, unlike Mrs. Weber, Ms. Logan had already been ordered\nreleased on her own recognizance by a Magistrate, and was only prevented from leaving the police station by a\npolicy of holding D.W.I. arrestees for four hours to ensure their sobriety. She was not being kept in a jail cell near\nother inmates; she was strip-searched only when she went into the jail to use the only available telephone to\nhave someone pick her up. Although other courts consider it irrelevant whether an arrestee was housed with\nprison inmates, see Giles v. Ackerman, supra, 746 F.2d at 618-19; Hill v. Bogans, supra, 735 F.2d at 394; Smith v.\nMontgomery County, 547 F.Supp. 592, 598-99 (D.Md.1982), I do not. If an arrestee need not come in contact with\njail inmates, it undermines the \"prison security\" justification for any strip searches of that arrestee. Sheriff Meloni\nhas implicitly recognized this. Arrestees awaiting immediate release on bail are ordinarily placed in a holding cell\n\naway from jail inmates, and are only pat-down searched before being placed in that holding cell because they will\nnot come in contact with jail inmates.\n[4] Justice Rehnquist's temporary stay was vacated two days later, 454 U.S. 1117, 102 S.Ct. 961, 71 L.Ed.2d 105\n(1981), and certiorari was ultimately denied, 454 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982). The denial of\ncertiorari has no binding precedential effect, United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, 263 F.2d 71 (5th Cir. 1959),\ncert. denied,361 U.S. 838, 80 S.Ct. 58, 4 L.Ed.2d 78 (1959), and certainly the opinion of only one Supreme\nCourt Justice on an application for stay is not binding precedent. I cite his opinion only to emphasize his\ninterpretation of his Bell v. Wolfish decision.\n[5] The Second Circuit did differentiate between mere strip searches and visual body cavity searches, holding\nthat corrections officers could not be forced to undergo the latter in the absence of probable cause. The Second\nCircuit based this distinction in part upon the greater intrusiveness of visual body cavity searches, and in part on\nthe testimony of prison administrators that contraband had never been discovered in the anal or genital areas of\ncorrections officers. 737 F.2d at 207-08. By contrast, prison officials in this case have stated that arrestees do\nsmuggle contraband in body cavities, and for that reason the Supreme Court has upheld visual body cavity\nsearches of inmates, in Bell v. Wolfish.\nThe Second Circuit also applied the \"reasonable suspicion\" standard to strip searches conducted at this country's\nborders. United States v. Ogberaha, 771 F.2d 655 (2d Cir.1985).\n[6] I share the conclusions expressed in Security and Law Enforcement Employees, District Council 82 v. Carey,\n737 F.2d 187 (2d Cir.1984), that the visual body cavity search represents one of the most grievous offenses\nagainst personal dignity and common decency, and is \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating,\nterrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission....\" Id. at 207, quoting \nTinetti v.

Plaintiff\n798 Ann Weber, who was subjected to such a search after her arrest on misdemeanor charges, and her *798\nhusband Gary Weber, who assertedly suffered personal injuries arising from his arrest on the same occasion,\nbrought this action alleging state and federal claims against the City of Rochester, the County of Monroe (the\n\"County\"), several Rochester police officers, an employee of the Rochester Police Department, and the Monroe\n[1]\nCounty Sheriff (the \"Sheriff\"). We consider  plaintiffs' appeal from the denial of their motion for partial summary\njudgment on the issue of the liability of the County and the Sheriff under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the search of Ann\nWeber, the dismissal of the complaint as to those defendants, and the grant of summary judgment in their favor.\nBecause we conclude that the search violated Mrs. Weber's rights under the Fourth Amendment, we reverse the\ndistrict court's decision and direct the entry of partial summary judgment in favor of appellant Ann Weber as to the\n[2]\nliability of the County and the Sheriff under section 1983 for the challenged strip/body cavity search.\nBACKGROUND\nThe following rendition of the facts has been gleaned from the complaint, affidavits submitted below and\ntranscripts of depositions conducted below, and may contain factual matters in dispute between the parties to this\n[3]\nlitigation.  No such matters preclude our summary disposition of the issues before us, however, since the\nCounty and the Sheriff concede that pursuant to jail policy a jail employee undertook a strip/body cavity search of\nMrs. Weber after her arrest on misdemeanor charges in the absence of any ground other than her status as an\narrested person for concluding that she was likely to be concealing contraband. The remainder of this strange\nstory we include by way of background.\n\nOn June 18, 1983, Ann and Gary Weber attended their daughter's wedding and reception, then hosted a party for\nsome of the wedding guests in their home. The night of celebration must have lost some of its savor for the\nWebers even before any of the defendants appeared on the scene; in quest of cigarettes, in the early morning\nhours, the Webers' son left the party with a friend and was assaulted by a man wielding a baseball bat outside an\nall-night variety store. The son and his friend escaped bodily injury by repairing to their car, but they returned to\nthe Webers' home with a battered vehicle, the assailant having smashed it repeatedly with the bat as they drove\naway. Upon being apprised by her son of the assault, Mrs. Weber called the Rochester Police Department and\nreported the incident to a dispatcher.\nShortly thereafter, the Webers' son left with several other family members and guests to seek out his assailant.\nApproximately half an hour after she made the first report, Mrs. Weber called the Police Department a second\ntime and asked what she needed to do to procure police assistance. The dispatcher who spoke with Mrs. Weber\nalready knew about the incident, since she had taken the first call as well and had reported the attack as an\n799 episode of \"malicious mischief.\" She allegedly told *799 Mrs. Weber that emergency police assistance would\narrive only if Mrs. Weber were to report a shooting. Mrs. Weber 00 in an agitated state, we suppose 00 complied.\n97 97\nThe dispatcher then informed the police that Mrs. Weber had reported a shooting, but that it was probably a false\nand illegal report.\nThe police then began to arrive at the Webers' home. According to the plaintiffs, the police placed Mrs. Weber\nunder arrest for a false report, whereupon she retreated into her home with the police in hot pursuit. Mr. Weber\nexchanged words with the officers, still more officers arrived, and all entered the Webers' home over Mr. Weber's\nprotest. Mr. Weber was placed in a police car after suffering injuries, he alleges, at the hands of the officers.\nThere ensued some movement of officers and Webers throughout the Weber home. The Webers claimed later\nthat the officers had beat them without provocation; the officers claimed that the Webers had resisted arrest. In\neither event, the officers eventually carried Mrs. Weber out of her house and transported her, still protesting, still\ndressed in formal wedding attire, now encumbered with handcuffs, to the Monroe County Jail, where they\ncharged her with the misdemeanor offenses of falsely reporting an incident and resisting arrest.\nAfter booking, Mrs. Weber was photographed and fingerprinted, then taken to a vacant cell. There the\noccurrences that gave rise to the issues before us took place. Pursuant to a Monroe County Jail policy providing\nfor strip/body cavity searches of all arrestees, Mrs. Weber was required to remove all her clothing and to expose\nher body cavities for visual inspection. She won her release half an hour later, after her newly wed daughter\narrived at the jail and posted bail. Mr. Weber had meanwhile been charged with obstruction of governmental\nadministration and resisting arrest, then taken to a hospital and treated for wounds to his face.\nAfter trial and acquittal of all charges in Rochester City Court, the Webers brought this action challenging inter\nalia the strip/body cavity search of Mrs. Weber, on the ground that jail employees had performed that search with\nno reasonable suspicion that Mrs. Weber was carrying weapons or other contraband, in violation of her rights\n[4]\nunder the Fourth Amendment.  The County and Sheriff moved for summary judgment. The Webers cross-\nmoved for partial summary judgment against the County and the Sheriff on the issue of their liability under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 for the strip/body cavity search of Mrs. Weber. Not reaching the immunity or state law defenses\nraised by those defendants, the court below granted them summary judgment on the ground that the search of\nMrs. Weber's person and body cavities did not violate her constitutional rights.\nWe reverse.\nDISCUSSION\nI. The Constitutionality of the Search Policy\nAccording to the Sheriff, the jail employees conducted the search of Mrs. Weber pursuant to a Monroe County\nJail policy calling for strip/body cavity searches of all arrested persons other than those placed in \"holding cells,\"\nwhich are the cells in which arrestees are sometimes placed when their release on bail is imminent. In deciding\n\nthat such a policy is constitutional, the district court held that \"once a person becomes a prison inmate, he or she\nloses any Fourth Amendment protection from strip/body cavity searches if prison administrators have reasonable\n800 grounds for concluding that the inmate is *800 in a position to be carrying contraband.\" Weber v. Dell, 630\nF.Supp. 255, 259 (W.D.N.Y.1986). It is not clear to us precisely how one analyzes whether a recently arrested\ninmate is in a position to be carrying contraband, as opposed to the likelihood, under the circumstances attending\nthe arrest, that he or she is in fact carrying it; applying the former standard, in any event, the district court found a\nreasonable ground for subjecting Mrs. Weber to such searches in the Sheriff's \"rough estimates\" that seventy\npercent of all arrestees carry contraband. Id.\nIn setting forth its analysis, the court expressly rejected holdings in other circuits requiring some reasonable\nsuspicion, founded on the characteristics of the particular arrestee or arrest or the nature of the crime with which\nhe or she is charged, to justify such searches. Instead, the court based its own analysis directly on its reading of \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), and Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 104\nS.Ct. 3227, 82 L.Ed.2d 438 (1984). The court decided that Block added a \"gloss\" to Wolfish, and that together the\ncases stand for the proposition that \"a district court should not substitute its view of the proper administration of a\n[5]\njail\" for that of the jail officials. Weber v. Dell, 630 F.Supp. at 258.  We must agree with Mrs. Weber that the\ndistrict court misread Wolfish and read Block far too broadly. We accordingly adopt the reasonable suspicion\nstandard that governs in other circuits, which we think Wolfish suggests and Block leaves undisturbed.\nWe turn, then, to an examination of those cases. In the portion of Bell v. Wolfish that applies directly to the issue\nbefore us, the Supreme Court held that probable cause is not necessary to justify routine strip/body cavity\nsearches of arraigned pre-trial detainees after those inmates have had contact with visitors from outside the\ninstitution. Instead, the \"test of reasonableness\" requires a \"balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.\" Id.,441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1884. In the \nWolfish setting, that test required the balancing of \"the significant and legitimate security interests of the inmates.\"\nId. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. In concluding that the security interests of the prison in undertaking strip/body cavity\nsearches after \"contact\" visits outweighed the privacy interests of the inmates 00 prisoners who had already been\n97\narraigned, had failed to make bail, and had presumably chosen to receive visitors and to enjoy physical contact\nwith them 00 the Court recognized the need for \"mutual accommodation between institutional needs and\n97\nobjectives and the provisions of the Constitution that are of general application.\" Id. at 546, 99 S.Ct. at 1878\n(quoting Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2974, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)). It did not, however,\nread out of the Constitution the provision of general application that a search be justified as reasonable under the\ncircumstances. The imposition of a standard short of probable cause in determining the balance of interests at\nstake in Wolfish in no way dispensed with that requirement.\nNor did Block v. Rutherford free prison officials from all Fourth Amendment constraints. A Fourteenth Amendment\ncase, Block held that pre-trial detainees were not entitled as a matter of substantive due process to receive\ncontact visits or to observe prison officials' searches of their cells. Block indeed emphasized the administrative\nand security needs of prisons and the propriety of deference to prison officials' decisions; it balanced those\nconsiderations, however, not against the interest in avoiding the intrusions of strip searches and body cavity\n801 searches, but against the *801 alleged substantive due process rights to receive visits in prisons unimpeded by\nglass walls and to watch while officials engaged in concededly permissible searches of prison cells. Surely, any\nhypothetical \"privacy\"-type interest at stake in the latter contexts would be of a lower order than the interest in\navoiding strip/body cavity searches. Furthermore, the Block holding expressly applies to detainees 00 \"by\n97\ndefinition persons unable to meet bail,\" many of whom are \"awaiting trial for serious, violent offenses\" and \"have\nprior criminal convictions.\" 468 U.S. at 586, 104 S.Ct. at 3232.\nAn examination of cases from other circuits supports our view that Block and Wolfish do not suggest, much less\nrequire, the result reached here. In finding the search of Mrs. Weber constitutional, the district court below\ndiscounted ten opinions from seven circuits that succeeded Wolfish and \"refused to condone strip/body cavity\n[6]\nsearches of all arrestees entering a jail.\" 630 F.Supp. at 259 (emphasis in original).  All but one of these cases\nheld the particular search at issue unconstitutional. Dufrin v. Spreen, 712 F.2d 1084 (6th Cir.1983), the exception,\nsanctioned the strip/body cavity search of a woman formally charged with a violent felony. Furthermore, four of\n[7]\nthese cases were decided after Block,  and thus presumably took into account the gloss that the district court\n\nhere found Block added to Wolfish. Thus, if there could be any doubt that the balance of interests struck in Block\ndoes not dictate the result the court reached in this case, the law in other circuits shows that it does not. Indeed,\neven before the Supreme Court decided Block, five circuits had agreed that pre-trial detainees are not entitled to\ncontact visits, see Block, 468 U.S. at 582 n. 6, 104 S.Ct. at 3231 n. 6; three of those 00 the Fourth, Seventh and\n97\nTenth Circuits 00 had held that policies permitting routine strip/body cavity searches of arrestees were, in contrast,\n97\nunconstitutional. See supra note 6.\nWe note that at the end of the opinion below, the court seems to narrow its holding, observing that Monroe\nCounty Jail policy appears to subject arrestees to strip/body cavity searches only when the arrestees are unable\nto make bail immediately and, for reasons such as overcrowding, are moved from the holding cells in which they\n802 are initially placed into cells near arraigned inmates. 630 F.Supp. at *802 261. It is not clear from the record that\nthe jail itself so characterizes its policy or that it followed such a policy in searching Mrs. Weber; she stated in her\naffidavit that no one asked her if she could make bail and that the jail was not crowded during her stay. The\npresence of such disputed matters should have precluded the grant of summary judgment in favor of the\ndefendants if the court intended to uphold the policy only as restated and narrowed. Furthermore, the court relied\non incompetent affidavits and facts that would be inadmissible as evidence, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) and 32(a),\nsuch as the Sheriff's assertion that seventy percent of arrestees carry contraband into the jail, a conclusory\nestimate based neither on personal observation nor on an analysis of the jail's records. See Quinn v. Syracuse\nModel Neighborhood Corp., 613 F.2d 438, 445 (2d Cir.1980).\nWe find it unnecessary to remand for findings on those issues, however, because we believe that even the more\nnarrowly drawn policy would be unconstitutional and that the Sheriff's assertion, if substantiated, would still not\nprovide that \"particularized suspicion,\" see United States v. Montoya De Hernandez, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 105\nS.Ct. 3304, 3310, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985), arising either from the nature of the charge or specific circumstances\nrelating to the arrestee and/or the arrest, which the law requires for so intrusive and demeaning an investigative\nprocedure as a strip/body cavity search. See also United States v. Ogberaha, 771 F.2d 655 (2d Cir.1985); cf. \nMary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272-73 (7th Cir.1983) (detailed statistical analysis did not\nestablish justification for blanket strip/body cavity searches of arrested misdemeanants where contraband was\nfound only on women charged with prostitution, narcotics violations, or assault). We hold that the Fourth\nAmendment precludes prison officials from performing strip/body cavity searches of arrestees charged with\nmisdemeanors or other minor offenses unless the officials have a reasonable suspicion that the arrestee is\nconcealing weapons or other contraband based on the crime charged, the particular characteristics of the\narrestee, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\nII. The Liability of the County\nIn light of its disposition of the Fourth Amendment issue, the district court did not reach the question whether the\nCounty could be held liable for a search conducted by Monroe County Jail employees if that search was\nunreasonable. Defendants argue that the County cannot be held liable, citing the Constitution of the State of New\n[8]\nYork, Barr v. County of Albany, 50 N.Y.2d 247, 406 N.E.2d 481, 428 N.Y.S.2d 665 (1980), and Wilson v.\nSponable, 81 A.D.2d 1, 439 N.Y.S.2d 549 (1981).\nThose authorities do not stand for the proposition that a county cannot be held liable for unlawful acts that the\ncounty itself commits when it establishes or implements unlawful policies; rather, they hold that a county is not\nvicariously liable for the tortious acts of a sheriff. Under that interpretation, Barr and Wilson are perfectly\nconsistent with Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), in\nwhich the Supreme Court held that a municipality is a person and can incur section 1983 liability as a\nconsequence of policies it promulgates even though it cannot incur such liability under a respondeat superior\ntheory. In any event, immunity from liability under section 1983 is not a question of state law but of federal law.\n\"`A construction of the federal statute which permitted a state immunity defense to have controlling effect would\ntransmute a basic guarantee into an illusory promise; and the supremacy clause of the Constitution insures that\nthe proper construction may be enforced.'\" Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 284 n. 8, 100 S.Ct. 553, 558 n. 8,\n803 62 L.Ed.2d 481 (1980) (quoting Hampton v.*803City of Chicago, 484 F.2d 602, 607 (7th Cir.1973),cert. denied,\n415 U.S. 917, 94 S.Ct. 1413, 39 L.Ed.2d 471 (1974)) (citation omitted).\n\nThe test for county liability here, then, is whether the decision to subject arrestees to strip/body cavity searches\nwithout regard to the specific characteristics of the arrestees or arrests or the nature of the crimes with which they\nare charged \"may fairly be said to represent official policy.\" Monell, 436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. at 2037. We believe\nthat it can. As the Sheriff testified in his deposition, he was the \"policy maker for this division ... as it relates to\nstrip search.\" By ordering such searches, the Sheriff established county jail policy, and defendants offer no\nauthority for the argument that, as the highest ranking law enforcement official in the County, he was not entitled\nto do so. See Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, ___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986) (where\nmunicipal official is responsible for establishing governmental policy respecting challenged activity, municipal\nliability attaches); Blackburn v. Snow, 771 F.2d 556, 571 (1st Cir.1985) (where sheriff was responsible for\npromulgating security policies for correction facilities, \"there could hardly be a clearer case of county liability\" for\ndamage caused by strip search rule).\nIn this connection, we reject defendants' argument that the Sheriff's policy is mandated by N.Y.Admin.Code tit. 9,\n§ 75021.1(a), which provides that \"[b]efore being placed in a cell or detention room, the clothing and person of\neach prisoner shall be thoroughly searched.\" The regulation does not on its face compel strip/body cavity\nsearches; indeed, defense counsel conceded at oral argument before the district court that the Sheriff had\ninterpreted the regulation in a manner not necessarily required by its terms. 630 F.Supp. at 257. The district court\naccordingly held that the \"strip search policy implemented by the Sheriff is constitutional.\" Id. at 257 (emphasis\nadded). In view of our contrary determination as to the policy's constitutionality, the County is liable for the\ndamage the policy caused.\nIII. The Sheriff's Claim to Immunity\nDefendants argue that because the search of Mrs. Weber did not violate \"clearly established\" constitutional rights\nat the time of search, the Sheriff is entitled to good-faith immunity under Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 102\nS.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). In Salahuddin v. Coughlin, 781 F.2d 24 (2d Cir.1986), this court explained the \nHarlow test as follows: \"The pertinent test in applying [the objective good-faith] defense is whether the federal law\nviolated was clearly established, ... not whether a reasonable person would have known of the law.\" Id. at 27\n(citations omitted). Although this question is perhaps closer than the others, we think that the law was clearly\nestablished and that the Sheriff is not entitled to the good-faith immunity defense. See Jones v. Edwards, 770\n[9]\nF.2d 739, 742 n. 4 (8th Cir.1985).\nAt least eleven circuit court decisions, three of them antedating the search in this case, hold similar policies\nunconstitutional. See supra notes 6 and 7, and cases there cited. In this circuit, although we have not directly\nruled on the precise issue presented in this case, we have variously described \"the indignities of a rectal search,\" \nSostre v. Preiser, 519 F.2d 763, 764 (2d Cir.1975), as \"insensitive, demeaning and stupid,\" Sala v. County of\nSuffolk, 604 F.2d 207, 211 (2d Cir.1979),vacated and remanded,446 U.S. 903, 100 S.Ct. 1827, 64 L.Ed.2d 256\n(1980), \"degrading,\" and a \"major invasion into privacy.\" Security and Law Enforcement Employees v. Carey, 737\n[10]\nF.2d 187, 208 (2d Cir.1984).  It may be true, as appellees argue, that there is not \"one case which prohibited\n804 body cavity searches of *804 people [sic] charged with resisting arrest.\"[11] But Monroe County Jail policy is not\nrestricted to such persons. In any event, a probable explanation for the absence of such cases is that other\ngovernment authorities have sensibly abandoned or declined to establish policies calling for routine strip/body\ncavity searches of all persons resisting arrest. As we have noted, municipalities that have adopted similar\npolicies, uniformly subjecting intoxicated traffic law offenders and other misdemeanants to such searches, have\nall seen those policies abrogated when challenged. Securities and Law Enforcement Employees v. Carey, which\ngranted qualified immunity to correction officers who ordered unconstitutional strip/body cavity searches of their\nfellows, thus stands in contrast, because those officials \"operated in an area in which the law was not charted\nclearly.\" Id. at 211.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe recognize the need, when the intrusion of strip searches and body cavity searches is reasonably justifiable, to\ndefer to the judgment of prison officials charged with preserving order and maintaining the security of detention\nfacilities; such deference is sometimes appropriate even if in the judgment of the court less intrusive means to\nsecure the prison and protect the safety of jailers and inmates might have been employed. Deference, however,\nis not a dispensation from the requirement under the Fourth Amendment that searches be reasonable. We\nconclude that a reasonable suspicion that an accused misdemeanant or other minor offender is concealing\nweapons or other contraband 00 suspicion based on the particular traits of the offender, the arrest and/or the\n97\n[12]\ncrime charged 00 is necessary before subjecting the arrestee to the indignities of a strip/body cavity search.\n97\nWe also conclude on the facts of this case that the jail employee who undertook the search of Mrs. Weber\npursuant to County policy, and that the Sheriff who promulgated that policy is not entitled to a good-faith immunity\ndefense. We accordingly reverse the judgment below, and direct the entry of summary judgment in favor of\nappellant Ann Weber as to the liability of the County and the Sheriff under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 with respect to the\nchallenged strip/body cavity search.\n[1] An appropriate order was entered below pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) directing the entry of an appealable\nfinal judgment with respect to the matters considered in this opinion.\n[2] This court has the power in appropriate circumstances to reverse a district court's grant of summary judgment\nand to grant summary judgment for the nonmoving party. See Ithaca College v. NLRB, 623 F.2d 224, 229 (2d\nCir.),cert. denied,449 U.S. 975, 101 S.Ct. 386, 66 L.Ed.2d 237 (1980); Abrams v. Occidental Petroleum Corp.,\n450 F.2d 157, 165-66 (2d Cir.1971),aff'd sub nom. Kern County Land Co. v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., 411\nU.S. 582, 93 S.Ct. 1736, 36 L.Ed.2d 503 (1973); 6 Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 56.12. It may do so a fortiori\nwhere, as here, the adversary parties have moved for summary judgment. Id. ¶ 56.13, at 56-348 to 349. In view\nof the conclusions expressed herein, no purpose would be served by remanding for further litigation as to liability\nconcerning the questions decided in this opinion.\n[3] The only claims pleaded against the County and the Sheriff are the violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 described\nearlier herein, and a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985 resulting from an alleged agreement between the County, the\nSheriff and the City of Rochester to effectuate the policy of strip/body cavity searches.\n[4] The defendants ground their defense on the argument that a reasonable suspicion of the particular arrestee is\nunnecessary to justify strip/body cavity searches. They do not seriously argue that they harbored any such\nsuspicion of Mrs. Weber 00 except for one small suggestion raised by defense counsel in her brief and at oral\n97\nargument. We reject as ridiculous the suggestion that, for lack of a purse or pockets, a woman dressed in a\nformal evening gown is in fact more likely than a man or a woman dressed in casual attire to be concealing\ncontraband in her body cavities.\n[5] The court below also adverted, 630 F.Supp. at 258, to Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89\nL.Ed.2d 251 (1986), as a recent Supreme Court expression of the deference to be accorded prison\nadministrators with respect to security matters. Indeed it is, but in a context (an alleged infringement of Eighth\nAmendment rights when a prisoner was shot during a prison riot) too remote to be of much assistance here.\n[6]See Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir.1985) (strip/body cavity search of arrestee who refused to sign\nsummons and became belligerent toward arresting officers was unconstitutional); Stewart v. County of Lubbock,\n767 F.2d 153 (5th Cir.1985) (reasonable suspicion standard did not justify strip searches of persons arrested for\nmisdemeanors punishable only by fine), cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 106 S.Ct. 1378, 89 L.Ed.2d 604 (1986); \nLevka v. City of Chicago, 748 F.2d 421 (7th Cir.1984) (reviewing damage award for an unconstitutional strip/body\ncavity search); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir.1984) (arrestees for traffic law violations and other minor\noffenses may be strip-searched only if reasonable suspicion standard is satisfied), cert. denied,471 U.S. 1053,\n105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir.1984) (strip search of traffic\noffender was unconstitutional where no circumstances indicated that the offender might have been concealing\n\ncontraband and the offense was not associated with such concealment); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723\nF.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983) (policy calling for strip/body cavity searches of women arrested for misdemeanor\noffenses was unconstitutional); Tikalsky v. City of Chicago, 687 F.2d 175 (7th Cir.1982) (strip/body cavity search\nof woman arrested for disorderly conduct violated her Fourth Amendment rights); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007\n(4th Cir.1981) (strip search of DWI arrestee was unconstitutional), cert. denied,455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71\nL.Ed.2d 653 (1982); Tinetti v. Wittke, 479 F.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wis.1979) (probable cause was necessary to justify\nstrip searches for non-misdemeanor traffic offenses), aff'd,620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980) (per curiam); cf. Dufrin v.\nSpreen, 712 F.2d 1084 (6th Cir.1983) (strip/body cavity search of arrestee charged with felonious assault was\ndistinguished from cases in which minor offenders were subjected to such searches). All of these cases except \nLevka v. City of Chicago and Tinetti v. Wittke specifically considered and applied Bell v. Wolfish.\n[7]See Jones v. Edwards; Stewart v. County of Lubbock; Levka v. City of Chicago; and Giles v. Ackerman; see\nalso Ward v. County of San Diego, 783 F.2d 1385 (9th Cir.1986) (reaffirming that reasonable suspicion is required\nin Ninth Circuit to justify strip/body cavity search of arrestee).\n[8] Article XIII, § 13(a) of the New York Constitution provides that \"the county shall never be made responsible for\nthe acts of the sheriff.\"\n[9] We note that even if the Sheriff were entitled to such a defense, it would not extend to the County. Owen v.\nCity of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980).\n[10] We note that Security and Law Enforcement Employees v. Carey did not precede the events here litigated.\n[11]Cf. Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739, 741-42 (8th Cir.1985), and Alberts v. City of New York, 549 F.Supp. 227,\n229 n. 2 (S.D.N.Y.1982).\n[12]Compare Smith v. Montgomery County, 643 F.Supp. 435 (D.Md.1986), holding that reasonable suspicion\nexists to strip search all felony arrestees, all temporary detainees arrested for misdemeanor offenses that involve\nweapons or contraband, and all temporary detainees with prior records of convictions or unresolved arrests for\nfelony offenses or for misdemeanors involving weapons or contraband, and asserting that such \"bright lines\"\nformulae are necessary to provide workable guidance to jail administrators.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",
