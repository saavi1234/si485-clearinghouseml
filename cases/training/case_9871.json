That policy required that each inmate be strip searched by a same sex jail staff member before being placed in a cell or detention room.  </p><p>Plaintiff alleged that  following her arrest and booking at the Jail, she was taken to a bathroom and ordered to disrobe.  While she was nude, a female deputy looked into her mouth, nose and ears; checked her breasts; and told her to squat, spread her buttocks apart and cough three times.</p><p>After discovery was conducted, defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.</p><p>On May 4, 2000, the District Court (Magistrate Judge T Michael Putnam) denied defendants' motion, holding that the Jail's policy of strip searching all jail admittees, regardless of personal circumstances, violated the constitution.  Judge Putnam also held that defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity. Wilson v. Shelby County, Ala., 95 F.Supp.2d 1258 (N.D.Ala. 2000).   Defendants appealed.</p><p>The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ( District Judge) reversed, holding that while the Jail's blank strip search policy of searching all inmates, without any reasonable suspicion, was unconstitutional, the defendant was entitled to qualified immunity.

We agree with the district \ncourt's finding that the search, conducted without reasonable suspicion, violated \nWilson's rights under the Fourth Amendment.  Nevertheless, because we hold that \nDefendant Sheriff James Jones is entitled to qualified immunity, we reverse the \ndistrict court's finding of liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn May 1, 1998, deputy sheriffs of Shelby County, Alabama arrested Wilson \nat a license checkpoint for driving under the influence of alcohol.  After her arrest, \nWilson was taken to the Shelby County Jail, where, due to the level of alcohol in \nher blood, she was required to remain until the following morning.  Because the \nShelby County Jail does not have separate facilities to hold temporary female \ndetainees, Wilson was placed in a cell within the general female population of the \njail. \nBefore taking Wilson to her cell, a female corrections officer performed a \nstrip search on Wilson pursuant to Policy Number B-1 03 of the Shelby County Jail, \n2 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 4 of 14(cid:10)\nwhich requires each arrestee to undergo a \"complete search\" prior to admission into \nthe general population of the jail.  The officer escorted Wilson to an unoccupied \nrestroom in the jail and, after allowing her to use the restroom, instructed her to \ndisrobe completely, face the wall, squat, spread her buttocks, and cough three times. \nThe officer also checked Wilson's ears, mouth, nose and breasts during the search. \nShe did not, however, do a visual or manual inspection of Wilson's body cavities \nbelow the waist. \n1 \nSubsequently, Wilson brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Sheriff \nJones, asserting that he violated her Fourth Amendment rights by creating and \nimplementing the policy under which she was searched.2  The district court denied \nSheriff Jones's motion to dismiss and his motion for summary judgment, finding (1) \nthat the policy requiring a strip search of all arrestees admitted to the Shelby County \nJail was unconstitutional; and (2) that Sheriff Jones was not entitled to qualified \nimmunity.  Sheriff Jones appeals the district court's denial of his motion for \nsummary judgment. \nIThe search was conducted in accordance with the policy promulgated by Sheriff Jones \nand no violations or departures from that policy are alleged. \n2Wilson also sued Shelby County and an unknown Deputy Sheriff.  The district court, \nhowever, dismissed Wilson's claims against those parties, as well as her claims against Sheriff \nJones in his official capacity.  The dismissal of those claims is not at issue in this appeal. \n3 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 5 of 14(cid:10)\nII.  DISCUSSION \nWe review de novo the district court's order denying Sheriff Jones's motion \nfor summary judgment.  See Sheth v. Webster, 145 F.3d 1231, 1235 (lIth Cir. \n1998).  In reviewing the district court's denial of summary judgment, we \"'must first \ndetermine whether the plaintiffhas alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional \nright at all, and if so, proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established \nat the time of the alleged violation.'\" McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, 1254 \n(lIth Cir. 1999) (quoting Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 290 (1999». \nA.  Constitutional Violation \nWe begin our discussion with the Supreme Court case of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 \nu.S. 520 (l978), which held that strip and visual body cavity searches may, in \ncertain instances, be conducted on inmates with less than probable cause.  In Bell, \nthe Court articulated the balancing test by which courts are to evaluate the \nreasonableness of a particular search: \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable \nof precise definition or mechanical application.  In each case it requires \na balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of \npersonal rights that the search entails.  Courts must consider the scope \nof the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \nId. at 559.  Balancing \"the significant and legitimate security interests of the \n4 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 6 of 14(cid:10)\ninstitution against the privacy interests of the inmates,\" the Bell Court upheld a \nprison policy requiring inmates to submit to routine strip searches with visual body \ncavity inspections after each contact visit with a person from outside the institution. \nId. at 560.  Despite holding that particular policy constitutional, however, \"Bell v. \nWolfish [did] not validate a blanket policy of strip searching pre-trial detainees.\" \nMasters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253 (6th Cir. 1989). \nRather, \"[t]he Bell balancing test for reasonableness requires at a minimum, \nthat the facts upon which an intrusion is based be capable of measurement against \nan objective standard ....\"   Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 192 \n(lIth Cir. 1992) (citation andintemal quotation marks omitted).  Courts considering \nthe issue \"have applied 'objective standards' ranging from 'reasonable suspicion' to \n'probable cause. '\" Id.  (citations omitted). This court recognizes that \"reasonable \nsuspicion\" is sufficient to justify the strip search of a pretrial detainee.  See \nSkurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678,682 (lIth Cir. 2000); see also Justice, 961 F.2d \nat 193 (holding that law enforcement officers \"may conduct a strip search of a \njuvenile in custody, even for a minor offense, based upon reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that the juvenile is concealing weapons or contraband\"). \nIn Skurstenis v. Jones, a case decided subsequent to the search of Wilson, we \nalready addressed the reasonableness of the policy at the Shelby County Jail.  See \n5 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 7 of 14(cid:10)\nSkurstenis, 236 F.3d at 680-82.  Relying on the balancing test articulated in Bell, we \ndetermined that Policy Number B-1 03 violated the Fourth Amendment because it \ndid not require reasonable suspicion as a predicate to strip searching newly admitted \ndetainees.3  Id. at 682 (\"This policy, which does not require any reasonable \nsuspicion, does not comport with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.\").4 \nNevertheless, we concluded that PlaintiffSkurstenis's Fourth Amendment rights \nwere not violated by a search pursuant to that policy because officers had \nreasonable suspicion that she was concealing a weapon.5  Id. \nHere, unlike Skurstenis, there is no evidence that the officers at Shelby \nCounty Jail had reasonable suspicion that Wilson was concealing weapons or any \nother type of contraband.  Indeed, as the district court noted, an officer pennitted \n3Like Wilson, the detainee searched in Skurstenis had been arrested for driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol and only remained in the jail overnight.  See Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 680. \n4As noted by the district court in Skurstenis, there are important factual differences \nbetween Bell and Skurstenis which account, in part, for the courts' differing conclusions \nregarding the challenged policies.  See Skurstenis v. Jones, F. Supp. 2d 1228, 1232 (N.D. Ala. \n1999), vacated by 236 F.3d 678 (11th Cir. 2000).  The main difference is that, unlike the inmate \nin Bell, \"Skurstenis had no contact with anyone 'outside the institution' after she was arrested, \nsomething essential to the decision in Bell. . .. She was not out oflaw enforcement supervision \nfrom the first moment she was approached by the arresting officer, until her eventual release.  She \ndid not meet with any 'visitor,' nor did she have any opportunity to acquire or to hide a weapon \nor other contraband.\" Id.  Thus, in Skurstenis, as in the present case, there did not exist the same \nthreat to security that justified the routine search in Bell. \n5The court concluded there was reasonable suspicion based on Skurstenis's possession of \na.38 Special handgun at the time of her arrest. \n6 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 8 of 14(cid:10)\nWilson to use the bathroom prior to the search, which indicates a lack of fear that \nWilson might flush any such substance down the toilet.  Moreover, Sheriff Jones \ntestified that \"I don't believe we had a reason to suspect that [Wilson] had any \ncontraband. \" \nBecause Wilson was strip searched absent reasonable suspicion, we hold that \nthe search of Wilson, as well as the jail's policy authorizing her search, violated the \nFourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Other \ncircuits addressing this issue have held similar policies unconstitutional.  See. e.g., \nRoberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107 (1st Cir. 2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 \nF.2d 393 (10th Cir. 1993); Fuller v. M.G. Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437 (9th Cir. 1991); \nMasters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir. 1989); Watt v. City of Richardson \nPolice Dept., 849 F.2d 195 (5th Cir. 1988); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir. \n1986); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir. 1985); Mary Beth G. v. City of \nChicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir. 1983). \nB.  Qualified Immunity \nHaving established the existence of a constitutional violation, we turn to the \nissue whether or not Sheriff Jones is entitled to qualified immunity.  \"Qualified \nimmunity shields a § 1983 defendant from liability for harms arising from \ndiscretionary acts, as long as the discretionary acts do not violate clearly established \n7 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 9 of 14(cid:10)\nfederal statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have \nknown.\"  Jackson v. Sauls, 206 F.3d 1156, 1164 (lIth Cir. 2000).6  In analyzing a \nqualified immunity defense, we are to consider only the \"clearly established law and \nthe information possessed by the official at the time the conduct occurred.\" Hope v. \nPelzer, 240 F.3d 975,981 (lIth Cir. 2001) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \"For qualified immunity to be surrendered, pre-existing law must dictate, \nthat is, truly compel (not just suggest or allow or raise a question about), the \nconclusion for every like-situated, reasonable government agent that what defendant \nis doing violates federal law in the circumstances.\" Lassiter v. Ala. A & M Univ. \nBd. ofTrs., 28 F.3d 1146, 1150 (lith Cir. 1994).  Upon review of the record, we \ncannot conclude that the preexisting case law \"compels the conclusion\" for every \nreasonable government official in Sheriff Jones's position that the policy at Shelby \nCounty Jail violates the Fourth Amendment. \nAt the time of Wilson's search, the only controlling cases in this jurisdiction \ninvolving strip searches of pretrial detainees were Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 \n(1979) and Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (lIth Cir. 1992).  As \ndiscussed below, neither of those cases clearly established a constitutional violation \non facts \"materially similar\" to those in the present case.  See Lassiter, 28 F.3d at \n6It is undisputed that Sheriff Jones acted within the scope of his discretionary authority. \n8 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 10 of 14(cid:10)\n1150 (\"When considering whether the law applicable to certain facts is clearly \nestablished, ... [t]he facts need not be the same as the facts of the immediate case. \nBut they do need to be materially similar.\") (emphasis added) (citation omitted). \nIn Bell, as discussed supra, the Supreme Court upheld a federal prison's \npolicy that required pretrial inmates \"to expose their body cavities for visual \ninspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a \nperson from outside the institution.\"  Bell, 441 U.S. at 558.  In justifying the policy \nbased on security concerns, the Court emphasized that \"[a] detention facility is a \nunique place fraught with serious security dangers.  Smuggling of money, drugs, \nweapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence.\" Id. at 559. \nGiven the language in Bell, it was not unreasonable for someone in Sheriff Jones's \nposition to believe that blanket strip searches of newly admitted detainees were \njustified based on the serious risk that smuggled weapons and other contraband \nposed to the jail's security.  The fact that the Bell Court upheld a search that was \nmore intrusive than the one at issue here further weighs against a conclusion that \nBell should have put Sheriff Jones on notice that his policy was unconstitutional.7 \nSee Hill v. Dekalb Reg'l Youth Det. Ctr., 40 F.3d 1176, 1185 (lIth Cir. 1994) (\"To \nbe 'clearly established,' the federal law by which the government official's conduct \n7Jn contrast to the search in Bell, Wilson's lower body cavities were not inspected. \n9 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 11 of 14(cid:10)\nshould be evaluated must be preexisting, obvious and mandatory so that a similarly \nsituated, reasonable government agent would be on notice that his or her questioned \nconduct violates federal law under the circumstances.\") (emphasis added) (citation \nomitted). \nJustice involved a strip search of a fourteen year old plaintiff who was \narrested for minor offenses.  See Justice, 961 F.2d at 189-90.  After the plaintiff was \narrested, she was taken to a room in the police station and ordered to strip down to \nher panties even though her mother already had arrived to take her home.  Id. at \n190.  Once the officers completed the search, they released the plaintiff into her \nmother's custody.  Id.  In concluding that the strip search was constitutional, we \nheld that \"law enforcement officers may conduct a strip search of a juvenile in \ncustody, even for a minor offense, based upon reasonable suspicion to believe that \nthe juvenile is concealing weapons or contraband.\" Id. at 193.8 \nWilson contends that our decision in Justice gave Sheriff Jones fair warning \nthat strip searching Wilson without reasonable suspicion violated the Fourth \nAmendment.  See McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, 1260 (l1th Cir. 1999) \n(\"Qualified immunity is a guarantee of fair warning. \").  Because we perceive a \n8In Justice, we concluded that the \"facts of this case gave the officers a 'reasonable \nsuspicion,' and thus the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\" Justice, 961 F.2d at 194. \n10 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 12 of 14(cid:10)\nmaterial difference between Justice and the case at hand, we disagree with Wilson's \ncontention.  In Justice, unlike the present case, the detainee was not going to be \nplaced in a cell nor put in contact with the general inmate population.  Rather, she \nwas to be released to her parents after the search was completed.  See Justice, 961 \nF.2d at 190.  In contrast, Wilson was placed in a cell located within the female cell \nblock, in the general population of the jail, where she was to remain until the \nfollowing morning.  Although Wilson was placed in a cell by herself, to reach her \ncell, she had to be escorted through an area housing several other female inmates. \nFurthermore, Wilson testified that during the night, inmates came up and talked to \nher through a window on her door which was used to pass through food trays. The \ndetainee in Justice thus posed a lesser risk to the security of the jail than did Wilson, \nyet the search in Justice was upheld as constitutional.  Accordingly, our decision in \nJustice does not clearly establish a constitutional violation on facts \"materially \nsimilar\" to those in the present case.  See Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1150. \nMoreover, following Bell and Justice, but prior to the strip search of Wilson, \na district court in the Northern District of Alabama specifically found that a strip \nsearch conducted pursuant to Sheriff Jones's policy at the Shelby County Jail did \nnot violate the Fourth Amendment.  See Mumpower v. Jones, No. 98-1097, slip op. \nat 11 (N.D. Ala. Apr. 14, 1999).  Likewise, a district court from the Middle District \n11 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 13 of 14(cid:10)\nof Alabama held that a similar policy was justified based on security concerns.  See \nMagill v. Lee County, 990 F. Supp. 1382, 1392 (M.D. Ala. 1998), aff'd 161 F.3d \n22 (11th Cir. 1998).9  Analyzing the precedent set forth in Bell and Justice, the \ncourt in Magill explained: \nIf the Supreme Court can approve a strip search and body cavity search \nprocedure on detainees who have had a contact visit with the public, .. \n. , surely this court must approve the present search.  Likewise, if the \nEleventh Circuit can approve strip-searches ofj uveniles who are not \neven going to be placed into a cell, this court should approve the \npresent search. \nId. at 1392. \nInasmuch as two district judges had concluded that Sheriff Jones's \npolicy and a similar policy were constitutional, it seems unreasonable to hold \nthe sheriff liable for concluding the same.  As this court previously has held, \n\"[u]nless a government agent's act is so obviously wrong, in the light of pre-\nexisting law, that only a plainly incompetent officer or one who was \nknowingly violating the law would have done such a thing, the government \nactor has immunity from suit.\" Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1149.  In view of the case \n'Unlike Wilson, the detainees in Magill were not required to remove their underwear as \npart ofthe search. Nevertheless, the court in Magill clarified that it was not \"basing its opinion on \nthe Sheriff's decision to allow the inmates to keep on their underwear.  The constitutional \nbalancing of the inmate's rights and jail's concerns does not necessarily turn on the issue of \nwhether the inmates are allowed to wear a bra and panties.\" Magill, 990 F. Supp. at 1390. \n12 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 40     Filed 06/25/2001     Page 14 of 14(cid:10)\nlaw discussed above, we cannot say that \"only a plainly incompetent officer \nor one who was knowingly violating the law,\" would have promulgated the \npolicy at issue here. to  See id. \nTherefore, although we hold that the strip search of Wilson was \nunconstitutional, we conclude that Sheriff Jones is entitled to qualified \nimmunity from liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Accordingly, the district \ncourt's entry of summary judgment in favor of Wilson is \nREVERSED. \nA True  Copy  • Attested: \nClerk,  U.S.  Court  of  f\\ppeals~ • \n/ \n~wenth GiJCWh \n_  (jJ  \"L)(UJ-Le./ \n1;OL \n·~~t;cferk .

We decline to do so in \nlight of the two district court opinions discussed above, which affirmatively upheld the policy at \nthe Shelby County Jail and a policy similar to it.

The  motion  has  been  briefed  by  all \nparties,  and oral argument was heard on March 17,  1999.  Defendants \nclaim that all of plaintiff's claims  are due  to be dismissed based \nupon  sovereign  immunity,  discretionary  function  immunity,  and \nqualified immunity. \nOn January 20,  1999,  the plaintiff,  a  minor,  filed a  complaint \nin  this  matter,  seeking  damages1  in  the  amount  of  $1,000,000 \nagainst  Shelby  County,  Alabama,  and  Sheriff  James  Jones.  The \n2 \nThere  is no  request  for  injunctive or declarative \nrelief. \nThe  complaint  also names  as  a  defendant  \"an unknown \ndeputy  sheriff\";  however,  fictitious pleading has  no  effect  in \nfederal  court,  and  the  deputy  is not  deemed  to be  a  party. \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 2 of 18(cid:10)\ncomplaint  arises  from  the  arrest  of  the  minor  plaintiff  and  the \nsubsequent  strip search  conducted  at  the  Shelby  County  Sheriff's \nDepartment.  According  to  the  complaint,  the  18 -year-old  female \nplaintiff  was  stopped  by  Shelby  County  sheriff's  deputies  at  a \ndriver's license checkpoint on or about May 1,  1998.  The plaintiff \nshowed deputies  a  valid driver's  license.  Plaintiff alleges  that \nthe deputies  then searched a  closed cooler on the back seat of  the \ncar.  In the  cooler,  deputies  found  unopened  cans  of  beer. \nThe  complaint  further alleges that plaintiff was  then given a \nbreath  alcohol  test,  which  registered  a  reading  below  the  legal \nlimit.  Plaintiff  was  then  charged  with  DUI  and  an  additional \nbreath alcohol  test  was  given  to plaintiff,  the  results  of  which \nindicated that plaintiff's blood alcohol  level  exoeeded  the  legal \nlimit.  Plaintiff was subsequently taken to the Shelby County Jail, \nwhere  a  third breath alcohol  test was  administered.  Plaintiff has \nnot  alleged the  results Df  the  third test. \nAfter being taken to the Shelby County Jail, plaintiff alleges \nthat  she  asked permission to use  the bathroom,  was  allowed  to use \nthe bathroom,  and  then was  strip searched  in the  jail bathroom by \na  female  deputy.  The  strip  search  included  the  removal  of \nundergarments and a  visual inspection of body cavities.  The deputy \nperforming  the  search  also  allegedly  attempted  to  remove  a  ring \n2 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 3 of 18(cid:10)\nfrom the plaintiff's navel,  and plaintiff alleges that the removal \ncaused physical  injury and  infection. \nPlaintiff  alleges  that  the  sheriff's  office  has  a  policy of \nstrip searching all persons who,  following arrest,  are confined in \nthe Shelby County Jail.  Plaintiff alleges that  the policy and the \ndeputy's actions constitute an unreasonable search violative of the \nFourth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  She  also \nalleges  that  the  initial  search  of  the  closed  cooler was  without \nprobable  cause,  in  violation  of  her  Fourth  Amendment  rights. \nPlaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42  U.S.C.  §  1983,  and also \nalleges  state  law  claims  for  invasion  of  privacy  and  false \nimprisonment. \nOn  February  22,  1999,  defendants  Shelby  County  and  Sheriff \nJames  Jones  responded  to plaintiff's complaint  by  filing  a  motion \nto  dismiss.  As  grounds  for  the  motion,  defendants  state  that  no \n3 \nclaims  are made  against  Shelby County,  and  no  claims  arising  from \nplaintiff's  arrest  may  properly  be  made  against  Shelby  County \nbecause  the  sheriff  is  a  state  employee  rather  than  a  county \nemployee.

Defendants  further assert that the \nsheriff  is  absolutely  immune  from  the  Section  1983  claim brought \nagainst  him  in  his  official  capacity.  Additionally,  defendants \nassert  that  the  Fourth  Amendm.ent  claims  are  due  to  be  dismissed \npursuant  to the doctrine of qualified immunity because the sheriff \nreasonably  could  have  believed  that  the  conduct  did  not  violate \nclearly established federal  law.  Finally,  defendants  assert  that \nplaintiff's  allegations  relating  to  the  search  of  the  cooler  and \nthe administration of the breath alcohol test fail to state a  claim \nupon  which  relief  can be  granted. \nSIt\"JiaaEl'ara  Of  \"Rie;view \nWhen ruling on a  motion to dismiss,  the court must assume that \nthe  factual  allegations  in  the  complaint  are  true.  Neitzke  v. \nWilliams,  490  U.S.  319,  109  S.  Ct.  1827,  104  L.  Ed.  2d 338  (1989) i \nFed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12 (b) (6) .  Furthermore,  assuming  that  the  facts \nalleged are true,  a  complaint may be dismissed only if it is clear \nthat  the  plaintiff could not  prove  any  set of  facts  in support  of \nher claims  that would  entitle her to relief.  See,  Hishon v.  King \n& Spalding,  467 U.S.  69,  73;  104  S.  Ct.  2229,  2232,  81  L.

PQw?er- &  Light  Co.,  146  F.3d  1305,  1307 \n( 11th  C i r .  1998).  Therefore,  the  court  accepts  plaintiff's \nallegations as  true,  and view'S  those allegations in the light most \nfavorable  to  the plaintiff. \nC~a:ibmsA(§Jia,\\lii:,m\\s~t S:he:1o¥  CO!UBt.y \nPlaintiff does not  dispute that Shelby County is not  a  proper \nparty to this action.  The  parties agree  that Shelby County is not \nliable  for  a  sheriff's  official  acts  that  may  be  found  to  be \ntortious;  therefore,  the county is due  to be dismissed pursuant  to \nth \nTurguitt v.  Jefferson County,  Alabama,  137  F.3d 1285,  1288-89  (11\nCir.  1998) (holding that the sheriff acts exclusively for the state, \nrather than for the county,  for purposes of  imposing liability for \ninjuries plaintiff sustained in a  county jail).  Consequently,  this \ncourt  finds  that  the  motion  to  dismiss  all  claims  against  Shelby \nCounty  is due  to be  granted. \nPlaintiff also concedes  that u!'l!der  Alabama  law,  the defendant \nsheriff, both in his official and individual capacities,  is entitled \nto absolute,  sovereign immunity from suit based on state law claims. \nth \nSee Mc:Millian v.  Johnson,  101  F.3d 1363  (11 Cir.  1996);  Tinney v. \nth \nShores,  77  F.3d  378  (11 Cir.  1996).  Accordingly,  defendants' \n5 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 6 of 18(cid:10)\nmotion  to dismiss  plaintiff's state  law  claims  based upon Article \n1,  Section 14  of  the Alaba.JiFla  Constitution is due  to be  granted. \nDefendant  asserts,  and  pJaintiff  does  not  dispute,  that  the \nplaintiff's Section 1983  claims against the sheriff in his official \ncapacity are due to be dismissed because the defendant is absolutely \nimmune  pursuant  to  the  Eleventh  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution.  See  Carr  v.  City  of  Florence,  916  F.2d  1521  (11th \nCir.  1990).  However,  plaintiff  contends  that  her  Section  1983 \nclaims  arising  from  the  strip  search  remain  viable  against  the \nsheriff  in his  individual  capacity.4 \nPlaintiff asserts that the search was conducted pursuant to the \nsheriff's  \"blanket  policy,\"  a  policy that  is violative  of  federal \nlaw,  and the sheriff is therefore individually liable.  Defendants \n5 \nPlaintiff's respolf:ls:e  to defendants'  motion  to dismiss \ndoes  not  address  the viability of plaintiff's clahns  relating to \nthe  cooler search or to adtrnlinistration of  the breath alcohol \ntest.  The  court will  neverthoeless  determine,  infra,  whether \nthese  claims  are  due  to be  dismissed. \nIn the  alternative,  the plaintiff argues  that:  (1)  the \nsearch was  conducted  in violation of  the  department  policy,  and \nthe  deputy  is  individually liable;  or  (2)  both the  sheriff and \nthe  deputy are  individually liable  if portions of  the policy are \nunlawful  and  the  deputy acted outside  the  scope  of  the policy. \nHowever,  as  discussed  supra  at  n.2,  the  unknown  deputy  is not  a \nparty to this action. \n6 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 7 of 18(cid:10)\ncontend that the sheriff is shielded from liability by the qualified \nimmunity doctrine. \nUnder  federal  law,  it is well  settled that qualified immunity \nprotects  government  officials  performing  discretionary  functions \nfrom  civil  suit,  and  from  liability,  where  their conduct  does  not \nviolate  \"clearly established  statutory or  constitutional  rights.\" \nLassiter  v.  Alabama  A  &  M  Univ.,  28  F.3d  1146,  1149  (11th  Cir. \n1994) (citing Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald,  457  U.S.  800,  818,  102  S.  Ct. \n2727,  2738,  73  L.  Ed.  2d 396  (1982)) (additional citations omitted) . \nFurthermore,  it  is  the  general  rule  that  qualified  immunity  will \nprotect government  actors from liability,  and only in \"exceptional \ncases\"  will the immunity be unavailable as a  shield.  Id.  Even so, \nqualified immunity does  not  apply  in those  instances where  the  law \nhas  \"been developed in such a  concrete and factually defined context \nto  make  it  obvious  to  all  reasonable  government  actors,  in  the \ndefendant's place,\"  that the actions violate  federal  law.  Id.  It \nis  not  necessary  that  the  facts  of  the  cases  relied  upon  as  the \n\"clearly established law\"  be  the  same  as  in the  instant  case,  but \nthey  \"do  need  to be  materially similar\".  Id.  at  1150. \nIn this case,  the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has spoken \non  the  precise  issue  at  bar:  the  permissible  limits  of  a  strip \nsearch  conducted  on  a  minor  female.  See  Justice  v.  City  of \nPeacht.ree  City,  961  F.2d  188  (11th  Cir.  1992)  In  Justice,  a  14-\n7 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 8 of 18(cid:10)\nyear-old  female  was  lawfully arrested  in  Peachtree  City,  Georgia, \nfor  loitering and  truancy.  rd.  at  189.  The  officers approached a \ncar,  being driven by a  male  juvenile,  with a  juvenile female  as  the \nsole passenger.  As  the officers approached the  car,  they observed \nthe driver give something to the passenger.  The officers conducted \na  pat-down search of  the driver at the scene,  searched the purse of \nthe  passenger,  and  then  transported  both  juveniles  to  the  police \nstation.  rd.  at 190.  At  the  station,  two  female  officers took the \nfemale  to an empty room,  where  they conducted a  strip search.  They \nallowed her to remain in her undergarments,  and they did not conduct \na  body cavity search.  rd. \nTo  determine  the  issues presented in Justice,  the  court  first \nnoted  that  the  Fourth  Amendment  is  violated  when  the  government \nconducts  an  unreasonable  search  in  an  area  where  a  person  has  a \nreasonable expectation of privacy.  rd.  at 191.  The  court  further \nconsidered it \"axiomatic\"  that people have a  reasonable expectation \nof  privacy  in  their  \"private  parts.\"  rd.  Recognizing  the \ndemeaning,  degrading and humiliating nature of a  strip search on any \nperson,  the  court  noted  that  a  minor  would  be  \"especially \nsusceptible\"  to possible  trauma  or psychological  damage  caused by \na  strip search.  rd.  at  192,  quoting  Flores v.  Meese,  681  F.  Supp. \n665,  667  (C.D.  Cal.  1988),  rev'd on other grounds,  507 U.S.  292,  113 \nS.  Ct.  1439,  123  L.  Ed.  2d  1  (1993). \n8 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 9 of 18(cid:10)\nThe court in Justice evaluated the reasonableness of the search \nby  applying  a  balancing  test  set  forth  by  the  Supreme  Court. \nJustice,  961  F.2d at 192-94,  citing Bell v.  Wolfish,  441  U.S.  520, \n99  S.  Ct.  1861,  L.  Ed.  2d  447  (1979).  In Bell,  the  Supreme  Court \nexamined  the  legality  of  a  correctional  facility's  routine  strip \nsearches,  with  visual  body  cavity  searches,  conducted  on  all \nprisoners  after  a  contact  visit  with  any  person  from  outside  the \ninstitution.  The  Court  in Bell  stated: \nThe  test of  reasonableness under the Fourth Amendmel1t  is \nnot  capable  of  precise  definition  or  mechanical \napplication.  In each case it requires a  balancing of the \nneed  for  the  particular  search  against  the  invasion  of \npersonal  rights  that  the  search  entails.  Courts  must \nconsider  the  scope  of  the  particular  intrusion,  the \nmanner  in  which  it  is  conducted,  the  justification  for \ninitiating it,  and  the  place  in which  it is conducted. \nBell,  441 U.S.  at 559,  99  S.  Ct.  at 1884.  The  Supreme Court did not \naddress  the  legality  of  such  searches  on  minors,  but  held  that \nstrip searches  were  not  per se illegal.  However,  the  Court  noted \nthat  there  must  exist  some  objective  standard,  such  as  reasonable \nsuspicion,  although  the  search  need  not  be  premised  on  so  high  a \nstandard as  \"probable cause\".  Bell,  441  U.S.  560.  The  searches at \nissue  in  Bell  were  designed  both  to  discover  and  to  deter  the \nsmuggling  into the  facility of contraband,  and apparently had been \nsuccessful in doing both.  Id.  at 558-60.  The Court reiterated that \n9 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 10 of 18(cid:10)\nthe strip search must  be  \"reasonable\"  under the circumstances.  rd. \nBell  stands  for  the  limited  proposition  that  visual  body  cavity \nsearches are permissible on  adult prisoners,  after they have  had a \ncontact  visit  and  before  returning  to  the  cells,  because  contact \nvisits  are  known  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  the  smuggling  of \nweapons,  money,  or drugs. \nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals applied the Bell  test in \naffirming the district court's ruling that the search in Justice did \nnot  violate  the  Fourth  Amendment.  The  Eleventh  Circuit  first \nassumed  that  the  juvenile  was  lawfully  in  custody.  Justice,  961 \nF.2d at  191.  The  court  next  examined  the  scope,  manner,  and place \nof  the  search.  The  scope  of  the  search  in Justice was  limited to \nexclude  the  body  cavities,  and  to  allow  the  minor  to  wear  her \npanties.  Id.  at  193.  The  manner  of  the  search was  by  two  female \ndeputies.  rd.  The  place  of  the  Justice  search was  an  empty  room \navailable  only  to  the  female  officers  and  the  juvenile.  rd. \n\"Without doubt,\"  the court noted,  \"the officers conducted the strip \nsearch  in the  least  intrusive\"  way possible.  rd. \nThe  court  then  examined  the  justification for  the  search  and \nspecifically  held  that  strip  searches  of  juvenile  arrestees  for \nminor  offenses  are  permissible  only when  based  upon  a  \"reasonable \nsuspicion  to  believe  that  the  juvenile  is  concealing  weapons  or \ncontraband.\"  Id.  at  193.  In  Justice,  the  justification  for  the \n10 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 11 of 18(cid:10)\nsearch  arose  from  the  officers'  observation  of  the  driver  giving \nsomething to the passenger.  Id.  Because  the search in Justice was \nas  unintrusi ve  as  possible,  and  was  prompted  by  a  reasonable \nsuspicion,  the  search  was  not  violative  of  the  Fourth  Amendment. \nJustice,  then,  clearly  stands  for  the  proposition  that  a  strip \nsearch of  a  minor  must  be  conducted  in the  least  intrusive manner \npossible  and  is  not  permissible  in  the  absence  of  reasonable \nsuspicion. 6 \nDefendant  has  pointed out  that  another  judge  in another  case \nin  this  district  determined  that  the  Shelby  County  strip-search \npolicy is not unconstitutional.  In Mumpower v.  Jones,  in the United \nStates District Court for the Northern District of Alabama,  Southern \nDivision,  CV-98-J-1097-S  (April  14,  1999),  the  court had before  it \na  summary  judgment motion in a  case that involved the lawful  arrest \nof  two  female  adults.  That  court  also  relied,  as  defendant  urges \nthis  court  to,  upon  Magill  v.  Lee  County,  990  F.Supp.  1382  (M.D. \nAla.  1998),  aff'd,  161  F.  3d  22  (11th  Cir.  1998).  In  Magill,  the \nThe  Eleventh Circuit  opinion  in Justice  is consistent \nwith  the  law  in other circuits,  where  it has  been determined  that \na  strip search-body cavity selarch of  adult  arrestee charged with \na  minor  offense must  be  based on  reasonable  suspicion.  See  Weber \nv.  Dell,  804  F.2d  796  (2d  Cir.  1986) (reversing district court's \nsummary  judgment  in favor  of  the  sheriff where  adult  arrestee was \nsubj ected to a  strip search aFld  body  cavity s'earch) i  Kennedy v. \nLos  Angeles  Police Dep't,  901  F.2d  702  (9th  Cir.  1989) (finding \nthat policy of  conducting  strip search and body  ca~ity search on \nall  felony  adult  arrestees violated constitutional  rights). \n11 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 12 of 18(cid:10)\ncourt  granted  summary  judgment  for  defendants  in a  case  involving \nstrip searches  of  inmates,  but  those  searches  did not  require  the \nremoval  of  undergarments,  did not  involve  any  body  cavity  search, \nand  did  not  address  the  application  of  that  policy  to  juveniles. \nFurthermore,  the court in Mutlili!j?ower  applied the Justice reasoning by \nrequiring  that  the  search  be  based  on  \"reasonable  suspicion.\" \nMumpower,  at  p .10.  Consequently,  the  holdings  of  Mumpower  and \nMagill  do  not  change  the  clear mandate  of  the  Eleventh  Circuit  as \nset  forth  in Justice. \nNothing  in  the  complaint,  the  motion,  or  in  oral  argument \nsuggests  that  the  Shelby  County  deputies  had  any  reasonable \nsuspicion,  or  any  suspicion  at  all,  that  the  plaintiff  was \nconcealing weapons or contraband.  The fact that plaintiff allegedly \nwas  allowed  to  use  the  bathroom  prior  to  the  search  belies  any \ncontention that the  deputies  suspected the plaintiff of  concealing \nweapons  or contraband because plaintiff could have  flushed any such \nsubstances down the toilet prior to the search.  Also absent  is any \nsuggestion  that  the  search  by  the  Shelby  County  deputies  was \ndesigned  to  deter  the  smuggling  of  contraband.  Indeed,  the \ndeterrence  factor  so  important  in  Bell  is  absent  here,  where  the \nsubj ect  of  the  search  was  not  already  an  inmate  and  had  no \nexpectation,  at  the  time  of  her  traffic  stop,  of  being  placed  in \njail.  Even more  important is the fact that the search at issue here \n12 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 13 of 18(cid:10)\nwas not conducted in the least intrusive manner possible,  as clearly \nrequired by Justice,  because the plaintiff was  forced to remove  her \nundergarments and was  subj ected to a  visual body cavity search.  The \nplace  of  this  search  was  likewise  less  private  than  the  place  in \nJustice.  Plaintiff was  placed in a  bathroom apparently open to any \nother women,  rather than the empty room available only to the deputy \nwho  conducted the search,  as in Justice.  Consequently,  assuming as \ntrue  the  facts  alleged  in  the  complaint  the  plaintiff s  claim \nI  I \nrelating  to  the  strip  search  is  viable,  and  the  sheriff  in  his \nindividual  capacity is not protected by qualified immunity because \nthe  search of  the plaintiff violated the  \"clearly established law\" \nset forth in Bell and Justice.  Consequently,  defendants'  motion to \n7 \ndismiss  is due  to  be  denied as  to  the  Section 1983  claims  against \nthe  sheriff  because  the  plaintiff's claims  arising  from  the  strip \nsearch could sustain a  cause  of  action pursuant  to Section 1983. \nIn tandem with her complaint regarding the manner of the strip \nsearch,  plaintiff complains that the deputies caused physical injury \nThe  court's conclusion does  not  necessarily mean  that \ndefendant  will  not  be  able  to  successfully defend  this claim on \nsummary  judgment  or at  trial,  but,  based on  the  limited \ninformation before  this court  and  the  standards  regarding \ndeterminations  of  a  motion  to dismiss,  the  plaintiff succeeds  in \nstating a  claim. \n13 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 14 of 18(cid:10)\nby  attempting  to  remove  a  belly button  ring  from  the  plaintiff's \nnavel.  It  has  been  held  that  it  is  proper  for  law  enforcement \nofficers  to  remove  property,  including  jewelry,  from  an  arrested \nperson who  is  to be  placed  in  jail.  See  Rodriguez-Mora  v.  Baker, \n792  F.2d  1524,  1526  (11th  Cir.  1986).  It  is  conceivable  that  the \nmanner of  the removal  of the ring,  as alleged in the complaint,  was \nso  inj urious  as  to  state  a  civil  rights  claim.  However,  the \nplaintiff does  not  allege  that  the  sheriff  implemented  any  policy \nco:ncerning  the  removal  of  such  jewelry,  nor  does  plaintiff allege \nthat  the  sheriff  participated  in,  or  was  even  aware  of,  the \ndeputies'  actions  relating  to  removal  of  the  ring.  Consequently, \nplaintiff's claim relating to  the  removal  of  jewelry is due  to  be \ndismissed because  the  complaint  fails  to state a  claim against  the \nsheriff  in  his  individual  capacity  for  which  relief  could  be \ngranted. \nAlthough  plaintiff  challeng'es  the  constitutionality  of  the \nsearch of  the  cooler  and  the  administration of  the  breath alcohol \ntests,  plaintiff  does  not  argue  these  issues  in  her  response  to \ndefendants'  motion  to  dismiss,  or  at  hearing  on  the  motion. \nLikewise,  defendants'  motion to dismiss does not discuss the claims \nrelating to the  search of  the  cooler and  the  administration of  the \nbreath alcohol  test,  except  to baldly  state  that  such  allegations \nfail  to  state  a  claim.  This  court  finds  that,  taking  the \n14 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 15 of 18(cid:10)\nallegations  in the  complaint  as  true and viewing  the  facts  alleged \nin  the  light  most  favorable  to  the  plaintiff,  the  search  of  the \ncooler  could  be  deemed  to  be  a  search  violative  of  the  Fourth \nAmendment.  However,  nothing  in  the  complaint  or  the  arguments \nbefore the court indicate that  the sheriff could be liable for that \nconduct  in his individual capacity.  Plaintiff has  not alleged that \nthe cooler search was pursuant to any policy or practice promulgated \nby  the  sheriff,  or  that  he  was  present,  aware  of,  or participated \nin  the  search  of  the  cooler.  The  sheriff  is  not  liable  for  the \naction of  his deputies merely because he  is their employer.  Monell \nv.  Department  of  Social  Services,  436  U.S.  658/  98  S.  Ct.  2018,  56 \nL.  Ed.  2d 611  (1978).  Accordingly,  the claim relating to the search \nof  the  closed cooler  is due  to be  dismissed. \nAs  to  the  final  allegation,  the  court  finds  that  the \nplaintiff's contention relating to the administration of the breath \nalcohol  tests does not state a  cognizable claim.  Administration of \nthe test is explicitly permitted under Alabama law.  See Alabama Code \n§  32-5-192;  Britton  v.  State,  631  So.  2d  1073  (Ala.  Crim.  App. \n1993).  Even if administration of the breath alcohol  test did state \na  claim,  the  defendant  would  be  immune  from  suit  pursuant  to  the \nEleventh Amendment  to the United States Constitution,  Section 14  of \nthe  Alabama  Constitution,  and  the  doctrine  of  qualified  immunity \nbecause there is no clearly established federal  law prohibiting the \n15 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 12     Filed 04/23/1999     Page 16 of 18(cid:10)\nuse  of  the  breath  alcohol  test  as  is  alleged  by  the  plaintiff. \nAccordingly,  the  breath  alcohol  test  claim  also  is  due  to  be \ndismissed. \nCO.'Jil.C 1,u,s:ioI1L \nAssuming  the  facts  alleged  in  the  complaint  to  be  true,  and \nviewing  those  facts  in the  light  most  favorable  to  the  plaintiff, \nplaintiff  has  stated  a  viable  claim  that  the  sheriff,  in  his \nindividual  capacity,  violated  plaintiff's  rights  under  42  U.S.C. \n1983,  by implementing a  policy that resulted in the strip search of \nthe minor plaintiff with reasonable suspicion that she was  carrying \na  weapon or contraband.  However,  plaintiff's claims against Shelby \nCounty  and  the  sheriff  in his  official  capacity are  barred by  the \nimmunity granted pursuant  to the  Constitution,  and by the  statutes \nand doctrine explained  supra.  Consequently,  defendants'  motion to \ndismiss  is  due  to  be  DENIED  as  to  the  sheriff,  as  an  individual, \nrelating to the  strip search of  the plaintiff.

Ellis, Jr., Wallace Ellis Fowler & Head, Columbia, AL, John W. Dodson, K. Claire White, Ferguson Frost\n& Dodson LLP, Birmingham, AL, for James Jones, defendant.\nORDER DENYING SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nPUTNAM, Chief United States Magistrate Judge.\nThis cause is before the court on the motion for summary judgment filed by defendant Sheriff James Jones on\nFebruary 10, 2000 (Doc. 19). The motion addresses the only claim remaining in this action, whether Sheriff\nJones's policy of requiring a strip search of all arrestees admitted to the Shelby County Jail violated the Fourth\n[1]\nAmendment right of the plaintiff to be free of unreasonable searches.  The parties have briefed this motion, and\noral argument was heard on April 10, 2000.\nSummary Judgment Standard\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers\nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue\nas to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).\nThe party seeking summary judgment \"always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the\nbasis for its motion, and identifying those portions of `the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine\nissue of material fact.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)\n(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). The movant can meet this burden by presenting evidence showing there is no\ndispute of material fact, or by showing that the nonmoving party has failed to present evidence in support of some\nelement of its case on which it bears the ultimate burden of proof. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548.\nThere is no requirement, however, \"that the moving party support its motion with affidavits or other similar\nmaterials negating the opponent's claim.\" Id. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548.\nOnce the moving party has met his burden, Rule 56(e) \"requires the nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings\nand by her own affidavits, or by the `depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions of file,' designate\n`specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.'\" Id. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548 (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 56\n(e)). The nonmoving party need not present evidence in a form necessary for admission at trial; however, she\nmay not merely rest on her pleadings. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548. \"[T]he plain language of Rule 56\n(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party\n\nwho fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and\non which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\" Id. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548.\nAfter the plaintiff has properly responded to a proper motion for summary judgment, the court must grant the\n1260 motion if *1260 there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The substantive law will identify which facts are material and which are irrelevant. \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A dispute is genuine\n\"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id. at 248, 106\nS.Ct. 2505. \"[T]he judge's function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but\nto determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\" Id. at 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505. His guide is the same\nstandard necessary to direct a verdict: \"whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require\nsubmission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\" Id. at 251-52,\n106 S.Ct. 2505; see also Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 461 U.S. 731, 745 n. 11, 103 S.Ct. 2161,\n76 L.Ed.2d 277 (1983). However, the nonmoving party \"must do more than show that there is some metaphysical\ndoubt as to the material facts.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106\nS.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary\njudgment may be granted. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (citations omitted); accord Spence v.\nZimmerman, 873 F.2d 256 (11th Cir.1989). Furthermore, the court must \"view the evidence presented through\nthe prism of the substantive evidentiary burden,\" so there must be sufficient evidence on which the jury could\nreasonably find for the plaintiff. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 254, 106 S.Ct. 2505; Cottle v. Storer Communication, Inc.,\n849 F.2d 570, 575 (11th Cir. 1988). Nevertheless, credibility determinations, the weighing of evidence, and the\ndrawing of inferences from the facts are the function of the jury, and therefore the evidence of the non-movant is\nto be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct.\n2505. The non-movant need not be given the benefit of every inference but only of every reasonable inference. \nBrown v. City of Clewiston, 848 F.2d 1534, 1540 n. 12 (11th Cir.1988).\nUndisputed Facts\nApplying these standards to the evidence now before the court, the following facts appear to be undisputed or, if\ndisputed, are taken in a light most favorable to the non-moving plaintiff.\nOn May 1, 1998, plaintiff was an 18-year student at Hoover High School. After having consumed three beers, she\nwas stopped at a drivers' license checkpoint in Shelby County. She presented the deputies with a valid license,\nbut the deputies suspected she was driving under the influence of alcohol. A search of her car produced a cooler\ncontaining unopened beer. Plaintiff was arrested for the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol and was\ntransported to the Shelby County Jail. At the jail, plaintiff was given two Breathalyzer 5000 tests to determine\nwhether she had excessive levels of alcohol in her system. On both tests, she registered 0.08 percent, which,\nunder Alabama law, creates a presumption of intoxication for purposes of the DUI statute. See Alabama Code §\n[2]\n32-5A-191 et seq. Because the breath tests revealed that she was intoxicated, Alabama law  also required her\nto remain in custody overnight for a period of approximately eleven hours before being released on bond to her\nmother the next morning.\nAfter completing the alcohol breath tests, plaintiff asked to go to the restroom. A female officer was called to\nescort her. The restroom was a small room with no windows, and no one but plaintiff and the female deputy were\n1261 present. The toilet *1261 was open to the room, not shielded in a stall. After plaintiff finished using the toilet, the\nfemale deputy instructed plaintiff to remove all of her clothing, including her bra and panties, to submit for a \"final\ncomplete search.\" When she was completely nude, the female deputy looked into her mouth and ears, touching\nher only once to check behind the plaintiffs ears. \"She checked my breasts and behind my ears and in my mouth\nand my nose. And then she told me to squat and spread my butt apart and cough three times.\" (Plaintiff's\nDeposition at 60). Plaintiff was then allowed to dress in a jail uniform before being placed alone in a cell. Plaintiff's\ncell was adjacent to an area where other female inmates were able to talk to her through the tray slot in the door.\nShe otherwise was not intermingled with other inmates in the jail. She remained alone in the cell from about\n10:30 p.m. the evening of her arrest to 9:30 a.m. the next morning when she was released to her mother.\n\nThere is no evidence that plaintiff had any prior criminal record at the time of her arrest. Sheriff Jones testified\nthat no one had any reason to believe that plaintiff was secreting contraband when arrested (none was found)\nand that she was subjected to a strip search because all arrestees admitted to the general population of the jail\nare so searched to prevent the introduction of contraband. Sheriff Jones promulgated the strip-search policy in\nMarch 1996, and it provides in pertinent part:\nPOLICY:\nIt is the policy of the Shelby County Jail that each inmate be properly searched at the time of\nadmission to the jail.\nPROCEDURE:\nBefore the arrestee begins the booking process, a patdown search of the arrestee will be\nconducted by a same sex jail staff member. This shall be done regardless of the number of times\nthe arrestee might have been searched by the arresting officer.\nAfter the initial patdown search, the booking officer will supervise the inmate while he/she\nremoves all items from his/ her pockets.\nPrior to placing the arrestee in a cell or detention room, a final complete search of the arrestee will\nbe conducted by a same sex jail staff member.\nThe policy statement does not further define or describe a \"final complete search.\" The search applies to all\narrestees admitted to the jail, regardless of the charge against them, their criminal history, or the lack of a reason\nto believe they possess contraband. The articulated reason for the policy is to prevent the introduction of\ncontraband into the jail.\nBecause of the physical configuration of the jail, it appears that female arrestees are subjected to the \"final\ncomplete search,\" although male arrestees are not. Because DUI arrestees cannot be released, even after\nmaking bond, until their blood alcohol content recedes below the legal limit of 0.08 percent (or 0.02 percent for\nanyone younger than 21), most arrestees are required to remain at the jail for a period of several hours after their\narrest. Apparently, only female inmates are actually placed in a cell in the jail's general population and,\nconsequently, are subjected to the strip-search procedure. (Affidavit of Captain Wayne E. Watts). While not\nclearly reflected in the evidence before the court, defense counsel did not object to or refute plaintiff's counsel's\nstatement during the hearing on the motion for summary judgment that male DUI arrestees are held in a\ndetention area in or near the booking room, while female arrestees are admitted to a cell in the general\npopulation of the jail because there is no other area in which to hold them.\nPlaintiff testified that she suffered emotional and mental anguish due to the strip search. She claimed to have\nsuffered from nightmares about police officers at her home for several weeks afterward.\nDiscussion\n1262 Defendant Sheriff Jones has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the \"final *1262 complete search\" was\nreasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment and that he is entitled to qualified immunity from damages.\nBecause the court is first required to determine whether the search described in plaintiff's description constituted\na violation of her rights before considering the defendant's claim of qualified immunity, the issues will be\ndiscussed in that order. Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991).\nI. The Fourth Amendment\nThe Fourth Amendment to the Constitution states:\n\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon\nprobable cause, supported by Oath of affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be\nsearched, and the persons or things to be seized.\nA core concern of the Amendment is protection of the privacy and dignity of the \"persons\" of all Americans, even\nthose arrested and incarcerated. \"The Fourth Amendment applies with its fullest vigor against any intrusions of\nthe human body.\" Allen v. Board of Commissioners of County of Wyandotte, 1991 WL 183554 (D.Kan. 1991) (\nciting Horton v. Goose Creek Independent School District, 690 F.2d 470, 478 (5th Cir.1982)cert. denied463 U.S.\n1207, 103 S.Ct. 3536, 77 L.Ed.2d 1387 (1983)). There is nothing more intrusive and potentially violative of the\nFourth Amendment than being required to stand (or squat) naked before a uniformed officer of the state and\ninspected in the most offensive ways. It has rightly been described as \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified,\nhumiliating, terrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.\" Mary Beth G.\nv. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir.1983) (quoted in Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188,\n192 (11th Cir.1992)).\nThe constitutional touchstone of every search is whether it is \"reasonable\" under the circumstances. Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In Bell, the Supreme Court concluded that\nstrip searches of inmates in the MCC in New York following contact visits were reasonable because of\ninstitutional security concerns about the smuggling of contraband into the jail. This cannot be read, however, as\nvalidation of strip searches of all arrestees under all circumstances. Even in Bell, the Court explained that the\nreasonableness of a strip search is measured by a balancing of the state's need to search against the interest of\nthe arrestee protected by the Fourth Amendment.\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the search against the\ninvasion of the personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the\nparticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). There can be no \"mechanical\"\napplication of a strip search policy because such a rigid approach is the very antithesis of a balancing of the\ninterests involved. A blanket policy requiring the strip search of all arrestees, regardless of the charge against\nthem or the lack of reasonable suspicion that they are secreting contraband, fails to take into account the\n\"justification for initiating\" a search, one of the very factors identified by the Supreme Court.\nBecause strip searches intrude on the most private concerns of people, their bodily privacy, the circuit courts\nhave unanimously rejected blanket policies authorizing strip searches of minor-offense arrestees. Chapman v.\n1263 Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 397 (10th Cir.1993) (\"[U]nanimous circuit authority condemn[s] blanket strip *1263 search\npolicies applied to minor offense detainees.\"). See Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2nd Cir.1986),cert. denied sub\nnom., County of Monroe v. Weber, 483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987); Walsh v. Franco, 849\nF.2d 66 (2nd Cir. 1988); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir.1981),cert. denied,455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct.\n1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982); Stewart v.

Masters, 493 U.S. 977,\n110 S.Ct. 503, 107 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983); Jones v.\nEdwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir.1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984),cert. denied,471 U.S.\n1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985); Ward v. San Diego County, 791 F.2d 1329 (9th Cir. 1986); Hill v.\nBogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir.1984); Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 192 (11th Cir.1992).\nRather, in such cases, the courts have developed a \"reasonable suspicion\" test, which focuses on whether there\nis an objective, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee may be secreting drugs, a weapon, or other contraband on\nor in her body. The mantra of \"institutional security\" alone does not justify such searches. First, the courts have\nconcluded that situations involving an arrest for a minor offense do not entail the same degree of concern for\nsmuggling contraband into the jail as do contact visits with inmates in the jail. Most minor offenses are not usually\nassociated with weapons or contraband. Moreover, an arrest comes as a surprise, reducing the opportunity for\n\nthe arrestee to form a plan (or incentive) for smuggling contraband into the jail. This case is an example: the\nplaintiff here was apparently unaware that she was to be put into the jail until she was handed a jail uniform after\nthe strip search. Second, most jails have the capability of reducing institutional security concerns by limiting or\navoiding intermingling minor-offense arrestees with the general jail population. See Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d\n614, 619 (9th Cir. 1984),cert. denied,471 U.S. 1053, 105 S.Ct. 2114, 85 L.Ed.2d 479 (1985); Masters v. Crouch,\n872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989),cert. denied sub nom., Frey v. Masters, 493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct. 503, 107\nL.Ed.2d 506 (1989). Mere administrative convenience does not justify the invasion of so personal a privacy\ninterest.\nThe Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11th Cir.1992), sheds some light,\nbut not complete illumination, on this case. There, the court of appeals, while acknowledging that they were\ntroubled by it, held \"that law enforcement officers may conduct a strip search of a juvenile in custody, even for a\nminor offense, based upon reasonable suspicion to believe that the juvenile is concealing weapons or\ncontraband.\" Id. at 193. Questions left for this case are whether the \"reasonable suspicion\" test is limited to strip\nsearches of juveniles or does it extend to all arrestees for minor offenses; whether an 18-year-old is a \"juvenile\"\nfor purposes of the holding in the case; and whether the result would be different if the defendant acknowledges\nthat no reasonable suspicion existed that the arrestee was secreting a weapon or contraband, but searched her\nanyway. Ultimately, the court of appeals upheld the strip search in Justice precisely because there was an\nobjective, reasonable suspicion that the juvenile was hiding contraband.\nAfter reviewing the totality of the circumstances in light of what the officers believed as a result of\ntheir training and experience, we hold that the officers possessed a particularized and objective\nbasis for suspecting Simon of hiding contraband on her person. The facts of this case gave the\nofficers a \"reasonable suspicion,\" and thus the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n1264 *1264Id. at 194. Thus, in a very fundamental way, Justice is distinguishable from the instant case in which the\ndefendant admits that no reasonable suspicion existed to search plaintiff and that she was strip searched simply\nbecause the defendant's blanket policy requires all arrestees admitted to the jail to be searched. For the reasons\nexpressed above, this court believes that such a mechanical application of the policy violates the Fourth\nAmendment because it fails to balance the interest of the arrestee in personal privacy against the need to search;\nsimply put, no balancing is done, all are searched.\nThe judges of this court are not unfamiliar with Sheriff Jones's strip search policy at the Shelby County Jail. In \nTami G. Mumpower and Cheryl Rhena Grauel v. Sheriff James Jones, CV-98-J-1097-S, Judge Johnson found\nthat similar strip searches of two women arrested for public intoxication and DUI did not violate their Fourth\nAmendment rights, citing that case's similarity to Magill v. Lee County, 990 F.Supp. 1382 (M.D.Ala.),aff'd,161\nF.3d 22 (11th Cir.1998). Judge Johnson did not address the \"reasonable suspicion\" test articulated in Justice. In \nSandy Skurstenis v. Sheriff James Jones, CV-98-AR-2295-S, Judge Acker found the blanket strip-search policy\n[3]\nto be an unconstitutional violation of the Fourth Amendment when applied to an adult female  arrested for DUI,\nbut concluded that the defendants were shielded from an award of damages by qualified immunity. Judge Acker\nexpressed the opinion that nothing in Justice limited the \"reasonable suspicion\" test simply to strip searches of\njuveniles.\nThe undersigned respectfully disagrees with Judge Johnson and concludes that the strip search of this 18-year-\nold girl, arrested for DUI and with no prior criminal record of any sort, isolated in a cell by herself, and creating no\nreasonable suspicion that she was hiding contraband, violated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from\n\"unreasonable\" searches. Bell continues to stand for the proposition that searches must be reasonable and that\nstrip searches of jail inmates must be based on a balancing of the competing interest of bodily privacy on the one\nhand and jail security on the other. The balance here clearly falls in favor of the plaintiff and against the need for\nthe search. There simply was no justification for it. Defendant admits that his officers had no reasonable\nsuspicion that she was secreting any contraband; she was arrested for a minor offense not usually associated\nwith the danger of introducing jail contraband. Her behavior and demeanor raised no concerns. While in the jail,\nshe was put in a cell alone, limiting if not eliminating any intermingling with the jail population. The danger that\n[4]\nshe might introduce contraband into the jail was so small,  compared to the magnitude of the intrusion on her\nbodily privacy, that the search cannot be found reasonable under Bell, Justice, or the Fourth Amendment.\n1265\n\n*1265 The court offers here a brief note on causation. This is not a case of attempting to impose liability on\nSheriff Jones on the basis of respondeat superior. Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98\nS.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Rather, it is clear that the strip search of the plaintiff was mandated by the\npolicy promulgated by Sheriff Jones. Thus, there is an affirmative link between the constitutional violation and\nacts of the Sheriff, namely the promulgation of the policy requiring the strip search of all arrestees admitted to the\njail, regardless of other circumstances, such as the lack of reasonable suspicion. Sheriff Jones's strip search\npolicy was the moving force behind the search.\nII. Qualified Immunity\nThe undersigned also respectfully disagrees with Judge Acker's assessment that qualified immunity shields the\ndefendant from an award of damages. The law of qualified immunity in the Eleventh Circuit is well understood, if\ndifficult to apply. It is the norm; a public official loses the shield of qualified immunity only if the factual contours of\nthe right allegedly violated were so well-established in concrete terms that no reasonable officer under the\ncircumstances could believe that his actions were lawful. Lassiter v. Alabama A & M University Board of Trustees,\n28 F.3d 1146 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc). Once the official has shown that he was acting within his discretionary\nauthority, the burden is then upon the plaintiff to show that the official's conduct violated clearly established\nfederal statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The law must be clearly established in such a concrete\nand factually defined way that it is obvious to every reasonable person in the defendant's place that what he is\ndoing violates federal law. Nevertheless, in the context of Fourth Amendment cases, qualified immunity can be\nlost if the plaintiff shows that \"the official's conduct lies so obviously at the very core of what the Fourth\nAmendment prohibits that the unlawfulness of the conduct was readily apparent to the official, notwithstanding\nthe lack of caselaw.\" Priester v. City of Riviera Beach, Florida, 208 F.3d 919 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting Smith v.\nMattox, 127 F.3d 1416, 1419 (11th Cir.1997)).\nThe court believes that Sheriff Jones is not entitled to qualified immunity for promulgating a blanket policy\nmandating the strip search of all arrestees admitted to the Shelby County Jail, disregarding the nature of the\ncharge against them, the lack of reasonable suspicion that they may be hiding contraband, and the jail's ability to\nreduce the intermingling of arrestees with the rest of the jail population. Such a policy was contrary to the clear\ninstructions of Bell that searches are reasonable only to the extent that the need to conduct a strip search\noutweighs the fundamental privacy interest of the arrestee. Bell does not stand for the proposition that a blanket\npolicy of strip searching all arrestees under all circumstances is valid. Furthermore, prior to this search in 1998,\nthe Eleventh Circuit's holding in Justice clearly established that juveniles could be strip searched only if\nreasonable suspicion existed to believe they were hiding contraband. At a bare minimum, reasonable suspicion is\nnecessary to warrant such an offensive invasion of bodily privacy. Indeed, all of the circuit court cases cited\nhereinabove, and countless district court cases, have concluded that strips searches of arrestees charged with\nminor offenses can be justified only by an objective, reasonable suspicion focused on the arrestee, not just\ninstitutional concerns. Thus, the court concludes that the law was clearly established in 1998, that a rigid, blanket\npolicy of strip searching all arrestees admitted to the jail violated the Fourth Amendment, and the defendant is not\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n1266 *1266 Alternatively, the court finds that the policy authorizing this strip search lay \"so obviously at the very core of\nwhat the Fourth Amendment prohibits that the unlawfulness of the conduct was readily apparent to the official,\nnotwithstanding the lack of caselaw.\" As mentioned, there is no greater expectation of privacy than that\nassociated with our bodies; far more than any other expectation of privacy in a free society, we expect to avoid\nbeing required to strip naked, squat, spread our buttocks apart, and cough. At the very least, to intrude upon that\nprivacy there must be some reason to do so. The policy promulgated by Sheriff Jones, however, not only allows\nbut requires that intrusion when there is no reason whatsoever to do so, when there is no reasonable suspicion of\ncontraband and no reason to intermingle the arrestee with the jail population. The irrationality of the policy is\nfurther compounded by the fact that it disproportionately impacts women, a fact apparently recognized by Sheriff\nJones. Women arrested for DUI are strip searched and admitted to the jail, while men arrested for DUI are\ndetained in an area outside the jail population without being strip searched. \"Where the strip search of a person is\nconducted pursuant to a policy or a statute encompassing all arrestees and there is no reason to suspect that the\n\nperson is harboring drugs, weapons, or contraband, the search is arbitrary and purposeless, and thus\nunconstitutional.\" Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Department, 901 F.2d 702, 715-716 (9th Cir.1989). That is\nexactly the problem with the policy applied in this search; it was arbitrary and purposeless, lacking any reason for\nsuch an abhorrent invasion of an 18-year-old girl. The policy required a violation of her right to bodily privacy\neven though she was arrested for a non-violent, relatively minor offense, she had no criminal record, the officers\nhad no suspicion that she was hiding anything, and they knew she would be confined in a cell alone. Under these\nfacts, the search required by the policy was unmistakably unconstitutional, a fact readily apparent to any\nreasonable law enforcement officer. The unlawfulness of such a policy, therefore, was readily apparent as a clear\n[5]\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment even if no caselaw is sufficiently similar to this one.\nConclusion\nThe court finds that the defendant's motion for summary judgment is due to be, and hereby is, DENIED. Not only\nwas the strip search of plaintiff a clear violation of her Fourth Amendment expectation of bodily privacy, but the\npolicy under which it was carried out was so clearly unlawful that defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity.\n[1] All other claims against Shelby County, Alabama, were dismissed in the court's order of June 2, 1999.\nLikewise, all state-law claims against Sheriff Jones and all claims against him in his official capacity were\ndismissed on immunity grounds in that order. Finally, separate claims relating to a search of a cooler and the\nattempted removal of a belly-button ring from the plaintiff's navel were dismissed.\n[2] Under Ala.Code § 32-5A-191(1), a person arrested for DUI who is younger than 21 years old may not be\nreleased on bond or otherwise until her blood alcohol content is less than 0.02 percent by weigh of alcohol. The\nvalidity of this statute is not at issue here.\n[3] It is interesting to note that all of these cases involve women. One may be tempted to explain that fact with an\nout-dated, stereotypical notion that women are simply more sensitive to such intrusions on their privacy. It may\nbe, however, as Judge Acker found, that only women are subjected to the strip search policy, while men arrested\nfor similar offenses are not. Captain Watts's affidavit at least implies that, due to facilities limitations at the jail,\nwomen arrested for DUI must be admitted to the jail (and thus strip searched), while men arrested for DUI are not\nadmitted to the jail but detained somewhere outside the general jail population. The court draws this inference\nmost favorably to the plaintiff as required by Rule 56., FRCP, for purposes of defendant's summary judgment\nmotion. It is arguable that such differential treatment bears on the reasonableness of the search under Bell. A\nsearch policy that seems to disproportionately subject women to demeaning strip searches certainly is less\nreasonable than one impacting all without regard to gender.\n[4] Again, the defendant admits that his officers had no reasonable suspicion that she was hiding contraband.\n[5] As pointed out above, however, there is a large body of case law around the country condemning just such\narbitrary and purposeless strip searches. Even a casual reading of the cases cited in this opinion makes plain\nthat a blanket policy of strip searching all arrestees without reference to any reasonable suspicion they are hiding\ncontraband is unconstitutional, and has been so characterized for more than fifteen years.

      "text": "251 F.3d 1340 (2001)\nDeangela WILSON, Plaintiff-Appellee,\nv.\nJames JONES, Sheriff of Shelby County, Defendant-Appellant.\nNo. 00-12827.\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.\nDECIDED May 23, 2001.\n1341 *1341 Frank C. Ellis, Jr., Vonda B. Wallace, Ellis, Fowler & Head, Columbiana, AL, John W. Dodson, Katherine\nClaire White, Ferguson, Frost & Dodson, LLP, Birmingham, AL, for Defendant-Appellant.\nKenneth Lee Cleveland, Cleveland & Cleveland, Birmingham, AL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.\nBefore BARKETT, HILL and KRAVITCH, Circuit Judges.\nKRAVITCH, Circuit Judge:\nIn this appeal, we consider the constitutionality of a strip search performed on Plaintiff DeAngela Wilson, who\nwas detained at the Shelby County Jail after being arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. We agree\nwith the district court's finding that the search, conducted without reasonable suspicion, violated Wilson's rights\nunder the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless, because we hold that Defendant Sheriff James Jones is entitled to\nqualified immunity, we reverse the district court's finding of liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nI. BACKGROUND\nOn May 1, 1998, deputy sheriffs of Shelby County, Alabama arrested Wilson at a license checkpoint for driving\nunder the influence of alcohol. After her arrest, Wilson was taken to the Shelby County Jail, where, due to the\nlevel of alcohol in her blood, she was required to remain until the following morning. Because the Shelby County\nJail does not have separate facilities to hold temporary female detainees, Wilson was placed in a cell within the\ngeneral female population of the jail.\nBefore taking Wilson to her cell, a female corrections officer performed a strip search on Wilson pursuant to\nPolicy Number B-103 of the Shelby County Jail, which requires each arrestee to undergo a \"complete search\"\nprior to admission into the general population of the jail. The officer escorted Wilson to an unoccupied restroom in\nthe jail and, after allowing her to use the restroom, instructed her to disrobe completely, face the wall, squat,\nspread her buttocks, and cough three times. The officer also checked Wilson's ears, mouth, nose and breasts\n1342 during the *1342 search. She did not, however, do a visual or manual inspection of Wilson's body cavities below\n[1]\nthe waist.\nSubsequently, Wilson brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Sheriff Jones, asserting that he violated her\n[2]\nFourth Amendment rights by creating and implementing the policy under which she was searched.  The district\ncourt denied Sheriff Jones's motion to dismiss and his motion for summary judgment, finding (1) that the policy\nrequiring a strip search of all arrestees admitted to the Shelby County Jail was unconstitutional; and (2) that\nSheriff Jones was not entitled to qualified immunity. Sheriff Jones appeals the district court's denial of his motion\nfor summary judgment.\nII. DISCUSSION\nWe review de novo the district court's order denying Sheriff Jones's motion for summary judgment. See Sheth v.\nWebster, 145 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir. 1998). In reviewing the district court's denial of summary judgment, we\n\n\"`must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all, and if\nso, proceed to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.'\" \nMcElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, 1254 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting Conn v. Gabbert, 526 U.S. 286, 290, 119 S.Ct.\n1292, 143 L.Ed.2d 399 (1999)).\nA. Constitutional Violation\nWe begin our discussion with the Supreme Court case of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d\n447 (1979), which held that strip and visual body cavity searches may, in certain instances, be conducted on\ninmates with less than probable cause. In Bell, the Court articulated the balancing test by which courts are to\nevaluate the reasonableness of a particular search:\nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope of\nthe particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the\nplace in which it is conducted.\nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Balancing \"the significant and legitimate security interests of the institution against the\nprivacy interests of the inmates,\" the Bell Court upheld a prison policy requiring inmates to submit to routine strip\nsearches with visual body cavity inspections after each contact visit with a person from outside the institution. Id.\nat 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Despite holding that particular policy constitutional, however, \"Bell v. Wolfish [did] not\nvalidate a blanket policy of strip searching pre-trial detainees.\" Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1253 (6th\nCir.1989).\nRather, \"[t]he Bell balancing test for reasonableness requires at a minimum, that the facts upon which an\n1343 intrusion is based be capable of measurement against an objective standard....\" Justice v.*1343City of\nPeachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 192 (11th Cir.1992) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Courts\nconsidering the issue \"have applied `objective standards' ranging from `reasonable suspicion' to `probable\ncause.'\" Id. (citations omitted). This court recognizes that \"reasonable suspicion\" is sufficient to justify the strip\nsearch of a pretrial detainee. See Skurstenis v. Jones, 236 F.3d 678, 682 (11th Cir.2000); see also Justice, 961\nF.2d at 193 (holding that law enforcement officers \"may conduct a strip search of a juvenile in custody, even for a\nminor offense, based upon reasonable suspicion to believe that the juvenile is concealing weapons or\ncontraband\").\nIn Skurstenis v. Jones, a case decided subsequent to the search of Wilson, we already addressed the\nreasonableness of the policy at the Shelby County Jail. See Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 680-82. Relying on the\nbalancing test articulated in Bell, we determined that Policy Number B-103 violated the Fourth Amendment\n[3]\nbecause it did not require reasonable suspicion as a predicate to strip searching newly admitted detainees. Id.\nat 682 (\"This policy, which does not require any reasonable suspicion, does not comport with the requirements of\n[4]\nthe Fourth Amendment.\").  Nevertheless, we concluded that Plaintiff Skurstenis's Fourth Amendment rights\nwere not violated by a search pursuant to that policy because officers had reasonable suspicion that she was\n[5]\nconcealing a weapon. Id.\nHere, unlike Skurstenis, there is no evidence that the officers at Shelby County Jail had reasonable suspicion that\nWilson was concealing weapons or any other type of contraband. Indeed, as the district court noted, an officer\npermitted Wilson to use the bathroom prior to the search, which indicates a lack of fear that Wilson might flush\nany such substance down the toilet. Moreover, Sheriff Jones testified that \"I don't believe we had a reason to\nsuspect that [Wilson] had any contraband.\"\nBecause Wilson was strip searched absent reasonable suspicion, we hold that the search of Wilson, as well as\nthe jail's policy authorizing her search, violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches\nand seizures. Other circuits addressing this issue have held similar policies unconstitutional. See, e.g., Roberts v.\nRhode Island, 239 F.3d 107 (1st Cir.2001); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393 (10th Cir.1993); Fuller v. M.G.\n\n1344 Jewelry, 950 F.2d 1437 (9th Cir.1991); Masters v.*1344Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248 (6th Cir.1989); Watt v. City of\nRichardson Police Dept., 849 F.2d 195 (5th Cir.1988); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986); Jones v.\nEdwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir.1985); Mary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir.1983).\nB. Qualified Immunity\nHaving established the existence of a constitutional violation, we turn to the issue whether Sheriff Jones is\nentitled to qualified immunity. \"Qualified immunity shields a § 1983 defendant from liability for harms arising from\ndiscretionary acts, as long as the discretionary acts do not violate clearly established federal statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Jackson v. Sauls, 206 F.3d 1156, 1164\n[6]\n(11th Cir.2000).  In analyzing a qualified immunity defense, we are to consider only the \"clearly established law\nand the information possessed by the official at the time the conduct occurred.\" Hope v. Pelzer, 240 F.3d 975,\n981 (11th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \"For qualified immunity to be surrendered,\npre-existing law must dictate, that is, truly compel (not just suggest or allow or raise a question about), the\nconclusion for every like-situated, reasonable government agent that what defendant is doing violates federal law\nin the circumstances.\" Lassiter v. Alabama A & M Univ. Bd. of Trs., 28 F.3d 1146, 1150 (11th Cir.1994). Upon\nreview of the record, we cannot conclude that the preexisting case law \"compels the conclusion\" for every\nreasonable government official in Sheriff Jones's position that the policy at Shelby County Jail violates the Fourth\nAmendment.\nAt the time of Wilson's search, the only controlling cases in this jurisdiction involving strip searches of pretrial\ndetainees were Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979) and Justice v. City of\nPeachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11th Cir.1992). As discussed below, neither of those cases clearly established a\nconstitutional violation on facts \"materially similar\" to those in the present case. See Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1150\n(\"When considering whether the law applicable to certain facts is clearly established, . . . [t]he facts need not be\nthe same as the facts of the immediate case. But they do need to be materially similar.\") (emphasis added)\n(citation omitted).\nIn Bell, as discussed supra, the Supreme Court upheld a federal prison's policy that required pretrial inmates \"to\nexpose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with\na person from outside the institution.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. In justifying the policy based on\nsecurity concerns, the Court emphasized that \"[a] detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security\ndangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence.\" Id. at\n559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Given the language in Bell, it was not unreasonable for someone in Sheriff Jones's position\nto believe that blanket strip searches of newly admitted detainees were justified based on the serious risk that\nsmuggled weapons and other contraband posed to the jail's security. The fact that the Bell Court upheld a search\n1345 that was more intrusive than the one at issue here further *1345 weighs against a conclusion that Bell should\n[7]\nhave put Sheriff Jones on notice that his policy was unconstitutional. See Hill v. Dekalb Reg'l Youth Det. Ctr., 40\nF.3d 1176, 1185 (11th Cir.1994) (\"To be `clearly established,' the federal law by which the government official's\nconduct should be evaluated must be preexisting, obvious and mandatory so that a similarly situated, reasonable\ngovernment agent would be on notice that his or her questioned conduct violates federal law under the\ncircumstances.\") (emphasis added) (citation omitted).\nJustice involved a strip search of a fourteen year old plaintiff who was arrested for minor offenses. See Justice,\n961 F.2d at 189-90. After the plaintiff was arrested, she was taken to a room in the police station and ordered to\nstrip down to her panties even though her mother already had arrived to take her home. Id. at 190. Once the\nofficers completed the search, they released the plaintiff into her mother's custody. Id. In concluding that the strip\nsearch was constitutional, we held that \"law enforcement officers may conduct a strip search of a juvenile in\ncustody, even for a minor offense, based upon reasonable suspicion to believe that the juvenile is concealing\n[8]\nweapons or contraband.\" Id. at 193.\nWilson contends that our decision in Justice gave Sheriff Jones fair warning that strip searching Wilson without\nreasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment. See McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, 1260 (11th\nCir.1999) (\"Qualified immunity is a guarantee of fair warning.\"). Because we perceive a material difference\n\nbetween Justice and the case at hand, we disagree with Wilson's contention. In Justice, unlike the present case,\nthe detainee was not going to be placed in a cell nor put in contact with the general inmate population. Rather,\nshe was to be released to her parents after the search was completed. See Justice, 961 F.2d at 190. In contrast,\nWilson was placed in a cell located within the female cell block, in the general population of the jail, where she\nwas to remain until the following morning. Although Wilson was placed in a cell by herself, to reach her cell, she\nhad to be escorted through an area housing several other female inmates. Furthermore, Wilson testified that\nduring the night, inmates came up and talked to her through a window on her door which was used to pass\nthrough food trays. The detainee in Justice thus posed a lesser risk to the security of the jail than did Wilson, yet\nthe search in Justice was upheld as constitutional. Accordingly, our decision in Justice does not clearly establish\na constitutional violation on facts \"materially similar\" to those in the present case. See Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1150.\nMoreover, following Bell and Justice, but prior to the strip search of Wilson, a district court in the Northern District\nof Alabama specifically found that a strip search conducted pursuant to Sheriff Jones's policy at the Shelby\nCounty Jail did not violate the Fourth Amendment. See Mumpower v. Jones, No. 98-1097, slip op. at 11 (N.D.Ala.\n1346 Apr. 14, 1999). Likewise, a district court from the Middle District of Alabama held that a similar policy *1346 was\njustified based on security concerns. See Magill v. Lee County, 990 F.Supp. 1382, 1392 (M.D.Ala.1998), aff'd 161\n[9]\nF.3d 22 (11th Cir.1998).  Analyzing the precedent set forth in Bell and Justice, the court in Magill explained:\nIf the Supreme Court can approve a strip search and body cavity search procedure on detainees\nwho have had a contact visit with the public, . . . surely this court must approve the present\nsearch. Likewise, if the Eleventh Circuit can approve strip-searches of juveniles who are not even\ngoing to be placed into a cell, this court should approve the present search.\nId. at 1392.\nInasmuch as two district judges had concluded that Sheriff Jones's policy and a similar policy were constitutional,\nit seems unreasonable to hold the sheriff liable for concluding the same. As this court previously has held,\n\"[u]nless a government agent's act is so obviously wrong, in the light of pre-existing law, that only a plainly\nincompetent officer or one who was knowingly violating the law would have done such a thing, the government\nactor has immunity from suit.\" Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1149. In view of the case law discussed above, we cannot say\nthat \"only a plainly incompetent officer or one who was knowingly violating the law,\" would have promulgated the\n[10]\npolicy at issue here. See id.\nTherefore, although we hold that the strip search of Wilson was unconstitutional, we conclude that Sheriff Jones\nis entitled to qualified immunity from liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Accordingly, the district court's entry of\nsummary judgment in favor of Wilson is\nREVERSED.\n[1] The search was conducted in accordance with the policy promulgated by Sheriff Jones and no violations or\ndepartures from that policy are alleged.\n[2] Wilson also sued Shelby County and an unknown Deputy Sheriff. The district court, however, dismissed\nWilson's claims against those parties, as well as her claims against Sheriff Jones in his official capacity. The\ndismissal of those claims is not at issue in this appeal.\n[3] Like Wilson, the detainee searched in Skurstenis, had been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol\nand only remained in the jail overnight. See Skurstenis, 236 F.3d at 680.\n[4] As noted by the district court in Skurstenis, there are important factual differences between Bell and \nSkurstenis which account, in part, for the courts' differing conclusions regarding the challenged policies. See \nSkurstenis v. Jones, 81 F.Supp.2d 1228, 1232 (N.D.Ala.1999),vacated by236 F.3d 678 (11th Cir.2000). The\nmain difference is that, unlike the inmate in Bell, \"Skurstenis had no contact with anyone `outside the institution'\nafter she was arrested, something essential to the decision in Bell .... She was not out of law enforcement\nsupervision from the first moment she was approached by the arresting officer, until her eventual release. She did\nnot meet with any `visitor,' nor did she have any opportunity to acquire or to hide a weapon or other contraband.\" \n\nId. Thus, in Skurstenis, as in the present case, there did not exist the same threat to security that justified the\nroutine search in Bell.\n[5] The court concluded there was reasonable suspicion based on Skurstenis's possession of a .38 Special\nhandgun at the time of her arrest.\n[6] It is undisputed that Sheriff Jones acted within the scope of his discretionary authority.\n[7] In contrast to the search in Bell, Wilson's lower body cavities were not inspected.\n[8] In Justice, we concluded that the \"facts of this case gave the officers a `reasonable suspicion,' and thus the\nsearch did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\" Justice, 961 F.2d at 194.\n[9] Unlike Wilson, the detainees in Magill were not required to remove their underwear as part of the search.\nNevertheless, the court in Magill clarified that it was not \"basing its opinion on the Sheriff's decision to allow the\ninmates to keep on their underwear. The constitutional balancing of the inmate's rights and jail's concerns does\nnot necessarily turn on the issue of whether the inmates are allowed to wear a bra and panties.\" Magill, 990\nF.Supp. at 1390.\n[10] Wilson urges us to consider case law from other circuits in determining whether Sheriff Jones should have\nbeen on notice that his policy was unconstitutional. We decline to do so in light of the two district court opinions\ndiscussed above, which affirmatively upheld the policy at the Shelby County Jail and a policy similar to it. See\nMumpower, No. 98-1097, slip op. at 11; Magill, 990 F.Supp. at 1392.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

Case  No.  CV  %-TMP-.~~ \nSHELBY  COUWTY,  ALABAMA,  et al. \n(11\\t1-'1-'.  \nDefendants. \nJ~\\t \nThis  matter  is  before  the  court  on  defendants'  motion  to \ndismiss~  filed  February  22,  1999.  On  April  23,  1999,  this  court \nentered a  report  and  recommendation,  recommending  that  the  motion \nbe  granted  in  part  and  denied  in  part.  Defendant  Sheriff  James \nJones  filed  obj ections  to  the  report  and  recommendation.  The \nparties  have  consented  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  undersigned \npursuant to 28 U.S.C.  §  636(c) j  consequently,  this court will treat \nthe  objections  as  a  motion  for  reconsideration. \nIn  his  obj ections,  the  Sheriff  argues  that  the  report  and \nrecommendation is based on an erroneous  finding that the plaintiff \nin this case  was  a  juvenile.  It is undisputed that  the plaintiff \nwas  18  years  old at  the  time  of  the  arrest  and  strip search made \nthe  basis  of  her  complaint.  In  support  of  his  contention,  the \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 17     Filed 06/02/1999     Page 2 of 4(cid:10)\nSheriff cites the  definition of  \"child\"  set  forth  in Alabama  Code \n§  12-15-1(3).  This  statute delineates the age  at which a  juvenile \nmay  be  subject  to  the  jurisdiction of  the  juvenile  court.  That \nquestion  is  not  particularly  germane  to  the  issue  before  this \ncourt.  Even so,  that same statute clearly states that,  in Alabama, \nan individual is not an adult until he  reaches  the age of 19.  Ala. \nCode  §  12-15-1 (1) .  This  is  in keeping  with  the  age  of  majority, \nwhich,  under Alabama  law,  also  is 19.  Ala.  Code  §  26-1-1. \nAlabama law consistently has recognized that persons under the \nage of 19 are entitled to certain protections because of their age. \nSee  Ala.  Code  §  6-2-8  (suspending  the  statutes of  limitations  for \nactions  that  accrue  before  the  person  entitled  to  bring  such  an \naction  is  19  years  of  age).  In  this  case,  the  action  is  brought \nnot by DeAngela Wilson herself,  but by her mother and next  friend, \nin  keeping  with  her  legal  status  as  an  infant.  For  purposes  of \nprotecting  the  constitutional  rights  applicable  to  persons \nsubjected  to  strip  searches,  this  court  applies  Alabama's  clear \nmandate  that individuals under 19 are entitled to protections that \nare  not  available  to  those who  are  legally recognized as  adults. \nThe  Sheriff further argues  that this case  is governed by Bell \nv.  Wolfish,  441  U.S.  520  (1979),  rather  than  Justice v.  Peachtree \nCit Y ,  961  F. 2 d  18 8  ( 11th  Ci  r.  1992)  The  distinction relied upon \n2 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 17     Filed 06/02/1999     Page 3 of 4(cid:10)\nby  the  defendant  is  of  no  consequence.  Bell  involved  the  strip \nsearch of adults who  already were  inmates  in a  prison and who  were \nreturning  to  the  jail population  after contact  visits with  those \nfrom  the  outside.  In  this  case the  plaintiff  was  a  juvenile \nr \narrested for a  minor offense who  had no reason to conceal a  weapon \nr \nor  secrete  contraband  on  her  person.  Because  juveniles  are \nentitled to protections above and beyond those given to adults the \nr \ncourt  must  look  to  Justice  for  guidance  as  to  the  limits  of  the \ndefendant  s  authority  to  impose  such  an  invasive  and  traumatic \nr \nsearch  on  the  plaintiff  in this  case.  Justice  requires  that  the \nsearch  of  a  minor  in  custody  be  premised  on  a  \"reasonable \nsuspicion.\"  Reasonable  suspicion is lacking  in this  case. \nBased on the  foregoing and on the undisputed facts and  legal \nr \nconclusions set forth in the report and recommendation this court \nr \nhereby  ORDERS  that  the  motion  for  reconsideration  filed  by \ndefendant  Sheriff  James  Jones  is  due  to  be  and  is hereby  DENIED\nr \nand  that  the  motion  to  dismiss  filed  by  defendants  Shelby  County \nand Sheriff James  Jones  is due  to be  and  is hereby GRANTED  in part \nand DENIED  in part  as  follows: \n1.

OF \nDE' ANGELA WILSON, \nMAY  \"2000 \nPlaintiff, \nvs.  Case No. CV-99-TMP-i-Ht-S. ... '.' ...... '. . _.~._\",'_,_. __ \nSHELBY COUNTY, ALABAMA, \nSHERIFF JAMES JONES, \nDefendants. \nORDER DENYING SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nThis cause is before the court on the motion for summary judgment filed by defendant Sheriff \nJames Jones on February 10, 2000 (Doc. 19). The motion addresses the only claim remaining in this \naction, whether Sheriff Jones's policy of requiring a strip search of all arrestees admitted to the \nShelby County Jail violated the Fourth Amendment right ofthe plaintiff to be free of unreasonable \nsearches.)  The parties have briefed this motion, and oral argument was heard on April 10, 2000. \n) All other claims against Shelby County, Alabama, were dismissed in the court's order \nof June 2, 1999.  Likewise, all state-law claims against Sheriff Jones and all claims against him \nin his official capacity were dismissed on immunity grounds in that order.  Finally, separate \nclaims relating to a search of a cooler and the attempted removal of a belly-button ring from the \nplaintiffs navel were dismissed. \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 2 of 17(cid:10)\nSummary Judgment Standard \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56( c), summary judgment is proper \"ifthe pleadings, \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a \njudgment as a matter oflaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56( c). The party seeking summary judgment \"always \nbears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and \nidentifying those portions of 'the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \non file, together with the affidavits, if any,' which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine \nissue of material fact.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 32~ (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(c)).  The movant can meet this burden by presenting evidence showing there is no dispute of \nmaterial fact, or by showing that the nonmoving party has failed to present evidence in support of \nsome element of its case on which it bears the ultimate burden of proof. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-\n23. There is no requirement, however, \"that the moving party support its motion with affidavits or \nother similar materials negating the opponent's claim.\" Id. at 323. \nOnce the moving party has met his burden, Rule 56(e ) \"requires the nonmoving party to go \nbeyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the 'depositions, answers to interrogatories, \nand admissions of file,' designate' specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. \", Id. \nat 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  The nonmoving party need not present evidence in a form \nnecessary for admission at trial; however, she may not merely rest on her pleadings.  Celotex, 477 \nU.S. at 324.  \"[T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after \nadequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient \n2 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 3 of 17(cid:10)\nto establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will \nbear the burden of proof at trial.\" Id. at 322. \nAfter the plaintiff has properly responded to a proper motion for summary judgment, the \ncourt must grant the motion if there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  The substantive law will identify \nwhich facts are material and which are irrelevant. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby. Inc., 477 U.S. 242, \n248 (1986).  A dispute is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a \nverdict for the nonmoving party.\" MI. at 248.  \"[T]he judge's function is not himself to weigh the \nevidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for \ntrial.\"  Id. at 249.  His guide is the same standard necessary to direct a verdict:  \"whether the \nevidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one \nsided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\"  Id. at 251-52; see also Bill Johnson's \nRestaurants. Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 461 U.S. 731, 745 n.ll (1983). However, the nonmoving party \"must \ndo more than show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\" Matsushita Elec. \nIndus. Co .. Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Cotp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986).  If the evidence is merely \ncolorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted. Anderson, 477 U.S. \nat  249  (citations omitted);  accord Spence v.  Zimmerman,  873  F.2d 256  (l1th Cir.  1989). \nFurthermore, the court must \"view the evidence presented through the prism of the substantive \nevidentiary burden,\" so there must be sufficient evidence on which the jury could reasonably find \nfor the plaintiff.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 254; Cottle v. Storer Communication. Inc., 849 F.2d 570, \n575 (l1th Cir. 1988).  Nevertheless, credibility determinations, the weighing of evidence, and the \n3 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 4 of 17(cid:10)\ndrawing of inferences from the facts are the function ofthejury, and therefore the evidence of the \nnon-movant is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.  Anderson, \n477 U.S. at 255. The non-movant need not be given the benefit of every inference but only of every \nreasonable inference.  Brown v. City of Clewiston, 848 F.2d 1534,1540 n.12 (11th Cir. 1988). \nUndisputed Facts \nApplying these standards to the evidence now before the court, the following facts appear \nto be undisputed or, if disputed, are taken in a light most favorable to the non-moving plaintiff. \nOn May 1, 1998, plaintiff was an 18-year student at Hoover High School.  After having \nconsumed three beers, she was stopped at a drivers' license checkpoint in Shelby County.  She \npresented the deputies with a valid license, but the deputies suspected she was driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol. A search of her car produced a cooler containing unopened beer. Plaintiff was \narrested for the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol and was transported to the Shelby \nCounty Jail.  At the jail, plaintiff was given two Breathalyzer 5000 tests to determine whether she \nhad excessive levels of alcohol in her system.  On both tests, she registered 0.08 percent, which, \nunder Alabama law, creates a presumption of intoxication for purposes of the DUI statute.  See \nAlabama Code § 32-5A-191 et seq.  Because the breath tests revealed that she was intoxicated, \n4 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 5 of 17(cid:10)\nAlabama law2 also required her to remain in custody overnight for a period of approximately eleven \nhours before being released on bond to her mother the next morning. \nAfter completing the alcohol breath tests, plaintiff asked to go to the restroom.  A female \nofficer was called to escort her.  The restroom was a small room with no windows, and no one but \nplaintiff and the female deputy were present. The toilet was open to the room, not shielded in a stall. \nAfter plaintiff finished using the toilet, the female deputy instructed plaintiff to remove all of her \nclothing, including her bra and panties, to submit for a \"final complete search.\"  When she was \ncompletely nude, the female deputy looked into her mouth and ears, touching her only once to check \nbehind the plaintiffs ears.  \"She checked my breasts and behind my ears and in my mouth and my \nnose.  And then she told me to squat and spread my butt apart and cough three times.\" (Plaintiffs \nDeposition at 60). Plaintiff was then allowed to dress in ajail uniform before being placed alone in \na cell.  Plaintiffs cell was adjacent to an area where other female inmates were able to talk to her \nthrough the tray slot in the door.  She otherwise was not intermingled with other inmates in the jail. \nShe remained alone in the cell from about 10:30 p.m. the evening of her arrest to 9:30 a.m. the next \nmorning when she was released to her mother. \nThere is no evidence that plaintiff had any prior criminal record at the time of her arrest. \nSheriff Jones testified that no one had any reason to believe that plaintiffwas secreting contraband \nwhen arrested (none was found) and that she was subjected to a strip search because all arrestees \n2  Under Ala. Code § 32-5A-191(l), a person arrested for DUI who is younger than 21 \nyears old may not be released on bond or otherwise until her blood alcohol content is less than \n0.02 percent by weigh of alcohol.  The validity ofthis statute is not at issue here. \n5 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 6 of 17(cid:10)\nadmitted to the general population of the jail are so searched to prevent the introduction of \ncontraband.  Sheriff Jones promulgated the strip-search policy in March 1996, and it provides in \npertinent part: \nPOLICY: \nIt is the policy ofthe Shelby County Jail that each inmate be properly searched at the \ntime of admission to the jail. \nPROCEDURE: \nBefore the arrestee begins the booking process, a patdown search of the arrestee will \nbe conducted by a same sex jail staff member.  This shall be done regardless of the \nnumber oftimes the arrestee might have been searched by the arresting officer. \nAfter the initial patdown search, the booking officer will supervise the inmate while \nhe/she removes all items from his/her pockets. \nPrior to placing the arrestee in a cell or detention room, a final complete search ofthe \narrestee will be conducted by a same sex jail staff member. \nThe policy statement does not further define or describe a \"final complete search.\"  The search \napplies to all arrestees admitted to the jail, regardless of the charge against them, their criminal \nhistory, or the lack of a reason to believe they possess contraband.  The articulated reason for the \npolicy is to prevent the introduction of contraband into the jail. \nBecause ofthe physical configuration ofthe jail, it appears that female arrestees are subjected \nto the \"final complete search,\" although male arrestees are not.  Because DUI arrestees cannot be \nreleased, even after making bond, until their blood alcohol content recedes below the legal limit of \n0.08 percent (or 0.02 percent for anyone younger than 21), most arrestees are required to remain at \n6 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 7 of 17(cid:10)\nthe jail for a period of several hours after their arrest. Apparently, only female inmates are actually \nplaced in a cell in the jail's general population and, consequently, are subjected to the strip-search \nprocedure.  (Affidavit of Captain Wayne E. Watts).  While not clearly reflected in the evidence \nbefore the court, defense counsel did not obj ect to or refute plaintiff s counsel's statement during the \nhearing on the motion for summary judgment that male DUI arrestees are held in a detention area \nin or near the booking room, while female arrestees are admitted to a cell in the general population \nof the jail because there is no other area in which to hold them. \nPlaintifftestified that she suffered emotional and mental anguish due to the strip search. She \nclaimed to have suffered from nightmares about police officers at her home for several weeks \nafterward. \nDiscussion \nDefendant Sheriff Jones has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the \"final comp lete \nsearch\" was reasonable and did not violate the Fourth Amendment and that he is entitled to qualified \nimmunity from damages.  Because the court is first required to determine whether the search \ndescribed in plaintiffs description constituted a violation of her rights before considering the \ndefendant's claim of qualified immunity, the issues will be discussed in that order.  Siegert v. \nGilley, 500 U.S. 226, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991). \n1.  The Fourth Amendment \nThe Fourth Amendment to the Constitution states: \n7 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 8 of 17(cid:10)\nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants \nshall issue,  but upon probable cause,  supported by Oath of affinnation,  and \nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be \nseized. \nA core concern of the Amendment is protection of the privacy and dignity of the \"persons\" of all \nAmericans, even those arrested and incarcerated. \"The Fourth Amendment applies with its fullest \nvigor against any intrusions of the human body.\" Allen v. Board of Commissioners ofthe County \nof Wyandotte, 1991 WL 183554 (D. Kansas 1991) (citing Horton v. Goose Creek Independent \nth \nSchool District, 690 F.2d 470, 478 (5 Cir. 1982) cert. denied 436 U.S. 1207 (1983)).  There is \nnothing more intrusive and potentially violative ofthe Fourth Amendment than being required to \nstand (or squat) naked before a unifonned officer of the state and inspected in the most offensive \nways.  It has rightly been described as \"demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, \nterrifying, unpleasant, embarrassing, repulsive, signifying degradation and submission.\" Mary Beth \nG. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983) (quoted in Justice v. City of Peachtree \nCity, 961 F.2d 188, 192 (11th Cir. 1992). \nThe constitutional touchstone of every search is whether it is \"reasonable\" under the \ncircumstances. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861,60 L.Ed. 2d447 (1979). In Bell, \nthe Supreme Court concluded that strip searches of inmates in the MCC in New York following \ncontact visits were reasonable because of institutional security concerns about the smuggling of \ncontraband into the jail. This cannot be read, however, as validation of strip searches of all arrestees \nunder all circumstances. Even in Bell, the Court explained that the reasonableness of a strip search \n8 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 9 of 17(cid:10)\nis measured by a balancing ofthe state's need to search against the interest ofthe arrestee protected \nby the Fourth Amendment. \nThe test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise \ndefinition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing ofthe need \nfor the search against the invasion of the personal rights that the search entails. \nCourts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed. 2d 447 (1979).  There can be no \n\"mechanical\" application of a strip search policy because such a rigid approach is the very antithesis \nof a balancing of the interests involved. A blanket policy requiring the strip search of all arrestees, \nregardless of the charge against them or the lack of reasonable suspicion that they are secreting \ncontraband, fails to take into account the \"justification for initiating\" a search, one ofthe very factors \nidentified by the Supreme Court. \nBecause strip searches intrude on the most private concerns of people, their bodily privacy, \nthe circuit courts have unanimously rejected blanket policies authorizing strip searches of minor-\noffense arrestees.  Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 397 (lOth Cir. 1993) (\"[U[nanimous circuit \nauthority condemn[ s] blanket strip search policies applied to minor offense detainees. \"). See Weber \nv.

Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. \nth \n1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 942 (1982); Stewart v. County of Lubbock, 767 F.2d 153 (5 Cir. \n1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1066 (l986); Watt v. City of Richardson Police Department, 849 F.2d \n9 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 10 of 17(cid:10)\n195 (5th Cir. 1988); Masters v.

Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir. 1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984), \ncert. denied, 471 U.S. 1053 (1985); Ward v. San Diego County, 791 F.2d l329 (9th Cir. 1986); Hill \nv. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (lOth Cir. 1984); Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188, 192 (11 th \nCir. 1992).  Rather, in such cases, the courts have developed a \"reasonable suspicion\" test, which \nfocuses on whether there is an objective, reasonable suspicion that the arrestee may be secreting \ndrugs, a weapon, or other contraband on or in her body. The mantra of \"institutional security\" alone \ndoes not justify such searches.  First, the courts have concluded that situations involving an arrest \nfor a minor offense do not entail the same degree of concern for smuggling contraband into the jail \nas do contact visits with inmates in the jail.  Most minor offenses are not usually associated with \nweapons or contraband.  Moreover, an arrest comes as a surprise, reducing the opportunity for the \narrestee to form a plan (or incentive) for smuggling contraband into the j ail. This case is an example: \nthe plaintiff here was apparently unaware that she was to be put into the jail until she was handed \na j ail uniform after the strip search. Second, most jails have the capability of reducing institutional \nsecurity concerns by limiting or avoiding intermingling minor-offense arrestees with the generaljail \npopulation. See Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614,619 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1053 \n(1985); Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied sub nom., Frey v. \nMasters, 493 U.S. 977 (1989). Mere administrative convenience does not justify the invasion of so \npersonal a privacy interest. \n10 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 11 of 17(cid:10)\nThe Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Justice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11 th Cir. \n1992), sheds some light, but not complete illumination, on this case.  There, the court of appeals, \nwhile acknowledging that they were troubled by it, held \"that law enforcement officers may conduct \na strip search of a juvenile in custody, even for a minor offense, based upon reasonable suspicion to \nbelieve that the juvenile is concealing weapons or contraband.\" rd. at 193.  Questions left for this \ncase are whether the \"reasonable suspicion\" test is limited to strip searches of juveniles or does it \nextend to all arrestees for minor offenses; whether an 18-year-old is a \"juvenile\" for purposes ofthe \nholding in the case; and whether the result would be different if the defendant acknowledges that \nno reasonable suspicion existed that the arrestee was secreting a weapon or contraband, but searched \nher anyway.  Ultimately, the court of appeals upheld the strip search in Justice precisely because \nthere was an objective, reasonable suspicion that the juvenile was hiding contraband. \nAfter reviewing the totality ofthe circumstances in light ofw  hat the officers believed \nas a result of their training and experience, we hold that the officers possessed a \nparticularized and objective basis for suspecting Simon of hiding contraband on her \nperson. The facts oft his case gave the officers a \"reasonable suspicion,\" and thus the \nsearch did not violate the Fourth Amendment. \nrd. at 194. Thus, in a very fundamental way, Justice is distinguishable from the instant case in which \nthe defendant admits that no reasonable suspicion existed to search plaintiff and that she was strip \nsearched simply because the defendant's blanket policy requires all arrestees admitted to the jail to \nbe searched. For the reasons expressed above, this court believes that such a mechanical application \n11 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 12 of 17(cid:10)\nof the policy violates the Fourth Amendment because it fails to balance the interest of the arrestee \nin personal privacy against the need to search; simply put, no balancing is done, all are searched. \nThe judges of this court are not unfamiliar with Sheriff Jones's strip search policy at the \nShelby County Jail. In Tami G. Mumpower and Cheryl Rhena Grauel v. Sheriff James Jones, CV-\n98-J-1097-S, Judge Johnson found that similar strip searches of two women arrested for public \nintoxication and DUI did not violate their Fourth Amendment rights, citing that case's similarity to \nMagill v. Lee County, 990 F.Supp. 1382 (M.D. Ala), aft'd, 161 F.3d 22 (1 ph Cir. 1998).  Judge \nJohnson did not address the \"reasonable suspicion\" test articulated in Justice. In Sandy Skurstenis \nv. SheriffJames Jones, CV- 98-AR-2295-S, Judge Acker found the blanket strip-search policy to be \nan unconstitutional violation ofthe Fourth Amendment when applied to an adult female3 arrested \nfor DUI, but concluded that the defendants were shielded from an award of damages by qualified \nimmunity.  Judge Acker expressed the opinion that nothing in Justice limited the \"reasonable \nsuspicion\" test simply to strip searches of juveniles. \n3  It is interesting to note that all ofthese cases involve women.  One may be tempted to \nexplain that fact with an out-dated, stereotypical notion that women are simply more sensitive to \nsuch intrusions on their privacy. It may be, however, as Judge Acker found, that only women are \nsubjected to the strip search policy, while men arrested for similar offenses are not.  Captain \nWatts's affidavit at least implies that, due to facilities limitations at the jail, women arrested for \nDUI must be admitted to the jail (and thus strip searched), while men arrested for DUI are not \nadmitted to the j ail but detained somewhere outside the general jail population.  The court draws \nthis inference most favorably to the plaintiff as required by Rule 56., FRCP, for purposes of \ndefendant's summary judgment motion. It is arguable that such differential treatment bears on \nthe reasonableness of the search under Bell.  A search policy that seems to disproportionately \nsubject women to demeaning strip searches certainly is less reasonable than one impacting all \nwithout regard to gender. \n12 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 13 of 17(cid:10)\nThe undersigned respectfully disagrees with Judge Johnson and concludes that the strip \nsearch of this 18-year-old girl, arrested for DUI and with no prior criminal record of any sort, \nisolated in a cell by herself, and creating no reasonable suspicion that she was hiding contraband, \nviolated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from \"unreasonable\" searches.  Bell continues to \nstand for the proposition that searches must be reasonable and that strip searches ofj ail inmates must \nbe based on a balancing ofthe competing interest of bodily privacy on the one hand and jail security \non the other.  The balance here clearly falls in favor of the plaintiff and against the need for the \nsearch.  There simply was no justification for it.  Defendant admits that his officers had no \nreasonable suspicion that she was secreting any contraband; she was arrested for a minor offense not \nusually associated with the danger ofi ntroducingjail contraband. Her behavior and demeanor raised \nno concerns.  While in the jail, she was put in a cell alone, limiting if not eliminating any \nintermingling with the jail popUlation. The danger that she might introduce contraband into the jail \nwas so smalI,4 compared to the magnitude of the intrusion on her bodily privacy, that the search \ncannot be found reasonable under Bell, Justice, or the Fourth Amendment. \nThe court offers here a brief note on causation.  This is not a case of attempting to impose \nliability on Sheriff Jones on the basis of respondeat superior.  Monell v. Department of Social \nServices, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct 2018,.56 L.Ed. 2d 611 (1978). Rather, it is clear that the strip search \nof the plaintiff was mandated by the policy promulgated by Sheriff Jones.  Thus, there is an \naffirmative link between the constitutional violation and acts ofthe Sheriff, namely the promulgation \n4 Again, the defendant admits that his officers had no reasonable suspicion that she was \nhiding contraband. \n13 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 14 of 17(cid:10)\nof the policy requiring the strip search of all arrestees admitted to the jail, regardless of other \ncircumstances, such as the lack of reasonable suspicion. SheriffJones's strip search policy was the \nmoving force behind the search. \nII.  Oualified Immunity \nThe undersigned also respectfully disagrees with Judge Acker's assessment that qualified \nimmunity shields the defendant from an award of damages.  The law of qualified immunity in the \nEleventh Circuit is well understood, if difficult to apply.  It is the norm; a public official loses the \nshield of qualified immunity only ifthe factual contours ofthe right allegedly violated were so well \nestablished in concrete terms that no reasonable officer under the circumstances could believe that \nhis actions were lawful.  Lassiter v. Alabama A&M University Board of Trustees, 28 F.3d 1146 \n(11th Cir. 1994) (en banc). Once the official has shown that he was acting within his discretionary \nauthority, the burden is then upon the plaintiff to show that the official's conduct violated clearly \nestablished federal statutory or constitutional rights ofw  hich a reasonab Ie person would have known. \nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed. 2d 396 (1982).  The law must be \nclearly established in such a concrete and factually defined way that it is obvious to every reasonable \nperson in the defendant's place that what he is doing violates federal law.  Nevertheless, in the \ncontext of Fourth Amendment cases, qualified immunity can be lost ifthe plaintiff shows that \"the \nofficial's conduct lies so obviously at the very core of what the Fourth Amendment prohibits that \nthe unlawfulness of the conduct was readily apparent to the official, notwithstanding the lack of \n14 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 15 of 17(cid:10)\ncaselaw.\" Priesterv. City ofR  iviera Beach, Florida,_F.3d_(11 th Cir., April 4, 2000) (quoting \nSmith v. Mattox, 127 F.3d 1416, 1419 (1 ph Cir. 1997». \nThe court believes that Sheriff Jones is not entitled to qualified immunity for promulgating \na blanket policy mandating the strip search of all arrestees admitted to the Shelby County Jail, \ndisregarding the nature of the charge against them, the lack of reasonable suspicion that they may \nbe hiding contraband, and the jail's ability to reduce the intermingling of arrestees with the rest of \nthe jail population.  Such a policy was contrary to the clear instructions of Bell that searches are \nreasonable only to the extent that the need to conduct a strip search outweighs the fundamental \nprivacy interest of the arrestee. Bell does not stand for the proposition that a blanket policy of strip \nsearching all arrestees under all circumstances is valid.  Furthermore, prior to this search in 1998, \nthe Eleventh Circuit's holding in Justice clearly established that juveniles could be strip searched \nonly if reasonable suspicion existed to believe they were hiding contraband.  At a bare minimum, \nreasonable suspicion is necessary to warrant such an offensive invasion of bodily privacy. Indeed, \nall ofthe circuit court cases cited hereinabove, and countless district court cases, have concluded that \nstrips searches of arrestees charged with minor offenses can be justified only by an objective, \nreasonable suspicion focused on the arrestee, not just institutional concerns.  Thus, the court \nconcludes that the law was clearly established in 1998, that a rigid, blanket policy of strip searching \nall arrestees admitted to the jail violated the Fourth Amendment, and the defendant is not entitled \nto qualified immunity. \nAlternatively, the court finds that the policy authorizing this strip search lay \"so obviously \nat the very core of what the Fourth Amendment prohibits that the unlawfulness of the conduct was \n15 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 16 of 17(cid:10)\nreadily apparent to the official, notwithstanding the lack of caselaw.\"  As mentioned, there is no \ngreater expectation of privacy than that associated with our bodies; far more than any other \nexpectation of privacy in a free society, we expect to avoid being required to strip naked, squat, \nspread our buttocks apart, and cough.  At the very least, to intrude upon that privacy there must be \nsome reason to do so.  The policy promulgated by Sheriff Jones, however, not only allows but \nrequires that intrusion when there is no reason whatsoever to do so, when there is no reasonable \nsuspicion of contraband and no reason to intermingle the arrestee with the jail popUlation.  The \nirrationality of the policy is further compounded by the fact that it disproportionately impacts \nwomen, a fact apparently recognized by Sheriff Jones. Women arrested for DUI are strip searched \nand admitted to the jail, while men arrested for DUI are detained in an area outside the jail \npopulation without being strip searched. \"Where the strip search of a person is conducted pursuant \nto a policy or a statute encompassing all arrestees and there is no reason to suspect that the person \nis harboring drugs, weapons, or contraband, the search is arbitrary and purposeless, and thus \nunconstitutional.\"  Kennedy v. Los Angeles Police Department, 901 F.2d 702, 715-716 (9th Cir. \n1989).  That is exactly the problem with the policy applied in this search; it was arbitrary and \npurposeless, lacking any reason for such an abhorrent invasion of an 18-year-old girl.  The policy \nrequired a violation of her right to bodily privacy even though she was arrested for a non-violent, \nrelatively minor offense, she had no criminal record, the officers had no suspicion that she was \nhiding anything, and they knew she would be confined in a cell alone. Under these facts, the search \nrequired by the policy was unmistakably unconstitutional, a fact readily apparent to any reasonable \n16 \n\nCase 2:99-cv-00110-TMP     Document 28     Filed 05/04/2000     Page 17 of 17(cid:10)\nlaw enforcement officer.  The unlawfulness of such a policy, therefore, was readily apparent as a \nclear violation of the Fourth Amendment even ifno caselaw is sufficiently similar to this one.5 \nConclusion \nThe court finds that the defendant's motion for summary judgment is due to be, and hereby \nis, DENIED. Not only was the strip search of plaintiff a clear violation of her Fourth Amendment \nexpectation of bodily privacy, but the policy under which it was carried out was so clearly unlawful \nthat defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity. \nThe Clerk is DIRECTED to forward a copy of this Order to all counsel of record. \nJ..{t!J \nDONE this  day of May, 2000. \n~ \n~ \nCHIEF MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n5  As pointed out above, however, there is a large body of case law around the country \ncondemning just such arbitrary and purposeless strip searches.  Even a casual reading of the \ncases cited in this opinion makes plain that a blanket policy of strip searching all arrestees \nwithout reference to any reasonable suspicion they are hiding contraband is unconstitutional, and \nhas been so characterized for more than fifteen years.
