Subject to order of a court, and limits on expenditure per case by a court, this compensation shall be $90 an hour for both in−court and out−of−court time. For any single case, compensation shall not exceed $1,500, subject to order of a court.\" Paragraph 15 is superseded by the following: \"This preliminary injunction shall automatically terminate on 7/1/2004, subject to further court order.\" (Signed by Judge Jack B.

    "summary": "<p>The plaintiffs in this case are mothers in New York who have been subjected to domestic violence, and as a result, had the Administration for Children's Services (ACS) remove their children from their custody.  Represented by the Sanctuary for Families, Lawyers for Children, and the New York Legal Aid Society, they each brought suit, separately, in 2000 in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, against ACS.  Their cases were then consolidated and converted to a class action in January 2001, against the state, the state Office of Children and Family Services, the city of New York, and the city Administration for Children's Services (ACS).  The plaintiffs claimed violations of Constitutional rights, including the First, Fourth, Ninth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and violations of federal and state law, including the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. § 675; the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 18 U.S.C. § 2261; and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act Amendments of 1984, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5101-5106.</p><p>Plaintiffs moved for class certification in January 2001. Judge Jack B. Weinstein pushed for an expedited trial schedule and consideration of preliminary injunctions, regardless of a final class certification decision, because of serious charges made of deprivation of constitutional rights to custody of children. After numerous hearings of testimonies supporting the claims of the mothers, in July 2001 the court certified the class with two subclasses in order to avoid a conflict of interest between mothers and children. Subclass A consisted of all persons subject to domestic violence or its threat who are custodians of children if the children were not themselves physically harmed and if the children are sought to be removed by ACS. Subclass B consisted of all children in the custody of a custodian in Subclass A who have been removed or are likely to be removed by ACS and has not been returned to the custodian as soon as possible. Nicholson v. Williams, 205 F.R.D. 377 (E.D.N.Y. 2001).</p><p>On July 9, 2001, a trial commenced to determine whether and in what form a preliminary injunction should issue. Trial lasted for twenty-four days and over forty-four witnesses testified. After trial concluded at the end of December, the court issued a preliminary injunction. The court prohibited ACS from separating a mother, not otherwise unfit, from her children on the basis that, as a victim of domestic violence, she was considered to have \"engaged in\" domestic violence. Additionally, the court required ACS to increase compensation for attorneys appointed to represent mothers threatened with separation from their children in order to allow for adequate representation of the mothers. Judge Weinstein noted the praiseworthy improvement ACS made to rectify continuing injustices, but nevertheless found that the defendants' constitutional violations, i.e. the separation of children from their families without due process, \"may hinder parent-child bonding, interfere with a child's ability to relate well to others, and deprive the child of the essential loving affection critical to emotional maturity.\" In re Nicholson, 181 F. Supp. 2d 182, 185 (E.D.N.Y. 2002).</p><p>In January 2002, the court stayed the injunction until June 2002, except for the requirement that the defendant ACS produce monthly reports on steps it was taking to protect the subclasses' rights.</p><p>Meanwhile, in an extensive opinion over 100 pages, the court clarified its initial December order and preliminary injunction,  and identified modern perspectives on domestic violence and child welfare. After considering the facts of the plaintiff mothers' stories, and the views of experts, the court opined that best practices require that mothers should not be accused of neglect for being victims of domestic violence; batterers should be held accountable; children should be protected by offering battered mothers appropriate services and protection; separation of battered mothers and children should be the alternative of last resort; child welfare employees should be adequately trained to deal with domestic violence; and agency policy should provide clear guidelines to caseworkers.  Judge Weinstein found that ACS policies and practices rarely employed any of these best practices, nothing that \"[c]hildren's welfare, the state interest which is so often the great counterweight deployed to justify state interference in family affairs, has virtually disappeared from the equation in the case of ACS's practices and policies regarding abused mothers.\" Nicholson v. Williams, 203 F. Supp. 2d 153, 254 (E.D.N.Y. 2002)</p><p>The defendants appealed, and the plaintiffs cross-appealed. The defendants appealed certain provisions of the preliminary injunction, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the motion for a stay of the injunction. While the appeal before the Second Circuit was pending, all four plaintiffs accepted judgments plus reasonable costs and attorney's fees. The cross-appeals of the plaintiffs were withdrawn as moot.  </p><p>Additionally, Circuit Judge Katzman for the Second Circuit concluded that the federal constitutional questions may be substantially altered by controlling state law. Thus, the Second Circuit submitted a certification of questions of state law to the New York Court of Appeals. Nicholson v. Scoppetta, 344 F.3d 154 (2d Cir. 2003). The New York Court of Appeals answered the questions, finding that a child's exposure to domestic violence against their caretaker is insufficient to constitute neglect under New York state law. Nicholson v. Scopetta, 820 N.E.2d 840 (N.Y. 2004). Thus, the Second Circuit remanded the case to the District Court. Nicholson v. Scopetta, 116 F. App'x 313 (2d Cir. 2004). Meanwhile, the District Court had extended the preliminary injunction until October 2004.</p><p>In December 2004, the Court found that ACS had substantially complied with the terms of the preliminary injunction and the City stated its intention to comply with the New York Court of Appeals decision. Thus, the parties settled by stipulation to terminate the preliminary injunction on December 31, 2004, and that the case would be dismissed with prejudice in September 2005 unless the plaintiffs moved to restore the case before that time. The plaintiffs did not move to restore the case, and the Second Circuit dismissed as moot any remaining appeals. After months of negotiations, the court settled the matter of attorneys' fees in March 2007.</p>",

Such complaints shall be made in writing \n2 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02229-JBW-CLP     Document 574      Filed 12/17/2004     Page 3 of 6\nto the ACS Deputy Commissioner for Family Court Legal Services (or the person \nfulfilling the comparable responsibility if such position is no longer in existence) \nor hislher designee, with copies simultaneously provided to an identified attorney \nin the Office of the Corporation Counsel. The Deputy Commissioner or hislher \ndesignee  will  promptly  investigate  the  complaint  and  respond  in  writing  to \nplaintiffs within ten business days of receiving plaintiffs' complaint, except that if \nthe complaint involved the removal or threatened removal of a child or children \nwithout court order, the response shall be made within three business days of \nreceiving plaintiffs'  complaint.  Defendants  shall  make  a  good  faith  effort to \nresolve the complaint in accordance with the decision of the New York Court of \nAppeals. \n5.  Plaintiffs may restore this action to the active calendar upon a failure of ACS \nto establish the mechanism set out in paragraph 4 of this stipulation and order, solely for the \npurpose of compelling ACS to establish such a mechanism. \n6.  On September 1, 2005, plaintiffs' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief \nshall be dismissed with prejudice unless, before that time, plaintiffs move to restore the case to \nthe Court's active docket on a showing that, as to the filing of petitions against, or the removal of \nchildren from, victims of domestic violence, defendants have failed to act, on a systemic basis, \nconsistent with the decision of the Court of Appeals in Nicholson.  In the event of any such \nmotion, plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants' failures or omissions were not minimal or \nisolated, but were substantial and sufficiently frequent or widespread as to be systemic.  This \ndismissal will not bar plaintiff class members from commencing actions  for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief for alleged violations of law occurring after September I, 2005. \n7. Plaintiffs shall only be entitled to, and shall be awarded, reasonable attorneys' \nfees for work performed through December 31, 2004, plus reasonable fees on the fee application, \npursuant to  42  U.S.C.  § 1988, as prevailing parties in this litigation.  Defendants waive any \n3 \n\nCase 1:00-cv-02229-JBW-CLP     Document 574      Filed 12/17/2004     Page 4 of 6\nchallenge to plaintiffs' right to fees for work perfonned in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals \nand the New York Court of Appeals, and agree that the only challenge which they will raise to \nplaintiffs' application is to the amount of the fees.  Plaintiff Subclasses A and B shall provide \ndefendants with all records or other documents supporting their fee claims on or before January \n21, 2005.  Because of the unavailability of records due to the events of September 11, 2001, \nPlaintiff Subclass B shall be pennitted to use reconstructed time records for all time prior to \nApril  15,  2002.  Notwithstanding paragraph  6  of this  stipulation  and  order,  the claims  for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief shall not be dismissed and the case shall remain on the court's \nsuspense calendar until the detennination and payment of attorneys' fees to plaintiffs. \n8. No provision of this stipulation will prohibit any class member from bringing \nan individual lawsuit seeking damages for alleged violations of State or federal law. \nDated: New York, New York \nDecember 16, 2004 \nMICHAEL A.

WEINSTEIN, Senior District Judge: \nSubclasses A and B move to extend a preliminary injunction requiring changes by \ndefendants in their treatment of abused mothers and thcir children.  Defendants oppose. \nAfter a hearing, the motion is granted, extending the injunction until July 1. 2004, \nwith one exception.  The parties may apply for earlier modification, termination, or extension. \nThis Order modifies and supplements thc Amended Memorandum, Order and Preliminary \nInjunction, dated January 3, 2002 (\"preliminary injunction\").  See Nicholson v. Williams, 181 \nF.Supp.2d 182 (E.D.N.Y. 2002).  Without this Order, the original preliminary injunction would \nhave terminatcd automatically on January 31, 2004.  See id. at 193. \nThe reccnt New York State law increasing compensation for appointed attorneys \nbecomes effective on January 1, 2004,  See New York State Budget Bill A.2106-BfS.l406-B, \nPart J, § 2 (2003).  TIle provision of the preliminary injunction setting compensation for attorneys \nin Family Court at $90 an hour can bc tenninated as of December 31, 2003 without undue harm \nto plaintiffs.  While ensuring adequate protection ofthe constitutional rights of plaintiffs, federal \ncourts should intervene in state court procedures and fiscal arrangements as little as possible. \nArguably, the compensation provided for appointed attorneys under the new state plan will meet \nthe needs of plaintiffs for adequate legal protection. \nThe parties, with the aid of the Nicholson Revicw Committee, have substantially \nimproved their treatment of abused mothers and their children.

Yet nothing in the plain language of article \nFootnotes \n \n1  “ACS” includes all named city defendants, including the City of New York. Apart from defendant John Johnson (Commissioner of \nthe State Office of Children and Family Services, which oversees ACS), state officials are named in the complaint with respect to \n \nthe assigned counsel portion of the case, which is not before us. \n \n2  The District Court cited the testimony of a child protective manager that it was common practice in domestic violence cases for \nACS to wait a few days before going to court after removing a child because “after a few days of the children being in foster care, \n \nthe mother will usually agree to ACS’s conditions for their return without the matter ever going to court” (203 F.Supp.2d at 170). \n \n3  The injunction was stayed for six months to permit ACS to attempt reform on its own, free of the court’s involvement, and to \nallow for an appeal. Thereafter, the City and ACS appealed, challenging the District Court’s determination. The Second Circuit \n \ndenied the City’s request for an additional stay pending appeal. \n \n4  Chief Judge Walker dissented, concluding that the injunction should be vacated because the evidence did not support the District \nCourt’s findings underpinning the injunction. In his view, the District Court’s central factual finding that ACS had a policy of \n \nregularly separating battered mothers and children unnecessarily was “simply unsustainable” (id. at 177). \n \n5  We are not asked to, nor do we, apply our answers to the trial record, though recognizing that in the inordinately complex \nhuman dilemma presented by domestic violence involving children, the law may be easier to state than apply. \n \n \n6  The Legislature has recognized this “quandary” that a victim of domestic violence encounters (Senate Mem. in Support, 2002 \nMcKinney’s Session Laws of N.Y., at 1861). To avoid punitive responses from child protective services agencies, the Legislature \n \nattempted to increase awareness of child protective agencies of the dynamics of domestic violence and its impact on child \nprotection by amending the Social Services Law to mandate comprehensive domestic violence training for child protective \nservices workers (id.). \n10 \n \n\nNicholson v. Scoppetta, 3 N.Y.3d 357 (2004)   \n820 N.E.2d 840, 787 N.Y.S.2d 196, 2004 N.Y. Slip Op. 07617 \n \n \n7  In Tenenbaum v. Williams, 193 F.3d 581 [2d Cir.1999], a child’s parents brought an action pursuant to 42 USC § 1983 challenging \nthe New York City Child Welfare Administration’s removal of their five year old from her kindergarten class—under the \n \nemergency removal provision of Family Court Act § 1024—and taking her to the emergency room where a pediatrician and a \ngynecologist examined her for signs of possible sexual abuse. When they found none, the child was returned to her parents. The \nSecond Circuit reversed the District Court’s judgment in pertinent part and held that a jury could have concluded that the \nemergency removal for the medical examination violated the parents’ and child’s procedural due process rights, and the child’s \nFourth Amendment rights. \n \n8  Under section 1028, a parent or person legally responsible for the care of a child may petition the court for return of the child \nafter removal, if he or she was not present or given an adequate opportunity to be present at the section 1027 hearing. The \n \nfactors to be considered when returning a child removed in an emergency mirror those considered in an initial determination \nunder sections 1027 and 1022—best interests, imminent risk, and reasonable efforts to avoid removal. \n \n9  The order must state the court’s findings which support the necessity of removal, whether the parent was present at the hearing, \nwhat notice was given to the parent of the hearing and under what circumstances the removal took place (Family Ct. Act § \n \n1027[b][i] ). \n \n10  The Legislature added these provisions to sections 1022 and 1028 as well. \n \n \n11  The order must state the court’s findings concerning the necessity of removal, whether respondent was present at the hearing \nand what notice was given. \n \n \n12  Section 1022 also requires that the child be brought immediately to a social services department, that the agency make every \nreasonable effort to inform the parent where the child is and that the agency give written notice to the parent of the right to \n \napply to Family Court for return of the child. \n \n13  Section 1026 permits the return of a child home, without court order, in a case involving neglect, when an agency determines in \nits discretion that there is no imminent risk to the child’s health in so doing (Family Ct. Act § 1026[a], [b] ). If the agency does not \n \nreturn the child for any reason, the agency must file a petition forthwith, or within three days if good cause is shown (Family Ct. \nAct § 1026[c] ). \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n11 \n ",

This is a civil rights action, pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. '1983, on behalf of victims of domestic violence and their\nchildren. In this action plaintiffs seek damages and declaratory\nand injunctive relief to redress the deprivation, under color of\nstate law, of rights secured to them under the First, Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\nPlaintiffs also seek damages for the deprivation of their rights\nunder the New York constitution and laws. Under the misnomer of\n\"child protection,\" defendants routinely harass and terrorize\nvictims of domestic violence and their children, violating their\nfundamental rights.\nII. JURISDICTION\n2. Jurisdiction is conferred upon this court by 28\nU.S.C. '1343, which provides for original jurisdiction over all\nactions brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. '1983, and by 28 U.S.C.\n'1331, which provides jurisdiction over all cases brought\npursuant to the Constitution and laws of the United States. The\ncourt has jurisdiction over certain of the defendants pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. '1367. The court has pendent jurisdiction over\nplaintiffs' state law claims.\nIII. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n3. Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf,\nand, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), on behalf of a\nclass of similarly situated persons. Upon information and\n2\n\nbelief, the class presently consists of more than 5000 persons,\nand will include more than 1000 new persons each year.\n4. The class is defined as:\na. All victims of domestic violence in the City\nof New York who have been investigated by the Administration for\nChildren=s Services regarding allegations that they have abused\nor neglected their children by reason of said domestic violence,\nor who will be investigated in the future; and\nb. All domestic violence victims who have wanted\nor will want to seek protection from their batterers from the New\nYork Police Department, or from another City agency, or from the\ncourts, but who fear that the Administration for Children=s\nServices will remove their children if they do so; and\nc. All minor children of the parents listed in the\nprevious subparagraphs.\n5. The class is so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable.\n6. There are questions of law and fact common to the\nclass.\n7. Common questions of fact include:\na. Whether defendants have a policy or practice of\nremoving children from their mothers for the sole or primary\nreason that the mothers are victims of domestic violence, i.e.,\nwithout probable cause to believe that continuing in the care of\n3\n\ntheir mothers presents an imminent danger to the children=s life\nor health; and\nb. Whether defendants have a policy or practice of\nremoving children from mothers who are victims of domestic\nviolence without following the requirements regarding prior\nnotice and hearings set out by the Second Circuit Court of\nAppeals in Tenenbaum v. Williams, 193 F.3d 581 (2d Cir. 1999);\nand\nc. Whether defendants have a policy or practice of\nremoving children from mothers who are victims of domestic\nviolence without investigating whether the children will be in\ndanger if they remain with their mothers; and\nd. Whether, after removing children whose mothers\nare victims of domestic violence, defendants have a policy or\npractice of detaining the children in government custody without\ninvestigating whether the children will be in danger if they\nreturn to their mothers; and\ne. Whether defendants have a policy or practice of\ndemanding that mothers who are victims of domestic violence leave\ntheir homes as a condition of retaining or regaining custody of\ntheir children, regardless of whether the home is dangerous; and\nf. Whether defendants have a policy or practice of\ndemanding that mothers who are victims of domestic violence\nenroll in psychotherapy or counseling as a condition of retaining\n4\n\nor regaining custody of their children, i.e., without probable\ncause to believe that continuing in the care of their mothers\npresents an imminent danger to the children=s life or health; and\ng. Whether, after removing children whose mothers\nare victims of domestic violence, defendants have a policy or\npractice of shifting the burden to the mothers to prove that the\nmothers will not be battered in the future, before defendants\nagree to return the children to the mothers; and\nh. Whether defendants have a policy or practice of\nfailing to offer services to domestic violence victims and their\nchildren, to prevent or eliminate the need for removing the\nchildren; and\ni. Whether being a victim of domestic violence\nrenders a mother a per se unfit parent; and\nj. Whether defendants Scoppetta and City fail to\nprovide adequate training to employees of the Administration for\nChildren=s Services in handling cases involving domestic violence\nallegations.\n8. Common questions of law include:\na. Whether a policy of separating children from\ntheir mothers merely because the mothers are victims of domestic\nviolence violates the constitutional rights of the mothers to the\ncare and custody of their children, i.e., without probable cause\nto believe that continuing in the care of their mothers presents\n5\n\nan imminent danger to the children=s life or health; and\nb. Whether a policy of separating children from\ntheir mothers merely because the mothers are victims of domestic\nviolence B i.e., without probable cause to believe that\ncontinuing in the care of their mothers presents an imminent\ndanger to the children=s life or health B violates the\nconstitutional rights of the children to a family relationship;\nand\nc. Whether a policy of removing children from\ntheir mothers without investigating whether the children are in\ndanger violates the rights of the children to be free of\nunreasonable seizures; and\nd. Whether a policy of removing children from\nmothers who are victims of domestic violence, without following\nthe requirements regarding prior notice and hearings set out by\nthe Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Tenenbaum v. Williams, 193\nF.3d 581 (2d Cir. 1999), violates the rights of the mothers to\nprocedural due process of law; and\ne. Whether a policy of removing children from\nmothers who are victims of domestic violence, without following\nthe requirements regarding prior notice and hearings set out by\nthe Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Tenenbaum v. Williams, 193\nF.3d 581 (2d Cir. 1999) violates the rights of the children to\nprocedural due process of law; and\n6\n\nf. Whether the failure of defendants Scoppetta and\nCity to provide adequate training to employees of the\nAdministration for Children=s Services violates the\nconstitutional rights of victims of domestic violence and their\nchildren.\nIV. PARTIES\n9. Sharwline Nicholson is the mother of the infant\nplaintiffs: Destinee Barnett, born on March 21, 1998, and Kendell\nColes, born on February 9, 1993.\n10.

Defendant John Johnson is the Commissioner of the\nOffice of Children and Family Services of the State of New York.\nAs Commissioner, defendant Johnson is responsible for the\nadministration, regulation, and supervision of the State Central\nRegister of Child Abuse and Maltreatment.\nV. STATE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK\n30. Defendant State of New York has established a\ncentralized system for the collection and storage of information\non allegedly abusive and neglectful parents, which is operated by\nthe New York State Office of Children and Family Services\n(AOCFS@). OCFS=s information repository, called the Statewide\nCentral Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment (\"Central\nRegister\"), N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. '422(1), is located in Albany, New\nYork.\n31. The Central Register maintains a telephone hotline\n10\n\nwith an \"800\" telephone number, staffed by telephone operators 24\nhours a day, seven days a week, in order to receive complaints of\nchild abuse, child neglect, or child maltreatment. N.Y. Soc.\nServ. L. '422(2)(a). The state requires certain individuals to\nreport to the Central Register whenever \"they have reasonable\ncause to suspect that a child coming before them in their\nprofessional or official capacity is an abused or maltreated\nchild.\" N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. '413.\n32. These individuals include \"any physician; surgeon;\nmedical examiner; coroner; dentist; dental hygienist; osteopath;\noptometrist; chiropractor; podiatrist; resident; intern;\npsychologist; registered nurse; hospital personnel engaged in the\nadmission, examination, care or treatment of persons; a Christian\nScience practitioner; school official; social services worker;\nday care center worker; provider of family or group family day\ncare; employee or volunteer in a residential care facility . . .\nor any other child care or foster care worker; mental health\nprofessional; peace officer; police officer; district attorney or\nassistant district attorney; investigator employed in the office\nof a district attorney; or other law enforcement official.\" N.\nY. Soc. Serv. L. '413(1).\n33. The system encourages over-reporting of parents by\npenalizing the failure to report and protecting false reporting.\nA person who is required to report suspected child abuse,\n11\n\nneglect, or maltreatment may be subject to criminal prosecution\nunder N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. '420(1) or civil liability under N.Y.\nSoc. Serv. L. '420(2) for erroneously failing to do so.\n34. Anyone who makes a report is entitled to immunity\nfrom all liability if the report turns out to be false, unless\nthe wrongfully-reported parent proves that the reporter acted in\nbad faith. N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. '419.\n35. In addition to persons required by law to do so,\nanyone who wants to report that a parent has abused or neglected\na child has the right to call the hotline. N.Y. Soc. Serv. L.\n'414.\n36. The report may even be made anonymously, and many\nreports are.\n37. Whenever a person makes a report of suspected\nchild abuse, neglect, or maltreatment to one of the local child\nabuse offices, that office must transmit the report to the\nCentral Register. N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. '415.\n38. Upon receiving a complaint of suspected child\nabuse, neglect, or maltreatment, the telephone operator who\nanswers the hotline must determine whether to accept the\ncomplaint, i.e., whether the allegations, if true, would be\nlegally sufficient to constitute child abuse, neglect, or\nmaltreatment. N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. '422(2)(b).\n39. Upon information and belief, the State Central\n12\n\nRegister has a policy of accepting allegations of domestic\nviolence.\n40. If the telephone operator accepts the complaint,\nthe operator records the complaint on paper and relays it by\ntelephone or facsimile machine to the office of the county\nDepartment of Social Services (\"county department\") in the county\nin which the child is living or staying. N.Y. Soc. Serv. L.\n'422(2)(b). In New York City (which is considered one county),\nthe report is transmitted to the appropriate borough field office\nof the Administration for Children=s Services.\n41. ACS is responsible for investigating all\ncomplaints of suspected child abuse, neglect, and maltreatment\nthat they receive from the Central Register. N.Y. Soc. Serv. L.\n'424(6).\n42. ACS has no discretion to weed out complaints that\nACS staff believe are legally insufficient, because the decision\nthat a complaint is legally sufficient has already been made by\nthe Office of Children and Family Services in Albany.\n43. ACS must make a preliminary assessment within\nseven days of receiving each report. ACS must send a report,\ncontaining that assessment, along with information as to the\nprogress of their investigation, to the Central Register. N. Y.\nSoc. Serv. L. '424(3).\n44. ACS must complete each investigation within 60\n13\n\ndays of receiving the report of suspected child abuse, neglect,\nor maltreatment. N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. '424(7).\n45. At the end of the investigation, ACS must\ndetermine whether there is \"some credible evidence\" of the\nallegations in the complaint. N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. '412(6). If\nso, ACS determines that the report is \"indicated.\" If not, ACS\ndetermines that the report is \"unfounded.\" N. Y. Soc. Serv. L.\n''424(7); 412(5). ACS transmits the determination, as well as\nthe reasons for the determination, to the Central Register. N.Y.\nSoc. Serv. L. '424(3).\n46. Both the Central Register and OFCS accept the\nconclusion of ACS and do not make independent assessments as to\nwhether a complaint is \"indicated\" or \"unfounded.\" If ACS\ndetermines that a complaint is unfounded, the Central Register\nexpunges or seals all information regarding the family from its\nfiles.\n47. If ACS determines that there is some credible\nevidence to support the charges in the complaint, or any\nadditional charges that ACS staff may have discovered during the\ncourse of the investigation, the Central Register retains all\ninformation on the family in its database and in its library\nuntil the family's youngest child reaches the age of 28. N.Y.\nSoc. Serv. L. '422(6).\n48. At any time during the 60 day investigation, ACS\n14\n\nhas discretion to commence child protective proceedings against\nthe parents in the Family Court. N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act '1032(a);\nN.Y. Soc. Serv. L. '397(2)(b).\n49. If ACS determines that a complaint is \"indicated,\"\nACS may commence child protective proceedings against the parents\nafter the 60 day period has elapsed. N.Y. Soc. Serv. L.\n'424(11). ACS acts as the petitioner (prosecutor) in the Family\nCourt. N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act '1032(a).\n50. Child protective proceedings resemble criminal\nprosecutions in that they involve three types of hearing: first,\na preliminary hearing, to determine who will have custody of the\nchild while the case is pending, N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act ''1027, 1028;\nsecond a fact-finding hearing to determine whether the parents\nhave abused or neglected the child; and, finally, a dispositional\nhearing to determine where the child should live. N.Y. Fam. Ct.\nAct ''1044, 1045, 1047(a).\n51. In child protective proceedings in the Family\nCourt, indigent adults who are charged with child abuse or\nneglect have a right to have counsel appointed to represent them.\nN.Y. Fam. Ct. Act '262(a)(i). The children who are the subjects\nof the proceeding have a right to have law guardians appointed\nfor them. N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act '249.\n52. New York law provides that the counties (including\nthe City of New York) will pay the attorneys who represent\n15\n\nparents in Family Court cases, and sets a maximum hourly rate for\nattorneys of $25.00 per hour for work performed out of court and\n$40.00 per hour for work performed in court. New York law sets\nthe maximum compensation for attorneys at $800.00 per case. New\nYork law provides that the state will pay law guardians for\nchildren in Family Court cases, and provides the same maximum\nrate of compensation for the law guardians.\n53. The information contained in the Central Register\nis nominally confidential, but so many individuals and\norganizations are entitled to that information, or at least\nportions of the information, that confidentiality exists in name\nonly. The following individuals and organizations have access to\ninformation in the Central Register: physicians; persons taking\nchildren into protective custody; child-caring (foster care)\nagencies; courts; grand juries; legislative committees;\nprospective employers of individuals who will have \"the potential\nfor regular and substantial contact with children\"; agencies\nwhich license individuals who will have contact with children;\nthe state commission on the quality of care of the mentally\ndisabled; probation services; district attorneys; police\ndepartments; the New York City Department of Investigation;\nfoster care agencies, day care centers, the department of\neducation, and the State Division for Youth; preventive services\nprograms; adoption investigators; and child abuse investigators\n16\n\nfrom other states. N.Y. Soc. Serv. L. '422(4)(A).\n54. When an individual applies for a job in which she\nwill have the potential for regular and substantial contact with\nchildren, the prospective employer is required to check with the\nState Central Register to ascertain whether the applicant is\nlisted on the State Central Register as an abusive or neglectful\nmother.\n55. If the applicant is listed on the Register, the\nemployer may not hire the applicant unless the employer explains\nin writing why the employer has decided to hire a person with a\nrecord as an abusive or neglectful parent.\n56. As a practical matter, people whose names are on\nthe list of abusive or neglectful parents in the State Central\nRegister cannot obtain employment in the field of working with\nchildren, because no employer will hire an applicant whose name\nis on the list.\nV. FACTS\n57. In January, 1999, plaintiff was living together\nwith her children, the infant plaintiffs herein.\n58. On January 27, 1999, Claude Barnett came to\nplaintiff=s home and assaulted plaintiff, causing severe\ninjuries.\n59. Throughout said assault, infant plaintiff Destinee\nwas asleep in another room, and infant plaintiff Kendell was at\n17\n\nschool.\n60. Claude Barnett, the father of infant plaintiff\nDestinee, had separated from plaintiff prior to the birth of\nDestinee, and moved to another state.\n61. Prior to January 27, 1999, Claude Barnett had\nnever behaved violently toward plaintiff.\n62. Claude Barnett has never behaved violently toward\ninfant plaintiffs.\n63. Immediately after assaulting plaintiff on January\n27, 1999, Claude Barnett fled. Plaintiff called the police and\nEmergency Medical Services immediately.\n64. Two police officers arrived shortly thereafter,\nfollowed by an Emergency Medical Service team.\n65. The police officers interviewed plaintiff about\nthe assault. They saw that plaintiff was bleeding profusely from\na head wound, and that there was blood all over her apartment.\nThey also saw that Destinee was asleep and that Kendell was not\nat home.\n66. When the Emergency Medical Service team arrived,\nthey wrapped bandages around plaintiff=s head, put a collar\naround her neck to immobilize it, and strapped her onto a\nstretcher.\n67. Plaintiff arranged for her neighbor to care for\nDestinee and to pick up Kendell from school, and was then taken\n18\n\nto the hospital by ambulance.\n68. Two other police officers came to the hospital and\ninterviewed the plaintiff in the emergency room. The police\nasked plaintiff for the names of her relatives.\n69. Plaintiff cooperated fully and explained that\nClaude Barnett had attacked her while Destinee was asleep and\nKendell was at school.\n70. Sometime during the evening of January 27, 1999,\ndefendants Stropoli and Martin burst into the apartment of\nplaintiff=s neighbor, with their guns drawn.\n71. Defendants Stropoli and Martin searched the\napartment, awakened Kendell and Destinee, and then announced that\nthey were taking Kendell and Destinee away from the neighbor.\n72. Defendants Stropoli and Martin brought Kendell and\nDestiny to the precinct house.\n73. Upon information and belief, defendant Irizarry\nreported to the State Central Register of Child Abuse and\nMaltreatment (the child abuse hotline) that plaintiff had\nmistreated her children by engaging in domestic violence in their\npresence.\n74. Said report was false, and defendant Irizarry knew\nor should have known that it was false.\n75. Upon information and belief, said report was\ntransmitted electronically to ACS, where the case was assigned to\n19\n\ndefendant Halstion for investigation.\n76. Upon information and belief, while Kendell and\nDestinee were at the precinct house, plaintiff=s cousin came to\nthe precinct house and sought to take Kendell and Destinee to her\nhome.\n77. Upon information and belief, defendant Halstion\ninstructed defendants Irizarry, Roe, and Doe not to release\nKendell and Destinee to plaintiff=s cousin, but rather to\ntransport Kendell and Destinee to Halstion=s office at ACS.\n78. Upon information and belief, defendant Lopez\ntransported Kendell and Destinee to ACS, and left Kendell and\nDestinee with defendant Halstion.\n79. Upon information and belief, defendant Halstion\nplaced Kendell and Destinee in a foster home.\n80. On January 28, 1999, defendant Halstion telephoned\nplaintiff and told her that the City of New York had taken\ncustody of her children. Defendant Halstion refused to tell\nplaintiff where her children were staying and refused to permit\nplaintiff to speak to Kendell and Destinee.\n81. Upon information and belief, on or about January\n28, 1999, agents of defendant Scoppetta transferred plaintiffs=\ncase to defendant Clark for investigation.\n82. Upon information and belief, defendant Scoppetta\nassigned defendants Degannes and Victorin to supervise defendant\n20\n\nClark. Upon information and belief, defendant Scoppetta assigned\ndefendant Williams to supervise defendants Degannes and Victorin.\n83. Upon information and belief, on February 2, 1999,\ndefendant Clark, acting with the consent and pursuant to the\ndirectives of defendants Williams, Victorin, and Degannes,\ncommenced child protective proceedings against plaintiff in the\nFamily Court of the State of New York, Kings County.\n84. Said defendants alleged that plaintiff had\nneglected both of her children by engaging in acts of domestic\nviolence in front of infant plaintiff, Destinee and that the\nJanuary 27 incident was only one of several such acts.\nDefendant also swore that Claude Barnett hit infant plaintiff\nKendell on the mouth. Said allegations were false and defendants\nClark, Victorin, Degannes, and Williams knew or should have known\nthat the allegations were false.\n85. Upon information and belief, on February 2, 1999,\ndefendant Clark, acting with the consent and pursuant to the\ndirectives of defendants Williams, Degannes, and Victorin,\nobtained an order from the Brooklyn Family Court, ex parte,\npermitting defendants City and Scoppetta to retain custody of\ninfant plaintiffs Kendell and Destinee.\n86. Defendants detained Kendell and Destinee until\nFebruary 18, 1999, when defendants finally released the infant\nplaintiffs to plaintiff. Plaintiff never consented to the\n21\n\ndetention of the infant plaintiffs.\n87. During the three weeks that Kendell and Destinee\nwere in defendants= custody, defendants failed to send Kendell to\nschool.\n88. After releasing the infant plaintiffs to\nplaintiff, defendants continued the Family Court proceedings\nagainst plaintiff for six more months, during which time\nplaintiff was required to appear in court on many occasions.\n89. Upon information and belief, on March 15, 1999,\ndefendant Clark, acting through the attorney for ACS and with the\nconsent and pursuant to directives of defendants Williams,\nVictorin and Degannes, obtained a warrant from the family court\nfor plaintiff=s arrest.\n90. Defendant Clark procured the warrant by providing\nfalse and misleading information to the Family Court.\n91. Defendant Clark knew or should have known that her\nrepresentations were false.\n92. Agents of defendant Safir arrested plaintiff on\nApril 7, 1999, pursuant to said warrant.\n93. Plaintiff was held in custody for most of the day,\nand was finally released in the late afternoon or early evening.\n94. Finally, on August 5, 1999, defendants Scoppetta,\nWilliams, Clark, Victorin, and Degannes withdrew all charges\nagainst plaintiff.\n22\n\n95. Upon information and belief, defendants Scoppetta,\nWilliams, Clark, Victorin, and Degannes, despite withdrawing all\ncharges against plaintiff, made an administrative determination\nthat plaintiff had neglected her children.\n96. Upon information and belief, defendants Williams,\nClark, and Degannes notified agents of defendant Johnson that\nplaintiff was a neglectful mother.\n97. Agents of defendant Johnson accordingly placed\nplaintiff=s name on their list of abusive and neglectful parents\nin the State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment.\n98. Defendant Johnson and his agents will disseminate\nthe information that plaintiff=s name is on the List of abusive\nparents to any prospective employers in any field that involves\nworking with children.\n99. Plaintiff will be unable to obtain employment in\nany field that involves working with children as long as her name\nis on the List.\n100. Plaintiff is entitled to an administrative hearing\nto clear her name.\n101. Plaintiff requested such a hearing more than a\nyear ago, and defendant Johnson still has not scheduled such a\nhearing.\n102. Within ninety days after the claim herein sued\nupon arose, plaintiffs caused a notice of claim in writing to be\n23\n\nserved upon defendant City. Said claim has not been paid, and\nmore than thirty days has elapsed since the service of the\nnotice.\nVI. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION\n103. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 102.\n104. Upon information and belief, defendants City,\nScoppetta, and Safir have a policy of removing and detaining\nchildren from mothers who are victims of domestic violence\nwithout probable cause to believe that continuing in the care of\ntheir mothers presents an imminent danger to the children=s life\nor health, without due process of law, and based upon\nconstitutionally inadequate investigations.\n105. Acting pursuant to said policy, and without\nprobable cause to believe that continuing in the care of their\nmother presented an imminent danger to the children=s life or\nhealth, and without due process of law, and based upon a\nconstitutionally inadequate investigation, defendants Halstion,\nStropoli, Martin, Irizarry, and Lopez removed infant plaintiffs\nfrom plaintiff.\n106. Acting pursuant to said policy, without probable\ncause to believe that continuing in the care of their mothers\npresents an imminent danger to the children=s life or health and\nwithout due process of law, and based upon a constitutionally\n24\n\ninadequate investigation, other employees of ACS and the New York\nPolice Department have removed, and/or will remove, infant class\nmembers from adult class members.\n107. Acting pursuant to said policy, without probable\ncause to believe that continuing in the care of their mother\npresented an imminent danger to the children=s life or health,\nwithout due process of law, and based on a constitutionally\ninadequate investigation, defendants Williams, Clark, Victorin,\nand Degannes detained the infant plaintiffs in government custody\nfor three weeks.\n108. Acting pursuant to said policy, and without\nprobable cause to believe that continuing in the care of their\nmothers presents an imminent danger to the children=s life or\nhealth, without due process of law, and based on constitutionally\ninadequate investigations, other employees of ACS have detained\nand/or will detain infant class members in government custody.\n109. Said policy, and the removal and detention\neffectuated pursuant to said policy, constituted an unlawful\ninterference with plaintiff=s liberty interest in the care and\ncustody of her children, the infant plaintiffs herein, in\nviolation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution. Said policy, and its implementation, were\ngross deviations from acceptable professional conduct.\n110. Said policy and its implementation, constituted\n25\n\nunlawful interference with infant plaintiffs= liberty interest in\nbeing cared for by their mother.\n111. In the alternative, defendants City, Scoppetta,\nand Safir failed to adopt policies requiring their employees to\nremove children only if they had probable cause to believe that\ncontinuing in the care of their mothers presents an imminent\ndanger to the children=s life or health, only if they provided\ndue process of law to children and parents, and only if they had\ninvestigated to determine said factors. Defendants City,\nScoppetta, and Safir knew or should have known that said failure\nwould cause defendants' agents and employees to remove and detain\nchildren without probable cause to believe that continuing in the\ncare of their mothers presents an imminent danger to the\nchildren=s life or health and without due process of law, in\nviolation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution.\n112. Defendants City, Scoppetta, and Safir knew or\nshould have known that their failure to adopt a policy requiring\ntheir employees to afford plaintiffs and class members due\nprocess of law in connection with the removal of the infant class\nmembers would cause defendants' agents and employees to remove\nand detain infant class members from the adult class members\nwithout due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.\n26\n\n113. Defendants City, Scoppetta, and Safir knew or\nshould have known that their failure to adopt a policy regarding\nthe removal of infant class members from adult class members\nwould cause defendants' agents and employees to violate infant\nclass members= and adult class members= rights to live together\nas a family without state intervention, contrary to the First and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n114. As a result of the defendants' actions, plaintiff\nand adult class members suffered or will suffer the loss of\nfreedom and of the custody and services of their children; the\ninfant plaintiffs infant class members have suffered or will\nsuffer the loss of liberty and of the care and guidance of their\nmother; and all three named plaintiffs suffered extreme\nhumiliation, pain and suffering, terror, mental anguish, and\ndepression.\nVII. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION\n115. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 114.\n116. Defendants City, Safir, and Scoppetta provided\ngrossly inadequate and unprofessional training and supervision to\ntheir agents and employees regarding:\na. investigating child abuse and neglect cases\ninvolving mothers who are victims of domestic violence;\nb. determining whether there exists probable cause\n27\n\nto believe that continuing in the care of their mothers presents\nan imminent danger to the children=s life or health to remove or\ndetain children whose mothers are domestic violence victims;\nc. the provision of notice and an opportunity to\nbe heard prior to, or immediately after, the removal of children;\nd. the constitutional rights of parents and\nchildren in child welfare investigations; and\ne. the obtaining of arrest warrants in Family\nCourt.\n117. Defendants City, Safir, and Scoppetta knew or\nshould have known that their employees were improperly trained\nand supervised in said issues.\n118. Defendants City, Safir, and Scoppetta knew or\nshould have know that their employees would confront said issues\nin their work and that, without training, they would make the\nwrong decisions on said issues.\n119. By reason of their lack of training, defendants\nStropoli, Martin, Lopez, Irizarry, Clark and Halstion, improperly\nremoved the infant plaintiffs from the custody of plaintiff.\n120. By reason of the foregoing, employees of ACS and\nthe New York Police Department have improperly removed and/or\nwill improperly remove the infant class members from the custody\nof the adult class members.\n121. By reason of their lack of training, defendants\n28\n\nClark, Williams, Victorin, and Degannes detained infant\nplaintiffs from plaintiff for three weeks without adequate notice\nto plaintiff, without adequate investigation, without probable\ncause to believe that continuing in the care of their mother\npresented an imminent danger to the children=s life or health\nand/or without due process of law.\n122. By reason of the foregoing, employees of ACS and\nthe New York Police Department have detained and/or will detain\ninfant class members from the custody of adult class members,\nwithout adequate notice to adult class members, without adequate\ninvestigation, without probable cause to believe that continuing\nin the care of their mothers presents an imminent danger to the\nchildren=s life or health, and/or without due process of law.\n123. As a result of the defendants' actions, plaintiff\nand adult class members suffered or will suffer the loss of\nfreedom and of the custody and services of their children; the\ninfant plaintiffs and infant class members have suffered or will\nsuffer the loss of liberty and of the care and guidance of their\nmother; and all three named plaintiffs suffered extreme\nhumiliation, pain and suffering, terror, mental anguish, and\ndepression.\nVIII. THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION\n124. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 123.\n29\n\n125. By removing and detaining the infant plaintiffs\nfrom plaintiff, defendants unlawfully interfered with plaintiff's\ncustody of her minor children.\n126. As a result of the defendants' actions, plaintiff\nsuffered the loss of freedom and of the custody and services of\nher children; the infant plaintiffs suffered the loss of liberty\nand of the care and guidance of their mother; and all plaintiffs\nsuffered extreme humiliation, pain and suffering, terror, mental\nanguish, and depression.\nIX. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n127. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 126.\n128. By removing and detaining the infant plaintiffs,\ndefendants unlawfully imprisoned said infant plaintiffs.\n129. By procuring an arrest warrant based upon false\nstatements, and causing the execution of said warrant, defendants\nunlawfully imprisoned the adult plaintiff.\n130. As a result of the defendants' actions, plaintiff\nsuffered the loss of freedom and of the custody and services of\nher children; the infant plaintiffs suffered the loss of liberty\nand of the care and guidance of their mother; and all plaintiffs\nsuffered extreme humiliation, pain and suffering, terror, mental\nanguish, and depression.\nX. FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n30\n\n131. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 130.\n132. Upon information and belief, defendants City,\nSafir and Scoppetta had, at all times material, a policy of\nfiling child protective proceedings maliciously and without\nprobable cause against mothers who are victims of domestic\nviolence.\n133. Acting pursuant to said policy, on or about\nFebruary 2, 1999, defendants Williams, Victorin, Degannes and\nClark, commenced child protective proceedings against plaintiff\nNicholson maliciously and without probable cause.\n134. Acting pursuant to said policy, from February 2,\n1999, until August 5,1999, defendants City, Scoppetta, Clark,\nWilliams, Degannes and Victorin continued the prosecution of\nplaintiff in the Family Court.\n135. Defendants City, Scoppetta, Clark, Williams,\nDegannes, and Victorin caused said charges to be filed and\ncontinued wilfully, maliciously, without probable cause, and for\nreasons other than to see justice done.\n136. On August 5, 1999, all of the charges were\nresolved and determined in plaintiff's favor.\n137. In commencing and continuing said charges,\ndefendants City, Scoppetta, Clark, Williams, Degannes, and\nVictorin, acting under color of state law, in gross and wanton\n31\n\ndisregard of plaintiff's rights, violated plaintiff's right to be\nfree of malicious prosecution, under the Fourth Amendment of the\nUnited States Constitution.\n138. In the alternative, defendants City, Safir and\nScoppetta failed to adopt any policies or standards for deciding\nwhether to file child protective proceedings in Family Court\nagainst mothers who are victims of domestic violence.\n139. Defendants City, Safir and Scoppetta knew or\nshould have known that their failure to adopt policies or\nstandards would cause their employees to abuse government power\nby filing child protective proceedings maliciously against adult\nclass members.\n140. As a result of the defendants' actions, plaintiff\nsuffered the loss of the custody and services of her children;\nthe infant plaintiffs suffered the loss of liberty and of the\ncare and guidance of their mother; and all plaintiffs suffered\nextreme humiliation, pain and suffering, terror, mental anguish,\nand depression.\nXI. SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n141. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 140.\n142. In commencing and continuing child protective\nproceedings against plaintiff in the Family Court, defendants\nprosecuted plaintiff maliciously and without probable cause, in\n32\n\nviolation of the laws of the State of New York.\n143. As a result of the defendants' actions, plaintiff\nsuffered the loss of the custody and services of her children;\nthe infant plaintiffs suffered the loss of liberty and of the\ncare and guidance of their mother; and all of the plaintiffs\nsuffered extreme humiliation, pain and suffering, terror, mental\nanguish, and depression.\nXII. SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n144. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 143.\n145. All of the defendants had a duty to act with\nreasonable care toward plaintiff and with the highest degree of\ncare toward the infant plaintiffs.\n146. Defendants= removal and detention of the infant\nplaintiffs and defendants= prosecution of plaintiff constituted\ngross breaches of said duty and gross deviations from accepted\nprofessional standards.\n147. As a result of the defendants' actions, plaintiff\nsuffered the loss of freedom and of the custody and services of\nher children; the infant plaintiffs suffered the loss of liberty\nand of the care and guidance of their mother; and all plaintiffs\nsuffered extreme humiliation, pain and suffering, terror, mental\nanguish, and depression.\nXIII. EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n33\n\n148. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 147.\n149. When City defendants commence child protective\nproceedings in the Family Court, charging adult class members\nwith child neglect or child abuse, adult class members have a\nright to counsel; and indigent adult class members have a right\nto have counsel appointed to represent them.\n150. The right to counsel is protected by the New York\nState Constitution. See, Matter of Ella B., 30 N.Y.2d 352, 334\nN.Y.S.2d 133, 285 N.E.2d 288 (1972). That right is also\nguaranteed by statute. N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act '262(a)(i).\n151. Moreover, because of the complex nature of child\nprotective proceedings that charge battered women with neglecting\ntheir children solely or primarily because they are victims of\ndomestic violence, indigent battered women have a presumptive\nright under the Due Process Clause of the United States\nConstitution to have counsel appointed to represent them. See,\nLassiter v. Department of Social Services, 452 U.S. 18, 101 S.Ct.\n2153 (1981).\n152. When City defendants commence child protective\nproceedings in the Family Court, the children who are the\nsubjects of the proceedings have the right to representation by a\nlaw guardian. N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act '249(a).\n153. Defendant State of New York has established a\n34\n\nsystem of panels of attorneys who are certified to accept\nassignments of cases in the Family Court, including assignments\nto represent domestic violence victims who are charged with child\nneglect. N.Y. County Law '722-b; see also N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act\n'245; N.Y. Judiciary L. '35.\n154. One panel (the First Department Panel) provides\nrepresentation to individuals with cases in Family Court in\nManhattan and the Bronx. The other panel (the Second Department\nPanel) provides representation to individuals with cases in\nFamily Court in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island.\n155. Many children in child protective proceedings are\nrepresented by the Legal Aid Society, under a contract with the\nState of New York.\n156. Most of the children who are not represented by\nthe Legal Aid Society are represented by attorneys selected from\nthe appropriate assigned counsel panel.\n157. Defendants State of New York and Pataki limit the\ncompensation for assigned counsel to $25.00 per hour for work\nperformed out of court, and $40.00 per hour for work performed in\ncourt.\n158. Defendants State of New York and Pataki impose a\nmaximum of $800.00 for representing a parent or child in the\nFamily Court. Said maximum may be exceeded only by order of the\nFamily Court in an individual case, based upon extraordinary\n35\n\ncircumstances.\n159. Those rates are woefully inadequate to attract\ncompetent counsel to represent indigent battered women and their\nchildren in child protective proceedings in the New York Family\nCourt.\n160. As a result of the appallingly low rate of\ncompensation to attorneys, fewer and fewer attorneys are willing\nto participate on the assigned counsel panels in the First and\nSecond Departments.\n161. As a result of the appallingly low rate of\ncompensation to attorneys, those attorneys who agree to serve on\nthe panel and represent battered women or their children in child\nprotective proceedings in the Family Court are unable to perform\nthe in-depth investigations and preparation work that those\ncomplex cases require.\n162. In addition, the relatively few attorneys who\nagree to serve on the panel are pressured to take on far more\ncases than they can handle effectively.\n163. In restricting the number of lawyers who are\navailable to represent infant and indigent adult class members in\nchild protective proceedings in the New York Family Court,\ndefendants Pataki and State have violated, are violating, and\nwill violate the class members= right to due process of law, as\nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\n36\n\nConstitution, and class members= right to counsel, as guaranteed\nby the United States Constitution and the constitution and laws\nof the State of New York.\nXIV. NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n164. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 163.\n165. In addition to limiting the number of attorneys\navailable to represent battered women and their children by the\nlow rate of compensation, defendants State of New York and\nLippman further limit the availability of competent counsel to\nbattered women and their children by prohibiting attorneys from\nspecializing in the subject area that they know best.\n166. Defendant Lippman=s rules require that all\nattorneys on the panels in the First and Second Department serve\na minimum of six intake days each year.\n167. Specifically, defendant Lippman=s regulations\nrequire that the attorneys be present in the Family Court on each\nof their intake days, to accept assignments on all new cases in\nwhich counsel may be assigned, including guardianship cases,\ncustody cases, cases to terminate parental rights, family offense\ncases, juvenile delinquency cases, paternity cases, and certain\ntypes of child support cases.\n168. As a result of defendant Lippman=s refusal to\npermit attorneys to specialize, those attorneys who have an\n37\n\ninterest and experience in representing domestic violence victims\nand/or children of domestic violence victims decline to serve on\nthe assigned counsel panels, thereby depriving said women and\nchildren of experienced counsel.\n169. As a result of said refusal, defendants Lippman\nand State have violated, are violating, and will violate the\nclass members= right to due process of law, as guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and class\nmembers= right to counsel, as guaranteed by the United States\nConstitution and the constitution and laws of the State of New\nYork.\nXV. TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n170. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 169.\n171. Defendants State and Pataki provide inadequate\nfunding to the Legal Aid Society for representation of children\nin child protective proceedings in the Family Court.\n172. As a result of the failure to provide adequate\nfunding, the Legal Aid Society has grave difficulty providing\nzealous and effective representation to the infant class members\nwho are involved in child protective proceedings in the Family\nCourt.\n173. As a result of said failure, children in Family\n38\n\nCourt cases are deprived of their right to effective assistance\nof counsel and to due process of law, in violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment of the Constitution and the constitution and\nlaws of the State of New York.\nXVI. ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n174. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 173.\n175. As part of the right to counsel who will advocate\nzealously and effectively on their behalf, battered women and\nchildren with child protective proceedings in the Family Court\nhave the right to the assistance of experts to assist in their\nrepresentation in Family Court proceedings.\n176. Defendants Lippman, Pataki, and State of New York\nroutinely fail to comply with their statutory and constitutional\nobligation by failing to make sufficient funds available for\nexperts.\n177. As a result of said failures, defendants Pataki\nand State have violated, are violating, and will violate the\nclass members= right to due process of law, as guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and the\nconstitution and laws of the State of New York.\nXVII. TWELFTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n178. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 177.\n39\n\n179. Upon information and belief, defendants Johnson\nand Scoppetta have a policy and/or practice of interpreting the\nNew York statutes that define child abuse and maltreatment in an\nunconstitutionally overly broad manner.\n180. With regard to class members, defendants Johnson\nand Scoppetta have a policy and/or practice of determining that a\nreport of child abuse or maltreatment is Aindicated,@ i.e.,\nsupported by some credible evidence, based solely or primarily\nupon the fact that the mother is or has been a victim of domestic\nviolence.\n181. As a result of said overly broad interpretation,\ndefendants have labelled members of the adult plaintiff class as\nabusive or neglectful solely or primarily because they are\nvictims of domestic violence, and have placed the names of said\nclass members on the list of abusive parents in the database\nmaintained by the State Central Register.\n182. As a result of said overly broad interpretation,\nadult class members are barred from employment in their chosen\nfields.\n183. By placing class members= names on the list of\nabusive and neglectful parents in the database maintained by the\nState Central Register, defendants Scoppetta and Johnson have\ndeprived, are depriving, and will deprive class members of their\nliberty, their privacy, and their right to seek employment in\n40\n\ntheir chosen profession, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\nof the Constitution, and have violated their rights under the\nconstitution and laws of the State of New York.\nXVIII. THIRTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n184. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 183.\n185. Defendants City and Scoppetta have a policy or\npractice of insisting that adult class members leave their homes\nand go to live in domestic violence shelters as a condition of\nretaining or regaining custody of their children.\n186. Some class members do not wish to leave their\nhomes and uproot their children, but defendants City and\nScoppetta and their agents and employees force the adult class\nmembers to leave their homes.\n187. Other class members wish to leave their homes and\ngo into domestic violence shelters. Those class members\ninvariably cannot find places in domestic violence shelters\nbecause defendant City provides a grossly inadequate number of\nplaces in shelters for mothers who are victims of domestic\nviolence.\n188. Because of City defendants= failure to provide\nsufficient shelter space, some adult and child class members must\nstay in the office of the City=s Emergency Assistance Unit for\n41\n\ndays and nights until a place becomes available in a domestic\nviolence shelter. The office is an inadequate and inappropriate\nplace for children and their mothers to live. Moreover, the\noffice has no security, leaving the mothers and children\naccessible to their batterers.\n189. By reason of the foregoing, defendants City and\nScoppetta have violated the rights of adult class members and\nchild class members to live together, free of government\ninterference, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the\nConstitution, and the constitution and laws of the State of New\nYork.\nXIX. FOURTEEnTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n190. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 189.\n191. Defendant City has a policy of barring women\nwithout children from its domestic violence shelters.\n192. As a result, adult class members whose children\nhave already been removed and placed in foster care are unable to\nfind shelter in domestic violence shelters.\n193. Defendant Scoppetta and his agents and employees\nhave a policy and practice of refusing to return children to\ntheir mothers who are domestic violence victims, and of keeping\nthose children in foster care, until the mothers go into domestic\nviolence shelters.\n42\n\n194. The conflicting policies of defendant Scoppetta\nand defendant City operate to keep children and their mothers\nseparated unnecessarily, in violation of the United States\nConstitution and the constitution and laws of the State of New\nYork.\nXX. FIFTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION\n195. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference\nparagraphs 1 through 194.\n196. When defendants City and Scoppetta seek to\nseparate children from the custody of their parents who are\ndomestic violence victims, the parents and children are entitled\nto due process of law, in the form of pre-deprivation hearings.\nIn emergency situations, where there is insufficient time to hold\npre-deprivation hearings, the parents and children are entitled\nto prompt post-deprivation hearings.\n197. Defendants State of New York and Pataki fail to\nallocate sufficient resources to the Family Court to provide pre-\ndeprivation hearings and prompt post-deprivation hearings to all\nparents and children who are legally entitled to such hearings.\n198. There are not enough judges, not enough court\npersonnel, and not enough courtrooms to hold prompt hearings for\nall parents and children.\n199. As a result, children and their parents are\nunnecessarily separated for protracted periods of time.\n43\n\n200. Said separations violate the rights of the parents\nand the children to due process of law, as guaranteed by the\nUnited States Constitution and the constitution and laws of the\nState of New York.\nWHEREFORE plaintiffs respectfully request that judgment\nbe entered:\n1. Declaring unconstitutional City defendants= policy\nand/or practice of removing and detaining children from their\nmothers, based upon the fact that the mothers are victims of\ndomestic violence, i.e., without probable cause to believe that\ncontinuing in the care of their mothers presents an imminent\ndanger to the children=s life or health; and\n2. Enjoining City defendants from removing and\ndetaining children from their mothers on the sole or primary\nground that the mothers are victims of domestic violence, i.e.,\nwithout probable cause to believe that continuing in the care of\ntheir mothers presents an imminent danger to the children=s life\nor health; and\n3. Declaring unconstitutional City defendants= policy\nand/or practice of removing and detaining children from mothers\nwho are victims of domestic violence without following the\nrequirements regarding prior notice and hearings set out by the\nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals in Tenenbaum v. Williams, 193\nF.3d 581 (2d Cir. 1999); and\n44\n\n4. Enjoining City defendants from removing and\ndetaining children from victims of domestic violence without\nfollowing the requirements regarding prior notice and hearings\nset out by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Tenenbaum v.\nWilliams, 193 F.3d 581 (2d Cir. 1999); and\n5. Declaring that City defendants= policy of removing\nchildren from mothers who are victims of domestic violence\nwithout investigating whether the children will be in danger if\nthey remain with their mothers is unconstitutional; and\n6. Enjoining City defendants from removing children\nfrom mothers who are victims of domestic violence without\ninvestigating whether the children will be in danger if they\nremain with their mothers; and\n7. Declaring that City defendants= policy or practice\nof detaining the children in government custody without\ninvestigating whether the children will be in danger if they\nreturn to their mothers is unconstitutional; and\n8. Enjoining City defendants from detaining the\nchildren in government custody without investigating whether the\nchildren will be in danger if they return to their mothers; and\n9. Declaring that City defendants= policy or practice\nof shifting the burden to the mothers to prove that the mothers\nwill not be battered in the future, before defendants agree to\nreturn the children to the mothers is unconstitutional; and\n45\n\n10. Enjoining City defendants from shifting the burden\nto the mothers to prove that the mothers will not be battered in\nthe future, before defendants agree to return the children to the\nmothers; and\n11. Ordering City defendants to provide training to\ntheir agents and employees on:\na. investigating child abuse and neglect cases\ninvolving mothers who are victims of domestic violence; and\nb. determining whether probable cause exists to\nremove or detain children whose mothers are domestic violence\nvictims, i.e., whether there exists probable cause to believe\nthat continuing in the care of their mothers presents an imminent\ndanger to the children=s life or health; and\nc. the provision of notice and an opportunity to\nbe heard prior to, or immediately after, the removal of children;\nand\nd. the constitutional rights of domestic violence\nvictims and their children in child welfare investigations; and\n12. Ordering City defendants to provide sufficient\nspace in domestic violence shelters for all class members who\nwant, need, and qualify for shelter space; and\n13. Enjoining City defendants from prohibiting adult\nclass members whose children have been removed from their custody\nfrom being housed in the City=s domestic violence shelters; and\n46\n\n14. Ordering City defendants to provide sufficient\nspace in domestic violence shelters for women whose children have\nbeen removed from their custody and placed in foster care, and\nwhose children will be able to reunite with their mothers if the\nmothers find space in shelters; and\n15. Enjoining defendants from removing children from\nmothers where the basis for the removal, in whole or in part, is\nthat the mother has been a victim of domestic violence; and\n16. Enjoining defendants from filing petitions under\nArticle Ten of the New York Family Court Act alleging that a\nparent who is a victim of domestic violence has engaged in\ndomestic violence as a ground for neglect on the part of said\nvictim; and\n17.

Because the counsel provisions were in part \n \njustified as a remedy for the putative constitutional questions we today avoid, we similarly defer consideration of the appointed \ncounsel issues until, with the guidance of the New York Court of Appeals, we have a more complete sense of the state statutory \nframework. \n \n2  ACS can also refer cases to the District Attorney for investigation and possible criminal prosecution. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law § 424(11). \n \n \n3  The District Court attempted to, but could not, find a representative on behalf of a class of alleged batterer parents. Nicholson v. \nWilliams, 203 F.Supp.2d 153, 165 (E.D.N.Y.2002). \n \n \n4  We understand “neglected” in this context to exclude neglect based on a finding that the custodian allowed the child to witness \ndomestic violence. The class definition itself notes that a prospective plaintiff is not excluded from the class “even if removal is \n \nultimately approved by a court.” In re Nicholson, 181 F.Supp.2d at 184. Thus, it is evident that the District Court did not intend for \na Family Court finding of neglect, by itself, to foreclose class membership. \n \n5  We do not understand the basis for the dissent’s argument that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of liability \nunder Monell. See post at 177–179. The dissent’s view appears to be that the only “policy” at issue in this case is the alleged “ACS \n \npolicy to carry out removals based only upon past domestic violence and not based on a risk of ongoing harm to the child.” Post \nat 177. As we have explained, however, the District Court’s injunction was aimed not only at removals based strictly on past \nconduct, but also at removals justified by the possibility that future domestic violence would jeopardize the well-being of a child. \nIt is true that the District Court’s use of the phrase, “solely because the mother has been abused,” taken out of context, may \nbe ambiguous as to the two possibilities. The District Court’s opinion makes clear, however, that the District Court did not \nbelieve it appropriate to charge the abused parent with blame for any emotional injury that child witnesses might suffer. See, \ne.g., Nicholson, 203 F.Supp.2d at 200–01, 252–53. Thus, when the District Court writes that removal is “solely because the \nmother has been abused,” it is presuming that emotional harm to the child cannot be a basis for separating parent and child. \nWhile we do not consider the merits of that position now, it surely must inform our understanding of the policy actually \nconsidered by the District Court. \nFurthermore, it is evident from much of the District Court’s discussion that it plainly contemplated the possibility of future \ninstances of domestic violence in the challenged removals. For example, the District Court argued that among the reasons the \nremovals are unconstitutional is the availability of alternative methods for preventing recurrences of domestic violence. Id. at \n211. It also noted that ACS often failed to consider what the mother was doing to protect her child against further harm. Id. at \n250. One of the purported failings in ACS’s training procedures identified by the District Court was that ACS caseworkers are \nnot taught to recognize cases where the threat of future instances of domestic violence in fact constitutes a sufficient danger \nto justify removal. Id. at 220. \nTherefore, it is largely irrelevant to our analysis whether there was sufficient evidence to establish an official policy or custom \nof removal based solely on past instances of neglect. The policy challenged by the plaintiffs and considered by the District \nCourt was the alleged practice of removals based on a theory that allowing one’s child to witness ongoing domestic violence is \na form of neglect, either simply because such conduct is presumptively neglectful or because in individual circumstances it is \nshown to threaten the child’s physical or emotional health. \nWe also note our respectful disagreement with the dissent’s view that the allegedly unconstitutional removals cannot be \n“widespread,” simply because they represent a small percentage of the overall ACS caseload. See post at 178. We ask whether \na practice is “widespread” in order to determine whether there is a fair inference that the “practice ... [is] so manifest as to \nimply the constructive acquiescence of senior policy-making officials.” Sorlucco v. New York City Police Dep’t, 971 F.2d 864, 871 \n(2d Cir.1992). We believe that the hundreds of incidents of unconstitutional conduct found by the District Court would \ncertainly represent overwhelming evidence of the constructive acquiescence of senior officials, no matter how burdened such \nofficials were with other matters. \n20 \n \n\nNicholson v. Scoppetta, 344 F.3d 154 (2003)   \n \n \n \n6  We respectfully disagree with the suggestion of the dissent that the scope of the injunction in this case is so broad that it should \nbe vacated irrespective of the extent of the constitutional violations. See post at 181–184. We do not understand how we can \n \nassess the relation between right and remedy before we have determined what rights, if any, are affected by the alleged \nconduct. While we are sensitive to the concerns the dissent identifies, this court has recognized the need in some circumstances \nfor judicial oversight of state institutions in order to assure compliance with federal norms. See, e.g., N.Y. State Ass’n for Retarded \nChildren, Inc. v. Carey, 706 F.2d 956, 960–64 (2d Cir.1983); Jose P. v. Ambach, 669 F.2d 865, 869 (2d Cir.1982); Todaro v. Ward, \n565 F.2d 48, 53–54 (2d Cir.1977). We believe the plaintiffs are entitled to an opportunity to demonstrate that this case presents a \nneed for appropriate judicial intervention, the merits of which we do not consider here. \nNor do we believe, as the dissent further suggests, see post at 181, that a court can or should properly reach any conclusions \nabout the likelihood of irreparable harm from the strategic decisions of plaintiff’s counsel to delay seeking relief until such time \nas the plaintiffs can actually demonstrate that relief is warranted. \n \n7  As we noted supra, when ACS removes a child on its own initiative, the parent may move to have the child restored to her \ncustody. The Family Court must then generally hold a hearing within three days, and “shall grant [the parent’s] application, unless \n \nit finds that the return presents an imminent risk to the child’s life or health.” N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act § 1028(a). In those cases in which \nACS does not initiate removal on its motion, it can bring an application before the Family Court for a “preliminary order” of \nremoval, pending ACS’s filing of a formal petition for removal, id. § 1022, or pending final disposition of the child’s custody, id. § \n1027. The standards the court must apply in determining whether or not to approve or continue preliminary removal are \nessentially the same in either case. \n \n1  It is also not apparent from the record that ACS generally fails to provide testimony in Family Court regarding the risk of harm to \nthe child. \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n21 \n ",

The  New  York  City Administration  for  Children's  Services  (\"ACS\")  will \nforthwith  establish a procedure  for  resolution  of disputes  concerning the  application of the \nprinciples of law set forth in the Nicholson decision, as follows: \nPlaintiff Subclass A or B may bring to the attention of City defendants written \ncomplaints  regarding  individual  incidents  in which  City  defendants  allegedly \nfailed to handle a matter involving a Nicholson class member  consistent with the \nrequirements ofthe Nicholson decision.

Defendants  shall  make  a  good  faith  effort to \nresolve the complaint in accordance with the decision of the New York Court of \nAppeals. \n5.  Plaintiffs may restore this action to the active calendar upon a failure of ACS \nto establish the mechanism set out in paragraph 4 of this stipulation and order, solely for the \npurpose of compelling ACS to establish such a mechanism. \n6.  On September 1, 2005, plaintiffs' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief \nshall be dismissed with prejudice unless, before that time, plaintiffs move to restore the case to \nthe Court's active docket on a showing that, as to the filing of petitions against, or the removal of \nchildren from, victims of domestic violence, defendants have failed to act, on a systemic basis, \nconsistent with the decision of the Court of Appeals in Nicholson.  In the event of any such \nmotion, plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants' failures or omissions were not minimal or \nisolated, but were substantial and sufficiently frequent or widespread as to be systemic.  This \ndismissal will not bar plaintiff class members from commencing actions  for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief for alleged violations of law occurring after September I, 2005. \n7.
